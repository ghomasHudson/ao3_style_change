He pulls himself away from that train of thought and reminds himself yet again that it’s too late. It’s over. He casts his eyes down, and turns back to the car, throat tight with resurfacing guilt and frustration.
Dean wakes a few hours later and goes through his morning routine like he would any other day. He’s halfway through brushing his teeth when he realizes that there will be no more toothpaste left in his cabin afterwards. It’s this otherwise inconsequential thought that makes three things really sink in:
“Very funny,” Dean says and grits his teeth.
“Go get the others and meet me at the assembly room in 15 minutes. We have a plan to discuss.”
Dean gives him a look, annoyed with his cryptic choice of words.
This time it’s the angel who drops his gaze, which either means Dean pissed him off, or Cas thinks he has a point and doesn’t want to admit it. The way Cas’ jaw is working tells him that it might be both. Dean rubs a hand over his face and presses his lips together into a thin line before he steps closer to Cas and comes to lean against the edge of the table, facing the former angel.
Some of the people talk about leaving on their own, although Dean doubts they have any more of an idea where to go. These people are also the ones who constantly moan about being given too little food or toiletries, their talk of leaving no doubt rooted in selfishness. They don’t see egotism will get them nowhere except lying face down in a ditch somewhere while a Croat chews on their flesh.
However, the hunter is almost certain Cas was the one that salted and burned the old man’s body.
“I remember Anna,” Dean snaps. “And she wasn’t an angel when we—”
The words fall between them like stones. A cold feeling spreads in Dean’s chest. “They dragged her back to Bible camp like they did you, didn’t they?” Dean asks and sees Cas shiver. He is immediately hit by the urge to apologize for bringing up such a loaded memory, but in the end Dean just watches Cas take in a slow breath to steady himself.
Dean doesn’t want to admit it, but Walter has a point. Dean hasn’t trusted Cas with leading missions until recently, but something changed in these last few weeks since Dean abandoned his initial plan for Lucifer. Cas seems willing to get back in the game. He is ready to lead rather than solely follow Dean again and as a consequence has taken a load off him in ways that make Dean feel like he can finally breathe again. They may not have a plan, but Dean still feels like this is better than what they had before.
“Night, Cas.” Is what comes out of his mouth.
Dean finds himself shivering at the memory and drops his eyes to the floor.
“The Colt won’t work on Lucifer,” he says and Cas is pointedly silent.
His right hand reaches for the Colt like it has done countless times since he got it back. Once more he checks the amount of bullets in it. One. Just one.
And Castiel’s eyes narrow, mouth turning into a snarl. “Do you think I wanted this? Do you think I wanted to fall for—” Cas stumbles over his words, catches himself and tries again, voice dangerously low. Cas sounds a whole lot like back in the beautiful room all these years ago, when he asked Dean what about the world is worth saving. “—Do you think I wanted to fall? That I wanted to lose everything that I was, that I am? Because of
“I’m doing this to keep all of them safe.”
“Yes?”
He tries to conceal the fact that his breath catches in his throat at that statement by letting his head fall forward. His gaze ends up somewhere between his feet on the carpet as he opens them again. He can’t help swallowing thickly at the easy honesty and unwavering certainty he can hear in Cas’ tone. Dean doesn’t say anything. He doesn’t even dare to turn his head to take in Cas’ expression.
Walter howls in pain as he is forced to drop the knife. Cas goes for Walter’s legs next and within seconds the man is flat on his front, Cas towering over him, twisting his arm behind his back, one knee between his shoulderblades.
Maybe he does, Dean thinks absentmindedly as he watches Cas move across the room. Dean knows he’s staring, but he can’t seem to look away as he mulls the thought over.
Eventually, after another long pause Cas adds: “They were happy, too. For a while...” and something about his tone doesn’t sit right with Dean.
They fought off a wave of Croats two days ago and lost two men before the last of them were dealt with. Grief has a tight hold over camp and the feeling of dread lingers wherever one goes.
Cas’ words have a finality to them that make Dean swallow thickly. They look at each other for a long moment, until Dean falters again. He masks it by pouring himself another glass of whiskey. Then, he hears Cas resume his way to the door, the wood creaking under his feet, footsteps heavy.
“I’m just the one who failed him.”
“I had my suspicions.”
“Cas?”
This probably shouldn’t hurt as much as it does.
There is no going back now.
“What I meant was: how is Anna in this book?” he says, pushing all his conflicting feelings about the topic aside as he points down at the yellowed page in front of him.
To Dean any sort of touch on it never feels like much. It doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t even do as much as tickle. The scar tissue is simply numb to sensations.
Cas is at his side immediately.
This time, Dean does roll his eyes.  It’s not like he can go into the fact Cas is thousands of years old. People had a hard enough time wrapping their heads around a zombie apocalypse led by the devil, something tells him having a de-powered angel in their mids, and one that is notorious for doing drugs and sleeping around on top of that is beyond the understanding of just about everyone except those who know the whole story. At this point in time those are Chuck and Dean, although Dean isn’t entirely sure how much he really knows.
“I remember Uriel being furious that I would willingly put myself in danger for a human. He thought that I would ‘sully myself by touching your soul’.”
“Cas?”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m sure you’re true Miss Universe material.” Dean concedes and flips the page. Despite his annoyed tone a small smile tugs at the corners of his mouth when he spares Cas a glance and sees that Cas fighting a smile of his own. It makes something warm flutter in his chest. This sort of banter comes naturally between them these days and even though it’s about trivial stuff it makes him feel at ease around the former angel like he hasn’t in years.
Dean’s mind goes completely blank, his own question a mere reflex: “What?”
2) He is still alive
Dean doesn’t remember when Cas stopped arguing with him about his decisions –when he stopped caring enough to do that— only that he did. It became the most apparent when they realized the other angels left. Ever since then Cas went along with everything Dean says, although that doesn’t stop the former angel from telling him what he thinks of his plans in the most sarcastic way he can. Dean lets him voice his frustrations most of the time, because at the end of the day he knows Cas will let him go through with any plan he comes up with.
“Well, maybe Uriel was right.” Dean mumbles, thinking about how he only brought Cas sorrow, doubt and suffering since they met.
“What about the plan? The Colt? I thought—”
“Dean...?” Cas says. He sounds worried.
It goes on for about a month.
“This is it.”
‘I need you sober’ Dean said.
In the end he doesn’t laugh, he just gives her another smile and then pulls his arm out of her hold. “Meeting in five,” he tells her then. “Go and tell the others, would you?” And with that he proceeds to make his way over to his cabin and climbs the stairs to the entrance, thinking that he should probably put on some shoes before they move out.
He hears Castiel inhale sharply, and he hates that he doesn’t even have to look up to know that his eyes are now wide and round. “Dean, I didn’t mean—”
It’s then that Cas meets his eyes across the yard and something tightens in Dean’s chest again.
They make supply runs and scout for other survivors with varying success and fight off the regular amount of Croats with loosing the minimal amount of people. All things considered they’re doing as well as they can in a situation such as theirs.
‘Turns out I still have some fight left in me’
In the end, he doesn’t even attempt to find the right words and just slips back into his role as ‘the fearless leader’ as Cas likes to mockingly call him. He puts all his defenses back in place and buries every unhelpful feeling until he is able to meet Cas’ eyes again.
“Sorry,” he says.
The silence that stretches between them is deafening. So much so that he almost wants Cas to question his decisions and fight with him about further reducing their already dwindling numbers on something as arbitrary as a hunch, but Cas does no such thing.
It’s never the first place a woman touches him, but it’s almost a given that as soon as he’s buried inside of her she will. Dean isn’t entirely sure why, but he figures it’s a possessive thing. With Risa it definitely was. Her touch on it was tentatively during the first few times, forceful after his visits to her cabin became a regular occurence. Sometimes it seemed like she expected something to happen when she touched it – she would curl her slim fingers over the foreign handprint, her own hand slightly too small to cover it up completely— but nothing ever did.
Still, Cas chuckles softly, which surprises him. It’s a small and unreasonable thing, but he feels something flutter in his chest at the sound.
“So, what?” Cas asks into the silence that settled between them. “You finally realized how this plan of yours would play out and got scared? And now I’m supposed to have a solution? ” He chuckles. “It’s almost like old times, isn’t it? You calling on me when things get rough...” Cas leans back in his chair and exhales slowly as he looks up at the ceiling. “Sorry, but that is pretty much the one fix that I can’t provide you with.”
The only real improvement is to be found in Cas, which is a development Dean didn’t expect after their recent falling out. They haven’t talked about it, which comes as a surprise to no one. Neither of them apologized or even made so much as an attempt to. Dean doesn’t even know if he wants an apology and he certainly hasn’t found the courage to extend an olive branch himself.
“And you didn’t say anything?”
‘I need you’ is what Cas’ mind chooses to replay over and over.
Dean wishes he couldn’t identify that look on her face so easily. It would spare him feeling remorse for never being able to reciprocate her feelings.
Cas almost laughs at the notion. Dean doesn’t need him, hasn’t needed him in years, if ever. No one does. He furrows his brows before he pinches one of the white pills between his thumb and index finger and brings it to his lips. He’s not an angel anymore. He’s barely even a person, really.
“Damn right I am!” Risa exclaims and Cas squints his eyes at the tone of her voice. She sounds genuinely hurt, although she masks it well with her frustration. “I’ve been at his side for months now and he still doesn’t tell me anything.”
Cas isn't quite done marvelling at his rediscovered trenchcoat when there is a knock at his doorframe. “Come in,” he says, voice a little rougher than usual, and turns just as Chuck enters through the beaded curtain.
“Uriel was wrong.”  Cas avers.  His voice is low and so full of devotion that Dean can’t help but draw in a sharp breath.
Dean pretends the nickname doesn’t make him want to puke.
Maybe Cas is able to keep himself so collected because he's always been this all powerful creature. Maybe it's just hardwired into him, maybe Cas instinctively keeps everything firmly contained because of the scale on which his fury would strike if he didn't. After all, where Dean would go and wreck a car with a crowbar in his anger, Castiel was once able to wipe entire cities of the map.
The silence must have stretched a little to long, because when Dean turns back to Walter the man’s eyes are narrowed at them over their little wordless exchange, and his expression soures further when Dean meets his eyes.
Now, it’s Dean’s turn to nod. His throat is still tight with unsaid words when the former angel makes his way over to the door. Dean fights the overwhelming urge to tell him that he doesn’t have to leave, that he could stay and keep reading if he so chooses, that Dean wouldn’t mind.
It’s a lie he keeps telling. One he almost believes himself by now. The truth is, there is little left of his grace, maybe even less now than the last time he dared to evaluate its remaining power. Cas very rarely lets himself be lucid enough to get in touch with what remains of his grace nowadays. He wonders, not for the first time, if his grace will ever completely deminish; if one day he will be 'truly' human as opposed to 'practically' human.
Dean has had enough of this idiot.
“What’s so funny?”
They don’t have a plan, yet. Dean thinks fiercely.
Dean’s mouth goes dry. Years of anger and helplessness make their way to the forefront of his mind. “I tried okay?!” He snaps, voice rising in volume as he throws out his arms in a sudden gesture. He points at Cas. “Many times. It’s not like you wanted my help!”
Dean’s jaw is still set when Cas offers him one of the glasses, but he takes it from him eventually, resolve faltering along with the tension in his shoulders because damn, they both know he needs that drink. “To Yaeger.” Cas says, after he sits down and props his feet up on the table. He holds his glass out to Dean.
Cas’ eyes not being clouded over helps more than it should to calm him. Their gaze is sharp as he stares the other man down. He could speak up if he saw the need, but even rugged and without his grace Cas is above the nonsense Walter keeps spitting at him and Dean finds joy in the fact that the lack of a reaction clearly makes Walter uncomfortable.
“Get. Out.”
And judging from the way Cas doesn’t even do as much as let his gaze flicker towards Dean this time, the hunter is certain that yes, he really doesn’t want to know.
Cas’ eyes widen slightly as they flick up to Dean’s and the expression from before softens into one of sympathy. He seems a little more in the now, the seething anger from before slowly ebbing away.
“It ends tonight. One way or another,” Dean says when Cas is about halfway to the door. He sees him stop and turn his head to the side to look at him over his shoulder and Dean’s gaze falls to Cas’ lips when there is a shadow of a sad smile tugging at the corners of Castiel’s mouth. Then, the former angel presses his lips into a thin line before he turns to look at him straight on again. His eyes are for once not clouded by any drug, just pure clear blue.
Dean walks over to him and puts a hand on the table, leaning on it to give Cas a hard look. “This is serious,” he says, but Cas, as always, doesn’t seem even vaguely intimidated by Dean’s tone. He just looks up at him before he props his feet up on the table and crosses his arms in front of his chest. He gives Dean a tired grin, which only widens further when Dean’s expression turns into a glare.
Cas chuckles as he find Dean’s eyes again. “Dean, I haven’t been sober in years.”
It's the third night in a row with them holed up in Dean’s cabin and crowding over Bobby's old books when Dean can’t find it in him to concentrate on any of the pages in front of him for longer than five minutes at a time. It’s a combination of too much bad coffee and too little sleep that has him bouncing his legs and basically vibrating on his chair with restless energy.
Cas leaves Dean’s cabin feeling more sober than he entered it. He feels the old wood of the veranda beneath his bare feet as he walks. He could count every ridge and worn edge if he concentrated, could be aware of anything in the near vicinity if he tried to focus, but he doesn’t. The faint sensation of everything around him closing in on his awareness is already too much to bear as he feels the haze of the drugs clearing slowly.
“Very.” Cas agrees. His tone is oddly flat and there are suddenly a lot of implications in that one word.
There is a touch on his left shoulder. “Dean, you need to calm down.” If this was anyone else, Dean would probably have exploded in another fit of anger at the order, but when he wips his head to direct his fury at the former angel he is stunned silent by the unyielding fierceness in Cas’ eyes.
He can see the hurt in her eyes, although it’s not the same expression she wore during the earlier briefing. It’s no longer anger stemming from jealousy or frustration about Dean being like any other asshole who used her before. What shines in her eyes now is the kind of hurt that comes from worry and deep affection. The latter being the only thing people seem to give easily these days. Everyone responds so quickly to a friendly word or touch. It’s why Cas is so successful with his love-guru crap, because everyone hopes to still get something good out of this broken world.
From then on it’s pure chaos. A flurry of movements follows where everybody tries to stop the fight before it can escalate further. However, Walter fights them all off, including his so called friends and takes a few wild stabs at Dean.
He thinks about Cas again, about how the former angel looked at him back in the cabin. He probably saw it in Dean’s eyes the moment he stepped through the door, but he didn’t say anything. He didn’t try to stop him because Cas thinks it wouldn’t have made a difference either. Dean lets out a long breath before he slams his fist down on the roof of the car, causing the people around him to jump.
Dean sets the glass down between them, forcing the dark memories into the furthest corner of his mind. “We got the Colt,” he says then and Cas’ gaze flickers to him. It’s not surprise, or anything similar that make Cas’ eyebrows raise. It looks more like resigned realization, like he dreaded this moment for a long while, but knew it was coming, anyway.
Cas hums at him, turning his attention back to finishing with the bandage. “Some of my brothers and sisters used to call me stupid, too.” Cas says conversationally but his voice is painted with a mixture grief and nostalgia. It makes Dean swallow around the tight feeling in his throat.
Dean licks his lips, mouth suddenly feeling painfully dry. He isn’t always consciously aware of what Castiel did for him, but at times it will hit him like a sledgehammer to the chest. Castiel, an angel of the Lord, fought his way through hell in order to get to him, to free him, to save him. It’s something huge, monumental even, but the angel only smiles almost timidly when he retells it.
“And this is no trouble. I like being useful.”
“Wait here,” Cas instructs curtly and Dean nods, even though the other doesn’t wait for his reaction before he is halfway across the room, his movements calculated and precise.
“Oh, Dean.” Cas says, his tone suddenly flat.
He hadn’t meant to fall. Not like this.
Back to business as usual.
it won’t work,
“And whose fault is that?” Castiel answers, voice icy, unaware of how it makes Dean’s jaw clench. “After all, y
“Yeah, well, welcome to the club.” Cas says as an answer and steps around her to continue on his way, but she catches his arm with a hand, giving him pause.
Suddenly, anger and frustration make his body coil and in one swift motion he hurls the glass against the nearest wall. It shatters with a sound that isn’t nearly as satisfying as Dean hoped it would be.
In the end, it’s Cas who ends it. The former angel steps into Walter’s way before he can come for Dean again. Cas catches his wrist, only to turn it in an uncomfortably looking way.
They’re shaking. His vessel is reacting to the lack of narcotics in his system already. He can feel a headache coming on, but Cas knows it won’t last. He’s certain that his vessel is capable of dispelling a lot of the unwanted physical reactions within a few hours, even with his grace being as weak as it is. There is little man-made substances can do to an angel’s vessel if they’re not magically infused.
Cas walks past him to the kitchenette, slowly and silently. He grabs two glasses from next to the sink with one hand, before curling his other around the neck of the half finished bottle of whiskey that is standing on the counter. It’s one of the last at camp and doesn’t even taste all that good, but it does the trick when it’s needed. Cas returns to the table and pours both of them two fingers before he sets the bottle down on the table.
This is it.
“Still, it’s stupid,” he mumbles, guilt making his voice small.
“You heard me,” he says before looking around camp once more. “Go back to your usual posts. Keep watch according to your scheduled shifts. Everyone else: get some sleep.”
“Cas, that’s enough.” Dean says, with the finality of the leader he had to be for the better part of five years now. Cas’ mouth shuts immediately and with that they are back to silence. This obedience isn’t new, not by a long shot, and yet Dean never got used to it. He still vividly remembers being beaten up in an alleyway by a furious angel for even considering saying ‘yes’ to Michael. It feels like a lifetime ago. He hasn’t seen Cas get angry like this in years. Hell, other than apathetic sarcasm or fake bliss Cas just doesn’t do emotions anymore. It pisses Dean off beyond believe and at the same time it threatens to break something terrifyingly fragile inside of him.
Dean shifts where he is sitting and lets out a groan when he realizes the various memories of sex made him half hard. “Get a grip.” He tells himself in the dark and lowers himself backward onto the bed. His hand falls from his shoulder to his side and he blindly kicks his boots and socks off before he shuffles higher until his head can nestle on his pillow.
“Damn, must be tough being the only one at camp who hasn’t had a piece of whore ass--”
However, it’s not the physical symptoms he fears, it’s the clarity of his own mind and the abyss of silence in it.

It hurts, somewhere his grace cannot ease, that Dean could be Dean and yet.
“Jimmy, my—former vessel.” Eyes still closed, Dean just stares at the backs of his eyelids and wonders what in the world brought
“Dean,” Anna called—interrupting him, because shit person or not, they’d already gotten into this argument about hitting girls before and she wasn’t looking forward to doing it again. “Leave it, all right, you’re here for Cas.” She waited there for him pointedly as he stared, with eyes still narrowed into slits, up at the tree house, at a cross-legged Meg who gazed back blankly, disturbingly unrepentant.
Sam glances at Castiel and then watches Dean’s face, sees it change as does Castiel simultaneously. His eyes flick black once and then back, and he slides a glance toward Sam, clocking whatever that look he’s sending him means, before a pleasant enticement of an expression Castiel sees often drags itself slowly onto his features. His hair is sweaty and his shirt is ripped and he looks tired, but he comes to Castiel far more easily than a demon should to an angel,

“I should throw myself a party then, finally telling you to fuck off.”

They fell asleep like that, and from what she saw the next morning, when she left Ruby in her bed with a kiss to her wild, tangled hair and walked down to check on Cas, so had Dean and Castiel: Cas’s fluffy dark head pillowed on Dean’s arm where he was curled into a quotation toward his friend, Dean hanging halfway off Cas’s bed on one side, his pretty mouth lax and one foot sticking out of the covers, both of them still in their jeans (Jesus,

“Working on it, angel.” Dropping to Castiel’s jaw, he bites there, and Castiel has to force his grace down as his being unfurls with a sudden burst of feeling, but he stops Dean, regardless.
Castiel has been a lean-to for so long. A shelter for many, stone-sturdy and unmoved.
do that.” Castiel reached the door and Anna and Ruby dove toward the fridge, pulling it open just as he got inside. He took one look at them, sighed heavily, and stomped back into his room.
But, of course, Dean is quick on the uptake. He’s always been more clever, more insightful, more able to see a plan as it plays out, than he gives himself credit for. Castiel should know; a lot of his own insight has come from what Dean’s taught him.
That was the last Anna saw or heard of her for a month and longer. Cas went out with her and Ruby, with Jo, and with Charlie and Dorothy and Gilda, went out with Sam, with Dean, with Balthazar and Inias, with cousin Hannah even, despite the strained ties he’d had for a while with that whole family—her; her mom Naomi; her baby sister Hael; after they’d started something that had gone ugly fast with Dean once at a family reunion. He never once even

“Meg, I’m not going to—”
Castiel lifts Dean at the hips, so that those strong bowlegs automatically circle his waist and the walk to the bed is perhaps three steps at most. He presses down as they lie on the bed’s softness, touches the blanket beneath and cleans it for Dean’s comfort, rolls his lower body again and again until Dean’s eyes are squeezed shut, nearly pained, and he’s groaning, “Fuck,
Don’t call me that. It’s been a month—never really know when to stop pushing, do you. I’m unsurprised.”

Indeed. That is where the evening is likely headed. The mechanics are as yet unsure, but fucking will occur, and so will more “making out”—Castiel thinks, enormously satisfied by this accomplishment as he mouths over Dean’s bottom lip, eagerly, pushing them both into another kiss that lasts through the gasping breaths at grinding hips.
“But, Cas, you don’t…I’m a—” Dean almost never says the word. When he can, he surely likes to forget.

He has nothing to lose, here, and the one thing that means everything, to gain.

reason for Castiel to have been saying this. Even as Dean appears not to care, because he surely cares, too much. He and Dean have often had that in common.
How can he shelter anyone like this?

The guy Cas ended up with wouldn’t have been Dean, and they might not have even saved the world, because maybe that guy wouldn’t have known, what he had in Cas. Maybe that guy wouldn’t have forced his way into an angel’s heart and under its skin, the way Dean had. Maybe that guy wouldn’t have dragged Cas kicking and screaming, into being the best part of his life.

, when you had chosen otherwise.”
“Is this your way of telling me to scream your name more?” Dean asks, sharp, defending himself. Castiel smiles, fond of this walking horror with a hesitant heart.
Ruby welcomed her into her arms and closed them, strong and browned, around her. The comfort was undeniable, but then she heard muffled yelling, and sobbing, and the thunk of what was probably Cas collapsing onto his best friend in the world and knocking him into the door, and it just didn’t quite work as well as it should. She could hear a low rumble, like Dean was trying to ease Cas anyway, despite his own rage, and as much as she wanted to help—
Castiel’s answer is almost inaudible. “At first, thinking of your regard was odd, off-putting. The brothel, in Maine, was especially enlightening to me, but even then, I didn’t
“I just wanted to say, I’m glad you’re back,” he says, trying to rustle up a smile like Cas deserves. Cas deserves so much more than this, than him, but he ain’t letting go that easy.
, and he would know.
Dean trembles, barely noticeable except for Castiel feeling it through his fingers. He would read Dean’s mind, but he has promised not to, and honors that promise as much as he can. “Might be bad for you,” he warns, but Castiel remains undeterred. This
“A what? You aren’t serious. You know how I feel about that. Dating and, and sex, and—”
Shaking his head, Castiel does something unprecedented (Dean kids, he kids) and returns to the point. “But yes, that is the appropriate translation. I was fond of you, as I am of Sam now, as I’ve been of Anna, of Balthazar, even of M—” Dean makes a little disgusted noise and Castiel’s mouth twitches as he closes it with a snap.
“Hey, shut up, you cry yourself out all you want. I have a sister, I know the drill.”
“This is my way of saying I want your tongue in my mouth,” he says, clearly, making sure he is not misunderstood. Dean gasps a bit, and wonderfully, his breath does not repulse where it puffs onto Castiel’s lips.
I don't know when I'll continue this, so feel free not to read this part if you would rather wait and see if I do.
There is a sudden crunching sound and the next thing Dean knows is that Walter is stumbling backwards, shouting and bleeding from the nose, while Dean’s hand throbs with pain. A few surprised gasps ring out around them, but Dean barely hears them over the blood rushing in his ears when Walter suddenly comes at him with a roar of anger.
“Hey Cas, just making the rounds and asking if people need anything in particular from the next run.” Chuck says, barely looking up from his worn clipboard as he jots down some notes.
; has since the day he lost Sammy. But there are people looking to him for guidance, people who trust him to find a way to turn all of this around. But the truth is he doesn’t know what to do, either. He is as helpless as them. He is only slightly better at hiding it. And he tries, he tries to keep them safe, tries to lead them the best he can, because it’s the only thing he can do to make amends, because everything, all of this, ultimately is his fault.
Back then human emotions had still been new to the angel. Dean can’t imagine how it must have felt for him, but if there is one thing Dean can empathize with it’s feeling overwhelming anger. However, Castiel contained himself anyway, rained himself back in and locked it up before he could really hurt Dean and since then he’s never raised a hand against him again. Dean is almost envious of the fact that Cas managed in less than a year what Dean hasn't been able to achieve in thirty.
“Sorry.” Cas offers, and Dean shakes his head.
He can already feel his chest tightening with long-repressed emotions. He doesn’t want them. He is as afraid of them now as he was when he first begged Anna to help him understand, maybe even more so. His gaze falls to his palm again and he is closer than ever to giving in to the urge of swallowing the pills to fight down the darkness that creeps into his mind.
Dean glances at Cas, the former angel’s expression is as impassive as it always is when faced with a situation like this, but his eyes are bright and clear, and he gives no signs of backing down. Cas has dealt with archangel’s threatening him without flinching, Dean knows he won’t give an inch while faced with the likes of Walter. Still, Dean feels his own fury simmer in his gut at the condescension in Walter’s tone.
That has the other look up at him with surprise. He knows why. Dean doesn’t plead and he certainly doesn’t pray. Dean is relieved to find Cas not too far gone to realize that, even though his eyes are still dreadfully empty. Despite the small spark Dean thought he saw earlier, the blue rings of his irises are still almost completely drowned out by his blown pupils, no doubt courtesy of the most recent ‘hit’ Cas said he needed earlier.
“Yeah right,” he scoffs. “Is that why he was benched for months? A few weeks ago, chuckles here could barely hold his gun straight.”
Dean narrows his eyes at him as he is reminded why he doesn’t spend a lot of time in the other’s company anymore. The former angel’s behavior tends to drive him up the fucking walls these days.
A few years ago hearing Cas speak like this would have him shatter the tumbler against the nearest wall in a fit of anger, but that was back when Dean had still enough fight in him to actually get angry about Cas doing this to himself. Nowadays, Dean is mostly angry at himself for letting it come to this, but it’s not the flaring sort of anger, the one that comes in bursts and makes him break things. This one is deeper, darker and tied to something he can’t let himself name.
What does it matter anyway? It’s going to be over soon. All of it.
He can hear Cas breathe out in a small snort behind him. When Dean turns to give him a look Cas raises an eyebrow at him. The former angel doesn’t say anything, yet his expression clearly communicates how much of an understatement he thinks that is.
“That’s it isn’t it?” Walter laughs, completely ignoring Dean’s words.
Dean breathes out in a low sigh. “So, having an angel perched on your shoulder really isn’t something to pray for then, is it?” He asks with a hollow chuckle. He says it as a joke and means it more as a rhetorical question rather than an actual one. However, he is immediately reminded of that fact that Cas was never good at picking up on stuff like that.
“My last hit was hours ago. I need more.” He clicks his tongue. “My taste buds start to pick out individual molecules again. It’s... unpleasant,” he explains in an annoyed tone, and Dean’s expression falls, gaze turning hard once more before he drops it from the other’s face. He lets his thumb trace a small crack on the clear surface of his glass, turning it slightly in his hands, focus shifting to the swirling liquid inside.
The fight escalated after one of Dean’s more reckless maneuvers. It was a few days after they set up at Camp Chitaqua, just a few months after the Croatoan virus really took hold in North America. Dean doesn’t even really remember his half-baked plan from that day, which was probably courtesy of the concussion he suffered because of it. It was probably something stupid like an ambush on one of Lucifer’s minions gone awry, or a desperate attempt at getting the Colt back. Back then Dean still took everything too lightly because:
with letting Cas take a small squad to Bobby’s to pick up whatever they can on lorebooks from the late hunter’s house, but there is no one else he will trust to do it.
“Is that so?” Dean feels the sudden need to move. So, he walks back over to where his bag is sitting on the table. He begins unpacking, solely because he needs to give his hands something to do.
Cas just shrugs in response before he turns to another page in his own reading material. “Anna was always fond of humanity. She actively sought those out that could perceive her. She talked to them, eased their sorrows if she could.” The former angel looks up from his book, but he doesn’t seem focused on anything in the cabin. There is a distant look in Cas’ eyes, the one he gets when he thinks of events long past. “I remember her being particularly fond of a young woman in Ancient Rome. Lucia she was called. Anna healed her of her imminent blindness when they first met.”
at that and Dean’s immediate response is to tense up and glare at him, but then he realizes that Cas’ laugh is not forced, or mocking, it’s genuine. Dean is left stunned at that observation and just watches as Cas laugh ebbs until his expression comes to linger in a smile. It’s not a fake smile either, or one of the dazed ones Dean has grown so accustomed to. It’s small, yet uncontrolled and for the first time in years seems to reach his eyes. And then, just like that, it’s gone again and replaced by a cold chuckle that has the hairs on the back of Dean’s neck stand up.
But Dean has to believe the plan will work, if only for his own sanity. It has taken him years to get to this point, and it has cost all of them too much to have doubts about it now. Finally all of their sacrifices will pay off,
being lose his powers, and himself, piece by piece, watching him become a fallen angel, becoming
“And here I thought you were just being a dick.” Cas retords casually.
“Listen, I don’t want to fight. I’m asking for your help here.” When Cas still doesn’t look at him Dean inhales slowly before releasing the air in two words, both of them barely above a whisper, akin to a prayer. “Please, Cas.”
“Semantics,” Cas interrupts, his gaze still fixed on the book in his lap, eyes lazily scanning the pages.
Every syllable that falls from Cas’ mouth feels like it is hollowing Dean out. It’s not true. None of this is true. Dean should tell him that, but anger tightens his throat.
“See you on the other side, Cas,” Dean says when he hears the angel open the door, but can’t bring himself to turn his head to watch him go.
“Walter had it coming. From what I hear around camp he deserves worse.” Cas tells him. Dean doesn’t know what to do with that information. He isn’t one to listen to gossip, but he imagines Cas hears quite a lot of it when curled up with a bunch of girls in his cabin. Dean shakes the images along with the sour feeling they brought about when Cas speaks again.
“Dean? What are you doing?” It’s Chuck who speaks and Dean turns to look at him.
“If I have to read about the ‘glistening radiance’ of an angel’s true form on more time I’m gonna puke,” he groans and Cas gives him an offended look from across the table.
“I trust Cas,” he tells Walter, without thinking twice about it. It’s been a while since he could admit to that. It’s true, though. So, he just rolls with it. “You should, too.”
Dean meets his gaze with a raised eyebrow and makes a dismissive gesture with his hand. “Oh, stop pouting. It’s not like I was talking about you.”
“Can it, Walter. Decision’s made. Besides, Cas already led soldiers into battle when you were still busy living the apple pie life.”
out first, Dean.”
Cas, in fact, doesn’t stop pouting, but he does turn his attention back to his own book before saying: “You wouldn’t talk like that if you were actually able to perceive an angel’s true form.”
“What did I do this time?” Cas asks without moving.
Cas’ squad returns three hours behind schedule with what looks to be just about every lorebook they could find, a bag full of weapons and a number of weird looking ingredients that might proof useful if they have to do a spell of any kind. They also found Bobby’s hunters’ journal. They pulled from the hidden compartment over the fireplace, exactly where Dean told them it would be.
Nothing goes right anymore, so why would this?
“But he doesn’t have to tell you anything.  You always just
He shakes the coat a few times, watching it unfold before him. The action doesn’t get rid of the wrinkles in the fabric, but Cas still puts it on after. It’s odd how familiar the oversized piece of clothing feels, the worn fabric a weirdly comforting weight on his shoulders.
“Yeah...” he agrees, feeling his body loose tension in the same way it did before. Dean realizes this is the closest they have been in months, if not years. It surprises him how easy it is to return to this. How normal it feels to lean into Cas’ touch.
He looks like he knows what comes next, too.
Dean feels his jaw working “Okay, Walt. About time for you to shut up.” Dean says cooly, aware of the fact that showing any sort of reaction beyond that will just give Walter more reason to sprout bullshit. Dean’s shoulders are still set, but he somehow manages to keep his fists from clenching, even though the need to rearrange Walter’s face grows stronger with every passing second.
Sometimes, this side of Cas bleeds through in their conversations. As much as the years made the former angel apathetic, they also made him cruel and Dean will never admit it, but Cas is the only one around who can still get to him with as little as a single sentence. Maybe that’s why he casts his eyes down when he does, unable to look at the drug hazed gaze staring back at him.
They can’t take much more. They might outlast another attack like that, two if they’re lucky. They fortified their defenses after another small group of survivors joined them a few weeks back, but the people are weary and every day it becomes clearer that there is an expiration date on their survival.
It reminds Dean of the fact that before all of this, Cas was a warrior of Heaven and a strategist with literal eons of experience. Dean is torn between a weird sense of pride for his friend’s abilities and the nagging guilt about how he shouldn’t have to be reminded of Cas’ skills in the first place. He tells himself it’s not his fault. It’s just hard to see Cas as anything other than the image he created for himself over the past few years.
Chuck opens and closes his mouth a few times like he wants to say something else, but then he nods and Dean drops his hand from his shoulder to walk past him.
He gathers up his bloody clothes and leaves, not daring to look back at Cas as he makes his way to the door, afraid of what he might see.
Dean’s lips part at that briefly and he glances at Cas again, before he inhales and then exhales in a sigh. He probably shouldn’t be surprised that Cas knew. “Yeah, well... Turns out I still have some fight left in me.”
His breath is shaky as he inhales and exhales deeply to calm himself before raising his voice and adressing the people around him. “Forget moving out!” He shouts, loud enough that everyone around the campsite hears him. “Plan’s changed.”
His shoulders drop. It all comes down to this, doesn’t it? Other people paying for his mistakes, over and over. He abandoned Sam, believed it would keep Michael and Lucifer from destroying the world in their grand battle, but leaving Sam led to him saying yes to Lucifer and that led them here. For years he’s been fighting with a handful of survivors, barely scraping by, himself holding on by a thread to not drown in his anger and grief while the people around him keep dying on a daily basis.
Dean stares. The pain in his arm is pushed to the backburner as he takes in the former angel’s face. Cas looks downright terrifying. His expression is dark. His jaw is set and his eyes burn with intensity so bright Dean is almost convinced he can see his grace flare in them for a second.
“Okay.” He says and turns to leave. Cas follows him out onto the porch and leans over the ballustrade to watch him make his way across the yard. Cas almost regrets his decision when he consciously feels the last of the drugs from tonight leaving his system and is close to mourning his apathetic state of mind until he watches Chuck hand his list to Dean. Cas can’t help it, he watches the hunter closely as he goes through it.
“It’s been a while, since I last did this,” Cas says, apparently having thought similar thoughts.
He points at Cas, who raises his eyebrows at Dean in return. “Cas, I need to talk to you.” Then, Dean retrieves his bag and closes the door of the car with more force than necessary. He turns to start and make his way back to his cabin, only to have Chuck step in his way, stuttering, eyes wide.
There might be safety in numbers, but there is also higher demand for supplies. Chuck manages resources as tightly as he can, but they’ll run out sooner rather than later. The supply runs to the surrounding cities are already yielding next to nothing. So, they will be forced to move camp within the next week and moving the whole operation is always a risk, especially when they have no idea where to go for shelter.
“You knew, didn’t you.” It’s not a question.
Cas doesn’t seem to notice his discomfort as he pulls him over to the bed. Reluctantly, Dean sits on the edge and lets Cas begins to pull off his jacket and overshirt to get a better look at the wound.
He stands with a sudden start, meaning to give himself something to do by tidying up the glasses, or packing his bag, anything that might distract him from his thoughts. However, when he looks down at the glass in his hand, his eyes zero in on the crack in the surface again. He curls his fingers tighter around the tumbler, thumb still pressing to the fissure until he sees his hand begin to tremble with tension.
He needs another hit.
Apparently, Cas chooses to drown himself in all of this, because being a shitty human is easier than being a failed angel or something like that. At least that’s what he told Dean one night after a particularly heated argument on the matter. Dean grits his teeth at the memory, brows furrowing at the glass in his hand.
But whenever he reaches inside himself to tune into his powers he feels what can barely be described as a spark of grace, but what’s worse is the never-ending emptiness where he once could feel thousands of warm presences lingering just outside his consciousness. And if his own powerlessness wasn’t enough to get him to his knees, he easily crumbles under the cutting loneliness of his absent family.
Silence settles over them again, heavy and daunting. It feels like there are countless things Dean should say and an even greater number of things Cas needs to hear. Yet, he is certain nothing he says will fix whatever broke between them so long ago.
Dean sets his jaw but keeps his face carefully blank. He knows he’s beeing baited and he’s not going to bite. Although he can’t help the way his shoulders tense at the implications and the hostile tone in Walter’s voice.
and the distant familiarity of the expression tugs at Dean’s memories.
But alas, like supplies, rationality is not something they have in abundance either. Most of the people at camp are afraid of what is to come, rightfully so, but because they can’t handle their fear they channel it into anger, and this anger seems to be primarily directed at Dean.
“What happened to them?”
“Dean—”
Cas says from the doorway and Dean is equally surprised as he is not that the former angel walks into his cabin barely ten minutes after it happened. He isn’t surprised, because it’s
At first, Dean used to find solace in these moments, feeling oddly calm in Cas’ presence even after a mission gone awry. Only when Cas began to clean his wounds with gentle touches would the adrenaline slowly leave his body and Dean could let himself give in to the exhaustion that seeped into his bones. He would allow himself to wince and groan at the pain he felt when no one but Cas was around and sometimes he would even allow himself to revel in the feeling of ‘safe’ that he associated so strongly with the angel.
“One might end in tragedy.”
Dean tries to sidestep out of the way as best he can, but on the next slash he’s too slow to move and there is a sharp pain in Dean’s left arm. He gasps. His right hand comes up instinctively to clutch at the cut on his biceps and he feels warm liquid seep through torn fabric and onto his fingers.
“Shit...” Dean mumbles as the sharp pain in his arm finally becomes too much to ignore. He looks down at where blood is currently coloring the sleeve of his jacket and raises his hand to inspect the damage.
, and Cas knows him, far better than Dean is comfortable with at times. Cas knows that no matter how often something like this needs to be done, and no matter how clinical Dean seems to go about it these days, it doesn’t get easier, not for Dean. It’s perhaps the only thing that hasn’t changed in this godforsaken world.
Dean knows this, has known from the moment that demon they captured cracked under his torture having lasted
The former angel makes a small sound in return.
Cas releases a breath and opens his eyes. They catch on something familiar protruding from the open drawer. Bunched up beneath several shirts and two pairs of trousers, all of them hand-me-downs from either Dean or Bobby, his eyes come to linger on Jimmy’s— no his old trenchcoat. On a whim he abandons the pills and pulls the tan piece of clothing out of the drawer. His eyes roam across the fabric and a sense of nostalgia overcomes him.
surprised, however, that Cas pulled himself out of his loop of drug induced stupor and mindless sex long enough to actually
As long as he’s breathing he can still keep fighting.
Dean flinches at the memory and raises a hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. He feels old frustration tensing up his shoulders and neck, the beginnings of a headache pulsing at the corners of his eyes. His teeth clench. It’s not like he had a choice, right? Besides, Cas didn’t want his help. They fought about all of this so often Dean lost count and it had taken so much out of him that at one point he just stopped trying to reason with the former angel. Cas had been selfdestructing at a rate Dean couldn’t stop and he certainly couldn’t focus his attention on one member of his team while everyone else was looking to him for guidance. Even if that member was Cas. He simply couldn’t fight another losing battle. So, Dean stopped trying and just watched from afar, holding Cas at arm’s length while the other made his choices. Dean watched Cas fall apart, and it hurt, but as long as the former angel was sober enough to not get himself killed on a mission that was enough for Dean.
hits him again, even harder than before.
Then, out of the blue, Cas asks. “What am I to you, Dean?”
It’s one hell of an olive branch.
“For defending my honor?” Cas asks with a chuckle and Dean frowns.
Dean clears his throat as the question lodges almost painfully inside of it. He suddenly realizes that he doesn’t want to know the answer. “I think I’ll call it a day,” he says instead.
He can’t.
It’s with a stab of pain in his chest that Dean realizes that that is probably the whole point of Cas’ facade.
This took a while, but it's also a little longer. Let me know what you think!
All the fight leaves his body and he sets his jaw again.
There is no comfort in the fact that sober he can still perceive his surroundings in as much detail as he pleases, that he can easily focus on a bird flapping its wings half a mile away if he so chooses, or that he can still conjure up a perfectly accurate image of how the cells of a body need to be arranged in order to heal it from a fatal wound. It doesn't matter that he can still do all that, because without his angelic strength, speed or the ability to heal he can't utilize such information. There is simply no need for him to be aware of anything, really. Being aware just means feeling useless on top of everything else and these days he mostly just longs for a way to dull the pain he feels about the state of the world he helped bring about.
“Dean?” He hears the familiar gravel of Cas’ voice and he turns to face him. Their eyes meet and Dean’s gaze wavers as he looks at the former angel. Cas’ brows furrow slightly in return, his eyes narrow at Dean, but there is a sudden small spark of curiosity in them and his head tilts ever so slightly to the side. His brows furrow like he doesn’t understand, like Dean’s behavior is puzzling to him for the first time in years. Cas’ expression is a sudden unexpected echo of the way he looked at him
The angel’s eyes widen at whatever he sees in Dean’s gaze then and for once they do not immediately cloud over again. It’s the first time in forever that Dean doesn’t feel his heart sink when he looks at Cas and he finds himself thinking:
realized just how dire their situation really was. They argued, loudly, and for a long time until Castiel finally caved, body shivering, blue eyes wide and hurt and looking so goddamn
Castiel could have ended him in that alley; at the time Dean was almost convinced that he would. It wasn't until much later, years later, that Dean realized that even overwhelmed with anger the angel had still pulled his punches.
“No, Dean. There is only one way this ends and you know it.”
The motion causes unwanted friction against his cock via the fabric of his pants and he clenches his teeth against the urge to reach down to unbutton his jeans, curling his fingers tightly into the sheets. He stays like that far longer than he cares to admit.
“When my garrison was assigned with the task of rescuing you, I stepped forward to be the one to pull you out.”
Dean holds his gaze, feeling cold. There are probably a few hundred things he should say to Cas in order to make this conversation stop going around in circles, but Dean can’t find the words. “Damnit, Cas...” is what he settles for in the end, but immediately trails off again, finding that his tone is far too wounded and raw. He decides the sentence is going nowhere anyway and then reaches up to run a hand over his face in frustration.
Once.
“Anna?” Dean asks, eyes growing wide before his gaze flicks back down onto the page in front of him, suddenly seeing the text in a whole new light.
“She was the angel you slept with way back when,” Cas supplies without looking up.
Movement catches his eye off to the side and he turns his head slightly, eyes falling on Cas who is talking with a woman over by his truck. She is one of the most recent survivors who joined them he thinks. Dean doesn’t recall her name, but it doesn’t matter, not to him anyway, after tonight nothing matters anymore.
He can tell she is more than just pissed by the way her voice bites out at him. “What’s going on? He shoots Yaeger and then goes and hides in his cabin, leaving me and the others to deal with the body? That’s cold, even for him.”
Without the memory to go with the scar it’s easy to forget the mark is there sometimes, of everything Cas did for him even before he knew who Dean was as a person. The initially angry red print has faded to be less vibrant, but the outline of the hand is still a stark contrast against the rest of his skin.
“When all of this started some of the other angels called me your pet.”Cas gaze is sharp as a knife. His words laced with simmering fury. “But I was merely a weapon, wasn’t I? Another loaded gun at your disposal and as soon as I stopped being that, I stopped being important.”
It’s getting colder Cas notices when he leaves Dean’s cabin for the second time that day and he takes a moment to marvel at the fact that he even notices at all. Day by day the temperatures fall further and people at camp will soon begin to brace themselves for the upcoming coldest season of the year. Cas doesn’t need to, since he doesn’t perceive temperature in the same way humans do, even with his grace as depleted as it is.
“What happened?”
There is another long stretch of silence between them until Dean finds his words again. He turns
Dean doesn’t bother denying it, doesn’t feel like lying to Cas’ face right now. So, he doesn’t say anything and for a while nothing else is said between them and the only noise in the cabin is that of Dean methodically cleaning out his bag.
He feels terrifyingly empty after what he said to Dean just now. The hunter came to him for reassurance and to ask for help and Cas shot him down so thoroughly it made his own chest ache. For the longest time he thought Dean just saw him as dead weight. Dean hadn’t even been able to look at him after Cas first confessed that his powers were fading, so he had quickly grown accustomed to the sting that came with feeing useless.
Dean watches Cas let his head fall back against the backrest of the chair to look up at the ceiling. “I need a drink,” he says in a tone that sounds more like the words are born of habit than genuine need.
“Don’t you think I would have said something if I knew of another way?”
That alone is enough to make Walter completely loose any sort of sense.
He pulls himself up from the bed and away from Cas, ignoring the way his skin seems to still resonate with the other’s touch even when the weight of it is gone from his shoulder. Dean hates how much he wants his touch there, how much he wants to just let himself be soothed by Cas’ presence.
They sit in silence for while and he hears Cas sip on his drink a few times. Dean doesn’t have to look up to know that Cas is furrowing his brows at the taste. The former angel shifts in his seat, and out of the corners of his eyes Dean can see one foot restlessly twitching where Cas’ legs rest on the table, crossed at the ankles.
“Right behind you, fearless leader.”
Dean slams his hands down on the table, patience already wearing thin. “Then what are you doing here?” He growls. Anyone else would have flinched back and left the cabin in a hurry at his tone, but not Cas. His answering look is distant, almost empty, and Dean ignores how his chest tightens in return.
“So, what you let him fuck you and you get to boss everyone else around?”
“Come on. We have work to do.”
Dean purses his lips as the former angel says his name. “Yeah, you did.” He bites out. What he thought he saw back in the yard earlier, that small spark in Cas’ eyes, it had been his mind playing tricks on him after all. He longs for the anger from before, but Cas’ words cut deeper than Dean imagined and it’s not just anger that twists painfully inside of him now.
Cas doesn’t respond to his words right away, which has the hunter look back up at him. He can see the tension in Cas’ shoulders and the sadness in his eyes when he speaks next, only briefly looking up at Dean before dropping his gaze back to the book in his lap.
A hand touches his shoulder again, settling lightly where Cas’ mark is edged into his skin beneath the worn fabric of his shirt. Somehow, it startles Dean how warm his touch is, even though he just had his fingers on his bare skin a few minutes ago.
“As I said, Anna was ... fond of humanity.” He gives the hunter a pointed look. Dean makes a noncommital sound in return and for a while that is all that is said on the matter.
He spits into the sink and scrunches up his face at the small amount of blood mingling with the foamy residue. Then, he rinses his mouth and splashes some water on his face before he meets his own gaze in the mirror. Tired eyes look back at him like they always do, but he can’t help but feel like something has changed within him. He runs a hand over his face and straightens his back.
It didn’t take long for Dean to remove himself from these situations after the realization hit him. They had drifted even further apart after that. Dean decided to tend to his wounds on his own from then on, meaning to spare Cas yet another painful reminder of what he lost because of his decision to follow Dean...
?” And just like that, all the fight leaves Dean’s bones and his eyes widen slightly before he casts them down, staring at the dirty flooring beneath his feet.
Then, Dean looks at Chuck.
As they step through the beaded curtain the scent of something heavy and sweet hits his nose. Some sort of frankincense, he thinks, although he has no clue where the former angel possibly could have gotten it. It’s the same scent that clings to Cas hair and skin after one of his orgies, always potent enough that Dean can smell it even sitting at the other end of the table in the briefing room. Dean immediately scrunches up his face at the thought.
“No, you don’t. I need you sober.”
“You don’t want to know.”
Weirdly enough the times where he is most often made aware of the mark is during sex. The eyes of a lot of women stray to the handprint when Dean pulls his shirt over his head. He usually sees them rake their gaze across his chest and abdomen first, their eyes might linger on the tattoo, but their attention always catches on the handprint on his shoulder. Sometimes he’s asked about it, sometimes he’s not. Often enough he cracks a joke, but he never tells the real story. But silently he always thinks of Cas when the handprint comes up and then he has to chase the thought of the former angel out of his mind before losing himself in whoever he has beneath him at the time.
“I heard you shot Yaeger,”
Dean freezes.
Cas can feel the eyes of some of the guards on him when he makes his way across the yard. He holds up a hand to them in greeting, which makes them nod at him and move on. Cas continues on his way too, but instead of walking straight into his cabin he sits down on the porch and looks up at the stars.
However, it didn’t take long for Dean to realize that Cas was hurting every time he did this for him. Dean could see it in the way his jaw set and his brow furrowed. He could hear it in his tone of voice when he spoke. It was clear Cas felt helpless every time he had to this instead of simply laying two fingers to his forehead and easing the pain with his powers.
After all, what is one more thing broken by his hands?
“Y-you can’t just call this off.” He says, voice high and panicked.
He is left to watch with disdain where the residue of whiskey makes its way down the wooden wall, darkening the surface with moisture, akin to blood trickling from a wound.
“Chuck!” Dean cuts in and puts a hand on the man’s shoulder when Chuck looks at him like he’s about to cry. “I know, okay? But something seems fishy here. I need time to think of another plan, because I have a feeling the one I have won’t work.”
They enter the cabin and Dean walks to the table to unceremoniously drop his bag onto it. His eyes fall to the Colt and he has to fight down the feeling of doubt that is nagging at him. There is nothing he can do, though. He won’t change his mind about the mission again.
Dean learned that day that Cas is the last angel left on earth besides Lucifer, and next to the soaring light of the Morning Star, Castiel’s own was flickering. And just like that, Dean’s mind went blank. It had hit him then with painful blinding clarity: This was not just another fight he could win by being stubborn or by brute-forcing his way through.
Dean lets his gaze trace along the letters on the page then. Even though their last encounter with Anna wasn’t anywhere near pleasant he can’t help but wonder about her for a moment. He never knew her, not really and he never really thought about it at the time, didn’t let himself inspect that fact too closely, but just like Cas she was an angel once and she loved humanity enough to want to be one of them.
He knows the ‘plan’ is suicidal at best, Cas let him know as much during the briefing, but he has to try. He has to end this, once and for all. It either ends with him or Sam dying. He knows that now and a part of him wonders if he somehow always knew. Being completely honest with himself, which...
Then, the former angel closes his book and rises from his chair. For a moment Dean thinks Cas is going to leave, but he just walks past Dean to pick up one of the other lore books from the stack before he settles back in his chair.
It all comes to a head when one of said men disagrees with Dean’s choice of team leader for a mission.
his head to look at Cas.
None of Cas’ people have any injuries when they return, even though they are talking about a particularly nasty run-in with a group of Croats while unloading the trucks. Dean has to fight the urge to go and check on the former angel immediately and instead makes himself purposefully scarce.
“Our superiors found out.”
He didn't realize it at the time, but he still found comfort in his siblings simply beeing there, even when they resented him for his actions and his choices. But now that they are gone, Cas finds he doesn't enjoy being aware of things anymore, especially the loneliness he feels. There are few upsides to being aware if the only things to be aware off are pain and suffering, his own and that of others, Dean’s especially.
What makes it worse is that only a few hours ago, Dean saw a glimpse of the old Castiel shining through this facade. He wishes now that he had said something, anything, to Cas in that moment, even though he can’t even imagine what that would have been. It’s not like he can fix what broke between them. Hell, he isn’t even sure what that was in the first place.
It doesn’t helpt that this is his fifth attempt at getting through the tangle of flowery prose of this paragraph. The well-worn book on angel mythology might have valuable information in it, but the way it is written has him wishing he could go back in time solely to punch the author in the face.
“We got ambushed on the way back, one of the Croats got to him—”
“Not for nothing, Dean, but the last person who looked at me like that— I got laid.” Cas even winks at him after that statement and something twists painfully inside Dean’s stomach. It’s not a real coming on. He knows Cas well enough to know that the words are some kind of twisted joke, probably a play on something Dean said at some point in the past and the angel is now using against him. It’s in his eyes, something challenging, daring him to remember, but Dean doesn’t. He doesn’t even want to try, knowing it would hurt more than it has any right to. It makes him painfully aware of the fact that Cas doesn’t forget things and he doesn’t dare to think about how the angel most likely remembers every harsh word and act Dean ever subjected him to.
“How come the stoner gets to call all the shots these days?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He looks back at Dean.
This time when Dean flinches it’s not about the pain.
Sure, Cas and him are trying their best to come up with something, spending evenings with their noses buried in dusty old books, but so far they found no answers to the question of how to kill the devil. They need more time, but as with everything, time is in finite supply.
Cas watches her cross her arms in front of her chest and he tilts his head at her. “You’re upset,” he observes.
Dean is still too rattled to even consider disobeying as Cas curls a hand around his wrist and pulls him along. He lets himself be tugged past the entirety of the camp’s population and to Cas’ cabin.
Dean’s mouth opens slightly, but no words form in response. Sometimes, very rarely, it’s like this when they’re alone and Cas isn’t drugged out of his mind for once. Sometimes, the angel lets the giggly mask crumble away in Dean’s presence and allows him to see what’s left of the angel beneath. Dean still doesn’t know if he is grateful for that, or if he resents it when that happens. It makes Cas look more like the angel he knew and less like the human he has become, but seeing that glimpse of his former presence somehow hurts more than seeing him as entirely corrupted and beyond rehabilitation.
Dean dodges the swings and uncoordinated punches Walter throws, but loses his footing for a moment on uneven ground as he is forced to step back. The other man hits him in the face with enough force to make Dean dizzy, but he’s been in enough bar fights to be able to push through it and make a quick recovery. He can taste blood in his mouth, but throws another punch anyway. He catches Walter in the jaw and Dean watches with satisfaction as blood flies from the man’s mouth.
“Trust? That’s what this is? Seems more like you’re playing favourites,” he spats.
1) He thought he would die trying to kill the devil
the appropriate amount of time. Dean only wants to go through with this
Walter is known for his lack of self control. It doesn’t even surprise Dean when he pulls out a knife.
Frankly, that voice sounds a lot like Sam
Cas' anger is always oddly silent and simmering, not outright violent. He never explodes like Dean did when he punched Walter in the face. He doesn't throw or destroy things when pushed too far. He doesn't shout, barely even raises his voice unless someone seriously pisses him off, and even laced with anger his voice tends to go quieter rather than louder. It’s almost as if Castiel deliberately lowers his voice when overcome by anger.
“It’s fine,” he says, words clipped through gritted teeth.
So, Dean finds himself pursing his lips and averting his eyes when Cas refuses to. He goes back to rummaging around in his bag, mentally taking stock of ammunition and the state of his weapons, mostly to give himself something to do other than think about the addition of Yaeger’s blood on his hands.
“You seem... different than a few hours ago.”
Dean grits his teeth. From the corner of his eyes he can see Cas take a step closer, but the former angel remains quiet even as the entire camp seems to gather closer. Some of them are mumbling in what seems like agreement now, which quickly becomes a steadily rising buzzing noise in Dean’s ears.
“It’s not too deep, but you will still need stitches.” Cas tells him with a steady voice, even though his eyes are still stormy like before.
“Don’t play stupid. Everybody knows Cassie here keeps leaving your cabin late at night these days.”
“What am I here for then?”
. Cas seems more awake than he did when they first entered the cabin a few minutes ago. His gaze, while clearer, somehow also seems darker. Broken, Dean realizes. His chest tightens at the realization.
“You don’t have to explain yourself to me, Dean.”
There is also the fact that people tend to pick up on it when he does tap into his grace. Although, they don’t know what exactly he is doing per se. Cas is fairly certain not even Dean and Chuck know what it is that changes in him then, other than the fact that he is sober for once. However, everyone agrees Cas is significantly different on those days and not just because he won’t let anyone touch him then.
Dean falls silent, which he knows speaks volumes to Cas anyway. However, the former angel doesn’t gloat. If anything Dean thinks he sees his shoulders slump in defeat before Cas walks over to the table as well.
After Cas leaves, Dean turns off the ceiling light and eventually finds himself sitting down bonelessly on the edge of his bed, hanging his head in frustration as their conversation replays in his head. The memory of Cas’ expression is still clear in his mind, the hurt, the pain, the resignation.
However, Cas lets him go once Walter stops struggling, but his demeanor doesn’t change even as he steps back. The angelic presence still emanates from him as Walter scrambles to his feet. He doesn’t dare to look at either of them and soon enough he and his friends scramble off to wherever to tend to the man’s wounds.
The man that steps forward, Walter, was once part of Yaeger’s posse and ever since Dean shot Yaeger the little band of misfits wound tighter around Walter and started to question Dean’s every move.
, in a way he’s almost relieved it is here.
“If you ever touch him again I will kill you.”
“I thought so, too,” he admits and there is so much emotion in those words that Dean finds himself swallowing thickly, feeling like there is a lot more to this story than the former angel lets on.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“I had a quick look at that book earlier. I believe the angel the author is talking about was Anna.”
The angels were gone.
“So, if the Colt is out, what is the plan?”
“Nothing. That’s the point. It’s as if you—”
“Would you have listened?”
Dean rubs his free hand over his face and sighs, admitting defeat. He doesn’t even want to fight, it just comes naturally these days. He clinks their glasses together, briefly meeting the former angel’s eyes again. “To Yaeger...” he echoes, voice hollow, before knocking the drink back without hesitation. The burn of the whiskey doesn’t ease the tight feeling that’s lingered in his throat since Yaeger’s body slumped to the ground in front of him, but it gives him something else to think about for a few seconds. He pours himself another drink before he sits down opposite of Cas and his gaze falls to the worn surface of the table.
He presses his lips together for a moment and looks up into the night sky. He sees thousands of stars looking down at him in return, beautiful and silent. He doesn’t know what he is looking for, doesn’t know why he is even looking in the first place. His rational side is already arguing that he should just get on with the plan he has and let things end with a bang, but there is this small part of him that wants to hold on to the last straw, that wants to keep fighting, to keep looking, to keep
“Damn it!” He exclaims, the anger from earlier returning full force.
He’s learned long ago that Cas’ drug usage is less about the high it gives him and more about dulling what is left of his angel senses. He lost all of his mojo a long time ago and yet he still doesn’t really need to sleep, or eat, or drink. He also doesn’t have to have sex, Dean thinks bitterly and finds himself down his drink to chase the thought away.
“Keep pressure on that,” he orders. “Come with me.”
“I suggest the next time you question my leadership you take it up with me directly.”
things are falling into place. Just like that their luck turned and it feels like they can see the light at the end of the tunnel—
It’s too much to say he feels
“That, too. But that’s not what I meant.” Cas fastens the bandage and lets his hand drop from Dean’s arm as he leans back.
Walter, looks between them again.
It takes a long while before either of them speaks again and Dean tries to not be unnerved by the way Cas is studying him now. It’s weird how familiar it feels even though it’s been quite a while since he was subjected to the former angel’s scrutiny.
People know that when his gaze is sharper than usual, his blue eyes almost glowing, that the only thing they will get from coming near him is a sharp glare and a sudden sense of a lingering thunderstorm creeping up on them with lightning ready to strike at any moment.
“What? For choosing me and Sam over them? Yeah, understatement.” Dean aims for a light tone and fails miserably. Instead, his voice falls somewhere between defeated and ashamed.
His words were said in frustration. They were said as if Cas blamed the hunter for what happened to him, which he doesn’t. It would be easy to do it, but it’s not Dean’s fault that Cas fell. It’s a decision he made on his own, although he is certain that even knowing this won’t keep the hunter from shouldering the guilt for the way it ultimately turned out.
Cas knows the focus of this particular mission are toiletries and medical supplies since Chuck has been going on about that for a while now, but for the first time in forever Cas doesn’t plan on putting in a request for narcotics of any kind.
“Hey, I’m talking to you,” Walter says, louder this time, no doubt trying to attract attention from the other people around and sure enough Dean feels several sets of eyes on them a moment later. He shuts the tailgate and gives Walter a steady look, which the man meets it stubbornly.
“Cas?” He hears Risa say and stops just as he is about to enter his cabin through the bead curtain. He turns, looking at her from above now.
“I don’t know, Cas, half of the time you are blitzed out of your mind. So, excuse me if I question your judgement as of late.” The words come out a lot harsher than he intended, everything does when Dean talks to Cas for some reason.
“My point is that you’re making some questionable decisions lately and me and the others are kinda done risking our lives for the resident hippie just because you have a new favourite pet.”
He feels crushed under this weight every goddamn day of his life and he wants to give in, wants to crash and crumble and
“Glad to know you’re still high.” Dean scoffs, gaze averting and boring into the opposite wall, frustration level rising.
‘Please, Cas.’
If Cas notices the shift in Dean’s attitude, he doesn’t comment on it. He never does. Instead, he sighs heavily, but begins to move almost immediately after hearing Dean speak. “Alright,” he says and puts his own glass down next to the bottle, not meeting Dean’s gaze once during his process of getting up.
Dean’s thoughts are still too jumbled to not wonder when Cas last disrobed someone right here on the edge of this bed and the thought does nothing too cool Dean’s anger. He clenches his teeth against the pain as he forces Cas hands away and pulls his clothes off with more force than necessary, which leaves him only with the dark grey t-shirt he wore beneath. He throws the clothing down onto the floor with the next wave of anger and hisses as the motion strains the wound.
Dean blows an unsteady breath out through his nose as the former angel wraps the cut in a bandage.
“Seriously.”
Dean nods, pressing his lips together, tasting the remainder of whiskey on them.
“There is a difference between being guarded by an angel and being loved by one,” Cas says matter of factly and Dean can’t help the way he tenses at the word ‘love’ falling from Cas’ lips as nonchalantly as it does.
“I thought you might want it.”
“They were close.” Dean observes.
Cas pauses for a moment and nods. “I’ll leave,” he says and reaches up to mark the page he is on by folding down a corner. He closes the book and rises from his chair before tugging the book beneath one arm, clearly intent on taking it with him. Only then do his eyes come up to meet Dean’s.
Cas’ stare is long and unblinking. That much hasn’t changed. But his eyes have. The bright blue they once held a thing of the past. Now, they’re dull and unfocused, pupils blown wide most of the time with whatever shit he puts into his body nowadays. Even after years of familiarizing himself with that expression it still hurts to see the former angel like this. It constantly reminds Dean of how he failed him, how he failed everyone.
However, he still feels the need to fill the silence that creeps up on him with every barely audible step Cas takes toward him.
There is a rumble of voices going around camp after his announcement. Some voices he hears sound disapproving, others just flat out confused. He hears hasty footsteps drawing closer.
“Try to think of something, anything, that could help us kill Lucifer.”
The silence between them has grown cold and Cas suddenly feels a lot farther away than the span of the table between them. Dean returns his attention to the matter at hand, aiming for a conversational tone as he speaks.
good to be true.
would come.
Dean finds himself smiling involuntarily as he recalls the easy back and forth between them from way back when, Cas scolding him for being reckless and Dean insisting whatever injury he suffered was barely a scratch. Cas would give him a look somewhere between pleading and irritated and Dean would sigh and let himself be weak for just a moment.
It doesn’t matter. The fact remains that when he awoke days later back at camp, a gaping wound in his side and a furious angel hovering nearby, he
“That was harsh,” Cas says, voice pointedly aloof and Dean feels close to snapping.
it will be the death of him and everyone that comes with him.
Cas doesn’t say anything in return. He just leans closer to inspect the cut. He prods at the wound for a moment before the lines of worry on his forehead ease at least somewhat.
But no one answered.
Dean opens the door on the passenger’s side and throws the bag with his weapons onto the seat. He looks down at the arsenal of weapons. Despite the sheer amount of things he knows it’s not enough. It will never be enough. He wishes it was different, but he knows, he has always known that it wouldn’t be enough, no matter when the day he finally faced Sam—
This feels wrong.
The point is: he has longed for this, waited for it, because Dean is tired. So tired, of everything, the guilt, the grief, the responsibilities, the way people look at him like he can somehow make this right, and the way Cas looks at him like he knows
Dean’s brows furrow as he studies the side of Cas’ face at the cryptic words. It feels like there is another part to that statement that Cas won’t reveal unprompted. “And the other?” Dean asks and the angel turns his head and fixes Dean with bright blue eyes. The unfamiliar intensity in them catches the hunter off guard.
He scrunches his eyes shut as the plea echoes in his mind. He curls his fingers around the pills, so tightly he feels them grate against each other in his palm. Something flares in his chest with the memory. A sense of hope tingles within him again. Things have changed. Dean changed, although Cas doesn’t know why. The hunter seemed dead-set on dying less than a day ago and yet somehow Dean wants to keep fighting and the worst part of it is: Cas thinks he wants to, too.
On other days Dean might have found a woman to pass the time with, to get lost in, but he’s strung too tight to even consider putting on his charm. He goes hunting instead. He kills a deer, which he brings home for dinner and it seems to appease the people he yelled at enough to let his earlier temper tantrum go.
Cas didn’t mean to hurt Dean with his words. He never means to hurt him, but whatever he does it always seems to work out that way. Somehow Dean is always worse off when Cas decides to get involved. It’s always something he says, or doesn’t say. Something he can’t understand because he’s not human, or something he can’t fix because he is not as much of an angel as Dean needs him to be at any given moment. Cas didn’t mean to become so broken that Dean feels the need to shut him out in the first place. Castiel was meant to be a warrior, a guardian, not another burden for Dean to bear.
More people try to intervene, but they all jump back when Walter waves the knife at them, too.
, he thinks with sudden clarity, and realizes that he isn’t thinking this for the first time either.
Cas follows his orders as he always does and once again Dean catches himself wishing he didn’t. He can’t even bring himself to watch the other leave. His anger doesn’t keep his shoulders from slumping when he hears the door click shut. It doesn’t keep his mind from replaying Cas’ words inside his head. If this conversation showed him anything it’s that the former angel really lost all hope.
Dean holds his eyes for a moment, his own narrowing and shoulders tensing. He is used to having to stare people down at this point. It doesn’t happen often, but people do challenge his orders occasionally. He never falters when it is anyone else, but again:
“Fucking asshole,” he curses again.
?” The angel asks in return, words sounding almost genuinely curious, if it wasn’t for them dripping with sarcasm. Dean hates this. He never wanted this to happen to Cas. Cas is the only person he has left from his old life, seeing him like this
“For putting this on you.” Dean relents. “You shouldn’t have to deal with people like Walter.” He nods in the direction of his arm. “Or this for that matter.”
“What are you to him?” She asks and Cas finds himself thinking for a moment.
They have to come up with a plan for when they’ll inevitably be forced to move. So, Cas is supposed to take a small team out for recon, to find the most secure route for travel. Dean will stay at camp to go over their stock of food and gas with Chuck and supervise maintenance on the remaining vehicles in preparation for the move even if they don’t know where to go yet. If push comes to shove they'll have to just make it up as they go and hope for the best.
He needed help.
It’s been a long time since Dean last saw this side of Cas. This isn’t Cas the resident addict and love guru. This is Castiel the angel. His powers might be gone, but apparently his angelic fury is still there.
These thoughts are still on his mind when Cas finally walks up to him after dinner. For a moment he wonders if Cas noticed the looks Dean gave him throughout the meal. Dean realized that Cas wasn’t eating or drinking at all a while back and he isn’t sure if that is a good or a bad sign. But Cas doesn’t say anything about that, just pulls Dean aside and away from prying eyes before he hands him a small steel flask with leather hull. To anyone else there would be nothing special about it, but to Dean it means everything.
Dean’s breath catches in his throat. It’s not an empty threat, either. Cas looks and sounds like he is about ready to rip Walter apart right here in the yard with everone watching.
Moments like this used to be quite common back when this whole mess started. When Cas first lost his powers he was still determined to make himself useful and more often than not Dean found himself sitting next to the angel after a rough mission, Cas tending to his wounds in the traditional way, the human way.
Dean doesn’t have to explain anything about the mission to Cas and there are no questions asked about why Dean won’t come with. The former angel knows there is no chance in hell Dean is ever going back to that house. Cas was there on the day Dean was forced to put a bullet in Bobby’s head and chest after he got infected and he knows Dean never looked back after that.
simply because he chose to follow Dean, because he believed in him instead of
It’s Risa that stops him next and Dean is just about done with people questioning him. “What the hell, Dean?” She asks, and he immediately hates the way she’s looking at him. He knows she’s still pissed about him being with Jane last night, which is exactly the reason he did go to her in the first place. He noticed Risa was getting attached to him, so he had to hurt her to keep her away. It will be easier for her in the long run. She doesn’t want him. Not really. She just thinks she does.
Walter’s expression splits into a cruel grin, emboldened by the attention of everyone around them. He turns towards Cas and Dean has to fight the urge to step into his line of sight to shield the former angel from the man.
“Brainstorming.”
Dean doesn’t expect the answer to cut as deeply as it does.
“I doubt that.”
Dean’s gaze strays from his bag to the camp around him. He watches for a moment as the few remaining survivors finish packing. He sees some of them saying goodbye to their loved ones, to those that will stay behind, children mostly. Dean’s jaw tightens.
He doesn’t deserve this.
He isn’t quite there yet, though.
It’s when he takes the last step off the wooden stairs and onto muddy ground that he hears a dull sound of glass shattering from inside the cabin. Cas turns his face towards the grey sky above, sighing in defeat. He knows the man is hurting and he wishes he could ease Dean’s pain. The years have not changed the yearning he feels to do so. But he couldn’t do so back when he was still a real angel. So, how could he possibly go about it now?
“Look who’s talking,” the former angel says, shifting in his seat as he burrows his hands in the pockets of his jacket. He turns his head to pin Dean with a look. “Yes, Dean. I gave up. I’m tired and I’m done fighting.” Cas gaze falls to Dean’s side, where his gun is strapped to his hip. “You might as well just take that gun of yours and end me right here.” The words are spoken so nonchalantly that they have to be meant as a joke, yet Dean’s entire body goes rigid at them, and the look Cas’ gives him makes it clear that joking is the furthest thing from his mind right now.
The other’s words make it clear what Cas thinks of him now. ‘Fearless leader’ has become a synonym for heartless bastard and it hits Dean like a freight train that the look Cas is giving him right now is the same Dean had whenever he talked to his father way back when, even though Dean never had the guts to confront John about what he made him into. It still hurts all the same to think that Cas believes he is just a blunt instrument to him.
He doesn’t realize how long he sits there just looking up and thinking until the sun rises a few hours later. He pulls himself up then, his vessel’s skin thoroughly cold to the point where he can almost feel the sensation tingle at his fingertips.
Cas looks at him then, open and curious. For a moment Dean’s entire vision is filled with bright blue as the angel tilts his head at him, no trace of the anger left in his expression. Dean is more than relieved to see Cas’ gaze awake and alert, but his scrutiny still makes Dean shift in his seat. He averts his eyes, feeling a little too warm all of the sudden.
The cabin was dimly lit and nearly empty, just the way Cas always found it. This time though, he had set up a display, an altar of sorts on the table in the middle of the room. Castiel had snuck out of his house and into the woods with a bag full of items to make this possible, and he thought it was worth it. From the old-fashioned candlestick holders, the long plain wax candles topped with their tiny sources of light, to the intricately painted dishes he had placed, to his ornate standing mirror, everything was perfect. He had gathered some pine branches, arranged them here and there. A long wooden dish held an unlit stick of incense, and Castiel used the flame of a nearby candle to start it as well. The trail of smoke wafted up and away from the decorated table, mixing a faint scent of musk and spices into the air. Castiel took a deep breath and smiled.
When Cas spun around to face him, the genuine glee in his eyes was endearing enough that Dean’s gun went forgotten.
Cas lifted his head to look at Dean, noticing his tears immediately. “We’re okay, Dean. This is okay.” He leaned up to kiss Dean’s cheek before rolling over off of him and curling into his side. “I know I said we could talk after, and I still want to, but I think we need a shower.”
“Who are you?”
, not like he does now.
Dean laughed. “What’s this? The always pure Castiel is ready for ruin tonight, huh?”
All of that was normal, because it had to be.
Castiel was still so close to him. Now that Dean knew who he was faced with, he was annoyed that he hadn’t sensed something before. Even now, from two feet away, Dean could feel a tension in the air, a new gravity that pulled Dean closer. How’d he miss that before? It wasn’t anything he’d heard before, but angel lore is real rare, and he honestly hadn’t heard much. Probably why his sigil was wrong.
Castiel just looked at him and Dean felt like he was exposed like Cas could read his mind and pick out that four-letter word he’s been biting down on for years. He saw the remaining insecurity hiding carefully behind Dean’s eyes and further reassured him. “Yes, Dean, this is more than okay, and if you would like, we can talk first. I do want to be honest, however, and I feel as if I do not get you into my bed I could die.” Castiel spoke so matter of factly, that same air of surety and resolve present as always, and Dean couldn’t help but snort out a laugh. Cas frowned slightly at Dean. “This is no laughing matter, please, you have no idea how long I have wanted you like this.”
Dean tossed the remaining bits of caution to the wind. “I want you facin' me then. For our kiss. Hell, gotta do it right if we’re doing it.” Dean was glad he could say that without needing to look Cas in the eye. Caution be gone or not, sometimes it’s hard to ask your best friend
rather, but instead, it feels wrong. Dirty. Dean feels weaker than ever, smaller than he thought possible in a place he’d normally consider his domain. His heartbeat sped, and she likely felt it where one hand lay over his chest.
“It’s just for coffee,” Dean supplied, still feeling like he had to explain himself. Castiel did relax minutely, and there was some new shine in his eyes that wasn’t there before, but his stare was just as crazy intense. Dean was tied into his game, and he didn’t know what the rules were, let alone the prize.
The two met up again during lunch, Meg furiously waving Cas over to a table with very few vacancies. The introductions to Meg's friends went at a near-overwhelming pace, and Castiel felt a little dizzy from all the action and attention. He shifted the focus off himself and towards the group, allowing himself the moment to let all the
Dean relaxed at those words, laughing the same careless laugh that had Castiel flushing earlier. The sun had gone down now, mostly hidden behind the horizon, and the hallway was much darker than it had been at the beginning of their encounter. It felt intimate; the light had dimmed as they grew closer in some strange, unexpected moment.
Maybe he liked being alone because he didn't feel like he was pretending at all; there was no need to install that airtight filter on himself, no need to conceal anything.
They started their meal across the blanket from each other, but by the time Dean pulled out the flatbread he had made, the other boy had meandered his way across the fabric to Dean's side. There were no complaints, not from either of them, with Castiel tucked under Dean's arm and a summer meal laid out before them like a banquet.
—————
“Roughhousing,” Dean repeated, an amused chuckle directed at Castiel finally got the boy to look up. He blushed like he always did when Dean poked fun at his vocabulary.
"I just… Um, I just know you're good at this, like
Cas didn’t move closer, just spun around to lean casually back against the sink. Dean thanked the gods (some of which he’s killed, so he also apologized just in case they held a grudge) that the man was wearing pajamas and not a damned lab coat. Dean was already having a hard time holding back, if this fit any more clearly into his fantasies he would have imploded. Dean’s eyes still roved over Castiel’s body, until he was sucked back into their staring contest. Still feeling challenged, not that it was a problem, Dean continued, voice more nervous than intended. “I just picked a lock, it’s not like I broke any windows or anything, I just…. I needed to sort this out and get home, I don’t want to be any trouble..”
Dean should have known better than to try and argue theology with, well, God’s actual army. An almighty being, or whatever.
________
Cas tutted and the tiny amused smile on his face made Dean’s chest flutter. What did Cas do, though, that
Dean still looked slightly skeptical, but he was watching Castiel in vague anticipation for what would happen next. When a few moments passed with nothing more than a few measured breaths and the friends’ usual staring, Dean huffed a quiet laugh, smiling at Castiel’s nervous demeanor.
Castiel attempted to refocus on his task and continued screwing the little white lids onto each container slowly, buying his time on the floor. His hands were trembling, and he could only hope it wasn't noticeable to anyone else that he was freaking out. Castiel knew he should have had a plan in place. He had known the eventual confrontation was inevitable. Planning was too painful, a weird reminder that Castiel didn't
“I like these clothes. And I’m… Not exactly a model angel, I know.” Castiel spoke frankly, like he was repeating something he’d been told before. “How many angels have you met that are willing to assist a hunter?”
“So, Castiel. Whatcha doin’ here?”
They had rushed to the dorms, to Dean’s solo room, often stopping to pull the other against a wall or a door or the side of the elevator at every chance, the magnetism between them too much to resist. Once in Dean’s room, in Dean’s
Castiel looked at Dean with a plea in his eyes, again lifting his two wine bottles towards Dean. “Will, you just
Once again, Dean refocused his priorities. It was easier now that there was a woman in front of him, her fingers slid up his arm to rest on his bicep. He played the part, used a fake name for the introduction, barely processed hers, and within no time, they didn’t need to talk anymore. Dean kept his mind centered, his senses taken over by… Madison or Diana or
when they spoke, happened to be a medical professional, and seemingly had taken on the task of singlehandedly flustering Dean to no end. He blushed like a damned
“So, what’s next?” Dean turned his face to look at Cas, and when their eyes met, Castiel’s world stopped. He was inches away, leaning in just that little distance would be so easy, and god did he want to.
Dean teased Cas for the face he pulled, but even he had scrunched his nose at the taste, which Castiel pointed out. Dean only stuck out his tongue in response.
ever gotten off just from hearing someone’s voice? C’mon, that’s gotta mean he’s my soulmate or something.”
. Cas forced himself to blink and return to easy eye contact.
be calling his dad. That was the same as admitting defeat. For a man like John Winchester, rolling over on your back in submission and calling for help seemed to bleed into a singular action, and it definitely was not one the domineering father thought highly of.
Castiel smiled knowingly, giving a soft nod.
“So do. Um. Do you… I… Sorry, I don’t know how to… Angel.” Dean stuttered through a few segues; the number of questions still rattling around was overwhelming. “If you’re an angel, why are you trying to kick me out of the house? What happened to helpin’ out a good believer when there’s no room in the inn? And why are you… dressed like that? No corporate drone suit?”
Cas couldn't hold the bitter tone from seeping into his voice, but no one seemed to notice. The barriers he’d constructed around his emotions were flimsy, built quickly and with no time to labor over the details. It was all still raw, the paint still drying. His fractured sentences barely captured everything he was feeling, but even just recalling what had happened stung deep. He apologized for the mood drop, wishing he had a more satisfying ending to the story for both himself and the girls around him. Still, life wasn't a stage musical, and not every relationship earned a satisfying conclusion.
Dean reached a hand down to Cas, helping to pull him to his feet. Bobby shook his hand, clearly taken aback by Castiel's firm, no-nonsense grip. Dean remembered feeling like he was interviewing for a job when they first met, but Castiel now impressed his uncle, and that made him smile.
“Don’t act disappointed. Your hands are just too big. I’m sure they’re good for all sorts of other things.” Dean choked a bit on a breath as Castiel spoke those words, not having expected the man to play the game with so much practiced skill. As the man’s soft and soothing hands moved across his chest, he was too distracted by the way their skin felt where they made contact to feel the initial pokes that made up the first suture. As soon as it was finished though, the purple-tinted string pulled taut, it hit him at once so he cursed under his breath. Castiel apologized, still a smile across his lips, but continued his ministrations. Dean dug his fingernails into his palms as the man worked, wishing briefly for the flask in his jacket, but not wanting Castiel to move away. His eyes would have been squeezed shut from the pain if that hadn’t meant he would miss watching Castiel as he worked. He felt electric, buzzing from the balls of his feet to the tips of his ears.
Now, Cas had him second-guessing how universal that pull might be. But, regardless of his
It wasn’t new for them to flirt, it wasn’t new for them to slip an innuendo or two, but it rarely got this forward. Dean wasn’t about to turn around now, not when it was getting exciting, and in fact, he was going to barrel right on through. “Don’t act like you haven’t thought about me fucking.” (A careful rearrangement of those last two words could have really accelerated things, but Dean wasn’t ready for that.) He raised an eyebrow at Castiel, waiting for a response. A sneaky smile crept its way onto Castiel’s face, enough proof that Dean was right with his last assumption. “Dunno, guess I pinned you for more of a… waxer, not a waxee.”
stepped aside to let me foot the bill.”
Friendly smiles to the waitresses, a booth by the window, Castiel’s foot bumping up against Dean’s shoe just light enough to serve as a reminder of his presence and not cause an annoyance.
He could picture it perfectly.
Once the air around the pair didn’t sting at their eyes and the fire was fully extinguished, Dean looked down at the pile of ash and destroyed paper with a clear question in his eyes. Castiel answered without needing Dean to vocalize it.
Cas was facing the wall of the gym, back to the booth and the growing crowd. The chatter of the students was easier to ignore this way, and Gilda much easier to hear. When Gilda finished up, and all that Cas needed to do was close the glitter containers, she smiled wide and set to hanging it above the booth.
. Cas didn’t seem to notice his nerves, just moved impossibly closer, until he was about half an inch from sitting on Dean’s lap, his legs still tossed over Dean’s, just… more so. Enticingly more so. The movement had knocked Dean’s hand free from its post between Cas’s thighs, but now Cas was right
At least if the gender was ambiguous, the pool of possibilities was larger.
“Well, then, what about when we were casing the neighborhood? You grabbed my elbow and pulled me into that plant store and insisted on looking at all the damn
thinking about any of that, he was just in the middle of one of his entirely friendly and platonic staring contests with Cas. To be fair, Castiel was always staring right back. “You didn’t answer my question. Movie night, or are you leavin’ me alone?” He played it up, hitting Cas with his best puppy dog eyes, peeking over the back of the couch at him.
Once Dean blew out the ash and sat the pipe down, he leaned back with a comfortable, warm high spreading through his limbs. There, with Castiel lying next to him on the blanket, on their beach, their shoulders touching as they stared up at the sky, he felt content. Happy. Even a little giddy, and not just from the bowl they shared. They had been talking for hours as the sun set, and the darkness made Dean feel brave enough to move forward.
Plus, it didn't hurt that Meg and Ruby were in the art class he was taking before gym. The two girls spent most of the period seemingly set on interviewing Castiel about his life while they sketched. He hadn't talked to anyone like this since Dean, and before that, he wasn't sure he had ever opened up that much.
Cas let one of Dean’s hands go, lowering his body down until Dean could feel the hot line of Castiel’s cock against the crease of his thigh. Dean’s hand flew down to grab at Cas, his hand finally moving down past the invisible barrier he had constructed earlier on the couch, past the waistband of Castiel’s shorts. Dean finally palmed at the man’s ass, rocking his hips up at the same time to press them yet tighter together.
Castiel hadn't been in any situations that had felt so similar to life or death as the overlapping circumstances, but he was relatively sure that things were supposed to slow down. Castiel instead felt that everything happened simultaneously, events unfolding in such rapid succession that there was no time to take a single breath. Dean was there, he was panicking, the glitter was hitting the floor, and he was covered and the world was spinning so fast Cas could feel it and Dean was still there, still talking, still so close.
When Castiel heard Gilda's excited "hello," he assumed Charlie and Jo had returned. Before he could spin around and check, the resounding response caused panic to bubble into his chest. The familiar timbre could only belong to one person.
"Lookin' good, girl!" And there he was, Dean Winchester. Or, Cas wished with every fiber of his being, it was somehow a completely different person doing an eerie impression of Dean and his coy, teasing voice. And this separate Not-Dean was flirting openly with Gilda, which was okay because this wasn't
Regardless of the nonsense babble, the smile the girls gave him in response held no malice. He just needed a few moments to catch his breath and get the green flecks off his fingers so he could be free to wipe the tears that threatened to leak onto his cheeks. He mumbled to them to thank Charlie, and without further explanation, he dashed towards the bathroom against the furthest wall in the gym. He carefully maneuvered through the crowd, ensuring no run-ins with Dean would occur on the way there. He received plenty of stares, a few laughs, and a crude glitter-themed joke or two that Castiel thought didn't make much sense while on his way, but Castiel would rather the entire school see him like this than have a single run-in with Dean, suit of glitter or not.
Cas let himself stare unabashedly at Dean longer than he normally would, knowing he was shrouded in darkness and honestly not caring anymore if he were caught. It was more important to watch how the flame of the candlestick caused a golden light to flicker over Dean’s face. Cas wanted to kiss his freckles. The alcohol made things slightly hazy, but it didn’t dull his feelings, in fact, the opposite was true.
," as Castiel put it. "
“Weird that you’re not wearing your ring,” Cas said.
Once Castiel adapted to the new personalities he was suddenly surrounded with, he found he liked the company. For someone lacking the experience that Castiel did, he was starting to think he had a solid grasp on the whole
Plus, the guy had said he’d been on earth in this body for over two years; he had to be sorta used to it. Dean couldn’t be the only hot-blooded American male who had it bad for dark, messy hair, blue eyes, high cheekbones, lips to die for…
Dean nearly laughed, but something about the angel that stood in front of him stole the breath out of his lungs before he could find the true humor at the moment.
If Dean’s mind weren’t entirely blank, he’d use the moment as a teaching opportunity, showing Cas exactly why people always assumed there was
Dean huffed out a laugh. "It actually did." He looked down at his hand where he still gripped the camera; the display had timed out to black by now. "Thank you. Again. Um. For the picture." Dean seemed to be preparing to go, to end the moment they were sitting in, and Castiel didn't want that. He didn't think Dean did either, based on the slow way he spoke, eyes searching Castiel's expressions for something else.
Dean was disappearing into the thrall of people waiting outside the club before Castiel could correct him on today’s chosen topic. The paleontology book was last week, technically focused on the philosophy surrounding the field rather than the lighter topic Dean referenced. Today Castiel had brought along a thesis he had stumbled across and he was more than excited to lose himself in postulations about the effects of technological advancement on travel industries.
He blamed it on the always-shocking softness of the other’s hands.
“Please, let me hear you, Dean, please,” Cas pleaded, letting out his own desperate groans as he focused on the feeling of Dean’s body against his. Dean’s mouth fell open in a whimper when Cas tugged on his hair again, and Cas’s movements became more erratic, Dean doing what he could to meet Castiel’s thrusts by raising off the bed, but everything was
“I’d like a quick shower.” Dean took Castiel’s movement as his cue to start the day. He continued talking as he stood up out of bed and stretched. “We need to pack your stuff. Maybe we can stop for breakfast before we get back to school?”
The heat that flickered from Dean's fingers against Cas's where they curled and met around the camera was distracting but easy enough to ignore. Cas was used to shuttering his longing. But, once Castiel saw the way Dean watched his lips, he dared to think the feeling could be mutual. Under the gentle light, it was easy to forget themselves, and Cas found himself tilting his head closer towards Dean's. Before he could pull away, Dean let out a soft breath and surged forward, capturing Cas's lips in an unexpected kiss.
“H-hey, let me.” Cas slid his chair back, insecure about seeming too eager when the chair hit the wall in his haste to reach Dean on the other side of the table. “Let me get that for you.” Dean just shrugged and nodded, blinking up at Cas, as unaffected as he always was in the face of Castiel’s nerves.
Dean would verbalize that, but it was clear he wasn’t familiar enough with angelic duties to really make the comparison correctly. Regardless, Castiel was in Dean’s office tellin’ him how to hunt, and John Winchester didn’t teach him everything he knew for some feathered fuckin-
would compare to the way that Dean had whispered ‘
Castiel smiled at those thoughts,
straddling him. The blade to the throat though? Dean had to take full responsibility for any thoughts formed from that.
Dean, for one, was confused as to what about his coffee meeting had flipped off Castiel’s fight or flight, but he’d keep his eyes far away from that gift horse’s mouth. Or whatever the saying was. Idioms were significantly further down Dean’s list of priorities than anything else about the situation in front of him, from the blue-eyed drifter to the weapons said vagrant had stolen from him.
The man managed to be one of the most famous people Castiel ever had met, and yet it seemed that Dean made it his personal goal to shatter any expectations that Cas had for him. That initial meeting was full of firsts. Castiel had never had a client invite him into a gas station for a “break from the car.” Cas had never had coffee that comes out of a self-serve machine with flavor options and so Dean insisted he should get a cup. Dean, for all his wealth, seemed more than pleased with the selection of sad-looking hotdogs, slowly rotating under a nearly effective heat lamp offered at the checkout line, despite the dozens of real restaurants within a few miles. Dean was the first and probably the last person Cas had ever chauffeured who hated being a passenger. He even promised to hate any car that Castiel showed up in. He stressed that fact multiple times over their first official meeting, and Cas would now be surprised if Dean ever got into the Mercedes without first lamenting the lack of bench seats or any other countless perceived flaw.
As the two of them stared extensively at the newest ash pile, Dean breathed out a laugh. “Ha, see there?” Dean pointed to one end of the pile. “Looks like you in the mornings when you sleepover and don’t wanna get up. Just a lump of blankets on the bed, cuz you’re pretending you can’t hear me waking you.” Cas’s cheeks burned at that, not only because he was being called out for his morning grumpiness, but because he wasn’t sure if Dean knew what he was doing to Cas by saying that.
“I’d quite like to kiss you. I think that’s the inevitable next step here unless I’ve read this all entirely wrong.” Now it was Dean’s turn to laugh at Castiel, hushed and hurried as he nodded quick and leaned in just the extra few inches to press their lips together. It was too short, Dean unable to suppress a soft whine when Cas pulled back after only a moment. The man answered with a hum and pulled back further to glance around the room, as if contemplating something suddenly more pressing than... well,
He sped through the work he had been given that night and went to sleep early when he was unable to shake the waking thoughts of Dean. Senior year was going to kill him.
A dozen or so rounds later of a highly convoluted drinking game with enough rules to confuse even a sober mind, which neither of them had, the two boys were both flushed and loose, drunk and free. Castiel was pretty sure Dean was making up the rules as they went, but he didn’t mind. It seemed like each shot broke down something between them, and by the end of the game, Cas or maybe Dean or maybe the both of them had squished their chairs so close together it might be better defined as a bench. Cas felt like his entire left side was on fire despite the cold. The way he was pressed up against Dean’s side wasn’t entirely new for them, but the added component of drunkenness made it entirely different, almost taboo.
When Cas still hesitated, Meg shot him a look. He trusted her for some reason and started speaking without the realization that he made the decision. "It's nothing, really. I just... I thought it was, you know? Or at least, it could have been. It was my first... anything."
Dean hugged Cas tighter, smiling at him. “Sure, Cas. You kinda came all over me, so a shower might help.”
“That’s fine,” Cas nodded once, the smile behind his eyes only growing.
It didn’t have to mean more. It could just be how they are. Their relationship wasn’t exactly by the book to begin with; who cares if a tiny town John Doe thought he and Cas were bumpin’ uglies on the side.
“I’m Castiel,” The man spoke, still a ragged timbre Dean was more used to hearing in bed than from strange men with strange names and even stranger behavior. “You look hurt.”
Add the smart-aleck at the Motel 6 to the list now too.
Castiel immediately interrupted him. “Dean,” he warned, wary of whatever his friend was up to.
. But with Dean practically radiating his comforting warmth, a slow, sleepy breath washing over him, Cas couldn’t remember what the point of being awake was.
“Apologies.” Castiel cleared his throat before reaffixing a confident stare at Dean, his movement across the floor only stopping once he was hovering on the line of
. He still couldn’t move his hand, just petting over Castiel’s impossibly soft skin was enough to keep him occupied for an embarrassingly long time. “Seems like you did a pisspoor job of showering off your sins, you got any more of these on your back? Anywhere else?”
Dean grinned at Cas, reaching up to ruffle his hair. “Don’t tell Sam you come here though, he’ll drive you crazy with all the stories about the forest gods and stuff.”
Large block letters reading "DEBATE" caught Castiel's eye, more out of a memory than any genuine interest. Looking around at the students behind the table, Castiel wondered if any of them were Dean's brother. He had mentioned that Sam was a member, but no one seemed to look young enough to fit Dean's description. He didn't know for sure; he could be staring right at Dean's little brother. It wasn't like he had seen photos; Dean never did take him around for that family dinner his uncle had promised. Castiel, at the time, had assumed Dean wasn't yet comfortable with having him around the family, but he now knew Dean didn't think of him as important.
“Yes, I did the walls here. So many buildings are left to rot and to collect dust, I wanted to add some beauty. I assume antiquated religious art doesn’t add much to the value, but I find that I do not care how much the bank makes on this place. I needed to practice, and this house had the wall space.” The man thought for an extra moment before adding in, “And the lighting. That was crucial.”

Castiel will not humor his ignorance. For good or for ill, he wants to taste Dean, once at least.

, to Cas. I should pull you down from that damn tree, friggin’ sitting there like Queen Bitch of the World, and—”
Castiel’s eyes snapped open and stared upward at his slightly spinning warm beige ceiling, when his cell phone broke him out of the deeply unfortunate daydream he’d been having as his favorite movie soundtrack played quietly in the background and he flirted with the potential of sleep. It had been a month of this at least, and

“I’d like that very much, Dean,” he says, still with a hint of nervousness, but also with his usual guileless gratitude.
“A good memory, yes,
Cas smiles back. Hesitantly, like he’s not sure where this is all going.
“Well then,” he says against Castiel’s mouth, and tamping down his grace is quite worth the sensitivity to being physically loved by this demon. His mouth tingles as Dean’s moves over it, skillful with the small allowances he makes, from corner to corner in small, light kisses. Hands holding the lapels of his overcoat, Dean lips at his bottom lip until it’s almost
he could save Dean.
Ah, Dean has caught up, finally, to the real and definite reason he’s saying this. He can see that, in Dean’s face, as well. Family, saying goodbye to him, leaving him bereft. It’s something that makes Dean shut down, Castiel knows, and he’s been counting on that. Counting on Dean being stunned, for just long enough.
Castiel’s heart starts to pound, beyond his dwindling grace, as he looks into Dean’s face and sees him swallow, hard. He wonders what Dean is forcing back; what Dean isn’t telling him, because he can see that Castiel has more to say.

Castiel looks around, but there’s no escape. The only door in is the one Death is banging on, and the only door out is…
“Goodbye, Meg.” Castiel hung up and dropped his phone onto the pillow beside him with a long exhale, melting into the maroon bedspread.
“Clarence, damn it, of course I—” But Castiel appeared to be quite finished, and he waved a hand, faced away from Meg and inches away from the back door.
, Clarence! Don’t act like

“He thought I was…interested, then, when we’d only met. I couldn’t argue with him, feelings were difficult for me. I couldn’t always identify why I was connected to you.” Castiel’s thoughtful look turns troubled, his eyes moving away from Dean’s face. Dean shakes the wrist that’s carelessly draped over his chest, trying to grab his attention back, but he remains diverted. “I thought it was my grace, or some form of—” and finally he faces Dean again, pressing his hand flat where it lay. “Ownership, forgive me, Dean. I thought it was because I’d returned you to yourself, that it was pride in creation, and it was unclean, blasphemous, because the only true creator is God.”
affection is one thing Dean will never get, and Cas has tried but he can’t seem to even explain it himself, so it’s better left unsaid.
It’s a pain, of course, the thought that the world would’ve gone unsaved, and Dean and Sam and their family would’ve been short-lived anyway. That’s a pain, under his ribs.
to help her brother, nobody got to Cas like Dean did, and it was better to stick it out and wait for their bond to work its magic.
But he wants to wipe that face out of Dean’s repertoire. It is the first time that he can remember feeling a demon should not be hated for its nature, but this feeling persists nonetheless.
gratitude is showing just as plainly as Cas’s.
It’s something Castiel has known for a while, something that makes Dean close his mouth when his lips touch Castiel’s, something that makes him leave open, sucking marks that swell his vessel’s flesh everywhere but there.

Ruby and Anna broke apart with a wet smack as Castiel’s door slammed open.
It hits Dean like a brick to the face, that night, when Sam is putting Jack to bed and he’s sitting in the kitchen watching Cas wash dishes, like he’s a person or something.
…But, that feeling is nothing. He stands up, clear-eyed and dry-faced by the time he is upright, and shakes his head at himself.
with feeling. Not once does his mouth open, and by the time he goes to slip down to Castiel’s neck with those dedicated lips, Castiel has had enough.
Meg chased Castiel out of it, as he moved with stiff, angry purpose as far away from the room as he could get. They got all the way to the back door and slammed
“Meg, whatever I’ve said—done, to make you think— I’m sorry. But this isn’t what I wanted. This is not what I thought we were doing.” Castiel sounded upset—as upset as he could, notorious stone wall he was, standing at least five feet away from her with every bit of him closed off and looking almost

Dean is safe, and Castiel is glad.
Castiel is unsure what they’ll have to do and whether or not he…can. He will, of course, able or not. But.
Did that mean she…cared?
Ruby glanced at Anna, confused. They were friends, right, those two? Anna put a finger to her lips and cracked the door open quietly so the shouting was audible, and they both leaned in to listen. It’s not like Cas would be all that forthcoming later if they didn’t.
“No? You’re mixing your signals here, buddy,” Calmly amused though he might seem, his restraint fades with the shock and his eyes fully darken for a minute or longer before he controls himself again. Castiel is very grateful sometimes for this particular indicator.
He almost lost Cas, for good this time, in a way that he couldn’t undo. Time almost caught up with them, and he almost left Cas in Heaven, or hell, on Earth with some other poor bastard who might not have-
Dean could feel his face shaping into confusion again against Cas’s, and Cas hurried to clarify, kissing again and again, “I went to you, Dean, before—before Crowley’s deal. You were raking, as Lisa wanted, and there was peace for you. I could not ask you to let that go, and Crowley—he knew.” Castiel growls against Dean’s lips and squeezes him tighter, “He
“You told me that time we kissed at Crowley’s place was—” Castiel took a seemingly involuntary step toward Meg as she crossed her arms and glared at him, his face lined with frustration.
Yes, he healed himself, but—he feels. It’s there, still. It persists.
Sam starts to stand up, raising his hands slowly, as though in surrender, as though Castiel could be dangerous.
Meg was gone when Anna walked into the kitchen and reached for a pan to make breakfast, huffing at the shock of cold tile against her bare feet beneath her thick cotton pajama cuffs where she’d kicked off her socks in the night. She tilted her head, looking at other angles through the lace curtains, even opened the back door to the

He runs away. He is supposed to be the rocks, not the waves, and he runs away, leaves the rust and stained glass and Sam’s expectations and finds a quiet corner a block away.

She nodded toward the doorway, asking Ruby to come with her, and got up off the couch, shutting the TV off and pulling Ruby by the hand out, up the stairs, to her room. They crawled into her big, expensive, messy bed, ankle-socked feet curling up together, and Ruby held her, as she tried to pretend like her eyes weren’t watering, as she buried her face in the musky shoulder of Ruby’s old

“You want a hand?”
“Yeah? What’d ol’ Jimmy say?
“That trust is gone, Meg. But…you can have one chance.
“He was wrong about us,” says Castiel, firm, into Dean’s shoulder.
, and Meg could stay out there like a chastised dog all night for all she cared after this. She shut the door and left her out there, and watched through the window, but her expression and position didn’t change at all. Shaking her head, she walked back into the den, toward that warm, quiet, dark space she’d been enjoying a lot with her girl before this shit went down.
“When Jack was dying, I- I made a deal, to save him.”
Castiel looks only too happy to squash Dean’s expectations when he says, “Actually, he encouraged me to pursue you, as long as he was—removed. Unable to,
“…I. I was unprepared.” is all he manages to offer, squeezing his eyes shut, feeling too much of the body and not enough of his grace. Why is it so difficult to stifle this feeling? It was supposed to be

Dean would have no idea what was missing, because he never would have found it, in a dorky little nerd angel who’s also fierce and forgiving and loving, and. God. Thinking about it makes his heart physically ache.
Castiel’s mouth tightened, and Dean felt his stomach jump at another reminder of the severity the guy seemed to be trying to express. “I knew you well, Dean, after Hell. I will always know you, the way you were then. Humans are wild and artless, hard to predict, confusing for one as foreign as I was. Jimmy was helpful, but nothing was more relieving—and, and
He can’t protest this, even though he loathes the shamed face Dean shows, when Castiel pokes his tongue against them and he immediately backs off. He can’t be sure he would be comfortable inhaling the smoke—cannot even be sure he would not hurt Dean mixing with him in this way.

It was less than five minutes of soft murmuring behind Cas’s door before Dean Winchester arrived, and Meg was still there, lording it on high as usual from the treehouse Gabe and Michael had built before taking off for college. Jamming his hands into the pocket of his leather jacket so sharply it must have hurt him, Dean glared hard enough at Meg for her to catch

Castiel catches a glimpse of Sam’s rolling eyes over Dean’s shoulder and quickly turns back to smile at his lover as the door closes behind the younger Winchester, honestly happy to see him. Sam will be gone an hour at least; their routine is very sound by this point.
She was calling him. Of course she was. After this long, you’d think she would have given up.
“No to your firmly closed lips, Dean Winchester,” he says, directly staring, watching Dean’s unblinking response, feeling Dean startle under his hands. Dean likely hadn’t realized he’d noticed—or even that he’d been doing this.
Hell, Dean doesn’t know where it’s going either. He just has to let Cas know, somehow, that he’s fucking important. He matters. And Dean’s life without him, just… wouldn’t be the same.
And instigate he does. Beginning with the tactic from before, he sets Castiel’s lips tingling again, and then pokes them with his tongue, too gentle, worsening the sensation until it’s nigh unbearable. By the time Castiel is prepared to part his lips, the combination of Dean’s ministrations and Castiel’s purposefully stifled grace has him panting, sharply, through his nose. His entire body is heated, moistening beneath his vessel’s choice of plain cotton underwear, hard and solid near Dean’s thigh.
Dean's eyes go comically wide before he rocks backward. “

Its pleasures are simple, straightforward. And yet, when he closes his eyes and tips his face up to the spray, wholly immersive. When he’s here, he hears nothing, sees nothing, feels nothing except the water beating into his body and the stress of this new existence falling inexorably away.
“I’ll fuck you good and deep, sweetheart. God, you know I will, don’t you? But when I do,” Dean leans closer, lips over Cas’s ear, “I wanna watch you touch yourself.” Cas tenses, his fingers clawing into Dean’s ribs, and it’s kind of the best thing Dean’s felt all day. Or, well, in the last two minutes. He drops a fat kiss on Cas’s neck. “Yeah,” he says, licking the words into Cas’s skin. “I wanna watch you stroke that gorgeous cock of yours while I fuck you, hmm? Get so deep up inside you and stay there, baby. Fuck you so full. Hold you down on my dick while you come and—”
It’s hot and it’s cramped and there’s water everywhere, beating into Dean’s back, catching Castiel in the face and stinging his eyes, but he doesn’t care. He watches the water slide—down his body, tumble over his hips and slip down Dean’s face, drip from his chin. So many showers, Castiel thinks, so many showers to get clean and this is filthy. It’s obscene—the seal of Dean’s lips, the twist of his tongue—and Castiel wants it, God help him, he wants it, all of it.
If that hand were Dean’s hand, he might make longer strokes, like—
“Shhh,” Dean soothes—an impossible entreaty, surely, given the ways he’s turning his tongue over Castiel’s nipple, tugging it with the tips of his teeth the same way he’s tugging at Castiel’s cock, drawing desperation from Castiel’s body, drop by drop. He finds himself arching again, clawing at Dean’s neck and panting.
“You’re close,” Cas says, certain. “You are. I can feel it.”
At this point, he thinks, whether or not he reaches a conclusion about Dean’s cryptic advice is inconsequential. He just longs to feel . . . not like this, ill at ease and unsatisfied. No. He yearns to be tranquil, at peace. A shower might help, he thinks. The warmth and rhythm might soothe whatever this irritation might be.
“Dean,” Castiel says, the word falling out loud and ragged. “Don’t— I need you— Please, you have to—”
He stalks up on the tub like it’s gonna bite him, wary as hell, but he still jumps when Cas starts waving the handle around in the general direction of his face.
He gasps as Dean reaches up to toy with his cock again, gentle, slippery touches that feed the fire at the base of Castiel’s spine. Dean’s head shifts, makes Castiel’s fingers chase him as he moves over to lick Castiel’s tattoo, nibbling at the sacred language inked into Castiel’s skin. He lays his mouth over the ancient words on Castiel’s body, kissing each holy line, and in the drift of his lips, in the careful worship from this imperfect man whose righteous soul laid claim to Castiel long ago, Castiel feels something immutable, something like starlight, something not so far from grace.
“No. No,” Dean says firmly. “I— I just need a second.”
Dean purses his lips and weighs his options. "Broken how?"
“I’ve wanted to touch you,” Cas says, words hurried, “I thought about you touching me, touched myself pretending it was you. I thought about this, Dean. About what it would be like to feel you.“
"Um. Very?"
Because it’s not like there was a morning he woke up and thought,
Dean’s wet, ruined clothes cling and stick while Castiel is naked before him, wrapped only in water and the clutch of Dean’s hands. And he should feel vulnerable, at the mercy of Dean’s mouth, Dean’s command, but it’s the opposite. Castiel feels invincible in this moment, chest expanding with every breath and beyond. Inside he’s expanding like the universe, blown wide and alive, aware of every movement and molecule.
“Tell me, Cas,” Dean says, smile and eyes bright. “Tell me what you want. Is it this?” He moves like a snake, sneakier than the water, just pushes up and swallows Castiel down.
Castiel thrills.
“I’m gonna make you come,” Dean says, head turned so his lips ghost along Castiel’s length. “D’you want that? You want me to suck you off?” His tongue sneaks out, just the tip. “Make you come so hard?”
He fastens his gaze back on the mirror and watches as his downward strokes turn into upward pulls as his cock rises, its hard length curving out away from his body. Steam is steadily reclaiming the mirror, fogging over Castiel’s face and neck, but he doesn’t care. He can’t. His attention is lower, zeroed in on his hand and his cock, and it’s easier this way, he thinks—as he studies the speed of his hand, the twist of his wrist—easier to imagine that perhaps it’s not his hand that he’s watching. To imagine instead that it’s Dean’s, that maybe this is what it would look like if Dean’s hand were working him, jerking him, that maybe this is how he would touch Castiel, what he might do to make Castiel feel good.
” Castiel whines, working his hips against Dean’s, trapping his cock between their bodies and grinding until Dean’s lips stumble and he moans, this deep unbidden sound, right into Castiel’s mouth.
He sighs and sits up, loosening the knot of his tie, and he’s a half-step from turning on the TV when there’s an odd noise from the bathroom, like the shower’s choking on its own tongue. It splutters and there’s some banging, and some undignified yelping, before the strangled hiss of the water fades down to a drizzle. Less than.
“Dean—” he says again, low and unsteady, the word rolling around in his mouth as Dean’s tongue slides into the groove of his hip.
Castiel’s hips pitch up and he cries out. It’s all he can do with Dean’s hand on his cock, that smile hanging right in his face, and Lord, his heart is galloping in his chest, his lungs barely have air now, how can they? and he is, he
Castiel can feel his thighs tense, his toes tighten against the tile floor. He swallows hard and breathes deep, but his eyes never leave that reflection, the shade of Dean just behind.
Next time, he’ll know better.
Dean says, low and ragged.
His skin still holds the pink flush of heat from the shower, and when he drops the towel, tosses it aside, he can see it, the way the flush hangs on him, colors him from his thighs to his throat. He reaches up to touch his clavicle, that horizon of bone beneath taut skin, a little brush of fingers on flesh. Such a small thing that it surprises him. He shivers.
Dean surprises him again. Raises his head for a moment, green eyes burning.
Dean's lips curve.
Still, he hesitates. Lifts his hand, slow. Brushes his fingertips over the head. A slight, simple touch. He does it again, bolder, catches the pads of his fingers on the curve and traces the shaft to the base, where it joins with his body. And up. It’s a strange sensation, something like delicate lightning, but not at all unpleasant. So he does it again. This time, he cups his hand so the shaft meets his palm and moves once more, down and up, and that is—
“Yes,” Castiel shouts, head hitting the wall. “Make me. Dean, make me.” It’s part order, part plea as the hot glide of Dean’s mouth draws nonsense from his own. “Make me come. Make me come for you. I want— God, Dean, fucking
Dean makes that sound again: a low, contented hum.
Castiel startles, his feet tripping backward, heart thundering, suddenly aware of the mess he’s made, the smell of come, the over-hot clench of the air.
Castiel is spent, his body sings with exhaustion, but here, he realizes, is an opportunity. One he’s never had before. Another—a new—fantasy he can make come true. The thought sends a long lick of desire down his sated spine.
It’s so
Yes, he thinks, drowsy. This is much better.
“Okay. Good.”
He takes a deep breath that comes out like a rattle and gives himself a second to get a grip. It’s not like this is exactly the fantasy he’s been denying himself for weeks or anything. Because it’s not. No. It’s his friend who has a problem and he’s just asking Dean for a hand, and shit, that is so not helping.
Castiel considers. It surprises him how, considering his range of experience, Dean is markedly less willing to talk about sex, about the human body, than he’d anticipated. Perhaps these matters are not as simple to humans as he’d thought. He settles on the question that probably has the simplest answer. “When you experience arousal on your own," he says, "what’s the most efficient way to eradicate it?”
Water pours over Cas's body, rebounding off his skin and splashing Dean’s shirt. Cas is turning under the spray, hands drifting over his skin, and he’s close, God, he’s close. Droplets skim off his broad shoulders, cup his back, slide down his arms, and Dean is half hard just from watching him.
“What? Whoa. Cas!” Dean protests, but then he’s there, they’re there, standing together in the spray and Dean’s eyes are bewildered and wanting. Castiel recognizes that want, and knows now how to meet it.
He reaches over the counter and makes one long sweep with the towel, peeling back the steam from chest to hip of his reflection, and takes a step back to assess. He’s grown accustomed to thinking of this body, this reflection, as his—as
Castiel squeezes his eyes shut and gulps. Words are not equal to the force of what’s inside him. “
He listens for Dean in the next room, for the heavy and slow breaths that signal deep sleep—it would be inconsiderate to wake him.
“You, uh— Are you— Everything okay in there?”
“Oh, thank God,” Dean sighs, sagging in what looks like relief. He gets to his feet and claps Castiel on the shoulder as he passes. “You'll be fine. Just— don't over think it.”
Castiel sighs, his eyes caught one last time on the mirror, at the mess that he’s made. From now on, he thinks, he’ll stick to indulging himself in the shower. It’s just so much cleaner.
he was way better at keeping his head out of Cas’s pants. And, crap, no, that sounds— Ugh. Whatever.
sure as hell isn’t one of them. Maybe in the summertime it’s nice, out by the lakes or whatever it is the townspeople never stop talking about. But in the sloppy seconds of November, in the damp and the muck and the cold? Not so much.
“Right. Yeah. Right.” He jams the handle of the goddamn stupid (blessed, beautiful) shower and jumps out of the tub just as Cas flings open the bathroom door, letting in a whoosh of cold air. “Cas!” he complains, struggling to get finally get his damn shirt all the way off. Cas tosses his towel at Dean’s head and laughs, which is obviously nine kinds of unfair, seeing as he’s not the one fighting with fucking wet cuffs. Ugh.
He must look too long, or too wrong, because Cas makes a face. “Dean. The water is very cold. If you think you’ll be unable to repair it quickly, then I will have to—”
At least not more than six or seven times.
But Dean doesn’t answer, just pushes Castiel’s hips back with both hands and leans in, Castiel’s fingers still knotted in his hair. He sucks more hot kisses into Castiel’s ribs, a ladder of heat down Castiel’s abdomen, first one side and then the other. Castiel is past thinking, past reason. His mouth opens and closes of its own accord, finally finding a moan as Dean drags his bottom lip over his belly.
“Sonofabitch,” he rasps, but it doesn’t even slow Cas down—his mouth or his hand.
He's scrubbing his hair, fingers full of soap that smells of pinecones, when he feels it: that sudden sense of weight in his cock. It sways under his stare, as though it’s as uncertain about the situation as he is.
It’s not as specific as Castiel had hoped, but if there isn’t one right way, he thinks, then so be it. “Okay," he says.
He does not think
Touching himself like this isn’t uncomfortable or disagreeable, Castiel thinks. He rubs his thumb across the head. It’s soft and warmer still, this part of his cock. Almost hot. In theory, he understands that with some manipulation, some application of hand to flesh, like this, he could eradicate this problem. The shaft bumps the inside of his wrist as he turns his thumb again, and oh, there’s a sudden rumble of pleasure between his hips, a low-grade fever of feeling that’s sweet, somehow. Rich and deep.
, he says.
Dean says.
Cas is clutching his shower kit and inching toward the bathroom, already stupidly shirtless and, shit, is his belt undone?
He peers down his body, water falling from his face.
His cock’s still soft and sensitive but Cas is definitely more than half hard. Which is awesome. “Whatchyou want, Cas?” he asks, biting the ridge of Cas’s shoulder. “Tell me, baby. I’ll do it. Do anything you want.”
Worse, he’s around all the time. There’s no goddamn escape. They’re together like it’s normal and, terribly, it sort of is, and Dean has no clue how to deal.
His cock shivers, lurches in his hand as water falls over his fingers and onto the crown. And yet, he thinks vaguely, it’s difficult to conceive of how many of these touches he would need to translate this sensation—he cups his hand, lets the tip of his cock rest in his palm—into orgasm.
It's like it's always been here, waiting, this thing between he and Cas. But now Dean knows what he has.
He sounds like a kid caught with his hand in the cookie jar and Dean can’t help it. He grins. "Yeah,” he says. “You're not kidding."
At least, he’d never have assumed so.
He arches under the water, letting it fall in fat waves down his chest, his soapy hands trailing absently behind. Curls of shampoo snake down his hips and tumble to white caps at his feet.
Cas has one hand clenched around the shower curtain, white knuckles in cheap plastic, the other wrapped around something silver that looks suspiciously like the shower handle; which is good, because it gives Dean something to focus on, to stare at, rather than all that slick, beautiful skin.
Cas holds up his hands in surrender and backs away, sort of out of sight.
Do it again.”
Dean hangs his head with a sigh. The tips of ears, Castiel notes, are now a bright shade of red.
“Yeah,” Dean says, voice tight. “Fuck. Cas.”
“Kiss me,” Cas whispers, and this time Dean does, turns his head and shoves their mouths together, lets Cas curl a hand around his neck and lick the hurt little sounds from his lips. There’s a claim laid in this kiss. Dean knows it, feels it absolutely, the same way he did the first time he walked into the bunker back in Lebanon. Like being found, like finding. And maybe, hopefully, never having to leave.
Cas makes an impatient gesture at the motel and Dean remembers that he’s got the key.
He nudges Castiel backwards, until Castiel’s spine meets the tile wall, and okay, yes. This is better. He can breathe here, just outside the spray. He’s steadier, even as he watches Dean lean an arm’s length away, just enough so Castiel can see his own hands kneading at the film of Dean’s shirt. He drags his fingers over the nub of Dean’s nipple and Dean’s eyes go wide, give Castiel a flash of his own reflection, a glimpse of himself heady and wild.
Cas’s fingers are soft from the water but his grip on Dean’s cock is firm and perfect. Dean is so hard he could explode, which makes sense because if there’s such a thing as a sex bomb, Cas is nuclear warhead. Whatever fantasies Dean’d had about Cas as some blushing, wide-eyed virgin were both sorta right and really fucking wrong. Sure, Dean’s mouth on his cock had obviously blown his mind, but there’s no way in hell the guy is shy.
The door closes and the water kicks up, and Dean’s lungs deflate like a busted balloon.
Dean lifts his eyes, water pouring over his cheeks and down his chin as he sucks, unrelenting, his fist sliding to meet his lips, and Castiel knows he’s falling, tumbling fast toward orgasm.
Dean opens his mouth to say . . . something . . . but then there’s a fist pulling his tie and a mouth hot and open under his, and any words he might have added have been washed clean away, stolen right from his tongue.
He chokes on his coffee, in fact, coughing and pounding his chest a few times before he can speak. Sam, by comparison, is all throaty laughter, head thrown back and chest expanding.
He stretches his fingers over Dean’s lips, tracing the smooth seal of suction, and Dean moans, a tiny whimper of noise that he buries in Castiel’s cock right before he lifts his mouth away.
His cock moves at the thought, a hot jerk of its own accord that burns into Castiel’s hand. Interesting.
“Good,” Cas repeats, then winces. “I mean, okay.”
He touches it, the same way he’d done before, a press of his palm, a nudge of his fingers at the base. This time the heat of it surprises him. His cock is warmer than the water, and than the rest of his body too.
Dean had said.
“Dean,” he says, dazed, an expression of gladness, of desire, and this time it’s Dean who pulls Castiel’s mouth to his.
It certainly isn’t averse to its present environment, wrapped in the warm, steady spray, but it—
He looks back at mirror, at the blur of his cock, the hand around it, and if only, if only it were—
Except there must have been one, because now it’s like that all the damn time.
me— ” He spreads his legs wider and watches as Dean leans forward on his knees, a hungry hum at the back of his throat that Castiel can feel in his cock.
Cas shivers, this long lovely thing Dean can feel run through both their bodies, and Jesus fuck, Castiel really is gonna kill him.
Castiel’s breath snags in his throat. “What are you—?”
anything, okay? Or efficiency. You just gotta— Oh my God.” He stops, covers his face with his hands for a moment. “It’s about what feels good,” he says from between his fingers. “You do whatever feels good, for as long as it feels good, okay, until it feels
Before he can think the better of it—or think at all—Dean rips off his socks and climbs into the tub. The showerhead sticks out far enough that if he manages to get it working the water should overshoot him. Probably.
There’s silence on the other side of the door and all at once Castiel remembers: it’s not locked.
