Cas would have bet that he’d wake up tons of times that night, with his omega all restless like he’d been when he’d gone to bed. Instead, the next time he woke up, he was well rested and his inner clock told him that it was about time to get up.
Apparently, that was not how human gift exchanging rituals worked, though. Dean huffed and said, “You’re not supposed to
Cas averted his gaze at that, but Dean didn’t have time to figure out what Cas’ shifty eyes were all about. Instead, he had a proposition to make.
But instead of putting his dick inside of him like any sane alpha would when confronted with an omega in heat who presented for him, Dean
It got a bit awkward because everyone assumed he was the pup’s alpha—which he was, but they also assumed they were together, which… yeah, Cas wished.
“No, I mean, my heart was aching, too. I wanted you to be happy, I just didn’t want you to be happy with
Oh. Well, he was Dean’s brother, of course they’d want to spend time together. Cas wasn’t one of those omegas who couldn’t spend a few days apart from his alpha.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted him and waited for Castiel to look at him before he continued, “You don’t have to pretend with me. I don’t care if you use magic to clean your cabin, or if you have some weird ritual where you blow sand in people’s faces. I mean, a little warning would have been nice, but… Point being, I’m glad you’re enjoying this and you don’t have to justify yourself for it, okay?”
Dean was easy to talk to and even though Cas usually felt uncomfortable in the presence of strangers, especially alphas, he somehow felt… comfortable. At ease.
His cheek softly grazed Dean’s and—whoa! Those were some cheek-grazing skills Jimmy got there. Felt kind of nice.
“All right, I agree to the modification of our arrangement. I wouldn’t mind saving twenty dollars an hour just by letting you scent me back.”
It hadn’t just been ‘bad luck,’ but Cas decided not to get into that again. Instead, he took a deep breath and said, talking quickly to get it all out, “Anyway, Doctor Fuller said that as long as the scent is comforting to me and makes me feel safe, the chances are good that regular scentings will help prevent further incidents, so I’m thinking of finding an alpha to scent. And I need you to tell me that that’s a good idea.”
“Yes, in front of other people. But Dean never wanted to get mated, so he doesn’t role play these things just for fun.”
“Who…” Dean began asking, but Gabe was already kicking open the bedroom door, dragging a suitcase behind him, which was about half his size.
According to Dean, one hour wasn’t really a long time to scent. He had quoted some study that showed that regular,
Sam finally gave up on the cufflinks altogether and added, “I’m gonna go change.” He was already walking away when he turned around again. “Cas is obviously into you, too. Don’t make this more complicated than it needs to be.”
alphasexual, he quickly created an account and started his own thread, keeping it short and to the point: ‘Is it alphasexual to fantasize about fucking another alpha in the ass?’
Having Cas back in his bed felt right on so many levels. No ‘don’t touch me’ vibe coming off of Cas this time. Instead, the omega actually inched closer to him, and if those weren’t ‘hug me’ signals he was sending—well, then tough because Dean was pulling him into his arms anyway.
While Dean got undressed and carelessly threw his clothes onto the bench, Cas’ mind was a whirlwind.
Giving Dean the cold shoulder had felt vindicating at first. He wanted to make the alpha feel bad because
.” Then he sighed and rubbed a hand across his face. When he spoke up again, his voice was small and exhausted, “I just want to not feel scared. Can I just… not be scared for once?”
But he had gotten comfortable around Dean, actually enjoying the way their scents mixed. These last few times Dean had come over, Cas had gotten into the habit of cuddling up against him in order to take in his comforting scent. It wasn’t until then that he realized how much he had missed human contact.
“You reek of heat and human alpha,” Raphael said, his voice clipped. “He was seconds away from trying to get you with nephilim.”
Cas exhibited all the signals of an omega ripe for claiming. He was enthusiastically encouraging Dean to kiss every place on his body (well not
It all came to a head at the end of summer, when he was just about to go relax in his hot tub one evening—and found it already occupied.
Neither of them noticed when their noses found each other’s scent glands on instinct while they were already half asleep.
He kept wondering what Cas was up to. Had he already been to the doctor? Did he have a sonogram picture? Did he know the sex of the baby?
Either way, for the first time since the accident, some (small) part of the world finally made sense again.
When the question of what had led to the decision to break the bond came up, Castiel thought about Amelia and what she had said before she had left him. He thought about the way his whole body seemed electrically charged whenever Dean was near him.
He wriggled his ass in an attempt to get the alpha to start fucking him already, eliciting a grunt from Dean.
He was barely able to hold his alpha back from doing just that. He could not hold back a testy remark, though, “You know, if you’re parading around in front of alphas like that, don’t be surprised if your ass ends up paying the price.”
He greedily swallowed down his come and then had to pull out so that he could spray Cas’ ass with his own come before he aimed right for his hole.
Rolling on top of him, Dean deepened the kiss. One hand wandered down to Cas’ waist and—was that omega arousal he could smell? Probably just a normal morning wood situation going on there. Dean could relate. Boy, could he ever relate!
“Aaand that is my cue to leave,” Sam said. Oh, right. Sam was there, too. Castiel had almost forgotten. “See you soon.” Sam nodded at Castiel and held his hand out towards Dean.
Dean decided to take advantage of the opportunity presented to him and ducked down to take a quick whiff of Cas’ scent gland. And then another one because Cas waking up early in the morning was a scent he could really get behind.
“So—what’s the message say?” Dean nodded towards the paper, so Castiel read it to him, even though he probably couldn’t understand the language.
It was old and worn—it had obviously been read a lot, and when Dean looked at the title (‘Knot Your Typical Alpha’), he realized that it was some sort of romance novel. The cover suggested it might even be an erotic novel. Perfect!
Scenting time had long since become cuddling time, interspersed with some light petting (and maybe a bit of heavy petting). In any case, Cas had been on board and had even initiated some things between them. Those signals he’d been sending Dean were part of why he’d decided to ask Cas for something more permanent to begin with.
“Oh.” Cas actually looked surprised. As if he hadn’t just enthusiastically participated in their little game of prepping each other for mating. What did he think it
Stuart motioned for Castiel to sit down in the chair in front of Zachariah’s desk and then left, closing the door behind him.
Only by the time the orange light started to fade and Hannah had sunken to her knees, the witch was still caught between the realms.
that omega for all he was worth. He’d start by tenderly nosing along his neck and then, once he’d gotten him to expose his throat completely, it might lead to a rougher, more desperate scenting…
“I fail to see how that’s any of your business,” Cas interrupted him with a dangerous edge to his voice.
you,” Dean retorted. “I almost gave you a mating bite, would have if you hadn’t stopped me. I think those should have been clues enough.”
And Sam was off talking about the symbiotic relationship between humans and cuddlibi, the advantages a cuddle session had for both species, and the different kinds of physical intimacy cuddlibi fed on.
They had been playing around, Dean’s alpha delighting in pretend-chasing the omega around and then Cas had looked at him all… ready to be kissed. Almost as if he had been waiting for it. And for a second, it had been perfect, Cas’ lips against his, soft and pliant, tasting of
“Good thinkin’!” Dean agreed and helped him out of his shirt before shedding his own. Luckily, he didn’t question why he had to get rid of his shirt as well since ‘better access to Castiel’s neck’ didn’t really apply.
Ha! He had known his purifying oils would do the trick! All the alpha had needed in addition was an omega’s gentle mouth teasing his cock a bit.
Today was a cuddle day and since it was already evening, it wouldn’t be long until he had Cas back in his bed… uhm, arms, which put Dean in a good mood.
“I thought we could—” Castiel started upon entering Dean’s room, but the alpha was already on him, pushing him against the wall and licking into his mouth with a dangerous kind of hunger that made Castiel’s skin tingle and his heart race.
His hair tickled Dean’s chin and Dean had no idea where to put his hands. Around Cas’ shoulders or onto his hips would be the obvious solution, but both seemed way too intimate.
“Hey, you okay?” Dean asked, which was a stupid question because obviously, Jimmy was nowhere near ‘okay.’
So, yes, telling Dean to go and sleep in his own bed, alone, was the rational thing to do. And Castiel was nothing if not rational.
as soon as Dean offered up his own neck for scenting purposes. No more timid search for his scent gland, no more careful little sniffs. Instead, he was really going to town on his scent gland, probably in an attempt to pick up on any trace of a scent.
Sooner or later, Castiel said something to scare them off, though, which Dean seemed to find amusing. But Dean had already had some alcoholic beverages, so his human body might just find things amusing because of the alcohol in his bloodstream.
Since Cas was up in heaven, real touches were out of the question for the time being—which was a good thing because Dean wasn’t supposed to get it on with his cupid.
Dean didn’t quite know what to say. This was a weird secret. Why hadn’t Cas just said that in the first place? Best friend cuddles trump normal friend cuddles—seemed pretty straightforward. Unless there was something he was leaving out. Maybe he wasn’t as oblivious to Dean’s feelings as he pretended to be? Could he tell just by cuddling him that Dean’s feelings went a lot deeper than simple friendship?
“I think it’s great that you want to read up on that,” Cas said because he had gotten a glimpse of the chapter title (‘Pregnancy Heat’). “But maybe you should trust your instincts more.”
“You’ve got pretty eyes,” he mumbled, but it might also have been ‘shitty pies’ or ‘lies’ or a thousand other things that would make much more sense for Dean to say, so Cas didn’t read too much into it and certainly didn’t let his poor heart swell with happiness.
Cas’ mating gland, it was pretty obvious that this omega was ready to be mated. Even though he wasn’t in heat, Dean had successfully prepared him for a mating bite.
As soon as he would go into heat, Michael would be on him, whether he was ready or not. That’s what an omega was for, after all.
His ass made obscene squelching sounds when the alpha pushed copious amounts of lube into it, slicking it up to imitate an omega’s lubricated channel so that his cock would be able to slide in and out of it more easily.
Trying to calm everyone down, Castiel quickly said, “I don’t think that’s meant in a hostile way. Maybe they want to come and help.”
Having Dean bite at his neck had been exhilarating—as was wearing his mark, even if it hadn’t been intended as a claim but was just the result of a macho alpha thing Cas still didn’t quite understand.
“Sorry,” he mumbled and got on with it, scenting in the direction of the penis to get a better understanding of the kind of magic involved.
With a sudden surge of anger, Castiel buried Anna’s file among the others so that he didn’t have to look at it anymore.
So yes, he had a lot of practice squishing his omega instincts—every time Dean smiled that crooked smile at him or teased him about being geeky, following that up with a “But you know I love you for it” accompanied by a buddy shoulder bump.
Cas could relate. He maneuvered them around so he could close the door, all the while keeping his own face buried in Dean’s neck.
Yes, Cas had done that once before, but usually, it was Dean playing with the omega’s mating gland, not the other way around, which was why he had started questioning whether Cas even wanted to go down that road with him. After all, when they had spent Cas’ heat together, he hadn’t wanted Dean to bite his mating gland. Granted, they had just gotten together then, but still.
Seeing his pup for the first time, all snug inside Cas’ uterus, little heart beating away—Dean knew at that moment that he’d give anything for Cas to allow him to stick around. For any future appointments, for the birth, for after the birth… because there was no way he could go his whole life without ever holding his pup in his arms.
Finally—finally!—Jimmy felt safe enough at his place to fall asleep. Or maybe he was just exhausted enough. Something had to give sooner or later after all, with him being up most nights.
At the beginning of all of this, Cas had only thought about how he desperately wanted to get pregnant. He hadn’t even considered how much
“Now, hang on,” Sam held him back when he had just gotten up, intending to leave. “He said that he didn’t give you the position because of your secondary gender designation?”
A teasing smirk flitted across Dean’s face as he said, voice laced with mirth, “Yeah, I did.” His eyebrows did a weird mating dance, which made Castiel squint at him in order to figure out the secret meaning behind the alpha’s behavior.
It was late when they arrived at Cas’ place and they had already had their scenting session for the day—for the whole week, really, since they’d done nothing
He scented the air, and sure enough, he would recognize that scent anywhere. He felt a smile spread across his face—the first genuine one since he had heard about Alfie and Balthazar—and he walked faster.
Dean rolled his eyes and booped Cas’ nose, which only made the omega squint harder. “I’m teasing,” Dean said. When that didn’t make the confused frown disappear from Cas’ face, he explained, “I’m showing affection, too.”
He sometimes imagined what the alpha might be doing while wearing them. The red plaid shirt (he’d gotten that one twice already) had once smelled a bit like motor oil. Castiel assumed that meant the alpha liked working with cars. Sometimes, he picked up on traces of apple pie, so the alpha obviously liked pie.
After all, he had ordered the full package. With his alpha going crazy, he had to make sure he wouldn’t unintentionally do something that wasn’t allowed and would land him in jail. The ‘full package’ meant he’d have Cas for the rest of his rut, could fuck him as often as his alpha wanted to and in whatever position his alpha desired.
having any dirty thoughts, his soft dick just lying snug against Dean’s stomach, only separated by the thin fabric of their pajamas.
He knew Cas couldn’t get drunk on alcohol, at least not unless he went on a full-blown bender. Could he get drunk off just the right kind of touch? Suddenly, he wanted nothing more but to find out.
Cas had decided to enjoy the feeling of being in love. The jittery feeling in his belly whenever Dean was smiling at him actually felt rather nice. So did the flutter of electricity running through his body at every touch.
Unfortunately, in his case, it was apparently ‘be killed.’ Up till now, his visions had always come true. Which meant that even if he tried to kill Dean, he would inevitably fail—thus rendering any attempt futile.
But Castiel knew that she was well aware of the reason, so he didn’t say anything, and instead took another sip from his hot cocoa. He couldn’t really taste it the way he could taste cuddles, but counting the molecules was comforting anyway. Plus, it warmed him up a bit.
“Oh?” Castiel turned around just as Dean stepped up to the counter, giving him his signature bright smile that always left Castiel’s heart aflutter.
Maybe his magic was responsible for that or maybe it just seemed that way, but it didn’t matter anyway because slow motion or not, there was nothing Castiel could do to prevent the inevitable. Dean would see her—whether in a second or in a slowed-down second was irrelevant at this point.
All of that inevitably led his omegas—both his own and his game character’s—to feel courted, and his crush was getting worse—which was ridiculous because it was just a
The omega felt so incredible, squeezing him in all the right places, that Dean couldn’t hold back any longer. He started to slowly fuck Jimmy, pulling back and sliding all the way back in again, pushing in and out of his slippery hole while holding on to his hips for leverage.
When the alpha had paid for the books, asking if a pretty omega like him had plans for the night, Cas had quickly told him that he was about to close up and luckily, the alpha had finally gotten the message and left him alone.
Dean let Jimmy’s cock slip out from between his lips, earning himself a whimper of protest. Ignoring it, he fucked his fingers into Jimmy one last time to make sure he was slick enough and then made quick work of his own clothes, freeing his poor neglected cock.
The file of the omega was attached and Dean almost did a double take when his eyes were drawn to the picture of ‘Castiel.’ This omega looked like he could have his pick of alphas to impregnate him.
Dean started moaning as if he was a virgin alpha in rut getting his very first blowjob, his hips thrusting slightly as he worked his cock slowly down Castiel’s throat.
like any other morning. He actually hoped to get offered the biggest job opportunity of his career today. He’d worked his ass off for this, and finally, all his hard work was about to pay off.
“Castiel,” Anael chimed in, diplomatic as always, “you know how dangerous hunters can be. How could you bring one into our community?”
Dean immediately gave chase, running after the omega at full speed—and the next second, he was chasing Jimmy in the gym.
! They should have met at a motel, like usual. Then none of this would be happening. But here they were, his two worlds colliding in a way that had
“Doctor Wright is expecting you. His examination will reveal the truth.” Zachariah made a gesture for him to follow, but Castiel found it hard to get up from his chair. His legs didn’t want to cooperate.
The fact that he could dominate Cas physically without so much as breaking a sweat was something his alpha took great pride in. Granted, Cas hadn’t put up a fight, but the fact that Cas
That was kind of strange, but Cas was feeling way too good as a result of a powerful orgasm to analyze the alpha’s behavior more closely.
He told Sam about Cas’ crazy behavior, but his tipsy mind made his mouth stumble over a few words, so then he had to ignore Sam chewing him out for drinking too much (
In response, Dean pulled the omega back into his arms. No reason for Jimmy to have to hug himself if Dean was right there to do it. Of course, there was no way he could just walk out right now with Jimmy smelling sad and scared.
So, after the shock of smelling slick where there should have been none, the world made sense again. For a little while at least.
Sam asked a series of questions, starting with how his head and shoulder were doing (fine), if he needed a new prescription for more pain medication (no), and finally the questions turned to his sense of smell (no, it hadn’t returned).
Even though there was no touching between them apart from Dean’s mouth on his mating gland (and his hand on the back of his head to steady him), Castiel’s dick, which had been aroused since the fight, found the proceedings more than exciting. Being teased by your mate would do that to you.
“Yeah,” Dean said. “But if we’re not taking any chances here, we should definitely sleep together. I mean in the same bed. Like we did the last couple of nights. Not
He hadn’t really craved a knot, anyway, but a scent. A certain someone’s scent, to be exact. His heart had ached for that scent, and his stomach had ached because… well, Cas didn’t know why, and basically
Cas led them into the living room and as soon as Dean’s ass hit the couch, Cas was pressed against his side to get better access to his neck.
Only now, he was picking up something new and intriguing in Cas’ scent, something that made him scent for it more aggressively until he was satisfied he had gotten to the bottom of things.
The hour came and went and Cas didn’t want to tell him that the time was up, so he just conveniently forgot to mention it, hoping that Dean wouldn’t realize how much time had passed.
The obvious solution was that he’d have to get them into a compromising position that would give Impala no other options but to take him again.
As a matter of fact, he was really curious about scenting Jimmy. And since they were courting now, they were totally allowed to do it. It wasn’t like they had to be wary of some friendship line they weren’t supposed to cross anymore. Scenting counted as perfectly normal courting behavior.
This was the alpha of his future pup. That's why he was being so emotional and needy. That’s all it was.
He was all out of witty comebacks for that one, so Dean just sighed and opened the door a bit wider so that Cas could slip in. If he just turned him away, he’d probably end up drinking another bottle of whatever alcoholic beverage he could find. He carelessly put the bag on the floor—it wasn’t like he needed his old cell anymore anyway, and waited for Cas to say whatever else he needed to say.
to do. Especially on the last day of an omega’s heat, the omega didn’t necessarily need an alpha to fuck him. He just needed a lot of affection, and since Cas’ hole still hadn’t recovered from being so thoroughly abused, Dean decided that a little bit of cuddly affection was just what Cas needed.
And what was Dean supposed to do? Tell him to keep his mouth from brushing against his neck while scenting? All that would do was embarrass Cas—and his soft lips did feel nice on Dean’s neck, so there was that.
see it… It’s not like one person gets to make unilateral decisions where relationships are concerned…”
He didn’t, though. That would be weird, scenting a stranger while they were staring at each other, standing in the open doorway.
the alpha. Dean should respect that instead of stalking the poor omega who had just wanted his seed.
Once he was alone again, Castiel thought back to his visit to Earth. Or, well, to Dean. Something very strange was going on with his stomach whenever he thought about the human alpha. Plus, he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his other charges for
While Cas’ omega felt ecstatic that Dean cared so much about him, there was no way he’d let the stupid alpha get himself hurt just because of some protective instincts he didn’t have under control.
That was okay, though, because Cas also got a lot of things that he wanted. For one, they had so much fun on their dates. Dean even took him to a bee museum, which was utterly fascinating.
The following days were even harder to be apart, probably because the clothes lost their Cas smell bit by bit. It was like Dean’s nose missed Cas’ scent gland and there was nothing Dean could do but pine for Cas and long for the day he could drive home.
, and even though it had felt absolutely fantastic, it had also been exhausting, and so Cas just turned to snuggle a bit more closely against Dean, never even opening his eyes.
Of course, with all the wooing and the claiming, his omega got ready to be mated. Unfortunately, their scent-bond partner agreement said that they wouldn’t spend their heats and ruts together.
to sleep with that. C’mere.” He opened his arms, waiting patiently for Cas to hesitantly step up to him before pulling him into a full body hug.
He would just give Dean his most powerful purifying bath oils (even though they were very difficult to make), tell him the steps he had to take to complete the ritual, and that would be it. He probably should have done that to begin with. The curse that couldn’t be counteracted by that ritual had yet to be invented, so he was confident that this time around, Dean would leave a satisfied customer.
But when their lips had met in that gentlest of kisses, just softly brushing against each other, his omega hadn’t been able to accept it as a normal alpha friendship-type sign of affection. Surely, that wasn’t what alphas did with each other.
, and his alpha craved a bit more today. The musky scent of alpha, not the sweet one of an omega that more often than not just made him want to gag. A naked alpha fight, skin on skin, erections touching in the process while both tried to get the other one to forfeit…
Cas just nodded into the pillow because it wasn’t like he was sad exactly—he was just… He had no idea what was going on with him. He could always blame the hormones.
“I don’t think so,” Dean said, and Castiel tilted his head at him, trying to figure out what he meant.
“Hm,” Cas said and gave the mating gland another lick, this time a bit more sure of himself. “That’s because of the mating hormones,” he told Dean.
Once he’d bottomed out, he stilled, cuddled him close, and kissed Cas’ neck, forehead, and lips. He couldn’t believe that he was inside of Cas. God, he loved that cuddlibus so much!
“You’re not making any sense, dude.” He did seem serious, though, and he was a very bad actor, so maybe he wasn’t a pawn in Sam’s retaliation prank, after all. “How do you even know you’re into alphas?”
“I think the owner of my sex shop is stealing from me,” Dean told Sam as soon as he answered the phone.
Ever since that comment, Cas couldn’t get the thought out of his head that maybe, he was leading Dean on—which was a dangerous game to play with any alpha.
A cold shiver ran down his spine when he saw the text. The next second, the cell phone slipped from his fingers and dropped to the floor.
Since they were still sitting in darkness, he turned on the bedside lamp and asked, “So what, this is just a dream?”
A few minutes later, Dean’s cock was plunging in and out of his asshole while Castiel was holding on to the bedframe, barely hanging on while being fucked so vigorously that he had trouble keeping his ass up. Apparently, the curse had not affected Dean’s refractory period.
Now that he knew what to scent for, he could pick up on it, under layers of this stupid alpha scent.
“We don’t want to end up scent-bonded,” Cas explained. “Having heat sex will make us predisposed. I don’t think scenting while I’m in heat is a good idea.”
Dean plunged his hands into Cas’ feathers, holding on for leverage as he began giving him what he needed.
Nibbling all along his neck, he passed his mating gland multiple times without paying it any attention. Every time, Cas thought he might give it a lick, which sent tingles of anticipation all through his body, but Dean just licked all around it. Cas could feel his mating gland swell anyway because of all the love he was given.
Castiel dropped everything (it wasn’t like he had been able to concentrate on his work anyway) and hurried down to legal.
“No. It might still take weeks or even months for him to pick up on anything. We simply don’t know.”
“Okay, that’s it! We’re done talking about this!” He used his no-nonsense voice to put an end to this discussion. Although in retrospect, he should have known that the angel would just ignore it.
It was a challenge. Not an invitation for sexual activities as it would be among mates, when an omega running away from his alpha would prompt the alpha to pursue, catch and ultimately fuck the omega. No, in the courting phase, it was all about catching and
The chipper tone of voice might have fooled Castiel before. But not anymore. Things were certainly not ‘cool.’
He had no idea if that even worked on other alphas, but whatever the reason, Cas’ beautiful blue eyes opened again and found his.
That didn’t sound like a good idea. If he followed his omega’s instincts, he would sink to his knees in front of Dean or roll over, belly up. That was most likely not what Sam had in mind.
But here was the thing: Castiel was great at his job. And the reason was: Love was easy. It was simple math, really. You just had to find the right person and minimize the chances of divorce.
?” he continued. When Cas was tilting his head, clearly not on board yet, he went on to explain, “I read somewhere that
It started out with quick closed-mouth kisses, but somehow they got competitive over it and it ended with Castiel climbing onto Dean’s lap while tongues got involved.
Dean was very careful and the slight prickling sensation when he found a feather that had to go didn’t feel unpleasant like he would have expected.
New plan. Dean was only annoyed because Castiel had been too obvious. All he had to do was pretend not to be in love with him and Dean would be none the wiser. The lesson in lying would no doubt come in very handy.
?!” Dean actually paused mid-thrust to look down at what was going on with Castiel’s own dick, which was lying hard against his stomach.
Stupid Balthazar and his stupid rules! How long did he expect Cas to live like this? It wasn’t like they had made much progress. Mike was still out there, hurting omegas. Meanwhile, all Cas got were empty phrases like ‘bound to make a mistake’ or ‘we have to be patient.’
That statement was followed by another one of those smiles that made it impossible for Castiel not to mirror it. It sometimes left him floating on air—quite literally, which was one of the disadvantages of being a witch in love.
Since then, he had gone back to ‘Casa Erotica’ two more times. After all, he could use the slick to enhance the experience of some alone time too, no need to wait around for his next rut.
That round went to them as Michael just shot them a dark look while his face did a strange thing where he forced his lips into a poor imitation of a smile.
“Don’t sweat it,” Dean said, casual as always. “That just means your reflexes are working fine. Wouldn’t be doing my job right if I didn’t get you to, you know…”
Castiel’s mating gland (the one in the present, not in the future) started pulsing and throbbing pleasantly.
“I have no idea who you are,” the man said, although the binoculars on the passenger seat gave him away. “I’m here to catch Mr Olderman’s mate cheating on him.” He pointed at the Oldermans’ residence across the street.
The smell of omega in distress hit him first and then he saw how pale Cas was, trembling and looking up at him with wide, terrified eyes.
After all, here was his naked mate right next to him kissing and licking his mating bite, which among mates was absolutely a form of foreplay.
Dean took a quick sip from his beer, which gave him something to do while he was coming up with a reply. “Just trying to figure out since when Benny speaks geek.”
His alpha, who was already draped all over Bees, nudged the omega to get him into scenting position and then started sniffing at his neck.
It had been rather hard to hold himself back from getting even more inappropriate with Cas than he had already been. There hadn’t really been a lot of platonic thoughts left inside his head when it came to the angel. After all, Cas was the whole package: nice, funny (in his own way), geeky (which had somewhere along the way become a turn-on for Dean), with a scent to die for—and don’t even get him started on those unnaturally good looks and huge wings Dean had quickly developed a kink for.
“Yes.” Cas looked down at the piece of paper again and read out what he had come up with so far, “‘Alpha Needed: Looking for an alpha with a calming scent, preferably mated, for scenting purposes. Twice a week, one hour. Pay: $20 per hour plus expenses.’ Does that sound okay? I’m not sure if I should clarify that it is just me scenting him and not the other way around.”
A beeping sound interrupted their cuddle time. Dean quickly disentangled himself from Cas so that he could get the smartwatch to shut the fuck up.
Of course, he was very aware of Sam’s presence when baring his throat, making for an awkward moment where he almost got a crick in his neck.
Saturday was date night, which this time around meant dinner and a movie with some handholding in the last row of the movie theater.
The week together with Cas had been awesome! For once, he didn’t have to uphold the image of the tough alpha. Cas hadn’t made fun of him when he had given in to his instincts and taken care of the omega with all the cuddles and affection his alpha had to give. And of course there had been the mind-blowing sex.
Just then, a shadow flitted past the window. He’d seen it before. But only ever out of the corner of his eye. He’d felt its presence before, too. But only as through a veil.
“But… He kisses you!” he pointed out. He’d definitely seen Balthazar kiss Jimmy good-bye, that’s not what you did if you were just friends.
“Are you using a new cologne?” he asked and—fuck!—scooted closer to take a whiff right from his scent gland.
Thinking back to their agreement that anyone could back out at any time, Dean asked, “Up for another round?”
Actually, lightly pressing his lips against Cas’ temple, cheek, and neck felt very comfortable. Enjoyable. Could be a new hobby of his.
He felt a bit bad for taking up more of Dean’s time when technically, the alpha wasn’t getting paid for the extra hour, but if the company was offering a discount, he really wanted to have Dean’s scent around for a while longer. And Dean’s arms that were so warm around him. And Dean’s mouth that had gone back to kissing along his neck. Okay, he just wanted
“I didn’t…” Dean began, but was interrupted by Cas, “Is it because you taught me that watching someone sleep is creepy? Because I should tell you—I rather enjoy being watched over for a change. You can watch me sleep whenever you feel like it.”
Dean didn’t have to be told twice. He pushed Cas down once more to keep him from fidgeting and then started ‘massaging’ his ass so hard, Cas couldn’t do anything but hold on to the table while Dean’s cock fucked in and out of his ass, dragging against Cas’ prostate in a way that made him desperate to be fucked even harder.
When Dean was silent for a moment too long, Cas realized that he had never even told him about the panic attacks to begin with.
What was more, Cas realized that Dean might have been aroused during their scentings before. He had realized that Dean’s scent had occasionally turned especially delicious. Could Dean have been aroused those times, too? And if he was, what did it mean?
Dean licked his way into his mouth, rotating his hips so that their dicks kept rubbing together, chasing away any thoughts about the bet.
He felt a bit like a stalkerish omega, but this alpha was using his slick to get off, so he figured he was allowed to creep on his scent a bit. After all, it was the kind of scent that would make any omega drool.
Trying to slip out of the bed turned out to be harder than he thought, though, because Cas followed him, pulling him closer again and mumbling, “The hour isn’t up yet.”
He wondered if Dean was being all cuddly with the omega. If he was knotting him—or her. Maybe he preferred female omegas. Were they lying in bed right now, and Dean was holding the omega the way he had held Castiel? Probably. Dean was a very affectionate alpha, after all.
Coincidentally, that meant that Dean didn’t have to do any more research on angels, either, because they could trade off, satisfying their curiosity about each other’s species.
Over the next few days, he repeatedly played around with Cas’ mating gland, but that was as far as it ever went, and Cas could tell that there was no real intent behind it.
Dean began fondling his dick then, and the sensations were too much. When Cas finally found sweet release, Dean fucked him right through his orgasm with long, deep strokes as he told him, “Love you, so much!” before kissing him again.
On the plus side, Dean’s brain was catching up with what they were talking about here. Cas touching his dick… Cool… That was… yeah.
At first, he tried to ignore it, but it didn’t get any better and finally, it hurt bad enough that Castiel had to go to the doctor to have it checked out. It would be just his luck to have it get infected.
Cas could always blame the fact that he himself was still caught somewhere between sleep and wakefulness for why he just leaned in himself until their lips met in a short and sweet kiss. More of a peck really. Not much of a difference to Dean kissing him on the cheek. Except that it was on the lips.
He’d also say things like, “How’s my little family doing?” which was most likely meant as a joke, but it never failed to make Castiel’s
A claiming meant that the alpha and omega in question were off the market for the courting period after which they could decide if they were willing to go further or not.
Dean had pointed out that it was funny that the last letters of Bees’ username were the first of his own and that their couple name would be ‘beesareimpala.’
One moment, Jimmy was mumbling something unintelligible in response to Dean’s tale of how he had to properly maintain Baby, the next the alpha had nodded off and was actually snoring ever so softly.
As excuses went, that one seemed a bit flimsy, but plausible deniability was all he needed in case Cas asked about why he was all but cuddling him. He didn’t ask, though, so Dean got bold and scent marked him. That was absolutely something mates would do.
He hadn’t made it out of the living room yet when he ran into the cause of his sleepless night, barefoot and looking soft and snuggly in Dean’s favorite sleeping robe.
Looking at him with sad eyes, Anna heaved a heavy-hearted sigh. “You don’t want to cuddle with him anymore?” she repeated, prompting him to explain himself.
Cas didn’t say anything for a few long seconds. When he spoke again, he was just as calm as before. “Dean—this has always been the plan.”
Not that Dean minded. In fact, if Cas was scenting him so thoroughly, he figured he was allowed a quick whiff himself, so he sought out the omega’s scent gland in return and breathed in the awesome scent.
Dean hummed, signaling that he understood, even though he didn’t really. That’s why he checked to make sure, “Because I’m human?”
Cas had woken up with slick between his ass cheeks a couple more times. Luckily, Dean never made a big deal out of it. In return, Cas ignored it when he smelled alpha arousal. It was just a natural biological reaction to being close to the man you were scent-bonded to.
That was strange, the only change in scents was supposed to be during an alpha’s rut, and that’s when the smell would be
The worst part? He might never get to see Dean again. For some reason, that thought made his eyes burn.
The worst part was that Cas’ omega had felt rejected, even though he couldn’t figure out why. Going through heat while his omega was suffering from rejection had not been easy.
“It tastes like you,” Cas replied slowly, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “Like your scent. I guess it feels like scenting and cuddling for humans, too, only I feed off it.”
“Well, we’re not in a cuddle relationship anymore, so you can cuddle whoever you want,” Castiel said, and made yet another attempt to get around Dean and to his room.
Just to make sure Dean wasn’t mad at him for questioning his tactics, he added, “I didn’t mean to insult your skills as a hunter. I merely meant that you do not fit the picture of the evil hunter out to get little witches.”
Cas heaved a content sigh. This. This was what had been missing during his heat. Dean’s smell and arms around him, making the butterflies in his stomach do somersaults.
“Don’t be ridiculous. You said jobs have been a bit scarce lately,” Cas pointed out. “Plus, we will Skype every day, and we have each other’s clothes.”
“Yes, that’s—yeah,” Dean agreed and then everything felt so much better when they had gotten rid of their shirts and Cas could snuggle against Dean’s warm skin. Dean’s hands were now on Cas’ naked hips, just resting there while Dean kissed Cas softly, slipping him some tongue when Cas invited him to by opening his mouth before going back to his neck.
Again, his sense of humor was lost on Cas. “I mean it, Dean. Don’t let me hurt you,” he said, holding himself stiff as a board.
Cas smelled! Last time, the omega had been close to heat and in heat, so he had thought that was part of the reason his smell had made Dean’s head spin.
He woke up at some point in the night to the feeling of lips softly grazing his cheek, slight stubble tickling his skin.
Once they were done, he carried him back to their nest bridal-style (ignoring Cas’ surprised squeak), where he hand fed him some grapes.
Thinking back to how Dean had been interested in seeing Cas’ nipples, Cas suggested, “We could take off our shirts. I’m sure skin-on-skin contact would help settle your alpha and my omega.” After all, they were still clearly desperate for each other even now that they were in each other’s arms.
After trying out different positions that were less than ideal because they didn’t give Dean the room to work with, they relocated to Dean’s bed where Cas wouldn’t need to worry about rolling right over the edge onto the floor.
“So…” Cas took a deep breath, ready to give Dean the out he needed. “You don’t have to stick around here. Help is on the way…”
Of course he should be, going by his vision. It was hard to be scared of Dean, though, when he had just saved him from having his magic sucked out of him, brought him back to the safety of his cabin and was even fluffing his pillow for him when he thought Castiel might get uncomfortable. It didn’t really spell big, bad hunter alpha.
“What’s it feel like for you?” he asked, letting his fingertips dance over Cas’ skin, hoping that it felt half as good for him as it did for Dean.
Dean had realized early on that going for Jimmy’s back even in a pretend way made the alpha highly uncomfortable, most likely due to his injuries. He had never reacted like this though. He twisted around, instantly cowering down in front of Benny, his neck bared as he made himself as submissive as possible, whimpering for mercy.
And then he did. About the alpha scent and pretending to be an alpha because that had been part of the whole relocation plan to keep him hidden. About the scars on his back and what they really stood for. About how much he had wanted to tell Dean ever since his omega had felt safe enough in the alpha’s presence.
With those words, Cas walked off toward the bedroom. Obviously, he didn’t trust Dean not to get caught.
The doctor cleared his throat and started, “After examining the omega thoroughly, I can say with certainty that he is, in fact, mated.”
Since his vision had come true, Castiel had no idea if he would ever see Dean again. After all, the curse had been lifted and there was no reason for the alpha to come back to his neck of the woods.
“I mean… sure,” he said, even though he wasn’t sure if he understood correctly. “But then I’d have to…” He motioned between Cas and himself, hoping to convey something between ‘sleep in the same bed as you’ and ‘try to stop my alpha from cuddling your omega to death.’
Even though Cas offered to help clean the dishes, Dean just shooed him away to get comfortable on his couch while he was taking care of things.
“Uhm…” Dean said, sure that he’d be able to come up with a better excuse if Cas just gave him a couple more minutes.
Luckily, some kind of instinct was taking over. Dean found a blanket to wrap around Cas and then climbed onto the couch next to him and pulled Cas’ head against his neck.
In the end, it looked like Dean had been cocky for a reason. After multiple failed attempts, he finally managed to pin Castiel to the floor once more, a smug expression on his face that told him the alpha was already sure he had won the fight.
Damn, it did look enticing. The couch had been pulled out so that there was more room, and joke or not, it looked like an awesome nest, offering just the kind of safety Cas’ omega was yearning for.
“I’ll stop talking if you agree to come over for a welcome-to-the-neighborhood barbecue on Friday,” he offered, trying to salvage what he could. It would be a shame if he had ruined the friendship before it had ever gotten a chance of becoming one.
Feeling his stomach do a strange little flip, he reciprocated the scenting, enjoying the closeness and at the same time dreading the moment the minute would be up.
Not really. But he couldn’t leave Dean completely in the dark, unaware of the danger he might be in by staying close to Cas.
Cas took the crown between his soft lips for just a few seconds before he pulled back to place a kiss on the tip of his cock.
With a flick of the hand, the flasks and vials quickly rearranged themselves on the shelves, clinking together slightly in their haste to find their place again.
Castiel swallowed and requested that private room. He had come this far, there was no turning back now. The beta didn’t seem to care one way or another, just showed him the way and mentioned that another alpha was already waiting inside.
Since the pup was in need of contact from the alpha, they usually walked hand in hand, which Cas had to admit felt rather nice.
With all those touches in a public place where they couldn’t do more, it was no wonder that they were kissing each other deeply and sensually as soon as they were home.
“In any case, you wouldn’t have to pay me anymore. We’d just be like… cuddle buddies, y’know? Scentin’ buddies.”
“Hey, that wasn’t empty!” the alpha protested. But he seemed to accept Castiel’s stipulations, and after a moment, he asked, “You sure that’s all you want? I’d probably give you my first born for this.”
But this wasn’t about intimacy. This was just to show Inias that he wasn’t the only one who had moved on. Naturally, Dean needed better access to Cas’ neck in order to get to work. So, Cas bared his neck for the very first time in Dean’s presence, heart pounding so loudly he was scared Dean might hear it and figure out how nervous he really was about this.
“Cas…” Dean leaned back a bit so that he could look straight into Cas’ eyes. Then he said, “It’s the best ever. Seriously, don’t think for a second I’m not having the time of my life here.”
Only now that they were in their late thirties, their friends were all settling down. Cas’ sister, Anna, already had two pups and a third one on the way, which left no time to come by to give Cas the necessary cuddles. And his oldest friend, Balthazar, had recently moved abroad.
touching—a pat on the back, a chest bump (Cas’ very first in his life—he hadn’t known people outside of movies were doing that), a shoulder squeeze, a poke or a slap on the thigh if they were sitting next to each other and Dean wanted to make him aware of something… Cas had had no idea that alphas touched each other so much.
The only thing that could possibly calm him down was a certain alpha next door. The one thing that might be able to get rid of this feeling of despair was Dean’s scent. But there was no way that he would drag Dean into this. Not when Mike might be on his way to drag Cas back into the hellhole he’d barely survived crawling out of the last time…
He really hoped his face wasn’t as red as it felt because if it was, there was no way Dean wouldn’t figure out just who he’d had sex with in that vision.
Another spike in the alpha’s scent and then he was coming, without Dean ever touching him down there (because why would he touch another alpha’s junk?!). His channel squeezed Dean so exquisitely that he had no choice but to follow, pumping his seed deep into the alpha’s ass.
All in all, Dean was really good at pretending to be the perfect mate. He’d say things like, “Oh God, you
Then he scooted down and slowly lowered Cas’ pants, freeing Cas’ cock, which was a bit shy at first but filled out when Dean brushed against it. The alpha immediately started scenting along his penis, sending goosebumps down Cas’ spine.
How was Castiel supposed to know what to wear for a rut date? He had wanted to look nice. If he had known that Dean would be greeting him in his birthday suit, he might have dressed down a bit.
When he finally got the lube out of the pants pocket, he showed it to Cas, eyebrows raised. Last chance to back out.
“We will hide and intervene if things go sideways,” Benny said, and finally, Hannah nodded her consent.
(He did not, however, stop having breakfast on the patio at the exact same time Cas went for a run. There was no way he’d change his routine just because of one little omega who didn’t know that teasing an alpha for too long could have consequences!)
He was an alpha. He should be the one to fuck omegas. Or maybe betas. Instead, this hunk of an alpha was about to mount
His eyes landed on Cas’ exposed neck, which made him want to do all kinds of things he wasn’t supposed to. After all, scent and mating gland play had been on the list of forbidden sex things.
Cas made a questioning sound, nose still buried in Dean’s neck, and Dean continued, “Scenting all kinds of other places.”
making love. (And pretty much any other time he was looking at Dean, so… okay. He should have recognized it by now.)
Another new aspect of their cuddle relationship: They indulged in some cuddles on the couch from time to time while watching TV because they were great at multitasking like that. According to Cas, a cuddle relationship entailed cuddling outside of feedings, too, so they were pretty much touching any time they were in the same room.
“This isn’t about your feelings for our pup. I am well aware of your love for him, and you should feel free to show that love any way you wish.”
Since Castiel didn’t want Dean to report back to Sam that he had been uncooperative, he got up with a sigh to join Dean on the couch.
Finally, Dean’s mouth traveled from his neck to his jaw and then he captured Cas’ lips with his own in a soft kiss, which was followed by another one, and before Cas knew what was happening, Dean was teasing his lips apart with his tongue.
She didn’t give Dean time to react, but continued as if Dean had already declined, “Oh, come on! The omega is desperate! He needs help.”
Probably Sammy, ready to ream him out again for irresponsible behavior. Wait—hadn’t they just talked on the phone?
Yet, before he could do any of those things, Jimmy stepped on the cell phone and crushed it. Then, he bent down to pick it up and mumbled something about needing to go.
“What—are you kidding me? They’re awesome! Can I touch?” Dean took a step closer, hand halfway outstretched already, but not quite touching yet. Instead, he raised his eyebrows and waited for an answer.
“Don’t worry. Anna didn’t cuddle me,” he mumbled into his shoulder. “I told her you need help falling asleep.”
All Dean’s senses were aware of was the fear in Jimmy’s scent spiking and he quickly put himself between Jimmy and the strange alphas, ready to fight them if need be.
at this gym before. In fact, he’d banged an omega in this very shower room once (which he so would never tell Benny about).
For a second, he thought she had taken his advice and run away. Just to play it safe, he continued to hold Dean back, though, ignoring his soundless screams.
He got a tired smile in return. Since Dean’s hand was already on Cas’ shoulder, he raised it to brush a finger across Cas’ cheek as a mini scent mark hidden behind a ‘chin up!’ gesture. (So much for professional boundaries…)
Suddenly, the alpha’s cockhead hit something deep within him and his toes curled as a tingling sensation shot from his ass straight to his balls.
Cas immediately tilted his head, and hell yeah, Dean could get used to the image of Cas, throat bared and ass full of cock.
All of that was okay. He was happy as a single omega. He could take care of himself. Most mated omegas he knew were unhappily mated anyway. So no, he didn’t need anyone, least of all an alpha.
Working a temp job at an omega service was so not what an omega of his age should be doing. He should have his life figured out, have at the very least a stable job, maybe a mate and a pup or two…
The petty part of Castiel wanted to touch as much as he could, but the ‘nice mate’ part of him won, and he held his alpha back from scent marking every inch of this place.
Since they had spent quite some time together during the last few weeks, Castiel was getting better at picking up on what Dean wasn’t saying. In this case, the question of why Castiel hadn’t told him everything was obvious in Dean’s tone of voice, so he explained, “I thought you might not appreciate getting your hands all slick with my wing oil.”
“It’s me, right?” Dean said, still standing so very close, but his lips were now too far away so that Castiel had to blink his eyes open again. “The thing you want? You’re in love with me?”
Castiel was just on his way to the bathroom when he heard Raphael’s voice drifting over from the hall.
Of course, Balthazar said the same thing he always did, that they were close to catching Mike—which Cas assumed meant they had no idea where he even was.
By that time, Castiel could feel a constant tight pull in his belly, reminding him that he was supposed to spend some time with his fake knot.
To warm up, they did a few laps around the gym. Jimmy was an alpha after all, so with a bit practice, he might be able to outrun an alpha attacker when push came to shove.
Dean could totally see himself singing their pup to sleep. Only, he wouldn’t be around once it was born. Which was such a shame since he was a total pro at this, as evidenced by the soft snoring on the other end of the line when the song came to an end.
As soon as he entered the shop, he could already smell that Gabe had another item of clothing for him to scent. Only—that couldn’t be right. The scent was all-encompassing.
He saw the three dots that told him Cas was texting back, only it took a very long time. The dots stopped, then they started again. A few minutes of back and forth like that and Cas’ message finally came through.
Dean’s sudden appearance had thrown him for a loop, but during lunch (Dean made a mean burger), Cas slowly regained his composure.
The weirdest thing was that the way Dean slipped his arms around his waist and pulled him closer didn’t freak him out. It absolutely should. You didn’t just snuggle with your mortal enemy.
“Oh, no,” Cas interrupted him, a blush spreading quickly up his neck and across his cheeks. “We’re not… I meant… Is there anything I have to do or be aware of when I’m taking care of it on my own?”
When Cas finally got the replacement for his alpha scent, he was relieved beyond belief. As long as he was careful and didn’t let another bottle end up in pieces, there was no way for Dean to scent him out.
Giving each other nicknames was a way to show affection, Cas knew. So, to show Dean that he cared about him, too, Cas answered into the darkness, “Night, honeybee.”
That worked out just fine because Castiel’s omega couldn’t get enough of this alpha. Good thing Dean had acquired his slick.
Finally, the awkwardness of the situation seemed to catch up with Cas, who, while walking Dean to the door, was avoiding eye contact, a blush on his face.
Cas broke the kiss to scent some more, and then he started sniffing at other places, making his way down Dean’s body, scenting every inch.
Once Dean had gone, Cas listened to all of them. He liked Dean’s renditions better, but he still loved the mixtape because Dean had made it for him—probably for when he wouldn’t be around anymore. That was very thoughtful of him, even though Cas didn’t want to think about that yet. Not when they were having so much fun together.
The alpha Dean had picked out this time immediately came over once Castiel had established eye contact. At the very least Castiel was learning a lot about nonverbal human communication tonight.
So, of course, what he said was, “Nope. As long as you’re okay waking up with an alpha on your side of the bed, we’re good.”
The only catch was that Cas got all of his cuddles from his non-human friends since their energy levels wouldn’t get drained the way a human’s would. He actually shied away from Dean’s touch, which was a bit insulting because Dean
“You’re an omega!” he repeated. He hadn’t intended for that to come out all accusing. But somehow, this was harder to swallow than the news that he was trans. Cis alpha or trans alpha didn’t really make that big of a difference in the grand scheme of things—he was still in love with an alpha. But alpha or
gonna have to say no. Seriously, not twenty anymore here. Give me some time before I can get it up again.”
“I don’t know.” Since that obviously wasn’t good enough judging by the look Cas gave him, he tried, “It’s not just
When he caught Castiel’s eye, he would sit up a bit straighter and try to hide the soft smile, but it was too late. Castiel had already seen that he was capable of showing emotions, even if in a rather grumpy ‘I hate you guys’ kind of way that was really code for ‘I love you guys.’
Coaxing slick out of the omega’s hole was easy seeing how aroused Jimmy was. He wasn’t the only one. Dean’s alpha was getting impatient with the need to bury his cock in that ass.
to stay away from him. Dean was funny and considerate (and hot, but that was neither here nor there—neither was the fact that he smelled nice), and Cas soon discovered that not all alphas were knotheads.
He told Dean that he had to return to heaven and didn’t know when he’d be back, which was a lie. Of course, he knew that he
flirting with his asexual best friend anyway? All that cuddling had to have messed with his head. Just because they were in some weird
Cas was pacing up and down in his bedroom, still agitated because of what had happened at the gym. It was always difficult for him to calm down after an incident like that.
Dean kept scenting behind Jimmy’s ear vigorously to try and chase that hint of a scent, but the more he tried to chase it, the further away it seemed. All it did was make Jimmy giggle and wriggle around in his sleep.
Getting ready to cuddle with a stranger was a bit weird. It would be easier if they were here to fuck. At least he knew the etiquette for one-night stands. One-night cuddles? Not so much.
Cas seemed close to hyperventilating, so Dean pulled him against his chest. They were so well-practiced at it that Cas immediately calmed down when he started scenting. Still, Dean kept Cas’ head against his neck for a little longer just to be on the safe side.
He needed the alpha to fuck into him deeper, harder, fuck the orgasm out of him because his dick was leaking and so desperate for it. It had never been this hard, his balls never been this full, and he wasn’t above begging at this point.
That wasn’t a surprise as after a while, the feeding always stopped. Apparently, Cas could control whether he wanted to feed on Dean while cuddling or not, and when he was full, the tingling feeding sensation would get weaker and weaker and then stop altogether. They always continued cuddling for a while after, neither of them mentioning that it didn’t really serve a purpose anymore.
“Why don’t we go to my room?” Cas suggested, suddenly uncomfortable, and unfortunately, that put an end to Dean’s eavesdrop opportunities.
When Dean opened the door, he was completely naked, dick standing proud at attention, pointing forward, and Castiel forgot all about saying hello.
When he was naked, he fiddled around with his clothes some more because even though he had read through the rules ten times, he didn’t quite know where to go from here.
Right on cue, Cas pushed his ass up even higher, a clear invitation for Dean to mount him. He had never seen an omega present so perfectly for him.
It wasn’t really Dean’s business anyway. He was just here to pick up his friend to go out to a bar. Maybe pick up an omega. (For him, at least. Charlie was more into betas.)
Cas arrived at the cabin where he was supposed to get impregnated around noon. That should give him enough time to get settled in before the alpha he had chosen to breed him would show up.
“Dean? Do you want to…” He trailed off, unsure of how to ask. Finally, he tried a different tactic, “Do humans have grooming buddies?”
He double clicked on Bees and—there. That would show him not to tease Dean for perfectly normal alpha urges! Now he got to watch his avatar mounting the omega.
Castiel had no intention of engaging in interspecies sex with a human, but he humored Dean and tried talking to some of the alphas Dean brought over to their booth.
There were still so many things about humans Castiel didn’t understand. He didn’t mind that Dean had gotten rid of Matt, though. His favorite human was right there next to him, and Castiel was happy when they left the bar and went back home… to Dean’s.
Castiel wanted to present right there on the front porch, but Dean whispered a gravelly “Fuck, you smell good!” and reached out to pull him inside by his tie.
Cas inclined his head and his tongue darted out to wet his chapped lips. “I feel strange,” he admitted. “For the first time, I feel…” He trailed off, probably because he didn’t have the right words for it. Helplessly, he looked into Dean’s eyes and Dean could see the omega right at the surface, which in return made his alpha want to pounce. Instead of turning golden, Cas’ eyes were an unnaturally bright blue. “It feels like if no one touches me, I will perish. I don’t know what to do,” he concluded.
Jimmy lifted his hips slightly for better access, looking up at Dean through hooded eyes, already fucked halfway out of his mind before Dean had even had his way with him.
The best way to go about dealing with it in Dean’s book was to just ignore it had happened, as always when his feelings were getting to be too much.
“How can you match them when you’ve never even met them?” he would ask whenever he tried to get Castiel to come play with the humans down on Earth.
The first time was frantic and desperate. All the evenings they had spent scenting but he hadn’t been allowed to… do stuff to Cas caught up to him, so he just let his alpha take over and take what he needed. He might have gotten a bit rough with Cas there, but Cas didn’t seem to mind if the needy whines were anything to go by.
“No one is figuring anything out,” Dean said, calm as ever. Well, he wasn’t the one losing his job if their plan went belly up. “We have plenty of time to tell each other what we need to know, come up with a little white lie about how we met… Hey, we don’t even need a lie. We just say Sam introduced us.” Dean grinned at him, obviously pleased with himself and his great idea for a ‘lie.’
scenting. That one time in the gym had been pure bliss when he had forgotten himself for a moment (no wonder—Dean had had him by the
The movie completely forgotten now, Dean just barreled right on, “Of course, the omega’s orgasm is important from an evolutionary standpoint. The better the chance for an orgasm, the more likely they are to let the alpha fuck them again. Easy orgasms make them crave alpha cock.”
His own ass started slicking in sympathy with the omega on screen getting fucked roughly, and he really wanted to finger his own hole, but he was scared Impala might hear him pushing down his pants. So, instead he watched avidly as Impala changed positions and was now fucking him face-to-face with Castiel’s legs on his shoulders.
it,” Castiel said, which got Dean to stop short and push himself up on his hands so that he could look down at Castiel.
While Dean’s cock was busy sliding in and out of him, Castiel’s own was weeping with pre-come. But when he tried to reach for it, Dean caught his hand and pushed it up above his head where he kept it in a loose grip.
“So? I’m wide awake now.” Seriously—why weren’t they kissing? Jimmy had all but told him that he was into Dean. And here Dean was, telling him that he was into him too. They were into
Dean couldn’t believe his luck. When he woke up (on the couch because Jimmy had fallen asleep in his  bed), the other alpha was still there, still fast asleep, looking as if he belonged there—in Dean’s bed.
They moved the furniture to the side so that they had enough space to fight and agreed that the same rules applied as in Purgaytory.
To make up for it, Dean invited Jimmy over for dinner and after that, when they had moved to the couch, he just kept the beers coming until they were both inebriated enough to be having that discussion Dean was curious about.
He really should have said no. After all the touching, kissing, and scenting the day before, his omega was confused enough as it was. But lying in bed next to Dean? That was definitely a new form of torture.
The buzzing of his cell phone brought him out of his thoughts. Unsurprisingly, the message was from Dean, who was probably still freaked out because of that stunt earlier.
So there. Here was his mate (maybe mate; probably mate) having just received a load of Dean’s spunk, with Dean’s knot in his ass—again. Dean gave Cas’ full ass a slap, just as a reminder.
Cas sat back to look at him with furrowed brows, and Dean almost let out a sigh of relief. His scent gland was quickly becoming the most sensitive spot of his body, and a reprieve from having Cas tease it mercilessly was just what he needed.
Cas raised an eyebrow at Dean. Had the alpha really just asked him what he had to do to claim Cas? It was instinctual. Or at least it was supposed to be.
Dean used the time to massage the omega and generally touch him a lot. There was a lot of kissing and rubbing noses, which led to ‘just a minute’ scentings that turned into ‘just five minutes,’ and… well, Cas was out of heat anyway, so no one cared when they were still scenting each other an hour later.
He had tried scenting things. Freshly cut lemons, essential oils, perfumes… Even things with the strongest scents which he usually couldn’t stand having in the house had given him nothing. Sure, the most powerful scent was that of an alpha, but so far, he hadn’t picked up on anything from Dean either.
He just hoped Sam wouldn’t rat him out and tell Dean about the whole thing that had gotten him into this mess. There was really no reason for the attractive alpha to know that Castiel had blurted out his name as his pretend mate-to-be.
you soon’—‘C’ was the name Mike had used for him. He had used letters as nicknames for all his omegas, and there had even been a ‘C2’ (Chris) and ‘C3’ (Cas hadn’t even know her real name). It was supposed to be dehumanizing, a way to show them that they were nothing, meant nothing, and that he was the one to control everything, even their names.
He didn’t want Dean to follow a ten-step plan of how to get an omega through his pregnancy heat. Of course,
“I don't know.” Dean threw his hands up in the air. “He doesn’t like alphas. Or knots. Or… hell if I know. His scent-blocking brother interrupted just when I was getting to the bottom of things.”
Against his better judgment, he felt his nostrils flare in response to the sweet smell of—yes, that had to be omega he smelled there. That answered that question. Of course, there was something else there in his scent, too, something Dean had never smelled before. It was intriguing and made his nose itch with the need to scent more deliberately.
Maybe, he should add just one more blanket to make sure Dean would sink into the blankets and never want to leave…
Jimmy hummed in agreement and undulated against him, baring his neck just like he had done that day in the gym when Dean had wanted to take what was offered and fuck that alpha. (Not that he had really admitted it to himself at that point, but in hindsight, a lot of things became clearer.) Nothing much had changed in that regard, only now he wanted to fuck that
Only then did Dean realize that his eyes had probably turned red there for a second. Not to mention the fact that his pants were getting rather tight.
really close to mate, too, when he got to bury his nose in Cas’ neck and felt like he finally got his fix again after going cold turkey for the last few days.
“Of course that doesn’t help you right now,” Sam continued, apparently thinking along the same lines. “If you ask me, you were right the first time. You could just pretend you’re mated for now. It’s not like there’s a mating license they can demand to see.”
It wasn’t long before Castiel’s ass cheeks were pulled apart, and then Dean entered him with a sigh of relief.
Oh well, a little bit of reciprocal scenting couldn’t hurt. They’d done it before. They’d do it again. No big deal. So, Dean’s nose found Cas’ scent gland and they picked up where they had left off earlier.
Dean shrugged, not quite sure himself as he wiped his hands on his pants to get rid of the remaining lotion. “Nothing. Just teasin’.”
“You have healing powers,” Hannah said to Anael, apparently equally surprised by the fact that they were still alive.
And Dean certainly didn’t mind having a house guest. After all, Cas staying the night gave Dean the perfect opportunity to educate Cas in pop culture by watching some of his favorite movies.
Maybe with the pay raise, he would finally be able to afford a bigger place—one that was more fitting for someone nearing his forties.
But he really wanted to know more about what was going on, too, so after a while of letting his alpha comfort Cas with soothing caresses, he asked, “Want to tell me about those scent complications?”
At least they exchanged numbers so that Cas could text him to let him know if he needed Dean’s help again during his next heat.
Just knowing that he would soon be closer to Dean was appeasing his alpha. According to the National Center for Mating Affairs, being too far away from your mate was almost as bad as being apart from your mate for too long. He could feel the bond that had been pushing him to call Dean or go to him quiet down some.
Friend… That might be hard to pull off with Cas when Dean ached for so much more. But it was still better than no Cas in his life at all.
Okay, so maybe that alone didn’t sound so bad, but someone who looked like Cas with those big blue eyes and smelled like Cas with that sweet yet earthy scent had to be careful not to be too friendly, or else people might start thinking they had a chance.
Dean shrugged. “Y’know.” His eyes traveled down Cas’ body, leaving a tingling sensation behind wherever his gaze went. “For example each other’s private parts. There’s a different scent down there that helps release endorphins.”
This might just be a one-time thing. Nothing to get too worked up over. If he didn’t like it, he simply wouldn’t come back.
“Shame,” Dean teased, raising his eyebrows playfully. “You could have me for breakfast any day you want.”
He recognized it as a shortened version of his name. No one had ever called him that. Until today, when he had heard it twice.
Gabe had to think about that for a moment, making a show out of tapping his chin. “You drive a hard bargain,” he finally said, “But you have yourself a deal.”
Apparently, ‘kilts’ for omegas were the new thing that was in style right now, as Cas explained while Dean was busy staring at his legs.
Even though Cas knew he couldn’t act on his attraction to Dean, and Dean wasn’t even attracted to him in the first place because he thought he was an alpha, their alpha and omega had a lot of fun playing with each other, mostly in a teasing way, but also goading each other from time to time, seeing how far they could go.
Still, he almost changed his mind when the beta at the counter looked at him expectantly. If he paid for the private room as planned, the beta would know that he was most likely about to engage in sexual activity with another alpha.
So, the first thing he did when he got home was program Cas’ number into his regular cell under the codename of ‘hot omega chick.’ (Man, but his subterfuge techniques were great. He should have joined the CIA.) Then he sent him a text message to inform him of the new number and to make plans for their next… mate meeting.
to be sold to the highest bidder again? If not, stop being such an omega and come with me!” He made another attempt at leading Cas away.
Sarcastic comments on the internet aside, biting at Jimmy’s neck a bit did actually sound just like what his alpha needed. Maybe it was just alpha competitiveness. Playful alpha fights to determine the rank weren’t really done anymore once you reached a certain age, but the instincts were still there. Dean’s alpha might just want to assert his dominance in order to show Jimmy that he was the higher-ranking alpha. Clear up the hierarchy as it were, that was all.
Cas looked up and down the street, but the agents hadn’t arrived yet, so he quickly shut the door again.
It quickly became clear that they were about equal in strength. Dean tried to pin the alpha underneath him a few times, but somehow he always managed to wriggle away from him at the last second.
Castiel had heard about how alphas in rut could go at an omega nonstop, but Dean had come in him so many times now that Castiel started to wonder how he could even get it up anymore.
Then he leaned back down, using his weight to push Cas softly into the pillows, and kissed him again, longer this time. He caught Cas’ lower lip between his own and sucked it gently just because he could, and he wanted to.
That entailed asking a lot of questions like, “Don’t you just end up growling at each other a lot during… you know.”
His heart swelled with love and affection for the alpha he was cuddling to the point he thought he couldn’t possibly bear it any longer without his heart exploding.
When Dean started chasing him around the gym, Cas realized that maybe he should have turned down Dean’s offer to teach him how to defend himself. But the prospect of being able to defend himself against Mike’s men if it ever came to that was just too good to pass up on.
“They are actually quite a mess,” Castiel mumbled. Having Dean stare at his wings like that made him feel a bit self-conscious, but not enough to tuck them away again.
“If you want to, I can take care of that,” he offered. There might have been a teasing quality to his voice, but Cas wasn’t the best at figuring out any kind of social cues, tones of voice included.
Luckily, a new habit was established when Dean came into his antique shop looking for something for his new business. That first time, Cas sold him an old lamp—and from then on, Dean came in to buy something all the time. Apparently, making his massage place homey would make the clients feel more comfortable to come back, and the ‘stuff’ Cas was selling was just what he needed.
After a beat of silence, he added, “So that’s why. The advances weren’t unwelcome.” Because he couldn’t have Cas think he’d turn him down under normal circumstances.
“If we ‘hole up’ here together, my alpha’s gonna want to do a whole lot more to you than just sleep next to you,” Dean said. Before Castiel could reassure him that his omega would be more than okay with that, the alpha went on, “Look—we might not even have to keep this going for much longer. Sam said something on the phone… He might have something that might get us out of this whole charade. So…”
Hannah screamed as a transparent sheen of orange light started streaming from her chest right into the witch’s hand.
Still, he held back from knotting the omega, which would probably have been too uncomfortable for him since his ass hadn’t produced enough slick yet. Just because he was an omega companion didn’t mean Dean would take advantage of him—even though he was allowed to fuck him pretty much any way he wanted to.
“Yeah, I do mind.” Cas was waiting for him, and Dean still had no idea what the hell was going on. “You’re not very helpful here.”
The playful sparkle in Dean’s eyes told him he would accept the challenge before Dean even said a word.
The doctor was absolutely onto him. But that was the least of his worries right now. Apparently, he was mated to an alpha whose name he didn’t even know. An alpha who could be
So, Cas stayed right where he was. (It certainly had nothing to do with the fact that Dean sniffing at his scent gland felt kind of nice.)
Castiel looked the alpha up and down. Maybe he was in the mood for sex and this was just an excuse. Although, he’d never needed an excuse before. Most of the time, he just started kissing Castiel as a greeting and then proceeded to seduce him with a simple touch here and there until his omega had no choice but to succumb to his wily charms.
figured out, he would fall asleep in the most unlikely of places or situations: in the library while they were researching a case, or while he was watching Dean and Sam eat breakfast, or that one time, while he was on his way to his room.
Ever since that first day, Dean hadn’t seen Jimmy more than a couple times. Until one day, when a package was delivered to Dean.
Remembering what Cas had said about not being able to stand the scent of rut, Dean tried to extract himself. He would not be responsible for making Cas have a panic attack! After all, Dean didn’t want Cas to associate him with bad things or even call off their whole scent/cuddle buddy system.
So what if there were cracks appearing in the wall of lies he’d had to hide behind? Tomorrow, he might be back with Mike or relocated, in a different state, never to see Dean again. Which was why he didn’t pull back, not even when Dean crowded him against the wall for a better scenting position.
Still, he didn’t want to scare Jimmy off by taking this too fast, so he made sure to keep the kisses gentle and slow.
This time around, waking up like this—warm, cozy, next to the smell of ‘mate’—wasn’t new. It wasn’t as comfortable as when they had slept together in Cas’ bed, either, but it still felt…
By that time, the omega was too out of it to realize that they weren’t keeping to his plan, so Dean could spoil him without Cas complaining about how they were supposed to get even more sperm into his ass.
Cas’ face distorted in pleasure as Dean’s cock kept invading his hole, now basically laying siege to his prostate.
There. That was much better. Scenting Dean’s naked torso was clearly what his omega had wanted. After all, this was the alpha who had a claim on him, which made Cas’ stomach tingle with another jolt of excitement.
As soon as he opened the door, Justin came flying in, a tightly rolled piece of paper tied to his leg. He landed on the railing, and Castiel freed him of the message he was delivering.
“Little bit to the left, other left, further up, stop. Right there. Now, take a deep breath through the nose. Three, two, one. And another one.” Castiel even got a, “You’re doing great,” which was ridiculous because he wasn’t doing anything a newborn pup wasn’t capable of.
by that piece of information. Maybe shocked. Something a bit closer to the way Castiel had felt when he had found out about it.
“Oh, sorry, was I supposed to tell you how good you were?” Dean retorted, trying to ignore the fact that the sex
It turned out he wouldn’t have had to worry. Dean’s brother, Sam, and best friend, Benny, who had been invited as well, turned out to be just as nice as Dean himself, and an alphas’ night in wasn’t all that different from an omegas’ night in. It wasn’t all belching contests and fighting each other to see who was the stronger alpha.
He didn’t regret asking the alpha to spend the first day of his heat with him because he really couldn’t imagine being separated from Dean for the complete duration of his heat. Still… usually when an alpha and an omega agreed to meet up for an omega’s heat, there were certain… expectations.
Dean’s dick was already leaking pre-come, obviously ready to get things going, and finally, Dean just ripped Castiel’s shirt off with a growl, patience wearing thin.
As a retired hunter, Dean had done and seen a lot of things in his life, so Castiel made a note at the margins of the file and added ‘trust issues’ to the list. It was important to know what kind of baggage each partner brought to the table. He clearly needed someone who would accept Dean for who he was, but who could also break through those walls the retired hunter had built around himself.
“Just a little taste,” the omega said and went right back to his infuriating little licks that were too much and not enough at the same time.
Castiel smiled. There was his grumpy alpha that he… loved. Yes, he was officially a cupid in love. He was sure there was some kind of irony in that.
A couple of days after the incident at the gym, their little gang was at Dean and Jimmy’s favorite burger joint. They also had some rabbit food for Sam there, but Jimmy liked a good burger almost as much as Dean did, and Benny didn’t care, so they could easily overrule Sam when he wanted to go somewhere else.
“Okay, that’s not what I…” Dean began, a blush creeping up his neck despite himself, but Bees interrupted him, excited.
They were doing the eye contact thing again. Dean’s alpha seemed to like what he saw as well, the green in his eyes fading and red taking its place. Castiel couldn’t have kept his omega from flashing his own eyes in return if he had tried, and the next thing he knew, Dean was taking him up on the offer and leaning down to capture Castiel’s lower lip between his.
,” Dean corrected him, making his way to the living room for some privacy so that he could ream Sam out. “And everyone knows you don’t call after nine.”
In any case, talking to Sam was easy in a way that only talking to Dean was. Had to be a Winchester family trait.
Nuzzling against Cas’ neck, he was definitely picking up on the scent of arousal. A quick look down confirmed it—that was one long, hard dick between Cas’ legs. Not that he was checking out another alpha’s junk. Just making sure they were on the same page here.
“He’s a grown man. He can take care of himself. And who knows—maybe they won’t relocate you at all. I’d just like to be prepared for if they do.”
While lips were gliding against each other in a tentative dance, a hand settled on the small of his back to anchor him—a touch Castiel arched into.
When seven finally came around, it was a bit awkward at first because their game characters were still lying in bed with each other, naked and cuddled up like mates. Embarrassment aside, it was a nice picture. Their characters looked cute, with Impala having a protective arm thrown across his chest and Castiel snuggling against his pup daddy.
“I can explain…” he started because Dean looked dumbfounded and he deserved an explanation even though Cas had no idea what exactly to say.
In hindsight, Cas should have been more careful. He was pregnant—his body was producing love hormones left and right whenever Dean cuddled and scented him, or bathed him, hands gliding over every inch of his body, or brought him to orgasm. And Dean seemed to have made it his mission to fuck as many orgasms out of him as possible during his pregnancy heat.
Had he not masturbated almost nonstop since his heat had started, Cas would probably have been in serious trouble right now. As it was, he could enjoy the intimacy of the moment without getting aroused. It felt so nice, being touched there when Cas would have assumed no one would want to see those scars, much less touch them.
His mind immediately wondered what a possible scenting session would be like. A weak scent probably meant he’d have to press his nose right up against Jimmy’s scent gland and really go to town on it in order to get a good whiff. Yeah, he could totally make that work, no problem.
What Cas should be doing was sending Dean away for good. That would be the reasonable thing to do. He was the one who had told Dean he was sending mixed signals, after all. Going over to cuddle with the alpha would send the wrong signals too—even though it was obvious that Dean wouldn’t be here hitting on him if he were sober.
“Oh,” Cas said and turned back around to play little spoon once more, apparently satisfied with that answer. “You have a strange way of doing that.”
had been the one with the plan the last time around—but that had been different. Dean was supposed to have fun here, too. He had paid for all of this, after all.
Dean spent the rest of the day beating off to the scent of Cas in heat. His dick did not understand why it hadn’t gotten to spend some time getting intimate with the omega’s ass. Coming anywhere
Dean said goodbye to Inias, declined his offer for another cuddle date, and was just about to call Cas when his cell phone rang.
There, that had been a very diplomatic way of saying, ‘Your scent drives me crazy and makes me want to mount you right here, right now. Oh, and also, I’ve been beating off to the memory of your scent basically since day one.’
Slamming his eyes shut, he came—hard. Dean hadn’t even encircled his knot, had only grazed it, really, no pressure, just a curious poke.
After, when they were cuddling in bed together, the smell receded a bit, but there were still some traces of it left, and Castiel knew that he would get it back.
He knew what would make him feel better, though, and his tipsy brain had no problems ordering his mouth to say it, “If we’re really ‘good,’ you should come over. Make sure we can catch some z’s.”
For example, he had seen another alpha go into his house a couple times, but he had no idea if Jimmy was dating this guy or if it was just a booty call.
“You’re not thinking with your upstairs brain right now,” Jimmy said, pointedly looking down at where Dean’s cock was currently nestled inside of his ass.
Of course, the other alphas still had no idea what had transpired the day before, or that Cas was an omega for that matter. Obviously, Dean wouldn’t want to appear alphasexual, so Cas would have to make sure he didn’t make heart eyes at Dean and give them away.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Don’t be ridiculous! We’re just scent-bond partners, it’s not like we’re courting or anything.”
The second attempt did not go much better. Even though Castiel desperately needed his wings groomed—Rachel’s hands on his wing felt…
Every so often the alpha would let up a bit to thumb across the ‘mating bite,’ driving Castiel positively insane with the need for more. Maybe some naked cuddling.
If it meant he’d stop feeling like—whatever it was he was feeling, then maybe he should trust his brethren.
At some point, Cas—who was probably exhausted because of all the hormones rushing through his body because he was now a claimed omega—fell asleep right there on top of Dean, a reassuring weight against his chest.
That’s why he broke his promise to himself to keep away from earth and flew back down, making sure that he was invisible to the human eye and that he stuck the landing this time around. He’d had a lot of practice lately.
“You think you can make it to Easthallow now?” Impala asked, as if they hadn’t just watched porn together. “Just over twenty minutes left.”
Now that Dean’s scent wasn’t all around him, the facts still remained the same. He was attracted to the alpha (which was a first for him, so it was still a bit weird), and he liked being held and kissed by him. It wasn’t just a fantasy, something he only enjoyed in strange dreams, but it was something his omega craved and wanted more of.
The thought that Dean would be here soon gave Cas the strength to haul himself over to the couch, where he buried his face in the cushions, trying to chase Dean’s scent. Unfortunately, since he had scented them constantly the last few days, his own scent was drowning out Dean’s.
That cat was out of the bag thanks to Hannah. Dean could go and be with any omega he wanted to, now that he knew the curse had been lifted.
Never once had he been this curious about another person’s scent. Then again, as long as he’d had his sense of smell, there had been no reason to be curious about it.
For example, his scent. Yes! He definitely wasn’t attracted to Jimmy’s scent. Hence, even though Jimmy had awakened some confusing instincts in Dean to give chase, his masculinity and omegasexuality clearly weren’t in danger.
After a while, Cas stopped scenting and took his hand, leading him back to the bedroom, where they sat down on the bed.
Ten minutes. He’d use them for a good cuddle. Maybe he could ask how much it would cost to prolong the cuddle session…
And just like that, he was left to his own devices again. He should be happy about that, but there was a gnawing uncertainty left in the back of his mind. It seemed like a rather big coincidence to have gotten that text message by accident.
Sam shot Dean another funny look. “Didn’t you say…” he started to say, but then Dean accidentally dropped the book he’d just wanted to put away right onto Sam’s foot.
Somewhere in the periphery of his vision, Sam and Benny were still fighting a futile fight, their weapons passing through the witch without leaving a scratch. It was surreal, a vampire and a hunter fighting together. He might have laughed about it if he hadn’t been so busy doing what she told him to.
The second Bartholomew’s surprise bought him was enough to go for the alpha’s scent gland, one of the most sensitive spots for alphas as well as omegas, and he bit
“…you okay?” he heard Dean’s voice, which brought him out of his vision for good. “Thank God, you looked like you were having some kind of seizure. Is the moonlight too much? Should we go back?”
The omega’s dick lay spent against his stomach, and Dean couldn’t help but play with it a bit, just to see Cas squirm. Even angels had a refractory period, it seemed.
. Just like that. No fight for dominance, he was just readily submitting to Dean’s alpha as if it were no big deal.
It was clearly intended as teasing, so Cas made a show of rolling his eyes, but he had to keep himself from saying,
Maybe Cas was on his way to get something to drink, too. Dean should have put a glass of water on his nightstand. What kind of an alpha host forgot about that?
Looking for a mating option himself, Castiel couldn’t find one either. “Maybe we missed our chance?”
Dean cleared his throat. “Yeah, that’s… not weird at all.” How had this conversation gotten so off track? He was supposed to find out about how this whole dating thing worked for two alphas. “So… no alpha in your life at the moment, huh?” he asked, leaving the whole cheek incident behind because no matter what Jimmy said, it
Holding his gaze, Dean slowly pulled out and penetrated him again, never letting him look away. The alpha should know exactly who was fucking his ass.
. Dean’s hands gone, Dean’s scent gone, the bed underneath him gone, and Castiel stumbled to the ground as he opened his eyes to blinding brightness.
Reliving parts of it really took it out of him, but it was worth getting it out in the open in the end. The reaction he got this time around was better than having Dean just ignore it altogether.
But with Cas standing right in front of him, close enough that he could scent him if he just leaned forward, admitting he was wrong didn’t seem quite as daunting. “I didn’t want you to call an alpha service for your pregnancy heat.” And then, because he had already revealed this much, “I wanted you to want
And so it began. Castiel had witnessed it countless times—the spark that got ignited only when perfect mates met.
Dean took a step back and Castiel immediately missed his presence, even though he was still standing right there.
“I’m not planning to work, either. I…” It seemed like he’d have to come out and say it after all. “I’ll be in heat.”
Ever since then, he had tried to inconspicuously scent in Dean’s general direction again. But he didn’t want Dean to think he was weird—well,
When he reached Balthazar, the agent stayed infuriatingly calm, telling him that it was unlikely that Mike had gotten the number, and maybe it was just from someone who had sent the text to the wrong number by accident.
Cas burrowed deeper into Dean, letting his scent soothe him. He was glad he hadn’t cancelled their appointment, even though he had thought about it after what had happened at work.
Once he did, Cas felt himself get nervous again, even when Dean placed a thin sheet over his buttocks.
He didn’t need an alpha to take care of his heat in real life as long as he had Impala to play with.
Obviously, Sam didn’t know what he was talking about. There was simply no way any omega could smell that nice to him if no bond was involved. Come to think of it, there was no way any omega could make him feel all protective and possessive (and horny) without any bond between them.
Even if Cas didn’t feel it, for Dean, it was like his insides were being tickled by butterfly wings flapping around. Stupid crush. Adult alphas weren’t supposed to feel that way. Then again, when adult alphas had an omega in their bed and were cuddling with them as much as he and Cas did, they mostly got to fuck them, too. Maybe that would take care of all those confusing feelings. After all, Dean didn’t
Cas carefully closed the bathroom door and immediately turned on the faucet of the sink. Then he sat down on the toilet and buried his head in his hands.
“I’m sorry to inform you of this, but that—” The doctor indicated Castiel’s neck. “—is a mating bite. If the… ahem…
Signing those damn documents that said he’d walk away forever had clearly been a huge mistake. But he still had enough time left to convince the omega to let him be a part of his pup’s life, even though that hadn’t been what he had agreed to.
Since it was apparently up to Dean to get the conversation started, he said, “Oh, hey, how is that omega? You know, the one who can’t smell anything? He doing better?”
Up until he had met Dean, he had never even thought about mating. It had certainly not been anything he had ever imagined himself doing willingly. Alphas just wanted to have complete control over omegas. If you let an alpha mate you, there was bound to be a lot of pining because all of a sudden, against your will, you were bound to that alpha.
Dean’s moans in the background turned more desperate every time Castiel’s tongue swept up and down his shaft and across the swollen head of his cock. The taste was simply too delicious to resist, so he wrapped his lips around that luscious cock and sucked on it mercilessly.
Now that Cas had found out that Dean ‘mistook’ his mating gland for his scent gland on purpose, Cas decided that he was allowed to play with Dean’s mating gland a bit too.
This time, though, Dean didn’t leave after they had copulated. Instead, they were lying in bed together and Dean kept stroking his arms, which felt nice. Really nice. Maybe he was staying for another round. It would make sense since he was only able to reach orgasm with Castiel.
Dean was waiting for an answer, though, so he tried to explain, “You might have noticed that I’m not the best at picking up on social cues, especially now that I don’t have my sense of smell to guide me.”
Suddenly, Dean started scenting more deliberately, pressing his nose against Cas’ neck more intently and taking deeper whiffs.
And if Dean’s scent was especially strong and easy to pick up on when their lips met—well, that was just the cherry on top.
Jimmy was lying on his back, looking up at him, tilting his head ever so slightly, a clear invitation that Dean took him up on without hesitation.
That left him with his old friend Google. As was always the case when something strange was going on—it had happened to other people before. They were mainly people who had woken up in Vegas with a mating bite on their necks but no mate in sight.
Jimmy kept staring at him intently for a moment. Then his eyes widened in realization. “You are under the impression that Balthazar and I are having intercourse.”
Before he could ask, they heard the front door open and Castiel looked up, expecting to see Sam’s girlfriend, but instead, an alpha walked in, threw the keys into a key bowl by the door and said, “You’re still here? Eileen kick you out or something?”
“What do you think you’re doing, Castiel?” he asked, looking up and down his naked chest with disdain.
So, when Cas tilted his head further to the side, exposing a long line of neck and throat, Dean’s alpha felt teased as well as intrigued, and he wanted nothing more than to take Cas up on the dare. It seemed like Cas was finally admitting that he had cheated in the fight and that Dean totally would have won otherwise. Dean should absolutely get to collect on his prize as well. It was only fair.
Dean could not believe his luck. He didn’t even need to lube up a beta with Cas’ slick, but he got to fuck Cas himself.
This alpha was on a mission and soon, they had stripped out of their PJs, and Castiel felt his ass slick in anticipation.
“Oh, yes. I was just about to pick up a new one.” No reason to come up with any excuses now. It had to be pretty obvious that he had been scenting Dean’s clothes.
And that should have been that. They were both clear on where they stood in the ranking order. Dean should just accept Jimmy’s acceptance and they would be done here.
Cas could stay in this bubble of make believe forever, imagining that Dean would stay with him and their pup even after all of this was over.
“Uhm… sure,” he said nevertheless (as if he could say no to Cas!) and got up to give the angel some space to spread out on the bed again.
“Why was I supposed to bring an overnight bag?” Benny grumbled as a greeting, while eying the agents with a suspicious glance.
They were still sharing sweet kisses because coming down from an orgasmic high was always so much better if accompanied by assurances of love and expressions of affection. Some scenting was of course part of their post-sex routine as well. Cas might like Dean’s smell best when he was all bursting with love, so he pressed his nose up against his scent gland and inhaled deeply.
His scent was now so sweet and inviting that there was no doubt about it: Dean had succeeded in his mission. Oh yeah. This omega was absolutely ready to be mated.
There was no way he’d leave Jimmy alone with these two clowns, so before he left, Dean shot him a meaningful look, eyebrows slightly raised, as he nodded his head ever so slightly towards Jimmy’s bedroom. He hoped Jimmy would understand…
friend, whose job it was to find Dean a mate. And yet, here he was, his thoughts circling back to Cas lying half-naked on his bed, writhing in pleasure because of what Dean was doing to his oil glands.
, lady,” Dean corrected her, and Castiel felt obliged to lean towards him so that he could whisper into his ear, “That is not something to brag about around here.”
But the fact that Dean occasionally went LARPing with Charlie was only the first interesting tidbit of many. As the night wore on, Castiel learned more about his mate than he had in their previous encounters combined.
Soon, Dean would touch him again in all the ways Cas had been dreaming of ever since his last heat they had spent together.
“First off, I was right,” Dean went on. “Cuddling with a cuddlibus through the whole night does not harm me in any way.”
Plus, being mated was like Viagra—he was constantly horny in Cas’ presence. The mating hormones made sure his dick was hard and ready whenever he smelled his mate’s addictive scent.
Being in a cuddle relationship with a cuddlibus had the advantage that this was a two-way street, and so Cas started initiating contact, too. In typical Cas fashion, it started off in a roundabout way, with a hesitant, “Are you tired?” one evening.
But for now, he could use his omega wiles to seduce Dean for multiple rounds of heat sex as well as lots and
When Dean had asked about his time as an omega slave, Cas had been exhausted from talking about it the first time—the time Dean hadn’t quite paid enough attention, apparently. But he owed Dean for all the lies, so he stumbled his way through the explanation for a second time.
“What’s with the third degree?” Dean grumbled, but he explained nevertheless, “I left my cell at Cas’ place and had to buy a new one. End of story.”
It took him a while to come down from the high of endorphins. But when he did, he realized that maybe, giving the slick a test run hadn’t been the best idea. He had used quite a bit of the slick. It would never last for his whole rut.
Well, thanks for the inside scoop, Jimmy, that cleared that right up. But Jimmy wasn’t really chatty when it came to his personal life anyway. He was rather good at evading questions. Dean’s best guess—from the bits and pieces that he had gotten out of Jimmy—was that he had just gotten out of a bad relationship with an asshole alpha.
Since he was all alone, he didn’t need to suppress his omega instincts this time. As soon as the alpha’s scent surrounded him, he presented and bared his neck in submission. This strong of a reaction to an alpha’s scent was highly unusual, but the jacket smelled so much like the alpha that it seemed like he was right there in bed with him.
Kissing your alpha friends on the cheek was normal—right? Dean did it all the time. It was just a buddy thing. It wasn’t like he had kissed Jimmy on the lips the way he had wanted to.
“Can we talk about this tomorrow?” Jimmy asked and carefully turned onto his side so that Dean had no choice but to follow until he was spooning Jimmy from behind. “I’m really tired.”
‘Oh’ was pretty much the reaction he had feared, so he quickly said, “Hey, if you still need time, I totally understand. You don’t have to decide right
That’s when he realized: he was submitting to that hot, naked alpha above him, and baring his neck to end the fight was only the beginning. Just that thought sent a pleasurable shiver down his spine.
In hindsight, Dean was a bit embarrassed that it had taken him so long, but that was the moment when it finally clicked. Cas wasn’t the most oblivious omega in the world—he was the most
In all his life, Castiel had never experienced such a strange feeling. He had only ever felt other people’s longing. Humans’ longing. But this time? This time
While those three were bickering away, Castiel looked back over at Anael. It hadn’t been his imagination after all, Anael really could move around, arching her wings and everything.
And with that, he tilted his head in invitation, just like that, as if he expected Castiel to start scenting his
“You let me kiss them before!” Best argument ever! Dean grinned, proud of himself. Let’s see Jimmy try to say something against that sound logic.
There was that smile again, and this time, Castiel smiled back tentatively. Even though he couldn’t smell if Dean was being sincere, he somehow knew. Maybe he was getting better at telling what people were feeling by observing their facial expressions, now that he couldn’t rely on his nose anymore. Or maybe Dean was just easier to read.
He obviously didn’t understand what Castiel was getting at, so he elaborated, “You should not have risked going to heaven.”
Once he was in the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door in an attempt to find out when it was safe to come out. He heard muffled voices and as soon as they went away and he could hardly hear them anymore, he slowly opened the door and tiptoed his way to the front door.
Cas stilled. His heat was soaring, demanding his ass not stay empty any longer. This would be the time he’d have to use a fake knot to satisfy his omega’s needs if he were alone.
Yet, his love was clearly a nuisance to Dean; otherwise, he wouldn’t have wanted to make Castiel fall out of love with him.
Dean’s wet cockhead teased his hole and finally slipped inside. Of course, Cas couldn’t have suppressed the instinct to bare his neck if he had tried. Dean didn’t take him up on the offer to nose along his neck, though, and instead did what they were here to do. He bred him.
Cas had just gotten home from work when the doorbell rang. It couldn’t be Dean—he wouldn’t be home for another couple of hours.
The intense look the doctor gave him made him think that maybe he knew more than Castiel was comfortable with. Who knew—maybe alphas from Purgaytory had come to him with similar problems before.
Dean sighed and scrubbed a hand over his face. “Okay, how often do we have to… hang out to avoid any side effects?”
talking about it after all. “There’s this ‘reject-o-meter’ that says my rejection symptoms are getting worse. I don’t think it’ll be good for me when it reaches 100%.”
Castiel wasn’t about to give in just yet. An alpha’s possessive instincts were running high when in the presence of an omega in heat, so he bit his lower lip, blinked up at Dean, and said, “I’m yours.”
Squeezing Cas’ hand, he was still staring at the life they had created, nestled comfortably inside Cas’ belly where the omega was friggen
“Wait—so, the new omega doctor is his long-lost sister?” Benny asked, eyebrows arched. He was clearly not keeping up with this show, either, so at least Cas wasn’t the only one who had no idea what was happening on screen.
Damn, but those protective instincts were messing with his head. He was pretty sure that these were the early signs of a forming scent bond. Developing such a bond with a patient was a bad idea on many levels. Especially since Cas had no way of knowing what was going on. A one-sided bond had the potential of hurting like a son of a bitch when the omega rejected him.
Castiel enjoyed the scent of aroused Dean, he enjoyed it very much indeed, which was why he went right back to scenting his dick, where the intoxicating scent was emanating from.
He pressed his nose against Dean’s scent gland in an attempt to find out the truth. Happiness, affection, satisfaction, and... yes, love. And, wait, was that mischief? That last one didn’t make any sense. His nose probably wasn’t at its best yet.
The way Cas’ tongue kept flicking out to lick the head of his cock made his balls swell. He desperately needed to empty them into Cas. Preferably into his ass, but since that was out of the question, his mouth would do.
Dean’s scent really did smell kind of protective. But Cas was too exhausted to try and figure out why that was.
The alpha was already naked, and he was definitely fit. Well-defined muscles made Castiel want to step closer and let his arms wander over his chest.
Castiel squinted at him in an attempt to silently communicate that he didn’t understand the reference, but instead of providing an explanation, Dean just rolled his eyes.
That wasn’t really an answer. Dean and Cas were kind of cuddling out of necessity, too. As far as Cas knew, they were doing it so that Dean would be able to sleep through the night. In reality, they were doing it so that Cas wouldn’t have to starve. Either way, ‘out of necessity’ described their whole cuddle relationship rather well.
“Getting regular blowjobs from an alpha might help prevent panic attacks,” Doctor Fuller said from the other side of the room, scribbling down some notes.
Dean ignored it because this was more important. “No, I’m serious. What, do you fight over who gets to be the one in control?”
