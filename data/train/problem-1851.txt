The party was surprisingly short. They sang while he cut the cake and had generous amounts of it. There was also beer in the burettes, beakers, basically every chemical apparatus that could hold liquid. Mrs. Hudson smiled and hugged him, adding a few comments on how he should settle down. Lestrade merely smiled at him. His eyes held the triumph of fooling Sherlock Holmes with a fake real case. Sherlock's respect for Gavin went up a little bit, that is, he decided he would find out Lestrade's first name. Molly smiled at him and wished him well, nothing like the Christmas incident. Mike wished him and said
Attention. I paid attention too. Hard not to, when you are in this deep. He always said preferring one thing over the other without any reason was completely irrational and thus alien to him. However, he did slip. He did have favorites. He loved dogs. He liked the wind - I discovered this when I realized that he preferred a bike over a car. He built up his knowledge of London by being a cab driver (I found a cab license while cleaning Sherlock's room). He hated birthdays. Not just his, everyone's. He seemed to have no idea as to what qualified as a present and what did not. One birthday he gave me a watch I wanted but could not afford. The next birthday, however, he gave me an essay which basically said that all my friends hated me.
That was easy. Birth certificate, hospital records and driving license. Or I could ask Mycroft. He did owe me one after the fall. I decide against it. I didn't want Mycroft in between me and Sherlock
A blond guy in his early twenties walked towards them, clearly excited. His hands were quivering and there was a bounce in his step.
. I have reasons to believe that their manager, , is part of a smuggling ring." Mr. Sagarson's voice became a little quicker here "I can't say anything for sure Mr. Holmes. He keeps carrying a different suitcase everyday. Strange people come to the set for him and it is always to drop off a bag. I found some antique cups in his room once. He leaves for a notoriously long amount of time and always carries a bag. I can't go to the police with this. The band's reputation..."
"You need to love something, Sherlock. But people?" he would say, in a last attempt to dissuade me verbally.
"Sherlock, please. I am sending you the details of our fake identites right now." Sherlock said, not looking above his phone.
I go in. There's a woman sitting beside John. Must be a friend, chance meeting at the restaurant. I go there with my bottle of champagne.
Alex: A Rolex, few more business cards, his mobile phone, cash (both in dollars and pounds), few keys, a handkerchief, some hotel bills, his clothes.
"Admire your confidence mate. The odds are not good" the man replied, holding his girl-friend's (no, wife! the ring) hand and crossing his other hand.
Being with Mary has taught me to hope that I could be happy again. Maybe not as much as with Sherlock, but atleast a little happiness was enough for me right now. I guess I must have used up my lifetime happiness quota with Sherlock.
It was a pity Sherlock did not see out of the window. Or else, he would have seen John furiously kicking some dustbins.
He played it a final time but something felt very off. It felt messy, like excessive seasoning on an otherwise perfect dish. Music with too much sugar on top. A song to impress; not express.
The guard went in with all the pride of a lion. His footsteps echoed the almost empty hall like the gong of death. He was clearly not a man that could be trifled with. He walks slowly, each step being taken with great caution and utmost care.
"Strange. Grocery shopping did not usually take this long. How do I know he's been grocery shopping? Obvious, isn't it? Of course you don't, you don't have a brain" I chastised the skull, fully knowing how stupid it sounded.
"Of course one should. But not at John's wedding! We wouldn't do that, would we? You and me? We would never do that to John Watson"
John, I wish I was there to tell you this. Meeting you has been one of the best things that ever happened to me. Would you like to have dinner with me? And, yes, not takeover. Like a date. –SH
John felt a little tug in the area of his stomach. Never did he realise the truthfulness of the phrase "knocking your air out". His hands were itching to wrap themselves up in his hair, to explore every nook of face, to
that Sherlock was a feet away from him, also moving in his direction. His hand stilled and his breathing became slightly ragged. He moved forward – and they collided.
John calmed himself, laughing at Sherlock. It was alright really. They were friends. John never really felt that way for Sherlock. It was just people's assumptions got on his nerves. They were doing it for a case and John felt slightly ashamed for his outburst earlier. It wasn't like he would have to
The husband Alex's suitcase was more organised. He had a lot of formal shirts. He was a man made of money and it was transparent that Diana chose a wealthier husband this time (Richard wasn't exactly what you would call rich). However, Sherlock was searching for things that were missing rather than what was in there. Everything seemed in order. Alex and Diana were Americans who met each other in the beach and spent their first date in a lighthouse. It was there he proposed to her. (All this apparent from a photograph taken shortly after the proposal) Diana was proudly pointing at her ring while Alex was proudly pointing at her. First date, thus the location. Alex made a lot of money when he set up his company (business cards in his pockets).
“This is Sherlock, the guy you lived with for ten years. Stop embarrassing yourself.” he repeated to himself, although not quite achieving the desired result. There was something about the blindfolds – John would have never felt the anticipation he was feeling now.
Of course he wasn't. Why would Married-To-My-Work Sherlock Holmes even care? John needed Sherlock for his adrenaline fix. Sherlock didn't need him.
"No!" he yelled back. I could hear his smile. He got on a cab and I saw the car slowly receding away in the distance.
Sherlock had had many bad mornings. This would probably replace the one currently in second place. God, he hated to be confused. He, Sherlock Holmes,
"How did you do it so quickly?" John asked, feeling the familiar flicker of irritation usually associated with his flatmate's intelligence.
I know I am only your birth mother but you've always been a son to me, Hamish. So, thank you. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be your mother. For choosing me. Your birth was a rebirth of Molly Hooper too. I was reborn a more confident, more determined and most importantly, a brave woman. I became a mother and I had to set an example for my son. For that, you have my infinite gratitude.
He gestured to the waiter for the cheque. We both headed out in silence, each of us busy in our own thoughts. I really wanted to ask him his name but I didn't. There was something beautiful about the evening, something surreal; I did not want to ruin it with reality. We walked through the garden, admiring the flowers until we reached the spot he played earlier. He stopped walking and turned around to look at me. Again, those deep blue eyes looked at me searchingly, as if they were expecting something.
John: (draft) You've helped me through some of the darkest parts of my life and never judged me. You have my sincere gratitude for that. Maybe in a different world, in a different time...
"Well, dummy, he took his card when he left. Okay, why grocery? Dull. That's the only thing he goes shopping for. John is a huge fan of online shopping. Okay, why online shopping? This one is really obvious. His shoulders hurt when he goes out in the cold. It's December, not exactly a nice time to be running around the city. What if he went to buy something important? Balance of probability, dear skull"
I had no intention of letting Sherlock know what was John was about to do. I will let him make his own deductions.
Even though I've encouraged you to believe that a fairytale is possible, I am afraid that I cannot promise you a happily ever after. The world isn't that kind. It hasn't been kind to me, either. In fact, sometimes, you'll feel like the universe has conspired against you. You'll feel like your heart is breaking and there's nothing you can do about it. There will be times when you will have to smile while witnessing the darkest moments of your life. There will be days when you have to stay strong when you can't. There will be days when you'll stop hoping, when you are resigned to the fact that you could never be happy again. In times like this, Hamish, you'll have us. You'll have me, John, Mycroft, your godmother Molly and lot of other people who will be there for you. Always.
Oh, dear Lord. (This definitely was the day he took the Lord's name so many times). Frankly, Sherlock did not know what to feel. While he was, against his better judgement, open to the idea of a relationship with John, (or in goldfish terms,
on. It almost worked – John dated someone named Mary who was quickly removed from the scene by Mycroft when they found she was an agent on the run. John didn't need the danger.
"The manager!" Sherlock reverted to his old voice, for which John was grateful. His voice seemed to have woken John up. The man in front of him was his
your parents atleast twice a week. They love you a lot and worry about you constantly. Having people like that in your life is rare. NEVER take them for granted. Also, be with your sister. She will have boyfriends and they may break her heart. You don't go around breaking their heads. Instead, be there for her. I know you think the world of your sister, make sure she
Before John could think about this, Agatha approached them asking them to move to the next room. John thanked Ruby for his eyes and lips (they did look a tad more seductive) to which she only giggled a little harder.
The words reverberate around my head. It was the first time I acknowledged verbally that I was permanently moving on from Sherlock. For the first time, I realize the weight of the ring in my pocket.
However, I was a little worried, especially since there was no service in the Underground. We weren't equipped to handle bombs! I do not understand what Sherlock's plan is, but it better involve bomb disposal.
"This blog is the story of two men and their frankly ridiculous adventures. Of murder, mystery and mayhem"
There were so many ways our meeting could have never occurred. It still gives me the chills to think about them. I asked him about this many times and the thought haunts him too. He understands probability, he understands how easily we could have gone our separate ways. When you meet a new person, it happens due to a series of events, a chain all leading up to that one big moment. And that one turn you took on the street, that one construction site that forces you to change direction, that one reason why you went out (I went to buy milk), that random but sudden feeling in your gut to play the violin (or maybe that's just because you don't want your brother to know your first song). My point is I could have very easily not met him in my life. I could be doing something entirely differently. And, he is the reason why I believe our life is a continuous motion of little wheels, all of them turning to prepare you for this. All the suffering you had to go through, all the tears shed, broken faith, shards of your heart trying to heal – they're all for this one big moment.
While Sherlock was on his way to (if you haven't already figured it out) St. Bartholomew's, he kept thinking about what he didn't know. Why was he being summoned to the lab? Was there a case? God forbid, was it an
I hear Mrs. Hudson's voice cutting through my sleep. I wake up with a jolt, remembering the events of yesterday. I still have the oxygen mask, but I try to show her my tied hands. She seemed surprised with my jovial mood and I don't blame her.
I shake my head, trying to shake off all the negativity I was feeling. No matter what, I had fallen for him. I would tell him. I do not want to regret not telling him. I did not want Sherlock to be my biggest what if.
"I was talking about a career, Sherlock! Loving people is the most chaotic thing you can think of. It is the most unpredictable way of living your life! Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock!" he would be practically yelling.
"Music is about telling a story. Those French girls keep falling all over me, just because I have money or power or whatever. No one actually
He looked me straight in the eye. A deep stare, as if trying to decipher what I was thinking. I stared back into his. Big mistake.
What? Why? What? Sherlock, what happened? Why are you doing this? Why are you lying to me? We both know that's not true.
MYCROFT! I calm myself, being emotional does not help any scenario, especially one that included Mycroft. Emotions betray you and I wasn't about to lower my defenses in front of one of the sharpest people alive. Not that it mattered, he knew I loved John now. Something, I tried really hard to avoid. Mycroft's interference had burned out more relationships than I can count. I wonder if my interference destroyed relationships…especially those of John's. I must apologize. I realize now how it feels like.
The Fall was something he never brought up and John, while angry at first, forgave him after the bonfire incident. The reason Sherlock never brought it up was simple. He did not want John to know the amount of
He scoffs at the idea though, asking me not to fret over "could be's" and "what ifs". But it does make good tea-time conversation.
The man takes my coat. Baby clothes catalogue visible in the inner coat, both for a girl and a boy. Expectant father. His phone rings, special alert noise.
John wasn't listening. Sherlock had used this exact sentence in his hallucination. He grips the glass in his hand tightly. His rational part calms him. Maybe Sherlock used that sentence in real life before and his unconscious memory stored it. That must be it. He relaxes.
"So, as soon as I am two meters away from you'll feel a light vibration. As we get close, it'll only become stronger. But, don't directly come towards me. Fumble a bit but don't move much from your location."
very own make-up crew! The legends behind the magic you see! They've just finished with the band who, by the way, are modelling for a cover right now. Just imagine getting your make-up done by someone who's made Matt's iconic eyebrows or Diana's trend-setting marbled hair!"
"Yes, John, that's what they call it when two people touch each others hands. Mr. Sagarson, we'll be at the preliminary selections tomorrow. Good day" Sherlock said, waving his hand in clear dismissal.
The guard was anxious – droplets of sweat had accumulated on his forehead despite the snow surrounding them. His stance was that of a tiger – ready to leap at a moment's noticed. His eyes scanned the area with an intensity that would put eagles to shame. Anyone could see that he was a man ready to fight. He had plenty of reason to be. Britain relied on him.
Emotion had already once clouded my judgment. And, I would have nearly paid the price for that. My friendship with John itself has made me question my deductions once. When I heard John at the pool, and for one horrible second, thought that John was Moriarty, my brain went into overdrive. There were three pieces of my brain at war with each other. One piece, which sounded like Mycroft, was chastising me for the blunder I've committed. A piece that sounded like my parents pitied on me. A small, but defiant part of my head did not care. It was grateful for the company it had gotten, no matter how fake. It did not regret meeting John Watson even if he was Moriarty. After that eternal second passes, I only felt one emotion. Not hate for Moriarty, not concern about my impeding death. I felt gratitude towards the man covered in semtex.
The evidence contained the list of names of all people and a more informative narrative on each of them. The dead girl's (Lisa's) and the dead boy's (Mark's) clothes, the autopsy report (idiots!) and possible suspects were what contained of the evidence.
“It’s okay, you can do it again.” John replied, his mind clearly on bigger things than Ruby’s eye-makeup.
After reading our conversation again (for the fifth time), I decide to find out when Sherlock's birthday was. He deserved the attention he gave me. He literally told me that he loved attention.
Harry Watson: Brother, what has got you thinking down this road? Have you met someone new? It sounds serious
He waited until the draw was to take place, tapping his foot impatiently waiting for Sherlock. Mr. Sagarson arrived along with the band which caused an instant uproar and thus temporary deafness. The band members (four male and two female) all waved at them. Each band member, the director and the producer would pick a number thus selecting eight couples. John saw many couples crossing their fingers. He smirked and said jauntily to the couple next to him.
John searched for further clues but found none. His took the metal S from the stand, hoping it would reveal more. It did. Engraved on the other side were the words:
Ella was wrong about many things about me. But this time, her words hit home. Of course, there was stuff I wanted to say. How I secretly like his hair, how I liked making him behave and he sulked like a cute kid, how I loved his unpredictability. How I loved fighting alongside him. His deductions would never stop surprising me. I loved him for trying to stay away from drugs. Just for me. And of course, the main thing: That I loved him and cared about him.
The truth of the statement hits me. Hits me hard, very, very hard. I realize that Sherlock is dead. What happened afterwards was indeed a hallucination. I would never see Sherlock again. We would never run in the streets of London. There would be no more entries on my blog. There would be no more deductions. No more Mycroft. No more dead bodies. No more shooting the walls. No more experiments. No heads in the fridge. No more life.
I'm rushing against time. To stop. Ready to kill. Ready to die for the man I loved. My heart is pounding, knowing that I've left Sherlock when he needed me the most. I should have known that the phone call was a fake. There was a reason why Sherlock didn't get worked up on it. I rush to Bart's praying that he's still alive. My phone rings.
"I do not pretend to be a music critique. I have killed people, I have been shot. I had my heart broken by people whom I loved all my life. I have seen more pain than you can ever bloody imagine, pretty French boy. When you played that song, it spoke to me of those things. Things that I refuse to let go but should. I thought I could
He looked at me the way you would look at someone after you asked them to marry you. With hope, with anticipation. I was slightly scared. I had no words for him.
“Two couples are approaching their conquest...Oooh, who’ll win I wonder! So close, so close! Oh, oh, that’s it! Ana and Jonathan will be seeing Round
There he was. Playing away on a violin. Almost lazily, but anyone who really saw him could at once understand that the song meant a lot to him. He later told me that it was called
Mycroft knew something. There were always pointers. Three, in case of Mycroft. Thirteen in case of an ordinary person. Thirty for John. I hated not knowing. Well, I would think about it later. Right now, I had bigger things at hand.
Mrs. Hudson helps me untie my ropes and I look at my hand. She was right. No ring. I frantically search in between the sheets and under the bed. Still no ring. My heart that had been racing, stops suddenly. I feel numb and darkness surrounds me once again.
We soon found the carriage and some demolition charges. It was obvious that the energy released by the bomb would be huge – big enough to completely detonate the Parliament. I am worried at this point, knowing that we had to act really fast or all our plans would be ruined. Timing was everything.
I really thought he would ask me about my sexuality. So, that he could dispel the rumours about me and him. Looks he doesn't care at all, if I'm straight. So, he's definitely not into me that way.
The silence was Mycroft's way of looking smug. It was equivalent to Mycroft waving his arms and yelling "I know something you don't"
One of the major reasons of why I liked Sherlock was this. He gives so much attention to everything I do, everything I wear, everywhere I go. It's hard not to get addicted to such attention. It's one of the reasons my relationships don't go well. My girlfriends know nothing, don't want to know, either. It's like they don't care about me at all. Once you get used to Sherlock's attention, you get irritated if your girlfriends forget the slightest things about you. Frankly, all of the girls I met till now just feel like silicone dolls with no brains at all. And look at Sherlock.
No answer. Strange. She was here last night (Sherlock distinctly remembered her bringing some tea for him) and it was actually quite early in the morning. Where could she have gone?
The presents included mostly promises (Mrs. Hudson would let Sherlock experiment in the kitchen every year on his birthday, Lestrade gave full access to cases they would get the following month while Molly invited him to a game of Guess the Career in which she would let Sherlock examine the limbs of every dead person on her slab while Sherlock would guess their profession). However, Mrs. Hudson provided him with some books on bee-keeping. He opened a red present already knowing who it was from. He received similar present ages ago. It could not be a phone this time.
She nods, undoubtedly pleased. The Prime Minister enters. Mycroft tries not to deduce anything about him. His needed his brain power for the issue in hand.
it. She was sitting on the corner of the table and had crossed her legs. She looked slightly disinterested, holding a cigarette in her hand that was waiting to be lit. Harry, the drummer, wore a full-fit white T-shirt which complimented his muscles quite well. He had placed his elbow on the wall to show off his biceps while placing his palm on the back of his head. Sam was sitting on a chair near the table, wearing
"Well, yes, it's better that way. I can't pretend I like them. So, yes, they are in fact from London.
Something struck me while I was pulling my chair to sit. I looked at him, who was in turn gazing lazily at me, his posture relaxed.
Sherlock is alive. He does not love me back the way I do. I have a woman in my life who was willing to take me despite my flaws, despite knowing that she would be always second in my world. Life offered me two options here: Chase Sherlock or have Mary. I was tired of chasing Sherlock. There was only one option left.
"So, you are telling me, an ordinary thief, a single person, got through your security system? A system that included Agent Delta?" John said, his face full of glee.
I instantly hate this man. He sounded too much like Mycroft except that he accepted that there were wiser heads. As for not escorting John, that explained his attitude. However, I can see that John is more than a little irritated about my frustration on being bored. I'll take the case then.
John was giddy. In an hour or so, he was finally going to meet Mr. S. He surveyed the five storey tower in front of him. The tallest museum in the world. The Blue Carbuncle was on the top of this monstrously high building. John fastened the ropes on his waist, walking towards the entrance. He walked in, through the metal detectors. He smiled when they detectors did not make a racket. All his gear was plastic, thanks to Mycroft. He soon got past the security under the guise of a tourist.
"Client!" Sherlock literally jumped out of his arm-chair and flopped about the room like a nine-year old girl. John, too used to these behavioral swings, merely got up to get his note-pad.
Sherlock: (draft) It really is over then. I had hoped the train would change things. It has. But only for me.
A shower and some tea later, I actually feel very bored. Not Sherlock-level shooting the walls bored, just normal bored. Like the kind of emptiness you have when there's nothing on the telly, no book to read or anything to do. I opened my blog, but I couldn't think of anything to write. Well, there was a lot going on in my life, but suddenly it felt too personal to share. Like those memories belong to only me and him…no, no Watson, don't go down that direction!
I could see that Greg was trying to lighten the mood. I smile, knowing that I never mattered to Sherlock anyway.
Sherlock turned it all over in his head. It was a real case alright. Look at the difference between John's pretend one and a real one. No matter how John tried, reality provided a much complex array of situations and no guarantee that you hold all the cards in your hands to win. Something fiction could never achieve. Fiction always had its solution in the box in which it revolves. Real cases, on the other hand, push you harder and harder. There is no box. You keep on looking. Real life was the ultimate puzzle.
The second scene. An old flat. A person is sleeping on the bed. The doors are locked, the windows are secured except for one. No footprints under the window. He had a visitor who spoke with an accent (according to the night guard) the previous night but he left soon. Mark died in the early hours of dawn.
We are actually planning on having a contest and the winners will be featured in the video. It is to be announced tomorrow."
The day of the Fall. My entire body is tingling with anticipation. This was it. Today would set the entire course of my life. I pace back and forth, not knowing what to do till the evening. I decide to meet .
This was strange. Sherlock never texted me for inane things like Hello. Did someone hack into his phone?
Attention. Simple, really. Poets and authors went to a lot of trouble to describe love. But, really, it all boils down to the amount of attention you gave to a person.
John: (draft) I can't give you the same amount of love in return. So, please stop. I owe you way too much already.
There was a very enthusiastic chant of "Yessss" from the seven couples. The eighth couple, however, were too engrossed observing a heated discussion between the director Mr. Sagarson and Agatha, the girl who Sherlock helped before. The discussion soon ended and Agatha brought a huge black-colored box and placed it in front of Tom.
"I am now" I reply, exasperatedly. Was he going to go on and on about the bills again? How boring. What if we had no electricity for a day? It's not easing my mood anyway.
He looked at Janine. She seemed happy, she was talking to that geek. Everyone had somebody. Except him. At the end, he was always alone. People always left
For the first time after many months, my heart beats fast. Sherlock's voice and Sherlock himself….how I missed him. I wonder idly if that was why he winked and smiled when we first met. But, the majority of mind is only thinking one thing: Sherlock.
Sherlock handed her a list of ten toxins which were likely to cause these effects. On his trip to the lab, he made a trip to his mind palace which was a sufficient store of toxins dating from the late 1600's. Molly went through the list and began opening the bags containing the clothes.
I quickly read through the letter. Expensive local paper, typed and posted by the client himself. Afraid of hackers, since he didn't mail me this. Man of impeccable taste, expensive habits.
I wasn't gay. Sherlock was just special, that's all. Even Irene fell for Sherlock, even though she was a lesbian.
“Oooh, there’s a couple almost about to make it. Will they? YES THEY DID! Congratulations Jonah and Amy! You made it to round two!” Tom announced, clearly happy with how things were going.
On the matters of trust, Hamish, it is a very fragile thing that is the beginning to all relationships. Do not break one's trust without good reason. And, also, do not trust easily. But of course, I trust your uncle Mycroft has a lecture and an exam prepared on the topic so I will not dwell on that.
He can be crazy like that sometimes.I sometimes heard the opening notes, muffled, coming from the living room, always abruptly stopped. And as the years passed by, he slowly forgot about the song completely. I don't blame him. He has a folder full of his own music now.
I was having my lunch, my fork dancing on the plate but never quite reaching my mouth when my phone made "the noise". I blushed, noticing everyone's looks on me.
Nothing. I feel nothing. Or maybe, I am feeling so many things at once that I don't know what I am feeling. Here I was, finally, FINALLY moving on, ready to propose to a woman I loved and he HAD to ruin it for me. Lately, the Universe's past-time has been ruining my life and my mind.
. In me, Hamish, you always have a friend. You always have a shoulder to cry on and a voice of hope.
The biggest secret? He was an empath. He pretended that he did not understand emotions – on the contrary, he understood them too much. That was the reason he had no friends. He could see that most of them talked to him because they needed his help. That was also the reason he loved Mrs. Hudson. She loved him just for him being him, not because of his money, looks or intellect. He was an intense person. The Holmes' boys didn't do things in halves. He hated with such visible intensity that the other person had no option but to cower or bully him. However, Sherlock loved with the same intensity as well. I still remember how Sherlock punished that American for hitting Mrs. Hudson. His love was the greatest gift anyone could possibly get.
Impossible. There were only four statues, all on pedestals. If he were on them, how could he have replaced the original after he ran away? An accomplice? Not likely.
Really, John? I expected something more along the lines of my…never mind. Favourite color…I already told you I have no favorites! It's illogical, preferring something over the other for no reason. However, purple appeases my eyes, to answer your question – SH
"Mr. Holmes, I'm Phil Sagarson. I'm currently the director to a musical video of a very prominent band which I can't name yet..."
My breathing is fast and I am pumped up in adrenaline. What was the use? There was no one to fight with. And, there was no option of flight. I could not leave Sherlock there. Besides, I may not even make it in time. I never felt angrier in my life. Sherlock would never understand responsibility. And, look where it had brought us.
I nod. My eyes are filled with tears. I'm just happy he's still alive. Happy that I did say all those things which I regretted not saying. Sherlock pulls out a plain platinum ring out of his coat and slips it on my finger. It looked beautiful. It feels wonderful. Precious, just like Sherlock. Cold, just like Sherlock felt like in the beginning, but John's warmth would soon warm the ring. However, I couldn't see the ring on my fingers which I longed to because my head was also tied down. However, I looked at Sherlock, trying to memorize him. I imprint this memory in my head forever. He kisses my palm. He kisses my forehead. And, then, he's moving away. I start moving, trying to get out of my bed. He whispers in my ear,
"They think he's having an affair, becasue he always looks so satisfied when he returns. I don't know Mr. Holmes, it is only a suspicion"
It was under these circumstances I had you, Hamish. And, like I told you, along with you, I also started growing a backbone. I found out that yes, I
"Promise me more Hamish and my mouth will be shut till asked" William finally managed to say, some of the mischief coming back into his eyes.
Sherlock: (draft) Why did you come? Why were you angry at the drug den? Why do you care? Why are you still here? Why must you come into my life every time I'm close to healing?
"If any of you should require the services of either of us, I will solve your murder. But, it takes John Watson to save your life. Trust me, I should know he's saved mine so many times and in so many ways"
"Calm down, Doctor! Come in, dinner is being served." he said cheekily, already going back to the restaurant, not bothering to look back. Somehow, both of us knew I would be going back.
"Hang on. I haven't agreed!" John said, irritated with the non-verbal agreement Sherlock and Mr. Sagarson had.
"Sir, the Prime Minister is waiting for you" Anthea said, typing frantically on her Blackberry. She had been a rock for Mycroft.
excited to have you all here. The crew had a lot of fun planning all this. We are going to have four rounds - each testing your understanding, your co-operation and like the song says, your knowledge of each other. Your first task begins this afternoon - so, I say, get some rest guys! Agatha will guide you to your rooms. Agatha?"
I gasp inwardly. I see a ring box in his coat. John was going to propose to me! He is ordering the champagne to celebrate! My heart is racing and I do everything I can to stop revealing myself to him. I am giddy with joy.
I knew that with Mycroft around, there would be no way to do what I wanted. I nod, my plan still in my head. In three years, I would join Sherlock, no matter what Mycroft did. The time-limit was to set matters straight with my sister and my parents. I wouldn't do the same thing Sherlock did to me. I nod, and Mycroft seems satisfied. He leaves.
John: (draft) But what about Janine then? Why does my brain tell me that you're manipulating her? And why does my heart desperately want it to be true? I used to be a nice person.
that they can have their own bubble of happiness. And, all we do have is hope. It drives every human to their actions. Just...give hoping a chance"
I realized what he was going to do. I yell like an animal. But too late, he has already jumped. The world goes blank to me. I can no longer see, no longer hear, no longer feel. My mind is frizzled right now. I cannot comprehend anything. Sherlock…gone? How? It was impossible. I was ready to take a bullet for him, but now? There was no way Sherlock…no, he might still be alive. The thought kick-starts my brain and I rush towards Sherlock.
"I did indeed, but where is the fun in that?" William replied, his eyes full of mischief. His lips were curved with the pleasure of teasing John and Sherlock's whole face looked like a happy schoolboy's.
Sherlock was not allowed to examine the bodies in the mortuary (Molly Hooper finally grew a backbone. Bad for Sherlock). However, Sherlock was given full access to the hotel room. Hotel rooms were his favourite to deduce. While rooms in a house told a lot about the people in them, hotel rooms revealed nothing and Sherlock had always loved a challenge. He furtively went through the suitcase.
John: (draft) Can't I just run off to a different reality before the Fall? When we were still together? Before...all this? When it was just
The story is now being continued as a part of a story called The Treasure Hunt becasue I really wanted that fic to be readable as a standalone. Sorry for the inconvenience.
"I'm sorry, what?" John asked, not taking in even a single word. It all sounded like those corny movies his girlfriends made him watch.
I see red. I go absolutely mad. All those emotions that I had pent up suddenly broke loose. Love, grief, hate, regret, surprise, gratitude – every emotion. I wonder for a second if I was hallucinating again – if my brain conjured Sherlock up in the hope that I won't be moving on. As a sign that I still loved him. But, no, Mary's looking at him as well.
"But, for the record, there are two people who have done that" John continued. He had the sudden urge to tell Sherlock what he meant to him.
Sherlock, you bastard. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't understand as to what I should feel. Sherlock was dead, and he was still wishing me a happy birthday and apologizing for not being here. Even after being dead, he still has managed to mess up the world I created. I feel very angry, frustrated that how he could control me. How, even after his death, he still managed to have a hold on me.
Of course! This was once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to talk to him. He seemed relaxed, which wasn't really that common for Sherlock
I'm John H. Watson, M.D., Late of the Army Medical Department, Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers , a humble servant to the Queen. Atleast, that's who I was.
My heart breaks, looking at the desperate reporter. If that article came out, this would how people would talk to Sherlock. We had to make this right.
How? I had no idea where Sherlock kept his stuff. It was very likely he threw them away in a fit of "My house is like a hard-drive". It was possible that they were in his room.
"Trust me Mycroft, I tried. I really really tried. He's seen me and has still decided to stay. Isn't that enough?" I curse the fact that this was the only evidence I could present. I plead. I know that if I don't convince Mycroft, he was perfectly capable of sending John to a different continent, maybe even Antarctica and there would be nothing I could do about it.
She glanced at her watch and frowned. It had been three days since the gentleman had been using the factory. She was used to him using the factory for insanely long periods of time – what she did not understand was that when the man ate and slept. He never brought food and there was no suitable place for him to sleep. Mrs. Hudson had the suspicion that he didn't eat or sleep while working. Not surprising, really. Anyone who had seen him work could see how important his work was to him. He would lose himself in his work – he wouldn't respond, wouldn't look up, wouldn't talk. Once, Mrs. Hudson found that he had set something on fire in another room. The smoke was enough to alarm her – someone who had been standing three blocks away. Yet, when she came in, she found him hunched up, doing his work, completely ignoring the smoke.
I was angry at Sherlock. Angry did not even cover it. I am sure there is no word that could describe how I am feeling right now. After the relief that came with the realization that we were not going to die, I was angry at Sherlock for manipulating me. It was like a reality check. That Sherlock paid a lot of attention to me as well as the fact that he often manipulated people's emotions. He was a good actor and certainly had the ability of making someone fall for him if need be. I stopped, startled at my realization.
theimprobableone: I read this blog for Sherlock. Could you post more about him and maybe none of your contemplation?
"Let's see. A Crown Jewel stolen under your nose. A thief daring enough to get through you AND sign his every robbery. I wouldn't have missed it for the worlds!"
To get to know me? I had a tendency to not to open up about myself. Like I said, people hated me after seeing me.
He can't do it. He just can't do it. Sherlock would have dearly liked to run away from the wedding and just cry until he cant anymore. But, no, he had to be strong. John's happiness mattered to him the most.
"The test is complete but John just texted me to ask you to eat something and only then to reveal the test results"
"What do you want, Mycroft?" I ask roughly. Mycroft was the reason of Sherlock's death. I hadn't forgotten that. I contemplate hitting him but I was bound. Again.
Sherlock was facing the door, but he could not see Mrs. Hudson for his eyes were closed. He played incessantly, hands moving rhythmically, manipulating the instrument. The music was slow at first – it talked of grief, of pain and suffering, of unrequited love. It spoke of the words that were left unspoken. This went on for an hour, Sherlock constantly slowing down each successive turn. It made Mrs. Hudson want to cry and she could see tears on Sherlock's face. The slow sad music slowly turned to a neutral tone – a slow dreary sound, a sound of acceptance. Music that talked about letting go, about giving up. His hands moved in a way she had never seen before – slow and lacking energy. His face looked defeated. He looked…broken. It slowly turned fast, it was slowly becoming a mad screeching sound, his hands moving in the speed of light. The music was talking about his frenzy, his madness crept out. Sherlock's looked mad. The noise was horrible but Sherlock didn't stop. Sherlock's hands moved and moved, their speed getting only faster.
My blood is boiling right now. I'm angry at Sherlock. Angry at him for giving in. Angry at him for even thinking that I would believe what he was saying. Angry that, clever as he was, he never would realize…that I loved him.
John was too preoccupied to hear the jeerings and the catcalls of "Gay!" and "Faggots!". He was too preoccupied to notice that the eighth couple were selected. Actually, he became unaware of everything in the world. There was only one thing in his mind and that was Sherlock's
A string of his violin broke and Mrs. Hudson could see that Sherlock's finger got cut. Blood was seeping out and was dripping on his bow. Mrs. Hudson wanted to stop him at once, but something told her not to. Sherlock needed this in order to get over his problems. As long he does not cause himself a permanent injury, it was fine. Sherlock did not stop, however. He continued to play, if possible, even faster.
A gaggle of girls and a few other people surrounded him, all of them who seemed to feel the song as much as I did. They heard the music, they closed their eyes – was it possible that this song meant as much as to them as it did for me? For me, the music talked about loss. He played the song three times in total and the more I heard it, the more it made sense. He paused after the third time, looking at his audience. He smiled at all of us, asking how we felt. The girls replied in French, using beautiful and complex words. Words that flowed like magic but whose meaning I did not know. It kind of made sense though. How else would you describe something you can never hope to completely understand? He thanked them politely. He then looked at me. It was a brief look, but he seemed
We then talked about the people to be invited. It had to be a select number of people. People whom he genuinely cared about and people who genuinely cared about him. Mrs. Hudson was on top of the list. Lestrade. Mike Stamford. She suggests Mycroft.
He loved me? Sherlock Married-to-my-work Holmes loves me? Oh, Sherlock, I'll wait for you for a thousand years if you wanted me to.
"Oh, it's not just a quiz. It's much more than that. We've ensured that no couple gets via trickery. Only genuine couples who actually know and understand each other will stand a chance. I and my wife did a test run..."
My heart skips a beat. He once told me that his work was everything to him. That he was married to it. And, I had believed that for a very long time. Was it possible that Sherlock could love me? Was it possible that he would show emotion? When it clouded his judgment? Suddenly, I'm a lot more hopeful. My stomach is filled with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Hope fills my heart and suddenly the world seems a lot more beautiful. I hug a pillow and smile like an idiot.
This time, Mycroft had no regrets tapping into Sherlock's and John's phones. With Moriarty (or his plans atleast) around, Mycroft had to protect Sherlock by any means necessary. Sherlock was blinded with grief and it haunted Mycroft every single night. Sherlock agreeing to die with a mere shrug of his shoulder, then his consequent overdose – the memories almost killed Mycroft. Unlike Sherlock, grief and anger just made Mycroft work harder. He tightened security six-fold (double the security her Majesty had), monitoring every criminal network ever known in London. He still received monthly reports on their mobile activity although Mycroft was no longer very worried about the emotional content of the texts. He had much bigger fish to fry.
They both knew that a shift in the relationship had occurred, Both of the acknowledged it and silently regretted it.
"You talk like a child. Seeing you isn't enough. That only makes him a friend. I don't want to clean up after the mess this will create. Forget him. For God's sakes, stop acting like a love-struck teenager"
"Alright Molly, okay. But I really don't think Mycroft would come to something as ridiculous as a birthday party. Oh no, wait, he'll come. There will be cake!" I explode, in a fit of hysteric giggles. She catches my mood and we both laugh like idiots for a minute or two.
After I place all the crates of memories outside, I go back into the palace, now retrieving data that would be useful for my deductions. Old crimes, dating back to the 1600's, a few experiments I conducted, crimes I solved. I put them out too, and then detonate the entire building. The palace breaks down, black ruins remain. I take my crates and Redbeard along with me to a faraway place. I build a new palace. It looked better than my previous one. I start furnishing the first room. John's room. I paint the walls with shades of lavender and purple. I open his crate. A collection of memories greet me. I picked one.
Now was the second most difficult part. Waiting until the museum was sealed. On the roof. During a January evening. And, it just started snowing. Good. Tonight was going to be good.
I masked my indifference about him not liking anything. It felt like he was indirectly telling me "You are just a guy in seven billion. Why would I choose you without reason. It's illogical. Stop dreaming man."
be there. You are worth it, Hamish. You are worth everything life put me through. Good luck, my little baby! Life is a myriad of joy and sadness - I just hope you have joy in a greater percentage.
's and a bow to his audience, he collected the money in a small bag. I put in a pound note, although I had some francs with me. He looked at the note and gave me a tiny smile, and then whispered in my ear: "Will you stay for a bit?"
"Uhh..good. Very good. Nice." John struggled with words while Ruby put cucumber slices over John's eyes.
Sherlock: (draft) I just had a nightmare. I dreamt that I arrived at the bonfire late. Must you also reside in my dreams? Wasn't reality enough?
The tension in the room suddenly rose. Even John felt a little competitive. He had known Sherlock for a greater time than any of these couples knew each other. They lived together since the first day they met. He felt that Sherlock
So, it was John who was responsible for his nine hour sleep. That narrowed things. He was a doctor. Only way – tranquilisers.
I decided to live in the flat Mycroft chose for me. There was no way I could live in 221 B after what happened. Sherlock was 221 B. I could never live there knowing that I wouldn't see Sherlock shooting the walls anymore. Or, that I would wake up at inane hours for his cases. His violin…he played beautifully when he wanted to. There would be no waking up or sleeping listening to him. I could not live there, where I'm reminded of the past I could never have again. It was too cruel and I did not want to do that to myself.
To John, it didn't matter. Admiration was the only thing he felt. He slightly regretted the fact that Mr. S would be handed over to the authorities after all this was over. Shame. What a waste of such talent.
Mr. S had a curious knack of only robbing things from museums. Treasures that belonged to the government. All the robberies Mr. S committed were neat. Simple. Elegant. No one saw him come. No one saw him go. All that remained was his signature S in the place the artifact once stood. He was seen only once, by a servant who saw him running away. His gender is the only thing they know. John was completely giddy with excitement. It wasn't everyday you meet a rival worthy of your skill set. Of course, John would be put into action only if Plan A failed.
Ok, really didn't expect you'd type this much. You do have a favorite! And, purple is my favourite too! – JW
We first covered as to where we would celebrate his party. She had this insane idea of celebrating his party in a limo. The limo would stop wherever there was a crime. After I shut down that idea, we got to working. And, I think the place we decided upon would be good. Convenient, too.
I find all the things I am looking for. I get them all wrapped and hide them in my locker at the hospital. I wanted to genuinely surprise Sherlock.
You were an adorable baby, with your two dimples and black hair. You inherited my hair and my blue eyes but you inherited John's height (don't tell your father I said that). John tells me I spent three days merely looking at you after you were born. Not surprising, really. You, Hamish, defy all logic. For no rational reason, I fell in love with you as soon as I saw you. You've given me the best gift there is Hamish – parenthood.
His hands couldn't have shaken at all. Acclimatized to violence then. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger though. So strong moral principle. You are looking for a man with a history of military service, and nerves of steel…
Sherlock felt something remarkably close to a feeling that resembled someone punching him in the gut and crushing his breath at the same time. He felt...
So, I stared at him openly while he packed away his things, a few girls helping him. He quickly shook them off, and took me to a nearby restaurant.
Being great was my only ambition in life. I wanted to leave behind a legacy where people were awed with my deductions, even after two hundred years. My brain helped me achieve that, but was I ready to sacrifice my very personality for one man? I was in the worst kind of war: A war with myself.
merciful” the spark in Tom’s eyes returned. “You are not allowed to speak nor use your hands – we will be monitoring” he said, pointing to the cameras. A huge Cheshire grin spread on his face, once he saw the discomfort of his contestants.
They both in fact had a pretty good time. John went back to his room, pleased with how life was. He completely forgot what it is that he was going to do tomorrow.
Sherlock: (draft) I'll be honest. I was looking forward to your eulogy at my funeral today. Why didn't you come?
No. No no no no. I was over Sherlock. Universe, listen to me. I am married now. I am over Sherlock. I loved Mary.
Well, the first crime is not mine. It belongs to ACD. The story is called the Devil's Foot I think. However, all other puzzles, the second crime, rhymes etc. are mine
For the first time, my brain worked in a speed that could rival Sherlock's. All the decisions that I had made, all the things that I could have done better, all the things that I was yet to do…they all came crashing down in my mind. My memories with Harry, my regret about Harry's drinking, the fallout between Dad and Harry because of her sexuality, my Mom's cooking, my school days, my girlfriends, my college days, days in the Army, meeting Sherlock. Sherlock. As I walked down memory lane in the speed of light, I realized I wasn't angry at Sherlock. There was no point in being angry with him now. I felt gratitude for the man who was now going to kill me. Without Sherlock, every day would have felt like death. I was a breathing corpse before I met Sherlock. And, if this was what I had to pay, I would do it.
Dancing. Dancing. Sherlock was dancing. It was a little sad actually, for he was dancing with an imaginary partner. An imaginary partner who seemed to be exactly of John's height.
Sherlock sat on his own bed, recalling the adventures of the day. He had woken up confused and was now even more confused. Sherlock opened Mycroft's present, an attempt to think about something else. They were wedding rings, a family heirloom. The note read:
"Spare me the lecture, Molly. I most certainly did not hallucinate the event!" I yell. My anger at Sherlock for making me doubt what happened was killing me.
Sherlock just gave John his usual "I'm fabulous and you know it" look and continued his scan. John felt a rush of his usual exasperated affection for his friend. He shaked his head, smiling to himself.
If you are reading this, it means I and John believe that you have come of age. That you are finally ready to break out of the shell we've made for you. I know that you've been very eager to "take on the world", but I assure you, it is not as beautiful as you've painted. There aren't many things that you will actually like but they are the things worth fighting for. They are the things that will define you and your life.
I see a momentary gleam of satisfaction in his eyes. Maybe, Sherlock did have something in his mind palace. Sherlock thinks hard. I could see that he was thinking in a speed he never thought in before. I pray to God that he had something in his mind palace that would help us.
Inside, the old man looks up. The old man looks no longer older. His hunchback is gone. His eyes sparkle with a radiance that comes with genius. Agent Delta's footsteps might echo like the gong of death, but the old man was Satan.
John, on the other hand, merely looked at Sherlock, a mask of no emotion. He was learning from Sherlock, it would seem.
"Well, why are you still listening to lanky 'ol me? Go ahead, talk to them!" he made a gesture as if he were presenting royalty.
I had only two options now: Either text Sherlock or ask Mycroft. Both the options were as appealing as my life in the suburbs. I did not want to text Sherlock, wanting to believe that he did not receive my previous text. I did not want to ask Mycroft because I no longer trusted him. The man had the cunning worthy of Salazar Slytherin.
"Wait, what?" Frankly, I was too happy to see Sherlock again that I momentarily lost concentration in the conversation. I should really stop staring at him. Sherlock would notice at once.
barrier was John's sexuality. John showed no history of dating men. Even if he were gay, there was a reason Sherlock didn't scream and hug people with joy. Because he
It made complete sense. Sherlock wasn't allowed to see the bodies for there were none. A case was easy to fabricate but a body wasn't. It also explained the hotel room – a home was impossible to create for someone like Sherlock. A home is the ultimate encyclopaedia of a person's life. The effort required would be tremendous. Now that Sherlock had a better understanding of things, he realised that he should have noted the notorious absence of interviews with suspects. Sherlock merely assumed that Lestrade was scared about Sherlock's involvement. However, it had been very clever of John to make that all up.
After a few minutes of idle passing, his phone started buzzing slightly and John took a step forward to test it. It buzzed a little harder and John immediately changed direction. He walked in a zig-zag manner, every step sending more blood to his heart, every vibration getting more intense.
I had an extremely tiring day. I was actually thankful that Sherlock didn't invite me to the case he was working on (the client wanted complete anonymity – he would only trust Sherlock). Two minor surgeries, four clinic patients and a nasty break-up, it looked like the universe was against me today. Well, truth to be told, I wasn't really that into her, anyway. The only silver lining was that Sherlock wasn't home so there was no need to worry about the house. I opened the door to 221 B, absent-mindedly checking the knocker to see if Mycroft was here (Sherlock's ways were rubbing off on me). It's been a long time since Mycroft visited the flat, but again, things have been pretty rough between him and me after the…the Fall.
Perhaps they could see it in my face, or perhaps Sherlock loved me enough to know that giving you up was something I could never move on from. So, they made me godmother. There was never a day more happier than realising I could be a part of your life. Your childhood is an abundance of memories I will always remember and cherish. I will never forget the kid with his two broken front teeth and eyepatch, brandishing a sword and yelling "Walk the plank! Walk the plank!"
I don't know what to say. Molly began crying again but I hardly pay attention to her. My world was collapsing. I was on the brink of insanity. I feel many things, so many things that I don't know what I feel anymore. Sherlock was here yesterday. I was surer of the fact than my own name. I don't understand. Forget understand, I didn't even know what was happening to me. But, then, something hits me.
for nine hours. Woke up to find Mycroft texting him and now Sherlock couldn't even reply! He called out to the only constant in his entire life in 221 B.
I looked at John. He's a good actor, but he didn't deceive me. One look, and I knew who the shooter was. I wasn't horrified. I was filled with awe.
I did not know what to do. I decided to stay in a hotel. I was too much of a coward to face John after what happened. I needed time to process. I needed time to ponder over Mycroft's challenge. I needed time to know what exactly I felt about John Watson. I decide to make my new mind palace. I would need it for whatever Mycroft was planning next. I close my eyes. I am instantly transported to a castle in the country. I walk on the green grass, enjoying the wind on my face. My castle was crumbling and was filled with moss. I go inside.
No, not an intervention. Was Molly going to do a medical check-up? Was that why John was buttering Sherlock up? That must be it. The knife was waiting for surgery.
Sherlock: (draft) One more year and I'll come back home. Come back to you. If you still want me, that is.
Mrs. Hudson leaves, satisfied. Sherlock was indeed not so calm as he appeared. She sighed. Only if Sherlock had had the guts to tell John he loved him. It was too late now.
Diana's suitcase was a mess of tops, make-up and some jewellery. Sherlock had no idea why there were so many frilly clothes around. Lace was everywhere. He found some stockings that would make The Woman proud. Lestrade blushed at the amount of lingerie the woman had and excused himself.
My eyes have teared up long before my pen touched the paper so forgive me for the smudges. On second thoughts, I should have typed this. Death was never a thing which scared me. Death was inevitable, death happens to everyone. That is absolute fact and I never really felt afraid of it. Until now. Now that I finally have friends who truly care for me and the most beautiful godson - I am terrified of death. I am terrified of the damage my death will cause. I am terrified of not being able to be there for you.
After a few vibration-filled minutes, all the couples were asked to move to a different room. John used this diversion to deactivate the app and with some slight surprise, saw that Sherlock was furiously trying to do the same, albeit in a much more discreet manner. He soon succeeded.
Tom was standing in the centre of a room which very much looked like the dressing-rooms on the telly. There were huge mirrors everywhere, not to mention the tons of make-up kits piled away neatly. There were five guys and three girls standing beside Tom, all of them inspecting the eight couples. Tom waved at them.
Sherlock Holmes: Time was of essence, John. Wouldn't expect you to understand, seeing that you were free enough to contemplate and be poetic. Poetic!
Molly looked out her window, and saw John boarding a cab. She smiled. Personally, she thought John did love Sherlock. His eyes lit up whenever she said Sherlock. He reminded her a little of her old love-smitten self. But she wondered if it was a crush. It wasn't her place to know. It wasn't his place to know, either. She frowns and takes her phone on the table.
There were a pile of boxes waiting for him on the armchair. Sherlock deposited his present gifts into his armchair. He swallowed once or twice, determined to say the things that he
John was glad that Sherlock was already blindfolded because his cheeks were burning red. The vibration was
I see red. I've never hated Mycroft more. How dare he interfere again in my life? This was one of the most important decisions of my life. I hate him. I swear he'll pay for this. I knew what was coming. He'll send men to kidnap me if I don't go to him. This had happened before.
Sherlock: (draft) I'm really scared about what will happen after this - Would you forgive me? Would you even remember me?
I was so anxious with the matters at hand that the day at the hospital was a complete disaster. I prescribed cough medicine to a kid with stomachache. Luckily, I realized what I was doing and was able to correct it. Nonetheless, I was very distracted and Sarah kept shooting me dirty looks, passing a comment about attending a book fair and giggling.
"Hello again! Before we begin filming, we thought we would give you a treat. Let me introduce you to the power behind all our shoots –
Why did I fall for him? Easy, really. Attention. Seriously, who could not fall for the amount of attention he showed, despite my sexuality, despite everything?
A laptop was brought onto the stage and the instructions were clear. Each member would pick a four digit number and type it on the screen which would then be visible via the projector they had on stage.
"If you had known, you would have made the whole world know that you know. You would have banged open the doors with a ready quip in hand to show us all that you figured it all out" John said. Sherlock accepted defeat, that is, he did not argue further and let John take his coat to hang.
Sherlock sighs internally. He had handled that quite well. He goes into the hall, planning to go to his mind palace and lock all the feelings again.
After that tedious meeting with the Minister, who only got redder and redder after each sentence Mycroft spoke, Mycroft met tons of other people, all of them demanding as to what he was doing in regards to the case. This wouldn't do.
Suddenly, the lights turn on and the timer starts. I am insanely angry at Sherlock right now. He led us to this…this suicide plan of his and we could die. How irresponsible of him! I yell:
All the other couples were either overly excited about meeting the band or too determined to win. They were whispering to each other and John caught the gist of their conversations.
That is what is wrong with all of us! We are so desperate to be heard that we are just waiting for our turn in a conversation!" He stopped abruptly, pouting.
"I know exactly how that feels. The first time I met Matt, I was shaking" he acknowledged, shooting a knowing look at Matt.
People's thoughts aren't set in stones. They are mere clouds – drifting aimlessly, content to be at a place but forced to change with a strong wind. However, Sherlock wasn't like them. When he did something, he did it fully. If he were to
A twenty something girl quickly came and in her haste, dropped the notebook she was carrying. Sherlock, no,
That brought John right back to Earth. He smiled at the audience and waved at them. Now, that the couples had been selected, the rest of the auditorium quietened down. Most of them were in tears while the rest merely seemed to be happy to stay and look at their favorite band in real life. The crew ushered them to another room so that they could receive their instructions while the band played a parting song for the crowds.
He heaved a sigh of relief after the contouring nightmare was finally over. Ruby then proceeded to his eyes and lips with careful strokes. John had to appreciate her patience and accuracy. She worked on him slowly while John could only impatiently wait to open his eyes. He finally opened his eyes to see Ruby washing her brushes nearby, giggling a little while William looked sheepish. He looked at himself in the mirror and disbelief
"Stop sulking and look at this. It's a case" he said. But something was off. John's eyes weren't shining with the thrill of a case. No violence in the crime then. It's going to be boring then. A two, maybe?
it could resolve his boredom. Well, at least it explained a few things. Like Mycroft's warning that he wouldn't help. Like Sherlock would actually take Mycroft's help. What it didn't explain however, was if John had gotten the idea last night, how did he buy the envelope five days prior? Must be for something else. It didn't matter. He had bigger things to think about.
He soon reached the top, sighing slightly. He had to use the staircase as the elevator was too conspicuous. No one knew that a man was on the top. Of course, it didn't matter. The room that stored the Blue Carbuncle was off limits. It had been sealed with both physical and digital locks. It was impossible to get into the room using the door.
He sees the wrinkled mess of a man hunched up, working with the pride of Britain. The man does not even look up. The old man's face is contorted with concentration, his hands moving with precision. His hands are wrinkled too, but they never falter. There are only two things in the old man's world: Him and the diamond. The man was looking at the diamond as a mother would look at her child. Each stroke the man made to the diamond was like a dagger through the Agent's heart. One wrong stroke and the symbol of Britain would be forever lost. The agent approaches him and asks:
If you ever feel lost, tired or perhaps defeated, remember that you always have a home to return to. A place where you get hot cocoa in winter and an iced tea during the summer but a lot of love no matter the weather. You will always have the three of us through thick and thin, for better or for worse. You have us, hon.
My heart breaks, looking at his expression. He is looking at me, his mouth telling me to get the hell out but his eyes begging me to stay. He was staring at me, deducing my every movement, every breath. He seemed to have forgotten about the looked at me like a man taking the biggest gamble of his life would. Of course, I realized all this later. Then, I was only thinking of possibilities that could save us. I was not giving up yet.
John: (draft) Those two years were a test aren't they? A test of my loyalty. I failed and this is my punishment. A punishment I fully deserve.
He would think and then decide. John moves closer slowly, cruelly. Because dream John knows the power of anticipation. He leans in, letting his breathe tickle Sherlock's lips. He looks Sherlock right in the eye, they would gaze at each other for an eternity and then John's lips brush Sherlock's. Sherlock sighs (slightly moans) at the thought, furious that his brain wouldn't let him see further. He knew real life was rarely so neat. Or, so he told himself in the morning, when the impulse to touch John would decrease considerably.
She went inside, shaking her head at mess the man had managed to make. She made her way through the obstacle race he created. She stopped at the door, trying to decipher his mood. If he was yelling, it meant she shouldn't go in. If he was shooting the walls (no exaggeration), it meant he wanted company. The sound of machinery meant he was working and there would be no use in going inside. He wouldn't notice her. But, he was silent. Silence usually meant deep contemplation. She went in, determined to make him eat something.
The tea! Mrs. Hudson was in on it too! He went to the kitchen and sure enough the cup was in the sink, staring at him innocently. He picked it up and sniffed it. That confirmed it.
John: (draft) I wish that I had never met you. Then, there would be no need for me to want you now. No need for crying over you. No need for heartbreak. No need for pain or tears. No need for forgotten promises. No need for trying to sleep but not being able to. No need, for everything you've done to make me feel like absolutely nothing.
I cut the phone. Honestly, the British Government deserved some respect. It was time I put Operation Lazarus in motion. I called Sylvia, and instructed her. It was crucial everything went to plan. If she was surprised, she didn't show it. I trained her well, then.
Mycroft was the last person I wanted to see. Especially when he could deduce that I wanted to kill myself. Well if he noticed it, he didn't show it.
"I need you to run a toxin test on the clothes" Sherlock said, slightly out of breath. Two hours were already up and Sherlock had no idea as to how many puzzles John had for him. Not that he was complaining.
There was a pause. A pause in which both looked at each other in the eyes, hoping that the other would break the silence. Every moment felt important, every breath heavy. This was the case with all important moments. They appeared trivial to outsiders.
"It'll take me two hours to run all the tests. These are some unusual toxins you have in there. It should make the process easier."
"Look Sherlock, I know your philosophy okay? I've talked to Mycroft. He was the one who convinced me to go for it since you were bi. Sherlock, there's a reason why I...
John was not confident that they would catch Mr. S. They secured all known museums in London. Triple security was assigned to museums like the British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Gallery. They did now know when Mr. S would strike but they were on constant alert. But, hell, Mr. S got through the Delta Team. John knew it was only a matter of time for Mr. S to strike again and thus launching plan B.
I look at Sherlock, head bent in concentration over some experiment near the kitchen table. I smile. He was worth it, worth the hassle of body parts, worth risking your life for, running around criminals all day. I am in too deep, I realize.
"Sherlock, Sherlock! Are you even listening?" John's voice cuts through my contemplation. He was waving a paper towards me.
The second string also broke. His hand was filled with blood. The carpet was also slowly turning red. Sherlock seemed to not even realize that his hand was injured.
He tried to deduce the gits, but they were skilfully packed in shapeless boxes. He opened them, resigned that he would have to wait to know the contents of the box, and truth to be told, he was enjoying this a little. Was this how normal people felt like when they opened a present?
but when he reached the auditorium, atleast half of London's population seemed to have made it their mission to get selected. John adjusted his wig nervously and gave their details to the man in charge. The couples would be given a number and it was more or less like a lottery draw. John texted their number
I went to Molly's home to plan a surprise party for Sherlock. I knew he would love a surprise, especially since he was very rarely surprised. Molly seemed to be thinking along the same lines. I didn't know what Molly thought of Sherlock now. But she was definitely not the Molly I first met. I mean, she had the guts to slap him! I was definitely impressed and I think even Sherlock was.
She rummaged through the drawers, her mind, no doubt, whirring with different ideas. She took out a contouring palette and looked at his face again. She shook her head in defeat after a minute. She ended up highlighting his cheekbones and outlining his lips and eyes.
Have your parents ever tell you the story of your conception? Well, let me give you the uncensored version. Sherlock never wanted a kid. (Not to worry, he changed his mind as soon as he saw you! You were a bundle of cuteness!) He was scared to be with Rosie and it took a lot of effort from John's side to convince Sherlock that, yes, he was Rosie's step-father. It took him a lot of time to accept that. You can still see him being a little uncertain with handling Rosie. I remember the day they asked me to do this honor. Sherlock was pacing in the lab, repeatedly telling John that he did not have it in him. (The words were "I can't even
It was midnight when Mrs. Hudson woke up. She could hear Sherlock's violin, his music pouring from all corners of the room. She crept upstairs and peeped through the door to hear him better.
He walked into the elevators with ten minutes to spare in his stopwatch. He was going to finish the hunt on time. However, he didn't know if he was going to finish the hunt (he still did not know what everyone knew – did that count?)
I know it's just my pessimism talking. John had renewed long lost hopes. The hope that I'd find someone who loved me, someone who would make me their number one priority, someone who actually cares, someone with pure intentions.
Molly is single. I refuse to romaticise her in this fic. She can't ask for someone's heart while she can't give them hers. She knows this and slowly accepts it. Hamish does not know that Molly loved/s Sherlock.
"Now, the crew members are pretty excited about this. They are the ones organizing the contest. My job is to film you all and put the winners clips in the video. So, without further ado, let me introduce you to Mr. Garibaldi!" Mr. Sagarson said and walked away, no doubt to being filming right from this moment.
Mrs. Hudson shakes her head, thinking fondly of that memory. He wasn't aloof, despite what people thought of him in their first glance. He was a good man, a man who cared. A man who went through a lot. A man who liked a challenge. This, she gathered during the few times he talked to her. She knew that he cared about her. There was one time when an American had broken into the factory, trying to steal some equipment. She had confronted him, but the American tied her up, stole whatever he wanted to and left. The look on his face when he found her tied up was proof enough that he loved her. She didn't know how, but he dragged the American back, made him apologize to her and return everything that he had stolen. He was a son she wished she had.
Sherlock had no idea what made him do this, he wasn't even aware of deciding to do this, but somehow he found himself walking towards the coat hanger and whispering:
This was always the case with Sherlock. Sherlock always left him alone when John needed him the most. Something clicks in John's mind. It felt like a sign. Like marrying Mary was the right thing to do.
Sherlock: (draft) I'll just stay here, being in love with you. And then in the end, you can break my heart.
Sherlock: (draft) Mycroft says death makes people like you. It's a strange feeling, looking at your own coffin.
There was a shocked silence while the eight couples took in everything and then began a lot of "OH MY GOD"s, hooting and whistles. The band lost their composure and began laughing, all of them transformed into normal people once again and the room felt a lot cooler.
"Sherlock" he would greet, his eyes saying it all. You are ordinary. Just like the others. He looks a little disappointed.
irrational agreed but do you think every man on this planet loves believing they will be happily married ever after? No. They hope. They
"Look at that woman in red heels. Obviously cheating. And, the guy currently on the phone? He's gay but doesn't know how to tell his wife"
Also note that these reports contain the following messages – messages that have been sent, messages that failed to reach the other person due to network issues and messages stored as drafts."
Sherlock entered. The atmosphere was awkward, nothing like the easygoing attitude before. John looked at Sherlock for something to say while Sherlock waited for John. They both stared at each other, not wanting to break the moment.
Half an hour later, Sherlock found himself in 221 B, investigating a double murder. The case seemed easy in the beginning but soon proved to be complex. A newly married couple, spending a part of their honeymoon in London, were killed in their hotel room two days ago. They put a Do Not Disturb sign out the door and the hotel crew merely giggled at the door and did not check on them for a day. Finally, they had to disturb them when they needed to replace the towels. The husband died to a heavy blow on the head from a blunt object and the wife was smothered by a pillow. Naturally, suspicion lay on the hotel staff.
Well, those and three pieces of bloodied wood in the trash which was what remained of Sherlock's violin.
John: We're having a small party this weekend. A meet-the-baby sorts of thing. Please let us know if you aren't coming. Love, Mary and John.
Sherlock was momentarily blinded by the light. It took him exactly five seconds to realise what was happening. Great big balloons were everywhere, but surprisingly they had quite a classy look to them. There was a chocolate cake filled with candles (stupid! That explained why John insisted Sherlock having a differently flavoured slice of cake every breakfast. Sherlock distinctly remembered eating a little more of the chocolate slice). A knife was indeed, like John said, waiting. The deduction was
