Sam stood staring at his phone and Gabe nudged his elbow, prompting Sam to immediately wrap an arm around his shoulders, pulling him close.
It was running on five p.m. when the door chimed, and he turned with a smile that froze on his face when Cas entered the shop, looking nervous.
"No biting your lip, angel, I wanna hear you," Dean murmured, then bent to his task, slowly teasing his tongue around Cas' rim until he was shaking and mewling with every stroke. Spearing his tongue, Dean pressed into Cas' body, prompting a surprised shout from his lover.
Dance after dance, Dean and Cas moved together, leaving each other's sides only long enough for the speeches. Dean managed to get through his speech with only a few tears, choking up only once. He signed slowly but clearly, having practiced for months to get it right. Dean kept it together, other than a heavy breath. Until his moose of a brother leapt from his seat and scooped him clear off the floor, then his breath left him in a rush as Sam crushed his ribs enthusiastically as he thanked Dean. Eileen didn't bother with words, just pulled him down and kissed his cheek, her dark brown eyes shining with tears.
"I won't. I like them." Cas kissed along his neck softly, down his spine, then slowly pulled his panties down, exposing his sore, reddened cheeks and the plug between them. "Now this… this was unexpected."
Movement caught his attention suddenly, and he glanced up to find Cas offering him his fork with a waggle, as though playing airplane with a toddler.
“Do I need to dig through my stuff and find my noise cancelling headphones?” he asked, sending his brother bitch-face number thirty-seven.
“Jo,” he waited until she met his stare, “in answer to your question from earlier, I don't think I am, but I'll try every day for the rest of my life to be.”
"Get out of those jeans then, you've got me!" Dean squirmed out from under Cas and rolled to his left, then began rummaging around on the bedside table. "Tell me you've got lube!" he demanded as he rifled the drawer. A moment later he cried out in surprise and arousal as Cas' tongue found his hole, lapping at his pucker and moaning against his skin. He collapsed to the bed, his face buried in the crook of his elbow even as he squirmed. "Fuck, Cas!"
Cas laughed then, low and smug, and smacked Dean’s ass. “Leave it on the chair. You think I wear that stuff to clubs and don’t have someone on tap to clean it properly?” Cas bent and kissed the spot he’d just slapped, then crawled off the bed to head to the bathroom. Dean struggled out of the vest and undid his tie, only just starting on the buttons of his dress shirt when Cas returned with a cloth.
It took Dean several tries and a rough clearing of his throat to get his voice back to an approximation of his regular voice, and then all he could say was,
"Hmmm?" Cas continued to kiss along Dean's throat, down to where it met the collarbone, nibbling at his skin. Dean whimpered as goosebumps shivered down his back. One of Cas' hands snaked under his shirts and slid over his spine and Dean moaned at the touch.
“Holy fuck,” he breathed, drawing a low, satisfied chuckle from his lover. Cas slipped from his body then and Dean grimaced. “Hope you’ve got another blanket handy though. And a good dry cleaner you can recommend.”
Dean hadn't merged with his wolf fully since he was a teen, one of the few things his father had managed to teach them well before he died. But he realized now that his wolf had always held something back.
Mention of rape/non-con, underage pregnancy as a result, abuse causing an earlier miscarriage. No details given of the rape.
“Angel, I want you,” Dean murmured, meeting his gaze, his eyes fully gold ringing the black. “I want you inside me, I want you to mark me with your teeth, and I want you to mount me. I want to present for you, then I want you to fill me with your cock, with your come. I want to come on your cock, screaming your name. And I want you to shift, I want those claws against my hips again. I want you to lose control, to fuck me hard and long, and I want you howling so loudly people across town can hear you. I want you to bite me, bleed me, claim me every way you can.”
“Fuck, man, you a vampire or something?” Dean mumbled, and Cas laughed softly, breathing heavily against his bruised skin.
“Alright, Ash? Oh! Um, hey Ellen, Ash had to go? Yeah. No, no. Um...” Gabe grinned as his Alpha stammered like a pup caught in a lie, and decided to help.
“Dean, want you to make love to me," Cas murmured quietly when their lips parted. Dean moaned. They didn't switch often, but who was he to deny his lover anything, especially a request like that?
Cas grinned at him shyly. “That and when we left the hall last night you called my place ‘home’ when I asked you if we should come here.”
***Dean leads Cas on a chase into the woods, where both mates shift fully before mating and trading bites.
“You wouldn't deprive me of my livelihood, would you, Alpha?” Dean managed to look at Cas through his lashes, despite Cas still fumbling with his seatbelt. Dean was biting back a smirk as Cas muttered under his breath about disrespectful Omegas needing to be shown a firm hand. Meanwhile, Bobby was watching them both in feigned disgust.
Dean keened at the intrusion, and Cas began a slow, rolling thrust into his tight heat. The position made Dean so tight, and Cas groaned at the squeeze around his cock.
His Alpha nudged him with his muzzle and Dean sank to his haunches with a bark, his tail wagging briefly before curling to the side. He felt his Alpha's tongue lap over his hole for the first time and whined again, shifting his stance to raise his hindquarters. His Alpha had buried his snout against his hole, lapping at the slick still pouring from him, and the Omega was quickly reduced to whines and quiet yips.
“I can see what you ‘were just’ doin’, ya idjit. Now get inside before your sister gets out here and threatens to skin your Alpha for abandoning you. Why didncha just say he was in the car and you'd be right back?”
Dean cried out as the paddle smacked down against his ass, followed immediately by a blow to the other side. Cas ran his hand gently over the marks, then bent and kissed his Omega’s reddened flesh. He ran his tongue over him, then drew back and struck with the paddle again, left then right, pausing between each set to caress the abused skin tenderly.
“Put your arms around me, and move, please, Sam. Slow,” he instructed, and a whine escaped his throat as Sam wrapped his arms around him and gently began to thrust up into him.
“That doesn't surprise me, I hear you've had practice.” Jo smirked, refilling their coffees as Dean choked on his burger.
"Hey, those were my favourite jeans!" he complained, even as Cas ripped his own shirt free and unbuckled his belt. The slow drag of his zipper made Dean's cock jump, then a sharp slap landed on his ass. "Ah, fuck!"
"Now?" He kissed along Dean's cheek to the point of his jaw, then nibbled on his earlobe, sending a wave of goosebumps over Dean's skin. "Now I wanna take you to my room and suck you off."
Gabe looked at him intently for a moment. “Does Deano need to be taken care of?” he asked, curiously. “He seems like the epitome of liberated Omega, though the fact that he looks like an Alpha likely doesn't hurt.”
A sudden commotion at his side reminded him they were at his workplace, and he froze. Charlie snickered next to him as she bustled behind the counter to wrap a bouquet for her customer, an elderly Omega who watched them with amusement.
“Hello, Dean… I was hoping you’d be back,” he said gruffly, picking at a sticker on the counter absently. Dean was hyper-aware of Charlie at his side, her ears having grown by inches to listen to every word.
Tossing back his shot of something called a purple nurple, Dean's eyes popped at the hit of alcoholic sweetness. Shaking his head sharply, he ordered another, then another. He fired them back, looking around hopefully. Dean planned on being a sloppy mess by the end of the night, in more ways than one.
"You have no idea. He keeps eating my inventory!" Cas growled, and Dean bit back a whimper as his body struggled valiantly to respond. For perhaps the first time in his adult life, nothing happened, and he was grateful, but still, he ached.
“It really isn’t fine. He clearly isn’t mature enough to know that no means no. I understand that you don’t want to get the school involved but if he does anything else, at least tell me. Please, you don’t have to try to handle this all by yourself, Dean,” Cas pleaded, resting a hand on Dean’s knee.
“Yeah but you love us,” Charlie sang, seeing straight through Dean’s words. Before, Dean could grudgingly agree, a commotion started up at the front of the room.
Thanks once more for all the kudos and comments! They make my day! And as always, thanks to my beta Kit! You rock!
Now that Cas was a zombie there would have to be a last minute change to the war plan and they would need to re-arrange the escorts for tomorrow. Dean realized that he would also need to start hiding the map under his bed when Cas was in the room.
“I survived last year and got zombified the year before that. I think Dean made it his personal goal to hit me with as many socks as possible...” Charlie pouted as Dean chuckled at the memory.
“Dean, hang on,” Cas called after him but Dean threw the door open, ready to chew Jo out for interrupting them.
“Dean, Charlie, you remember Meg?” Cas asked turning in his seat to face them as well, a hopeful smile on his face.
“Yeah, sure. Easy as pie,” Jo snorted but there was a definite smile under the snark. Dean added a few finishing touches to the map and capped the marker with a snap.
The group finished up their lunch and started dispersing early, apparently spreading out over campus to keep an eye out for Michael before Dean would need to leave. Cas and Meg were the last to leave but as they stood, Dean realized he needed to get something off his chest.
“Cas! Son of a bitch...” Dean had no choice but to comply. Michael was still hot on his tail after his taunting and there was a gleam in his eye that actually kind of concerned him. Dean sprinted as fast as his legs would carry him and gripped the two socks he carried nervously, hoping that Cas hadn’t just ditched him to save his own skin.
Dean glanced back and saw they only had the one zombie on them now. He made a split second decision and threw his last sock at the zombie, hitting her solidly in the arm. She threw her hands up in exasperation and sat down on the ground in a huff and Dean sprinted to catch back up to Charlie.
“Nothing, I just… I talked to Cas. About that thing you mentioned the other day. About why you’ve been helping.”
Immediately that familiar black clothed figure stepped into the dusky light from around the corner of the building to Dean’s left and Dean felt a wave of relief pour through him. Cas pulled his hood down and his complete confusion and worry was clearly visible as Dean angled to sprint directly to him. He spared one glance over his shoulder to the dorm door and saw Michael was out the door and headed towards them.
Dean texted Charlie about the encounter the second he got to his class and they both pored over the details, wondering what the hell was going on.
“Dark brown hair, always wearing that leather jacket, reminds ya’ of a Rottweiler in the body of a Pomeranian?”
The dining hall came into view as he rounded the corner of another dorm building and Cas was nowhere in sight. Dean could hear the pounding of Michael’s footsteps behind him and he knew that he wouldn’t make it to the door in time before Michael caught him. Only one thing for it, it was time to make a stand. Dean spun around and threw a sock, effectively stopping Michael from continuing a direct pursuit but not quite managing to hit him. One sock left at the ready, Dean backed up to the wall of the dining hall. His heart pounding in his chest and breathing heavily, Dean realized he was completely cornered now.
They settled down after a few moments and Dean rubbed the tears out of his eyes. The room was silent then. When Dean turned his head to look over at his friend, Cas was right there looking back at him with those startlingly blue eyes, a soft smile on his face. Dean’s breath caught at the sudden electricity in the air. Dean panicked.
“10 minutes left,” Ash called out as Dean approached. He dropped the box onto the growing pile and ran back out into the darkness, lamenting the fact that as part of the rules for the game, they couldn’t stop to rest in the drop off zone. Just as Dean caught sight of Charlie, she frantically pointed behind him. Dean spun and saw Meg running towards him. Shit! Dean threw his only sock and Meg, ever confusing Meg, caught it and grinned. Dean pushed away the many questions that popped into his head and turned back to Charlie, who looked similarly stunned. Before he could even acknowledge the weirdness, a dark figure in a familiar dark hoodie appeared directly behind Charlie and wasted no time in pulling one of the socks from her hip.
Step 2: He and Charlie swing around the left side of campus to get to the science building while Benny and Cas loop back to the left to get Jo.
Dean stared at his phone in disbelief. He glanced around behind him, searching for Cas in the crowd but didn’t see that familiar shock of dark hair. The doors to the student center were around the corner and the room they were in had no windows to the outside so Cas couldn’t be spying on them, could he?
“Look, I get it. If I was in your position, I probably would have snapped too. Jo definitely wasn’t helping.”
Dean and Charlie sprinted the rest of the way to the door, arriving far before the zombie Charlie had spotted could reach them. Dean couldn’t help but stick his tongue out at the guy through the wall of windows as he slowed to a stop. The guy flipped him off with a friendly but exasperated smile before jogging off to undoubtedly find some other humans to chase. That’s part of what Dean loved about all of this; For how competitive it got, it was still a game. Sometimes it was a very high intensity and nerve wracking game, but a game nonetheless.
“Angel? I have a new nickname now?” Cas asked with a head tilt. Dean rolled back the conversation in his head.
“We still have one more day of this shit…” Dean panted as he slowly straightened up, still bracing a hand on the wall. Cas, holding Charlie’s bandolier, came jogging through the door looking as composed as ever followed by a seething Michael.
“Jesus, Jo…” Dean sighed. Cas tilted his head up and Dean turned his phone so he could also read the flurry of texts. The illumination from the screen cast a soft glow on Cas’ features making him look nearly ethereal. Dean was completely captivated. Cas huffed a laugh against Dean’s collarbone and laid his head back down.
Dean slowed to a jog as he reached the meeting spot. Charlie was nowhere in sight but just as he was about to call it a lost cause, her head popped up from behind a car two rows down.
“Not quite the plan,” Dean chuckled, imagining the affronted look Cas would undoubtedly have at Dean trying to put a bell on him for real. “I want to leave them inside the rolled up map so they jingle when he picks it up. That should wake me up, easy.”
“Come on, my dorm is closer and Gilda is in class.” The look on her face told Dean that this was not negotiable so he reluctantly fell in line behind her.
“Jesus, Cas! Gotta put a bell on you or something…” Dean turned back and busied himself with his pizza, ignoring the not so muffled snickers from his friends.
This was hardly their first hug, far from it. They’d always been fairly touchy with each other, always in each other’s space. But this was the first time it was more than just a quick hug complete with manly back slapping before parting. This was more than an arm flung over a shoulder on Charlie’s futon on movie night. This was more than a shoulder check as they passed in a hallway. This was deeper, more meaningful. This was Dean pouring all of his hopes for what could be into a single embrace.
“I hope that wasn’t Charlie,” Cas said, looking entirely too relaxed to be participating in an apocalypse.
Dean puzzled over what kind of present Charlie could mean before shoving his phone in his pocket. He headed for the exit after locking the door to the room, checking the halls as he went. Briefly, he wondered if it was a trick to lead him straight to Cas. Based on how supportive she had been when Dean talked to her about the whole situation back on Tuesday, he didn’t think that was very likely so he decided to take her word for it.
“That’s why I met up with her on Tuesday. I was asking her for help. I told her about our bet and she agreed to help me. So did Benny and Jo. Charlie too after lunch today,” Cas stated like it was not the most shocking revelation so far.
“Can’t go giving away all of the trade secrets but we’d be happy to give ya some pointers,” Dean replied, angling slightly further away from the science building.
“It’s alright, I’ll catch up with you later,” Cas said to Meg and turned back for the exit. They both watched him leave for a moment before Meg turned back to the table.
“How… I don’t know who you’re talking about.” Michael replied, obviously nervous. A pair of humans ran past, being chased by four zombies and the three of them completely ignored it.
Dean chuckled under his breath as he took one more look back at Cas, who Benny had caught back up with. Dean had known for years now that Cas could be a sarcastic asshole, and yet, it kinda endeared him even more to the man. Cas was surprisingly quick witted and his humor was drier than a desert but it suited him. It still made Dean’s heart warm every time he managed to get a genuine laugh out of Cas, as infrequently as it happened. His gummy smile that only came out when he really, truly smiled enough for the crinkles around his eyes to show.
“Of course. I do have to ask though, what exactly was your plan here?” Cas said, raising an eyebrow.
“Okay, since we didn’t hear the high pitched shrieks of those three girls, I think it’s safe to say that the coast is currently clear. Time to move.” Dean stepped out into the hall, pausing for Cas to pull their door shut behind them. At the soft click of the door, Dean moved up to the end of the hall. He pressed his back to the left side of the wall and peered around the corner towards the stairwell. Seeing and hearing no immediate signs of excitement, he waved Cas forward and headed for the stairs. Down two flights and through one more hall, they reached the front doors to the dorm.
Dean laughed at her little self satisfied wiggle before he grabbed the bandolier from beside her. Not wanting to push his luck, Dean started off towards class again.
“Hey guys, keep up. It’s gunna get hairy from here on out,” Cesar whispered from up ahead. Max and Dean jogged to catch back up with the group as they skirted the edge of the parking lot lights, finally starting to work more to the north than to the east. Again, Dean felt those eyes on his back.
“Okay, Monday morning. Here’s the plan. Cas and I leave the dorm at 7:40. We meet Benny and Charlie by the old oak behind the humanities building. Charlie and I will continue to our classes while Benny and Cas swing by Jo’s dorm to snag her on the way to the other side of campus. We all have a longer midday break so we hang back for an extra couple minutes before leaving the classroom so the zombies go after the twitchy humans. Some are sure to hang back and grab the stragglers so make sure you’ve got plenty of ammo on you when you leave. We all meet back at the oak tree and head for lunch together. Rinse and repeat. We take different paths every day. I’ll send out texts with the new paths the night before, text me if there’s any issues.”
“I’ll go if you come with,” Alicia offered. “Seems like you know what you’re doing out here.” Benny paused before nodding.
“Well, now we just need to focus on getting you through the rest of the week so we can get you on that date,” Charlie grinned and for the first time all day, Dean was feeling hopeful again.
Dean and Charlie had only just arrived at their last classes before lunch and they already had three near misses with Michael under their belts. The first involved Michael waiting outside Dean’s dorm hall that morning forcing Dean to go out the back door instead. The second was 15 minutes later when they were approaching the science building. Michael had appeared out of nowhere during their final dash to the door. It was only due to Charlie’s incredible aim that they had made it out of that one.
“Good call not wearing the skinny jeans, Cas. Gotta be hard to run in those,” Dean teased with a wink. Cas immediately rolled his eyes, clearly still too tired for Dean’s antics.
“One sec, gotta take care of this quick,” Dean said reluctantly. He kept his left arm wrapped around Cas as he glanced back at the screen.
“Cas, you gotta turn me. The dude’s obsessed, I just wanna be done,” Dean insisted, clutching at Cas’ hoodie and panting heavily. Cas looked completely taken aback and gaped at Dean for just a moment before steeling himself. Dean could almost imagine those giant black wings and glowing eyes from his dream.
Shoving his phone back into his pocket, Dean looked out the window once more, looking for either Michael or Cas and finding neither. The sun had officially set and the light was rapidly fading. Dean cursed himself for not getting out of bed five minutes earlier and headed for the door, eager to get moving. Glancing up and down the hall, he determined that the coast was clear. Dean locked the door behind him and snuck down the hall towards the stairs as quickly as he could.
Dean shoved his phone back into his pocket and descended the stairs as quickly and quietly as possible. He hoped that Cas would be thrown off by the repetition of their meetup. It was a trick that probably wouldn’t work more than twice in a row but it was a decent enough strategy that Dean had texted Charlie about the change before falling asleep the night before. Now he had to take Benny’s route into account too. He wasn’t even sure if it was worth hoping that he at least made it through today so he could have some time to think on it after classes.
“I dunno, kinda sounded like a bottle rocket,” Dean said, refusing to look at Max and carefully poking his head back around the corner. No zombies. He turned back to the group and waved them to keep going. Charlie and Alicia nodded and moved up to the next alcove to urge the rest of the group onward.
Dean continued stewing on the oddities that had come up the past couple days, confident that he wasn’t missing anything important in the lecture. Professor Adler liked to hear himself talk so he rarely called on the class but loved to assign readings at the end that basically covered everything he’d just said. Sure enough, he managed to skate through the lecture without difficulty, receiving a list of pages to be read later. Just as he was about to rush for the door, he felt his phone buzz.
“Alrighty folks, we’re in the endgame now. What’s the plan,” Ash said, rubbing his hands together. Dean had no idea how he was handling the cold without any sort of sleeves but the guy looked completely unphased.
"Well after you told me about everything the other night, I started thinking of ways that this could be dealt with without having to go through the school. After Charlie’s comment yesterday about digging up dirt on him, I realized that  was possibly the only way to deter him so I asked her to look into it because I knew you wouldn’t,” Cas explained. Dean nodded thoughtfully and came to the conclusion that Cas was right. He also probably would have kept dealing with it on his own if Michael hadn’t gotten so aggressive in the stairwell.
“You’re lying, Dean. And blushing,” Cas said softly, brushing a thumb across Dean’s cheekbone. Dean huffed a sigh and looked back up at Cas. He didn’t appear judgmental or annoyed, just curious.
“I apologize for pulling Dean away for the night, Jo. Dean and I have had a lot to talk about and I felt it would be best if we didn’t put it off,” Cas explained diplomatically. “In fact, we still have more to discuss so we will see you tomorrow.”
“Wait, Jo!” Dean called after her, pulling away from Cas’ warmth to hang out the open doorway. She turned back around and lifted an eyebrow questioningly.
Well there we have it! My first ever completed fic! 🥳 I hope you all liked it! I certainly enjoyed writing it (for the most part). I have more fics planned for the future, a couple one shots and one or two multi chapter fics, all more or less in this universe, but one thing I learned from this experience is that I’m going to write the whole thing out before posting! So I’ll see you all then!
“Whatever you say, Dean,” Cas said, waving a hand over his shoulder as he shuffled across the questionably stained, aged carpet back to his own side of the room to sip his coffee from the ‘comfort’ of his desk chair. Dean really did try not to indulge in a quick sweep over the retreating form of his roommate. It wasn’t his fault that the orange boxer briefs left very little to the imagination.
The aforementioned blue eyes popped up into view, their owner propping himself up on an elbow and resting his chin on Dean’s shoulder, an eyebrow quirked. Dean rolled onto his back and threw his arm over Cas to pull his head down to rest in the crook of Dean’s shoulder. His heart pounded at the feeling of Cas laying in his bed with him. Not that they had done much more than make out yet. They were still fully clothed for Pete’s sake.
He didn’t know why that bothered him so much. He didn’t want to get caught at all. He was supposed to be the undefeated champion of the apocalypse, not that it was even a title they gave out but still, it was a point of pride. Yesterday, he hadn’t even given a thought to the idea of being turned but now he was disappointed it wouldn’t be Cas that turned him? He supposed at least some part of him had decided that if anyone was going to turn him, it wouldn’t be so bad if it was Cas. Cas had somehow turned it into something more. Not just losing his streak. It was a challenge he was willing to lose just because it was Cas.
“She was the one who came after us yesterday on the way to lunch.” Jo continued, ignoring Benny’s comment.
“Fine! 10. Spoilsports…” Jo said, turning for the stairs. Dean started pushing the door closed once more before he remembered.
He looked toward the front of the class and noticed Professor Crowley eyeing him with impatience. Dean grabbed the stack and whispered a quick apology. He dug in his bag for his own papers, managing to find them after only a few seconds. Thankful to have not made a complete fool of himself, he passed the stack further down the row. Dean shoved his phone back into his pocket and decided to save the rest of his scheming for when he was not in the middle of class. At least not this class.
Dean kept his head on a swivel as they made the short trek to the oak tree. At one point, two guys sprinted past an opening between the two buildings to their right but whoever they were running from seemed intent on the chase so they continued on, though at a slightly more brisk pace than before.
Dean exited the classroom and immediately booked it to the left. He weaved through several groups of students who weren’t participating in the apocalypse and heard several calls to watch where he was going but he kept running for the door as quickly as he could in the limited space. If Cas hadn’t given him the all clear, he knew Michael must still be around and it was safe to assume he was already on his tail. Sure enough, just before he rounded the corner to the main doors of the building, he heard pounding footsteps behind him.
“She’s not my enemy. Actually, she’s not yours either,” Cas countered with another barely hidden smug smile.
“I’m going to take this now, Dean,” Cas stated, his eyes once more staring into the depths of Dean’s soul. Dean welcomed it. It felt like home.
“I dunno, he’s a dick and I kinda just hoped I could forget about it? The more you talk about something, the more real it is… Nothing I can’t handle on my own,” Dean mumbled, sort of surprised that he admitted that much.
“Yeah, definitely no ulterior motives there,” Dean muttered to himself, but apparently not quietly enough.
“Exactly, we also go into this with an agreement to notify the group by text as soon as possible after getting infected.” Dean said as he glanced around the group to confirm that was still the case. The other three nodded back in confirmation. “Alright, six days left until the apocalypse.”
“Jeez, Cas is fast too.... Ya know, we should have seen this coming. Cas is going to be a much better zombie than he was a human...”
“I’ll see you back at the dorm.” And he stepped back into the shadow of the building and all but disappeared. Dean sighed and turned around feeling the eyes on his back once more.
) with one of his heavier zip-up hoodies over top. Clearly he hadn’t bothered with a comb because his hair was the usual just-rolled-out-of-bed mess. Dean felt that familiar pull to run his fingers through it just to help him tame it a little but as usual, shoved his hands in his pockets and deflected.
“How d’ya think I almost caught ya las’ time. I know all the hidin’ spots, cher,” Benny grinned back with a wink. Dean rolled his eyes and huffed a laugh as Ash cleared his throat and Max wolf whistled, earning him an elbow to the gut from his sister.
Then the stillness was broken as Cas sat up to pull his shirt off and Dean was struck senseless by the stretch of bare skin above him. Cas’ hand moved to the hem of Dean’s shirt and he paused as if waiting for Dean’s approval. Dean scrambled to help, his hands bumping into Cas’ clumsily. Finally, the shirt was flung across the room and then Cas’ lips were back on Dean’s. His hands naturally moved to Cas’ waist and the content hum from Cas only encouraged him. Before Dean could even worry about things getting a little too heated, a pounding from the door broke them apart.
“It was last year. Nothing they can do about it now. I don’t have any proof anyways. I don’t want to go and whine to the professors about something that isn’t even happening anymore.
“Nah, would have been way higher pitched,” Dean observed. “Now focus up. We’re sitting ducks here, gotta get away from the building. Easy to get ambushed here.”
"Do you?" Cas asked, amusement coloring his voice, no doubt due to the blush that Dean could feel heating his cheeks.
“We’ve gotta run. See ya,” he grumbled far earlier than Charlie and Dean needed to start heading to their next classes. He walked away without a second glance at the group, including Cas.
“No. You’re done. You will leave Dean alone from now on,” Cas replied, not a hint of fear in his voice.
Dean thought he was being responsible by attempting to get some studying done before heading out to the final night game. He should have known better. He’d been so keyed up the entire day that he’d barely been able to focus in class. After getting back to the dorm, he had pulled out his notes from the last lecture and found them to be completely useless. Half formed thoughts and abstract doodles littered the pages. They now sat at the bottom of his wastebasket under his desk.
“You are playing with fire, Angel,” Dean murmured, relishing the feel of Cas’ weight over him. Cas paused, still mostly on top of Dean.
“One reason. Adam,” Cas said simply. Michael’s eyes went wide and the blood drained from his face before he regained control of his features.
“That’s my second good deed for the day,” Meg chimed in. “Don’t let it go to waste.” Dean nodded and took off running without a second thought. He had no socks, Michael would be 30 seconds behind him. His best shot was to make a break for his dorm and hope the rest of the humans got enough to consider the event a win.
“Hey, assbutt!” Cas called as he hurled a sock, hitting Michael in the side of the head. Dean was stunned.
“Why is Michael so interested in catching you?” Cas asked, to the point as always. Dean swiveled in his chair to face Cas and shrugged, looking down to absently pick at a hangnail.
Dean couldn’t help but shake his head and return the smile. Suddenly, Cas’ smile dropped and his eyes went wide. Charlie and Meg both swore as Dean turned to see Michael beelining it towards him. Dean patted his pockets and his stomach dropped when he realized he was out of socks. From the short distance, Dean could see the triumphant snarl on Michael’s face as he pushed himself that little bit faster.
“We’ve found that the buddy system works well so we’ll have to get a bit creative since we have an odd number this year,” Dean said glancing at Cas who was absentmindedly nibbling on a Twizzler while surveying the planning process with what looked like exasperated humor.
“You’re pretty quick on your feet there, Jesse” Benny said approvingly, sounding only slightly out of breath.
“No, I do. I really do. I don’t say it enough but you’re always there for me. You’ve always got my back, even when I’m being an idiot. I know you always remind me that I’m an idiot after the fact but when it matters, you’re always on my side. So thank you,” Dean said, gripping the back of his chair and staring at the worn fabric under his fingers like if he looked hard enough, he might uncover the secret to untwisting the anxious knot in his stomach. Instead, Dean’s stomach continued to twist as he idly scratched at the fabric in silence.
The line continued to shuffle forward and more people fell in behind them. Dean scanned the room once more and thought he saw a familiar shock of dark hair moving away from them but lost sight before he could confirm if it was Cas.
Cas’ questions had caught Dean off guard but when he thought about it, it kinda made sense that Cas would pick up on the tension there. Michael had never hidden his displeasure with Dean but at least they didn’t have any classes together this semester so it was only directed at him when they happened to pass on the grounds or in the halls. The occasional stink eye or shoulder check was a semi-regular occurrence. It wasn’t anything Dean couldn’t handle.
“Some kind of rivalry or something?” Max added. Dean groaned as he pulled his hand through his hair. He looked around the group seeing nothing but faces of hopeful curiosity. Of course it wouldn’t just stop with Charlie asking him about it.
But wasn’t that just the biggest joke of all time. Gabe was at least partly correct, Dean definitely had a crush on his best friend.
had to come?” His annoyance cranked up a notch as he took in the gazes of literally his entire group of friends. Some shocked (Jo, Charlie, and Alicia), some amused (Jesse, Cesar, and Meg) and some weirdly appreciative (Max and Benny). It was then that Dean remembered that he was shirtless. Cas too. Shit, Cas. Dean looked behind him apologetically and saw Cas grumpily pulling one of Dean’s blankets around his shoulders. Dean turned back around and closed the door as much as he could while still addressing the nosy group in the hall.
Dean groaned and dragged his hand through his hair, messing it up after just having tamed his bed head. His phone buzzed once more but instead of it being a lamentation from Jo or Charlie, it was from Cas.
“Ready?” Dean gave Cas a once over as they both grabbed their backpacks and ammo socks from their desks.
“Yeah, okay, fine. But I’m expecting the whole story tomorrow over breakfast. I’m not afraid to pound on your door again if you’re not up by 9 tomorrow.”
Adler was notorious for his obsession to get to lunch on time so Dean was not at all surprised by the Professor’s toe tapping as he waited for Dean to shrug on his leather jacket and re-tye the bandana around his arm.
“I’m sorry it took me until now to tell you. I didn’t realize you felt the same way and the last thing I wanted to do was ruin our friendship. But then you chose a date for your side of the bet and I realized that maybe I could have this,” Cas said, leaning in to place a single gentle kiss on Dean’s lips.
“Ya’ know, I’m not gunna argue with you on that one,” Dean said with a teasing grin as he dropped to his usual seat at the table. which Jo only rolled her eyes at before her eyes caught on something over Dean’s shoulder.
“What are you, 10? And not that it’s any of your business, but when the guy that you lo- have a crush on kisses you, you kinda prioritize that,” Dean said under his breath, silently kicking himself for his slip. Jo’s eyes widened making her look absolutely giddy. He didn’t dare glance back to see if Cas caught the admission as well but realized he probably didn’t have to since Cas was much closer than he had thought. He hadn’t heard the bed so much as rustle but goosebumps skittered up his neck and his hair stood on end as Cas slipped behind him, one arm around his shoulder and the other around his waist. The blanket Cas had commandeered was now wrapped around the both of them and Dean hadn’t realized quite how chilly the room was until he was surrounded by Cas’ warmth. Jo’s grin settled into something softer when Dean felt Cas’ chin rest on his shoulder.
“Charlie! Try to split them up! You guys take the girl, Cas and I will deal with Michael! Meet up at the dining hall!” He hoped the plan would work. Jo was slow but three versus one was better odds than she’d had in the past. Charlie threw a thumbs up over her shoulder and Dean broke off to follow Cas.
“Go, go, go!” Dean barked at Charlie who was only a second or two ahead of him. Dean looked back and saw the girl was gaining on them. Dean let out a breathless laugh as they neared the building, this was what it was all about, the thrill of the chase. Dean knew that the only hope of really getting away would be to chance a sock throw. That would give him and Charlie another 30 seconds to get away. Thankfully, last year, he and Charlie had come up with codewords for maneuvers, many of which ended up being based on Star Wars and other nerdy references, to quickly communicate in situations just like this.
“Hey Meg, umm… You got a second?” Dean asked as she turned to leave. Cas narrowed his eyes for a second before Dean gave him a reassuring wave. Apparently that was all Cas needed because he nodded with a soft smile at Dean before turning back to Meg who had caught the silent conversation between them. She raised an eyebrow at Dean in a moment of what appeared to be genuine confusion.
“I wonder, do you care more about winning the bet than maintaining your streak of remaining human?” Cas asked after a long moment. Dean scoffed but realized he hadn’t even thought of his streak in that moment. The original bet they had made last week had been focused so specifically on keeping Cas human simply because Dean was confident in his ability to protect Cas as well as himself. Obviously that had gone straight out the window when Cas was turned. Ever since then, his focus had been steadily shifting from staying human at all costs to making sure that if anyone turned him, it would be Cas. It was no surprise to Dean that even though the rules of the game had changed, the end goal still revolved around Cas.
“Fuck that,” Dean growled before diving under Michael’s arm towards the stairs. Dean was surprised that had worked but was violently jarred from that thought as he was yanked backwards. He looked back and saw that Michael had grabbed hold of the bandolier.
“Nah, you’re fine, man,” Dean said, handing Cas his mug. “To be honest, it’s kinda nice to have someone else to complain about this to for once.”
“Almost there, just a little further,” Dean whispered, as much to himself as to Charlie. Just outside of the science building, three of the saved scientists along with Ash were guarding a pile of delivered boxes, all armed with socks and ready to rescue incoming humans from their pursuers. Dean and Charlie paused as they scanned the surroundings. It looked clear from their vantage point.
“Jo jus’ likes runnin’ her mouth, you know that,” Benny drawled. “She don’t mean no harm by it, she just don’t know when to stop sometimes.”
“Now, my intel says this ain’t gunna be some walk in the park. We got a decent amount of zombos between here and the lab and more than a few hangin’ round the lab itself.” Another student wheeled over a whiteboard with a map of the campus sketched out on it, a large star drawn over the science building on the far west side of campus. Ash jumped down off of the table and uncapped a red marker that he had pulled from the pocket of the lab coat. “I believe our best bet would be to split into four groups. Should help keep them guessing. Group A will go north, Group B south, Group C will backtrack to the east before swinging back around, and Group D will hunker down here for a bit before cutting straight west to the lab. We’ll take a vote to see which group you guys want me to join and then split up and head out. Good? Good.”
“It’s safer in numbers, I barely made it through the week on my own the first year and Charlie got turned right away so we agreed that the next year, we would keep an eye out for each other since we were mostly in the same buildings for our classes anyways,” Dean explained. “Besides, it’s more fun this way.”
“I’m assuming you’ve heard about Jo already?” Dean glanced quickly behind himself, not liking having his back to the rest of campus. He was almost expecting Jo to be behind him based on Cas’ remark but that would mean that Jo would have had to book it over here as quickly as Cas did. Thinking about it, Dean was suddenly stunned by how Cas was even here. Jo’s dorm was a good 5 minute walk away and it had only been 2, maybe 3, since he got the text from her. That meant that Cas had sprinted here so he could be waiting for Dean. Cas wasn’t even breathing hard.
“Dude, ya weren’t very subtle. You kept catching ‘em right at the beginning of the day. The only way you would know the time and direction to go was if you knew the route already,” Dean explained. Cas looked down and chuckled softly.
Beside him, Charlie and Benny were discussing the plan once more and occasionally Charlie received a quick compliment by a passing person on the sock bandolier she had sewn up, an adaptation to a Moondoor spell belt, but Dean was distracted. He pulled his phone out of his pocket once more and looked over the text from Cas.
“Speaking of...” Dean muttered to himself as he picked his phone back up from where it had been dropped onto the bed beside him, steadily buzzing with incoming texts.
“Not going South?” Benny asked, not looking like he disapproved of the decision but more like he was taking everything into consideration on his own as well. Dean hesitated for a second before showing Benny and Charlie the messages from Cas.
"So… Final day, you ready?" Dean asked, sidestepping Cas’ question as he swung his legs out of bed and stretched once more. Somehow, Cas seemed to take that as an answer in itself and leaned back in his chair, a smug smile in place.
“Don’t gimme that ‘I need to study’ bullshit. You told me last week that you were ahead in all your classes. And don’t give me that ‘that was last week, Dean’ bullshit either,” Dean said, cutting off Cas with what he thought was a decent impression of his friend’s low gravel-over-silk tone. “Besides, all the professors know it’s zombie week so they go easy because everyone’s on edge so why not actually have some fun this year.”
“Michael seems to be focused specifically on Dean. He doesn’t seem too fond of me either since I stopped him from catching Dean on Monday,” Cas added unhappily.
“Oh you’re done for Winchester, just you wait!” Michael called after them as they jogged to the door of the dining hall.
“And Benny is the reason we don’t preplan our routes for the whole week ahead of time anymore,” Dean informed Cas with a wary look on his face. Cas nodded sagely.
“Wonder how that happened,” Dean murmured as he chased Cas’ lips. They lazily traded kisses before a series of buzzes reminded Dean that he still had his phone in his hand.
“We’ve run into her twice now. She came after Dean and me on our way to  the science building,” Charlie said.
“You sure you don’t wanna go to the school with this?” Benny asked. Dean shot a glance at Cas and was happy to see he wasn’t preparing to agree with Benny, though he knew Cas likely wanted to.
“Wow, are you for real? For starters, I’m going to make this abundantly clear: I’m not the one who got away, you never had me. I’ve always been-“ Dean’s eyes darted to Cas, only able to see just a hint of his profile from where he was standing. “Secondly, I really hope this Adam guy is as big of a dick as you are, because if he isn’t? God does he deserve better if he isn’t.”
“Suck it, zombie!” Charlie crowed with a triumphant jump as Dean sprinted to collect their socks. The brunette came to a stop and crossed her arms with a lopsided smirk.
“G’mornin’, sunshine. Did ya’ forget somethin’ under my bed?” Dean mumbled with a sleepy shit-eating grin, his voice gruff.
They tore down the street, sounds of feet pounding the pavement and distant screams and laughs punctuating the night. The science building was just ahead to the right and at least ten zombies were staked out, just now noticing their arrival and more than half breaking off to join the chase, probably looking for something to do. Suddenly they were outnumbered more than two to one as they veered away from the lab.
Dean sprinted on but took a quick look over his shoulder to see the extra zombies they had picked up splitting off but Michael was still persistently gaining. Now was the time to fight.
“Yeah, I mean. She helped me out twice today. But it seems like she hates my guts. It’s like whiplash, man,” Dean said looking down at his folded hands before quietly adding “Seems like she really likes you though…”
Also, just a note, I went back and added an additional paragraph to chapter 1 to help flesh out some ideas in the later chapters. For those who you like to jump back for that, it’s the second half of the paragraph that starts with “When junior year rolled around…” For those who you’ll just like a tl;dr, it basically establishes that Dean was been out and proud with his bisexuality and had been turning down dates because of how he feels about Cas.
Dean cleared his throat and opened the door to look out into the hallway of the dorm after Cas, having caught Dean’s wandering gaze, lifted a questioning eyebrow. “Yeah, you’re ready. Keep close, eyes up. Remember, I’m trusting you to keep an eye for me too.” Dean paused as a group of three girls, each with armbands marking them as human, tiptoed down the connecting hallway to his right that led to the stairs. He turned back to Cas and and settled him with what he hoped was a sufficiently serious glare. “I’ll never let you forget it if you’re the reason I get turned this year.”
Dean glanced at Cas’ phone after wiping his eyes with his free hand and saw Jo’s name and picture on the screen. Cas rejected the call and turned off his phone as well, stretching over Dean to place both of them on the corner of Dean’s desk.
“Yeah, and that corner to the left outside your dorm entrance? Meg got me there last year.” Jo was still obviously annoyed by that particular infection.
“Fine… Fine! But let’s sit down at least, okay? Don’t need any larger an audience than I already have…” he huffed, watching the stream of students entering the hall.
Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair. He knew when Cas got like this, he couldn’t be deterred.
“Fine… You win. But if you laugh, I’m kicking you outta bed,” Dean warned, focusing on finding patterns in the shitty popcorn ceiling.
“I noticed a flyer for a new beekeeping club starting in the spring and stepped out into the hall for just a second to investigate and... I was ambushed. But I did take down the details for the club.” Dean couldn’t help but to crack a smile at how sheepishly excited Cas sounded about the club. He cleared his throat and wiped the smile from his face, hoping he sounded properly chastising.
“And with the night game tonight, Dean and I are probably going to be dodging the guy the whole time…” Charlie huffed, dropping her head to the table.
Dean climbed up the stairs to his apartment and let himself in. He flopped on the couch, fiddling with his phone. Finally, he opened his text messages and typed one out to Cas.
“Let's see, Kevin’s there, Aaron, though he's a bit wiped from working late at that second job he’s got. Bess is working the register so she can sit and not strain herself. And Andrea's in to cover Sam.”
Dean's mouth went dry, and he scooped a bit of flaky crust and sweet filling onto his fork. Lifting it slowly to Cas' lips, he held his breath. Cas' eyes flicked from his own to the fork, then rather than take the mouthful, he pulled the fork from Dean's fingers and set it on his plate. While Dean was looking down in confusion, Cas moved. A hand suddenly fisted in his shirt, jerking him up out of his seat. Lips pressed against his, stealing his breath as he gasped, then a tongue flicked against his lips. Cas moaned.
Cas tugged on the plug, pulling it part of the way out of Dean's body, only to let go and let it slide back in. Dean groaned as he did it again and again, the stretch of his rim around the thicker part burning pleasantly, then the fullness as it sank back into his body.
he moaned softly, only to see Cas' pupils widen slightly. He dropped his gaze to his plate and took another bite of his cherry pie to give himself a moment.
"Want you to fuck me," Dean told him desperately, and Cas gave a guttural moan. He bore Dean down onto the bed, and kissed him again and again, until Dean's lips were tingling and he felt abraded by Cas' perpetual five o'clock shadow.
Dean’s words rang in his ears, and Cas growled at the audacity of his Omega, then heard an unfamiliar voice from across the parking lot.
As their breathing slowed, Cas nuzzled at Dean’s throat, laying gentle kisses from his collarbone up to the point of his jaw, brushing his cheek against his Omega’s. The rasp of stubble on Dean’s jaw was a pleasant counterpoint to his own week’s worth of growth, and he hummed softly in his ear as he stroked gentle fingers through his hair. Dean was purring underneath him, his fingers trailing lightly up and down Cas’ back.
”Oh, shit. Cas, angel, brace yourself. Ma, Bobby, where are you going?!” he demanded in horror as Ellen and Bobby got up.
“Hiya, Ma,” Dean grinned, leaning over to give the stern faced woman a kiss on the forehead as he hugged her with one arm, “this is Castiel Milton, my mate. And…” he glanced back at Cas with a wink, “quite possibly the father of my pup, if a heat starting and stopping within an hour means anything.”
"Can it, you two, people will think you're boning the way you carry on," Ruby told them tartly, and Dean watched as Sam's eyes flitted to the fiery brunette and a blush spread across his cheeks.
"Oh, Dean, please!" Cas moaned, his hands clutching at Dean's back, his blunt nails scraping down his spine. "Fuck me, Baby, I'm so close…"
“That was the suggestion. As for the request, I’d like some plants or flowers to decorate the shop, but I want something without a lot of fragrance.”
Dean quickly spun on the bed and crawled closer on all fours. Watching Cas for his reaction, he slowly ran the tip over his tongue around the head, catching the pearling droplets and sucking them down. Cas's hands found his hair and brushed it back from his forehead, petting him until a well-placed flick of his tongue made him gasp. Pulling Dean upright to meet his lips, Cas kissed him breathless.
“Later!” Cas growled, then invaded his mouth again, drawing a whimper and a gush of slick from him. Dean could tell the moment the scent reached Cas’ nostrils; he froze for a moment, then groaned before tearing his own shirt from his body and reaching for the hem of Dean’s. Dean's hands were just as busy at Cas’ belt, quickly undoing his fly and slipping his hand inside to find his lover already hard.
Cas leaned over him, letting him feel his cock against his ass, the two handprints standing out. He flicked his tongue over Dean’s earlobe, then murmured softly. “Good boy.”
“Cas, c'mere and meet my cousin, Ash!” Dean called when Cas was halfway to the table. Ash turned and Cas cocked his head to one side.
Cas spent the next ten minutes going through Dean's mixtape collection. When finally Dean reappeared, he looked harried and sheepish. He slid into the driver's seat and sat for a moment, catching his breath.
He yelped as Cas startled, tugging on the knot slightly, then his Alpha was sniffing at his neck and Dean knew what he was trying to convey.
“Alicia and I are both much better aims than runners. Trust me on that one,” Max said, shaking his head at some unshared thought or memory.
"I believe so, yes. Thanks to Charlie, I think I have everything I need to deal with Michael, too” Cas said thoughtfully. Dean raised an eyebrow and stood to prep the coffeemaker for two cups instead of just the one for the first time since Monday.
"How the hell did you come up with that?" Dean asked, laughing at the ridiculousness of what just happened.
After another minute or two, they spotted Benny and Charlie with their backs to the large oak tree keeping an eye out on either side.
“Oh shit!” Charlie squeaked just as Dean was about to voice his concerns and he felt a quick tap at his back further signifying trouble. Dean spun around and saw a chain of sprinting students.
The harsh buzz of Dean’s alarm jolted him awake and he immediately flung out a hand from under the warm blankets to silence it. Dean rubbed the sleep from his eyes and lifted his head to look over at Cas’ side of the room. He was already gone. Cas’ bed was made and his backpack wasn’t sitting in it’s spot by his desk.
“Yeah, I know. I’m fine,” Dean said. Plastering on his best cocky grin he looked over at Charlie. “Besides, it’s not like he’s my boyfriend. He can have lunch with whoever he wants.”
Dean’s breath hitched and panic curled tight in his chest. Before he could embarrass himself in front of the entire campus by having a very public panic attack, a familiar, completely unwanted voice came from behind him.
“You were seriously jealous of Meg?” Cas asked breathlessly. Dean’s head spun from the knowledge that he’d made Cas sound like that. Unable to form a coherent sentence, Dean merely nodded and attempted once more to get Cas’ lips back on his own. Two warm, gentle hands framed his face and stilled him long enough for Cas to catch his eyes.
Sam hunched over him, his long torso allowing him to easily reach Gabe's throat, and he sucked a dark bruise over Gabe's scent gland. His free hand palmed Gabe's cheek to turn his face, Sam's lips landing hungrily on his. Sam shifted his hips, and began a long, deep roll, and Gabe whined against his lips, unable to do much more than take it as his Alpha claimed him, asserting his dominance.
Cas seemed to realise the same, and he stepped back, his shoulders slumping a little. "I should get back," he mumbled, and before Dean could say another word, he turned and disappeared out the door, jogging across the street.
“That’s right, you have a sister, too?” Dean asked, cuddling back into his Alpha’s chest. “Anna doesn't sound like an angel name, though James doesn't either, now that I think about it.”
“Holy shit. Is this for real?” He linked his clawed fingers with Gabe's, and Gabe's wolf gave a happy little huff, basking in the warmth of mate.
"Leave some room for Jesus, guys!" Gabriel cat-called as he spun past with a lovely, slim, dark beauty.
Cas sprang to his feet and helped Dean up, glaring down at his brother, who seemed completely unfazed by Cas' irritation.
He toweled himself dry and used a second on his hair before tossing both into the laundry room to join the sheets he’d stripped from their bed that afternoon. He climbed the stairs, the air conditioning chill on his still damp skin, and checked that the coffee maker was ready for the next morning. Dean hadn’t set it, and Cas paused, wondering. What time did Dean work tomorrow? He himself worked from two in the afternoon until ten, and he hoped their schedules would line up well enough. He realized suddenly he hadn’t checked with Gabe that Thursday wasn’t going to be a problem for him to miss. He grabbed his phone and fired his brother a message, then set it to silent. The morning would be soon enough for any replies. He crept into their room, and found his mate wrapped around his pillow, but with a grey bundle in his arms. He smiled softly, recognizing his shirt from the previous day. He’d have to make sure to leave Dean a few items of his clothing any time their shifts were horribly misaligned like this. As he carefully slid into bed, his hand encountered a silken bundle. Seeing it was a silk scarf, he grabbed it and moved to the bathroom, closing the door and turning on the light. Loosening the knot Dean had made in the black silk, he inspected the contents and felt his resolve to let Dean sleep waver as blood rushed south.
And to all the people who have supported me while my mental health has sent me spiralling, I wouldn't be here without you.
Cas sat up with him, his cock slapping against his stomach. Reaching for Dean's belt, Cas undid it frantically and began on his fly. Dean groaned as the zipper finally released his cock, his head rolling back in relief.
“More like an exit I can take you through, but first…” He finally spotted Sammy at the end of the bar, chatting with a short blond bartender. “Give me a minute, Cas?”
Cas started laughing in earnest, and reached with gentle fingers to undo the blindfold over Dean’s eyes. He peppered kisses along Dean’s jaw even as he laughed, nuzzling at his earlobe, and Dean felt a zing of pleasure travel down his spine. He melted into the mattress, and just let his Alpha tend to him, stroking his hair and laying gentle kisses against his skin.
"Yeah, let's go…" he growled, pulling Dean in for a quick hard kiss as Dean started Baby's engine. Pulling out of the lot, Dean headed for Cas' house, only to moan suddenly as Cas' hand slipped up his thigh to stroke him over his slacks. In moments, Cas' clever fingers had unzipped his fly and reached into his panties, pulled out his cock, then Cas started to bend over. Before he could reach his goal his movement was arrested by the corset vest and he stripped it hurriedly. Dean was about to ask what he was up to when suddenly Cas turned in his seat and bent, dropping his lips to Dean's cock and flicking his tongue over the tip.
"You're only wishing she offers to do that for you. Fine, get outta here, bitch. Baby's a lady, treat her right!" Dean ordered as Sam rolled out of the garage, then turned with a smirk. He sauntered through the bunker to the kitchen and cracked open a beer, taking a swig, and pulled a second from the fridge.
"Oh, fuck, Cas, feels so good!" Dean cried out, trembling and desperate, his thighs clenching around Cas' head. Cas hummed in reply and Dean whined, riding out wave after wave of pleasure as he felt his orgasm approaching. Again, Cas stopped shy of tipping him over the edge.
The music changed and Dean found Cas before him, a challenging, domineering look on his face, and Dean capitulated in a heartbeat. Enfolding his lover in his arms, they swayed together to the beat and lost themselves to the rest of the world for a while. They drifted close and closer, until they were pressed tightly against one another.
The giant black wolf with the intense blue eyes stared at him, and Dean whined at him, pleading. Cas, because it was still Cas, stalked forward and nuzzled at him, his tongue curling around Dean’s muzzle instinctively. The Omega submitted again to the Alpha.
Cas growled at the audacity of the two Omegas, and Dean bared his throat, even as the scent of slick flooded Cas’ nostrils. Cas licked over Dean’s scent gland, then leaned close to whisper huskily in his ear.
Cas tugged Dean's worn, faded Led Zeppelin shirt over his head, his hands warm and gentle as they caressed over his sides. Impatient, Dean shoved Cas' dress shirt up as well, and Cas raised his arms to pull it over his head. Their shirts hit the floor softly, and they collided again, mouths busy mapping the new skin revealed. Dean spotted a small mole on Cas' chest and laid gentle kisses down from his shoulder to the dusky nipple. Cas cupped his head closer and groaned, his voice breathy as he urged Dean on.
"This is what you want, Dean?" Cas muttered against his ear, rolling his hips and driving into him hard and fast. "So beautiful, so wanton, my Righteous Man, so desperate for my touch. Should I immortalise this moment? My beautiful lover begging for my touch?"
"Don't call it that, babe, please!" he giggled, not that he'd admit to giggling in his life. Dean glanced over his shoulder at his lover and watched as Cas huffed in response. "I want you to fuck me, want that cock pushing into me, want you to give it to me, come on, Cas, don't make me wait anymore!"
Cas dropped a kiss on the top of his head gently and stroked his fingers through Dean's hair. “Thank you, and by all means, ogle away. But I get to do the same,” Cas murmured against his ear, and Dean shivered lightly at the promise in his mate's voice.
“He… he stayed through your abuse, but finally left her when she disowned the three of you?” Dean closed his eyes as he asked, his heart hurting for his Alpha. He knew his scent had gone musty with sadness and anger, and felt Cas wrap his arms around him. He leaned into his Alpha, burying his nose against his scent gland, seeking comfort and comforting in return. When they parted, Cas pulled open the door and carefully placed the folded blanket on the driver's seat, then turned to kiss Dean gently.
Cas groaned, "I'm so close!" His hips were slapping into Dean's ass sharply, the smack of skin against skin stuttering as he began to lose his rhythm. One of his hands reached back out of Dean's sight behind his own ass, and Cas stiffened suddenly, his jaw dropping in a silent scream. Dean felt the rush of heat as Cas emptied his load into him, then Cas was collapsing, nearly crushing him before catching himself at the last moment. "Dean…"
"About time, jerk!" Sam bellowed, and Dean had to laugh, though he wasn't sure if the moose meant that they'd finally rejoined the party, or that they'd pulled their heads out of their collective asses and gotten together.
There was a sound like a thunderclap, then Dean felt the brush of feathers along his sides, curling underneath him to play over his thighs and caressing his leaking cock. He whined deep in his throat at the feel of the glorious ebony feathers tracing over his skin, nearly delirious with pleasure at their touch.
“Honestly,” Dean admitted with a shrug, “most of them, no. We deal primarily in cut flowers rather than living plants. But I’ve got a contact at a local shop, or you can probably find most of these on Amazon.”
Dean grinned. "Back when you used words like fornicate in the middle of sex? What can I say, it was adorably hot."
“Sure, why not? We’re just business owners who’ve worked a single day after three days off thanks to our mating, oh, and won’t be in tomorrow either because of appointments. Speaking of which, when is your appointment with the midwife?”
Dean bucked hard, but Cas had anticipated it and simply rode him back down to the mattress. He clamped his hands down on Dean's hips, pinning him in place. Dean gasped his name, murmuring pleas as he hid his face behind one arm thrown over his eyes.
He got to Baby and unlocked the driver’s door. He whimpered, slicking instantly as the scents his Alpha had left shortly before nearly overwhelmed him. He started her engine, letting it idle for a few minutes as he laid his head back and replayed the last hour and a half in his mind. As his jeans started to grow uncomfortable, he sat up and rolled down the window, shaking his head a little. He pulled out of the lot and headed home.
Gabe moaned against his throat and shifted from his knees to sitting in Sam's lap, wrapping his legs around his waist.
Sam and Dean are introduced to Anna, the youngest Milton sibling, over the phone, and her brothers let her know some of the things they've learnt in the past few days. Cas tells of his childhood trauma at Naomi and her brothers hands.
Jo gagged and he whipped his head around to face her. “Shut up. I've had to watch you and Charlie since
Gabe turned to face his mate, and the tenderness in his eyes caught him off guard. He reached a hand to Sam's cheek, and ran his thumb lightly down his jaw. Sam leaned into his touch, and Gabe leaned down to kiss him slowly, the urgency of his heat banked under the desire to care for his Alpha. Their lips met in a gentle touch, a slow brush against each other. They parted a moment, and Gabe rested his forehead against Sam's.
“And yet, she's calling, rather than texting,” Jo remarked, with a gleeful look. “I'd answer that, her Majesty is not patient.”
he thought to himself with a smile. He sang along with his music, and wondered idly about the drawer he was supposed to check when he got there. He pulled into the driveway and cursed, realizing he’d forgotten to get the code for the garage amid all the distractions.
Dean dropped the lube on the bed and dove for his lover, kissing him passionately. Cas opened for him, tangling their tongues as their bodies began to move together. Dean grabbed the lube and coated several fingers, then reached down to tease over Cas' hole. What he was not expecting to find was the wide base of a plug.
Still leaning against the side of the booth, waiting for the boys’ first bites, Jo grinned at Cas' antics. She shook her head, still smiling, and asked where they'd met.
"Are you alright, Dean?" Cas asked softly, and Dean glanced up, only to be lost in an ocean of blue. Cas was close, leaning over the counter a little in his concern, and Dean was desperate suddenly to taste those lips. His eyes dropped to Cas' mouth, and he found himself leaning slowly closer.
Cas slid into the passenger seat as Dean slipped behind the wheel. Dean glanced over and met his eyes, his breath catching as Cas' gaze dropped to his lips.
Jo shrieked, turning heads all through the restaurant. She launched herself at Dean, who caught her and gave her a hug, laughing all the while. Ellen gave a smile and slung an arm around Bobby's shoulders, leaning her head against his.
Gabe found himself melting against the Alpha, which was interesting considering he was still balls deep in Gabe at that moment.  They reached their room, and Sam simply stepped onto the bed, and walked to the head of the bed, where he turned and carefully lowered them until his back was against the headboard.
A moment later, Cas tensed and his body clenched around Dean's cock, and there was a sudden spurt of wetness between them. A surprised sound escaped Cas, and Dean felt a smug smile stretching his lips.
Sam snorted, shaking his head, his eyes dancing with amusement. “I can at least sit at my desk and do paperwork. You, however, would have trouble serving drinks. Let me call the Roadhouse and see what kind of pie Ellen has on the menu today.”
“Hey now, that car has gotten me through a lot of rough times. And considering your car is a decade older--”
Charlie jumped up and ran to check out the spaces, barging into the office without a care. Dean simply rolled his eyes and shouted after her, “Look at the shower while you're in there! And take measurements of the master, wouldja?”
Cas gave a low, husky laugh that went straight to Dean's groin and had his cock throbbing, his slick hole clenching. The Alpha moved close enough to whisper in his ear, his breath hot against Dean's skin, “B-b-baby, you ain't seen n-nothin’ yet.”
"Try the key lime, Dean, I insist." Dean froze like a deer in the headlights, and unable to resist those cerulean eyes, leaned forward to accept the mouthful. The sweet-tart flavour burst across his tongue.
Cas was human again. Needing to eat was certainly an inconvenience for the former angel, but it provided Dean with a unique opportunity. He dragged Cas to his favourite diner, about an hour from the bunker, and ordered for them both.
"No," Cas replied, ducking his head to meet Dean in another demanding kiss, completely dissolving his resistance.
Cas' fingers were warm and gentle as they cupped his chin, forcing his head up to make eye contact. "I know, Dean." He gave a soft, tender smile, full of understanding. "I love you, too."
"Fuck, Dean," Cas breathed against his throat, then his hand snuck under Dean's jacket and shirts to curl into his back, blunt nails scoring his skin.
Sam was busily scribbling a note, which when Gabe wandered over to read, said that Sam didn't need to know that. Glancing in the open drawer, he spotted nothing but panties, all in men’s size. He burst out laughing and stole the note from Sam, scrawling a quick “
“Dean, no, baby. It was a misunderstanding. For future reference, you have blanket permission to wake me up with a blow job, Omega-mine,” Cas told him, cupping his chin and forcing Dean to meet his eyes. “As for restraints, for those, let’s make sure everyone is awake when we start tying each other, or ourselves up, huh?” Dean’s defensive posture had softened, but his shoulders were still tense, and his scent was still far from normal. Cas took Dean’s hand, and gave him a gentle tug. “Love, can I hold you?”
Sam called his name and tossed the keys back. "I've… ah, I've got a ride." Next to him, Ruby smirked.
Cas' hand wrapped around his cock then, stroking him quickly as he ground against Dean slowly, and Dean shouted his pleasure to the room as he came a second time.
Cas rolled them then, and slung one of Dean's legs over his shoulder. He sank deep into Dean's body, grinding his hips in a figure eight then withdrawing until only the head caught on Dean's rim. He started a quick, shallow thrust, and Dean shouted in ecstasy as Cas found his prostate. He locked his hands on Dean's narrow hips, pounding into him again and again, until the room was filled with their cries and the scent of sex.
Dean was whining high in his throat by this point, desperate to come again, and he wrapped a hand around his cock, stripping it quickly in time with Cas' thrusts.
“Eat, Gabe,” Sam instructed gruffly, caressing his hands down Gabe's sides. Gabe whined at him, trying to shift his hips, but Sam clamped his large hands around his waist, and held him still. “Eat first.”
Locking his hands on Cas' hips, Dean began a slowly rolling thrust, pulling gasps and mewls from his lover as he drove over his prostate again and again.
Sam gave a low chuckle, and again lifted Gabe effortlessly. Gabe had never considered being manhandled one of his kinks. Most Alphas and Betas were larger than him, so they just wanted to rub in their strength.
He rolled Cas onto his back, bending to kiss him fervently, a quiet moan escaping him as their chests brushed. Cas was like a furnace, his skin flushed and hot to the touch, and Dean pressed closer, revelling in his warmth. He kissed his way down Cas' torso, slowly worshipping every inch of skin until he reached those tantalizing hip bones. He brushed over them with his thumbs, watching as Cas squirmed under his touch.
” Cas grunted as he thrust, praise falling from his lips for him. “My good Omega, my mate, you feel so good.”
“Damnit, Gabe, you're driving me crazy,” Sam breathed. “Um, yeah… it's called the Roadhouse. Call Anna and order then.” And Sam heaved himself to his feet, his knot tugging slightly at Gabe's rim, making him whimper at the sharp pleasure flooding his senses again. Gabe clenched unconsciously, and Sam nearly stumbled, groaning softly. “
Cas grumbled against his lips, but let his hand be removed. Dean smiled and kissed Cas softly for a moment, then reached down to caress his hip. Cas's legs parted at his touch, and Dean settled between them, groaning softly.
I'm going to make love to you." Before Dean could think of a response to that declaration, one of Cas' hands slipped down between them and he rubbed a dry finger in a slow, gentle circle over Dean's hole.
Dean had little recollection of leaving the diner, simply dropped a few twenties on the table without asking for the cheque, and was dragged out by Cas. More long, slow kisses against Baby's side, Cas capturing his lips and staking claim to his mouth.
Dean growled deep in his chest, tossed one of Cas' legs over his shoulder, and held onto his thigh, pounding into his lover hard and fast. The heavy slap of skin against skin echoed through the room with their cries, which climbed higher and louder the closer they each got. Cas spilled over first, his body seizing around Dean's cock with a soundless cry. Dean held on for a few strokes more, but then Cas bit at his throat, and the zing of pleasure-pain rocketed him over the edge. He came with a great groan, surrounded by Cas' heat, firing deep into his lover's body.
“Food, then nest,” Sam ordered, carrying him to the dining room along with the bag of food. Sam dropped the basketball shorts he'd slid into before heading down to answer the door, then dropped into a chair, holding Gabe in his lap, and set his food before them. Popping the top off the takeout container, he fed Gabe a fry, still hot despite the delivery time. When Gabe reached for a fry for himself, Sam grumbled, but pulled his own food from the bag. When Gabe moaned around his first mouthful of the burger, Sam ground up against him, his cock heavy and full against Gabe's cleft. Gabe squirmed, whining as his heat ran through his blood in a burning wave, and Sam took pity on him.
“Nah, I told you about our mom dying when I was four, right? And Ellen kinda--Oh, hey Ash, Sam here. Can I get an order for pickup? Dean'll be there in thirty to get it. Uh huh. Nah, I'll have a bacon cheese today too, need some energy. Yeah, side salad though. Oh, and what kinda pie you got, any sugar pie? Uh huh. Yeah. One sec.” He turned to Gabe, his expression like a puppy seeking approval. “No sugar pie, babe, but they have pecan, and it's Dean's favourite, other than Ellen's apple pie.”
Cas had had enough teasing, apparently, and with sharp claws digging into his hips to hold him still, Cas slammed home, then withdrew and set a punishing pace. Dean cried out, and found himself driven up the bed until he was able to wrap his hands tightly around the bed rails, and he pulled himself forward, forcing Cas to follow closely. He was mostly upright, leaning back into his Alpha’s thrusts, even as he was driven against the headboard. Cas slipped one hand from his hip to his hair, tugging sharply to expose his throat, and Dean let out a broken whimper at the sting of pain, even as Cas licked up the taut muscle over the side of his neck, and back over the mating mark on his neck. Cas latched onto his throat, sucking a dark bruise over his pulse, and his other hand slid from Dean’s hip to close around his cock, stroking him in time to his thrusts. Dean whined at the sudden touch on his cock, which had been neglected since they began, barring the bit of rutting against the sheets he’d done before Cas had moved him. The sudden feel of his mate’s hand, slick with precome, tight over the head, had him letting out breathy moans, each higher than the last as the heat coiling in his gut threatened to overwhelm him.
“Yup,” Cas confirmed, picking up the thread of the story as Dean took another bite of his burger. “We'd been desperate for proof to kick that asshole out. But we're relatively new in town. Can't ban someone like that without reason.”
“Absolutely. Now, I'm going to take you upstairs to our nest, and I want you to ride me, just like this.”
Here we are folks, one chapter to go after this! Thank you so much for coming along on this two year journey with me, for all your love, support, and kind words as I've gone through some horrible times. You truly kept me going.
"You praying, angel? Not sure I like the idea of those bastards seeing you like this," he teased before slowly pressing a spit-slick finger against his hole, then letting out a low growl of approval as it sank into Cas' body. He teased his finger in and out slowly, then when Cas looked down at him with those wild blue eyes again, crooked his finger, unerringly pressing against Cas' prostate.
"You want me to kiss your pride?" Cas confirmed with a teasing, gummy grin. "Isn't that parked in the driveway?"
Cas' eyes held his for a long moment, then flicked down to his lips as he spoke. Dean tried not to read into it, but his throat was suddenly parched. He grabbed his beer and took a long swallow, averting his gaze from the former angel.
“You're my Alpha, and my True Mate. You would never really hurt me,” Gabe sighed happily, nuzzling at his neck. “But you need to trim your nails, Samsquatch. How long until Cassie is here? Hmm, good thing Dean has a key, I don't think ten minutes will be enough for your knot to go down.”
"Get a room!" Sammy shouted from across the basement, and Cas broke into a low chuckle, his eyes luminous as he stared at Dean from mere inches away. Dean hauled Cas, unprotesting, to his feet and fumbled in his pocket for his keys.
Dean blinked, then chuckled. “Yeah, no kidding. Look, I love the idea about the chocolate spider and pumpkins and that, so send over an invoice for the chocolates you already brought. I’ll cut you a cheque, and we can set up an ongoing order. Even with Halloween about to pass, something like chocolate leaves on sticks would go nicely in the bouquets anyway.”
"So…" she drawled, "trouble in paradise?" She gave him a meaningful look, and Dean winced. He'd had Lisa leave him for someone else, and though they hadn't been mated, it had hurt. He wouldn't do that to someone else. Resolving to keep his interactions with Cas professional, he shrugged.
“How did I sleep through that?” Dean demanded and watched as Cas lowered his eyes, his cheeks going rosy with a blush.
Dean knew he was being played. He'd watched the transformation from teasing mate to seeing his Alpha looking like his heart had been torn out. He dropped his burger onto his plate and pointed a finger at Cas accusingly.
He thought back to the scenario to which he’d woken, and whined slightly as he found himself become aroused. He’d always thought he’d enjoy being tied up, but apparently his wolf wasn’t as enthused. Or at least didn’t like waking up that way. They needed to set some ground rules for how to proceed with the toys, so there were no further misunderstandings. He
A growl escaped Dean and he tamped it down. “No one is touching our pups,” he said firmly. “Anyone even tries to hurt them, or you, and I'll kill them.”
My depression reared its head and left me numb and unable to write for two months, so while I had a buffer of chapters, I couldn't even summon the energy to post. So thank you for waiting for me.
“Oh fuck, Dean…” Dean popped up his hips and wiggled his ass for good measure, then felt Cas pull the panties to one side again and teased his cock over his hole.
“Named for the angel of Thursday,” Cas responded to the unspoken question. “My parents named all of us for angels.”
“P-please Alpha, Cas, angel!” Dean fought to be able to thrust back, but he had no leverage. Finally he found purchase with his toes, and pushed himself up the bed just enough to pop up his hips. The next roll of Cas’ hips caught Dean's breath, pulling a whine from him, the slight tingle in his pelvis growing to a buzz as Cas ground against his prostate. Suddenly Cas was withdrawing from his body and Dean whined at the empty feeling. His mate's strong hands were on his hips, pulling him upright to his knees, then nudging them apart. Dean felt deliciously open and exposed, his hearing sharpened with the blindfold shutting out his sight. His sense of smell was nearly overpowering, the musk of his Alpha’s arousal combined with his own a heady cocktail, and he whined, desperate for his mate to join with him again, his hole clenching on nothing as he waited.
Chapter warning for chapter 9. Underage pregnancy by implied rape.  No details given, but a warning that we've got some angst and a rough go coming.
"You're so beautiful like this Dean, skin all pink, sweating and shaking for me." Cas' voice was a low, husky whisper, and he groaned as Dean's body tightened around his finger. "Next time I'm gonna finger you 'til you come, but fuck, I need to be in you."
Dean shouted profanities as he climbed to the edge, hovering above a steep precipice, dangling on a hair between agony and ecstasy as his body was used and worshipped by the man fucking him senseless. “Cas, Cas!
“Sure, Gabriel. We'll be along in about… hmm. Dean, how long will it take to get from here to a store, to the Roadhouse, then Sam’s to drop some lunch for Sam and Gabe. Sam's calling in the order so we won't have to wait.”
“I've seen you, but I don't know where. You had blockers on…” Cas examined the man in puzzlement, then snapped his fingers. “Dr. Bad-Ass Security Systems, right? Love the work you did at Milton's. Even the threat of the cameras you installed helped me ban a major problem assbutt last night.”
"I'm thinking about it," Cas growled. His fingers toyed with the waist of Dean's panties, and his eyes roved over him, trailing upward from his panties to his face, until their eyes locked. Dean had to suppress a burst of laughter and couldn't contain his smile. How he'd ever believed that look to be platonic was beyond him. Pulling Cas up and into his arms, he kissed him slowly, letting their bodies settle into a gentle rhythm as they rocked against one another. Eventually, their kisses grew more passionate, and Cas pulled back to straddle Dean's legs. He stared down at the panties hungrily, then flicked his eyes back up to meet Dean's gaze.
“Considering you may have a physical tomorrow, do you really want to stay in bed, having me fill you with my come over and over, and spanking your ass until you can’t sit without squirming?” Cas breathed against his ear, and Dean whimpered. “Do you really want to face Missouri like that?” This time when Dean shuddered it wasn’t a happy one.
“That’s it, come on, baby, come for me,” Cas ordered, grinding against his prostate and sending Dean screaming over the edge. His legs slipped from around Cas’ waist as he shuddered, his heart thudding explosively in his chest, his entire being centred on where they were joined. “Oh, fuck, Dean!”
Gabe grinned, and winked at Sam, who blushed a little at the blond's flirting. “Welcome to Milton's, co-owned by myself and my three slacker brothers.”
that's how I knew. You changed the appointment for tomorrow from C. Milton to My Alpha, and tagged the address as ‘home’. You even made a memo on the appointment to talk to me about giving him a family discount.”
Dean set his teeth to the tendon on Cas' neck lightly and Cas shouted his name, bucking underneath him. There was a sudden wetness between their bellies as precome spurted from Cas' dick and Dean chuckled devilishly.
“You’re one to talk, you clawed up my arm when you bit me. Anyway, Dean'll need to pack a bag too, since I'm kicking him out for the duration of your heat. I don't want anyone in and out while you're in heat.”
“Samalam, I'm gonna go jump into the shower. Join me when you're off the phone?” he said loudly as he hopped off the counter, swinging his hips as he sauntered out of the kitchen towards the stairs.
Cas pulled out so quickly he left Dean breathless and his face as Dean glanced over his shoulder was devastated. “Dean, I’m so sorry, I got so caught up I forgot and I--”
Dean ignored the “awwws” and rolled eyes from Jo and Charlie, focusing instead on the way Cas' lips wrapped around the tines of the fork. But even Cas’ reaction to the burgers hadn't prepared Dean for the low moan he let out upon tasting the pie. Dean felt his pulse skyrocket and a tiny trickle of slick escaped him.
"Doesn't mean it's not a good line." Dean wormed his way lower and reached for Cas' slacks, undoing the button slowly, and drawing down the zipper. He glanced up to watch Cas' reaction and was nearly overwhelmed by the look of lustful adoration. "I got you, angel."
A moment later, Cas' hand wrapped around his cock for the first time, and Dean shuddered, his eyes closing in bliss. The angle was awkward, it was too dry, and Cas was clearly unsure.
Heya, wasn't going to post until Saturday, but honestly, I'm having a shit day and thought it might cheer me up to post early. If nothing else, I hope I can put a smile on others' faces. 💖
Drawing down the boxer-briefs, Dean licked his lips, then flicked his tongue over the tip of Cas' cock, tasting the salty musk and moaning softly. Cas gasped at his touch, his cock jumping and leaking another droplet of precome.
"Did you just take my picture?" Dean asked, his voice low and raspy from the abuse his throat had taken. He gave a cocky grin, knowing what he must look like.
