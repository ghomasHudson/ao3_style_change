Sherlock was holding Rosie’s hands and he watched John rush to the kitchen with a puzzled look. “I’d like a cup.” John nodded and started to look in cupboards for two cups, he hoped Sherlock wasn’t still staring at him, God he was an idiot. It was only one word, but he let it slip and now Sherlock thinks he’s an idiot. He let out a sigh of relief when he heard Sherlock laughing over Rosie’s mumbling. It made John’s heart sing when he heard her so happy. What he hadn’t expected to hear was Sherlock’s voice singing gently to the baby.
It was then that John realized that he missed Sherlock so much. The house felt different without him, even when Mary was still alive. There just wasn’t that banter that he was so accustomed to with Sherlock. The thought left him smiling into his food for the rest of the film. John took care of the food as Sherlock put Rosie to bed. She had fallen asleep halfway into the marathon, but the two were so comfortable laying on each other that they didn’t move until after the third movie. John stood in the doorway of his daughter’s room and watched as Sherlock gently set her down in her crib and rubbed her back when she stirred. Thankfully, she stayed asleep and John could let the breath out that he was holding.
“He missed you, you know. There were some nights where I found him staring at your chair and a few mornings where I found him sleeping in it.”
John stared for a little while longer before storming around the statues and marching down the hall. When he saw that the others weren't following him, he spun on his heel and tried to speak to them as calmly as he could, which was barely.
“They came to me. They found me, the time energy that my adventure of curiosity, made its way to their senses, and drove them to me.”
He squeezed Sherlock's hand. The Doctor's tone lightened up and his body shook with hushed laughter. He clapped a hand on John's shoulder.
"It's my fault, I've done it to myself. The first thing I've thought when I held up the glass was, 'Sherlock wouldn't like this. He hates it when I drink.' But then..."
He returned to his empty house and just looked around, cane in his hand, hair grey and face covered in wrinkles from living a hard and stressful life. He was alone again. He rested his cane to the side and then started playing with the dirty, wedding band he was wearing. He never took it off. Mary removed hers after they came back from the hospital with no baby in their arms. She proceeded to blame him for the rest of their time together. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. All he saw was dark curls, and light blue eyes staring at him with the welcomed tone of Sherlock’s voice speaking to him in his mind.
That's the closest he would get. She accepted it, and he was grateful. Kylie let go of her father and then scurried off into her room, shutting the door after she entered. John was on his knees in the middle of the kitchen, staring down the hall. He had to keep trying, for her. He got up and made his way over to the collection of the various alcohol bottles he bought while Kylie was at school. His choice for today was going to be Jack Daniels, that's the one that everyone picks, it's the bottle that depressed, lonely sods like John drink. He had to be quick with this glass, Kylie was awake now and the last thing he needed to explain was why he needed a drink before dinner. There, he managed to pour himself a glass without so much as a noise coming from Kylie's room. He had to go without ice this time, but that was alright, he welcomed the familiar burn down his throat. He wasn't so fond of the other burn, the one where he had to swallow his tears every time he looked at the empty side of his double bed. Those were the nights where he had to sleep with Kylie.
He waltzed into the flat, as Mrs. Hudson let him in. His eyes scanned the flat before they landed on you. I don't know how to describe it, Sherlock. When he saw you laying there, your head resting on the pillow, your face ruddy and pale, your tired eyes, his face was unreadable. He stared at you for a long time before either of you said anything to each other. I sat there in my chair with Kylie in my lap. I should have got up and went into the room, but I didn't move. I wanted to see how this went, and no, not because I got my rocks off, but because I needed to be there in case Mycroft was being a bit too pushy.
“I should have known that even the Teletubbies would not hold your attention forever.” He smirked at the idea of finally being able to miss an episode of the terrifying show.
You kept going back for your chemotherapy, and each time you would come back tired and weak. They didn't even give you the stronger drugs yet, and you could barely handle the medicine they were giving you already. For a few weeks, the only side effect of your therapy sessions was that you fell asleep by the time we got back home. I thought to myself, 'I can handle that...that isn't so bad.'
“I know Sherlock; I know you want nothing more than to be out there with me, I’ll come back for you I promise. I just need a better understanding of what’s going on.”
I was at work when they called me, and because I missed so many days trying to boost the positivity in our home, I couldn’t afford to walk out early. I told them that I was busy at the moment, but as soon as I was able to, you and I would take a trip to the building to meet the mother of our child. I wish you’d kept your phone on.
I smiled and then moved in to kiss you. It was heaven. When we pulled away I slid my hand from your cheek and made my way to your stomach and placed my hand on it.
‘John. What is it? Why are you grinning like the Cheshire cat?’ You said to me whilst sitting on your beloved armchair, fiddling with your violin as usual. You were puzzled by my facial expression, lately, that was starting to become normal.
Sherlock smiled even though John wouldn’t be able to see it clearly, and returned to his original position, falling asleep faster than he ever had in his life.
“Ah, it appears little Rosie was worn down by our playing. She’s making excellent progress with her…”
The day before you started chemotherapy, I remember we had two visitors that same day. Mycroft and Lestrade. They weren't back-to-back mind you, but it was rare that we had that many visitors in one day. Mycroft came first. You were well enough to move around on your own...on good days that was...you managed to relocate to the couch and you laid there and watched telly with me. You were uncharacteristically quiet. Not a single insult was hurled towards the show.
Sherlock was frozen, his eyes were fixed on the Doctor. What was he doing here? Why did he wait till now to come back?
“No, shut up Sherlock, I won’t let you go out there alone. Not when there’s more of those Weeping Angels stalking about.”
“John.” His tone was firm and John wondered if he ruined the night for them. He watched as Sherlock rose from his seat, grabbed the bottle, and with the softest face he could muster said, “Let’s have a bath. We’ll finish the bottle in there.”
“Sherlock. Shut up. I love you and I want to make you feel as good as you did for me. Will you let me?”
Ella. Maybe Ella can shed some light on the situation. Will he tell her the whole truth, the half-truth, or not even tell her at all? Will he dance circles around her, and refuse to let her help him only to blame her for his issues later on? John sighed. He could argue with himself for days, but then he would still go, and nothing would change. The gun was looking more appealing to him by the minute. He could leave Kylie in the custody of Mrs. Hudson, or Mycroft, wherever he may be now. "Daddy was just sad, Kylie. He was so sad that he couldn't handle living anymore, so he killed himself." That's probably what they would say to her. She would just sit in the chair, or stand up, and stare at them wide-eyed as they explained it to her. She would know better, she would know that her father was being selfish, that he couldn't move on from his husband's death. "Now sweetie, he didn't do it to anger you, he did it because he didn't want to burden you with his problems. Your father was very sad, darling."
“Yeah, I know. I’m trying to help you as I know how, as your doctor and your lover. I know you Sherlock Holmes, and I know that you don’t like to feel this way anymore than I like seeing you like this. Do you want to tell me the reason why now? Remember, don’t do anything that you aren’t ready to okay?”
“Oh Holmes, for such a smart man who shows little to no emotion, you always seem to betray that notion.”
“Let’s make it a third time and see if it is enough.” Sherlock’s lips were already starting to pucker. John’s pressed against his and Sherlock moaned at the joy of being able to do this. John’s mouth spread into a smile, still pressed against Sherlock’s, and he was laughing. Sherlock joined him, the two still nose-to-nose with each other, grinning in the other’s face.
They pressed soft kisses to every part of the other’s face and whispered the word “finally” until they fell asleep.
‘You know he’s sick, yes? You wouldn’t be here otherwise.’ I cut right to the chase. I didn’t have time for the riddles. He looked away from me, and twirled his umbrella around before he found the words to speak to me. He nodded; it looked like it hurt him to do such a menial thing.
‘That’s too long from now, John. I don’t want to wait that long.’ Your tone wasn’t begging, and it wasn’t pleading either. It sounded informative, cool even, I knew that this was your façade. You let go of my arm and rested your hand underneath your head. Your eyes were lidded and I knew that the medicine was making you drowsy, I had to say my goodbyes to you then. I told you not to worry, you’ll be asleep for a long time, and by the time you wake up, and I would already be on my way to come see you. It was almost eight at night when you were admitted. I can see that I was doing poorly at reassuring you, and decided that it was best that I left. I told you that I loved you, and you sighed the same words back to me. You were unresponsive to my final kiss, you were already asleep. I caressed your curls, there were a few patches of missing hair, but it was barely noticeable to anybody who wasn’t looking for it. I told the nurse everything you were allergic to, my mobile number so that she, or your doctor could ring me if anything. I reluctantly told him the names of the people that weren’t permitted to see you and carefully listed the names. It felt like a betrayal to them, but I didn’t want you to get upset and make yourself sicker. I feel like I should have told them after I did it, I couldn’t and I resigned to letting them find out themselves.
“That seems…rather merciful of them, Doctor,” Sherlock uttered, “Why don’t they just kill us instead, that seems like the better alternative. Why send us back in time?”
'How're you feeling, Sherlock?' I wanted to know, you weren't as much of a talker that people thought you were, your silence was troubling. You took a few minutes to respond to me, you were fussing around with the small buttons on your impossibly tight shirt. I loved your shirts so much.
His eyes fluttered open and immediately his mouth curled into a smile. He whispered, “Good morning.” and kissed John. John moaned into the kiss, he wanted him so bad. He
Sherlock nodded and soon felt the cool, wet fingers slide into him. He gasped and shivered as the fingers slid in and out. Sherlock sat up and latched onto John’s body, whimpering. John shushed him and with his free hand, he placed his fingers under Sherlock’s chin and turned it so that he could get a good look at his face.
I tried to look around the flat, see if there was something that could keep me busy besides the telly and the newspaper which I’ve tried to read on multiple occasions and still haven’t gotten past the first page. Then, my eyes rested on your laptop. You know that I try to give you as much privacy as possible, but you didn’t tell me anything, you didn’t tell me your thoughts on your current condition; you even tried to act like it never happened. Who knows what you were up to on that computer, Sherlock? Just like the pill bottle, I would have to investigate your laptop.
“I was without the proper source of entertainment, nothing to arouse my excitement. But then you turned up, and I knew deep down in my core, you were the one.”
Kylie placed a kiss on his cheek and then ran down the hall with the money in her hand. John’s smile faded as Kylie left the room. His eyes sagged and his mouth curved into the faintest of frowns. He refused to look at Mycroft as he talked to him.
John couldn't stand to see Sherlock's face like that. He was hurt, but it was all for a good cause. He'll see.
‘Yes, yes that’s me. I’m glad you could make It, Susanne.’ I was being extra cordial, just so we could look like a couple who could turn out to be great parents for her baby.
I almost wanted to say that you weren't dead yet, but if I did, it would imply that you were going to die and that I was anticipating your death at least a little. I wasn't. The last thing I wanted was for you to die, Sherlock. I told you that we were going to Barts the next day. You didn't respond to me. I understood.
The Doctor, Holmes, and Watson were all laughing at their squabble. It wasn’t serious; they could easily tell that Sherlock and John have had the playful fights more than once. Holmes and Watson made the mistake of glancing at each other and immediately, they couldn’t turn anywhere else. The Doctor was the only one really watching where they were going. Eventually, Sherlock and John’s argument were done and they were walking with each other as closely as possible without actually making any bodily contact.
Watson never did answer that question at the chapel. He couldn’t find his answer, just as he couldn’t find it back in their flat when they received the marital status of their counterparts. But now, as he watches Sherlock and John waltz about, laughing and smiling without a care in the world, he felt that sense of immense pride and joy wash over him all over again. He couldn’t be happier that they were at given the chance, and took it. He wished them immortality, even though he knew it was impossible, but he wanted to see them happy forever, to know that they were happy. Their happiness is his. His eyes were focused on Holmes again, and Holmes must have felt the eyes on him because he let one open to peek back at Watson. And it was then in that moment, Watson knew his answer. With his lips parting into a smile, he mouthed the word, “Yes.”
I put my hands in my lap, still sort of missing the way his curls coiled around my finger moments ago.
Sherlock’s cock was already leaking pre-cum, John smiled at the sight. He wanted to satisfy Sherlock.
"Doctor, Sherlock got addicted to drugs when he got older. It was pretty bad too, it was worse when he first started from what I've heard from his brother."
John didn’t miss the way Sherlock smiled to himself at being called that endearment. Sherlock’s hand moved underneath Rosie’s chin to tilt her head so that she would look him in the eyes. “Would you like to tell daddy what you did?”
I stood up now, and you still had your hand on your loosely-wrapped towel. I should’ve let you get dressed; I should have given you some dignity. How embarrassed you must have felt.
Watson felt his cheeks flush at the statement. That was one of the highest compliments Holmes has ever paid him and he could feel the heat rushing all over his body. Holmes was truly a one of a kind man.
‘Doubt it, it was predictable, and you wouldn’t have liked the results anyway. Such an easy case, I should’ve solved it sooner.’ You started to mumble to yourself towards the end of the sentence.
Holmes was musing around in the flat, since Watson left. He found the time to check on one of the various experiments he was conducting even though Watson wasn’t a fan of them. He already had to get rid of the two in his room, no matter how much he didn’t want to. Watson claimed that it was malodorous and that it might cause several health problems should he continue to live in it. He was so proud of it too, he was going to get great results because it was unusually warm in those days when he first started and because of the way the building was built, Watson’s room was in more sunlight than Holmes’s was. So Holmes placed a bowl of fruit on the window sill in Watson’s room, and then another one in his room, just to see how fast they would spoil. And suffice it to say, when they actually did start rotting, Watson wasn’t happy one bit.
"I scarcely think that there would be a crack of any kind in a house so immaculate as this, Doctor." Watson added. The beads of sweat were rolling off of his face.
But that all seems like an eternity ago. John still has trouble believing that all of that really happened, he likes to think that Sherlock drugged him again and he missed the whole night before their wedding. But when Sherlock talks about it, John realizes that it was real.
Sherlock responded, "Yes, John 1890." we're in a time-machine, the TARDIS is a time-machine, got it?"
He wasn’t sleeping at their house as much as he used to, he found himself at Baker Street many nights in a row. It felt right, seeing Sherlock wake up in the morning with his hair all messy from the sleep that he would eventually succumb to, yawning and stretching his long limbs in every which way, and then walking over to John and asking for a cup of tea with the rare smile on his face. John noticed that they smiled a lot more in each other’s company. Sherlock would sit in his chair and just stare at John for long periods of time, John would pretend not to notice, but he would eventually make eye contact with Sherlock.
The older version of Sherlock tried his best to hold back the tears, he remembered all the pain and suffering too clearly. He wished that he had found John sooner, maybe he wouldn't have turned to the drugs, or tried to kill himself by overdosing so many times. Things could have been different, so much more different. But he has John now, and that's what matters.
Sherlock just smiled again. He didn't respond to John's statement. John gave a dry smile and then grabbed the cup again and finished the rest of the liquor in it. He shook his head and closed his eyes as the warm sensation traveled through his mouth and slid down his throat. He held up the hand that was holding the glass still and pointed a finger at Sherlock.
That was all he would say before going about his morning. John agreed. He missed the familiar grooves of the armchair from his time away. He missed the sensation of Sherlock being near him, his scent filling the air whenever he walked in. It just wasn’t the same without Sherlock.
No more. No fucking more. He was not going to take out his anger on her. He was not going to do that to her because she was sweet and kind and blessedly innocent. She was his little girl.
John's eyes widened, he had almost completely forgotten about it! It wasn't as if Sherlock was the type of person to let everybody know that his birthday was only a day away, or tell anybody when his birthday was. Hell, John had to go to Mycroft to get the date! Sherlock isn't big on birthdays, but he would still be hurt that John didn't even try to celebrate the day of his birth, and John will not be able to tolerate that. It only seems right, since Sherlock remembered his, and Mrs. Hudson's.
John tapped Sherlock’s shoulder for him to move over so he could sit up. Sherlock laid, one arm propped under his head, watching a very naked John make his way to his closet. Silence fell in the room, but it was comfortable. They were comfortable.
Sherlock waited for a response. Rosie hiccupped and started playing with her blocks. Sherlock sighed.
“Well how was I supposed to know the door was open? I was too busy making sure that Holmes didn’t turn your brain into mush!”
I asked you what the problem was, because you weren’t moving or talking, you were just staring at me and as much as I loved it, there had to be a reason. I asked you again and this time, you just smiled and shook your head.
"When we first met of course, you probably don't remember because I kind of overloaded your mind with the TARDIS, but I marked it on my calendar, and today is the day!"
In spite of myself, I smiled. I hate the way you can make me melt sometimes, but now and again, I miss it.
Sherlock's body was still there, there is no doubt of that. John never believed in ghosts and hauntings and other paranormal things that people can't get enough of these days. Would he start to believe in them now? Sherlock would probably be the type of person to roam the earth, searching for that last case, or trying to perform one last experiment. Sherlock always hated sleep. The thought of Sherlock rising out of his grave and looking on at it with an irritated face made John chuckle, but his smile vanished and his mouth twisted. He almost broke the inside of his pockets because of it. Sherlock was...no. Sherlock is dead. He walks faster so that he can get away from the cemetery.
He could see Sherlock’s form sit and he too propped himself up on his elbows to listen to what the man had to say.
Watson snorted, “One can only think about how that will turn out. Two Sherlock Holmes’s in one room. I do hope the flat is still intact by our return.”
You nodded first and held your arms out. I was excited for you, I wanted you to hold her, I wanted you to feel her, to actually see her. But before I could place her in your arms, you retracted them and refused to take her. I asked you why you did that, what happened. You crossed your arms and told me that it was nothing. You were worrying me, Sherlock.
The ride home was quiet. We were both processing our thoughts on the matter. You were facing the window but I still felt your soft hand curl into mine. You wanted the physical intimacy more than anything. I was more than happy to give it to you.
He stood from his chair and gathered both of their plates. He tossed them in the sink and opened a cupboard. There was a bottle of wine sitting there, much to Sherlock’s surprise.
“You told me flat out that he was going to help you investigate, and when I tried to ask you more, you got very defensive, but I let you do what you wanted to, I always do, you know that.”
Sherlock sent him another selfie of just him frowning. He added the crying emoji and the sad face, and then a bee for good measure. His phone vibrated and he smiled at John’s message.
“I loved Mary, at least, I think myself to have loved her when we first met. We encountered each other through Holmes; she came to him for a case. Her father went missing and the only person, other than herself, was her father’s friend, Major Sholto.”
John looked around. The only other person in the car was himself. His jaw clenched as he realized where he was. He looked out the window and saw his flat there. He hesitated to get out, he couldn’t face it. The first room he would see was Kylie’s. He tried to force himself to say something to the driver, to tell him to drive him to the pub a few blocks down from there.
Watson nearly spat out his tea. He had to force it down his throat before he said anything. He slammed the cup down, and the newspaper along with it.
'I've got the results, er, the diagnosis here.' I gave him a nod to show that I...that we wanted to hear it.
John didn’t reply. Greg shut the door and watched the car pull away with a father who just lost his child. John almost told the driver to take him to the nearest pub, but then that’s what got him in this mess in the first place. The sky looked grayer to him. In fact, everything was duller now that Kylie wasn’t around. He didn’t even want to think about the flat without her in it. Didn’t he wish for this though? Didn’t he spend so many nights, watching her sleep, thinking about dropping her off at Mycroft’s house? Looking for an alternative to living with him?
John smiled brightly, and it was contagious because Sherlock soon had the same grin on his face. He was trying so hard not to cry.
Watson clumsily grasped Holmes's hand, but he quickly let it go and rested them on the table. Holmes would shoot glances at Watson every now and again to make sure he didn't expire, but thankfully, he didn't. The Doctor was also the other person who was amused by this. It was easy for him, they weren't interrogating him. Holmes was now shivering with poorly hidden excitement and showing each and every tooth in his mouth. This was something rare, as Holmes was normally cool and calm and collected. He looked very much like a schoolboy who's just gotten a compliment by their teacher.
He pulled Sherlock into the tightest hug and that’s when Sherlock lost it. John could barely hear the loud applause coming from their guests as he rubbed Sherlock’s back. He knows that Sherlock has never had anyone care so deeply for him before, besides himself, and outright admit to the public. Sherlock could barely contain himself, and John didn’t want him to. It was their wedding day, and they could cry as much as they wanted. Lestrade released him and then made his way to John where they shared a friendly hug and a gracious pat on the back. He whispered congratulations to John and Sherlock and then took his seat. Molly stood up and took over his position.
Sherlock cocked his head in utter confusion at John’s words. “And why would you think that I can ever grow bored with you, John? You said it yourself, your company is enough for me.”
It made Sherlock’s heart warm to see that John was finally starting to become more confident after their talk, it also excited him because he had so much more to say to John. That man deserved to be showered in love the same way he did Sherlock. They lay in bed and he saw John strip himself of his shirt and lay down beside him. Sherlock rolled over so that his head was resting on John’s unbelievably soft chest, and his hand was on top of his stomach. He closed his eyes and inhaled John’s scent. Like mint and lavender. Sherlock smirked, he was using his soap.
He broke down in Kylie’s room, clutching one of her stuffed animals. He didn’t want to break down, but it was the liquor in his system that made him do it. He missed her dearly, he missed Sherlock dearly.
“You know that I miss my man.” Sherlock teased. John stood up and pulled Sherlock into another kiss. He opened the closet and pulled his jacket out. Sherlock walked out first and let John close his door. John signaled to the nurse that he was leaving, she, still on the phone, only waved.
Sherlock gave John a small smile and climbed in the bed with him. Sherlock reached up and wiped away the tears that John missed on his cheek, and John fought every urge to kiss him and make love to him right there.
"Nonsense! Holmes, you are the one that caused all of this and it is only right that you let them spend at least one night here, in the guest bedrooms! Or would you prefer to share a room?"
Said man lifted his hands in surrender at John’s exclamation. His cheeks tinged red and he said, “John, you know that shopping is not my skill. I’ve not quite got your knack for it. We left shortly after our phone call and Rosie felt a little better. You know that I want everything to be perfect for you when you get home because you’re always so tired and stressed when you come back.”
From the darkness emerged John with his hands up as if he were to be arrested by the police. He had blood coming from his head. A head wound, no doubt. His clothes were dishelved and had patches of dirt on visible areas. So they were even less gentle with him it seemed.
As soon as Greg finished speaking, you twirled about in that amazing coat you wore and walked out of his office, leaving me behind. I should've called you out on it, like I usually would have, but it seemed different, I felt like I could let this one slide, just this once. I followed after you, if you weren't aware of my presence, which I'm sure you were. Your mouth ran a mile a minute, something along the lines of 'bank' and 'daylight robbery' oh god, you are so brilliant. You deduced that they were already robbing a bank, and they were, right in broad bloody daylight. There was money being thrown about, some was stuffed into their enormous duffle bags, the stray ones, they were gently gliding in the air. You had no plan, I saw it in your face, the cops weren't there yet, so it was just me and you, as it always should be.
"So, Doctor, what happened? Did you find out what exactly was going on? Why those two men upstairs have the same names as us, live in the  same flat as we do and have the same professions Sherlock and I?"
'I've seen better days, Mycroft.' you answered. I had the strange notion that the conversation wasn't going to last very long. Sadly, I was right.
"....The day Kylie was born...well it was a crazy day, to put it mildly. We were on a case, one of the last cases we ever took. Your mood was making me worried, so I gave Greg a ring and asked, well...more like pleaded for him to scrounge something up. Surely there was some type of crime going on, London's underworld was crawling with thieves and criminals and whatnot, they're like...spiders...they only live long enough to breed. There was Moriarty, but I don't want to get into that now. He's gone, you saw to that when you left, even if that meant leaving me alone.
"Say goodbye to your companions, this will be the last time you shall ever lay your eyes on them again. This goes for both sides, that is, if they all blink first."
‘You’re one to talk; I’m not the one who was divorced.’ I can be very mean at times. The words hurt her, it was all too apparent on her face. I immediately felt remorse.
'I don't want her to see me get worse. I want her, I want all of them, to remember me as the person that I was when I met them.'
"You know there's nothing to be nervous about, all our friends are going to be there, I'm going to be there too, Sherlock."
Sherlock’s head shot up and the tears were pooling in his eyes, one breath away from spilling over. John’s eyes went glassy too.
Sherlock had the look of amazement and fear, if Holmes were to describe it. He stood back up and then spun around a few times in a circle so that he could try and make something of this. How? He thought, how could this be possible? He knew that The Doctor was going to take them both on a romantic trip, pre-wedding, but they ended up in Victorian England. He remembered getting knocked over by the man who called himself Holmes, but that was all he could really remember. There were the vague memories of John waking him up and whispering sweet nothings to him, but he had plenty of those memories. He turned back around to face Holmes.
You told me to stay, your hand was latched onto my sleeve and you were wrinkling it. How you pleaded Sherlock, quietly, your eyes were watered and your lips were pursed. You wanted me to lay down with you and you wanted me to love you and I wanted to love you. I let out a sigh, you would have hated yourself, Sherlock. You would have spat at yourself and told yourself that you were displaying a gross amount of sentiment. You were so painfully human Sherlock, and I think you hated that about yourself because you've been hurt so many times. You didn't want to hurt anymore.
The tombstone is worn and grey, with the air composed of anger, grief, and relief. John stares at the headstone with a blank expression as he lets all the memories that come with the name that is engraved in it.
You let out a sigh, like you preparing to head out into the void. You opened the door, my eyes landed on the taxi that was waiting outside of the flat. I grabbed your hand and gestured towards the vehicle with my head. You blinked at me, but you didn’t move yet.
John noticed the Detective Inspector's tone. He wanted to be angry with him, but he couldn't find the heart. This is what made John sit down. Slowly, almost like a cornered animal, he pulled the chair back and then took a seat. Kylie watched him with careful eyes. This is the calmest he's ever seen her. He folded his hands in his lap and stared directly at Mycroft.
Holmes shot out of his chair and danced over to Watson, his Watson. He grabbed the man by the shoulders and was all in his face with the wide smile that rivaled the Cheshire Cat's and began to excitedly spout word after word.
You were afraid. You begged me to stay with you, even though I couldn’t. I nodded and I kissed you and I whispered in your ear that I loved you, and that I will stay with you. I watched as they wheeled you away. I took a seat in the waiting area and I remember spending that whole time there hoping, wishing, praying, that you’ll be alright.”
When John thought he wasn’t looking, Sherlock spotted the lonely tear roll down his cheek and frown. This man deserved all the love in the world.
I was suspicious, but I walked over to the door to save her trouble and to be polite. Once she made it to the hallway, she turned around and gave me a huge smile.
‘We don’t have many options do we? If we don’t get this surgery done then the cancer cells will grow and you’ll get sicker than you already are.’ I felt like I was talking to a patient.
You sighed; you were no doubt insulting me mentally because I couldn’t understand the question asked.
All I could think about that night, was your surgery going wrong, and then I tried to think of something else but the only other thought that came to mind was not talking about the war more.”
“It does not matter which animal I have designated you as. All that matters is who triumphs, and wins. I could be the cat, and ensnare you in my claws, you little puny thing, or I could be the mouse, and have you chase me all over London until you get distracted or lose me and then I remain unseen. Of course, there are some cases where the cat ends up in a pool of its own blood, while the mouse scurries away joyous over its victory and off to begin the cycle anew.”
He told me that he doesn’t mean me any harm, and then he said something cryptic pertaining to the hospital. Then he asked me, ‘How is he? Is the operation done?’
He didn’t miss the way Sherlock’s eyes closed and his body flinched at being called love. He swallowed and clenched and unclenched his fists.
“…I was so alone…and I owed you so much. There was so much that I wanted to say to you that couldn’t get the chance to say because I thought that you were…I thought that you were gone from me…
It wasn’t until we got back, it was getting late, the sun was already setting and we’ve had enough fun for one day. You looked distracted; you just sat on the couch and stared into space. Normally I would have just kept to myself because it wasn’t the first time you’ve done that, but I was worried. You smiled all day and so it was odd that you would all of a sudden just, mope. I made you some tea and then sat down in my chair, watching you watch nothing. I’ve always wanted to know what goes on in that big, beautiful mind of yours, but you would never let me.
“Maybe if you stay outside long enough, you can come pick me up after my shift is over.” John was joking. He took the last sip of his coffee before tossing the empty cup away. Sherlock failed to see the humor in it.
‘You know what I mean, John, have you actually sat down and talked to him about what’s bothering him? He looks very…troubled I believe is the right word.’
I offered the box to him, and for a moment he looked tempted, but he shook his head still refusing to believe that someone bought him a gift. I sighed and set the box on the kitchen table.
Kylie thought for a moment before she decided that he was right and walked up to Molly. Molly pulled Kylie into the tightest hug she could muster. When she released Kylie, John could see the poor girl's chest rising as she tried to catch her breath. Molly stood back up and motioned towards the empty jungle gym.
‘Fine, the doctor said that she was healthy. I’m glad, I wasn’t exactly doing…the right things, when I found out I was pregnant.’
“They’re called Weeping Angels. They’re very dangerous, yes they are statues but looks can be deceiving. When you see one you must not blink under any circumstances. Don’t blink, don’t move, and don’t even breathe. Every time you blink, they get closer, and if they get close enough to touch you…”
Kylie smiled widely and ran off to go join the other children in whatever game it was that they were playing. By now, it looked like it had dissolved into nothing more than a simple game of freeze tag. John was happy to see that they accepted her into their little crew without any hassle. Back in his day, you had to do some stupid dare or something along those lines just to prove that you were cool enough to join. Maybe that was just John's friends who did that to him, he wouldn't be surprised, honestly. He took a seat with Molly on the bench just in front of the playground, in perfect view of Kylie. They didn't talk much, they just sat and watched Kylie play with her new friends. John tried to ignore the moms sitting on the bench adjacent from him. He wasn't too fond of their lustful gazes.
"Yep. I saw him walking home from school one day and well...he looked awfully upset about something but I didn't know at the time."
Kylie tried her best to wait up with me; her little eyes sagged and drooped as she struggled to stay awake. It’s the cutest thing; I wish you could’ve seen more of it.
“Where would I go, John? Have you forgotten why I’m here in the first place?” There was humor in Sherlock’s tone. It made John feel stupid for thinking such things.
“While my mind began to process all of the information I was soaking in, the doors slammed shut and I found myself unable to get out. The next thing I know, I’m watching Sherlock’s life, his childhood, his adolescent years, and his adulthood, which is where he meets me.”
Sherlock opened the other eye and sat up. He stretched his arms out as he yawned and then looked back down at the food.
Mrs. Hudson laughed and waved at the both of them. She had half a mind to tell John to call her sometimes, it got lonely being the only tenant in the flat. She tried renting it out, 221B, but every time she opened that door she expected to see Sherlock lounging about in his house clothes, or shooting holes in the wall. She would sit in her kitchen and close her eyes and swear that she could still hear John and Sherlock laughing, or arguing, or even hear their moans of pleasure after dark. She missed John terribly, and Sherlock too. She closed the door after they turned the street and went back to her flat. She washed all of the dirty dishes and then took a seat in her chair. It was completely quiet. She hated it.
“No, no.” Sherlock chuckled softly and shook his head as he wiped away the tears. John looked confused at what he wanted. Sherlock took John’s hands off his face and pressed a small, wet kiss to his knuckles.
He started walking and they followed after him. It was comfortable outside, John wouldn’t wear so many layers with this type of weather but they weren’t in his time. They were in the nineteenth century and it wearing layer upon layer was considered fashion by the people. He felt sorry for the ladies, who were stuck wearing those hot dresses. The Doctor was stuck in his own little world, so stuck in it that he probably forgot that the two Johns were with him. Every so often, John would see Watson staring him down and then facing forward when he thought John was looking. He was trying to survey John, trying to deduct probably. John knows from experience that no matter how many times he tries to deduce people on his own, he’ll never be up to Sherlock’s caliber. That’s a very learned skill he has.
Holmes’s cheeks turned red from being flattered at the compliment The Doctor gave him. Watson couldn’t help but smirk, Holmes always seemed to have a weak spots for compliments on his genius and brilliant deductions. But just as happy as Watson got when he saw Holmes’s reactions to compliments, he couldn’t help but feel a bit sad at the thought that it was because hardly anybody pays him one. But that didn’t matter because he had Watson now, just as Watson had Holmes.
You, Kylie, and I spent a pleasant few hours inside of the living room. I was catching up on my telly and you were laying with me on the couch as I scratched your scalp. Kylie was in her swing seat, the fancy thing you insisted on buying for her. It played classical music and rocked her back and forth, she looked pretty content with everything. You were quiet, but I didn't think much of it. You were watching the show with me and I recall you liking it. Luther, it's called, and I think that you only watched it because you had a small crush on the main character.
'I want you to go away now.' You said to me. You didn't mean to be so harsh, you were upset and you were exhausted. You didn't see me frown and I was glad that you didn't because then I would have started a war.
But Sherlock just couldn't stop nodding, and in one big rush, the word "Yes" managed to escape his mouth, as well as the tears of joy that so many other people have talked about having in their lifetime, Mrs. Hudson especially. John's eyes were getting teary as well as he rubbed soft circles on the younger man's bare shoulder. John wasn't one to show emotion, neither was Sherlock, but here they were, almost stark naked in their rooms, quietly celebrating their new-found engagement. John had that familiar aching in his chest, and it's what he got whenever Sherlock wasn't around, but he was here now, and he was so close. John grabbed Sherlock and brought him into a deep and passionate kiss, all of the words they couldn't say pouring into their kiss, and it hurt so good. Sherlock released himself from John's kiss and then slowly sank into John's chest, getting in the scent of his fiancee, feeling every hair on his chest, wanting to be as intimate as possible. John knew what he was doing, and he slowly rocked him back and forth.
The rest of the evening was spent with Sherlock and John enjoying each other’s presence, and there wasn’t much talking involved. Every so often, John would catch Sherlock staring down at his food, his lip would quiver and he would set his fork down to wipe away the excess tears. It made John sad to see him so affected by his words, and he wished that the world showed him kindness from now on. He tried so hard, and he was a good man. They were the last to leave, of course, Angelo told them as politely as possible to leave. As usual, the men didn’t have to pay for their meal, but they tipped the man generously.
“’Sometimes I get sad too. I get sad when Papa gets sad, or when he tells me a story about you. I get sad when Papa tells me to sleep with him because that means he’s lonely. I get sad because you’re my daddy, now you’re my angel daddy, and I don’t know who you are. Papa loves you so much, but you’re gone and so now it’s just me and Papa. Sometimes I dream that we’re all together, and we’re happy, but then I wake up and remember that you’re in the sky and you’re smiling at Papa and me.
“That is rather peculiar. But to return to the topic at hand, we eventually found the remains of her father and the treasure he died for. I remember my declaration of love to her. It was very…cliché, if I could remember. I know now that my proposal was from the spur of the moment and excitement of Holmes’s fantastic deduction that solved the case. “
'However, we will need to keep a close eye on you. I'm sorry, but we have to.' He interjected. He felt bad for your cancer returning, but it never left your system. If I was the one operating on you, I would've made sure that every cancerous cell in your body was removed and then I would have kept a very watchful eye over you because...because that's the over-protective husband in me. You would have hated me, Sherlock, but I think you did anyway because I rarely let you move from the bed.
Until the day I walked to your room to find all of our friends parked outside of your door looking as pissed as ever.
“Monday…Tuesday…Wednesday…every day seemed longer that week because of your operation. Friday, was the day. The day that we would go to the hospital to get the cancer cells removed. You didn’t know what to do, Sherlock. You went from plucking at your violin strings, to checking on one of your experiments, the one I deemed safe enough to conduct around Kylie, to just lying on the couch or typing away on your laptop. Everything seemed so surreal for me, Sherlock. I felt that maybe this wasn’t really happening, that maybe I would wake up and find you lying beside me fast asleep, and that Kylie was fast asleep in her crib and everything was okay. Just once, everything would be okay for us. But I guess people like you and me don’t get happy endings, huh?
“This is a flashlight. It’s powered by electricity and it works a thousand times better than a candle or a gas lamp. Observe.”
"I got the highest mark on the test today, Papa. The teacher said that I'm one of her 'brightest pupils.'"
He limped down the stairs and then grabbed Sherlock in the tightest hug he could manage. It felt so nice to touch him, to feel him again. His smell was back in John’s mind, burned into it. He could hear the low rumble of Sherlock’s laugh and the touch of his hand on John’s back as he moved it up and down. John couldn’t help it but pat his back. He still had the coat, from all of those years.
Sherlock Holmes was naked in his bed. He was fast asleep, lying on his stomach, bare ass exposed, the sheets only covering one of his legs. The sunlight crept in through the closed curtains. It shone on him and made him look like an angel. His mouth hung open slightly, every other breath was a snore, his curls fell haphazardly on his face. His afterglow was beautiful.
‘Look, Sherlock,’ I began, ‘I know that this is worrisome for you. You’re going to have an operation, which makes everyone a bit jumpy. Trust me, I had my share of worked up nerves, and I’ve had to comfort patients feeling the same way you did.’
"Yeah well I'm sorry, but my head is killing me. I think I cracked it open on something when they threw me in here."
"I have reason to believe that John was lying about work. But why would he do that? Does he not want to celebrate my birthday?"
‘So why are they still here?’ Your heart-rate monitor was beeping quicker as you tossed and turned and I was getting nervous. I responded with, ‘Because they care about you, Sherlock, that’s why!’ Your indifference towards them agitated me, I’m not going to lie. You stopped moving and then stared at me as you started to speak. You said, ‘I understand that John, truly I do. I’m keeping it in their best interest to keep them away from me.’
John thought that he could finally be happy again. He was getting married to the woman he loved, and had his friend back. He thought that he could move on. But like most things in the doctor’s life, it was never that simple. He should’ve known that life with Sherlock would never be easy or calm, but he could never get rid of the rush he felt with him. He felt the surge of excitement, anxiousness, and many other times, ecstasy. It was more than what he ever felt with Mary. She was something of a stress relief, his form of therapy, the piece of the puzzle that didn’t quite belong. But it seemed like she was getting along with Sherlock, she even told John that she liked him when they met the night he returned. He didn’t see that behind the beautiful mask of kindness and warmth, was a cold and ruthless assassin. He should’ve noticed that she was using her own mental mind games on Sherlock and on John too. She made it look like she wanted John and Sherlock together, solving crimes like before and loving every minute of it, but she was only trying to push Sherlock away. She was a selfish lover.
But I thought that, you know, someone as meticulous as Sherlock Holmes would be the one to nitpick at everything I do, and he does, he certainly has let me know on countless occasions that I type like a sloth (his own words) but beyond that he doesn’t hound me if I leave a cup of tea for too long on the coffee table, actually, now that I think about it, he probably doesn’t even notice.  It’s nice, I guess, to not have someone constantly up your arse about small things. But sometimes, he’s just maddening. He’ll often be so in his own head that he’ll clean up our dinner (while I’m still eating, mind you) and will just toss it all the while explaining his case summary. I spoke to him, and told him that next time he should ask if I’m finished, rather than just assume that because he’s done, I’m done too. He blinked like he was snapped out of his daze and then looked at the bin and back at me. He apologized shortly and then made his way over to the couch as if it never happened. There was something about the way he reacted that made my chest ache a bit.
Sherlock gave a nod and then made his way to the porch. He made sure John was standing behind him when he opened the door and then he let John enter first. The inside made John want to curl up on the floor and fall asleep. It was nice and warm and so very inviting now that the owner was in it. The fire was just put out; he could hear the crackling of the burnt wood and smell the scent of fire. He watched as Sherlock emerged from the kitchen and took a seat in his chair. He motioned for John to take his seat. John was so happy to be reunited that he almost didn’t notice that he took a seat in his old armchair. Sherlock kept it all of these years. He was facing Sherlock now. Sherlock never got rid of the chair, he probably moved it himself because he didn’t trust the movers to handle with the care he had for it. John saw the imprints of his hands on the arms, from all the past times he sat down in it. He left it how John touched it, never mind the nights he slept in it, like Lauren said. It was the only thing of John’s that he had. That he could remember him by. Just like that, the air was heavy and John tried everything to not openly weep in front of the man he’s wanted for so long.
'You'll break Mrs. Hudson's heart, you know, by not permitting her to see you.' I wanted to see if you were mulling it over in your mind. If you really wanted this. You closed your eyes and slid under the covers of the bed with your back facing me.
John wanted to answer, but all that came out was a sigh. He patted Sherlock's hand and pressed it to his lips.
Sherlock stopped scrubbing and looked up at him with sad, glassy eyes. He just stared at John for a while before he muttered, “I’m sorry.”
“So you intend to kill us? I thought we would get to know one another first, Mr. Moriarty. It hardly seems professional that you wouldn’t care to understand your archenemy better.”
The next day, John finally had to return to work. It was different without him there. Sherlock had just gotten used to his constant presence again, and now, he was gone. Rosie didn’t seem to mind the absence much, she was usually with Sherlock for most the day anyway, he wondered if she even knew John was gone. He busied himself with playing with her, watching yet another rerun of Teletubbies in sheer horror, and thinking about new cases Lestrade might have. They were probably fives and below, so he let the thought go quickly. He looked at the clock, John would be due home soon and Rosie had yet to have her supper. By the time he fed her, John returned home. She could barely keep her eyes open.
After sitting for a few minutes joined together, Sherlock slowly rose from John’s lap and laid back on the bed. John picked his boxer briefs up and cleaned the come on his stomach, Sherlock’s eyes were half-lidded, sleep ready to take him. John smiled and kissed him one last time before resting his head on his boyfriend’s chest, feeling Sherlock’s long fingers carding through his blond hair.
John considered it for a minute. Maybe some fresh air would do them both some good. He started typing away.
Your attitude was quite different, love. You were withdrawn almost, don’t get me wrong, you were sharing my feelings of happiness and the anxiety that came with it, but you…I don’t know how to say this…you weren’t talking to anybody. Sure we had those little conversations in bed before we turned in for the night, but they weren’t the same, it felt like you were doing it more out of routine instead of the actual enjoyment and intimacy we got out of it when we first started. I was worried about you, something was clearly on your mind, you would just sit and space out on occasions and it would take for me or Mrs. Hudson to shout your name in order for you to even realize we were there, and even then you would sort of dismiss us. I tried talking to you, Sherlock; I would join you on the couch and give you soft kisses in your wonderful dark tresses, and then wrap my arms around you and whisper in your ear.
“Time and time again, I’ve been told the same things over again. I’ve been told that I would never find someone who loved me, that I would die alone, and that I would never have friends, and after a while, I started to believe them. I’ve always thought that it didn’t bother me, that I could spend my entire life alone in solitude and isolation and not care a fig about it. How wrong I was.”
John woke up with a start. He was out of breath and his eyes darted around the room. He was in his bed, he fell asleep, and he had a bad dream. That was it. That was all. He pressed around in his bed. He was okay, he was alright. When he was sure that he was okay, he laid back down and ran a hand through his hair. He tried to hold back but he just couldn’t. He broke down. He couldn’t take much more of this.
I remember holding Kylie and staring at her as she smiled at me. She was so innocent, so clueless about the situation around her, the situation she was born into. My smile was apologetic and I stroked her cheek.
"Not this time. Kylie, she called me. She told me that you were up late, shouting at Sherlock when in reality nobody else occupied the room, save you. She told me that you said that 'She couldn't help you'."
“So my vow to you, John Watson, is that no matter what we go through, we go through it together. It’s just the both of us against the world.”
John’s eyes were closed. He jolted as he felt Sherlock’s tongue trail his whole length. His chest heaved as he felt the growing pressure in his groin, he was close.
He poked the syringe into his left arm. He pressed down on the plunger and felt the liquid enter his body. He closed his eyes and let his head lean back on to the wall. Shortly thereafter, he felt the effects of his drug-induced mind and let them take him to his slumber.
Your response was the usual, “Hmm” that you were so fond of when you weren’t interested in talking to anybody. She didn’t seem the least bit phased, which was a rare thing among the people who met you. I didn’t want you to chase her away so I took over the conversation, as I found myself doing most days.
I wanted this, Sherlock, I wanted this intimacy, and it’s been so long since we had it. I wanted to feel your soft skin rubbing against mine, I wanted to have your lips pressed on mine, I wanted you, love; I wanted my Sherlock.
John looks at the clock. He squints because his vision is slightly blurred. Sherlock was right, it was time for him to go and pick up Kylie from Mrs. Hudson. With Sherlock's urging, he was up and grabbing his coat to leave the flat. He turned around and saw Sherlock staring at him with fondness.
Sherlock had his hand on the door and was ready to open it, but he stopped when John started talking. He let go and then turned to face John.
Mycroft looked disappointed to hear that much. I asked him what did he expect from you, and he didn’t know. He probably knew that you were sulking; he just didn’t want to believe it. You’re his little brother, and no one wants to hear that their little sibling has cancer. Not even Mycroft. He wanted to know when you would be out of surgery, and I told him that it shouldn’t be much longer now, probably an hour or two. The sun was almost set.
