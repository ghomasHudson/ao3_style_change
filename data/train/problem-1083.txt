“Agreed.”
John stopped his ministrations and frowned. “I told you to let me take care of you...” he admonished, although he was ready to bend to his lover’s wishes if Sherlock really wanted it.
However, Anthony Majors’ murder didn’t belong to the unsolved cases list—it was just the solution couldn’t be made public. John loathed the idea of labelling it a failure to please Donovan and Anderson, especially after what Sherlock had done and risked to catch Majors’ killer.
Sherlock huffed. “Of course. I met one on a case.”
“You mean you got horny thinking about our first time,” John translated with a grin.
“Undoubtedly, but I can’t bear the idea of you going anywhere near that killer.”
“You let me love you, and that’s what really matters to me. For the first time in my life I had sex because I wanted it... I made love and this is a memory I’ll always cherish,” John said, bringing Sherlock’s hand to his lips and kissing the palm.
Hope you guys like it!!
“Lisa stop! We know it's you”. Sherlock shouted behind her.
“Anyway, apart from Aniket no one else bothered you as such?” Maanav said.
John and Sherlock tore away from each other and looked at Moriarty’s kneeling figure.
“Sherlock. About that night. I’m sorry about leaving you alone like that.” John said in a rush. “There is no excuse to do that-
Present Day-
She would have to add the Retired to her post box soon. How did her grandfather do it? Was it the full word or the short form in a bracket before the name?
She gulped down her gin and tonic in one go and motioned to the waiter for one more.
“On the other hand, I think it’d be better if I give you a size extra, so I can use the extra fabric to make you a blouse. It will come inclusive in the total cost so you don’t have to worry. I know you have unemployment issues Dr-…..
John laughs.
“ I can imagine what they would normally say.” Jameela said smiling a bit “Something along the lines of-
“John.” Mary breathed as if in shock and suddenly a look of fear came into her eyes as she removed her finger from the trigger “John, Moriarty forced-
A waiter suddenly appeared out of seemingly nowhere in front of them and said “Dr Watwe? There’s an urgent call for you from your sister on the landline”.
Mary ignored him “Do you know how long I had to wait to get here? I waited and watched as I saw the two of you run around, having your little adventures , being so blissfully happy together in whatever version of heaven you deemed fit enough to spend your eternities in. I was promised my revenge and I will get it” She put her finger on the trigger and Sherlock tensed as he prepared himself for the pain, once again.
“Sorry. I left it in the car”. Maanav said after searching his pockets.
Greg put his hand through his hair and looked at Sally.
“Okay. Good. So do you have a boyfriend?”
“So, your girlfriend was in on this as well?” John asked casually , his heart and mind in a near paroxysm of hope of a negative answer.
THIS WAS LONG.
She seemed to be teasing him about something which earned her a scowl and a glare at the same time. She looked over the pub lazily and started pointing to various people. The man started saying something rapidly, waving his hands about as her face grew indulgently frustrated.
“That’s for you Captain. Jai Hind” The waiter turned around and saluted her as he walked away.
Moriarty and Mary’s eyes widened as Sherlock swiveled sharply in John’s direction. John smiled tearfully at Sherlock “I couldn’t save you then Sherlock. I had to make sure that no one would tear us apart again. So I made a deal of my own. I would remember everything about our lives then and protect you from them; but to do so I had to break your heart. I’m so sorry my love.” John reached to a disbelieving Sherlock whose eyes had also filled with tears as he gazed down at the brave, loyal and steadfast companion who had truly loved him for all these years.
“Yeah. Apparently, he’s some kind of genius. He came here after getting thrown out of Cambridge. No one knows why though.”
nani- grandmother.
As he waited for the beers, he felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned around to nearly have his heart seize.
“ That’s not what people usually say”. Shanaya said wryly as she picked up two saris and beckoned Jameela to follow her out of the backroom.
So...How long have you been retired from the Army?
“What do they usually say?”
“150 years. Pretty sure that turtle has been older than our story Sherlock”. Mary said as she got up and turned around to point a gun at him.
Jameela  dragged the table a few metres away with her feet so she could put the cup of tea on it.
The roaring in his ears and the deafening sound of his heart shattering on the floor when James refused and broke up with him.
Just as Jameela was about to retort, a black SX4 stopped in front of the booth. Jameela heard the phone click as the window of the car rolled down. A young, attractive woman in a suit was typing on his phone.
John had always knew that their relationship had survived against the clock. But he couldn’t be ready for the ending. Not in a million years.
"You must be Ms Hardikar. I wasn't told someone else would also be coming, however". Mr Choudhary looked concernedly at Jameela.
“Hi Lisa. So… violin huh?” John said.
“It really couldn’t”. Jameela said.
“Ooh, feeling cocky, are we? Me too”.
But like most people trying to keep up appearances, he has an obligatory photo of his family; precariously close to the cup of tea. Plastic frame obviously, (clearly a junior officer at the bank) .The wife and children in the picture had the fakest smiles she’d ever seen out of Marichika’s dreary business parties.
“Your brain and stomach are fucking weird”. Mike muttered from between his arms.
"Want to see some more?"
Rough translation-
John finished with a strong strum. The crowd cheered and applauded loudly.
Sherlock got up from the floor a few inches away and dusted himself off as he walked to his John’s side –
“You didn’t even ask what I wanted. I didn’t even say I wanted a sari. I don’t even know what name to call you by and you're already talking about measuring me”.
“Well that was pretty good.” Lisa said her apparently other tone deaf friends nodded obediently.
The mysterious lady may or not have been telling the truth about her “deep concern” (who the fuck talks like that jeez), but that lady’s methods were definitely suspect.
Oh hey.I hope you didn’t have a problem finding the place.
I'm a loser honestly. I've been swamped with so much pointless ass work for the last two months and I gave an entrance test for a screenwriting degree class which i didn't get it coz life hates me and I've started preparing to do my Masters out of the country and I've been losing it honestly. But finally I'm back and here is another chapter.
“Easy there! Sorry!” Maanav said as he wiped his shirt of the drink he spilled trying to back away from his friend who was now staring at him with the coldest eyes he’d ever seen. He repressed a shudder that had nothing to do with the slight coolness of temperature as he removed his handkerchief to wipe what little had fallen on his pants “Jameela, it’s me Maanav. It’s just me. You okay?”
He chooses the stairwell.
John takes a little bit of extra soap and slides his hand slowly upwards, covering the whole length of his penis until he lets it flop down again, to then immediately grab at its length again. He caresses his foreskin, trying to think of Sarah. She did look rather nice, today. Though, in retrospect, perhaps her clothing style kind of reminded him of Sherlock's, wearing a nice shirt like he always does. Like the posh boy he is. John gently squeezes his penis, gliding his slippery hands up and down. It's not gay, because technically he's thinking of Sarah.
“We have a flight to Amsterdam this afternoon,” Sherlock says.
he’s hearing and feeling, which makes it somehow even more arousing. Soon, it’s not all that clear anymore which is which, who is who, and for a few moments, the bodyswap doesn’t feel all that much like a bad thing.
“We need to talk,” John says. “We have a problem.”
It’s of course nothing to be ashamed of, getting a boner in this situation. Doesn’t mean he’s into Sherlock in that way. If anything, this is because the whole set-up reminds him of his own very first steps into lovemaking, at the tender age of seventeen with that very same Natalie he’d been crushing on for years.
“No, because you’d only be a fifth-alternate dance teacher!” Todrick says.
“They….”
“Look, I get it”, John says. “We've all been young once.”
Sherlock stands up and rolls up the sleeves of his tight, purple shirt. As if he's going boxing. John stares at his long, pale underarms, with its occasional bruises and, higher up, hidden in the fold, old needle traces. It's an unwritten agreement that John never mentions them, unless new ones appear. Then he'd grab his arm, pinch it, make it better.
because he thinks it will make up for what happened at St Bart’s? But perhaps because those two years away have left their marks?”
Sherlock’s mouth runs dry at the sight of him. He’s - he’s not recognisable as himself. He’s a dark shadow, amidst mourners dressed in black. But those other people seem to be just playing dress-up. John
John’s stomach drops.
“How do you feel about our dance later?” She-lock asks John as she’s letting the makeup cook before blending.
. This could be good. This could be extraordinary. This could make this dark evening much brighter.
She-lock did an incredible job with both of their looks. She-lock is wearing a tight-corsetted pink dress, a collared construction around the head, pink heels, a fierce blonde wig and red diamond droplets around the eyes.
John stares at his feet. So she did just give him her number, without ulterior motive. Well, at least not anything illegal.
“It’s what my fans expect from me,” she says. “Everybody loves a good old-fashioned villain.”
, Sherlock scolds himself.
, though barely, I must say, and I walked to the cemetery, where you would have had me bloody visiting an empty urn! And that’s where I’ve been these past few hours. I didn’t know what to do, Sherlock. I just don’t understand why you didn’t… consult me. You are the least consulting detective I know.”
Sherlock pulls back, eyes still closed.
“Well Ru...” She-lock says. "You know I’m all about the body. Literally.”
date,” John, says, annoyed.
John looks up sharply. So he’s going the honest route, then. Bold. But Jonathan has never been a run-off-the-mill bachelor. He’s always stayed true to himself, despite what production might whisper in his ear.
“I relate,” Latrice mumbles. “My husband banned me from cruising.”
Well,
Previously on RuPaul's Drag Race... Jinkx put John and She-lock together for the make-over assignment. They were bonding, until suddenly, Vanjie yelled she found a body.
“Since your ridiculous carnaval rainbow outfit fell open,” John says, pointing. He shakes his head, and emits a short, odd laugh.
“I love grapes,” Sherlock says, smiling at Jonathan. “Give me one?”
Jesus. There have been some messed up makeovers in Drag Race herstory. Crew members. Grooms.
Yes, that’s it.
“You should sleep, for now,” Sherlock says. “I’ll be here if you need me.”
it, finally.”
Slowly, undisturbed, Sherlock peels the banana.
He was there putting up shelves, of course.
“You’ve… ran over here in those?”
Mycroft blinks. “Don’t be absurd.”
With a loud clang, the snap trap closes around his fingers.
“Yeah?” The voice on the other end of the line croaks.
I brought a fake beard,” he says, holding up an old, grey-haired piece that helped him solve a Scientology case once. “I’ll still need to look like a man, just an entirely different one.”
They laugh, for the first time tonight. And as their smiles die down, John stares at the Gherkin, clears his throat.
what they are - into sleep just so he could have a meet-up with a dominatrix?
“Sherlock, last night, it wasn’t... normal,” he says.
“We wanna go from dad to daddy,” Jonathan adds.
“Oh, no, Doctor Watson,” Irene says, slowly elongating herself on the exam table as if it’s a luxury Chesterfield, not a hospital table with some paper cloth on top of it.
David is openly retching by the time the intro starts.
Sherlock reminds himself to breathe. This is a normal, everyday situation in the life of Monsieur Cherverrou. He’s done dozens of these transactions. But what on earth would John be doing out this late, at the Southend fair?
John blinks. Isn’t that… Illegal?
“By the way, errr…” John says, as they sashay away. “That cruise thing. Is that a cruise for two?”
be nice!” John yells.
He feels guilty.
She snaps her fingers. “Scotland Yard, pay attention. This is how you catch a perp.”
“I hope this'll be safe to eat”, Sherlock comments dryly. “Don't want another bullet in my head.”
Sherlock panics. John was not on the list.
She-lock slowly turns to John. “Alone is what I had. Even when Mycroft was still living at Musgrave, but more so after he left. I was alone, and very... strange. A queer child. My parents would be out most of the time, I was left in the care of alternating nannies who kept on… giving up. I read them to filth, mostly. They couldn’t handle it.”
Sherlock raises his eyebrows. What on earth is he implying? Does he want a... helping hand?
“My name is Doctor John Watson. I’m… I was Sherlock’s blogger, companion, colleague, and, he might say, his only friend. We know of course, that isn’t true.”
The whole room changes. As the artificial light drops away, the moon brings out a whole different surface, a different texture to the world. Hidden things are uncovered. Shadows fall differently, like dice.
“Sherlock! Sherlock! Wake up! Sherlock!”
John tries to look back at Sharon, but is afraid to lean too much backwards and fall over. So he just focuses on his end goal - She-lock.
“You can't just steal the bloody evidence.” Lestrade barges inside.
John Watson seems to consider this reply quietly, and She-lock turns back to her sequins and hot glue. It’s not exactly about the money, of course. Her family is quite well-off, and though she wants to provide for herself, she knows there’ll always be a safety net to fall back on. Even if they don’t necessarily agree with her life choices.
Behind him, the rest of the Five wipe away tears. Soon, they hug him, one by one.
That definitely seems to be David’s motto, as well. He can’t stop his inner English lad popping up when there’s free ale, and the more the evening progresses, the bolder he gets. He hangs off Magnussen’s shoulder and whispers in his ear. He dangles from the poles in the middle of the Freedom Bar, exposing his belly button, giggling. He winks at a mortified lesbian nearby.
. Remarkable!”
John’s eyes fill up with moisture, but he clears his throat and Sherlock is not even sure anymore - it could have been just a flick of the light. His mind playing tricks.
“Joking, mate”, he says in a flat, serious tone.
“Besides,” Sherlock says, smiling mischievously. “We have a wedding episode to prepare for.”
“Almost-murderer,” Ru corrects. “Any complaints you can take up with our editor, Jim Moriarty.”
Some of the German tourists have started watching him as if he’s performing a play. John tries to shoo them with a hand gesture.
John shakes his head, annoyed, and hands Sherlock a steaming coffee cup.
It’s as if the ‘soldier’ mode in his body gets turned on.
Wilson runs to the others. “8510! Those are the numbers! Please! I don’t know if they’re in the right order.”
John is watching him sleep. Sherlock can feel it as he lays, eyes closed and on his back, while the morning sunlight touches his skin.
John curses beneath his breath. “They wouldn’t have selected you if you weren’t a genius of sorts. Now solve it!”
“I am not,” Sherlock says, slightly insulted. Though he’s not sure. He silently curses himself: he should have recorded himself sleeping at least once to be sure, but he never has. Never assumed he’d be sleeping next to anyone. He frowns. “Are you... a deep sleeper?”
Before he gets lost in
For a few seconds, they’re both silent, staring at the swinging doors.
Sherlock peels John’s trousers halfway down. His fingers are shaking.
Mycroft raises his eyebrows underneath the blindfold. Probably to secretly glance at the board while the cloth moves. Sherlock smiles.
“No,” Lestrade says. “And anyway, I need to get out of these heels. You stay here, I’ll walk Sharon out.”
“Yes, thank you for inviting me,” she smiles.
It’s almost as if Sherlock’s ghost has let himself in.
John looks at Sherlock in a daze. That’s it? It feels like an abandonment all over again.
He blinks and blinks, against the heaviness of his own eyelids. Then, through drops of water and a misty film, light filters in. The shape of a room. White marble. A bathroom, he is in a bathroom.
Sherlock startles.
“What were the first words you said?”
John straightens the knocker. It keeps him grounded in reality. It’s a visual reminder that
-Spilled tea: gossip/truth exposed
“Not sure if that argument would win a debate competition,” Jonathan says.
He catches Sherlock’s arm.
It takes a while for him to answer.
John stares at his feet. Okay then. He remembers Mycroft’s words, and decides to push through. He bravely looks up.
“Look what you made my body do!” Sherlock yells.
Someone knocks on the door. Quickly, John slips his smartphone into the pocket of his bathrobe, closes it a little tighter and opens the door. He startles.
Sherlock is stunned, seeing and hearing himself talk to him. But it’s John. Unmistakably. The words, the pronunciation, the intonation. The blame.
“You knew and you let me act out that whole piece of appalling theater, yesterday?”
Sherlock grows quiet.
“When it was really bad, I shot up almost every day. I lied to my brother about it. I stole his money to sustain my drug habit in college. I lied and lied and lied-”
Will John now always have such a vivid reaction to seeing Sherlock’s coat?
“It’s best to take out your enemy from the inside,” Sholto whispers in John’s ear. “Don’t be afraid to get your hands dirty.”
“Yes, and I won 100,000 pounds,” She-lock says. “That’ll be about 50 dollars post Brexit. At least this Absolut series pays in American dollars.”
It feels like fighting through a thick mist, like drowning in dirty water. John brings a heavy hand to his eyes. He is crying. Why is he crying?
“We’re in contact. From now on, I will speak as him. You may open your eyes and speak to your friend.”
They briefly lock eyes. Sherlock scrapes his throat, then walks past John, out the room. The door locks so quietly, John can’t stand it.
Oh. So that’s why Bainbridge could stay for now. They needed an even number today.
“The park is almost closed for the day, I would recommend using them tomorrow,” the lady says, her smile faltering a little. “Have a magical time,
“Nothing made me.” John feels anger boiling up.
But then just now… John must have felt it. Surely.
In that exact moment, his phone rings. John walks to his night stand. Who would call at 7:15 in the morning?
“You can try.”
John sighs.
“It’s tomorrow’s lip-sync song. The one for the episode winners to perform,” she says. “I’m trying to learn the lyrics. According to Reddit, I’ll be in the top two tomorrow.”
on them.
They dance, and John knows, he will need to wait until the right moment. And stop this before Sherlock goes too far on television.
“I want to give you the confidence to get the F out of the closet,” Jonathan wastes no time beating around the bush, scissors in hand. They’re in a barber shop, and John is gripping the sides of his chair tightly, whitening his knuckles.
“Apart from our
“Mhm, yes,” Sherlock manages to strangle out of his throat.
“No, that would be… quite awkward”, John says. “But you must… errr. You must have... impulses. Take some pleasure in… pleasuring yourself. It’s not just mechanics to you, is it?”
“Yes”, he answers. But something seems stuck in his throat.
(See the end of the chapter for
She pets John’s hair. “Now you know.”
“Can I?” he asks, close to his ear.
She-lock falls silent. She seems to contemplate something.
“John absolutely adores James Bond, as you are likely aware.”
He lifts a finger and softly traces across Sherlock’s collar bone. Maybe that’s not technically an erogenous zone, but he always wanted to do that. And it seems to have an effect on Sherlock either way, who braces, as if for impact.
She-lock watches John’s eyes go from her to Phi Phi and back again. He seems unsure. Of She-lock?
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s true: she did meet up with a lot of men back in the day. When she was still using. She was going out of her mind, living alone in London, not talking to anyone. Not really. She craved the companionship, even for a night. She was Katya’ing all over the city.
“... and I wanted you to win without people calling you a snake,” Sharon says, “without people hashtagging Team Katya, without all of your dresses being bought with my winnings…”
“I envy your tiny brain, John. This woman is clearly a prostitute. She’s not MI6 - her nail polish and roots should tell you as much. Her perfume’s cheap, her underwear is not. The octopussy on her shoulder is a nice touch, though. Well done, Mycroft.”
the medicine cabinet.”
John shuffles in his seat. Then his eyes fire up like shots. His whisper, fatal.
Sherlock watches him go with a brief look of regret on his face. Meanwhile, Mary scrambles for her clothes and David yells profanities. John can relate. He stares at Sherlock. It seems like a (literal) dick move, for Sherlock to take them here. Is he that desperate now, to take out the competition like this? Is that how much he wants to get married on a tv show? Seems unlike him. Then again, love can make you do crazy things. Especially first love.
“Mind your own business, Conchita,” Sherlock grinds through his teeth.
“I knew yesterday that I couldn’t hide anymore,” Sherlock says.
John is already halfway out the door.
Sherlock shrugs. “I didn't think you and Sandra would be up for it.”
“Sherlock, what are you doing?”
Q reaches into his breast pocket and hands John a pen, adorned with the British flag.
“You see but you do not observe,” Sherlock says, for old time's sake. “
There’s the sound of a zipper being pulled down. John swallows. He covers his face as Sherlock’s hand slides down his spine and then lets go of him.
He can feel his - John’s - heart beating heavily against his chest. How is this possible?
A small pause.
“Nnnhhmm,” John says. His back arches, as Sherlock moves his middle finger in and out, just the tip of it, still.
Underneath him, suddenly the coldness of tiles. It sends a shiver through his spine. Right. Right. Okay. He’s lying on the bathroom floor. A hotel bathroom.
“I just want to put him out of his misery,” Irene says, pouting. “Because you’ve been making him deliciously miserable, haven’t you? It’s been frightfully amusing to watch.”
Is he
“Thank
“What?”
Jonathan puts his hands in his pockets. “Is… Is Sherlock a good man?”
Extra special thanks to all you readers out there. You seriously keep me going. I love hearing what you think, but if you just want to lurk, that's totally fine with me. I hope you enjoyed this chapter. <3
You thought the puns couldn't get any worse. Then you read the chapter title.
John bends forward, gets almost uncomfortably close to the detective. He rests his left hand on Sherlock's knee, which jerks a bit, the only giveaway of any possible nervousness.
At that moment, the man himself - well, almost - bursts through the door. Sherlock quickly closes the drawer.
drag is insane. One of these days, one of the criminal cases she bases her drag on, will be her own.”
“Not you”, Sherlock mumbles
Sherlock leans against the large, oak desk in the middle of the office. There’s still an outdoorsy blush on Sherlock’s cheeks, but he’s no longer grinning like a schoolboy.
“Sherlock was loved,” he says, voice faltering. “I was there when he jumped. He was loved. He was
An annoyed looking Lestrade. Sherlock, pale as a sheet.
John groans. Not the jumpers, please.
Alaska: “Stop relying on that body, She-lockkkk. Literally. Stop doing drag inspired by true crime. Stop with the rigor mortis realness. Goyle, it’s creepy. And that’s a lot coming from me. I dated Sharon Needles.”
John feels as if he’s standing still, while around him, the world is shifting, turning, changing places.
Mary smiles and shakes his hand. “And who might you be?”
Sherlock almost falters. It can’t be…
“You just told Janine I would, you git!”
and then a question mark.
“... and then only won because it fit into the narrative of casting Alaska for next season,” She-lock continues. “Tell me, how does it feel to have reality TV ruin your relationship?”

, his old hair. He can finally fix it right.
“Wear the hat, Sherlock,” John urges him. Sherlock scowls, but puts on the black pointy witches’ hat.
“You have everything you need. So get working.”
He pulls John away from the body he’s crouched over, wielding a magnifying glass confusedly.
points to one of the large, pink boxes in the workroom. Latrice is currently leaning over it, reaching in.
Sherlock moves on to the introduction text. “God’s love and power extend over all creation. Every life, including our own, is precious to God... Good god, how long is this… Right… We can skip that.. Not necessary… I meant ‘good god’ respectfully of course… Praise Jesus etcetera.”
Jinkx, who has noticed the commotion, leans over to She-lock. “Water off a duck’s back, She-lock,” she says.

But Sherlock stops him. “John.”
“Well, you were looking at
Well, those who can. Alaska’s face hasn’t moved since All Stars 2.
“Sir, sir!” the journalists yell over each other, trying to get his attention. “Mister vicar! What’s your name? Why did they choose you as the vicar? Over here!”
Right?
“Still not woken up.” Sherlock says.
All he needs to do is catch the clown who’s running this circus. So going undercover as a psychic was the most logical thing to do.
His heart twinges. “Please... don’t.”
“Wear something stunning, okay? This date comes with an overnight sleep in Jonathan’s penthouse,” she winks.
“Well. It looks like a decent hotel to me. I like large Victorian style buildings.”
“What?”
He follows the cameramen into Sherlock’s room, pushes them to the side. He feels like he’s walking into a soap opera scene: Sherlock has put an open suitcase on his bed and is moving his neatly folded shirts into it. He doesn’t look up at John, face calm, resigned. His fingers only slightly shaking.
again, so he takes out his tongue and sweeps it across Sherlock’s pink nipple in short, broad strokes.
“Better.”
There’s a slight mumbling among the queens. Meanwhile, Todrick passes by Miley again - it turns out, there is only one exit to the studio.
John stands at the pulpit for a while, unmoving, silent. He seems stunned, staring into the gathered blackness of the crowd. He clears his throat repeatedly, looks down at his hands, then up again. Molly starts standing up, looking unsure, but he motions at her to sit down.
“The rollercoaster seems mandatory per contract, but maybe you can find a loophole?” he jokes into the microphone.
“Where did you learn that word?” She-lock huffs. “I’m not a twink.”

listens. It doesn't happen too often, in real life.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John pinches his nipple, quite hard.
“You have a… ummm…” He seems to gather his courage. “You have a boner.”
“Just believe in yourself,” he says.
Ohhhhhh. Sherlock moans desperately.
“Just tell it to us straight,” Bobby says, adjusting his sunglasses. “Are we fixing Charles and Camilla? ‘Cause I’m going to need a raise and a larger gap between seasons.”
“... I naturally jumped in.”
John shakes Sherlock’s head. “I can’t believe we’re about to do this,” he says, approaching rather eagerly for someone protesting so much.
“Jesus,” Sherlock mumbles to himself.
A small noise comes from the back of Sherlock's throat, and the butler leans over him and puts the first dish on the table. It's lobster soup, with prawns scattered across the surface.
“D... Dinner. It's served”, John says. His eyes flash from Sherlock's face to Victor's face.
The words say ‘sorry’. The breakfast says ‘romance’.
John reaches over and puts a hand on Sherlock’s beating heart. “Yes, there is.”
She lowers her gun and walks back to the door, like she doesn’t have a care in the world, then turns around.
He demonstrates by placing both his hands on Sherlock’s legs, and sliding sensually, almost breathtakingly slowly upwards. Christ. Sherlock is so smooth, so soft and beautiful. John feels a slight shiver in his own legs.
“It’s a bit, how do I put this... Thorgy Thor’s Stevie Nicks meets Party City,” Michelle says. “Barf.”
. And you should hear him play the violin. It’s the most heartbreaking thing you’ll ever hear. Pours his soul into it. So is he a good man?” John grins. “He’s a bloody fantastic man.”
“I want the tall dark hero,” John continues. “I want the guy who wears the tight tuxedo, the guy who faces off with criminals in a casino. The guy throwing punches on the moving train. The guy who has witty retorts for the bad guys. The guy who uses a zipline to fearlessly fall from a balcony.”
Jonathan nods. “I asked you to trust me. So I will try to do the same for you. You seem like a good man.”
“A… a bloodbath?” John asks, frowning. Something seems to shift in his attitude. “What… How would you… Why would you say ‘bloodbath’?”
“Lestrade and I.” Sherlock glances at John.
Right - and stop a murderer. Mustn’t forget.
“No they didn’t.”
A huge thank to you to everyone who's been encouraging me, sharing, laughing, beta'ing, or just quietly reading... I hope you enjoyed this little story, I worked very hard on it.
No. She definitely is not.

“How can you not like her, she literally has your hair,” Sherlock says, fuming.
“The answer is no. Pawn. G4 to G5.”
He regrets saying it, here. The mood has shifted. It must be written all over his face.
Thankfully, John is completely caught up in the case, focused and ready to fight. If this all goes south, Sherlock needs him to be a real soldier.
deem unforgivable.
“A last-minute booking, I see,” the woman says.
It’s Moriarty.
It takes John slightly aback.
“Jeeeeeesus.”
The cameras zoom in on him.
“Could be dangerous,” Sherlock says. A bit embarrassing, flirting in front of his brother. This is flirting, isn’t it? Sherlock frowns to himself.
Undisturbed, She-lock continues. “... I turned Joan into a sexy lesbian cab driver, and myself into one of the victims, a lifestyle journalist dressed completely in pink. The red diamonds on my face represent blood, naturally. The larger, scattered diamonds on Joan’s dress represent the suicide pills.”
Who’d have thought they’d actually select him?
Wait. Is John asleep?
“Do you... like my blog... too?”, he asks.
John opens his mouth to protest. He was a doctor, damn it.
Sherlock finally pulls John’s trousers and pants all the way off and tosses them on the floor. He crawls onto the bed, between John’s spread legs. John looks back at him. It’s an odd sight. Sherlock, fully dressed still in his dancing clothes and Belstaff, crouching over him like he’s a murder victim.
“Welcome, everyone. We have come here today to remember before God our… well respected Church member? Sherlock Holmes,” he reads off the paper. “Consulting detective and brilliant mind, admired by even his greatest enemies…” he muses. Surely, he can go off script a little? This vicar clearly didn’t know the deceased very well.
“Loose legs or not, she may
Sherlock stands up, staggering on his feet. The ground seems to shift. He lift his eyes up, but can’t face it - can’t face - John… He turns and flees through a side door.
John glances around the room. The three bodyguards are definitely armed, with multiple guns, it seems. The women probably have small knives or guns attached to their thighs, judging by the outline of their dresses. They’re outnumbered. Though it’s not the first time that’s happened, of course.
He stumbles out of bed, and, still shaky (so not as cool as he’d like), he stomps out the room.
The first rows are empty except for a few distant family members. And… one more person. Sherlock recognises Molly’s silhouette, in the second row. That’s quite a familiar spot for a work colleague. She seems rigid and tense. Sherlock throws her a sideways look as he walks past her, but she doesn’t recognise him - good: his disguise works. Her mouth is a flat line. She looks bleak. Even though she knows he’s not really dead. Great acting, then. Sherlock smiles at her appreciatively, but she doesn’t seem to notice.
All eyes go to She-lock and John. John hesitates, then slowly lifts the pink handcuffs, as if they’re not light as a feather but heavy as Michelle’s old boobs. Breast in peace.
“Don’t forget the pepper sauce,” Sherlock adds, while putting his own fingers near Jonathan’s other hand. “It’s… saucy.”
Back in the viewing room, John shifts his feet. He’s been standing too long - how in the hell are those blokes managing that
The junkie puts his hand inside a tattered mattress that’s turned up against the wall, and digs out a staggering amount of makeup supplies. Not an
John throws him an angry look.
Downstairs, draped in partial darkness, he finds Sherlock, still in his dressing gown and seated on his single chair. A sad trace of smoke leaves the hearth. The fire is out. Only a small nod of his head betrays that Sherlock has noticed John, that he hasn't retreated into his mind palace too deeply.
“Why are you whispering, John?” Sherlock asks. “These windows are tinted and sound-proof. You have nothing to be ashamed of.”
The woman withdraws her hand from John’s knee.
“Beyond your wildest imagination,” Bobby winks.
Waiting.
“You let me grieve, for two years, Sherlock. Do you have any idea what that was like?” John continues, gripping the sides of his chair. He can feel the next wave coming.
In the corner of his eye, he catches a glimpse of John.
When they’re far enough and don’t seem to have been followed, they rest against the brick wall of an alley.
For a minute, all John hears through the phone is laboured breathing and typing, as if he’s phoned a sex hotline for nerds. Then suddenly, the door makes a buzzing sound, and when John pushes it, it opens.
Then he finally, reluctantly allowed his mind to actually go back there. Allowed his bruised heart to beat with a flicker of hope. Might it…. might it be Sherlock? Might he be alive? Might he have been living nearby, all along?
Or is it?
“Oh, I can just see the obituary already,” Moriarty gloats. “British secret service agent and his collaborator, John Watson, were found dead this morning in Disneyland. What a magical place to die.”
“They think I’m a bloody murderer!”
Sherlock ignores the question and leaves his previous body waiting outside while he enters the empty men’s toilet. It’s a tiny space with three urinals, quite close to each other. He approaches one of them hesitantly still, then he stubbornly decides to be almost clinical, professional about this.
Sherlock breathes. “The ridiculous number of riding crops during the horseback riding date, too, of course, were a giveaway. And Hamish the gorilla was really just hubris.”
“Around four,” Sherlock says.
“Don’t make me the villain here, John,” Sherlock suddenly raises his voice, looking up.
“I’m all body, no shade, no
Jesus. Was it really necessary to reveal his real age? Sherlock had kept it hidden quite successfully, and liked to believe he looked younger.
“It’s now time for the, eh, final farewell,” Sherlock says after everyone has shared the bread. “Though, how much of a farewell is death really? One must wonder…”
“That’s none of your business.”
Maybe that’s the answer - he needs to make the service a little amusing, to cheer up John.
(See the end of the chapter for
John pulls Sherlock into his hotel room. Though a little startled at first, Sherlock crosses his arms impatiently.
“Dimmock told me it would save a lot of work. See? I’m all done.”
“I need to quit this show, John.”
John gets out of the shower and quickly wipes himself down. Then, still naked, rubbing his wet hair with a tiny towel, he steps into his hotel room.
“... A real prodigy. Excuse me, I have to go,” Sherlock says, backing up. “Still have to iron my tippet before the service. The archbishop borrowed it. For a Halloween party.”
Also, I have to thank all you guys. The response to this fic has been... overwhelming. I cherish each comment, each kudo, and also every silent reader. You guys literally fuel my writing and revising.
“Sherlock, you need to go back and finish…”
Moran takes advantage of their astonishment to punch John in the face, causing him to release the MI6 magnet. John stumbles backward, loses his equilibrium and falls on his back. Moran jumps on him, and tries to grab John’s rucksack while John struggles to fight him off.
Magnussen takes an apple. John takes nothing.
“Bless me father, for I have sinned,” John starts.
Sherlock, though not even touching Jonathan yet, attracts and repels his body like a magnet. And it’s sex, it’s dripping sex.
“Tch tch Rosamund. So impatient.” A familiar voice piped up from the dark corridor ahead of the aquarium room. Sherlock watched in horror as Jim Moriarty walked into the light and stood a little ahead of Mary, smirking at him.
“Apparently Lisa had a bit of a reputation for being possessive beyond a reasonable point.” Sherlock shrugged “Hence the act before. Lisa is a classic emotional predator, egoistic, narcissistic and vengeful. She feeds on vulnerability. I suspect Adam suffered the brunt of some emotional abuse as well before he finally left which she could not abide. Meretricious at the end.”
Jameela has no control over herself as much as she tries. Dr Watwe and Shanaya Hardikar are going to move in together !
"Yes."
It had to be in another life.
“Harry!” John shouted. “Jesus Harry, let it go already! I don’t understand why you keep bringing this up every fucking time!”
Sherlock stood in the aquarium as Mary Watson sat with her back to him watching the turtles.
“John my little one, didn’t you get the memo- we’re all Watsons! We’re all disasters of our own making. Let’s enjoy the descent into hell while we can”. Harry’s voice cackled as John hung up firmly.
Heat had spread inside John at the mere idea the other man could be there, just behind the wooden door, pleasuring himself.
Sherlock shifted and groaned, his eyes opening. John walked closer to the bed, so that they could look at each other without strain for Sherlock.
“Uhm…yes. I was just thinking…Why would he care about her fate? He despised her at the end. Won't even mention her by name, just 'The Woman'.”
He needed to do something about the situation, which meant talking to Sherlock about his feelings or finding a way to will them away. Maybe he could go out, spend an evening at the pub and charm a willing woman to have a shag with him. He usually didn’t go for one night stands, but needs must and he had not got laid in months. It was really difficult to find and keep a girlfriend when Sherlock’s work and demands ruined plans and dates four times out of five. He would need to make do with a casual encounter and maybe, when he would not be as sexually frustrated, he would stop lusting after his very male best friend.
John had fallen for him, hard. And he was frustrated because he didn’t know what to do.
John raised his head and took Sherlock’s lip in a kiss, which started sweet and chaste, but turned passionate as John opened his mouth to the seeking tongue probing against his lips.
Sherlock gave a curt nod. Everything to have Moriarty go away and free John.
John would start with the “pink lady” case, then move to the Chinese gang one and by the time he was done with them, he was rather sure something else would already have happened.
John was still smiling as they climbed the stairs toward the upper floor, but his merriment disappeared when he saw the body of a dead woman lying on the dusty floor.
Once inside, John closed the door shutting the world outside, and gave all of himself to the extraordinary man who was Sherlock Holmes, detective, vampire and the love of his life.
Lestrade picked the wallet, opened it and pulled out an ID. It was the victim’s.
One evening, while John was doing crosswords and Sherlock was pacing like a caged tiger, something which usually happened when he was bored, Mrs. Hudson stepped in the room with an open newspaper.
“Take them, John,” Mycroft Holmes urged. “Use them wisely. Protect Sherlock.”
Mycroft looked at him patiently and with a compassionate expression that didn’t bode anything good. “I’m sorry, but you know the law: all alphas must be bonded by their thirtieth year, otherwise they become too dangerous. I’ve managed to bend the rules in your behalf for the past four years, but this incident has tied my hands. You must bond to an Omega.”
“Of course you would never think of it. It’s just useless “sentiment”...” John let go of his shoulders, suddenly feeling exhausted and defeated. Whatever vague hopes he may have entertained to have a deeper relationship with Sherlock were shattered by the awareness the other man couldn’t grasp even the most basic meaning of caring for other people.
John’s eyes narrowed. “More than you know. I’m just one of them.”
“I just told you. Majors was killed because he was mistaken for a homeless and my network’s report confirmed my early hypothesis. There have been four murders among the homeless community in the past 50 days, five if we include Majors’. There is someone preying on homeless people and according to my calculations he should strike again soon. Maybe as soon as tonight or tomorrow,” Sherlock explained with a bored tone, as if he thought John was taking too long to understand.
Sherlock stopped and turned to stare at him, serious. “I most certainly did. Because I’ve come to know you. Unlike my brother, I didn’t need to test you to know you would come to help me, although I was expecting you to tackle or punch the guy. The shot was a delightful surprise.”
“Me too. Now come here.”
They had reached the building entry gate and a man wearing a forensic suit was coming out, a frown on his face.
It felt fantastic and John didn’t want it to ever end—but of course it was impossible. They were too excited to make it last.
“What...” his voice croaked. Sherlock cleared his throat and tried again. “What’s your name?”
John put on his dark jacket and left the flat. Once in the street he didn’t walk to the pub, but entered inside “Speedy’s” to buy a strong, hot coffee. He then crossed the street and hid behind a parked van, from where he had a good visual of 221B door. To avoid the suspicion of the passerby, he often looked at his watch and paced back and forth, to give the impression he was waiting for someone. It wasn’t far from the truth, as he was waiting for Sherlock to come out so he could follow him. He was not sure his friend would go out this night too, but he was hopeful and willing to wait for a long time if necessary.
Take Note:
John had told him once, tone warm and cheerful, the mirth in his eyes exposed by the crinkles of golden skin at the corners,
Mycroft noted the missing gun, John had dropped it somewhere between when he had last seen him and now. It would have been recently, there was no way that John in his right mind would have left behind his weapon, he was far to well trained for that. It pained him to see the normally resilient man so disoriented. Though outwardly Mycroft appeared as calm and collected, as usual, unruffled by the situation.
"Good." Sherlock hung up the phone, tossing it onto the couch and prowling towards John.
"I wouldn't underestimate him." Colt groused. Smart man.
to think clearly before those chasing him found John in such a weakened state. The primary goal was to locate his brother’s omega and bring him to safety. Which meant he needed to gain back access to the cameras.
“Hey, what’s wrong, you look…sad.” Sherlock blinked, sufficiently distracted from the pale expanse of John’s toes. Thinking about John’s words he supposed that was what the emotion was, sadness. Sadness over not having the one thing he truly ever craved. How could one miss somebody that was standing right in front of them?
John came with a sharp cry against Sherlock’s ear, seed spilling across his own belly, with it his scent exploding into vibrant hues. Sherlock watched the whole thing from hooded eyes, growling out his approval with animalistic ferocity.
Mycroft let go of the omega’s foot, checking the ferrule of his umbrella for any lingering blood. “Yes, quite the same. Size eight, do you agree Maeve?”
"Why would I do that? You handled yourself well enough." John declined, taking the stairs up to his room. The other man seemed to know all the weak spots on the steps and always avoided them. He did hear the upstairs door creak open and quiet rummaging. John returned holding a first aid kit, tossing it at Sherlock with a careless movement that still somehow showed off how easy it was for him to aim the thing.
The sight had Sherlock's heart racing with a combination of unrequited desire and utter terror. It settled for the latter. He felt himself pale and quickly had to look away from those succulent lips before his damn brain shut down entirely. Jerking his eyes up away from the flash of bright white teeth, he turned his gaze upward until his pale eyes connected with bright, inquisitive eyes.
“Mycroft, you fat arse! I know you’re in there, open up, or I’m going to tear this fucking door down!” John shouted. The sound of John’s fist banging on the opulent wood of Mycroft Holmes town-home was loud enough to wake the neighbors, but John hardly noticed. He knocked and knocked until his knuckles began to hurt. John didn't care if he woke up the whole neighborhood, he was going to be heard, dammit! With a grimace of frustration, he took to kicking at the varnished wood with the toe of his loafers. His fingers clenched into tight fists at his sides.
Sherlock choked, jerking his head back to scowl at the omega, with disdainful eyes. “Do try not to bring my brother in the bedroom. But yes, I’m sure the very idea would confound him.” John laughed, deep in his belly.
"Do you have this?" Sherlock asked, his voice dropping down into a low rumble of desire.
In the sudden, deadened stillness only the sound of John’s ragged, pained gasps filled the air. Sherlock dropped the knife, scrambling on hands and knees over to where John lie, crumbled in the wheat toned grass. His hand clutched weakly at the ruined mass of his throat.
"Aren't you going to complain about me being more careful?" Sherlock called after John's retreating back."
“Goddammit.” John ducked down, pressing against a newspaper bin until their line of sight turned away from him. Running across the street he narrowly avoided getting hit by a vehicle in his attempt to get away. Dodging the gleaming taxi he ignored shouts from the driver in favor of getting to the side of the intersection before the noise drew attention towards him.
John wrinkled his nose and chuckled against the other man’s lips, finally squinting one eye open enough to peer up into Sherlock’s mischievous eyes. They were blue today, like the morning sky. His mop of black hair tousled by last night's ministrations, and he looked positively edible.
Sherlock crawled onto the bed, spreading John’s legs and blanketing himself on top of the omega until they lined up hip to hip. They both gasped, eyes locking, as cock brushed against achingly hard cock. He dropped immediately to John’s lips, biting his lower lip until the older man opened his mouth with a throaty groan and let Sherlock in. They kiss long and slow, exploring each other with tongues that taste of brandy and hands that feel like fire on the skin, hot and achingly familiar, for all that they have never done this before. How many times had he imagined clutching his hands around the swell of John’s arse? The press of his fingertips against dark nipples. The touch of his tongue against the omega’s skin?
“Hey!” John shouted, and he wasn’t even thinking as he gave chase, breaking free from Mycroft to launch himself down the hall.
“You’ll need to bring a body bag. Two if you don’t get here on time.” He added, his lips pursing into an even thinner line as he eyed the downed omega, who was busy shrieking at the top of his lungs now, clutching his ruined knees in an attempt to stem the flow of blood. “There’s a bit of mess in the front hall and the sitting room.” John watched the puddle of blood as it steadily grew around the man with a critical eye. Taking a few steps forward he kicked the throw rug out of the way, Sherlock had picked it out with him last year, he’d hate to see it tossed in the bin due to staining. He couldn’t bring himself to care about the omega’s injuries, not when he smelled of dark t,errible things; death and violence.
He can see the difference between captors and captives just by the way they move. The captors are rough and aggressive, shoving and pushing, shouting indistinct orders to each other from across the way. Whereas the captives exhibit symptoms of illness and pain, swaying in line, no visible fight in them. The rain obscures their scents, but Sherlock imagines that if he was able to get closer he’d catch that same whiff of rot and decay that he’d smelled on August the day before. He has already concluded that they will lack the scent of their secondary gender, just like August had.
Lestrade raised an eyebrow of his own. “That’s what I have detectives for.” He reminded, and Mycroft snorts under his breath, remembering when he had told John that same thing only a bit ago. “ Donovan and Anderson are there now.”
Sherlock arched an eyebrow in return, a dark, sad look twisting his features as he shook his head. It was the same look John had been treated to the night before, moments before they'd taken this surprising next step in their relationship.
“I just woke up, John. It’s hardly the time.” Sherlock protested with a roll of his eyes, but he doesn’t seem to mind the compliment otherwise. Instead, moving to dig the bed covers out and away from where John had tucked them around himself during the night.
John swallowed hard, his Adam's-apple bobbing against the sharp constraint of Mycroft’s palm. “No, no, we don’t.” He managed, sagging against Mycroft's taller form and accepting the strength he offered, if only for a moment. The fact that he could even be comforted at all by Mycroft's presence was unanticipated.
“Yes, well, it’s a little late for that. I’ve taken care of it.” John snapped, glancing at the two downed assailants.
-Poor John is most defiantly suffering from PTSD, the struggle is real
“Again?! You’re going to run me to the ground you beast.”
Sherlock turned his head up, neck extending to brush his lips against John's chin. "Not just me, us." He explained against the stubble of John's chin, taking a moment to breathe in their combined scent on John's neck. John sighed, turning his head down to press a return kiss to Sherlock's lips.
John sat up next to him, reaching for his hand once more, any of his own discomfort forgotten. “Well, at least let me disinfect this,” His lips pursed, eyes examining the wound with a practiced physician’s eye. Sherlock rolled his eyes, but didn’t say anything as John slid out the bed. When the other man put on his doctor's face there was no getting through to him. He was already out the door before Sherlock had a chance to protest. The tables were turned as Sherlock got a peek at sticky, love bitten thighs. John wore the marks of his fingerprints on his hips with elegance. Sherlock eyed those marks, a smirk lighting up his eyes.
"I'm saying you can put a bullet between his eyes if you like, but it'd be a right waste if this boy ended up being our first case of immunity to the virus." She snapped.
“John?! Mycroft has a break in the case!” His excitement is contagious, and John peers out from his pillows, a grin chasing the edge of his lips.
Blinking through tearing eyes, he caught the sound of hard-soled shoes coming from outside, followed by a man and an elderly looking woman. The man, Eddington, he would assume, was still wearing those dark blue trousers from earlier. He took in the scene with a grim sort of detachment, his eyes only pausing for a moment on Brody's disfigured form.
(See the end of the chapter for
John wrinkled his nose as their combined fluid's spilled free, and that blush on his chest turned even brighter. The smell of
“Not this time,” Mycroft admitted, voice solemn and filled with sadness, the way his fist clenched speaking volumes for how saying those words affected him. John felt another tear spill down his cheek and caught it with his hand before it had the chance to fall.
Sherlock thought pale eyes flashed over the trash-strewn floor. Despite his feelings he felt something draw him deep into the building. A sound, or maybe a scuttle of movement deep in its recesses caught his attention. Torch light at his side he peered from room to room, searching for something, anything.
"Christ Sherlock, lie down and stop looking at me like that," John growled, opening one eye to glower up at Sherlock's features.
Sebastian rubbed a shaking hand over his face, moaning. "They…they-I heard yelling and fighting. I was so scared! So I hid." He explained, too distressed to get much out through the chattering of his teeth.
Blue like John’s eyes.
"Yes, darling, I think so." Pressing a kiss to John's lips, he shifted up to his elbows, disconnecting from the other man enough to put some space between them. Stroking the soft skin of John's belly, he could feel the slowly deflating swell of his knot. "Are you uncomfortable?"
"John?!" He moaned the omega's name, the one word evoking all the aching need and watery emotions that he'd been feeling all night. Desperate for more, Sherlock slid his palm along John's jaw and back to cup the swell of John's neck. The hairs at the back of John's neck were damp from his shower, soft to the touch. Sherlock growled his approval as the older man stumbled backward until he leaned against the table again. John tilted his head, and their tongues met with an eager curl of muscle on muscle, pressing and tangling together in gasping hot breaths. John tasted of garlic and peppers, the heat of whatever he'd eaten transferring to Sherlock's lips in tantalizing sparks. His lips were warm and enthusiastic. Like nothing Sherlock could have ever imagined.
"God, I hope so."
- Our mysterious interloper from the warehouse is also the omega that tried to kill John!
Painfully so.
"So, how'd it go, any breaks in the case?" He questioned, popping a small morsel of something in his mouth as he spoke. His tongue darted out to lap at his thumb. Sherlock watched the little peek of pink flesh dip out of John's lips before slipping back inside the hollow of his mouth.
“Get a taxi John, get a taxi and I’ll meet you at the safe-house,” Mycroft’s was grim, sharp and commanding. It helped, breaking through that fogged, sickening sensation that came along with someone violating him in such away. “I’ll carry you up the steps myself.”
Sherlock thought, a thrill of excitement making the hairs on his neck stand up. He did so love the chase. Overhead lightning zinged across the sky, thunder crashed, ringing in Sherlock’s ears. The rain picked up, sleeting out of the sky in heavy droughts. Through the sudden onslaught Sherlock completely missed the sound of the cab door opening behind him. He only became aware of the other alpha’s presence when the man stepped up next to him. Sherlock sighed, rolling his eyes and turning to face the alpha with a raised brow.
Warm sweetness surrounded him, tight and eagerly sucking at his length with twitches of muscle.
Instead, he took a calm step forward. "I won't hurt you. Can you tell me your name?" Slowly he walked towards the lone figure, hands up in an attempt to show he was no threat. The omega shuffled at the sound of his voice, squeezing himself tighter into the corner of the wall he hid against.
“Yes, well we’ve already established I am, in fact, human. Why don’t you focus on getting that taxi.” Mycroft urged.
“John.” The beta's lips pursed into a thin line as he glared down his nose at the shorter man. Those grim, sharp, eyes took in the street behind John's frame, glancing furtively first left, then right, before he returned his gaze to John's with a put upon sigh. “Alright then, come in before you go rousing Mrs. Lewis.” He commanded, pushing his door open wider and taking a step back to allow John entry. John took the offer, slipping past the other man and into the entryway with only a cursory glance at the lavish decorations. He had the presence of mind to scuff his shoes against the entryway carpet, unable to put aside his mother's manners. Adjusting the waist of his jumper where it had rucked up, he turned back to Mycroft, waiting for the other man to finish setting the locks before being lead to a green-toned parlor. John glanced around at the unfamiliar territory, scowling at the hung artwork and grandiose decorations. Mycroft had none of his brother’s wayward style. Everything was too proper. To in its place. He should have double-checked his shoes at the door; he was probably tracking all of London across Mycroft’s thousand-dollar wool rug.
Jameela kicked herself mentally and switched on the light in the backroom.
Jameela was a doctor so this was done voluntarily and not as a dare or prank of some sorts. The tattoo had meaning since she needed to take time out. It had taken a long while so it was someone she knew , someone she trusted with her body.
"After I spoke to you, an hour later I received that bloody package , this time it was addressed to me. I tore it open and I saw the sari, and I saw nothing truly out of the ordinary, nothing to be afraid of as such. But when my wife snuck into the forest in the dead of night to bury it . I knew there was something wrong".
John rushed backstage and left the guitar in Greg’s hands who had come backstage during the song.
Maanav laughed and said “Oh God no. we’re still tiny and underpaid as hell. Actually, something strange happened. We were going to do this in the usual place as we do all our formal stuff. In that tiny wedding hall near that sweet shop and give everyone samosas and chips. But we got a call two days ago by some hot shot sounding voice on the other end who said she would get us a better and bigger place and give us catering too free of charge”.
Jameela strained to look up to the intense brown eyed woman who held out the measuring tape and said “ Shall we?”
Her shoulder was hurting as she handed over the money to the driver and walked up to her little one bedroom apartment.
“Yes, in that time, you’ve seen the back area and now you’re moving in together. Might I expect an elopement soon?” The woman said
John gripped the chain hard as he thought about how easy it was for James to let go. How easy it was for James to walk away. From him- from them.
Almost as if it were a command Jameela raised her arms and Shanaya briskly but not roughly put the measuring tape around her stomach. “ Soooo. Are you not going to write these down?” Jameela said as she frantically tried not to get goosebumps at her touch.
Jameela frowned almost incredulously “Is that it?”
I gathered. A young man came stomping down this road yesterday muttering about a “psycho bitch” and her stupid shop.Somehow I didn’t think he was talking about
“No. That was their one condition. We don’t try and “be smart”. I guessed they don’t want us to know. As long as it’s not a terrorist or something, hopefully we should be okay.” Maanav shrugged.
I was married. For 10 years. It wasn’t.. Good.
Because saying you were discharged because you had an affair with a superior officer would not go down well , I think.
SHERLOCK stopped, breathing heavily as she tried not to look at JOHN. John schooled in her expression as she heard her heart shatter in pieces.
"Why would he call you? You're not ..." Jameela trailed off
“Oh yeah. My assignment partner is friends with the violinist. She insisted we go to see him.” “I think she has a thing for him” Lisa mock whispered.
She sat down on the table and looked around at the barely furnished apartment that had somehow now become even more oppressive.
“I was talking to a girl named Shreya last night Sally”. John said nonchalantly as he observed the others surreptitiously.
But the woman had already picked up her briefcase and started walking away from her towards the door “Tell Shanaya she is always near the enemy however far she tries to go”.
What do you guys think?? Pick your favourite ! Or disagree with me vehemently and tell me who would be better as our Jameela/John
“Sherlock!” Lisa exclaimed “That was amazing, really beautiful”.
God, she wanted to smoke. This was tedious.
“My clinic is just opposite of here. My wife swears by this shop. But be warned, she said that you won’t get what you want necessarily, but you’ll definitely
"Oh!" Jameela pursed her lips, as she struggled to find something else to say.
Translation-
Jameela looked at the paper, and looked at Shanaya muttering under her breath about incompetent boys who will die from slipping on a banana peel because they’re such idiots “I don’t mind”. Jameela said out loud before she could think otherwise.
maanglik naam- unlucky name.
“Someone call the coach.”
And their first step had already succeeded.
Jameela paused her frantic speed for a second and looked at the trunk and the etchings.
The next day, as Jameela walked down to the supermarket in the society, she heard a voice calling out her name.
The figure atop the hill took a running start and cannonballed over the edge to the pool below. John stared in awe as SHERLOCK made a whooping sound as she came down to the pool below the hill.
This was the end of their story. The man who loved but was afraid to say, the man who loved but never knew he was loved equally.
No, parents, heirloom most likely going by the 25 year old design with a slight frayed edge and a couple of threads coming out from the bottom ). Shanaya grimaced at the bright fake smile belied by the wrinkled forehead and the stormy eyes, clearly fighting with her husband?? No the husband doesn’t look especially pissed.
The locker room was completely ransacked. Clothes and wallets were strewn all over the ground.
John looks up at SHERLOCK with shock and a little dawning hope.
“Isn’t your brother getting a divorce?” Mike asked.
“He’s a first-year Tara. That’s almost cradle robbing, ugh”.
"Nope." Jameela replied curtly as she walked towards the gate.
“Actually would you mind? There’s a registrar office ten minutes from here. Mycroft can make the arrangements, I’m sure.”
thing.
Or at least what was supposed to be one. The table had been covered with a sewing machine , mounds of paper with half finished designs on it with cloth and threads. Half crumpled papers were strewn about the floor and thread rolls were rolling down from the table , hanging on for dear life . Chemicals bubbled away energetically on the far side of the table in a set of test tubes. Jameela was pretty sure that was not fabric dye .
Shanaya scrambled for her phone lying a few feet away from her on the carpet and checked her email.
Jameela clenched her fist momentarily and looked at the bunch of letters lying innocuously. How could she be that lucky?
Jameela followed the man hurriedly muttering frantically “Damnit Harsha, what the hell did you do now? Isn’t Clara supposed to be doing this?”
Jameela picked it up and gazed at it.  Tiny little thing, a circular silver medal with the national emblem fitted to a ring on a white ribbon with a red middle and lines running through it. But somehow it had seemed so heavy and final at the time that she had to control herself from buckling as they pinned it on her.
She was the damn army doctor here.  Also as her nana used to say, retired was just a state of mind.
Jameela’s fists clenched as her temper flared “You-
Jameela find out how Shanaya knows so much about her. There's also touching and not blushing going on.
She stood near the trunk , waiting for the driver to open it from inside as the assistant? lady sidled up next to her still tapping away on her phone.
“And I’m here why?” John asked , making a mental beeline for the bar.
You’ve thought something was there before, how did that turn out? That insidious voice piped up again.
The drawing room was small with two red armchairs side by side a cream colored sofa facing a small flatscreen TV. As Shanaya huffed and started arguing with Mrs Hanglem about "proper time to sleep" Jameela wandered into the dining room.
The next day, an annoyed and grumpy John stood with his hands in his pockets on the spectator’s end of the rugby pitch as rain poured down.
“That was the most…ridiculous thing I’ve ever done.” John panted.
She looked up “Maanav can I borrow your phone? My battery’s run out”
John closed his eyes, trying to tamp down the frustration and anger he felt whenever Harry raised this subject “I did okay? And he didn’t. Not as much and so he went away. If you’re done reminding me of the worst moment of my life Harry, I would like to get back to my team”.
Jameela tapped her feet and looked down at the sari. She didn’t know her elbow from her bum about saris, but when she looked in the mirror this evening, she had to say she looked pretty damn good.
“John about-

Biology tells us that we have evolved from monkeys. Apparently, Anderson’s genetic ancestors were very stupid monkeys.

“Oh yeah” The woman went back to typing on his phone.

“We're a couple, James and I”, Sarah adds, smiling. “I'm Millie Hopper, and Herlock Sholmes used to stalk James when he was on the rugby field. That's how we're supposed to know him.”
Sherlock is unimpressed. “Do you know any good laundromats around here?”
“Why not each direct a group of queens?” Miley suggests.
He gestures to - well, his usual body behind him. “This is a student doctor, Sherlock Holmes.”
John's fingertips float above his laptop keyboard, like a hanging question. He peers from the kitchen table to Sherlock, who's stretched out on the sofa, immersed in a book.
. The sight before him is breathtaking.
I'm somewhere between proud and sad, because this was the last chapter :( A special thank you goes out to my brilliant gf, without whom this fic wouldn’t exist. And of course a huge thank you from the bottom of my heart to you, readers. You‘ve been absolutely amazing.
“Most parents wouldn’t call a day at the zoo
He’s doing this for Sherlock, anyway. Molly threatened to never allow Sherlock into her lab again, unless John agreed to let her sign him up for ‘Queer Eye’.
“Well, I’ve examined the body and...”
“Can’t I just call in sick while we work this little problem out?” Sherlock asks.
Jonathan is already trying on John’s favorite Christmas jumper, crunches it up to his navel, then dashes out the room.
Sherlock’s lip curls slightly. John mirrors his smile. It’s a relief. They’re still them.
Mycroft begrudgingly leads them a little further, to a small table with a suitcase on it. Q opens it.
John is just about to delve into two lovely smelling scones in the Landmark’s restaurant area, when Sherlock pops down in the seat across from him.
“Yes.” They move gracefully in a circle, touching hands now.
In the evening, there’s a rose ceremony. Wilson decides to keep John (“I haven’t gotten a chance to get to know you yet”) and sends Jonathan Smalls home (“You

She eyes the judging table in front of her, the not very-well lit Katya, Trixie, Ru, Michelle and Brooke. Time to plead her case.
“That’s my name,” John admits, smiling.
Sherlock’s breath hitches. He can’t be serious?
“Fuck,” John says, as an orgasm overtakes him as well. John keeps jerking them both through their aftershocks - have those always felt this intense? - while Sherlock shakingly holds onto his shoulders. He grunts. It’s John,
Sherlock lets his coat dramatically flap in the wind that escapes through the entrance door, chin high and curls loose.
Sarah returns with the coats, and hands Sherlock his Belstaff. It wakes him up from his stupor, and with trembling hands he takes it, gets up, and tentatively puts a hand on John's shoulder.
“I’ve been in here since they filmed season 11,” Shangela says. “I was ready to take down that fake-ass Queen of the North Brooke Lynn but the lid got stuck. Bitches, you know I
“John, you are amazing, you are brilliant!” Sherlock shouts, giddy with joy. “That’s not a phone number, those are geographic coordinates.”
Lestrade’s words echo through the studio.
John gathers his courage and walks to one of the doors. “You ready, agent 0028?” he asks, opening it.
“What's there for me to do? I'm supposed to be dead”, he sulks.
John deals with his dad's homophobia. And dishes out some hard truths.
“John,” he breathes, as they both stumble into the hotel room. “John John John. John. Watson.”
He waits patiently for her to finish all her puns.
“Don’t mind her, she hasn’t slept much,” Alaska says dryly.
“Fuck!” he says in frustration.
It is everything and more.

They listen.
“Christ, erm. My teenage years, I suppose. Yeah.”
“She’s not your housekeeper.”
Together, they listen to the song until they fall asleep.
Finally, John speaks.
“And your name is…” the model-like woman asks with a breathy voice.
“Exactly!” Mycroft says. “You didn’t get an e-vite.”
John unscrews the top and sniffs it. “Lavender,” he says, as if that’s supposed to mean something.
He rolls up his sleeve. On his arm, there are numbers and letters in smeared red lipstick: 52°22’N 4°54’E.
Of course. Even her gun would be sexy.
It's a small, silver bullet.

Brooke Lynn lets the music play. She has been teaching them some sort of ball-style routine. She says the old-fashioned ballroom style will “contrast nicely with the modern dance song”, which she’s slowed down for their particular dance. It is, She-lock must admit, a rather creative idea.
In the corner of his eye, Sherlock notices John frowning, although he is really definitely ignoring him.
-Miss Fame: a very lovable queen with frequent head(ache) problems
“Yes, well. My body sometimes expresses a need and I answer it, but there’s no point in dragging it out.”
He removes his finger, and puts his hand on Sherlock’s side. It feels heartbreakingly warm.
Thanks a thousand times to my beta 88thparallel. Her suggestions have made this a better story and I'm forever in her debt.
“You haven’t disposed of any of his belongings.”
“They’re my roommate Sherlock’s,” John says.
John swallows. “It has healed rather well.”

Nice? John curses. What’s his vocabulary turned to? Is this his PTSD acting up?
in the world. There’s a miserable chip shop at the end. He eats there often.
“Why the hell not, John?”
“Good?” Sherlock asks, rubbing circles around John’s scar with his thumb.
John moves his other hand to Sherlock’s, still laying between them. As if nothing matters more in the world, he hooks their fingers together. Immediately, Sherlock clamps down on it, moaning, still pumping his hips. He’s fucking himself on John’s finger, and John nearly explodes untouched.
“Is this…” John pants, “The right time to fix your aesthetic?”
She-lock grimaces. “You know how drag queens sometimes wear very tight clothes…”

Even John snaps his head up.

“What’s this about, then?”

“Yes, like Michelle Visage. She’s been behaving quite oddly this season, too. Usually, during filming she’d come talk to drag queens behind the scenes. But now we only see her during judging. Not even in proper lighting. And she seems very negative. Poor Adore, that first episode.
But Mary slowly gets up and stretches her limbs, cracks her neck amusedly.
“A double agent, John? Really?” Sherlock says sceptically. “Going out on a limb there?”
“Is there something on my face?”
She glares. No appreciation for puns. Pity.
Sherlock can’t help it. He’s positively rutting against the wall now, pushing his hips forward wantingly. But how could he blame anyone but John? This is
“Is this what it’s like to be short?”
Sherlock strokes his tongue up and down, all the while keeping his warm mouth on John’s balls, alternating between left and right. He’s trying out different paces, broad strokes, harder pushes, all while glancing up at John, as if he’s inwardly making notes about John’s grunts, breaths, and other indicators.
“I just wanted to apologise.”
Miley, who appears to have gotten instructions through her earpiece, pushes them apart once more. “Alright, alright. You’re both fired!”
John takes off his jacket and drapes it over his chair. Sherlock remains fully dressed.
“Sherlock, I know that’s what you think but… sex can have unexpected emotional consequences.”
“Oh no, these are just to practise, like learning how to ride a bicycle with training wheels. I’ve got some ten inch ones waiting for you, darling.”
of the young man with John Watson’s face.
Outside, the clatter of feet on the stairwell had Sherlock jerking his attention away from the omega.
"How could that be possible? He was a captive." Well, at least Lestrade didn't shut down the idea immediately.
Hours later Sherlock took the steps from New Scotland Yard two at a time, his long legs taking him into the darkened twilight of Westminster. After the stagnant warmth of the police headquarters the city air was almost refreshing. It’d been hours since he’d found August and called the ambulance. He did so hate giving police reports. A missing person, no matter how sickly, did not fall under Lestrade’s division, so he hadn’t been able to shove the paperwork off on the detective. Needless to say it had been tedious and terribly dull, doting his I’s and crossing his T’s. Unfortunately, absolutely none of it had distracted his mind from the horrible sight
The heel of his foot dug into the curve of Sherlock’s shoulder blades when Sherlock slid the swell of his thumb into the entrance of John’s channel.
Mycroft is a tough nugget to write. I needed to give him all of the emotions, without any of the visible proof. He’s a study in masks really. Along with that I really wanted to give the poor man a purpose. We never really find out what he does exactly, he’s a shadow figure, who just sort of appears to solve or cause chaos. (I’ve never watched the last season, so perhaps my opinions aren’t complete) Either way, given the route this story is heading, he needs a bit more character. I’ve assigned him the “techy” guy position, but with more power and say so. I like the concept of him teaming up with our original duo sometime in the future, much like he did would John, and just helping them kick butt!
“I’m saying he’s missing John. He’s missing, and we can not find him.” To hear those words come out of a Holmes brother's mouth was alarming; he'd never known the brothers to give up or give in to pressure. Sherlock and Mycroft always had the answer. Where one failed, the other stepped in, making every problem a solution,
“24-year-old August Walker has been in a two month-long coma and is believed to be mentally unstable. If anyone has seen-” The droning background noise offered an oddly domestic background to what was a rather grim sight.
John remembered, clinging to the last memory he had of Sherlock. Maybe that was enough, they practically were a mated pair, in everything but sex. And alpha or no alpha, that didn't change the fact John craved the comfort of home and more, importantly, of Sherlock. There was no home to turn to now, not when Sherlock was missing.
"As Anthea told you, there isn't much you can do," Mycroft explained. How could he not understand? It didn't matter of John sat on his arse all day while they figured out where Sherlock was. It didn't matter, because John just needed to know
"Right, well, he's got maybe an hour than before this one wears off." Came Jason's disappointed response. There was the sound of receding footsteps, followed by the door closing.
"Sherlock, I hope you're right about this." Lestrade expressed, his voice betraying his frustration.
"I'm old. Everyone's a boy to me." Tabitha snapped, slapping her gloved hand against Sherlock's injured leg. Sherlock shouted at the searing nerve pain.
Thinking rapidly he considered what Sherlock would say in such a situation. “Also, get a team out to that alley-way, call Lestrade in if you have too. Update him on the facts. I want anything that John left behind, I want that gun, if he left blood traces I want samples of it. If you can get any more camera footage, get it. Trace that cab number, see if we can find the owners.” All of those sounded like very Sherlock things to say, his brother would be proud, or maybe royally pissed, depending on his mood. Nodding his head he reached for the door and popped it open, stepping out into the early afternoon sun. Anthea passed him his umbrella and he murmured his thanks, taking the comforting object in hand.
“You promised a tenner too.” She groused from around a mouthful of crumbs, holding up one grubby hand. John chuckled and crouched down beside her. The waist of his khakis digging into his belly thanks to the new position.
motivation. Sherlock cursed his luck at not being in the position to get a good look, he would have liked to know the face of his enemy.
He soothed his curiosity, if only for the moment.
"Ain't much without your bulldog, are you?" She snarked, always had to try and get a jab in. John would be highly amused at being called a bulldog, though. Ugh, he was getting a migraine. This really wasn't how things were supposed to go!
From there everything had unraveled, a dark, dirty entanglement of medical experimentation and human trafficking. Or at least that is what Sherlock’s research had shown. The fact that Sherlock had up to this point, not found a single one of Eddington’s victims perhaps warranted the most concern. To his knowledge, no reports had surfaced mentioning botched kidnapping attempts. No families had come forward about their missing family members, because, for the most part Eddington took those people who wouldn’t be missed. The homeless and drug-addled, the ill and dying. Along with that an increase in unclaimed cadavers was never noted at the city morgue. If people knew, they weren’t talking or were dead and gone.
Cursing under his breath he tucked the phone in tight against his ear and shoulder and wiggled out onto the balcony, his wide-set shoulders only just making it past the window frame. His hand grasped onto the rusty metal of the fire escape with care. It creaked precariously under his weight but held. Compact as he was he didn’t need to crouch to make his way down the steps, instead taking them two at a time in a mad dash. His borrowed gun was clutched in one hand, cocked and at the ready. He glanced out, at the head of the alley, but could not see any signs of his new attackers. The metal steps rocked and swayed under his feet, far too precarious for his comfort. He thought it would be a ridiculously ironic end of he was killed by a poorly maintained fire-escape and not the armed men that were after him.
Colt was all business, kicking the gun from Sherlock's hand before taking hold of his hair and yanking him backward and away from the desk by the strands. His head hit the concrete with a resounding thump, and he groaned as the movement dragged his injured leg out from under him. He groaned as the world spun for a moment, vertigo.
Sherlock reached for the bottle of brandy on the nightstand on offered it to John, humming his approval as the omega took a moment to swallow down a gulp, lips pursing against the burn. His eyes were sex drunk without the additional alcohol and hazy with need. Sherlock could get used to this—John, bare, and undone, and so damn beautiful.
The thought rolls around and around in his head, a hot marble of molten metal that sears everything it touches. If John had been the one strapped down onto a gurney, keening that horrible omega cry, begging for help that could not be provided. What would he have done than? He supposed this might be what John talked about when he asked Sherlock to, “Show a bit of empathy.”
Pushing aside the moment of nostalgia, he moved over to the room’s only window. The early noon sun shone out into the damp alley that butted up between their flat and the one next to them. The fire-escape was close enough to touch, he just needed to get the window open. Sherlock’s window nook was covered in various odds and ends that blocked him from accessing it. With a clatter Sherlock’s books and a candlestick found their way to the ground. The sound was too loud for comfort.
“It’s him! Look!” John tries to show him, and he lifts the rose, but he’s so excited he found the vital clue that he drops it. Before he can pick it up, Sherlock halts him.
He reaches the soft fabric of the towel, and his fingertips slide a little further up, because of the oil just as much as because of sheer will. Sherlock is eerily quiet.
“That doesn’t mean we have to use them.”
“You done your homework, Mr. Holmes,” Wiggins says excitedly.
“Located the incriminating evidence in his bedroom. Do I need to spell everything out for you, John?”
John kisses Jonathan on the cheek.
But first, he has other business to attend to.
“You only get one chance to attend your own funeral. It’s modern ghosting.”
“Good luck, and don’t fuck it up,” Ru says, and walks away.
Sherlock quickly disrobes, down to his tight blue underwear, and puts his neatly folded clothes on a chair nearby.
What is this - an interrogation?
“Oh, I see,” Phi Phi smiles. “He wouldn’t touch you either, eh? Let me guess. You invited him to your room, and you tried to get trade? And he said no because he could smell the desperation on you?”
“Tell me what happened, Lestrade… Greg… mate,” John says.
“I mean… sexually.”
“Oh, I thought your lips were meant to look messy. They often do... Anyway, the world turns, nothing is ever new. Men are pigs.”
“You stole his birth certificate,” Mycroft says. “Knight. H4 to G6.”
When John steps into the entrance hall, he startles. There, on the coat rack, it hangs. The Belstaff. No. No, it can’t be. He shakes his head. It’s not real.
But in the past, he has had sex before, of course, outside of an actual relationship. Some of those women were his friends, too. Those friendships usually lasted past the physical aspect, or just withered because of his job in the army, with John always being abroad. Nothing to do with the sex. It was all fine.
John frowns. Why would Magnussen want that?
He gestures toward the struggling figure against the wall.
John stands a little straighter. Sherlock’s father is an older gentleman with grey hair, kind eyes, and frankly excellent taste in clothes. His suit and bow tie are something John would buy, himself, certainly.
He is perhaps a bit skinnier than Sherlock remembers, and the lines drawn in his face deeper, but there’s no mistaking it. As much as Sherlock wishes it wasn’t… it really is John Watson standing before him.
“For the last time, Todrick. Randomly voguing like a headless chicken is not dancing!”
How could John ever repay such a debt?
John glares. There’s nothing Sherlock can say, anyway. There’s just no way he’ll teach him
They walk on, stroll through the park. Eat ice cream. The two of them against the rest of the world, blood pumping through their veins, the thrill of the… rollercoasters.
Yet it feels almost illegal, the way his tongue finds a way to hers, scours the edges, lightly sucks and
“I can’t believe the others got to sit on a bed together, giggling in each other’s general direction, and I got dealt
“You are clear,” Mycroft announced against his ear, and John heaved a sigh of relief, throwing all his faith into Mycroft’s observational skills and dashing out of the alley. His feet skidded on the pavement beneath him as he dashed around the corner, taking a left and breaking into an all-out sprint to get away as fast as he could. He tucked his gun in tight against his side, shielding it from sight with his jacket.
I made a thing! Cover art is up on the first Chapter, take a look
“Very well, I will come by Baker Street tomorrow morning.”
On the bed, John swallowed, and for a moment, Sherlock caught a flicker of self-consciousness, a tremor of nerves that John hides behind the neck of the bottle of brandy as he brings it to his lips. Sherlock couldn't hold it against him. His own heartbeat is rattling in his chest like an excited bird in a cage. Sherlock tilted his head to the side, considering the sight before him. John's tan skin pairs well with the burgundy of Sherlock's duvet. Gold and garnet, and oh so-
Take Note:
A sudden weight landing on top of him sent the breath wheezing out from his lungs, and he choked back a laugh as he felt nothing but sharp elbows and knees digging into his belly and shoulders. Long fingers scrambled to slink the bedclothes from around John’s face. “I’m off, John,” Sherlock announced, his face peering into the hollow he’d created.

“Well and good, load him up, I want him out the door and to our facility before the police get their hands on him.”
John snorted his own blue eyes, wrinkling at the corners. “Get off with you than you, madman!” He commanded and just managed to swing a pillow at the detective’s retreating back, laughing when it tangled in Sherlock’s Belstaff.
