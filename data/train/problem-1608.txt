John was relieved to find Rosie sitting at the kitchen table working through what looked to be a math problem when he got home. She didn’t look up as he walked into the apartment and from the furrow of her brow John knew better than to interrupt. Shedding his coat by the door and dumping his bag on the floor, John decided the most important thing in that moment was to get the kettle boiling for some tea. After filling the kettle and getting it on the stove he turned around to face his daughter leaning against the counter behind him. ‘Hey, feeling any better?’ he asked casually but appraised her carefully.
‘I should have listened, I should have checked her over properly this morning.’ John ran his hands through his hair. Sherlock didn’t say anything. ‘I’m just so tired, work has been killing me, and now I just outright neglect my daughter and then project my inadequacy onto my husband.’ Tears burned John’s eyes. He let himself fall back into the seat and hang his head in his hands. A moment later he feels strong hands on his shoulders.
‘They gave me medicine, it helped a bit.’ Rosie let her head loll to the side against Sherlocks arm which was still holding the phone out for her.
‘Alright, try to get through this water but just take small sips okay?’ John moved the drink closer.
‘Yes.’ Sherlock responded with a smirk, John always was one to state the obvious. ‘How is Rosie?’ he asked softly.
With a sigh John headed to bed even though it was still fairly early he didn’t want to disturb Rosie by turning on the television.
‘Okay, I know.’ the young girl dismissed.
‘Probably, he drove us here.’

‘You okay?’ John asked, still firmly supporting her back, another hand grasping her elbow.
Oh god, I’ll be right there
Hi Sherlock, everything okay?
What’s wrong sweetie?
John couldn’t stall any longer, he had to take another patient. The quicker he got through these appointments the quicker he could get home, that should give him the motivation he needs to get through the day.
‘I just need to stop for a second.’
‘Can you be more specific?’ John’s voice remained gentle as he took a seat next to her. He sat patiently as he watched her try to take mental stock of what she was feeling.
‘Come on, why don’t you go upstairs and get changed out of your school uniform, then come back down and I’ll give you some pain killers and check your temperature. Sounds good?’John gave a reassuring squeeze of her arm as he stood. Rosie followed suit and rose, bringing a hand and pressing her palm to her forehead as she did, as she swayed slightly John reached out and placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. He frowned as concern began to grow, before he could think too much into it Rosie stepped away and made her way upstairs.
‘You need to take a break.’ Sherlock repeated, his voice serious.
‘Goodnight John.’
‘Oh yeah, that.’ Rosie turned and headed to her dad's bedroom. John followed her in, helping her under the covers. ‘I still feel kinda sick.’
‘Hey Rosie, I’m just going to step out and call papa okay?’ Sherlock stroked a hand over the girl’s forehead, she nodded slightly in response.
‘Hey.’ A low gruff voice pulled their attention from the phone. John rushed to the bedside, planting a kiss on Rosie’s head. ‘How are you feeling?’ Rosie just shrugged slightly in response, keeping her gaze on the phone.
I don’t feel well.
‘No thanks, I’m not hungry.’ she replied quietly, still slightly dazed.
‘She’s sick, fever, stomach ache, headache.’ John’s voice was barely more than a whisper, but the thoughts of his daughter seemed to rouse him quickly and once his brain caught up to the situation he lifted himself into a sitting position. ‘I need to check on her.’ he said as he started to pull back the blankets.
Okay. It’s fine.
‘It’s okay, let me help.’ Sherlock closed the distance between them in a single stride, he pulled open the hospital gown, presenting the arm hole. Rosie slowly unwrapped her bare arm and slid it through. Sherlock then pulled it across her body, to afford her some modesty, she wasn’t just a little girl anymore, before gently pulling her pajamas over her head and down her arm, avoiding any movement. Sherlock couldn’t help wondering if in moments like this Rosie wanted for a mother, for someone other than her dad to help her change. Then again, she seemed so miserable right now, that she probably couldn’t care less.
‘39.2 degrees, that's high.’ In the light of the fire Sherlock could see her flushed cheeks against her worryingly pale face. Sherlock found the medicine sitting on the kitchen table and took it back over to his daughter with some water. ‘Take these.’ he instructed, she complied, unwrapping her arms from the blanket, Sherlock helped her into a sitting position so she could take the pills. She groaned at the change of position.
‘I meant our bed sweetie.’ John added with a chuckle.
‘Yeah, it hurts.’ she breathed, bringing her arm back to wrap around her midsection.
‘Thanks, papa.’ Rosie said as she slowly let her eyes fall closed.
Sherlock was beginning to think John would not answer when the familiar sound of his husband's voice graced his ears.
John was sitting in the clinic between patients when he heard the familiar sound of a text notification, looking over to his phone he could see it was from Rosie, so immediately picked it up.
‘Here love.’ John placed the pillows at one end of the couch, Rosie gratefully laid her head down on them, swinging her legs up until she was curled up laying on her side. John then piled on her blankets before leaning down and planting a kiss on her forehead.
Chapter 3
‘Does your stomach still hurt?’ John pressed a cool hand to her forehead.
‘Try and get some more sleep, I’ll be nearby if you need anything.’ Sherlock took the water and helped Rosie back down and under the blankets.
‘Hi, sweet girl.’ Sherlock rose from his seat and knelt by the side of the couch. ‘How are you feeling?’
John sighed and nodded. ‘Yeah, I know.’ The two stood there for a moment, the silence broken by John’s yawn.
‘Yeah.’ Rosie wrapped her free hand around her abdomen as the thermometer gave a beep. ‘What’s it say?’
‘Okay,’ Rosie affirmed, but then rolled back onto her side, facing the back of the couch with her knees brought up to chest.’
When Mycroft saw them approaching he rushed over to the two them. “Can’t you to act like adults for once?”
“And that is Sherlock?”
“You didn’t have to defend me against him. I know I’ve done the best that I could.”
Sherlock took an obligatory sip and then passed it back. He had no time for drinking he needed to take the beanstalk down.
John quietly sat about starting his day. Grabbing clothes and shoes he went downstairs to have a shower and he was needing to get to the clinic and put in a leave of absence. He didn’t want to quit in case he and Sherlock’s working arrangements didn’t work out. Once dressed John grabbed his laptop opening it up while he sipped a cup of coffee. He knew Sherlock would want to review the surveillance together but he was getting ready to leave and he couldn’t do so with a clear mind until he'd made sure Moriarty hadn’t left any dangerous surprises behind.
“This needs to be done and I can’t help. It’ll be daylight in a couple hours.”
me because it was like he had no control of himself.”
Sherlock stopped struggling and stared at Alasdair, it was apparent he was struggling with himself. Something wasn't right.
“That’s right. I think,” Samantha looked up at Otaktay, “I think I am also making Otaktay’s dreams worse.”
“Oh, you know me, John, I’m against
John chuckled even though he couldn't see Sherlock’s face he could actually hear the pout he was sporting. Patting Sherlock’s hand he turned around. “I have to step out for about an hour, I wanted to make sure he hadn’t left any nasty surprises.”
John smiled at Sherlock’s request. As a doctor and his friend John hated when Sherlock took any sort of drugs be it mild like sleeping pills or more serious like heroin. He figured there was nothing wrong with placating his friend's sleepy request. “Sherlock.”
John settled in comfortably between his thighs, his back against Sherlock’s chest.
John lay there until their breathing evened out and he started to feel himself dry. Rolling off of Sherlock he asked if he wanted the shower first. “Ugh, yes. Thank you, although, my skin will be so dry from all of the showers and water fight today.” Sherlock sulked as he dragged himself to the bathroom to shower.
Sherlock noticed John wasn’t looking him in the eyes but at his mouth. “Sure.” After a moment, once John had gone back to cooking Sherlock asked, “How was the kiss, John? Was it-satisfactory?”
“I miss the man my husband used to be; I wish to reach him again. And John is family, the blood of my blood. I wish to be able to count him as such. And you as you are his chosen mate.” Fíona turned her gaze to John, “I suggest you take two vials.”
knowing what they are saying.”
Steeling himself for whatever he saw in John’s face he looked up at the blonde man. “Sorry about this,” he whispered.
John must have seen the change come over Sherlock for he said, "You know what, nevermind. I will call Lestrade and have him pick me up." John hopped off the wall and started walking away from Sherlock. He had no clue where he was but there had to be a road close by.
Coming back to himself, the first thing John became aware of was that Sherlock was still humming and holding him. John tapped Sherlock's leg, signalling for him to let him go.
John made his way downstairs quietly. He didn’t want to disturb Sherlock. For all he knew Sherlock could be up. It was a hard-won battle every night he woke up from a nightmare to not start drinking. He had noticed Sherlock had gotten rid of all the alcohol in the flat, so he
Sherlock clung to John as he buried himself repeatedly inside him brushing over his prostate, and stimulating his trapped cock all in one swell swoop. He clung to John even as he saw the change in him, he went from considerate lover to a man seeking refuge. Something was wrong.
“Yes, but he was hurting Sherlock, he was in the act of doing something wrong.”
John and Sherlock met Mycroft and the Holmeses father in the hallway as they were heading out to the great lawn. There was just now a lightening of the sky. Sherlock’s mother and Mrs. Hudson were already seated, John was surprised to see Mrs. Hudson seated in the area reserved for family. Of course he and Sherlock thought of her as family but he never thought Mycroft did. John and the Holmes men, stood in the back off to the side as the guest slowly filled up the seats. Finally the officiant took his place at the front. The last row people of the wedding party walked up. Lestrade and his father.
“I see why you keep him around Sherlock, his intellectual capabilities holds no equal. Meet me downstairs when you’ve
“Right, well the thing about a missing person case is a person isn’t missing until someone recognises them as such and reports it. So at this point, we only have one missing person, Major James Sholto. What do you two have to go on?”
“I took the beanstalk down several times before, each in a different way. The easiest by far was when heated the plant from the inside out. Basically rotting it on the inside and-”
“Morning.” Sherlock's voice was scratchy and heavy with sleep. “You couldn’t wait for me? I waited for you.”
The men marched back inside, Liam plopped down next to Samantha giving her his warmest and friendliest smile. “Okay, Little Miss Sunshine, what has O told you about us and the reason you are here?” Liam continued to beam at her and John fought not to laugh at his antics.
“Just you.”
John gave a small smile and shrugged.
“Going to put in your leave of absence?”
“Just myself and Mrs Hudson,” John answered seeing Sherlock was getting to the end of his rope. “And before you ask, Mrs Hudson isn’t in and we suggested that she stay away for the time being. Just in case.”
wedding. It makes sense the two of them getting married.
Sherlock shrugged, “His name literally means defender of man, he can’t be all that bad.”
Sherlock moaned loud pulling out of the kiss. Before he realised what he was saying he whispered, “Please John. Now.”
“Yes…”
“I don’t know, tall, thin, well dressed-”
“That is a very good point,” John stated looking to Sherlock. “We have the last say.”
“Well can’t you do that with Mansi?” Lachlan questioned.
John’s made a silent ‘Oh’ look.
“Bloody hell! How did you even know I was here?” Lestrade said as he stepped out.
Sherlock glanced at the phone to see who it was John had so desperately needed to reach.
This was nice, sitting all domestic like eating and chatting it up. Without putting too much thought into his actions Sherlock swung his feet up and placed them in John’s lap.
Sherlock frowned, truly baffled, “Why? I doubt Graham left it.”
“Everyone will think I have my papa's name. Like yours, Watson.”
Before Sherlock could answer someone called out, “Sherlock! Sherlock! Where are you, you bloody bastard?”
Sherlock lay where John had deposited him. He was tired and worn out. He watched through half closed eyes as John stormed into the bathroom. Sounds of John masturbating soon reached his ears. This was another first for them. They both always reached completion. Almost ten minutes later he heard John bellow his release. Sherlock smiled sleepily, his John was so sexy.
“Rayne?” Hyde prompted.
to have been affected. He is so far from human. Maybe, and this is just a maybe, maybe you were able to affect him, if you did, because you
The men frowned at one another over her head.
know I care about Otaktay, but I don't love him." John squeezed his hand, offering unspoken support and understanding. "With that being said, I do find my curiosity piqued about him sexually. Not because you aren't enough for me John. Simply because the seed has been planted and it has taken root."
She burrowed in under John's arms further. "Of course I am Sherlock, he admitted it."
“It’s like your subconscious is working in the background, when your self preservation trigger is tripped your subconscious analyzes the situation and whatever it is in you that causes these urges are initiated giving you the chance to get away. One more question about this, I think. What we were told about your kind is that you can cause desire or rage in others. We have only seen desire, why is that?”
Sherlock blinked twice, realising John had come over to him, there was a gentle concern in his eyes. "Yes, quite, why do you ask? I should be the one asking you if you're okay. It looks as if you have been left at the altar."
"Hm. Oh God," John said, pressing the heels of his hands to his eyes. "It's Christmas morning," he realised.
Sherlock could quite literally have kissed him right there. "Yes, right, that meeting about the-" Sherlock agreed briskly.
It turned out the club had several smaller rooms at its disposal. We were led into one which was appointed as a bedchamber. I recalled Shinwell Johnson's smirking hints at the purpose of these back-room hideouts, and suggested I would only have need of the wash basin in the corner to wipe away the few traces of our adventure.
The whole unfortunate affair was entirely my fault, of course. I should have known from the start that our natures were incompatible, but I deluded myself into believing that as I had passed the mark of two score years, my natural alpha drives and passions were no longer of consequence, or at least could be ignored in favor of such noble qualities as a temperate character, a firm and economic hand in running the household, and a generous indulgence of my running around with my pal Holmes, as she used to put it.
Sherlock doesn't move or say anything for several more seconds. John finally makes a questioning sound, as if checking whether Sherlock heard him.
John didn't know much about that period in Sherlock's life, just bits and pieces. He'd dropped out of university, lived on the streets for a while. An overdose that just missed being classified as a suicide attempt. Rehab. There were times when John wished he'd been around then, when he imagined he might have helped Sherlock. But then there were other, more sobering times when he took a good, hard look at his relationship with Harry and knew deep down that he wouldn't have stuck it out with Sherlock either. Not if Sherlock hadn't wanted to change. But he had wanted it, and he'd done it himself, and that couldn't be dismissed. Maybe it was something he'd needed to do himself, before he could save John. They had met when both were at a crossroads, both ready (or forced) to change direction. For better or worse. For gunshots and archenemies, for death and adventure and something he suspected was larger than either of them.
"My life," Sherlock explains. "It's not always kidnappings and shootings and running away from unstable criminal masterminds."
"It's just the rest of that tofu lasagna," Sherlock said. "It'll be about ten more minutes."
“What?” Sherlock's mind is vexingly distracted by the sensation of John's hand under his. It's a struggle not to let his thumb caress the back of John's wrist.
, Sherlock reminded himself.
"Making sure your dad wasn't showing me your baby pictures, you mean," John teased.
"It's this or make everyone wait, which will make them think we're having sex anyway. Might as well actually have sex, it's a win-win," Sherlock said, sounding smug.
"I wouldn't have left without you," she says as she starts transferring clothes from the closet to her own suitcase.
"And now," John says, "tell me the plan."
John nodded and made a note. "He's a great dancer. Zach should definitely be in." He looked down at the photos. "What about Matt?"
"Holmes, please," I pleaded, not knowing what to ask for. I wanted him to continue, yet I wanted something else, too, something more.
"No, I'm not... I can't..." Tristram flounders for a way to convince Irene and John that he can't leave.
John nodded. His mouth did that thing where the corners turned down to indicate he'd heard and acknowledged the statement. It made him look unnecessarily grim.
John kept glancing at the front table, glancing at Sherlock. A nod now and then, a quick smile. Checking that Sherlock wasn't going to blurt out any more sex-in-the-morgue stories (and he did have several). Or maybe remembering. Was he also comparing everything to his (and Mary's) wedding? The cake, the wines, the colour scheme, the weather, the music. There was a three-piece local band -- friends of Jeremy's -- getting set up for the dancing to follow. Keyboard, guitar, and bass, with the keyboardist and guitar player collaborating on the vocals.
"It's actually faintly ridiculous," Sherlock pants. "All this fuss for a bit of ... vascular dilation."
Friday night was the Blackwood School's Nativity. Sherlock wasn't planning on going, but somehow his evening walk with Gladstone took him in that direction, and shortly after seven they were standing in front of the pink stone structure. Sherlock left the dog tied to a tree and went inside. The posters on the doors and plastering the halls advertised 'James Moriarty's Herod: A Christmas Tale'. Appropriate. Moriarty always had fancied himself some sort of monarch.
"A murder, John," Sherlock said, his eyes sparkling. He craned his neck to get a better view of the road and make sure the driver was taking the most direct route. They might even get there before Dimmock, which would make things immensely easier.
"Cool," Emily says. "And what about these?" She moves to a wooden display box topped with glass, containing lots of small, ornate containers.
He doesn't really listen to her story about being there to do some work for Magnussen either because he's just realised he's sitting at a dark booth in a hotel bar in the city he lives in with a woman who's not his wife, and he's not wearing his wedding ring.
"First scrub any mention of you or Irene and then hold it over Mycroft's head for favours."
Sally peered through the teachers' lounge full of staff members drinking, chatting, even attempting to dance to a CD of Christmas songs someone had popped in to lend the party some holiday spirit.
with whom I have been reunited." My name on his lips, usually only uttered in moments of deepest privacy, breathed into my mouth, whispered against my nape, spilling across his tongue in tandem with his release spilling across mine. His words confused and delighted me, but I had long since learned that there was little profit in attempting to cross emotion with logic. I felt as if I were ascending even as I fell into a place from which there could be no rescue. Whether pit or haven was not mine to tell.
"I presume you and Mycroft have a plan."
"No, I'm coming," he says. "If that's all right? I'm not family-"
"No," John ordered, now pointing his finger at Sherlock. "No, don't you do that. You and your mind games. I may not be clever like you, I may not be able to see the things that you see, but I see something in you. I know I do. Maybe there is more to this whole thing, maybe something happened between you and this Moriarty in the past, but whatever that was, it doesn't change the fact that at least part of you cares about this project for its own sake. You may not want to admit it, but you like those kids and want them to succeed. Some of them, anyway," he qualified.
"Sorry?" John said.
It was quite possibly the last thing I might have imagined he would say. Presently, I came to my senses enough to become aware that I was still holding the thing. I had unwittingly crushed it in my fist, so great was my contempt for what it signified. And now my closest friend was asking me to take on its burden and - if I understood correctly, and I was certain I did - to submit myself to whatever punishment, pain, exposure, and humiliation it held in store.
"What do you mean?"
John is still waiting for an answer. Tristram doesn't see what the point is of talking about it. It's over now. It was stupid - just like the thing with the curtain. He knows what John will say, anyway: the man out on the street wasn't Mister Tonga. Mister Tonga is in jail in England. And there wasn't anyone standing up behind any of those windows with a gun either. He knows all that. He knows it now, and he knew it when he was outside, too. That didn't stop his stupid heart from getting all scrambled and his stupid throat from cutting off his air supply.
"Sherlock, you-" Doctor Watson looks at Emily and Tristram. It's clear he has something to say that he doesn't want them to hear. "Would you two please go into the bedroom? Just for a minute." His voice is tight and high, like it's an effort for him not to yell.
"My father slept on the couch," Tristram announces, just so there's no misunderstanding.
Sherlock has stopped texting, but holds his mobile loosely in one hand. He stares absently out the side window.
Father looks around until he spots Tristram. He says one more thing to the police officer, then comes over to the ambulance. He arrives just as Tristram's stretcher is being loaded in.
Sherlock took the picture. It was a posed shot, amateur, of a young woman, late teens or early twenties, leaning against a tree with her arms crossed. Only her head and torso were visible, but to judge by the clothes and hair, it had been taken ten to twelve years ago. The subject was unremarkable, round cheeks, bland smile, dimples. But then Sherlock hadn't thought much of Mary when he'd seen that first snapshot of her in the manila folder in Mycroft's office. Victor's wife would have several pounds more on her frame by now, of course. Crow's feet starting. Maybe dying her hair to cover the creeping strands of white.
"Here, use mine." Irene picks up the little spoon lying on the saucer beside her espresso cup.
"What then?"
Tristram and Emily meet John and Irene as they come back inside, each clutching several postcards. The shop assistant is back behind the counter ringing up some other customers' purchases.
"Two minutes," Sherlock said, deftly working open the buttons and flies of John's trousers. "It'll be cutting it close, plus you're nervous which might delay things but the thrill of possibly being caught coupled with the emotions you're going through at the prospect of finally making our union official and permanent will likely work in our favour." Sherlock crouched down in front of John, his knees sticking out to the sides like a praying mantis.
"Well go on," John says impatiently. "What are you waiting for?"
Sherlock felt something touch his hand and looked down to see John's hand fumbling to get a grip on his where he held onto John's hip. His left hand. Not the one he'd had up John's arse, but still not exactly sanitary. John knew that, but did it anyway. Needed some sort of ridiculous reassurance, even now with the proof of Sherlock's attraction to him lodged firmly in his arse. Sherlock didn't see a need for verbal confessions or declarations; the fact was, he regularly exhibited clear evidence of physical and emotional attraction to John. Inexplicably, inconveniently, and constantly. If John was too unobservant to notice it, that wasn't Sherlock's problem.
Sherlock is already sitting at the desk, his hands hovering over the laptop as if it contains radioactive material. "We don't have his password."
John chuckled. "Not if that's what you're offering. God, what is it?" He reached over and picked up a jar up, sloshed the contents around, unscrewed the lid and took a whiff, then grimaced and held the jar at arm's length. "Please tell me this didn't at some point come out of Gladstone."
A prickly sensation crawled up Sherlock's neck. If he were really occupied, he'd have said with what.
Synopsis of "Cracks in the In-Between Places":
It was every bit as tedious as he'd expected. The christening alone had been enough to bring on a dull throbbing in his head, but then John insisted they attend the reception afterwards at the Stamfords' as well.
"Yes, as I said," John agreed. He didn't say it with a straight face, though, and their shared giggles drew the attention of a woman passing by (early sixties but tells people she's fifteen years younger, thinks the laughter's at her expense, on her way to something artsy-cultural, divorced at least twice, trip to the States within the past month). Even once they were past her, John kept grinning, which made Sherlock want to kiss him right there in the middle of the street, but instead he pretended he needed to check something on his mobile so he could pass John Gladstone's lead. If his fingers happened to brush the back of John's hand, no one need be the wiser. It was a weak substitute, but it served.
He and Father were planning on working together on reconstructing the pattern of which pieces of glass made which cuts based on Father's pictures once he got home. Now that's going to have to wait even longer. He wonders all of a sudden where the pieces of glass ever got to. Hopefully Father took them home and put them in a safe place before they had to leave.
But they weren't together, and didn't it turn out to be terribly convenient that she happened to be the one with his passport? So convenient that she must have known she was going to need it, and that she and Tristram wouldn't be with John when they crossed the border. Tristram didn't question the fact that there were tickets waiting for them at the check-in counter at the time, either; he was too busy trying very hard to concentrate on his breathing. There was no open gallery in Mulhouse like there had been at the London airport, but there were the same kind of luggage trolleys and the same smell of aircraft exhaust and too many people for Tristram to keep his eye on all of them. He managed, but he wasn't able to ungrit his teeth until they were seated on the plane and he got a headache almost immediately after takeoff.
"Oh, God, I didn't-" Doctor Watson takes the pictures and looks at them. His expression falters as he glances between Emily and Tristram. "I thought I pushed the button for one." He looks down at the pictures again.
"They're eating it!" he whispers happily.
John had been at it a couple of minutes now, and Sherlock had reached a kind of plateau, feeling very good but nothing that would herald an imminent climax. He squirmed his hips, trying to get just a little more stimulation, a little more pressure, to ratchet up the sensation.
5 large eggs, cracked into a jug
This takes place sometime between chapter 11 and 16 and is based on a prompt by ladyprydian on LJ, who wanted a staff Christmas party. Just a reminder, Nigel is the first name I gave to Anderson in this fic, which was posted before series 3 came out with the information about his real first name. ;)
Sherlock flutters his fingers dismissively and takes a step away. "It's my fault. It was an imposition on my part. I shouldn't have assumed you would go with him. You told me quite plainly you wanted to go home to your daughter, and I all but forced you-"
"He's taken a room in Swindon."
It was too much: John's arms, his body, his heart, his eyes. Here in the midst of all these strangers. Friends too, Greg and Molly. Maybe Alfred, Sanjay, Robby. So many. Too much to be contained. Was there a need to contain it any more? Sherlock closed his eyes, drew John those last few centimetres closer so that Sherlock's cheek rested against the side of his head. The smell of his hair, of his perspiration, of the fusion of his aftershave with his own particular chemistry. John's ear just by his mouth. His lips. John's breath on his neck. His nose nudging Sherlock's jaw. His arms encircling Sherlock, squeezing gently, hugging him. Their feet were barely moving. Sherlock wasn't even sure they were moving in time with the music. The moment floated in time, detached from the here and now. Filling drawers, entire filing cabinets, every available nook and cranny in Sherlock's head, and heart. Eternity in the length of a song.
A knock sounded at the door of the vestry where they were cooling their heels until the guests were all seated. "Five minutes, guys!" Greg's voice called though the door.
Somehow they made it out without being waylaid. Sherlock saw Moran talking to the mayor, but there wasn't anything he could do about that now. In fact, it might work out to their benefit if Moran told him something that caused him to rescind his offer.
going to be a lot of work, Sherlock. It's not done with learning the songs. There are the costumes, the sets-"
I did. Of course I did. I had lived it, and felt it in my soul. We had been confrères, intimate friends; but in the eyes of the world we could never be more. Two men might share rooms, food, tobacco, adventures, illness, laughter, perils, breath, each other's bodies, but they could never be to each other what a man and woman might, given the blessing of a parson or priest. Not even if their souls could only be fulfilled in each other's arms and their destinies at each other's sides. I understood.
For some reason, though, he doesn't want to row with Sherlock in front of Janine. Doesn't want her to think he isn't fully informed about what's going on. And the worst one: doesn't want Sherlock to lose face either.
Sherlock slowly returned to his living room. He was stretched out on his back on the sofa, one foot on the ground. John was lying between his legs, his elbows braced on either side of Sherlock's hips and his chin hovering over the waistband of Sherlock's trousers. He was bare on top as well - when had he taken his shirt and his vest off? Surely Sherlock should have noticed that. John dipped his head to touch his nose to the swollen length inside Sherlock's trousers.
The frenzy subsided and the pupils shuffled around, taking their seats. John shared a conspiratorial look with some of the children near him and threw one more aeroplane, hitting a boy smack in the back of the head. The class broke out in laughter.
When he got to the cafe, John was already there with a cup in front of him. He was freshly shaven, so he'd been at home when he'd received Sherlock's text. He'd taken a cab, though, so he hadn't left immediately. In fact, he must have taken the extra time - and calculated in the extra expense - to appear clean and looking well. Sherlock sat down across the table from him, trying not to smile too broadly.
Tristram nods. "Fine."
%%%%%%
Tristram turns his arm back over and the message is hidden.
John flicks his eyes up to Sherlock's face, irritated because he already told Sherlock why Janine was here. "She said she was picking up some information from someone."
John turned his attention back to the bundle. Whatever was inside was rigid yet light. Possibly some kind of bone with a particularly odd deformation, or a stone with the image of a plant or shell embedded in it. Sherlock often brought back little oddities like that from his ramblings through the countryside, full of theories as to where they came from or what they might be, but he didn't usually wrap them up with such care, and he definitely never acted so secretive and shy about them.
"And when you say he wants you, that means exactly..."
Sherlock pushes past him into the house. "Get your things."
"Oh, I know you're beyond anything as boring as rules," Moriarty says. There's a thrumming excitement in his voice as he speaks. "It's why I let you do things for me. But it's the principle of the thing, you see?"
Mycroft makes an unhappy sound. "Quite."
As they turned down Sherlock's street, he was beset by a sudden bout of nerves. It occurred to him that he'd never actually had anyone over for a social call. He ran through a mental inventory of what was lying about, and whether John might be frightened, disgusted, or alarmed by any of it. He probably should have cleaned the loo... Well, there was nothing he could do now. This might turn out to be a short visit.
"I don't believe that's quite having the intended effect," I eventually admitted regretfully, although I could not entirely keep the smugness out of my voice.
Sherlock pulls a face. "What in the world gave him that idea?"
Sherlock looks up at the ceiling again, sounding resigned. "The worst part is, I can't entirely hate him for it. He may have even known what he was doing."
"They have different plugs and sockets here," Father says as his eyes skim along the baseboard. He finds what he's looking for in the corner by the window. "Here, you see?" He bends down and points at the wall socket.
They rarely are. But Tristram is aware there are different shades of not nice. There are people who simply find it easier not to follow the rules, and there are those who don't care whether other people get hurt as long as they get what they want... and then there are those who try to hurt other people. Who like it. Tristram thinks Irene means those ones. But that doesn't change his mind.
"Jesus Christ..." John managed when Sherlock finally lifted his head. "All right," he said gamely, his eyes still a little hazy from the kiss. "Hold on."
He doesn't remember moving, but somehow he's kneeling on the floor with Father supporting him. He can feel lumpy bits in his mouth and there are long strings of viscous liquid hanging from his lips. He heaves again. He hears it hitting the metal of the bowl this time. He's pleased about that, on top of the misery. At least he got it where Father wanted it.
John cleared his throat. "Sure." A beat. An eternity. Blue eyes searching Sherlock's. Sherlock's heart in his throat. Then a slight shake of John's head, once again as if recalling where he was. A step back. "Yeah. We should..."
"We'll get back together later on, though," Doctor Watson says, his expression softening at Emily's unhappy look. "I was thinking we could all go to that igloo restaurant for dinner, how about that?" he offers.
Sherlock is silent for several beats before saying slowly, "Yes." The response doesn't invite a great deal of confidence.
John paused, already halfway turned to go. He focused somewhere in the vicinity of Sherlock's cheek, not quite meeting his eye. "Sorry? You'll do what?" It was truly almost pathetic how eager John was to forgive. Sherlock thought he might possibly be able to live with it.
'. What's this?"
It's not only that he's looking forward to seeing Emily again (despite the fact that he just saw her at school an hour ago). It's that it looks like his father and Emily's father have patched up their differences, or at least are going to be cordial enough to let him and Emily go to each other's houses. It's been a week since Doctor Watson admitted that Tristram's father was right all along, but no one's said anything about their earlier plans to have Emily come over to see some of his father's experiments or for Tristram to go to Emily's house after school. Maybe after this, they can ask again.
Mrs Holmes is standing behind her with her hands on Emily's shoulders. "What can we do to help, Sherlock?" Her voice is calm and steady.
Each of these dioramas had attracted a handful or more observers, who stood by or lounged in one of the conveniently placed seats, watching the punishments - for such I assumed they were - with attitudes ranging from curiosity and appraisal to morbid fascination and outright lechery. The entire tableau resembled something out of a medieval manuscript on Catholic torture methods, yet I could not detect anything sinister in the atmosphere. Holmes had hesitated to describe this place in any detail, yet I was certain he would have warned me were there any danger or chance of harm coming to either of us.
"Well, I think Mrs Daniels or another therapist might be able to help you with that," John suggests. "We already agreed I'd make an appointment for you when we get back, remember?"
"You're going to stay with Mycroft," Sherlock tells him. "Much as it pains me to fall back on his help in this, his team are the most incorruptible we're going to find."
He is thus not entirely sure whether he's been kidnapped or not. It's not tense and scary like the time Emily's Aunt Claire took them to the warehouse in the car, and certainly no one's tried to do anything like tie him up or threaten him. But Irene won't let him call Uncle Mycroft even though she has a working phone (he got his hands on it once when she went to the loo, but it was locked).
I had no idea what I was doing when I first invited Watson into my bed. I do not refer to a lack of familiarity with any physical acts. Those had been sampled, appraised, and catalogued years earlier, starting with the groom's apprentice on my grandmother's estate, carrying through to some fellow enthusiasts at college, and later in the guise of discreet entrenous at an anonymous London club for discerning gentlemen of especial taste. I was no stranger to the pleasures of the flesh, in other words, and considered myself an adequate bedmate, if not as adventurous as some. I personally found no erotic enticement in violence, even of the play-acted sort, nor any of the more exotic practises one hears of behind closed doors or in drunken sailors' yarns. A prick, a mouth, a hand, an arse, were all I required or desired.
Tristram is relieved, but also at a loss. He does want to make Emily feel better, but he's run out of tricks. When they reach the stone, he kicks it so that it lands a short distance ahead of them on the path. Maybe if he engages her in a game, she'll stop thinking about whatever's bothering her. A few steps later, Emily kicks it in turn again and says, "When do you think we can go home?"
In a large pot, bring potatoes to a boil in salted water; reduce to a rapid simmer and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a knife, 35 to 40 minutes. Lightly dust two parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets with flour; set aside. Drain potatoes and peel while still hot with a paring knife (use a thick, dry kitchen towel or pot holder to hold them). Immediately pass potatoes through a ricer onto a work surface. Let cool completely.
"Go on," he said, his eyes wide and his chest rising and falling with his heavy breaths.
Molly folded the jumper and replaced it on the pile. "He doesn't care what you wear," she said softly.
Tristram doesn't say anything. Whatever it is must be relatively small - and something that Doctor Watson thinks they will like - but that still leaves countless possibilities. He's learned from his father not to jump to conclusions. He looks at Doctor Watson. He's wearing a jumper, so Tristram can't see if his shirt has any pockets. He doesn't think Doctor Watson would have put anything in there, underneath his jumper, anyway. And he said their surprises were in his pockets, plural, so probably his trouser pockets. The question is, front or back? He's wearing dark blue jeans with a loose fit, so it's hard to tell if there's anything in the front pockets. He could probably see the outline of something in the back pockets, unless it's paper, but he doesn't know if it's against the rules to ask Doctor Watson to turn around. Just then, he catches Doctor Watson's fingers twitch once where they are hanging at his sides, just grazing the outside of the front pockets of his trousers. Tristram smiles to himself. Probably not paper, then, because it would get crumpled in the front pockets.
So Sherlock was stuck with pretending to be the caring flatmate, making sure that John drank a full glass of water before going to bed whenever he came home after going out for a couple of rounds with Mike, or Lestrade, or that annoying medical student volunteering at the clinic where he was temping while some other annoying doctor was on maternity leave, or - Sherlock gritted his teeth, but he couldn't complain because the more often John went out drinking, the more data Sherlock could gather for his experiment - one of those vapid women John would still insist on chatting up.
But Lestrade brushed the information aside, and focused on Molly instead. "What did you know about? What did you know?" he demanded.
However, that didn't explain why it took him until they were back in London, John long since gone upstairs to bed, to delete it.
The next of my senses to be assaulted was my nose, as it was met by an odiferous melange of smells. Cigar smoke and candle wax, leather and oil, the briny tang of sweat and the biting odor of human exertion, the faintest metallic whiff of blood or iron paired with a strangely floral note, and most peculiarly a scent I associated exclusively with the medicinal application of the violet ray, which I had seen demonstrated at a conference in Paris just before the turn of the recent century. Whilst I had not yet procured a model for my own practice, it was already all the rage as a treatment for ailments ranging from arthritis to tumors. This alone might have supported Holmes' description of the place as a kind of medical institution, were it not for all the rest.
The postman got out of his car, shut the door, and went to the back of the garage where John could see various tools and gardening equipment strewn about.  It was enough time for John to get a look at his footwear: black Dr. Marten steel-toed work boots.
But she’s not done.  She’s searching for the right words.  He hasn’t heard Mary’s ghost in nearly fifteen years, but he can almost her whisper,
To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,
Owens looked like he was struggling whether or not to invite John inside to wait.  John decided to push his luck.
“He has no suspicions,” said Sherlock, steepling his hands together under his nose and savouring the considerably fresher air.  “He is also a colossal idiot about anything with less than four legs.”
“Thanks for that.  I’ve alerted the medical team.  They were busy with some wanker who sprained an ankle attempting to run the course backwards.  They’ll be right over.  Do you know her?”
“What have you been up to?  Any good murders?”
“I don’t think money’s much of a problem for you.”
John blinked.  “Please tell me you didn’t conspire to murder her father.”
“You overdosed this time, didn’t you?”
“How’d you manage to get all of this so quickly?”  John eyed an official-looking document from the West Yorkshire Police.
As it turned out, Sherlock had miscalculated that his longer reach wouldn’t necessarily mean an easy victory.  They’d raced the length of the pool and back three times, and John bested him every one.  John hadn’t counted on Sherlock’s playful response to being thoroughly trounced, however, and he’d been taken aback when Sherlock turned on him and dunked him under the water.  It was juvenile and absolutely welcome.

He sat up.  “Buck up, Johnny,” he heard his sister say.  “Stop being such a fucking coward and
They took a shortcut through the picturesque Japanese Garden and stood on a curving wooden bridge to watch the koi swim in lazy circles beneath them, before continuing back toward the main entrance.  The colour runners were reaching the finish line: plumes of coloured powder shot up into the air and event workers sprayed the waves of runners with fire extinguishers full of colour as they crossed the finish line.  John and Sherlock were heading towards the motorbike when a panicked shriek rose up above the general din.  John heard someone calling for help, and without even thinking about it, ran from Sherlock’s side to where a small crowd had gathered near the finishing line.  Someone was trying to prevent the cannons from going off and someone was yelling for an ambulance.
“Yes.  At Harehills Surgery.  Not a problem,” replied Mycroft from behind the beautiful antique desk.
When John did manage to return home after another gruelling shift, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.  John did notice the smell right away, but once properly in the flat the lemony smell was replaced with something a bit more chemical-y.  Apparently Sherlock had not only gone to town with his chemistry set, but the entire kitchen, sink, counters, and hob were a complete wreck.  It looked like had been distilling something at one point, and a pot full of some dark green liquid was balanced precariously on a burner.  John bent down and sniffed it - something pine, astringent, minty.
It’s not like he’s never seen Sherlock cry before.  The first time was for the Woman.  Not because the emotional debacle she presented; no, Sherlock’s inability to deal with those unprecedented
“I’m afraid your leg was the least complicated of your injuries.  There’s a scar, but the bullet didn’t hit the bone.  However, there’s going to be some residual nerve damage to the shoulder.  We saved the joint itself, but you’ve got quite a bit of metal holding it all together.  I’m sure you know that we’ll want to start physio right away; the longer you wait, the harder it will be to get your range of motion back.  I’ll brief you on everything, but first, I bet you’d love a shower and a shave, hmm?  Let’s get that catheter out.”
John laughs.  “I’d never have believed it.”
John finished his pain au chocolat and decided to say hello.
“Hmmm.”
It’s nearly midnight by the time they reach the cottage.  The darkness has a different quality in the country, a velvety softness that John likes.  They have to use a torch to fit the key in the lock.
Something tight gripped John’s heart and belly as they walked down the stairs toward John’s room.  “It’s just a house,” said Sherlock, picking up on John’s air of melancholy.  “We’ll get another.  Smaller, true,” he said.  “Less to keep up with.  Somewhere in London, with a cosy sitting room, a kitchen that I can exploit as a lab, a place close to a park, and maybe…” --they had reached John’s room-- ”with a garden at the back.  Just a little one, mind you.”
John stroked Sherlock’s face, running his thumb over his eyebrow, cupping his chin.  “Of course.”
Sherlock looked around and, thankfully, agreed.
John considered making his way back to the table when he heard the barman exclaim, “Hey, arsehole, you nicked my mobile!”
The paramedics closed up the van and thanked John once more before heading out.  A police car took its place.  A beautiful black woman got out and strode confidently onto the scene.
Some would describe John as an angry, uptight little man.  He’s not.  Well, ‘little’, maybe, in a sense that he’s shorter than the average male.  He can get angry, and sometimes is uptight, but on the whole, John is many different things simultaneously.  My personal man-sized jumble of paradoxes.  If there is any part of John that is uptight, that would be his arsehole.  For as broad as he claimed his sexual repertoire to be, the man just can’t seem to relax enough for me to easily penetrate him with my penis without getting him a bit drunk beforehand.  Even then it takes a significant amount of preparation.  I think he has a biologically stubborn anus.  It’s all fine, as I actually prefer it the other way around.
“I suppose you’ll tell me you don’t know the Earth goes around the Sun, next.”
Sherlock twirled the flower stem between his fingers.  “I’m going to put it in a vase and let him puzzle over it.”
She smiles at that, scoffs a bit.  “Come now.  No more so than you did.  I gave him what he wanted.  I imagine he fancied himself a bit in love with me.”
John wondered whether or not this madman knew anything about basic human physiology.   “Suit yourself,” said John, and went back to eating.
“We also have that fellow who interrupted very important business earlier.”
Sherlock had already dialled 999.  “I’ll text you the GPS location,” he was saying.  “If you want him alive, you’d best come quickly.  Oh.  And bring a ladder.”
Sherlock didn’t return home and an hour’s research through the usual internet news sources turned up nothing promising case-wise, so John dressed and called Lestrade, hoping something was brewing that would get Sherlock’s attention off personal grooming and back onto crime.  Lestrade had nothing to offer but a pint after work, John left the flat and made himself busy the rest of the afternoon.
“Oh, this man here, he saved me,” said Angelo.  “I would have gone to prison if it weren’t for him!”
“I would have to be seriously desperate.”
Standing in front of the wall of products, John was reminded at the lengths women took to groom themselves.  Sure, he’d lived with women before, but it had been a long time; he’d forgotten.  Harry had never been one to drop more than a fiver on anything for her short blonde hair.  He’d lived with a girl named Anne for a time during med school; she had the most wonderful strawberry-scented stuff that always turned him on (he would forever remember how she’d shake her hair from a ponytail and the scent, warm and feminine, would make him weak in the knees and rock-hard other places.  He masturbated with it in the shower for nearly six months after they split).
Say, for the sake of argument, he did approach Sherlock with his feelings.  He probably couldn’t hide them forever.  He was an awful liar.  How would Sherlock react?  Would he stand there, frozen, blinking, trying to process what he’d heard?  Would he flee?  Would he be embarrassed?  Would he laugh?  If anything, he would likely remind John, in a tone that conveyed irritation at having to repeat himself, that he was married to his work and that relationships were ‘not his area’.

“If I had some oil, I’d give you a massage.  Too bad there’s not...”  John trailed off as Sherlock lifted his head.
“No, I mean me.  From you in my mouth.  Didn’t know that was possible,” he said as John reached up to smooth the back of neck, the damp curls there.  “Used to think about it,” he added.  “You’d be sitting there, watching some horrible drivel on the telly, all relaxed, your legs open and feet together, and I could have just crawled over to you and put my head in your lap.  Breathed you in.  I love the way you smell, John.  The way you taste.  You
They both slept like the dead until mid-morning.
” said John.  “That was...Jesus...really embarrassing.”
“Sherlock Holmes…”
John had flat-out refused a pedicure (Sherlock would have insisted on nail polish and while John may have recently re-evaluated his sexual identity, he was never, ever going to be caught dead with bright pink toes).  He did, however, acquiesce to a half-hour foot massage before dinner.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes before lying back down to stare at the ceiling.  “You’re a horrible doctor,” he said, but there was no venom in it.  “And tell my brother I’m leaving tomorrow!”
When it was time, he watched himself come, saw the pearly semen fly from the slit and land on his wet and shining chest and belly.
“Oh yes.  Came in late last night.  Looked like a wet puppy, he did.  Soaked to the bone.  Could have taken a car, I’d said.  He’ll catch his death.”
“She’s got something in there she doesn’t want anyone to see.”
“Just like that.  No complaining, no theatrics...?”
“Well,” he sighs, pretending to be put out.  “What is it this time?  ‘Cause if you’re asking to go to Glastonbury again, you’ve got another think coming.”
“Wise, no.  But you’re the only thing I have faith in anymore, so it will have to do.”  John took Sherlock’s hand, squeezed it.  “Come to bed.”
Sherlock laughs at that, but it’s brittle.  “She hates it.”
“This is a very important room,” continued Sherlock.  He turned his head to the side and raised an eyebrow coquettishly.  “It’s my
John waits.  “Maybe you’ll want to,” she says at last, “you know.  Not live here...alone.”
“Oh no,” said John after Sherlock looked at him with a glint in his eye.  “You’re not making me up.”
He pockets his phone again and rubs his hands together.
Sherlock kissed the top of his head.  “I’m afraid you have reached the entirely wrong conclusion about my preferences.”
“You know him, then?”
“You’ll topple headfirst, you barmy arsehole.”
They rode the next few blocks in silence, John trying very hard not to think about whether or not body hair - a very male secondary sex characteristic - would have any impact about his attraction to Sherlock.  He’d imagined his flatmate naked, sure, but the imagination has a way of making everything hazy and perfect-looking, like film does.  No one was perfect under his clothes; John knew that for a fact.  What would happen if they did cross that line, if one day those near-kisses, those infrequent but warm, friendly touches, an arm around a shoulder, the thumb spending more than a fleeting moment across the nape of the neck, and they tumbled out of their clothing and into each other’s arms?  Would John’s hitherto heterosexual body balk, his mind rebel, his libido take off screaming down the hallway at the sight of all that hair?
Sherlock opened his eyes.
“Better?” he asked as John slid past him to retrieve the wine glasses.
Sherlock kept odd hours, though, making it difficult to bring up the garden.  John was considering actually scheduling some type of date with him when Sherlock knocked on his door before letting himself in.
Any awkwardness he may have felt at the beginning of their meal was gone by the time his food arrived.  John ate with gusto while Sherlock did more storytelling than chewing.   He took an occasional bite, but most of his food was pushed from one side of the plate to the other.
“Hm.  Well, in that case, don’t let me interrupt you.”
John crouched down to where Sherlock was sitting.  “Your eyebrows are fine.  Now Sherlock Holmes, listen to me.  I don’t know what kind of crisis you’re going through, but leave your body well alone. Transport, remember.  Let’s get back to transport.  Take a bath or something.  Wash that stuff off - wait a second, Sherlock.”  John stood and picked up the bowl that contained the sticky concoction.  “What exactly is in this?”
She needn't have worried.  The dark object lying by the kerb was most decidedly
“That poor girl’s besotted with you.  Do you have to torment her?”
Mr. Campbell stayed sitting, but waved farewell and nodded.  John decided that he liked him immensely.
“Not any more.”  She placed the black sparkly number on the table and pulled out another, this one gold with dangly beading.  “They’ve just been taking up space.”
The rest of the night goes to hell in a handbasket.
?  “What’s the
“At least I can appreciate you in a suit.  You look good in a suit.  Well, the one I purchased for you, anyway.  Some of your casualwear is frankly alarming.  One day, I think I think I would like to see you in a dinner jacket.”  He closed his eyes a moment, and when he opened them back up, they shone with mischievous glee.  “Yes.  Yes, I would.”
“...loves you very much,” said John, finding his voice.  “He does, he does.”  John reached up to take the flower and flung it away, the last petal still clinging to the head.  He heaved in a breath and let it out, unbridled joy replacing his fear and nervousness.  His eyes met Sherlock’s.   “I do.”
Halfway through wondering if both of them could fit into the bathtub at 221b Baker Street, the bathroom door opened and Sherlock strode out, still gloriously hard.
“By staring at me?”
, John commanded to himself,
“She had the whole caboodle. She was exactly what we were looking for.”
was going to happen, as if something serendipitous --or delightfully dangerous-- were right around the corner.  It made him feel restless and itchy, as if what he had really been hired to do was about to begin.  And if he were going to be considered security staff, he may as well perform the job to the best of his ability, or be accused of not earning his keep.  He needed his gun.  For the last fifteen years of his life, it had been an extension of his body, as necessary to his identity as a field trauma surgeon as his fingers.  He was lying to himself if he said he didn’t miss it, didn’t sometimes imagine its weight against his side, deeply miss the routine of assembling and cleaning it. If Mycroft really wanted him to protect his estate, John would need something a bit more powerful than his fists.
“Roll over, love.  There.  Beautiful.  Now
when Sherlock was in danger; he always had, even from the first day they met.  Right now, every mental warning bell he possessed was clamouring away inside his skull.  Sherlock had serious weaknesses, whether he liked to admit it or not: he couldn’t back away from a mental challenge, even if it meant serious bodily harm, and depression and addiction were always spectres lying in wait to haunt him, enough to worry Mycroft.  John knew that Sherlock could hold his own in a fight, but in scenarios involving his mind he could be incredibly reckless.  At the moment, John was quite convinced that Lillian was going to
John Watson could care less.
“No,” said Sherlock.  “We were...playmates...of a sort.”
“I’m afraid Mitchell Amos died a few years ago.  And I haven’t the foggiest where Luke might be.  He and his wife moved ages ago.”
“You’ll solve it.”  John swallowed.  He’d never seen Sherlock so unsure of himself.  The confident swagger he’d seen at Winnicott Hall was replaced with hesitation and doubt.  “If anyone can, you will.”
“How many opportunities are you going to have to enjoy this place without having to share it with less entertaining and substantially poorer-looking company?”
, Mycroft.”
“Si, si,” said Angelo.  “It’s very good.  And a candle.  For the romance.”
“He’s had friends,” Mycroft continued.   “As well as several... dalliances... during his university years. But I can count on one hand the people he’s ever loved.  Our mother and father, me, although you’d have to torture him to admit it, and that dog.  The fifth, John, is you.  So when I offer you my congratulations, I mean it most sincerely.”
like the way she sneered at Sherlock.  John granted that she was clever in her own right, but that did not give her the prerogative to belittle the man who’d done so much to help.  Sherlock claimed it didn’t bother him, and maybe it didn’t.  But John couldn’t simply be OK with someone who was constantly vituperative.
“Why would I do that?  This is a stately home for tourists, not some playground for a bunch of pseudo-athletes with questionable tastes in amusement.”
“Oh!  Yeah.  Nearly forgot.  Found out from the girlfriend yesterday.  Turns out he’s got some crazy form of alopecia.  Genetic.  Odd, ‘cause it doesn’t seem to trouble his head, and its usually the other way around.  It’s an extremely rare condition.”
“Then, right now, Navya is our best option.  She knows, anyway, Sherlock.  Smart lady.”
“You ran off with Mycroft?”
On shaky legs, John made his way to the red padded chair and sat; it was a bit cold under his bare backside, so he pulled the old tartan blanket off the back, slung it over the chair, and sat back down.  He looked down at his lap, at the curving scar on his leg.  He traced it with his fingers, and then took himself in hand for a few leisurely moments of self-pleasure.
“Well, more for scaring them.  I was only six.”
“Please don’t tell me you were going to do the liver catalase and hydrogen peroxide reaction in your brother’s study,” John groaned.
John wrote it down in his notebook.  “Who else might have been there?  When he read to the children?”
John examined Sherlock’s inflamed back.  “This is an allergic reaction,” he said, puzzled.
“Well,” said Lestrade, “it was certainly dangerous for Brian Holleran.”
John smirked and waggled his eyebrows before retrieving what was left of the massage oil.  He took a seat between Sherlock’s spread legs and poured a generous amount into his palms.  “How’d you know, anyway?” he asked, warming the oil between his hands.  “This particular one.  You knew, didn’t you?  That this was the one I was looking at while you were doing God-knows-what at that salon?”
“So you came here to seek me out, not John?”
John patted Mycroft gently on the arm, "Thanks, but I agreed."
“John I never sa-”
“John, I am not a virgin, please just get on with it.”
Now John was really intrigued. “How in the hell could you possibly know that?” There was no way this complete stranger could have that sort of insight into his past simply by observing.
“It’s never an odd thing to ask for a kiss,” Sherlock assured John as he stood up. Placing one hand on the bed between Jon and Otaktay he braced himself as he leant over and brushed his lips lightly over John’s. He whispered, “You are amazing.” Pressing his lips more firmly against John’s he cradled his face with his other hand; very gently Sherlock sucked on John’s bottom lip, tugging lightly.
John stared at their room with apprehension. This had to be a mistake, this needed to be fixed. Rushing back down the hall he almost ran into Sherlock.
“I asked is that why you disappeared? You were gone before the first dance.”
Sherlock tried to discreetly wipe away his tears he didn’t want John to see him upset.
, or Crazy Buffalo, answered him. He cursed my mom’s offspring to live in both worlds and to drive people mad with jealousy, desire, and love.”
A moment later there was a knock at the bedroom door. “My liege, we have found more of the traitors. Possibly the last of them.” Liam sighed dramatically. Leaning forward he placed a quick kiss on John’s forehead, “Stay safe boo.”
“Simple really, you have the bearings of a soldier, once a soldier, always a soldier.”
“When Mary was pregnant with Rosie, she had insisted on a blanket made of fur from a bear. She swore it was the warmest fur in these parts. Took me forever to save up for one. But at least it comes in handy now.”
They finished their meal in silence, Sherlock brooding over whatever he was brooding over and John reading the paper.
he was going to be a father, and he had fought to be okay with it, to be happy about an unplanned child. To deal with the hurt he saw on Sherlock’s face at the news. And now? He had nothing to show for all of it but an empty spot where his heart should be.
John watched Sherlock speed away, he wanted nothing more than to go after him. Turning to face Samantha he unclenched his teeth and smiled at her. “I’m sorry Sherlock makes you nervous. He’s a good guy, truly. He just worries about me.”
“Does this mean she is to hold a seat on the council John asked.
“Uh, sorry. Yeah, yeah.” Greg knew Sherlock wouldn’t be calling him if everything had gone smoothly so he asked, “And how did John react?”
“Don’t be silly. You are neither homophobic or a killer.”
"Thank you, Mycroft. I owe you for this eye-opening experience. At the start of all this, you stated you were the elder brother and therefore had to set an example, you were right, I have learned so much from you during all of this. I do believe I saw Gavin Lestrade over by Mummy if you would excuse me."
John glanced down quickly at Sherlock, this was something they had never discussed. And quite honestly John had hoped he had hidden those first desperate days from Sherlock’s all-knowing mind. “Honestly Sherlock, I had several different plans. But I had truly felt that when it came down to it, it wouldn’t be one of my well thought out plans, it would be spare of the moment with my gun probably alone. Like always. No one to mourn me or to come looking for me.”
Alasdair gave a humorless chuckle, “My kind. You are all my kind; even John.”
“Thank you, Sherlock!”
Sherlock had climbed on the bed and into John’s arms. John’s words had been delivered against Sherlock’s temple.
Sherlock watched John’s face. He had never touched another man in such a manner. Hell, he barely touched himself outside of personal hygiene and to prep himself but that was always clinical. The skin that surrounded John's impressive organ was silky smooth and soft to the touch. Sherlock liked the way it felt, extreme hardness encased in softness. He didn’t recall his own member being so soft to the touch.
“First, you shagged at his place, so don’t you know where he lives? And second, a detective? Like a cop?”
John could slap himself. I could
“That’s not true Sherlock. We have always been able to trust him. He just plays his hand close to his chest.”
John laughed at Liam’s antics and the wink he aimed at them to let them know he had been joking.
Sherlock looked away, avoiding eye contact with both Otaktay and John. “I feel- I feel bad for this, but I feel like I should rip Alasdair’s throat out, behead Fíona and just be done with it all.” Sherlock dared to glance up to see how the men took his statement, neither looked particularly vexed by his confession.
“Sherlock? Are you alright?”
“Everyone knows where I bloody live.”
John too stared at Alasdair, but there were hurt and betrayal in his eyes.
“Why do you feel bad?”
“Let me go find Otaktay and we’ll see about getting you home if you really want to go.”
Delma cocked her head to the side; she stared at Sherlock and John alike. She knew something was up; Sherlock had just used endearments for both her and Mansi, he didn’t do that. John was the only exception. When John gave one of his patented lopsided smiles, she nodded her head and moved from the bed.
“I want to apologize again for skipping out on the big fight. But I saw the bigger fight on the horizon and I knew you would defeat Moriarty.”
John gave a small sigh as he reached for the box.
“Yes. Now let me see the damn photo. The fact that the man looks like me isn’t just an added bonus, it means something. Maybe it is somewhere I’ve been before. Or somewhere I am supposed to go.”
Entering the gym John saw it wasn’t empty, Alasdair was currently doing squats with weights with the pull-down bar. John made eye contact with Alasdair, nodding to him as he started to stretch. John wasn’t in the mood for small talk or talking of any nature, to be honest. He knew that he needed to get to know this man but he had no desire to do it at the moment. He just wanted to lose himself in his workout.
“How do you know he is keen?”
Sherlock’s words were mumbled low but John just made them out. “I will be here in the morning and we can talk more than, go to sleep.”
“True match should I remind you.”
“Oh good, you’re awake. Let’s go, John! It’s morning and another present was left last night! Up! Up! We have to review the surveillance footage and open the gift!”
Sherlock bit John again but this time he ran his tongue over the spot afterward.
Switching to English Alasdair continued, “Do you not speak the language of your mother?”
“And well I had to bring them with me or Molly would have woke him and told him where I went.”
“I suppose you’re right.” John stood up, they needed to be going, the days were shorter and a snowstorm was expected tonight.” John pulled Sherlock into a hug, “We must go. I’ll miss you, be careful. Please.” John held on a little longer than deemed necessary but he would miss Sherlock and the easy intimacy they had. They talked and argued like they had known each other for years. John didn’t want to leave. Part of him wanted to throw caution to the wind and not even return home to try and stay here with Sherlock instead. But, he had responsibilities back home. Finally letting Sherlock go he called Rosie over to say goodbye.
“John! You’re home early, you only just left. I wanted this to be a surprise.”
Sherlock smiled to himself. How did he get so lucky to find and woo John? Liam had been correct when he said they were destined for each other, no other would be able to replace John.
A moment later the three men and Hyde burst through the door; Liam and John were on Alasdair almost immediately.
John let out a shaky breath. This was a dream come true, or he was still dreaming. He had the ridiculously beautiful Sherlock Holmes tucked securely between his thighs and kissing him. His body was reacting to the stimuli and he knew it was only a matter of time before Sherlock became aware.
There was no reaction no brighter spark, no nothing from the woman he sought to help. Coming back to himself he noticed Sherlock leaning heavily against him. Concern had him turning and pulling his face between his hands and staring him in the eyes. “You alright Sherlock?”
Rosie was sitting next to him and they were discussing the terms of her continued lessons when Sherlock came back in.
“Thank you. You just admitted to giving our friend over there something. A little blood test will tell us what. I know it’s not a fatal dose of whatever you gave him because you like to choke your victims, get up close and personal as you watch the light leave their eyes.” The man struggled against John’s hold trying to get to Sherlock. Sherlock watched with a total lack of concern, he had complete faith in John Watson.
Sherlock sat up in the bed. He didn’t know if he could do this but he had to try. He ran a hand through his hair roughly. He needed help. He turned the light back on and waited for John to return.
John could feel Sherlock steadying himself.
Sherlock had lost his chance. He felt like he was dying inside. The officiant was speaking, something about doing the ceremony a little different. He absently wondered to himself on the whereabouts of his brother, how could they start the ceremony when he still did not see his brother?
“How far do you want to take this? Let me know now because I’m not a saint, and you are making it pretty hard-”
Sherlock’s mind was racing. He barely registered getting dressed. When he'd begun getting dressed this morning he'd abandoned the task part way through. He was sliding into his coat when Mrs Hudson walked in. “Woohoo’ Sher- aah! Is that an eye on the couch Sherlock?”
Sherlock realised he was still holding the man's hand, John, he had said. Sherlock liked the feel of the man’s hand in his own. He’d also liked the huge, but they both gave him different feelings.
“Mycroft?”
Without hesitation, Sherlock responded, “Yes John. Je t'aime avec moi.”
“Now I have a new prized teddy bear that I tell everything to.” Sherlock saw John studying his face, he was always so thoughtful, making sure Sherlock was okay.
"Okay, let's say you were correct, that doesn't explain the influence he had over you. Also, you said I didn't remember the situation correctly."
John placed a kiss on Sherlock's temple before prodding him to get up. “We should wash properly and towel off. The water's grown cold, and you'll get all pruney.”
Sherlock had been settled down on the floor facing the Christmas tree thinking, it took him a moment to comprehend what John had said. “Yes, that’s true, what’s your point?”
John changed their positions so that Sherlock lay on his back and John was once again nestled between his thighs. He could tell Sherlock was both nervous and annoyed. He’d change his mood quickly enough. John placed a kiss over the pulse in his neck and another just below Sherlock’s ear. He felt a small shudder go through Sherlock as he licks along the shell of the detective’s ear. “Relax Sherlock, you’ll enjoy this, I promise.”
“Don’t be silly. No.”
Sherlock looked around to see if anyone was watching them, leaning forward he whispered, “He kissed me.”
Both Sherlock and John looked at Mycroft confused before it finally sunk in. “Really Mycroft? They screwed up on our reservation. Wait, is that what you meant by finally?”
“Okay let’s do this.”
“You got my name right!”
"You cock! You could have told me the plan."
John stood up and stretched. “How long was I out?”
"Sherlock love." John patted the bed to his left.
“Very much.” After a few minutes of silence, Sherlock spoke again, “This is good you and I, right?”
“Really John?”
John let his arm rest against Otaktay's back. Both of the men were spooked and feeling out of sorts, he could relate. Without actually thinking about his actions John began humming, mainly to try and chase away the tension in the room. While he sang he daydreamed about how wonderful it would be if he could heal emotional wounds with his voice. He even wondered if that was what Otaktay did when he healed with his incense.
Sherlock sat in the chair and watched as John cleared a patch of earth and set the kindling down. “Can you light it?”
“Working the ground is hard work, no place for a little girl.”
John could feel his face go red. This gorgeous man, who could have his pick of anyone in the bar tonight had been staring at him? Wait- “Was
Fíona looked John in the eyes, and then glanced quickly at Sherlock. “I didn’t have to seek you out. I didn’t have to warn you. I want you to think hard about the last couple of days, has he tried splitting the council up or turning you against one another? Maybe even making you second guess John. He is very sly.”
John frowned, “We have to go wake Mansi, as much as I would love to-”
Sherlock had dozed off at some point and the sound of running feet woke him up. Looking over the edge of the pot he saw Rosie running towards him with her arms outstretched.
“Otaktay said I wasn’t really dreaming, that he was the one dreaming.” John looked back at Sherlock then, “Sherlock, he said I was dream walking.”
His phone rang, Sherlock sat up. Oh, maybe he should add psychic to his repertoire. The object he had been throwing in the air landed on the couch where Sherlock’s head had just been.
“I don’t know Sherlock. But like you said it doesn’t seem like it. He’s still out.” John roughly ran a hand through his hair. “I mean I saw the magic clear away leftover dark spots inside him and I got rid of the rest of the dark tie to Moriarty. Even with his aura as I treated it some of the colors seemed to fade and then came back. Perhaps I can try again tomorrow.”
Molly smiled at everyone. “Me too. Goodnight, can’t wait to see everyone all dressed up tomorrow.” Lestrade and Molly walked away and Mycroft walked up again but this time he was with his parents. “Everyone is heading to bed. You two delinquents, I hope you don’t stay up all night and disappoint everyone by being late for the wedding.”
“Oh no, much longer than a night.” Alasdair responded. “Death is coming to your doorstep.”
John kept staring straight ahead. “No, no. I think I need to tell you.”
“My point is I don’t know where I stand with you now. I don’t want things to be weird or for you to feel like I’m pressuring you, but I have
"We'll find a solution. Something that won't cause a strain on our relationship already in progress. And something that Otaktay can live with."
Sherlock was having a tough time keeping it together as they searched an old abandoned warehouse. John had thought this place was fit enough to breathe his last breaths. That saddened Sherlock beyond measure. Needing to be reassured Sherlock made his way over to John and slipped his hand into his. He loved that John didn’t call him out in these moments. They were still learning about one another romantically but John was taking his knowledge of Sherlock in general into consideration. Sherlock, as a rule, avoided any emotional talks especially if they involved him directly. He preferred to just pretend they didn’t exist, and bless John he wasn’t treating Sherlock to an inquisition over holding his hand while on a possible crime scene.
Maybe ten minutes had passed when Liam heard footsteps again, and another five before Sherlock and John came into view. They were both carrying a body. Sherlock was carrying the body of Otaktay and John held Mansi. Both of their eyes were back to normal but Liam could tell that John had been crying. Liam gathered Delma up in his arms and fell in line behind the other two heading back to the car.
Mrs. Hudson squeaked and clapped her hands, smiling broadly. “No! How?”
“And what are your feelings about her?”
There was already a chair pulled up next to John’s, he sat in it and took in John’s drawn features and his haunted eyes. “
John took full advantage of the other man parting his lips to take a breath. He placed his free hand on the small of the man’s back and deepened the kiss. John ran his tongue slowly just inside the man’s mouth, pulling back to nip at his bottom lip.
“Uh yeah actually, baby steps with this one Molly. I wouldn’t want to scare him back into his shell.” John winked at Sherlock and continued with his task.
Whirling Sherlock looked behind him to see what John was smiling about; Fíona was standing behind him. How in the world?
Both women replied at the same time and in the same manner, “I don’t like her.”
John shoved Rosie through the small hole, they hadn’t moved the plant enough for him to squeeze through yet. Sherlock motioned for John to go ahead and he started back towards the table by a different route, a route that would take the giant's attention from the corner where John and Rosie were hiding.
“Shh, Sherlock. You know you like this, barely prepped, tight. Mmm. Makes me want to have you next.”
John rolled on top of Sherlock capturing his mouth all in the same movement. Sherlock’s legs parted to welcome him in between. John couldn’t keep himself from moving, he thrust against Sherlock, their pricks wet with precum sliding against each other. Sherlock’s moan nearly broke him. He gripped his hips and thrust harder, faster. He needed this, it had been so long.
There was a tap on his shoulder and he looked up, Rosie was standing there and she was looking at both he and John. He had grown to know the little tyke as well and she was up to something. She had that gleam in her eye, the one she always had before trying something nefarious. Maybe nefarious was too strong a word but he knew his little Rosie was about to drop a bomb. His little Rosie? Who was he kidding? He cared for the little girl, probably even long before he realised she was a package deal with the man sitting beside him.
Rayne took a step back and slid her hand into Lestrade’s, “Let’s go sexy.” Lestrade stood and followed Rayne out of the room.
Sherlock approached the suspect. “What did you give him?”
“No, no, I’m not saying that. I mean I never tried to see if I could use my power against anyone not guilty or-”
“Yeah that’s what I thought too.”
“What? No. Why would I do that?”
Everyone turned and watched them leave.
“Know you were a doctor and soldier?”
Otaktay broke away first. “I know Sherlock is not a dream walker, but I still expect him to barge in at any moment and growl at me for being too close.”
The men went back out to the sitting room where Mansi stood blocking the way to the backdoor and Delma held a post at the front door.
Once inside John turned on him, fisted his hands in the front of Sherlock soggy jacket and dragged him to him. Kissing him for all he was worth. Sherlock kissed him back just as urgently. Part of him was still afraid he would wake up, finding this to all be a dream.
“Yes.” Sherlock whispered it but he thought he had yelled it. Everyone stopped their chattering to look at him. John took his hands and dropped back down in front of him.
“I've missed you.”
“You will today.”
John almost lost his concentration when he felt Sherlock’s head hit his lap. “You really like laying like that, don’t you?” He asked.
John looked up at Sherlock, thank God he was so vain. “Give me your tie!”
“What was the point? You were about to be married.” Sherlock stood up, “Gelato?”
“Sherlock, don’t you want to take off the jacket?”
John proceeded to make love to Sherlock for half the morning. When he'd finally tired himself out it was with a goofy smile on his face while he held Sherlock to him.
John ran his fingers through Sherlock's hair lightly, hesitantly. When he felt more than heard Sherlock's sigh as he carded his hand through the curls more surely.
Upstairs Sherlock took pointe, Alasdair had intercepted them in the hallway and followed them into Mansi’s room. “Delma, love, we want to try something else to wake up sweet Mansi, okay?”
“Nooo, Sherlock! I’m going to try to go back to sleep. You’re welcome to stay, I’m sure you’ve been up all night.”
“Mmmhmm, told you it would be.”
John just looked at the man. He could feel his strength and power, it radiated from him like heat from the ground on a particularly hot summers day. He was telling the truth. At least the truth as he believed it. He supposed he could keep the man’s secret especially since he didn’t believe him.
“I am that. In fact, I think that really describes me better than anything else. I didn’t stand a chance when I met you.”
When he came out Sherlock wasn’t in sight and Rosie was sitting up on the bed rubbing her eyes.
“God no! That would’ve been
Rosie ran to the edge of the table and slid down the rope hanging there just like Sherlock had shown her.
“No.”
“John. What did
“WHERE ARE YOU? WHEN I FIND YOU I WILL GRIND YOUR BONES TO BUTTER MY BREAD!”
“I really
“And I third it.” said Rayne.
to be here, and he wasn’t here out of some perceived notion he had to be because they were friends. John wanted to have sex with him. That thought tightened things low in his body and made him feel even warmer.
“Right over there Rosie.”
find a way to end you.”
Sherlock must be dreaming. John had not spoken to him first. Unless- was John really here? “John?”
Sherlock, John, Hyde and Samantha sat in the kitchen, 3 of the 4 was eating.
Sherlock looked at Mrs. Hudson and then down at his hands on the table, he could help the blush that started to creep over his face. “Can I let you in on a little secret?” Not waiting on a response because Sherlock knew Mrs. Hudson could keep a secret with the best of them. “John knows.”
Sherlock didn’t chance a look at John, He dropped the hand he'd captured and moved his own to the waistband of John’s pants.
“I’ve only just met you John but I know you’re a stand up guy doing the best that you can. I also think it is very easy for all of us to forget you are also an empath and feel what others feel as well. So you are not only handling your own feelings but also those around you." After a brief pause Hyde added, "I am making quite the gesture by standing with you and not my maker.”
John sighed heavily, “Alasdair and Fíona are there, both claiming the other means to do us harm. I am not sure who to believe.”
“I didn’t”
“Ooooh whaaaat is wrong with you?! You have been moody and playing awful music for the past couple of days. You would think you were in love. Stop it with the music already, I’m tired of the rain.”
“Sounds like an unknown threat to me,” Delma said from the door. “Mansi and I will go to her and maybe we should lock her up in the cells.”
“Ah, where’s the package?”
“Don’t split hairs. I’ll be outside babe.”
John sat, he started to take Sherlock's hands but was unsure what was going on so refrained from doing so.
“Do you think the giant would really come looking for you if you just left?”
The man turned and looked John fully in the eyes. Oh, he was definitely a toff, he was wearing a three-piece suit in the middle of a pub. He even carried an umbrella, a fancy jacket hanging over his arm.
John shrugged. I don’t know. Someone was broadcasting the conversation to me.”
