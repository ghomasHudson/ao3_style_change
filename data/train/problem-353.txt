Sherlock had never seen a lone wolf's first transformation before, he simply knew it was a time consuming experience, not to mention painful. Of course the movement of bones and muscle would hurt, he thought; why would anyone imagine it otherwise? However an increasing amount of the population believed it to be fluid and without effort, some even saying it brought the creature pleasure. With experience, this could be true, although it remained uncomfortable. Information about the shifts were scarce seeing as lycanthropes preferred not to talk about it. Perhaps Holmes could extract some feedback from-
Everywhere seemed quite quiet, startlingly so; a frigid air sweeping through hallways. Once, happy chatter would fill the air, friendly faces would bob along to their quarters. Yet in minutes all was gone. A graveyard, filled with souls that lay in silence. Seeing there was nothing much to do, Molly went and gathered her own things, sniffling silently.
. He no longer needed crutches, and only walked with a small limp. The mound of bandages had been replaced by a simple plaster to stop any dirt from entering the tender fresh skin. Sherlock had asked to take a sample from the wound, just in case DNA still remained. He had a suspicion that maybe he had been bitten, but the results for anything of the sort had come back negative. The detective stood staring at them, puzzled. Something was wrong with them. But he couldn't see
He clearly was inexperienced compared to whoever these were. Yes, two might have been wolves - actual wolves (maybe larger, but still) he noted, not whatever he'd been last night - but even the redhead, who was still in a more human form, ran with the same grace and ease as them; leaping over rocks, bounding up hills, sliding down ledges, dashing through leaves... and then there was John, a stumbling mess holding what felt like a dead-weight. Despite nearly crashing into a river, twisting his ankle, and falling down (multiple times), he felt a certain thrill - almsot at home. The wolf was running with him instead of against him, throwing it's head back and howling in his head. Everything was balanced instead of overwhelming.
Clearing his throat and gaining his composure, he spoke. "My plan worked, as I thought." John huffed in response, placing him down beside a tree.
Getting on the train was surprisingly easy. No questions had been asked, luggage was allowed to be kept, everyone just thought that John was this man's son, who had moved to America then come back to bring his father to Wales for whatever reason. Not suspicious in the slightest. It was when they entered their carriage that things had began going wrong.
”That’d be nice, Sherlock,” mumbled John sleepily. His voice sounded oddly sweet, and he looked up at Sherlock with a small smile.
Once a safe distance away from the soon-to-be-fireball, Sherlock stopped. "So where are we going? Or, what are we doing?"
A low chatter filled the room once more, releasing the tension that once held everyone captive. Molly had no more questions to ask, and nothing more to tell, so she left John alone, knowing that Sherlock would want his own questioning later. She retreated to her own room; through empty hallways and perhaps the occasional face. Everyone seemed to know her, giving a friendly smile. She returned it, but quickened her pace with ever person she came across. Fumbling with keys, her door was swung open and slammed shut. The light switch remained untouched as she collapsed onto the floor and cried. Sherlock's face had brought out so many memories; memories buried deep into her library and hidden with lock and key. But the detective seemed to have that very key, the key she thought was gone forever. The walks in the park on cold autumn evenings, watching movies and laughing at Sherlock's over analysation of every scene, nights spent wrapped in each other's arms... and it had all been ruined one night when they'd had a little too much fun after a particularly difficult case. Well, she certainly knew another particularly difficult case; Sherlock Holmes. And no one could ever solve it.
Curling in on himself, he shrieked and cursed until his tongue could fall off; with the amount of times he'd bitten it, that wasn't entirely unlikely or impossible. Tearing skin and grinding bones were a horribly awful sensation, as well as that of his
Eventually John fell asleep, his face returning to a reasonable colour as he did so. Although perhaps a bit flushed, if Sherlock was to assess it. He wondered if he had a fever, or did indeed get travel sick but was afraid to admit it.
Sherlock laughed again, his cheeks tinted pink. "You people are so sensitive about this sort of thing! Goodness me. Here, borrow my jacket if this bothers you so deeply. And be glad I'm being so considerate."
Quickening their pace, all three hurried to the exit. John had originally offered to carry the case, but Sherlock had insisted that he do it, seeing that John was injured still. Molly hissed for them to hurry up; she didn't particularly fancy being turned to crisps. And so off they scurried to the safety of the woods once more. It was drizzling, not exactly the best weather to set a building alight, but at least it lessened the chance of a forest fire. Molly gave one last look at the place she had learned to love, despite the smell of chemicals and the coffee being quite revolting. In her final goodbyes, she noticed John lagging behind, eyes squinting as he rubbed at his temple.
Mrs Hudson - still on the phone - tilted her head and mouthed at Sherlock to go see who it was. Strolling down the steps, he put on the famous coat he sported everywhere he went.
Water flooded his mouth and infiltrated his lungs, making him feel sick. A pale face looked grave as he tried his best to spit any offending liquid from his mouth. John wasn’t a bad swimmer, in fact he was quite good. But the previous days had been filled with heavy rain, which left the river a raging beast.
Above, a thundering crash echoed in the air. His worries were silenced, but suddenly resurfaced as quickly as he sunk. Muscles were going on strike thanks to the cold conditions they were forced to work in, and Sherlock hadn't quite realised how quickly this would happen. Goodness, what was
A once simple world of grey streets and miserable faces was now filled with something far more vivid; so bright that your eyes ached when you looked at it. The pain didn't stop when you looked away, it travelled behind - to a place you couldn't simply scrub it away. The smell of cigarette smoke wasn't there -
"The corpses are all mutilated in different ways. See how - John?" started the detective, stopping suddenly noticing the shade of the other's face. John  was staring out of the window, skin a somewhat olive colour and slicked with sweat. "Do... are you alright? Do you get travel sick?"
Quite startled, Molly turned her head sharply. There was a small pop; her neck hadn't quite been ready to perform such an action. It was only John; his crutches making the metallic noise. He asked where Sherlock was and followed him into the lab, despite Molly's warnings that he worked alone. She didn't hear 'get out' or anything of the sort, and so she left them alone.
Soft kind hands were now gone. No one to comfort or ground him; drag him back to where he should be. One last desperate cry was ripped away by someone -
Sherlock looked around, confused. They seemed to be on land again. How had he not noticed? Had he blacked out? Perhaps that was why he had such a strange sort of.. vision. It sent shivers down his spine to the think of the image that remained bright in his mind, and he continued to shiver thanks to the cold wind of the night. Mumbling like an upset toddler, he reached out to the wolf that was busily licking at wounds.
Firstly, he poured too much of the powder onto the carpet. He only knew this after he tried scrubbing it, because it fizzed and bubbled alarmingly. It then began expanding and left a cloud of bubbles on the carpet. Which wasn’t what should have happened.
" 'M not a puppy," John mumbled, the wolf's consistent nagging beginning to fade. "jus' hungry. It won't shut up, Sh'lock. Wants sleep n' food n' warm."
The mostly human population lived in fear; which paranormal beings were to be trusted and which were to be jailed? Now, a difference could be told.
He slapped himself at that moment, realising he'd been drawn into his own thoughts as per usual. John's face was becoming increasingly pale, his eyes glassy. Once rugged and rapid breaths were now shallow and worryingly scarce. His movements had began to falter; just trembles and twitches.
But then there were more hands, and they weren't there to help. Gripping at his legs and dragging him back, he screamed and struggled, but there were so so many and he couldn't fight anymore. He was too tired. The light - that was once so,
"I think I can hear the sirens coming now! Yes, that's right, the once great Sherlock Holmes is due to be arrested,"
The words made emotions well in his chest - none unpleasant. It was strange as to how 'pup' and 'cub' left him with entirely different reactions. He hadn't minded when Sherlock had called him a puppy, so why did 'pup' anger him? And wasn't cub what they called newborn wolves? He most certainly wasn't newborn - and he wasn't exactly alone either. Yet, why did the wolf make him nod his head pitifully?
week - and here they were, practically cuddling. It was for warmth, he told himself; in any other situation such an activity would disgust him. Then he realised they were cuddling in the middle of nowhere, with rain lightly beginning to shower down, with no food, with no shelter, and with limited clothing. John was only wearing an oversized shirt;
of heeled boots. Ones all too familiar to Holmes. Molly appeared from the dark, a stormy look on a usually nervous face. Her lab coat was a pristine white, without a single crease; clearly brand new. Arms were crossed as her expression set firmer on her features.
"You looked like this earlier. When you woke up," he said softly, watching hazy eyes move towards where he was to gaze - almost lovingly - up at him. "after the nightmare. I never knew new wolves were like... puppies."
Irene sprayed her mixture of raspberry and blackberry 'Forest Fantasies' liberally, inhaling the scent with a sharp toothed smile, eyes closing in bliss. Sherlock hoisted his scarf to cover his nose and mouth better, finding the smell ever so slightly unbearable in this quantity. In the front seat, she gave a giggle. Sherlock had never been one for strong scents, preferring faint, familiar ones: tea, soap, grass, tobacco...
"Yes, perfectly alright. Tea? Shall we have some tea?" blurted Holmes. John looked a bit confused, politely going to decline when someone suddenly burst through the door. Molly stood there, looking a bit red-eyed and miserable.
John got fidgety and even paler,  having to eventually spit out his gum. Sherlock was too absorbed in reading some new case files they had been given. It discussed how people had died; blood loss or blunt force trauma was most common. Only a few had been killed instantly, leaving it a fact that this wasn't an expert. Some corpses were still missing; including Mary's, leaving his theory strong. He only noticed John didn't look all that well when he went to point out a few new details to him.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but John saw a flicker of happiness on his face as he left to the kitchen again.
As quickly as silence took over, a frenzy occurred. Everyone started packing things up, giving nervous glances to the two stowaways, then to Molly, as if suggesting they need to leave. Now.
A hand lay him to rest, giving small mumbles of disapproval. The way it was done reminded him of something Mrs Hudson had done when he was ill - or dare he say, it reminded him somewhat of a motherly gesture. Slurring words, he tried asking who was there. His voice came out like John's had earlier, much to his surprise. How strong had the sedative been? A familiar yet.. different voice replied.
Bloody being an accurate word, in this description. Murky grey carpets had been - unwillingly - dyed a vivid crimson; walls would be stained for quite a while, the strongest of bleach unable to break it's spirit.
With blinking eyes he realised he was no longer in the clutches of the lake - or cold, for that matter. Still wet, with clothes hanging loosely off of him, but not cold. A source of warmth was right beside him; in fact he was nestled into it. He was in the arms of
The door clicked and she was now gone. Sherlock was alone. With John. Who was sick. And he had to clean. And a thud had just come from the bathroom.
Mycroft made a pouting face, a mocking of misery. “Oh dear, I’m sorry. Are you going to make him some chicken soup? To help him feel better?”
The front seat was crawled into by a woman decked in padding and a high-vis jacket. The way she looked into the rear view mirror was startlingly familiar to Sherlock. Those eyes... they were a mischievous ruby red, flaked with black diamonds. They glinted and glowed when the blue lights were turned on in an intoxicating way, leaving Sherlock to wonder who this was. In a startling moment, she put her foot down and let the car roar to life. A cackle escaped blood soaked cupid lips  as the waves of people jumped to the side as a manic BMW flew past.
When asked what happened to Mary, John explained - as best he could without getting overly emotional - that he hadn't seen her dead. But he'd heard her scream, scream his name, before an ear splitting thud came from the staircase. When he'd scrambled to see what was going on, the beast was entering their bedroom, dragging her along on the floor. Before he could call the police he'd been the one thrown about, his leg being a favourite place to grab.
Small details that only a true professional could pick up on. Some began theorising he himself wasn't human, but a quick DNA test put an end to those articles. The mystery of Holmes' excellence would stay just that.
"We don't all end up with a bullet through your temple." John pointed out as Sebastian's mobile alerted him of a message.
"Her phone." Sherlock agreed. "Where's her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case." He watched John's mind began to race, looking at all the puzzle pieces scattered about and trying to put them together. Usually Sherlock would just tell the person the answer, but right now he wanted to see how long it would take John to figure it out. "We know she had one. That's her number there. You just texted it."
"No, that's fine." John told her politely. He raised an eyebrow when she blushed and checked him over. He had to have imagined that, he was broken. No one wanted a broken Omega. Well, no one other than Sherlock.
"Sherlock Holmes." He greeted sounding happy to actually see Sherlock. He was sure that the only reason Sebastian was happy to see him was because he was going to solve their break in without having to go to the police and cause a scandal.
"He's busy. I'm in charge." The Alpha growled out at him while baring his teeth. Though John wanted to cut into the duel between the two Alpha's, John knew that he shouldn't. When two Alpha's fought over territory it was unwise to interfere, you could be seriously hurt or mounted and publicly mated if you were an Omega like John. "And it's not Sergeant, it's Detective Inspector Dimmok." And then Dimmok's eyes were on John causing Sherlock to growl and pull him close. Dimmok gave his own growl before he turned and left the room. Sherlock seemed to take a few seconds to collect himself before he lead John after Dimmok.
"Oh." John groaned in annoyance, cutting into Sherlock's thoughts. He glanced at the Omega from the corner of his eye and saw him going through the mail. "Need to get a job."
"Why not? Given that text I just had you send and the fact that I have her case it's a perfectly logical assumption." Sherlock said, part of him wanted John to accuse him already and be done with it while another part was desperate for John to believe him.
"Yes, when you said we were going to the bank..." John joked looking around the posh bank that Sebastian worked at. Hearing John joking again made a weight fall off Sherlock's shoulders. John was happy again. It would seem a case was the exact thing John needed. Sherlock smirked at him before looking around the bank as he lead John to the escalators. Multiple time zones. The Bank is open at all hours. Card swipes. Keeping tabs on who was coming and going. Elevators only went to the 42nd floor. Building is 42 stories. This was not some normal break in.
"Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello." John said shuffling his cane to his other hand to shake the hand Mike had offered him. John instantly noted the bonding ring on Mike's finger and tried to shove off the anger and resentment he suddenly felt. It wasn't Mike's fault that he was useless now.
"I know. It's how we met. It really quite fascinating." John said smiling softly at Sherlock while squeezing his hand. Sherlock gave John as small wink before smirking at Sebastian who didn't seem to know how to react. It would seem he isn't used to being ignored by an Omega.
"Lost five million in a single morning, made it all back a week later." Sebastian growled out. "Nerves of steel, Eddie had."
"He scaled six floors of a Docklands apartment building," Sherlock growled at him, "jumped the balcony and killed Van Coon."
"This is my partner, John Watson." Sherlock introduced laying a possessive hand on John's shoulder, happy that the Omega didn't say anything about it. Sebastian gave him an unbelieving look.
"Yes." John answered firmly, setting a hand on top of Sherlock's, silently claiming him. Sebastian raised a reprimanding brow at John. Sebastian never did like the idea of Omega's being out spoken and independent, he preferred them to be subservient and stay at home.
"Good for you." Sherlock muttered before beginning to spout out directions. "Right turn, one way, roadworks, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic light." Once finished with whatever he was doing, Sherlock took off and John quickly followed.
"You said I had a therapist." John whispered not wanting to break the heated tension that had settled over them once more.
"On painting. Yes, I need to talk to an expert." Sherlock informed him as they made it to the back of the building where and young Omega male was spray painting the back door. Sherlock stopped beside the young man and John couldn't help admiring the painting. It was a very detailed painting of a cop holding a rifle.
"And the blindfold, that horizontal line. That was a number as well." Sherlock told him showing him a tag with the same horizontal line on it. "The Chinese number one, John."
"Dam my leg!" John growled out loudly scaring Mrs Hudson and causing guilt to take the place of his annoyance. "Sorry, I'm so sorry." He told her honestly. "It's just sometimes this bloody thing..."
"Well, that's where this gets really interesting, but for that, we'll have to go back to the reception desk." Sebastian informed and Sherlock motioned for him to lead the way. And within minutes they were huddled around a computer behind the reception desk as Sebastian pulled up the security log. "Every door that opens in this bank, it gets logged right here. Every walk-in cupboard, every toilet."
"Both of you?" Mrs Hudson asked in concern causing Sherlock to pause at the door before swiftly spinning on the balls of his feet to look at her with excitement in his eyes.
"Sorry, it's in my coat." Mike told him and Sherlock bit the urge to snarl at him and roll his eyes. Useless.
"Come along John, we're done here." Sherlock told him before gently taking John by the hand and leading him back out of the shop and back across the road.
"So you bought your lunch from here en route to the station," Sherlock muttered as he walked from the station, passing by the restaurant, on his way to figure out where the package had been dropped off at, "but where were you headed from? Where did the taxi drop you?"
"Do you know you do that out loud?" He asked bending down just enough to whisper in John's ear causing him to blush.
"So, you're doing well. You've been abroad a lot." Sherlock stated causing Sebastian to smirk proudly.
"Yes." John said receiving an intense stare from the Alpha. "That's true, isn't it? But he wasn't a very nice man."
"What do you think, then, Dr. Watson?" Mrs Hudson asked. "There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms." She mentioned as Sherlock took off his coat and scarf.
"It wasn't working for me." Molly said awkwardly after glancing at John and taking a half step away from him sensing his 'wrongness'. His womb then.
"Cleared off before we got here." Lestrade said looking over and noticing John just standing there, pretending to look around. "But a guy like that would have had enemies, I suppose. One of them could have been following him, but... we've got nothing to go on."
"This symbol, I still can't place it." Sherlock glared at the wall of clues before spinning on the balls of his feet. "You had your fill?" He asked. "Good." He continued not giving John time to answer verbally. "I need you to go to the police station and ask about the journalist," He said pulling John from his seat, a surge of annoyance flew through John for a second before leaving, "his personal effects would've been impounded." Sherlock informed him as he slipped John coat onto him. "Get hold of his diary or something that will tell us his movements."
"Van Coon. The police are at his flat." John growled out, he wanted this conversation to be done and over with so that they could leave and return home.
"Um, I could always do with the money." He told her with a polite smile, making her blush darker. She was just warm, the room did feel a tad bit warm.
"Because I'm desperate, that's why." Lestrade said before leaving, he stopped at the door and turned to look at John. "And because Sherlock Holmes is a great man, and I think one day, if we're very, very lucky, he might even be a good one." And then he left. John sat at the desk wondering why Sherlock had gotten into the cab. And then it clicked. It was the cabbie!
"Show me the security footage." Sherlock ordered. This wasn't just any graffiti. It was a lot of trouble to get in here undetected just to graffiti a wall and portrait. Sebastian growled before turning and leading them back to his office, thankfully leaving the office unlocked and open. Once back in his office, Sebastian quickly signed into his computer and pulled up the security footage. The footage was a still frame taken every sixty seconds. And the culprit wasn't on any of the cameras.
"Did you see his watch?" Sherlock asked taking John by the hand as they got off the first escalator and began to walk towards the second one.
"You're, um..." She stuttered glancing back at his resume. "Well, you're a bit over-qualified." John refused to believe that her tone had taken a more flirtatious vibe.
"Mrs Hudson, Dr. John Watson." Sherlock introduced and she hugged him just as motherly as she did Sherlock, not bothered at all by his scent. This caused John to relax a little. Since his womb had been damaged no one seemed to treat him the same, they either treated him with pity or as if being near him would cause defect to them. And yet, here were two people who didn't seemed to mind him being broken and treated him as if he weren't. It nearly brought him to tears.
"So, dim sum." John said happy to talk about something that was his relationship with Sherlock, whatever this was.
"I thought bankers were all supposed to be heartless bastards." John joked angrily before they, too, left the bathroom, only they didn't go back to the table like Sebastian, they left the restaurant completely.
"Coming!" She called back. "Stay away from Sherlock Holmes." She told him before jogging into the house. John staid standing there trying to wrap his mind around what the Beta had just told him. Should he believe her or not? It was clear that the Beta hated Sherlock with a passion, as did Anderson. But the Detective Inspector really wouldn't have allowed Sherlock into the crime scene if he wasn't a decent person. He would stay by Sherlock and decide for himself if he wanted to stay with him or not.
"I don't believe we're here for you to try and bully Sherlock, Mr Wilkes." John growled out shocking Sebastian. It was the first time an Omega dared to speak to him like that.
"Today at the bank, sort of a warning." John told the Detective carefully, not knowing if the duel was over or not as Sherlock began to put his scarf on.
"Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?" He called running down the stairs.
"Colleague of mine, Dr Watson." Sherlock said grabbing John's wrist and gently pulled him under the tape. "Dr Watson, Sergeant Sally Donovan. Old friend." Sherlock introduced, hissing out the last two words in a way that John knew was a lie even without the glare Donovan had sent him.
"Almost can." Sherlock corrected pulling John as close to him as her could. "You did get shot, though."
"There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase." The Inspector told him and Sherlock was out the door.
"We don't know a thing about each other." John said with a small smile, he was gaining entertainment from this. "I don't know where we're meeting, I don't even know your name."
"I'm fine, Sherlock, I think I'm just hungry." John reassured him with a smile forcing himself to forget about the pain. It was well into the late afternoon, and he hadn't had anything but some toast for breakfast that morning, having been too nervous about his interview.
"I play the violin when I'm thinking and sometimes I don't talk for days on end." Sherlock informed the obviously very confused Omega. "Would that bother you? Potential flatmates should know the worst about each other." He watched in slight amusement as the Omega took in everything that Sherlock had told him before his eyes began to shift between him and Mike.
"And, what, you couldn't be bothered to walk farther than my chair?" John asked half amused half annoyed. "It's password protected."
Life with someone was different than Sherlock had expected it to be. He had thought that he would have been hiding in his room or running his new flatmate out of the flat to do whatever they would do for the whole day. But, with John, Sherlock always wanted John with him or in the flat within ear shot. He found out very quickly that he loved having John in his arms as they slept and for the past week he had pulled John into his room at night. And though Sherlock didn't sleep much he found watching John sleep at night fascinating.
"Okay." John said taking a bite of his food. Sherlock tore his eyes off John eating and looked out the window to notice a taxi idling in front of the address he had given the murderer.
"We'll follow you." John told him as Sherlock gently pushed him into the taxi. However, they didn't follow Dimmok, they led him to the crime scene. And Sherlock wasted no time in slipping under the tape and up the stairs with John and Dimmok close behind him.
"To somewhere near Piccadilly Station. Dropped the package, delivered it, and then . . ." A receipt for Piazza Espresso Bar Italiano. "Stopped on his way. He got peckish."
"Sherlock," John started nervously and Sherlock's heart lept, was John going to ask Sherlock to buy him something, because he would in a heart beat, "you know I'll pay you back, right?" That hurt, but at the same time, he didn't expect anything less from John. He was an independent person and Sherlock wouldn't change him for the world. "Sherlock, are you listening?"
"I guess that's true if you ignore some evidence." John muttered as Sherlock released him to pace angrily.
Running after Sherlock who was chasing after the taxi they had spotted from Angelo's was not John first idea of a date. But then, when one was possibly with Sherlock, a normal date was too dull. His heart lept into his throat when Sherlock suddenly rolled off the hood of a car that slammed on their breaks just before actually hitting the Alpha. John slid across the hood after Sherlock while apologizing to the owner of the car.
"Anything interesting?" The Alpha asked trying not to sound eager causing John to bite back a smile.
"Know the author?" Sherlock asked gently taking the spray can from John's hands and tossing it into the bag full of spray cans next to the young Omega's feet before taking John's hand into his. The feeling of Sherlock's larger hand against his calmed him down just enough. John looked at Sherlock who was watching the young Omega with a bored look and the young man flipped through the pictures.
"Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?" Sherlock asked. There was a tense silence in the room as Sherlock realized what he said and who he said it to. "Not good?"
"'Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone because no-one else can compete with my massive intellect!'" John yelled angrily from outside. Ignoring him had definitely been a bad idea. Never ignore John. Ignoring John gets you strangled. Sherlock was starting to loose consciousness as the killer loosed his hold, put something in Sherlock's coat pocket, and left. Sherlock took a deep breath and coughed while forcing himself to get up. He checked his pocket to find the same black origami lotus flower that had been in Van Coon's mouth.
Sherlock quickly made his way back up to the trading floor and into the chairman's office and took pictures of the symbols. As he was taking the pictures, he took note of the balcony. He didn't recall seeing that as one of the many doors being monitored. Sherlock opened the balcony door and stepped out onto it. They were on the top floor. It would be difficult to climb up to the balcony. Difficult, but not impossible. Especially if they climbed from another balcony.
pissed John off. "You're quite right. How could you tell? Are you going to tell me there's a stain on my tie from some special kind of ketchup you can only buy in Manhattan?"
"Harry and me don't get on, never have." John informed Sherlock as they made their way to the crime scene. Him and Harry had never seen eye to eye, even before she presented as an Alpha and him as an Omega. And it didn't help when John presented as an Omega and Harry tried to dominate him like the Alpha she was and he put her on her ass. "Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce, and Harry is a drinker." He confirmed and didn't have to look at the Alpha to know he was smirking.
"Don't worry about me, I can manage." John assured him while carrying the bags into the kitchen and setting them down. "Is that my computer?"
"Yes." Sherlock said suddenly sounding defensive. "And I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits on your mobile phone."
"You're a doctor." Sherlock suddenly said causing John to jump in shock not hearing him come back in. "In fact, you're an Army doctor."
"She said..." John started only to stop and look away. Was he trying to gather up the curage or stifle any rage he felt from whatever she had told him. "She said you get off on this. You enjoy it."
"Stop talking." John snapped out causing Sherlock to snap his mouth closed. "It's that shop, over there." He said pointing across the road to a souvenir shop.
"No time for tea this morning," she sighed, slouching slightly. "You have to go. We all do. This place is getting burnt in a couple of minutes,"
As John replayed the moment in his head numerous times, silence fell. Heads were lifted and after that no one moved. John was left to awkwardly turn around in the chair he had been placed. The doorway held a messy Sherlock; hair fluffy, eyes dark, clothes ruffled. He looked as stern as ever, however, figure held straight and proud, hands behind his back. Walking in as if nothing was wrong, he nodded at Molly, who nodded back, and began looking at what was displayed on the table. Awkwardly, people began doing whatever they had before. A young man offered Sherlock coffee, hands shaking as he did so. The detective took it without thanks and began skimming over papers again, leaving the other to stand there awkwardly before excusing himself. Molly grumbled at this.
John grumbled a thank you that he did not mean, putting on Sherlock's oversized grandad jacket. It covered him quite decently, but he still felt uncomfortable, not that Sherlock cared.
At this moment, a heaving noise came from the sitting room. Both heads turned to see John bent over on the floor, throwing up near pure water. Onto the carpet. Sherlock went and dragged him into the bathroom, as John slurred out apology after apology. He then did the same, but this time - thankfully - into the toilet. Sherlock simply pat him on the back and went to asses the mess. He lifted his hands and curved his fingers towards his palm slightly, looking uncertain. He didn’t want a stain on the carpet, nor a lingering smell, but he had no idea how to fix it. Concerning noises were still coming from the bathroom; choking, coughing, spluttering, groaning...
Greg simply shrugged. "I guess it's something that has to happen," Mrs Hudson exclaimed again, giving him a hug and praising him on his bravery. Sherlock huffed at the display of emotion in front of him as John chuckled from behind. "Ah- what do we uh.. do with him?" Greg nodded at John, quite flustered from Mrs Hudson's fussing.
Slowly, he got up. Remembering everything good he'd done for London, and the people. It was in chaos, and he'd given the people order. He'd given them justice. He gave them what they deserved. Now they would all turn on him. But it was just a street. This wasn't all his fault. No one could have predicted that something like this could happen. No one! Not even the great Sherlock Holmes. Shouldn't that mean something? That it was unpredictable, or.. or that...
Mrs Hudson handed Sherlock some sort of cleaning powder. She told him to put it on the mark, get a damp cloth, scrub it, leave it for a while, then use the vacuum to clean it. Sherlock stood there, entirely out of his element, and watched Mrs Hudson grab her coat.
When he looked at the other three again, they took off running. With a startled gasp, he stepped back before chasing them. Two turned into wolves - one brown, the other more of a charcoal shade.
John jumped, his lips curling back and revealing a mouthful of oversized and overly sharp teeth. Sherlock fell backwards, his head hitting the ground with a thud. In the shadows and the gloom a figure scurried away in a blur, followed by another. And another. Bouncing onto his feet, Sherlock watched as John crouched down, his spine showing through the shirt. Growls had been replaced with groans as he struggled not to - or maybe even to - shift.
"John, c'mere. I'm cold." he said through chattering teeth, clutching at his arms. The beast - John - raised his ears and snuffled at the air, seemingly content with something, before shaking himself off like a dog, sending droplets of blood and water flying over the area. Sherlock yelled in protest, making the wolf grin. Padding over on delicate yet gargantuan paws, he curled around the smaller being. He began to lick at dampened curls, but Sherlock swatted him away with a sleepy complaint. John eventually settled, as did Sherlock, and curled in a little ball they spent the night resting - or sleeping, as most would call it.
A shocked silence absorbed the room, mouths gaping open in hopes of saying something. But nothing was quite appropriate. Sherlock decided to clear his throat and adjust his scarf, straightening up at the same time. John was left to tremble as silent tears rolled down his face, while Molly blinked; seemingly frozen, almost.
"But last night wasn't a full moon. That's next week," grumbled Sherlock through gritted teeth. Either John was delusional or this was faked. Or was something else going on here?
Red was added into the mixture of colours in the water - the metallic taste hadn't been heavy metals. It was
"Lestrade, Listen-" hurried Sherlock, staying in place so as not to make it seem as if he'd bolt from the building. "I didn't have anything to do with this. I'd never-"
Bright red hair was quickly becoming dampened by the wind, and the other two were fidgeting - the treetops weren't quite as dense as they were in other areas, leaving less shelter. She held out a clawed hand, head tilting. A smile never crossed her face yet it was as if she were grinning. Looking down at Sherlock; a quickly whitening face in his lap, by now - he nodded, never taking her hand but accepting the invitation. They got up, John clutching onto Sherlock (still) and holding him bridal-style. His head was thrown back quite dramatically, showing off the water droplets that glistened on his neck. Deep curls were shining in the dim light, bouncing along happily. Not wanting his neck to snap, John adjusted the position to support him better.
on the surface, tearing the seams, just hoping to get to the real fabric. It was clawing, making him itch. Sherlock placed a skeletal hand in his hair again, and
Blue lights filled the windows and left Sherlock to stare in awe. Everyone believed he had done this. And that it was his own fault. His life had gone downhill in less than an hour.
Sherlock gave up with dragging and then picked him up, placing him on his chair and hoping that he wouldn't bleed on it. Groggily, the stranger looked around the room.
Deathly bored, he deposited a now empty cup into the sink with a clatter. Mrs Hudson gave him a hiss to be quiet as he slouched back into his chair with a vague smirk crossing delicate lips. Heavy lidded eyes found themselves threatening closure; the great Sherlock Holmes was falling asleep from his lack of interest in whatever was currently going on. Yet suddenly he was jolting up, any signs of sleep gone as a thunderstorm erupted downstairs.
But that smile vanished when John entered the kitchen to grab his wallet. John would see the scratch! How would he react?
"We can't both stare." Sherlock argued before grabbing his coat and scarf and running out the door, pausing long enough for John to catch up before taking off after the taxi as it began to move.
"I'll be borrowing this." John said before rushing out of the Yard and began to follow the Journalist's day as it was written in the diary.
"The murderer has it." John whispered as a flash of fear flew through his eyes. But before Sherlock could even think about calming that fear, it was gone and John was laughing. "I just texted a murderer." The laughter was suddenly gone. "How is he going to react when he gets a text from someone he believes is dead?" Just then the phone rang.
"Right." Sebastian scoffed. "You're doing that thing." He was checking John out again with a condensing smile. "We were at Uni together, and this guy here had a trick he used to do." He was trying to put John off of him. To bad it would work. John
"Why have I got this blanket? They keep putting this blanket on me." John overheard Sherlock complain when Lestrade walked up to him after having done a round of the crime scene.
John was quickly becoming used to the idea that Sherlock was rarely wrong, if ever. It had taken Sherlock less than a minute to look up the correct Van Coon and where he lived. Five minutes after Sherlock found the address they were standing in front of a very posh apartment building in the middle of London. But, after Sherlock had buzzed Van Coon twice with no answer, John feared they had reached a dead end. They couldn't enter the building without either a key or being buzzed in.
The room was silent for a moment; filled with questions but none were spoken. Mouths were opened to say a word, but soon shut for fear of that word being unwanted. John eventually cleared his throat and clutched at crutches, leaning on them quite heavily as he got up.
Last pre-written chapter! I don't know when I'll be posting the next chapter, but hopefully before the end of the week? I dunno. But I hope you enjoy!
Healing was elevated but it didn't mean it didn't hurt, and it didn't mean it would heal in a mere few moments either. More like a few minutes if it wasn't irritated again, but by now it would be closer to an hour. "I don't know why m'.. like this..." his voice trailed off as he gestured vaguely. With an irritated sigh, Sherlock softened his features just a little.
Most people didn't care what he was or wasn't, they were finally safe. No unstable supernatural beings were allowed on ordinary streets, and for those who were perfectly safe, they had justice. All was fair and calm. Crimes were no longer unsolved and the wrong were no longer accused. Speaking of crime, the once common occurrence was now a rare thing to behold. All thanks to one single man. It was quite a miracle, really. Was he a gift from the Heavens? Sent to fix all the wrong that both human and paranormal alike were guilty of? Perhaps. Many thought this perfect reputation would lay unscathed until the day of his death; the man was a miracle, after all.
"Made it back in a week." Sherlock finished before nodding his head at the building across the street. "That's how he made such easy money."
"We're obviously looking at a suicide." Dimmok informed his team who were documenting any evidence in the rest of the apartment.
Movement on the other side of the door caught John's attention. Had Sherlock made it safely into the building? Or was Van Coon actually home? Hoping that it was Sherlock and not Van Coon, John rung the door bell. "Sherlock?" He called out. What was taking him so long to let him in? John couldn't hear any signs of a scuffle so Sherlock wasn't fighting anyone. "Sherlock, are you okay?" He asked when he didn't receive an answer from the Alpha. "Sherlock, if you can hear me, please let me in." John sucked in a breath when he caught what sounded like something crashing open. Was he actually fighting with someone?
"No, it... fine." Sherlock told him giving John an odd look, and John felt as if Sherlock was once again about to scent him, kiss him, or both and he didn't know if he liked the feeling or not.
"That door didn't open last night?" Sherlock asked as Sebastian pulled up last night's logs to show that, no, the door had not opened at all the day before.
"John is right. Suicide is one possible explanation of some of the facts." Sherlock stated and John had to bite his lip to stop the smile that threatened to appear on his face. They were at a crime scene, it was not proper to smile at a crime scene, no matter how amazing Sherlock's deduction skills were. "You've got a solution that you like, but you're choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn't comply with it." Sherlock growled at Dimmok who growled back.
"Who do you thinking I am! No I didn't take it!" John hissed out glaring at him. A strange, warm feeling swept through Sherlock at the knowledge that John was angry and distressed for him. John was angry that anyone would dare to pay some to spy on Sherlock. He was distressed just knowing there was someone out there willing to do just that. Sherlock sighed and, for reasons he couldn't come up with, wrapped his arms around John in a hug, resting his ching on the top of John's head.
"I'm to take you home." Anthea said stepping out of the car. John sighed and pulled out his phone to read his message that was no doubt from Sherlock.
"Brian Lukis, freelance journalist, murdered in his flat. Doors locked from the inside." Sherlock told the Detective before turning the computer around to show him the article.
"Oh, thank you." Sherlock said receiving a slightly shocked look from Mike. Sherlock ignored the look and got up. As he got closer to the Omega, Sherlock took a slight whiff of his scent and noted the 'Broken' smell coming from him. Something happened to this Omega that had caused him to become 'useless' to normal Alphas, something to do with either his heat cycle or his womb. If Sherlock had been a normal Alpha with a desire to find a Mate and reproduce, that scent would have put him off but as it was it didn't bother Sherlock one bit.
"I said could you pass me a pen?" Sherlock growled the second he had stepped into the flat causing John to pause.
"What are you doing?" John asked, and normally Sherlock wouldn't answer a question like that, but seeing as John had asked, it wouldn't hurt to answer him.
"Barely." John muttered causing Sherlock to glance at him before he began to examine Van Coon's fingers.
"An enemy?" John repeated instantly guarded. This man was Sherlock's enemy? If that was true then what did he plan to do with John? Did he believe that kidnapping and/or hurting John would hurt Sherlock?
"Don't even smoke." Sherlock growled before unbuttoning the sleeve of his suit and rolling it up to show Lestrade the nicotine patch.
After having found the pink suitcase not far from the house, Sherlock had raced home and searched the contents not finding the woman's phone or her planner. That meant that the woman had somehow left it on the murderer. Once he had realized that, it didn't take Sherlock very long to find her number. Now all he needed was John to hurry up and get there so that he could continue with his plan to catch the killer.
"Stay there." Sherlock ordered. Once John had heard the door shut, he flew over to the window and watched as Sherlock and the cabbie began to have a conversation as he tried calling the phone. And then, Sherlock got into the taxi.
"Oh." John muttered as Sherlock shot from his place beside him and began to try and rearrange some things. "So this is all...?" John stuttered out.
"May need longer." Sherlock told him, and was John imagining things or had Sherlock just slowed down when he had begun struggling?
"So where are we?" Sherlock asked looking away from John once he was sure he would not ask anymore stupid question.
Sherlock froze. John was upset. And he wasn't upset that there was not food in the flat, this happened about every other week. He was just using that as an excuse to take his anger out on Sherlock. So what had made his John so angry?
John sighed as he finished eating his meal that Sherlock had had delivered from Angilos the second they had gotten back to the house, while watching Sherlock pace in front of the fireplace while skimming a book on languages in his hand. Sherlock growled in annoyance and slammed the book closed.
"I don't know." Sherlock growled out, the thought of John with someone else angered him for reasons he did not want to admit to. Something about John made Sherlock want to be with him. He knew he should hate that, knew he should push John away like he did everyone else that tried to get too close, yet, he couldn't. He wanted John to be close to him. "I just... I don't know. I've never wanted a Mate. Never wanted to get close to anyone. This is new."
"I'm not married, mated, or bonded." John snapped out as he, too, looked around. "Sherlock." Sherlock quickly made his way over to John, and wasn't able to stop himself from taking another deep sniff of John's scent. A strange sort of tingle began to form around his groin. "The label there."
"I call it..." The young man paused in spray painting to take a step back and look at his Sherlock with a flirtatious smirk, "Urban Bloodlust Frenzy." John glared at the young Omega and stepped closer to Sherlock. It didn't seem to matter to John that Sherlock hadn't even seemed to notice the flirtation as he scrolled through his phone. All that mattered to John right now was that he had seen the Young Omega flirting with his Alpha, and John needed to put him in his place.
"Okay. We'll pull you in tomorrow, off you go." Lestrade said and Sherlock rushed over to John, ducking under the tape, and pulled John into a hug after removing the blanket.
"Ah, Anderson. Here we are again." Sherlock growled out. So this was the man that wouldn't work with Sherlock as his assistant?
"What are you doing?" Sherlock growled releasing John's hand and storming over to Lestrade who was lounging in Sherlock's chair as if he owned it.
"Oh, I wouldn't say that." Sherlock said and John's heart jumped, would Sherlock really tell the police it was him?
Sherlock quickly reentered the office, shut the balcony door and exited the office though the door. He shut the office door, it locked automatically. Now, it was time to see where on this floor someone could easily see the symbols. He began going up and down the cubicles. But either a screen or pillar was blocking the symbols from view. And then, in an office off to the side, he found the perfect view, the only view, that allowed him to see both symbols clearly. Whatever those symbols were, they meant for the owner of this office.
"I recognize the paint." He told them. "It's like Michigan hardcore propellant. I'd say zinc." The young Omega said looking up from the phone to stare at John and Sherlock's clasped hands with a blank look.
"I don't think this can wait. Sorry, Sebastian." Sherlock growled out, turning to glare at him. "One of your traders, someone who worked in your office, was killed."
"Well, I'm afraid they don't see it like that. And neither does my boss. I hired you to do a job. Don't get sidetracked." He ordered before shoving Sherlock out of the way and exited the bathroom.
"I know it will work, we used to have to do this all the time when we first moved in." John reassured her. It was silent from her side of the intercom for a long minute as John held his breath hoping she believed them and let them in.
"I've known him for five years, and no, I don't. Didn't even know he was interested in mating anyone." Lestrade said and John had to fight a blush.
After lunch, Sherlock would finally emerge from his mind palace before checking his e-mails for cases. He would spend the next few hours sitting in his chair solving boring cases that he didn't need to be there to solve as John sat across from him in his chair looking for work. Around dinner time Sherlock would have John order whatever he wanted and they would eat, well, John would eat and Sherlock would nibble to keep John from gripping at him. And then at night after John had showered and changed, Sherlock would lead him to their room and hold him all night.
"I don't need an incentive, Sebastian." Sherlock growled out before storming away, he had a mystery to solve, and it wasn't how the person broke in. What Sherlock was more interested in was why? What were those symbols? Who were they for? And what did they mean?
"I reckon he would have been perfect." Sherlock muttered. "Businessman, making frequent trips to Asia. Lukis was the same, a journalist writing about China. Both of them smuggled stuff about. The Lucky Cat was their drop-off."
"Well, we've got two away on holiday this week and one's left to have a baby." She squeaked out tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. John looked at her wondering what she was meaning by that. "It might be a bit mundane for you." That caused John to chuckle. Having something mundane to ground you every now and then was good when you were with Sherlock.
Sherlock quickly made his way to the door so he could leave before John could tell him to piss off like all the others did. He opened the door and was half way out of the room before he remembered John had initially wanted his name and the address. "The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street." And with a wink, Sherlock flew out of the room and back towards the morgue.
"There wasn't a case." The Inspector told Sherlock who had knelt down to examine the woman again. This news caused Sherlock to shoot back up with an excited look in his eyes.
"You were thinking. It's annoying." Sherlock growled out. He stared at the body for a couple of seconds before kneeling down and rubbed a hand across the woman's back and examined his fingers. Sherlock quickly searched the woman and pulled out a white umbrella from her left pocket. He checked the collar of her jacket before pulling out a magnifying glass and began checking her left wrist and hand. John tilted his head in slight confusion when Sherlock took off the woman's Bonding ring and began to examine it before slipping it back on to her finger.
"What are we?" John asked suddenly, "Because you obviously called a head of time, before I got there and reserved this table for us, with me as your date. Yet, you don't want a Mate. I'm telling you now, Sherlock, one of these days I want to find a Mate that can over look my-"
"Yes." The man drawled out in a slight purr, John's hackles rose when he caught the mockery undertone. "The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think? What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?"
John sighed and chased after him to find he already had a taxi waiting, how the Alpha always managed to get a taxi amazed him. Sherlock had obviously already told the cabbie where to go, because the second John shut the door behind him, they were off. John was curious as to where they were going, but kept that question to himself after seeing Sherlock deep in thought. John's question was answered when they pulled up to the West Kensington Library. John followed Sherlock into the building and to the second floor.
"Two men have been murdered, Raz. Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them." Sherlock told him. Raz looked from the phone to at both Sherlock and John in disbelief.
"Yes, you do." John told him and noted a wide smile on the Alpha's face. "What are you so happy about?"
"Sherlock." John growled out from the kitchen, his tone of voice instantly snapping Sherlock out of his mind palace. Had he not put a body part in his designated spot in the fridge again? He shot up into a sitting position, intending to rush into the kitchen to save whatever body part John was fixing to throw out, when John stormed into living room. "There's no food in this flat!" John told him angrily. "Why isn't there any food?"
he hissed to himself. Now was not the time for self pity. Kicking off his shoes, he began flailing; fighting to the surface. There were slight shockwaves in the water, as well as a minor wave. John must have hit the water nearby - but where was he? Had he passed out? Shit. If that had happened, they were both indefinitely dead.
Mrs Hudson opened the door and gave a gasp. Sherlock was holding John, who was now wrapped up in a blanket, but still rather soaked. She quickly let them inside and lit a fire, then gathered some towels for John. Shakily, he thanked her, teeth chattering. Sherlock went to the kitchen to make some tea, and Mrs Hudson followed.
Molly was busy showing things to John, having heard he'd been in the military and had done some detective work himself after that, before becoming a doctor. He seemed quite keen, looking at the way windows had been broken, if there were any claw marks, signs of struggle on the few photos of bodies they had... he was quite helpful, really. And being a witness he described what he'd seen; a midnight beast with muscled limbs and dense fur. He'd also noticed the fur was matted and there seemed to be wounds beneath - possibly infected from the smell it held. Drool dribbled from it's muzzle, breathing was harsh and ragged; it hadn't seemed healthy. But that hadn't left it helpless. It ravaged through everything; windows, walls, doors, people... it just kept going.
When he raised his head he saw their expressions had softened. There was some sort of a calming scent in the air - sweet and floral - and he quickly realised it was coming from
By this time, John was numb. Fingers were nonexistent and legs felt like chunks of flesh. He tried his best to listen but his head felt both heavy and light, and eyelids were quickly failing him. Everything had gone somewhat gloomy to him as edges of vision faded away. Hearing had turned to an echo and was only worsening the feeling he’d pass out in the water.
Panting, he lowered his head so that they couldn't see the way he'd scrunched it up, and the way blood was trickling from his mouth. A faint muttering of their native tongue was to be heard again - the word 'blaidd' feeling oddly familiar - and they shuffled closer again. They no longer felt threatening, but that didn't stop him from holding Sherlock away. They'd shot him with some sort of poisoned arrow, for God's sakes! Who
Johns face reddened behind his hands, moving his fingers so that his eyes were visible. They widened in horror.
Molly? Oh dear. Sherlock and Molly... they had history. As he did with Irene. They had gone further, however, but things ended messily one drunken night when Sherlock had admitted to preferring the vampire. No words had been spoken between them since. Unaware to himself, Sherlock had gulped and gone quite pale. Quizzically, John had raised an eyebrow, but not questioned the look on his face. Brushing curls back from his face, Sherlock tried sitting up again. It wasn't as dizzying of an experience like last time, so he stayed upright.
"Slightly feverish," he muttered truthfully, feeling almost ashamed at expressing weakness. "But I believe that's from the cold, not from the water. I made sure not to swallow it in excess amounts." A slight pause followed. "What about you?"
Greg had no true choice but to oblige. Sherlock's wrists were trapped in cold icy rings of confinement, and John was simply dragged along behind. He was beginning to gain a right state of mind once again, but wasn't good enough to wonder where he was going. Camera's flashed their bright sunlight into passing eyes as both men were shoved into a police vehicle. Greg was given more praise by officers, who struggled to keep the crowd away from the car. Beside him, John whimpered pitifully. It was quite an animalistic sound.
"Better. Next time maybe, use your eyes, though?" John looked down at the crutches, then at his bandaged leg. Sherlock turned his head away, embarrassed. Hobbling away, John chuckled. The detective was well known, but no one had ever seen pictures of him looking embarrassed. He'd have something to brag about once this was all over.
Mortified, John whimpered and pushed him away. "You... dick! Bloody bastard! Why would you cuddle with me when I'm
”John, what happened?!” asked Sherlock, shouting again. Lestrade placed a hand on his shoulder and said he should take him home before questioning him. Fair enough. He was freezing, still coughing, and looked as pale as a corpse. Which he had seen many of.
Mrs Hudson returned to the house late that night; a round of bingo had ended in a fight between her and a new member. The old hag had dared to cheat in her field of view!
Wouldn't go away; why had it happened so quickly? With no time to adjust? Just... one second he had a life and now
Blurs of green swirled around as he tried seeing who was there again, catching glimpses of people he lost mere moments later. From the corner of his eye he saw someone holding something, pulling it back and-
John took it and sipped it delicately. It certainly wasn’t the best tea he’d ever had, but it was comforting. And it gave him a little buzz that the Sherlock Holmes had made him tea, and was now taking care of him. A triumphant smile creeped along his face at the thought. “Thanks Sherlock,”
His temperature was elevated, teeth oversized, and there was somewhat of a dull ache vibrating through his body. But compared with what he felt last night? "I'm fine."
Cameras flashed in his eyes and blinded him, reporters shoved microphones in his face. Sobbing families screamed abuse as people opened their news channels right at his doorstep. Newspapers were thrown at his head, and in blurs he read snatches of bold print. Quickly he realised this was not just one street.
And yet, with the grace of a cat, he leapt back and pointed his arms like a streamlined swimmer, before diving out of the death-trap. John's breath caught in his throat. His heart began to race, fighting against his ribcage for freedom. The dark that invaded his vision was replaced by
badly?!" he spun around with a contorted face, eyebrows pinched in annoyance. "The noise is giving me a headache. I can't take it anymore, John!"
Holding the now unconscious Sherlock on his lap, John snarled at the three strangers that approached them. Wild matted hair with bright highlighter eyes and mud streaked cheeks accompanied by clothes of pelt tacked together with string got closer, peering at them with tilted heads. A bow was held in one's paws, arrows wrapped in leaves and sticking from a pack on his back. The furthest away from them gave a sharp toothed snarl, face contorting with the effort. They were quickly silenced by a returned snarl from the woman at front, who turned her attention back to John. They took next to no notice of Sherlock.
Now in cuffs, the man was shoved into the police car. Lestrade looked rather smug and proud; finally catching his own criminal! But alas, Sherlock and John had helped and would probably be getting most if not all of the credit. For now, he could appreciate the work he had done.
John and Sherlock seemed to be friends by now. They worked together, finding clues and making theories. So long as the subject of Mary was avoided, all was well between them. Another thing to note was that his leg had healed startlingly well and startlingly
John shook his head, giving a shaky sigh. Outside the gloomy weather was no comfort, a steady drizzle slowly evolving to a downpour. Sherlock decided not to press it, and just left him alone. Perhaps that was the first mistake of the night.
”It’s bingo night, silly!” she giggled. “Just look after John. Give him some nice tea, some soup, keep him warm, and clean up that awful mess!”
John's nightmare returned to his mind in startlingly vivid detail. He was a wolf - as he was last night, not an actual wolf - and, surprisingly, he wasn't killing anyone. He was stuck transforming; when he thought it was over he turned
Sherlock gathered a few remaining papers from the table before they were snatched away. "Most other corpses have been identified and seen. There is absolutely no record of Mary's. And John never saw her dead. He simply assumed she was. And might I add," he showed Molly a certain picture. It was gloomy with bad lighting, but even then you could tell there was- "Hardly any blood. John identified it as his own home. Seeing as all the other attacks were so brutal, we could tell it wouldn't hold any respect nor caution for a pregnant woman. Blood would be smeared all over the walls and-"
"Molly," he croaked. "It's... nice to see.. you?" he mumbled, at quite a loss for words. The detective wasn't quite sure as to what was appropriate at this time. Molly gave a hum, turning to send him a glaring glance as she walked somewhere more comfortable. A ponytail bobbed along with her, far friendlier than the head it lay on.
John. Staying warm would be more accurate. And you're the one who seemed blissfully unaware of your lack of clothing, anyway. And you aren't
warm and fluffy, but with the same damp feeling as him. Looking up, he saw a familiar unamused face accompanied by a muzzle, grey with age but matted with patches of dirty blonde. Dark red was caked around the nose and just... all over, to be honest. Clothes were torn, hardly covering much. Sherlock found his cheeks turning red when he realised what -
Early hours of the morning left the birds chirping at Sherlock's window as he sipped a cup of tea. Mrs Hudson was babbling away on the phone to one of her old lady friend. The night previous had been her weekly Bingo night, and there had been some argument over cheating. Such a mundane thing made him roll his eyes and toss dark curls in an unimpressed manner. Icy blue eyes stared at the mist that hung from his window as he gave a wistful sigh. Cases had been quite scarce recently, and involved no true skill to solve.
The woman at the front crouched down. She smelt of dew, river water and grass; strangely comforting. Another smell lingered about her, and it was on the other two as well - but he couldn't identify it. "Are you alone, cub?"
Couldn't they just appreciate the work he'd done? The hardships he had faced all for them? No! A mass murder meant he could never be trusted with anything ever again. The people were all so.. so selfish! The handle was cold in his hands. A sharp clicking was to be heard as his hands trembled and opened the door.
"It was a werewolf," John repeated, his face firm. "It threw me through a window. People can't do that,"
“Would you like some tea? I made some,” he blurted, not wanting John to fall asleep just yet. He needed fluids after he’d discarded all he had previously.
Sherlock Holmes, a young boy, had risen from the shadows and assessed various cases. His supernatural studies left every dangerous beings behind bars. A fine eye for detail meant that the difference between faked and true crimes by creatures of the night. Recent years left many officers stumped; was this a paranormal or human crime? Holmes could tell right away.
Soon, they had managed to drop back down to street level where they ran down alley after alley. At the end of one alley, John saw the taxi drive by them. "Oh! This way!" Sherlock ordered and John followed. After more alleys, Sherlock ran out of an alley and into the street right in front of the taxi causing it to slam on it's breaks. "Police! Open her up." Sherlock growled pulling out a badge from his coat pocket.
"That's true, he was a bad cabbie." Sherlock said wrapping an arm around John's waist and began leading him away from the crime scene. "You should have seen the route he took us to get here." He joked and John began to giggle.
"Those symbols at the bank, the graffiti, why were they put there?" Sherlock asked as he began to examine the body.
"You have an intermittent tremor in you left hand. Your therapist thinks it's post-traumatic stress disorder. She thinks you're haunted by memories of your military service." The man said.
to pay attention to your surroundings when you walk?" John snapped at him alerting Sherlock that John was pissed.
"It's a 15." John said as they stopped at a vendor along the road. "What we thought was the artist's tag, it's a number 15."
"You're the second person to say that to me today." Mike said still chuckling. That shocked John. There was someone else out there who was having trouble finding someone to live with? Were they just as broken as him? His curiosity had peeked enough that he couldn't stop himself from asking who it was. At that Mike smiled mischievously. "He's an unusual Alpha that claims to not want a mate, Omega or otherwise."
"Sherlock?" John called again. Something wasn't right, he was positive that the phone had not been in the flat before. He had texted it and whoever had the phone called back. So why was the phone now in the flat?
"This is his hunting ground. Right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go. Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?" Sherlock asked.
"You said you could identify a software designer by his tie and an airline pilot by his left thumb?" John questioned.
"Says the man at the door." Sherlock said just before someone knocked on the door confusing John. After receiving a gentle nudge from Sherlock towards the door, John walked over to the door and opened it to find Angelo standing there holding his cane. It was then that John realized he hadn't been limping or using his cane since they began chasing the taxi.
"Yeah." John said distractedly before he realized what he had said. "Wait, what? But we just... we're..."
"That wasn't just me." John said as Sherlock rested his cheek on top of his head. "Why aren't we back at the restaurant?"
"I can't afford London on an Army pension." John informed him trying to keep his eyes from drifting over to a young family walking in the park with their children. Something he would never get to do.
"This is an old friend of mine, John Watson." Mike introduced. Sherlock carefully took the phone from John instantly noticing the tan did not go past his wrist and began to send his text.
"How are we going to figure out that cipher?" John asked, not wanting to distract Sherlock from The Work.
"New Breitling. Only came out this February." Sherlock said and smirked when John breathed out his amazement.
"Of course we'll be needing two." John said slightly confused. He was only going to be Sherlock's flatmate. John was pretty sure Mike had told him that Sherlock wasn't looking for a Mate, and well, John was broken and no Alpha would want him any way. John angrily pushed that thought from his mind as his hand began to twitch.
"So's Sergeant Donovan." Sherlock pointed out causing Donovan to look scandalized while Anderson whipped around to look at her in shock and, was that fear? "Ooh... I think it just vaporized." Sherlock said while taking a deep breath. "May we go in?"
"Okay." John panted out after they had stepped into the safety of 221B Baker Street. "That was ridiculous. That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done." John said resting against the wall. He looked over at Sherlock when he rested against the wall with his shoulder touching John's.
"She was writing Rachel?" The Inspector asked and even John was shocked that he hadn't figured that one out.
"Why did they die, Sherlock?" John asked, hoping that Sherlock had figured it out already. Sherlock shook his head before tapping his finger on the picture of the first cipher.
"Sherlock, there's no case!" The Inspector called back to him as John limped out of the room to find Sherlock stopped on the stairs.
to be taken care of as an Omega. Sherlock sat down and took John's hand, sending a silent message to Sebastian that John was off limits.
"I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at. What happened?" Mike asked. Annoyance flew through John, it was painfully obvious what had happened!
"I could be wrong, but I think that's none of your business." John snapped out receiving an amused look from the man.
"I need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes. A man's alibi depends on it. Text me." Sherlock told her barely looking at her.
"It's an experiment!" He growled out and John made a mental note to bleach the microwave once the experiment was done.
"I did." Sherlock said as he gathered his jacket. "I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for." He said slipping on his jacket. "Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap." He told John while putting on his scarf.
"Yes, where is it?" Sherlock demanded and began to look around the room once more. "She must have had a phone or an organizer. Find out who Rachel is."
"I'm not a psychopath, Anderson." Sherlock growled. "I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do you research." He then turned his attention to Lestrade. "You need to bring Rachel in, you need to question her. I need to question her."
"Right, how about we get some coffee and catch up?" Mike asked unsure. John was torn, part of him wanted to be alone and mope about what had happened to him while the other half was afraid of what he would do to himself if he were alone.
"I'm not implying anything. I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat," Sherlock said gently taking a hold of John's wrist again and began to lead him around Anderson, John saw him glance at Sally's knees, "and just happened to stay over." Sherlock paused just inside the door, he gently pushed John further into the building before addressing the two Betas again. "And I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees." With that said, Sherlock closed the door and walked passed John and further into the house.
John stood over the dead body of Edward Van Coon. Van Coon had been an Alpha and, from the evidence, had taken his own life. John didn't miss the fact that had he not met Sherlock weeks ago, this would have been him. John took a shaky breath as Sherlock returned to the room slipping on forensic gloves. "Do you think he lost a lot of money? I mean suicide is pretty common among the city boys." He said only to receive a hard look from Sherlock. Had he said something wrong? Statistically, speaking, people who live closer to the middle of London do take their lives more than those who don't.
"I know you're an Army doctor. And you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you've got a brother who's worried about you but you won't go to him for help 'cause you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic and more likely because he recently walked out on his Mate." John's eyes widen slightly at that. "And I know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid." John shifted uncomfortably as if just remembering his bad leg. "That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?" Sherlock asked stopping himself from mentioning the damaged womb having a feeling his flatmate wouldn't like that. It kind of shocked him that the thought of John being upset with him actually caused him to stop deducing John, usually how people felt about his deductions didn't matter to him.
John went into Doctor mode. He took a deep breath and noticed that she was not actually an Omega, but a Beta hiding her scent and using Omega based products to smell like one. But other than that there was no other smells. He glanced up at Sherlock who was watching him. Was this a test? It was obvious that this woman had taken poison, she was the fourth suicide victim. John checked her skin and noticed no discolorization. If this was a test, what was he supposed to find that hadn't already been mention in the papers? After checking everything he could think of, John looked over at Sherlock.
"The bullet they just dug out of the wall's from a handgun. A kill shot over that distance, from that kind of weapon. That's a crack shot we're looking for. But not just a marksman, a fighter. His hands couldn't have shaken at all, so clearly he's acclimatized to violence. He didn't fire until I was in immediate danger, though, so strong moral principle. You're looking for a man probably with a history of military service," And then Sherlock was looking at him, realization in his eyes, "and nerves of steel..." When John saw that Sherlock understood he had shot the man he looked away from the Alpha, but with an ear still in the conversation. "Actually, do you know what? Ignore me." John's heart speed up at that, Sherlock was protecting him.
Sherlock showed John the note before unfolding the envelope the see that it had come from the National Antiquities Museum. "We could start with this."
On the door of the office Sherlock found the nameplate 'Edward Van Coon' (worked the Hong Kong trade) and took it. He needed to speak with this Van Coon as soon as possible. He had all that he needed here. It was time to leave and find Van Coon.
"So, when you say you're concerned about him, you actually are concerned?" John asked and Sherlock growled in annoyance.
"Just in." Molly told him eager to please him. "67, natural causes. Used to work here. I knew him, he was nice." Sherlock zipped the body bag back up before straightening up. This body would do.
"Upstairs." The Inspector told him. After both Alpha's waited for John to finish putting on the suit, they began to walk away. John followed after them as quick as he could limp and nearly screamed in annoyance when they began heading up three flights of stairs. "I can give you two minutes."
"Why did you get into the cab?" John muttered catching everyone's attention. "He just got into a cab."
"And the killer doesn't know which of them took it so he threatens them both. Right." John said. Sherlock looked out the window, ready to wait for John to finish his drink when he noticed a phone book sitting on a door step still in its package to keep it from being rained on.
"These words exactly. 'What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. 22 Northumberland St. Please come.'" Sherlock recited.
Suddenly the four walls of his small one room apartment began to close in on him, and John needed to leave his apartment right then. As quickly as he could, John stood up and grabbed his cane before he limped out of his apartment, locked the door, and took a walk. As he walked he forced everything from his mind.
"I got shot." John said through clenched teeth and his response was Mike awkwardly looking away, and that eased the annoyance in John a little.
"Her daughter?" Sherlock asked removing his nose from John's hair, but still held on to him. "Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?"
"No, you didn't." John said laughing. "That's how you get your kicks, isn't it? You risk your life to prove you're clever."
Sherlock quickly located John patiently waiting for him by the elevators. "Let's go, John." He said taking him gently by the wrist and lead him into the elevators. The ride down was silent as Sherlock began to try and figure out the puzzle. When the door opened him and John exited and began heading for the first set of escalators.
"It's been here since Monday." Sherlock muttered before standing up and ringing the doorbell, taking note of the name on the label: Soo Lin Yao. When no one answered Sherlock started down the alley to the back of the apartment with John following him. "No one's been in that flat for at least three days."
"Of course she's not." Sherlock growled out in annoyance as he began to look something up on his phone. "She's from out of town though. Intended to stay in London for one night before returning home to Cardiff." He said putting his phone away. "So far, so obvious."
"Is that what?" Sherlock challenged wanting to see how John would react to an Alpha's challenge. Most Omega's would instantly back down and cower away, but John just squared his shoulders and raised his chin in defiance to either his own biology or to Sherlock's challenge he didn't know. But it interested him.
"Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?" The man asked in a tone that had John looking at him.
"It's good news for breathing." John muttered and Sherlocke rolled his eyes while groaning at that cliche answer, he knew John could do better than that.
"I'm just going to get us some food, Sherlock. I'll be back." John told him before peeking him on the lips. "What's this case you've been offered."
"You'll need to wear one of these." He ordered motioning to a forensic suit laying on a table next to Detective Inspector Lestrade.
John finally shook himself out of his stupor and moved to sit down. His leg was suddenly bothering him and he needed to sit and rest it. "I looked you up on the Internet last night." John informed Sherlock who spun around to look at him with barely hidden excitement.
"You had a row with a machine?" Sherlock asked tensing up. Mycroft had known about the fight happening in the flat and had tampered with the machine to keep John out longer, but that had caused John anger to rise. Sherlock bit back a growl at that. Mycroft needed to keep his nose out of their lives.
"Remind me. When was the last time that it rained?" Sherlock asked before shooting from his seat, forcing John to do so too (causing John to spill his drink onto himself), and ran outside, pulling John with him. Sherlock didn't let go of John's hand until they were at the door the phone book sat at. Sherlock ran his thumb along the ruined pages from the whole in the packaging.
It was John's daily routine to wake up, use the loo, dress, and then pull out his gun and decide if he would be using it on himself today or not. With another sigh, John picked up his gun and began to dismantle and clean it. It wasn't his wound that had caused a trimmer in his hand that ruined his surgery career, nor was it the fact that he was no longer a soldier that caused him to decide every morning wither to eat a bullet or not. It was the fact that some how during the time between the snipper's bullet entered his shoulder to waking up after surgery his womb had been damaged to the point that the chances of him being able to conceive were next to none.
"Not interested." Sherlock told him closing his book and noticing that the swordsman's sword was sticking too far out. He quickly used the hill of his shoe to push it farther under his chair before John could see it. "I sent them a message." He said with a proud smirk. And then John noticed the scratch. Sherlock had to force himself to remain calm as he waited for John's reaction. But all he did was sigh in annoyance while running his finger along the scratch.
"Think about what Sebastian told us. About Van Coon, about how he stayed afloat in the market." Sherlock said.
"Van Coon was left-handed." Sherlock stated before trying to contort himself as he mimicked trying to shoot himself with his left hand on the right side of his head. "Requires quite a bit of contortion." He taunted.
"Password!" Sherlock looked at him. "It's her password. Rachel is her password." Sherlock's face lit up.
"Since our first meeting." Sherlock told him quietly. John gave a humorless laugh at that. Of course Sherlock had known since then. Probably deduced it the same time he deduced everything else about him. A thought cut into his fear. Sherlock had known all along that it was his damaged womb that made him broken, and still wanted to be with him. Going so far as to break the vow he had made himself to never take a Mate. John stepped forward and rested his forehead on Sherlock's chest. "John, I just want you to know, I don't care if your womb is damage. It's not your womb I'm interested in, it's you." Sherlock whispered to him as he wrapped his arms around John.
"Uh, any problems, just let us know." John said after he had stopped laughing. He shut the taxi door before walking over to Sherlock who was waiting for him. "Basically just a cab that happened to slow down."
"You took your time." Sherlock muttered as John began to look around the room. John knew something was off in the flat. Sherlock stopped himself from tensing up.
"Uh, Baker Street. 221B Baker Street. But I need to stop off somewhere first." John told Anthea as he limped back to the car.
"Stop right there. I am in no mood to hear someone bad mouth Sherlock. Yes, he can be annoying. Yes, he is full of himself. And yes, he's smarter than you lot. Now, can you hurry up and just give me his damn journal." John snapped out shocking the Alpha.
"'Harry Watson.' Clearly a family member who's given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man's gadget. Could be a cousin, but you're a war hero who can't find a place to live. Unlikely you've got an extended family, certainly not one you're close to. So brother it is. Now, Clara, who's Clara?" Sherlock asked looking back at the engraving. "Three kisses says it's a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says Mate, not girlfriend. Must have given it to him recently. This model's only six months old. Bond is in trouble then, six months on he's just given it away. If she'd left him, he would have kept it. People do. Sentiment." He said growling the last word.
"A fourth?" Mrs Hudson asked as someone ran up the stairs and into their flat. A Bonded Alpha with short graying hair.
Sherlock prided himself on being able to control his baser instincts. He knew he could be in the presents of an Omega in heat and not succumb to the desire to mount them and mate them. He knew this because he had tested this. Sherlock had willingly entered a room with an Omega in heat, alone, and had absolutely no desire to mate with them. He had only done so to prove a point to his brother that he, in no way, desired a Mate.
That news had shattered Johns hopes and dreams. Ever since John had presented as an Omega he had two dreams. The first one, being a Doctor in the military, had come true. But the second one that had sat on the back burner while he was a doctor in the military was to find his Alpha and start a family. And now, John closed his eyes to fight back his tears, now that would never happen.
"It's murder, all of them. I don't know how. But they're not suicides. They're killings, serial killings." Sherlock said before looking like a little boy about to open his presents on Christmas day and continued down the stairs. "We've got a serial killer. Love those. There's always something to look forward to."
"Oh he can hurt you, but he won't." Sherlock growled out and became annoyed when John's distress and anger refused to leave. Sherlock looked at John again, what was it that was distressing and upsetting John so much? And then he saw it. "He offered you money to spy on me." John's distress and anger rose.
