“Mrs. Hudson, I have to cancel the invite to Mary, for tonight’s dinner,” John blurted out, seeing no other way to stop digressing from the task at hand.
William Holding walked down to the house of his friend, someone he was deeply fond of. Two years ago when he had come down to stay with his brother and sister in law, he had met Marlene at the church and found out, to his pleasant surprise, that she lived very close to his house. Since then the best two days of his week were those when he met his dear friend and neighbor for walks and chats and a cup of tea.
in one of those known ehm, places….I’d say one of the infamous places, one of those dens where you normally find all the-the….the…..addicts and substance abusers.”
“Oh-Oh-Jawn,” Sherlock arched his back, his mind confused as to whether he should fuck John’s fist or push back on his cock as he was pleasured both ways. “Give it to me,” John commanded, “Daddy’s orders, follow it or you’ll have a spanked bottom.”
John resisted doing a facepalm. Sherlock’s bedroom door was wide open and it didn’t need any genius to figure out the bed wasn’t slept in. Great, now mamma Holmes will also assume we are a couple and we sleep together, share a bed for reasons other than sleeping…..
“Oh no, you’re done for the day because from now on you don’t have to do anything but the surgeries assigned to you. Maybe post-operative checkups can also be done but no more than that. Consultation and any trauma/emergency work can be taken over by Dr. Xu and Dr. Patel.”
Greg was taken aback and quickly answered, “Mary, Mary Morstan Warwick. She and I have been in touch for three months, ever since she returned with her husband from Turkey. She told me quite a few things that made me realize you had always been innocent and the fault lay with John’s cousin Sebastian and his boyfriend Jim Moriarty. They were in this together and duped you and John.”
“Yeah. In the pine forest upslope. He took me to some places which were….. simply enthralling. But none as breathtaking and thrilling as his presence, company and gorgeousness. You know John, the moment I set my eyes on him I knew this was the man for me. I have to be his and he has to be mine, there is simply no other option. I can tell you with confidence that I will NEVER marry anyone if this doesn’t work out.”
“Mummy this is serious. He stole seven hundred pounds. And guess what he did with the money? He bought THE mountain bike, the racing bike with gears that daddy promised him for Christmas. He couldn’t wait, I guess.”
Jim had nothing to say. He wanted to protest but then Sebastian dove downwards and took his cock into his hot mouth, his lubed fingers touched his hole, and whatever protests he had mustered up simply died on his lips. A loud moan came from him and his shapely, gymnast’s legs fell apart in a silent gesture of surrender.
“You see Sherlock,” Sebastian’s shark-like grin was back, “I am in need of money. Not everyone in the family is rich. But I was born rich and have acquired expensive hobbies and exclusive tastes. Therefore I need money to sustain them. The money I make from my pension, my books and my work as a shooting team’s coach for the Olympics, it’s peanuts. I spend it all in a week.”
“Yes, that it is. I agree they are young lives. But lives have been lost. We mustn’t forget that. We must remember that we don’t have a lot of time. If we don’t take action now, death will do a rumba here in this village over the next week.”
The murderer turned out to be the housekeeper, a lady who was with them for almost ten years now, and she had been arrested. But a motive had not been established yet and the murder weapon not discovered. The case was on very flimsy grounds and she could get away with it if sufficient evidence hadn’t been presented before the court.
“Seems the payment is good and she will appreciate it,” Sherlock admitted, “Better than the ring. So I guess I’ll have to announce that the ring is lost then! But, I must say this was a damned good move….. For a few moments I thought I was the turkey tonight, totally stupid.”
When he re-entered the flat, the spot occupied by Sherlock was empty. Exhaustion must have finally made him hit the sack. “Hey,” he called out, “I’ll clean the room in the morning, okay?”
With an unsteady, shaky release of breath he said, “At least won’t you allow me to explain? Won’t you let me tell you my side of the story. Every story has two sides and you’re only going by what you’ve seen, whatever has been told to you by a set of papers and documents.”
“They don’t even mention the two men who loved them, probably the most,” Sebastian’s deeo voice faltered slightly as he read it out. “Don’t read anymore, we know more than them anyways,” John said in a disinterested tone.  They sat listlessly on two patio chairs before Mrs. Hudson’s house. They were staying there now. In two or three days the funerals would be over and they’d leave.
“No, you said something very similar to what my mother used to say. She was a very enterprising lady, very socially active, a philanthropist at heart, full of compassion and ideas and rarely ever relaxed and laidback. Energy was her main propellant, her quirky ideas the secondary engine she lived by and sometimes I struggled to keep up with the way she used to surge ahead with her plans and actions.”
“Oh yes, Mycroft Holmes, who happens to be the most powerful man in this continent, not just England,” the pepper and salt haired senior surgeon said, his eyes and voice showing the due respect for Mycroft’s chair, “I know you are his intended brother in law but at least ask me first, go through the proper channels once, then take matters to him. He called me to say you are working on some matters of national security, affairs that are endorsed and supported by Her Majesty the Queen! From today onwards you are not an ordinary employee of the hospital but an honorary member of our staff. You will be on our rolls but the rules that apply to regular surgeons won’t apply to you at all. Without any loss of pay or any changes whatsoever, I shall redraft your employment contract to give you more flexibility and a higher number of days off work and duties.”
“We cannot let our personal prejudices affect our judgement. I know that boy for years. Yes, he is a bit weird but he is definitely not what you think he is. Coincidences cannot be the base of our suspicions and deductions. Remember, this is no ordinary crime but premeditated murder, if indicted and tried and sentenced then the killer will get the chair or lifetime in prison with no parole allowed. I suggest you stop shooting arrows in the dark.”
“Oh hello Thomas,” he greeted him cheerfully, “I wanted to thank you for being a great support and for being a-a-a….. I am sure you add some value in some way so…. Here is some money. It’s for you, it’s not a payment, it’s sort of a reward….”
On their bliss filled holiday, John suffers from the stress of repeated flashbacks of a forgotten life. Would Sherlock's biggest and most devoted admirer become the biggest threat to his life?
“I already am. Sorry Mycroft, not that I am supposed to tell you of the events of my private life, but this I certainly would have shared. It happened suddenly and I had other priorities. The reason I had requested your presence was because I wanted to make some changes to my will and also transfer some of my properties…..”
“Yes, a date,” John replied and started telling Sherlock about Janet, the way the nurse went the extra mile for him earlier and how she had later become rather sullen and rude towards him, ever since he missed the date and the next date was never planned. He then got up and went to his closet, showed Sherlock the shirt Carrie had given him, showed him her social media picture and told him about his intention to meet the woman at a downtown pub and spend the evening with her.
“No, what’s wrong with you Jawn? This is me, Sherlock. Your Sherl. When did I ever harm you or your family? You’re mistaken…..”
Well, it wouldn’t hurt, John thought as he quietly slipped out and headed straight for the narrow alley behind he establishment. As promised, Ivan was there smoking a cigarette. He smiled broadly and said, “You’re a generous tipper. You also seem like a good man.”
The words were spoken in a shaky voice but the look in Sherlock’s eyes was synonymous with trust and love, a complete surrender!
that accommodation thing John. It’s too far from Barts and if there are emergencies you won’t be able to make it on time. We could assign a quarter for you but at this moment none are free. However, there is something else we can do for you…..or rather, I can do for you. Someone I know is looking for a roommate.”
“Always. But that doesn’t mean I let you miss out on an opportunity to make some more dough. See, for him it’s peanuts. At any given point of time he would have at least five million in the house, hard cash, plus loose diamonds and trinkets that are worth double that amount. Giving you two or three hundred more is no problem at all, provided you remain honest at all times, sincere in your duties and don’t get nosy.”
“With all due respect sir,” Harry spoke to them in a lucid, firm tone, “If these were merely pranks and people were only getting jump-scares, then whatever you said was possible – counseling, explaining and mitigating. But we have had a death here, there is a woman in hospital who might possibly identify them later, we have gone past the stage when we can protect them or give them a wide berth.”
Naked, white, smooth and flowing limbs, a thatch of dark brown downy mane peeking between his legs, his mouth and chin smeared with red lipstick, his wavy wig hiding part of his flushed face, Sherlock looked like a sight to heal sore eyes. Sexy as a minx, a spicy saucepot one would die a thousand times to take a sip out of, his increasingly louder moans seductive as hell, John found it real hard to consider this helplessly aroused man bouncing on his cock was the same stern-faced detective who managed to silence ministers, officers and criminals alike, with his logic, sarcasm and threats.
“When that happens I will ensure you’re the first one to know,” Sherlock said coldly, his deep voice set in ice, “But until then, there is absolutely not necessary for you to show up and advise me about whom I should befriend, shelter or keep in my own house. If it makes you feel any better, I am very capable of looking after myself. Our home security is beefed up, our remote surveillance team is on the job and I also have a licensed gun. We are all alert so if anyone tries to intrude, they won’t have a pleasant experience.”
The problem with being below average height is that people whose legs are longer (and, John admitted, who were about half his age) were also faster. He did his best to outrun them, but he hadn't reached the edge of the park before someone tackled him from behind and he fell. He cursed himself for a fool as he tried to struggle free. If it hadn't been for his stubbornness he would probably have gotten away with just giving them his money. Then someone kicked him hard in the ribs and all thought fled with his breath. He could only try to avoid the worst of the beating the four men were inflicting on him, alternating punches and kicks. He curled up and raised his arms to protect his face, grunting in pain, and he felt someone roughly tearing at his jacket to pull out his wallet, phone, and keys. John opened his eyes to see if they were done with him, but instead he saw a booted foot coming towards his face. He desperately tried to roll away, but the kick connected.
After watching the time like a hawk, he called in exactly eighteen minutes at the number of the inn’s reception. He knew that the innkeeper would have gone to bed and John would get in using the key he had got from the man by bribing him with a bottle of Scotch. As he had predicted, on the fifth ring John answered the call. “Hello, who’s this….??” He asked, surprised at the phone call at the late hour. Sherlock answered as normally and coolly as possible, “This is me Jawn, Sherlock. My brother’s creating a bit of a ruckus unfortunately. The butler was there, on his scooter, insisting that I go home with. This happened only a few minutes since you left so I thought I might catch you there.”
Sherlock followed John into the master closet where he showed him the fur coats and minks, the shoes and gowns, the trinkets and handbags, watches etc. Everything was hung up or laid out, neatly and systematically, giving an impression that this was maintained on a regular basis.
The younger man was just waiting for the command, because his hips jerks hard and he went completely tense underneath the doctor. “UhhnnnnnJawwwnnnn!” Sherlock’s shriek was followed by loud wails as more cum splashed out of him, wetting John’s hand which was working up and down his cock. John held still, enjoying the way Sherlock rocked on his erection, rotating his hips to get his sweet spot rubbed now and then, riding out the aftershocks noisily. “Shhhh,” John whispered, “They may think I am choking you or something.” He kissed those bruised, swollen lips and silenced him in the gentlest manner possible.
“Your twins are not going to be stalked by this gentleman Mary. They’re kids and they are at an advantage here. They can make friends far more easily than adults too. Don’t you think a Molly and her sister Sally are enough? It took me a year to fend off Molly and now Sally’s on to me.”
“Julia,” Robert stopped her and she shut her mouth, “One minute please. John, can you give us about five to ten minutes? Don’t go anywhere though, maybe get yourself a coffee or tea and stay around the lobby or hallway. We will call you back in shortly.”
Sherlock felt a surge of naughtiness take over and he quipped, “In case your staff feels it’s too unusual to see you do their work or that His Highness can’t drive a teeny weeny forklift, then I can come to his rescue. I wanna drive this, that’s what I wanted to do anyways.”
“Drive a bit faster, a little faster, take that gap between the two cars, come on, don’t lift your foot off the accelerator and slam it on the brakes, you can…..” he kept up an annoying and very loud tirade at the hapless cab driver as the latter tried to negotiate the dense and crawling traffic on the streets of London, that too at peak hours in the evening. At first the man behind the wheel tried to do as he said but after narrowly avoiding a few accidents, the cabbie shot back at him, telling him to shut up or else they would both end up in the hospital too, with broken bones.
Sherlock pouted, “See, he is a wizard with the stock market and makes huge profits from his investments and speculations, on top of that he gets paid incredibly well as a senior and extremely critical government official. He was the one my father named as a benefactor of our grandfather’s will and along with daddy he has made real estate investments that have paid huge dividends. Mycroft is worth over thirty million quid.”
“Now, I won’t say ‘I told you so’ Lockie, but no more strangers in this house,” Mycroft said strictly and in a tone that left no room for negotiation, “It’s not Mrs. Finch’s fault she got hacked but at the end of the day we had a criminal offense committed here all thanks to her presence. We shouldn’t allow such events to happen in a house where my parents lived, where we grew up, which holds so many wonderful memories for us. Why take these unnecessary risks, especially with strangers whose backstory and history we aren’t aware of? Now, pack your bags, this very evening you’re coming to London with me. No arguments, I have made up my mind so you go and pack up your bags.”
Sherlock giggled, licked his lips seductively and wiped his damp mouth and chin with the back of his hand. He turned around and sat the way he normally did, settling cozily between a still breathless John’s open legs, his back plastered against the still-heaving chest of his older lover. John frowned at that and craned his neck to one side to check out his face, surprised to note that Sherlock didn’t make any attempt to continue their conjugal acts. In fact he looked strangely and totally serene and relaxed. However, his body betrayed him somewhat. The erection he had developed while blowing John bobbed out of the surface of the soapy water and John immediately reached down and tried to grip it.
Sherlock made an unidentifiable sound and was about to turn his head away when John caught him by the wrist, pulled him down and gave him a long, soft, loving kiss which had Sherlock melting into his Doctor's arms and mouth in no time.
It turned out to be quite a lot and they soon found themselves panting and gasping for air but not wanting to let go of each other just yet. Sherlock tugged on the hem of John’s jumper and whispered in his ear “I want… I want… John!”
"Sherlock…I know you weren´t exactly physically harmed but…when I finally found you…half of your shirt was off. Did he…did he…”
Sherlock forced his whole upper body into John’s, curling around him as if he wanted to crawl into him and never leave; it knocked all the air out of John. After a second, he heard him whisper “Okay?” against his shoulder and John just kissed his curls in response, petting his hair, stroking his shoulders soothingly. God if he had been any later, if he hadn´t gotten the clue right, if he… he was so in his head that he unconsciously grabbed Sherlock´s hair a little harder than he had intended to and only stopped when the younger man made a sound of discomfort
Sherlock swallowed hard but accepted the cuppa, laid down but kept fidgeting, protesting for a minute, but finally, he started. Slowly, at first-but then!
“Fine” he finally said, “fine! You stay here and wake up properly and I’ll go and make breakfast okay?!”
John gulped "I...I saw you. shot. bleeding out. Not...not ever opening these astonishing eyes again, never opening that brilliant mouth of yours again, never cutting the best of the Yarders short, never again smiling at me, I just...I couldn't..." there was a long silence in which John subconciously clung to Sherlock's arm and he let him.
"You're mad, you're dangerous, I will NOT have you taking any more drugs and I am NOT gay!" John panted into his face
John smirked and smoothed an errant curl back “Yeah well…doesn´t mean I can´t be bisexual, can it?!” and he reveled in the beautiful and surprised “Oh” Sherlock´s mouth made.
"You seriously are incredible, in every sense of the word!" he exclaimed "and I'm sorry I went over your breakfast, really, I am. But that...that..before that...where in all heavens did you get THAT from?"
When he stepped into the living room where Sherlock was already waiting, the usually so graceful detective managed to stumble over his own feet when he tried to get to John and the Doctor had to catch him, tried, but not quite managed to stiffle a laughter but was utterly charmed by the great detective's rosy hued cheeks and whispered "see anything you like?" in his flustered husband's ear.
They both just stared for a few seconds. John´s cock was thick and lying straight upwards on his belly, leaking a bit, while Sherlock´s had a slight right curve to it, was a bit longer and almost purple with want. John immediately forgot everything about tits and just choked out “Oh God, Oh Sherlock, OH..OH PLEASE!” and couldn´t resist to touch it while his hungry mouth found Sherlock´s already abused lips again. Sherlock moaned into the kiss and John was absolutely 107% certain that he had never heard anything remotely as sensual and erotic as this and kicked his heterosexuality to the curb in this very moment. Whatever would happen when they were both sober again, no other woman or man would ever be able to ignite that kind of spark in John and he cursed himself shortly for how long it had taken him to recognise that, but then he felt Sherlock moving and-Oh Christ!- he was rutting against his hip and…nonono! John took hold of Sherlock´s wrists and straddled him again, fully lying on him now and suddenly he felt his cock touching the silky-smooth texture of Sherlock´s hardness and damn wasn´t that good! And he moaned into Sherlock´s mouth, kissing him hungrily, frotting against him and when he finally felt Sherlock moving his hips as well, in rhythm with his, he was already nearly gone. “Sher..Sherlock..god..look at you..so beautiful!” he sighed. “ah..no…shut up John..you´re…not..you won´t..let me just enjoy this one time when..” John stopped immediately and kissed Sherlock again”please”he whispered “ I know what I said at Angelo´s and so many times after that. But..as you would say “ I see but I do not observe” there will never be another woman or man. No one except you if you want this as much as I do! You´re perfect and beautiful and..yeah and crazy and..fuck! I´ll never want anyone other than you, I swear, my beautiful, wonderful genius!” John cupped his face again and placed loving kisses along his eyelids, his cheekbones, his jaw and neck, hoping he had conveyed the message, when Sherlock suddenly tensed, groped at his neck and forced his face down for an almost bruising kiss while jerking his hips up violently against John´s aching cock, brushing them together and he..oh god he felt Sherlock twitch while he kissed him and then Sherlock just rasped “please..please..mine! forever..mine!” and then he came, long streams of milky white on his stomach, his chest and-Christ!-one tiny bit even hit his chin while he arched his back, exposed his neck and John couldn´t help but bite down now on Sherlock´s collarbone and then he came as well, crying out Sherlock´s name, shuddering out his aftershocks while collapsing on the man, ignoring all the cum for the moment and panting hard into his chest. After a minute or so, he reached for his shirt and cleaned them both up, rested his head on Sherlock´s still heaving chest and asked “you alright?”. There was a long silence and John began to really worry when Sherlock finally spoke”I don´t know John” his stomach sank and he tried to crawl away immediately but Sherlock held him. “Not THAT!” he protested. “ I mean..I..I think..sentiment” John blinked and his eyelashes fluttered on Sherlock´s chest. “ah” “Guess it..might not be as bad as I thought it is…is it?” Sherlock asked, fear obvious in his voice. John got up and held his hand out to Sherlock “no” he said “ it really isn´t. Sleep with me?”
John´s stoned mind can´t help but imagining it the second he´s uttered it. He feels his mouth going a bit dry. It´s from the dope, he just needs water. He takes several large swigs, shakes his head again and says, as firm as he can “erm..I´d…just get on with this shit, can we?!”
“Oh” Sherlock made, but his tone became more cautious “so…may I ask why you are so….weird today? It’s fine, you know it is, I’m certainly not the one to blurt it out to the world if you want to keep your precious heterosexual reputation and I’m...well…I’m actually not sure I can erase what happened from my mind palace but if you insist, I could try and…”
this of you, as your compass, as your Captain!” and then he bent down and kissed him again, sweetly, softly, carefully. “Neither this bastard nor any other person will ever harm you as long as I am around, I promise you, I promise, promise!” John whispered between kisses and both of them became more relaxed and less frightened with each passing kiss.
Sherlock stil wasn't absolutely sure what was going on and the whiskey, the wine and John's kisses had turned what was left of his mind palace to absolute mush so he just...put his arms around John's middle and pulled him even closer, murmuring "love you. sorry I didn't..love you so much!"
“Sleep some more darling, I will be right here with you” John whispered in Sherlock´s ear and felt a slight shudder coming from the lean man “Always! Let go!” Sherlock shuddered violently once more, then put an arm over Johns middle and pretty much passed out again.
And then came the infamous Irene Adler case and with it, that meeting at the palace. Sherlock had, at the time, assumed that John was staring wide-eyed at Mycroft and forgot to lower his teacup because of the pictures of “the Woman” and the description of her..occupation, but truth be told, it had been because of Mycroft´s remark about..well…the implication that Sherlock was still a virgin. Obviously, John had never seen Sherlock with a partner, male or female, and he had made it very clear on that first night at Angelo´s that he was married to his work but John couldn´t help wonder what he had been before all that, in his youth and when he was..well..surely, someone as experimental and attractive as Sherlock had to have at some point… And then it hit him. Had he just thought of Sherlock as ATTRACTIVE?! He panicked slightly and the Tesco bags he was holding nearly slid out of his hands but, ever the good soldier, he collected himself pretty quickly and gave himself a pep talk in his own head “John, it´s perfectly fine, you can definitely acknowledge that another man looks good without being gay! And the bastard is attractive, you´ve seen him woo countless clients and suspects if needs be to get them talking. Yes, yes, he´s attractive but just because he´s got a long neck and this perfectly creamy unmarred skin and perfect curls and these plush lips that are just made to suck co..WAIT WHAT?!” and this time, the bags really slipped and John stood in front of 221b in a puddle of slowly leaking out milk while he desperately tried to make himself think about nice, round tits and only that! After five minutes or so and a few shakes of his head in order to get the previous thoughts completely out of his head, he was ready to return to Tesco´s to pick up more milk and groceries. English as he was, he obviously chose another counter this time, it would´ve just been too damn weird to encounter the same cashier twice within twenty minutes and so it happened that he ended up in the longest damn queue but still had a very nice time because the pretty young woman in front of him started chatting with him, he had her phone number before it was even their turn and he went home with a smile on his face and all and every thought of his flatmate’s possible attractiveness gone from his mind.
Of course, the soul of a decidedly-not-their-housekeeper came shuffling up the stairs immediately, as fast as her hip would allow her.
John just looked back for a long time, drowning willingly in those impossible eyes, smiling softly back at the man he loved, would always love, had, if he was being honest to himself, always loved since they first met.
Just as John was done preparing a proper breakfast, Sherlock came wandering into the living room, curls still wet from the shower, fresh pyjamas and his billowing blue dressing gown on and John had to try hard not to stare open-mouthed. Of course he had always thought the man attractive but after last night…
Apparently, someone had written this as a suggestion as to what two men - curiously also called John and Sherlock - could do at their wedding anniversary. He clicked on the link and his eyes widened.
“Sherlock?” he whispered, and the man turned to face him, eyes wide and curls disarrayed and just oh-so-beautiful. He nearly stopped breathing “Sh...Sherlock? I just wanted to say…whatever you need me to do, if there´s anything at all I can do to make this go away or to make you feel better, please tell m…”
He could feel Sherlock sigh and relax beneath him. “And I will never stop apologising that it took me so bloody long to accept that fact, for holding on to..” “Shhh!” Sherlock made and kissed him again, guiding him down onto his body, exploring his mouth, both of them learning each other once more. And more. And more.
“that girl gave you her number today” he whispered. John smiled “yes. And what did I do with it?” “you threw it out of the window with the first joint” Sherlock rasped. “and why do you think I did that?” John whispered against his lips. He saw Sherlock close his lips and thought he heard “frankly: I don´t fucking care” before his lips touched John´s in a light and tender kiss, silk on his chapped lips, heaven on earth, everything he had ever wanted but hadn´t known it until now. He decided he wanted more of those lips and started to map them out, kissed along Sherlock´s cupid bow, nipped and sucked at Sherlock´s lower lip as if his life depended on it and then finally, FINALLY, felt Sherlock´s lips part a little.  It was different, kissing a man. But that thought only lingered for a second in John´s mind because it was just too damn glorious, his tongue went exploring, everything was wet heat and only then did he realize he practically sat on Sherlock´s crotch and he started grinding down and ..suddenly Sherlock drew back and choked out “John..John..stop!” Oh. Oh. “Oh god Sherlock I´m…I´m so sorry I didn´t..I didn´t want to..jesus sorry I” Sherlock silenced him with a finger on his lips(which was way more erotic than it should have been!)
"Internet. Said that was the latest thing and very....good. Might want to write the author a letter though" he growled, cheeks pink again. John smiled again and said "well, I thank you for all the effort you put in, but let's be quite clear about this: never again will there be any fruits or vegetables near on or in my sensitive areas, yes?!" Sherlock just nodded, still flushed, but suddenly grinned and a dangerous spark lightened up his eyes, a spark John knew all too well
"Uhm" John made "Yeah I...sorry, I really didn't mean it like that, it's just...yeah...how much is the beer?"
He was astonished that his voice sounded so broken but he didn’t care at the moment. He really just wanted to go home right now. With John. Back home to safety. John just nodded and helped him up, gingerly, not touching more than his upper arm and guided him towards a cab.
He was clad in skin-tight golden leggins, his bare, upper body sprinkled with golden powder that made him look like an ancient greek God. As soon as the music set in - a classical piece underlined with a 90's techno beat - he started to dance, moving around, made the stage his, always seductive, never sluttish
“See?” he said “You’re not “alright”! I’m not going to go further – or ANYWHERE – with you until we have that cleared. So!”
right, the tight, purple shirt always made John look at him as if he were going to devour him on the spot. He briefly wondered if he should be only wearing that but then thought better of it. No, no rushing things and John could get angry when Sherlock tried to stop him from getting to the clinic in time, so his tightest black trousers had to do.
Sherlock fell down onto John’s strong chest, panting hard and just listening to John’s rapidly beating heart calming down again, until John winced slightly and he remembered that he was still inside of John.
I have invested way too much time and too many thoughts into that man, I see that now! You, John Watson, are my compass! You are my heart and soul, you are what keeps me right! “
"Right" John grinned, having learnt long ago not to question the man when it came to certain things "Ta! Cheers!"
"John!" Mike sighed "I'm so sorry...I mean, I'm really glad that you can accept that you're, well...playing for both fields and all that, but, HIM?!"
for me and I appreciated it very much. I don’t know if you remember but you said that you weren’t gay but you…”
“Sherlock, listen…it was a bad night for both of us. But neither of us was drunk. I said what I said being fully conscious. You, however, might still have been in shock so if you want to take it back, go back to all that married to your work shit, it´s okay, I´ll jusmpffff!”
Ooooh that was indeed delicious! He had a few sips and let his head fall back on to the wall of the tub, closing his eyes. When he opened them again, Sherlock was still there, but now sitting beside the tub, long, sinewy arms crossed on the frame and looking at him, everchanging eyes roaming his face and changing seemingly minutely between fond, expecting, amused, nervous, happy, lustful and back to fond again.
To his surprise, Sherlock had not only made a fire as he had asked but also covered the floor in front of it with pillows and blankets.
, I see. Quod erat demonstrandum my little friend, and now man up and let's get this over and done with - if you're not too obviously wetting your pants, I'll buy you an extremely heterosexual beer afterwards, deal?"
He was just typing up the 244th type of tobacco he had found in the south of West Papua and now John had to distract him with such a mundane question?!
He heard and felt another puff of warm breath in his ear, disgustingly sweet “Ah no need to be afraid Sherlock, I will be gentle…maybe...if you´re a good boy! You know, I was always so jealous of that little army doctor, but then again…you never let him have you, always just teasing tsktsktsk!”
"Hey Hey Hey!" John pulled away, sniggering "didn't you say we have somewhere to be in about thirtyfive minutes?" he scolded him softly.
John held watch over Sherlock until the sun arose and bathed his exhausted, beautiful and innocent looking face in gold. When he woke again, slowly, he didn’t panic this time, he just blinked a lot and stayed very still. John realised he had to make the first move yet again-and might have to do for a very long time!
Mike grinned "Ah, Watson!" "Wha...what do you mean? Why are you looking at me like that?" John asked, utterly clueless
They were both panting a bit when they parted again and Sherlock finally ran his hand through his hair, trying to get his curls under control again, stood up and stammered "uhm..w-well..you..there's...five minutes...better get...Angelo's" and fled the room
He said, the soldier back in his voice, but still gentle “here’s a cuppa, you can lean your pretty head against these cushions and I won’t touch you unless you ask for it. Now please tell me. Tell me all of it!”
Sherlock just nodded, stretched obscenely and John hurried to get out of the room. His usual morning wood (“You’re bloody lucky you’re still getting that mate, neither of our friends are that active anymore!” Mike once commented on his “problem” during his rare meetings with his army mates) was one thing during his times sleeping alone, but
John stared. He did NOT think he would get the most romantic declaration of love he had ever heard from Sherlock of all people and he fought with his tears while trying to respond.
Sherlock finally pulled himself together enough to whisper “John…you don´t have to...I´m sorry.” John tipped his head upwards so he´d have to look him into the eyes, dark blue, stormy, dangerous but calming
Then he inhaled deeply, closed his eyes, turned his head back to Sherlock and began speaking, eyes still closed, hands still firmly on Sherlock's wrists:
bodies around him, he made a beeline for the bar. So what if this was technically a worknight, he needed a drink, and badly!
Sherlock didn´t really have an answer. The only thing he knew was that he sat there, maybe two feet away from John, on John’s bed, and he already felt cold.
“John? I could devour a whole cow right now!” Sherlock said, completely seriously, looking John straight in the eyes and John couldn’t help but to giggle.
He said and Sherlock shivered and suddenly felt very sick when he noticed one of Moriarty´s spidery hands toying with the buttons of his shirt. NO….no god no, please, not like this!
But as apologies went, this one was pretty damn high up on his list and even if he would never let Sherlock anywhere near his cock with anything even closely resembling a fruit of any sort, he was so relaxed and happy now, that a tiny giggle escaped him at the memory of that insane wake-up call this morning. "Oh Sherlock" he sighed, shaking his head.
He finally turned his head again but John was already on his knees, his hands all over him, frantically checking for injuries but he couldn´t stand it right now. “Please John, NO! I’m…it’s…ok, thank…thank you. I just want to go home, can we talk later?”
As soon as the door closed after her, John rushed over to Sherlock, checked his pulse, his pupils, all while Sherlock tried to swat his hands away and giggling and then went to fetch him a large glass of water and forced it on him. Sherlock got most of it on his shirt because John might have been a bit TOO forceful but at last the water was gone (one way or the other) and Sherlock garbled “Jawn..JAAAWWWN calm dooown! ´t was jus a bit of fun, no cocaine, no worries, never again, never again Jawn, promise!” John sighed deeply. At least he was still fairly sure Sherlock would keep THAT promise, and from the look of it, Sherlock hadn´t had any other drugs in months, too, or he wouldn´t have been so affected by a joint, however good it was. He´d seen many men in the army enjoying themselves with a bit of dope occasionally, and, to be honest, he sometimes had joined in. After all, the stuff was cheap and good in Afghanistan. He knew it wasn´t exactly morally…good, but sometimes it was just nice to have a little out for a few hours. He decided to give Sherlock his lecture later and get him into bed for now, but when he tried to get the lanky man up from the sofa and said “fine. But to bed with you now Sherlock, sleep it off, I´ll be looking after you!”, Sherlock flat-out resisted, made himself go limp and heavy and whined “but noooooo Jawn, I´m not tired yet, not my bedtime at aaaall and you just got this FANTASTICALLY promising E-Mail from your old mate Paul Guigann and it lo..” John let Sherlock go immediately and he fell back down on the sofa with a huff. John was used to Sherlock using his laptop by now but he normally ignored his Mails by now. And Paul…for some weird reason, Paul always sent John either a) videos of cute little kittens or b) VERY weird porn – or would-be porn videos, because he apparently thought John would find them funny (okay, he laughed about the kittens, truth be told, but he was fairly damn sure that was NOT what Sherlock was talking about right now). He turned the laptop around and read the E-Mail. “Hi John, mate, don´t even ask me how the fuck I found this but I just couldn´t stop laughing! I swear, it´s not porn or anything this time but if you want a good laugh, watch this! I completely lost it, those Japanese really are a whole new level of cray-cray! Remember when Steve showed us the pants from his girlfriend he brought with him to Afghanistan and what he used them for?” John sighed inwardly. How could he ever forget? Steve was in his room for two weeks and he and all the others could hear him masturbating every.damn.night. while he practically talked to the damn thing! NO, NOT to his girlfriend back in England, BUT TO HER DAMN PANTS!
“Hey, what are you doing?” Julia asked, running alongside her fiancé but also a bit curious about his sudden change of plans, “Gregory said we should stick to the main road and the surroundings areas, not to go down there and there won’t be anyone…….” Before she could finish he stopped, kissed her and gave her a wink, “I am not seven and he isn’t my fifteen year old big brother no more! No one will be there, what does that mean? That means you and I can tick off another thing on our list of dares!”
“Oh no, it’s not five hundred thousand but five million,” John said in a harsh tone of voice, waving his right hand at some papers in front of him, “Internal audits revealed discrepancy of spend and some unaccounted amounts being drawn and when I matched it with the cheque number it turned out to be the one I had given you. YOU!! I didn’t write anything other than the numerical figure so you took full advantage and, along with Jim, cashed in on a windfall huh??? Add some zeroes, add the absolute figure in writing as ‘Five million only’ and con me out of my money. This money is just a drop in the ocean for me but it’s not the amount that bothers me, but the greed and the deceptions and pretenses you resorted to steal it from me. You are a thief, a robber, a cheat.”
….. His eyes widened and his heart near stopped when he noticed the reflection in the kitchen cabinet before him.
“He still does all that underworld work?” John asked, aghast, as Sherlock started to call Sebastian.
After a few sounds of things falling and her pained groans and frightened shrieks, everything went quiet and still again. After a while a man emerged from the backdoor and calmly walked out of the backyard, his long strides quickly taking him behind the boulder and out of sight.
Sally’s eyes went wide, “You’re saying that convict, Tom Patton, even he had been killed by the same slayer. But what about the possibility that Tom himself might have been the slayer?”
Later when they dropped the duo at their home, Jim was still pouting and fuming and Sherlock had a sullen face. Once Sebastian and John had left, Sherlock and Jim stood waving at the retreating vehicle, then headed straight for the pine forest by taking the winding path that started about a hundred meters from their cul-de-sac like area.
This is not happening, God, please, make it go away. He heard a low growl and when he somehow managed to turn he saw two glowing eyes, almost greenish, with the orbs maroon. It was the most ghastly sight and the last thing one wanted to see in a dark room. Then Sherlock spoke again and he heard the words properly, bringing a fresh chill to his entire body from top to toe. ‘Get out of here right now Jawn’.
“Remember the time those farmers, the Barrow brothers, they told us that they saw predator footprints and suddenly boot prints? Similar ones were found some distance away from the location of my cousin Redmond’s murder. Once is a coincidence, twice is not. I saw similar prints on our private pier where Sherlock fell in the water. This time I analyzed the prints too.”
“I know,” John smiled, “Apologize for the loneliness they felt, not for the decision you made of getting away. Here, please look at the gifts and read the note as well. I really want to know if I have graduated or not because I did this entirely without any assistance or suggestions.”
As we were talking/arguing, he had been sucking on the candy cane. It was a disturbingly hot sight so I had resolutely kept his eyes away from him. Or else I knew I’d start all over again. Now I realized he had sucked on the straight end and it looked pointy and sharp. “Why this side, the tip… it looks like…..”
She was covered with dirt and mud and cuts and scrapes, her hairs were all tangled like a bird’s nest and she had a haunted look on her face. A deeper look in her eyes told them she was in a catatonic state.
Mycroft turned to leave the room when he heard a feeble bleat from his brother. “Myc, wait.” He turned and nodded, “Okay.”
Sherlock then groaned out and said something familiar, which John purposefully blocked out because he was just so…..distressed by the effort of ignoring the man next to him! Things on the nightstand shook violently before Sherlock’s movements ceased and he began to pant. John lay silent, almost on the verge of an orgasm, and completely confused as to why he was not grossed out by this.
“Please, hear me out. My grandma used to say, ‘Just because you’re not evil doesn’t mean no one else can be evil’. Do remember that. We don’t know a thing about this man. He could be John Nice or John Nasty or John Psycho for all you know.”
This boy, named William Sherlock Scott Holmes, was the younger of two sons of Reginald and Eugenia Holmes, a wealthy and talented couple whose intelligence levels were exceptional. Their elder son Mycroft, now twelve, was just as brilliant. It was too early for Sherlock to show his brilliance yet but the problem here was
Actually the lady was watering her roses but Phil got a bit unnerved and returned to his car, starting the engine and moving it up by about twenty meters. But as the minutes ticked his patience began to wear thin. Sherlock kept sitting in John’s car and John kept standing beside it, both men engrossed in a conversation packed with laughter and animated gestures. Scowling, Phil honked the car horn several times.
“Yeah but don’t take too much time. Once you have something, pass it on to me and as long as we get about five million, you can use the exit clause of the contract and escape. Three months at the most. The longer you stay, the harder it will be for you to get out of that place.”
When Sherlock looked at him, surprised, his brother snorted with disdain. “I know this because I’m seeing the familiar Sherlock before me again, the same boy I grew up with and the young man we were so proud of. It’s not a stranger, not someone else’s mouthpiece, but my very own brother Lockie. Needless to say, you’d become a very, very different person in his company.”
“They should have stayed there,” Jim murmured, getting out of bed and heading towards the balcony door, “Want to smoke? I need some fresh air to think. Have been in bed way too long. Come on now!”
John pushed in harder, picked up speed, thrust faster and faster. All through he kept his eyes on Sherlock’s face to watch his expressions, if even a tiny hint of discomfiture showed up he would hold still. But all John saw there was bliss, sheer and utter bliss and a desire for more, still more. Overwhelmed by Sherlock’s responsiveness and amazing sensuality, he allowed the feelings building inside him to reach a crescendo.
“It’s beautiful,” Sherlock said as John handed him the pulled pork, cucumbers, cheese, tomato and egg club sandwiches, each one as thick as they come, “Sandwiches smell nice. Have they given us something other than just sandwiches though?”
“There was a man right behind you. He seemed to be with you almost but then…. When our eyes met he just turned and walked the opposite way.”
“Sure, will do so junior sir! As for the envelopes, yes they arrived last week from Paris. It is from Mrs. Follet.”
“Ah I see now what this is about,” Sherlock took out his notebook and pen, “This is a case and you want me to find out which of the jealous cunts around stole your expensive Dior or Gucci dress, right?”
“Oh there you are Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson looked cross and said, “I’ll leave now. I am already late by over one hour.”
“I heard your story last night over dinner and made some notes. Here is my analysis. You grew up in a very cloistered environment, protected and dominated by your parents and elder sister. She even used to finish your sentences for you. I’m surprised you didn’t develop a stammer.”
. Ask him to wait in the formal reception room with his sycophants. Don’t allow them to roam about the house unless I have explicitly permitted that and right now that permission is NOT there.”
John’s eyes remained transfixed on Sherlock as the beautiful young man rose and fell on him like a radiant angel, his nimble movements and nymph like gyrations giving him an otherworldly aura. He glowed and sparkled, as if he had a full body halo behind him! John knew it was only his mind playing tricks but what were his chances of controlling his mind when someone this beautiful was riding him hard, riding him while wanton moans dripped out of his mouth and clear slick pre-cum poured out of his cock and right on to John’s fingers. He was fisting him with a light hand, careful not to make him cum prematurely.
His senses on overdrive, his mouth watering, every fiber of his body screaming for release, John pushed his rock hard erection inside. He took time, knowing he was larger than the usual guy, and waited for the brunette to adjust. When Sherlock stopped squirming and breathed out, he pushed in a few more inches, then a little more. Finally, when he was buried root to tip and his balls touched Sherlock’s buttocks, he took a few deep breaths to compose himself. Sherlock’s faltering erection jerked and came alive again and he innocently grabbed John’s hand and guided it to his cock, presumably to make him stroke the awakening member and keep him aroused as ever.
. “John, what kind of medication, I mean over the counter meds can I buy and administer to someone who has an ear ache due to a cold?”
“Don’t tell me that’s how it is for you too?” Jim asked suspiciously, “Because if it is, then you’re doing a better job at concealing that side than I am.”
In the background the exchange had heated up. Sherlock mocked Mycroft, “You make issues out of small things, like how I park the car.”
“Oh yes, I thought since you both can speak you could easily do the….okay, fine, I’ll do it. John, this is my mum. Mum, this is John, my colleague and housemate. He is also my friend.”
“You will suck me dry,” he growled, “And then swallow it. After that you’ll get fucked hard enough to forget what date it is!”
“Guys, guys what’s going on?” They heard a familiar voice. Looking up they saw Mycroft and Greg at the window, both appearing to be very anxious. “Open the Goddamned door. You were supposed to call us the moment you sensed something was going on.”
Sherlock spread his legs a bit wider, a reflex action maybe, but that was the end of all virtue signaling from the younger man. A soft moan escaped him as John kneaded the buttocks and kissed each of the cheeks before parting them to expose the central crack. It was a quivering light pink and tight hole, twitching in anticipation, the soft furled opening clenching and unclenching as John kissed it and then gave it a teasing lick. “Oh fuck, this is unreal,” Sherlock moaned as he buried his face in his hands and pushed his butt up a little.
Sherlock grinned wickedly, “You wanted the whole village to know we were going for an outdoor tryst in the middle of the night?”
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock was thoroughly disheartened by the trickery employed to get him over to London at a short notice, “This was the urgency, the emergency? I drove and one and half hours for this? I was thinking that Mycroft is in trouble or maybe Rog, you are not well or something similar.”
for him’. John, always a private person, bristled slightly at her attention grabbing side, something he hadn’t noticed before. Why would she post pics of their very first date to her seven hundred odd Insta followers?
“Oh, Mabel….Mrs. Mabel Willis, Mrs. Hudson’s elder sister,” John remembered their landlady talking about her, “You are the one who married a sailor who worked on a merchant ship, and you have traveled all the way to Vladivostok and Tokyo on that ship, long, long ago!”
He somehow made it to the nearest tube station and heaved a sigh of relief when he stood in the queue, a smile on his lips when he saw the object of his desire standing a little ahead of him in the same queue.
“My educated guess is that profile and pic was Jawn’s and he had the pic doctored and used it to turn my parents off from Jawn. Out of spite he sent it to Ivor or…. Maybe by errata his accomplice did so. But whatever happened next becomes much clearer in the light of this.”
John growled as arousal coursed through him like an all-consuming forest fire, scorching up everything in its path. He had so much to say, so much to think about, so much to ponder over, but all he could do now was to claim this man standing in front of him.
“Tell me the truth,” John asked as he sipped water from the cup, “You knew Mycroft was coming over, didn’t you?”
Sebastian burst out laughing and signaled to the barman to bring in shots. “We need to have two shots to this,” he said, while John finished his first peg and held out his glass for the second one. “So then, the sexy fatigues didn’t work, the officer rank didn’t work and therefore none of those girls are currently relevant,” the deep baritone of Sebastian’s reminded John of Sherlock, making him feel a weird pang in his chest, “But now I hear you’re a rich man. Sherlock’s making money which means you’d get a cut. You were honorably discharged, so there’s a pension. There is surely a neat sum paid to the Barts surgeon and I am sure there might have also been a temporary disability compensation given.”
A week passed and Sherlock felt as if he was going nowhere. Not for lack of effort from his side though because he had tried his best to contact Jim and failed. The man’s cell phone was off and there were no responses to emails either. Not willing to give up, Sherlock had even taken a day off from the estate, telling John he needed to visit his ‘aunt’ and gone to the flat where Jim lived. It was locked and since it was his own flat, there was no landlord or lady to check with.
“Okay,” Sherlock shrugged, craning his neck to see what John was up to, a curious smile on his lips. He didn’t have to wait too long. Within a few seconds John rushed back to the bed, holding a beautiful little box made of crystal with an ivory base. Sherlock’s eyes grew big at the sight of that tiny but elegant case. These kinds of boxes usually held rings. Could it be that John was taking the step he’d so far been hinting at?
John nodded, “Gimme just a minute to catch my breath and I promise you a big, long, explosive ride right afterwards.”
“Oh very good,” John concealed the news that Sherlock hadn’t visited that day, “Mary, why did you say the other day that…. That having me over at his place would make him feel better?”
“Wrong. I have the cage and the critters safely inside. They are all yours for the taking. I just wanted to know the man who had set that trap that the old coot just got trapped into. That’s why I had removed the cage, to have a word with you, if possible.”
Sherlock was not sure when and how Mary’s predictions came true but true they did become, in all intents and purposes, and that too in a matter of another two weeks. John found to his absolute delight that Sherlock was visiting him every day. He never said he was there to see John but the excuses he made up for dropping by every day were so cute that one had to grin.
“Nope. I think we have seen the last of him. After this we will take a restraining order but that will be for him as well as his handler, sorry, his boyfriend Sebastian. Considering the fact that Colonel Sebastian Augustus Moran is John’s cousin and member of the extended family, I want to do this with dignity and civility. But I will cut them out of John’s life, if that’s the last thing I manage to do. This time I have made up my mind.”
Thankful for the change of topic, Jim spoke volubly about his work. That was his area of passion anyways so it was easy to speak of it.
back then. You had control, you were discreet, you were picky. Look, you can talk to me about it now because I am the best man to give you advice on this. I am bisexual myself, I like women for sex and men for friendships and companionship. If this makes you feel any better, I have fucked Jim.”
“You wouldn’t have what?” Sherlock cast a worried glance at his friend and then gasped when he saw the pair of shoes kept under the bed. Only one of them was peeping out a bit and Sherlock, with his ability to see in the dark, noticed the drop of blood on the suede surface of the boot. He frowned and asked Jim again, “You didn’t go out and allow yourself to go wild and attack someone, did you Jim? Please answer me, did you?!”
“Yeah, in the lab, yes,” Sherlock said evasively, “Usually I am careful but I was excited about one of the recent experiments and wanted to note down some point, didn’t see what was kept next to me. Now don’t you worry, I will be fine soon. It’s just the shirt that is bothering me, otherwise it’s okay!”
A flicker of a smile came over John’s face when he heard the hidden message in his young lover’s words. “One must make an effort,” he murmured, “Anything can be managed, with the right effort.”
, “He had made it a hobby of some kind. Kidnap John Watson and detain him, treat him like a therapist, a target for knife throwing, a sounding board, a lab rat, a psychology experiment, and when bored just let him go with a small gift. This simply has to stop.”
“Then what do I do? I have an urge,” John asked, dismayed. Sherlock frowned. ‘Ask my arse’ was what he wanted to say but deep down he knew it was he who was at fault and breathed in deeply. “I think you can do some self-service,” he whispered, moving away from John’s grasp, “Or just hold it in.”
Jim withdrew and Sherlock coughed and sat up straighter. “Go on, tell me which of the properties you can get hold of. He had about seventeen of them in this country and around eighteen of them around the world. Let’s begin with the ones in and around the city.”
“Oh…. Not someone I know but then…. One second, let me turn the monitor on and see who this man is.”
Sebastian’s eyes widened to extremes and he stood there, watching John with a dropped jaw. John was always the slightly conventional, ‘watch your mouth’ types. For him to be so loose-tongued and free was incredible. He had to be deliriously happy to do this, to let his guard down. “Hahahahaha!!!!” John burst out laughing. Sebastian joined him in that merry laughter, equally amused, “Hohohohohoho!!!!!”
His body jerked forward and he found himself pushed over the table, cheek mashed against the smooth surface of the polished granite, arse draped over the edge as John began to move in and out of him. “Sorry.I.am.truly.sorry.but.I.can’t.stop.It.seems,” John rasped out a word each between thrusts and pulls. He had one of his hands against the back of Sherlock’s head, keeping him there, while his other hand was on Sherlock’s cock and fondling it. Slowly the detective felt himself grow into full hardness and his engorged muscle twitched between John’s fingers. The older man snorted, “So you want it too, don’t you? You like my big fat cock inside you private, come on, answer me, it’s an ORDER.”
Then, as he saw Sherlock still staring in the direction of the hallway he started to dress Sherlock like a man would do to a boy and whispered, “Hey, don’t worry. This place is not haunted and it’s not my mamma walking down the corridors and hallways, opening and closing doors, listening to her son and his lover’s orgasmic moans!”
He sniffled and wiped his nose awkwardly with the back of his hand. Instantly John raised his head from Sherlock’s neck and looked through slumberous eyes. “What is it? Did I hurt you?”
The passing cars narrowly missed them, some avoiding them last moment and others coming to a halt. One motorist stuck her head out and cursed colorfully but Mycroft heard nothing of that. Greg turned and apologized, calming her down. “Stop acting like maniacs, behave like the grown men that you are,” she hissed and went off.
John stared in astonishment. No one had ever talked back to him like this. They were too afraid to lose his patronage. But this young, courageous man was changing the rules. He was simply being his honest self.
The other guest seemed amiable and said, ‘That’s okay, if you’re not the police and there hasn’t been a felony then never mind’ before heading back inside. A split second later the door to the suite opened and there stood Sherlock, dressed in just a robe and a huge goofy grin on his boyish handsome face. John appeared moments later, dressed in just a towel around his hips. It was evident that both men had just taken a bath and had to leave it in a hurry to answer the door quickly.
James Moriarty was the sort of man who would make heads turn and stop traffic, despite not being the paragon of all virtues or beauty. He was a bit too thin, medium height at the best, his widow’s peak was a bit too pronounced and he could be downright short-tempered and fly off the handle at the drop of the hat. Still people wanted to know him, date him, be around him. Because, when Jim decided to deliver even the bigwigs in the government and the senior-most scientists across the world sat up, listened and acknowledged his genius. His presence was big, his aura almost overwhelmingly sexy and his wits and his razor sharp wits were matched ably by his disarming smile and deep dark brown eyes. They said he had killed a man in road rage when he was fourteen and beat a class bully to a pulp when he was only seven. At twenty one he had hacked into the Bank of England just for fun.
“I don’t really like them,” Jim grumbled as the four men made their way back to the town after dropping the girls at a shopping mall for some purchases. They would come back in a rental car and the next morning move to a hotel in town.
“Yeah, sure,” John said, feeling a bit rejected by Sherlock’s move. He half regretted what he had done while imagining how much sillier he would look if he couldn’t handle the champagne bottle. He smiled uneasily and stepped right into Phillip Andersen’s trap. “Please do.”
“Hmmm,” John surveyed his lover like a predator, shutting the door behind them and bolting it, “This thing has a sash around the waist, which needs to be tied. Otherwise I can see all the goodies underneath!”
“HELP, HELP,” shouted the doctor, trying to get his hand out but failing to do so as Sherlock put more pressure on his flesh, his sharp teeth almost breaking the skin, “Owww, what a savage child. And the lady is rewarding him with an ice cream…..ouch,
“Yes, she is a psychiatrist,” Mycroft Holmes, the family attorney, spoke gently, “She has also semi-retired. She and daddy are embarking on a six month tour across the world.”
The food tasted delicious. Buttery scrambled eggs with crumbled cheese, little bits of scallion, a hint of black pepper. Sausages fried golden brown. Crispy bacon strips. Toasts smothered with butter and jam. Hot chocolate. It was all perfect as the two men sat eating in the quiet kitchen, the even quieter backdrop of the overall darkened house acting as the perfect setting. Ben had taken his food to his room, realizing they needed some privacy. As Sherlock suggestively licked his finger when he fed him, John felt a gasp leave his throat and was forced to address his feelings right there and then.
What he didn’t understand was his own needs and how easily Sherlock fulfilled them. This had been one of the most intense orgasms he had had in a while. He threw all thoughts and afterthoughts, all inhibitions and fears out of his head for a while. He wanted this, more of this.
The date had been going quite well until John had started noticing some aspects about his female companion that were conspicuously close to Sherlock’s deductions. One of the things he had said about Carrie the morning before was her attention seeking techniques and John could see one rather glaring example already. Not only had she insisted that he wear the white shirt, monogrammed with his initials, to the pub; she also took pictures of him and herself, posting it immediately on her Insta and captioning it as ‘The handsome doc in a shirt
Mycroft’s eyes were wide with surprise. Greg was back home, after three days. All of a sudden and thankfully so because Mycroft was beginning to worry slightly. “Hey, when did you return? Where do you want us to go? I could go with Harry now and you can change first.” Greg was still in dusty clothes, hairs disheveled. He had a helmet under his arm. He had been riding a motorcycle.
“This is for you,” Phillip Andersen placed a box right in the middle of the table, between Sherlock’s plate and Victor’s. That day Victor’s longstanding girlfriend Eva was also at the table. She was a member of the college’s administrative group.
“Sherl, you already have ten billion. You can pay for anything. You can take the whole country on a holiday if you so wish.”
“Ah the breakfast,” John said, greedily staring at the spread out form of his man next to him, “I had promised you that but we spent an hour and half in bed and…. We can convert that into brunch. I guess I’ll ask Mrs. Hudson to help with this. Only this time. I am sure she won’t mind.” He got out of bed and got into his clothes, wincing slightly when they felt too rough and too heavy on his skin. John frowned, now this was a very new thing! He had never felt burdened by clothes, especially his much worn and washed favorite house clothes. A pair of track pants and a short sleeved slightly loose O neck, he was quite fond of those and loved to lounge around in them while at home.
Jim’s eyes flashed fire and he breathed fire too as he spoke next. “Rubbish, is it?” His hands went to his hips and he suddenly seemed to have acquired some new confidence, “You will soon figure out what you’re getting into. Jim Moriarty isn’t accustomed to hearing threats nor refusals. Just you wait and watch. If I am not getting anything further from you, then I have no use for you……”
“Gretel,” John said as he combed his hairs, “Who is this visitor? Sherlock wasn’t expecting anyone. Is there a name he gave you?”
Half an hour later John was showered, as was Sherlock, and they were seated inside the tent with rudimentary cups, spoons and plates, enjoying what would be a ‘camping dinner’. This was the final step of Sherlock’s plans for the evening.
where we will run into them time and again and perhaps even have to interact with. And they are both fairly dishy and sexy. Young, both of them, in their early thirties. They drove down from London in a fancy SUV, I think it is one of the latest Lexus models.”
Half way into the second brandy, John had lost the battle. His senses now swimming with urges and desire, his limbs and skin flushed with the heat of the drink and Sherlock’s kisses and an animal instinct working inside him to claim this beautiful man, he could no longer hold himself back or go slow, as he had planned. Instead he pounced on Sherlock and lifted him in his arms.
Night time brought a new problem. They had been assigned only one bedroom but Sherlock didn’t seem to keen to share the bed that night. By then John was so upset with himself, so tense and nervous about his future with his housemate, that he took his ire out on Sherlock.
“Yes but that theory is too much of a stretch sir. Believe me I knew them, I’ve seen them suffer. They had to lock themselves in for weeks, just to ensure those closest to them would be safe and they wouldn’t unleash that terror on others.”
On their way back, John kept staring at Sherlock in awe. What he missed was that whenever he looked away, Sherlock also stared at him in open admiration and delight. “So,” the doctor said, “I saw some miracles today. You identified the criminal just by the way he held his pen!!!”
‘I felt that this hospital could benefit from a brighter painting in the reception area so I brought this one, from my own collection. Oh, well, I suppose I could meet Jawn too.’
John was about to snap but by then Sherlock was on the next call already. This time he was calling Mrs. Hudson and speaking far more politely than he had addressed her in years. “Hudders, I am so sorry to be a bother. But can you share the recipe for the apple pie and lemon tarts you make? I am trying to prepare some dessert but somehow it looks way different from what you bake. No, I will do this myself, even if that means burning my fingers a few times. Oh! Oh! Ohhhhh!
His profession was unique. He was a consultant/advisor/coach for people who needed special types of help. Someone who was perpetually out of favor with seniors at work, someone who was lackluster at romance, someone who simply didn’t know what kind of profession to choose, someone who was deep into tax or legal troubles, someone who had stage fright or claustrophobia, this was the man who was the answer to all their troubles.
John hung up and stared at Sebastian sadly, both of them uneasy and unable to reconcile with their decision of lying to their mates. They didn’t want to keep lying to themselves that all was well when all wasn’t well by a mile. “I feel horrible inside,” Sebastian said as they walked away from the public call booth, “They are always so eager to see us, so happy when we are together, I mean, I am very happy too, I am a very different and a better person when I am with Jimmy. Are we doing the right thing here John? Maybe we have made a mistake of some kind.”
Greg Lestrade looked at the details on his iPad, sitting in the home office room of his flat in Brentwood, London. Since no particular headway had been made on the murder case they had been assigned other cases and were shuttling between London and the suburbia town, doing a balancing act. Their molls had been planted everywhere, including in the Holmes estate in the form of a part time help who went there three times a week to support Ben with the parklands. The one who was at the hospital had proved to be the most successful and had given them the first breakthrough.
Sherlock nodded, “Yeah and as luck would have it, they had two rooms free because of last moment cancellations before the Easter fair. Just our rotten luck man!”
“That’s no problem at all,” he said happily, sending Sherlock off to fetch them from his bedroom, “You don’t need to wrap them in sparkling paper or pretty bows. None of us are ten-year-olds.” He quickly took out his own gifts and placed them underneath the tree, feeling a bit nervous. This was their first Christmas together, eleven months into this unique arrangement of living and solving cases together, and never before had he bought any gifts for his housemate. He thought he knew Sherlock well and all the gifts were things he would most definitely use…..still, he felt a bit nervous about the whole thing. What if Sherlock didn’t like any of them or laughed at them openly.
After two weeks Sherlock felt so restless he was unable to sleep properly at night. “Find out what’s happened dear,” Mrs. Hudson advised one evening as she cooked dinner and Sherlock folded the laundry.
Dame Rosalie wheezed a little, then took Sherlock’s hand, “You will become unpopular for sure but that doesn’t matter. Sometimes it takes a partner to sort out the house when the other partner is too kind and sometimes timid to throw trouble out of the window.”
On the tenth day Sherlock received three pieces of news. The first one was that John would be released in a couple of days. The second was that his brother Mycroft was back, had completed his backlog of work and court appearances and was coming over to see him that day. The third was that his presentation to the council who was supposed to fund his next research as well as validate the usage of the current one, was the next week.
“No, wait, no need to do that,” John stopped him, “We’ll take it out of the garden and to the outer ranch area. Where do these go?”
John stared after Jim as he walked off, talking away on his cell phone, hips swaying, a swagger in his steps. He sounded a bit sing-song still, but overall his speech and tone sounded far more stable and normal compared to the high-pitched shrillness of the earlier times.
“So your training is done and tomorrow morning you go back home,” Greg Lestrade announced as he, his three lady assistants, his secretary Pierre, Olga and John sat down for a special meal in John’s honor. This meal had been ordered from a gourmet restaurant, giving Olga an evening off as well. The usually reticent woman was quite friendly and chatty that evening. “To John,” she raised her glass and everyone followed suit, “May he succeed in his mission and we hope that every day and every single pound sterling he spent here, counts twice as much in worth and results!”
. Stumbling, blinking, shouting, panting and cursing he reached the bottom of the hill and almost knocked himself flat out against a rocky barrier. He stopped and managed to avoid colliding with a fairly huge boulder that blocked his view. After he crossed the boulder he came across a mid-size tree, a big branch of which was lying broken on the rocky ground. There, sitting on the cluster of stones a few feet away was a very alive and slightly injured John. With a bloodied forehead, hairs matted, a dirt streaked face and blue murder in his eyes he stood up the moment he saw Sherlock.
. It was John fucking Watson for real. After weeks of seeing imaginary John, Sherlock took a while to understand and accept this was really John who was sitting on a brand new shiny motorcycle, only six feet away from him. He was honking, waving his arm and grinning broadly behind the trendy racer’s helmet. When Sherlock finally smiled back, he took off the helmet and said, “Hop on.”
Sherlock knew of a thousand reasons to say no. He knew that if he turned and ran off he could easily justify his actions later, no matter how crazy they seemed right now. But he was dismayed to hear himself say ‘Yes, I suppose we could go there for a bit.’
Sherlock finished his milk and picked up a glass of water, draining that too. He pursed his lips and pulled the blanket up. “Don’t think too much Jawn. Sometimes you’ve got to let it go.”
“You want me to choose the item for you? Do you often ask random strangers such personal questions sir?”
“I-I-I am trying, I am just, ohhhh ouch!” Molly tripped on the edge of the road and fell on the sidewalk. Anthea stopped, turned and reached out to help her up when she saw something in the distance that froze her blood.
“Can we take the forklift truck, that small one? I always wanted to drive one. Farm machinery fascinates me, a lot actually.”
“So then Jim,” John asked, turning his attention towards the other guest, “What do you do? Are you also working with Tiger or are you two dating?”
“Six hundred pounds rent. But don’t tell the other tenants. They pay six to ten times this amount. I don’t want a protest here and other landlords baying for my blood.”
“John, I happen to be Sherlock’s brother in law. Yes, his elder sibling Myc and I are not married but we have been a couple for almost five years. I have known the Holmes family for a decade now and seen Sherlock back in his college days. The reason why I took some extra interest in your case is because you mentioned Sherlock’s name. My mother in law, my boyfriend and even I had been worried about him because he just didn’t seem to find a partner or even a date. He was so shy and always the typical workaholic, so we kept pushing him to socialize more, find someone special. When I met you I knew he couldn’t have made a better choice.”
“He’s a darling, he really is, but sometimes he says stuff that….sort of bruises people,” John said, feeling rather uncomfortable that he was badmouthing Sherlock.
“Had some personal work. Sorry to have kept you in the dark. Now, can you start work a little later today? Is there someone who can fill-in for you? Maybe two hours or so?”
If you must know, I don't plan for Sherlock to hurt John for real nor do I think John will be too cruel or vengeful towards him. Jim and Seb on the other hand, hmmm, let's see.
John just gestured for the two men to leave and on their way out they took Eckhart out of the room too. The door closed behind them, leaving John and Sherlock alone for the time being.
John bit back a pleased grin, “That sounds just about right. So for dinner, what would you prefer? Seafood? Italian? Indian? Thai? Mediterranean? I will book a table for two at one of the finest restaurants I know for each category.”
John looked for a moment at Sherlock’s lips. Heat spread in his groin and he looked away once more. His voice shook a bit and he hurriedly said, “No, nothing. No, actually something.”
“You need to get a sharp knife each, both of you, the sharpest you can find, then stab them at a safe spot on their bodies which won’t make them hurt too much nor be dangerous for them. You are a Doctor of Medicine, aren’t you John? I am sure you should be able to identify that spot. That way they won’t bleed out if you give them the care they need within the next few minutes. Or maybe they won’t need anything more than a bandage. Thigh, calf, arm.”
Miss Atkinson, one of the ladies at the end of the table and a lecturer in the Labor laws and personnel management course, quipped cheekily, “He said Sherlock has changed a lot.”
Sherlock registered the touch but didn’t really react. He didn’t have the strength or wakefulness to do so. It had been an early start to the day and, due to his habits of sleeping late, he hadn’t really hit the sack early the night before. Coupled with all the excitement and frolic of the day, the long drive and the galivant around the ranch, he suddenly found his eyelids weighing down heavily. He yawned again, feebly putting his palm over his mouth to cover it. “I-I am sorry…..” Sherlock rubbed his eyes, unaware of how cute he looked and how John’s eyes had been fixated on the slight show of his pink tongue, “I don’t mean to be rude but I can’t keep my eyes open anymore.”
John was about to step inside with all the items he had in his hands, silently cursing Sherlock for not even offering to relieve him off a few boxes and bags, when a loud squeal from a female voice made him stop, one foot in the door. Mrs. Hudson came rushing down the corridor and handed him a big bouquet of flowers. “Oops,” John went, going down on one knee as he tried to balance it all. “Pink roses, hypericum berries and yellow disbuds,” she gushed, “The first meal in the house needs to be romantic. Want me to help set the table?”
The group was greeted by Emily Madison and her daughter Edith, a bright and smiley twelve year old girl. She led them across the compact but cozy and neat sitting room to ‘Grampa’s study’ which was right next to the cottage style kitchen and hearth area. It was a small room and had shelves of books, an arm chair identical to the one on the patio, a desk and a chair meant for a senior citizen with foot and head rest and an attached small half-bathroom for his convenience. Marvin sat there, sipping herb tea and smoking a cigar which he said ‘he had cut down to one in three days from three a day’. He was snow haired and wrinkly but still had a strong back and an upright posture, his voice was still deep and steady and his eyes had retained nearly 80% of their functionality.
“It’s never too soon for anything. And so what if you’d never done this before. Neither have I. But I am very confident you’ll be gentle, kind and patient with me baby. I feel far more comfortable doing something like this with you, knowing you’d take extra care not to hurt me or make me feel pain beyond a point.”
“Yeah. Some people have that thing in them….they can repel and attract at the same time. But he is one
“No, fair demand it is,” John said, caressing the side of his face, “It’s a Sunday evening and you weren’t expecting this. Next time there will be a proper and timely warning. Or maybe the next dinner I attend will not be alone, but in company. Beautiful, gorgeous company.”
There was something about the way Sherlock called out to him that gave him a warm and fuzzy feeling in his chest. Six months into their unique professional and private arrangement, John was no closer to solving the mysterious attraction between them than he was on the first few days. He had tried self-exploration, asking himself questions that Dr. Carol Fletcher had advised him on, but the answers had frightened him so much he had stopped, completely.
“No Sherlock, it’s your special day so you enjoy with your boyfriend. Some other day bro….. I mean, son. I have someone else with me so we don’t want to crowd your table. But do remember this John, two’s company, even three’s a crowd. So the third person at your table should not be present at least in your evening’s programs. Which reminds me, you do have something planned for the evening as well, right? Movies, a quiet dinner, a long drive?”
“Short people usually get offended if asked about their height,” the woman tutted in, “Yes, by my estimates he would be five feet six inches, about 1.7 meters to Sherlock’s 1.82 meters. You’re like what…..1.89 meters, so he seems a bit too petite.”
“You can give him the car and take the balance money. In fact you can call him right now and tell him to be on his way. See over there boss, the same man has arrived and he is driving that very car now. Our car, the Pagani…..”
John’s hands moved to cup his face and the man moved closer as well. Sherlock smelled his aftershave and held his breath. He was feeling especially vulnerable that day and wanted to surrender to whatever this was…..except that he didn’t want to chase a mirage and look like a fool in the aftermath. He had to be sure first. Did John really mean they were boyfriends? Did he just give that hint?
Sebastian had no idea John’s sixth sense was correct and he was not ‘seeing things’. There was indeed a real presence there in the woods. Unnoticed by both of them someone really moved behind the bushes surrounding the cluster of oak, spruce and birch trees. As they turned and walked back to the car, a pair of eyes stared after their retreating figures and moved through the woods to watch them properly. The same pair kept staring after them as they boarded the vehicle, the engine started rumbling and soon the SUV moved back on to the main road leading to the village. Those eyes never took their gaze off and kept harking till the car moved all the way down the straight road and finally went out of sight as it took a corner where the road curved to the right.
Sometime around seven John finally fell asleep. Worries and confusion had kept him awake but the truth was that he was so exhausted he was ready to collapse. So when he did sleep, it was heavy, dreamless and very sound. One moment he was sliding back to a sleeping position next to Sherlock and the clock outside in the hallway was chiming to seven, the next thing he remembered was waking up feeling refreshed and splendidly awake, the same clock now striking two in the afternoon, and Sherlock lying next to him with his head on John’s stomach.
“Julia,” Mycroft picked her up and carried her back upslope while Greg took off his coat and covered her, “Julia, what happened to you? What’s the matter girl, speak up! Where is your boyfriend, where is Redmond, which way did he go?”
After a brief chat with Harry and her partner and Eckhart offering his apologies for misunderstanding him, Sherlock returned to the bedroom around noon to find John waking up again. This time he asked for coffee and after a hot mug of strong black brew he went for a shower and a proper shampoo and conditioning. His hair felt like straw, he said.
“I've done this before, as you know,” Sherlock started the story he wanted to tell John, so they could be transparent with him, honest, hide nothing,  “But last time I brought someone in….”
Jim pulled the form fitted black long sleeved T shirt over his head and tossed it aside, fingering his nipples with a grin.
“Wowzaa,” Sebastian exclaimed as Jim pushed him into the backseat of the car and started to close all the windows, “Someone is really horny!” Deep inside he was shitting bricks. Not so much for his own safety as he was doing so for his lover’s safety and wellbeing. Somewhere in the boot, along with his belongings and carefully concealed, was a dagger. He remembered asked Marvin if it should be made of silver and the old man had jocularly replied, “He is not a werewolf from a Stephen King movie good sir!”
The kiss inevitably deepened, each man exploring every nook and cranny of the other’s mouth, soft moans escaping and mingling together, teeth clashing against each other, saliva swapping and stubbles rasping softly. Slowly the kiss became more than a kiss, it grew into a frenzy and John found himself seated on a chest, an old fashioned trunk, with Sherlock on his lap and their arms tightly wrapped around one another. They kissed on and on, taking millisecond breaks for a quick and gasping breath of oxygen before insistently tongue-kissing each other. Slowly all other parts of their bodies participated; matching tenting in their trousers, hands roaming all over each other’s back and the back of their heads, torsos undulating and colliding as they moved back and forth in passion.
They woke up together two or three hours later, staring sleepily into each other’s eyes. Almost immediately they knew how their time at 221B Baker Street would go for the rest of the days they stayed here. None spoke a word, not a word of the previous night was mentioned, and they went about their day’s routine in complete silence. John wondered why men never shared thoughts. If they were women they would have talked up a storm already and laid the whole situation threadbare.
Her voice dropped, as did her ebullience. “Um….is it true you’re sharing a flat with Sherlock?” She asked, as if disappointed and curious at the same time. That expression and tone intrigued him and John lowered his eyebrows, “Yes, I am. To split costs we have decided to take up a flat together. It’s big enough for two people and the rent is not too much, a good bargain I say!”
John licked at his fingers and shook his head with a sneaky grin. Sherlock understood the joke and snorted, then let his head fall on John’s shoulder. “I can’t move.”
. Yes it was true he didn’t feel like having sex with Mary while with Sherlock it had more or less become a routine. They had even stopped questioning their desires, they just
John felt all those sounds and sights fade away suddenly. It felt rather odd, as if someone was shoving him into another world, a world that was strangely familiar.
“Oh we are sure she will be,” Jim said enthusiastically. “Yeah, and as soon as we know she’s out of danger we will go to the fair. It’s the first day,” Sherlock added.
“Ahhhh,” John broke free from the kiss and raise and bowed his head backwards, eyes glazed over with desire and big with the pleasant shock of the sensations.
“Just one thing,” Sebastian asked with a slight hesitation in his voice, “Is he someone you are also….. I mean to say do you and he….. are you two….. you know what I mean.” Jim bit back a grin, he found the other man’s jealousy cute and heartwarming. “No,” he decided to put the other man out of his misery, “We are not together, never were. But we do share a bond as friends, a very deep bond, a longstanding one too. Difficult to explain in words.”
Sherlock and Mary looked at each other and from her expression Sherlock could easily tell she was ‘not in’ on this. She was genuinely surprised, as surprised as he had been by John’s unlikely confession. This was John’s own opinion and not a planned move by the two. “I heard you,” John answered honestly, “Since you were telling Nurse Morstan you prefer honesty, I told you the truth. I did listen in, I eavesdropped to be precise, and I am a little appalled that such a request has been made to you. I’d rather stay in the APS, of which I have heard a lot. In fact right now my roommate is in physiotherapy. He told me his housemaid had once lived there and was now living freely, earning as a domestic help and cook and had even got rights to see her kids again. I’d be able to stay there…..”
“Baby boy, you are everything I ever wanted in my life. You have no idea how hard it was for me. Seven days without seeing you.”
“Well, as long as you adore them so much….. it doesn’t matter who gifted them,” his mummy said and, after kissing the top of his head, got up to head to the breakfast room. Sherlock was about to follow when a fancy bookmark, in the shape of a ‘sausage’ fell out of one of the books. The words written on it made him smile, reassuring him that last night’s encounter had been
“Is that so?” John stepped protectively before Sherlock, “Okay, we will handle this. Actually, allow me to do that. Please stay in the car, okay?”
One of his fellow students, a hot and attractive woman named Pamela, had an eye for the green-eyed, tall and lean young man.
“Sherlock,” John replied, “He is a scientist. While he lives here with his family, he is no villager, hick or bumpkin. He has been educated at Eton and Cambridge. He earns more than a qualified professional living in London.”
John stopped struggling and Jim finally let go but by then Greg had planted the revolver on John’s temple, while Phil stood protectively before Sherlock and Sally also pointed her gun at the blond man. “Protecting a criminal, wow, the Great Scotland Yard,” John spat on the ground with so much venom that Sherlock shuddered visibly. “Jawn, it’s me, Sherlock, your Sherl, we are engaged, don’t you remember me? What’s gotten into you suddenly?”
“Crying?” He cleared his throat and tried to sound extra cheerful, “What? C’mon Mary, you don’t think I will be crying, of all things. Yeah, a bit of a bad throat. I had a shouting match today, at a case, during a showdown. That’s all. But I am alive and kicking, completely hale and hearty.” He paused and said, “I heard Sherlock and you met today or was it yesterday. How did it go? Did he manage to scare the living daylights out of you or annoy the hell out of you?”
“That is true,” Sherlock didn’t know what else to say, he was confused by his attraction towards John and his inability to say no to him or ignore him. John immediately jumped on the bandwagon and put his hand lightly on the small of Sherlock’s back, “Then we should go and find out. Rather, you show me and I find out. My treat. Shall we then, Sherlock?”
They kissed again, this time he tasted blood and realized it was not his own. His teeth had clashed against Sherlock’s soft lips. Yet, the copper taste on their tongues served to arouse them even more and John pulled Sherlock closer, throwing caution to the winds, to his inhibitions, to all those homophobic comments he had heard and internalized before, to the very distraught voice in his head that told him to stop,
“I like this too,” Sherlock admitted, “But you have a private theater at home. We can watch movies anytime we want. If we’re going out then let’s watch a concert, performance or a play instead. That would make the day more special.”
“Come, let’s have some champagne then. The best in town is waiting or us to uncork and start the party!”
John rubbed his face down with his hands, eyes burning, body tired beyond tired. Nothing will change this. I just had sex with my housemate. I had sex with a man.
John nodded and smiled, “Yes, tomorrow is fine. As for my address, don’t worry about that. You don’t have to go looking for me. We will meet tomorrow, right here, beneath this sign post, at 1 am sharp. And if you are game we can even go watch a movie!”
O God, she’s right, it must be something totally inconsequential. Still, John was his usual patient and kind and indulgent self with Sherlock. “Hey there Sherl, how are you? Sorry, had to leave in a hurry this morning but I am sure I can make it up to you by buying dinner on my way home?”
John pulled him back up on the bed, “Don’t worry, even I am hungry as a wolf. I just asked for some food and some coffee and tea to be sent up. It’s seven am, a bit too early for us but I suppose we can make an exception for today. We really do need to eat.”
Sebastian was looking at him with lifted brows, half-laughing and shaking his head. John shut his mouth, there was nothing he could say to make his foolishness sound any better or worse. He had just blabbered out the truth and the truth sounded just as ugly as it did in his thoughts. “Captain John Watson,” Sebastian snort giggled, “I have to tell you a story. You remember back in the army days, during our brief posting at Iraq, we had this guy in our unit who worked in the communications department? He was a junior officer and his name was Andrew Kirk Cherrington. Yes, that fellow! Ruddy skinned redhead with bright green eyes, medium height, rather bright and quick on the job?”
“Don’t you find something very suspicious and uncanny?” Sally asked, to which Greg gave her a confused look. “What do you mean by that? What is suspicious?”
John had, on purpose, kept Mary away from Sherlock and hadn’t even mentioned her during any of his conversations with his housemate. In fact, he hadn’t even told Mary about Sherlock for the first two months but she found out when one of the more famous cases made it to national news and Sherlock’s celebrity status soared. “So you are a sleuth moonlighting as a doctor,” she had laughed, expressing keenness to meet the great detective. John had resisted, for several months.
Feeling a need to explain himself further, John took out three boxes from a gym bag he was carrying. He handed them to Sherlock and said, softly, “You know Sherlock, last evening I had a moment of epiphany and realization. When I saw you held at gunpoint, when I saw you in that scuffle and heard you groan as you punched and also took a couple of punches, I knew for a fact that all this we share today could be gone in just a single moment. And here we are, like utter dorks, wasting away whatever opportunities we have of being happy, of being together. So I let you sleep on while I went shopping. I got these things for you, please open them and tell me whether you like them or not.”
“Normally I tell you to be kinder,” John looked at him, laughing at the ‘fiancé’ “But here I say, bring it on!!!”
“As he grew into a teen he became more and more closed and guarded. Earlier he’d come to me with his troubles, if not to mummy or daddy. But as we grew up, the difference in our ages screwed up our equation. I got busy with studies, friends, ambitions, and I admit I ignored him.”
“Is that what?” Sherlock handed John the keys, “The other set is with your new housekeeper, Caroline. She is inside, cooking some lunch for you.”
“Thank God for that powerful sense of smell,” Sherlock grinned broadly and wiped his face with the hand towel, turning towards his cheerful friend, “So what did you walk in all bouncy for?” Jim stretched his legs and arms lazily and said, “I am wondering
Anthea was shifted by a helicopter ambulance to London for further treatment. She had been badly disfigured in the attack and her health was very fragile. Even in terms of mental wellness she was not out of the woods yet and needed constant sedation and surveillance. People at Beckett were totally baffled by her situation and didn’t know how to explain the unusual attack.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, wake up, please wake up,” he gently nudged the younger man at first and, when it didn’t work, pushed at him harder, “WAKE UP! You must be thinking I am someone else.” He paused and when those green eyes opened to look at him, unseeing and glazed over with sleep, he whispered close to the man’s ears, “This is me, your housemate John Watson. Not your girlfriend. Please, move a little because I need to take a piss urgently.” Realization finally dawned on Sherlock but he didn’t seem the least bothered to wake up on this bed or in this room. With a small nod he blinked, yawned and rolled away from John, leaving the older man with pins and needles in his arm and leg.
“Yeah, just fine,” Sherlock lied, knowing he was far from fine. He couldn’t concentrate on anything nor focus on any conversation going on. Even when his elder brother Mycroft called to inform him that he wanted to meet Sherlock’s new boyfriend the next day, along with his own boyfriend, have a cozy
“No,” John was beckoning out to the other beast with his outstretched arm, his curled fingers gently moving back and forth and summoning the fierce predator closer. “Do not harm them Sherlock, they were here to kill a menace to humanity and I am sure you’re not one. You never will be. You are a scientist who creates and invents for the benefit of mankind, you’re not a cruel monster. Come here baby.”
“What’s the matter Sebby baby?” Jim asked as he turned the music on and sang along, mouthing the words between singing the catchy tune aloud, “You seem ‘not yourself’ this evening. If it’s not me, if it’s you, then I would like to know what is bothering you.” Sebastian had barely heard the tail end of that statement and quickly tried to give some reassurance to his lover that all was well. “No, it’s not even me. I am just…. As I said, tired. Didn’t really sleep too well last night and I have a slight headache as well, pulled a hamstring while doing the weights last morning, that’s about it.”
Two weeks into his return and one day before Sherlock’s birthday, John got a call from Greg Lestrade. Excited, he answered the call and almost immediately started rattling off his success story with Sherlock. “It’s not just Sherlock and Phil who seem to have noticed the changes in me, I made some of my colleagues and employees realize who the boss is,” John said excitedly, “I want you to come to my office and observe. You’ll be assured I am not exaggerating. Your training and mentoring has helped me garner respect all around, even with my colleagues.”
“Not sure why anyone would need to worry about a thirty year old man,” Sherlock said a bit coldly, “Mrs. Hudson?”
On Friday Sherlock woke him at midnight. “Hey,” he sat up, rubbing his eyes and noting that Sherlock was all limbs and skin, clad in
After the magical night they had this felt like a total letdown. But he was prepared to adjust to the situation since Sherlock’s duties were important and he didn’t want to begrudge him that. That changed however when he heard the next set of words exchanged. Lucy was saying to Molly, “Must be a trick to get him there. I heard about this really nice, dashing man…..”
“There is a way to end everything my dear girl. You only need to know how. But tell me first, which one of you is infected? Or is it someone else on behalf of whom you are here?”
John remember how touchy the man was about his prematurely receding hairline. “Okay, sure,” he said, focusing on more important matters, “Um….did you hear anything about Sherlock yet?”
Phil appeared so comically taken aback that Greg laughed out loud despite his best efforts to rein in his laughter. Mycroft was a natural poker face, his profession having taught and conditioned him to keep his emotions in check. Still, he grinned slightly and raised his brows as he repeated the statement with more emphasis, “Make that, my longstanding boyfriend.” Phil staggered backwards a few steps, as if those words had hit him like a club. For the longest time he could not say a single word, completely dumbfounded and totally screwed by his own arrogance and conniving ways. Though he didn’t feel sorry for this man, Greg decided to at least put an end to his misery and confusion.
Once again John wondered what made his housemate such a legend and so often mentioned. Why was everyone so ‘aware’ that he was going to share lodgings with Sherlock and so keenly interested in the dynamics of their relationship?
“Allow me to explain,” Sherlock seemed bemused by John’s confusion, like a titan looking down on a Lilliput with some amount of compassion but also a dollop of pity, “It’s not that difficult to understand. I am a detective, a consulting detective who investigates and solves crimes and nabs criminals, with or without the help of the Yard or Mi5, or any other legal authorities. I am not a private eye, which means I don’t spy on rich men’s plastic wives and take pics of them making out with their boy-toys, nor do I investigate what employees do in their downtime and report those to the bosses. My work, as compared to a private investigator’s, is slightly more elevated in responsibility, involves a lot of complexities and attracts a lot more danger. That’s precisely why I wanted to see if you are up to it.”
Slowly some memories came back to him and he slowly blinked and rubbed his eyes, trying to get rid of the grogginess. Were they dreams or was it reality?
. John kissed Sherlock’s temple and whispered, “I like to call it sex. Or making love. You might wanna call it your initiation, breeding, or an experiment with rather pleasurable results. I promise the results will surprise you! Don’t worry, I will be gentle. I am mindful of your injuries so allow me to take care of you while you lie back and just enjoy it all.”
“Very well,” Sherlock shrugged, “Why this hesitation? He is welcome to spend time with me and once he is better…..”
“Do you have to do this?” Sherlock’s words and tone had no parity, he was giggling, his eyes shining with mischief.
That was when John realized Sherlock needed space. Unlike women, men never felt comfortable expressing emotions or showing themselves in a distressed or vulnerable state. Perhaps his lingering presence was stressing Sherlock out so much that he was gripped by those psychosomatic symptoms of gagging, dry heaves and puking even though there wasn’t anything to throw up.
After a pause he added, softly, almost in a whisper, “You are a good man John Watson. You’re humble, modest, sincere.”
Too tired and at the end of his tether to think of anything else but sleep, John dropped Sherlock on the bed, took off his shoes and socks and belt, then gave up on the rest of his clothes and let him curl up. He dropped his own clothes quickly, leaving his undershorts and undershirt on, and got in on the other side of the bed. He pulled the covers over both of them but Sherlock soon hogged them all, almost mummifying himself on the blanket and snored louder than before. John stared at him in dismay and shook his head, before he dropped on the bed out of sheer exhaustion. He was asleep as soon as his head had hit the pillow.
“No, I can’t, I can’t imagine Sherlock Holmes being scared of anything at all,” the good doctor said as he gently lay his lover down on the bed and began to work on his clothes. Sherlock aided him by lifting his butt, taking his shirt off and turning to the side so John could expose more and more skin. When he was totally naked except for the plaster on his foot Sherlock shyly whispered, “My biggest fear was that I’ll die a virgin.”
The woman seemed uncomfortable but she quickly clued on and gave a bland, foolish smile. “Yes, yes, of course, it’s your decision…. We are happy to support, yes.” Phillip, or ‘Phil’ as he was called, nodded his head hard and smiled at Greg. “Could you wait outside while I call my client and speak with him,” Greg Lestrade said, pressing a button to remotely unlock the door to his office. He was looking keenly at the profiles and didn’t even give the two of them a glance as he made a gesture towards the now-wide-open open door, “It will be a Skype call and I am not sure he’d want others present when I show him the three shortlisted candidates and he makes the final choice.”
“Spoke to mummy,” Sherlock shared his own good news, “I think we are all set for tomorrow. She seems very, very positive that there will be no problems and you will be received warmly and cordially.”
Sherlock. He continued, not going overboard at once but giving a bit more each time, until Sherlock screamed and came.
“Now you may wanna ask why they can’t increase the number of people at the station,” Jim cracked up with laughter and Sally and Phil, taken aback, quickly mumbled their goodbyes and rushed into their vehicle. Greg appreciated the joke and winked at Jim, “Always ready with a cutting edge response eh Jim? Well, the reason we aren’t more in number is because we have, for the past thirty five years, managed with these numbers. From the time my dad Gordon was the inspector to the time that I am.”
“It is more like ‘caviar keeps giving him food poisoning’. Some time ago he was engaged, maybe about five years ago, and to a woman. No one ever got to know who she was and what she looked like. Suddenly the engagement was off, the woman had disappeared and John made no comments. None whatsoever.”
They danced the evening away and popped some bubbly every hour, raising a toast to various causes and people, laughter and banter and the clink of glasses and cutlery on fine china plates filled the huge mansion with cheer and life.
Against his genuine concerns about the environment, he flushed the condom this time instead of tying it off and disposing it safely in the garbage. He lingered around in the bathroom for a long time, hoping to calm himself down as he grappled with this sudden change in his sex-life. Mary and he were not a highly sexed couple. Their attraction was mainly intellectual and emotional. But that didn’t stop them from enjoying two rounds of sex once a week, at her place.
The cars drew in under the huge portico on which there was a beautiful terrace with potted plants, canopies and patio furniture. Sherlock would have looked on in awe at it had it not been for Greg introducing him to the staff. There were twenty of them, starting from the valet/butler and head housekeeper to a team if cooks, cleaners, errands boys and girls, gardeners, grounds keepers and even the estate’s own and dedicated plumber and electrician. Sherlock maintained an absolutely straight face as he was introduced as the ‘master’s’ fiancé and gracefully accepted the warm welcome extended towards him by the group of retainers who were immediately on their toes to tend to every need of his.
“Oh no, the choice of the dishes lies with me,” Phil thumped his chest, “As always, I know exactly what he likes and which are the signature dishes here. Hey there, Ivan, bring us the famous pitcher of Moscow Blitz. Then ask Dasha in the kitchen to prepare three portions of Chicken a la Kiev for me and my guests, with extra pepper and butter……”
“Sorry bro, but things between us will never be on an even keel,” Sebastian spoke with a slight edge to his voice, a deep voice that sometimes made John nervous. As kids, the height difference and later as young adults Sebastian’s deep authoritarian voice and military exploits had made him feel not only inadequate at times but also intimidated. But he was a changed man now, thanks to Sherlock, and with his confidence restored he felt more prepared than ever to take Sebastian head on.
“Strangest thing, we didn’t see any of that. When we searched for the animal, we saw a human there instead. He had been shot through the head. Naturally we were all alarmed and scared and we decided then and there to bury that incident. We dumped the body in the water several miles ahead and got the boys treated in the next village for their injuries. But the disturbing thing that really happened was something else.”
.” Mycroft suppressed his chuckle. He found this funny, if also slightly weird because Jim was twenty-two, the same age as Sherlock. “And I am assuming that tonight you forgot to tell them about staying out late. If they know I am with you I doubt if they’d be worried. They’ll be totally at ease…..”
“On the contrary,” Sebastian exhaled and spoke in a tone that reflected a sense of relief, “I don’t think so at all, I believe you are as sane as a man who’s conducting a life-saving surgery.”
“So you really exist?” Sherlock asked, finally getting to the questions he had set aside for this man who brought joy and cheer and gifts for all. “Well, what do you think?” Those brown eyes twinkled behind the glasses. “I think you do.” “Why?” “Because I believe you do.” “That is the answer Sherlock. If you believe in something, you see it as real. If you don’t, then nothing can convince you.”
“When did I commit to this?” Sherlock asked, eyes wide. Next to him Eva bristled with anger, “Whose idea is it Phil? Tomorrow is the annual day of the institution, any item to be presented on stage is usually agreed upon almost a month ago!”
Sherlock was jerking himself hard and when John pulled his fist back, he whined and almost snapped at his lover. John chuckled, the wanton desperation in his young lover boosting his ego, his testosterone levels rising and rising as he slathered his cock and Sherlock’s entrance with some slippery and warm lube. Sherlock keened again, finger nails digging into John’s side, leaving marks of crescent moon shape there. In places he split the skin, drawing faint traces of blood, but John felt no pain. Just more desire, more pleasure, more eagerness to continue this until they couldn’t go on anymore.
The production assistant let out a colorful expletive and stormed off, muttering about how unfair life was. Laughter ensued in the studio and everyone had a chuckle at her expense. Soon they received the photographs from John Watson’s office and it turned out to be exactly what they had anticipated. One mug shot of him, one long distance shot of him with a well-known social worker and several pics of the community service he did or charities he promoted, new business ideas and logos.
“Hello there, look what we got,” John grinned as he saw the strawberry flavored lube. He uncapped it and the sweet scent of strawberries filled the room. “I had no idea you are this prepared for…..” he stopped, remembering a simple fact. People did use lube for masturbation.
Jim snapped, “You silly nanny goat, have you no common sense at all? You let him take the plunge with someone who could very well be a criminal, an assassin, a thief, an escaped convict or even a staunch liar. How the hell do you know that he doesn’t remember the past? This poor man, a Superintendent at Scotland Yard, has been trying his best to tell you guys to be careful but no, it’s more important to grab a John Doe so as to prove something to Jim Moriarty. Utterly ridiculous.”
“A hundred and sixty million Jim took, using you and the information you shared innocently with him. Then Sebastian happily lapped up another seventy five million from me, in the form of casino shares and a luxury penthouse of 6000 square feet. I feel bloody robbed and looted.”
“I have a class but I can postpone that to later today. I could ask…. Mrs. Chakraborty to take the class instead. She has asked me to fill-in for her several times last month. In fact she can take all three of my classes and one is an extra class, so I can take it online later in the evening….. No, I didn’t mean to say I won’t attend work today, I was just wondering aloud……” Sherlock blushed deep red and looked away.
John was also thinking the same thing. He had to let his hand linger downwards and grasp and squeeze Sherlock’s firm buttock, but only after pausing for a moment and taking a good look into his green eyes, gauging the urgency there.
“C’mon, please get up, on your feet,” he grabbed John who did as he was told, “I want to take a photograph of you against the backdrop of that rain in the distance. It will be a perfect camera moment. Everyone will marvel at the picture later.”
“John Hamish Watson, now I know who’s the architect of your success,” he said darkly as he sat at the airport that same evening, waiting to take the next available flight to England, Gatwick airport, “I sure hope you have enjoyed your success so far because it’s coming to an end. I am coming back to England and I
Mycroft had almost walked into a passing vehicle. He was crossing the highway like a blind man, as if he couldn’t see or even hear the traffic. Fortunately this side of the highway wasn’t too busy and he didn’t get run over. Greg crossed after him, more cautiously, calling out to him all the time. “Hey, Mycroft, hey?”
“Yes but they never make such hasty and abrupt plans. Even Eurus is going. I am just wondering if they are aware that…..??”
Everyone became a bit tense at that point, wondering if they had raked up a painful past of the old man and if he would be interested in talking at depth on this. But Marvin seemed to be a man made of steel and didn’t show any signs of distress. There was sadness in his eyes though as he spoke about his younger brother, a fine young lad with blond hair, blue eyes and a strapping build pretty much like Sebastian. “We lost him way too early, at the age of twenty five. But he had become a menace to society and when people are overwhelmed by evil, sooner or later they turn on their own families. He had become a threat to my wife and young child, our mother and our sister. Therefore we were left with only one choice at that point.”
He got several proofs that John had not only made the best of his lessons but also improvised upon them for better benefits.
“I shall get you meds to ease that off,” Sherlock suggested, “Why suffer when we have so many quick and good remedies. The doc did say such aches are common and I remember you didn’t have any for almost a month. Now suddenly again…..” John didn’t hear the rest as Sherlock’s voice faded into the background and he went into their room to fetch the medical kit and some water. In the distance he saw the lights of the nearest village. The lake was also illuminated well, as was the foregrounds and pier of the hotel. A small group of holidayers were singing and chatting around a bonfire. A couple of families and three couples were scattered on the lawns. Some of the terraced openings of the rooms downstairs also showed guests either lounging on recliners or laughing and joking animatedly.
She and Molly had been given the adjacent guest rooms downstairs while Anthea got the spare bedroom upstairs alongside Agnes’. It was apparently Agnes’ elder brother Robert’s room, he and his wife lived and worked in London. After a quick trip to the washroom, Irene was about to get into bed again when she heard a loud screech from the next room where Molly was. “Oh God, now what happened to that mouse?” She muttered, concerned, and quickly threw on a robe and rushed outside to check. She saw Anthea coming down the stairwell with equal haste in her steps and concern in her eyes.
Later John called and started making odd noises when I told him the nurse had heard the exact same things I had told her. I am sure now it’s his work. My poor Jawn is so stressed out nowadays.
“Now,” he said after another week had passed, “I will help you understand your date. What should you look for when you’re with your beloved and want to gauge their mood, intentions and desires? It’s always preferred to be on the same page instead of making wild guesses.”
He reopened his eyes! “Jawwwwwn,” Sherlock roared out in fear and loss and rushed towards the dangerous, sloping trail that went down into the ravine.
Eurus stopped weeping and grabbed John’s hand, “You mean it? You really think you can pull it off John?”
“Superintendent, I’d call it ‘let’s start NOW’,” Jim stated and ran to the hallway, shoes in his hands and talking about the route.
Mary added, “Two thieves were released the same day and one of them died too. It might have been them who attacked John.”
Sherlock almost did a facepalm. But he had to ask the question. “But why is that so Mr. Freeman? It is a damaged piece, is it?”
“Where were you? Why weren’t you picking up my calls?” Sherlock demanded, putting the cocktail glass back on the counter without sipping it.
“It is your life, so I shall draw the line here,” Sebastian asked for round three of their whiskies, “But if I were you I’d take a call and stick to my decision. But before you do decide, think about which one you wanna let go of. Because there’s no way you can have both of them.”
“I am not passing any of his payment requests and voucher. Also, some of the money he has extracted in the last year, which is still not transferred, will be swiftly moved into a suspense account and taken back into our company account. Total savings of sixteen million easily!”
“I mean,” said the smaller man, prowling around Sherlock in circles, “You sleep with him, live with him, enjoy his company, but don’t forget where you belong darling!!!”
“My brother could have become a scientist or a scholar, like our parents,” Mycroft continued, “Or a government official like me, maybe our best agent here. He could have become an astronaut or a concert violinist or a startup wizard with a brilliant product idea. But he chose to be a jack of three trades. Cacophonous violinist/criminal profiler/sleuth. Working on his own, his aversion towards authority and discipline so huge that he is mostly disliked despite his work speaking volumes for itself. His eccentricity extends towards the way he spends his money and the way he spends his money also alerts me to what he’s up to. A big transfer to a certain someone…..oh I have to figure out whatever the hell is up with this mystery receiver, because he might be an African warlord masquerading as a pirate.”
“Pity he doesn’t remember,” Craig replied, shaking his head regretfully, “He was and is an extraordinary person, I am sure of that. The day they find out, all these men would be groveling before him. Poor guy, strange how a sudden twist of fate turns your life upside down.”
“How many cars?” Sherlock asked as they entered the inner sanctum of the property, which was cordoned off by a stone wall, electric fencing, dozens of cameras and security devices and a large automated gate that was manned 24/7 by a group of armed men and dogs.
“He is also a big genius, like Sherlock, yeah? Maybe he can help locate our boy and within the time frame of say…..six hours? We need him here at twelve, right? Come on, call Mycroft and ask him to speak to that….Semtex….sorry James, James Moriarty. By the way, does he still like… kill people and all that?”
just give the blond man more time to get his memory back and reclaim his life in some way. But, just as she stood up, her common sense held her back. People were not to be trusted easily, she had learned that the hard way and she would be damned if she allowed anyone to take advantage of Sherlock, even if it was unknowingly and unintentionally done.
He promptly took the menu card from Sherlock’s hand and said, “The usual one eh? Chicken ala Kiev and an olive and potato salad to go with it?”
John’s heart almost stopped. He looked at Sherlock through wide, bewildered eyes, his mouth falling open. A sudden bolt of guilt shot up in his chest and throat and blocked whatever words he was about to say. He went on the back foot and averted his gaze from Sherlock, suddenly feeling like an ant under a microscope. “I-I am not sure how….meeting Mary is related to whatever we are talking about.”
This was so not the detective’s style! Leather bottoms, shiny and skin tight, an almost see-through white shirt, curls tamed and pulled backwards with a band, trendy pair of Oxfords, and was that a dash of kohl in his eyes and some gloss on his lips. Even his cheeks looked a bit…..colored. “Have you applied makeup Sherl?” John asked, taken aback by the change. But he had to admit Sherlock looked delicious like that, anyone who saw him like that would have an incredible urge to throw him down and just take him.
“Dr. John Hamish Watson,” the man spoke in that same measured, polished voice, only this time it had a layer of snootiness hidden underneath, “Born and raised in east borough, to parents who were both in government jobs, the younger of two siblings, one elder sister Harriet, older than you by a year and half. Parents deceased. Sister divorced. Two properties, one in Berkshire where Harriet lives and one in Leyton, which is in your name but you refuse to stay there because you want the Berkshire property. You draw a handsome pension, got a lump sum for the temporary disability you faced and currently with St Bartholomew as a general surgeon……the childhood and schooling, where is that?”
