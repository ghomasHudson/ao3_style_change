You: Mycroft closed his eyes. He was going to have to increase surveillance again on Greg's team. Sometimes he wanted to grab Greg's shoulders and shake him. He brought Greg's palm to his lips and kissed it. "You make me want to tie you to our bed and not let you go."
Stranger: "Well you usually only smile at corpses so I feel quite special at the moment." Greg said softly, running his thumb across the back of Sherlock's palm.
Mycroft laughed. “Ah. Yes. We’re not so dissimilar from humans. We’re getting married. We’ll have a wedding. You’ll get to see Mummy in full wedding-planning mode. But then, afterwards will be some things that we don’t share with outsiders.”
Sherlock’s arms were pinned neatly behind his back in the shirt, and John grinned down at him. “Spanking and bondage in one night, John? We’re getting rather adventurous, don’t you think?”
Maribella Holmes was a strong supporter of tradition, and now that Myrcroft and his omega wife, Anthea, had produced their second child, she had turned her attention to her younger son. Sherlock had spent years wandering around Europe, drugged up, strung out, and generally not in any right mind to have a child. But now that he was clean, had been for a good number of years now, it was time for him to follow the proud tradition of ensuring the Holmes family line.
Then John smacked Sherlock’s hip, making him groan. “Think I could make you cum just like this, love? Think I could make you cum if I spank your delectable arse?”
home. I do hope we’re not interrupting anything.” Mycroft smiled obsequiously, umbrella in hand. He walked in and Greg Lestrade followed.
“Ahh.” John looks around the room again, taking in the details anew. “Your home is very nice. I thought you had a place in London?”
“Sherlock made it, if you’ll believe it,” Greg said as he stood up. “Yeah, I know,” he said at the look on John’s face, “wonders will never cease with these two.” He paused as he reached the door. “Don’t shoot the messenger, but Mycroft wants to see you.”
Stranger: Sherlock made a noise of thought from where he laid on the sofa and waved a hand at John without looking at him.
It shocked James more than he’d like to admit to learn that he’d been speaking to an audience of one. And his delight at realizing he’d won their support was only slightly mitigated by the unsettling knowledge that Mycroft Holmes was far more than he appeared.
Mycroft should have consulted him on the candidates. He knew John better and was certain the alpha his cow of a sibling picked was the wrong choice. He looked boorish from the service photos and was too tall for John. The entire situation was moronic. John would be made to mate with a stranger to protect him from having strangers try to mate with him. He should have stolen John’s papers from Mycroft and forged the signature of someone currently in the morgue. Why hadn’t he thought of that before they were out of Mycroft’s clutches?
“But not on the consequences. Why do you insist on riling me when you have no intent to act on my interest? You just like the attention for its own sake. You don’t want me.” Sherlock was angry but unable to resist drinking in the sight of John’s nearly bare form.
Sherlock was not satisfied by that response. “Did you want to sleep with him?” Part of Sherlock didn’t want to hear the answer. Moran was obviously a thug and if John had been forced, that would be unacceptable. If John’s answer was yes, then Sherlock didn’t need to learn about the man’s poor taste. Knowing what kind of telly he enjoyed was quite bad enough, even if Sherlock did deign to watch it with him.
“That’s right, she mentioned the military. I’ll have to fix that,” Victor said, rising to his feet and pulling up something else on his phone.
When this was over, John would be on his fifth line—first had been his father, may that bastard rot in hell, then Harry, Victor, same sentiments, Mycroft, and now Sebastian. The form only had six lines, so John wondered what proper society would call him for that.
Recognizing the look, and the impending verbal lashing he was about to endure, John hit back first. “Damnit, Sherlock, practicality has to feature somewhere in this experiment. Come on.” He beckoned Sherlock to follow him.
They fucked like this until, in a fit of need to feel John against him, no arms between them, Sebastian grabbed up his wrists and held them over his head, still thrusting wildly against John’s cock and stomach. The feel of John writhing under him, his scent, holding him there, finally having him, god yes, and he was coming, hard. Bliss and heat enveloping him fully. He kept John’s wrists pinned with one hand and quickly caught up their cocks again with the other to ride out his aftershocks and take John over the edge. It was thankfully slicker now with his own come coating them.
“I’ve met powerful gits before, and they didn’t impress me by feeling me up.” John was keeping his tone calm, because if this was his usual flavor of alpha, raising his voice was only like to spur him on. John set his shoulders back, firm but not a pugnacious. “Now, if you’ll excuse me,” he brushed past the man.
John glowered at him. “Oh, you’ll learn to appreciate it well enough, too, Watson,” the alpha looked smug, “I love a defiant omega. And I knew your face was good from her pictures, but that scent is just treacherous. Puts me over the edge. I was dying to get my hands on you at the pub last night…” Victor had dropped to one knee and was groping him now, as if to demonstrate.
He’d unfairly snapped at Sherlock for not scenting him as a preventive, when it was Sebastian he should have thought to ask before going out. Sherlock could, like everything thing with his transport, control his own scents in an almost robotic manner. He’d only begrudgingly scented John on other cases, when they were undercover, but that wasn’t his job anymore. Not that it ever had been.
“Yeah, shame about her personality. She told me you were dangerous and asked if I was your sponsor.” He chuckled at the idea. “But I have serious doubts you’d need the lat-” He trailed off at the piercing look on the other’s face. “No way.”
“Not really. I’m open to the preferences of my omega, of course, but I’ve never seen myself as much of family man. Course, my own father left it up to my mother, and ended up enjoying the role, so maybe I could change. But no, don’t care about keeping up the family line.”
“Of course, but we can sort out the minutia of the first session in a moment.” She gave him a penetrating look. “In agreeing to this, I am trusting that you know what you are doing regarding John. And his tolerance for this arrangement.”
I probably should have explained this in the last chapter notes for people not familiar with them, but I assume fictional suppressants are like real birth control, and have different forms with different characteristics. I'm a bad writer for clarifying in the notes instead of the story, but just know that for this world, shot suppressants, which John was on, are more like a hybrid of IUDs and shot birth control, in that they last long term without any heats.
“Not like it matters what he thinks, once you made up your mind. He could hardly stop you from giving him away to any idiot.”
Eventually he could hear rustling (Sherlock cleaning himself he supposed). Sherlock still said nothing, though apparently permitted to. Minutes passed. Then, from the creak of a nearby floorboard, John knew Sherlock was standing over him.
They fell into a routine comfortably and quickly after the first night, with little discussion about it. John worked his shifts at the military center, but in his free time would help Sherlock on cases. It wasn’t as though John could fill his spare time dating betas anymore, like he normally would when stationed home, and Sherlock was fascinating, frustrating, and utterly dazzling to be around. It wasn’t a bad trade off in John’s mind. After cases, they would often get dinner, as John liked to see Sherlock was eating, though tonight they had grabbed take away to have at Sherlock’s flat. It was his second visit there and John decided it was a cozy, quirky place with character, though he quite wanted to tidy it.
He could put out like this on demand if he had to, and Sebastian hadn’t raised any objections to the fare of the evening, but it’d been a while since he’d had penetrative sex on the receiving end. Even longer since he’d had a heat. Christ had the last one been during med school? He sighed. With his new suppressants, that was coming eventually too. All in all, he needed more physical and mental prep time.
“Fix?” John’s brain felt thick as tar. He blinked up at the alpha a moment before realizing what he meant. “No…please, no, not my job. You’d get to keep the pension, please.” He wasn’t ashamed to beg. His work was everything. All he truly took pride in and that meant using any means available to prevent what this man was suggesting.
“So, don’t run away from whoever you pick for me, and say yes when you ask for future favors. You could have just said.” Watson rose and approached him. “Should I ask how Major Sholto got your help and what legal trickery you pulled to get me out from Trevor? Or is plausible deniability a crucial part of the game at this stage?”
“I would never care to speculate on the frequency of similar such circumstances. I am here because this specific case came to my attention and it is the one that I am concerned with. These policies are not my area-”
“Surely there are some ancient alphas available in that bumbling monstrosity you call a government. Ones who wouldn’t mind having a moderately interesting omega around to listen to their prattle.”
She looked pleased. “I hadn’t pinned John as a martymachliac. Nor had I realized he was so open to your interests. What a busy few months these must have been.”
When the Hawaiian Queen Liliuokalani was forced at gunpoint to sign a constitution she opposed, and which limited her power as monarch, it became known at the Bayonet Constitution. This is where I got the term 'bayonet transfer' from. In this world, I imagine the term would have come to be in olden times, when transfers occurred under duress. Go read up on Liliuokalani, by the way, she's a fascinating person.
James didn’t know nearly enough about the people making up the opposition, but of those he recognized, it wasn’t good. The alpha politicians especially worried him. They would likely be traditionalists, bonded to perfectly demure omegas and not at all open to the arguments he planned to make. The betas in the room were still swing votes, and he was relying on them, because as expected, there wouldn’t be a single omega present to offer so much as coffee, let alone insight. It grated him. He had hoped they could at least get some omega-rights activist politicians in the room, but no such luck under the pressed timeline. Why the Iceman was there was beyond James. He always categorized Mycroft Holmes as more of a bureaucratic spy than anything, and it seemed against his reputation to take interest in the matter of an RAMC captain’s fate.
John tossed up his hands in frustration, deciding it didn’t matter. This was probably an experiment anyway, he’d find out what was really going on eventually.
He hung his head and rested both hands on the tile below the shower-head as the water continued to scald his flesh. He focused on immediate concerns only: He didn’t want to go back out there. He knew the hot water would soon run out. He was exhausted and wanted sleep. An image of barricading himself in Sherlock’s room gleamed for moment before he dispelled it. He turned off the water and dried himself slowly. He was so tired. Nothing for it then. He moved precisely and managed to get to the landing and up the stairs without seeing anything but the floor. Good. He didn’t need the empty chair and severed ropes to join the unwelcome images already in his head. Mercifully, he barely remembered falling asleep.
John smiled. “It definitely refined my technique. Plus, the suppressants and birth control they give you are top notch. Calmed things down, thank god. Secondary school was a nightmare for that, was like a fog horn before I was medicated.”
“To whatever clothing shop you like. But you are paying. Pick out something you can bear to have me work in so we can stop having this argument.”
He leaned over in bed to kiss John, who gathered this was the preferred bargaining method. Which was fine. It was good Sebastian could be managed this way, and it helped keep the necking to a minimal. The real incentive for John’s learning to kiss correctly was keeping his partners’ mouths occupied. He preferred to preempt efforts to eat his scent off its source, as he was not a fan of the fallout above his collar line when partners were left to their own devices.
“See, this right here?” John pointed out and looking at Sherlock. “Maybe he was trying to hide something that they could use to ID him?”
The others nodded sagely at this declaration, or else held their tongues. James gawked at them. He knew there couldn’t really be universal support for Holmes’ speech—the legal clause sited must be extremely obscure—not from the likes of Parker, but no pushback came.
John may as well have been a blowup doll, or a piece of furniture. Not that he wasn’t very glad Victor hadn’t made a move to undress him. But it felt so dehumanizing, degrading, worse than basic training had ever been. He sighed. Damn. This was bad. Even if he could save his career, he was in for a lifetime of Victor. John steeled himself. None of that. Self-pity wasn’t going to do anything for him in this mess. If he was stuck with Victor, then he would truly need the army. Deployments would be his only refuge and, well, a lifetime with Victor might not be especially long if he stayed a soldier.
The smile Victor gave him was predatory. “Until you’ve accepted your new position. I hear you’ve had free reign till now, and tend to get a bit rough with alphas,” the idea seemed to stir Victor, who was emanating scents of lust and possessiveness while he moved closer to John, “but I like my face the way it is.”
Holmes replied with a sound John couldn’t categorize. They strode out of the government building together and were immediately collected by an unmarked black car. John wondered how Holmes was sure they’d got inside the right one but didn’t ask. What little Major Sholto had been able to tell him about the man suggested intrigue was part of the package.
“There was an interesting conversation held about you this morning, Captain, and its outcome will obviously have a very serious impact on your future. So, tell me, what is it you want, were you free to dictate your fate?”
“No. Thank you for offering though, Mr. Holmes. What I have in my rucksack is all that’s important. My sister will have to answer my calls one day, and I can pick up the rest of my clothes then.”
He tried her three more times, with no answer. Typical. Oh Harry, he sighed and cradled the phone to his chest, fighting back a well of emotion. A horrible part of him was glad she was hiding. He almost couldn’t bear the thought of seeing her face to face right now. He could do it once he’d gotten everything worked out. He shook his head sadly but shoved it down. He was on a time limit. Next up was Bill.
Irene Adler sat facing him in Sherlock’s armchair. Sherlock, inexplicably silent in the proceedings, stood facing the window. John was hardly thrilled that Sherlock had selected the woman to help explore his latent sexuality, but he couldn’t pretend to be shocked. That they had John tied to a chair in the middle of the flat was a more pressing concern.
John couldn’t tell if he was meant to be threatened or intrigued but was successfully irritated. John didn’t like the suggestion that his answer was negotiable.
He was very pleased to note that no scent of threat was coming off John. Maybe Mycroft was right, and the thing with the younger Holmes was just platonic. That soothed his instincts considerably. “Unless you are planning to stay with Mycroft,” he added to prompt a reply.
There was the question of the hour, of Harry’s whole life it sometimes seemed. “I don’t have all the details sir, only what the alpha told me when I woke up yesterday afternoon. But he said she,” he had to get through this “that she used me to pay off her debts, sir. I don’t have proof of that, only his word, but she does struggle with gambling, and other…issues.”
John’s last words in edgewise had been, “You wear suits two sizes too small and I’m the ‘indecorous’ one!?”
Moran huffed out a laugh at that. “Hardly, Holmes. I’m just wondering what sort of mess this is going to be when your little brother decides he wants his borrowed omega back. And I don’t fancy the wrath I’m like to face from you when I need to teach your brother the meaning of boundaries, since you clearly haven’t.” Sebastian was of a height with Mycroft, and physically capable of instilling such lessons.
John had to chase him down again, muttering, “Bloody hell, you can only see my collarbone, but fine.”
“Tell me,” John said, eyes still closed, voice even, “that she had something. A threat, a bomb on some MP’s car. Another phone full of secrets. Something she would do if you didn’t allow this to happen. Tell me there is a reason you allowed this to happen.”
They’d come to their stop inside the limits of the docks. The sounds of water and birds filled their silence. Sherlock stayed quiet and John recomposed himself. Finally, the latter jerked his head toward the metal shipping containers. “Look, it doesn’t matter. Aren’t we supposed to be looking for clues here?”
When he came down stairs that morning, he stopped before Sherlock, and held out his arms slightly to silently ask, ‘Alright?’
“Temporarily? Why would-” John broke off his words with a forced cough. He didn’t think it likely a better offer was coming. Hell, he’d have found a way to manage with Trevor if the prick had let him stay in the army. He could make anything work. “I’d be amenable to that, assuming it’s been signed off by the council Major Sholto appealed to. What would you want in exchange? I’d mention the pension, but you don’t look like the type interested in that.”
John gave him a careful look. “And what level of deference do you expect from your omegas when they are with you, exactly?”
Irene’s delight was unbridled. "But there is no need for you to be in the audience, handsome. A complete waste, honestly. No, I think we would both prefer you on center stage.”
He didn’t want her drinking herself blind with guilt when everything had turned out fine. He wouldn’t want that even if everything had gone to shit, but it’d be especially pointless now. Her voice box was full, so he just texted her the good news, and practically begged that she call him. God, he hoped she wasn’t in some terrible mess, or dangerous place, refusing to ask him for help. He paced, trying to think what to do, before calling Clara. It was a bit of a moving target, given how on-again off-again she was with his sister, but he didn’t have a great back up plan.
The solider offered his hand, and Mycroft took it, enjoying the warmth. “Thank you, for doing all this. I really am very grateful.”
John considered if there was anything else to do that evening but decided he could worry fruitlessly just as well in his bed as in the kitchen. He diligently put away the food and did the washing up before heading to his room, where he found his laptop, rucksack, and a special key card that must be for the front door, all neatly set on a desk, along with a charging cable for his new phone. Further, all his clothes, even the one’s he’d have sworn were at Harry’s, sat smartly in his dresser and wardrobe, along with several pieces he didn’t recognize and felt certain were outside of his price point. In fact, looking at the room again, he realized everything from Harry’s flat of his, from his bookshelves worth of novels, textbooks, and medical journals to a his favorite RAMC mug, was present and tidily rehomed. He amused himself, wondering how specific Mycroft’s instructions to his apparently warrant-defying assistants had been, or if they were just trained to anticipate their bosses exacting standards. Still, it couldn’t be said that the man wasn’t accommodating, and this evening was a far nicer welcome than the one he’d received from his last alpha.
“So, you getting turned on by other people scenting me, is that going to be a problem when I need you to do it next time I’m undercover?”
Mycroft had orchestrated the necessary details with his standard efficiency. Once all was in place, Captain Watson had been couriered to Mycroft’s primary office building by Anthea, and now met Mycroft’s gaze unflinchingly after their formal introduction. The captain had little knowledge of the council’s decision, or the point of this meeting, given that Mycroft hadn’t provided Sholto the time to make proper explanations.
An alpha named Parker piped in. “This is still a purely personal matter. Why are you agreeing to meddle in the private lives of your men, Major Sholto?”
John couldn’t say how long it lasted. It seemed ages before she’d brought herself over the edge, riding him. He didn’t think he’d ever been so unhappy to feel a woman convulse around his cock. Today was a veritable bounty of firsts.
“Well, I’m glad to know you have better taste than Mycroft Holmes,” Sebastian said with a sincere smile. “And I don’t want to sound like a salesman, but I pretty much guarantee independence. I’m gone for stretches at a time and you usually won’t know what country I’m in. But I’m thinking that won’t bother you.”
“Yes, the elderly have such progressive views on headstrong omegas. Don’t be an idiot. You wouldn’t want to subject John to such a fate. I thought you liked the man.”
The instant that he could move, John was on his feet and down the hall, without a single glance back. He locked the bathroom door and stripped, chucking everything he’d been wearing in the bin. In the shower, he scrubbed hard and kept the water hot.
Much to his displeasure, it was Irene who replied as she straddled John’s lap. “I’ve been given authority to speak on Sherlock’s behalf in this affair, darling. We had quite the long chat yesterday and agreed that this would be best. Sherlock wants me to touch you like this. He would like to watch me fuck you, as well, among other things.”
“It’s not a choice it’s my reality, Sherlock! I’ve seen what it looks like to be raped and trapped with the perpetrator. My only family nearly sold me into that. If Victor hadn’t gotten high the first night I was with him, who’s knows if I could have gotten out before he forced a bond. He wouldn’t have asked me first, wouldn’t have left me free to try to stop him. I’m not stupid. I know I can’t have everything I want, so I settled on what really matters to me, and yes, I’ve decided to be flexible with the rest. Not all of us can afford to be stubborn pricks all the time.” He jabbed his finger in Sherlock’s chest at the last comment.
He heard an exhale on the other line but could have sworn the next words were said with something like pride, “Watson, you incorrigible shit. How badly did you hurt him, getting free?”
“No! Please don’t do this! It’s the only thing I’m asking for. I’m an officer, I want my job. Please, please you can do anything else, bond me, breed me, whatever you want I don’t care, but please don’t make me retire!”
John chuckled darkly at that. “You’re a doctor’s worst nightmare. I’m fighting the impulse to sneak bits of kebab in you somehow. Or an IV line, which I think I could manage.”
“And you kept them at bay just fine on your own.” Sebastian inhaled. “I like it, smelling how many other people are desperate for you.”
“It would be a hell of a lot better than the alternative, sir.” John wasn’t stupid and wasn’t about to ask for more than was critical to his sanity. The laws were entrenched, and though he trusted Major Sholto more than almost anyone he knew, he was still an alpha. There would be limits to his sympathy. “She signed him on, and the registry’s got a copy. I know I’m stuck with him, sir. It’s fine, I can make do. What I really care about is not giving up a career that matters to me just to be his plaything.” That was probably more than had been wise to share, but it was true.
“Given Watson’s request, I felt the extenuating circumstances warranted the military’s intersession, at least as far as the enlistment goes. The captain was unaware of his sister’s intentions to give him up, was secretly drugged during the transfer of ownership, and was physically shackled by his new Alpha upon his return to consciousness.” Several betas in the room looked horrified. “That context was considered valid to the officers listed on the third page of your dossier, who agreed to join me in filing the petition. You’ll notice Lieutenant General Frogmorton’s name is on that list.”
James bit back a similar question of why John had not been permitted to present his own case. “All attempts to contact Ms. Watson have failed and Mr. Trevor is currently in rehabilitation, following the discovery of a substantial drug collection at his personal residence this week.”
“They could die promptly, and John would be free. That would be a very pleasant fate. He wouldn’t even need to be bonded, emancipation doesn’t require it.”
He dove into the military connection with gusto, recounting his own tales, asking the omega about his service, and warmly inquiring about the soldier’s ambitions. It was amazing how quickly it relaxed him, to play on shared home turf. They worked their way through the lunch with ease.
“Yes, sir. I don’t know what they used, but when I woke up, I was already in the alpha’s flat, and he told me they’d drugged me.”
“No, it’s…fine.” Sherlock had been trying not to look pleased, and let it slip for a moment. But the expression was gone in an instant as the crime tech and DI approached the pair of them.
“Hello, my name is John Watson. Do you mind if I take a look at that cut?” John didn’t wait for a response before removing his coat and rolling up his sleeves. He’d decided to opt for efficiency in his bedside manner with this one.
Sherlock paused. “She would have stopped if I spoke to you.” John did open his eyes at that. Searching Sherlock’s face for any sense whatsoever. He looked impeccable once again, and only the faintest flush would suggest anything untoward had just occurred.
However, Molly’s heart dropped. Who was this omega Sherlock was being so nice to? Was Sherlock courting him? Did Sherlock prefer male omegas? Or just assertive ones? Either way she felt doomed.
The omega grabbed their cocks together in one hand and oh god that felt good. Sebastian looked into John’s face, but his expressive eyes were closed again. Still, he enjoyed watching the pleasure play out there. John continued stroking them together, working his hips into the motion and, following his lead, Sebastian spit into his own palm and added his hand to the fray. Jesus, that was good. The precum and saliva were enough and soon Sebastian was working himself against their hands without restraint.
“But I’ve known, and despised, Victor since university.” Now it was Sherlock who couldn’t meet John’s eye. “We used to get high together.”
John had to duck out of the case a bit early, as Mycroft had summoned him. This prompted some very entertaining remarks from Sherlock, but the case was basically over and John waved them off.
Their current case had led them to the morgue at St. Bart’s, where John was pleasantly surprised to reconnect with his old classmate, Mike Stamford, and meet Molly Hopper, the source of the foot. Her perfectly demure nature did make John feel a little inadequate; she was just such a model omega. Still, she was charmingly awkward, clearly of the kidney sacrificing variety where it came to Sherlock, and smelled light and sweet (like lemon drizzle, if you could compare a person’s scent to such a thing) which John thought appealing. He liked her almost at once, though he would have been hard pressed not to feel a kinship with any other unbonded omega in their shared field.
“‘Short and painful’ is how I like to describe you. Not a bad idea for a chest tattoo, either, if you’re shopping.”
“No, Mr. Parker, you are quite right. My area is the military. And we do not intend to let a good and needed soldier be dragged away when he wants to stay.”
“Well if it is a concern, drugs could be useful. A vasodilator and an inhibition lowering agent would guarantee the best results.”
Parker poked at a line in the dossier. “When Captain Watson awoke, he fled from his new alpha did he not? So, the restraints were a sound precaution. All in all, it sounds like these alphas knew Watson was prone to hysterical behavior and were acting as any sensible caregivers would by drugging him. They were clearly taking the necessary measures to ensure his safe transfer. It’s unseemly for an omega to be unbonded at his age, in any case. Lucky he was not unwillingly bonded before his sister found him a suitable mate.”
“This is for you. It will make our communication much easier, as I work late and travel frequently. Do feel free to use it personally, it is yours to keep. Also, as we will be operating in casual proximity, I would ask that you call me Mycroft.”
“Not at all. I have spoken with my military colleagues and a fair sum could be proffered to make Trevor whole. I also think Watson would be more than happy to pledge some portion of his future pension toward the partial repayment of such a sum, if the expense is off-putting to you. In any case, Victor Trevor is not interested in money, or in need. Regardless we are happy to arrange fair compensation.”
“Didn’t need to, sir. He got high on something last night, left him completely out of it. It was tempting though.”
They pulled on appropriate sanitary garb and Lestrade ushered them up several flights of stairs and into a common area bordered by five minuscule bedrooms. Inside each, a standard bed, desk, wardrobe, and sink were all so tightly packed it reminded John of Tetris.
They’d ended up giggling like school boys while they waited for the police, John affectionately called him an idiot, and Sherlock felt a strong buzz. As John inspected the stiches, Sherlock decided that the man’s presence was helpful. He was handy in a pinch and it was easier to push oneself if there was someone to impress. Someone who could appreciate his skill. It truthfully hadn’t taken longer than leaving Mycroft’s home for Sherlock to admit he was disposed toward the omega, puzzle pieces aside. By the time night was falling, and they were walking through the city, talking easily, Sherlock knew he liked the man.
“Allow is a strong word. He legally can do whatever he wants. But I agreed not to run if my conditions are met. Which makes anyone he picks a step up, from- well, what I was facing.” He didn’t really want to share the details “Let’s just say it wasn’t ideal with my last alpha, your brother helped by stepping in, taking my papers, so now he gets to pick the next one.”
“What? Oh, no it’s-” John coughed. “I just, in the past I’ve mostly dated betas. Always tried to avoid getting courted by alphas. Wouldn’t bond at all if I could help it.”
“Flaunting what Sherlock?” John folded the newspaper civilly and gave the other his full, defiant, attention.
They continued their walk and were near their goal before Sherlock spoke again, “You wouldn’t have been trapped with Victor. I would have freed you.”
John thought that was one of the nicer compliments he’d received. The Major fell into a contemplative silence, and John opted not to interrupt. Finally, Sholto said, “Tell me this, if he allowed you to stay enlisted, could you stand to be his omega?”
“Brother mine, this is a pleasant if unexpected visit. Please stop harassing my omega and do come join me.” John hadn’t noticed Mycroft step up behind him.
Victor worked himself into a frenzy with the aid of John’s body and after what felt like a long time, gasped, spilling out onto John’s clothes. Victor slumped against him, dead weight.
John did so, and said, “I noticed the clothes and things from Harry’s, though I suspect she hasn’t contacted you.”
John jerked his body to toss the man away only to find that between the drugs and the orgasm, Victor had been thrown from the confines of consciousness. John felt a good way to test the depth of his slumber was venting his own frustration in a fit of shouted obscenities. It felt good and left him breathing hard. Victor hadn’t stirred. John took a deep breath. He was still so angry, but that wasn’t important right now. He needed to think of a way out of here.
The "Airstrip One has Wi-Fi” bit is just a reference to 1984, where Airstrip One was the name for the British isles, and Big Brother jabs just work too easily for Mycroft.
“I believe you are wrong, Mr. Gordan.” James failed to keep the sharp rebuke from his voice. “I can say with confidence that Captain Watson’s forced retirement would be the army’s loss. He has been an indisputable asset to his unit, as these letters and testimonials have shown.” He pushed the stack of paper forward. “These were included with your dossier, but please feel free to peruse them again at your convenience, if you doubt my word.”
“Erm, sometimes,” John said, opening the glass doors to the kitchen. “I thought vampires didn’t need to eat food?”
When the broke apart, Sherlock roughly grasped John’s chin. “You don’t know what you’re offering.” His voice was dangerously low.
Stranger: Greg thought about waving the touch off and possibly tazing whoever it was before recognizing the touch and pushing the pillow away, looking exhausted up at Mycroft, bandage wrapped aeound his forehead, hair mussed, expression distinctly disgruntled, "I should have stayed in bed this morning." He said flatly, twining his fingers with Mycroft's and laying back on the bed again, closing his eyes.
"Well, I wasn't really planning to attend. It's such a boring concept, don't you think? Still, I found tonight surprisingly enjoyable.” He smirks, intently watching John squirm a bit under such scrutiny.
Sherlock smirked up at him and lifted the cut material off of John’s hard cock. John was hard. Achingly hard.
Around the room, at least a dozen people are typing their initial bids into the tablets provided by the auction organizers. He glances down at the tablet sitting next to him on the table.
“Yes,” Mycroft said, not rising to the teasing jab as he smoothed down his tuxedo coat. “Thank you for standing watch over us. Both of you,” he said, turning to John and inclining his head.
The woman’s eyes widened and she stood up hastily. “Of course, Mr. Holmes. Please have a seat. I will let the Registrar know that you are here. Can I get you or your companion refreshments?”
Mycroft nuzzled his neck. “You’ve just agreed to mate with a vampire. It’s a bit late to appeal to heaven.”
For his part, Greg felt….stronger. He realized that he could feel Mycroft’s love and support flowing through the bond and he felt like he could tackle just about anything. He put his hand in Mycroft’s and squeezed it. “Thank you, from both of us. Shall we?” he asked his mate.
Sherlock chuckled, the sound deep and reverberating in his chest beneath John’s hand. “I suppose it is our MO….sir.”
You: "Yes, I had someone deliver from that Italian place you like. Let's get you settled on the couch, and I'll bring it in." He led the way to the living room.
mortals. He’s a help at crime scenes, if a bit of an arse. I mean, think about it. He doesn’t have to be. Most of them don’t care what we humans do to each other as long as we’re around to offer ourselves up as contracts.” Greg winced at the last word.
Stranger: "Okay, dear. I won't tease anymore," Sherlock smiled, taking his fingers out and positioning himself at John's entrance. "You did," he answered. "I'm coming in."
Stranger: Sherlock gently circled the sensitive skin of John's entrance before actually sliding his first finger in and out, carefully stretching John.
“John. It occurs to me that I should know whether sex is alarming. It would seem prudent that I learn about it and thus deepen my observations on human behavior.”
With a grim smile, John brought his hand down. He missed the middle spot, having never spanked anyone before, and then adjusted so that he could smack the tempting ass right in the middle.
Mycroft sighed and re-crossed his legs. “Brother, I know I once told you that caring is not an advantage. I suppose, over time, that one can change his attitudes…”
The brothers briefly make eyes contact over their prize, and, as if practiced, they go to work on removing Doctor John Watson of his clothes. Sherlock is surprisingly gentle as he pushes John forward and helps him off with his shirt, and jacket. At the same time, Mycroft kneels in front of him and takes off John’s shoes, socks, and then gently eases up his hips so that he can slide the trousers down and off.
“So, do you, uh, approve of your brother’s choice in husband?” John asked after a couple of minutes, turning towards Sherlock.
John snorted. “No it’s alright. I’ve got to come to grips with it sometime, right? Bollocks, I was so close. A year. Just one more bloody year and the Statute of Limitations would have run out and I’d be free.” John took a long swig of beer.
“Yes, for both of us. But love, we have so much time to do so.” He pressed his forehead to Greg’s, breathing him in. “Thank you.”
When they pull apart, breathing faster, Mycroft sits next to John and cups his chin, holding him still as he whispers, “My turn,” before leaning in to claim his lips.
John calmed his breathing and shook his head as if from a fog. “Greg? Why? We’re supposed to go out for drinks tonight, actually.”
Slowly, Mycroft moved his mouth up Greg’s stomach and torso, pausing every inch to bite into the soft tempting skin, tasting what was uniquely Gregory Lestrade. By the time he reached Greg’s collar bone, the human beneath him was writhing, fingers clutching his normally tidy hair.
Something made John look up into Sherlock’s eyes, and when he did he felt caught, like prey in a bright light. Uncomfortable as he was, he couldn’t look away as the vampire brought his wrist up to his mouth. Sherlock licked at the skin, smiling when John shivered. Still holding John in his gaze, the vampire bared his teeth and bit down.
Mycroft removed his fang quickly and then drank. He groaned at the taste of blood from such an intimate place.
John snorted softly and shook his head. He stepped closer. “My normal life was dull, pointless. With you I’ve found….more.” He gave a small, almost apologetic shrug.
“I know. I have also taken the liberty of ordering several new pairs of shoes for you. They will be delivered this afternoon.”
Stranger: Greg nodded minutely, blinking open his eyes to look up at Mycroft, "I'll be more careful, I swear. I'll even wear that unwieldy vest if it makes you happy." He mentally cursed himself, that was going to land him in trouble, Mycroft didn't know that he didn't usually wear his vest.
Stranger: "The mystery of John Watson's attraction," he answered, taking the blonde's face in his hands and smiling down at his flatmate. "It seems I was a suspect and I've managed to become the criminal."
Almost immediately, Sherlock was typing away on his cell phone. John glanced at the driver and decided to simply sit quietly on the plush leather seat as they were driven to….somewhere.
“Yeah. Well, I know that this is important to you. And hey, I benefit from it,” he said with a smile.
Greg frowned when Mycroft looked away. Clearly something bothered him. He wanted to reach over and smooth away that frown, but resisted and let the vampire speak.
The vampire’s cock jumped at his acquiescent words. Mycroft licked up a stripe of skin on his inner left thigh that was exposed between the lines of red silk. Without warning, he bit down, slicing easily into the soft skin. Greg hissed and buried his fingers into the soft bedding beneath him. Mycroft let his strength, his own vitality unfurl, letting himself drink deeply. Greg’s blood practically
Stranger: Sally deleted the last few messages and put the phone down next to Greg, who now had his hands pressed over his eyes, trying to block out the light in the room, having already given up on the sound. "Mycroft's on his way." She said as quietly as possible, still earning a disgruntled noise and a frown. "Thanks." He said sardonically, waiting until Sally had left the room to curl in on himself and shove the pillow over his head.
Sherlock watched him for a moment. He was…perplexed by John H. Watson. The man broke many of the rules he had formed over the years when dealing with humans. Sherlock Holmes had been the subject of many, both men and women, who were infatuated and threw themselves at him. Hell, even other vampires resorted to such measures, drawn by either his good looks or his family's power. They were imbeciles who readily agreed with everything Sherlock said or did.
Mycroft snorted. “And carries substantially longer consequences and responsibilities. Do I need to be blunt? Why did you choose that claim?”
Mycroft chuckled lightly and ran his thumb over the back of Greg’s hand. “Well, yes, but this will be a bit more…structured.”
Stranger: "I've got a hostage then, hm?" Sherlock murmured, leaning down to lave his tongue over one of the hardened nipples while his fingers pinched and teased the other. "I'll keep you until that gorgeous detective of yours comes to save you," he winked.
The vampire grinned maliciously and leaned down to John’s neck. He licked once at the skin, causing the John to twist away and shudder. John struggled against him and the vampire tsked softly. He narrowed his eyes and John suddenly felt…oddly tired. No, tired wasn’t the right word. It was as if he suddenly couldn’t collect the energy to resist anymore. He went limp, held up and against the wall by the vampire’s body pressing against him.
sat down, hoping that John was too tired to notice his wince as the plug shifted against his prostate.
“I want to – Sherlock let me show you –“ He leans forward and, meeting Sherlock’s eyes, runs his hand down his cheek, running his thumb over his bottom lip. He swallows nervously and leans more, touching his lips barely to the other man’s.
John glanced around quickly, saw that they were alone, and leaned up to kiss Sherlock, pouring his arousal into it. Sherlock inhaled sharply but pulled back. “Not yet,” he growled. “But soon.”
John takes a deep breath, reaching the edge of his patience with the seemingly endless roundabout conversation. “Sherlock! What the bloody hell are you talking about?!”
Sherlock pulls away and glares at him. “And you’re interrupting.” But he still climbs off and gestures politely with his hand, as if allowing Mycroft to go ahead of him.
You: John's nipples hardened into small pebbles. "Then I surrender here and now," he said, running his hands over the skin he could get to
John’s eyes darkened. His newfound alpha impulses kicked into gear in the presence of an omega. An omega ready to be bred. He stood up and nearly prowled towards his husband.
“We gather the other witnesses. I will pry Anna from her conversation partners.” He gestured to where Anna was speaking with several other guests across the room. Before John could respond, Sherlock had left him and smoothly inserted himself in the group’s conversation.
John resolutely refused to answer questions related to personal things between him and Sherlock. But the questions always seemed to lead, if obscurely, to the same place. It all felt like a game where he failed to understand the goal.
“Of course,” John said tightly, recognizing the dismissal when he saw it. He got out and walked inside, somewhat perplexed.
The car dropped them off in front of 221B and John followed the still-silent vampire inside. Once in the sitting room, the vampire began to strip off his clothes without a trace of self-consciousness.
“It is a part of the progression of healing. The protein strains in my blood are alien to your system, but they are helping nonetheless…It will subside soon.”
Later, the four of them were seated in the comfortable living room on plush sofas by the fire. Lestrade and John are drinking beer, and the Holmes brothers are nursing small glasses of very fine scotch.
“Well…I don’t know. Sounds like Mycroft thinks so. Sounds like Sherlock likes you. I don’t think he’ll force you to do anything you don’t want, though. He’s
Gregory Lestrade smacked another pint down the table. A bit of the beer sloshed over onto the table, but frankly at this point, John couldn’t care.
Stranger: "The tea can wait!" Sherlock grinned, triumphantly. He turned the stove off and pulled John into his bedroom, where he shed all of his flatmate's clothes and tossed them to the floor before staring at John's naked form with a smile on his face. "Better right?"
John growled and sped up. He could feel something odd and pleasurable happening in his cock. He pulled out all the way and looked down. The knot was there. It had formed as blood pooled there, preparing to fulfill his natural drive to breed a willing omega.
John shifted nervously and finally remembered he was holding a cup of tea. He took a sip. “Right,” he said softly. “I suppose that’s a good point.” Not able to bear the heavy silence that lay between them, John made a beeline for the living room where he could pretend to watch a morning news program on the telly.
Sherlock manages to not glare at Mycroft.  “You know I would not participate in this ridiculous event.”
Stranger: "Whatever you want," Sherlock smiled, beginning to pound into his lover with his hands underneath John's knees, spreading them up higher.
Stranger: "More?" Sherlock smiled and added another finger, both beginning to scissor themselves and move deeper into John, tickling his prostate.
“After having lived with me,” Sherlock completed the sentence. He gave John a feral smile that showed his fangs.
You: John moaned at the feeling of his teeth biting into the skin. He knew that he'd have marks tomorrow, but somehow that only made it hotter. Marked by Sherlock Holmes. His ass clenched around Sherlock cock at the thought
John paused and smiled as he imagined the energetic vampire who always dashed about like an enthusiastic child, staying willingly in the room, listening to his vital signs. “Well, thank you for looking out for me,” John said.
You: Sherlock's whole body jumped when Greg touched him through his slacks. He eagerly pushed himself into the kiss.
“Yes.” Sherlock pulled John to him and cupped his face. “I asked you to trust me. It will…it won’t be painful for long. I wouldn’t do this if it didn’t make you
Sherlock’s words from yesterday morning crossed John’s mind as the black limousine with black tinted windows rolled up next to him. His mobile buzzed.
Greg nodded and together they knelt up. Mycroft cradled Greg’s chin and tilted his head to the side. He buried his nose in the pulse point he could feel just under his husband’s skin. He breathed in deeply, and let Greg’s scent, his life-force, tender and strong, yet so vulnerable, calling out to him. He let out a low whimper. “Mine,” he whispered and licked at the pulse point. His eyes closed as he let Greg wash over his senses.
“Cosa ci fai qui, Alessandro?” Mycroft asked. Lestrade lowered his gun at a gesture from the elder Holmes brother.
The DI walked over to them. He didn’t seem surprised by the wound on Sherlock’s side. “Well, there is paperwork, which I know you hate, but –“ He held his hands up defensively.
Not looking away, Sherlock put his violin down. “The contract is over, John. You don’t need to stay here…. with me,” he said, mind working on how to respond to this development.
“And you’re an omega,” John answered, his voice lowering. He stepped forwards until he could feel the heat coming off of Sherlock’s body. The man was wearing only a towel wrapped around his waist, and John had the sudden need to run his hands over the smooth planes of pale skin. Without looking for permission, John ran his hands over Sherlock’s arms and chest.
He glanced up again and found himself under the intense scrutiny of bright grey eyes. John swallowed as Sherlock watched at him, unblinking. Not for the first time, he wondered if the vampire could read his mind. He sincerely hoped not.
Finally the vampire grinned, showing John his sharp fangs. “Yes,” was all he said in reply before sitting up and again spreading John’s legs wide. He didn’t wait now to hold back as he started to fuck John hard, claiming him with each powerful thrust.
His hand reflexively goes to the nightstand drawer where he keeps a small pistol. He relaxes when he recognizes Sherlock’s tall lanky frame standing in the doorway and framed by light from the hall. John squints to see his face.
The Holmes brothers watched him walk down the hallway with a mug of hot tea made the way John liked it.
Sherlock sat in a chair across from John and looked at him intently. “Yes, we have distant family in Italy. Alessandro is our cousin, if somewhat removed. They are – rather powerful.”
“Yess, that’s right. Touch me,” John murmurs, eyes slipping closed. As Sherlock’s hand slips down to his collarbone, John opens his eyes and locks them onto the steel blue ones staring intently up at him. The hand runs down his chest and then those long fingers are joining John’s hand, wrapping around their erections. John groans and lets go, bracing himself above Sherlock, keeping enough space between their bodies.
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and he looked closely at John’s face, the way his pupils were dilated, his fast breathing. He leaned down and licked at one long red stripe across his belly and looked up the beautiful expanse of John’s skin to meet his eyes. “But do you want me to stop?”
You: [Mycroft slipped into the sleek black sedan, read the text and smiled.] Tell him that I will be utterly silent. Thank you for taking care of him. -MH
You: "May-maybe." John licked his dry lips and pushed his hips forwards. "You're too tempting. I think you do it on purpose."
“Mycroft sends one of his minions over, letting me feed, if needed. Really, we can go much longer than humans believe without food.”
After a few minutes, Mycroft pulled out. His face flushed now as his body warmed with Greg’s fresh, vital blood. He knelt again between Greg’s legs and licked once up the length of his bound cock. Greg shuddered.
“Mmm, are you sure? That means I can’t do more of this,” Greg said, teasing as he ran finger tips down Mycroft’s spine.
Sherlock sat back and chuckled low in his throat. The driver eyed him in the rear-view mirror as John looked pointedly out the window, hands clenched in his lap.
You: John inhaled sharply at the feel of strong arms wrapping around him. "Um, I guess it is kind of warm in here..."
Sherlock leans against the door, crosses his arms, and looks down at John. He gives him a slow, lascivious smile. "I do hope my brother has been a good host," he says as he closes bedroom door.
Greg shrugged. “I wanted to know what was possible. But I – well, I didn’t want to scare you off by bringing it up.” Greg flushed an buried his face in the crook of Mycroft’s shoulder.
Sherlock hissed as John moved lazily against him. He placed a hand on John’s hip and stopped his movements. “You’re tired.”
Sherlock managed to hold himself still, despite the primal urge to move. He growled softly. “Yesss,  but you like it when it hurts,” he purred. As if in demonstration, he let one claw grow and used it to slice a thin line on John’s leg. John whimpered.
You: "Oh I don't know. Sometimes he doesn't even realize I'm gone. He could be hours." John grinned and carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair
Stranger: Sherlock watched the doctor curiously and snapped his hips forward, a harder thrust in experiment.
“We’ll never hide this,” John said, thumbing the obvious bonding bite on the right side of Sherlock’s long neck. There was no possible way that anyone would see that and confuse it for anything else. It screamed Stay away. He’s mine.
“Ah. Excellent,” Sherlock said. With that, he began to move, pulling his hips back and pushing back in until he had setup a steady rhythm.
Greg howled. The water hit him right at his most sensitive spot, making his anus twitch and clench, and Mycroft held it there without mercy.
He would never, afterwards, be able to say why he did it. Or maybe he would say that he was following his instincts. John stood up quietly and slipped off his jumper, and then his button down shirt, leaving him in just his t shirt. Sherlock looked up at him as he approached. The vampire leaned back and quirked one eyebrow.
The next couple of days were a blur. Sherlock had a new case, and was, as usual, completely focused on it. It wasn’t until the third day of the case that John realized that the vampire hadn’t fed on him since the first time he’d fed from his neck. John waited until they were in a black sedan, headed back to 221B after Sherlock had solved the case.
“Always the politician, Mycroft. I had forgotten how slippery you are.” He looked closely at Lestrade, sniffing the air. “Not only is he wearing your claim, but he smells like you. "He took another step forward but was stopped when Mycroft bodily stepped between them. “Ah. You take better care of your pet than does your little brother.” He threw Sherlock a smirk. Sherlock snarled, lips pulled back to show his teeth in an animalistic motion.
You: "Your problem?" Sherlock asked. And then his eyes trailed down to the obvious bulged in Greg's slacks. "You're aroused." He boldly reached out and cupped him and whispered, "I believe that I am aroused, too."
Sherlock sighed softly. “John, don’t you trust me? Or at least, don’t you trust Greg? He survived, obviously.”
Sherlock pulled John harder into his embrace and pounded into his body hard as he continued to drink John’s sweet blood. He came deep inside of John’s body with a low primal growl, eyes glinting.
Stranger: "Oh, uh sorry about that..." Greg muttered pulling away from Sherlock, and looking at his feet. "Just wanted to be closer..."
Sherlock leaned his forehead against John’s shoulder, breathing hard. “If you have any questions, now is the time to ask while you can still back out.”
You: John groaned softly and arched his neck. "That you're this gorgeous is criminal....Should I be scared?"
“Soon,” Sherlock growled. He leaned down and sniffed along John’s neck. “Mine.” He teased his fangs along John’s neck, resulting in a thin red line of blood. “Say it,” he commanded.
John smiles nervously. It feels like a trap is closing in but he can’t really see its edges. “Well,” he says, taking a sip, “I’m sure I can find a guest room or three to use.”
John opened his mouth to ask more on the subject, and then thought better of it. After a minute though, he said, “So…Greg mentioned that the mark you put on me, the….”
“I do not wish to….that is,” Sherlock paused and swallowed. “I know that we have been somewhat intimate before now. I know that such –
Stranger: Sherlock looked over, pupils blown a bit more. His hair was rumpled from lying on the couch and his lips were swollen and red. "No Cluedo."
Sherlock unfolded himself from where he was sitting and stalked towards John. He gently grasped John’s chin in his hand and kissed him. The kiss was soft and hungry and promised what would happen soon. “I should shower,” Sherlock murmured, pulling away.
Mycroft’s eyes flicked to his mobile on the dresser. It had been over an hour and Sherlock hadn’t responded to his text. He frowned. His mind leaped through any number of possible outcomes to the plan forming in his mind.
The vampire watched John with a slightly amused expression as he deftly removed his own clothes. He was eager to feel the heat of John’s skin. Once naked, he smoothly climbed onto the bed and pinned John down on his back. John let out a small indignant squeak, but Sherlock merely gave him a predatory grin, letting his fangs be seen.
After a moment in which John does some mental math to check that he is, in fact awake and not having a very odd wet dream, he looks up again and says, “So, um, what exactly is Mycroft correct about?”
When John emerged a while later, skin hot and steaming, Sherlock was lounging on the bed. He had taken his jacket off and his feet were bare. He was wearing a purple shirt and he had undone several of the top buttons, teasing with bare skin for anyone who cared to look. John was suddenly hit by arousal. Now that they were there, alone, his body was starting to respond and he could feel himself begin to harden.
After the vampire ran out of complaints with a huff, John touched his forearm. “You need to feed. It's been too long since the last time you had nourishment,” he said, using his stern-doctor voice.
“Putting my considerable skills to better use,” John said with a smirk as he assessed the wound. As he watched, the skin appeared to be renewing itself slowly. “Amazing,” he breathed.
“I remember when my father, your grandfather, walked me down the aisle. I barely knew your father, of course, the times being different then, but he looked so handsome standing there waiting for me. If only he could be here today…”
John didn’t bother to ask how the vampire knew his shoe size. Or why he was treating John like a large dressup doll. Or why he’d waste his time on what exactly John wore. John sipped his tea and stayed silent.
Greg nodded, eyes focused on some point across the room. “You could say that. What brought that up?”
You: Mycroft frowned. "I will have a word with Sherlock. He and John are getting...out of hand." He absently ran a hand down Greg's chest. "Is the light bothering you?"
“Please! John I need you in me so much! Please!” Sherlock pushed his hips up, trying to show his husband how much he needed more. He spread his legs wantonly.
“There are some very long winded poems on the subject. I’ll find them for you. In fact, there’s a book I’d like to give you to read that goes into the rituals in detail.”
John smiled, noting how easily the DI spoke of Mycroft. “You almost make him sound like he’s human.” He nudged Greg in the ribs playfully.
John silently poured himself a cup of tea and added the sugar and milk. He cleared his throat softly. “So. Anything planned for today?” he asked the silent kitchen, voice a bit tighter than normal.
Sherlock looked up at him. “It would appear that we will need acclimate to new roles.” He slowly spread
“Yes!” Sherlock shouted, though whether it was in response to John’s words or his finger, neither knew.
“No. I took the liberty of making an appointment for us at 1pm.” Sherlock stood up abruptly. “Ah! The eyes are done!” Sherlock said after a glance at the wall clock.
Sherlock’s hand shot out and grasped the back of John’s neck. John gasped as he was caught in the vampire’s sharp grip. His eyes dilated for a moment and then darkened.
Stranger: Thanks, his head's killing him and he's getting frustrated. Oh, he says that if you even think about being loud he's going to shoot you in the foot. I wouldn't worry, he's just annoyed. SD
John nodded. “It was….in some ways not as awkward as I thought it would be.”  He paused. “Mycroft made it better for Greg. He cares about him. Protects him.” He smiled. “I’m happy for them both.”
Stranger: "Rather unobservant, don't you think?" Sherlock chuckled, leaning up to press his lips to John's and gently nipped at his bottom one.
The vampire laughed. “Good. I’ve known it, but I enjoy hearing it, too.” He kissed his mate tenderly and pulled away. “I’m afraid we should return to our guests soon.”
“I do not believe that is true. You are far more than your experiences in Afghanistan,” Sherlock carefully covered John with a blanket. He ran a hand over the knot of scar tissue on John’s shoulder. “I could take that scar away, you know. I could cut you there,” Sherlock said, pressing his finger gently against the knot of scarred flesh, “and then lick you closed again.”
Sherlock started to pull away but John wrapped his arms around him and pulled his mouth down to meet his own. He pushed his tongue into the vampire’s mouth, aggressively throwing himself at Sherlock.
Stunned and a bit overwhelmed, John jumped up and headed to the kitchen, pausing to lean on the door frame. “I’m going to make myself a cuppa. Erm, can I heat you up some blood? Do you need anything?”
“Ah. Well then. This claiming act will ensure that others of our kind will know immediately that you are under the protection of another vampire, and more generally of the Holmes family.” He leaned forward and said in a falsely low stage whisper, “Not a bad setup, young man.”
You: "Ah. So what do you plan to do today then?" John turned a page, having not read a single thing on the previous one.
Greg shook their hands. “Please to meet all of you.” He felt the vampires scrutinizing him down to his heart rate and breathing pattern. At least with Mycroft’s tailor he was dressed well for the occasion.
You: Sherlock blinked. He wasn't quite used to this. He hadn't flirted with someone in ages. "And apparently I've made you laugh." He relaxed his fingers, letting Greg do whatever it was that he wanted to do with their hands.
When his thirst had been quenched for the moment, he pulled back and lapped at the wound to heal it. He looked up Greg’s magnificent body to where the human was panting softly, eyes bright. “Tell me if it becomes too much.”
Sherlock pushed John’s legs closed, picked him up and placed him on the couch. He zipped up John’s slacks and reached across him to press the button that would summon the Registrar.
“Yeah well, helping at a wedding usually involves being an usher,” Greg said. “Or directing the caterer. Not watching the couple….bond.” He flushed red and glanced across the room to where Mycroft was conversing in Italian with a few other vampires.
You: John leaned down and mouthed his cock through the thin fabric for one quick moment before standing and walking down the hall to the bathroom. He paused in the bathroom doorway and stripped out of his clothes completely and turned on the hot water.
The Registrar turned the book around. “Before we proceed, please review this page and confirm that everything is set to your satisfaction.”
“And end this delightful activity so soon?” Mycroft said before biting into the skin on Greg’s inner thigh. “Turn around, love.”
Sherlock yelped at the first smack but stayed quiet through the next five smacks. John paused briefly, eyes flicking across the room. Greg nodded ever so slightly in encouragement, and he began in earnest, raining smacks down on his lover’s arse. He stopped at 12, imagining that was enough for a first time. He rested his hand on Sherlock’s arse, and was amazed at how he could feel the heat radiating from it through his shorts. What must his skin look like? John swallowed his arousal and focused instead on soothing his lover.
Caught up in the feeling of being fucked hard, John lets the two men take what they want from him. He holds tightly onto the back of the loveseat and keeps his legs spread as wide as his mouth.
Sherlock nodded and released John from his grip enough to walk them to the sleek black limo that was waiting.
“You invite me here and then waive John in my face. And now you’re bidding on him. How predictable,” he spits.
Greg lifted his head. “Good,” he murmured, and when he kissed him, this time it was slow and tender.
“Yes, when he asked ‘how would you know?’” Sherlock blinks slowly. “Sorry. Shouldn’t have said anything,” John says after a moment of silence. He goes back to his magazine.
They kissed, becoming more fervent and heated. Mycroft spread his legs, cradling Greg between them. “Before we get too far,” Mycroft said, pulling away, “Promise me two things: one, that tomorrow we’ll talk about the bonding. I want to ensure that you know everything before we proceed and make it official.”
as I take from you, so that we forge a bond that ties us, soul to soul, unbroken, undying, and sealed.”
They stopped smoothly in front of the long, rounded building that housed the Offices of Vampiric Internal Affairs. It was pure white and sat, dignified, across the Thames from Parliament, like an unsubtle reminder that the vampires watched the workings of human government.
Greg snorted. “A long month more like it. It took a long time to set this up. So glad that bastard is off the streets.”
“I couldn’t very well interfere with the charity gala and bid on you without Sherlock’s knowledge. He is my brother.”
You: John howled as Sherlock pushed inside of him. It was still tight but that only made him harder. "Yesss, make me," he moaned.
John gasped but held still as now two long fingers pushed deep inside of him, opening him up. Sherlock’s grip on his leg was hard, and he knew he would have bruises. John rolled his hips, urging the vampire on.
And suddenly he wasn’t. Sherlock flipped them over, rolling them until John was looking up into Sherlock’s pale eyes, framed by his dark curls. Sherlock smirked down at him and roughly pushed their cocks together. They both groaned at the contact. Sherlock pushed his hips down rhythmically. He grasped John’s chin and held his head still as he kissed him roughly.
Sherlock continued to feed from John, holding him tightly beneath him. When he felt satiated, he pulled back and lapped at the bite marks. His cock slipped out and he finally released John’s leg. He lay languidly next to John and casually wiped a drop of blood from his lower lip. John panted softly, looking a bit wrecked. “Your terms, John, are acceptable.” He grinned and John returned the smile.
“In a way. That both Sherlock and I have, apparently, become involved with humans makes us noteworthy, though not really rare. Our relations in Italy is from a very old and powerful lineage. At one point, our two families nearly ruled most of Europe.”
Then it hit John like a speeding train. Omega. He smelled an omega. And Sherlock, being the only other person around, had to be it.
Sherlock snorted. “No. He has never been one for diplomacy. He wanted to see whether the rumors are true that Mycroft has chosen a mate.”
John smiled at the protective note in the vampire’s voice. “Thank you,” he said softly. He leaned up and place a soft kiss on Sherlock’s lips. He sighed. “We should go or we’ll be late.”
You: "Greg, you have an above average brain that you put to use in solving heinous crimes. Not to mention that you periodically bring me interesting cases. You are already in my good graces." Sherlock smiled just a bit, still graspong his wrist
John opened his mouth to protest that he didn’t wear ties, but he closed it with a snap at a glare from his new master. A maid carried a tray in and placed it on a coffee table in front of Sherlock. He didn’t acknowledge her as he reached for a goblet of blood. He tasted some and smiled, eyes on the mobile screen. John looked away. He knew that vampires could drink like this, but he had heard that it was less than palatable. Like drinking tepid tea.
“So, um, how….?” John gestures in the direction that Annabelle disappeared, twisting his wrist, palm up.
Sherlock, for once, stayed silent. His sharp eyes watched John through a haze of lust. John lay down so that his face was just above the tempting bulge in his boyfriend’s shorts. An inch or two away from touching with his lips, John paused. He could practically feel Sherlock straining upwards. With a grin, he licked a wide stripe up the bulge, causing Sherlock to groan. John did it again and then blew on the now wet area. With a grin, he repeated the process until Sherlock was a helpless writhing mass on the floor, utterly at his mercy.
“You forget that we age more slowly than humans. This is his third degree. He’ll turn out like Sherlock yet.”
“Allow me,” Mycroft said. He started to help Greg undress. Once his tuxedo jacket, bow tie, and waistcoat were off, he started on his shirt. “I should find reasons to get you into a tuxedo more often, Gregory. You look ravishing.”
Greg laughed. “Good point.” He took a deep breath, sighing as Mycroft nuzzled and lapped at his neck, teasing both of them with the promise of more later.
You: Sherlock stood up swiftly and stepped into his personal space. He grasped Greg's wrist and stared down into his eyes. "You are attracted to me in a sexual manner and wish to impress me so as to get into my good graces."
“Ahh, you flush so prettily, John.” Mycroft leans towards him very slowly and whispers, “I’d like to know if your skin flushes anywhere else. Hmm?”
Sherlock paused, long fingers poised over the strings of the bow. His eyes flicked to the hallway that lead to his bedroom. “I felt that John deserves protection of our House. Regardless of his…connection to myself.”
“Erm, I suppose I’m not entirely sure what those would be.” He shot Sherlock a glare, which was pointedly ignored.
The vampire looked into his eyes. “That if you want to stay. With me, we must make this work. The sex is….”
“Sherlock,” Mycroft says slowly, as if reminding him of something. The brothers lock eyes, and John has the distinct impression that he’s being talked about. His eyes flick back and for between them.
John’s mouth opened several times as a million thoughts careened through his mind. “I think I want you to take what you need,” he said haltingly, “to take – take me.”
After a moment, Sherlock looked up at John, who nearly staggered back at the weight in his sharp blue eyes. “Not unless Greg calls requiring assistance,” he said bluntly.
John flushed, flustered as if he was a school boy caught doing something wrong at recess. He smiled tightly and glanced at Greg, who was chuckling softly. “The two of you,” he muttered with a shake of his head.
From inside the limo, John sleepily watched Mycroft and Greg interact. He had to admit they were rather sweet together. He had never seen the imperious Mycroft Holmes act so human with anyone else. He leaned his head back on Sherlock’s shoulder.
“I don’t believe that we have reached that stage of our relationship, John,” Sherlock says with a smirk.
John’s eyes widened. Somehow he hadn’t figured on clothes being removed. This was threatening to short circuit his brain. He twisted a bit, trying to rearrange himself surreptitiously, but he knew that Sherlock would know what he was doing.
"That is neither here nor there, cousin. I say that it is so, and my word is final in this family. "
John adjusted his tie. Again. It was a deep silvery charcoal. All in all his outfit was a bit too much for his tastes, but his future mother-in-law had been adamant that his and Sherlock’s outfits complement each other.  Sighing, he pickup a glass of water.
Sherlock pulled John’s head to the side by his hair. “Bedroom. Now,” Sherlock growled. He hauled John down the hall away from the noise and pushed him into the room that Mycroft had identified. He slammed the door closed and locked it, turning on John like a predator stalking its prey.
“Sir?” he asked tentatively. He had only been in the vampire’s service for four days, and he wasn’t sure what to call him. Or how to approach him. How did one approach a wounded creature that could easily snap him in half?
“Got me there,” Greg replied fondly. He walked a couple of paces and turned back to Mycroft with wide eyes. “There’s no way Sherlock will miss this!”
When John looked at the other two men, he locked eyes with Greg and smiled a bit shyly. Greg grinned, as if to say ‘now that’s how you keep a Holmes in line.’
John took a quick step back and looked into the leering eyes of Allessandro. John’s eyes narrowed and he stood up taller, widening his stance. “Do lines like that usually have people throwing themselves at you?”
Greg snorted softly. He knew he should be upset over Mycroft’s interference, but somehow, after the day he’d had, he simply didn’t care. Mycroft was taking care of him, and he was ok with that. He read the message from John and his eyebrows rose. He showed it to the vampire.
“Mm. Drink the water. You’re dehydrated.” John drank, feeling the water wash over his parched throat. He looked around the room with a disoriented frown, noting his shoes placed neatly next to the couch and his jacket thrown over the back of a kitchen chair. His Browning was sitting on top of its case on the mantelpiece. “There is Thai food in the kitchen. I took the liberty of ordering something for you. You need nourishment.”
Mycroft lifted his hand and kissed it. “Yes. We’ve got a few things to do. Guests to socialize with,” he said with a wrinkle of his nose. He paused and said very softly so that only Sherlock could hear it, “The bedroom down the hall, last on the right, has been prepared for you.”
“He has been sleeping, but he has begun to wake up in the past few minutes,” Sherlock said, crossing his arms.
Glancing quickly at the bathroom, he sat on the bed and lay back so that he could gingerly swipe a finger between his legs. No wetness. Not even a drop. Perplexed, he sat up and looked down.
John smiled a bit at the logical nature that Sherlock brought to ‘the situation in which he found himself,’ as he put it. John looked at the space between them. He felt a bit vulnerable, being now naked from the waist up and Sherlock was still dressed. John gathered his courage and propped himself over Sherlock, who stared up at him intently. John’s eyes went to the vampire’s lips. They were barely parted and looked rather kissable. He slowly pressed his lips against him, slowly tasting the vampire beneath him.
Now free to act on his own, Sherlock tightens his grip, eliciting a surprised grunt from the man above him. His eyebrows rise and he does it again. John throws his head back, eyes screwed tightly shut, and he moans.
Greg crossed his arms. “You know, if it were me, I’d put him over his knee and spank him.” He watched John out of the corner of his eye.
John was saved from making a reply when Mycroft stood up. All eyes were glued to him as he stoically unbuttoned his slacks and pushed them down his long pale legs.
“Allessandro, stop being so vile.” An older stately looking woman vampire approached them. Allessandro and Sherlock, nearly ready to attack, stiffened. “You must be John Watson,” she said with a thin smile.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but his eyes flicked to John and pinned him down where he stood as the newly married couple descended the stairs to a round of applause from the guests below.
“Does this mean you’re giving up your claim to me?” John asks, smirking just a bit. “I mean, you did pay for my company.”
Stranger: Sherlock gently circled the sensitive skin of John's entrance before actually sliding his first finger in and out, carefully stretching John.
Mycroft silently closes the door and sits next to him. “Thank you.” He runs a hand tentatively over John’s leg and then leans in for a kiss.
“I don’t think either of us did,” John said with a chuckle as he kissed the spot under Sherlock’s ear.
Mycroft barked out a laugh. “No. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you’ve been reading romance novels.”
Some part of Sherlock’s mind was surprised at the strength of the possessiveness that he felt rise up towards John. His mind flashed to the bonding ritual they had witnessed and at that moment, Sherlock knew he wanted that with John. He slammed into John’s body hard. Releasing one ankle, he leaned down and bit down over John’s heart.
“Ah, yes, that sounds like a good plan.” John stood up. “Right,” he said decidedly, brushing the back of his hand against Sherlock’s cheek as he passed by on his way to the bathroom.
“I have, at times, encouraged him to consider such a plan. Though he would need Greg’s approval first, of course.”
, is somewhat private.” John snorted. “I know, amusing considering how much he pries into other people’s lives. But honestly, he does care for his brother, and he wants to know that things are ok between the two of you.”
“I had thought as much,” Sherlock says with a smile. He starts to move his hand, rubbing John’s cock through the thin blanket. John’s hand slowly moves, reaching for Sherlock’s thigh, which is startlingly close to his own.
When John was again impatiently pushing back as his hand, Sherlock decided that he was ready. He made sure to use substantial amounts of lubricant on his cock and pushed just the tip of it into the tempting hole that was winking up at him. John inhaled sharply at the first intrusion.
John looked around the cluttered mess that was 221B. It was cozy, which wasn’t what he had expected. In fact, it felt more like a home than the bare studio he had been staying in since returning from Afghanistan. Sherlock flopped down on the couch, hands behind his head, as he watched John explore.
He turned around and nearly gasped. Sherlock was standing not a foot away and John hadn’t even heard him move. “Yes.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed and he snorted. “You couldn’t keep your sexual escapades out of my home, brother?”
“You can put the gun away. He won’t be back,” Mycroft said to Greg as he turned to Sherlock. The brothers frowned at each other and Mycroft tapped the tip of his umbrella thoughtfully. “We should get you both back to your flat. My car will take you.”
Melbourne carefully examined it, nodding to himself with a smile. “Excellent. Alright, picture first. John if you could just stand over there… good.” He held up a camera and took several pictures of John, smiling a bit awkwardly in his bespoke suit. The Registrar printed the picture and placed it carefully in the book. He then carefully began to transcribe information onto the page using an old-style pen with a nib that he periodically dipped in to a well of black ink.
Stranger: "You're hard, already?" Sherlock raised a brow in interest. "Naughty boy," he whispered, trailing his hand in between John's legs and lightly stroking one finger up his length.
Greg panted heavily, pinned beneath Mycroft. He could feel blood dribbling down his neck for a moment before the vampire licked it up and lapped at the wounds. They lay like that for a while.
“Only what I need,” Sherlock reiterated with a smirk. He rolled John’s sleeve back down and buttoned the cuff. The act was almost tender, like aftercare.
He picked up his violin and began to compose a new piece, letting his thoughts guide the bow as it slid gracefully across the strings.
Stranger: "The tea can wait!" Sherlock grinned, triumphantly. He turned the stove off and pulled John into his bedroom, where he shed all of his flatmate's clothes and tossed them to the floor before staring at John's naked form with a smile on his face. "Better right?"
John started to wriggle more out of his slacks, but Sherlock stopped him. “No, like this. Just like this,” he said as he unbuttoned his shirt. He pulled John back and they both inhaled at the feeling of heated skin against skin.
Greg flushed. “Guess I decided I can put up with his weird vampiric ways for a while longer.” He paused. “Ok. Hopefully they’ve declared an armistice for the moment. You feeling ok enough to get out of bed?”
Finally, Greg stopped. He was panting lightly and the man on his lap was flushed and squirming. He ran a hand soothingly over his back and arse, and leaned down, murmuring softly.
“Yes.” Sherlock sat back casually, as if discussing the weather. “I feel that…that it is time. I would like to ensure that John carries the protection that my family can provide him, especially considering that we tend to find ourselves in dangerous situations relatively often.”
“Sorry,” John breathed out. He tugged just a bit and knew there was no way he could escape. Not that he wanted to.
Greg smiled fondly. “You and I both know that the Holmes boys are more sentimental than they let on. I mean, I know they’re out there arguing right now, but for all of their bluster, they do have each others’ backs when needed.”
Mycroft moved so swiftly that Greg didn’t have the chance to be surprised before he found himself pinned to the floor on his stomach, wrists held behind his back. “Didn’t anyone tell you not to threaten a vampire, Gregory?”
“Mycroft, I can’t. You know I can’t.” Lestrade stood tall, facing his lover. “This was my operation. Not only is there a mountain of paperwork to do for every bullet fired, but it’s my responsibility. To my team. They need me.”
Sherlock dropped his wrist and was suddenly back at the microscope. “You should speak with DI Lestrade. I’m sure he has some…interesting insights to impart.”
The man nodded with a tight smile. “Yes, please allow me to introduce myself, Dr. Watson. I am Sherlock’s older brother. I thought I should introduce myself to my brother’s newest…friend.”
“Now John, we wouldn’t be taking care of you properly if we allowed you to finish yourself, hmm?” Mycroft leans closer. “Sherlock and I intend to take care of you…completely.”
“Yes…” Sherlock said slowly. “Tomorrow we will go to the Blood Registry Office. It is time to take further measures to ensure that someone like Alessandro cannot act in such a way towards you. It will….formalize your relationship to me. And to the Holmes family.”
John pushed his cock inside completely. “I think I like hearing your gorgeous voice telling me how much you want me.”
Stranger: Greg smirked against Sherlock's lips, nipping gently against the lower one. He grew a bit bolder and began to palm Sherlock's erection gently.
“Ma lui non ha alcuna, cugino segno. Si dovrebbe prendere più cura delle tue cose. Potrebbe vengono per nuocere.”
"Ah, erm, yes. He has...um…Mycroft says that you were at the charity auction, too? Why didn't you tell me you were planning to go?"
You: John shuddered at the feeling of those talented fingers focused on his skin. He could feel Sherlock's cock pressing between his ass cheeks, and he pushed back against it.
“Thank you. That will be all. I am not to be disturbed for the next couple of days unless England goes to war.”
John can’t help it. He smiles. The speech is so incredibly Sherlock; bold, clinically dispassionate, and blunt. As if he isn’t suggesting they have a wank together.
Sherlock stood up and approached him. He gently but firmly cupped John’s face between his hands. “Tomorrow probably won’t be pleasant, but it will make you safer around people like my prick of a cousin. Today was…too close.” He looked at him intently, as if willing him to understand.
John’s hands gripped the headboard, holding himself open and vulnerable for Sherlock. The vampire held his ankles hard and he knew there was no possibility of pulling free from that grip. Not that he wanted to. His cock bounced hard and leaking, untouched, on his belly. He used what mobility he had to push his hips up into each thrust.
John shivers at the words, at their sensuous promise. John presses his lips to Mycroft’s, asking for more. Asking for everything.
Mycroft nodded his head and pointedly didn’t look in his direction. “In my hundredth year, my mother despaired that Sherlock or I would ever find our mates. We have to have an heir, you see. We live for so long and real bonds are rare…” He paused and cleared his throat. “My mother asked that one of us sire a child. Well, being the older one, I couldn’t refuse the responsibility.”
chair. Sherlock sat working on his laptop, and John hadn’t even realized he was staring at him until the vampire suddenly stopped and turned to him.
Mycroft watched, marveling at the sensual pleasure Greg took in such a simple thing. He soaped up a loofah and picked up Greg’s left arm. He ran the loofah over the skin, letting the water wash off the suds, and then trailed kisses up the sensitive underside. Greg groaned softly, watching him from beneath hooded eyes. Mycroft repeated the action with the other arm, but this time he held the right arm up and gently nipped at the skin on the inside of the elbow. He allowed his fangs to sink into the skin, eliciting a sharp hiss from the other man. Mycroft drank only a little and whet his appetite before lapping the incisions closed.
“Rearranging the mantle multiple times will not make this event occur faster, Gregory,” Mycroft said calmly from his seat with a hint of amusement.
“Yeah…” Greg took another swig, idly playing a finger along the side of his own neck. “Did he give you instructions?”
“Anna and I stayed together until she gave birth. Xavier Leopold. My son. Our son.” Mycroft pulled out a portfolio and showed Greg a picture of a solemn looking teenager with sandy hair in a suit.
Mycroft’s laugh was low and mirthless. “Oddly, you aren’t far off the mark, if presenting it in a very crude light. No, it was a contract. More like a business agreement. Anna Kirenov was chosen by myself and my mother from an old vampire family in Russia. She was chosen for her blood, her intelligence, and her stature in our world. She was, is….what would have once been described by good society as accomplished.”
Mycroft laughed. “True, but it helps the fantasy.” He teased a fingertip around one of Greg’s nipples. “Are you truly ready to give yourself to me, your lord, to be used for my pleasure?” He pinched the nipple.
But it was the other bits that made John nervous. It wasn’t that he was afraid of Sherlock, he just didn’t know what they were
You: Mycroft helped his sit up slowly. He winced. "I do wish you could leave the running after criminals to others, Gregory," he said softly. He helped Greg walk down the hall to where the car was waiting.
Sherlock looked down and then his eyes flew back up to meet John’s. “You’re an alpha,” he whispered.
John looked at the text from Greg and frowned. “He says they’re going to take my picture. Why do they need a picture of me? I thought they already had one from when you initially claimed the contract?”
“Greg told me that every time you feed from me, directly from my body, that it forms a bond. But you never take enough blood, even though you
Chuckling, Mycroft knelt between his soon-to-be-mate’s spread legs. He slicked lubricant over a medium sized butt plug and gently worked it into Greg’s hole. When it was seated, he ran his hands lovingly over his silk-wrapped thighs. “I’m afraid I can’t wait any longer, Gregory.” His fingers dug into Greg’s shins. “I have been hungering for you…”
John snorts. He can’t help it. He’s never had a partner make clinical assessments of him while in bed. “And I’m the one being distracting?”
“Whatever it is, just say it,” Sherlock says, sounding almost bored. “Then maybe it won’t be such a loud thought.”
“Look. It’s dangerous. This fucker has an armory in there and he’s a bit unstable. Stay here and protect the medical team that’s on backup, ok?”
John chuckled. “Being a bit overdramatic, aren’t we?” John led them up to the front door and rang the bell.
“The reses. It will make you sluggish. It’s a skill that Alessandro is apparently not very skilled in since he seems to have overdosed you. You shouldn’t be this soporific if he knew what he was doing.”
The plate of profiteroles (or cream filled things, as John calls them) is half empty, and as Sherlock picked up another one and brings it to his lips, he decided he would buy them more often.
“That way!” Lestrade ran down the alley after the murderer, Sherlock, John, and a couple of other officers on his trail. They turned several corners, jumping over piles of garbage and dumpsters, and one surprised homeless man buried in a pile of rags. Suddenly, Sherlock stopped. John put his hands out, pushing off of the vampire’s solid back to keep from running into him completely. The rest continued running.
“You’re telling me? The other day I found out that he hadn’t eaten in three days. He said that it ‘distracted him,’” John said, adding air quotes and rolling his eyes.
Mycroft moved forwards and smoothly pushed Greg to lie on his back on the bed. He knelt and gently but forcefully spread Greg’s legs and moved to crouch between them. He completely ignored their witnesses and kept his focus solely on Greg. He could see the traces of lube around Greg’s hole. He teased a finger down his inner thigh, making Greg shiver, legs falling open a bit more in submission. Mycroft smiled and boldly pushed a finger into his prepared hole. Greg whimpered at the intrusion and his cock began to fill again.
You: John swallowed. Why did Sherlock have to be sex personified? "Need a distraction then before you blow up the kitchen in some experiment?"
“I may have waived my wrist under his nose once or twice until he did.” John flushed a bit, remembering the intense look that Sherlock had given him that time. They had been in a dark sedan coming from the end of an investigation. Sherlock had nearly pinned John to the seat with his free hand as he had fed. It had made his blood boil and his cock ache.
Sherlock pulled back and rested his head against the wall next to John’s head. “John,” he pressed himself bodily into him, pressing him against the wall. “I believe I need you.”
Stranger: Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist and lightly bit his lip, his tongue prodding against John's lips.
“Fuck,” Sherlock ground out when he saw John’s fingers wet with natural lubrication. “I had no idea my body could do that.”
“Sherlock, this is very important to me. Not only that, but the tests show that John is the perfect match for you genetically. This match is likely to produce very healthy children, alphas in particular.” She looked back at Mycroft, who was leaning casually against the wall. “Mycroft, make sure your brother is at the ceremony on time.” She gave her sons a blinding smile and said, “Now, be good for Mummy and stay here while I see to the guests.”
“Why thank you, Gregory. I’m so glad you appreciate my skills.” He slowly pushed the tip of one finger into Greg’s back hole. He knew it was enough to tease, but not enough to actually stretch him.
“Oh, sorry si-Sherlock." He paused. "Seems more comfortable anyway,” John said, a hint of relief in his voice.
“So,” Greg said, pushing his hands under Mycroft’s crisp white shirt and up expanse of his back, “now what?”
You: "You are not broken. Nor are you old. But I do love you." The car came to a stop in front of their townhouse. "Ok, up you get."
John tilted his head to the side in blatant invitation. “Then take, Sherlock. Take what you need.” He swallowed nervously and his pulse raced. His eyes slowly rose and met the vampire’s.
Stranger: He sucked the skin greedily, biting and nipping at John as his hand teased his cock, sliding his thumb over the leaking slit and creating a delicious burn. "What do you want me to do to you, John? I won't do anything until you tell me."
Greg snorted. “Good chance, that. Clearly that pri-guy was your cousin. So you’ve got an unpleasant cousin. Who doesn’t?”
“I’d like to start with seven suits. No three pieces – that’s my brother’s style. Simple, comfortable. Two dozen shirts. A handful of ties. Nothing too flashy. And I suppose I must order one with the family crest on it for family gatherings and the like.” Sherlock sounded annoyed at the last request.
“Oh John…It won’t be so bad. You’ll have the best doctors around you. Like Mrs. Holmes would settle for less. I’m sure Brandon would be willing to talk to you about it,” she said, referring to their cousin, a rather fertile omega who was currently showing the belly of his and his alpha’s fourth child. “I mean look, you - we – we’re omegas. This is what we do, right?”
“Well then, that’s that. Now let’s proceed. Mr. Holmes, if you will. We’ll need at five drops each.”
“Actually, I did a bit of looking around….And I might have asked for some information from my future brother-in-law,” Greg admitted with a smirked.
John sighed mentally and pointedly took his food to the couch as Sherlock pulled several jars of eye balls out of the fridge. They eyes were sitting in different liquids and showed various states of decay. Sherlock leaned down, looking at them intently and made notes on a pad of paper.
Sherlock pulled back. “What do you want, John?” he asked in a soft murmur before sniffing at his neck.
Greg wasn’t sure what to think of this description of a woman he’d never met. He suddenly felt jealous and inadequate. She sounded wholly unlike him.
“That I don’t know,” Sherlock says. The way he nearly grinds out those three words makes John think that they are very costly to say.
Across the room, Mycroft is methodically removing his clothing, piece by piece, slowly baring his pale skin. He carefully lays the clothes on a chair and approaches the pair on the loveseat.
John went very still. He had seen this look on Sherlock before, and it never failed to make him feel hunted. Prey. A thrill or fear and arousal shot up his spine and he let his head tilted back in submission.
Stranger: "Whatever you want," Sherlock smiled, beginning to pound into his lover with his hands underneath John's knees, spreading them up higher.
John wondered just how fast Sherlock would heal. Vampires were very quiet about their physiology, most likely to protect themselves from the humans obtaining knowledge of their weaknesses. John knew that they could heal very quickly, that they needed human blood to survive, and that they preferred to have specific blood donors.
Greg approached the bedroom quietly and gently pushed the door open. John sleepily looked up at him from Sherlock’s bed.
“Well, what can I say? I must admit that the question of your sexuality remained a bit of a mystery for quite some time. And then this opportunity presented itself."
John can’t help it. He looks at Mycroft’s mouth. He swallows and when he raises his eyes, the other man leans forward and gently kisses him.
Mycroft and Greg moved towards the door, the vampire’s hand on the latter’s lower back. Before walking out the door, Mycroft turned to his brother, who was standing now, poised to begin playing, and hissed softly, “Sherlock, as thrilled as I am that you’re taking responsibility of John, don’t you think it would be prudent to discuss these things with himself and with me ahead of time?”
You: "Eh, he's too...too nuts." John groaned and arched his neck, loving it when the sensitive skin there was touched and nibbled and licked
“Mr. Holmes, take as long as you and your John here need. Please ring me via that button there,” he pointed to an electronic base on a table next to a sofa, “when you are done. I will need to inspect the mark to ensure that its placement and image match the registry. Then you will be free to leave. When you’re finished, there is a private exit through that door. Your driver can meet you outside of the building.”
“Delightful. So very tempting, isn’t he?” Mycroft says, his breath tickling Sherlock’s left ear as he leans close to whisper.
John reaches out and unbuttons Sherlock’s pajama top, slowly uncovering his pale skin. When it’s fully unbuttoned, he pushes it off Sherlock’s shoulders. He runs a hand down the skin. He’s seen Sherlock with his top off before. They’re flatmates. But he’s never given into the impulse to touch until now.
An inner office door opened and a man stepped out. His three-piece suit was pristine and he exuded jovial confidence. He smiled at them. “Mr. Holmes. I am Stanworth Melbourne, Registrar.”
“No,” Sherlock said with a slight shake of the head. “That only happens when necessary when fighting.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked to John, who stood almost at military attention. “Tea,” he said and took a seat on a chair.
Sherlock nearly leapt off the bed in his haste to shed his clothes. Once naked, he knelt between John’s legs so quickly, John didn’t have the chance to shift on the bed. Sherlock grasped John’s thighs from underneath and spread them out and up. He stared down at John’s tight hole and ran the tip of a finger around it.
They were silent until the car reached 221B. Sherlock managed to rouse John enough to guide him inside, and then he carried him up the stairs and deposited him on the couch. Sherlock covered John with a blanket from his bed. He could hear his heartbeat, slow and steady. Sherlock knelt next to the couch and gently tilted John's head to the side. Two rough puncture wounds were visible. The skin was red and irritated, and Sherlock felt another growl rising in his throat. He was tempted to find Alessandro and rip his throat out. Instead, he leaned down and carefully licked the wounds, healing them. The scent of John welled up, tempting him to bite and take, but he shook his head, quickly moving across the room to the window.
“Then you’ll have to try hard to appear perfectly normal,” Mycroft replied calmly before smacking his hip.
Watching this interplay, John swallowed as arousal spiked in his groin. He glanced at Sherlock. The younger man was watching with open interest, as if perplexed and trying to deduce more information, and frowning slightly.
The vampire Alessandro snarled and turned, bringing John with him so that his back was pinned to the vampire’s front. He held him there with one arm around John’s chest; the other hand painfully held onto his hair, keeping John’s neck arched and open. “Oh, davvero? Non vedo alcuna pretesa su di lui. E odori divina. Sicuramente l'hai annusato?” He smirked and sniffed at John’s neck.
John glanced at Sherlock again, assessing him. Sherlock was tense, but a large bulge was forming in his bespoke slacks. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist and pulled him back against him as he leaned back on the sofa. Sherlock stiffened.
“Of course. It would be rather inconvenient for you to come here by way of the coffee shop whenever I need you.” Sherlock picked up a knife and casually twirled it between his fingers. If it cut skin, John couldn’t tell. “Besides, that dreadful little place where you’ve been living, if you can call it such, is utterly depressing.”
“So responsive,” Sherlock muttered into John’s neck as he set a moderate rhythm of fisting John’s cock.
Sherlock gently sliced through the thin fabric of John pants. John tensed up but felt no slice of pain, so he opened his eyes and looked down to the predator kneeling over his body. “Sherlock?”
Mycroft winced internally, having preferred to put off this particular discussion. “I was rather hoping you’d forgotten.”
You: Mycroft took pity and entwined their fingers. "You like it. Maybe not this part, but you do. Though I personally wish you would take better care, Gregory. I don't want you hurt - hurt for real."
“Not there,” John said, glancing down to where Sherlock touched him. Silently, he titled his head back and to the side, showing his bare neck in blatant invitation.
The bathroom door opened and Sherlock looked out, appearing a bit furtive. “John…John there’s been a – a complication. I believe. A mistake. I – ohhhh, you smell good.” Sherlock stepped into the room and licked his lips.
Mycroft chuckles softly. He unzips his crisp slacks and silently guides one of John’s hands to the opening. John gasps when he feels the hard cock pushing through the opening. The idea that Mycroft Holmes goes commando is probably going to ruin his image of the stiff politician forever. His fingers curl around the shaft and he starts to rub, eyes pinned to where his own cock is disappearing between Sherlock’s lips.
When Sherlock turned around, he nearly pinned John to the bed with his eyes. He slowly moved towards the bed, gracefully like a predator.
“Good observation,” John said, leaning down to kiss him again. As they kiss, he lets his body down, slowly laying himself out over his omega husband. The skin to skin contact was everything he’d ever dreamed of, though he’d always imagined himself on the bottom. Sherlock was hot and wet and wanton beneath him.
him. Mycroft has, over his years, made it a special mission to not form attachments. Emotions, attachments, these are not strengths to him. This is the first time that he has
John whimpered as Sherlock began to tap into a part of himself he’d rarely looked at or accepted. He tilted his head forward more for Sherlock. “Yes. For you.”
“Hush,” Mycroft says, perching elegantly on the couch next to him. “Sherlock and I both believe that you are beautiful, so beautiful you are.”
John sits with a sigh and stares at the fire. Why did he agree to subject himself to this again? Oh yes. For charity.
The silence was broken when John started to stand back up, reaching for Sherlock. The vampire slammed John back down and pinned his wrists against the sofa. “Didn’t say you could move,” Sherlock growled softly.
Greg followed him into the kitchen, guiltily rubbing the back of his neck. He grabbed a bottle of beer from the fridge and took a long swig, sighing happily when he put it down.
Sherlock taking his blood in hungry gulps. He could feel Sherlock swallow. He could feel Sherlock’s soft curls tickling the side of his face in direct contract to the sharp push of his fangs.
pet. You smell rather edible.” He pointedly looked John up and down. “But you aren’t wearing any marker. Unclaimed, hmm?” He reached out and ran the tip of a finger down the shell of John’s left ear.
John closes his eyes. He’s overwhelmed by sensation, by the feeling of being stretched and filled and used and taken and claimed and as he glances up at Sherlock’s face, he realizes cherished, too.
After a minute, Sherlock pulled the sigil away and buried his nose in John’s hair. “It’s done,” he said softly.
Mycroft laughed. He leaned up and placed a soft kiss on the tip of Greg’s cock. It was soft. Closing his eyes, Mycroft could focus on Greg’s heart beat. It was high and fast. Greg was nervous, which was going to make this harder. He helped Greg out of his clothes until he stood before him naked. “You’re beautiful,” he murmured. He stood up and started to undo his bow tie but Greg stopped him.
The vampire released John and roughly pushed him into Sherlock, who caught him easily and pulled him flush against his chest to hold him up. It was then that John noticed that Sherlock’s claws were out as the tips just barely pushed against his skin through the layers of clothing. He winced but stayed silent. A quick glance showed him that Sherlock’s fangs were out and his eyes, normally bright, were dark and angry.
Greg laughed, voice low. “Good. Now, are you going to tie me up? Or do I need to threaten to go run some errands on my day off?”
Sherlock squirmed, blushing. “Like – I’m on display. And that you’d take care of me…even if I were bad.”
“I know, love, but it won’t take too long, judging by our state of things.” Mycroft smirked. He handed Greg a robe and put one on himself. The robes were deep burgundy colored and hung heavy to their ankles. “I’ll text Sherlock to let him know we’re ready.”
Sherlock’s eyes darkened in response. He leaned down and teased the tips of his fangs along the tender skin that he saw there. John shivered.
“N-no...sir,” John breathed out as he fingers tightened around the wood of the headboard. He squeezed his hole around Sherlock’s cock and grinned at the gasp that he managed to pull from the vampire.
Surprised, Greg fall back on the chaise. He looked up at the vampire, sprawled out and vulnerable. Mycroft smirked down at him. He slowly ran a hand up Greg’s thigh. “Is this some unvoiced fantasy of yours, pet? Blushing virgin given to a vampire lord to be used for his pleasure?” he purred, pushing Greg backwards.
Sherlock’s eye slipped closed and he moaned in ecstasy. How could he have gone nearly 200 years without tasting this?
“Um, just how we’re doing. Whether you feed from me. Stuff like that.” John flushed a bit. He now had an almost Pavlovian response to the idea of feeding, the mere mention of which made him hard and aching. If Sherlock noticed, he never said anything. John leaned against the counter and watched him, trying to look casual.
Instead, John was looking at what was clearly the penis of an alpha. He touched the length and hissed at the sudden pleasure. Looking down, he could see a knot starting to form at the base, seeking a mate.
“Who am I to deny you that?” Sherlock murmured. He almost gently tilted John’s head to the side and bit down hard on the tender skin. He grinned when John shouted as his climax rushed over him and then groaned as he felt the human fall apart beneath him. John’s hole shuddered and clamped down, wringing Sherlock’s own climax out of him. Groaning, he collapsed on top of John.
John blinked when, after a moment, nothing else was forthcoming. “Ok. Why did he come here then? It didn’t look like a very friendly chat.”
John sat stiffly. One finger nervously tapped out a rhythm on his leg. He was, as requested, wearing the dark charcoal suit. They were running a bit late because Sherlock had burst into John’s room just as he was tying the knot in his tie and insisted that a different shirt would be better. John had sighed and stripped off his shirt and changed into the crisp white shirt and put on the offered tie. John had to admit that the new tie, which was deep green, made his eyes pop out. If Sherlock thought he looked good, he didn’t give any indication.
“Yes, but then, I think you’ve belonged to my brother for a good deal longer. Gentlemen.” And with that, Mycroft steps out and closes the door.
Greg shrugged. “Depends on where you both take it. You could form a nice friendship, live as colleagues who happen to share blood from time to time. Or…well, I mean, John,
“Well. Yes. I suppose that I can admit to such an - alteration,” the elder Holmes said slowly. “This would seem to be an appropriate time to announce that I have asked Gregory to bond with me. And he has accepted.”
John ripped the towel away and quickly shed his robe, leaving them both bare and naked. He pushed a knee between Sherlock’s long legs. Sherlock felt the knee nudging up between his spread legs and he groaned, pushing down on it.
John blinks. He tries to come up with something to say, and isn’t sure whether he should jump out of the bed and run, or grab Sherlock’s hand and press it wantonly between his legs. He settles for gaping at Sherlock’s hand, which has moved an inch up his leg.
“And what types of pieces would you like to order, sir?” the tailor asked Sherlock with a bow. John tried not protest that
The sound of the front door being opened by a servant interrupted Mycroft’s reply. “Ah. They’re here.”
“Don’t go all soft on me now, Myc. And I mean that in more ways than one.” He jerked his hips up meaningfully. Arms half-wrapped around Mycroft’s shoulders, Greg typed out a quick reply to John.
“Much better. I know you’re nervous, pet, but you’re going to be spectacular. I know it. Don’t you want to please me?”
A group of police officers began moving their way down the street towards the warehouse where a serial killer was holed up with what was likely a rather impressive arsenal of weapons obtained through mob connections. The second team took their places, and John moved backwards to give them more room. Greg glanced his way once with a nod while speaking softly into a police radio. Around John, officers stood at attention, weapons drawn.
“Of course. It’s late. Besides, we did effectively buy your charity volunteer contract from Annabelle, thereby making you ours for the night.” He smiles at John.
“Of course,” Sherlock replied. He looked at John intently. “I am...pleased you had the chance to witness the bonding, Mycroft and Greg’s wedding. But we do not need to stumble in that direction. For now.”
Crouching on the ground, next to the warehouse, John reached back under his jacket and pulled out his Browning. He smiled slightly to himself, eyes darting around the scene thoughtfully, as he checked the gun for readiness. It had taken a bit of arguing, but he had managed to convince Sherlock that he would be a bit more comfortable at crime scenes if he wasn’t wearing a tailored suit. He now sported a Haversack shooting jacket. The best, of course, that a Holmes’s money could buy. John had to admit that the jacket was rather comfortable.
Surprised, John’s head snapped around and he found himself staring into the intent eyes of Sherlock Holmes. John swallowed at the sudden feeling of having all of Sherlock’s powerful mind focused solely on him. He didn’t bother to ask how Sherlock even knew what he was thinking. “Right.” He offered up a bit of a smile and a nod. “Oh. The bowing at the end. What was that?”
John laughed. “Ok. Fine. It feels good, ok? Like, bloody brilliant. It hurts a bit, yeah, but then it’s like I’m rushing through a bright light and he’s there with me, pulling me with him. And then when he’s done, it’s like I’m plopped back down in reality with two puncture wounds and a hard on.” Greg snorted. “And then he cleans me up and rolls down my sleeve…he’s so oddly tender. Like I’m going to break.” John finished talking, flushed, and took a long swig of beer. When he looked up again, he found Greg looking at him thoughtfully.
Smiling, Greg pressed his lips against Mycroft’s, feeling his love for the vampire well up in his chest.
Sherlock stood up swiftly and held out his hand to John. John stood and let Sherlock hold out his left hand. Looking him in the eyes, the vampire cut into the tip of John’s finger pad with one extended fang. John winced slightly, but didn’t resist as Sherlock held his hand palm up. He then bit into his own finger.
You: John broke from the kiss, panting. He rolle dhis head back so that he could say lowly in Sherlock's ear, "When I was wanking this morning, I imagined you telling me you were going to fuck me. Hard. And then you pushed inside me, making me take it."
formed such an attachment to anyone, and the interest is compounded by the fact that Greg is human.”
You: John moaned softly. It was better than his wanking fantasy. Much much better. He reached up behind him blindly and pulled Sherlock's head down by the hair and kissed him,.
John pushes himself up so that he’s resting on his side. Looking down at Sherlock’s face, he runs a hand over the pointed chin. “Like the man said, this is where I belong.” He smiles and leans down for a kiss.
John’s hips pushed up into Sherlock’s hand and he didn’t resist when the vampire let go of his cock and carefully titled his head to the right and forward. John tensed automatically.
Chuckling softly, Sherlock picked John up in his arms as if he were a doll, and carried him quickly down the hall to his bedroom. John was so surprised, he didn’t protest and merely gaped up at Sherlock’s determined face. In the bedroom, Sherlock laid him down on the bed. John leaned back on his elbows and watched Sherlock take off his blazer and carefully hang it in the closet.
“I’m afraid, love, that I need to make use of that mouth.” Greg moaned as Mycroft straddled him and pushed his cock into Greg’s mouth. Mycroft hissed. For a man who had once been married to a woman, Greg was astoundingly good at giving head. He slowly pushed his cock in and out, careful not to push in too deeply. He suspected that Greg was too tired for such roughness tonight.
The vampire rolled his eyes. He stepped forwards and pushed John into the warehouse wall, pinning his hands at his sides as he did. “I’m sure that your…master won’t care. He probably won’t even notice. Come now, puppy, play nice,” the vampire said in a soothing voice that belied his dangerous intentions.
“Take it off,” John said, nodding at the shirt. Obediently, Sherlock wriggled to get his shirt off. Half way through complying, John held up his hand. “Actually, stop there.”
The door flew open and Sherlock Holmes walked briskly out and closed the door behind him. “You’re here. Good. Come along then.” He walked quickly past John, who scrambled to turn around followed him. Sherlock slipped gracefully into a black sedan that had appeared smoothly from around the corner. John climbed inside somewhat more awkwardly.
Greg chuckled softly at the usually composed man. He placed a finger over Mycroft’s lips. “Mycroft, what are you trying to say?”
someone would do that, but of course, the vampires, though there were fewer of them, lived much longer and had powers humans could only dream of, and, frankly, they controlled the banks. By law, a vampire could claim a contract any time between the contracted human’s age of 15 and 35. John was 34, and his contract has been sold by his struggling parents to the Holmes family when he had been a child. The poor veteran doctor had started to think the Holmes’s had forgotten about the contract completely. He’d thought he was safe.
“Why do you think I’m not interested?” Sherlock says, quickly typing in a number and hitting the submit key. Mycroft smiles and sits back.
Mycroft grasped Greg’s knees and spread his legs. “Oh lovely. I’m going to enjoy taking your virginity.” He teased a finger tip down Greg’s cock and balls.
Victoire eyed John once and tilted her head in acknowledgement, though John thought he caught a flash of a smile. “You have duties to your brother, do you not?” she asked, turning to Sherlock.
For a minute, John didn’t think he would get an answer. He couldn’t see Sherlock’s face as it was still buried in the crook of his neck. “Because you’re you,” he said finally. John frowned. “Because you’re interesting and brave and so very solid. And, you smell utterly divine.” Sherlock sniffed at his neck again and sighed happily.
The blond woman handed each of them a cup of tea with a bright smile, which John tried to return. He took several sips and smiled. What was it about tea that always made him relax? It occurred to him that Sherlock had asked for it for this very reason. The vampire hadn’t touched his.
“Excellent, then let’s proceed, shall we?” Melbourne left the book lying open and gestured to them to follow him. He walked through a small side door and into a side room. This room was comfortably decorated with several plush chairs and sofas. A side table held several drink options, including, John noted, scotch. A fire burned bright and hot in a fireplace.
John grabbed the new bottle of lube helpfully helpfully set out with a towel on the bedside table. He spread his legs wantonly and paused for a moment to watch Sherlock reveal his beautiful body before coating two fingers with lube. He hissed as he pushed both fingers inside his body, lying back to revel in the feeling.
DI Gregory Lestrade looked at his watch as he unlocked the front door to the Belgravia flat he shared with Mycroft.
John’s legs fell to the bed in a boneless rush and he panted. He let go of the headboard and embraced Sherlock, who lay on top of him. They lay like that for a few minutes, catching their breath, bodies entwined.
Mycroft looks calm and suave as usual, pale fingers wrapped around a martini glass. He takes a sip, eyes meeting his brother’s glare. He smirks.
Suddenly, John finds himself alone as the Holmes brothers rearrange them like some sort of pre-planned ballet. Sherlock prowls behind the loveseat as Mycroft gently arranges John on his knees facing the back and Sherlock. John’s knees sink into the plush cushions and he cranes his neck to look up at Sherlock, who runs a hand through John’s hair in a surprisingly tender caress.
Sherlock snaked his tongue out and slowly licked at the cream around the edge, a move that should, John thought, be made illegal it was so erotic. Sherlock popped the sweet into his mouth and then licked the rest of the cream off his fingers. His eyes met John’s, who shook his head good naturedly. Of course Sherlock knew of the effect he would have him.
John climbed the steps and stopped one step higher than Sherlock. “Well, since apparently the whole thing is one big secret, I’m a bit hesitant, yeah,” John said. The anger in his voice was clear.
Stranger: In one slow movement, Sherlock was pushed in all the way with a soft groan. "John...." He sighed. "You feel so good."
possible to remove should the connection become wholly undesired.” Melbourne frowned at him. “But such a procedure is…painful at best.”
Sherlock nodded with a deep hum and John hesitantly ran a hand through his dark curls. They stayed like that for a minute. Finally John spoke. “So, now what?”
“You were on display. In fact, you’re still on display. For me…and you like it,” John said, letting his hand rest over the bulge in Sherlock’s shorts.
Mycroft chuckled softly. “My sweet Gregory. You are….so precious to me.” He grasped Greg’s chin and held him still for a kiss. The he walked Greg backwards until his legs hit a chaise lounge behind him.
“John, look, I’m in the same boat. I’ve been there. Trust me when I say that at this point of your connection between you and Sherlock, there’s nothing you can say that I probably haven’t already experienced.”
John thought of his acquaintances. The human ones. He couldn’t imagine many of them having anything negative to say. He was, after all, in the service of a vampire under contract. How much choice did he actually have? He shrugged in return. “I try not to get involved too much in politics.”
Fascinated, John watched Sherlock squeeze several drops of blood from each finger in turn and let them drop onto a blank space on the book’s page. Their blood combined on the page and then Melbourne produced an eyedropper and squeezed two drops of something onto the blood.
They pull apart, panting. The blanket has somehow shifted and John’s cock is bare and hard and wanting. John doesn’t move to cover it up, letting Sherlock look. And he does look, long and hard until John shifts under the scrutiny.
The door of the ritzy hotel suite closed with a soft click and John sat heavily on the couch. “I have to say, I kind of like the idea of not staying at the manor. That wedding planner…”
Mycroft’s blue eyes met his, face a careful mask devoid of emotion. He blinked once and then re-crossed his legs.
Stranger: Sherlock watched the doctor curiously and snapped his hips forward, a harder thrust in experiment.
The vampire silently ran the tip of his claw down John’s white undershirt, making the man beneath him hiss softly. He parted the material and revealed a thin line of blood slicing down the middle of his chest. Sherlock smiled and leaned down so that he could lick one long stripe up John’s chest.
Sherlock slowly ran the tip of his claw down John’s chest in various random patterns. He only pushed hard enough to cut the skin several times, and each time he carefully watched John’s face, mesmerized by the emotions that flitted across his features.
“Mmm, they do make you look delicious,” John said. “We’ll buy you a new pair.” He pulled the fabric away from Sherlock’s arse and picked up the scissors he’d found. He carefully cut into the seam, creating a large slit in the back. “Perfect,” he muttered, rather proud of himself.
“Yeah, been decent so far,” John replied with a shrug. “Nothing much really. He got me a load of new expensive clothes.” John gestured to his outfit of a tailored suit. “And so far I’ve been helping clean up the flat. Bit of a mess really, but loads of interesting stuff. He’s got these things that people have given as gifts, including this vase from the Duke of –“
“Trying? Not in the slightest. I was merely pointing out that you appear to be taking on your responsibilities as a master of a human in your care as a contract.”
John sent his eyes skyward. “I just want to know…know why!” He gestured vaguely with his hands, flustered.
John sat with a plate of thai basil beef at the kitchen table. With the first bite he realized how hungry he felt. “Is it supposed to knock you out like that?” he asked between bites.
Sherlock’s cell phone chimed. “Lestrade,” Sherlock said without looking. “I’ll be back later. Rest.”
Mycroft smirks at his younger brother and raises an eyebrow in a questioning challenge. Sherlock glares but nods once and hits the submit key. Mycroft sits back and smiles.
At the end of this surprising speech, John swallowed nervously and turned away to explore the kitchen. No food, except for blood bags in the fridge, of course. But a whole lot of lab equipment. “Do you do…experiments here?”
John jumps up and spins around, reflexes kicking in. “Mycroft?” he asks dubiously as the elder Holmes brother closes the door as quietly as he had opened it.
Greg opened the door with a smile. “Glad you guys could make it!” He stood back and let them in. He was wearing black jeans and a tight blue tshirt, and, Sherlock noted under his breath, was barefoot.
Sherlock saw John’s bravery rise and he smirked. “My brave, John,” he purred, stalking forwards slowly. “Such spark for life.” In an instant, he lunged forwards and pinned John to the bed before the human could react. “Mine,” Sherlock murmured.
Greg shrugged as if it had been easy. “But I do trust you, Mycroft, whether I’m your partner or your submissive or your blushing virgin,” he said with a wink.
Sherlock was still in position, and John knelt behind him. “Well, I hope you aren’t too attached to this delightful pair of shorts, Sherlock.”
Stranger: Greg sat up with a groan, swaying slightly and leaning on Mycroft's shoulder as his vision filled with spots. He stopped and cradled his head in his hands, moaning softly, cursing under his breath.
You: "Sooner or later?! Sherlock, you can't - I can't wait." John knelt on the floor next to him and palmed his cock through the silk boxers.
“It seemed only fair, considering we did combine our financial resources to ensure that no one else got their hands on you.” John cranes his head up to where Sherlock is speaking, standing right behind him. Sherlock gently, if possessively, rubs his hand down John’s bared neck.
“Hmm, apparently we’ve discovered a new kink,” John said with a grin. “I’m going to enjoy exploring this with you.”
You: Sherlock's sharp eyes read over him. Shifting on his feet - nervous. Showered and shaved recently. Wearing a good suit. Trying to impress someone. His eyes widened. "You want to impress me."
Stranger: Sherlock saw this and continued to finger his lover open just to tease him and added a third finger, drawing out the preparation.
The pub was loud and busy as Greg brought the first round of drinks to the corner table John had staked out for the two of them.
The vampire dropped down on top of him, knocking him to the ground in a flurry of speed and strength. John gasped, watching in awe. He had never actually seen a vampire in action like this. He had heard of it. There had even been a special force of them in Her Majesty’s Army in Afghanistan, but the group was very secretive and no one talked about its tactics or the missions it completed. Ever. In less than a minute of tussling, Sherlock had the man pinned to the ground and whining in pain as he pulled one arm behind his back at an awkward angle.
With a grin, Mycroft slicked up a butt plug. It was small really, but it was metal and heavy enough to be very distracting. He slowly pushed it inside Greg’s hole and left the bed. He typed a quick text to Anthea.
They lay there like that, panting softly. After a moment, Sherlock extricated himself and pulled the back of John’s shorts up, caressing his hip.
Sherlock growled softly. “Slut,” he said with a smirk. “Trying to pull more of me into you.” He paused deep inside of John’s body and leaned down to lick his neck and bite him again.
You: Sherlock grasped Greg's arms. How had his arousal risen so quickly? "I believe we should do something about our mutual...problem."
from one of your kind, it forms a connection.” Sherlock’s voice was low and slower than normal, sending shivers up John’s spine. He held John’s wrist up to his nose and sniffed audibly. To John, it appeared that he was sniffing a glass of fine wine.
John slowly leans back, bringing the other man with him until Mycroft is half atop him, pressing down into him deliciously. The way that Mycroft silently teases his way into John’s mouth make John think that he’d like to entangle himself in negotiations with this man more often.
Mummy Holmes clapped her hands and pulled Sherlock’s hands into her own. “Oh I’m so proud of you. My darling baby boy all grown up. Getting ready to enter into the long honorable tradition of bringing a child on a healthy omega.” She cupped Sherlock’s face and patted his cheeks. He glanced behind her at Mycroft, who smirked and shrugged, as if to say, What? You want me to upset Mummy?
For several minutes, John stared at the door, as if willing the mystery of a vampire to walk back through it and explain himself.
Greg laughed softly and sipped his tea. “Ok. The bond sounds like a good deal to me, what with the physical changes and all. What do you get out it?”
“Alright. Shirt off and on your hands and knees,” John said firmly, helping Sherlock up and into position. John sat back on his heels and admired the sight. How could he be so lucky? Sherlock put so much trust in him. “Stay just like this, Sherlock. I’ll be right back.” He stood up, giving him one smooth smack before wandering over to the kitchen, shedding his shirt as he walked. He rifled through a couple of drawers before wandering back.
“Mmm, that’s a fact is it? Budge up for me, love?” John wriggled out from under him and carefully picked him up and laid him gently on the plush carpet before the fire. Sherlock was lying spread out like an erotic buffet. He knelt next to him, enjoying the vision of Sherlock, long and lithe, wriggling erotically with his arms pinned behind his back.
Mycroft frowned, face pinched in pain. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, running his finger behind Greg’s ear.
John let out a soft whimper when he felt the vampire’s lips linger close to the skin on his neck. Over the months Sherlock had bitten him in numerous places on his body, and each spot offered John a different experience of mixing pleasure and pain. The vampire seemed intent on cataloging them all, and John was happy to let him. But his neck….that seemed to enthrall both of them.
Greg smiled and leaned up to kiss him. “I will” kiss “be home tonight. By 6. Promise.” Kiss. “And then you can explain to me what just happened.” He gave Mycroft a stern look.
“Of course,” Sherlock said. He reached into his collar and brought out a gold chain with a small oval pendant swinging from it. John looked at it curiously as he placed it on the desk.
The sedan carrying John and Sherlock was, as usual, sleek, black, and with very tinted windows. Sherlock was reading emails on his mobile and muttering about something about Lestrade needing to determine whether the fiancé had gone to university in Liverpool.
John inhaled softly at the first breach and reached up behind him to grasp the headboard. He looked up into Sherlock’s eyes and licked his lips, tilting his head to show off the blood trail on his neck.
“Yes, John. I do believe that this served as a sufficient introduction to sexual relations.” He turns to John and smirks.
“We will drink from each other, for starters. There is….well, there is something of a sexual component as well.”
John came. Hard. He shuddered and cried out between their bodies and then went limp beneath the vampire.
Sherlock looked up at him, and John fought the urge to step away. The man’s eyes were dark and violent. His fangs were extended and claws had grown out of his long fingers. He growled in warning. John slowly knelt in front of him, ignoring a heated argument nearby between several officers. He reached out a hand slowly and gently pried Sherlock’s hand away.
You: "Oh I don't know. Sometimes he doesn't even realize I'm gone. He could be hours." John grinned and carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair
“You have a good point,” Greg said with a chuckle. He sipped his own drink, half to hide his embarrassment. “Speaking of Sherlock, I’m glad you’re sticking around with him. He seems...good for you somehow. If you don’t mind me saying you seem to have more focus….Mycroft likes the two of you together, too.”
Sherlock groans softly and speeds up. He silently urges John on, willing him to come apart. Suddenly, John’s eyes open and he stares down into Sherlock’s. He’s so...intense. Sherlock gasps and can only continue, caught in his eyes.
“Now,” Sherlock says, voice deep and purring, “You get to choose what comes next. What do you want? Or maybe the better question is who do you want, hmm?”
“Perhaps,” Sherlock suggested, keeping his voice low and calm, “you would like to shower while I search the suite for bugs?”
Sherlock’s body hummed in approval at the sight. John’s muscular sturdy frame was a piece of art in his eyes. He possessively ran a hand up John’s right thigh, eliciting a shiver.
Shaking his head slightly, John sidled up to a nearby table containing a tasty looking hors d'oeuvres. Just as he was grabbing one from a silver platter, a voice said in his ear, “You still smell too tasty to pass up.”
“At first we were going to raise him here, but then it looked like war – World War I – would break out any moment, and she took him to America, where they remain today.”
“Ah. Annabelle is an old family friend. A friend of Mummy’s actually. I told her that you had been, well, strong armed into volunteering and that I was…concerned. She was happy to give a large – a very large – sum of money to the hospital. Though we did compensate her for half. It seemed only fair at the time.” Mycroft smiles as if this is a normal description of a business transaction.
John watched as the vampire carefully summarized him on the page. “Location of mark?” he asked, looking up at Sherlock.
“Not at all. We simply wished to convey our concern about John’s welfare. And to communicate our news, of course.”
John was cut off when Sherlock tilted his head up and kissed his mouth. Sherlock’s lips were cool to the touch, as was his tongue, which John found oddly arousing as the sinuous organ pushed at his mouth. The vampire's hands gripped his biceps strongly, keeping him in place as he focused all of his extensive energy on Doctor John Watson. John found that he enjoyed being the center of Sherlock’s attention, and he leaned back, almost relaxing into the kiss. As his cock hardened, he pushed his hips forwards, blatantly showing Sherlock the effect he had on him.
They walked into the large kitchen, where the older Holmes brother was prodding at salmon filets on an oven tray. He was bent over, and John’s mind immediately produced the image that he’d obsessed over all week, that of Mycroft Holmes arse up over Greg’s lap. He looked away before he could embarrass himself.
“Sherlock,” John said, leaning forward and placing his hands firmly on the kitchen table, “I have military training, you know. I like to know what I’m walking into.”
John winced as soft pain bloomed in the wounded area at the touch of Sherlock’s finger, gentle though it was. The vampire frowned and pulled his finger back.
Until now, Sherlock had touched him, frotted against him, given him so much pleasure….but he had never done so much as press a finger inside of John’s most private place. Sherlock watched him intently for a moment and then reached into the bedside table. He pulled out a new tube of lubricant.
Slowly, Mycroft ran his hands up the sides of Greg’s legs. He could feel the muscles, hard and strong, flex under his touch. He paused with his thumbs in the crook behind his knees. The femoral artery pulsed softly under the skin, tempting him.
Stranger: Greg's breath hitched in his throat from the sudden invasion of space along with Sherlock's hand on his wrist. "Yeah. Is it working?"
John locked eyes with Sherlock and then lowered them, slowly tilting his head to the side, offering up his silent submission. The vampire’s eyes darkened and he growled softly.
Sherlock gently kissed his lips, making his touch soft and gentle. He pulled away after a few heated moments. “Take your jacket and tie off. This will be easier that way.”
Warning for this chapter: The blood play gets a bit more intense, but it doesn't go into the horror field.
You: Sherlock swallowed. He was, for once, at a loss of how to proceed. "I-I'm not sure. But it seems that we shouldn't remain standing?"
“Uh, yes. Send it to me, I’ll take care of it,” John said, knowing that wasn’t what Greg was trying to ask. “When do you need it by?”
Maybe it’s a choice. Maybe it isn’t. But Sherlock moves,  sinuously straddling John’s waist. John looks up at him with glazed eyes, darkened by lust.
John notes the derision dripping from the words. “Erm, right?” he asks, pulling the blanket up to cover himself and turning on the bedside lamp. He blinks up at his flatmate.
“Of course!” John replied enthusiastically. He glanced at Greg and then blushed, looking away. It would take him a bit to get over having been aroused at watching Greg and Mycroft in such an intimate and erotic way.
John jumped and came out of his reverie. He cleared his throat and didn't meet the vampire's sharp eyes. “Yeah. It was…good to see him.”
“Mmm, yes, now that you mention it, I’m ravenous! I suppose it would be inappropriate to call for room
Sherlock snarled at him at the thought of the other vampire impinging on his claim over John, but the door was already closed. He looked at John, noting the pale features and slightly clammy skin. He picked up John’s discarded jacket and tie.
“Ah. Erm, thank you?” John says, rubbing the back of his head. Mycroft chuckles to himself and sits on the love seat next to him, legs crossed casually as he sips the brandy watches John. John feels like he must have fallen down the rabbit hole and bumped his head. Finally he settles on one question. “We?”
John quirked an eyebrow. “Speaking of that, well,” John paused and drank some more. “Sherlock said you’ve been a donor for years.” He blushed and looked away. “He said you – you let yourself fed on directly. But if it's been years then it's not a part of a contract. Plus you're too old, right?”
Greg followed. He paused as he passed by the sofa where their guests were situated. He leaned down and said softly, “The second door on the left upstairs. Guest bedroom that’s setup for you guys if you want.”
“You know, cousin, if I owned a pet that smelled like him, I would never let my cock leave his ass.”
“Besides, this is so much more…interesting, don’t you think?” Sherlock purrs before he leans down and claims John’s lips in a rough kiss.
“All clear!” Lestrade yelled as they approached the pair. John crawled out and approached them. The officers were handcuffing the murderer, but he noticed that Sherlock was still kneeling on the ground, head bowed, one hand on his side.
At that moment, Mycroft’s cell phone rang. The vampire actually growled at it for daring to disturb them. Still he reached for it while holding his lover down. Only four people had access to him like this, and one of them was pinned to the floor beneath him.
The Registrar opened the door to his office and turned back to them. “Oh, and do take that young man home and take care of him, Mr. Holmes. He looks a bit peaky.”
The sounds of the reception were dimmed on the second floor as Mycroft led Greg to the room prepared for them, normally a guest bedroom. Mycroft closed the door behind them as Greg looked around, mouth open. The ornate bedroom was awash in soft candle light from dozens of candles placed around the room. In the center was a large bed surrounded on all sides by gauzy cream colored fabric that hung long and heavy, bunching on the floor.
John pondered that. There were any number of medical miracles waiting to happen with that bit of knowledge. “And the other half?”
“How about starting with the rope after I take a shower? I could do with washing off the grime of today.”
Greg took a swallow. “You know, I’m glad Sherlock lets you come out for this. I was worried he’d be an arse about having you in service for the whole contract.”
Sherlock pulled John to him and urged him on. John started a brutal pace, pushing deeper and deeper until the swelling of his knot was beginning to inch its way into Sherlock’s body. Beneath him, Sherlock’s hips pushed up to meet John’s powerful thrusts.
After a couple of minutes of cuddling, Sherlock muttered, “I think it’s clear that we should explore this new kink in all of its interesting facets.”
Mycroft frowned. “"Questo non è né qui né là, cugino. Dico che è così, e la mia parola è definitiva in questa famiglia."
“Usually, I don’t allow him to wear hit shorts for a spanking, but I’ve let this go considering the…audience,” Greg said. Mycroft turned his face away from the other men in the room, his pale skin flushing. Greg ran a soothing hand over his back. “Now, why do you deserve to be punished?”
“Watch,” Sherlock said, showing both of his fangs. Suddenly, the vampire jumped. John watched, mouth agape, as Sherlock climbed effortlessly up the wall of the alley. He then moved sideways, towards the murderer, who was now cornered at the end of the alley. Lestrade and the other officers ducked behind dumpsters as the criminal opened fire, shooting at everything that moved. Several bullets flew down the alley and John ducked. He poked his head out the side to see if he could move in closer when a large black shape dropped onto the crazed killer.
John took a long sip of his drink, what was probably a very expensive bottle of wine. “Yeah. Right. Well….I mean what are friends for? And you know that Sherlock was going to be a witness and someone has to keep him in line.” John grinned.
You: John moaned at the feeling of his teeth biting into the skin. He knew that he'd have marks tomorrow, but somehow that only made it hotter. Marked by Sherlock Holmes. His ass clenched around Sherlock cock at the thought
“Hmm, well that’s a good thing, right? Today was pretty frightening. I thought your little brother was going to actually rip that prick’s head off.”
want more, and you hold me at arm’s length. Literally.” John held out his left arm in demonstration.
John took a step back automatically and bumped into the kitchen counter. Sherlock was looking down at him with an intense stare that seemed to cut right to his soul. The vampire’s eyes, bright and sharp, slowly made their way down John’s body, taking in every detail. John had never felt so naked. He glanced down, feeling vulnerable under such scrutiny. When John looked up again, the vampire was gone. John was alone.
Stranger: "I do believe that there is a need to celebrate my solving of this case." Sherlock pushed John down until he was laying with his back to the mattress and Sherlock loomed over him. "But remember, John. I am also the criminal," he winked, leaning down to nip over his neck.
“May I reminder you that you have no claim on him, Sherlock. However, if you would like to discuss this further, I may have a solution.” His eyes flick up to where John is flushing as he answers that, yes, he is single.
When nothing else was forthcoming, Sherlock turned back to the laptop. John watched him, brain working at the problem that was Sherlock Holmes. It was clear that something was happening that John couldn’t identify. Both Greg and Mycroft Holmes seemed to think their relationship to be significant, more than that of a normal donor and master. And every time Sherlock fed from, plunged his fangs into his skin, John felt…so much more. Like his life before had been flat and grey and dull.
Side note: Henry Poole & Co. is considered to be the original bespoke establishment in Savile Row. It's clients include the Royal Family and Sir Winston Churchill. According to Sherlockology.com, the Holmes brothers are wearing real bespoke suits in the series, though I don't know if they came from Henry Poole.
Stranger: Greg put almost his entire weight on Mycroft, closing his eyes and nodding carefully, trusting the other man to not kead him into anything. "Is that food? I'm starved, had to skip breakfast and lunch was a bag of crisps."
With a shudder, Sherlock let his fangs pull out. He quickly looked up at John’s face to assess his reaction. John’s eyes were closed and he was panting, but the way his hips were jerking slightly, it didn’t appear that he was in pain.
Greg glanced briefly at Mycroft with an affectionate smile. “Well thank you for coming all this way for us. I appreciate it. And I know that Mycroft does, too.”
“I’ll wait. You’re tired and I might take it to be an affront to my skills as a lover if you fall asleep now…even if it is from loss of blood.”
Stranger: "Rather unobservant, don't you think?" Sherlock chuckled, leaning up to press his lips to John's and gently nipped at his bottom one.
“According to Mycroft, plenty of vampires place registered claims on humans under contract. It’s an extra bit of protection. But this one sort of connects you to him.”
Dressed in his suit slacks and shirt from before and holding the mug in front of him like a shield, John cautiously walked down the hallway to the front sitting room. He could feel the tension the moment he stepped into the room.
Stranger: "Yes, yes. I am well aware." Sherlock calls from his bedroom, coming out ina pair of boxers. "Better?"
Mycroft places a bottle of lube on the side table next to the loveseat and sits down, one knee bent. He lazily rubs his cock, watching them rut against each other hungrily. He allows them a minute more before his own needs become too great. “You’re not sharing, brother,” he says softly.
“Sempre il politico, Mycroft. Avevo dimenticato quanto scivoloso si è.” He looked closely at Lestrade, sniffing the air. “Non solo portare il vostro marchio, ma lui sa di te.” He took another step forward but was stopped when Mycroft bodily stepped between them. “Ah. Si prende più cura del vostro animale domestico che il vostro fratellino.” He threw Sherlock a smirk. Sherlock snarled, lips pulled back to show his teeth in an animalistic motion.
Mycroft padded back to the bed and untied the ropes and gently rubbed Greg’s skin to get blood flowing again, placing soft kisses on his bare skin. After several minutes, he smacked Greg’s thigh.
Still dressed, Sherlock silently straddled John’s thighs, and John idly ran his hands over the expensive fabric of Sherlock’s slacks. The smile Sherlock gave him was feral and showed his sharp fangs extended. “If you’d like to back out, John Watson,” Sherlock said, his voice dangerously soft as he allowed the claw of one forefinger to grow long and sharp, “now would be a good time to speak up.”
Sherlock smirked. “You still exhibit human sensibilities, John. That was an important ritual and the sex, while admittedly stimulating to witness, is merely a part of it. It is a part of my culture.”
John stood up and took a deep steadying breath, and tensed. Instincts honed on the battlefield told him that someone was standing behind him. The hairs on the back of his neck stood up. He covertly readied the gun in his right hand and turned around.
“What, I let slip that I’ve gone out with men from time to time and you see an opening and take it?” John sputters somewhat indignantly.
Sherlock reaches back and pushes a couple of slick fingers into himself, breath hitching as John’s hand joins his and eases the fingers in deeper. John guides Sherlock’s hand, helping him open himself up slowly. He lies back, watching in awe as Sherlock’s face twists in pleasure.
Greg opened his mouth to respond but Mycroft said, “We do need a couple of months to make the proper arrangements. Contact certain…people.” Greg coughed and flushed when the room turned towards him. “As I said,” Mycroft continued, “we need some time to make the proper arrangements.”
You: Mycroft winced on his behalf. "We're almost home. We'll keep the place quiet for you......Of course, I could always find that blindfold we got as a gag gift a while ago." He idly played with the buttons on Greg's chirt
It was late afternoon and Greg watched Mycroft pad around the kitchen from where he sat on a bar stool at the kitchen island. He gratefully took the offered mug of tea. The vampire sat next to him, mug of tea in his own hands.
John shifted. Somehow he doubted this man liked him. Or perhaps he was always so stiff. He decided to stay silent. Mycroft pressed a button to reveal a small refrigerator in the wall.
Mycroft idly thumbed Greg’s right hand where it had been cut earlier in the day. He could feel that the wound was healing beneath the gauze bandage. “I know. But I simply can’t bear the thought of you being hurt, of….losing you.”
Sherlock chuckled, the sound reverberating in his chest where John was leaning against him. “I’ll explain when you’re awake.”
Mycroft used one of his claws to slice into his own neck. A line of blood appeared and began to dribble down his pale neck, ensuring that their witnesses saw. He tilted Greg’s head to the side and bit down on the tender skin. His fangs sank easily through Greg’s skin and glorious warm blood filled his mouth. He growled and gently guided Greg’s head down to his own neck. He felt a soft tentative lick to his neck and he let go of Greg’s head. As they drank from each other he began to move his hips, slowly at first and then fast and hard. He slipped a hand between them and grasped Greg’s cock, which had wilted a bit but was growing hard again.
“Ah. Erm. Well, ok,” John manages to say, looking down at where Sherlock’s hand is still on his leg. He can feel the heat and weight of the hand through the blanket.
Panting, Sherlock leans down, forehead resting against John’s. For one long moment, they lie there, breathing heavily, sweat on their bare skin. After everything, this moment is oddly the most intimate, and John silently runs his thumb over Sherlock’s cheek.
Growling, Sherlock sank his fangs into John’s neck and came a moment later. The dual sensation of the vampire coming in him and drinking his blood from his neck was too much for John. His climax came hard and fast. He cried out and lay there, panting.
Mycroft smiled tightly, chin lifting in defiance, his eyes narrowing. “"Questo non è anche la tua azienda fino a diventare ufficiale, se mai."
As before, Sherlock’s lips were a bit cool to the touch, as was his tongue. John felt a hand run through his hair and he shuddered, remembering how the vampire’s hands had turned into claws when fighting the murderer in the alley.
Stranger: Sherlock couldn't help but smile a little, he could tell John was aroused. He let out a sigh that boarded when something was pleasurable. "No. The boredom may be setting in."
Mycroft smiled and pushed two fingers in. He paused and held them still, relishing the feeling of Gregory’s body pulsing gently around him. If he focused, he could hear his heightened heart beat and the air filling and leaving his lungs.
John sighed. “Well, Sherlock?” John leaned his hands on the back of a chair, fingers digging into the plush back.
Mycroft inhaled sharply. He was always astounded by the beautiful way that Greg submitted to him, but now he found it nearly overwhelming. He snarled, grasped Greg’s thighs and pushed inside in one powerful thrust.
“On the contrary, that man is in my brother’s care. That makes this very much my business.” Mycroft stood casually, idly twirling his ever-present umbrella as if they were discussing the weather.
I've received a number of requests for this to continue. The truth is that I ran out of steam when life happened, and now I simply don't have any plans for it. I've tried to write more, but it goes no where.  I did have an overall plot idea, but I'm having difficulty connecting one dot to the next. I may continue to add little scenes here and there, but consider the main story done for now. Thank you for reading.
He glanced at the hall. John had been sleeping for several hours in Sherlock’s bed following the claiming. He had read that humans needed to sleep after suffering a sudden pain like the burn. Technically, it was possible for John to go into shock, but he seriously doubted it. The man had invaded Afghanistan. He could just hear the man’s rhythmic breathing and heart beat from the front sitting room. Steady. Stable. Like John. Sherlock sneered at his own train of thought.
