John’s mouth went dry. Although, yes, Sherlock was wearing trousers, he wasn’t wearing anything under his dressing gown. The same dressing gown that was part of too many of John’s fantasies over the years. Thoughts of pounding into him with while the detective was only wearing that silky garment. Or, thoughts of ripping that bloody dressing gown off of him.
Years and years of being with Sherlock, John knew how to win at games when he needed to.
“Was there really a case?”
He should step away.
This wet silicon around his cock,
?” John enunciated Sherlock’s words.
“There was!” Sherlock stated in defense.
Sherlock let out yelp full of pleasure.
“Oh, really?” John mocked.
John looked back down at the other man.
But John pulled away.
where I’m a lowly Japanese cosplayer that hardly tweets in English. Or
One more chapter left, but I'm a bit on edge on fully ending it.
“I don’t want you to leave me here alone. You want your cum extracted from me. Logically, it would be best if you take me to the bath and wash your cum out of me.” Sherlock grinned. “You know, using the shower head, maybe even your finger, scraping it all out of me?”
Did you think I was going to make things easy? Hehehe
He didn’t need a shower anyways. He was taken a shower before leaving for his date, cleaned himself thoroughly in anticipation.
“Well, it worked, I guess.” John chuckled again.
I have a few ideas on which toys for the boys to use, but does anybody have any requests? ✨
However, what surprised him more than the interruption was the state of the interrupter.
John couldn’t help his heart from skipping a beat as he felt Sherlock leaning his head onto John’s shoulder. Even after having actual sex, from the suddenness of it all, his heart and body was far from used to any intimacy.
Thank you for making it this far!
“Or else, what?” Getting between Sherlock’s widely open thighs, John leisurely stroke his inner thighs.
“I actually solved it before even stepping foot into the store.”
A few of those beautiful curls stuck to his forehead.
He felt the taller man settling himself on his lap. They simultaneously moaned into the kiss as Sherlock rutted his clothed cock against his lube slick cock. John took this as an opportunity to slide his tongue into the other man. As John lifted his hand up to run his fingers into the detective’s hair, Sherlock pulled away.
“You could’ve just asked me, you know, like everything else you do.” John felt Sherlock shake his head. Damp curls rubbing against his chest.
He saw the slight bulge between John’s legs. A bulge that was less prominent a moment before.
pillow.
“Whatever do you mean?” Sherlock slightly tensed.
John couldn’t help but lick his lips.
Sherlock couldn’t help but frown.
He now had proof on what John preferred.
Why purposely deny oneself from it?
Bigger Adult Product stores even go this far
Well. Apparently I’m making a sequel? *Shrugs*
He was hardly touching himself, but bucked forward into his own hands.
“I don’t care! I forbid you to use anything,
Head on
Reading John’s blog as well, all for research.
?” Holding himself at the base, he used his other hand to lightly stroked his sacks as well.
Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock’s arse.
“That is true.” John could hear a frown. “And, now you won’t be needing those stupid products.”
It was only to check if there were any immediate threats to John, to himself. He’s heard enough about internet stalkers turning up in real life.
“Why would you need those now!” Sherlock turned his body. Looking straight into John’s eyes. “You have me.” Sherlock stated sternly.
“I love you.” John felt his hair being pulled, forcing his lips against Sherlock's.
Sherlock’s eyes. Although slightly red from tears, as always too beautiful for John. He could forever look into them.
It always was, and at this point he didn’t care.
Body flushed.
But before any of that, next chapter will be the (I think) beautiful ending that you have all been waiting for!!
Why should Sherlock, with no experience whatsoever, be the appropriate ‘top’?
“What now?”
Leaning in, he lays a soft kiss against Sherlock’s lips.
“JOHN!!!” Sherlock screamed. The loudest sound that John has ever heard the detective make. Back arching, head slammed against the pillow, eyes rolling back.
inside of you.”
Chest hair, almost nonexistent, nothing to cover up the redness of the porcelain skin and the deliciously pink nipples.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock let out a small mewling sound full of want.
Comfortable silence that they were so used to. All they could hear was their own breathes, still panting, but slowly slowing down.
Was there something he was not seeing? Something that these writers saw but he couldn’t? Was there something that they saw in Sherlock?
“Yeah.” John sighed. “And, we need to do something about it. As a doctor, I know that it isn’t at all healthy to keep
John slightly tipped his head back, and let out a soft moan.
Please keep me motivated by leaving Kudos and Comments!
No, couldn’t be it. Then, was it something about John that they saw and he didn’t?
“John-” Sherlock tried to steady his breath. “Please. Or else-”
Hurriedly, he undid his belt and slid down his trousers, sighing a bit as he felt less restriction. Unbuttoning the first three buttons of his shirt, he also quickly took his socks off. Taking a big breath, he opened the bag he had initially set on his bed.
“Fuck me. Now.”
Trying to maintain his fierce pace, John went down to devour Sherlock’s lips. Feeling the younger one’s nails digging into his back, he growled.
John was far more experienced at being the so-called ‘top’, with the amount of females he had sexual intercourse with in the past.
Edit: So, the 'Product' that John is using here is a Tenga.
“WHAT?”
“What!? Why??” Sherlock frowned more, as he heard disappointment in the older man’s voice.
Closing his eyes, he stroked himself lightly.
Sherlock moaned out. Eyes wide open, mouth sucking in as much air as possible, drool sliding down this perfect lips.
“Oh, we can’t have that happen yet, can we?” John stated in a mocking tone.
“Spit it out.”
Swiftly, Sherlock slid one lube slick deep inside of himself.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
They fuel my will to write. :D
“Sherlock.”
Bending his knees, feet on the mattress, he opened himself. With his soft spit slick fingers, he drew circles around his opening. He felt himself buck a bit forward.
Pulling away from the kiss, John started to kiss the long flushed neck. Gently nipping at the beautiful skin.
John laughed. “You said ‘arse’.”
“Anything you don’t want?” John asked, breaking the brittle silence.
Eight.
“Helps?” John asked quickly.
"Oh, Christ, Sherlock. Do you want the bloody case or not?"
John lowered his slice as a boat blared its horn in the distance. “Sherlock?”
“No?”
“But that policeman –”
Someone was chasing, laughing, behind them. Two boys winding each other up, having fun. And one opened his bottle of pop, and threw it at the other.
Sherlock’s eyes shone.
“Morning,” John said brightly as the door opened.
“Shut up,” Sherlock tried to catch his breath. “I’m not doing it again. What were you thinking, letting them catch you like that-”
John raised his eyebrows. “What.”
“You’re sure? I mean… ready for that?”
“I’d like to, see what all the fuss is about,” Kian grinned. “Must be something about omega boys… everyone says they’re like forbidden fruit. The best sex and the best mate.”
Sherlock graduated, and John managed to hold onto his job, though there was a shaky moment when the head of John’s department found out, a few months before Sherlock was due to leave. The HOD had decided to overlook the issue, taking into account the fact Sherlock and John were already living together, and the fact that John had offered to resign. John’s offer was declined, and he continued lecturing for another couple of years, before leaving, and working alongside Sherlock.
“You need it. You’ll need it more, soon, by the look of you.” Cam drained his glass.
“There’s a few side-effects. Some serious ones, yes, for immature omegas it can affect fertility, and all sorts… We can look into it. If it’s something you’re genuinely afraid of… I don’t want you living in fear.”
He left his bag behind, and ran, for the first time, towards the sound of fighting. He didn’t have to run far.
“Went that bad, huh?” James said, sympathy in his eyes.
He picked up the instructions.
John smiled, and bent his head down again, licking and sucking as before at Sherlock’s erection, swirling his tongue over the exposed and sensitive head, pushing back the soft protective skin to spark pleasure along the shaft, even as his fingers traced, feather-light, either side of Sherlock’s entrance, tracing the shape of his pleasure, feeling Sherlock’s body open, ask for more.
He looked over at Sherlock.
“William?” the boy blinked. “You don’t pay much attention after all, do you?”
Jim smirked, and glanced at him. “Jim Moriarty. I knew Sherlock at our old school. I have to say though… Sherlock is looking rather different, these days.”
John climbed over the covers, and crawled next to Sherlock, resting his head against Sherlock’s arm. It wasn’t quite scenting. But it was as close as John could get, just yet.
“No, nothing like that… He’s just a bit… Like, Sherry came over yesterday. Brought some presents. I was looking at them, and James was just… The look in his eyes… it was like he was sad. But… longing?”
He sank to the rooftop, catching himself on a metre-box, which he leaned on heavily, his mind spinning.
Sherlock put the hanky in John’s hand. He looked exhausted, defeated, and more miserable than John had seen him. “What bothers me, more than the news that you… is that you said
“He seemed embarrassed he hadn’t suggested it, to be honest,” Sherlock put the phone on the bedside table. “Though, the last time the two of you lived together –”
When his phone had buzzed for midnight, John left his room via the window, and crept along to Sherlock’s house. The gap between their houses was the same, but John’s legs were longer now, and the leap from drainpipe to drainpipe was much easier, now. He inched along to Sherlock’s bedroom, where the curtains were open a crack. John could see a lump under the bedcovers. That had to be Sherlock.
“As long as you can stand it,” Sherlock shrugged, though he didn’t look John in the eye. “Still no signs of maturing. I might be like this forever. A genderless freak.”
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked.
“That the judge will be looking to see a little boy of twelve who needs looking after, not a pre-teen lad who took keys to his guardian’s face,” Mycroft hissed. “This is all a show, Sherlock. Play your part, or you might just see John going home with Siger, this afternoon.”
“Fuck,” John breathed, rolling his hips hard. “God, can we…”
When John went home that night, waving with a fake cheeriness at the end of the drive, Sherlock felt as though he might be sick. He waved until John disappeared from view, and then went inside.
But John didn’t care. He looked at Sherlock, still smiling at his family, talking about his course, his halls of residence, his future.
Sherlock shifted, slightly, his pelvis moving against John’s growing erection.
Sherlock glanced at him. “Is it cold out?”
“I bet.” The boy offered a hand. “I’m Thomas Yorvik, but everyone calls me Tom.”
He walked to the mess hall uneasily, but didn't get a single odd glance, for which he was pleased. He scraped something onto his tray and chose to sit on the same table as Oliver, who gave him a quick once over and small smile of gratitude before going back to his book and his food.
“It isn’t the same.”
John’s need to pull Sherlock out of his misery came to a grinding halt. “Cam.”
Hand on the door-handle.
“No,” Sherlock shook his head, holding John’s hand.
John’s finger withdrew, then returned, doubled, pushing into the student slowly, stretching his entrance, the resistance already lessening. And then John’s touch brushed over Sherlock’s prostate.
That night, as John sat reading in bed, he kept half an eye on Sherlock. The bathroom door was open a crack, and John could see the teenage omega running a hand over his chest, down to his rounding stomach. Five months. And barely showing, but that was because Sherlock was physically fit. He had months yet to blossom. He’s get rounder and his hips would splay a little, and his nipples would darken and swell, and…
“Which is one reason I never have.”
He was just hunting for a spare bag of crisps when he heard it.
“Uh-huh…” Sherlock was biting his lip as he watched the screen.
He wondered if Victor and Sherlock were fighting, or broken up, or deciding they’d give things another try.
As long as he could.
John snorted, then moved further into the room and took a seat in the chair opposite Sherlock's. Sherlock felt his mouth twitch upwards involuntarily.
“I’m sorry,” Victor said suddenly. “For what happened. With Sherlock and me. I… I was just a kid.”
Young in the face, blond, muscular and probably strong before he had been turned. There was a curved tribal tattoo on his upper arm, which dated him as a recent turn. His red eyes glowed in the dimly-lit carriage.
“Hm. No wonder Sherlock likes you. He’s in the sitting room. Would you like a cup of tea?”
Sherlock’s eyebrows went up. ‘You could get bonded, or married?’
“My officers tell me you were caught on CCTV taking…” Lestrade picked up a sheet of paper, and a look close to disappointment crossed his features for a moment. “Taking several boxes of Elastoplast, one jar of anti-inflammatory cream, a box of condoms, and another box of paracetamol. Is that right?”
He called into the Costa in the hospital before leaving, sensing his blood sugar was low – certainly nothing a hot chocolate wouldn’t cure. He sat at one of the tables with his frothy, marshmallow-covered drink, and read through his notes. Everything was fine. He was healthy, there was no protein in his pee, and he was booked in for a scan in five weeks.
John threw his hands up. “Because we were getting off in the bloody hallway!”
“Sherlock, just wait,” John said, his eyes shining, for a moment. “Just…” he reached out, and touched the soft curls at the back of Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock shrugged, then turned away from John. "War is difficult on everyone, Captain. I expect you’re not the only soldier here with nightmares. Your guilt does you no good."
“You did.”
,” Sherlock whispered.
John stirred as something cool touched his face. “Uhn...” he brushed at it, and his fingers were caught. A refreshing, cold, grasp. He dragged himself into consciousness, head swimming somewhat.
John looked like he was in shock. ‘Are you ok?’ he kept asking.
And the emotion that had been threatening, building inside him, smashed into his brain.
John shifted on the bench. “Well. I like to think I’ll be defending those who can’t defend themselves. Those who need me.”
“Oh, the weight of responsibility is crushing,” Sherlock flashed a grin. “It’s fine. And thank you, for the cake. No one’s ever made me a cake, before.”
“Well, quite.” Violet smiled. “Father…” she stopped.
They said their goodbyes, and John showed Greg out (or at least to the top of the stairs), before going back to the kitchen and starting to make himself a second breakfast.
“Careful’s boring,” Sherlock grinned, and quickly shimmied across the sill towards the guttering, so he could get back onto the roof of his own house.
“It’s a member of staff, I hope you don’t mind…”
“What is it?”
The teacher rolled his eyes and picked a toilet pass from his desk.
John tried not to look guilty – he’d been planning to row out the first chance he got, to try and find that cave, again. “If you insist, sir.”
James, exactly, but they were fucking each other. They were... comrades. Fuckbuddies. Friends, to a point. An outlet for one another, if nothing else. But not close. John certainly wouldn't put James before justice. "I'd be happy any culprit was caught. Sir."
John flashed a grin. “You can smell me, can’t you?”
“No. Yes, but…” Sherlock swallowed. “He was my boyfriend.” He felt John’s hands falter, then resume their stroking.
John swallowed. “Eurus.”
“It’s ok,” John went over and took Sherlock’s hands. “Sherlock – I know I left you. I’m sorry. I can’t imagine how that must have been – it hurt me enough, and I was the one doing it.”
“Yeah, I get it, you’ve got your priorities,” John looked at the computer screen, which told him they had five minutes before John had to get rid of his ‘patient’.
Sherlock looked at the manila file folder in Lestrade's hand as the man swivelled around in his chair to face Sherlock. Lestrade was older than Sherlock had been at the time of his first death. Greying, but tanned, and a still-remaining sense of right and wrong, despite everything he’d seen in his relatively short life.
, but he couldn’t tear himself away from the door handle.
Desire.
John put his bag down. “I don’t… know. It doesn’t matter.” He walked over. “Mycroft here?” He glanced deliberately at the umbrella in the hallway.
“Nice one,” Sholto held a hand out, and helped John off the grass. “Shit, your shorts are covered in grass stains. Your mum’s going to be pissed.”
John and Mycroft moved at the same time, both of them getting Sherlock in a hug than ended with them all tangled together in the kitchen, Sherlock still trying to explain.
“Alright,” John shouted. “You’ve made your point.”
Mid-November, Sherlock no longer sat alone in lectures. Victor was always next to him. It was very odd, at first, because John was used to the break in scents at that point, but now the space was distinctly alpha, and that was
John had expected glowers, glares, shouting even.
Again, Sherlock didn't respond, just listened to John slowly slip into sleep.
me,” Sherlock said, dragging a hand through his hair. “You’re not
John watched the other Holmeses shrug, and walk off together towards the drawing room. He sat for a moment, arms wrapped around his chest, thinking.
“Do I look cute?”
“Sherlock, you… I know you think this is an answer to how you feel, but you’re very confused, my darling,” Mrs Holmes said carefully. “You can dress in a more… masculine fashion, and not actually
Sherlock would leave, but he still had a bit of John in his system. Keeping him healthy and alive.
‘For a long time,’ Sherlock whispered. He looked at his glass of champagne, and poured it onto the grass, dropping the flute into the soft soil as an afterthought. ‘Shit.’
“Mm. Will need to consider… other factors... post-coital high…” Sherlock’s breathing was slowing. “Biological response to… something.”
John rolled onto his back, but the baby complained by delivering several vicious kicks, and he was forced back onto his side. “My head is fucked. What else could she do to me?”
There was humming and muttering at that.
“Or some
So when John sank his middle finger inside, Sherlock keened in sensation, slipping down his pillow as his body sought depth, and John gave it to him, curling his finger up, searching for the soft, sponge-like pad of feelings – that bundle of nerves that he knew existed – even as he slowly worked his finger in and out. Sherlock’s cock throbbed against his tongue.
He looked back at the table. “I don’t know. I…” he took a deep breath, which shook slightly. “I think it… I only feel safe at Mycroft’s. I want to stay there.”
Sherlock bit down, right onto John’s scent gland, making John scream until Sherlock clamped a hand over his mouth and forced them both down onto the mattress, thrusting gently back and forth, rolling his hips, emptying himself inside John, shuddering as he released his bite.
“Sherlock’s going with you tomorrow, then?” Greg asked, as casually as he could.
‘How long are you staying?’ John asked.
The younger Holmes looked up, licking his bottom lip with nerves. He was shaking, even as he shoved his hands into his pockets, and stuck his chin out, trying to look tough.
When his hand was finally freed from the metal keeping it in place, Sherlock went back to the music room.
“John –”
"You've got skinny wrists," John said.
“I haven’t ignored you.”
Oliver stood quickly, and half-ran from the confrontation, though John was sure James hadn't even noticed him.
“No,” Sherlock shook his own head.
“I’m not going anywhere, lovely.”
“No, he’s not… he’s shaking, but he’s not awake…”
He tensed as Sherlock came up behind him to spoon, arms wrapping around him gently.
John squeezed his shoulder, and let go. “I hope you learn to like yourself,” he said.
“And if he’s a beta?”
“Are they a couple?” John asked later, when Mycroft had gone out to order Christmas meat, having suddenly realised he was going to be playing host. “Mycroft and Greg?”
“Lovely,” sighed John, though his eyes were already closed. “Some tea and chocolate would be nice, too.”
“I see.” Sherlock opened the door. “Thanks. John.” And he was gone again, just like that.
"I took a moment to do some of my own investigation. Whilst you were... Let us say,
“Your... brother? Thought I might want you to know so you could turn me.” John smirked, as best he could.
, his brain nagged him.
There were arms around his arms and chest before he got to the lock.
“Yes.”
Then reached over, and took Sherlock’s hand. He held his fingers gently, in a warm grip that burning pleasantly into Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock deserved the choice.
“You took
‘No,’ Sherlock said. The thought of anyone knowing John was his weak point, and using it against him… that made him feel momentarily ill. And in reverse, of course. ‘No, wait until you’ve graduated. You need to concentrate on your training.’
“Yeah.” Molly laced her fingers together. “I know you are one, obviously, and I am as well, but no one else I know in our form is…” she looked suddenly scared. “I didn’t want to go without knowing anyone.”
“Are you… sure?”
“Siger is contesting your story, John,” Lestrade sighed.
“…alright.”
“We were never together,” John said. “It wasn’t planned, and we weren’t a couple. Just a freak thing. I was in hospital. Still in the army. Woke up, and… they didn’t know what I was. Sent me to a hospital full of alpha doctors, I didn’t have my drugs, and…” he stopped, and picked up his mug.
“You didn’t get any talking done the last time you were here, did you?”
It went
One of the machines beeped.
The therapist made a note on her pad. She had long ginger hair that fell forward over her shoulder, and she was younger than some of the other therapists John had had. Prettier, too.
Some other students laughed.
Sherlock felt as if he would have liked to argue, but Julian, Molly and John came back then, laden down with trays of edibles. Everyone settled around the large wooden table, the overhead heaters toasting the tops of their heads as they started to eat and drink. John had a sip of mulled wine and declared it tasted of paint thinners before going back to his hot chocolate. Molly made Julian spill mustard down himself as she bit into a hot dog, and Lestrade had to come to his rescue with some napkins. Mycroft talked NHS policies with John, and there was a sense of community around the small table.
James clenched his fists. “John, you don’t have to defend him. He’s given you nothing.”
John didn’t mention the army again.
Sherlock’s pale eyes flickered over John’s face. He sighed, and shifted on the mattress, and a cold scent of skin and wash-powder came from his pyjamas. “You know I’d rather be playing with you.”
“I am.” Sherlock looked at him. “I don’t think everyone thinks like that, but enough of them do to make a difference. We’re meant to save ourselves for a bond.”
“You could still present beta,” Siger pointed out. “And if you did –”
He shook his head.
Sherlock smiled, turning his head to kiss John’s palm before moving to kiss his throat again. “Happy Birthday, beautiful.” He scraped his teeth over John’s goosebumped skin.
“The autopsy said he was blown to bit on the inside.”
- and found Greg Lestrade standing on the doorstep, holding a bunch of flowers.
“No.”
He stopped using his cane, and started going to a day-school in the village.
John dug his fingernails into his jeans, twisting the material so hard it hurt. “You’re not asking, though.”
“I don’t know what I want right now,” John closed his eyes. “My stomach is a whirlpool.”
A spark shot through John. Like electricity. Like fire.
Some things were massively different. Others were only subtly. Sherlock noticed as he stood in church on Christmas Day that a couple of men glanced at him as he walked to the family pew. One, younger one, gave him a little smile.
And Sherlock orgasmed.
John opened the box, and tipped out the contents.
There was a heave and a curse from the bathroom.
John suddenly felt exhausted. "Did you want to go back to the lab?"
John woke slowly, his eyes feeling stuck together, and his mouth tasting vile. He remembered he’d been sick, and not brushed his teeth.
This whole situation was a mess, but he could at least try and do the right thing. He wasn’t remotely attracted to Sherlock, but he wanted to look after him in the way any alpha would want to take care of a child omega in need. He’s house him and help him grow up, and anything else would have to take a back-seat. There was nothing else for it. He was Sherlock’s legal guardian, now, and would remain that way until they mated. If they ever did.
, John told himself. He wanted to stroke Sherlock’s hair, or kiss him goodnight, or something… Just to say it was ok he was sleeping in his bed, it was fine… His bed was going to smell all of Sherlock. Oh, god.
“Yeah, we’ll take a walk,” John said. “Sherlock can you help me get dressed?”
John snorted. ‘It’s sick, is what it is. How can your mum tell you to get bonded so soon?’
“Mm,” Sherlock said tonelessly. “I suppose.”
“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean you had to do anything else?”
“I looked into how to speed up maturity,” Victor blushed. “There was one way that kept… cropping up.”
Alerted by the sound of the voices, Sherlock heard the shuffle of Mrs Hudson's feet, looking excited as she saw Sherlock.
“Yes.”
“What is it?” Sherlock asked. He turned his lithe body so he was facing John’s side, his body language open.
“Then get him expelled!”
“Have you hung your stocking up?” Sherlock handed John a hot chocolate, with marshmallows.
Sherlock smiled, his eyes glittering. “You have the best ideas. I’ll arrange it. You’re free all weekend?”
Sherlock sat down in Lestrade’s desk chair. ‘Do you think John wants me to adopt Birdie?’
Greg glanced at him. Then pulled over, on the double-red lines, and stopped the car. “John,” he turned to him as he pulled the handbrake on, “John, what’s wrong?”
It could already be too late…
John hummed a ‘yes’.
Sherlock hesitated, then came carefully into the room and sat beside John. “Did she write something dreadful in it?” he asked.
Name: …
"Their name no longer matters."
John shrugged off the memory, took out his keys, and let himself and the vampire into the medical bay.
He smiled, wiping his eyes. “What happens now?”
John shook his head. “I’m going to throw up.”
Mycroft took it, and rubbed his chin before answering John. “John, when you left… I don’t for one minute pretend to know how a bond feels, or how it feels when your mate leaves, but Sherlock… I have never seen him quite like it.”
“Yes…” John met his eyes, and Sherlock could see the angel’s were a dark grey-blue. “We were supposed to meet, in your true life. But we never did.”
“Everything.”
“You promise it’s not labour?” Sherlock asked. “Because have you
“I said no.”
“If you had seen the struggle between them… If John had not cut Siger with his keys, I believe that is what would have happened.”
looked happy. It was still Sherlock, and Sherlock was a boy. John shoved his phone under his pillow, and pulled the covers up to his chin.
Sherlock nodded. He didn’t have it in him to run again.
“You’ve got to try this.”
“Oh, now and then.”
John could have taken better care of him. John
She flexed her toes, and curled them around the pad of his finger.
Sherlock pinched the bridge of his nose. “John, I love you too… you can’t ask me to sit back happily and wave you off to go and be bloody well shot at!”
“That’s a start,” she smiled.
“Mm.”
It was John.
Sherlock rolled his hips a little, experimentally nudging John’s bare cock with his own covered one, but the idea of the action seemed to do things to John, who shuddered out a moan, and held Sherlock close.
Even though it made Sherlock want to sob and scream, he couldn’t bear to keep John at arm’s length. He wished so hard John would pull him close, physically close, and hold him. Sherlock hadn’t hugged anyone – not even his mother, or Mycroft – for months. He simply couldn’t stand how his body felt, and looked.
His experiment puffed up a little cloud of red dust as the solution dried.
“Sh…..” John slurred, clapping a hand onto his face, co-ordination way off, and dislodging the oxygen mask, which was quickly put back on as he threatened to nod again.
John wondered what it was about him that seemed to stop people from talking.
John wished he had an opinion on his future husband that wasn’t indifference.
, not
“Is Sherlock in some sort of trouble?”
Mycroft set his tea down. “Any photographs of Sherlock taken before last year are put away, as he has requested. I don’t think he would be at all happy to know you’ve made a request to see them.”
John rolled his eyes and shut his mouth. “It feels awful,” he said. “I can’t talk properly. It’s like there’s not enough room in my mouth.”
“It doesn’t matter,” John said, though it very much did. “I didn’t even think I wanted a baby, but then when one came along… I just wanted a bit of you, to keep. And I got all of you.”
“John. I’m not the same –”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Mycroft sneered, his hands balling into fists. “Eurus came here of her own accord, as did John.”
‘Thank you.’ Sherlock pushed himself off the fence. And looked at John with red, sad eyes. ‘I wish…’ then he stopped.
Because John was about to knot Sherlock for the first time.
John didn’t sleep well. Whether it was the excitement of the day, the mint tea at the hospital, or some other illness, he wasn’t sure. But he woke at 5am, stomach churning, and a familiar urge in his throat.
"Sherlock," came the immediate answer, and it sounded surprised and entertained. "John, Sherlock," it pointed from him to itself, and seemed somewhat amused.
Sherlock came to John’s office every day. Sometimes, it was just to study. Other times, it was to read, or to play on his phone, or to just watch John doing his lessons plans.
“Sherlock…” John breathed, thrusting his fingers in hard. “Sherlock, can I…”
“Thank you,” Mycroft ‘s back was to them at the door, but John could hear the smile in his voice. There was a pause, and John wondered if they were kissing. Then the door opened, and there were louder goodbyes, before the locks were put on, and checked. Twice.
Sherlock started googling it instantly. ‘I wonder if they want test subjects.’
But it has to be now.
“They’re nice on toast,” Sherlock said, still looking into the middle distance. He seemed to be thinking a lot. John could almost hear his brain buzzing. “Avocados. Not babies.”
Sherlock reached between them both, and touched it with a fingertip, feeling the damp heat, making John hiss through his teeth, and twitch his hips up again.
John stared. “The lecture was on the difference in blood types between immature and mature omega males.”
Mycroft stared for a moment. Then, covered his face with his hands as he went out into the hall.
John let out a breathy list of expletives, his body begging to be taken.
“He’ll appreciate that.”
“For the first time, yes,” Sherlock winced in sympathy. “After that, never again, if you… can.” He doubted it. No one gave up fresh blood. Not forever. And they had forever, now. A small smile bloomed on his lips, and he moved over towards John. “John, I know this wasn’t… but if this has to happen…”
John felt something hot and full pressing against his ribcage. “Right.”
Sherlock blinked, then smiled warmly. “Nice to see not everyone on this crime scene is an idiot.”
“Won’t we get into trouble?”
Sherlock’s mouth felt very dry. “I didn’t realise, when he moved in, that…”
“James was at school with me. Before…Before I came to London,” John said, trying to keep his voice a steady warning – warning Sherlock not to tell. Don’t tell.
“What if the alpha doctor is bonded?” an alpha student asked. “Wouldn’t they be ok?”
‘There’s a pill in development in Geneva,’ Mr Thorne said by means of a welcome back. ‘If they can get it right, it’ll stop omegas having their, er, time.’ He blushed.
“You think that’ll stop them?”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock huffed, crossing his arms.
Sherlock sat on the ground, beside the bike sheds, cigarette in his mouth, making no attempt to wipe the tears that were coming.
And rang.
But John was squaring his shoulders, and he knew John was about to either tell the truth, or throw a punch, and Sherlock didn’t know which he’d prefer.
“Do what?”
“Sorry. I… I just think he can’t see a good thing when it’s stood in front of him.”
“For God’s sake,” Sherlock flounced back against the sofa. “Stop parenting me! I’ve only been back twenty-four hours and you’re trying to –”
Sherlock’s brain immediately blasted the memory of Sherlock being pinned down onto the carpet in Cam’s house into his consciousness. He grimaced.
“Sherlock,” John said again. “Sherlock…. Where is my baby?”
Sherlock expected him to ask
This exchange was going to be so... clinical.
“Why?”
Mycroft glanced at Sherlock, who screamed
“John, dear,” Violet said, as if she had known him his entire life, “I’m sure you don’t want to stand and listen to this boring negotiation chit-chat. Shall I show you to Sherlock?”
"How's that?"
“No, I’m taking the boys home,” Mycroft said firmly. “It’s late.”
He pressed ‘send’, and watched the little envelope fly away on the screen.
“One. It felt… wrong.”
, John’s inner alpha snarled. John slammed the door on that thought, and went back to his lecture.
Sherlock hummed.
He held it close.
‘Come on,’ the teacher took off his goggles. ‘You can tell me, I’m a teacher.’ He glanced at one of the accompanying matrons. ‘Unless it’s private,’ he added in a low voice.
He put on a winning smile anyway, and shone it at Cam. “Thank you. I love the colours.”
“John…”
John closed his eyes. “Because you make me feel safe.”
‘Perhaps.’ Sherlock forked through his salad, looking for cheese. ‘Or perhaps he knows too much of my history.’
They stared at one another.
At last, Sherlock having to lowered him down, and put a kiss on his mouth again.
Sherlock had said to Mycroft that he might be able to tolerate dying, if only the run-up wasn’t so painful.
It wouldn’t happen again. Next time, he’d be more careful. Or just do all his shopping online.
family friend
Pressed onto John’s legs. Pushing, holding him down.
- - - END OF PART TWO - - -
“See you,” John gave James a slap on the arm, and opened the front door, ignoring the crackle of tension behind him.
… but that did not mean John would take pity on him.
John nosed at the spot he’d kissed, inhaling Sherlock’s alpha scent, and staying quiet as the scent ran through him, warming his joints and making little sparks dance over his skin. He kissed again, inhaling as he did so, his inner omega delighting in the immersion of such a close alpha.
themselves an omega to mate with, anymore. And it was a common practice, Sherlock. Baby boys were bid for – not with money, but with influence or jobs or power – and you were no different. Our parents were terrified for you, and for themselves. They were relieved when the law came into effect, because they believed you’d be able to find your own partner.’
“I remember what it’s like, being your age, and newly matured. I remember. But you mustn’t act like that. You can’t. Not everyone will behave like me. Not everyone will take care of you.” He tapped the glass of water. “I think you need a moment to yourself. You made me do that, Sherlock, you know that? What would your mother say? Your father? Your friends?”
They threaded their way through the people, towards a massively ornate fireplace that measured as tall as John. There were fewer guests around, now, and John could see an older couple speaking softly together, each holding a tumbler of something deep amber.
John looked crestfallen. “Oh… and I kissed you. Shit.”
John was shaking his head, but didn’t look like he was saying no the bath, exactly. He paced back and forth slightly before going back to the wall, as if he was trying to shake something off, or get away from it, but it wasn’t going away.
“Sherlock,” John kicked the door shut, behind him. “I’m back. They didn’t have any of that bread, I’ll have to go back out,” he kicked his shoes off and started up the stairs.
Until he was shot, flown back, mis-gendered, and taken in heat for the first ever time.
“I wouldn’t care about being fifteen,” John wiped his eyes with his free hand. “It’s just… I couldn’t. I’m sorry.”
John forced a smile. “Thanks, Mycroft. I’ll think about it.”
John pulled his dressing gown on, and took himself downstairs, for a shower.
Sherlock flew down the street and flashed a grin of teeth and anxiety as John’s scent hit his nostrils from the alleyway. Sweat. Fear. And blood.
Sherlock sat in the waiting room as a cell was cleaned up for him. One of his arms was cuffed to the chair. He glanced at the person a few seats down, giving the man a quick once-over and deciding not to make conversation.
“I do,” Sherlock said, glancing at the walls. "Sir."
“Dry gauze,” John held it up. “Take your hand off, I’ll take over.”
“Bullshit. You’re not drinking, you’re in pain as you eat, and you look like you’ve just realised you’re at death’s door. What’re you not telling me?” Greg leaned an elbow on John’s seat. “John. As a mate. What’s going on?”
John crawled from the nest he’d made on the floor, towards the door. “Sherlock?”
But John didn’t have anywhere to live, he didn’t have a flat, or enough money to stay in London on his own… Mycroft was a dead end.
“You said it,” Sherlock swallowed, wiping crumbs from his mouth. “Yesterday. I heard you.”
John sighed, and put his cup down. “I don’t know. I… I asked him to… well, I told him he pretty much has to choose between us. Victor and me. Sherlock can be part of the baby’s life, but I don’t want him to think he can half a sort of half-relationship with me. I want all of him or nothing at all. I can’t deal with the uncertainty, it’s stressing me out and I don’t need it, in my condition,” he said, primly.
“None?” Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“Girls as well as boys?”
“I think we have to,” Sherlock whispered, looking up at John, his hand still on the alpha’s cock.
“What’s what?” Sherlock blinked. “You knew he changed his gender on his file.”
John looked at him. “Looks like you’ve chosen, then.”
John’s chest pained, for a moment. “Do you miss living at home?”
John could barely speak. “I… Sherlock, I want
“I know I am,” John said. “But I don’t need you to fix it.”
“I’m… uh!” John leaned over again, his insides twisting.
“Want to lie down on the sofa? I find myself tired, too.”
John tilted his head up and kissed Sherlock’s jaw. “I think I’m starting to feel a little better. I feels like the end of a nightmare, finally. All that’s left is signing divorce papers. And getting the rest of my stuff from her house.”
“I’m aware,” he said coolly.
He let his thoughts slide away when he saw Sherlock. It had been over twelve hours since John put the gauze on his back, and as much as he didn’t want to upset Sherlock, the doctor in him compelled him to speak.
John told Sherlock what happened as he dried his hair, leaving out the part about arguing with Mycroft. He didn’t think it would do anything but upset Sherlock. John tossed the towel on the floor, running his hand through Sherlock’s soft, now-fuzzy hair.
“Lestrade texted me,” John said, sitting down in his armchair.
They were instantly alert. “Well?” John asked. “Where is she?”
This chapter got longer than I thought, so I split the date night into two chapters.
“She wanted to me to help her escape.”
“Yeah, actually, I’ll go get some.”
He stared at the fireplace. “Remember when I patched up your hand? Wait,” he looked at Sherlock, “how is your hand?”
John really didn’t care that his face was soaked with tears, too overwhelmed to be embarrassed, but he didn’t know what to say.
In time, Sherlock did tell him about his time away. John didn’t need to fake his reaction; he would always shed tears at the thought of how much Sherlock went through. He listened patiently when Sherlock eventually told him about his childhood, about the friends he never let go. John held him as he cried bitter tears from old wounds, assuring him his pain was real and valid, and shouldn’t be locked away.
Sherlock nodded curtly. “Yes, I agree.” He looked over at the television screen, bottom lip between his teeth. Why did he look anxious? He glanced at John from the corner of his eye, then back at the screen. “Good.”
was over; how long was he asleep?). He never reacted to embarrassment well, and falling asleep on John was a first. “I’m not tired,” he grumbled automatically, wishing he could disappear.
“Nonsense. You haven’t gotten a full night of rest in two days.”
“You never wanted to love anyone after that,” John said, not realizing the thought left his lips until he heard his own voice.
“I forgot to get a towel,” Sherlock said from inside, sounding a little embarrassed.
about Sherlock. Yet, he truly wasn’t surprised. He was angry as hell, but it added up too nicely for him to ignore. How else would an assassin just so happen to start dating him?
John woke up five hours later, held by a sleeping Sherlock, from another weird dream. Would this ever end?
“Not at all, Sherlock. Trust me.”
“Me too,” John said somberly. “I’m sick of living with her, let alone sharing a damn bed. When you--walked in--truth be told, I was secretly glad.”
“Go,” he insisted with a whine. “I don’t wanna wake up n’ find out you died of hunger.”
“Fine,” she said testily, and left him with the plastic bag, shutting the door behind her.
“Yes, in a minute,” he replied through the door.
“Is he okay?”
He was drying his hair with a towel after his shower when John came downstairs and into the bedroom.
John listened to the heart monitor beat steadily, watching Sherlock’s bare chest slowly rise and fall, but his breathing was artificial, provided through a tube, and it didn’t fill him with any of the peace watching Sherlock sleep on the sofa did. John’s then remembered Sherlock’s back, and felt even sorrier for him. He hadn’t even had a chance to recover from when he was away. John placed his hand on top of Sherlock’s, rubbing his thumb against his skin.
A few hours later, Sherlock was discharged from the hospital, and Mycroft stepped into the hospital room with a disinterested raise of his eyebrow and a bag in his right hand.
John spit in the sink and rinsed his mouth out. “Good morning,” he said once his mouth was free.
“Tell me why,” John said, telling his brain not to get nervous.
John groaned in agony, head falling back against the headboard, hips thrusting and desperately trying to rut against Sherlock.
Sherlock did, giving him a fake glare.
John blinked. “Sherlock, I’m not trying to upset you.” Sherlock opened his mouth with an indignant furrow between his brow, but John cut him off, “No, wait. I’m not making fun of you. I just want to understand you, after years of getting it wrong. About everything.”
Sherlock gasped covered his face with his hands. “God, John!” He thought he had been quiet!
he reminded himself.
Sherlock fought back a twinge of guilt in his chest.
Sherlock had never pictured himself becoming a father so associating that term with him was odd. He didn’t know if he liked it. “I don’t know. She seems to have a fine grasp on my name, which brings me back to my original point. Don’t swear in front of her.”
John took his arms from his waist and unzipped his jacket. “After all,” he said casually, “it’d be a bit hard to touch you if you’ve got all those layers on.”
Sherlock’s neck craned up, silently asking John to explore more. John kissed further down his neck, near his collarbone, and let his tongue come out and lick a wet stripe across his skin. He felt Sherlock’s small moan on his lips, and John paused when he felt his cock stir. Should he stop and calm himself down?
John. (The thought made him feel odd.) He would do small romantic gestures, such as the flowers, anonymously, and let John figure out who was behind it. When they were together, he would do more subtle gestures, like pull out John’s chair for him if they were about to sit down at a table, or help John out of his jacket, and let his touch linger just a little longer, enough to make an impact, but not enough to arouse immediate suspicion. It would be a delicate thing.  He wanted to ease John into the idea of him being a suitable partner, to not overwhelm him. He didn’t think John would catch on right away, so it would allow him to grow fond of whoever was his, for lack of a better term, secret admirer, and by the time he figured out it was Sherlock…
“Sherlock, I don’t care,” John cut in. “I don’t care about you being ‘pedestrian.’ I want to know what’s going on. Who the bloody hell cares if you’re like the rest of us after all?”
want to have sex with John, but there was only so much change he could handle in one day. They would talk about it later. John would want to do it eventually. Sherlock had to stop this train of thought right now because it didn’t take much for him to become aroused when it came to John.
. John wanted to reach out to him, but stopped himself. “Me, too,” he gave a self-deprecating laugh.
As upset as he was, John couldn’t ignore that deep voice by his ear and warm, naked body pressed against him. He couldn’t dwell on this, at least not right now. If he dreamt of Rosie again, he’d further examine it. He pushed the prickling in his gut away. “You realize you’re spooning me naked, hmm?”
“Hm?” he opened his eyes.
. “I’m not sure,” he said. “I just woke up and haven’t spoken to Sherlock yet.”
John shook his head, incredulous. “That’s an excuse, Sherlock.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “Why such harsh language, John?”
Sherlock went to her for help. He was worried. John was making him unhappy
“Can I?” Sherlock asked him.
“She should have held her tongue,” Sherlock said, as if reading his mind. “I don’t blame you for growing angry.”
He was changing the subject. John wanted to talk about Irene more, but he dropped it for now. “No, actually. I don’t think she quite knew that I was leaving her, but maybe she cried once I left. I hope not, though.”
“Since when do you care about ethics?” John laughed, too. “Especially about death! You make jokes whilst standing over corpses.”
It didn’t matter how much he cried earlier; no one knew how to twist his heart like Sherlock did. This whole thing did make John feel unlovable. He didn’t feel much better about that now. Even if she did love him, what was the use of being loved by a killer? He sat up. He couldn’t have been asleep long, because the silence of the flat told him Rosie was still napping. He stared at Sherlock’s message again, but couldn’t answer it. How could he tell Sherlock how worthless he felt? How do you tell your male best friend that you feel like an unlovable piece of shit? He was still angry, but after a quick nap, he felt ashamed. He ruined Rosie’s day.
Mycroft’s gaze turned sharp. “You do?”
“Better for you?” Lestrade retorted.
He needed to get the subject back to Culverton’s crimes. “This isn’t the only reason, or the main reason why I’m doing this. I needed to hear you confess. I needed to know I was right.”
“When?” John’s brow furrowed, puzzled.
Sherlock wanted to put his hands on John’s head and thread his fingers through his hair but he still had no idea what to do, and he still felt really sick, and he was still sweating, and his eyes burned as his vision blurred. He couldn’t take it anymore. John still didn’t tell him what how he felt about Sherlock’s confession! “John,” he almost moaned in despair, “I can’t stand this any longer. What did you think when you me say that?”
“That’s a secret,” she said easily, “but I can tell you it was in Eastern Europe.”
The next day was the three month anniversary of Mary’s death. John didn’t cry, but he felt like shit throughout the whole day. Sherlock must have remembered (of course he did), because he was especially quiet. At night, after he put Rosie to bed, John poured himself a drink. And another. And another. And another. He sat in his chair, lost inside his head, going through every event since the night Sherlock came back. Mary had been a good distraction to pull him out of depression when Sherlock was dead, but they never entirely got along. Sometimes, John felt more like she was laughing at him than with him, and when he would point this out, she would just smile some more and say he was silly. She had let John go out on cases with Sherlock, but then held it against him when he wasn’t home.
“I don’t know what to do,” his said meekly.
John chuckled a little. “I know. Go back to sleep, Sherlock.”
“John, there’s--” The words stopped dead in his throat, and it felt like an ice block fell into the pit of his stomach, his eyes widening, his limbs freezing, heart stopping.
Sherlock grinned. “I know. But, if we had tried to get together back then, perhaps we would have fallen apart.”
John turned around, too. He took off his jumper and vest, feeling the tips of his ears begin to burn, and swallowed thickly when he took off his jeans and pants. He was a little hard, and the knowledge that Sherlock was right behind him, getting naked, made a fresh wave of arousal flood south. “Can I turn around?” John asked.
John was clutching the edge of the counter and panting. She was a murderer, a lying murderer, and he had the fucking audacity to feel an ounce of sadness and guilt over never telling her the truth about cheating, and treat Sherlock like a fucking stress-relieving punching bag. John felt like he was going to gag. Sherlock once described him as having a strong moral principle. That went out the window the minute he forgave Mary on Christmas (although he’s unsure if he ever truly forgave her, in his heart of hearts). He felt himself gag and put his hand over his mouth, desperately trying to calm down.
“What do you want me to do?” Mycroft asked, just short of snapping. “As you said, it was thirty years ago. I can’t go back and coddle young Sherlock. Your desire to defend him is absurd.”
“Why is it,” he started, “that you somehow manage to keep your hair as soft as a lamb’s? You’re a grown man.” John figured a little stroke to Sherlock’s ego would do him some good right now.
Sherlock bit the inside of his cheek. "It was never easy accepting I like you."
Sherlock pressed his lips together. “I would never lie about this. You’re my favorite person.”
Sherlock scrunched up his nose. “Didn’t Mary used to sleep here?”
“He’s in distress!” Culverton lied. “I was helping him.”
She shook her head again, sighing. “I don’t even know what to say, John. I can’t believe you don’t trust me.” She shock was fading, and embers of the fire were starting to ignite behind her eyes again. “Do you really think that little of me?”
Okay, it wasn’t one of his more refined plans, and he knew John would highly disapprove of inducing self-harm, but Sherlock wasn’t going to seriously injure himself. He planned on squeezing a glass bottle until it broke and glass lodged into his hand, that was all. Nothing serious.
time. The only time it was acceptable to be out of bed before 10:30, the earliest, in Sherlock’s book, was during a case. Besides, he got Mycroft to do a favor for him and get some of his men to help John move his things so, most importantly, everyone could keep an eye on Mary (although she seemed genuinely defeated a few days ago outside of Speedy’s), and so John could be fully settled into their flat as quickly as possible.
Culverton rolled up his sleeves. “But you wanted this.”
“You don’t have much knowledge of what she was told to do by Moriarty, I’m assuming?” Sherlock asked.
John raised his eyebrows. “Why do you care?” It was a genuine question.
how Sherlock’s death almost killed me the first time, and you were willing to put me through that
“You know what the hell I mean,” John said in exasperation
“I’m officially nuts,” he shook his head. But his mind could come up with no other explanation. He stood there for a long time, thinking. If he knew this Sherlock would be okay, then he would go back. He’d want to, at least. But he didn’t even know how he got here in the first place. “I wanted a second chance,” he said under his breath, “I was certain about that. I fell asleep, and woke up here.” He took a deep breath. John didn’t know how much he believed in fate, but some greater power had to be at play for any of this to have happened at all; maybe he had to figure this out. Maybe he had to connect the dots before he could go back.
John raised a curious brow. “Since when’d you get so polite?”
Even uninterested women let him down easier in the past.
John tried not to look anxious with Sherlock’s piercing eyes on him. “I think it’s just stress. Ever since you came back, my life has been flipped upside down. Not that I don’t want you back, but it’s been hard to take everything in, I guess, and my mind is processing everything in sleep.”
John thought to himself, sitting in his chair across from Sherlock, giving him a small smile.
John was close to smacking him with the nearby hand towel, but noticed his lip twitched. “You're trying to piss me off.”
“I mean, this is a genuine apology. You’re not messing with me. I don’t remember you genuinely apologizing for anything. Well, I don’t remember much anymore, now do I?”
“What?” Sherlock asked incredulously.
It was settled. He would tell John they decided to adopt and wanted a baby to raise from birth. He would think of the details later. Right now, he had to hack into John’s blog and delete all entries and comments mentioning Mary. Sherlock sat down and did just that, and maybe felt a little spite when he deleted the sarcastic entry he had written about John’s wedding. More than anything else, however, he felt wrong doing this, but he did it anyway. He was a sociopath, wasn’t he? This was his true nature: lying, calculating, manipulative, and not at all the nice man John apparently thought he was married to. He deleted the last entry about Mary and then went about deleting her comments on various blog entries. Since he was logged in as John, he had the administrative ability to delete whatever comment he wanted, so Mary and any mention of her was removed from every comment section. She was wiped from John’s blog.
John bit his bottom lip when he looked down at the length of his cock, almost fully hard. The other Sherlock didn’t last long with their first time, only needing a small amount of physical contact to come. John knew how to bring him to bliss quickly. He ran his hands down Sherlock’s strong, creamy thighs, watching his cock twitch. John slid his hands underneath Sherlock’s knees, and lifted his legs.
John wanted to
“Done making fun of me?”
John looked down at her with a sigh. “Well, she’s asleep. Parental bonding will have to be later, I guess.”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth lifted. “True.”
“Well,” Sherlock said quietly after a long pause, “I don’t exactly disagree with you on anything. I only kept quiet because I thought you wanted to stay with her.”
He would have laughed at this thought a few months ago. He couldn’t laugh if he tried now. John ran his hands through his hair. He caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. It was dark in the sitting room (god, he’d been in a fog), but by the light of the screen, he could tell he was pale. John wiped his eyes. He was going to go to sleep tonight, and he was leaving. He could just feel it. He started crying silently again. This was the Sherlock he had all of their “firsts” with; he was really going to miss him.
“Mmm?” Sherlock hummed.
And besides, even though there had been a little too much saliva at times, John would be lying if he said he wasn’t getting a bit randy from this, especially with the warmth of Sherlock’s breath on his face.
“Are you mad?” John laughed. “You can’t even sit up, Sherlock.”
Basically, I'd be happy and in the mood to write, and then I'd see an upsetting post and close out of Google Docs for the day :P Like I said, though: I'm trying not to let it get to me so much. It's just difficult some days. But long live johnlock~~~~~~
John snorted. He loved those little ways about Sherlock, how precise and, frankly, ridiculous he was. “Well, I’m here.” John swallowed. He was supposed to make things right. He had to be braver than he was in the first timeline. He had to at least take the first step towards them becoming...well, he still didn’t know if Sherlock truly felt anything for him, but he wanted them to end up closer than they were in the other timeline. John’s hand gripped the end of the armrest for support, feeling a little anxious about saying something so simple.
He smiled bitterly. “My thoughts exactly.”
Sherlock got out of bed and went upstairs to Rosie’s (most likely temporary) room. “Hush, I’m here,” he told her, taking her out of the crib and bracing himself to change her nappy. He much preferred working with corpses to dirty nappies. Once he had her seated in her height chair downstairs, he washed his hands and got a jar of baby food that John must have bought yesterday from the fridge.
She seemed shocked by this, her face lifting, looking like she’d been slapped. Sherlock was surprised by his honesty.
Sherlock climbed into a taxi with shaking legs. He needed to think. He needed to find a way to prolong this as much as possible.
break up with
John lowered his hand and glared at him. “You experimented on
John’s face heated and he felt shame. He had never really talked about this to anyone. He hadn’t even talked about it in his letter. “Yeah,” he said woodenly. “I never--I was,” he cleared his throat, “attracted to men before you, but I never acted on it.” He hated this. “Even with my sister, dunno, it’s been hard to admit to myself.”
“Hey, now,” John murmured, and Sherlock was back in his arms, but this time, Sherlock returned the hug, hands going to John’s back, fingers clutching the fabric of his jacket. He remembered how alone and frightened he felt in the bed with Culverton, and he started shaking. If only he’d known then that John would make his desires come true…
uncomfortable? John cleared his throat. “Well. Okay.”
Sherlock took off his dressing gown, leaving him in a white cotton T-shirt and light blue pajama pants, and climbed on the bed, lying on his side. He feigned confidence, sticking his head up like a peacock. “Will you keep me waiting all day?”
Sherlock came back in with thicker, tan dressing gown around him. “Let’s get down to business, shall we?”
“You didn’t have to,” John reassured him. “Sex is about the heat of the moment, and that’s just how things went. If I didn’t come right that second, I would have exploded.” Feeling like he needed an ego boost, John lowered his voice. “You
“That’s convenient,” he said distantly, thinking of the memory. He leaned his back against the door frame of the bathroom. “Do you regret it at all, though?”
“Probably Irene.”
“I--I’m really sorry to ask this of you, believe me.” His palms were sweating. He sighed. “Sherlock, I can’t stay in that bloody flat anymore. It’s too much. Please, can I--Rosie and I--stay with you?” He braced himself.
But for a moment, John thought that he didn’t have to be the one to initiate a conversation, after all. Eleven days after he went to Baker Street, his phone vibrated. (Was that how lonely he was, that no one else texted him within that time? No use in thinking about that now.) He thought it was Sherlock, but it was an unknown number.
He grimaced. “It’s dull.”
Sherlock was surprised to see John enter his flat on the day after his birthday. Things were...better, he thought, than they were the day in the morgue, and when he was in the hospital bed. Upon discovering irrefutable proof that Culverton Smith was a killer and Sherlock wasn’t completely out of his mind, John’s faith in him seemed to have been restored, at least tentatively. They talked yesterday. More than they usually did, anyway. Sherlock was glad John let everything out about Mary and the cheating, and even trusted Sherlock enough to cry and let himself be vulnerable.
“Why are you going back to work, is it a matter of money?” Sherlock demanded. He looked at John. “Hm, no, it’s not just that. You need something to do during the day, yes?”
Sherlock felt uncomfortable.
John sighed. “Sherlock, I thought we were going to stop lying to each other.”
John did, and he put the jacket over the chair. He realized he was still in his stupid suit from the restaurant, and remembered he still had his mustache. He needed to shave that when he got the chance. “You don’t like my mustache, do you?” he asked, figuring he could go for a topic more lighthearted. “I can tell.”
Did Sherlock miscalculate? “So, did Mary find out about the scotch?” he asked.
Sorry for taking a little longer than usual to update. World events have gotten me down, you know? Sometimes, it's hard to feel motivated. And I had to draw something for a small child, so that took up time.
With the other Sherlock, there was a pained desperation to when they first really kissed, but this time, it was like they were breathing a long, deserved sigh of relief. It felt like they spent too many miserable years to be upset now. Sherlock’s arms slid up his body and wrapped around his neck, his breathing heavy already. His chest heaved against John’s.
Nothing like smut sandwiched between angst :) I can't make this nothing but fluff, ya know (as much as I love some good cotton candy fluff).
“John?”
He remembered this question, and gave an answer resembling what he said years ago.
It worked. Sherlock immediately giggled, crinkles forming around his eyes. “Shut up. Don’t act twelve.”
John thought that if he had a tail, it would be between his legs right now. Feeling sick with disappointment, John lowered his eyes. “Never mind,” he said, knowing if they talked about this more, he would only make it worse. “Just think about it,” he muttered, and walked towards the steps to his room.
. Sherlock was gazing at him softly, his expression tender.
“I don’t know why you called me, Lestrade,” Sherlock spoke rapidly, “the victim was clearly killed by her daughter’s ex-lover because she was the one who urged them to break up, so he murdered them both out of revenge. Ridiculous, you could have solved this on your own, you wasted my time.” He got all of that out in single breath.
The guard did as she was told, and the metal door shut, muffling her yells.
John’s legs felt like pudding.
to be your friend and partner in your work,” John reminded him.
.” His deep voice was scratchy and earnest. John could feel Sherlock’s voice vibrate in his chest. He wanted to lean his head against the broad chest in front of him, but didn’t allow himself to move.
“Yeah,” Lestrade sighed. “No problem, John. I hope things work out. You can come back here anytime.”
“It’s practical of you,” John encouraged him.
John teethed at his earlobe. Then, in a rush of hot breath against Sherlock's ear, he whispered, “What if you were fucking me?”
Sherlock tilted his head up and kissed him gently, emitting a soft, rumbling hum.
“And you were jealous of the Woman,” Sherlock shot back.
“It doesn’t matter. You’re besotted,” she accused with disgust, and she didn’t sound like she found any of it cute anymore. “Are you seriously going to tell me you don’t love John?”
John wrapped his arms around him, gentle warmth flowing through his veins. “Can you even breathe like that?” he asked, lazily running the sole of his foot against his calf.
Mrs. Hudson opened the refrigerator and placed a buttercream cake on the table, and then reached inside again to grab a small, baby-sized cake.
Her shoulders sagged. “You don’t love me anymore?”
John leaned forward on his elbows on the table, his voice growing quieter. “I did love you,” he said. “I don’t think I could love anyone more than him, and I’m sorry for that, but I was ready to commit myself to you and our wedding vows.” John sat back in the chair. “Until you shot him.”
“You’re full of shit,” John said affectionately.
“Close enough,” Sherlock smiled, and took her small hand and kissed the top of it. “It’s been awhile since I’ve seen you.”
Sherlock could only nod silently, clutching to John like his life depended on it. He felt John’s hand gently caress the thick curls at the back of his head.
“Goodbye, Mary,” John said coldly.
Sherlock’s ears were ringing and his nose felt wet. He must have been bleeding. All he could think of was John, how he wasn’t going to see him again, how John was probably going to feel guilty about his murder and drink himself to death. But he couldn’t save himself this time, so he couldn’t save John. His eyes stung with tears.
Sherlock nodded mutely, holding out his hand. John grabbed his hand, pulling Sherlock up slowly. Sherlock clutched the towel with his other hand, biting his lower lip. It was a little odd to John, because he had no problem waltzing around in a sheet before, and he would have been stark naked in bloody Buckingham Palace he hadn’t caught the edge of his sheet when Mycroft stomped down on it.
“Shut up,” he hissed at his mind. He closed his eyes. He needed sleep before he drove himself crazy.
he insisted, because he didn’t know what else to say.
“I truly am sorry, John,” Sherlock said sincerely, “for both your memory loss and my actions. I know now that it was wrong of me to leave you in the dark for that long. I should have told you what was going on. It’s one of my greatest regrets. I never meant to hurt you.”
“Oh, of course!” she clapped her hands together. “The poor boy must not have anything in his cabinets yet. Can you believe it? He’s back, John!” she exclaimed joyfully.
“I wanted it,” Sherlock cut him off, thumb running over John’s hand. “I’m just…” he trailed off, gaze burning into him, silently asking
Sherlock looked around the room, and backed up towards John’s chair behind him. “The carpet will be easier on your knees,” he said with a blush.
Sherlock looked shocked, face red and lips parted, blinking and swallowing wordlessly.
“What should I do with these?” he asked, referring to the rings.
“Sherlock! You’re going to squeeze the life out of me.”
Sherlock fiddled with the belt of his dressing gown, still uncertain from earlier in the evening. “Would you like me to start a fire?”
Sherlock’s eyes lowered. “I hate seeing you so unhappy, John. Think about what I said, please? You’re not a bad person. You’re a strong man, and yet you’ve broken down because you think you’ve hurt me.” His eyes came back up to meet his. “Moriarty was a bad person. Magnussen was a bad person. They felt no wrong for what they did. You are not them,” he said sincerely.
Sherlock pulled back and looked at him. “I suppose I should. Will you stay here?”
“You okay?” he whispered.
John’s nightmares were of war; Sherlock’s were of a middle-aged woman. Sherlock felt pathetic compared to him.
“I don’t like this, John,” Sherlock said slowly. “It was a dream. That’s it.”
That made Sherlock grin, and the tension was slowly melting away. This...this was really happening.
John thought,
He shook his head mutely.
“My head hurts,” Sherlock said in place of a reply.
“No selfies with Rosie?”
. There was no point in trying to act like man--or whatever the bloody fuck that meant--when he so desperately wanted nothing more than to be able to love, fully, the man who his life depended on. But it would never be.
“I love you, Sherlock,” he whispered to him.
Something didn't make sense. "If you knew I wanted you then, why did you think I didn't lo...love you until the letter?" Christ, this was excruciating.
he thought. He’d wait until Sherlock was definitively in a deep sleep, and then he would go up to his room.
he sent.
John covered up the wound. He didn’t speak of his mistakes from the other timeline. There was no point. He closed his kit and put it back in the medicine cabinet. “Come on,” he held out his hand.
Somehow, she looked even more disappointed in him, contradicting her previous scolding. “He came back from the dead and you’re not going to take advantage of that?”
Sherlock made a little sound of surprise, his hands halting on John’s sides.
not with any of his girlfriends and certainly not with Mary. It may have sounded stupid, but god, he wanted to make love to Sherlock.
John opened his eyes, and saw Sherlock’s teeth bared. He was fuming.
John kissed his red lips, unbuttoning his shirt down to his abdomen, thinking that having some buttons fastened would make him feel a little less vulnerable. John quickly kissed down his chin, neck, chest, and placed his mouth over the nipple he had been teasing, and it felt absolutely surreal.
“November of 2014.”
John was almost embarrassed that something so simple would immediately shoot heat down his abdomen and into his groin.
Still, John wondered what the hell was up with the past two dreams he had. It was almost identical to the last one, but this time, Sherlock had lifted his head from his hand, and his face was soaked with tears.
“I’m getting bored of this,” she said impatiently, apparently unimpressed by him crying on her floor. “I thought this would be more fun, but I just want to kill you.”
He wanted to ask Sherlock everything, but needed to help him first. “Stay right there!” he ordered. He rushed to the kitchen and dampened several paper towels with the sink. “Sit,” he told Sherlock from the kitchen. “Sit on the sofa. Turn sideways so I can treat you.” It was difficult to be in doctor mode when he felt like he was going to vomit into the sink. When he returned to the sitting room with the towels, Sherlock had done what he was told. He was looking down at the sofa cushion blankly.
“Look at you. You really think you can go out like that?”
John felt warm and comfortable, pressed up against Sherlock with the blankets over them. He yawned and felt Sherlock’s large hand stroke his hair. He smiled. “Sherlock Holmes, you’re a romantic.”
Sherlock blinked again. “Nothing really,” he mumbled, the words like molasses on his tongue. His nose scrunched up in annoyance. He wanted to get up and walk around to wake himself up, but he had the rare opportunity to be close to John, and he would have been an absolute fool to give that up. He felt another yawn building up in his mouth, and he resisted releasing it. His body subconsciously sought more comfort, though, and he pulled the plush quilt up to his neck and settled back into the cushions. The images on the screen began to blur. He couldn’t hold back a long, deep yawn.
John opened the door to the flat.
“Not really,” John laughed, too. “But none of that rubbish matters. It felt good, yeah?”
“John?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock sighed. He took the ice pack from John’s hand and shimmied so he was on his back, propped up against the pillows. He put the ice pack back on his head. “Better, doctor?”
just to see the look on her face, to rub it in that he knew more about her than she thought, but there was no justifiable way for him to know her real name. “Mary. If that’s your real name.”
John was
“My brain is pudding.”
John’s cock was throbbing in his jeans, and he clenched his jaw, trying not to thrust his hips into Sherlock’s.
John shook his head. “No, but it’s a start, yeah?”
Sherlock inhaled sharply, a lump in his throat.
“I really don’t know,” he said honestly, and gulped down the rest of the whiskey. He wanted more.
A few minutes passed, and John slowly turned his head on the cushion.
“I’m happy for you, but jeez,” he pinched the bridge of his nose.”
“Oh, John,” Sherlock laughed, his eyes glowing with mirth, “you call me the sweetest things.”
John wrapped his hand around Sherlock again, although it was a little more difficult this time due to the angle, but he managed. His cock gave a sympathetic throb when he felt Sherlock start to drip precome. He was so close already. He wondered how long Sherlock would last with his cock inside of him, and John groaned and thrust his hips. That would
Sherlock complied, his blush down his neck, and likely on his chest. It was then that John realized his shirt and dressing down were still on, although the latter was untied and half hanging off the sofa.
“These are from Sherlock’s hospital room,” she explained, bending down and placing the box on the floor. “You’d forgotten them, but Mycroft had them delivered. He thought you’d want them binned, Sherlock, but that John would argue keeping them is the polite thing to do.”
Thank you all so much for answering my question last chapter. The response was actually more mixed than I thought! However, the childhood given to Sherlock in TFP will not appear in this story. I do think that plot point has merit, but I think it would be too difficult to have John be aware of Sherlock's past and secret sibling, and keep that from him, you know? Plus, most of you guys said you either didn't care, or didn't want the Redbeard/Victor plot.
“She was caught while threatening an important member of the media at gunpoint: Charles Augustus Magnussen. She had knocked his assistant unconscious, but she had called security beforehand, and Ms. Morstan had no time to escape.”
John’s heart sank just thinking about it. This was the same Sherlock, wasn’t it? Was there even a point--?
John didn’t know what to say. “‘Captivating’ isn’t a term people usually associate with a body.”
“Hi,” he said stiffly, left hand opening and closing.
“Things are different now,” she said. “He knows how you feel.”
“But people sent these to you out of kindness,” John countered. “Don’t you at least want to keep Mrs. Hudson’s?” he asked.
Sherlock’s back moved up and down with a sigh. He said nothing.
“Do you
John nudged his shoulder, startling him.
“I know,” John said thickly. “I’m sorry.”
Sherlock leaned his head back and he kissed John’s jaw. “Nonsense,” he mumbled. He placed the violin and bow on the table next to the window and turned around, a small grin playing at his lips. He looked peaceful.
Then they were kissing again, neither sure who initiated it. Their lips were pressed together firmly, and the butterflies in Sherlock’s stomach fluttered happily. John’s lips moved slowly against his, sensually, and Sherlock caught on that he should move his lips, too. As soon as he started to move his lips with John’s, the kiss instantly felt better. John opened his mouth slightly to deepen the kiss. John’s mouth was so warm, and Sherlock’s lips gently closed over John’s upper lip, and a small, deep sound came from his throat when John sucked his bottom lip--softly, though, softly enough that it made Sherlock want to cry. He couldn’t contain himself and kissed John harder, the grip on his shoulders tightening.
John kissed the side of his neck. “Whatever you’re thinking that’s making your muscles tense, stop.”
Sherlock felt someone grab one of his hands, and he heard the sound of metal on metal as the key went inside the lock, and a few seconds later, his right arm dropped to his side as that handcuff was undone, and then his left arm did the same. His arms tingled and his wrists hurt. They were probably bruised, Sherlock thought as he felt the handcuffs leave his ankles, too. He was splayed out on the floor and taking deep breaths out of his mouth.
“Thanks, Greg,” John muttered.
“I don’t mean that in particular,” he clarified, “although, yeah, that was obviously a big part of it. The Culverton case aside, I still blamed you, and only you, for her actions. I was up almost all last night, Sherlock, and I can’t help but think that was her final way to get back at you--and me.” It sounded crazier once he said it aloud.
“Why?” Sherlock asked. “He told me about it, and I already told you. Culverton couldn’t stop confessing--case closed.”
“Not really,” Sherlock turned his face towards John, light eyes glassy. He blinked. “Not entirely,” he corrected. “Anyway, I can sense how tense you are. Watching a drama on the telly?”
“Sure.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and stuffed his fork into his mouth.
Sherlock got into bed, heartbeat in his ears.
John sighed. “Sorry for getting pissed earlier. It happened years ago and I told you I’d try not to be angry about stuff you did in the past.”
“Every night?” Sherlock asked from his end of the sofa.
“So,” John said casually, “what’s your brother been up to since I last remember him? Molly?”
“Fine,” Sherlock muttered, trying to stop himself from shaking.
“Open your eyes for me.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up. “Careful--”
“Hello, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson said, “how’s John?”
“Of what?”
There was a long enough pause that John was about to open the door, but Mary spoke again.
Sherlock decided to step in. “Mary, you’re only making things worse for yourself. You lied to John, and he decided that he does not want to put up with it anymore. Nothing will change that. Even if he did not have feelings for me, what you did wouldn’t change. It’s over.”
“Absolutely nothing,” John replied curtly. “I thought he was dead, for Christ’s sake.”
John was about to shrug and go about his day--after all, Sherlock and Mrs. Hudson were close and it wasn’t out of the ordinary for them to talk, but usually, Sherlock only ever went down to her flat if he wanted something. But now, from the tone of their voices, it sounded like they were discussing something serious. Was something wrong?
A part of him just wanted to wrap his hand around Sherlock’s cock and start jerking him off, but that would have been too abrupt. He kissed Sherlock’s throat, giving his sensitive skin long, wet sucks as his hands slid down to his buttocks, squeezing lightly and experimentally.
“You let me think you were dead for
“I’m sorry,” John cried over him, hot, bitter tears leaving his eyes and dropping onto Sherlock’s T-shirt. “I’m so sorry! Things were supposed to be different. Please, please don’t die on me. Not
“I’ll text you later!” he snapped, raising the eyebrows of Lestrade, John, and the forensics team in the other room. Great. He must have looked like a raving buffoon. Throat tight and cheeks burning, he stalked out of the flat, looking straight ahead, wanting to get out of there right
John placed a hand on his hip with a smirk. “You have no idea how sexy you are, do you?”
The beautiful blush drained frighteningly quickly. “Nothing.”
John’s face was flushed, too, but the tension in his shoulders was slowly melting away and he appeared to be warming up to this situation. “When’d you know?”
John felt trapped. He wasted two years of his life with Mary, and he felt further apart from Sherlock than ever. He sighed shakily. Out of all people, why did he have to fall in love with Sherlock Holmes?
Sherlock stared up at him curiously. Though he was clearly content, the damage from recent events left a (hopefully temporary) mark on Sherlock. He hoped some of Mrs. Hudson’s baked goods could make him gain a little weight back. He remembered when Mycroft feared a danger night when they thought Irene Adler had died. If Sherlock loved him, and John blamed Sherlock and said he wanted anyone but him to help (god, what a fucking prick he’d been), then… “You almost died. You almost overdosed, and you seemed perfectly fine with it. Why?”
“I’ll be out of your hair as soon as I find somewhere –”
"Okay." John carried on eating, lifting some greens and noodles so a pungent wave of scent was released.
. Of course, the safest place to put Sherlock was with Beta students.
Whether Sherlock wanted to acknowledge that or not, was something else.
John grit his teeth. “I’m not a whore, James. I’m a bonded omega, and you need to stop touching me, right now.”
A pause. “I see.”
Lucy waved her hands in reply.
“No, I…” Sherlock glanced behind him.
“Er…” Sherlock inhaled through his mouth, tasting the air quickly, but the scent of ammonia was all he got. “I…”
“Alpha hormones are the most prevalent in the human bloodstream,” John explained. “There is simply more of them, and so they have a statistical chance of condensing quicker. Everyone in this room has alpha hormones, just as we all have testosterone, but our bodies will vary. It’s simply luck of the genetic draw.” He waited for the students to make notes. Sherlock was writing something, but it didn’t look like lecture notes. He was wearing skinny jeans, and a fitted shirt open at the throat, looking utterly edible, but smelling utterly blank. If he’d given off a single note of omega, he’d’ve been buried under a pile of alphas. It was almost as though he was flaunting his unwanted-ness.
John watched, when his students were taking notes, Sherlock’s careful writing and expressionless, yet interesting – no, attractive, let’s be fair – face. The boy had a womb, but that was the only conclusive piece of evidence. John even caught himself scanning through medical journals, seeing if there had ever been an alpha male with a uterus. It wasn’t entirely though morbid interest – if Sherlock was an alpha, he’d be spared the task of finding a mate in the next few years.
A plaster lay at the crook of the student’s elbow. Sherlock reached, and tore it off quickly. Beneath it were a myriad of raised puncture scars, like braille.
“Sherlock –”
Sherlock and John looked at each other from their spying position on the landing, flat on their stomachs as they leaned over, foreheads pressed against the bannister bars.
Chapter contains discussion of John's childhood abuse, and his unresolved feelings about himself and the situation.
‘I know,’ Mr Thorne said, more gently. ‘And I know what a lot of you are thinking, when it comes to your futures, but do remember that a lot of alphas are full of hot air. They might promise a lot, but where’s the guarantee, eh?’ He looked at Sherlock over his glasses. ‘I’d hate to see you disappointed.’
‘Nervous,’ John admitted. ‘Nervous and stupid.’ He glanced around. ‘D’you want to come in the garden? It’s mental in here.’
“That wasn’t a girl, in the photo, and it wasn’t a girl in real life,” John said. “Because you’re not one. So… it wasn’t a girl, was it?”
“What do they do? The family?”
“You still are a kid,” John snorted. “Are you even seventeen?”
“I have considered it,” he said slowly. “Their goal, since Eurus, has been to get a… better alpha. Into the family. That wasn’t going to be Mycroft, so duty fell to me. Your scan has shown that I have either a beta or omega body… So I have to mate. And whomsoever I bond with… I used to think it would have to be anyone with alpha pheromones. Then, after Victor…”
They stared at each other.
“Yes, sorry,” John tapped his head. “Got a stinking headache… rough few days.”
“It doesn’t matter,” John said, chasing for a kiss, again.
He had to be at school for eleven, get his results, and confirm his place for sixth form, should he get the right grades. He couldn’t help a nervous coil in his stomach at the thought. What if he hadn’t passed? His teachers said he was clever, and he generally did well in his essays and assignments in class, but this was an exam. He’d never done a real exam before. He hadn’t particularly enjoyed doing them. They went on for too long, and seemed to be targeted at confusing the students with the apparent simplicity of the questions.
Sherlock took a breath. “I don’t know if ‘accept’ is the right word.”
“I… could,” Sherlock nodded. “I used to like swimming.”
“I want to get my jeans on, too,” Sherlock said. “I’ll just…” he bit his lip as he looked at John again, and a thrill of hope ran through John’s bones.
“Morning,” John said, hopefully in the same voice as ever. Sherlock looked wonderfully dishevelled this morning, and John could see red patches on his collar-bones. “Do you want a tea, or are you showering?”
“My mate…” Sherlock lied, pumping his fingers in and out of himself, wishing they were bigger. “My…”
“No, I want to,” Sherlock breathed, “just… go slowly. Please.”
“I get paid for the work I do with Lestrade,” Sherlock said. “And Mycroft and I both have trust funds. I didn’t plan to live with him forever. He’s insufferable.”
…so different.
John’s explanation shut down, and he stood still, the words like hot brands of shame.
“Both betas.”
Sherlock’s parents weren’t their first encounter – Mycroft caught them coming out of John’s room, Sherlock in his dressing gown, having brought no clothes with him the night before.
John nodded, bending to kiss Sherlock softly as he touched at his cock, rubbing in soft circles, touching the hard line of the shaft beneath loose skin, smearing wetness over the sore and sensitive flesh, but not going lower than he’d been asked.
Sherlock was quiet, for a moment. “I’m not sure I agree with that.”
“You’re a menace,” he whispered to the baby, who dug her head down onto his cervix in response, making him groan.
“And you’re far more noble that me to force him into one,” Victor winced.
A lifetime of lessons and expectations weighed down on him. The pressure to choose a good mate. That didn’t necessarily mean your best friend. It meant someone who could provide. Who cared. Who wanted you, wanted your children. Someone who could make sure you had opportunities. You didn’t just bond with the first alpha you saw, even if you did… like them. Even if you did want to run your hands over their bare chest, to kiss their cheeks and hug them close. Because, Sherlock told himself, those things didn’t matter. They didn’t last. And omegas shouldn’t care about them, anyway. Physical stuff… was for betas and alphas. Omegas only owned it during heats, and that was what made them so special.
“Come on, Sherlock, he’s not about to mature because of you hanging about,” Siger chuckled.
John brushed his teeth miserably, then padded back into the bedroom and got under the covers. He was too shaky and tired to care that they were damp with sweat.
“UM,” John shook off the thoughts, and tried to remember the question. “Yeah, when I was… a teenager. It stopped a bit abruptly, when I was eighteen. Because I joined the army.”
James’ face crumpled, in the keenest expression of grief John had ever seen, before he caught himself, and sniffed, trying to save face. “Right. After Christmas, then. I’ll… help you look for somewhere. If you want me to.”
“Correct.”
John stared at him, for what felt like a long time.
“I missed you,” Sherlock said. “Missed… it’s been amazing to be able to spend so much time with you of course, but… not like I… I want…” he went for another kiss.
“Of – of course. You’ve not even done your GCSEs.”
“I’ll have to do you a tour. And find you a school,” Mycroft sighed. “Perhaps that can wait until after Christmas.”
with you,” Siger said, leaning close. John could taste his breath, layers of alpha dominance forcing him to look away. “Just as I am. Sherlock is not about to waste the best years of his life with an omega who won’t wait for him. You will not go near those boys again, is that clear?”
He swallowed. Sherlock was still bundled up in the covers, as though he was keeping John at bay.
Mycroft nodded. “I’ll tell him.”
It wasn’t alright.
"You should know better than that at your age. You'll just have to hold on until the bell." Robinson went back to his laptop.
“No,” Sherlock lied. “Stop pestering me.”
John smiled. “I’ll see if he’s available.”
Except the news story didn’t make sense. He was arrested and imprisoned weeks ago.
John looked up at him. “I think I know what you’re going to say. This seems like a lot of pain for a C-Section.”
“Christ, Sherlock, put some fucking clothes on. I’m talking to John about work.”
John frowned. “What do you mean?”
And it didn’t feel weird.
“No. What would have been the point?” Victor sipped his tea. “He’d never done it before, and you were an omega. Omegas do that sort of thing, don’t they?”
“You’re an affectionate beast,” John teased, chasing Sherlock’s lips until they met in a kiss made of smiles. “We can get cuddly, tonight. Get some take-away, watch a horrible film, have sex on the sofa?”
Guilt flashed through John. ‘No,’ he said. ‘I didn’t.’
“No one else did,” John said. “Apart from Molly.”
“If I present omega, it’ll be a nice bonus, but otherwise… It doesn’t matter.”
There was a vampire on the tube.
“Don’t… say I’m… don’t reference anything associated with women,” Sherlock breathed, John’s fingers just brushing his pubic hair. “That’s… it.”
Because it wasn’t fair to Sherlock. Sherlock needed warning, what was going to happen. That, if he stayed in the house, if he came home and inhaled the pheromones John’s heat would give off, he and John would end up bonding.
“The first time we met. On the bridge.”
He pulled his homework close, looking over his student information.
“Sherlock…” Mycroft gasped.
He was afraid. He had to admit that to himself. He was scared.
His body felt relieved – pleasured and loved and wanted and sexed and filled like it should be.
…and any fight that remained in the ex-soldier melted away.
“It’s not strange,” John bowled, knocking down seven pins. “We’re just not launching into anything. Honestly, you’d think you’re trying to get me bonded off.”
“No,” Sherlock sat up, wincing as he moved his leg. “No, it’s not… I shouldn’t…”
“You’re so tight,” John breathed against Sherlock’s erection. “You’re going to feel so good on my cock. So tight, so wet… I’m going to stretch you so full you won’t be able to
Cam nodded. “No one equal to you.”
John looked at the clothes in his arms. “Are you going to stay here?”
John couldn’t bring himself to look up. He was so ashamed. Infidelity amongst alphas was rare enough, but for omegas it was unheard of. Some people even thought it physically impossible. “We had sex,” he admitted, tonelessly.
Clearly, they were getting physically close enough outside of class for Sherlock’s skin to be permeated with that scent.
“…you don’t want him to know?”
Sherlock nodded. “I will.”
John was hunched over on the sofa, curled into the cushions as though trying to make himself small and invisible. His limbs were clenched tight, knotted together. Occasionally, he would tremble violently, or spasm and cry out.
“J-Jim?” he forced out. “Wh-what are you doing here?”
, omega!” Sherlock shouted, giving John a shove.
John’s happy mood evaporated. “No,” he said.
“You alright there, love?” a drawling voice made John look up.
Mike shrugged. “You’ll just have to advertise, then. Beta-flatmate wanted. Idiots need not apply?”
But he couldn’t have, surely? Sherlock would never let him go.
It flashed red.
Mycroft found them both, wrapped in each other’s arms, fast asleep, half an hour after he left the room. He watched the two teenage boys softly breathing one another in for a moment, then left, and went to sit outside the door, lest they be disturbed.
“John,” Sherlock forced between his teeth, “d’you want me to… I’m…”
They skated a circle around the centre of the rectangular rink, their hands joined, or else face to face, Sherlock skating backwards as John beamed up into his face. The Christmas lights blurred and fogged behind John’s silhouette, giving him a halo, then glowing wings, then a sort of golden-white aura that surely couldn’t be from the Christmas lights alone…
“You saw… I’m going…”
“I… don’t know.” John tried to think.
Sherlock nodded. “Ok… I – ok…” he was still frowning as he went for the door. “How – how do you know you like someone?” he almost whispered, hand on the door handle.
“But I do want to see him. At the same time.”
Sherlock gave John a plant for his room – not flowers, he explained, as they would die. John put it on his windowsill and stared at it for a long time. Sherlock also gave John several folio editions of his favourite books from childhood – expensive gifts were a primal thing. They showed the omega that the alpha could provide for them and their future children.
Do not tell.
Although he and Sherlock had been very cute with each other (although not sexual, as John simply wasn’t up to it), and John had let Sherlock romance him to interesting degrees... he couldn’t exactly ask if he could move in with him.
“Kind enough,” the doctor raised his eyebrows. “Some people might say that’s responsibility.”
"I've had plenty of time to collect."
"I'm aware. I've read the file, however I try and save my thoroughly pleasant manners for people who are still alive. I have a very limited supply of pleasantries," Sherlock snapped. "And while we're stuck together, you can forget the formalities. I know you're not a complete idiot, so you'll be helping me with this investigation. I won't pretend that I like your presence and you don't pretend that you like mine. Professionals helping one another so they can get rid of one another. Does that sound acceptable?"
John let Sherlock hold the gauze whilst he pulled on gloves, and readied needle and thread. “Do you want me to call the police, Sherlock? Be honest.”
Sherlock shook his head. “No. Just friends who are girls.” He looked over. John could see his eyes shining in the dark. “What about you?”
Sherlock looked at her. “You… know me?”
“Well, good,” John smiled. “One’s dead, and I don’t talk to the other.”
“John! John, st – I’m – ” Sherlock’s words dissolved into cries as a small splatter of come hit the back of John’s throat, making him gag slightly as he forced it down, pulling off Sherlock’s cock to see the omega’s flushed face and chest, panting as he rode out an orgasm, his small member still twitching and leaking slightly as John stroked it, milking the last of the pale, spermless fluid from the boy’s cock.
“We heard you coughing, did it make you sick?” his mother helped him sit up.
And John was fitted with a titanium shoulder joint, and discharged from the army, aged only twenty-four.
"I still think we should discuss this," Mycroft said, sounding collected, though John could tell he was irritated beyond belief.
“John, my love, you’ll have to stop,” Sherlock choked out, pushing him away carefully. “I don’t want to… You’re too good at that.”
“She does know, dear,” Violet said, turning the washing machine on. “She knows it’s you.”
The teacher sighed. “Look, I know it’s difficult, when that sort of thing happens –”
“Oh, I’m sor-”
She’d turned into a beastly grown-up, with her own problems.
Mycroft let out a low snarl. “Sherlock is my brother. And who might you be?”
“I’m not,” Sherlock’s eyes flashed. A smell of tangerines and bonfire toffee burst at the back of John’s throat as he tasted the omega’s anger, and growing maturity. He stepped forward, mouth suddenly wet as he felt an explosion of need and want course through him. He wanted to calm this omega, to overpower him and claim him and stop him feeling this angry rejection.
John laughed softly. “The handsome detective with his dramatic coat and his short, retired army doctor--I suppose we do.”
Sherlock sighed. “The situation was more complicated than you’re presenting it. But, you weren’t grieving for her?”
“You rub off on me.”
“John?” someone touched his shoulder.
“We don’t know any babies,” he said with a furrowed brow.
John looked guilty as soon as Sherlock mentioned the shooting. “I...Yeah. Yeah, you’re right.” He rubbed his eyes. “She holds grudges. She won’t let me divorce her and go with you happily into the sunset.”
friend I ever had?”
That was true. Sherlock sighed wistfully. “Perhaps not.”
“Perhaps that’s the reason,” Sherlock’s eyes shot open, and he glared at John with venom. For a man with a critical injury lying in bed, curled up in soft blankets, he looked quite intimidating.
John put his free hand on Sherlock’s forearm. “You got the last laugh, eh? You’re here and she’s in the ground.”
John felt his shoulders sag. He couldn’t really feel angry with him. John looked at the ground and patted the empty space on the bench. John felt lifeless and was in no hurry to get up from the bench. Sherlock might as well sit with him.
“O-oh,” John stammered. “That’s her?”
An odd moment of silence ended the conversation. John wasn’t really sure if Sherlock wanted to be kissed again, and he was clearly uncomfortable with his lack of romantic and physical experience. Just talking about him ended up like this, with his face red and a big frown. John sighed, thinking about being jealous of Irene, and all the time he wasted. He remembered feeling sick when she texted Sherlock that morning they woke up here. Actually, “Sherlock?”
wanted her to let go of him. He thought of something. “Can I ask for a favor, Mary?”
“Had a good time in the loo?” his whisper dripped with mirth.
Of course both brothers were bloody drama queens.
“That you’re desperate for him,” she said, exasperated. “Keep up, Sherlock.”
John just listened to him talk, not even aware of the smile on his face. It had been awhile since he heard Sherlock rattle off a deduction like this--at least while sober. But here he was, health(ier) again and back on his game. He was animated as he talked into the phone, his free hand waving in the air and his bare toes curling in the duvet. John’s smile dropped when he felt warmth in his chest. Staring longingly at Sherlock while on his bed was a bad idea.
His Sherlock and Rosie really did get hurt, but it seemed like their memories were fading. “It’s like our dreams synced up.”
He didn’t look convinced. “But, I lied about that bottle of scotch--”
John could feel Sherlock’s long eyelashes flutter against his skin. “I don’t know how,” he admitted shamefully.
John felt determined, but a little bit ridiculous. He looked at his reflection in the mirror of the cab, staring into his own eyes. He was heading over to the flat after dropping Rosie off at her new daycare. As much as he wanted to spend time with her, he had read that some structure would be good to add to her day. Besides, it would be nice for her to be around children and not just him all of the time.
“Let’s see if you can fuck John with that now,” she kicked him there again.
Sherlock pursed his lips, and walked over to the door.
“Hi,” he said awkwardly. “Er, sorry I didn’t call or text or anything, but can I talk to you?” His heart was hammering so hard, it nauseated him. If Sherlock rejected him, he didn’t know what he would do. He would go find another flat to live in, obviously, but if Sherlock wouldn’t take him and Rosie in, then their fractured relationship would sever completely.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled. “I could have saved us a lot of pain of--”
romantic. He wanted to love Sherlock openly, but at this point, John felt like he didn’t even
“John!” she rushed over to him. “John, what happened to you?”
“It isn’t,” she confirmed.
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably in the chair. “I’m sorry.”
“You’re married to her a lot in your dreams,” Sherlock said, eyeing him. “But why would you be angry with me? Because if it weren’t for me, she would have lived?”
“Hello to you, too,” John smiled, and handed Rosie to Mrs. Hudson. He looked up and realized there were brightly colored balloons all around the sitting room and in the kitchen.
He had to swallow twice to keep his voice steady. “I know it hurts,” he whispered, caressing his hair. “I know. You need to sleep, Sherlock.”
Sherlock looked in the mirror. “Perhaps I've neglected my shaving habits, true.”
Sherlock looked at him from the corner of his eyes and nodded. He slowly leaned so his back was resting against the bench.
John is a jealous mess, and his internal screaming will only increase as the story goes on :) But don't worry, he'll get his shit together eventually.
Heeeyyyyy thank you for over 300 kudos!!!
Sherlock, and Rosie. He fixed one universe, but completely screwed up another. A hard lump formed in his throat, making it difficult to breathe.
He grimaced and closed his eyes.
? This was dangerous. This was doomed from the start. John would likely regain some of his memory, and when he did, he would certainly hate Sherlock. He would probably never forgive him for this. But John was able to forgive him for faking his death; that was much bigger, right? Sherlock thought it was. Maybe John would forgive this, too?
“Love you, too, Sherlock. Listen, I’m done with her. I think I loved her once, but she’s lied too many times for it to ever work out.” A flash of guilt went through his eyes. “And she hurt you.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes dramatically and lay down on his side, facing away from John.
Sherlock looked at him from over his shoulder. “‘We?’”
“Yeah,” John cleared his throat, “yeah, I would be.”
Heat was gathering dangerously low in his abdomen. “A good sight?” he asked against his better judgment.
Sherlock removed his hand and John whipped around and almost snarled. Did Mary have to ruin everything?!
John heard the door open and he whipped his head around. “Sherlock, no!” he ran over and grabbed his forearms. “Are you out of your bloody mind?! You can’t be out of bed yet!”
Sherlock’s heart beat quickly and he held John against his chest. John looked small in his arms. He felt unbelievably protective. He rubbed John’s back, nervous that he was doing it wrong, but John said nothing, so it must have been okay.
“You don’t even need to ask.”
“Bloody right it is.” He thought he sounded like an angry boyfriend, and damn it, he was. “Why’d you do that to him?”
“Just for everything, Sherlock,” he said sadly. “Everything since the day we met.”
Sherlock looked down, suddenly very interested in the crust from his toast left on his plate. “That she and I slept together?”
“I can stay awake.”
“You mean, there’s someone else besides Mrs. Hudson?”
Sherlock wished his knees would stop trembling. He was sure his palms were sweating.
John looked frustrated. “You’re not being very helpful.”
“Yes?”
John looked like he wanted to throttle him.
DON'T HATE ME, I'M WRITING THE HAPPY ENDING I PROMISE
As John kept stroking his skin, he began smearing soft kisses on his pale shoulder. “I haven’t said yet,” John murmured, “but you’re beautiful.” Sherlock felt himself blush, and John chuckled. “Your blush starts on your chest,” he pressed a kiss on his collarbone. “It’s gorgeous.”
Sherlock smiled a little. “Was saying girlfriends aren’t my area not enough for you?”
to me, John?” whimpered, eyes squeezing shut, hands balling into fists, clutching at his hair. “I can’t do this, so that’s why I used.” He was talking quickly again, and his chest was contracting. His breathing was so quick and sharp that it sounded like he was about to take an actual panic attack.
She was silent for a moment, then said, “Don’t bother trying to tell John. He wouldn’t believe you. He’d think you’re just jealous and trying to get him to leave me.”
John was surprised. “You have a hole in your chest, and you’re asking how I’m doing? How are
“Yes, yes, with morphine and lots of rest and hot soup,” he rolled his eyes. “You can do all of that for me.”
“So should you,” he touched Sherlock five o’clock shadow.
“Yes. We stopped it, however.”
John opened his mouth and deepened the kiss, but only slightly, keeping it gentle. Sherlock wanted to be enveloped in his arms, bury his face in his broad chest, and be held. It was a terribly pathetic thing to admit, even to himself, but that was what he wanted. It was really hitting him. There was a point when he thought John never wanted to see him again, and now John said he loved him, and was kissing him. Sherlock’s chest was heaving.
As much as John hated to ruin the mood, he cared about Sherlock’s health. “Sorry, Sherlock, but I’m going to need to check your back again.”
“When will you go get her?” he asked with his mouth full.
“I feel like this conversation can become circular and silly,” Sherlock said in a small voice.
John saw the moment the morphine clouded Sherlock’s light eyes. He tried to speak again, but his eyes slid closed against his will, and he was still again.
“John,” she said in annoyance, “we just had sex two days ago, and now you’re a prude?”
A flutter of anticipation tickled John’s stomach. This was sort of a formal way to start off a blow job, but it wasn’t unexpected for Sherlock. “Wherever you’ll be comfortable.”
Sherlock didn’t open his eyes and the movement of his hips slowed, but he nodded jerkily. But then, he covered his face with his hands. Before John could ask him again, he removed his hands. “John.” He gulped, and opened his eyes. They were shiny, and slightly frightened. It reminded John of the other Sherlock. “Please, hurry,” he mumbled, his words dripping with embarrassment. “I can’t do this much longer.”
Hey, guys. First of all, thank you all SO MUCH for getting this story to over 500 kudos!!! This is the most kudos any of my stories have had by the 9th chapter.
When Mrs. Hudson opened the door, Sherlock slithered inside right away and shut the door behind him. “Mrs. Hudson, listen. John still has no memory of the past five years, and he thinks he and I are married.” Lying to her made him feel strange.
Sherlock closed his eyes again. “Okay.” The painkillers were finally starting to do their job, and the painful pulsing in his head, face, and ribs was dying down enough that he felt like he could relax. His eyelids felt heavy even as they were closed, and the rhythmic caresses from John’s hand did make him feel safe. He fell asleep with John placing tiny, delicate kisses on the side of his jaw.
Sherlock took it, and they shuffled into his room. He sat down on the bed, and he took a moment to catch his breath. He certainly looked less greasy than before, especially his hair, but if John didn’t know better, he would have thought Sherlock was recovering from a bad virus.
Culverton looked delighted. “Oh, you’re conflicted? I like that. I like that very much,” he said softly. “You don’t actually want to die, do you? But there’s something that’s making you miserable. I’d like to know what that is.”
Sherlock sniffed loudly, looking at the letter in his hands. “You were right,” he said quietly, “I did hear you and Irene in Battersea.”
The smallest wince passed over Sherlock’s face.
John saw this as his opportunity to leave. “No, um, I should get going,” he stood up. “I’ve stayed a good bit, and I shouldn’t overstay my welcome.”
They didn’t talk for a few days after that, until John decided to bring up the Winnie the Pooh toy. It was Friday and Rose was in daycare, and John had to admit that he was a bit bored without her around and with nothing to do for the time being. He knew that it was better for her to interact with other children, but he found himself missing her. John thought about having a drink before sending the text, but stopped himself. He didn’t want to get back into old habits.
“Don’t call it that,” he whined. He spread his thighs and looked down. “I just noticed this.”
Sherlock is kind, and Irene won't leave him the bloody hell alone.
“No, look, you do, and it’ll be easier if you let yourself be that way,” John pressed on.
“You don’t have to if you don’t want to,” John said, but he was smiling.
John flashed him a grin.
“I think there’s some in the medicine cabinet in the loo,” he said. His voice was strained. “I did try to do this myself, but got frustrated and gave up.”
Sherlock did what John suggested. When he left the room, Lestrade spoke quietly.
John was so fucking tired of this bloody game. “No. Why help her if she hurt you? Why not block her number and keep receiving texts from her? I don't understand why you act like you despise her.”
She sighed. “Only because you just got back,” she muttered, and went to the kettle.
Ugggggggggggh sorry this took so long! I started writing other things and didn't know what the fuck to do with this. So this chapter goes to some dark places, but our boy will be okay in the end.
. He curled his hand so it was like a tunnel. “Fuck my hand, Sherlock,” he whispered in his ear.
Sherlock was staring down at his bare feet on the duvet. “It was a long time ago.”
“Hi,” he said gruffly, shutting the door behind him.
“You threw it first.”
John was tired of lies. “Sherlock,” he said lowly, “show me, or I’ll rip off your gown and see for myself.”
Sherlock closed the laptop, swallowing hard. He needed to shower. That would clear his head.
Mary was irritatingly perceptive. In the beginning, he hadn’t given her a reason to dislike him, and yet when she thought Sherlock wasn’t looking, she would give him cold, calculating stares. Those stares increased after John’s stag night. Memories of the stag night made Sherlock’s heart pound. He was more drunk than he ever was in his entire life, and he felt absolutely full of joy. John felt that way, too. He could tell. Perhaps it was a blessing the client came in, because Sherlock remembered thinking John looked exceptionally handsome that night, and he was starting to feel a little bit brave, and thought about reaching over and touching John’s face, just to feel his stubble, and perhaps press a quick kiss to his lips. John had grabbed his knee, and the simple touch of his hand had sent a shot of arousal to his cock. When they were falling asleep together on the stairs, Sherlock had been tempted to turn around and curl up to John’s side, too. The entire night was both glorious and tortuous.
John stared at him dubiously. “‘Private,’” he repeated.
“We’re both lightweights, so we ended up nearly asleep on the stairs after going out for two hours.”
“Hey,” he laughed lightly. “It’s your birthday today, do you know that? No, of course you don’t,” he amended.
“Why do you kill?”
John noticed Sherlock staring at him. “Curious thing, aren’t you?” He was a little smug, but the most beautiful man in the world seemed to be captivated by him. He was bloody chuffed.
Why was he interested in Mary? “Yeah, well, she can wait.”
Sherlock just nodded and smashed their lips together, screaming at his mind to go blank. He stroked the warm skin of John’s cheeks, memorizing its texture beneath his thumb pads. It wasn’t fair. He loved John more than anyone, certainly more than Mary did. Why did she get to do this? Why did he have to put up so many walls? No, he knew why. The way his knees were weak from simple snogging was why.
Sherlock sighed a little, his annoyance fading. “Then I don’t see why we should change our plans because of the Woman.”
John and Rosie moved into 221B as quickly as possible. They made John’s old bedroom her own, and started sharing a bed immediately. It was a bit of a whirlwind when they told everyone they were together (the reactions they received ranged from joy to Lestrade’s “oh god, it’s about fucking time!”), but they were glad they decided to share their news with their friends.
Sherlock looked at him, lips frozen. He swallowed the water in his mouth.
in a more innocent way than he was thinking. “No.”
“I’ll be quick,” John told him, grabbing his kit, and then removing the soggy bandage. Then, he was face to face with the bullet wound. He’d dealt with this before, but staring at the hole in Sherlock’s chest still made him wildly uneasy. This time, though, he felt even angrier at Mary. “She’ll pay for this,” he said under his breath.
There was never a wedding for the other Sherlock to experience. Was his wedding really that traumatic for Sherlock, that it broke through the pain of his childhood? Did Sherlock have a breakdown after his wedding?
“Surprisingly so.” His eyelashes fluttered when John’s strong fingers entered his mass of curls, rubbing his scalp gently. He let out a long sigh and melted like butter into John’s lap and the sofa, his spine tingling from the sensation of his skin and hair being lightly kneaded. This was good. This was better than any pill. The pain slowly started to go away in his head, and Sherlock found that his eyes were closed. He heard the front door open, but couldn’t be bothered to open his eyes.
