Tony was standing in the doorway to the bathing room. There was a towel slung low about his waist, leaving what looked like acres of toned olive skin on full display. There was no mistaking Tony’s body for a woman’s, not with that beard, or the downing of dark hair across his pecs, or that darker trail leading down from his navel to beneath the towel…
—to take advantage of that admiration for his own physical gratification? And with so much at stake, would Tony even feel himself able to say no?
“And when you’re with a partner?” There’s no trace of judgement or expectation in Iron Man’s voice. It sounds like a casual question, like this is a perfectly ordinary thing to discuss, and Steve supposes it is. Lord knows he’d heard far worse bandied about during the war. Maybe it would help to think of it like that. Just a little barracks talk between friends.
He already knew Iron Man was big—has weighed the heft of him in hand, has taken his girth into his mouth but this… This seems to operate on a different scale altogether. Iron Man is barely in him to the head and it’s already
Steve doesn’t actually hear what else some people like, but he’s pretty sure he’s one of them, because the feeling of his fingers tightening around his nipples is so acute he barely knows whether it’s pleasure or pain. Whatever it is, it goes straight to his cock, and he’s close now, he’s so damn close he can taste it—
Iron Man’s voice drops low and pensive, in a way Steve is nearly positive has to be put on. “I wonder if Mr. Stark ever realized this particular application for the repulsor technology.”
It’s two weeks ago and you and Steve are arguing. There was a fight—a real one, a good, old-fashioned hero versus villain dust-up, life or death in the New York streets. And okay, so maybe there ended up being a little more
“I know.” Iron Man’s voice is much softer, and deliberately, almost painfully kind. “I know. I still mean it. I’m not going to tell anyone. Not if you don’t want me to.”
The thought comes to Tony quite plainly then, snapping into place like a ball and chain, a relentless, dragging weight.
Shellhead’s probably busy, anyway. Steve took up an awful lot of his time this morning after all. He can’t in good conscience ask for any more just on a whim.
“Just you and me,” Iron Man echoes. “Yeah. That does sound nice. Fun.” Beneath the gentle teasing lies a wistfulness so profound that Steve knows what he’s going to say before he says it.
“Winghead?” Iron Man parrots back. The mattress shifts as he pushes you up. “Anyway, not to be crude, but I think the evidence of just how much I liked it is gonna leak right out of you and ruin these sheets if we leave it much longer. I’ll be back in a moment.”
(Non-commenting readers, you are valid and I also love you, even if I have trouble believing anyone actually reads this unless they directly interact with me about it. Your existence is entirely hypothetical to me but I still think you're a peach. Peaches. Whatever.)
That’s also what Steve cooked for him, roughly, a year later. He had visibly improved his skills, but Tony would eat anything his boyfriend made for him anyway.
Realization doesn’t so much hit as crash into him like an out-of-control automobile and for a moment the world goes white.
His face is flushed, though whether from the heat of the washcloth or something else he can’t tell. His eyes are very bright. His lips are bruised with color, red and a little bit swollen, and his hair is sticking up at odd angles. He looks thoroughly debauched.
You realize your hand is still folded in his and snatch it away. “I hid things from you! I lied to you, I— Jesus, Steve, I
Fastidiously, Tony tucks himself away. He reaches down and wipes his hand on the breast of Steve’s shirt.
Thank you, thank you, thank you to demigodscum for very energizing cheerreading, and wynnesome and cptxrogers for invaluable betawork and brainstorming help!
The first spell lasted two weeks before it vanished as suddenly as it came. Then, three months later, it was back again, and so it went, the desire coming on him every couple of months almost without warning. It never lasted longer than a few weeks, and often for much less. Steve grew pretty well-acquainted with his right hand, and learned to make the most of his leave on the rare occasions it aligned with his wayward biology.
Air punches out of him, relief and shock and a fresh, dizzying wave of need. Iron Man had said, he’d
future, it’s— Damn it, it’s everything you are. You’ve carried this around inside you for so long, felt your tissues toughen and deform around the unrelenting wound of it—you’ve shaped yourself,
The fight is challenging, but far from the most challenging they’ve faced. Rostro seems largely content to hurl insults from above, leaving his army to do most of the work. The clones possess inhuman strength and agility and a limited capacity for flight, but they don’t seem particularly intelligent.
“Maybe if you’d been a little faster,” Steve gasps out, hips canting up so he can thrust into his fist, and it’s better, a little, but not nearly enough, and Iron Man is here—why isn’t he doing anything?
He doesn’t know if it’s good. He doesn’t know how he feels about it at all—is struggling to parse anything beyond the simple fact of sensation. He only knows that Iron Man is in him and that Iron Man has stopped moving and that, at least, is wrong. Maybe even criminal and, well. He’s Captain America, isn’t he? He can’t stand for that. Experimentally, he pushes forward, sinking himself a few fractions deeper onto Iron Man’s cock. The slow skate of friction transmutes the pressure something he doesn’t have words for.
And then his eyes flicked down, and Steve hurriedly stepped right to hide himself behind the back of the divan, but he was too tall, and anyway, it was too late. Tony had seen.
Steve presses his lips together; his fingers clench where they hang at his sides. “You can’t be sure. We’ve stopped worse futures from happening before. We can still—”
He half expects Iron Man to balk, but instead, he hears the scrape of a chair followed by receding footsteps. Something on the other side of the room beeps and whirs.
“Is— Was that okay?” he asks, but he knows the answer. Of course it’s not okay; you can’t just go flinging people around in bed, especially not when you’re a supersoldier. He didn’t even think—this damn fever in his blood sapping his reason and judgement and now he’s— now he’s—
Steve kind of wants to laugh, and he kind of wants to groan, and he mostly wants to do something about the heat and pressure slowly mounting in every limb.
Another unanswerable question. Steve wants to believe that what he needs, more than anything else, is not to need anything at all, but his cock is growing harder by the minute, and Tony a bright-eyed specter in his mind, and Iron Man is here and asking what he
Rogers’ lips are parted, and he’s staring down at the place he’s taken Tony’s arm like there’s nothing else in the world to see. Like time is still frozen, or simply irrelevant.
Steve gasps aloud, even as his hands fly to his chest, kneading at his—at his— God, he can barely bring himself to even
He walks back over to the table, sitting down in his recently abandoned chair. The seat is still warm, which is nearly enough to make him want to break something, but if the worst happens, it’s better that he have whatever small concealment the table can provide.
Your eyes are growing wet. You lift your head to try and blink away the moisture, and then, when that doesn’t work, tilt your chin all the way back so your tears catch the light—let the refractions dazzle away your sight.
He takes a steadying breath and shoots a glance at his friend, wondering what to do next. He rubs his thumb against smooth metal and realizes he’s still holding Iron Man’s wrist.
. He thinks it may never stop being a fascination to him, to be holding the weight and human warmth of him, flesh and blood and bone. He sweeps his thumb down so it’s pressing against Iron Man’s wrist, feels his pulse stutter and jump as he brushes a kiss across Iron Man’s knuckles.
“No, well. Most people don’t, what with the armor. Who spends time speculating about the sexuality of a bunch of nuts and bolts?”
“Steve? Are you there? I just need to know if you’re— Come on, please.” The worry has returned to Iron Man’s voice, sharper now than before, a bleeding edge.
“I— You—” Iron Man stammers. “Jesus, Cap. Let’s just get you to the bathroom and get you cleaned off before you give me a heart attack.”
He just doesn’t have the context, that’s the thing. There’s no way he can make it all fit—everything that just happened within the bounds of everything he knows about Iron Man. He can’t make it fit, and so the explanation must lie in one of the things he
Steve notices for the first time how cool the night air is without another body to warm him. “You don’t have to.”
of the images that immediately present themselves to Steve’s mind momentarily robs him of the ability to speak.
You’d known for some time that war was coming when you realized you’d be its villain. It hurts, now, to think how naïve you were. How you stood, stranded in an age out of legend, looking out over a sea of mud and horses and tattered standards flapping in the wind, and saw another battlefield; how you watched it all unfurl before you—saw with a certainty that surpassed prophecy the fractured ranks, the friends-turned-foes, the unforgiving lines of Steve’s face as he bore down on you like you were a stranger, or less than—and still somehow let yourself believe that, just this once, there wouldn’t
broken his nose at least once, scrapper that he is. Give him a fighter’s nose then, a little flattened but still proud, and the eyes… Well. No reason not to picture those, the way Steve’s seen them so many times, brilliant and blue and
The plan is set. The trap is laid. Everything over but the waiting. You’ve never really been good at that—never learned to bear inaction gracefully. It pulls at you, stretches you thin and taut and mean, and Maya’s not much better. Every time she looks your way you can see resentment simmering in her gaze like an unwatched pot. Look away too long, and who knows what could boil over?
Impossible to speak the thought aloud, to lay all that weight on Iron Man’s shoulders. Iron Man, his first friend in the modern era. Iron Man, who has already borne so much.
He did think sometimes that maybe… It was only ever little things—off-hand comments, the occasional touch. The way he’d caught Tony looking at him, when Tony thought he wasn’t watching. Could he—
He drums his fingers against his knee, feeling dissatisfied on some base, mechanical level. Not hungry. Thirsty, maybe. He reaches for the glass of water on his nightstand, fingers brushing against a ragged edge of paper.
Does Iron Man shower? Surely he’d have to take off the armor for that but—does it even come off? All of it?
“And then there’s today. A pre-announced visit to the main construction site in the company of the pro-globalization Minister of Finance? You might as well have issued a signed invitation.”
He stands at the side of the bed, staring down at Iron Man’s note one last time, brushing his thumb over the signature that is and is not a kiss.
, he tries to say—tries to force out the lie through unwilling lips, because it’s not fine, it’s the least fine thing in the world, but he doesn’t want Iron Man to do anything he doesn’t want to do.
It really is incredible—almost admirable, in its way, the way the man manages to block him at every pass. It’s like sitting down to a game of chess to find yourself already in check.
“I can’t see anything,” he says, almost marveling at it. The serum has improved his night vision along with the rest of his senses, made him far more sensitive to light. He can scarcely remember the last time he knew a darkness so absolute.
Rogers makes an odd, throaty sound, but when Tony glances over at him, he’s staring determinedly down at his hands.
Iron Man’s fingers are careful and far, far too slow as he knots the blindfold into place. “Not too tight?”
You’re not actually sure which of you kissed the other first. It’s a question that will haunt you in its irresolution.
Despite the hair, you don’t look anything like him. Not really. His brows are fair, his chin broad, his cheeks vital and firm. And his eyes—his eyes have never looked like that in his life, alight with the guilty panic of a hunter caught in their own trap.
But Rogers is shaking his head. “I don’t think so. The blast radius was too small. Some kind of auto-destruct, we think.”
Steve pulls his hand from Iron Man’s grasp and scrapes his fingers through his hair, hiding his face in his forearms.
“Right,” Iron Man says, though there’s a bit of a lag to it. “Yeah, I guess I— Yeah. Sorry. I know it’s not what you wanted.”
“C’mon, Shellhead,” Steve whispers, voice thick with something you don’t dare to name. “Take a chance.”
Tony adopts a sneer, flapping a dismissive hand. “Priorities skewed as ever, Rogers. I’m pretty sure the leader’s supposed to be
he hissed, and then closed the space between their mouths too, and practically set his world on fire.
He had made keys for Pepper, keys that didn't really lead anywhere, symbolic more than functional, put them in a flat, velvet-lined, jewellery box like you might use for a pair of earrings. It's in his pocket now.
At the People’s Choice Awards, where Tony and Steve had somehow gotten a nomination for Best Fight Scene, and one of the stunt doubles for Scarlett Johansson wanted to ‘show Tony her moves,’ Holy Jesus Christ.
Steve huffed a tired breath. “No. It’s fine. Burgers sound… fine.” He grabbed his beer and drained it in three long swallows, and Tony watched the bob of his throat, mesmerized. When he put the mug down, his lips were slick and shiny in the neon lights. “Come on,” he said shortly, grabbing his jacket. “Let’s go.”
to him, once, when he was little. Start to finish. Tony had drifted off to sleep, his head in ten-year-old Bruce’s lap, and Bruce had… let him.
Arnie waves them off, and Tony slips his hand into Dteve’s. Such an ordinary pleasure — holding hands in a crowded room — but it knocks in right in the gut.
wanted to lick at the head, suck it feel kntl his mouth— “How long, exactly, is that supposed to take?”
He likes this quite a lot more than he’s letting on, and that’s what lets Tony smile up at him. “Arnie’s a good guy. He’ll think we’re sweet. Young love, all that, he’s a big sap.”
So Tony did the reasonable thing anyone did if they were hot and horny and filthy rich, and had just been shot down by the lo— by the only person they had ever— by the person they wanted to be around all the—
“Why the hell did you follow me,” he asks, and regrets it immediately. Hates the shake in his voice, wants to put on his gauntlets and repulsor himself in his own fucking face.
“Yeah,” Tony says. Steve-who-is-not is still touching his shoulder. “Tony?” he asks again. His voice is soft, full of worry. His voice isn’t real. None of this is real. The concern, the care, the desire.
Steve, who is familiar with it, who knows where the bread box is in the kitchen, who layers Swiss and ham, fries up bacon for BLTs, hands Tony a knife and a cutting board and stuff to make a salad. They make… lunch? — Tony glances out the plate glass windows, the sun slipping down the horizon and figures it for more like an early supper — in relative silence. Steve talks about his day at SHIELD, complains about Fury, described the new manueveur he and Widow came up with, calls up JARVIS to sketch it out in 3D, how Natasha could fall, ricochet off the shield, launch upwards, easy and comfortable in Tony’s space, and he doesn’t want to question it, he doesn’t want this to not be real. He’ll figure out what happened, he tells himself, glowing under Steve’s attention, later, later, just a little bit later.
“It’ll be okay. Let’s get you up, huh?” And then his arm is looping under Tony’s, hauling him up. Someone has cut away the straps that had pinned him to the chair. They fell to his feet.
Tony had wiped his hand on Steve’s thigh, through the crinkly golden hair, careless, smearing it with come, and asked, instead, “How many times can you…?” gesturing vaguely downwards.
Tony steps out of the hotel foyer. Steve’s still signing autographs, but he’ll be around. The car is pulling up around the corner, shiny and silver, a low-slung Ferrari LaFerrarri he gutted out and then retrofitted. It flies now. The driver’s side door swings open, empty seat beckoning. Tony steps out, into the cool California evening, the skies clear, the moon, a shining gibbous. No stars though.
Tony could feel the tremble in Steve’s thighs, could feel the tightening of those heavy balls under him. He sank down on the thick, hard ridge of Steve’s cock, and watched his eyes roll back into his head, a soft grunt escaping his mouth.
DUM-E trundles up to the chair as it slowly blackens and burns, and fires at it with an extinguisher.
“You didn’t ask Pepper to…” Steve shakes his head. They’re maybe half a foot apart now. “I feel like I’m at fault, there. I didn’t mean to…”
Tony rolled their hips together again, sliding one hand down his back, to squeeze that goddamn perfect ass. “You want to woo me, Rogers?”
“How many times can I what?” Steve blinked, glanced at his wet, red, come-smeared cock, and then, “Oh.” His eyes were very wide. “I… A few times.”
Tony broke off and Steve said, “Maybe not,” in that quiet, even voice. “Maybe I don’t know what makes you happy.”
“Yeah. I’m forty-one.” Tony scrubbed his hands through his hair. “I’m not working with the DoD. Public approval’s above eighty percent, stocks are high, Pep’s in charge of the company, and even if those numbers are soft, I got nothing to lose. So what if… What if I came out, now, finally. Project, let’s say, three months from today. Show me what would happen.”
Tony is in the lab, in fact, and half-naked, and a little sweaty, and there’s afternoon sunlight flooding into the room and— god. This is why Steve believes in the Devil.
“Tony, I don’t hate you!” Steve exclaimed, spoon clattering back into the bowl, splashing Chunky-Monkey-Choco-Banana-flavoured milk onto the newspaper.
A charity ball, is what the thing turns out to be — Capes Against Cancer. Tony protests the name: misrepresentative nomenclature is to be railed against at all times, and Thor is the only Avenger who wears a cape, for - haha - for god’s sake, but both Pepper and Steve override him. Apparently, it’s the spirit of the thing: capes are synonymous with superheroes, and no one will listen to Tony when he insists Iron Man is
“How late do you think we can be to the party?” Tony asks, lightly tamping down the edge of Steve’s collar. His voice has dropped a little, and his pants feel tight.
That the arguments against repealing DADT are the same arguments I heard segregationists use back in my day?!”
, yes,” he hisses, when their cocks slide together, in Steve’s fist, slick and hot, “God, god, just fuck me open on your cock, fill me up, I need it, Stevie, baby, I need it,” and Steve whispers, “Yeah, then take it take it,” and ruts agaisnt Tony’s body, fucks that beautiful dick into the groove of his hip, dripping with precome, his hands scattering bruises like fairy dust, mouths slotting together desperately.
At an Atlantean christening ceremony for some kid eleventh in line for the throne, where Namor’s half-octopus cousin kept bringing Tony these fizzy little drinks, and Tony could have
“Eleven points, at least,” she’s saying, but Tony’s caught the first faint strains of violin from the other end of the ballroom.
Tony shuts his eyes. When he opens them, he knows, there will be nothing to see. He can feel heat on his body now, real heat. He’s waking up. Something wet trails down his nose. There’s an awful catch in his throat. He whispers, in his head, “It wasn’t real, was it? It was all just in my head.”
So Tony drained a flute of champagne he snagged from a circulating server and walked back to Amanda.
taller than him? — and he must have felt it, because he looked down. His eyes were really an astonishing shade of blue. “Tony,” Wayne murmured, and then he was excusing himself from the rest of his guests. They were in an alcove off a corridor away from the ballroom. It was quieter here, hushed, velvet drapes soaking up the sounds of the party. “Hey, there,” he said softly. “You okay, kid?”
“Well, you should definitely try the local dishes. Get yourself a pizza. Or maybe some Italian sausage.” Tony teased and expected Steve to blush furiously and say ‘Tony’ in a stern voice.
Steve let the smaller man go and opened the sketchbook again. He showed Tony all of his old drawings; of Bucky, Peggy, beautiful sceneries he found while traveling Europe with the Commandos. He told him the stories behind each one of them with a fond smile on his face. He could finally remember his past without the feeling of asearing need to go back. Tony nodded, asked questions and let him take his time while his voice stuttered throughout some of his stories.
The air still smells faintly of sex so you go to crack open a window. You’re operating largely on instinct—see a problem, provide a solution. The bed is behind you. You don’t want to look at the bed.
Iron Man’s hand releases his balls to swat him lightly on the ass. “That’s about three more syllables than you should be able to manage right now. Go back to playing with your tits, leave me to—”
“I’m sure they tried,” Rogers says, apparently unconcerned. “I doubt even Nick Fury himself could bug you if you didn’t want to be bugged, Tony.” Something has gone softer in his eyes as he looks at Tony, and he’s still. Fucking.
Steve curled further in on himself, feeling horribly exposed. What he wouldn’t give for his uniform, for his shield, for a well-ordered mind and a disciplined body. Probably whatever drug his captors had used had some sort of… lingering side effects. Probably it wasn’t his fault. But none of that mattered, because any minute now Tony was going to come out here and see— And Christ, what he’d think… what he’d
“There are some things we need to talk about,” Rogers says. “Face to face. I saw an opportunity and I took it. We…” His mouth pulls briefly. “We probably don’t have many of those left.”
And Steve—no, Rogers, always, only Rogers now—grabbed him by the arm, held him back from the only certainty he had left. At least, that’s how it felt at the time. He understands, now, that Rogers was trying to keep him from another kind of fall. He can admit that, if only to himself. Rogers was right to stop him.
In a library in Buenos Aires, a young woman types out a cover letter on one of the public computers. The man next to her is watching porn.
Slowly, he refolds the note, tucking it safely away in his nightstand drawer before he turns around and walks out the door to start his day.
“I just thought it would be nice,” he says, amending with a wince at the bloodlessness of ‘nice,’ “fun. Making time together, without all the… complications. You know. Figured we could show each other a good time. Just you and me.”
“It’s fine,” Steve says, testing the words out and finding they’re true. “I… appreciate the concern, but I’m… managing.”
Steve flushes, and slows his hand, but doesn’t stop. He won’t be ashamed of this. All he was doing was taking the edge off; it wasn’t like it counted—
his traitor brain supplies—the way he would smile at the sight of Steve, just like he did when Steve saw him—was it two mornings ago?
always be like this. It’s only that the wound is so fresh, and the knowledge of your own guilt still so sharp in your mind. You’ve a lifetime’s experience learning about scars: the ways they heal and the ways they don’t. This will get easier, with time.
Steve rakes a hand through his hair and pulls, hard, balanced on a knife’s edge of incredulity and frustration. “Yeah, because pimping myself out to you would definitely be the honorable thing to do—”
It isn’t the response he was expecting. Tony blinks, tension still thrumming through him, braced against a blow that’s yet to fall.
Steve shakes his head in frustration. Doesn’t Iron Man understand that that’s precisely why he can’t say
Still, he can’t help but feel it as a loss. Another bit of him buried in the distant past. Unrecoverable.
“No, I understand. Like I said, there’s no fire. I’m happy to wait.” He pauses to let the significance of the words sink in.
He flips to a new page and glances around the room for inspiration. His eye falls on the book he’d just cast aside.
anything, Steve realized. He’d noticed it before, when he’d stood trying to listen outside the door to the bathing room. The rooms were, effectively, soundproofed.
Steve wrestles down his disappointment. “Sure,” he says. “Yeah. Okay. Thanks for… Well. All of it, really.”
He drags his lips in his fingers’ wake, up the inside of Iron Man’s thigh to the thatch of wiry hair where Iron Man’s leg meets his body.
In Bangalore, a group of teenagers lounge around the lobby of a hotel, uncaring of the leery looks of the doorman or the ever-watchful eye of the security camera.
“Winghead…” Iron Man sounds pained. But he doesn’t say anything else. Only Steve’s nickname, as if that, too, that little shared joke, that expression of fondness between them is an open-ended question.
Steve rolls his hips again, only this time he hooks a foot around Iron Man’s back and nudges him forward to meet Steve’s thrust. He and Iron Man gasp together as Iron Man slips a few more inches inside.
“We did…” Steve shrugs. “Normal things. Kissing. Things like that. But they… didn’t know about my… And it wasn’t so, um. Intense then, and anyway, they weren’t…” Steve waves a hand vaguely towards Iron Man’s suited body.
Steve turns around so he’s straddling Iron Man now. Iron Man’s got one hand on his ass, supporting him, and the other trailing heat up and down his spine.
, Steve thinks. He can feel something catch alight within him, wonder kindling to desire like a flame to dry grass.
He clamps down on the thought. There’s nothing to be gained from that sort of speculation. Especially with—and really what could be more ridiculous than sitting here fretting over
The glow has faded a little bit by the time he’s washed, toweled, and dressed. Stepping back into the bedroom, he glances at the clock. A quarter past two.
You let the doctors poke and prod and run whatever tests they can think of for another thirty-six hours, and then you check yourself out of the hospital. Technically it’s “against medical advice” but the doctors know as well as you do that there’s no real reason to keep you there. They just want a chance to study you some more. Which is nothing you don’t know how to handle; you’re used to people wanting a piece of you (although usually not so literally; strange, the hunger of this dawning world, where people come for you with scalpels in hand).
As if he has the right. As if they’re together in this, as if they’re a team, as if any hope of collaboration, of closeness between them hasn’t been burned twice over on the altar of Rogers’ unyielding fucking principle.
It’s not exactly enough to reassure him, but Steve doesn’t push. “Good. Because I’d hate it if any of this… You’re important to me, and— and I—”
Silence from the other end of the line. It stretches between them, echoing and empty and ever more glaringly
The name drops into his belly like a glowing coal. Tony had wanted to fit him for an upgrade or some new piece of gadgetry, but of course, under the circumstances it had been impossible. The very idea of standing there and submitting himself to those quick, clever hands, measuring, tweaking, touching…
“I know you.” The compassion on his face is a terrible thing to behold. He’s leaning in now, closing that carefully manufactured ground. “This is what you do when you’re scared: you push people away. You take on so much and you always think you have to do everything on your own, but I’m here to tell you, you don’t.”
Chapter is unbetaed and final edits were done on my phone, so apologies for any egregious typos or other errors. If you spot any and want to lmk, I'd be mighty obliged
he could say, only that doesn’t sound quite right and anyway, he doesn’t know which of them he’d say it to, Tony or Iron Man—he barely knows which of them is in his mind and which is beneath him, because he can feel the coolness of metal against his bobbing cock as he leans in closer, but the words he’s hearing don’t seem to belong to Iron Man at all.
He won’t, of course. It would be the worst kind of betrayal of trust, and after everything Iron Man has done for him! But the possibility is there, hanging in the air.
but you can’t let this end, not yet, because god, what it’ll mean when it ends— Maya half-turns with a glare of impatience but you’re not above begging now. “Please?”
But the chest plate—that he kept on even to sleep. Because… he can’t take it off? Surely not. Surely Iron Man would have said…
In the mansion, he barricades himself inside the bathroom in his suite. There’s a half-formed notion in his head of getting in the shower, but the heel of his hand brushes against his cock as he’s opening his pants and the sensation is so overwhelming that he sinks to his knees. All it takes is a few strokes to send him off.
Now, with Iron Man’s secrets seeming to buzz and thicken in the air, it’s starting to feel pretty darn relevant.
All motion behind him ceases. Steve’s brain catches up with his ears, and he jerks forward, away from Iron Man.
So Steve’s just… what? The warm up? The appetizer before the main course? Just tolerable enough for Tony to stick his cock into, but not even worthy of getting him off?
The mattress shifts and depresses as Iron Man climbs onto the bed, settling near Steve’s parted knees. Anticipation swells inside him until he’s well-nigh choking with it.
He grins a shark-toothed grin and snaps a photo as saliva spills out of Steve’s mouth and oozes down his chin.
“It’s Tony,” Steve repeats, louder, and he thinks he might very well prefer to have his fingernails pulled up by their roots, but, “The person I’ve been— It’s Tony.”
Tony whirls on him. “Rogers, so help me god—” He cuts himself short, feeling dangerously off-balance, and draws in a steadying breath.  “You try anything like this again and that’s it, you hear me? I
Except that it’s stopped now, hasn’t it? He’s hardly a hero, benched as he is—gathering dust, irrelevant,
“I liked it,” he says, almost reluctantly. “Liked seeing you…” He trails off. Exhales softly, a warm rush of white noise through the modulator. “I wish,” he says, and then he doesn’t say anything else.
Steve lets out a laugh of his own. He’s sitting slumped against the bathroom door with sweat beading his forehead and a painful erection, but still, Shellhead can always make him smile.
He glances across the table, and is a little glad to see he’s apparently not the only one who finds the meeting unbearable. It had been hard, at first, for him to read Iron Man—between the all-concealing armor and the voice modulator, there weren’t many signals left to follow. But as he’d gotten to know the man better, he’d learned to pick up on the little signs that indicated his mood—the little movements, the subtle shifts of tone or position. Iron Man is open as a book, to someone who knows how to read him.
Brain telling me to post or die so I chose post; thanks so much to nigmuff and SilverInStars for early cheer-reading/encouragement, and extra special thanks to the ever-wonderful wynnesome, without whom this story, and my life, would be considerably worse.
The lover’s shirt is open now, the flesh beneath bared to the camera’s probing eye. Livid scars underscore each nipple. The legacy of transformation. The woman leans in. Lowers her mouth to her lover’s chest. Kisses the marks like they’re something precious.
and so desperately inadequate that Steve wants to scream. He grits his teeth, unable to keep his back from arching, and hears the click of a bottle opening.
Steve blinks and struggles for air which, despite his heaving chest and stretched-open mouth, will no longer seem to come. Tony pats him carelessly on the head, then turns on his heel and leaves the room. The door clicks shut. After a moment, Steve hears his voice rise in greeting, though he can’t make out any of the individual words.
Steve bucks upwards at the word, his entire body from his lower back to his feet leaving the mattress.
He reaches forward for where he’s pretty sure the sink is, turns on the tap, and sticks the washcloth underneath.
He can feel his mouth moving to shape the words, and he knows them to be true, but they feel at the same time distant from him, like sparks thrown up by the fire currently consuming him, mind and body. And the more he burns, the more the emptiness inside him grows…
Before you’ve even had time to think about it you’ve launched yourself forward, crowding him, getting right up into his space. Sneering up the slope of the few startled inches between your face and his: “You want to know what’s coming?”
Tony shifts beneath him; Steve feels damp against his cheek as the jostling of Tony’s thigh presses him into the wet spot left by his own drool.
He starts at the distant sound of a buzzer, but Tony thrusts onwards, unconcerned. Still, he must have patched himself into the intercom somehow, because now he starts to speak in that loud, expansive, ‘I’m a celebrity’ tone Steve has always hated.
Left Tony alone to shoulder the burdens of his own inadequacy, the lives slipping like sand through his fingers because no matter what he did, it wasn’t enough, he could never be
To hell with it. Steve rolls his head back to give Iron Man an unimpeded view and gestures towards his lap, at the bulge clearly visible in his too-tight jeans.
The helmet next. Resolutely, Steve avoids imagining any of the details of Iron Man’s face. Don’t think about his chin—pointed or broad? About his cheeks—full? gaunt? somewhere between? About his brows, about his lips—
Steve bites his tongue, then hurries on before he can think better of it. “Listen, Shellhead, before you go— We’re… okay, right? You and me?”
You remember what it felt like, the first time you saw him after you returned from that long-ago war with the knowledge of your future like a bomb ticking away in your chest. How he opened his arms to you
Except he remembers, too, the punched-out breathlessness of betrayal fresh and raw in his chest, how Rogers took him by the arm, and looked him in the eye, and
Steve’s shoulders drop, mouth pulling in a helpless parody of physical pain. “God, Tony, I really thought—”
There’s a brief silence. “Probably not,” Iron Man says, still with that odd twist to his voice. “But my point is, I’m sure Mr. Stark would jump at the chance to, uh. Give you a hand.”
“For the insomnia,” Tony clarifies. “Anything to drink, or…?” He takes a sip from his mug. His mouth pulls to one side and he gives a little shudder as Steve watches in helpless fascination.
,” Steve says, for the pleasure of hearing Iron Man’s gasp. He’s so turned on he can barely see straight as it is. A blindfold is hardly a hardship.
So maybe he was being unfair. Sure, Tony had his problems, and sure, he was about the furthest thing from a soldier Steve had ever fought with, but he was a good fighter and a damn good teammate, and most of the time there was no one Steve would rather have at his back.
Steve changes the angle a little, and now each thrust is butting up against his prostate and everything is heat and swiftly mounting friction.
Steve makes it home, barely, and even that is through sheer force of will. He’s not sure what he’d do if someone caught sight of Captain America jerking off in an alley. The press would have a field day.
bed—yours and his. A thousand nights of memories on those sheets. Can he feel them as you do, roiling like ghosts, choking-thick upon the air?
The thing is, there should have been a moment. A decision. Even a surrender. After, you will crawl through reels of memory, the footage perfectly printed on your imperfectly-perfected brain. You will be searching for the tipping point. The moment when one body (yours or hers?) asks a question and the other (hers or yours?) answers,
So I saw Endgame and no spoilers (up here anyway, feel free to scream at me on tumblr or in the comments), but I decided it was time to get back fixing Civil War. Something manageable.
“That’s all it took,” Iron Man says, and Steve isn’t sure from his tone whether it’s meant to be a question or not. He can’t say he much appreciates it either way.
There’s a brief, strangely taut silence. Then Iron Man begins to laugh. He pulls out of Steve’s grasp, curling in on himself as the laughter goes on, far longer than seems at all warranted, a painful, wheezing chuckle that heaves in his lungs and catches in his throat.
. The thought is dizzying. He feels so crammed full of wanting it’s practically leaking through the pores of his skin. What would Tony say? Would he be embarrassed? horrified? intrigued?
He wishes to god they hadn’t waited this long. Wishes this was something they got to share, before. Before Steve was old and Tony was
“Are you— are you asking me to—” His voice sounds, rough—almost parched, but Steve knows what that means. His hips buck upwards in response and he bites down on another cry of pain as the movement shifts the angle of his finger inside him.
“If it’s the awkwardness factor,” Iron Man says, and his voice is so careful, “which is perfectly understandable, given the circumstances, I could always— I mean, I’d be happy to broach the subject with him if you—”
next time: If you think we're stopping at one orgasm you have vastly underestimated the amount of smut this story contains.
I thought you killed yourself— and now you’re telling me— Jesus.” He shoves himself to his feet, crosses the room in a few strides. In the doorway he pauses, opens his mouth as if to say something more. Then he closes it again and disappears down the door. Numbly, you track his progress down the hallway through the security cameras. As you watch, he stops in his tracks and spins ninety degrees, drawing back his fist back as if to strike the wall. He stands poised there for a heartbeat, like the personification of wrath. Then he sways forward, seeming to crumple in on himself; his upraised hand flattens itself gently against the wall.
“Anybody ever warn you about counting your chickens?” a metallic voice counters from somewhere out of Steve’s field of view.
There’s a bum standing on the sidewalk near you, come to gape at the fire. His hair is dark—dark enough to buy you time. You swap clothes with him and disappear into the night.
I wasn’t going to turn you in. You think— What, your get-out-of-jail-free card is user-locked? For your exclusive use? Because I’m just champing at the bit to lock up the rest of my ex-colleagues? Seriously, fuck you.”
Rogers has the unspeakable gall to look indignant. “Do you really think I’d have come here tonight if I didn’t?”
. To draw Arthur the way he should be—not as the feckless, battle-hungry youth of White’s imagining, but handsome, kind and noble, a true leader of men.
Steve can’t help but let out a short laugh at that. “No, no, the serum is working fine. Everything is… normal.” Give or take a few pesky details, but don’t
It’s less than a day before that, and you’re sitting in your mentor’s kitchen, drinking his shitty, home-pressed apple juice and listening to all the ways you’ve disappointed him.
Now he’s teasing you. It doesn’t make sense; nothing about this makes sense. The data is a mess, a far-flung scatter graph with no discernable pattern. Out of all the ways you predicted he might respond, none of them looked like this.
Despite the awkwardness, there’s such a warmth and total sincerity in Iron Man’s voice that it occurs to Steve for one wild moment that he could actually try it. Surely if he can tell anyone, it’s Iron Man? Iron Man would never shrink away, would never laugh at him. With him, maybe.
“This might be a good time to mention I’ve never done this before,” he says, keeping his voice casual. “But I’m a very quick learner,” he adds, not fast enough to preempt Iron Man’s little noise of his distress. Only Steve’s anchoring hand on his thigh keeps him from drawing back.
“Here’s what’s going to happen,” he says. “I’m a busy man. My time is valuable, and you waste an awful lot of it, coming here, asking for things you’re never going to get. So now, I’m going to waste some of yours.”
“All done,” Iron Man announces as more clunking footsteps announce his return. “All recording devices have been disabled, and I’ve put the room on lockdown, just to be sure. We can leave at any time, but no one can enter unless we let them.”
“You can’t tell. You can’t tell—” He doesn’t say the name, doesn’t even allow himself to think it. “—
You turn inwards, programming directly into your brain. Inject a line of code into your wetware, turn the dial on the pleasure centers up to eleven. You have just enough time to be satisfied with this practical solution to a practical problem before Maya clenches down again and you come, shatteringly.
Rogers shifts discontentedly, a frown marring the marble smoothness of his brow. “These are the biggest pieces we could salvage. This is the second time we’ve come across these things, and both times the other guys detonated them before we could get close.”
Steve raked his hands through his hair, hunching over with a little groan of frustration. What was the matter with him today? Was he really that susceptible—that, that
Which makes sense. It’s not like he’d really expected to. He’s never known Iron Man to use the kitchen except for social purposes, or to pour himself the occasional glass of water (complete with straw).
“I’ve given you as long as I can, but if I don’t pee soon, I’m gonna get a UTI. Not all of us have a genetically-engineered healing factor, you know.”
He hears Iron Man shifting behind him and then a faint, gentle warmth tracing slow circles over the skin of his back. Steve almost shudders at the comfort of it.
Normally he’s entirely for these post-battle debriefings. It’s not easy to coordinate a team of five highly-powered individuals, all of whom maintain separate lives, careers, and identities. Well, all except Steve, who has secrets enough as it is. The debriefs are valuable, if nothing else, for creating a sense of continuity and cohesion—for helping the Avengers seem less like a loose confederation of individuals and more like a unit, on and off the battlefield. Steve is a soldier. He knows the value of that.
Iron Man’s fingers flex, seemingly involuntarily, where they grasp Steve’s ass. Steve shudders and arches against him as Iron Man buries his helmeted face in Steve’s neck.
And yeah, maybe he thinks he could—maybe he’d even be stubborn enough to try it, but sooner or later, it would all fall apart. He’d never really be able to trust you—how could he?—and over time, with every compromise, every bit of himself bartered away to try and hold together your already shattered relationship, that distrust would stretch into resentment, into anger, into loathing. No matter what, this ends with him hating you.
“This isn’t a fucking pay-per-view. You want some live action to ogle, I’m sure there are plenty of cam girls out there who would be happy for your attention. FRIDAY can hook you up. FRIDAY, can you set up Mr. I Fought the Law over here with some more appropriate viewing material?”
The groan Iron Man gives at these words sounds like it was ripped out of him, but Steve is only half listening. Something awful has just occurred to him.
Rogers seems to hesitate, but when Tony looks up, his gaze is steady, face clear. Nothing to indicate a lie.
“Oh, hell,” Iron Man says. “That doesn’t sound… I’m going to call Don, okay? Just hang in there, Winghead, it’ll—”
Steve wraps both legs around Iron Man’s armored torso and rolls the pair of them over, using his newfound leverage to sink the rest of the way onto Iron Man’s cock, and there it is, the fullness he craves, Iron Man so deep inside him he can practically taste it, and Iron Man—
When he comes to, he’s lying flat on his back in the middle of 7th Avenue, Wasp and Giant Man looking down at him with expressions of concern. They’ve both returned to their natural sizes, so the battle must be over.
Tony’s hips press upwards against Steve’s mouth and Steve momentarily forgets how to breathe. He draws in a strangled gasp as Tony pulls back, but it’s only a moment’s respite before Tony is pushing in again, fucking into Steve’s mouth in little, rocking thrusts.
“Don’t—don’t what? I’m not stopping, I— You don’t mean— You don’t want me to talk, I’m just making a mess—”
Steve pops the button, unable to stifle the little moan of relief. He’s barely managed to fumble open his fly when one of Iron Man’s repulsors drags a straight line of heat and pressure from his navel to his collarbone and Steve is lifting his hips and arching into the sensation. The other gauntlet comes down to hover over his balls, and even through two layers of fabric it’s almost enough to blank out Steve’s mind.
Point is, he still has people here. People, who love him and even if they may not need him as their leader anymore, they want him there as a friend and that’s all that matters.
Ronon had nodded, smiling as Rodney trailed gently fingertips across his naked chest before slipping the digits into his mouth with a moan of pleasure. He wanted to pull the scientist to him so badly, to direct that talented mouth to his own. He would then guide Rodney gently to his nipples, which were already hardening, then further down.
She gave him one last searching look, shoulders lowering when she found no quarter nor mercy within the whiskey coloured eyes. She stepped back, never turning away from him, until she too was gone; her steps making almost no noise along the forest bed.
With one last glance up and down the street, she put the car in drive and stepped on the gas, aiming for the town car. A block away she opened the door and rolled out onto the street, scrabbling to her feet and ducking off into the alley; leaving the convertible to careen into the luxury vehicle with a spectacular crunch  of metal and glass.
Stiles barked a sharp laugh. "Well, Pinky. Tomorrow were going to throw Scotty to the proverbial wolves. I'm talking Lydia, Erica and Allison. Scotty responds better to female authority and he needs to get his head out of his ass ASAP if he wants to be part of his pack."
A local costumer had helped make the blue gingham dress with lace trim and the white blouse with puff sleeves and blue ribbon detail. There were even matching blue socks and hair ribbons.
"I agree." John nodded, already slathering the cream on his body and rubbing it in. "I didn't even think about packing sunscreen in my gear. All teams should have it. Or at least put it on before each mission."
Getting back into the library was quick and she peeled off the gloves and let them fall into a mop bucket with some bleach. The zip lock bag and its contents had already made a home in the dumpster out back. Some make up wipes taken from her aunt's bathroom took care of her face full of foundation. Rolling up the arms and legs of the tights, she slipped on the dress and scarf and  pulled off the stocking cap; stuffing it into her bag.
The wind dropped suddenly as Heather and Danny stilled beside him. Stiles gave Scott a lazy look, his voice low and promising death as he spoke. "Is my dad one of those in danger Scotty? Or is that some kind of ham handed threat your alpha put you up to?"
He'd almost expected to see a collar on the pretty young man, despite Penelope's assurance that Sub was unattached. Surely some Dom would have snapped a beautiful young thing like him by now.
"He would have if he knew about it I'm sure." Stiles tightened the straps and checked to see if he had everything. "Luckily, Lydia Martin is a book hoarder and a secret genius who delights in the rare hobby of translating obscure languages for fun."
They stayed that way as the comet dipped in the east, taking its light and leaving darkness to creep over the sky once more. He felt oddly bereft, as if he’d seen the face of God and then gone blind immediately after.  His breath was loud in his ears, his heart hammering in his chest. It was only when Derek’s arms tightened around him that he realized that he was shivering.
He was a King, even if these rebels did not know it. He would carry himself as such. He was more than his doomed soul bond. He was more than just a man whose secret hopes had just been crushed. He was more than just Anthony, who wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of his days tinkering with his little machines.
yeah, so i really wanted to finish up this story and got inspired today. this was supposed to be a one shot 2000 words or less. LMAO. that didn't happen. i tried not to make the ending to abrupt and i hope that i accomplished that. hope you enjoyed. My muse was already playing keep away when it came to this story so i wanted to finish while i still had the inspiration.
Later he would find the flowers and sweets shifted around into a much more pleasing pattern and some of Wufei's bright highlighters and colourful sticky notes tucked it among the arrangement. There was a space left empty for the lava lamp that had been promised and all the cushions on the couch had been lined up perfectly.
The large doors swung open easily, perfectly balanced to reveal the room beyond. Spencer took a second to case the room, tagging all the windows, doors and other potential dangers. He'd all but walked into the lion's den and if he wanted to walk out again unharmed, he'd have to stay on his feet and keep his wits about him.
FBI Agent Seeley Booth along with Dr. Temperance Brennan and her team had followed the trail to an underground black market ring. He'd reached out to Tony afterwards, thanking him for cracking the whole thing with his lead. Turned out the victim had been part of the ring and had been very meticulous in keeping records of the people he'd dealt with. Soon after, Booth, Brennan and their team were part of the Dinozzo network and he carefully drew Dr. Quintero into the fold as well.
"Jesus." Ewan face palmed. "Look, let's all just get out of here before we become the next Blair Witch Project or something. Even the townsfolk are creeped out by this place."
The vehicle rolled to a halt with a sad wheeze and a heavy, ominous clank. The music flickered and died leaving him in the silence of the deserted street. Tony sat in the darkness, hands gripping the wheel until his knuckles turned white.
Rhodes humphed, his heavy armor gleaming as he shifted. “Seems more like the shadow scum finally found some poor bugger to push out in front of the rabble horde. Don’t worry Monarch, we will still crush them and chase them back into the darkness. Then we will find the scuttling cockroach of a leader and they will feel the full might of Sol’s holy fire.”
The geeks had reported back that every twenty eight years, the planets weather systems reached a break point and essentially had a rainstorm to end all rain storms. At that particular set of news, Rodney had exchanged a tired look with Zelenka, both men hissing a selection of soft curses under their breaths.
He yelled for counter measures, scanning for the source of the weapons fire. Legionnaires veered left and right, gliding through the air like some kind of deadly aerial ballet; ripped apart by the barrage of blue lights and tossed to the harsh ground below like broken dolls.
“My friendship with him? My dignity?” he said desperately. “I think you’ve lost that a long time ago, приятель” Nat answered. Tony shrugged.
Wait a minute, he knew that voice. He would recognize that voice anywhere. He talked to that voice for the past 27 years.
“You wouldn’t believe it, but I actually do know a lot about the twenty first century. Maybe only in theory but...”
Then, almost to everyone’s surprise, Natasha made a toast. It was short, but also emotional and touching and that was when they all realized that they had become each other’s family. A group of remarkable individuals that couldn’t live without each other.
Bucky kept his expression neutral, although Steve could see his shoulders slumping in relief. “How come?” he asked carefully.
“Yes, Tiberius Stone. You had obtained his friendship as far as I remember.” Jarvis went back to his work, but the genius knew he was still paying the upmost attention.
Howard saw his scared look and laughed out loud, his voice ringing louder probably due to the three bottles of whiskey he had downed the past afternoon.
, and they exchanged stories, Tony told him about his time in MIT and Steve described his adventures with the commandos.
Three months after that monumental night, Tony was sitting in his workshop looking at his ring as it glinted under the artificial light. The band was silver, made of vibranium with a light blue stone in the middle. It looked just like Tony’s reactor. Of course, he knew about Steve’s obsession with that horrid machine.
He ran to his room, quickly trimmed his beard and changed into a suit with an AC/DC t-shirt, because he had to stay on brand.
The only person that felt out of place was Steve. Steve would look at the dance floor with that sad glint in his eyes, deep in the memories of another time. He would always sit in the corner, avoid talking with anyone for as long as possible. Sometimes he would even escape to the balcony.
“Should we take the celebrations somewhere else?” Tony said in a suggestive manner and Steve immediately lowered his head for another kiss. This time, though, he lifted his boyfriend by the thighs, while the smaller man slung his legs around the blond’s waist.
Fair warning: I tried to keep this unbiased, but I am on Tony’s side and it does show at some points on this fic (although I do try to keep it neutral, just wait and see)
It wasn’t strange his soulmate didn’t know the family butler. Although it was a big shame, considering he was the one that basically raised Tony.
“I’m sorry I overreacted” Tony replied without looking at him. “I know- It’s stupid-“ he stuttered. “It’s just- We’ve been together for thirteen months and I just thought...” he closed his eyes.
“And the kid later told me the other guy didn’t even study science! So, the kid told him that when friction occurs, the force is tangential to the surface of the body, which is constant and it’s the opposite of the direction of the motion of a body, but he wouldn’t listen! And like I could see the kid worrying, even though we all knew the other guy was wrong.
No matter how old he got, no matter how many years would pass, one thing Tony could never erase from his memory would be the smile on Steve’s face as he took his hand, got up and lead him towards the dance floor.
“Tony, I’m so sorry. You didn’t deserve to be treated like that, you were only a child. Howard wasn’t like this, when I knew him.” Steve said with sorrow in his eyes.
It’s feeling so much love you think you will combust and being unable to offer that love to anyone but your soulmate.
One thing he loved about Steve is that when he asked about something, he was truly interested to know the answer.
A couple of moments later they broke apart, breathing heavily, only their foreheads touching at that point. Tony’s hands were on Steve’s neck slightly gripping at the nape of his hair.
Steve didn’t really talk about himself. At least not in his current state, which always perplexed the teen, but he did understand the need for privacy.
“Wanna know a secret?” he fake-whispered to the little girl. Morgan tilted her head curiously in response.
He fell back on the mattress as tears streamed from his eyes. It was like having his heart ripped off. He’d never loved anyone as strongly as he loved Steve and now he’s probably gone. How could he ever live with that knowledge?
With a quick motion, Tony closed the space between them, stood on his tip toes and pressed his lips to Steve’s.
He could clearly see the arc reactor in the far distance, moved to the middle of the lake by that point. He took a deep breath and thought about his conversation with Morgan.
After everything, he’s come to realize that life is an one way road and the only direction you can choose is forwards.
“So, ready to see her again?” Bucky asked lightly and patted Steve’s back, deliberately trying to change the subject.
“You would actually call 4 am ‘morning’? Wow Tony, that’s some character development right there.” he replied wittily.
“Why do I feel you left a meeting to take the call?” Steve remarked while picking the knife up and making his wound a little deeper.
That brought them to Tony modifying a circuit board on an MIT lab while explaining to the other man the mechanisms of the robot he wanted to build.
He was noting down some updates needed to be done to the suit when Jarvis announced, “Sir, Nicholas Fury is on the line.”
“He knew, Buck.” Steve answered. “They both did.” he continued, his thoughts traveling to Natasha, her and the secret romance that had been going on between his best friends.
At that point, the blond was using the tweeters to dig around in his flesh. He started becoming frustrated, the bullet was nowhere to be found.
He unlocked his front door and took a bee line to the kitchen. The moment he arrived, he noticed his favorite butler, scratch that, his favorite relative at this point, cutting carrots for the meal he was preparing.
He stretched his arms and looked directly at the lab’s camera. “Tony, if you don’t open the door in the next thirty seconds I’m breaking the glass.” he said confidently.
He refused to talk to Steve the weeks that followed, even though his soulmate didn’t really seem to try to connect with him, which stung a little. Okay, a lot. Wasn’t he worth the effort?
“Sweetheart...” Steve’s heart broke and he pulled his boyfriend into a tight embrace. He rested his chin on the brunette’s head. “You are the most important person in my life and the best boyfriend I could ever ask for. You
“I’m so sorry to hear that, Sir. They say every obstacle appears for a certain reason in life, maybe he wasn’t the right person for you.” He replied gently.
“It was impossible to catch him on time. You did the best you could.” Steve said and the other man broke down full on sobbing. The captain gathered Tony in his arms and stayed like that until the engineer seemed to have calmed down.
“Usually once every summer, ‘till I turned 15 and started MIT. I used to meet up with my cousins and play around the village. The natives say it’s enchanted.”
He tried to take some deep breaths, but it felt like there was no place for air in his lungs, felt like he was suffocating. His hands were shaking wildly and his eyes were filled with tears. His normally perfect vision was so blurred, he could hardly see the scenery around him anymore.
Tony huffed. “My mum and I always had a weird relationship. I loved her to death, don’t get me wrong, but she wouldn’t have won the ’mother of the year award’. You see, she became a mother pretty young and definitely wasn’t prepared for it. She was used to attending galas and she had her own charity events to organize, but she did try to be there for me. She just didn’t always succeed.
“However, I do still have so much to learn. But there’s know else I’d rather teach me than you. So, I want this. I don’t want a night with you or unfulfilled promises. I want to spend my life with you. I want to wake up every morning next to you, to travel around the world with you, to settle down, get married, create our own family.” he admitted with a newfound fierceness. He sounded like he’d never been more sure about anything else in his life.
“Shot??? And you’re still in pain? How is that possible? Has it been long since the fight? What about the serum? It’s supposed to take care of pain like this, I’ll have a word with Erskine when I seen him in the afterlife.”
That’s why Natasha wasn’t surprised when she walked in the communal kitchen one morning and found Tony making coffee wearing Steve’s sweatshirt.
“Would you say yes if I asked you to marry me?” the blond continued, the nervous tone still clear in his voice.
Backstreets back!! I’m sorry for taking a whole year to post again but 2020 was a pretty hard year:’) Anyways, I thought it was sad I had completed this fic and never posted it and tbh I’m kind of proud of it so here we are! Big thank you to Rue for helping me with the science talk, ily<3
Her childish logic did make some sense, though. When he had come to this century, he had felt lost. His friends, his past, everything had been ripped away from him. He didn’t know who he was, what the actual purpose of his life was at that point.
Tony closed his eyes for a second and all he could see was him and Steve in 40 years, sitting on a bench outside of their retirement house holding hands while looking at each other adoringly.
He abruptly stopped and said “FRIDAY, be a dear and close up the coordinates. Delete all the data of the location research.”
“I’m sorry Tony, you didn’t deserve that kind of treatment.” Steve said. “And I’m sorry for the things I told you that day in the hellicarrier. I didn’t know you, not as the person you really are. I guess... when I looked at you I saw the future and it reminded me of everything I have lost.” he continued.
“Yes it is” Steve cut him off with a wide smile. “I asked JARVIS for the recipe and I know, of course, that this will be nothing like Jarvis’ lasagna, but I remember you telling me that it used to be your favorite meal, reminded you of your roots.”
But the genius didn’t really need anyone else. Steve was the only person that knew every part of him, his darkest thoughts and his brightest ideas.
“I-I’m sorry... I forgot-I gotta go get some notes I... forgot ehm.. there.” Tony said while running out of the lab.
Deep down, though, Steve knows he’s being unfair. Because he may have lost two important people to him, but he still has so many left.
“You’re hilarious, Tony.” the other man replied dryly but with a small smile on his face. “Oh and thank you for soundproofing the tower.” he said shyly.
