The thought had no sooner formed in his mind before he regretted it, because in the next second, he felt the cool, unmistakable edge of a blade against the side of his neck.
It was like every dream he’d ever had, coming true all at the same time. His veins turned to liquid fire and desire went from a low simmer in his belly; like it always was around Tony; to a blaze that raged all the way up his chest. His arms went around Tony’s waist, yanking him so close against Steve that he could feel every inch of their bodies pressed together, and he swallowed every little gasp and hitching sound that fell from the other man’s lips.
They had something between them that Steve didn’t have claim to; history. Could he even begin to compete with that?
“Hiya, Winghead!” the robotic voice greeted him, making Steve grin in disbelief. Was this thing actually being piloted by someone remotely? A soldier who’d seen his helmet getup? “How was the flight?”
But if that guilt manifested like welts, Thor’s beaming smile when he saw her was definitely a salve; it was like watching the sun come out, which might have been an insult to the God of Thunder, but was a wholly accurate description and the best Toni could liken it to.
Steve kissed her temple, swallowing the dizzying relief for a time when he could appreciate it more. After he’d taken his turn at the men who’d targeted his son.
“How did you know? That you were in love?” he asked instead of answering, blatantly ignoring Tony’s question. His companion bristled, although not overtly, and shifted his gaze back to the streets ahead of them while they walked.
There was no one, not a single person on the face of the earth, who he would rather have at his side when his back was against the wall. When all hope was lost, when he was staring down the barrel of a gun, he wanted Toni to be the one he had watching his six. Because for all that he knew and trusted so many good and loyal men in the army, there was just nobody like Toni Stark when you needed to make the impossible, possible.
That perceived indestructibility, along with her history of brilliance splashed out across the media, had lent her the reliability that she’d needed to smooth talk her way into the heart of the Board. Having their confidence backing her had given her the juice to make some of the more outlandish moves she’d made in her tenure as CEO, and those risky ventures had all culminated in turning SI into an international empire.
Grinning back, Rhodes dipped his head and kissed her forehead before retreating. “I’ll think about it,” he promised, and winked at her as he tapped the homing bracelet she’d added to his recent upgrade on the armor. On cue, his armor landed behind him before gently encasing him within it. It made something melancholy pang inside Toni, for the armor she’d had to scavenge, and she made a mental note to make sure all the pieces were collected and sent back to her workshop. It wouldn’t do for that technology to be in anyone else’s hands.
wreaks havoc and
Howard blinked, and Toni shrugged slightly. “He only takes orders from people he recognizes as my own.”
Bucky nodded; was already reclining back against his pillows. “Hey, since you’re not into him, mind if I make a move?” he asked casually, and the flare of heat and temper in Steve’s gut was both unexpected and irrational. “Tony’s great,” the brunet continued, seemingly totally unaware of the ugly feeling bubbling in Steve’s chest. “Smart, kind, funny… not to mention he’s fuckin’ gorgeous.”
“Repulsors,” he replied, and Steve could hear the grin in his voice. “It’s incredibly new tech. Honestly, I’m not even sure that it’s entirely stable.”
As it were, he possessed no such ability, and since he was not content to leave his post unguarded for long enough to call forth for the bifrost and ask his friend for an update of the Woman of Iron, the Thunder God had to settle for getting a little breathing room when Lady Natasha came to relieve him of his watch.
After putting Peter to bed, Toni had been at a loss on what to do with herself. She hadn’t felt focused enough to work, and she still hadn’t been ready to face Steve, so she’d spent the night downstairs in her office, rarely visited except on days when she had a meeting or paperwork that Pepper wasn’t inclined to sort through for her. Getting a jump on the financials of a deal that SI was touting, because that qualified as mindless work for a genius, Toni had remained in her office until she was completely certain that all the legwork was done for this deal to go through. Pepper would be beyond surprised, since the meeting with the board was set for two weeks from now, but that was just a side bonus. The real drawcard, was the fact that it had kept her busy until the sun rose.
And sure enough… “Mine,” Steve rumbled roughly, nipping at Tony’s bottom lip and licking into his mouth languidly, mapping out curves and ridges as though he were painting a picture. A hand found Tony’s hip in a bruising grip; the only mark that, come morning, Tony would be happy to have on his body. “Jus’ mine,” he husked again, dipping his head to suckle at the sensitive pulse point of Tony’s throat. Instinctively, the brunet hitched a leg around Steve’s hip and rocked up into him, moaning when he was met with his lover grinding down briefly against him. “God, Tony… baby, sweetheart, can’t wait to take you.”
she replied, and Steve heard the slightest hitch in her tone that she tried to mask from them. He’d known, on some deep and intrinsic level, that she’d been playing it down when she denied being badly hurt, but he hoped to God that it wasn’t as bad as his mind was suggesting. From what he could see, extraction wasn’t going to be a simple process, and certainly not a quick one.
It wasn’t supposed to happen this way. He had plans. He wanted to marry her, have a family, watch her revolutionize the world and have her back while she did it.
will live the rest of his life knowing that he has the most amazing mother he could ever hope for.”
Without a word, Jim, Barnes, and Banner all followed suit, each of them working with renewed vigor and purpose. It was time to get their resident genius back.
Because of course he knew how much she loved him, but that didn’t mean that he didn’t want to hear it from her, face-to-face.
Peggy rolled her eyes but smiled slightly, clearly fond of the other woman. “I need your help on a bit of a suicide mission.”
like him...”
Toni’s voice was raw and ragged, as if she’d run a mile and a half with a knife stuck in her side, and fear swarmed Steve’s senses. “Toni?” he demanded, jerking forward and stopping short as if he’d just realized the motion wouldn’t take him where he needed to be. With his girlfriend. “What happened, baby, what’s wrong?”
-J <3
Bucky was the first of them to recover. “What are ya talkin’ about, Doll? I’m busy makin’ myself a sandwich.”
It wasn’t an intrinsic, bone-deep kind of knowing; not the kind of ‘I can feel it in my veins, she’s not in there’ type of knowing, or that educated guess type of knowing based on the trajectory of the flight or whatever, like Toni sometimes did; but the kind of knowing that came from decades of being best friends. Of being family. Rhodey knew the genius in the same way that he knew himself, and so he could say with unimpeachable certainty that Toni Stark would walk to her own execution before letting a little boy die on her watch.
They knew, without her having to say it, that the kid would be getting that.
“I love you too, Nat.”
Pepper’s voice faltered, before picking up into a breathless little wail.
Bending back the railing away from itself, Steve took a few deep breaths, doubting that he could make the impossible distance but knowing that either way, success or death, would save Bucky’s life.
The second was that there was a low, dangerous growl floating over the air, that Tony would bet his company was coming from Steve. It had probably been hard enough for his boyfriend to see him coming in with a bruised cheekbone, split lip and the kind of ruffled clothes that intimated a struggle had taken place beforehand, but watching those goons whale on him now? Steve was probably so pissed.
from him. This was the only opportunity he was going to get to do something and Tony knew it. There was no way to guarantee that there was nobody behind him, stationed as a guard for the room, but Tony hoped that their continual underestimation of him meant that they were leaving him alone for the time being. Because who would think that the poor, defenseless inventor would try anything after being stomped into the ground?
“Can’t I just knock him out?” the man grumbled to his partner. “I know the boss said to save the damage until The Captain was there to see it, but this is just fucking ridiculous.”
Steve wasn’t above using a little unwarranted remorse if it meant having his questions answered.
“I’m turning into you,” Bucky was saying in disbelief, but there was a hint of amusement lining his tone that told Steve he was being teased. “This is a horrible dream.”
And there was just a hint of real insecurity, of real pain, in Tony’s voice as he spoke, but it was enough to run Steve through like a joust. All at once, it didn’t matter where the chips would fall in the wake of his truthfulness; all that mattered was that Tony understand that the issue was Steve’s and not his.
Peggy and Toni exchanged wicked grins that spoke more about their camaraderie than any words could. As far as Steve knew, there was a still a bit of an age difference between the women, but he supposed that being the only two females actively in the battlefield served as a rather strong basis for connection.
“So,” Steve shifted to face her again, so he wouldn’t get a crick in his neck, “are you going to present the armor? Try and make it standard issue? I’d say the prototype had a successful test run.”
And then there was fresh air and Steve was fairly certain he hadn’t ever appreciated it more.
For all their banter, Toni had enough experience to tell when some of the darkness was ebbing closer to the edges of Bucky’s mind, and this was one of those times. It wasn’t unusual, as the supersoldier tended to shoulder guilt in any form when one of them got hurt, even more so with Steve and Toni, and long ago, the genius had resolved to keep him out of that dark space. She knew all too well what it was like to carry blame on one’s shoulders; it was a toxic thing that could just as easily break a person as a physical blow could.
Well. That probably explained everything in a very concise and succinct way.
The impressive looking legal binder that had been next to the kidnapping picture, containing Steve’s will and an annotated list of the assets that would fall into Tony’s possession, went flying as Tony hurled it pointedly to the corner of the room. It could stay there forever, for all the fucks he gave about it.
Not even the emergency surgery and temporarily having a car battery and electromagnet shoved into his chest, could compare to the pain of losing his mother.
I thought you went away,
Unfortunately, that little stunt hadn’t been enough for Tony to kick the has-been to the curb. Two days later had taken the pair to a fancy dinner at some Greek place, followed by 80s night at a club.
“I guess it makes sense.” Rhodes’ voice interrupted his thoughts. “Toni doesn’t usually cop to the things she does that can be remotely construed as caring.” Then, as an afterthought, the military man slanted him a glance and added, “I still don’t like you, though.”
Steve rolled his eyes as Bucky groaned into his pillow, feigning exasperation but still managing to be really pleased that his best friend was reaching a point in his recovery where he could joke around about what had happened to him. “Nearly a whole century, and you’re still not even sorta funny,” he shot back easily, folding his legs underneath himself and making himself comfortable at the foot of Bucky’s bed.
mate, Steve corrected himself--earlier, but it satisfied a craving to have him here now, hale and whole and in the same place as the rest of his teammates, all of them where Steve could see they were safe and taken care of.
“Captain soon.” Sam looked over his shoulder, then turned and smiled. It was a nice smile, warm and reassuring. Tony was too terrified to actually
ever been claimed by another alpha, Steve would have smelled it as soon as he got close enough to scent him, and no doubt the city would have been looted and on fire before dawn.
He hit a dead end and turned. Stark was in the doorway, chest heaving, legs braced and arms stretched wide. Steve feinted right, ducked low, and nudged the back of Stark’s knee with his foot so Stark went stumbling to the side. Stark’s hand almost brushed the edges of his hair as he ducked under Stark’s arm and ran back.
“I believe you,” Bruce said, sounding faintly surprised. Steve stayed relaxed and loose as Bruce edged close enough to kneel over him.
there. “You’re quieter than I thought you’d be.”
Their city had repelled raiders from the north before, with Howard’s cannons picking off ships at long range until the raiders simply turned and sailed for easier targets. That wouldn’t work against the Captain. Even if the cannons had been properly maintained since Howard’s death, which Tony knew for a fact hadn’t happened, the Captain’s ships were staying too far offshore for the cannons to reach. His own fleet’s cannons were in better shape, and although he didn’t have the advantage of the high ground, he could no doubt find a way to compensate. The Captain’s tactics were legendary. If he decided to target the city, he’d find a way in sooner or later.
“Tony,” he blurted.
. Tony had no way of knowing and he wasn’t going to risk echoing it. He kept quiet.
him, which wasn’t compatible with any of his current strategic goals.
Tony glanced at the tent flap. It was closed, for now, but all around them the Captain’s army bustled with activity as his soldiers made camp for the evening. They would leave in the morning with the tide, and Tony would go with them, one more piece of flotsam pulled in their wake. “I guess I’ll find out.”
him stop. He chanced a look at Steve’s eyes, which were closer than ever while he studied the ropes spreading over Tony’s back, and found only calm, focused patience. “Not that I’m advocating that you cut them off or anything. Slow is fine with me. Not having a knife near my skin is an added bonus. I can’t say I was looking forward to seeing your knife work up close and in person, no matter how impressive it supposedly is when you’re carving up your enemies. Woah, okay,” Tony said, his voice pitching up sharply as Steve’s hands closed firmly over his upper arms. For a second he thought he was about to be encouraged to shut up after all, but Steve just tipped him carefully onto his side, draping his torso across Steve’s lap as Steve sat beside him. Tony held his breath for a few long seconds, but Steve just ran a hand down his calf and started working on the rope holding his ankles together. “Okay. This is fine, we’re okay. I’d say warn a guy, but it’s not like I’d understand it if you tried, so, okay, free pass on that one.”
Romanoff, after a glance at him, took over. “When an omega leads a group of warriors to victory, if those warriors are already close to the omega or if the battle was especially great, the omega will sometimes go into heat.”
There had been plenty of chances to run--he knew the city’s defences better than anyone, and could have slipped out of his locked room at any point (it was honestly insulting that Stane thought locking the door would be enough to prevent him from leaving if he wanted to, and Tony wished he’d gotten a chance to tell him so to his face). He could have evaded the household guards, stolen a horse from the stables, and made his way to the gates. He could have gotten out.
“Hi,” Tony said brightly. “I’m Tony, and you’re my new language tutor.”
They hit a stalemate over Steve’s pants. Every time Tony went near them, his anxiety surged until Steve blocked his hands and redirected them to safer territory. After the third failed attempt to hurry things along to their inevitable conclusion, Tony sat back and raised his hands in exasperation. “Look, it’s my first time, I’m going to be nervous, okay? I’m not getting any more relaxed tonight than this. This is it. Are we doing this or what?”
Granted, his expectations were so low they were practically subterranean, but Tony would take any silver lining he could find.
His face flamed as Steve untied the rope that crossed his groin and wound around his ass to meet the rope at his wrists. Steve held the rope away from the fragile skin between his legs before pulling, making sure that no friction rubbed against Tony’s entrance. It wasn’t physical pressure, but Tony imagined he could feel the weight of Steve’s gaze on parts he’d barely looked at himself. The heightened awareness that Steve could
Later – after debriefing was done and promises had been made about filing mission reports on time – Steve trudged up to the roof of the tower. It was a post-mission ritual he and Tony had, whenever they won and none of the team had ended up in medical; they hung out on the roof and relished another battle fought and won, talking about anything and everything just for the comfort of company.
Peter, cheerful and recovered from the day’s events after a good night’s rest, had been keen to spend time with Bruce this morning, who had finally resurfaced from whatever experiment he had going on in his lab. She’d made the impulsive decision after her schedule had cleared, to visit the foundation that she’d started in her mother’s name, and after she’d explained to her fellow scientist where she was going, Bruce was all too happy to take on babysitting duties for the day. In the interests of not having Peter spill the beans, and inadvertently trigger a Code Hulk, she made herself explain all the excitement that Bruce had missed from the day before. One look at her casted wrist and the now-purple bruise around her arm had made him a little green around the edges, but thankfully, Bruce had kept it together and assured her that he would look after Pete.
who I
It was the only thing that Steve needed to hear, apparently, because in the next moment, he was laying her on the bed and following her down, wrapping himself around her as if he could protect her from the entire world as long as his body stood between her and danger. For all that he covered practically every inch of her, he was unfalteringly careful, never once putting any pressure on one of her injuries.
If he could have, hell if he would have ever let Toni leave on that business trip.
It honestly couldn’t have been done sooner. The delays on her suit had caused her to be benched for the recon mission that the team was currently in the middle of, and though she might have stayed behind anyway, in order to be home for Peter, it still got under her skin that it had taken her this long. The Mach-11 would’ve been sufficient for any attacks on the city, but Toni was personally offended at the thought of being on the field with outdated gear. She’d always taken personal pride in making sure that everything the Avengers used was the top of the line in their respective categories, and it would have been positively abhorrent to lower that standard with her own armour.
Smiling faintly at the woman, Toni shook her head once in reassurance. “That’s alright, he’s okay. He’s not much older than my own son, so I’m used to this,” she said, and if Maico’s mother was surprised by her fluency in Spanish, she graciously refrained from showing it.
“Mrs. Navarro, can you tell us what it was like to be forced to leave the safety of your son in the hands of the most notorious mass murderer of our generation, and the most cold and uncaring women the world has ever known?”
Maybe it would be enough for someone else, but he was… God, he called himself Tony’s best friend. He claimed to love the man. And yet this was how he’d treated him? And why? Just because of some admittedly potent, but apparently unwarranted jealousy?
Make her choose.
Hope rekindling in her chest, Toni forced herself into a semi-upright position, the boy still dozing peacefully half across her lap. “Alright, J,” she murmured. “Patch me through, would you?”
Okay, so it wasn’t a spectacular defense. Fine, maybe it wasn’t even much of a defense at all – sort of like saying
So they’d know that she was his, that he was the only one who got to have her like that.

Steve nodded and said something to Sam.
“Ah,” Thor said politely. Steve wondered if that was his default response whenever Earth’s sexual dynamics came into play. “Do you require privacy?”
to speak. It wouldn’t be particularly difficult to pretend not to understand a word, while really being fluent.
Tony opened his mouth, then snapped it shut, acutely aware of Steve watching his reaction. “Yeah, so, I’m just going to stay over here,” he said carefully, trying his best to keep his scent even. Their relative positions helped a lot. He didn’t have to be nervous about Steve’s size, not when he was only watching from a distance. Tony thought again of heights at a distance and perspective tricks and had to fight back a nervous giggle. Steve was turning out to be a surprisingly tolerant alpha, but Tony didn’t want to test that tolerance by appearing to laugh at his dick.
gesture, and this time Tony understood. Steve was taking care of the problem, but he wasn’t expecting Tony to be involved, at least not physically. The view from where he was sitting was going to be enough to satisfy his curiosity, but Tony wouldn’t have to do anything. Nothing would
That was a gamble, but fortunately Tony cracked up laughing, his open mouth pressed to Steve’s shoulder. When he pulled back his eyes were bright. “Glad I could give satisfaction. You are

, we need a larger data set. JARVIS, give me a--thank you,” he said, as a blue screen appeared in the air. Steve watched with interest as Tony started plotting something on a three-dimensional graph. “This usually happens in field conditions, right? Rapid onset? I’ll need to build a recorder and pheromone sampler. A really
“Ms. Potts?” he asked, just to be sure.
There was some kind of alarmed noise from the bathroom as Steve whipped past the doorway, but he didn’t have time to investigate. Stark was gaining fast, bouncing off furniture and taking shortcuts as Steve went deeper into the penthouse, flying through rooms and looping back around, building a mental map as he ran. Steve could have outrun him, but that wasn’t the point.
in alpha arousal.
“Bossy, bossy.” Stark stripped off without ceremony, Banner only hesitating for a moment before joining in. Banner and Stark were apparently free from the body shyness Steve had observed in some alphas. It figured that if Banner woke up naked in front of strangers after coming back from the Hulk he’d lose modesty pretty fast, and Stark had apparently never met a taboo he didn’t want to cross.
Steve got vocal, letting all the little noises he might have otherwise held back spill out of him. Tony clearly wanted to know when he was doing well. Tony adapted to every cue Steve gave him in real time, until Steve really couldn’t have held anything back even if he’d
, his own cock barely softened, his eyes moving to the rest of his teammates even as Tony disengaged and collapsed onto his back next to him. They were all watching him, Banner with cautious fascination, Clint with bright interest, Natasha with an unreadable expression. Steve smiled at all three of them and extended a hand to Natasha.
. The heat simmering in Steve’s core spread a little further, burning up his chest and down his legs, as Stark proved himself willing to wrestle, all his lean strength on display. They would do something about that heat soon, but there was still time to play first.
Tony turned to Steve and gave him a shy smile. “I can’t wait until tonight when I can ride your throbbing salami stick again, masterful pleasure king of my heart.”
“I hope you don’t expect me to eat all of this myself,” Tony said, eyebrows raised. Steve just gave him an expectant look until Tony picked up a roll and started chewing.
The ships were flying the Captain’s colors, red and blue rings with a white star in the middle, but below the Captain’s standard was a yellow flag, not the black flag Tony had expected. A black flag would have meant an assault was imminent. A yellow flag meant the Captain was willing to parlay, and if he was willing to negotiate, Tony knew exactly what Stane was going to offer him. There was only one bargaining chip in the city valuable enough to buy off the most feared barbarian of the north.
“Here’s my chance.” If Tony ignored the fact that none of this was his idea and that he wouldn’t have any control over what happened to his life from here on out, it was kind of exciting. He really had always wanted to travel. This wasn’t how he would have chosen to, but, well. He’d always known his options were going to be limited.
,” Clint said frankly.
me already.”
Tony raised the spyglass to his eyes. The crewman in the crow’s nest had just barely sighted land, but he was working with the spyglass Tony had designed two prototypes ago (only the most durable spyglasses were allowed up in the crow’s nest, a rule instituted when Tony had to grind all new lenses after Pietro dropped a brand new version from the crow’s nest to the deck). Tony’s latest design let him see details Pietro would miss, even if it was a bitch to focus on the fly. He patiently adjusted the lenses until the walls of the city were clear.
“Okay,” Clint said, clapping his hands together. “Couples language lessons start just as soon as we’ve cast off. You ready?”
Anything else he might have said was lost to the roaring in Steve’s ears, his body enthusiastically giving itself over to to his heat. He took a sharp satisfaction in being full, in the rhythm of Tony’s hips, in the scent of sweat and steel rising from Tony's skin, in how well their bodies were working together, Tony rising to meet Steve’s goading and speeding up when Steve arched impatiently under him.
Steve looked back at him, clearly amused, and said something short.
“I yield,” Thor said warmly, a smile on his face. “Have pity, dear Captain.”
“Oh, shit,” Stark said. Steve had expected him to back away, but he stepped forward instead, his eyes alight with interest as his nostrils flared. “Really? After one fight?”
like, and it warmed him to see it in Stark. Steve gave ground judiciously while dodging Stark’s canny lunges, backing towards the mattress on the floor.
“Pretty much,” Steve admitted. “Less so if it’s with an established team, or a smaller fight, but sometimes it doesn’t seem to matter.”
Tony was pretty sure Steve hadn’t understood any of that, which was probably a good thing. Steve just looked at him calmly until Tony sighed and sat back on his heels.
“I’ve got him,” Romanoff said, and Steve slid out from behind Barton as she pulled him in.
“I would be happy to join you for another.” Thor pulled his tunic off and laid back with his arms folded behind his head, looking up at Steve invitingly. “Do as you will.”
“Count me in,” Clint said unexpectedly, “but not yet. Sleep first. Wake me up in a couple weeks.”
Eye-to-eye (mostly--even kneeling, Steve had a couple inches on Tony), he didn’t seem quite so intimidating. The frown had smoothed out of his forehead and left his face calm and open. He was still talking, in a steady pace that didn’t demand a reply. Tony thought of the nonsense babble he’d used many times before to soothe nervous horses new to the household stables. Skittish colt, skittish virgin; Steve must not see much difference.
“Good morning.”
“Holy shit, were you down there this whole time?” Stark was standing in the doorway, Banner hovering behind him. “Because if so, I need to write a thank you letter to genetic engineering.”
“Okay,” Tony whispered, feeling ridiculous. “Okay, here we go.”
Tony shuddered and ducked his head into Steve’s shoulder, hiding his face as he came. It took him a moment to collect himself; Steve tucked his head in close with a hand over his neck when he twitched like was about to pull away.
It wasn’t like Tony had any delusions that one day he’d get to have a grand romance and a love match. He’d been betrothed to a neighboring lord’s son ever since he’d presented at the age of twelve. He was used to the idea that he would be traded away as part of a political alliance; he’d just expected that trade to only take him one county over, with someone he--well, not
Steve didn’t reply, but he was still smiling. Maybe Tony’s babble was cute when it was incomprehensible. “Like I’m a pet. How charming and not at all demeaning. Is this really working for you?”
“Bad luck for him,” Steve said serenely. His arms wrapped around Tony’s shoulders, supporting his arms without jostling the spyglass. “How soon until they see us and sound the alarm?”
you. Come on, move your ass.”
“Sure can be fun, though,” Barton said, and winked at Steve.
“Steve.” The word was soft, quiet enough that Tony could have pretended not to hear it.
Tony summoned up his courage and shuffled forward. His hand reached out, retreated, reached out again, and hovered an inch above Steve’s shoulder. Steve waited, the only movement his chest rising and falling as he breathed.
Steve made an approving noise and slid his hand down again. Tony pressed his hot cheek against Steve’s tunic. Steve’s hands were working on the ropes at Tony’s wrists, the last part of the tie, and the relief of almost being free was warring with the knowledge of what was going to happen next.
Only one way to find out. Tony swallowed hard, trying to ignore the fresh wave of anxiety at knowing he was taking a risk, that this might prompt Steve to decide foreplay was over and it was time to take whatever he wanted. He dragged a finger through the slick on his thighs and reached for his entrance.
“I’m not complaining,” Barton mumbled. He’d closed his eyes as soon as Steve pulled his shirt over his head, putting himself entirely in Steve’s hands. The show of trust had Steve’s instincts humming with contentment as he lifted Barton into the tub. Barton had
Steve said something again, low and quiet, and sank to his knees.
“Okay,” Steve said peaceably, then reared up to bowl Tony over again, not even trying to pin him, just for the fun of watching Tony twist out of his hold. One tricky elbow lock later and Tony was braced over him and kissing down Steve’s stomach. His mouth was hot and wet and inventive, and under other circumstances Steve would have gladly let Tony stay between his thighs for an hour just exploring, but his heat was pulsing inside him, adding urgency to every touch.
Tony turned to look at Steve. His face was calm, his hands steady on Tony’s hips; only the metallic tang of anticipation in his scent revealed how much he’d been looking forward to this day. The peace settlement had forbade him from attacking for three years, and the Captain always honored his word, but he’d never intended to leave Stane in power forever, not once he’d confirmed that Stane had knowingly sold weapons to Hydra. The details Tony had eventually confided about what his life had been like under Stane’s rule had only made the inevitable battle more personal.
Tony tried. He really did. He spent a long time touching Steve’s shoulders, his arms, his chest, even a daring swipe along his jaw, dangerously close to his throat. Steve’s eyes were dark and intent as he watched, his body tense with whatever instincts he was keeping in check, but he didn’t pounce. Tony was given free rein to touch him. Flares of alpha scent rolled off Steve's skin whenever Tony found a sensitive place to stroke, or whenever Tony’s own arousal spiked. Maybe if Tony had a month to explore, he could have gotten so comfortable with Steve’s body that stroking over the erection tenting Steve’s pants wouldn’t make his own scent sour with nerves, but he only had a night, and he could see how the muscles in Steve’s stomach jumped when Steve was suppressing the urge to move. He didn’t trust that restraint to last.
“Okay,” Bruce said quietly, “yes, okay,” and came on a long sigh. Most of his come landed on Steve’s chest, with a few stray drops making it up to Steve’s chin. He stayed in his crouch for a few long moments after, breathing through his nose, then sank back onto his sitbones. His fingers reached out reflexively to trace the column of Steve’s throat. Steve stayed quiet and let him work through his reaction, only moving in order to kiss Bruce’s wrist once it was within range.
“Tony,” Steve said, the name softened by his accent, followed by a sentence Tony couldn’t understand, and he was
“I can do it,” Barton muttered, but exhaustion was clear in every line of his limp body, and he didn’t protest Steve running shampoo-slick fingers over his head. He rinsed it out carefully, using one hand to direct the water and another to shield Barton’s face, until all the suds were gone.
Steve was going to treasure the incredulous expression Stark made in response until the day he died. Before Stark could recover, Steve slid past him through the doorway and took off down the hallway. A moment later he heard Stark following at a dead sprint.
Steve said something. Tony’s eyes snapped to his face, trying to pick up as much information as he could without a shared language to smooth the way. Steve was frowning a little, and Tony’s gut soured further at the thought of what the consequences would be of displeasing him so early in the night. They hadn’t even
He had expected a counter-attack, but the man only laughed and caught Steve’s arm with a strong hand around his wrist, stopping him from applying any more pressure. “Is this what you call a friendly greeting? I thought I was invited!”
“Absolutely not,” Tony said, not trying to conceal his outrage. “After all that, you want us to just go to
He set his palm onto Steve’s shoulder. Steve was warm, no surprise, and his skin was unexpectedly soft. “No sun exposure?” Tony theorized, as his fingers twitched nervously against Steve’s skin. Emboldened by Steve’s acceptance of his touch, he started to feel his way along more deliberately, stroking over the firm curve of his shoulder towards his collarbone. “You probably don’t do a lot of shirtless training, even in the summer, if it’s really as cold up north as they say it is. They say the southern sun is stronger. I read a theory once that it’s the angle of the earth’s tilt--”
“Oh,” he said, and his tone must have been strange, because when he looked up everyone was looking back at him. Even Banner, who was leaning heavily against Thor and had one eye closed, was watching him with the other.
“Can I--” Tony wrapped his slick hand around his cock, gasping at how good the contact felt.
Tony wiggled his fingers and moved his wrists a little, letting Jarvis test the give. There wasn’t a lot of it, but the bindings weren’t tight enough to be physically uncomfortable. It was only what they symbolized that Tony had a problem with. “There weren’t a lot of peaceful evacuations in that story. Decapitations, yes. Heads on pikes, yes. Peaceful evacuations, no.”
“My, that
“Compromise,” Tony suggested, nosing into Steve’s chest. “My kind of breakfast in bed first, your kind of breakfast in bed after.”
“No emergency,” Steve said. He wished he still had his helmet on, something to at least give his face partial cover, but putting it back on now would be ridiculous. “It’s just. We won.”
“That’s...a little alarming,” Banner said.
Steve relaxed back onto the pillows, his hands folded behind his head. “You can just come on me, if you want. Doesn’t have to be any more complicated than that.”
, Cap,” Barton said very quietly, his thighs immediately opening wider.
Tony woke up with an ache in his hip and a crick in his neck. He groaned and rolled onto his back, freezing when that pressed his side against something warm and firm. His eyes opened a crack to peek at the obstacle.
“Oh,” Tony said, too relieved to remember that he’d meant to stay silent. “You’re untying them, okay. That’s good. Better than leaving them on, that’s for sure, and to be perfectly honest, my knees are starting to ache. Was there supposed to be an endurance component to this ritual? I promise I feel sufficiently abased before your magnificence.”
was coming in, invading the den where his pack was sleeping, and they were going to
The hand on his back slid up to grip his neck. Tony closed his eyes at the wash of honey-slow warmth that followed the drag of Steve’s palm along his spine and the pressure of Steve’s fingers at his nape.
, exactly. It just hadn’t been at the top of his mind. An alien invasion was the kind of thing that took priority, and then he’d immediately gone from battle to coordinating between SHIELD and the other first responders until Agent Hill had forcibly shoved them all into a van and told them to get at least twenty-four hours of rest before they even
just enough to make his point. Stane’s eyes narrowed. He wasn’t stupid, unfortunately--stupidity would have been easier to forgive--but he couldn’t do anything more forceful than glare to show his displeasure, not when he needed Tony to be as pristine as possible. It wouldn’t do to offer the Captain damaged goods.
“Tony,” Steve said, to get his attention, and then put his hand under his angled head and closed his eyes, miming sleep.
, Tony was
Omegas were rarer in the north. Untouched, unmated omegas were rarer still.
It was more than just fear making his heart pound now, and Steve would be able to smell the arousal rising from the thin skin above his pulse. “How are we doing?” Tony asked, watching Steve press the tip of his nose to Tony’s wrist. “Do I pass the smell test?”
of it sang through him and left him blissfully sated, even as she pulled off his still-hard cock.
“A fine dawn,” Steve said from behind him.
“Forgive me.” Thor’s hand moved between Steve’s legs, his fingers thick and confident, and Steve ground against him with a pleased hum. “I’m sorry to have missed the start of the festivities. I trust the others left you well satisfied?”
She loved that he included himself in that plan; loved that Steve loved her enough to put up with her own coping methods, showing nothing but patience and tenderness.
At home, the first thing Tony did was to gather up the folder he’d tossed just a few hours previously. He staunchly refused to look at it, not now that he knew just what they were, and instead just put them haphazardly in place and relocated to his and Steve’s bedroom to wait for the blond’s stormy approach.
Tony wasn’t sure whether Barnes was commenting or asking for confirmation, but he nodded anyway, not sparing a glance for the medic (Banner something?) that was stitching him up. “How do you think someone can design a weapon if they haven’t discharged one?” he asked rhetorically, and in case that didn’t make his point, he added, “I was going to a shooting range before I was going to a school.”
Still. He adopted a lightly stern expression. “You shouldn’t say things like that in anger, Howard.” He was only thankful that Toni hadn’t heard. Upset or not, that would have crushed her.
Dimly, he registered Bruce slipping earphones on; he didn’t begrudge the man the motion, and could admit that it was probably for the better, lest they have a Code Green in mid-air. For their parts, the rest of the Avengers gathered closer, instinctively on guard despite the fact that the threat was nowhere near them.
Before she could salute, Steve sealed the deal with a kiss.
Toni’s lips lifted in amusement at the sight. “Yeah, he was exhausted. Nodded off before I finished the first two verses of the lullaby.” Because she knew Peter would love it, and that Steve would love it just as much, she took the plushies and laid them with the sleeping child. She would deny it to the ends of the earth, but a part of her was still deeply touched by the fact that Peter felt safer when he clutched on to her and Steve’s stuffed toys.
“I want to help,” he stated definitively. “Steve’s gonna kick all our asses for letting you go anyway, might as well screw all the instructions to hell.”
couldn’t possibly mean anything good.
They would heal. And they would move on.
“JARVIS?” Bruce addressed the AI that somehow permanently tuned into their entire comm unit. When the crisp British voice answered, the scientist continued. “Can you scan the wreckage? Use Toni and the kid’s heat signatures and maybe some echo imaging to get an idea of where we’re looking for her?”
see it, but I do now, and… and I know you’re with Coleman, I do, but sweetheart you can’t just tell me that what we have is nothing anymore. I’m not over you, I’m never going to stop loving you, and I can only hope that you haven’t really stopped loving me, because we’re once in a lifetime, Tony. You’re my once in a lifetime.”
Thing was, he knew firsthand how it felt. He’d been dealing with Toni being in danger, not since she took over at the helm of the company, as most people thought, but since before that. Since college. Which became extra horrifying when one realized that Toni had been 14 when she’d started at MIT, and 14 still when they’d become friends.
Well. No use crying over spilt milk. Or, she eyed her arm distastefully, blood, as it were.
He snapped his face up to glare at Bucky. “How was I supposed to notice?” he challenged, sounding more sulky than argumentative. “He’s my best friend, just as much as you are.”
The thought hurt more than she knew was rational.
The sound of his name falling from Tony’s lips like a prayer, combined with how receptive the other man was, told Steve that he wouldn’t last long enough to be inside Tony. Not this first time. It was, of course, a disappointment of sorts, but in other ways, the romantic side of himself for example, Steve reasoned that it was good. Their first time together shouldn’t be like this, in the wake of an argument with emotions running high and Steve not even having taken Tony on a proper date yet.
“What’d your ma tell ya about eavesdroppin’?” Bucky demanded, eyes reproachful as he cut in. It made Steve feel like a kid again, as the instigator of most of the trouble him and Buck got into, contrary to popular opinion. “And what are ya doin’, skulking around insteada just counting sheep or somethin’ like a normal person? I know the serum helps and all, but ya still gotta get a solid six, Stevie, it may not seem like...”
Was this karma for all the times that she’d hooked and booked with guys specifically chosen to piss Howard off? It had to be.
Gently steadying him so he could stand, she hushed him one more time before turning to face her father. As calm as she’d ever been, Toni closed the distance between them, curled the fingers of her right hand into a fist, and smashed that fist into Howard’s face.
Unable to bear the sight any longer, he dropped his forehead against hers again, waiting for her eyes to close before he also shut his. Swallowing hard, he finished in a rough voice, “And
“Alright, Winghead,” she nodded, and this time, the nickname made him smile widely. For some reason, it sounded all the sweeter, all the more special, coming out of Toni’s mouth. “You got it.”
“Fuck, baby, you’re this wet for me?” he asked in a rough growl. “You like feeling me here?” Demonstratively, he brushed his thumb across the sensitive bundle of nerves that he knew would wring the most pleasure from her, rewarded by a wrecked whimper and breathless string of
His thoughts were derailed as Steve claimed his lips in another kiss, this one deeper and with an edge to it that Tony easily identified as possessiveness. It wasn’t a rare thing for Steve to stake his claim, especially with all the investors Tony constantly had to charm and sweet-talk, but there was a desperation to the moment that spoke volumes more about Steve’s fear than the blond himself would.
This, she knew, was what he’d been resisting since they’d come back home three weeks ago. It was an outpouring of the last of the terror and anguish and helplessness, as well as the first tentative tendril of acceptance that it was over, now.
“We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,” Howard was saying, casting a speculative look over Steve that made him equally self-conscious and annoyed for it. “But we’re ready. As we’ll ever be.”
He wasn’t going to lose any more of his family.
Steve had known torture in his life, but this was a cruel and unusual form of it.
“What I need, is to keep a promise that I made to my son,” Toni stated with firm finality in her voice, when she realized that there was no option left but to be entirely blunt. “A promise I made to
“You’re starting to sound like her,” he pointed out wryly, riding out the customary spark of jealousy that assaulted him any time that the genius bestowed her attention on someone other than him. What was weird, though, was the fact that he spent so much time with Toni, but somehow never noticed her with any one soldier for a length of time long enough to get repairs and upgrades and testing done on the suit. She was being awfully discreet about that.
“And what a fantastic ass, it is.”
Feeling a beat of sympathy for him – because the reality was rarely preferable to the illusion – she only nodded wearily. “I appreciate that.”
“She’s disarmed four of the six active missiles,” he reported succinctly, his own voice tight with apprehension. His only indicator that Toni was still alive, still moving, still alright, was the missiles slowly going dark on his screen. And it was a sporadic indicator at best. “She’s got another two minutes, eighteen seconds to disarm the rest.”
As soon as the particularly vicious aftershock was done, and Steve caught a glimpse of the way that the building had further collapsed in on itself, he rounded on the two men with him.
Okay, so I took a bit of a different turn in this one, including some Bucky POV, so please let me know if it works! If it does, then I'll try writing in some other Avengers' perspectives :D  Gotta have equal amounts of fluff to combat angst, right?! :D
“I fail to see the magic you speak of, tiny human.”
“Yeah, Starks are a bit of an acquired taste,” he joked, placing an armor-clad arm on Steve’s shoulder to pull him down into a crouch. Steve went willingly – trust came pretty easily when he considered that the guy had flown in and plucked him out of the sky when his parachute had been ripped to shreds by stray bullets, effectively saving his hide in the first ten seconds of their meeting – and it proved helpful when he saw the vehicles approaching the factory. “Even then, it’s a somewhat annoying taste.”
But after a while, the memories would fade to something fuzzy and the jagged edges of the fear would smooth out. They’d fall asleep every night curled around each other and gradually, the nightmares would be warded off by the sheer force of their combined presence. Steve would unthinkingly go on a morning run when Toni had an early meeting that Pepper would force her to attend, and they’d remember that it was okay to continue with the mundanity of their day-to-day without worry and fear. The first few fights or missions as Avengers would be a little more difficult to get through, but they’d do that too, because they were co-leaders of the Earth’s mightiest heroes and that demanded a level of trust that transcended everything else.
Steve reeled visibly at the words and fought hard against his own rearing temper. He wanted, for a brief moment, to knock the elder Stark right back on his ass for daring to talk about Steve’s best gal that way, but the Captain forced himself to remember that Toni
At the dorm room, he’d tossed her, albeit gently, on to his couch and was about to lace into her about how irresponsible it was to sneak off to college parties and drink and carry on with guys like that, when he got a proper look at her.
“Well, Toni and I,” Erskine amended with what looked like a pleasant smile on his face despite the pointed hint of steel in his tone. “But yes. We did.”
With a courage he didn’t normally possess – certainly, he couldn’t talk this openly to any other dames – Steve mused aloud, “It isn’t the worst thing… feeling. Even the bad things. It proves that things were once good. That we loved.” When he realized that Toni’s unyielding, intense orbs, almost amber in color now, were trained on him, he turned a little sheepish. “That’s what my Ma used to tell me, anyway.”
They cut the call, neither of them needing a goodbye to distract them. Toni felt her stomach twist as she looked at her own reflection in the blank screen; why did she still feel like something was missing? Why did she still feel like she wasn’t seeing the whole picture?
“You don’t know Howard, Steve,” Peggy interrupted him, not unkindly. She patted his arm consolingly, and Steve was too immersed in his righteous indignation for Toni to realize that the touch didn’t fluster him as he thought it would have. “Let her deal with him. She knows how to.”
“Liar,” she accused him mildly, the smirk on her face softening the response. Her grin widened when he sent her a sheepish smile and Toni swallowed down a laugh, knowing that her ribs certainly wouldn’t thank her for it if she didn’t.
For his part, Steve was awkwardly perched on what was left of the window seat now, stretching his arms around them so as to encompass both Toni and Peter in his embrace. It was probably for the benefit of their son, cocooned between them all warm and safe, but it worked wonders on Toni as well; gave her a sense of sturdiness, a foundation and a pillar of strength to lean on, and unknowingly, even soothed her own inner turmoil about the uncertainty of the future. Because whatever happened to her, if anything should come to pass, she knew that Steve would be there for Peter, and Peter for him. She would fight tooth and nail not to let it come to that, but there was a certain comfort in knowing that they would be there for one another, because they were the most important things in her world.
Bucky was staring at them, wide-eyed and gobsmacked, but Steve didn’t know how he was going to start explaining, so he just… didn’t. Toni could decide how she wanted to handle it.
Toni felt her stomach sink as comprehension brought horror dawning on Steve’s face. Perhaps it would have been too much to hope for, that he would poke a hole in her theory. Instead, she sat in front of the screen as Steve barked out orders to the rest of the team over his shoulder, grimly mute.
She was alive and she was there and she was doggedly hanging on by her last reserves because she had fought to come back to him, to their family. Steve knew right then that he couldn’t have possibly asked for anything more.
Bucky snorted, leveling him with a knowing look. “You’re saying that like you aren’t already getting all overprotective on her.”
hard!”
“The suit,” she replied eventually, with obvious reluctance. “Using the suit speeds up the spread of palladium in my body.”
He managed a faint smile at the reminder of the promise he’d made Peter before leaving. After making the decision about who to take with him on a rescue mission for the love of his life, leaving Peter was the next hardest part. The child had clung to him, even without knowing what was going on. Eventually, it had taken some semblance of an explanation for Peter to let him leave, and even though the only thing that Steve had said was that he needed to go get Mommy back, the little boy seemed to understand that something had gone wrong. Not a difficult conclusion to come to, since he’d basically seen Steve melt down at the phone call, but still, the super soldier wished he could have spared Peter ever knowing.
Her phone chimed again. A call from Peter’s school.
– but it was pretty much all Steve had.
“Of course, Madam,” JARVIS chimed back immediately, and Toni knew she’d done well programming him, but damn if he actually sounded haughty as he turned her playlist on at low volume.
It had taken the better part of a month before Jim had felt comfortable letting her out of his sight, again.
“And what is it that you need to do exactly?” Tony asked acerbically, changing position in a way that looked non-threatening, but brought him subtly closer to them. “Turn a national icon into Cap-on-a-cob? Promote equal-opportunity threatening between the youth and senior citizens alike?”
It was like his transformation all over again, and going from living in a reality of black and white, to suddenly being able to see all the colours in the world.
“Yeah,” the blond agreed softly, simple happiness lingering with the contentment he was always filled with whenever he was with Tony. “I never really got to appreciate it before now.”
Not entirely false.
Hope you all enjoy the fluff ahead! <3
The ark reactor looked like it was little more than a disk against her chest, but even though Steve knew how invasive it was, he couldn’t help finding it stunning. It was, despite all its faults, the thing that was giving Toni life, the thing that had brought her to him instead of losing her before they’d even met, and no matter what, Steve simply didn’t have the ability to think of it as anything less than amazing.
It was against her better judgement, but Toni couldn’t help herself as she used shaky fingers to turn her helmet back on. The extra light illuminated the small space once more, throwing her injuries into sharp focus, and if there was anything to be grateful for, it was that the kid looked exponentially better. She’d done her best to shield him during the collapse, but bruises would have been impossible to identify in her first cursory check. Now, though, hours had passed and Maico still looked healthy and unharmed, if a little restless in his sleep the longer he stayed under. It was probably nearing time for him to wake him… how long had they even been down there, already?
A high-pitched whine that was quickly becoming familiar reached his ears a split second before a potent blast of heat took out the remaining four guards at once, before they could reach for their guns and fire at him all together.
Things had simply grown from there. Natasha had not only gotten proof that Toni Stark was the furthest thing from what her report had suggested, but she’d also gained an ally. And then a friend. And then a confidante.
What she hadn’t counted on, was her father’s willingness to get physical with her even as an adult.
On that note...Coming up is the daring rescue and the epic, much anticipated reunion! ALL THE STONY FLUFF!
“He went down alright?” Steve asked in a low rumble from Peter’s doorway. He was laden with an armful of new plush toys; this time, the rest of the Avengers to go with the Iron Woman and Captain America that the little boy was currently snuggled up with.
Give him a hard time? Yes. Definitely yes. Try to make things a little easier on him? Not a chance.
It seemed like an entire age had passed before she choked out, “A hundred percent.”
It made her wonder, for the first time in long years, whether there was any truth to the magic her mother had told her about.
Halfway through the song, Peter’s breathing evened out, and though she knew that he was asleep, Toni still finished the lullaby. She vaguely recalled her mother explaining, once, that the lullaby was magic, meant to imbue a mother’s love and protection to her little bambina. At the time, Toni had been but a baby girl herself, and yet even when she knew better, the lullaby had always made her feel safe and loved. She hadn’t yet explained the meaning of the words to Peter, in the way that her mother had, but it seemed to have the same effect on him.
Steve had always loved to watch Tony’s mind at work. It was a thing of wonder, like getting to see the absolute inner workings of something so complex and advanced that you knew you’d never be all the way caught up to it, but could revel in the work of art that it was anyway. And revel he did, especially in those moments when Tony forgot he was there and his hands became a blur of motion as he manipulated diagrams and shot through calculations with a speed that surpassed even JARVIS’.
, to what they are now, with Howard,” Fury said, and if Toni didn’t know any better, she’d say that he actually sounded regretful. Compassionate, even. “If I’d known, I’d have left you and Rogers out of this.”
Steve felt something solid and heavy drop into his gut, making his stomach churn. In the weeks after that battle, he’d gone off the grid, attempting to reconcile his past with his present and also chase down some closure on the time he had lost by trying to reconnect with old friends and familiar places. It was only when he’d realized how pointless an endeavour that was, that he found his way to the Tower and into Toni’s – their – home. By that time, the negative publicity must have died down, because he hadn’t heard anything about it, but the thought of Toni ever facing so much hatred and vitriol without ever telling them how long she’d been doing it for them… it made him sick.
They still had a few hours, but Toni knew it was coming. It was like a looming wave just waiting to wipe them out.
Of course, nothing ever went that smoothly for him.
behalf; not aimed at him, and certainly not meant to belittle him, but in defense of him and the respect she thought he deserved.
“Put the fear of Captain America in them?” she teased as he got closer, moving her arm slightly to test the stitches. They held admirably, but hurt like a sonofabitch, as she’d known they would.
Since he hadn’t directed the question at anyone in particular, the AI answered. “My sensors are unable to detect a telecommunication signal from the iteration of the suit currently occupied by Miss Stark,” he answered promptly, but not without a phantom heaviness to the words. It didn’t surprise Steve when he heard the telltale sounds of Bruce’s breathing techniques and the low cussing from Bucky.
He turned as she came into view, and even though he smiled, Toni could read the concern in his eyes. “Come to co-pilot?” he asked teasingly.
“Well,” Bucky nodded once at them both, “I’ll let you two get back to your conversation. I have a gorgeous girl genius to find.”
of your problems, Stark.” Red coated the edges of his vision and he wanted nothing more than to beat the man in front of him into a bloody pulp; not least of all for the last straw, which was his slight towards Peter, but for the beautiful woman who he was so in love with, who he now realized had been hurt unforgivably by a man who Steve had been stupid enough to call his friend.
It took considerable effort and time to find his feet on his own, but once he had, Steve forced himself to be the team leader that he was. Within a few moments, the Avengers had established a plan to attack the mysterious blue creatures, whose source was still unidentified, and everyone was dispersing to their position. The lack of any sound from Tony was still jarring, though, not just to Steve, but seemingly to everyone. For a brief moment as he fought, Steve fleetingly thought that he would do just about anything to hear his best friend’s voice.
It was only after meeting Toni that she realized she wasn’t the only person in the world who didn’t fully know how to deal with love.
That snapped his attention to where the reporter, who’d spewed all that filth about Toni before, was now honed in on the little family of two. The way Rhodes’ spine stiffened, he knew enough of Spanish to understand what she was saying, too, and Steve started towards them to put an end to the slanderous words against his girlfriend. There had been enough times when he’d been forced to sit back and watch as the press tore into Toni just because she made herself an available target to protect everyone else, and he wasn’t about to let that happen again. Not now, when she’d done what he would have never had the strength to let her do, if he’d been given the choice. Not now, when she’d risked everything to do the right thing and save an innocent little boy.
“I wonder if you asked for this, or if Ob--if it was a suggestion you went along with. Did you even want an omega?” Tony inched forward. Steve didn’t move, his eyes steady on Tony’s face. “Maybe you didn’t. Maybe that’s why you’re not more, uh. Insistent. That would be okay. I can stay out of your way.” Tony had never been great at being unobtrusive, but he could damn well learn. Picking up the language would keep him occupied for a couple months, at least, and after that he’d--start polishing all the swords, or something. If they would let an omega touch their swords. “What are your feelings on omega-designed weapons? Just wondering.”
He was a Stark. Starks were made of iron. Tony squared his shoulders, facing the tent flap with his chin held high.
“It’s a biological imperative.” Banner fidgeted with the hem of the shirt Stark had looted for him from a crushed vendor stall (after tucking a hundred dollar bill under what was left of the cash register), stretching it out while he explained. “A way of, ah, ensuring reproduction with strong mates, so you have a better chance of healthy babies. It also solidifies command structures and defines mated groups.”
. Steve’s eyes widened and his scent went volcanic. “Yup, that’s a big yes, that’s, holy
with his hands. “Come on, let’s go.”
“Assuming you have no objections, of course, Master Stark,” Jarvis said demurely.
nice with his free hand that made it a bit hard to concentrate, but he made the effort to reach out and pat Banner’s knee, reassuring rather than lascivious. “You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. Victory heats are intense. Sometimes it’s too much. You’re welcome to stay and watch, if that’s all you want.”
“Well,” Bruce said eventually. “That was more intense than I expected.”
“Pleasure’s all mine,” Steve replied, his voice already blurring with sleep. He was distantly aware of Thor picking him up and carrying him to the bed some time later. His packmates rolled in around him, their blended scent heavy and soothing, and Steve let his awareness drop with a feeling of perfect safety.
done this before, and was the kind of person to be curious about anything new. Steve’s blood rose a little in response to Stark’s interest, to the challenge in his voice. Anticipation fizzed through him.
Tony had to shut his eyes while he came. Watching Steve watch him was too much, unbearably intimate, while he was so exposed. His breath came in harsh pants that he couldn’t seem to slow, and every stroke of his hand made his inner passage throb and clench around nothing. The smell of Steve’s completion filled the air and left his senses swimming. Even when his hand slowed to a stop, he kept his eyes closed, trying to regain his equilibrium. He was startlingly close to tears again, of relief or gratitude or who knew what, but he refused to let them fall. Starks were made of iron.
After a moment of deliberation, Steve slid a hand down to frame Tony’s belly, his broad fingers spanning the soft skin under Tony’s navel. His other hand moved to cradle the back of Tony’s skull, and then they were kissing.
“Oh, sure,” Tony said, talking fast in a futile attempt to cover his nerves, as though Jarvis of all people couldn’t see through him. “He’s a great folk hero, as long as he’s raiding someone
“Call it, Cap,” Stark said, hands in his pockets, his ambivalent posture belied by the restrained eagerness in his voice. Stark probably
want to start their...relationship, whatever form it was going to take, by having their first interaction while he was blubbering and naked on his knees. That seemed like a really bad precedent to set.
Steve smiled at him. His scent had mellowed into something drowsy and satisfied, but his eyes were still attentive on Tony. He dipped his head before he spoke, the tone of his words pleased.
unacceptable. His tone was low and rumbling and he was still lying on his back.
It gave Tony a sick little thrill to snark at Stane now, when he was protected from the casual backhand the words might have gotten him in other circumstances, but only because bruising him would be an insult to the Captain.
“Sure did.”
“Hush.” Romanoff kissed his temple, then rubbed her nose in the short hair already drying beside it. “You think your body count is any higher than mine? You still have a long ways to go before you’ll match me, little bird.”
It was a tactic Steve would be wise to follow himself. He focused his attention on Thor, on the glide of Thor’s cock inside him and the buzzing each stroke sent up his spine. Neither of them tried to hold back, letting their bodies rock together faster as they climbed closer to the peak. Steve came first, quietly, mindful of his teammates sleeping only a few feet away. They all deserved rest. Rest, and respite, and whatever pleasure Steve could bring them.
him made him realize that at some point he’d started to get wet, and that was. Perfect. That was just fantastic. Leaking for an alpha who’d barely touched him was a great way to establish a sense of dignity and cultivate respect, because nothing said “please take me seriously and treat me like I’m not just here for you to fuck” like getting slick when he wasn’t even in heat.
Steve approached him slowly. Tony did his best to keep his eyes on Steve’s face, since he hadn’t been reprimanded for it yet and Steve kept looking right back at him. It was strangely intimate to hold eye contact for so long. Steve barely blinked, all of his concentration on Tony. Tony swallowed with the effort not to look away. Steve’s steps were silent on the thick rug lining the bottom of the tent, and Tony could hear his own breathing quicken once Steve was in arm’s reach.
To everyone who stuck around this long, thank you so much. Your support means everything!
Steve didn’t seem to mind him talking. He looked up at Tony, smiled a little, and went back to his work. His palm moved to Tony’s shoulder, one hand holding him steady while the other worked the rope free, slowly enough that the friction from the silken ropes didn’t scrape uncomfortably against Tony’s skin.
Steve bucked his hips up again, fucking into his fist as his thighs flexed and stretched, and Tony groaned as his toes started to tingle in sympathy. “
Steve let him sit up the next time he tried. He looked at Tony consideringly, then reached down to slide a fingertip between Tony’s legs, just touching over his entrance.
Steve smiled again. It was a nice smile, small and soft, and it lightened his whole face, softening the stern lines by his mouth. Tony concentrated on his face and ignored everything happening in the region of his pants.
“Okay. Not being scared. I can work on that.” Tony eyed Steve. “It would be easier if you weren’t so, y’know, giant and muscley. Just a thought. I guess there’s not much either of us can do about that. You could--lie down, maybe?” Tony made a tentative hand motion, holding a hand up straight, then tilting it to the side, leaning to the side himself to demonstrate.
, Steve realized belatedly. His instincts flipped from from murder to enthusiastic welcome fast enough to leave him dizzy. He’d been trying not to think about his absent packmate--
“Ah, should we--” Banner said from the doorway.
“Look, it’s not my fault you’re interesting to look at,” Tony told him sanctimoniously. “I’ve seen plenty of men shirtless, don’t get me wrong, you don’t grow up in the city center without learning which windows offer the best view of the courtyard where the guards practice in the summer, but those shoulders are something else, seriously, your
than he had looked when he was sitting at the negotiating table, tall enough for his head to brush the tent ceiling, broad enough that the distinctive shield on his back was only visible in thin crescents on either side of his chest.
“You’re it,” Stark said, breathless but smug, before jumping down.
And then, when his absence was discovered and the Captain realized that Stane had broken faith, the people in his city would have been the ones to pay the price.
Still, there was such a thing as
The Captain might come to regret his bargain, no matter how difficult it would have been for him to secure an omega otherwise, once he got to know what Tony was actually like. All he’d seen of Tony so far was a glimpse across the room. Stane had made sure to have Tony visible in the hall where the negotiations were being conducted, so the Captain and his people could see what was on offer. No sense in buying without inspecting the merchandise first. Tony had been kept away from the main table where the alphas were talking, of course, but the Captain had given Tony one look--one measuring, focused sweep that had knocked the air from Tony’s lungs--and then kept his eyes to himself for the rest of the negotiations. Tony wasn’t sure whether to take that as a good sign, or a very, very bad one.
Tony looked down at his body, at all the exposed skin on display between elaborate frames of rope, and thought that conversation was probably not destined to play a large role in his relationship with the Captain anyway. Maybe not being able to understand each other would be more of an advantage than a drawback. Tony’s mouth got him into even more trouble than his mind, and if the Captain couldn’t understand him well enough to be annoyed at what he was saying, Tony would probably be safer. Not that he couldn’t find some way of disappointing the Captain anyway. It seemed to be Tony’s specialty.
“So.” Tony sat up, wincing and rubbing his back. “That happened.”
Steve tilted his head back to watch, wanting to see if anyone took him up on his offer, but as soon as he looked away Natasha let go of one of his wrists and raked her nails over his chest. It was barely hard enough to sting, but it was enough to make him refocus on her. If she wanted his attention, she could have it.
“See?” Natasha dragged Clint onto the mattress like he was a training dummy, dropping him into a stack of pillows before lounging sideways across his lap. “They’re doing fine.”
, I don’t understand what you want me to do.”
Banner clearly hadn’t done this before either. Steve tried not to smile, not wanting it to seem like he was laughing at him, although some of his amusement probably showed. “You won’t.”
, said the analytical part of Tony’s brain that never really turned off, automatically calculating the difference in heights now that Tony was kneeling and the Captain was standing. The rest of him was too busy panicking to pay attention.
Stark appeared in the doorway, arms folded, still naked and with dripping wet hair. “You have something against bed frames?”
Steve eyed him critically, then pulled his cloak off the rearing horse statue and draped it over Tony’s shoulders. Before he could check his instincts, Tony pressed his nose into the lining, inhaling Steve's scent. He caught Steve flaring his nostrils and flushed before turning away and clearing his throat.
The tent flap lifted, and the Captain stepped through.
anything.”
“Okay,” he said quickly, pushing the tent flap back and squinting into the daylight. “That takes care of clothes for today, at least. Eventually you’re going to need your cloak back, though, so at some point I should get some real clothes of my own.”
“As if I could stop you.” Tony wanted to hug him. He held himself back with the promise of doing it later; they would have time, now, if Jarvis was accompanying him, and after taking Steve’s measure last night, he wasn’t afraid that coming along with them would get Jarvis killed. And Jarvis was already fast friends with Sam, apparently. “What about Stane?”
“No,” Bruce said meditatively, his hand still stroking in the same steady rhythm. “Not unless you had to be.”
“Hey,” Stark said sharply, “no secret side conversations in my Tower. What’s going on?”
“So you’d like biscuits?” Steve said, not rocking back an inch when Tony elbowed him half-heartedly. “You should eat something. It’s going to be a busy morning.”
He took a deep breath and sank under the water. The pressure felt good on his skin, with his scrapes already closed and the new skin tender and just barely stinging. A quick hard pulse of warmth spread out from his abdomen, a sign that his heat was moving from a simmer to a boil. He ignored it for now and gave his hair a vigorous shake to dislodge the built-up dust and debris. A brisk shampooing and a quick scrub of his hands over his body left him feeling much cleaner, with the constantly circulating bathwater carrying away most of the grime that had been stuck to his body.
have muscles. Plus I might get to touch you at some point, so it’s different, and where on earth is your body hair? Don’t you get cold?”
Steve swallowed carefully, not wanting to get the bathwater dirty, before resurfacing with a gasp. Clint was looking up at him with a gratifyingly stunned expression. He reached out and traced two fingers over Steve’s lips, which were swollen and tingling from the stretch and the heat of the water.
“That’s
“Bards have a flair for the dramatic. Perhaps the servants’ tales are closer to the truth.”
“Tony?” Steve said. Tony blinked and looked up at him. He’d gone still in the middle of the floor, looking uncertain.
“I daresay he’ll learn to manage without me,” Jarvis said, sounding supremely unconcerned. “Lord Wilson, if you could show me where I might stow the rest of Master Stark’s things?”
“Shit, I guess I am,” the archer agreed, an easy grin on his face. “I’m Clint, and you know what, you’re going to do just fine around here.”
“Good morning to you, too.” Tony sat up with his blanket clutched around his waist, abruptly self-conscious again. He’d managed to forget about his nudity last night, but the light of day was filtering through the tent seams, reminding him just how much there was of him to see under the blanket. “Are there clothes around here somewhere that I could borrow?”
. His previous sorrow and rage over his brother’s crimes had been genuine, as immediate and forceful as his pleasure was now. Steve watched Thor’s eyes close in clear rapture as Steve rolled his hips and thought he understood. Thor lived in the present; what else was there to do, when he had a history weighty enough to crush him if he dwelt in the past?
“Then go ahead. You can come a little closer, get comfortable, and I’ll stay right here. I won’t grab.”
Steve knelt again, right in front of him this time, and put his other hand on Tony’s chest, where the ropes met in an open circle centered over his breastbone. The hand at Tony’s jaw held him still while Steve mapped out the ropes with his fingers instead of his eyes. Tony finally had to close his eyes, the sight of Steve’s face only inches away too much to take combined with the heat of his palm and the light brushes of his fingertips over bare skin. He was pinned in place by that dual touch. Even if the ropes had disappeared, he would have stayed right where he was, kneeling under Steve’s hands.
They landed hard on the heap of disordered blankets, both of them laughing. Steve crawled over Stark on his hands and knees. Stark arched his hips up to grind against Steve’s stomach and then they were kissing, panting too hard to be any kind of coordinated but returning to each other’s faces over and over, laying warm lip prints on flushed skin.
Steve lounged back in the water, spreading his arms against the tub’s sides to bare his chest. “So quit gawking and get in here.”
This kiss was different. Steve pulled away to lick his lips after the first startling contact, then came back with his mouth warmer and wetter. His hand in Tony’s hair controlled the angle of Tony’s head, keeping him tipped back, his jaw loose and his throat bared while Steve pressed in close. Tony could barely breathe. Steve wasn’t being rough with him, wasn’t biting or bruising, but the contact alone was enough to make Tony’s lips tingle, blood rising to the surface and making his mouth even more sensitive. When Steve finally pulled back, Tony could only gasp for air, looking up at him with astonished eyes.
“I’m not really enjoying being the only one naked, here, let’s go for something more balanced. Can you take your tunic off?” Tony mimed pulling a shirt over his head. Steve caught on immediately, rolling up enough to pull his tunic over his head by the hem. He tossed it towards the tent flap to land near the rest of his clothes and laid back down again. “Good, thank you. And wow, shoulders. Congratulations on those.”
He’d learn a lot from this night about how the Captain intended to treat him, at least. When he cut the ropes off, would he be careful, or would he not mind if his new trophy acquired a few scratches? Maybe he wouldn’t even bother to take the ropes off before he fucked him. There was nothing blocking access to Tony’s entrance, it would be easy enough to roll him onto his chest and knees and just plunge in.
“What do you think,” Tony said, spreading his bare arms out to his sides. “Am I decent?”
ago if Howard and Stane had just
too much clothing. The laces at the front of his pants gave way under Steve’s insistent tugging, and Thor obligingly lifted his hips so Steve could push the material--not quite fabric, not quite leather, and Steve would be interested to look at it in more detail some time when a fresh wave of heat wasn’t urging him onwards--down past his hips.
When the last of the rope gave way, it was immediately replaced by Steve’s hands. Tony held still as Steve rubbed gently at the tender skin of his wrists. Steve said something brief and low-voiced before releasing his hands and rolling Tony onto his back, keeping him centered in his lap.
Tony fisted one hand in Steve’s tunic and pressed the other against the carpet, not sure if he was trying to steady himself or to keep himself from grabbing onto Steve directly.
“You’re sweet,” she said, and pinched his nipples hard, both at once. He bucked up and she rose up with him, riding the movement of his hips and working her hand over her clit, eyes slitted but still open as her body shuddered with climax. She’d always be watching him. If he misstepped, if he overextended, she would be right there to correct him, unafraid to tell him when he got it wrong. The certainty and the
Steve either ignored his request or misinterpreted it, because when he got up, entirely unself-conscious about his own nakedness, he went directly for the tray of food someone had left at the tent flap. He came back and set the whole tray onto Tony’s lap.
. He leaned in and bit the top of Thor’s shoulder, not hard enough to bruise but not gently, either.
“Is your choice?” one of the Captain’s men, the stocky archer with blond hair darker and scruffier than the Captain’s own, had asked when they met Stane's procession at the edge of the camp. He’d been the one to translate during the hand-off earlier that day when Stane’s men had hauled in carts of treasure, Tony riding behind them like an afterthought. He’d looked at Tony, not Stane’s men, when he asked. “You come willingly?”
recorder, I don’t need yet another sex tape leaking, but data collection, data collection is important.”
,” Steve said, deep and rough, fervent enough to be halfway between a command and a prayer.
Tony huffed and settled his head back down, but reached between them to wrap a hand around Steve’s cock. It only took a few firm strokes for Steve to spill over his fist. The pleasure was almost incidental compared to the satisfaction of Tony’s come inside him, and the new certainty he’d gained about how to work with his most outwardly abrasive teammate.
“Now would be good,” Steve said absently, his mind working through the ramifications of this new development, shifting course from containment and clean-up logistics to dealing with a victory heat. If he’d been back with his old team, he would’ve known how to handle it. Scout out a safe location, post half his men on watch, rotate them out in pairs so everyone had a chance to enjoy the celebration, and burn through his heat hard and fast so they’d be ready to move by morning. He’d done it with the commandos a few times, after particularly successful raids. They’d had a system. They’d all known what they were getting into.
Bruce nodded slowly, eyes a little abstracted as he sorted through whatever evidence he’d just collected. “I’d like very much like to kiss you, if that’s okay.”
Stark was a civilian, Steve reminded himself, and bit back the quick retort that wanted to spill out. He opened the collar of his uniform instead, undoing buckles until the tough leather gaped open over the scent glands at his neck.
