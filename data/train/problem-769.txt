“Yeah,” John said, turning the journal so Sherlock could read. “
Lucy walked up to John. She put her nose out, sniffed his hand.
At the hotel, Sherlock propped himself up in a chair and attempted to look up something or other on his mobile, but he was bleary and disoriented and nodding off over his own hands. John tugged him out of the chair and over to the bed that Sherlock hadn’t even glanced at since he’d walked into the room. Sherlock made little disgruntled noises, but curled up on the bed nonetheless.
“I know,” John said. “But I should’ve been. I could have helped, Sherlock. I could have…”
“Right,” John said. “We’ve got to work on your bedside manner, I think.”
“We were moving into a flat together,” John said. “After only knowing each other five minutes. Surely
John was nearly certain he was hallucinating, but if he was, it was a detailed hallucination. John found himself mesmerized by Sherlock’s bare neck, stretched along the pillow and seemingly calling out to him. The pale skin hugged and dipped at the lines of Sherlock’s throat and along his Adam’s apple. John could see the little spot of skin that sat over Sherlock’s pulse, how it undulated with each thrum of blood through his veins. John couldn’t help but wonder what the skin would feel like against his lips, his tongue—the soft skin just above Sherlock’s collarbone, the vulnerable, thudding skin over his pulse, the rough skin where little dots of stubble were starting to form along the line of his jaw. The blankets slipped slightly off Sherlock’s chest, revealing even more skin to be explored—bare collarbones and shoulders and the very top of pectoral muscles. John’s cock gave a twitch and he considered that he had only been awake for two minutes and already life was supremely unfair.
“Yes.
?” John asked. “
Lestrade cleared his throat, stared into the dregs of his pint. “Listen,” he said. “It’s a good thing you and the missus got things all patched up. What with the baby and all.”
“Possibly,” Sherlock said, tapping his fingers against his lips.
Sherlock said nothing. He waited.
her.”
“Do I remember?” John asked, jerking his head to the side, gesturing at someone absent. “The other me?”
As if reading his mind, a car appeared at the end of the drive, pulling slowly, almost reluctantly, up to the cottage. John could spy Sherlock behind the wheel, his face blank. John’s fingers went numb on the wine bottle and he nearly dropped the damn thing.
“Got it done yesterday, actually,” Mary said.
“Yeah,” John snapped. “You left me at a crime scene in the middle of bloody nowhere. No cabs. No bus stops anywhere near. In the bloody rain.”
“I’m not even asking about the kids and suburbs part,” John said. “That bit isn’t for everyone. It’s not even for me, I don’t think. But love? Is falling in love asinine as well?”
Sherlock turned to consider him. “I know,” he said.
“Sounds reasonable,” Sherlock said.
take and give,
“That’s not exactly it,” Mary said, “and I think you know that.”
“I owe you an apology, John,” Sherlock said. His voice was so quiet that for a moment John wasn’t sure he heard it at all.
“Have you ever caught a werewolf before?” asked Conor. He stared up at Sherlock with unapologetic admiration, a look that John recognized from some of the earliest photographs taken of himself and Sherlock.
Sherlock wrapped his hands around John’s thighs, gripping his shaking legs as tight as he could, guiding himself. He moved slowly, slightly, withdrawing just a bit and pushing forward into John. John muttered a quiet curse and pushed back, moving himself gently against Sherlock. John nodded.
“No,” Sherlock said. “That jumper is a crime against sighted individuals. I find
“Right,” John said. “Right.” Suddenly, breathing was a challenge. A real challenge. The slow-motion panic attack had finally kicked into high gear. “God,” he said, pushing himself away from the table, popping to his feet so quickly he nearly knocked everything over, including himself. “Right. I’d best be going, then.”
After fielding a few arguments and minor foot-stomping (most of which came from Sherlock), John managed to get the both of them dressed and headed to the park. Rosie adapted quickly to the change in plans for the afternoon, singing to herself and skipping along in front of them as they walked down the street. The weather was clear yet chilly, and Rosie looked nearly twice her width dancing through the street in her bulky winter jacket and pink cap.
“Sherlock,” John whispered. His voice was raw. The fire spit behind him.
if that isn’t somehow the sexiest thing you’ve ever seen.
There was a pause. John heard Sherlock’s fingers still on his mobile.
He snorts into his drink, nearly spitting the whole thing out.
The two walked along the path, the Cró rising up beside them. The path was narrow and more than a little precarious, with the steep incline of the Cró on their left and the sharp drop into the water on their right. There wasn’t room for them to walk side-by-side on the path, which John was perfectly fine with at the moment. He would rather steal glances at Sherlock’s back than have to gaze upon the blank slate of his face for another second.
“Speak as if you’re smiling.” Sherlock demonstrated, waving a dramatic hand over his mouth. “
Sherlock glanced down at John’s hand once more, shaking lightly as it held his weight on the mattress. He lifted himself onto an elbow, his head complaining at the movement, and reached out for John’s hand. John shifted, allowing Sherlock to slip his palm underneath his and bring his hand closer for inspection. Indeed, John’s knuckles were red and torn, traces of blood still visible in the cracks of skin.
“My condolences,” you say. You figure that he’s the only person in the whole of the city who is happy that a bank
Sherlock pressed his eyes closed. “Yes, but…”
Sherlock sighed, shifting himself over in bed. He tossed the blankets to the side. “Get in,” he said.
“What do you expect him to do after you’ve gone? How do you expect him to carry on?”
Sherlock tore at John’s clothes in pieces, ripping his jumper only partway off him, yanking at his belt until it was open and dangling in the loops, tugging at his flies with enough force to rip the fabric, trying to push his pants and trousers off him all at once. John still had his bloody shoes on and Sherlock had far too many clothes on altogether. John pushed at Sherlock’s jacket and fumbled with the buttons on his shirt and barely had the top half of Sherlock undressed when Sherlock’s hand wrapped around John’s cock and John forgot how to do anything except breathe, and he seemed to be doing a slapdash job of even that.
Sherlock’s face was still, but John could detect traces of worry around the corners of his eyes. “You’ve got the gun on you?” he asked. “Declan’s?”
John washed up as quickly as he could and munched on a piece of bread while he donned whatever remained from the clean clothes he brought. He hoped that they would catch this sheep killer sooner rather than later, before one of them would need to attempt doing the wash in a sink. John certainly wasn’t willing to attempt to wash Sherlock’s posh clothes by hand, and something told him Sherlock wasn’t about to put forth the effort either.
to. What is even the
“Difficult to describe,” Sherlock said. “And quite idiosyncratic.”
Sherlock, of course, had chosen not to liaison with the local police.
John thought,
The only sounds to be heard were the rustling of the wind, the lapping of waves, and the occasional bleat of a sheep.
John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s neck, tugging him down to meet his mouth. “You’re in bed with a leprechaun, then.”
“Wow,” John said. “Yeah, I didn’t know.” It seemed a bit odd that she hadn’t mentioned this prior, given how much she talked about what a terrible person her ex was. It would appear Gilly and Sherlock had more than a little bit in common regarding how inconsequential they found death at times.
“Oh,” Sherlock said, “rough night on the town.”
John’s brain fell silent.
John sighed. This sort of thing was a bit more commonplace than he’d like. “C’mon, then.” He tugged Sherlock back towards the loo.
Instead, he took Sherlock’s hand and tugged him towards the car. “C’mon,” he said. “Let’s go be murdered.”
“Except Declan, you mean?” John asked.
John laughed, the sound lifting onto the wind and dancing with the rain. He clutched at Sherlock, holding him tight as the seals filled the beach around them. The raindrops thickened, drawing little circles on the pale sand, slapping against the backs of the seals. John only laughed harder, only held Sherlock tighter.
By the time the two reached the first floor, John had worked up a fair sweat and had cycled through what sounded like every plausible curse in the English language and may have invented some new ones. Sherlock remained mostly silent, reasoning this to be his safest course of action at the moment. At this point, Sherlock was essentially carrying John up the stairs, just with the single arm wrapped under John’s armpits, which was the least efficient way to carry any grown man. John’s ill-placed sense of pride was not doing them any favors. Sherlock hauled John up the final step and the two paused for breath, John resting his one good foot on flat ground.
Sherlock was silent.
we’ll give you a seat, we’ll listen to you.
“You said that at my grave.”
of cinnamon and pine
John could feel his light start to grow dim. That burning feeling was back, although it was starting to be replaced with an exhaustion so heavy that John considered simply lying down on the roof and waiting for the police to come arrest him. A night in jail somehow seemed less depressing than going back to his little flat, alone.
and secrets—they age like fine wine.
,” he said, and the word felt as if it came from somewhere deep inside, every molecule coordinating to speak just the one thing.
“More,” he gasped. “I need more. Sherlock. Now.”
Sherlock’s gaze shifted to the side. “Are you looking for an exact number, or more of an estimate?”
“Holmes,” he repeated, a bit louder than necessary given their purposes. “I asked you a question. Are you ignoring me?”
“No,” Sherlock said. “I was lonely. That’s all. I was mistaken.”
The man doesn’t have anything close to a twisted lip at the moment—everything on him is all right angles and his lips look like something you might fantasize about later, hand in your trousers—but you know what blokes can do with a little makeup.
Sherlock lowered himself over John’s body, a spark of mischief in his eyes. “With pleasure,” he said. The bed creaked beneath him.
John grinned at him. He shook his head. “Dirty man,” he said.
“Good,” the man said, and released John’s chest. The man tucked the gun back into his waistband, covering it with his shirt. He heaved himself towards the side of the boat and grabbed at a rope, starting to haul up the anchor. “Start up the engine,” he belted to his mate. Steer us closer.”
“And when you learned of Moriarty’s supposed return,” John said, “what did you feel then?”
.” Sherlock spun John, pushing him down into sitting on the mattress with a single hand to the chest. “A bed is a bed. And this bed is much closer. And, if I’m being honest, much nicer than yours. Besides…” he gestured to the adjoining door to the bathroom, “a much less arduous journey to the loo, wouldn’t you agree?” He flipped on the little lamp on his bedside table, flooding the room in a warm glow.
The descent may be treacherous, lonely, and long,
“I do try my best to excel at my work, John,” Sherlock said.
He tried for his toes next. This proved more difficult. Toes are smaller, harder to wiggle. Still, they seemed present. His lower half was warm. Something was resting gently over him. Not oppressive, just warm. No need for concern. Probably.
happiness, anyway.”
“I’m irritable and obsessive and mad.”
When John turned back towards Sherlock, Sherlock was doing a poor job at keeping the little smile off his face.
But the man isn’t listening to you anymore because Black Jacket opens a narrow door—the kind that leads to the flats above the storefronts—and steps inside. The man jogs after him for a moment, but comes to a halt as the door clicks shut, hiding Black Jacket securely from view.
Keeping his eyes open was near impossible with the way Sherlock’s breath tickled at his skin. Sherlock’s lips had moved up to John’s ear, and each of his whispers was making John shudder. Sherlock’s hand paused just at John’s hip, resting along the tip of his trousers. John was concerned that if Sherlock moved his hand any lower he would make a rude discovery. John very much wanted Sherlock to move his hand lower.
“Sorry,” Gilly said, not seeming very sorry at all. “Not very much to be done about that, I’m afraid.” She twirled her knife in her hand. “I have to say, I’m feeling a bit smug at the moment. The great Sherlock Holmes never once suspected me to be the killer. Not even for a second.”
Sherlock lifted his head, looking up at John with cloudless eyes. He stroked at John’s mussed hair, lifting a bit of grass from his temple. “Come now,” he said, mischievous grin back on his face. “We’d best get cleaned up. After all, we must look presentable for the werewolf.”
Sherlock was
bows thrown and broken strings,
? I thought he was…” She paused, pressing her lips together. “I mean, I didn’t think he was interested in…”
“It was, Sherlock,” John said. “I was the one who initiated things. That first night, the other week. That was all me.”
“No,” John said, “they’re not.” He gathered a bit of the curry on the spoon and lifted it up for Sherlock. “Taste this. I’m trying for the chicken dish at Old Delhi’s that you liked.”
John said. His brain was spinning ever so slightly, and he could still taste Sherlock on his lips.
Sherlock shushed him. “I am merely of the opinion that having a thunderous conversation while trying to remain hidden from any potential burglars is quite counterproductive to our purposes,” he said.
“Christ, Sherlock,” John cried, bucking against him. “
“That you were the man with the lip?” you ask. “The other day on the Tube?”
“I should’ve been there,” John said. “In Serbia. With you.”
Mary raised her hands up at her sides.
“Keeping quiet,” John whispered. “And not getting shot.”
“Touch?” suggested Sherlock.
the St. Clair Bank Robber. However, seeing as they are dreadfully wrong and I am—as per usual—exactly right, I have a feeling it’ll all work out in the end.”
John blinked at Sherlock, his head spinning. “The sheep,” he said.
“Perhaps,” Sherlock said. He stepped off the sofa and onto the coffee table. His fingers were pressed over his lips. “Regardless, a large piece of this mystery would have been found in those missing pages.”
“They were both having an affair,” Sherlock said. “It’s for the best, really.”
Sherlock leapt off the coffee table, sitting himself on the wooden surface just across from John. “Did you say Taibhse?” he asked.
His lips are curled into that little smile again. “Everything about you gives it away,” he says. “The way you walk. The way you carry yourself. The way you remain vigilant, scanning each scene for things out of the ordinary, potential dangers. The way you guard yourself. Shields up.” He shifts forward, moving ever so slightly closer. “The way you
“Why become engaged to a woman you clearly don’t love,” Sherlock said, “a woman you can barely stand, a woman who means so little to you that you haven’t even noticed that she hasn’t called you in a day and a half? Why are you so eager to leave? Is living here in this flat with me so terrible that you’ll snatch up the first opportunity to flee that comes along?”

You find yourself able to do little else besides blink. “What?” you say again.
him in you. He adds a second finger and there’s a burn and a stretch and that full-body nerve-scream that tells you it’s too much, too much. He’s stretching you open and his other hand is still on his cock, near flying now, and you can feel him as he moves, you can feel him in every way but the one you need. His fingers disappear and you wobble, unsteady.
John smiled. The corners of his moustache twitched upwards, brushing at his cheeks. “Good,” he said. “Now. When you look at me, what do you feel?”
He was moving the hell on.
“God,” John moaned. Sherlock’s body was a rock against his. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s chest, pressing his mouth between Sherlock’s shoulder blades. Sherlock didn’t move. “I’m so sorry, Sherlock,” he said. “I didn’t know. I should have known. I shouldn’t have hit you. I should have…” he shook his head against Sherlock. There was so much he should have known, should have done. So bloody much.
John felt something in him start to slacken, unravel. “I…” he started, “I didn’t…”
“That you would rather allow a serial killer to go on murdering innocent people than to have even a single soul believe that you and I are
Oh, you can’t criticize this clever disguise, it’s
John hitched his legs around Sherlock’s waist and Sherlock’s hand drifted down his side, along his hip, over his buttocks and lower, dipping into the cleft of his arse. John felt the tip of Sherlock’s finger brush against his hole and a moan broke free from somewhere deep inside him. Sherlock stilled, lifting himself slightly off of John so he could look down at him, collecting data as his finger circled slowly, softly. The ache was so strong it was like a physical pain.
Art by
You keep your sleeves rolled up for the rest of the day.
“I’ve been an arse to you,” Sherlock said.
John’s words were tearing at his throat, his voice coming in odd and scratchy. “I can’t break that vow. No matter what I feel. I’ve been an absolute cock of a husband so far, but...it has to stop. I have to do better.”
It was when he flicked on the light in the kitchen that he saw the note.
Sherlock plucked the notebook from John’s hands. He flipped through a few pages. “
“I don’t,” John said. “I promise you.”
“So,” John said, surprising himself at the flutter of nerves flickering in his stomach, “you are under no obligation to—and honestly, with how I’ve treated you, you would be within your rights if you just walked away from me right now. But, god, Sherlock. I have loved you so much and for so long, and of course I’m sure. I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. And all I want—all I’ve ever wanted—is to be able to show you, in whatever way you’ll let me, just how bloody much you mean to me. You don’t have to. And god knows you probably shouldn’t. But, Christ, Sherlock—if you’ll have me—”
Fitz—tail flying through the air—brought the bit of wood back to Sherlock in his teeth, wiggling and grinning.
In the storage closet. Declan wouldn’t have needed sheep feed. The sheep don’t need to be fed. The O’Sullivans said it themselves—they are self-sustaining.”
“It does,” Sherlock said. “The universe is inconceivably large, constantly expanding. It has no beginning. No end. It is infinite, in the true sense of the word. And within it, our planet is so small as to be negligible.”
), but it isn’t long before you can’t think of a goddamn thing except how fucking beautiful this man is on his knees in front of you and how he’s sucking your cock like he’s some sort of prodigy. Your hands are in his curls (
“Mr. Holmes?” the voice on the other end of the mobile asked. “Are you in danger?”
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Please,” he said. “At least I’m not so foolish as to chase after a ridiculous concept that has caused nothing but strife. Nothing but failure.” He gestured at the journal again. “Nothing but
“A few differences,” John said, his voice growing thick. He wrapped a leg around Sherlock’s waist and pushed back—ever so slightly—against Sherlock’s fingers, bringing Sherlock’s touch that much closer to the center of him. “You were behind me, like the first time. You had me up against a wall.”
“A bit catatonic today, are we?” John asked. His eyes were the color of water. He hovered over Sherlock, shining down at him like the sun. Sherlock could feel himself sucking John in, absorbing his light, feeding on him like photosynthesis, taking what John gave and turning into something greater. Sherlock’s lone cell twitched.
“Decided to come to bed, then?” John asked. His voice was heavy with sleep. His eyes remained closed.
“Yeah,” John said, feeling the corners of his mouth twitch into a smile. “He was.” Sherlock could have made up some story here, contrived some fallacious yet real-sounding scenario for how the two of them met—locked eyes at a pub, took the same tube to work each day, were matched up on an internet dating website—but instead he went with the truth. It was charming. John could feel the ball of lead in his stomach blessedly start to shrink.
In front of you, a small hallway. You turn to either side, gun steady in your hands. Nobody. You move to the left, inching slowly along the hall, your back to the wall.
The two of you skip the pretense of a nightcap.
“I will.” Sherlock kissed him once more, a gentle, slow press of lips to lips, a goodbye that was no longer meant to be permanent. “Happy anniversary, John.”
. He shook away the thought. He rolled onto his back, closed his eyes.
“Yes it does,” John said.
. Dismantling the security and sending his drone in.”
“Of course you will,” John said.
Sherlock explained to him.
“Uh huh,” John said. “Um. Is this what the two of you have been up to all day?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock slipped down from his elbows, lying flat on his back at John’s side. “Was I?”
“There wasn’t enough room in the kitchen,” Sherlock said. “I’m testing the speed of skin dissolution in various mixtures of acid. There is a wide spectrum to assess.”
that she never truly tamed.
Right then, John thought, following. Business as usual. No more mooning at the scenery and grinning at each other. And certainly no more touching, at least for the moment. John did his best to ignore the little throb of disappointment he felt at the notion.
The two of them lapsed into silence. The seal-heads bobbed in the water in front of them. Waves rolled onto the shore, soaking the sand in froth only to slip back out into the sea again. The occasional bleat of a sheep could be heard in the distance. The grey clouds lumbered towards them, sending wet-smelling wind in their wake.
protect me,” Sherlock said. “And it protected more than just me. Alone was the way it had to be. I wasn’t wrong about that. What I was wrong about was how much it would ache.”
“Indeed,” Sherlock said. He flipped through the next few pages of the journal. His curls were nearly brushing against John’s face. John could smell the posh scent of his shampoo.
John chuckled. He ran a hand up Sherlock’s chest, letting a finger brush over his nipple. “I’ll do my best,” he said.
“You’re a
it had crossed his mind. Earlier in the evening, he’d considered not telling her about the stag-do; he had been drunk, it was a year ago, and he’d spent most of that year not remembering it. Not really lying, that. Still, the thought of a lie that big made him sick to his stomach. He couldn’t have lived with himself, he knew. And after tonight—well, there was no way he couldn’t confess to this. This was too big, this was intentional. This was infidelity, plain and simple. This made the other lie, the stag-do lie, look like a little joke in comparison.
“I don’t care,” John said. “You’ve got me so bloody turned on I can’t think.”
I am. Believe me. But also believe me when I tell you that I would give all of this up,” he gestured towards his head with fingers gone red from splinters, “
Sherlock’s smile faded further. He shook his head against John’s hand. “I can’t,” he said. “It’s not safe. Not yet. I shouldn’t even be here right now.”
Sherlock said nothing. He bent forward, blowing gently at the budding flame. The kindling crackled and a line of smoke emerged from the smoldering bark. Soon, the flame was larger, tickling at the wood teepeed just above it. Sherlock remained on his hands and knees in front of the fireplace, monitoring the progress of the flames. His face glowed gold in the light and the flickering shadows from the fire traced well-defined lines down the angles of his body.
Sherlock risked a glance at John once more before raising his hands to his shirt. He looked back down at the mattress, at the floor. “I’ll just…”
You glance down at your shirt. Indeed, there are a few tiny dark patches from the sink, barely noticeable.
He’s not watching the match either. He’s shamming.
—Maurice O’Sullivan,
Sherlock pulled John upright, shifting back onto his heels and guiding John down onto his cock. They were wrapped up against each other and John could feel Sherlock’s heart pounding through his ribcage. It felt as if it was shaking the whole of his body.
I find I lose my words.
“Indeed,” Sherlock said. “Given the fate of the previous caretaker, I wouldn’t be surprised if our criminal tried to kill the both of us, should we stand in his way. He certainly isn’t dissuaded by getting his hands a bit dirty. Quite literally, it would seem.”
“Huh,” John said. “Seems like Declan was expecting a bit more action on this island than tending to the sheep.”
. A few pages were dog-eared, but it didn’t look as if Declan had read much of it. John lifted a little notebook and flipped through the pages. Scrawling handwriting—Declan’s, John assumed—filled the book.
He tried to move his limbs. Legs first, for no particular reason. He accomplished something that might technically have been a gentle flop, the kind of movement a fish makes just before it dies in the pelting sun of a dry harbor. He tried again, but this time the fish was dead.
Sherlock studied John with an expression that John couldn’t quite read, which was a bit unfair given that Sherlock existed entirely in John’s mind. “I knew that you needed me.”
“Seriously,” Mary said. “What the hell are you two doing? I specifically told you not to come looking for me. I specifically said to let me handle this on my own.” A look of worry flashed over her face. “And who is looking after Rosie?”
John quirked his head to the side, his gun still trained on Will. “Not sure that’s yours. Pretty sure that belongs to Declan Moore.”
Sherlock didn’t respond for a moment. John began to wonder if he had chosen not to respond at all. “I suppose I ought to be flattered as well,” Sherlock said finally. His eyes were pointed out the window.
“You lads be in touch if you need anything,” she said. “Or if you find anything out. You’ve got enough food to last you the rest of the week, but if things take any longer than that you’ll need to make another trip to the mainland to get stocked up on supplies. Give us a call if you need to get back any sooner.”
“Were you ever romantically involved,” Mary repeated, “with Sherlock?”
“Well,” John said. “You can keep your observations about my clothing to yourself.”
Sherlock’s eyes twinkled, a glimmer of mischief. “I’m not sure you want that, John.”
“For the record,” John said. “I’m not just passing through. Moving back to Baker Street.”
“Well,” a cheery voice said from the other side of the room. “I see you’re both awake.” John turned his head towards the sound and saw Gilly propped up in the corner of the room. It appeared as if she had exchanged her gun for a very large knife. She looked overjoyed. “Now we can finally get down to business.”
“You don’t need to keep me safe, Sherlock,” John said. “I can handle myself.”
“No John,” Sherlock sighed. “Like a person. A human person.” He hopped back up on the sofa and began closely examining the photographs. “Somebody very intent on ending the lives of several sheep.”

“—is alive?” John asked.
John paused in the middle of pouring saline onto a strip of gauze.

Sherlock shook his head. “Abysmal. The R sound is
John grinned. “I’ll take it.”
Sherlock’s mobile buzzed. Sherlock flopped to the side, reaching for the mobile where it lay on the nightstand with a blind, floundering hand.
“I fail to see how your lack of ability to sustain a romantic relationship has anything to do with me.” Sherlock said.
You turn and walk back the way you came. You are halfway to the Tube stop before you think to wonder just how,
John nodded.
Sherlock had been the thing on top of him, John realized. When the explosion happened, Sherlock had flung himself over John, shielding him from harm with his own body. John felt something inside of himself twist.
in the pictures. So
“Breathe,” said Sherlock. “Breathe, John.” But Sherlock seemed as if he were having trouble breathing himself, his body shaking atop John’s, panting through a barely-functioning mouth.
This bit of town had seen better days, with the red bricks of the buildings fading into brown with age and the stones on the streets tilting into uneven tripping hazards. There was abandoned scaffolding along a few buildings, and more than a few windows were boarded up, promises of restorations that seemed unlikely to ever occur. There weren’t as many cars or pedestrians in this part of town—for good reason, John supposed—and the place had a still and slightly ominous feel to it. The faint rush of traffic could be heard, as well as the din of someone yelling in a nearby building. Someone had a radio playing, and a crackly voice could be heard crooning out the melody to an old song.
The waiter brought over their plates and they picked at their respective meals in silence. Sherlock, John knew, didn’t eat much on a case, which John figured was the reason for Sherlock’s plate remaining full well into the meal. For John’s part, he was experiencing a concerning case of something that felt an awful lot like butterflies in the stomach, which made little to no sense. The wine—finding itself mostly alone in John’s stomach—seemed to be going to his head faster than usual. John felt warm and happy.
Sherlock shrugged. “Our success rate thus far has been at a hundred-percent,” he said. “All pieces present and accounted for.”
Sherlock raised his head, his chin resting on John’s chest as he caught John’s gaze. His blue eyes were clear, incredulous. “How?” Sherlock asked.
wrong, John.” Sherlock spun to face him, his arms swinging and nearly knocking a nearby tray of surgical tools to the floor. Molly scurried over to steady the sharp instruments. “It’s a fifty-fifty choice. It doesn’t matter whether you stay with your original door or switch.”
Sherlock shook his head. “That’s not—”
with just your calloused hands.
“It’s for a case, John,” Sherlock said. His voice came back to him funny, a prerecording. Sherlock is not available at the moment. Please leave a message.
“I’ve done a considerable amount of wrong,” Sherlock said. “I shouldn’t have blamed you. I shouldn’t have implied that you were the one who...started everything. That wasn’t accurate.”
Sherlock had reached over to him, taking over the responsibility of removing the grass from John’s hair.
The chair said nothing in response. The flat was empty. Sherlock was dead, had been for over a year now. Not even the imaginary Sherlock that John had spent the better part of the day talking to could be arsed to show up at the moment. John carried on talking anyway.
” the man cried. “I didn’t mean anything by it. I didn’t know you had a gun.”
John saw Mary’s face recognize the noise. Her eyes went wide, her face tightening and paling. He dove for her, trying to push her down, away from whatever was about to happen. She scrambled out of his grasp, darting to the other side of the room before he even understood she was gone.
it all is.”
Sherlock seemed unconvinced. “Isn’t it?” he asked. He popped out of his chair and started down the hallway. “Best go pack. Suppose I should keep physical proximity at a minimum until absolutely necessary.”
notice that. He hoped Sherlock would solve the case quickly, before they had to make multiple trips back to the mainland for food. John didn’t exactly feel like being seasick that frequently.
“True,” John said.
*           *           *
“Git.” John chuckled. “I’m fine with physical affection. Hugs and things like that. I get a bit squidgy about it in public, though.”
. For our purposes, however, I believe Declan is referring to the Taibhse Brothers.” He slid a finger along the journal—still sitting in John’s lap—as he read.
On the playground, the game of tag petered out, the children ambling away in their separate directions, some of them returning to their parents. Rosie broke off from the group with another child—a boy, roughly her age. They seemed to be merrily chatting away about something or other.
. Single-celled organisms don’t require much praise. They don’t do anything particularly spectacular except not be dead. Sherlock could, at least, do that much. But only barely.
Sherlock’s smile faded. “I have to go,” he said.
“And what you feel for me,” Mary continued, “
“You are mine,” Sherlock growled. “I intend to be the only thing you’ll need again.”
Or what about,
body is still coming back.”
“Right,” John said, still feeling like the lowest form of human for asking Sherlock to protect his wife, his family. “I’ll tell her to come back to London with us. With me. Whatever sort of problems she’s got, there’s no good in running from them. That’s not how problems work—you can’t just run from them like some bloody coward. You face them. Especially when you’ve got people around you willing and able to fucking help you.” John saw Sherlock’s eyebrows lift. “I’ll work on softening that last bit.”
“What,” John asked, “the hell is happening?”
“Couldn’t tell,” Sherlock said. “He was in all black. Ski mask covering his face.”
*           *           *
“You’re a doctor,” he says, waving a hand at you, “
“Right,” Mary said. She sat at their kitchen table, watching him shed flakes of dried mud all over their floors. “You realize you didn’t call?”
John was drenched in sweat. The whole of his body felt on fire, throbbing, needing. His fists had white-knuckled grips on the blankets and he was shaking, shaking so hard from the effort of keeping still that he was sure the mattress would start creaking under him soon.
Sherlock’s hand shot out. He grabbed at the empty air. He forced his eyes open, searching for John. John caught Sherlock’s hand, perching on his knees just in front of him. He had that
“I see that,” John said. “Didn’t answer my question, though.”
Sherlock moved the head of his cock around the rim of John’s hole, teasing. “You’ll keep quiet?” he asked.
“Really?” John asked, a little grin spreading over his face. “Even after all that
“The city can burn,” Sherlock said. “You’re the only thing worth coming back for. You’re the only thing worth saving in the whole of this damned world.” John could feel Sherlock shaking on top of him. Sherlock’s hand was in his hair. “I would do anything to keep you. I would crawl through any hell you set in front of me. I would light myself on fire. I would rip my heart from my chest if you asked me to. All for you. Unquestionably.” He shook his head, his wet curls rubbing against John’s forehead. “And of
. But Sherlock’s hand was rough and fast on his cock and he barely had the ability to breathe, let alone speak. John reached behind him once more to grab at Sherlock’s hip, fingers digging into the tight muscles of his arse. The two of them were growing slick with sweat and burned like the fire downstairs never quite could. Sherlock ground against him harder, faster, each stroke of his body sending an accompanying breath that shuddered across John’s neck.
Sherlock cast him a pitying look. “Oh John,” he said.
“A couple,” John said, finally finding words. “You and I. We need to convince the killer that we’re a couple.”
He shook his head.
“You have a particular way you progress with the murders,” Sherlock said, his face transforming back to normal—bored, almost. “Methodical. Ritualized. Typical of serial killers. However, us being a unique pair, I imagine you’ll have to change things up a bit. How are we feeling about that?”
“Uh,” John said. “Yeah. Fairly serious. We’ve been together for nearly a year now. Seems to be going well.” Mrs. Hudson’s dubious expression made him feel the need to double down on his assertions. “Really well.”
John exhaled, and his breath was already shaking. “And if I did?” he asked. “Want it, that is?” He felt a tremor run through Sherlock’s body. Sherlock’s arms tightened around him and a puff of air—small, gasped—drifted over John’s neck. And if John shifted back ever so slightly he could feel it—Sherlock’s cock stirring against him, pressing against his arse. “What then?”
John pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes and sighed. It felt as if he learned something he was never meant to know, something he could now never forget. What in the hell would he do when this case was solved and he and Sherlock returned to Baker Street, to their separate rooms, to their normal lives where they were decidedly
They carried on kissing until the candles burned out.
“Christ,” John said, running a hand over his face. “Mary. What am I going to do, Sherlock?”
The darkness seemed to be intensifying by the second, and John had to focus quite a bit on keeping the light on the path in front of him, not wishing to trip over a bit of ruins and go careening down the hill. He could just barely make out the little white puffs of sheep across the field in front of him, let alone any shape that could have been Sherlock. He understood why Claire encouraged the two of them to let the daylight dictate their work hours; getting anything accomplished in this darkness seemed impossible.
, soon to be followed by

“And be careful,” Sherlock said. His eyes looked earnest, concerned.
“Christ,” John muttered, rubbing at his eyes. “I’d really hoped we were past this.”
“It’s all right,” John said. He rubbed at Sherlock’s arm, his hand. “You’re all right.”
“I’m a quick study,” Sherlock said.
John certainly felt like Sherlock was more than a little devil at the moment.
John was worried about him. John wasn’t alone, either—it seemed everyone had taken up the hobby of being worried about Sherlock these days. Mrs. Hudson was worried, Molly was worried, Lestrade was worried. Sherlock reasoned that Lestrade had the biggest reason to be worried—Sherlock hadn’t taken on any cases as of late and, as a result, Lestrade’s career would suffer. Sherlock hoped the whole ordeal would teach Lestrade that he ought to be a more competent detective inspector and not rely on Sherlock all the bloody time. Sherlock wished, more than nearly anything else, to be left alone.
As he spoke, Sherlock stepped forward, crowding into John. John found himself turning, his back nearly pressed into the slope of the Cró. He could feel the long grass tickling at the backs of his legs.
John called out to him. “You finished up in—”
Mary, however, seemed to very much understand.
,” said the other.
John exhaled with a burst of noise. “It’s all right,” he said. His voice was tight, rough. “Can’t help it. Keep going.”
for your safety, back away.
John stared down the empty road, willing their rental car to materialize. His mobile buzzed. He nearly dropped the bloody thing as he scrambled to answer it, but it was Gilly, asking him something or other about a June wedding. He didn’t answer her. His brain was on fire.
John considered that it made absolutely no sense for his mouth to start watering at that. His fingers tightened in his hair.
And John’s legs
“Sherlock.” John stopped again, fingernails digging into wallpaper once more. “Please. Let me keep the single shred of dignity I have left. I beg of you.” With that, he heaved himself up the ninth step and up onto the landing. The two shifted on the landing, and John stared up at the remaining steps in front of them. His shoulders slumped.
“I know,” John said. “I wouldn’t want you to work like that.”
“Alright,” Mary said. “So you found me. And apparently it was a walk in the park.”
“We just so happened to have an extra portion of linguine ready in the kitchen,” he said. “Nice and fresh, don’t you worry. I remember you liked this dish, always ordered it when the two of you dined here.”
“Her fiancé was just as bad,” Sherlock said, clicking on his page. “In this picture he claims he bench-pressed two hundred pounds when in fact it was no more than one eighty-five. Here he is posing with a car he doesn’t own.
“Do tell me more about what it means to
too far.”
Sherlock pressed his forehead against John’s. His breaths were heavy on John’s face. They smelled of alcohol. The ground was hard and rough against John’s back. It tore at his jacket. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock. Just behind them, Appledore was burning to the ground, the nothingness its vaults boasted receding into ash. The fire turned the air boiling. Everything was aflame.
“If you’ve already picked the door with the car,” Sherlock continued, “you shouldn’t switch.”
Lestrade shifted his gaze between the two of them, tongue poking at the side of his cheek. Finally, he shrugged and waved them on their way. Sherlock, of course, refused to go to A&E, so they took a cab home to Baker Street. John kept Sherlock’s hand in his for the entirety of the ride back.
“Or in this case,” John said, “how he stalks
“It hasn’t been an hour yet,” Sherlock said.
Judging by the pictures, there looked to be a lot more than five, but on closer inspection it appeared as if Sherlock had multiple photographs of the same sheep, just from different angles and distances.
“Yes it is.”
he was warm, all of his blood inside his body where it ought to be. “At Barts. When you fell… You didn’t…” It was an obvious question, but John felt he could never get enough confirmation of the fact that Sherlock was standing in front of him.
, but it was the truth, at least part of it. As far as he knew, his relationship with Sherlock was fine. It was John who was going a bit wonky, who needed to take a moment to get his head right. If not, it would be more than just his relationship with Sherlock that might suffer.
“Sherlock,” he said.
, how I wanted you all the same.”
Sherlock’s eyes remained locked on John’s. John was absolutely, categorically,
,” John repeated.
Sherlock was up, balancing along the exposed floorboards as he paced, looking more than a little like an acrobat as he moved along the slim pieces of wood, fingers under his chin.
Sherlock, John knew, loved to be peppered with questions, provided they were exclusively about his own brilliance. His dramatic sighs and exasperated looks at wide-eyed admirers were not particularly hard to see through.
I broke my arm when I was young—
John, in fact,
John nodded against him.
“That even so much as
for helping me understand the Irish health care system!
in their lazy little ways.
Slowly, John raised an arm, draping it over Sherlock’s, clasping Sherlock’s hand in his. He waited for Sherlock to pull away. Sherlock remained still.
Mary smiled at him, and it seemed to match her eyes. “Of course you do,” she said.
An hour or so later, John heard the scrape of wheels in the driveway and nearly leapt out of his seat. He was still on the same page in his novel as he was an hour before, but he had managed to send Sherlock a series of what could clearly be interpreted as increasingly desperate texts. Dashing to the door upon hearing Sherlock return didn’t exactly make John look any less desperate, but he couldn’t be arsed to care at the moment.
Sometimes you stay for more than a pint. Sometimes a pint turns into three or four. Those are the nights you leave the barstool, looking to pull. Even three or four pints in, you can be charming, and it doesn’t hurt that you can tell who else is out searching for a good time. Drop a hint that you also happen to be open to a one-night stand or a blowjob in the loo and it’s surprising how lucky you can get. It’s not exactly fulfilling, but it’s something to do. You try not to take anyone back to your place if you can swing it, and you’ve stopped telling people your name. They just forget it half the time, and them never knowing it in the first place makes that a hell of a lot less depressing. You keep to dark places, keep your shirt on. People tend to have reactions when they see your scar. It’s a bit of a mood killer. It is, you suppose, what it is.
“In public,” John repeated. His brain seemed to be skipping a bit on the thought of Sherlock kissing him—however fake—in public.
Mary asked John if he wanted to provide input on the facts she wrote down. John told her he trusted her to write the truth. She did.
Sherlock furrowed his brow at John, but John seemed mainly to be talking to himself.
John studied her hair. He wasn’t sure he could tell the difference. “It looks nice.” He narrowed his eyes at her. “Is this what that was all about? That I didn’t notice your hair?”
, and Sherlock vaguely wondered if he might lose consciousness from the lot of it. The world was flickering out of existence, little bursts of white and black at the edges of Sherlock’s awareness. Sherlock was making sounds, a lot of sounds, it would appear, but he couldn’t hear himself, could only feel the rumble in his chest, the burn in his throat. John’s mouth.
“Come on,” John urged. “Fuck me.”
John allowed himself an unabashed stare at Sherlock’s body as it was slowly revealed—the long, pale chest that lay beneath his slim shirts, the lean, strong legs sheathed in his tailored trousers. John was more than a little pleased to see that Sherlock’s cock was already starting to grow plump, lifting ever so slightly from his body as he peeled his pants to his ankles.
You ruin my experiments—
The man looks back at you. There’s a flash of irritation in his eye, as if you are keeping him from his busy schedule of staring into space in a Tube compartment, but there’s something else there too. Something like amusement. “Problem?” he asks.
“Okay,” John said. He sounded incredulous, but his hand returned to Sherlock’s head, gentle fingers weaving through curls.
“You weren’t breathing,” Sherlock blurted. He gestured towards the water with a wild arm “There. In there. I found you and you weren’t breathing. I pulled you out and you still weren’t breathing. I cut you free and you weren’t…” He shook his head again, as if trying to dislodge a memory. “I had to breathe for you John. I had to breathe for you and it wasn’t working and you still weren’t breathing. I had to do chest compressions and I thought I might be hurting you but you still weren’t breathing. You still weren’t breathing, John.” Sherlock’s face was breaking apart. His cheeks were wet.
When he arrived back at Baker Street after meeting her—nearly a full two hours after he left to do the shopping—Sherlock took one look at him and rolled his eyes.
“Don’t,” Sherlock said. “If you turn around, I’ll kiss you. I won’t stop kissing you.”
“Ever get the sense that he was hiding something?” John asked.
” Sherlock said. He was flushed and shimmering and his arms were shaking.
The scent was delicate and odd—
“Neither will your officiant,” Sherlock said, unlocking the door to 221b. He glanced back at John’s blank face. “You’re meeting with your officiant this afternoon, remember?”
“Could you tell that from his handwriting as well?”
“You just told me Sherlock asked you to be his boyfriend,” Gilly said. A fat tear rolled down her cheek.
John swallowed, a thick, painful thing. Sherlock was right, goddamn him. Of all the women John dated over the past few years—and there had been several—he couldn’t recall being particularly happy with any of them. Some of them were good for a laugh or two, and they were all certainly nice. Decent people, the lot of them. But at the end of the day, he was never
The couple behind them laughed again, the sound reverberating through the small restaurant. John watched an urge for violence dance over Sherlock’s face. He smiled, reaching across the table to rub at Sherlock’s wrist. Something about the way Sherlock looked when he was plotting bodily harm to another person was unnervingly sexy. Sherlock shifted his hand, slipping his palm into John’s and squeezing lightly.
“I remember,” John said.
“Well,” Darren said, “guests are due back on the boat in fifteen minutes. What do we do if…” he waved a hand, “whatever you two are expecting to happen doesn’t happen?”
“Yes,” John said. He nuzzled at Sherlock’s cheek, his face a sleepy smile. “I think I’m going to have to make you come again soon. No way around it, I’m afraid.”
John thought.
Sherlock, grinning beside him, seemed to approve.
A corpse had been discovered in a skip that was missing all but one of its organs—its gallbladder, inexplicably, remained—and Sherlock finally decided that the case was worthy of his attention. He managed to locate an abandoned building at the outskirts of town that he claimed was a site out of which the black market surgeon used to operate. He insisted that he and John investigate the building for any leftover clues to the surgeon’s whereabouts. As it turned out, the building was very much still in use by the surgeon. As it turned out, it wasn’t just the one surgeon but rather a whole gang. And as it turned out, the surgical gang was more than a little perturbed to find Sherlock and John poking around their building. There had been a skirmish, a few shots fired, a brief chase, and now Sherlock and John were hiding out in a storage closet.
John fired once before the world went black.
I can be anything,
It was all Sherlock needed to hear. He took John’s face in his hands and brought their mouths together with violence. Care was best left for more certain times—today demanded urgency. John gasped against him and froze. For one terrible moment Sherlock thought he would pull away, but then John made a noise like he was dying and wrapped his arms around Sherlock in a grip from which Sherlock wasn’t certain he could escape. John’s lips parted and Sherlock felt John’s tongue move against his and he was tasting John,
Sherlock thought. It would hurt like hell, that no. It would be a bullet to the chest.
“Ah,” Hugh said. “There’s your boyfriend now.”
But as long as it’s consensual,
read the blog.”
“Anyway,” Sherlock continued, “my theory is that the killer does something to improve his ability to monitor the house. Perhaps he utilizes recording devices of some sort, or tampers with a window so he can sneak in and out. Regardless, we need to be sure to give him time—”
The cliffside shuddered. A large section of rock split off from the mountain with a crack, crashing down into the water below. The falls were slowly destroying the whole of the mountain. Soon, it would all be washed away.
He doesn’t have to work to get your mouth open and you let him explore while you fumble with his overcoat, shoving the bloody thing off his shoulders and onto a pile on the floor. You set to work on his suit-jacket. His clothes are the sort that need hangers, you know. They’re meant to be neatly folded and pressed, hung up just so. His suit-jacket falls into a crumpled heap on the floor. You need for the remainder of his clothes to follow immediately.
John cleared his throat. He tugged his hands away from Sherlock’s and worked the gloves off, tossing them into the trash. He pushed Sherlock’s shirt back up his shoulders and started working on the buttons, closing him up bit by bit. His eyes were still on Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock, fortunately, didn’t turn over. “Yes,” he said.
John’s legs were properly aching by the time they neared the westernmost tip of the island. Sherlock seemed to be slowing a bit as well, and John could occasionally hear puffs of heavy breaths coming from Sherlock’s direction. By this point, the wind was in full force, knocking against their faces unrelentingly. John blinked and squinted into the wind. His hair, he was sure, was a right mess. Even Sherlock’s seemed to be frizzing and wild—a first.
The blade that John was nearly certain was stabbing him seemed to be digging through his body, tearing him open bit by bit. “Yeah,” he said, his voice a touch less steady than he would like. “It certainly seems to be.”
“You being with her,” Sherlock said. “You being with any of them. It was maddening. It’s always been maddening. I knew I shouldn’t be so hateful. You didn’t feel for me the same way I felt for you, I thought, and I should be happy for you.” He tightened his arms around John. “But you didn’t seem very happy yourself, not with any of them. You seemed happy with me, and I didn’t understand. I didn’t understand how you couldn’t feel...something. For me.”
You’re really quite an arse, dear John
Sherlock stepped back, clearing his throat. He still seemed uninterested in eye contact.
“Have we not been honest with each other?” John asked. His eyes were exclusively on the jumper. He smoothed it over with his hands long after the wrinkles faded.
John did his best to make his face look the opposite of soul-crushingly disappointed. “Yeah,” he said. “Sherlock’s just...gone out. To get something.” Not very specific, that, but it was the best John could muster at the moment.
Sherlock stood just outside the cottage, chatting with Darren. His strop seemed to have passed, at least for the moment. Sherlock glanced over to Claire as she and John joined.
“An asinine societal tradition,” Sherlock said. “
You go about this thing you call your life now, a sad play at becoming mechanized. Up at six. A shift at the surgery. Sniffles and rashes and the odd case of crabs. Eat lunch alone. Have tea while staring into space. Have some minor variant of the same conversation you’ve had a million times over with the receptionist, something about the weather and the upcoming weekend and the traffic in the city. Your responses are rote and unnecessary. You could start speaking to her in Dari and she probably wouldn’t notice. Go home on the Tube. Maybe head to the pub for a pint if you have the energy. Maybe share a chuckle with another lonesome bloke about the dismal season of whatever football team is on the Telly, but probably just drink your pint in silence. Leave unnoticed. Have a wank if you think you can stomach the gut-dropping depression that sets in the second after you come. Don’t think about the gun in your drawer.
“Sorry about your mate,” John said, gesturing out into the field. “That was our fault, really. We should have kept a better eye out.”
“Yes. Wow,” John said, releasing her to adjust his tie. “It’s hot in here. And loud. Is it loud?” He pointed off to the side. “I’m just going to pop out—”
John laughed, despite himself. “Well,” he said. “I can’t get rid of it. It doesn’t remind me of you. It’s safe.”
Sherlock made a grumpy noise. He released his hold on John ever so slightly, but kept his arms around John’s chest. “That’s what I thought you’d say.”
Mary’s eyes widened and her laugh rang through the room like a gunshot. John felt the sound poke at what was left of his headache.
Sherlock’s fingers were back to their hellishly slow pace inside him and John had officially reached his breaking point. “You know damn well I do, Sherlock,” he hissed. “And if you don’t get your cock in me this instant we are going to have a row.”
John thought. He urged himself forward with the lovely thoughts of what he might do once he got his hands on the bastard. His legs pumped their way up the hill. Just a little more…
you?” she asked. “How could you get engaged to that
Sherlock leaned forward, bending John further and dragging his mouth across John’s in a barely-functional kiss.
“Over,” John said, pushing at Sherlock’s waist. He rolled Sherlock off him, pushing him onto his back on the mattress and climbing half-atop him. He slipped his hand between Sherlock’s legs, sliding two fingers into him with ease. Sherlock was sopping wet inside, filled with lubricant and semen, and he watched John feel him, watched him realize, watched his expression change to something possessive, predatory.
“This is all because your ex-boyfriend cheated on you?” John asked. “Seems like a bit of an excessive response.”
John reminded himself,
,” he snapped, pointing at her with the octopus dangling from his fist, tentacles flopping. “Not one word about Sherlock. Not after what he did for you. Not after…” The sentence died in his mouth.
Claire’s grin widened. “I had a feeling,” she said. She leaned forward, draping her arms over her knees. “Darren and I have been married for nearly fifteen years. Together for almost twenty. I know what someone looks like when they’re smitten with somebody.”
,” John said, attempting to wrestle Sherlock’s hands away from the keyboard. “I’m still working on that.”
“About three weeks ago.”
.” John pushed himself against the wall, his body meeting Sherlock’s thrusts with fervor. Sweat soaked his hair and dripped down his forehead and the whole of his body was shaking. Sherlock couldn’t keep his eyes off him—John was the only thing of interest in the universe at the moment.
ness. Sherlock considered how the brain processes olfactory memories differently than other memories. Regular memories—the stories one remembers about one’s first day of school and what an isosceles triangle is and how to get to the bloody Tesco—they all get stored in the hippocampus, the space in the brain meant to hold memories. Olfactory memories—the associations one has with smells, smells of rain and formaldehyde and cigarette smoke and a very particular brand of cheap cologne—they get stored in the amygdala, the space in the brain responsible for emotion. As such, these memories came wrapped in sentiment, with a bow of pain. Sherlock figured this was the reason why when he collapsed into his bed and smelled John on his sheets he felt as if his throat were being ripped out. He figured this was also the reason why just the memory of John’s scent was making his pulse quicken, his breathing stutter, his skin tingle. His cock harden.
“Well,” John said, dimly realizing that the whiskey was ushering the words out of his mouth, “you’re a fairly important thing that’s happened to me. It stands to reason I’d need some space to make sense of it.”
The question was just enough to startle John out of his memory. He wrapped one of the drawstrings around his finger, tight enough to hurt.
. Judging by the time of day, you are likely walking home from your surgery. A typical nine-to-five sort of job, so nothing particularly strenuous or gory, and one to which you are wholly indifferent. Low-severity, boring patients. Runny noses and the like. You aren’t used to thinking about them after the doors close behind you, so you must have seen something unique today. You seem more puzzled than disturbed, so it must have been something more humorous than tragic. Out of the ordinary, but not disturbing, and nothing so intensive as to make you stay past your time. Conclusion: somebody had something stuck somewhere, something they weren’t supposed to put in the place it got stuck.”
“We can carry on as we always have,” Sherlock said. “Sherlock Holmes and his friend and colleague, Doctor John Watson. We can act as if it never happened.” The words felt as if they were made of knives. Sherlock wondered if his throat would bleed from them.
They had turned wound-cleaning and dressing changes into a science at this point, but John still felt the need to ask for permission each time he undid Sherlock's shirt, as if undressing him was an intimacy that might cause Sherlock harm, which in a way it sort of was.
The inside of the cottage bore close resemblance to the photographs on the website as well, save for a few furniture updates. Hugh walked them through the ground floor, starting in the kitchen. The kitchen was bright and bathed in sunlight, ancient-looking table and chairs in the center of the room. Hugh pointed out the various antique appliances, each of which looked days away from breaking.

They were midway up the hill before Sherlock spoke again.
John thought, his brain spinning a bit,
“The roof,” Sherlock said. His voice sounded rough, tired.
“Look
John made a sound that wasn’t quite language. He scratched at the sheets.
” the street-preacher shouted to nobody in particular. “
John was certain he saw the corner of Sherlock’s lip twitch up into a little smile. He was about to ask Sherlock how specifically they were to be involved in these holiday home murders when a tiny knocking sounded at the door, followed by a cheery
John chuckled. Shook his head.
,” he said, jutting his chin in John’s direction. “Make sure he stays put. I’ll handle the other one.” He jerked his head backwards again, towards the island where Sherlock was likely making his way down to the harbor.
“So I suppose,” John said, “he wasn’t completely alone out here, then, now was he?”
You’re impossible to live with!
Sherlock was pressed next to John on the bed, the warmth of his arm firmly against John’s. His chin was nearly resting on John’s shoulder, and his curls brushed up against John’s ear. He smelled like soap.
Sherlock was flying.
Tonight, the stars seemed to be out in droves, overpowering the polluted glow of the city to shine on, little pinpricks of light in an inky sky. It was the sort of thing that could make a bloke dizzy, the way the sky towered above the tops of the buildings, reminding John that the world, in all its unfairness and defiance, spun on. John sighed and his breath drifted up towards the sky, a slowly dissolving cloud. The stars stared back at him—unblinking, beautiful.
“Are you ready?” Sherlock asked as he shut off the car.
“Not once,” John said, “have I called you that.”
Give and take,
Sherlock points to Black Jacket. “That’s him,” he says.
“You shagged,” Lestrade said.
“Still,” Sherlock said, running his lips along John’s ribcage, “I am receptive to any suggestions you have regarding how I might—”
as if you were smiling,” Sherlock said. “There’s a difference. No matter. Rs might be a lost cause. Try not to use any Rs while you’re speaking today.”
you can see each pathway through.
In the distance, Sherlock heard a rumble of what sounded like thunder. He furrowed his brow. He didn’t think it was meant to rain tonight.
John grinned at Sherlock. “You’re just upset,” he said, “because you know you’re wrong.”
“You moved my bedside table,” Sherlock said.
More knocking. “
Sherlock wiped at his face. He coughed. He pointed at the beehive, his hands shaking. “It’s fascinating,” he said. “Don’t you think?” His voice was thick and not altogether steady.
“And you’ll have to act like you can tolerate the very idea of being in any sort of relationship with me?” Sherlock snapped. “I’m sure you can manage it for a day or so, but if it starts giving you internal bleeding,
They wound to the right of the little harbor, moving towards the front of the island, where the land was about as flat as it seemed it would get. Claire led them along the divots that were worn into the grass, likely following the paths that tourists walked when they visited the island, or perhaps even the footsteps of the long-gone Islanders. As they moved further along what John gathered was the easternmost part of the island, they began to approach the stone ruins, shells of former houses. A couple dozen or so of the crumbling homes flanked the meandering paths, their rectangular husks all pointing towards the sea.
“Hello darling,” Gilly chirped. Her smile faded as soon as she saw him. “Everything alright?”
“Ah,” John said. “Well, you wouldn’t be the first person to think that.” In fact, it was the assumption that the blog-reading public collectively made—that the dissolution of John’s marriage and subsequent return to Baker Street meant that he and Sherlock were finally the item that seemingly the entirety of the city assumed they had been for years. At this point, John had fielded more questions than he could count about his presumed relationship with Sherlock, and Sherlock was always infuriatingly silent on the subject, relying on John to correct the assumption while growing storm clouds above his head. As such, John had grown a bit sick of correcting people.
“Right,” he said, setting his fork on his plate with a clatter. “I’m going to bed.” He rose, carrying his plate to the counter. He scraped the remaining food into the bin and set the plate in the sink. He would worry about dishes tomorrow; it was unlikely that Sherlock would clean up any of his mess tonight. He turned, leaning against the counter. Sherlock was still sitting at the table, his eyes on his plate.
Above the roar of the fire, John could hear helicopters approaching. Soon, they would take Sherlock away.
John blew at the tiny flames. “Your methods can be disagreeable.”
“I’m just saying, mate,” Lestrade said. “I’ve been there. You know. With my old lady. I know how it is.”
Sherlock was reasonably certain that he still remembered how to breathe, but he seemed to be doing it all wrong at the moment. His breaths were coming in shaking and small, and his whole body felt swimmy. He couldn’t reason, couldn’t think, could barely even bloody
,” Sherlock gestured around him, to the demolished bed, the room littered with stray bits of clothing, “wasn’t meaningless.” Sherlock hated how his voice wavered, how the burning in his throat was making it difficult to speak. “You know I'm right, John. You know it.”
The Great Blasket Island is fucking amazing and very cool to both learn about and visit, if you ever get the chance. I researched the ever living crap out of it for this fic, but naturally there will be things I get wrong and/or have to take a bit of artistic license with. Just…go on that journey with me, okay? Of course, if you notice any egregious errors about the Blaskets or Ireland in general, let me know (you know...in a nice way)!
I’ve got wicked schemes on my mind.
Hugh was smiling at them, a quirky, lopsided grin. “You lads made a handsome couple,” he said.
John considered that he might have been squeezing her hand a little too hard.
“We need to look for the werewolf,” Sherlock said.
“Of course,” Sherlock said. “In order to lure this serial killer, we must be absolutely convincing in our portrayal of a couple. Any whiff of falsehood could cause the killer to flee and we’ll lose our chance.”
John felt everything inside him clench. He thought his teeth might shatter.
The man touched at the spot on his waistband where the gun was hidden away, checking, securing. “Good,” he said. “We see you.”
,” John said, jumping in surprise and nearly knocking the clipboard from her hand. He glanced at Sherlock, who of course was not there. John wiped at his eyes, trying to appear like a man who was not about to break into tears in public.
,” she shouted. “
Sherlock insisted that Mary wouldn’t stop for long in Helsinki and made them push forward, driving straight up the country.
). Darren set her on the ground and she shook her head, re-acclimating herself to her island home. She spied John and took a step forward.
” Sherlock corrected. “
don’t. You might. Provided you don’t give me your gun in the next five seconds.”
“Yeah,” John said. “You never know. So,” he cleared his throat, “how come you’ve never told me—”
John’s mouth dropped open and he cried out, his eyes practically rolling back in his head. He pressed his arms against the wall, bracing himself as Sherlock began to fuck him with abandon, the sound of Sherlock’s pelvis slapping against John’s arse sounding through the dark of the alleyway. John sounded as if he couldn’t breathe quite right and Sherlock seemed to be having trouble with his breath as well, sucking in air faster than his lungs could process it, leaving everything dizzy and burning. He pounded harder into John, but it somehow wasn’t hard enough, wasn’t close enough. Sherlock felt as if he could crawl inside of John and it somehow still wouldn’t be close enough.
Then he followed, taking his first steps as a multicellular creature emerging onto the uncertain land, journeying forward into the light.
“Sherlock taking on any cases?” John forced himself to ask. He could not, however, force himself to make eye contact with Lestrade when he asked it, so the question was largely directed at his half-empty pint.
I must punish you quite thoroughly
Sherlock glanced around him. The street was fairly empty, but he still looked concerned. “If you could take care to lower your voice ever so slightly when discussing our plan to catch a serial killer…”
or greet me, “dear madam—”
John took another long pull of his pint. “No,” he said against his glass. “You?”
“Waters were rough,” Darren called. “Had to take it slow.”
The assistant had remembered the type of car Mary drove as well as which direction she turned when she pulled out of the station.
“We taste like each other,” Sherlock said, and rolled the both of them so John’s back was pressed to the earth, Sherlock laying half on top of him. Sherlock propped himself on an elbow, staring down at John with an expression John couldn’t fully fathom. He ran a hand along John’s face, stroking at his hair, cupping at his jaw. His eyes flitted over John, cataloguing and re-cataloguing and re-cataloguing again, making copies of all the data in triplicate. He took on a frantic look. His fingers were tight against John’s skin.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed, placing something similar to a kiss on John’s lips. Then he had John by the thighs and yanked John’s legs out from under him. John flopped backwards on the mattress, a surprised noise jumping from his smiling mouth. Sherlock grabbed the lubricant from the nightstand and slicked his fingers within seconds. He folded himself over John, one hand planted at John’s side and the other rubbing between John’s cheeks, circling his hole with a slick finger. John made a whimpering noise, spreading his legs and tugging at Sherlock’s arm. Sherlock slipped the tip of his finger just inside, feeling the tight muscle yield slightly. John gasped and bore down, taking more of Sherlock’s finger. Sherlock heard himself moan as John pulled him in, feeling the molten perfection of John’s body against his finger. Sherlock pulsed his hand slightly, crooking his finger gently forward, and John’s body bowed, a low noise escaping his lips.
to protect her. That’s what spouses do, right?”
“Glad we could do this,” John said to Lestrade, his voice raised over the din of the pub. “Feels like I haven’t been out of the flat in ages.”
Some of John’s mates and his colleagues at the surgery tried to be supportive of the divorce. They asked him to the pub for a pint, offered carefully-worded condolences in the hallways at the surgery. Spouted endless platitudes, trite nonsense about closing doors and opening windows and the multitude of fish in the sea. Two days ago, one of the nurses gave him the number for her friend, saying that the friend was single and just lovely. John had pocketed the number but had no intentions of calling. He had a feeling that he wouldn’t be putting down roots anytime soon. In fact, he had a feeling that—despite Sherlock’s biting little assumptions—he was on course to be alone for the remainder of his days. John had a feeling it was for the best.
Sherlock’s brow remained furrowed. “To ensure the safety of all that is important to me,” he said.
Hearts,
Sherlock smirked, and John could no longer feel the cold of the water on him.
cold out, after all—with his scarf tucked around his neck and his curls fluttering in the breeze. It looked so normal to see him that for a moment it was hard for John to believe that he wasn’t really there at all.
of those things,” Sherlock said. “I thought it was best that I stick to the most probable irritating qualities.”
“Exactly,” Sherlock said. “Now. Does someone leaving in a hurry have the time to schedule out an entire escape plan based on the roll of a dice? What if the dice told her she was to fly to Zambia? When do you think the next flight to Zambia out of London is? No, she would have chosen her next move based on what was immediately available to her.” Sherlock scrolled through his mobile. “The first flights out of Heathrow this morning were to one of only three cities—Paris, Amsterdam, and Frankfurt. That narrows the choices quite considerably, don’t you think?”
Sherlock shrugged. “Seemed like information you ought to know. So you could make an informed decision about becoming flatmates.”
“Isn’t that what friends do?” John asked. “Care about each other?”
Sherlock closed his eyes, a test to see if it would help with the spinning. It didn’t. “I’d never choke on my own vomit,” he said.
John sighed—this was the Sherlock he had grown to expect since he moved back to Baker Street. Unexpectedly irritable, with unpredictable trigger points that caused him to snap at John and sulk off into another room, leaving John blinking behind him and wondering what the hell just happened. True, Sherlock’s moods had always fluctuated, but these days they seemed particularly barbed, withdrawn. It felt at times as if there was a wall up between John and Sherlock, something unyielding and impenetrable.
John ruffled Sherlock’s hair, nudging him. “Budge up,” he said. “I’ve got to get her changed and fed.”
John lifted his bags off the ground. “I’m going to miss that bloody sheep,” he said.
“You have to forgive me, John,” Sherlock said. “I let what I feel get the better of me. I let it keep me from thinking rationally. I knew that I shouldn’t. I knew you didn’t feel the same. I knew that I shouldn’t proceed with my advances, and yet…”
He rolled onto his back, craning his neck to the side to peer at the video monitor they had set up to view Rosie in her cot upstairs. She appeared to still be asleep, flat on her back in the cot, one leg kicked to the side, both arms flung over her head. Rosie was turning into the master of odd sleeping positions, once managing to heave both legs up onto the side of the cot. She stayed as such, one sock dangling half-off her foot, for hours. Sherlock and John placed a wager on how long she would go on sleeping like that. Sherlock won.
“Who’s Toby?” John asked, following them up the stairs and into Declan’s room.
Of course, there wasn’t very much of a point to that, now was there?
saved it.”
“Spend time together?” Sherlock asked.
“Lestrade,” Sherlock said, standing to face John. “You were out for pints with Lestrade. Lestrade cleared the charges against us, so he knew. He assumed you knew too.” Sherlock couldn’t believe that, after all the months that had passed, this was the first time this fact occurred to him. He wondered if sentiment hadn’t given him some sort of brain damage.
“And we certainly weren’t
Sherlock blinked at his plate. “Thank you,” he said.
, said John.

“Sherlock.”
Sherlock said, slipping a hand into John’s.
“A game show.”
oh, I’m so glad it’s just us three!
rather than a man he’d once been naked with. John could still sense a spark coming from Sherlock’s direction every now and then, a lingering heat in his looks, but for the most part Sherlock seemed to treat contact between the two of them as if a simple touch might burn his hands. As such, there was a tenuousness to their relationship, if one could even call it that, and the whole thing seemed to be made of wafer-thin glass, prepared to shatter at the slightest of vibrations. John wasn’t sure if he ought to risk it.
“God, Sherlock,” John breathed. John reached behind him, grabbing at the nape of Sherlock’s neck with a fist. Sherlock wasn’t typing anymore, his palms flat against John’s chest. John’s breathing had grown a bit labored.
“Are you all right?” he asked, still not quite able to glance up at John’s face.
John tilted his head towards Sherlock, an eyebrow raising. “You’re at the center of it.”
,” John gasped. His voice was broken. The whole of his body was flushed, glistening under a sheen of sweat. “I need you to fuck me. I need you to fuck me right now.” It could have made Sherlock come on the spot.
Shout-out to
This case had been mad. It was an out-of-town case, one of those ones out in the country that always managed to be more spectacular than the city cases. There had been a missing girl and a murderous farmer and a batch of kids making drugs in a barn somehow. He and Sherlock had spent the night before hiding out in a bloody bog. It had been a lot. It had been tremendously exciting.
If John was being even more honest with himself—and he was finding that this second pint was only increasing his levels of honesty—he found that he didn’t much care. He didn’t care what Mary’s favorite color was or what kind of tea she fancied or where she had traveled in her life. He didn’t like the lies, but he didn’t like them on principle, the way he could dislike some dictator in a country he’d barely heard of without letting it ruin his day. He ought to be upset, he knew. He ought to be raging and infuriated and yelling at her nonstop, because to be upset with her meant that he
“It’s all right, love,” he mumbled, his tongue heavy with sleep. He probably didn’t even know he said it.
“Um,” John said, nudging Sherlock with an elbow. “I would say that Declan’s experience is the exception, not the rule.”
take the money off the island,” John said. He flipped through the remaining pages. “What do you suppose he did with it?”
Sherlock turned his head towards John. Sherlock’s eyes were swollen and his face was clammy and any anger that might have still fizzled in John’s body was unceremoniously snuffed out.
Sherlock said. His eyes were sharp, scrutinizing.
this…”
Sherlock was lying next to him, his face less than half a meter from John’s. He was bound in a similar state, his arms tight above his head, secured to the headboard. It looked as if he sustained a few blows to the face, with light bruising around an eye and a small gash on his cheek that had already clotted up.
“In case you were worried,” Sherlock said, “the rental company confirmed that the bed is, in fact, queen-sized.”
Lestrade’s brow furrowed. “You okay, mate?”
Sherlock shifted, making a move to push himself away, to gain distance from John. John caught his hip, holding him in place. He watched Sherlock’s eyes flicker with confusion, asking a question his mouth couldn’t voice. John swallowed. He rolled his hips against Sherlock’s gently, slightly, just enough to slide their bodies together. Sherlock’s eyes dropped closed. He moaned, a small, involuntary noise.
John missed him terribly.
“I’ve heard all your arguments,” John said. “I don’t need to see them in writing. What do you think of
And now I will say many words:
“I can see why you do this,” Mary said, pointing at the wall. “It helps to visualize.”
Sherlock smiled. He looked charmed. One would have to know him very well to know that his blinking—both in frequency and quantity—meant that he was a bit taken aback by the gesture. John couldn’t help but feel a bit accomplished—surprising Sherlock Holmes was no small feat. The feeling was undercut ever so slightly by the lingering scent of Sherlock’s aftershave on his lips, which was making John’s chest do a funny thing.
John could hear Mrs. Hudson filling the electric kettle, fiddling with the teacups. “He causes such a ruckus up here,” she said. “Sometimes I think he does it just to bring me upstairs so he’ll have someone to talk to.”
“I did indeed,” Gilly said. “How else am I supposed to keep track of everyone? I’m not exactly going to peek through the curtains, am I? Hugh will tell you that practice has its disadvantages.”
The remainder of the drive was silent, save for the pounding of John’s blood in his ears.
“Yes, mummy,” Sherlock called, tossing his mobile back on the nightstand. He tugged at a corner of the sheet and began to clean the both of them off.
, Sherlock.”
Sherlock found a pile of clothes burned in a field outside of Malschwitz. Mary was shedding her skin again.
“Your busboy is nicking the flatware,” Sherlock said.
“Making a pass at you,” John said, gesturing with his glass to where Sherlock had sat that night, where he currently was not sitting now. “That night. While we were looking for the serial killer. I
It’s been a lonely century
“How…?” John started.
“No you won’t,” John said. He shifted, setting his laptop on the bedside table—a perfect arm’s reach from the bed. The room fell silent for a moment, the only sound the soft slide of John’s fingers across Sherlock’s scalp. Sherlock could feel himself starting to slip away from consciousness, the world growing heavy and slow around him. John’s hand seemed like a well-worn blanket, the kind that children hug at their sides at night to help them drift off to sleep with a smile on their faces. The concept of security blankets had always been a bit perplexing to Sherlock, even as a child, but at the moment he saw the allure. He felt his hand steal around John’s leg, pulling him close at the knee.
John signed the papers.
Sherlock plopped down on the coffee table, his eyes burning into John’s once more. “
Sherlock figured there was a sixty-percent chance he was in a bed. His bed, probably. Those weren’t terrible odds, all things considered.
“Get it all sorted, then?” John asked.
I am spectacularly loud—
And then Sherlock’s mouth was on his, forcing his lips open, jaw practically unhinged as he didn’t so much kiss John but
John heard the rustling of the blankets, felt the mattress shift and squeak as Sherlock rolled over, moving onto his back to consider him. John tilted his head to the side and met Sherlock’s gaze. There might have been a reason, John realized, that Sherlock remained facing away from him through all this. Sherlock looked wrecked, his lips dented from his teeth, his eyes pink, swollen. The knife that had sliced John open was back, gouging into his wounds. Everything was red and wet.
So fine—she could be a secret assassin who lied to him constantly. She could saunter out of the house at all hours, not telling him where she was going or when she’d return. She could wear a face that was clearly worried about something and tell him nothing about it. She could leave him to care for their child during the entirety of it as she slipped away millimeters at a time. Fine. It was no bother to John.
The wooden floors creaked beneath their feet as Hugh walked them into the sitting room. A grand picture window lay on the far wall, but otherwise the room was lived-in and cozy, with a motley assortment of overstuffed sofas centered around a grand stone fireplace. Sherlock wrapped an arm around John’s back, pulling him in.
going to have a wank to Sherlock again. He had already broken that promise three times, and that number represented considerable restraint.
“John Watson,” Sherlock said, his eyes glowing green against the pale blue of the twilight, “I will love you until the day I die.”

“Good,” Sherlock whispered, and he wrapped his fingers around John’s cock, giving him a slow, soft stroke.
didn’t seem like a good way to start things off.
Mrs. Hudson floated into the room before either of them could ask her in. “Just checking to see if you boys fancied a cuppa,” she chirped. She frowned as she saw Sherlock on the table. “Sherlock,” she said, “didn’t your mother ever tell you not to climb on the furniture?”
My cellar is stocked with the shame of the city,
“Most often,” Sherlock said, “the host would offer the contestant a cash prize. Something like a hundred American dollars. It was rare a contestant left with nothing.”

“Right. You’re probably right.”
This just sort of happened from time to time.
” John shouted. “You have a one-third chance of being right on the first go and a two-thirds chance of being wrong.”
John pushed himself onto his knees. He grabbed at Sherlock, searching him for visible injuries. “Are you alright?” His voice was faint, a shout from a distant room.
“You know,” Sherlock suggested, “I could always
(See the end of the chapter for
“So don’t go slipping around on any rocks and cracking your skull open,” Darren said. “The both of you.”
Will hummed, but said little else on the subject. They wheeled the sheep down to the harbor in silence. John helped Will load the sheep onto the little boat, wondering if he ought to have another shower afterwards. It was well into the afternoon by the time both sheep were stored away on the boat, and John certainly didn’t think that this was how he would have been spending the majority of his day. Will nodded in farewell and John watched his boat disappear across the Sound, sheep carcasses large underneath their tarps.
John sighed and walked over to the laptop that Sherlock left sitting on the desk back when he was capable of complex motor functions. John lifted the lid and tapped at some buttons. He leaned against the desk, the weight of his body resting against his right palm as his left scrolled through something or other on the computer. His brow furrowed. He frowned. So many voluntary movements, so many muscle groups activated. How lucky John was.
“The nephew,” Sherlock said. “After he hit me with the bat. He went after you?”
Humiliatingly, John felt almost near tears. He wasn’t one for tears, and he hadn’t cried in ages. The feeling felt foreign to him. He realized—thinking back on it—that he hadn’t cried since the time during which Sherlock was dead and he was brought to his knees by some memory or another, triggered by something silly like dim sum or a bloody striped jumper. In fact, now that he thought about it, he hadn’t even cried when he and Mary were separating, preparing for divorce. He hadn’t cried once over the dissolution of his marriage, and was prepared to blubber like a baby because Sherlock had given him an angry blowjob on a goddamn hill. John wondered what exactly was wrong with him.
“Right,” John said, still not fully understanding all that just happened. He turned back towards the jar of jam sitting lonely at the table. He had a feeling he ought to be turned away from Sherlock at the moment as well. “I’ll make dinner, then.” He turned back to the cupboards, staring at the motley assortment of food Sherlock purchased and wondering what the hell he could prepare out of it.
“Are you sure?” Sherlock blurted. The wind was tearing at his hair, pushing it in and out of his face in turns. “Are you sure about…” he gestured wildly—at John, at himself, at the remnants of the cottage behind him, “that?”
“Yeah,” John said, “I don’t think we know enough yet to say—”
“You’re sure?” John still seemed uninterested in moving.
Odd, he thought. He wondered if he was getting the silent treatment. Already a bad omen for how the rest of John’s night was likely to go.
It was all terrible and he didn’t want any of it, but it didn’t matter. It didn’t matter that John wasn’t real, wasn’t really there on top of him in this god-forsaken wasteland of a building, because Sherlock remembered now. He remembered what John’s mouth felt like against his, the way his tongue moved past his lips and tangled with his own, the way he tasted, that taste that was just
John lay on Mary’s bed, naked and sticky and still somewhat dazed, staring at the ceiling. Mary just returned from the loo and slipped on an oversized shirt. She sat on the edge of the bed.
“She’s heading to Latvia,” Sherlock said. “Daugavpils, at least for a start. She may head to Riga after that. More resources for individuals who wish to remain invisible.”
John’s arse clenched around his fingers and his cock swelled in his hand and he was there, barely able to contain the sounds he made as his body shook and pulsed and shorted out. He came in long arches, spurting all over the cabinets in front of him, dripping onto the floor. The counter was soaked with his sweat and he was drooling a bit and he could have sworn there were tears stinging his eyes. He gasped and it sounded suspiciously like a sob. His body was twitching and his cock felt raw and oversensitized and he whined, actually
“What?” John asked. His head spun. He had learned bits and pieces of why Sherlock jumped—Moriarty threatening his reputation, Sherlock’s mission to destroy Moriarty’s criminal web—but he hadn’t heard this bit, not ever. “Sherlock, is that true? Is that why you jumped?”
“I checked,” Sherlock said. “Before you awoke. The other cottage remains undisturbed. As does the café and Declan’s lodgings just above. He wouldn’t have stayed so close to us anyway, too high a chance of being caught. And besides,” he nodded in the direction they were heading, “he went this way.” He pointed at the slick grass in front of them, still matted down from the rain. Just visible on a bare patch of earth, stomped into the mud, was the edge of a footprint.
Gilly shrugged. “Suit yourself,” she said. She lowered the knife to Sherlock’s throat. “Let’s begin.”
“Three minutes,” Sherlock said. “If he had severed the femoral artery, that is how long it would have taken you to bleed out. Three minutes.”
“No I wasn’t,” he says. He slips the glasses from his face and tucks them into a pocket. “Not unless somebody was looking.”
There was a litany of things John knew he could say, ought to say. He ought to say that of course Sherlock could keep him, Sherlock could keep him for as long as he’d have him. He ought to say that he wasn’t leaving, would never leave, doesn’t want to leave, likely could never leave, not without serious physical pain. He ought to say that he felt as if he were woven into Sherlock somehow, that he had grown into Sherlock’s life in a way that made extraction impossible. He ought to say that if Sherlock was a fool then John was the biggest fool of them all, had been for years.
John checked his mobile, half-afraid of what he might already find. He had barely spoken to Gilly at all the day prior, and hadn’t even sent her a text when he and Sherlock returned home to Baker Street. And then, of course, John had been otherwise occupied for the remainder of the night. He expected a flurry of texts and calls, turning from worried to infuriated, demanding answers for his silence.
“And when you were shot,” John continued. “When you were laying in your own blood, fading out and dead, why did you come back?”
“What?” John asked.
“You could have gotten yourself killed,” Sherlock said.
In the dream, Sherlock had stepped forward. Just a step, no more than that, but it pressed him flush against John’s back and John let out a moan that quite frankly surprised the hell out of him. Sherlock was
He separates from you just enough to get a hand on you. He squeezes, tugs, strokes. You nearly lose your legs. The sounds you’re making are humiliating. He bites your lip and you shiver.
“It’s just,” Gilly said, checking her makeup in the camera of her mobile, “the way he is with you. The way you are with him. You can see why I worry.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“Indeed.”
“Thirteen,” John said. His hips wriggled a bit at Sherlock’s touch. His fingers tangled in the sheets. “Good guess.”
, lush grasses covering the ground and swaying in the winds. Little yellow and purple flowers speckled the grass. Stone ruins of the dwellings of the former islanders ran along the hill, their dark exteriors standing out against the green. John could see white dots of sheep grazing in the distance, and swore he even saw a bloody rabbit dart into a burrow. The whole scene was bloody idyllic.
He never heard back from her.
“No,” he said.
You aren’t sure why you go to the pub these days.
John nodded. He forced himself to look directly at her as he said it. “Yes,” he said. “I’m in love with Sherlock.” He didn’t dare to look back at Sherlock just then, but he heard Sherlock’s head pop up, a sharp exhale escaping from his lips.
John smiled.
“About how far away is the shooter?” he asked.
mine changes now with every passing day.
“Yeah,” he said. “I will.”
John eased himself out of bed, his brain still not fully comprehending what just happened. However, he could hear Sherlock crashing about in the kitchen and figured he had better get downstairs before Sherlock destroyed the place. He pulled on a pair of trousers and an old jumper, straightening his mussed hair the best he could with his fingers as he darted down the stairs.
John’s cock began to take interest in the situation, plumping against his leg. No. No no no. He was far too physically close to Sherlock at the moment to sprout an erection. He didn’t want to send Sherlock flying from the bed in a disgusted fury. They were just faking, after all. Weren’t they still just faking? John ground his teeth together, biting at his tongue. He thought of dismembered corpses. He thought of his cantankerous great-aunt Wilma. He thought of the sewers of London. He wasn’t breathing again. The spots were back.
That gentle stabbing feeling was starting to return, and John had a feeling that it didn’t matter what he managed to cobble together for dinner, as he would unlikely be able to choke down a bite of it.
he could be a few short hours prior. He had woken up to the sound of crashing and clattering just an arm’s distance from his head, which was not his preferred way to wake up by far. He had a moment where he felt tugged back to Afghanistan, reaching for a weapon before realizing that it—of course—was only Sherlock.
You make yourself look away. You’re lonely, you tell yourself, and this sort of thing ends poorly. You’ve gone looking for a bit of rough plenty of times since you got back to London. You’re moderately successful—you aren’t exactly a stranger to this sort of thing—but you never feel like a success at the end of the night. The people you pull—the hapless men and women willing to lend you a spare twenty minutes just to get off—might be able to give you an orgasm, but they never give you what you need, not that you have the first clue what that is.
John collided with the man. He raised his bound hands over his head and brought them down around the man’s chest, trapping his arms and hauling their bodies together. The man cried out, stumbling and surprised, and pushed backwards, sending the two of them tumbling through the boat.
“She would prefer the goat as well. Over the car, that is.”
Sherlock ran his hands down John’s back, bowed and heaving. He could feel John’s heartbeat thudding through his ribs, through his rumpled jumper, through his jacket that was a bit tattered from being ground against the wall. His hands slipped lower and he wrapped around John’s hips, still writhing against him in desperation. He gripped John hard and, with as much strength as he could muster, thrust into John with enough force as to nearly send him toppling into the wall.
