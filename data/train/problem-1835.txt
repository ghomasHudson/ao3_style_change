"In love..." Kiss on the nose.
“Sorry I’m late, Sher,” he began, his voice low. “I just—“
Sherlock paused the music with a sigh, as it had restarted the song. He tried to push the feeling of John’s hand in his out of his mind, and settled down to continue his search for a case, choosing to neglect the small flower that had made a permanent residence in his chest.
“But you haven’t learned to lead yet, I led you.” Sherlock replied hastily. John was already shrugging his jacket back on, halfway down the stairs, and called back over his shoulder, “I’ll come round tomorrow.”
"John? Is that you?" I ask.
"John?" I call out hesitantly, not wanting to startle him. He glances at me, and in the light of the lamppost I see tears on his cheeks and vomit on his shirt. I walk slowly towards him, hands out in front of me as a gesture of peace. John sobs and the gun falls out of his hand onto the ground.
Unresolved anger
And then he cried. No one had ever cried for me, not even Mycroft. That was when I knew.
John agrees and I hang up, rushing around and getting ready before dashing out the door.
"I..." Nip on the ear.
"I've got three empty bottles of vodka and I don't know how I got here."
He suddenly became aware of a presence at the door, and he lifted his gaze to see John. John cleared his throat, shifting his weight from foot to foot. “How long have you been there?” Sherlock inquired.
He said things like I was a good man, that he owed me... Typical stuff. And then he said, "Sherlock, please... One more miracle, don't be... Dead... Just stop this, stop all of this."
Sherlock, being inexpirienced, did not know what to do with his hands as John expertly sucked on his neck. He placed them, palms down, on the arms of the chair. John paused for just a moment to chuckle; Sherlock was so nervous! The former army doctor leaned back on the lengthy legs of the beautiful man before him to look into those iridescent eyes. "Why so nervous?" He whispered alluringly as he repositioned himself on Sherlocks legs.
"Please stay." He pleaded as he took Johns hand into his. "I'll never leave. I can't, you've gone and gotten me emotionally comprimised." Sherlock winced at his choice of words. "'Emotionally comprimised?'" John mocked, but Sherlock took it as a question.
"Tea?" John asked. "Yes, great idea."
Sherlock followed him out of the kitchen and set his glass down on his desk after taking one more long sip. If he was going to get through this without his precious bud wilting, he would need the extra confidence. He pressed play on the music, and John folded Sherlock into his arms in such a natural way, it felt as though they’d been doing this for years. John confidently took the first step and moved Sherlock effortlessly around the room, even taking the risk of twirling Sherlock once or twice. The ease with which John executed the twirl made Sherlock almost not even notice he had done it at all. Almost.
He whispered. The taller man shifted, his hand falling and slapping himself in the face. Making very unnattractive snorting noises, he sat up, running a hand over his face.
He had gone several days without showering (until Mrs. Hudson practically gave him a sponge bath— he had agreed to shower quite quickly after that) and had yet to eat. It was half seven when his phone chirped. Sighing, he lifted himself into his elbow and picked up his phone.
John jumped away from Sherlock as if he had been shocked. Mrs. Hudson, red from embarrassment of waalking in on such an intimate moment, bent to pick up the plate of brownies she had dropped, turned and left without a word. Sherlock looked at John and they laughed until their sides hurt.
And I knew I was in love with a beautiful army doctor.
I slam my door as hard as I can. Sherlock has such a damn need to be a twat all the time. I change my mind about ignoring him and head back into the kitchen where he's sat with his feet tucked up under him. "I fucking HATED you, Sherlock. You left me. You fucking left me. You know how that feels? No, because you don't feel anything. I HATED YOU. FOR TWO DAMN YEARS, SHERLOCK." I scream at the top of my lungs. "I love you and you LEFT me." I say quieter. I roll up my sleeves. Self-harm scars cover my arms. After a good ten seconds, I lift up my shirt and show him the scars across my abdomen as well. "These are from you! I did this because of you!" I scream, almost happy about how shocked he looks. My happiness is soon replaced by guilt as his expression darkens. He looks at me with sad eyes, and stands up, beginning to invitation his shirt. I avert my eyes. "Sherlock, what the- why..." I end my sentence with a gasp. His shirt drops to the floor, and I suddenly understand why he never wanted me to see him without a shirt. Scars litter his upper body, but not only self inflicted ones. Among self harm scars are scars from beatings. I know what they look like from my many years in army medicine taking care of men rescued from captivity. He has burn marks, markings that resemble ropes and whips, and other various markings. I'm so shocked I feel my ears pop. I'm still gaping when I hear a few whispered words. "I did this FOR you..." ------------------------------- Sherlock runs out of the flat with his coat, leaving John still in the kitchen. He doesn't know where else to go, so he finds himself on Lestrade's doorstep. Lestrade himself answers the door, welcoming the Detective in. After a long chat about how stupid Lestrade is, the officer asks why Sherlock is there. "John and I had a... quarrel." Sherlock says awkwardly. Lestrade blinks. "About what?" "John thinks he endured more with me gone then I did. I was tortured, and he self-harmed but he still thinks he had it worse." Lestrade blinks again. "Well, he did have some... emotional issues with you gone." "Okay but really though, it wasn't that bad. Why didn't he just move on?" Lestrade snaps. "You weren't THERE Sherlock! You didn't get the drunk phone calls in the early hours of morning. You didn't rush to the cemetery to see him sitting on your grave with his gun in his mouth!" Sherlock looks as if he had been slapped in the face. "That.... That actually happened?" Sherlock asks. "YES." Lestrade says. "Yes." "Thank you, George." "GREG!" Sherlock once again grabs his coat and rushes onto the busy street, this time heading home. Upon reaching his flat, Sherlock threw his coat down on the stairs and takes the steps three at a time. He opens the door so quickly it slams against the wall, no doubt waking Ms. Hudson. There was so sign of John in the sitting room, so Sherlock went to check his bedroom. John was nowhere to be found. Sherlock decided to go check local bars. Knowing John, that's where he would be. Sherlock dashed down the hall to grab his wallet, previously left on his dresser. He opened the door to his bedroom and stopped dead in his tracks. John removed the gun from between his teeth, eyes wide and glistening with tears. Sherlock felt so raw, like his throat was made of sandpaper. "John." Sherlock said, voice cracking. "Sher." John said. Sherlock sprang onto the bed, knocked the gun onto the floor (clearly not the safest move but at the moment he didn't care) and held John so tightly. "John, I'm sorry, I was so wrong. I was so, so wrong. Please forgive me?" "I'll try."
John took a seat beside him and they ate in silence. Sherlock pushed a piece of broccoli around his plate as he waited for the other man to finish, taking his plate once he was done. As he walked into the kitchen, he felt John’s eyes on his back, probably questioning his host-like behavior. Once he had cleared the plates and stacked them in the cupboard, he prayed a silent prayer that the flower would, for once, not shiver at John’s touch, or droop at the lack thereof. He pressed his palms against the counter top, willing them to stop shaking.
He rose from his chair and sauntered over to Sherlock. Clamping his hands down on the taller man's knees, he leaned in close enough to smell Sherlock's shampoo. "Because," He whispered seductively.
"With who?" Sherlock asked.
Mrs. Hudson met him with sad eyes. “Oh, Sherlock...”
With an impressed smile, Sherlock continued to follow John’s movements, gliding across the floor. He hardly noticed when the song ended, until John released him and reached for his wine. He tilted the stem of the glass to the ceiling, draining what was left in it before shuddering. “It’s fucking awful,” he remarked, grimacing. “You have anything else?” Sherlock nodded towards a bottle on the floor next to his armchair, and John raised his eyebrow.
I'm awoken by my cell phone buzzing on the nightstand. Groaning, I sit up and pull it towards me. I quint at the bright screen in my dimly lit bedroom.
John scoffed, kicking at the floor. “Apparently, Mary and I can’t just sway during the first dance. She wants to do a waltz.”
When she came back, Mrs. Hudson offered Sherlock a cup of tea, sitting down next to him. She still had yet to say anything, waiting for him to trust his voice enough to speak.
Sherlock removed his hand with John's grasp, moving it to rest his hand on John's cheek. The shorter man moved closer and rested his head in the crook of Sherlocks neck. They sat there for a few minutes before Sherlock cleared his throat. "Yes," John said. "I love you, too, Sherlock!" Sherlock smiled and stood to move into the kitchen. John followed and got out some vegetables and meat, setting them on the counter. Sherlock looked at them questioningly until John noticed and said, "Lets be dull... we are making dinner together."
John replied, uncertain, “This isn’t a waltz, is it?” Mary shook her head.
John said, "Well I can't really explain..."
Then I realized...
Sherlock folded the music and slid it into an envelope, on which he had written “Dr. and Mrs. Watson.” He left it on the music stand, collected his coat, and calmly waded through the sea of happy, dancing, people.
He stepped into the cool night air, swinging his jacket over his shoulders as he walked. He popped his collar, hardened his gaze, and hardened his heart. As he walked, he crushed each and every damn flower petal under his heels, reminding himself his last vow had been made earlier in the night.
“You can dance?”
John couldn't just come out of nowhere and declare his undying love, though. Since the kiss, they hadn't really talked about the whole relationship thing. In fact, the hadn't really spoken about it at all.
Sometimes my heart still breaks when I think about how I hurt him. I left John, my best friend, to believe me dead. I could never tell him what I really did during those three years; he would be so angry.
Outside 221B Baker Street, Sherlock was sitting on the steps, dark curls splayed across his pale forehead. Ignoring him, John unlocked the door to the flat and marched up the stairs. Dropping the groceries (including milk) on the counter, he made his way to the lounge. Sherlock padded in after him, hovering as John reclined on the sofa. “Can I help you?” John snapped. Hurt flashed in Sherlock's eyes as he stepped back. “Milk?” He inquired softly. Now John felt bad. He gestured to the counter. Would he ever understand Sherlock?
Once they'd finished cooking, they sat at the table and ate in silence, the sounds of forks poking at the glass plates filling the room. John kept sneaking peeks at Sherlock once he'd finished. The taller man had all of three bites and had gone into his stationary position, fingers steepled under his chin and his eyes cosed. John took this moment to observe him.
Sherlock was shaking now. "Why not?"
His face looked more worn this morning; lines were deeper. John had his right hand over his left shoulder. His bullet wound. Sherlock was suddenly ambushed by a nauseating wave of protectiveness. He furrowed his brow and jut out his bottom lip. “Are you alright?” Sherlock asked, unable to keep the concern out of his voice. John lingered with his head back for a moment, then sighed, raising his head. He rubbed his hands over his face, and said, “I'm fine Sherlock, just tired. Don't you worry about me one bit. I'll just stay here and watch telly.” To prove his point, he slung his legs up onto the couch and spread out, turning on the television in the process. “Here,” Sherlock said. He stood up and carefully made his way to the couch, avoiding the messy piles of last nights “experiment”. Gently he lifted Johns head and sat down.
John stood, perhaps a little too quickly, and knocked over his tea. Sherlock jumped at the sound of shattering glass, and practically dove to the floor to pick up the pieces. Standing, he dropped the shares into John's rough, military hands. Sherlock flinched as a piece of glass caught his thumb.
“She chose this?” He inquired. John nodded in answer. “It’s not horrible, as far as wine goes. I’d rather you serve whiskey as well, but it will suffice.” John smirked and topped off Sherlock’s glass before setting the bottle back on the counter. He raised his glass in the direction of the living room.
When I reach his new apartment, the opposite side of the town from Baker Street, I carry him up the stairs and grab his key from his pocket. I put him into bed and turn to leave.
"Thank you." I could've sworn I heard Sherlocks voice as a whisper, but when I turn around, all I see is John passed out scrawled over his bed. I shake my head and head out, hoping this is the last of the drunk phone calls for a while.
A wave of nostalgia washed over Sherlock, tears springing to his eyes. He blinked them back.
“How many patches today?” John asked, his voice so low it was barely audible. John always seemed so concerned about Sherlock, with his past being like it was...
John loved it when Sherlock deduced things. It made everything so clear, like the pieces of an impossible puzzle were falling into place. Come to think of it, it was always like that with Sherlock. Everything felt so simple, so clear... So right. John had come back from Afghanistan with seemingly no purpose in life. In one week, Sherlock had changed that. His limp was gone, nightmares vanquished, and life was full of vivid color. When Sherlock had jumped off the roof of the bloody St. Barts, John had realized that he truly loved Sherlock, not that he would ever say it out loud, even to Harry or his therapist. He had spend years,
Sherlock scowled at John's smug expression and retrieved his patches.
(See the end of the chapter for
Unless, of course, Sherlock had anything to say about it.
Sitting atop our old friend's grave is a blond man with a gun between his teeth.
Sherlock didn't care what the sun revolved around, but when John kissed him, he knew that his entire universe had always revolved around John. He surged forward, grabbing John's jumper and pulling him closer. John fell into Sherlock's lap, and reached up to run his hands through that midnight mane as he had fantisized for so long. Sherlock gasped and parted his lips to deepen the kiss. With both men blinded by arousal and fighting for control, neither heard the door open.
“May I?”
“Take a class?” Sherlock suggested, but when he saw the horrified expression on John’s face, he wished he could take it back. John squared his shoulders. “Forget it, I’ll figure it out.”
The petals stilled. Slowly, one by one, they folded back into their bud, where they were safe. Sherlock swallowed. “Of course,” he said again, this time fighting the cracks that threatened to shatter his words. John retrieved his jacket, and with one last triumphant look back at Sherlock, he disappeared from the doorway. Sherlock stared after him.
"Yes but yours was closer," Sherlock replied. "Problem?" John opened his mouth to protest, but quickly shut it. He knew if he said anything, Sherlock would deduce just how badly John's date went last night.
"I'm sorry, love," Sherlock started. "You are the first person I have ever loved-" John clamped his hand over Sherlocks perfect mouth. "I am your first and I will also be your last!" John said in one breath and blushed to his ears at the end. He started to stand, but stopped when Sherklock pressed his head back down onto his shoulder gently.
Sherlock wondered.
He allowed his phone to slip through his fingers, falling on his chest. Steepling his fingers under his chin, he waited for John to respond. After about 10 minutes, however, the door swung open and John walked in with carry out. Sherlock looked at him from his place on the couch, John upside down in his vision as he moved about the flat. Sherlock swung his legs to the floor as John brought him a plate of pasta and broccoli.
Sherlock was sat at his laptop, fingers steepled under his chin as he searched for a case. He’d watched an excessive amount of videos online about how to fold napkins and other such trivial weddings things, and was itching for a rush of adrenaline. He wasn’t even sure why he was trying so hard to make this wedding beautiful, when he knew that he resented it. In the time he’d been away, a tiny sprout had popped up in his chest, reminding him who he was doing everything for. He let it grow for a bit, but when he returned and found John with Mary, he tried to push it away and suffocate it. This had worked for a time, but the feeling was persistent, and soon was impossible to ignore. Now, he was forced to feel the small bud struggling to grow in his heart.
John was looking at him, eyes roaming his face, searching. Sherlock could feel the weight of his gaze as they traveled from his jaw, to cheekbones, to nose, and finally coming to rest on his lips. John finally lifted his chin and looked into the taller man’s eyes. There was some kind of emotion, something reverent, sacred, guarded. Sherlock could not deduce what that look meant, but the flower had its own ideas as it trembled. John held eye contact for a moment before flicking back to Sherlock’s lips.
Flashback to a year after Sherlocks death
"Am..." Kiss on the jawbone.
Kiss on the cheek.
Sherlock's ears rang with exasperation. His heart raced. He couldn't find his nicotine patches anywhere, and he was sure to do something he'd regret very soon. He had looked under his skull, on his desk, and in his dresser, but didn't find them. John padded into the lounge, with tea cup in hand, and settled down on the couch to check his blog. John slung his quilt (gift from Harry) over his shoulders, and as he began to take his laptop out, he noticed Sherlock's frustration. He simply said, “On your desk, under your journal,” and opened his computer with a flourish.
he thought. Dark hair, making his skin look like ivory. Long, slender fingers.
The next evening, Sherlock paced in front of the fireplace, waiting for John to arrive. He had never said when he was planning on returning, and Sherlock was beginning to think he wouldn’t show.
How had he forgotten about the damn wedding? For just a moment, it was as if they were the only two people on the planet, with no deadlines or responsibilities. Just them, spinning in time to the violin. His bud felt foreign in his chest, more like a stone than the quivering green tendril it had once been. He pushed thoughts of waltzes, flowers, and calloused, steady hands from his mind as he made himself a cup of tea.
Mrs. Hudson left for a few minutes, allowing him time to pluck each petal off of his flower, letting them gently fall to the bottom of his lungs. He couldn’t breathe, but that’s to be expected.
John is forced to see the good in Sherlock.
I am a freak.
Sherlock looked upon the man he had yearned for since he saw the tan lines on his wrists. John straddled his waist and leaned in for a satisfying kiss. His breath hitched when the fluttering in his stomach became too much. Sherlock pulled back for a breath and craddled Johns cheek in his palm. "I never expected this afternoons events to end up like this." He flushed deep red. "Its just you and me now." John winked and loosed the famous blue scarf from around the brilliant mans beautiful neck and at the same time, kissing Sherlocks jawline sensually. Sherlock shuddered, and unusual heat flooding his body.
-incoming call from John Watson-
Slowly, their lips drew closer, brushing once, then twice, then finally finding each other. They moved slowly, neither of the men daring to breath, for fear of coming to their senses. The hand that was on John’s hip snaked around his back, the other moving up to snake into his curls. Sherlock ran his hand along John’s shoulder and around his neck, the other moving to meet it. The flower burst open, stretching its petals as far is it could, blooming to fill his chest cavity, threatening to overtake his hammering heart. It’s curling green tendrils wrapped around his rips, securing their place there forever. The kiss grew deeper, both men losing track of time and reality. All that existed was them, waltz music, and a small flat above Speedy’s.
"Two people. Once was in high school, but that was over before it started. After that I wasn't
"No," Sherlock almost shouted, reaching out and grasping John's arm. Then quieter: "Please. Please stay."
Sherlock dismissed the thought from his head as quickly as it came, and John went to retrieve the bottle. He disappeared into the kitchen for a few minutes, and Sherlock gladly took the time to give himself a talking to. He needed to relax. It was bad enough that John was getting married, but John also made him the best man. The role came with many responsibilities, including teaching the groom to dance, if need be. That was all this was. A duty he must fulfill.
"W-what?"
"Oi!" John exclaimed. "Get your laptop, it's right on the desk!"
“It was just a suggestion-“
But to say the least, I was less than surprised to learn that John and I were going to get a Christmas tree. John is into all the traditional Christmas workings, so we were going all out apparently. Eggnog, decorations, the works.
She took in the sight before her with quiet dignity, but no matter how calm she was perceived to be, John became the exact opposite. Springing away from Sherlock, his hand came up to rub his forehead, eyes darting about the room. He took a deep breath, dropping his hand. “I’ll see you at the wedding, yeah?”
Sherlock was surprised. “Are you sure?” John nodded in response, not looking very sure, but Sherlock slowly turned and awkwardly plugged his phone into the speaker, the bud quivering, green leaves tickling his abdomen. As the music began to pour out from the speakers, John hung up his coat before meeting Sherlock in the middle of the sitting room.
"Hmm?"
It was Sherlock.
John continues cursing and crying into my shirt, and I let him. I'm crying as well, and I have to keep reminding myself that I'm here to comfort John, not be comforted.
“Don’t worry, Mary, I have been tutoring him.”
Sherlock began to slap patches on. “Three,” Sherlock said, holding up his patched arm. “But the case is coming to a close.” Sherlock began to bustle about his desk, mumbling to himself occasionally. After a few minutes of silence, John snapped his laptop shut and dropped it into the bag hanging on the side of the couch. He let out a soft sigh and let his head drop to touch the top of the couch. Sherlock glanced up long enough to study his friends face.
Ah. This again. John pondered on how to answer this. Then everything was clear. He would not leave anything unsaid. He would never make that mistake again. If he didn't say it now, he couldn't gaurantee he ever would.
His old chair.
They sat in silence for a few seconds, sipping their drinks. After a moment, John cleared his throat and stood, reaching to turn on the music. Sherlock set his empty glass down and stood, moving to stand, once again, in John’s arms. They danced without speaking, the only sound being the music and the soft shuffling of their feet, moving as one. The song finished, and as it began again, Sherlock expected John to release him. He didn’t.
"Yeah, Gregory Lestrade, of course it's me," John slurs.
"Yes." Something flashed in Sherlocks eyes. Sadness? Anger?
The two men met in the middle of the room once again, Sherlock guiding John’s hands to where his own had been the previous day. They stood there for a moment, unmoving, until Sherlock reminded John, “You’re leading. You must take the first step to guide me.”
Sherlock shook his head. “No matter,” he said flippantly. “He’ll be married within the week. No sense in thinking about it.” He rose, letting the jacket and petals fall to the floor as he walked down the hall to his bedroom.
Days passed before Sherlock heard from the blond haired man again. The man’s soon-to-be bride had been in contact, confirming which of her friends should be excluded from the wedding invitations, but John was radio silent. Sherlock had solved all of the Yard’s cold cases to pass the time (and to keep himself from tending to the struggling flower) but seeing as the Yard had no cases left, he was now hopelessly bored. He was lying on the couch, repetitively tossing the ridiculous deer stalker hat at the wall above him.
"So you are telling me that I have a mad man on my heels who is angry because I'm not the same as in the fairy stories he knows from bed time?" John raised an eyebrow, trying to detangle that part of human logic again in his brain.
"What?" Sherlock rolled his head from side to side, working the kinks out that had formed from starring down for so long "You admitted just a few days ago that your lack of control partly caused your problem. Now, don't shush me for using it as an integral part to this case. How can you know that none of your daemons went rouge on a particularly tempting deal?"
“Tea”, Sherlock croaked and cleared his throat before starting again, “Tea would be nice.” He felt utterly at loss and although his mind was swimming in facts now that he was calm enough to look, they weren’t coming out as easily as they used to. No biting remark left his lips.
Molly nearly choked on the bit of pasta she had just put into her mouth and had to cough violently. “Are you sure we’re talking about the same guy?” she asked, wiping away a tear that had formed and looked at John bewildered “He has already reduced people to tears who have just looked at him the wrong way from across the room. I don’t even want to know what he’d do if you were to actually touch him.”
"I don't want you to feel like you have to do anything against your will." John murmured and then remembered their history and quickly corrected himself, "Well, as much as it is still possible at least."
"Ah, there is the slight problem" the devil sighed.
“I don’t know. I hadn’t thought of that. I just wanted to make sure I wouldn’t be bothering you further.”, he confessed, nervously rubbing his thumb over his forefinger.
Lestrade blinked a few times until he had caught up with the hectic stream of words, "Sherlock, I can't just let you have case files. They are confidential and what case are you on? If you need police information, it might be something you shouldn't do on your own."
"Just wanted to give you the idea that perhaps you are better with a team to help you than pretending to be best as a single player."
"Sherlock, you know quite well that losing nearly 2 litres of blood does not make you a prime candidate for 'being out of there immediately'." John reminded him gently.
“Argh, is this really necessary?” John asked her, watching as the imposing figure of Sherlock Holmes loomed over what seemed to be an unfortunate freshman.
"Just wanted to check" Sherlock said in defence, "So because you can't get rid of him remotely, we will have to go the old-fashioned way of figuring out what earthly evil he will be doing next so we can find him."
Sherlock just raised an eyebrow his face clearly asking what the other thought was so bad about the turn their little stroll had taken.
"Yes, detective do keep up. I don't just come over to say hello to Donovan because I like her so much. I need access to your archives. Any unexplained deaths and missing persons files dating back about one year" he shot a questioning look towards John who just nodded in confirmation of the approximate time span. "Anything you haven't found a culprit for or were to dim-witted to get the right one. Oh suicides might also be of interest, I'll know what I need when I see it."
"Now back to the questions and more importantly: my payment" John grinned and situated himself looming over Sherlock a bit while being aware of where the wounds were located.
“If she were allowed, she would be sitting right next to me the entire time.”
"I'm not sure but looking at what Moriarty got out of the deals and how he is behaving, it seems like he's gearing up for something quite big." Sherlock murmured, "Add to that that he wasn't too impressed with you turning up basically on his doorstep and him having a very deep religious background, by which I mean it is scarier than falling asleep with the devil in your bed, he doesn't appear to be too impressed by your work. But that still doesn't tell me what he plans to do next or what he is working towards."
Sherlock nodded and took another look at the hallway and the corpse lying in it. Even if he wasn't totally right about the motivation, Moriarty would be at the church in two days’ time, there was no way around it and then, then finally Sherlock would catch him.
“Come on, give me a bit more to work with” Sherlock grinned, his hand suddenly pressing against John’s hard cock under the layers of clothes. John moaned loudly and threw his head back. “There we are”, Sherlock growled triumphantly, pulling a string of moans from John as he continued to massage the other’s cock. “God, I could keep you here forever and you wouldn’t do a thing”
"You mean there is no burning in the flames of hell and getting raped by evil spirits? Man, I can understand why Moriarty was disappointed" Sherlock grinned mischievously.
"Yes, yes" she waved of what would have developed into a monologue about deduction and the fine art of logic, "But you know, most of us aren't that adept."
There was a sudden crash and gut-wrenching scream coming from the bottom of their stairs just when John had managed to get Sherlock to sit down and have at least a few bites to eat for breakfast. Obviously, this wasn't going to happen anymore as Sherlock sprung up like his chair had suddenly caught fire. He wrenched open the door to the flat and already saw the source of the noise in the hallway, Mrs. Hudson gripping the railing to keep herself stable. The front door was open, and it seemed like a body had just fallen through the door, surprising the old landlady who probably expected the postman behind the door. You didn’t need to be Sherlock Holmes to realise that there was no hope left for the poor bloke. He hadn't just spontaneously collapsed into Mrs. Hudson's arms.
A few hours later, John was simply lying in bed next to Sherlock. The detective had curled up as best as possible with the injuries to his leg and was finally resting. Multiple times in the past weeks John had cursed his non-existent need for sleep. It appeared to be a blissful break humans could take from their existence. Obviously, it was incredibly risky and they were vulnerable to no avail but they seemed to enjoy it enough to dedicate whole rooms to it. John thought he might understand the sentiment a little when he looked down at Sherlock's completely relaxed face. Sleep had taken all the hard edges and strain away. Without being conscious there was nothing you could worry about and even Sherlock, who was always racing into action, seemed peaceful. It hurt John's heart a bit, or whatever equivalent he had. Sherlock was ultimately trusting him, a sentiment he didn't often receive. This was especially painful because whatever happened now, it would end badly. There was no way out of the truths of their lives. John could suspend his duties while he had a valid reason, the chase after Moriarty, to do so. Still, questions were already being raised and in his position he could not afford to lose grip for too long. Clearly, after Moriarty was dealt with, he would return to his life and Sherlock would return to detective work with practically no space left for keeping up whatever they had just started. John knew their time was limited and he wasn't sure if Sherlock just ignored that fact or was unaware of the risks any prolonged contact would entail.
"I just reminded her that adultery actually is a sin and gets you a nice place with us" John shrugged.
“Yes, clean” John choked out, entirely too eager for this to continue. Sherlock’s mouth talking was impressive but John guessed wrapped around his cock it would look more stunning.
“Okay, let’s start there. Want to move this to a bedroom? It might be a lot more comfortable.” John proposed and put his arms firmly around Sherlock’s waist, pushing Sherlock to a standing position, draping the silk fabric back over his shoulders. “Come on. We can go upstairs if you like.”
This was originally me procrastinating writing Recurring Past [I'm sorry, I will continue it, it's just so much plot that it's getting to a stage where writing the next chapter is actual work.]. I wanted it to be short but here were are and it didn't really end up short. Don't expect anything big, it's just sex and fluff with a dash of plot because apparently that was what I needed.
Sherlock didn't really move so John silently closed the door behind himself and went over to the couch, sitting down on it. He rested his arms on his legs, focussing on the table in front of him. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have questioned your methods like that. After all you're right, I wouldn't have called on you if I hadn't already tried everything I could come up with." John couldn't hear any reaction from the other, so he tried to go on. "I'll do my best to stop questioning how you do your job. I would only like for you to tell me the course of your decision making. After all, it still is my duty to solve this problem and I would very much like to be a part of your work."
"Don't patronise me" John sighed and put the kettle on. Somehow he had filled that particular spot in Sherlock's life, making tea constantly. If anyone got wind of that, he would have to work really hard to get his reputation back up to speed. "Have you had any breakfast?"
To say the air between them was frosty would have been an understatement. John had left, being off to Sherlock knew not where. Sherlock stayed in the living room, stunned by the happenings. It took him another half an hour before he had calmed down sufficiently to even think about going back to work. Their fight had riled him up enough for his head to burn down every attempt at concentration to the roots. Sherlock was absolutely shattered by it. Never had anything had this effect on him. He spoke his mind, he got out what he felt was right and still just now, he felt awful. Alone, alone was what protected him. All the time he had spent running after criminals, he had done it alone. Now, here he was forced to work together with someone and he seemed to crumble.  He couldn't deny that he was working better with John, the devil, whoever he had been spending his last weeks with. It was a sick twist that the only friend he seemed to be able to keep was the devil himself.
“Nah” she shook her head, looking over to where someone was apparently getting a good dressing down by Sherlock “He’s too much of an arse and probably gay either way.”
“Great so you are telling me that for no good reason at all you broke into my room?” John rubbed his hand over his eyes, this was definitely too much for the day he had had. Why couldn’t these things wait until he had a day that didn’t leave him exhausted to the bones?
"Yes, but what is it doing on your leg and why does it look fresh?"
"And who are you then?" after recovering from the snide remark, Sally put herself insistently in John's way, using her whole police training to appear as intimidating and authoritative as possible.
“Oh, you really don’t remember?” John asked, “The reason you continue to follow me. The kid I more or less saved from you in the cafeteria a few weeks back. Freshman with the backpack?”
"It's just such an unnatural feeling for me" Sherlock sighed, very much enjoying the close contact though. There were just too many feelings rushing through his mind. It was close to wading through a storm, seeking the eye of it for a bit of peace and calm.
"I don't like high stakes" Sherlock murmured before his eyes drifted shut and he fell asleep on his couch.
"We can't just jump on every whim you have" Lestrade stepped aside a little to allow John to take a look at the wound, "We don't work for you but for the public and there wasn't a case."
In a world where Omegas were sold off and bound in their first heat after coming of age, the latest, Sherlock stayed the exception. He bound himself to his Alpha during his second heat after coming of age.
John had to lean against the kitchen counter. His fingers were flexing against the edge of the cold surface. For the first time in years, he feared that his instincts might take over the rains. He couldn’t deny that he had grown increasingly fond of the Omega. Sherlock had within a few days thrown his whole world upside down. Not only had the doctor now made more visits to Scotland Yard than ever before in his life but also had a distinct reason to come back home each evening. Obviously he had tried to keep the nature of his feelings hidden but after the last night there probably wasn’t much use in that anymore. Still, there hadn’t been time to talk this through and John feared that if he gave in once, he wouldn’t be able to keep himself from bonding the Omega, whether that was the other’s wish or not. With a sigh he grabbed the water bottle and the birth control and went back.
"What then is good and bad? Since religion seems to be out of the equation, I'm not quite sure how one should live." Sherlock asked concerned. He already knew that he would probably face a myriad of charges.
"I mean he was right: Even you need help sometimes" John shrugged. He admired Lestrade for not ignoring his gut feeling. Weaker people would probably have pushed it aside for the necessity to be nice and sociable, but the Detective stayed weary of John. It probably was the best defence anyone could have against a daemon - never trust them enough to turn your back on them. The thought of leaving Sherlock with Lestrade to chaperon him, made John's heart feel that tiny bit lighter.
"You're the devil, nothing should be a problem for you."
“Look at you.”, John breathed, his hands firmly on Sherlock’s waist, pulling him hard down onto his lap. “How beautiful you are with all your pale skin.”
"You identified a possible suspect and didn't think to tell me about it?" Lestrade asked, obviously feeling slightly betrayed.
"I haven't lied to you."
“Not hard to find out about, is it?” John smirked, “I guess there are not many people in London called ‘Sherlock Holmes’, because that’s a pretentious name, and I believe there are even fewer people who write with that precise amount of distaste for the normal population. All in all it sounded pretty much like you and to be honest I can’t imagine anyone else actually conducting a study on the characteristics of tobacco ash. Of what use is that even?”
They kiss deeply, almost languidly. John puts his hands on the back of Sherlock’s thighs, and they wander upward, groping Sherlock’s buttocks, long and hard. Sherlock groans openly into John’s mouth, fingers of one hand curled tight into a fist at John’s right collarbone, the other splayed across an aged, puckered wound, the miracle that delivered John to him.
“What about Mrs. Hudson?”
With a pointed glare that goes completely amiss, John picks up a coat (damn the reheating, let him
Stepping out onto the wide, grey roof, John is met by a gust of cold breeze. The tubelight fixed above the doorframe casts white, clinical light, the arched reach of which ends just at Sherlock’s feet. He is standing by the ledge, a statue, hands clasped behind his back and face tilted away from John. Relief, then renewed terror wash through him, one after the other. He takes another step forward, calf bumping into the sharp edge of an old satellite dish.

“What?”
“Oh, well, you’ll— I mean—” he clears his throat. “It’s only till Saturday,” he manages.
Sherlock shrugs, snapping on safety goggles, and firing up a Bunsen burner.
“Not nearly as often as I’d like to be,” she smiles painfully. And then she is gone. In her stead, there is Mycroft, flipping the phone shut and pushing it deep into his pocket. He takes Sherlock’s hand (

Wait.
“Oh, Sherlock, dear Sherlock…” He is holding his belly, tears of mirth streaming down his cheeks; dark eyes are blown darker, to mere pupils, fixed on Sherlock’s blank face.
John takes a deep breath, turns towards the door, and then turns back.
The pallor of his skin is worse. John’s eyes are open and unseeing. His mouth is pinched, his face lax.

“Really John, if you have such low tolerance for confrontation, best not to take the taxi home unless you have exact change.” Sherlock itches to say more, to make him halt in his tracks by letting out something shocking, or maudlin.
A silence falls, as they study each other.
“Oh, uh.” John leans forward from his armchair. “I dunno. Anything. Same theme? Something sad?”
Sherlock is quiet, considering his brother’s torn face. Mycroft opens his mouth, to say something more-
A lined face, a wry little mouth. Eyes that are bluer in the light, the light that is well out of his reach. Sherlock can appreciate the neatness of evolution’s last trick, this overwhelming surge of undiluted survival instinct,

“You know,” John says, delicately wrapping the gauze around Sherlock’s midriff, “the next time you feel like trying this sort of stunt again, god forbid,” he tightens the gauze, slightly, and Sherlock winces, “where you’re playing dead and being a saviour and all that rubbish,” he pulls away and waits, as Sherlock turns to face him, “you should take me with you.”
He feels a sudden, ballooning anger. Rashly, he bites out, “Here’s your answer, John. I didn’t interrupt your date because ever since my return, I’m supposed to somehow

Sherlock fumbles, unbuttoning John's limp form. Links his hands together, and places them, palm first, on John's bare chest, among glinting blond hairs-
Blood, darkened blood, crusts John's nostrils and his ears, and lines his lips in streaks. The skin of his arms, his neck, patterned in a beautiful, broken web of burst capillaries. Hemorrhaging, both internal and- Sherlock assumed John's cardigan was naturally maroon, but no, its

Sherlock shrugs. “Depends on who you know.”
“Yes,” Sherlock answers, firmly.
"I'm- I'm sorry, I don't- I'm not normally this helpless, I-" Sherlock feels a new wave of panic, an immense crest that is moments away from collapsing against his throat.
He nearly does, but he doesn’t. There is the small matter of hygiene: communicable infections, so on and so forth. That, and he’s not gay.
“Thank you, thank you
He gestures to a group of empty crates. “Might as well be sitting for this.”
“Oh, beg pardon.” John nudges the golden-haired man, who he can’t quite place, but
The external pressure returns to his hand. Maroon, fraying cardigan, hanging from the shoulders unbuttoned. John was wearing a striped jumper in his death vision [shock/revelation/epiphany? All and none of these]. Reconciling both these Johns feels like a process in stereoscoping. He wills his lips to shape words, and laboriously, a rasp works its way out his throat. Practically inaudible. But the almost-warmth around his hand tightens, and John’s eyes are alarmingly bluer in the fluorescent light of the ambulance.

“What do you mean?”
“I—what?”
To his credit, Sherlock does not contradict this.
John lets out a shocked laugh as Sherlock says, forcefully, “No!”
life, I would. Undoubtedly, unthinkingly, I would— and yet, you have also made it decidedly more difficult. Do you understand?” Sherlock pushes up his chin. Stubborn.
The typing pauses and Sherlock slips, looking up and right into John’s eyes.
Sherlock shrugs off his dressing gown with a grimace, fingering the hem of his t-shirt— and stops, hesitant. Without breaking eye contact, John reaches out, tilting his head: a silent question. Sherlock looks away, tense.
John comes with a grunt, in a series of shudders, and Sherlock holds him through it, hands sliding up and down John’s forearms, leaving dry kisses on his jaw and neck, each kiss a word he can’t bring himself to declare,
But Sherlock raises a hand.
Mrs. Hudson would buy one, but not for utility. Doubtless, he would have to consult her expertise while writing. New Scotland Yard would order in bulk, and Lestrade would keep two, just in case. Mycroft would order a copy, John feels certain, dipping his tea bag into the milk. And maybe then, would consider getting a therapist of his own.
And then, abruptly hollow.
I now spend the days atop my humble abode, the mantelpiece in flat 221B. It is a helpful vantage point for when things get dull inside my cranium, which happens, but is rare, given that I am highly interesting (and especially, to myself). I have, at any given point of time, between two to seven items of contraband just shy of peeking out from my eye sockets. Once, I remember obscuring two separate packets of cigarettes from view: the first put there by Sherlock, and the second by John, unbeknownst to either- hidden with diametrically opposite intents. Mycroft pocketed both, resulting in an entire week of misplaced, suspicious glares.
A jolt-

Unbidden, a snide, lilting voice floats through his mind.

trying to watch you, very carefully, from the corner of his eyes. Hiding his face behind a journal, or the paper, or in this case, John’s laptop.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” John is trying so hard not to smile, and it is replicating the same, stupid urge in Sherlock. “As if I’d need bedsheets.”

I must admit that I am still fond of Sherlock Holmes. I think of him as a close acquaintance, or distant friend-- one who has changed time zones and insincerely sworn to keep in touch, resulting in (blessedly) little interaction. We are but an occasional, warm presence on each other’s minds. It is a relationship that needs very little validation. Healthy, even, were it not for my unfortunate condition.

Something tremendous shatters inside Sherlock.

It’s a very slight movement, but Sherlock flinches, face unguarded, looking very small— and it makes John feel

A few moments later, John calmly slides into the seat by the stretcher. The medic clambers in after him, and closes the back door defeatedly.
“Second cupboard, top shelf. The red jar.”
Sherlock hates this part, the part where Mycroft first informs him. It is needless, a waste; an unnecessary plot point in this relentlessly recurring dream- but it happens, all the same- happens, even though Sherlock knows, by the weight of his heart, by the smell of foreboding in the air, by an unidentified static in his ear- happens, even though he
He trails off, looking slightly embarrassed.
“Have you-” John swallows. “Have you ever done this. Before.”
John licks his lips. “You did compose this for someone, didn’t you?”
John watches Sherlock’s eyelashes flutter, a small ridge formed in the skin between his eyebrows, formed from concentration (concentrating on him, on
Ah, they are standing in 221B, Baker Street- but it’s been stripped bare of its furniture and carpet; its warmth and familiarity. Only Mrs. Hudson’s tartan curtains remain, fluttering against an open window (Sherlock can hear her, tottering downstairs about the kitchen, fussing over burnt pastries). There is no light outside to be discerned, and yet, the flat is illuminated. The effect works well for Mycroft, highlighting the folds and lines of face, the curve of his nose, lending him an

“I love you,” John confides, whispering into Sherlock’s mouth.
“Hanky.” John drops a pretty, lilac handkerchief on Sherlock’s lap. “On loan from Mrs. Hudson. And it’s a common cold, Sherlock, for Christ’s sake.”
“Is this about- about your nightmares?”
John cradles his head like it’s a fragile discovery, a crumbling artefact seeped in the sand of an excavation site.  “Oh. Oh, thank god.” His voice is thick, and trembling. Does John know how compromised he seems? Unlikely. If he knew Sherlock had the slightest hold on lucidity, he wouldn’t be so glaringly, excessively emotional. “You utter-” He stops. Takes a ragged breath. “That’s twice now. Twice, you bastard.” His words are harsh [and his hands so gentle].

Sherlock lifts his jaw from the chinrest and inclines his head at the praise. He then looks at John questioningly, bow dangling loose from his fingers.
“Good god,” he says quietly, but the blur of city lights throw the dips and planes of his profile into relief, so that John can see the slope of his cheek, and how it’s just the slightest bit lifted.
Then, he turns around, and John draws back instantly, jaw going slack. Sherlock’s head twists, the skin of his neck stretched tight. His chin brushes his shoulder, and he watches John, unblinking.

be a smart arse, just leave me-”
“I did it for you, John.” It should be a sin, for the timbre of his voice to click right back into John’s schema of cognition, as if John had not tried burying it six feet under, with the worms and soil and devastation. “For Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade— Moriarty had snipers on each of you, prepared to shoot if they didn’t explicitly see me-” John’s breath hitches, and Sherlock breaks off.
He clears his throat and stands up, pushing the crate back. Pins and needles retreat from his legs with slow remembrance, as if his limbs have been in disuse for a long time. Sherlock studies him, eyes narrowing. “I suppose I— I should be off now. Goodnight, then.”
Very slowly, Sherlock reaches to hold the wrist of John’s raised hand. “I don’t see why that should mean I’m in love with you.”
“Sorry?”
“John-”
“It’s never the fall that kills you.”
Dying,

The first time he is woken by Sherlock’s torn, anguished yell, he leaps out of bed, bounds downstairs, switching on all the lights- and bursts through the doorframe, heart thudding madly-

An eruption of applause from above makes both of them glance at the ceiling.
All the while, this composition, wretchedly on loop.
John feels a sudden spurt of shiny, renewed resentment.
Sherlock has saved John many times, and as of last count, perhaps twice from John himself.
“But I’ll see you tomorrow?” Sherlock asks quickly, in a tone so blatantly—

Yes. Yes, he may just dare.
“Sherlock,
There was the one, illuminated path— and unknown, murky depths lapping on either side. Never to be waded through. Never to be drowned in.
He breaks the surface once, and gasps. The cold air knifes his face, fills his throat. He submerges, struggling to loosen the knots at his wrists and feet, coat buoying up and above him like the spread of useless wings. There are shards of refracted light, just above his reach. He kicks, wriggles, and learns that limbs are useless. Transport is unable to respond to central command. The end is nigh, and it is disappointingly common.
He can’t imagine what Sherlock sees in his eyes, because the man takes a small step forward, and his lips pop open in that way they do when he’s about to stop leading New Scotland Yard round and round the mulberry bush—

so laughable.”
“Well hello, Sherlock. This is a turn-up, isn’t it?”
“You could say you proved a negative.”
John turns to James, a little panicked. James gazes at him impassively, with ancient eyes. Then, he leans closer, and John’s chest constricts, mouth dropping in astonishment, as James’ nose brushes his, their breaths mingling—
"Did you do this? Was this you?"

Perhaps it is best not to dare. To preserve this pristine, obscene, near-contentment the way it is.
They fall asleep this way. Sherlock’s hand cupping John’s neck, and John’s hand on his chest, conducting the slow rhythm of his heart.
Then, suddenly, John is shoved, stumbling, into the nearby alleyway behind a dumpster. Sherlock pushes him by shoulders against the wall, roughly, with both hands. They crouch close together. John is acutely aware of every point of bodily contact: from the pads of Sherlock’s fingers grazing his neck, to the pressure of the heel of his palm on John’s clavicle. Sherlock’s side, pressed flush into his. The collar of that blasted, Belstaff coat tickling John’s cheek. The rim of his ear resting lightly against John’s temple.
It is difficult to keep his eyes open, but closing them is tantamount to accepting defeat.
John chuckles. “I don’t think we’d get this view though, from there. Closing hours are strict, aren’t they?”
Sherlock steps back, one hand tugging at the hem of the cardigan. He blinks at John, face blank.
. Because there is a part of us that
“Please, John. You have to let me explain until you’re in full possession of all the facts-” A small pause, as if anticipating an angry interjection, and it thrills John to stay stock-still and silent— defying expectation, listening, “-otherwise, you may reach an erroneous conclusion.”
His left foot dangles over unsupported air for a brief instant, and John swears out loud, holding onto the wall to slow his momentum, the curse echoing dully within the abandoned elevator shaft. The barely-there residue of drowsiness beneath his eyelids has fled, and John is now hyperaware. He inspects the darkness, and then jabs the button a few times without any real conviction, eyeing the stairwell.
Sherlock rests his head against the wall, eyes scrunched shut, a dribble of dark red inching down his chin. His Adam’s apple bobs up and down, his breathing as laboured as John’s, who has bent over, palms clutching knees.

John squints, blinking at him twice, and then makes his way to the kitchen. He turns the tap on, and the sound of water hitting steel basin is muted as John passes a glass underneath.

The trace of alcohol is unmistakable, acrid and unwanted, interfering with John’s usual, lovely smell.

How did John not see this coming? There’s always something, of course— sister-not-brother, botox-not-tetanus, but alive-not-dead, that’s not your garden-variety blunder. John crawled on hands and knees through the five stages of grief— raw skin, ragged fingernails and all. Turns out they were listed wrong, John should’ve swapped the first and last, and isn’t this a fucking epiphany, that he was closer to the truth when he was in denial—
John puts both his hands on Sherlock’s chest, and pushes him away firmly, breathing heavily.
Almost done! As always, your comments/kudos are gleefully welcome, they never fail to make my day.
- Christ. Let’s try The Shard next time. I like the idea of a functioning lift service, for one-” Sherlock snorts. "I think you appreciate this sort of stuff more than you let on,” John says, staring ahead at the domed outline of St. Paul’s Cathedral. Sherlock follows his gaze.
“Just…fuck!”
[He understands why sex induces reverence, he does]
There is something vital, something tremendously

"This", she gestured vaguely around her, "He does this because he likes it. Comes to a double homicide with a grin and has fun when a serial killer manages to snatch five victims from under his nose. He doesn't get paid, he just gets off on it. One day, we'll get to a crime scene and Sherlock Holmes will have been the one to put the body there."
John raised an eyebrow "You really haven't understood what's happening, have you?"
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open, gaze clouded. It took John a lot of willpower to not simply attack the swollen lips again, coaxing the blush which had spread on the high cheeks out further. “It’s never…”, the Omega obviously tried to formulate a sentence but the words were just coming sluggishly, “Never like that… when I’m not…”
“Shush Sherlock, we are outside and you are shouting out confidential information.”, John chuckled and more or less shoved the Omega into the waiting cab.
Sherlock shook himself back out of his frozen state and put the sugar in his tea. His mother had always said his teeth would rot because of all the sugar he needed. The thought about his mother made him flinch momentarily before he pushed it down and headed back to the lounge. With a swift observation he decided to take the black leather armchair across from the Alpha. There wouldn’t be much space to pin him down on like on the couch and the way to the window was shorter. Carefully he folded his legs underneath himself, settling in with his mug of tea steaming and warming his hands.
Sherlock gnawed at his bottom lip. It was true. The reports glossed over quite a few parts where it was obvious the DI hadn't quite caught what he had been rambling on about.
When they all had settled down a bit and the suspension had risen, the music in their small place got turned up a bit. It was the same as in the club but now it was much more prominent for them. The girls were giggling excitedly and John gripped his glass a tad tighter.
“I don’t know what you mean”, John hesitated, then rested his hands on Sherlock’s thighs.
"Sherlock you have been shot." Lestrade said gravely, "How the hell did that happen? Believe me if you went after that guy on your own, I'm going to give you more to feel sorry about than your leg."
"No and I don't know why you care. You don't need it and neither do I" Sherlock waved his hand about. He was trying to get more information on the parameters of this case but it was difficult. No one had written research papers about daemon deals or conducted a study with a respectable sample size. All you could find were nutcases on the internet who said they had it all figured out, including how the government was lying about lizard people being in charge.
"Oi, freak. What are you doing here? There is not a case I'm aware of." Sally Donovan caught Sherlock by the arm just as he wanted to brush past her, on a direct line towards Lestrade's office.
"Yes, thank you Mrs. Hudson that would be all." Sherlock was a little impatiently tapping his fingers on the banister, "Come on, John." He quickly went up the remaining steps to his flat. Obviously, Mrs. Hudson had to imagine things again but Sherlock didn't really felt like calling her out on it. There were more important things on his mind than what his landlady thought he and John were doing.
When his food arrived, an assortment of small Chinese odds and ends perfect for eating in one bite, John took it over to the couch poking at Sherlock’s feet. “Budge up.” He knew that if offered like this, it would only take about five minutes for Sherlock to have turned around on the couch, his head either lying on John’s lap or his body pressed close to the other’s side. In a way it was ridiculous that the dark haired one didn’t want to admit how much he craved touch but John was happy to give him what he needed silently. Like predicted it really only took five minutes until long fingers were stealing bites of food, John leaving exactly those pieces he knew Sherlock liked best.
When Sherlock had come to his senses again he immediately began to move mumbling, “I should…I have to…”
“You’ll get as much as you want.”, John murmured, starting a gentle thrusting with his fingers. He knew they weren’t enough but as much as it was for teasing Sherlock, it also served to calm his doctor’s mind. He didn’t want to hurt Sherlock in any way so testing the stretch the other could take with his fingers wasn’t the worst idea. “At some point I will have you fuck my hand.”, he hummed, enjoying the blush and gasped the words elicited form the Omega. “Just my fingers, perhaps a bit more if you can take it. God, you will be such a beautiful sight, pushing yourself back wantonly onto my hand. But not now. Now I want to thrust into you and knot you. I want to feel you squeeze down tightly on my knot. It will be so different from what any toy could give you.” Sherlock was nearly horrified at the loud moan which escaped his throat. Then again his head was too far gone already to care for anything. He could only feel the slickness seeping out of him, producing obscene squelching noises when John pushed his fingers back into him and the pleasure singing in his veins. It should have been frightening but everything inside him was screaming for more.
"I don't wave my hands about and no. No, believe me I tried. You simply can't latch onto him. He probably is living in a holy fort and always carries something blessed with him. No one of us can even get close. I just figured that since his victims are very mortal and turn up dead on your streets, there might actually be a case another mortal could solve. Just because I can't get close doesn't mean another human couldn't. By now I've exhausted my means to the end that hiring you was the only option left, besides letting him continue obviously." the devil was gritting his teeth. Sherlock realised there was more to this story than he was being told. He made a mental note. If he wanted a shot at solving this case, he would need all the information which included delving deeper into the workings of daemon deals. He wasn't looking forward to that specific part if he was honest.
John chuckled "Nah, we don't need to keep anyone chained up. You just basically stay where you are and suffer until you are done. Then you are just gone. Imagine the hassle we would have if we had to chain and unchain everyone who came through our doors. Do you even know how many people die each day?"
As soon as he woke up Sherlock knew something was off. His skin was tingling along every point of contact with the sheets.
John just nodded, sensing that Sherlock would see words as just superfluous chatter. Dealing with another stolen soul case was annoying but at least this time he knew that they could be closer to getting rid of this mess than ever before. It shouldn't bug him that Sherlock seemed gleeful about the death of a person. After all, everyone was just human and they would get their proper judgement at the end. Just, Sherlock seeming so determined to walk down the lane of 'not good' made him actually feel something. This man was incredibly brilliant and more cunning than most. He was going all out on a case which might be impossible to solve, especially with the lack of information. John just silently followed him down the stairs and into a cab. Sherlock was a good man, even if he was currently walking with a spring in his step and a smile on his face because someone had died. John sighed slightly, he would blame himself for the rest of eternity if Sherlock didn't solve the case.
The term break had been filled with enough work to make John forget his strange encounter with the infamous Sherlock Holmes. That name was filed away somewhere at the back of his head with other things he didn’t really care about.
“It’s not really my place to decide.”, the words were muted and he hated how submissive he had turned but he had always been less likely to go into confrontation shortly before his heat. Another thing about his hormones he absolutely detested. Instead of taking advantage though, he was surprised as the doctor rolled his eyes and huffed, “Quite the opposite, it’s all yours to decide.” Sherlock looked up confused, eyebrows drawn together and obviously waiting for further explanations.
“No, that’s: easily annoyed by someone’s…” Sherlock had to stop because John was pressing their lips together, to silence him. “Do kindly shut up,” he murmured with a grin and bit lightly into the plush lower lip of his friend, “And help me get undressed.”
"You want to go to this address? Really, do you believe them to be this thick?" Sherlock chuckled and quickly photographed both sides of the card, "If it was only this, then you wouldn't have come to me. You can't tell me that you haven't already found multiple of these cards. I imagine they change the address to whatever location they see fitting for the deal and then discard it again. The telephone number on the other hand could be more of a lead. We'll just have to try it out." Sherlock shrugged and stood up. He got his own mobile phone out of his coat and flicked a switch before typing in the number.
“Ah, come on, John normal is boring. Normal is so predictable,” the detective ran his hand once through his hair dislodging a few leaves which had tangled themselves in the dark curls.
"That's stupid. Anderson went through a post-graduate degree course and you wouldn't even know that he finished basic school training successfully. Degrees are just for people who need to hide their incompetence behind a slip of paper."
"Should we try out my powers of conviction then?" John offered, pulling Sherlock in closer so that their faces were again just centimetres apart.
John couldn't say that he wasn't impressed. He had stood there in the office of a high ranking police officer, very much the unknown intruder. For all it was worth he had been the centre of attention for 20 seconds at most. Sherlock really seemed to have a heavy hand in the success of this unit. Although that couldn't be the only reason the DI was so lenient with the other. John sensed that even if Sherlock insulted his way through his life, he had unwillingly and maybe unknowingly found a friend in what should be his boss. It was somewhat sweet and John wondered how long it would take until Sherlock got the files. There was no doubt he would get them and just that little security made John be optimistic about this endeavour.
She put her tray on the table and hugged him tightly before pulling out a chair for herself to sit down. “Well, yeah whatever you call fun but you know how it is, you try to cram in as much work as possible” she chuckled. Molly was a bit younger than him and he had gotten to know her through a seminar he had done for a teacher in the younger years to earn a bit of money during the term. She had been one of the only people who were genuinely glad about some extra help and the possibility to ask questions. Most students hated these courses because they thought of them as extra time they had to spend in the University building but John couldn’t help that. In the end he had become friends with Molly and he actually liked her shy and sometimes flustered behaviour. Her brutal honesty though was something he value most.
Sherlock started laughing slightly, lips curled upwards and voice a deep rumble, “Oh you’re annoyed. Why? It’s not really because I broke into your room, I mean there is virtually nothing here that could be graded as secret or valuable. No, you were already annoyed before you knew what was waiting for you. I see that your little stunt made you famous. How does it feel?”
But, John is there during it all. He stands over him in what he thinks is protectiveness, but the wilting of his eyes shows concern. A cup of tea in a hand and a hand braced tightly on Sherlock's shoulder, the grip never faltering or easing.
It's definitely not an excuse, but he can't help but notice how long ago, home felt lost and family felt scarce. With Sherlock around, it felt fuller, though he would never agree and turn the point at John. When John forgot at times, he often thought nothing changed at all.
Often, Sherlock would run off into slurry speech with his eyes drooping off. At times, he would curl up in his armchair, muscles seized up and quivering without his consent. He wouldn't be able to tell when the tears began falling until somebody pointed it out. It was down to numbness with a slight buzz of something the English language didn't have a word for. Like his body had reboot from overload.
They were just a waste of time and calories, an impossibility when seen from the second dimension, a mere unsanitary exchange of amylase and electrolytes. But, they delivered the slightest sliver of pleasure occasionally. Such occasions were barely once or twice in Sherlock's life of thirty plus years.
"You could have died!" A very familiar voice bellows. There is no not listening to it. "What were you thinking?!"
"Off in her room, sleeping." He gathers the bottles of marmalade and jam and goes to place them on the table.
It wasn't necessarily bothering. She reminded John of her mother with her little blonde curls, although he believed that Mary watched over their fixer-upper family of three. It wasn't just that- Rosie was like John too. She took a shining to treat sick baby pigeons that were dying by the window sills and she started rows with the children at school over reasons both important and trivial.
Obviously, it doesn't take much. All Sherlock has to do is kiss John. Tilt his head to the side with his hands cupping John's cheeks and kiss him square on the mouth as if he was plunging into the truths hidden somewhere deep into John's mouth. It starts off an ulterior motive that shapes into an apt example of commensalism.
John's hands bunch the crisp material of Sherlock's shirt, a finger slipping between the gaps between buttonholes, almost teasingly. And then- Sherlock pulls back because he needs to breath. But, it's always as if John will not take that as an answer.
Sherlock was easy to fall into step with. He was around and he was there for Rosie. He was there for John. When everything was in pieces (literally), Sherlock was there to pick everything up with him. When their house felt too empty, there was a spare bedroom in the 221B that waited patiently. It was too small for the three of them, plus the ever-growing Rosie. Somehow, it became home over the last nine years.
As soon as it's out, John feels his insides sag and weigh down into the chair. A bead of sweat rolls down the nape of his neck. Though Sherlock put himself, spread himself out on the table and with his heart on a dish before him, he didn't know what to say- what to feel. He had never looked at men like that and he assumed Sherlock was a passing cloud that he didn't have to go into depth with. They couldn't do this. He couldn't do this. Their dynamic would change. Everyone would look at them differently. Everything would be different- he didn't think he would be ready for that kind of change. Or if he was ready for any kind of complication.
Suddenly it hits him, it doesn't have to be complicated. Rosie often said that adults made things hard when in reality, they looked so simple. They spent so long- so many years brushing it all under the rug. People will talk, but he'll do what he always does to shoo them away. Things with Sherlock will always be complicated, with the grotesque way he was, and the things he said and the way he went about, but if anything would be complicated, it wouldn't be their relationship. Sherlock made sure to cement his place his in life quite clearly, and never the doubts arose.
When John kissed him for the first time, he was so caught off guard, he had doubted himself. He was crammed in a loop of technique and vulnerabilities and intimacy and experimentation that he hadn't seen it at all.
It's when John won't let him store his specimens in the fridge or leave out his test tubes on the dining table. Or when he needs rabbit food to stimulate his neurons, but he's too lethargic to step out. Sometimes, if he's feeling generous, he'll be enough to lure John back into bed on a frosty morning. The mornings that feel like the world chipping in on, and everything else sods off on the sight of them.
It would only be fair if she was a bit like Sherlock too, with how he went about in his contemporary style of raising children (read: Rosie) in a way that he thought was right. She went about with a notepad in her back pocket and a pencil behind her ear, observing and writing and sometimes humming. It would be alright if she shouted out the Greek alphabet when she was bored. She brought home worms to cut open in the kitchen sink. That's more than John ever hoped for. (Read: prayed not for)
When they're sure they're alone, John presses him up against the dusty wallpaper even if he's shorter and cranes his neck up to snog the whizzing out of Sherlock. His hand might slip between the wall and Sherlock's back and pull them flush against each other. Their breaths mingle like they don't know who it belongs to anymore.
Scotland Yard comes with their wagging tail, simultaneously tucked between their legs and arrests the criminal, heads poised as though they have done all the work. Sherlock couldn't care less; he knows the coppers aren't good enough. Not ever, and that they come to Sherlock for incompetent things- which is everything.
Right, so this included all of them, not just things that were going on with Rosie. This was something they all needed to talk about- as a family. From the corner of his eye, he can see Sherlock grimace at his plate. It's clear he wants to leave, but John doesn't encourage him. "Anything. What is it?"
He stares up at Sherlock with a glint in his eye, pupils dilated so far that his irises are swallowed by it, lips slick and pursed. The proximity between them vows to make it rather difficult. They stare at each other unmovingly like the moment breaks when John takes a step back slowly like fluid, a slight smirk easing itself onto his face and he flips around and makes a run towards Sherlock's bedroom with a laugh that will never get lost into the atmosphere.
John had made that very thought slide into place in Sherlock. Any idiot knew it was reciprocation at it's finest and so Sherlock was suddenly lost in the giddiness of it, rather than the task of scouring through his mind palace for better tips at snogging. That was something he could reflect upon when the moment didn't demand his full attention. He thought less about how two dimensional or cumbersome it was and zeroed in on the chapped skin of John's lips.
And so, John runs and gives chase.
"Not a word out of you," John scolds. It's too late to take it back and the parent in him is celebrating his dictatorship. "Now, sit. Put something in your mouth and don't talk."
John frowns at the direction it's taking- half with curiosity and the other with a horror of what's to come. He hums a little off key that sounds confused.
John makes a clatter as he drops the platter of toast on to the table. "Actually, don't tell me. It isn't worth a loss of appetite."
It was only much later, did he cringe at himself. But, when John laughed at him every time he shouted at the telly, it seemed alright.
He tries not to look at Sherlock's despondent face as he uncrosses his feet at the ankles, snakes it forward till he's reached Sherlock's bare feet that are attached to his pole-like legs, and runs his toes along the length of Sherlock's foot. The action makes Sherlock jolt in his seat.
Sherlock hums dismissively. He brings out a cup and saucer, and tea leaves from the cupboard, plucks the simmering kettle from the stovetop before John can stop him. The water ribbons out and gurgles over his words. "You can hear where the telly is on even when it's on mute because it emits high-frequency waves. She's watching the Sunday Morning cartoons." He mixes his tea and clanks the spoon against the rim of the cup. John watches as he drinks and winces at the taste. At least, he doesn't rely on Mrs Hudson for it anymore. It's another small victory that John considers; forcing Sherlock to make his own tea until it's a routine.
Rosie nods sagely. "Yes, Dad. You didn't notice for years that Sherlock was-"
"You utter piecan," mutters John as always, and kisses him bitingly.
These, Sherlock initiates.
Their curtains are mostly never drawn; anyone could look in and see them snogging like teenagers in heat. Somehow, it makes Sherlock want to be careless.
They sit for breakfast and make light conversation about Rosie's school- the homework, a clique who think they're too cool, grouchy teachers- and then, Sherlock and Rosie are engrossed in a conversation that involves dissection of cardiomegalies. By now, John is used to it, being a doctor and a working partner to Sherlock. It still strikes him with wonder, though, when Rosie is so interested, with her eyes wide and her head brimming with questions.
Then, Sherlock glances up at him questioningly. He hopes his eyes say everything- after all, the man is Sherlock Holmes, he who deduces everything. They continue to peer at each other while John lets his toes wander up Sherlock's ankles. They have to talk about it later, when Rosie isn't listening. When they make sure Rosie is creeping up on them again.
These days, Sherlock has become accustomed to matching his gaze to John's for approval whilst his interactions with the public. He's watched John make excuses for his behaviour, long when he couldn't care. But, as time went by, Sherlock acknowledged the feeling of wanting to do deeds right, just to feel like he was good enough for John.
It all came with Sherlock. And John could do nothing short but love it all- the havoc, the ridiculous routine, the flourish. He would be lying if he said that was an excuse because it isn't. As much as it seemed so, it wasn't easy. They were two men trying to figure out fatherhood in the practical sense, and nothing was as stressful or as crazy as that. Especially when Sherlock hadn't signed up for it, but sat by patiently during the years, helping out mostly and keeping his commentary to himself.
"Because he knew it would be worth," Sherlock finally answers for himself. The low timbre of his voice makes John shiver. Barely a minute ago, John was thinking the man before was an utter wimp- but now he can't help but think it's so brave for him to talk. Sherlock doesn't do things like that for anyone. "Even if it meant that it wasn't reciprocated, he knew he didn't have a choice and that was alright with him because John Watson is an extraordinary man- perhaps too extraordinary."
Most times, John is accustomed to it, but only sometimes does his mock temper drill through and dance on his eyebrows as he looks through the charade. And he knows, but probably doesn't know Sherlock knows that he knows. He's a nutter, either way.
At that moment stuck in time, Sherlock moves and breaks the evenness. He cracks a tiny smile, the smallest of quirks when one side of his mouth does it. For another moment, he looks at John unwavering, like he has to take all of him in. In retaliation, he curls his foot around one of John's socked feet. That's good enough- it's a confirmation that it's going to be alright. That they're going to take the road not taken, and enjoy it.
"Dad?" Rosie breaks his reverie by speaking right into his ear.
He gets what he's wanted. That and a little more.
Sherlock interrupts her. His tone is anything but assertive and loud- it sounds resigned and placid. "Rosamund."
Wrinkling his eyebrows, John can't help but ask. "Why were you titrating?"
As usual, he has his guard up and John can't decipher anything from his body language or face. It's infuriating how he can shut down blank and build a wall away from John. "It was a secret. They're meant to be kept and if your father respects me, he won't speak of this again. If you respect me, you will not make your memories afresh and not store this somewhere where you will weaponise it."
"But, Sherlock-"
That's nothing to dwell on.
Another armchair joined the bunch in the living room, and Sherlock still had his fits, except instead of shooting walls, he chose to blast metal music into a pair of noise-cancelling headphones. It was nothing like him, but it also explained how much he cared for Rosie.
“Okay. It’s not…clean.”

Further confirmation that John believed he spoke those words in safety, to an oxygen-deprived mind that wouldn’t recall them either way.

At first, when there was Sherlock, I was talked at. Extensively. And I even kept up at times, I should think-- whatever little he had to say on History or Economics intrigued me, but mostly I was strung along on a complex, meandering path of self-discovery, both scientific and emotional.  The days Sherlock railed on man’s fickle, sentimental nature were when I knew he had upset someone, and had been upset in return. The feverish, staccato-infused monologues that followed, on molecules and other incomprehensible things, indicated rejuvenation-- a sanitisation from feelings. A fresh firing of neurons, ideas sparking off each other, waiting for something doused in gasoline to offer itself up.

Sherlock thinks John sees the answer on his face. He tries for levity. “If I had slept with you previously, I believe I would remember.” John lets out a nervous laugh, and Sherlock adds, “It would be impossible to delete.”
Wordlessly, Sherlock places one hand on Moriarty’s nape, and using the other, plunges the syringe into his neck, pushing the liquid down-
“Sherlock.

John stares at the ceiling until his eyes hurt.
John dreams of afternoons, when the sun trickles like thick, golden honey, and settles in fallen feathers, crowding every nook and corner of 221B, Baker Street. Sherlock sits in the armchair, and John sits opposite him, in a leisurely anticipation that unfurls the small, winded knot in his chest.
And John Watson, to his delirious delight, is not allowed to finish the sentence.
Since long before. Before the two years of unending Siberian snow, crusting everything in lonely sameness. Before preferring to call, unfamiliar tears collecting beneath his chin, and cooling on his face. Before sharing toothpaste and an off-brand shampoo at an inn he did not want to leave. Before standing surrounded by chlorinated water, but with nothing to put out his burning heart.
“So,” John smooths back a curl near Sherlock’s temple, lazily tracing his cheekbone, “About Irene-”
John freezes, one hand on the doorjamb. He waits for Sherlock to fully explain— or add the usual, witty undercut— but Sherlock just stares at him, stubbornly,
“Sherlock?”

“Hmm, I don’t use it very often,” Sherlock replies. John edges closer, puts a hand on his hip bone. “You could give me a reason to.” John smiles wide at that, and then, astonishingly, pulls Sherlock on top of him.

holding onto me.”
"No Sherlock, you can't do that." Molly places a hand on his shoulder. "You've lead him in enough circles."
“Yes, darling,” Sherlock deadpans, hand reaching out impatiently.
Truth be told, it was I who began to tire of him first. By the third year, I was acclimated to his brilliance, I no longer marvelled at it as I used to. Perhaps he saw this, and was offended-- perhaps some mysterious pattern in my ossified cells signalled to him, urging him to find someone who would not only think ‘amazing’ and ‘fantastic’, but say the words out loud; who would not think of their buxom, long-dead, almost-fiancé in Rhine while he lovingly played Mendelssohn. Someone, whose interests aligned neatly with his, condensing inwards to a single focal point-- Sherlock Holmes himself. And so began the era of John Watson.
John’s smile only widens. The taxi takes a sharp turn, and their shoulders bump.
“I see,” he says, in a low voice.
“You hate my clothes.”
“John,” he begins, tentatively, “I apologise for-”
Is that how desperate he’s become, to keep John here? To ruin his dates?
Sherlock would quit, quit

I share the mantelpiece with a host of other items. The Lucky Cat, an Oriental curiosity, picked up without payment from a smuggler’s antique shop. The Penknife, slipped out without remorse from the back pocket of the Czech ambassador- as disassociated from his letter opener as his country became from the Soviet. There was even, at one point, The Woman’s Phone- an artefact of double thievery, of double bluff. Yes, the mantelpiece is a shrine to stolen goods, carefully curated by our eccentric owner. It is a wonder he hasn’t carved out John’s Heart and placed it right next to us, the organ oozing blood and naked fondness. For who better to recognise denial, than the dead? The living room reeks of unsaid affection and bitterness (there was a hiatus, yes, during which I was grateful for the housekeeper’s-- beg pardon, landlady’s intermittent dusting).

He found me during his dark period (i.e.: fix-craving, dry-mouth, slow-to-blink days). Stole me from his dealer’s mahogany cabinet, (didn’t care much for that top drawer. It was dusty, cramped. I was wedged next to shot glasses from Las Vegas. Highly indecent cartoon breasts) while the man searched for his digital weighing scale. I was then transferred to a duffel bag, containing the aforementioned scale and a pound of cocaine. My initial characterisation of Sherlock as an addict and kleptomaniac was, needless to say, half incorrect (or half correct. I am, at heart (ha!), a critical being).
