Whichever was the correct answer, he wouldn’t change it for the world.
Sherlock’s smile softened into something faint. “Good,” he said. “Now, let’s go for a walk.”
by any means, but he wasn’t tall, either, and the burette suddenly seemed like the bloody Eiffel tower when he was trying to balance a funnel atop a skinny opening, stand on his tip-toes, and pour a steady stream of skin-corrosive chemical down said funnel, all at once.
“Where is she?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and stared out the window sullenly.
“Why?” John had said, frustrated.

—and then it was guilt tangling with the jealousy, because John was Sherlock’s friend, one of his closest if not his best, and if he wasn’t here to support him through this then he might as well just write ‘asshole’ over his forehead along with ‘in love with his best friend’
Sherlock had a
“What the fuck,” he said loudly.
“So what was it this time?” John called out from his seat. “Another experiment of yours gone wrong?”
“Sherlock!” John yelped in a very undignified way, arms outstretched—needlessly, it seemed, for the kitten landed perfectly on four feet in the middle of the floor without a single noise. She blinked, and then twisted around to peer up at Sherlock, big eyes all affront and haughty disbelief.
"Fine," Sherlock said. "Mike still can't count to four, apparently."
"Hey, Sherlock," Irene said. "Wanna go to the dance with me?"
It clicked shut, and they were silent for a moment before both bursting into uncontrollable bouts of bubbling laughter.
that coat, too!
“Do you think you could purr?” John asked him.
“Good morning, John,” Sherlock said, casually, as if he stood point-blank from the door to John’s room every single morning. Which, now that John thought of it, wouldn’t be as unrealistic as it should’ve been. He thought about it some more, then was unnerved by how not unnerved he was at the thought.
Sherlock stopped his footsteps right in front of the kitten, who fixed her eyes upon his.
John made a small noise in his throat. Seeing Sherlock like this—like he was truly, genuinely, absolutely in
“Sherlock,” John said, desperately.
“Why did you do that?” John asked.
John brushed his teeth, went downstairs, and reached for the kettle, when he noticed that it was gone. In its place, a bunsen burner stood smack-dab in the middle of the counter.
“Um, nothing,” Emma said, the same time Sherlock said, “She wanted you to introduce yourself, John, not give her my life story.”
That is, until John and Sherlock knocked on her door one day to drop the cat off in her arms, purring and still sleepy from the morning sun. They left for Scotland Yard, spent most of the afternoon chasing a jewellery thief across the city and through the rooftops, and came back wild-eyed and hot-blooded, hearts still pounding a tattoo into their chests.
“How’s Mary?” Sherlock said.
"Language," Sherlock scolded, but his eyes were sparkling and his lips tugged into a bright, happy smile.
This was followed by a long pause, only punctuated by the background chatter of the rest of the students meandering their way through their own titrations. John was willing to bet money no one else screwed it up as much as he did. Fantastic. Now Sherlock thought he was awkward, forgetful,
"Can we just leave and walk through the forest instead? The salamanders come out at this hour."
“Close your eyes,” Sherlock said.
“Nothing,” both Sherlock and Lestrade said at the same time.
To avoid responding, Sherlock tipped the cup to his mouth.
He looked up and towards Sherlock, a strange little light in his eyes. “And, might I add,
“What do you want,” Sherlock said flatly.
“Of course,” Sherlock said, too quickly, and stepped to the side.
Warmth ghosted over the corner of his mouth.
“John,” Sherlock said with a tinge of warning, and then, “John!”
Next to him, John grumbled, nudged awake from his almost-slumber. “Hmm?”
“Tell me, John,” he said, “does it honestly matter that much to you? Are you as judgemental as to change your opinion on me because of a hastily slapped-on label? Shove me into your neat little societal boxes?”
“Oh, that was his favourite,” Mrs. Hudson remarked. “Hissed up a storm every time I got close to that thing. I was just trying to hoover.”
“You know it’s true,” John said, ignoring the way Sherlock slipped his cover back on, vulnerability quickly fading away; the way the tugging in his chest began to twist. Fuck, he was the worst kind of person, brushing Sherlock off like that right when he was beginning to open up, turning his feelings into a stupid joke. So Sherlock liked someone else, big deal. Suck it up. He didn’t have the right to make fun of it every time, like it didn’t mean anything at all. What was he even doing?
, I’d definitely be creeped.” He tilted his head. “Does this guy know you well enough that he’d be creeped?”
to walk with me every day, but—"
Sherlock looked at John closer and his brows drew together. “What’s wrong?”
“Oh, really?”
“What did you do this time?” John said irritatingly.
Sherlock backed away before John could remember. He kept a hand on the back of John’s neck, a thumb lightly brushing across his pulse point, back and forth, back and forth. John thought faintly that if he kept doing that his artery would burst out of his skin. “Does that answer your question?”
and, and
Sherlock chewed on the inside of his cheek, lips twisting.
John was sure he could tell it wasn’t just the movie. But Sherlock stayed quiet, didn’t push, didn’t joke about it, and John didn’t deserve him at all, so it was good that Sherlock liked someone else, really.
And—oh, how he had.
John stared at Sherlock from paces away, and then it clicked so hard and fast it felt like someone had just roundhouse-kicked him in the ribcage.

Sherlock smiled. “No.”

That endless patience seemed to approach a slight deficit. Sherlock rolled his eyes, and reached out to take John’s hand. He intertwined their fingers together and held it between the two of them, squeezing tight and reassuring. “Do I have to do

"He would've said something already."
a little and Sherlock did it back, and John smiled passive aggressively and made sure she could see their joined hands over the counter and, later, him kissing the whipped cream off the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. He was taking no chances.
Upon hearing John come downstairs, he typed something, pressed the
They still went on cases, sometimes. London crime stopped for no one, not even a cat.
He glared at a grinning Irene Adler. "Say that a little louder, why don't you?"
Sherlock watched as John flexed his fingers, fire skittering up and twirling off in bursts of smoke. He nodded.
And if his parents had taken photos when they came back from their date and saw the two of them tangled together—well, ignorance was bliss, and Sherlock needed a little more of both.
John resisted the urge to yell. “Toast,” he said.
“That’s really sweet,” Emma cooed. “I can tell that you really do like him. When did you realize you had a crush on him?”
“Chainsaw would never do such a thing,” Mrs. Hudson said curtly.
"At least we don't have the overpriced pop," John said.
“Not that I don’t mind,” John said, ignoring how hoarse his voice had gotten and hoping Sherlock would pass it off as a morning’s lack of use, “but, uh, could you move?”
CIBC, seriously, do your goddamn research before you try to scam somebody and don’t give me that half-assed work. At least the emails get the bloody
“Let’s go for a walk,” Sherlock said.
For a moment, John didn’t say anything. Then: “Alright.”
-+-+-+-
He popped open the compartment. There were no batteries inside.
“It’s just catnip—”
Sherlock poked his head through from the kitchen. “Hello, John.”
“And I have a gift for you, too—” He twisted over to his bedside table and grabbed the nail clippers.
Words like,
“What’s the matter, John?” they said.
Sherlock turned over so that he was facing John. The corners of his lips quirked up. “Now, I see another.”
“You’re my secret santa,” Sherlock said, his voice high and quick and desperate. “You’re the one I have a crush on. It’s you, John, it’s been you the whole time.”
“John won’t be happy,” Sherlock tried one last time, but his eyes were falling closed, too, half-lidded, and his hand was coming up to rest on Picasso’s warm body.
Sherlock's eyes were some curious blend of colours, all greens and blues and greys.
Sherlock sounded mildly confused. “You told me to be nice.”
Sherlock ignored him. He was shielding his phone from John, holding it angled away so that John couldn’t see the screen. Sherlock pressed a single button to call—because of course he had it saved in his contacts. John realized how much he was behaving like a stupid, vindictive teenager, but he didn’t particularly care at the moment.
As Sherlock retracted his hand, John felt simultaneously relieved and disappointed. Borne out of a sheer desperation to get this bloody lab done and finished with so he could go back to absent, safe pining from a distance, John clasped the flask with his free hand and began to move it in fast, tight circles.
“I told you to be less of an asshole than usual! Not—fucking

“John,” Sherlock said, and actually meant,
That is, until he emerged from the school, freshly-showered, only to spot a familiar coat-clad figure standing at the entrance, leaning against the brick wall.
It was barely a third of a kilo and fit right in the palm of John’s hand like a stone clasped in his palm, curled up so small you couldn’t even see its ears. Fuzzy all around like a tiny, breathing kiwifruit; white with speckles and splotches of beige, brown, black. Calico. Around three weeks old, it seemed, from its barely-there fluff to its quiet snuffles as it slumbered on, blissfully unaware. Still damp from the rainstorm outside—should be ending at around eight or so and it was just past seven, had been raining all day in a permanent dreary downpour, barely just tapering down into a drizzle when the two of them, strolling home from a night out at Angelo’s, stumbled and nearly tripped over the soggy cardboard box on their way home.
“I’ll never be normal again,” he said, accidentally out loud.
Not trusting himself enough to look at Sherlock, John nodded to indicate that he was listening.
-+-+-+-
“Oh would you, now?” Sherlock said, his gaze suddenly turning intense.
“Good.” John exhaled, the surge of happiness bubbling inside him about to bowl him over if he didn’t find an outlet for it soon. “Now get over here, you idiot.”
and you just—you were so fucking oblivious that I thought I had misinterpreted it all, but then it wasn’t, but you kept talking about the stupid
“How did you know my size?” John said.
“Look, Sherlock,” John said. “It was thoughtful of you to make me tea, but I can do it myself.”
he said. “John, would you like to go on a date with me?”
John felt something simmering in his chest, fury and freezing shock and a fiery, pulsing hope, a maelstrom of emotions too tangled to decipher. “Sherlock,” he said, reaching for his hand. Sherlock snatched it away, clutching his hands to his chest.
“Playing dirty, now, are we?” Mycroft said mildly, and Sherlock opened his mouth to retort when, all of a sudden, a tiny bundle of Calico fur dashed into view and, hissing and spitting up a storm, collided into Mycroft’s legs.
John raised an eyebrow as high as it could go.
John’s steps slowed at the halls at the empty kitchen. The toaster was unplugged, the burners were off and cold, and there wasn’t a single soul in sight.
It was motherless and cold and most likely sick, most likely weak as the day it was born and just as blind with exhaustion and hunger. It was dirty and smelled like musty pavement and grass.
He had poured about half the beaker when his hand wobbled precariously, solution splashing up the rim of the funnel.
“And I am very resolutely fixing that,” he said, voice smooth and melodic. “I’m Sherlock Holmes. It’s great to meet you, Molly.”
one,” Sherlock said.
He had to admit, it was nice to see
John ran to catch up to Sherlock. He nearly collided into him, veering at the last second so that he gave him a friendly punch on the shoulder before slowing to match Sherlock's stride.
“Yes,” Sherlock said.
"Everyone in the bloody school knows!"
Sherlock scrunched up his nose. Blush was a good look on him, John decided. “No.”
“What?” John said again.
“Oh—no,” Sherlock said, voice still quiet but firmer, now. “Picasso, we have had this conversation before.”
He lowered the cup. His throat moved as he swallowed. His eyebrows furrowed.
“He hates me,” John said. “I—it’s like I can’t do anything right around him. He’s constantly correcting me, telling me what to do, insulting me. I can’t stand it.”
-+-+-+-
“Nothing,” Sherlock said.
“No—” John started, but trailed off at the end of the syllable when Molly returned with two steaming paper cups, lids removed to allow for a generous swirl of whipped cream.
“You distracted me!” John accused.
Picasso climbed until she was all the way up on Sherlock’s shoulder, her body draped over the back of his neck like a warm, cuddly scarf, and then she settled down, melting into place with a quiet, content purr. A lazy, curious paw flitted up and batted at Sherlock’s ear before she took it into her mouth, tiny inquisitive kittenlicks and sharp nips of teeth. Pinpricks.
"The, uh," John stammered. "The dance. On Friday."
John blew out an amused breath. “You’re not jealous, are you?”
“Sebastian Wilkes,” John said.
“Hey, Molly!” John waved at the barista, who paused from tapping something on the register and looked up, a smile breaking across her face.
“But—”
The fingers on John’s right hand curled into his palm, suddenly and significantly aware of the fourth. He remembered it fit snugly. It seemed clamped, now; choked, with a strange chill in the silver band.
“Then, it’s closure.”
“What?” the cleared convict said.
“Fuck,” he hissed under his breath. His depth perception was shot to shit at this angle.
“Sherlock here has a little secret, you see.” Sebastian stood up from his desk. “John, I can see that you’re wearing gloves. I think Sherlock might need them more than you.”
“Alright. Why not?” John said, curiosity piqued.
he’s saying,
John felt fire ants crawling up and down his neck. "That, uh, the meatballs in the cafeteria are made of horse meat."
Sherlock reached her first, right as she rounded the corner to the kitchen, swooping down low to scoop her up. Her fur was damp; his nostrils stung with the astringent scent of fresh paint. The cat flailed in his arms and Sherlock tightened his hold, pulled her in closer, already surrendering his (fourth) favourite shirt to the stamping of pink pawprints.
of an asshole than you usually are. You want to impress him, and making the barista cry is decidedly
“I’m fine,” he said.
“Hmm,” Sherlock said.
"The whole gym smells like sweat and anxiety."
“I told you,” the man said with a scowl, turning, “it wasn’t me.”
John swallowed. Sherlock rarely let anyone in on his feelings, hence the name of Ice Queen (and
“Okay,” John said again. Wow, he sure was making a phenomenal first impression. He blinked some more, and tore himself back to reality enough to say something that wasn’t ‘okay’. “I’m John, by the way. John Watson.”
John shrugged and looked away. “Obviously I’m not your date, but I know you well enough that,
“Oh,” John said, taken aback. “So it’s a he. I mean, not that I’m surprised, because—well, you’ve told me before, not explicitly but you know what I mean. I’m fine with that, of course, obviously, because hey, I swing both ways myself, but—”
“I’m Emma,” she replied, her smile relaxing into something more natural as she shifted her attention to John. “I’m a third-year film major. I was wondering if you’d like to take part in a project? I’ll just ask you a few questions, it’ll be kind of an interactive thing. I’ll need you to speak and for you to be filmed, but I can leave your names out if you’d wish.”
He was eternally, forevermore, and infinitely indebted to her for reacting the way she did. That is to say, to pat him on the shoulder and firmly refuse. “Give it a few more weeks,” she had said. “Just until the end of the month.”
“Bullshit,” John said. “You didn’t even try.”
Sherlock wordlessly held it towards John, a high flush giving away his nervousness. “It’s a gift,” he muttered.
of all days, not even when Sherlock had been acting jittery and odd and overall strange for all those days as well. Maybe Sherlock was experimenting with the fire alarms again. Maybe he was trying to reprogram them so that they automatically turned out every time Mycroft entered the building again.
-+-+-+-
John held it together for two seconds before bursting into a fit of laughter. "It really is," he said, once he'd regained his breath.
“Wait,” John said, suddenly quiet, his voice filled with a dawning realization and a shimmering, barely held-back hope. “No. Really?”
“Great!” Emma piped up. “Let’s move off the path to not block anyone else.”
Sherlock sighed a little, though John didn’t really understand why—it’s not like he knew enough to know anything. “He’s not a figure skater. He did hockey growing up.”
-+-+-+-
Feeling his glare soften into a pitiful stare, John studied the aimless doodles he was making on his Chemistry homework (that, despite what he told Sherlock the day before, he absolutely did not even touch). "No."
"Spit it out, John."
Sherlock sat at the dinner table, staring at an empty plate while John stared at him. They’d played a decent game of cat-and-mouse, but John had him cornered and he was not going to let this go. Not anymore.
asked you to the dance?"
“Oh, fuck,” John said. “No, he. Um. I told him you made me tea and asked him why and he told me you were in love with me.” He was absolutely shocked he managed to string together all those pronouns without swapping them up, especially when his brain had turned into a huge steaming pile of mush somewhere in the back of his head.
When John held him while he bled out in the hot desert sand, staining the grains a brilliant scarlet, Helders looked up at John and smiled. He raised a hand until his trembling fingertips touched John’s cheek.
“My concentration is a very delicate thing.”
“Wow, way to look on the bright side,” John said flippantly. “I mean, I guess it depends on the person. So at least tell me something about them. Throw me a bone here. An—an olive branch.”
“My apologies,” Sherlock said lightly. “Let’s start again. So you were carrying your books…”
John didn’t know if he was desperate, lonely, or just plain bored to all hell, but he made his decision to move in that very second.
“Sounds like a bit of a dick, if you ask me,” John said under his breath, accidentally-on-purpose loud enough for Sherlock to hear.
God bless Emma, John thought as Sherlock demonstrated that, though he never did boast about his snogging skills, he certainly wasn’t lacking in the slightest. He might need to send her a fruit basket and a thank-you card later that week.
Sherlock gave John the baleful look that meant
John opened his mouth to find no sound. He shut it, nodded instead.
John looked at Sherlock, whose face was utterly indecipherable as always, and then he ran a hand through his hair and shook his head, once, very quickly, before taking a seat.
When John inquired for the dozenth time, Sherlock finally looked up at him with an icy venom in his eyes.
The faint stirrings of a snowstorm swirled in the sky. John glanced up at the dark, hazy night, dappled with flakes of frost. He opened his mouth and spoke over the wind.
“No problem.” Sherlock’s voice was even, cool, calm, collected. He had already finished setting up the burette, and now moved on to measuring the acid for the beaker. John felt a flash of envy. It wasn’t like John wasn’t smart, in fact he was pretty decent at labs, but he was just… distracted
Sherlock groaned, flicked Lestrade’s grip off of his arm, and turned to Molly. “I’m
By the time the text sent, John had nearly chewed his whole lip off.
“Really?” John asked, once they were close enough to hear.
John’s gaze sidled across the kitchen tiles, danced up the walls, and landed on the fire alarm.
John woke up to the fire alarm.
“We really shouldn’t be out right now,” he said.
“Eggs,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock quirked up an eyebrow, stopping mere inches away. “What do you mean?”
A bloody crush?
“Picasso,” he said slowly, very carefully.
… The coffee table, where a still-steaming cup of tea was sitting delicately on a saucer, right in front of where he usually sat.
“Don’t call me that.” Sherlock scowled and batted John’s hand away. “I told you, it’s stupid.”
“I’m an ass,” he said.
"Wanna go to the dance with me?" John asked.
“Of course,” John said, and wondered briefly why the morgue kept a chainsaw in the storage room.
“Sebastian,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock then raised his hand, and, when he was called on, explained that Ms. Grant had missed a carbon atom in one of her drawings.
John lunged for him, only to be stopped by a hand, icy and firm on the small of his back.
“How many millilitres? Whole fat or skim? Almond, cow, soy, or llama?”
Sherlock snapped his fingers. “Oh, and Christmas Eve.”
—Pablo Picasso
"You asked," Irene said innocently. She swung her backpack onto the ground before dropping into the chair next to him. "But anyway, have you?"
John glanced at Sherlock, whose eyes were slanted into curious slits and drilling into the girl like twin lasers. Despite that, she stood her ground and held it steady, and it gave John a flare of respect towards her.
John said. “Let’s see, so far we have: it’s a guy who I know, who likes skating—specifically hockey—hot chocolate, and rom coms.” He clicked his tongue. “I can’t believe you’ve never told me about this crush of yours until now.”
Molly was just about to lock up, looking forwards to a long night of cuddling with her cats and rewatching Netflix movies, when the door slammed open and Lestrade marched in, dragging a reluctant-looking Sherlock by the arm in a way that seemed like he had taken him by the ear instead.
“First of all, neither of those sayings were used correctly; second of all, you are
John laughed. Sherlock smiled, eyes darting over to John—then frowned. "What about you? You don't have practise today. I thought you'd be home by now."
John stroked Helders’s eyes closed, and then shut his own, feeling everything he’d tried so hard to bury down surging up, bubbling over, his mother’s singing voice drowned in the gunfire.
John squinted up at Sherlock and saw that he had snowflakes in his hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes; stark white against dark hair. He wanted to press his lips to them, feel them melt against his mouth.
“Oh, Jesus,” John muttered before he could stop himself. He couldn’t be here for this.

the kitten.”
From the carpet where he had been steadily pacing, Sherlock abruptly stumbled.
“Fine,” John said.
Right before he could move, Sherlock’s hand came up to cover his again, stopping his motion. “You need to swirl the flask at the same time,” he explained.
He didn’t think. His hands were shaking as he shoved off his gloves, tossed them to the side as if they were disposable blue latex and not crafted by the most sought-after tailor in the whole goddamn country. His skin caught fire immediately, flames licking down the columns of his fingers, thirsty for air. John clenched them into fists and shut his eyes, a plea on his tongue to a deity he didn’t believe in, and breathed. Easy. Slow. Three seconds in and three seconds out.
John thought about it for a while before concluding that, okay, yeah, maybe that was just normal Sherlock.
John said. "Jesus fucking Christ. I cannot believe—a whole shitting
The first few days brought a myriad of trips to the local pet store, calls to Mrs. Hudson, and many, many arguments about whose turn it was to clean the litter box. (John’s—it was always John’s turn.)
John shook his head and let out a short laugh. “Well, here I am. What’s the verdict?”
Sherlock nodded, and they set off again.
The dial tone matched the pitch of the ringing that had started up in his ear.
Sherlock cocked his head. "Hello, John."
“Oh,” John said. “In that case, I’ll make this quick.” He allowed himself half a second to swallow his spit and then blurted,
had also turned utterly invisible as well, because no matter how many coasters he pointedly stacked on the table, Sherlock would completely disregard them. It was infuriating. One of these days John was going to frisbee one of those coasters straight at his neck).
They made their way to the centre of the dancefloor. Sherlock put his hands on John's waist. John put his hands on Sherlock's shoulders.
“What?”
“Nope,” John said stubbornly. “I’m fine.” As if deliberately proving him wrong, his beaker gleefully tilted in the wrong way again.
Relief flooded him. "Thank god," he breathed.
John hadn’t believed him.
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a slip of paper. He held it out to John, who took it in a daze and unfolded it without thinking, his mind still occupied with fruitlessly searching for the rest of that sentence that began with
When John made the bi-yearly call for a replacement pair of gloves, he placed an order for two.
An enigmatic flicker of a smile. “I want to see how he changes your mind.”
“These trousers cost over fifty pounds,” Sherlock proclaimed, opening the lid of the box to reveal an identical small, silver, shiny ring. “There is no chance I am kneeling.”
he’s clean?”
“Toast,” Sherlock said this time.
By the time he was walking the short few blocks from the station to their flat, he had unknowingly broken into a speed walk. He made it home in record time.
Anderson scoffed lightly and looked away. Lestrade made a bit of a choking sound in his throat, and then again, and then Anderson realized that he was laughing. Which was strange, because insults were beyond common between them, and it wasn’t even a particularly good one at that. But Lestrade was laughing, loud and open and carefree, and he even wiped a finger across the corner of his eye when he thumped a scowling Sherlock on the back.
A gust of wind picked up and wrapped itself around John’s shoulders, the thin cotton of his t-shirt providing little protection against the chilling embrace. John pressed his lips together and said, “It’s nearly midnight.”
On instinct, John’s hands shot out and steadied him.
-+-+-+-
“Hmm,” Emma said. “On second thought, this would go smoother if only one of you answered.”
Sherlock raised an arm and placed it across John’s shoulders, tugging him a bit closer. “Like this?”
This time, he grabbed the pillow he wasn’t currently lying on, thrust it into his face, and groaned into the silky, lemon-smelling fabric.
been right―he’d seen the man walk out the station a while ago through his window, which he used often for people-watching and the sorts, a preferred pastime of his for long, dreary hours. Contrary to popular opinion, most of Scotland Yard spent their shifts making water-cooler gossip and betting on when John and Sherlock would finally get their shit together and kiss already. The running-after-serial-killers, interrogating murderers, and breaking and entering? That was just Sherlock. And he wasn’t even an actual police.
“I’m allergic to cats,” Sherlock said.
“Um,” Molly said.
“Profanity, John,” Sherlock said, coming down the stairs. He stopped by the foot of the stairs and his eyes narrowed. “You called Mycroft,” he said accusingly.
Mrs. Hudson was redecorating her flat. Time for a renovation, she had said cheerily, pulling out a few paintchips from her pocket that morning. After verifying that there was proper ventilation and that the paint was non-toxic, they had dropped her off and commenced the case.
Lestrade made a rolling motion with his hand, directed towards Sherlock. “You aren’t gonna…?” His tone was prompting.
“Bugger that,” he said. “It’s formative anyways.”
(Not her words verbatim, but it rang out loud and clear for all of them to hear beneath the coy, subtle hints of press vocabulary.)
John flapped his arms a little trying to gesture at Sherlock. “Maybe for others,” he scolded, “but for you, that had decidedly crossed the boundary of platonic interest. God, you said—please and thank you. What the
"Glad we sorted that out," Sherlock said, and was walking down the street once again.
"What did she tell you?" Dread, thick and black, dawned in his stomach.
Molly looked at John with a little bit of concern. “Uh-huh,” she said. “And?”
“Mycroft,” John said, relief seeping through his shoulders. “Thank god.” He paused. “Wait, one fifth?”
“I think I’ll have to thank Mycroft,” Sherlock said, sounding like the words gutted him.
Sherlock tilted his head at him for a moment, then said, “Better now that you’re here with me.” And then he winked.
“I’ll see you around,” Sherlock said.
John's throat unlocked with an audible

Sherlock was awoken by a damp, warm paw descending right onto his sternum. With a quiet

“Fantastic,” Sherlock murmured. “Now, let’s fix this titration before Mrs. Darcy fails us both.”
“Excellent hypothesis,” Sherlock said, and he was smiling. “So what if I am? What’s your conclusion?”
“Yeah, yeah,” John said, playfully knocking his shoulder against Sherlock’s. “Anyway, he spilled his coffee all over both of us. It was dreadful. At least I got a bit of redemption because I was carrying two textbooks for his class.”
The case wrapped up in an all-too-familiar, similar fashion. A clean break, save for the one line of fine print that John hadn’t known was there until it was forcibly put on a pedestal, the one that had supposedly been etched into Sherlock for years and years. A slow-acting poison.
he trailed off into a strangled sound and then picked up from where he left off, rattling off words like rapidfire. “It’s just that he sounds like a strange guy right now and I just wanna know why you like someone like that, not that I’m judging you on your crush choices! I just wanna know, but it’s totally cool if you’re creeped out at me asking and how fast I’m talking right now and how nosy I am and oh my god, I have got to shut up, commence shutting up.” He clamped his mouth shut and mimed zipping his lips.
“Be nice,” John said. “I know you’re a complete asshole, but maybe just be
John raised his eyebrows at the teabag he was currently dunking up and down in his mug of hot water. “Tell that to the Erlenmeyer Flask you exploded last night.”
Moments passed. John felt a tremor run through him, draining the tension into a dull heartache. He curled his shoulders in on himself.
A smile was spreading on Sherlock’s face, molasses-slow. “It worked, didn’t it?”
“I didn’t,” Sherlock said, and he finally broke with a bluebell of laughter, faint and amused. “I called my crush. He just said yes.”
“That must be annoying,” he decided. “I guess I can add ‘oblivious’ to the list, then, right?”
“What?” John said. “Wait, so you mean—”
The silence stretched.
He stayed quiet until they had taken a seat. “I don’t know about your secret santa, but I’d definitely be jealous if my date was talking to the barista like that.”
John's mind was still stuck on the fact that
“Yeah,” John sighed.
"But, I, uh."
“Well, you’ve already seen me cry, so you can feel slightly less uncomfortable when
"No!" John said, and then fought to keep his voice level. "No, not at all, that's not what I meant. I just meant—they asked you?"
all of those things.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, placing both drinks on the table and sliding one to John. “Like what? Please and thank you?” He gasped a little.
bad day and decided to take it all out on John Watson, because right then and there, right at the worst possible time, his phone vibrated in his pocket.
“I’m allergic to
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. The cat narrowed them back. The fur on the back of her neck puffed up like a heated marshmallow in a fire.
Molly stared after them for a long time. Then, she sighed, shook her head with a quick flick, and continued packing up. That Netflix show was sounding really good all of a sudden.
“We are not going to use our cat as a
Sherlock’s eyes held level with his. Pale and shimmering, they glowed a faded blue in the inky night air.
Sherlock said, and his voice was all of a sudden
“Pleasure talking to you both,” Sebastian said. “John, I’d suggest you remember what I told you. Despite what you may think, I am truly trying to help. This isn’t about his quirk, it’s about who he is.”
Molly’s brain froze, then threw up its hands, flipped her the bird, and quit. She blinked, and blinked some more, and said, “Um.”
He blinked, not realizing the stinging in his eyes until it was too late.
more than what she does to you.”
John watched Sherlock for a moment.
Downstairs, Sherlock was, once again, standing in the middle of the kitchen, standing right in front of the sink—
Goddamnit, John thought with a sinking resignation in his gut. There was no way Sherlock, cool calm and collected Sherlock, analytical over emotional Sherlock, logic above heart Sherlock, would have a crush. Just the words
“I’ll see you there,” Sebastian said, glancing at John’s hands.
John tilted his head, pursed his lips.
Sherlock didn’t respond.
Right. Yeah. So maybe John had a little crush.
Sherlock took another sip. “Neutral hmm.”
His royal majesty, the ice princess? What did the papers say? A sociopathic machine? Do you honestly think you can stick around without getting, pardon the pun—frostbitten? Personal experience says a resounding no.”
call, and all of a sudden he’s getting 1-800s like a stampede of overattached parents. Ones who were adamant that his nonexistent CIBC bank account has been compromised, and to please provide his credit card info to avoid additional losses.
There was a glint in Sherlock’s eyes. “How?”
“What?” John said to the first part of Sherlock’s dialogue, and then, “Wait,
Sherlock stroked her ears, flaky from nearly-dried paint. He rubbed his fingers together absentmindedly.
“It wasn’t him,” Lestrade squeezed out, painful as thick mashed potatoes through a ricer.
After, John shuffled in closer, his own arm coming up from under the covers to take Sherlock’s hand. He kissed Sherlock’s thumb, where the kitten had bit it that very first night, then traced his way down every finger, smacking a kiss at the centre of his palm before trailing down, further, nipping at his wrist.
Sherlock sat in the far right corner of the entire classroom, the one next to the window. He never raised his hand, but one time in September when Mrs. Darcy had called on him anyway, he had rattled off the right answer without missing a beat, and then followed that with the answers to the three extension questions she was going to ask after. He didn’t get called on often after that—not unless the professor knew no one else had the answer, and didn’t want to give the class the satisfaction of answering it herself. He didn’t talk much. He was, John suspected, the bearer of the highest mark in the class.
“She would enjoy it. Substantially.”
Mycroft’s smile was wan.
Sherlock quickly hid his paper. Colour tinged on his cheeks, stark against pale skin. He swallowed. “I―”
—it wasn’t supposed to be like this.)
As if they didn’t have everything she had to say memorized (which wasn’t an exaggeration—lunch-hour teacher complaints wouldn’t be complete without one of Mrs. Darcy’s students, past or current, reciting the infamous pre-lab speech completely verbatim). Honestly, you would think that, rather than Twelfth Year, they were
“Why are they called comedies if they make people cry?” Sherlock mused.
Stella Watson hated spicy foods. Every date she went on with her future husband was over ice water and mild curry, nothing higher, never more. But they rarely ate out, because she could cook like nobody’s business. It was her quirk, after all. Her husband had took on the less common, but often sought-after, quirk for flowers, and their garden flourished with azaleas and lavender in the spring.
“Not quite,” Emma said. “You don’t need to tell me a name, but can you tell me why you have a crush on them?”
Sherlock halted. “He’s not—”
Sherlock tightened his lips and blinked rapidly at the folded sheet of paper in his hands.

The only downside was the lack of a morning cuppa, and this John mourned silently as he trudged his way to the coffee table.
And Amanda was hugging Graham, now, her face streaked with tears that hadn’t fallen since she was fifteen. John felt more like Iris at the moment—snivelling at the slightest mishap. God, he was a mess.
John paused, looked at Sherlock hopefully. “But you do like me?”
“Jesus Christ!” he shouted.
“Shit,” he breathed out.
He coughed. “Yeah.”
John read from the tag. “Oh.”
“You’ll get fur all over the mattress,” Sherlock murmured. “You’ll vomit all over the pillows after having a nightmare.”
"I'm doing an investigation on their secretion."
Not that the second point mattered, John thought bitterly. Yesterday, John had waited by Sherlock's locker for ages until Mike had come up and informed him that Sherlock had gone home already.
He didn’t ask again.
-+-+-+-
John tore his hand away and watched with a sinking anvil in his heart shuddering down to the pit of his stomach as the place he had touched Miranda bloomed into a ruddy-pink burn.
Sherlock’s eyes shone as he grabbed John’s hand. Lightly stroking his knuckles, Sherlock bent his head down to brush a kiss to the back of John's hand, and then slipped on the ring.
Glancing up, Sherlock’s eyes were skeptical. Not confused, but they held an ounce of trepidation and more than a little caution. John looked closer and saw the minuscule flicker of hope.
“Pour fifty millilitres of that through the funnel and into the burette,” he instructed. “I’ll write down the procedure in the meantime.”
Sherlock’s head was lowered. John followed his gaze to his hands.
“Hey!” Sherlock protested.
-+-+-+-
“You’re a terrible instructor,” Sherlock said.
“Mate, don’t reuse lines,” Lestrade said. “That’s cheap.”
Sherlock dropped his hands from John’s shoulders. “What?”
Sherlock shut his mouth and swallowed. “Yeah?”
"It is," Sherlock agreed.
John glanced at the bright-purple solution in the flask, and then at his hand, tangled in Sherlock’s.
John slapped a hand over Irene's mouth, glaring as hard as he could. Irene widened her eyes at him in defeat, and John cautiously dropped his hand, wiping it on his jeans and grimacing at the feeling of lipstick on his palms.
“Now, just because this is a formative lab does not mean you are permitted to fool around: remember, this is the formative to your lab

suddenly rushed into his mind like a flash flood. “Sherlock, oh god, Sherlock, love, I’m so sorry, I didn’t know, I thought you were hiding something

Molly flushed and giggled softly. “It’s my pleasure,” she said. “What can I get for you today?”
Sherlock muttered something under his breath that John would bet anything was
Yes, maybe they had come to an agreement that as long as Sherlock didn’t try to analyze her fur or her spit or her blood, god forbid, she wouldn’t destroy his lab samples or vomit in his slippers or try to brutalize his violin whenever he played it, screeching and wailing along—but she still clawed at him and batted at his hair and tried to climb up his arm with her sharp little claws, and Sherlock still had constant scratches and red marks on his hands from whenever she nipped at his fingers when he petted her ears.
“You’ll stay,” Sherlock murmured, so gently it was little more than a breath.
stupid. Fuck, maybe he
“Hey,” John says. “Hey. It’s okay. I’m here, Sherlock. It’s alright.”
Sherlock pushed the snow off the bench with a gloved hand; it slid and toppled into the untouched ground below, scattering dappled patterns across the sleet.
John stepped into the rink and made a tight half-circle turn to face Sherlock. “Now get over here so I can teach you how to not fall on your ass in front of your crush.”
“Are you on drugs?” he asked, peering into Sherlock’s inexplicable blue-grey eyes. Pupils looked normal. Goddamn. Maybe it was Lestrade who had unknowingly been drugged.
“Oh my god, you totally do.”
John's fingers hesitated on the keyboard, hovered; typed out an excessively needlessly cheesy line before he cringed and backspaced furiously.
“Yes,” he said. “A walk.”
But John was willing to try.
button with a dramatic air of triumph, spoke into the phone, “Ten percent bonus if you can get it here by noon,” and glanced up to smile at him. “Hello, John,” he said. “Happy birthday.”
“Right,” John said, a smile tugging its way along his face. “And guess who I run into on my way out the door?”
But the universe must have been having a
“Mary,” he said slowly, softly―savouring. The word was a catalyst with the cold air; John inhaled sharply, suddenly, the sting of a chill flashing in his lungs.
“One last thing,” Sherlock said. His Adam’s apple bobbed. “I have a Christmas present.”
“Nothing’s wrong,” John said. (HE’S IN LOVE WITH YOU MYCROFT SAID.) “Lovely weather outside, 'innit?”
John cackled. He ruffled Sherlock’s hair. “Sorry, sweetheart.”
“He’s in love with you,” Mycroft said. “I expect that photo by two o’clock, Doctor Watson. Have a good day.”
When he says,
"It's the high school experience," John argued.
John wiped his hands on his jeans. “Yeah, well, watch more rom-coms with me and that’ll change.”
“Yes,” was Sherlock’s reply.
As they walked, John wondered what he’d just gotten himself into. But he could never back down from a lure like that. It was one of his traits that got him into plenty of trouble, for sure.
“What the—” John’s voice grew fainter, bewildered, as he watched Sherlock twist and turn his body away from the kitten, who was hissing, snakelike as she attempted to claw up Sherlock’s shirt, one paw still outreached and batting at Sherlock’s—nose, it seemed, or chin, or something or the other on his face.
“Fuck you,” John said.
Sherlock tentatively lifted a foot, stepped forward, and stumbled, his skate slanting to the side.
“Oh my god,” Sherlock said, “I’m never telling you anything again.”
John cut off with an
Someone was shaking him.
They had a do-over.
“Even if we told you, you wouldn’t be able to understand,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock huffed against John’s lips but kissed him back, a hand coming up to tangle in John’s hair, the other running long, languid lines down his spine. He felt John shiver before drawing away and smiled, just a little.
Peter Hochins was the suspect behind a whole boatload of foul play, and over the course of the past few days they had run him down to the quick, but he was still nowhere to be found.
“I am
“So you’re married,” he said under his breath, a rumble barely heard above the symphony of street sounds.
He opened his mouth again, something much less PG-13 rising in his throat, but stopped as he felt the icy touch on his back once more.
"They don't tell you that on the menu," Sherlock said offhandedly. "But everyone in the school absolutely does
Mycroft let out a small, floundering noise as Picasso made an attempt to claw her way up his ankles. “Growing soft in your old age?”
Sherlock stopped for a moment to take in a breath.
“You can’t fix frostbite with a third-degree burn,” John told him one evening in their reconciliation.
“Wouldn’t even make the list,” John said.
John pouted. “Come on, Sherlock. Please?”
"Of course you are," John muttered.
On the nightstand lay two pairs of gloves, tangled together. One day, John would take them off and never put them back on again.
“What on Earth—” Mycroft stumbled back. “What
John was glad he was sitting down on the top of the ladder, because his knees would’ve given out otherwise. He tightened his hand on the ring in his hand so that he didn’t accidentally drop it, because right now it had just become the singular most important thing in his life. “No, really?”
“What’s happening?” Anderson said, unable to take it anymore.
“Hello?” John finally approached.
When the paramedics finally arrived, John had melted a ten-feet radius of snow, revealing yellowed grass and thawing tundra, and Sherlock Holmes was warm and breathing in his arms.
“Yeah,” John said, and wondered if Mrs. Hudson still had those drugs from the cartel she ran before her husband died.
“Sherlock?” John asked, murmuring from the corner of his mouth. “Are you okay?”
John sighed again. He wasn't ever going to get a chance.
“I don’t,” Sherlock said weakly.
“As I was saying,” Sherlock said, “I’m almost certain that he’s not interested.” He blew out a deep breath, unsure. “He’s never done or said anything that would make me think otherwise. It’s not like I’ve made my feelings for him quite obvious either. However—” He glanced over at John and stopped. “You look like you’re about to explode.”
“Hey, Lestrade,” Anderson said, pointedly ignoring Sherlock. He’d learned that it was easier to pretend Sherlock wasn’t there instead of trying to make small talk and/or insults that only resulted in scathing replies. “Is there a problem?”
“John?” Sherlock said urgently. “Are you alright?”
Sherlock said, “Ouch,” even though it didn’t hurt, not really. Not at all. John was looking at the two of them the way Picasso did with a platter of fresh cold cream—that is to say, triumphant, pleased, and utterly satisfied.
Miraculously, she settled down. Her claws dug into Sherlock’s shoulder one last time before retracting, burrowing her head instead into his chest.
John was too busy picking his jaw from the floor to process the rest of the conversation. When he came to his senses, Sherlock had paid for the drinks and had taken him by the shoulders and was steering him to the side.
Oh, fuck. “Mycroft said,” John said.
The gloves were on the floor. John picked them up.
"Hi there, Sherlock," Irene cooed. "Nice seeing you."
“Hi—” John started, and then fell into a stunned silence.
“Come in!” Anderson called out, trying to sound casual.
possible timing, because at any other time he’d be fine with it, or as fine with having a fucking crush on fucking Sherlock Holmes could be, because Sherlock Holmes was Sherlock Holmes and he could live on with the comforting fact that it was just a stagnant, unattainable crush
When he handed it to Sherlock, he was smiling, and the flush that rose on his cheeks when the smile was returned had nothing to do with the heat in his hands.
Right as he managed to shut down the window, there came a knock on the door.
"Victor, Ben, and Tom are male," Irene pointed out.
Keeping a hand like a vise around Sherlock’s arm, Lestrade dug the other hand in his pocket for his keys. “I swear to fucking god, Sherlock, if you’re using again, I will tell John and he will end you.”
“What?” Sherlock whispered.
John stared at it. “Fuck,” he said eloquently.
Sebastian smiled. “Just like that? Not even a hello?”
The Fuck.
doesn't."
Abruptly, his mouth snapped shut.
A tiny little crease appeared on the bridge of Sherlock’s nose. “I know that.”
“Where?”
John absentmindedly ran his fingers through Sherlock’s curls. Sherlock rumbled happily. Seriously, it was like he was a cat.
“I see,” John said, already rattling off names of people in his hockey team last season in his head. “Well, now that we’re on the topic, it wouldn’t hurt to tell me more.” He wiggled his eyebrows in a way he knew Sherlock found ridiculous (but it made Sherlock laugh).
Sherlock hummed, and then used his other hand to smooth back John’s hair, scanning his face with concern. He probably caught on that John wasn’t
“I’m sorry,” he said after what felt like an eon. Sherlock didn’t respond, but he allowed John to approach him and help him in his experiment without a scathing comment, and John had learned the language of the consulting detective long enough to take that as the forgiveness that it was.
Declined again. He didn’t even take it out of his pocket this time.
Sherlock blinked. "Who?"
“What are you doing?” John said. “Why are you calling me? Did he reject you? I’ll kill him, I swear.”
“A rhetorical question merits no response at all,” Sherlock pointed out.
A presence. A wavering of movement, a flicker of motion. Something neared.
John narrowed his eyes for a moment, scrutinizing, until he deemed the situation had passed. “Huh. Well, now that that’s done with,” he said, picking up his cup and looking at the mountain of whipped cream with satisfaction. “It’s time for you to lose your hot chocolate virginity.”
He barely registered hitting the ice, the dull impact landslided by the churning chaos that had exploded in his head.
“Eggs,” he murmured derisively. “Eggs and
John’s eyes were fixed on the collar of Sherlock’s coat. He forced them to rise.
John stood up from his chair and walked around the table. “I want to say one thing. Just for me.” He waited until Sherlock’s eyes were on him, and made sure he was letting all of it shine through his gaze: every churning emotion he was feeling, the good, the bad, and the ugly. “Maybe you need some more time to reconcile with the truth, but I don’t believe for a second a single word that bastard said. Sherlock, you are the most extraordinary man I have ever met. You are brilliant. And I would never want you to be anything other than who you are now.”
It was almost freeing to admit it. That he
“Gotta say, Sherlock, I really wasn’t expecting this. What a pleasure to see you again.”
Sherlock would be testing the coagulation of pig’s blood in the kitchen-island-turned-makeshift-lab, pipetting fluid into a Petri dish, when she would suddenly appear from the doorway and ram into Sherlock’s leg, causing him to spill blood all over the table. Upon Sherlock’s irritated mumbling, she would then latch her claws onto Sherlock’s trousers and refuse to let go, climbing—climbing!—and refusing to stop until Sherlock bent over to forcibly detach her with a flurry of hisses.
“John,” Sherlock said, then, “JOHN.”
It disappeared, backing off at exponential speed, leaving only a faint tingle that was quickly smoothed away by the cold December air.
Sherlock slowed his pace slightly. He turned his face towards John.
-+-+-+-
“Yeah, well. You were the one who walked right into me and made me drop them all. Now shut up and sweep.” A broom and a pan was thrust towards him, no-nonsense. Sherlock glared at it, then crossed his arms.
“Without gravity, I’d still fall for you.”
The door clicked shut behind him. Anderson furrowed his brow for a second, and then pulled out his phone.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” he asked.
“You can’t be serious,” John said to Sherlock as he watched him thumb through his contacts, in a last-ditch attempt at hijacking. “You’re actually going to do it?”
John grinned. “Sure.”
Sherlock stopped abusing their silverware and looked up to John, raising an eyebrow. “Are you volunteering?”
“What made you like him?” John blurted.
Inexplicably, Sherlock smiled. “Maybe one more try,” he offered.
Sherlock gawped. “I was being
twined impossibly into his heart.
“I’ll answer the question,” Sherlock said before John could talk. “Yes, I do.”
Sherlock.
“Hello, John,” said a horrifyingly-familiar voice.
Sherlock said nothing.
A few seconds passed, with nothing to indicate that the other had hung up.
The walk up the stairs, down the hall, and into the bedroom was silent. John didn’t let go of Sherlock’s hand once.
“That’s
Irene said, in that disappointed-mother voice of hers.

Irene whistled. Sherlock snorted.
on someone else, and that made it so much worse, because it meant that there was someone else who had caught Sherlock’s eye and turned him on his heel, and the thought sent a cascade of twists and tugs down his torso, stupidly, irrationally
“But—”
“A kitten so young might not have control over its bladder functions just yet,” Sherlock said. “If you’d particularly enjoy waking up to her wetting our bed, be my guest.”
John said, “What’s the occasion?”
His father screamed. His mother turned, saw John’s pale, chubby hand in the midst of the candle, and shrieked, lunging for John and yanking him back.
“You don’t even
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “I don’t recall it being me who turned the stopcock completely open.”
The skating rink was crowded with couples, enough that skating backwards holding hands would be a death wish, but even side by side Sherlock managed to distract John enough for him to fall. His hand had narrowly missed someone’s skate blades.
“What?”
“Sherlock,” he muttered like a four-letter word, and threw aside his blankets to clomp down the stairs.
John said. “Is he going to die, Molly? Do you think he’s made some sort of death pact?”
“Why now, then? Why after so long? Over a year, you said? Sherlock, why did you never tell me?” John hissed, ugly twisted green threads woven into his words. “I thought I was your friend. What, you didn’t trust me to keep it a secret?”
Sherlock was improving quickly, already getting better; the sweeps of his skates steady, smooth, and sure.
“It was the only option I could see.”
John quickly drained the cup of tea, because while it may have needed a little more milk it was still damn good tea, and then he reached over and snatched the legal pad out of Sherlock’s hands.
Sherlock gave John a look that said
John tried to ignore the fact that the space between where the two of them were sitting on the couch was decidedly not large enough for him to ignore. He felt like he was going to vibrate straight out of the blanket he had pulled up to his shoulders.
Silently, a hand reached up and placed itself over John’s, redirecting the beaker to the right angle. A few seconds later, the burette was adequately filled to the fifty-millilitre marking, and the hand retreated.
“Get to the point,” John snapped.
“Extra security, more like,” John said quietly, mostly to Sherlock, as Mycroft brandished his umbrella at Picasso, who hissed and clawed a strip down its waterproof fabric. She had never been this blatantly furious, eyes narrowed and nearly spitting with contempt.
Evergreen branches reached out to them, swaying in the breeze. The dim glow of faraway streetlamps struggled to cast their light.
we have a movie for tomorrow.”
Molly said, very faintly, “What?”
He pressed send, quietly huffed out a laugh, and then put his phone back into his pocket. He paused, thinking, for another moment, then shrugged to himself and swivelled his chair back to facing the window, where he watched a man try to feed a duck what looked like a burrito from the park bench across the road.
“Right, time to leave,” Lestrade said. “So sorry about this, Molly!” he shouted, his voice echoing in the corridor.
Face turned away from Sherlock as he made his way to the back of the room where the chemicals were located, John took a deep breath and dragged a hand over his face. Jesus, he needed to get a hold of himself. He hadn’t thought it had gotten
Sherlock was standing, yet again, at the kitchen. Yet again at the sink. This time, he was carrying a mug.
“OK, here’s the plan,” John said. “Imagine this. He’s received his gift and now you’re going out for hot chocolate with him.” He patted down his chest and with a grin. “Exhibit A, your fake secret santa.”
John peered up at Sherlock and grinned slowly. “How would you know?”
Sherlock glanced at him, and then pointed at a pair of lab goggles that John just noticed were lying on the counter. “You forgot your lab goggles,” he said.
“No, wait—” Sherlock made a low, frustrated noise in his throat that turned into a sharp inhale as they passed over a nick in the ice. They had passed the halfway point of the oblong, now; John lengthened the strokes of his left skate and eased the two of them into a slow, lazy turn.
Not hallucinating, then. Lestrade made a hysterical, guttural sound, tamping down an uncontrollable urge to hurl. Those words and Sherlock Holmes should never be paired together. Add a wink and it was the cherry on top. The universe was collapsing. The planes of reality were folding, ripping at the seams.
Sherlock sighed. That was enough of a response.
She hankered back down close to the floor again, this time with her gaze directed towards one of Sherlock’s trouser legs and bare slippered feet.
John began to do so, adamant to do it perfectly in order to prove to Sherlock that he wasn’t entirely useless—and hit his first roadblock halfway through.
John was suddenly very dizzy. He sat down on the topmost rung and stared at Sherlock.
Sherlock Holmes shook John’s hand and only gave a single glance to his gloves before his gaze slid crisply up to his eyes, flicking to his cheek, his ears, his eyebrows—like a machine analysis, or a CT scan.
Irene whooped when she saw the two of them holding hands.
read the small paper slip, and on the bottom,
“It’s Earl Grey,” Sherlock said, like that explained everything.
"Hey, Sherlock," John said, a little out of breath from his mad dash out the library when he looked up and saw Sherlock's familiar knapsack and long coat billowing out the door, violin case gripped tightly in one hand. "How was rehearsal?"
“Eggnog Day!”
“I don’t know,” Molly said. Her eyes were wide, now, turned to Sherlock in a whole new light as he took a scalpel and violently shoved it through Smith’s chest cavity. “You should really talk to him about this, John. It might be serious.”
John continued. “Whatever I can say to you, I know you’ve thought of already. I want to show you instead.”
Sherlock threw his arms up in the air. "Just ask me already, John!"
John shook his head. “Okay, yeah, fine. I'm an idiot. A big, bumbling idiot.”
“I’m going to hang up now,” Sherlock said. “Emma got the footage she wanted. She’s leaving now.”
John caught up, grabbed his shoulder—felt Sherlock tense under his touch. He let go.
Desperate times called for desperate measures.
“Woah,” he said, fingers wrapping around Sherlock’s wrist, “easy there. You’re lifting your foot up too high. It’s not like walking. Try again.”
She kissed him again, gently, and John hesitated for a minute before he raised his trembling hands and peeled them off his fingers, inch by inch exposing skin that was eggshell-pale, having not seen the sun in years.
John turned and was fully facing him before he could stop himself. He nodded wordlessly, determined not to shove his foot into his mouth again.
John wailed in protest and tossed his head back and forth, shaking a fist in the air. His parents stared at his hand, now draped in red-orange-yellow, shifting with every movement, like someone took a bucket of flames and poured it down his arm. His skin, beneath, was unharmed.
“Oh, dear,” Mycroft said. “The poor boy.”
“Huh,” he said. He took another sip. “Not bad,” he said out loud, and licked his lips. “Could maybe use a little more milk.”
-+-+-+-
John’s eyes shifted behind him to a dark nightscape. Snow fell in sparkling refractions against the washed-out light of the porch lamp.
-+-+-+-
It would have to be him, then, and John crossed his fingers and sent a silent prayer up to the heavens above that Emma would not prod and poke about the identity, because his answer was going to be
John paused, and then let out a rough snarl before dropping his arms. Sherlock’s hand fell from his back, and John tried reaching for him again, only to be met with a subtle dodge and lowered eyes that wouldn’t meet his gaze. John gritted his teeth so hard his jaw ached. He forced himself to look back at the third man in the room.
“Says the one testing the temperature of milk on his wrist,” John said, raising an eyebrow and grinning before devoting his focus back to the kitten. “I think she’s getting sleepy.”
John ran a hand down Sherlock’s side, then back up again. “Always.”
“She,” Sherlock said, “has been abandoned by her mother. Most likely the weakest of the litter, a runt.
“I should’ve been better,” he tells John sometimes, in those rare moments where he isn’t fast enough, isn’t clever enough, voice heavy like penance and dark as death. “Should’ve figured it out sooner. People are dead because of me.” In these moments, his eyes look haunted, carrying the weight of a thousand souls saved, and a dozen dead.
John's mouth opened; closed again.
“And how’d you figure that?”
“What does this have to do with anything?”
Sherlock’s eyes were closed. He inhaled deeply through his nose, expelled through his lips. “I need to know where Hochins is,” he said through gritted teeth.
“I really don’t think now is the best time to play armchair psychologist,” Sherlock snapped, distracting by the way the kitten was currently fixated upon a piece of his hair that had unfortunately fallen out of place by her antics. She flattened down in Sherlock’s arms, wiggling her backside, whiskers trembling and ready to pounce—and
Scotland Yard was going to go positively
"They were serious?"
“This is the local cafe two minutes from our school.”
there's a dance on Friday, you've been telling me that all bloody week," Sherlock said impatiently.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and John’s look turned to one of warning as their footsteps stalled in front of the cafe entrance.
“Told you,” he said, minutes later, with that smug look that more than often found its way on his face one way or another about a dozen times a day. Lestrade looked up at the ceiling in an imploring, despairing air, grabbed Sherlock’s arm, and marched them out the doors. Molly wondered if she had accidentally taken something with her coffee this morning.
“Hey,” John said, and dropped the bottles unceremoniously on the counter.
“Don’t do that,” Sherlock murmured, eyebrows quirking up, and kissed him again. John tried (really) to reciprocate this time, but somewhere after the 0.5 second mark his mind had helpfully turned into the mental equivalent of
Sherlock, not so much.
that and he wasn’t going to break it, and he hadn’t, not even when the fire alarm went off three consecutive days leading up to
“Calm down, John.” Sherlock pursed his lips. “I was just being nice. That’s what you wanted, wasn’t it?”
He pulled away because he was going to fall over from the momentum and the tippy-toes combined. He looked at Sherlock, who—woah. Whose eyes had gone insanely huge, like dinner plates.
“I am aware,” Sherlock said.
There was a lull in the conversation, then, as they fell back into a silence.
Friday meant practise days, which meant that 1. John had to walk home sweaty, exhausted, and covered in grass stains, and 2. John had to walk home without Sherlock.
“What kind of project?” Sherlock interjected before John could respond.
"Molly, Victor, Ben, Sally, Tom," Sherlock listed off rapidly. "And now you."
He heard John laughing all the way up the stairs.
Sherlock headed towards the end of the hall, and the two of them followed. The very last door was closed. As their footsteps came closer, there suddenly came a scritching noise—and then a long, pitiful wail, full of heartbreak and betrayal.
John saw, and then realized. He pointed a finger at Sherlock. “You’re doing this on purpose!”
“Or what?”
In the corner of John’s vision, he saw Sherlock twitch.
“This is amazing,” John declared. “It’s perfect! You’ll get him a gift and confess your love and then you two can kiss and make out under the mistletoe—”
not doing anything
John stiffened. “What?”
“Yes.”
“Partner.” The word was caressed in Sebastian’s mouth. “Sherlock, don’t tell me you’ve finally moved on.”
Holding his breath, he pinched the screw with his thumb and index, and gently, gently, heart pounding in his ears, twisted it off.
