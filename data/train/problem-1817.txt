John couldn’t believe the way Sherlock was, this sweet, amazing, soft creature, unknown to others, he was sure he was the first to witness the real Sherlock. Most people that had met him described him as cold, detached, and one of Victor’s friends had even said the reason behind their breakup was Sherlock not “putting out” to Victor; thanks to Mike, John didn’t punch the arsehole that called Sherlock “the virgin freak, a frigid bitch”. After a wonderful week, John fell more in love with Sherlock that he thought possible.
“I will, tonight” Sherlock nodded once “I guess we’ll come by tomorrow at seven, he’s just finishing exam week today” He beamed proudly.
Sherlock looked up from the cocoon in the bed and covered his head again, grumbling something unintelligible. He kept thinking about all the wrong things he had done to John and how justified his actions were, but at the same time he had this nagging in the back of his head that reminded him of everything he had done, how much he had opened to John and the fact that, he too, deserved to be loved and respected. He was about to leave the bed and face John when he felt a hand on his shoulder and John was sitting next to him
“Sorry” John whispered
When lunch was over, they bathed Rosie bathed and sat for a couple of hours talking about everything they could talk about, John’s parents promised to visit Rosie at least once a week, help with her over the weekends when they needed it, and to participate more actively in Rosie’s upbringing, going as far as to help them with Mary’s parents and having the baby visit them.
“Mister Watson, little Rosie. A real pleasure to meet you” She smiled at him and John felt as a bug under the microscope, she was reading him like an open book. She nodded at Sherlock and Sherlock made a sign for John to wait.
“Don’t worry, love” John pulled him to his lap and held him close “You just keep on being brilliant and we’ll show him who the freak is” John winked at him and kissed him softly.
“It’s a long way to go”
One thing startled Sherlock, James’ honesty when he talked to his sister; to Sherlock it meant he was truly interested in her; at some point he said they were more alike than anyone could ever imagine. Eurus smiled softly at him and Sherlock decided to let the situation be, he would contact Mycroft later to ask for an entire investigation about him. John eyed him curiously the entire time, he tried to act nonchalant and told himself that Sherlock always did that, but the intensity with which he was looking at Jim awoke the monster of jealousy and by the time Eurus and Jim left he was seething.
“I wonder when I’m going to meet this mysterious brother of yours that whisks you away in black sedans” John chuckled.
Still broken up... Let's see how the Final Problem goes and we'll talk... Still a bit pissed with John, but I might think of forgiving him... Let's wait and see
Tying a scarf around your neck when it's cold, handing you a pair of gloves while in a case, because you forgot yours, once again, for the thrill of the chase.
You must let go of every "need" you've ever had, be satisfied with what you already have, be happy... or... die and be born, be cursed for all eternity, until you just... LET.GO!
“well, you couldn’t really tell. Is that a vibrato or is your hand shaking?” He managed to deceive her, but at the same time he was truly nervous, he couldn’t get rid of the passionate moment and he wanted to stay still, but his body betrayed him for a moment
“Sherlock was the consulting detective that solved…” John waved his hand in the air and let the news sink in.
talking about music and literature, discussing criminal law and the best way to punish and capture said criminals. He starts working with members of the senate and is well known. At eighteen, he's as known as Caesar. The year 55 B.C. becomes the year of Titus, as he goes to Greece to become a philosopher.
“Let’s” John sighed deeply and squeezed Mary’s hand.
So sorry for the delay... Been catching up with my english lit readings. Hope you enjoy this couple of chapters, will resume writting as soon as I finish with Brontë...
John on the other hand, was adamant on teaching her to be well behaved, polite, caring, loving. She would say “pease” and “thanks” whenever she asked for something or received something, she would say “hi” and “bye”, she would be quiet when told so and would listen to her grandparents, the most amorous little girl ever; the only person she would misbehave with will be Sherlock, who would allow her to do whatever she wanted, especially when she would call him “my daddy”
“You did?” John asked, keeping his hope at bay and waiting for the worst.
“What?” John cocked his head and furrowed his brow.
, and he picked another song but Hamish shrieked at the sound and Sherlock huffed an annoyed breath, trying to get all his frustration out of his body
“You do?” He whispered against Sherlock’s chest.
“You’ve been alone for almost a year” Molly sighed “And so has Sherlock”
Marcus is walking to the window, but an ill placed stool makes him trip. Paulla runs to him and helps him up. They share an awkward smile, Marcus delivers the parcel, collects his money and leaves.
“Why do you ask?” Sherlock finally answered and kept on playing “Irene’s” song
Rosie woke up and John handed her to him; he had said “look, there’s Daddy” and John had looked at him fondly, their fingers grazed softly and Sherlock felt electricity travel down his spine, lighting up his entire being… He could see John’s eyes; they had shared a moment… Sherlock knew it…
The seven minutes seemed like seven hours and John couldn’t shake the sensation that all this was wrong. They left the closet, Sarah with a dazed gaze and a smile that made her face look like a clown had thrown up all his jokes on her mouth; John on the other hand, looked annoyed and wanted to leave the party only to avoid the looks they were giving him, the girls went to Sarah and took her away, squealing, the boys whistled and cheered him, he just nodded and pretended to care.
“No cons.” John shook his head and reached for Sherlock’s hand “So?” He looked up to ice blue eyes and felt himself fall in love all over again.
“Just what?” He asked; his annoyance more clear than before.
For a minute there you thought it was really that easy, didn't you?
The confession…
He grabbed little Hamish’s hand and kissed it softly, the baby almost asleep in his arms
Just in case you’re a bit lost, I followed canon for the birthdays and some dates. Sherlock’s birthday is January 6th, John’s July 7th. John is two years older than Sherlock, unlike canon where John is the same age as Mycroft. Molly is in an advance class where she met Mary. Molly is a year younger than Mary and a year older than Eurus. Since Eurus is a genius too, she’s ahead at school and shares classes with Molly. Molly is the same age as Sherlock. Also, John is starting his second year in med school and Sherlock his third year of Chemistry in Oxford. John started university in October right after his 18th birthday before Mary got pregnant and is now in his second year, which started before his wedding.
“This way, please” Sherlock led them to the sofa “May I offer you something to drink? Water? Coffee? Perhaps some tea?”
“Not coming?” John couldn’t hide the disappointment and the confusion, why was Sherlock saying goodbye, today, of all days? Sherlock shook his head and schooled his features to appear calm, but John noticed “Why?” John asked and the answer was interrupted by the cabbie grunting a “well?” That had Sherlock helping John in the cab and closing the door after him and rattling John’s address. John barely had time to look back and see Sherlock climb in the back of a black sedan.
Before going to the flat they went for food, the Italian place was packed -thankfully- so they took their order to go and walked to Sherlock’s flat. The space was a beautiful as John had imagined. A studio flat with everything Sherlock might need; a small kitchen, a fully furnished living room-dining room, and a king size bed; the whole ensemble was completed with a travel cot for Rosie. John couldn’t believe how prepared Sherlock was for their visit.
's Army. Father is proud. Hanno was selected personally by Hasdrubal himself a couple of years prior. Being part of a prominent family helps. Owning a merchant fleet and being rich helps even more. Hanno's family is well known, therefore, Hanno has the right to join Hannibal's Army in the rank of Captain.
“Sherlock’s sister” Molly clarified “She knows about you” She giggled but after a huff from John contained herself.
For an entire week, he watched Sherlock interact with the women of his family; he knew Sherlock had an older brother that had returned to London three weeks ago with their father, work related issues. John took his time to really observe Sherlock; he would “hide” behind the large curtains and observe him with his sister, his mother and his grandmother; he even was the silent witness of Sherlock interacting with little Rosie when nobody else was looking; he saw him take her to the greenhouse, chat with her about flowers, bees, in French, and Rosie watched him with rapt attention.
“Yes…” Sherlock bit his lower lip and tried to look at John but couldn’t and looked shyly to the side.
Once in Paris, Mamie sent them on a tour, they’d take care of Rosie so John would have a chance to properly visit Paris. The Eiffel tower, the Louvre, the Seine and many other places; had John fascinated, but as fascinated as he was watching Sherlock move around like he owned the city, taking shortcuts here and there, going to places where no one else could go; Sherlock speaking in French was another thing, each word made John’s spine tingle…
“You don’t seem very frightening” John shrugged and locked gazes with Mycroft.
They had also been exploring their relationship, talking about the future, about Rosie, about where their relationship is going. They talked about Sherlock finishing his doctorate and where to send Rosie for day care, her schooling and schedules. They also talked about John’s career, his work, and most importantly, his military career. This still was a sore subject and it usually went undiscussed, but since Mycroft proposed to Alicia, they’d been talking about marriage.
“I cleared it a bit” Sherlock chuckled.
"Always a soldier." Sherlock reflects a bit sadly.
“He was the kid with the police, the one rattling information” Henry’s brow was furrowed as he recalled the day Mary died, almost six months ago.
“One last kiss and I have to go…” John tried to pry his body from the octopus-like embrace he was being held by
He felt exhausted, sated, exceptionally so, but he didn’t want to move, he wanted to keep the connection for a few more precious seconds while they both recovered their breaths and their heart rates went back to normal. Foreheads touching; lips ghosting over lips; sated smiles and that dull ache of their muscles after a great exertion; John’s hands running over Sherlock’s body as Sherlock’s hands roamed over his back and neck. John slipped out, making Sherlock wince, but one smile and John relaxed, knowing Sherlock was fine.
They shared breakfast in companionable silence, the only noises coming from Rosie’s babbling and the occasional word interspersed between babbling bouts. They would smile at her, coo her, but they didn’t talk, it was extremely pleasurable sitting next to each other, enjoying the company. At some point the comfortable silence turned into a reflexive one; Sherlock had agreed to meet John’s family and he was starting to feel nervous; he wanted to be liked by them, but at the same time, after all John had told him about them, he was sure it wasn’t about them liking him, but him liking them.
Sherlock smiled nervously at John and nodded. John opened the door to his family and after a few seconds of awkward shyness, he steeled himself and walked down to greet them.
And I returned, I was so... scared. But I love him so... but it was too late...
“We have time” She smiled fondly at her grandson and took his hand, slightly pulling him before leading the way back to the house.
When Sherlock relaxed and let out a long breath, John pushed deeper and soon was fully sheathed inside Sherlock’s body, the warmth wrapping him like a blanket. Sherlock adjusted and tilted his pelvis, and John took the hint and started to move, soon creating a rhythm of their own; slow, soft, tender, caring, loving, soft breaths and touches, slow thrusts and whispers of kisses wherever they could reach, words of love shared with a melting sweetness.
Many memories. Nineteen something? Hopefully yes...
Early next morning she went back to John before her parents called John’s. “We have to tell them before they do” She said with a slight sense of urgency.
, my action was considered as commendable, at least that's what I read a few years later, when I was five, yet again...
The way the lovers find themselves breathless with longing and desire, and somehow find heaven in their release, must be part of fantasies created by writers that long for a memorable night of pure and undiluted lust and love. They have to be, because right now, Sherlock feels as if he’s escaped from a romantic, salacious and lascivious novel, because his first time with John -amazing, beautiful, wonderful… not enough adjectives to describe him- Watson, belong in a romantic novel, to be guarded, saved for posterity in the history of humankind, as the most wonderful, most amazing, most incredible, simply the most… -not enough adjectives to describe it- first time in history, written or otherwise.
I feel it, once again, my chest aching, left shoulder, always the left shoulder. Which time is it this one? The tenth? The twelfth? But something is different now, he's still alive!
“So?” Molly said as soon as she saw him open the door.
“Piss off, Mycroft” Sherlock gritted his teeth.
He opened his eyes and Eurus was staring at him. How long had he been standing there with the violin under his chin? It felt like a lifetime, had she responded to his question?
“Ready for bed?” John whispered against Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock nodded “Come love” He pulled him close by the waist and led him to their bedroom. John undressed Sherlock slowly; feather touches over his chest and back. Sherlock kissed his neck and opened John’s shirt with expert fingers. They pulled trousers and pants off and helped each other to bed. John opened his arms and Sherlock rested his head on John’s chest, hearing his heart beat
Silas is a married man, and tonight, he will fulfil his duty as a husband, God willing, he'll impregnate his wife and he'll keep on being exemplary; but he knows he will do it out of duty, because he only loves the man from the brothel. He came to the realisation this afternoon, when he saw Maria and felt... nothing...
“Interest in my younger brother” Mycroft sniffed.
“And you say you belong to me, and ease my mind”
“Afraid I didn’t notice in the heat of the moment and afterwards…” The heat of the moment, he knew all about the heat of the moment
“Very loyal” Mycroft sighed and John glared at him, Mycroft cowered slightly.
Sherlock’s eyes widened at the mention of Molly “She’s been helping you?” He asked; the information new to him.
Greg, Molly, Mike, Bill and Eurus were there to help them. During the week in France, Eurus and John had developed a sort of relationship that had Sherlock quite comfortable with sharing John with his sister. Eurus was interesting, to say the least and John could see so much of Sherlock in her that he enjoyed her witty comments. She had a strange sweetness to her and John loved the way she acted around Rosie.
"Yeah?"
The care…
… His name in John’s voice filled with need and lust was all Sherlock needed to come like he had never done in his life, a second later he could feel John's warmth fill him from the inside... he closed his eyes and let his bliss-filled brain turn off for a moment. When he opened them again, John was smiling down at him, one kiss to his forehead and Rosie’s giggles invading the room…
“How long do you plan to continue your association with my brother?”
The kiss didn’t let him sleep that night, he felt wrong, not because he had hated Sarah’s hands, or lips, or her taste, but because he had seen James right before he entered the closet and all he could think about while holding still for Sarah’s lips was him. The thought startled him at first, thinking about a boy while kissing a girl, was it normal? Was it right? Was he a good Watson? Harry had a girlfriend by now, a fellow university student called Clara; the eight years difference even more noticeable now with Harry about to become a lawyer and engaged to be married with “beautiful, sweet Clara”, which made him “the perfect Watson”. Oh how John wanted to be the perfect Watson…
John beamed at the news but held it as much as he could “So you solved the case” It wasn’t a question
“But I do have to work” John countered, even though all he wanted was take the first plane to France and be with Sherlock.
Mycroft: Bumble, short for Bumblebee
...Pride
And then… then… then John knew he couldn’t not board that train, that he'd have to stay and meet this mythical creature, because the beauty was standing in front of him, mercurial eyes, Gray? Blue? Green? were looking at him, dissecting him, reading him like an open book… Those eyes then focused on his hair, then followed a path down his neck… he took a deep breath and his own eyes travelled down to those lips, plump, red, a perfect’s cupid bow… his breath hitched when a red tongue travelled across them and disappeared back behind the sweet plumpness…
He found more information; the boy, actually man, had just turned eighteen, he was a third year Oxford student, getting degrees in chemistry, dance and music. He was at the top of his classes since school; violinist; theatre aficionado, praised for his role as Hamlet in a school production; dancer -John loved those photos of him in tights- and apparently on his way of becoming the youngest detective praised by the Yard, a couple commendations… GOD… John closed his eyes and all he could see were those eyes, those cupid bow lips, those long fingers… He came back to reality when Rosie squirmed, having finished her bottle.
"I thought you might like it..." I chuckle, but he frowns, "being the only Consulting Detective and all..." I try as a joke, but I can see the despair in his eyes. "Sorry, love..." I mutter, mortified. He reaches for my hand, pulling me to sit on his lap.
“I wanted to see you too” John smiled “What did you do all day?” He tried small talk to calm his nerves.
“Starving” John answered and grinned widely.
What year is it? I open my eyes and find myself in hospital. It smells clean enough to assume a couple decades have passed since I last died, or well, since I last was born.
By 4 pm he was standing outside the coffee shop, Rosie in his arms and his eyes looking for his friend.
“Yes, Mum” John cocked his head “The three of us” John crossed his arms in front of his chest.
“And Alicia?” Sherlock asked with a certain amount of curiosity and interest.
Marcus arrives to Salernum four days after father's death. Uncle Claudius hands him a bucket and asks him to feed the pigs. That night, extremely exhausted, he goes to bed before cena is served.
Mary?
and spikes it with some hemlock, that effectively takes away the sadness. The last thing he sees is the man from the beach running away from him.
and claimed him. After he was done, he kept saying he was beautiful, hence the name. "Callistus" has many clients a day, young, robust men, old, feeble men, smelly, fat, thin, fair, ugly, sweaty, sweet, aggressive, he serves them all, he must. At seventeen, he's still the most wanted boy in the brothel, even though he's been "serving" since he was twelve. "Callistus" has "especial" clients. They bring him fruit, scented oils, clothing; he gracefully accepts every gift and acts as lovers should, making scenes, acting lovingly, jealously, as a soft submissive, as a child. He's learned how to scream, how to moan, how to deceive. After Phares left his room that first night, he cried to sleep, the next morning he felt cold to the core, after that day, he was unable to feel.
“Look, Mum” John rubbed the back of his neck “I’m not hiding him from you” He shifted on his feet “It’s just too… new…” He shook his head and closed his eyes, looking for the words to avoid offending his mother “I still remember what happened when you met James” John licked his lips, he suddenly felt very thirsty “Dad yelled, you cried, Harry almost punched him and both Dad and Harry threatened to beat the gay out of me” John rubbed his face.
A few days later, Anderson was invited to work with the Police at the Yard, to his surprise; Sherlock was invited to work on the case too and he thought he might have an opportunity to show off, and while at it, to show the “little frigid bitch” who was boss. Suffice to say, his plan backfired and John got what he wanted, he punched the lights out of Anderson.
John watches her fondly; and closely, she's begun to walk and is now a danger to herself, so we must keep a close eye on her.
“I love you” John whispered and pulled Sherlock close to his chest, kissing the mop of dark, slightly auburn, yet raven-like curls, Sherlock looked up and ice blue met dark blue “I love you” Sherlock breathed out, slowly, savouring the words. They kissed and allowed their bodies to move and do what they now knew they could do; this time it was rushed, frantic, two bodies coming apart together, sliding over one another and falling to the void with muffled cries of their names.
“Italian. There’s new place over Northumberland Street” He smirked and John looked at him suspiciously.
“And how do you plan doing that?” Mr. Morstan sat, defeated, not willing to look at his daughter “A teenager in charge of a child, just started medical school and no job to show” He put his head in his hands “Are you even willing to marry her?” He asked and looked up at John. The always strong man looked devastated.
At first Mycroft had thought his brother suffered from some sort of OCD, but seeing his messy bedroom, the way he conducted some of his experiments, how messy he was with his school notes and how he could care less about many other things, he dismissed the idea and looked for other potential ailments. When Sherlock started dating Victor, he thought his brother suffered from a form of Asperger’s, but he soon dismissed the idea too, since he remembered how affectionate Sherlock had been as a child with his sister, with Victor and of course with his dog.
But then the text, what the hell does “out of town” means, why does he have to leave. He finished his session, the woman leaving before him when he caught a glimpse of Sherlock in a cab and ran to the car -thank god for red lights- he climbed in it and demanded an explanation, but Sherlock simply left him, unable to utter a single word… Sherlock knew about “E” and then that other women had flirted with him before he pursued his one and only Sherlock Holmes, but now he wasn’t flirting, nor cheating, he was getting help…
-A full body shudder and a look of disgust, Victor had made him feel the heat, but not in the way John had-
Eurus was glad that his brother had met someone new and when Mummy had told her all about Rosie and how Sherlock had taken care of her; Eurus knew that his brother was more head over heels than he led on.
Don't break the rules, don't jump ahead, all shall be told in time.
“They said they’ll be in contact soon” John said, closing his eyes, he couldn’t bear lying to his parents this way. Mary squeezed his hand and he looked at her, both were lost, they only had each other and this lie.
“Begging twice, huh?”
… He still found it hard remembering when and how John undressed; all he remembered was being under John’s naked body, the weight of him, his masculine scent filling his nose, his moans and huff, along with his pants filling his brain with bliss…
“Thank you” John wanted to hug him, kiss him, do something but he was frozen in space and all he could do was look at him. Sherlock nodded and smiled lopsidedly.
Love...
“The truth” Sherlock shrugged.
and the incredibly amazing
“What would your family say?” John copied Sherlock’s posture and stared.
“He’s on the run and your daddy’s here”
“The light of love” Sherlock chuckled and John kissed him deeply as his fingers found the place they were looking for and Sherlock sighed
“Come in, it’s cold out here. Tea?” She rushed through the door to her flat looking back at them all the time.
“Of course it was. It was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary” John praised.
“I guess my mum’s been teaching her more words than we imagined” He smiled at the little baby and brought her close to the rose.
Sherlock couldn’t look away from the man standing right in front of him, less than a metre away. A short, sturdy, strong teenager, eyes as blue as a summer sky, with little flecks of gold that made those eyes shine under the light. Thin lipped and a tongue that made Sherlock’s stomach twist with desire and his heart beat like a wild bird trying to escape its prison. Broad shoulders, tanned skin, strong hands holding a baby that didn’t look like him at all. Sherlock’s mind filled with information.
Sherlock is… Sherlock… He’s brilliant, clever, he can read a person within five seconds after glancing over them once… He’s not perfect, he’s not emotionally intelligent, but he’s lovely… when he wants… he’s caring… when he wants… he’s… Sherlock… and Victor, oh Victor, he says he loves him just the way he is. They’ve been together for the past six months, they haven’t told each other they love each other, but they both suppose they do. Love at seventeen isn’t exactly undying; maybe not even eternal, probably a bit… silly… puppy love they call it and Sherlock knows it, but it is love in the end.
“Kate asked me to invite you the rave, but I see that’ll be impossible” She looked at John wickedly “Guess I’ll have to please the girlfriend someway else” She licked her lips and blew a kiss to Sherlock “Cute Doctor” She mouthed to Sherlock and he rolled his eyes, wanting nothing but to throw her out of his flat.
Making love.
“I can’t take you off my mind” Sherlock said to the void and rested his head on his hands. He messed up his hair, tousling it, pulling it, wanting to disappear. It wasn’t the first time he felt this way and he knew it wouldn’t be the last. He had been so close to John the entire afternoon, fixing the living room, painting the smiley face, shooting at it…
John’s hand fumbled with the button and zipper of Sherlock’s trousers and Sherlock found a way to open a few of the bottom buttons of John’s shirt. Sherlock kissed John’s neck and managed to open John’s trousers before his hand snaked down and grabbed John’s engorged cock.
“I can’t” Sherlock tried to articulate… something… the words jumbling in his mind. He took a deep breath and tried again “I can’t keep doing this back and forth… I need to know…” His breath hitched when he felt John’s hand reach for his
As for Sherlock, he enjoyed the moments he spent with John. He was certain he was in love with the young man, all he dreamt was about the day he could hold him close, kiss him; be by his side. He realised, after the fourth night; that he loved Rosie too, his happiness when Rosie recognised him was beyond anything he could explain and he couldn’t wait to hold her too.
“So?” John held his breath “I take it you didn’t finish delivering the news”
I sit comfortably on my chair, we're done with the repairs and my John has moved back with me. We're still settling at home, at Baker Street, and now we're talking more than ever, I have decided to tell him all about my memories. It's time, and I know he'll understand. I'm sure he will.
“Mister Watson” Irene greeted, with her honeyed voice “So nice to meet the man that has my Sherlock captured” She smirked and Sherlock wanted to kill her
“Thanks” John said to Angelo’s back. “Okay” John said as soon as they ordered “Something to tell me?” He smiled in just that reassuring way Sherlock loves so much.
John eyed him suspiciously but answered anyway “Mary asked me to keep her” John shrugged “A week before the weeding we talked about what to do in case one of us could no longer be in Rosie’s life; I am her legal father, but in case her real father appeared there might be some… issues; so Mary decided to leave Rosie to me, as her legal guardian; we signed adoption papers the second she was born, just in case, we wanted to cover all the bases”
“Finished the case?” John smiled.
Rosie turned to look at John and pointed to a rose before screaming “Nana!”
“Mister Holmes?” John called and reached over to pat his arm.
“That’s the reason why he doesn’t want anything with me” John muttered.
The dancer was so concentrated, it seemed as he only heard the music and nothing else, his dark curls bounced around his face… cheekbones that could cut you if you dared look too close, a long neck that lead to a pale, marblelike chest, sculpted right from the stone… John’s cock was willing to forego the sexual identity crisis John’s brain was about to have and simply jump, hump and fuck that sweet, pert arse senseless…
In October 19th 202 B.C. Kanmi wakes up early, a sudden sadness invades him. He pours himself some
“Don’t have anyone to help me with Rosie” He said in way of greeting as soon as Greg picked up the phone, Greg sighed deeply and John see him rubbing his hand over his face.
“Will you still love me tomorrow?” John grinned and Sherlock smiled
“I know” Sherlock scowled “I…” He blushed but remembered what Eurus said “I wanted to see you” He looked away, biting his lip, unable to face John.
“Hi, Mum” he squeezed her tight before releasing her and greeting his father “Dad” he shook his hand “This way” he led them to their door where an anxious Sherlock was holding Rosie and waiting for them “Mum, Dad” John cleared his throat “This is Sherlock” He pointed politely at him “Sherlock, these are my Mum and Dad” he tried and failed to smile.
"Should we tell them as such?"
“I don’t need distractions” Sherlock blushed the cutest shade of pink and John couldn’t help but feel swooned “I have you” He muttered lowly but John heard him.
The first ever thought, "It burns," is attributed to my soulmate, The "scientist" he is.., always touching, tasting, smelling, everything... Then, he said it. Grunted? Oh! How much language has evolved, to the point I'm writing to you in English, of over 6.909 different languages. I've been translated to many since the first attempt I made to tell our story.
Heard of Oedipus? Well... writers tell it quite like it was, except... except he was in love with his father... unfortunately? Us souls are meant to be together, even if we're son and father, even if belief systems, or matters of religious faith, condemn us to "eternal fires and rage," The Borgias ring a bell? It wasn't exactly his sister...
Sloppy kisses, hungrier hands, deeper thrusts faster thrusts, harder thrusts and it was all over before either one of them wanted this passionate moment to be over
“No idea how?” Sherlock stood and started pacing like a caged lion, huffing and shaking his head, trying to understand when all went so wrong “We’re supposed to be partners” He said to the room “Are you ever going to trust me?” He asked, his voice betraying the emotion, utter sadness and anger.
“School, friends, everything, haven’t seen you in a long while” Henry sighed sadly.
“You’re very loyal, very quickly” Mycroft tried to hide his amusement.
“Six” Sherlock shrugged “Wanted to go to the library but it was too full, too many distractions”
At the table, she kept amusing her grandparents by being part of the conversation, babbling and trying to put more food in her mouth than in Sherlock’s hair, shirt, trousers, nose… well… Sherlock patiently fed her, smiling broadly at the little girl and enjoying her gushing about everything and nothing. Julia looked at them amazed at the way Rosie acted with Sherlock, if she liked him… kids usually are good at judging people and the way they are.
“Yeah. That sort of calmed her down. But she wants to meet you” John made a distressed face.
I've been writen in a story, where we are ever friends and never lovers. But I'm jumping ahead.
John blinks awake and I can see the panic in his eyes. He reaches for me and I rapidly hold my hand up to him, he takes it and pulls me close, feeling my pulse. His heart is hammering, he can barely breathe.
Finally, Sherlock was able to reconnect his brain to his mouth and clear his throat “She’s barely seven months old” He said, baffled “Early talker” He looked at the little miracle in his arms once more.
I pull him closer, kissing him softly, he smiles leaning down and deepening the kiss. I respond, feeling the urge to be with him, every way I can, anytime I can. "I thought you said sleep," my voice is low and husky, he just kisses me again and lowers his hands to my back.
Suddenly, I jerk awake and breathe, needing the air more than anything. I know what to do know, I know where to go. John is guiding me. I can still feel his hand in mine, but it wasn't my John, although it was.. I have to come back.
"Feels like centuries have passed," he tries to smirk but I see the weariness in his eyes. Pulling him close, I run my fingers on his hair and he shivers, he's still sensitive from our afternoon tryst. I yawn and he looks down at me, with his smile that's just for me.
“A flat over Baker Street”
“Been busy. Mind everywhere” John shook his head as he found himself visualising Sherlock once more.
“There’s another bedroom upstairs” Mrs. Hudson explained “If you’ll be needing two bedrooms” She said almost as an afterthought, considering how young Rosie is and that they might want to have the baby close to them in their own room.
“I’m sorry” John whispered and rubbed Sherlock’s shoulder. The touch, even under the duvet felt like fire and Sherlock jumped away, he needed time to process, to think, he needed to yell, he needed to do something other than to keep wallowing and drowning in self-pity. He still wanted John, but at the same time he needed to know if John wanted him… truly wanted him…
“So…”
“You already are” John smiled “Mum’s pissed, but she’ll come around” John tried to reassure Sherlock “Told her about you, though”
The new addiction -John Watson and Rosie Watson- had Mycroft in full alert, fully knowing that his brother could easily turn to drugs if this new experiment of his -having a real, adult relationship with a man that had a daughter, which wasn’t actually his,
“Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful boy”
Okay... So... I just got a new job (FINALLY!!!!) but it means now I have no time to post, much less to write. I'm taking pen and paper (creativity may hit at the most random moments) and I promise I won't leave you hanging. I've already written ten more chapter to this story, and hope to write ten more by Sunday before I have to leave the city. I'll upload all I have by Sunday morning and hopefully by my return to the city I'll have more material for you.
Sherlock stood for a while in the street, berating himself for not taking the chance and kissing John, like he wanted, but somehow he felt it wasn’t the time yet. He hailed another cab and returned to his brother’s flat, pleased to find a text message from John when he connected his phone to the charger.
“Oh” Julia Watson gaped at her son. The silence that fell between them was deafening. John looked at Sherlock, begging with his eyes for him to do something
I had to give you something, brief as it was; after all, you've waited for so long. As the writer, I can give them a brief respite.
Certain behaviours his brother presented made him hit the nail in the head and conclude that his brother had an addictive personality. He would get interested in something and act all OCD for a while until he got bored; it had happened with his piracy aspirations -obviously related to Redbeard’s death- his experiments with plants, which soon died as soon as winter came -though he would have wanted he would’ve forgotten his experiments with poisonous plants- and the insane need to have honey all the time, with everything he ate, even though the results were, most of the times, as disgusting as one could imagine -from fish and chips with honey to potpie with honey- his addictive personality bordered in the insane, he would get addicted to something and would work on it for hours at the time; the only thing sticking -the honey, the violin, the dance and chemistry- becoming more important than eating or sleeping, which is why, at some point, Mycroft suspected of some sort of OCD.
Funny fact!
Marcus is called to join the army, Uncle Claudius is not happy, but when Caesar himself calls you, there's nothing left but to leave and serve. He's twenty one after all. The year 55 B.C. marks a change in Marcus' life, he is sent on his first campaign as part of the seventh legion, Legio VII Claudia, to Britannia. The first was a hard campaign against the barbarians, but he manages to survive and help others, he's recognised and praised by Caesar and granted a new rank.
The baby was fine… Sherlock was fuming and John was pissed, but they’ll do anything for their daughter. The supposed fever was explained by the doctor as "a minor case of absence fever” Sherlock scoffed and John snorted, they both knew the doctor was lying. The doctor -an acquaintance of Molly and Mrs. Hudson- decided that the best “treatment” was for them to be together for a few days until the baby was feeling better… to share some with THEIR daughter
“You don’t exhaust yourself, you eat, you sleep and you keep playing your violin and continue with your dance lessons” John kissed Sherlock’s hands, trying to keep his touches as chaste as possible, they’d been dating for two weeks!
“Oh?” Sherlock’s eyebrows shot up and looked really surprised, even more so than finding Molly was helping John.
, the recently appointed scholar of the
“How does it feel?” Sherlock waved his hand in John’s direction.
“I TOLD YOU NOTHING HAPPENED!” Sherlock raised his voice and his hands over his head
22:50 Thanks for the help. Found the brother, singed like a canary. Paperwork tomorrow. Anderson transferred.
Their little army of friends entered the flat after a sort text message from Sherlock. He wanted to share the moment with John and nobody else, which is why they’d been waiting for the text message down at Speedy’s. As soon as they entered, they made teams of two and chose a room. Molly and Greg helped with the kitchen, Bill and Mike helped with the living room, while Eurus and her new boyfriend Jim -James Moriarty- got to work on their bedroom. John and Sherlock took care of Rosie’s room, deciding where the cot should go, placing the rocking chair near a table with a pink and yellow lamp, the small book case close to the cot and a white settee on the wall near the door. Sherlock had made an intelligent purchase, instead of buying several pieces of furniture, he managed to get a cot that became a changing table and could become a bed when needed. It also had enough storage space for her baby supplies and toiletries.
After sharing a wonderful breakfast, and missing another opportunity to kiss, Sherlock walked John back to his Britton Street flat. He said goodbye to Rosie and gave and awkward hug to John before hailing a cab to Paddington.
She was no longer a teenager, even though she was. She was no longer a child, even though, and very at heart, she was still a little girl, dreaming about her days in Uni, finding a good man, having children and a house in the suburbs with a picket fence. She loved plush toys, cherry lolly pops and blowing huge chewing gum bubbles. In her heart, she was a child, but after 90 seconds she became a woman, an adult… a person that will have to assume the responsibility for another human being…
“Sherlock?” Victor had approached him while Sherlock was lost in the memory, he felt a hand on his shoulder but he didn’t feel the thrill, he looked at the offending limb and rolled his eyes; Victor took the hint and retired the hand.
They left Angelo’s with a simple goodbye and stood awkwardly at the door. Sherlock lifted his hand and as magically as everything he does, he summoned a cab “Want this one?” Sherlock asked, not looking at John.
“Hungry?” He asked in a low voice.
They took the phone out, stared at the other’s number and sighed, deeply, putting the phone away and closing their eyes.
“Never in the life…” She giggled “Your mother…” She laughed soundly “Your mail arrived” She placed a few envelopes on the now vacated table “C is free, let me know when the works start” She smiled at Sherlock and left him with his hands covered in suds and rolling his eyes.
Titus Crispus Selus is playing his lute, concentrating hard on the sounds, when a shrill cry cuts the music. He runs to the room and sees his mother, laying senseless on her bed, blood all over the place and a midwife holding his little brother. Father is called home, mother is dying and he'll have to the decide what to do. An hour later he comes to Titus' room and tells him that they'll be moving. Titus wants to cry, but father just shakes his head. A week later, Titus and his brother are sent away to live with their aunt, away from Rome, away from home.
. His eyes immediately had to fix in some man
The week went by hellishly slower. Sherlock’s mood went from usual Sherlock on a strop to “the devil better hide because Sherlock’s on the loose”. He manged to ostracise Irene -who usually succeeded to get his head out of his arse- having her leave his flat, throwing the door and yelling at him that he’s “an insufferable prick”. The only moments when he remained calm were when John called him at night and he was able to see Rosie.
"Sorry for interrupting"
“What?” Sherlock breathed out, confused by the question.
“He?” Eurus smirked and he had to hide his bafflement
She's a genius!!!
Sherlock took a deep breath and continued singing with his deep baritone voice
He squeezed the little hand softly and looked down to his almost asleep son “Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans”
His wayward thoughts got him a bit of trouble a couple of times, mostly because he would freeze in the middle of a sentence, an answer, a procedure; lately he’s been concentrating harder on controlling this particular thought, this line of thinking that left him breathless, uncoordinated, and happy as hell. Mike caught his eye one afternoon, he had taken to walk around the park near Bart’s to relax before classes and he found John standing in the middle of a walking path, smiling at the void, a huge grin on his face and his eyes dazed, lost somewhere or in some memory. Mike snapped him out of it by calling his name and John focused on his friend.
John snorted and rolled his eyes “What, did your last beau leave you already?” He asked, a lot of spite in his remark -even though he wasn’t actually feeling anything but the need to run and find Sherlock, he had him in his mind all the time-, James shook his head and lowered his eyes, fixating his stare on the black beverage in front of him.
-loud and long groan-
“See you tomorrow, Sherlock”
“I’ll get her” Sherlock said and kissed his shoulder “Sleep” John snuggled closer in the pillows and followed Sherlock’s advice; it’d been so long since he had someone to watch over Rosie at night. Sherlock’s voice caught his attention, though, so John left the cosy bed and stood in the dark, near the door frame, watching Sherlock feed Rosie as he walked with her around the small flat and rocked her slowly, muttering sweet nothings to the sleepy baby.
“Yes” John nodded and showed all his teeth in a huge grin.
A clear of the throat later, Sherlock was pulled out of his reverie and his mother was grinning at him, he rolled his eyes and covered the baby again, even though the flat was warm, he didn’t want her catching a cold in the early days of spring. “Mummy, this is Rosie” He put the baby’s back to his chest and held her close, like a little treasure “Rosie, this is my mum” He said to the now very awake baby.
“Excuse you?” He said in a low voice, his temper about to burst.
“Now that you’ve decided to move to two hundred and twenty one b, I’ll be willing to help you ease your way, After all…” Mycroft smirked “You’re a young doctor, struggling with debts and trying to keep your scholarship, provide for that little baby that isn’t even your daughter and keeping a flat with two other friends” Mycroft tried again. He was the one that had told Victor about the money and the title, Victor’s eyes had lightened up; he was disappointed with the young man, although he knew the bet wasn’t real; he needed to measure John, just as much as he measured every single acquaintance Sherlock had, so far Irene was the most loyal, but John was proving he truly was interested in Sherlock.
. He pointed at him and could see his eyes grow darker.
There was a talk to be had, obviously, discuss terms of entanglement, expectations, times and places, trains schedules, travels, Rosie and living arrangements. No sacrifices to be made, no hearts to be broken; clear words had to be spoken to avoid either. Dinner was in order; a little café would be the perfect setting, candle light, good food, great conversation and the two of them in the perfect mood to discuss what might be coming.
As I was writing, we become. And my soulmate and I became under the pen of a writer, but not before we almost lost each other...
“I’d love to meet her”
Hey all! Sorry for not updating all I have, but I've been a bit busy. I'll post all I can this afternoon before I have to leave for work again., Thanks for reading and happy Sherlock!
We all know how Pompeii went, right? No need to recall it. Suffice to say they didn't make it, but something changed the minute Claudius didn't take his own life and Flavius didn't die in combat. Sometimes, more often than not, souls like to die together.
We get lost in the sound, even though it's a happy tune, the sad undertones are there, loves lost in time.
The messages kept coming and John managed to answer a couple, one of them asking about Molly, Sherlock simply answered that he shouldn’t worry and sent another photo of Rosie drinking from her bottle. John was amazed at how at piece his daughter looked and he couldn’t wait to be there with them.
… something akin of a shy smile over those plump cupid bow lips and a definite blush adorning the otherwise pale cheekbones, chiselled on white marble skin. The boy was heavenly
Once alone, Sherlock pulled John in a tight hug and kissed his cheek “Welcome home” he murmured against John’s ear and felt him shiver, but John was too jealous and angry to accept Sherlock’s demonstrations of affection. He didn’t want to ruin their first night, but at the same time he couldn’t let jealousy build up.
“Please?”
"Fifteen, maybe sixteen" I shrug, but I concede, I want to bring peace.
The weekend flew by and before they knew, John was boarding the 5 am to London with a squirming Rosie in his arms and a teary eyed Sherlock standing in front of him.
Past ten in the morning, Sherlock would take her to the park, accompanied by the inconspicuous black sedan and Mrs. Hudson, they would play for an hour, feed the ducks, then he’ll teach her about anything and everything, helped her walk, talk and enjoy the morning. They would return to the flat by noon and feed her once again, having lunch the three of them, if possible. Whenever Sherlock is on a case, John would take Rosie to the crime scene to get Sherlock, and whenever John has a shift, Sherlock would visit and share lunch with him at one of the benches in the park next to the hospital.
John picked her up, still astonished by her actions, Sherlock following close, eyes dazed and looking at the little girl as if he was looking at a miracle unravel in front of his eyes. “I guess we’re going out” John said, still dazed and Sherlock just nodded.
“Do we have a date for the wedding?” Henry asked and they both shook their heads.
The talk with his parents went rather smoothly. Henry and Julia Watson beamed at them, hugging them both “I knew this blokes’ thing was just a phase” Julia shook her head, looking up at the ceiling and smiling “Thank heavens!” She lifted her hands, clasping them before hugging Mary again. Mary tried to smile but her eyes were filled with tears, one look to John and she knew that she hadn’t just ruined one life, she had ruined many in less than 90 seconds.
, he thought “I’ve been meaning to contact you since the day I met you” He said in a whisper and Sherlock had to make an effort to hear him over the noise of the coffee machines and the coffee shop patrons.
!-, even though he was “engaged” to pregnant best friend, Mary Morstan, deceased January 29th; -killed by long-time boyfriend David Thompson, father of Rosamund Mary Watson- same date he met Sherlock and all his one night flings ceased.
“Oh” John smirked “Greg” He chuckled “Yeah, we should kill him” He rubbed Rosie’s back to hide his trembling hands, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath and decided to be brave, once again “The truth is” he moved Rosie a little “I’m very thankful to him for… deceiving us” He blushed hard.
"Rosie is finally asleep." I say around another yawn.
“Yes…” John beamed.
“I wouldn’t allow it” John shook his head “We agreed we’ll try” He took Rosie from Sherlock’s arms and rocked her softly. “Let me put her to bed and we’ll talk” John went back to the bedroom and Sherlock followed.
Not knowing exactly where he was, he ended up in a little pub; the music was nice and it wasn’t too crowded; he could have a beer, drink it at his own pace, not having to compete with seven other men on who was the fastest drinker, or who could hold better their liqueur, or who though was the funniest drunk… no, he could have a pint by himself, calm down, leave at a decent time, and be back in London before midnight… he really didn’t want to go back drunk and have on hell of a headache and an even more disgusting and annoying hangover on the way back to hell…
“Who?”
As life goes by, John had met Victor while he was waiting with Sherlock for some results at the hospital, he had a case and the information he needed could only be provided by a doctor at Bart’s; as for Sherlock, he met James while he was waiting for Victor to collect some papers at the registration office in Queen Mary University of London.
“Yup” John nodded “I think it’s a good idea calling Mycroft” John picked their cups and went to the kitchen “Ready for bed?” He asked from the kitchen door. Sherlock nodded and followed him. They climbed in bed together, wearing nothing but their pants; but by the time their heads hit the pillows they were both fast asleep, it had been a long day.
A hoax, such was written, to kill me, yet, I was asked back. A hoax, an awful hoax. To save our love.
Sherlock blinked again, about to enquiry John about all this, but his mind came to another stop when John reached for his hand and pulled it up to his lips, this time, not even blinking several times worked, his brain was electrified, stupefied, frozen in that single moment when John’s lips touched his knuckles, the sensation going on in an unstoppable constant loop.
"Callistus" says the name on the door, and according to the most privileged clients of the establishment, the ones that have paid top money to see his face, he does honour the meaning of the name, for he truly is beautiful. Curly dark hair, watercolour, mercurial eyes, long, slender body, thin but not wiry, a face with cheekbones that could cut, full lips in a cupid's bow. He looks like a walking, living, Greek marble statue, for he seems to be made of marble.
“We missed you too” John parted and signalled to Rosie. Sherlock picked her up and nuzzled her neck and the baby grabbed his curls. She had grown so much in the month or so he hadn’t seen her. Five months old now, Rosie was quite perceptive and recognised Sherlock’s voice grabbed his finger and pointed at him when John said his name.
“Are you?” Sherlock locked gazes with John and shook his head vehemently “ love you” He said with a low voice, all fears forgotten
Eurus was sent to France too. Vivienne Holmes, Father’s Mother had demanded the presence of her grandchildren at her house as soon as school was over; even Mycroft was “gently” asked to visit -more like forced to attend Mamie’s call- his grandmother and ask for a few days out work. Siger and Violet accompanied their children, they were summoned as well.
“I saw you at the wedding” Victor said, responding the question he thought he saw in Sherlock’s eyes, before he could say anything Victor continued “I didn’t know you knew John” He shrugged and Sherlock inhaled a deep breath at John’s name “I wanted to talk to you that day but with the murder…” He rubbed a hand on the back of his neck and kept his eyes downcast, unable to look at Sherlock.
John couldn’t help but giggle… He’d been giggling since this afternoon, almost non-stop
“What?” John looked up and found rage in those otherwise beautiful eyes
Used real names and timetables from Oxford and Queen and timetables for trains, departures, arrivals and platforms.
“She needs attention twenty four seven” Sherlock continued “Mummy and Father had offered to take care of her while we study and so has Mrs. Hudson. I assume your Mum will want to meet me properly before we take another step and she will be right” John nodded again, his smile faltering “I assume your family might not be that happy, but…” Sherlock had to shrug, he didn’t care “They might say we’re too young, but they were willing to marry you to a girl they thought you had impregnated” Sherlock looked at John apologetically; Mary was a sore point still.
“Mike?”
They ended up in the morgue at St. Bart’s. Molly was there, she’d been working as a junior assistant for the last four months and she received Sherlock there in a regular basis. He would go to perform experiments when he had cases. Most of them, experiments that required equipment too dangerous to have at home -although his mother had offered to “buy whatever you need, honeybee”, he had to refuse- for Rosie’s sake; now the remodelling was underway at 221C, but still, he couldn’t bring himself to accept the mass spectrometer his brother had offered…
"I heard you."
Mrs Hudson looked up and patted Sherlock’s shoulder, brushing some non-existent dust from his suit jacket “ready” she gave him a little smile “You look…” She grabbed his hand “ready” Sherlock nodded and hugged her softly, placing a soft kiss on her cheek “Shall we?” She pulled his hand and Sherlock followed
“Rosie” John pursed his lips “She’s fine. Misses her mum but she’s fine. We manage” John rubbed her little back.
Molly wasn’t really Victor’s friend, but she had met him at the Holmes London Manor. Somehow, Sherlock had become her friend and they talked a lot, mostly because they had lost Eurus to boarding school for her sixth form -an advanced one- and Molly was about to lose Mary to her baby and John. Molly was happy to be Sherlock’s friend and she was there to comfort him when his world crumbled and Victor announced they were over and that Sherlock better continued going to Oxford instead of transferring to Queen.
"My soldier." Sherlock stands and approaches me in a catlike manner, I love how graceful he is, like a panther stalking a prey. His expression tells me all I need to know; and I know the time for remembering is over as he successfully distracts me from the lingering memory.
“I can assure you I’ll be here for her” John continued talking as soon as Mr. Morstan stopped for air “I’ll take care of everything Mister Morstan” John said a bit shyly, but not because he was truly shy, but because he felt like a thief, the worst person on the face of the earth for lying to a man that had been so kind to him.
I'm the "writer", in case you were wondering.
“John.” Sherlock breathed and smiled broadly.
Siger cleared his throat and rubbed the back of his neck “He’s different. He talked about you as if he had met you, his relationship with his siblings improved greatly and ever since you left Rosie with us he has called every single day” The man smiled down at John and John could feel the tips of his ears burning with embarrassment “He says it’s because of Rosie…” Siger shook his head.
“Barely” Sherlock huffed.
“Mum… I love you” He said, honestly “I love all of you, but…” He let out a sad sigh “After James and I broke up you seemed so happy and you didn’t realise I felt as if a I was dying, you didn’t care how I felt and I couldn’t believe how relieved you were that my relationship was over” John shrugged and shook his head at the same time as if trying to grasp a very difficult concept.
Seeing Rosie worked like a charm. The minute he laid eyes on his little girl all his anger and tension melted away and he smiled for the first time in four days. Violet and Siger were at the train station waiting for him, a bag for Rosie and their tickets. It was the second time John had seen Siger and was glad to at least see the man for more than five minutes, mostly because they had spent so much time with his daughter already.
“I don’t care” John shrugged, he didn’t want to discuss his family, but his parent’s thirtieth wedding anniversary was a few weeks away, not to mention the christening of his nephew next weekend.
Everything must start and finish with death, like in Hamlet.
Kanmi sees the man running to them, his head is buzzing, his heart beating madly, he feels utter happiness and can't stop smiling. His father's voice brings him back. Turning, he climbs on the boat, curious about the man running to them, he tries to catch a glimpse, but they set way to a flock of seagulls, sure to find fish there.
“Tomorrow?” Sherlock looked down at the table. The moment turned a bit awkward, but before Sherlock could ask, Billy, the waiter came with their food.
