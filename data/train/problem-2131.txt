John and Mary ate their flattened sandwiches in silence, while Sherlock took out his laptop, placing it in his naked lap and giving a triumphant howl at the functioning WI-FI connection. The sound of the detective's spiderlike fingers flying over the keyboard was the only sound for a long while after that.
He almost expected her to refuse, to storm out the lodge, but she looked at him, expression blank, and nodded. She crossed the room, giving Sherlock a fleeting look before opening the door and walking out into the sunlight.
Sherlock strained his arms again, wincing at the pain which shot through his forearm. The detective considered simply continuing to pull against his bonds so that the pain would distract him from the seemingly inevitable rape. It might further destroy his bones, but at least it would take all of his focus.
"Supposing I do believe your story..." he said, and this time John did not feel anger at the words, as the civil servant clearly was now accepting the scribblings, "then we have no time to spare on dallying here. Which means that I regret to inform you that you would be unable to accompany on this search. This is most inconvenient, as you could have possibly recognized the territory..."
Sherlock squirmed uncomfortably as the rough fabric of the sofa scraped his sun burnt back and shoulders. John shuddered at how he would probably feel in a few hours, not to mention tonight...
John barely looked at him, lost in his own thoughts, and Sherlock knew what his assistant was thinking. The thought had crossed his mind as well that whomever was living out in the forest had now added Mary to their collection of victims.
"God, no!" Sherlock made a noise that could only be interpreted as a groan of despair. "He mustn't know, John! He'd never let me near another crime scene if he did."
The huge mountain man proceeded to manually part his lips, as though inspecting his gums and remaining teeth. Seemingly pleased with his findings, the giant withdrew and turned his back on his captive, muttering some unintelligible command to his two smaller relatives. The scrawny psycho took the idiot's hand - the uninjured one - and tugged, first gently and then with growing impatience, as the oaf seemed much more interested in the proceedings involving Sherlock than anything else.
The woman gave a short bark of laughter which contained no mirth whatsoever. "You really must think I'm stupid, don't you? I saw the bloody condom, you cheating bastard! Are you going to keep lying to me and think I'll buy your pathetic excuses?"
Sherlock endures further abuse at the hands of his inhuman captors. Added to that, it's dinner time for the deformed residents of Bear Mountain.
"Thinking up every bone in the body was something I did during my service in Afghanistan. It helped bring me back down."
"What are we supposed to do now?" John asked, feeling helpless. "It's getting dark, and we still have no idea where they've taken her. We can't just keep going on random. We'll never find her in time!"
"Ah, I'm afraid you can't go into the O.R.," she said, keeping in pace with the man. "There's paperwork that also needs to be done, and--"
"John…" Sherlock took a step forward. To do what? Reason with him again? Pull him up and force him to come along? The younger man had not yet decided.
Please, he silently scoffed to himself. If his career - not to mention childhood - had taught him, anyone could be a threat.
The camera gave one lass dying buzz when John pressed the power button, and it was obvious that they would not get anything more out of it unless they replaced the batteries.
Back arched, the detective came as well, squirting his release over his own stomach. Despite the haze clouding his brain, John could not help but notice that the amount of ejaculate - consisting of only two small pearlescent stains - did not match the apparent force of Sherlock's climax.
John worked tirelessly for hours, scraping away hard-packed dirt with a measly little carving instrument whose intended use was probably something very different. Still so much better than doing it with his bare hands, though. John had to bite back a cry of triumph when he'd finally managed create a hole large enough for his arm. A few more hours of hard work, and he would have his freedom. He and Sherlock.
Reliving the memories was actually making John angry, and Mycroft could hear the anger in his voice, despite the doctor's attempt at speaking low.
Sherlock was frankly surprised any members of the clan were left, based on the damages done by mating within the blood, especially at this length of time. Either they had developed a habit of adding to the bloodline through abducted victims, or - and he hoped this was the case - not many of the family were left.
"Get me ten cc's of propofol, now!" the male voice shouted, and Sherlock found himself quickly sinking back into a bottomless abyss after the drug was injected into his IV.
He barely had time to consider what might happen next when he was bitten. Though John's voice was muffled, he had still shouted quite loudly from the bite, and the giant jolted in surprise at the sharp cry of pain. The mere sight of the furious brute stomping towards John frightened him, and he expected a huge fist to hit him hard enough to break his neck, or dislocate his jaw at the very least. So it surprised him that the mountain man stormed right past him - Sherlock still hanging limply over his shoulder - to slap the childish one for biting.
Sherlock was struggling now, slithering in the giant's grasp like a possessed snake. He had to know what was coming, and the knowledge made him frantic. With his wrists still bound, the amount of resistance he could offer was rather limited, and the strength in his blows, though fuelled by panic, had no effect on his captor's huge, muscular body.
John lay back, lazily stroking himself as the younger man stood up to procure the condoms. His eyes drank in the sight of Sherlock from behind and tried his best to memorize it fully this time: the ectomorphic frame, nearly runway model thin, with legs that went on for miles only to connect with a surprisingly ample behind. John felt an ugly stint of jealousy at the thought of other men lustily grabbing that beautiful arse and bending Sherlock over to bury their dicks in him. He knew that still happened a lot, even lately. Sherlock might believe that John didn't notice, but every now and then the detective slipped out of their apartment only to return a few hours later, hair tousled, lips bruised and swollen from kissing, sometimes even with a not-so-discrete hickey on the side of his long pale neck.
Any hope of communicating the situation was thereby crudely stomped into the dirt, as John didn't believe he had the strength to produce the words required to elaborate. Every sound made by his aching lungs made him feel as though a horse had pulverized his ribcage with a vicious and well-aimed kick.
"If you wear this for the rest of the night," Mycroft suggested, "then you can sleep in my bed with me."
She tried to remember the turns she had taken and felt her frustration increase when realizing that she couldn't. Left, right, right again, left... It was practically hopeless. She did not have Sherlock Holmes' photographic - no, eidetic - memory to help her along.
Mycroft hooked his leg around his brother's only existing one to keep him firmly secured, wondering if Sherlock had taken note of his missing limb just yet. How much of the situation did he comprehend? Mycroft had to remind himself that the inability to speak did not necessarily suggest the inability to communicate in other ways, despite the Holmes' obvious preference for oral communication.
When the plane finally did land, the group still had an issue of finding their latest destination. Originally John and Mary were going to take the Amtrak to a reputable camping ground, but thanks to Sherlock’s intervening, they would have to find a different route.
The man - though loath to admit it, Sherlock found himself doubting his attacker's sex - was probably the result of generations of inbreeding, disfigured to the point that it was doubtful if he could still be classified as a Homo sapiens. Bald except for a few strings of filthy blond, shoulder-length hair, the man was scarred and lumpy, some of his disfigurements probably congenital while others seemed acquired; perhaps caused by prey, human or otherwise, that had fought back.
John wondered if he should have gone with Sherlock despite his reservations, just so that he could extract the detective from a sticky situation, should one arise. Then again, Sherlock had already disappeared from his field of vision, and John did not want to chase him down, like a puppy dog following its master.
Sherlock did not know exactly what time it was. The cabin was too dark to let in much sunlight, and the detective knew he had lost some time during his bouts of unconsciousness.
Mycroft politely declined a refill of tea from the dining hall wait staff and headed back up to his room to make a phone call to the hospital.
Sherlock shrugged, though he knew his older friend could not see the gesture. He gave a joyless laugh, though it hurt him to do so.
At the last possible moment, the skinny monster was knocked aside, thrown off of him and bashed from its grip of the knife, which fell harmless on the ground next to Sherlock. If he could manage to fight the haze brought on by pain and head trauma, he might be able to procure the blade for himself. He would not be able to defeat both of them, but he might have a chance of killing at least one, rage of the survivor be damned.
Finally he made sound, choking out a rebellious cry as he was invaded. Three-finger and One-Eye giggled at the futile attempts of fighting back. The weak jaw tightened and Sawtooth paid it no mind; he knew the little rat was instinctively biting down, but it made no difference. Prey always thought they had a chance at hurting the family, but they did not feel the pain, not nearly to the capacity of Outsiders. It was truly a satisfying, sweet thing to experience, the  realization that they could not hurt their attackers, and subsequent discovery of the pain the family was capable of causing.
Mycroft rubbed at his brow with his thumb and forefinger, deliberating. "What do you say to a deal?"
Closing the browser, he heard Mary approach and smiled at her as she handed him his tea. Two cups were left in her hands.
John had stopped counting the minutes long before the abominable man - after what seemed like an eternity - released himself into his victim. Vision hazy from the harsh treatment of his eyes and the near-unbearable emotional stress he was experiencing, the doctor was still able to witness the mountain man pulling out of Sherlock, his vile member covered in specks of blood. Sherlock's blood.
“He probably thought you looked delicious,” John said, though he knew the play on words sounded stupid.
Even so, the detective had to consider his current predicament. He needed to determine a way to escape, or at the very least be ready in case his captors were going to return. He thought about trying to reach the phone he carried in his jacket pocket, but there was no way of doing that with both his hands and feet tied, and besides there was no reception to be had in this area even if he managed. Sherlock wondered if it was pure coincidence that the culprits had chosen to set up their base of operation here exactly.
Sherlock on the other hand had been comparatively reserved. He allowed most of John's enthusiasm, but the sex itself had been what entrapped the majority of his attention. He delivered one of his perfected blowjobs, easy money after so many years, and allowed John to be on top.
Mary’s excitement had been reserved for much of the time leading up to the day of departure, but two days beforehand, she was downright giddy.
When he returned from the kitchenette with two cups of coffee, one black and the other one black with three sugars, the laptop once again held Sherlock's undivided attention. The detective's keen eyes were fixed on something that on first glance appeared to be just a random collection of pixels in various shades of green. Sherlock had opened one of Sarah Cavanaugh's photographs and was zooming in on the area in the top right corner.
Three-finger thought about the two Outsiders they currently held captive. The plump one wasn't anything to worry about, but Three-finger had an uneasy feeling about the scrawny one. Why had Father insisted on keeping him alive? They rarely came across such willful and unruly prey. The wiry hunter could smell trouble a mile away, and his instincts had so far played a large part in the family's continued survival. Letting one's guard down was a fatal mistake which could cost the clan their home, or in worst case scenario, their lives, or at least their way of life.
"Some of it doesn't take at times, though..." John noted plainly. "When it has to do with someone I care about. Mary, my sister... you."
The thought aroused an idea in the skinny hunter's warped brain. Glancing back at his family once more and judging them to be too distracted to notice, he scurried off to a cabinet and searched until he found a specific bottle.
Even though his first impulse was to inflict another bite, the detective was still rational enough to deduce the likely consequences of such an impromptu act. If provoked, these men might very well pull out every single one of his teeth just to make a point, or perhaps even go one step further and sever a limb… or some other body part he did not want to part with. Sherlock balked especially at the thought of losing his tongue. Though he was likely never going to subject anyone else to his acerbic deductions - not in this life - Sherlock still wanted to keep his most prized asset.
Suddenly their faces were only inches apart, and Sherlock stuck out his tongue, licking a wet stripe along the entire length of John's profile. Their teeth made a clicking noise when they connected, and a tongue invaded John's mouth, exploring his oral cavity with similar enthusiasm. He tried to snake his own tongue around it, force it into retreat, but the spongy muscle evaded capture and was free to continue its assault. Sherlock did nothing by half-measures, not even kissing.
Of course Sherlock had been catheterized; anything else would have been unthinkable given the severity of his injuries, although the elder Holmes wondered if the doctors had been so eager to go ahead with the procedure if they'd known about Sherlock's absolute hatred of wearing a latex tube in his urethra. The urinary catheter - same as the IV - faced the very real possibility of being forcibly yanked out once Sherlock was made aware of their existence and regained enough of his motor skills to do it himself.
Sherlock thought back to his relationship with John. Getting John had been easy; keeping him was what posed the real challenge. How many times had he half-heartedly rejected his friend's attempts to initiate post-coital snuggling on the simple basis that he was not a "cuddly" or "touchy-feely" person? Then leaving, adamantly claiming they would be more comfortable sleeping separately? He had taken John for granted, assuming the doctor's blatant admiration for him, for his brilliant mind, would be enough to keep John at his side without any commitment on his part to meet John's emotional needs. He had misjudged, and John had moved on to find someone who could better fulfill his desire for intimacy. A woman.
He stroked the stiff, filthy dark curls, caked with dried blood and vomit, as well as something that could only be semen. Sherlock had soiled himself while confined within the suitcase, and the onslaught of foul smells emanating from him was almost too much to bear for Mycroft's delicate nose.
"I gave you very precise instructions, Dr. Nasim, and you failed to follow them," Mycroft told the attending surgeon in no uncertain terms. He'd spent a considerable amount of time bandying words with medical staff over the years, practically always regarding Sherlock's care, and doling out reprimands came almost as naturally to him as breathing. There was one vital difference, however. This was America, not Great Britain. His authority did not extend nearly as far on American soil and if he attempted to call in favours just to spite certain people, it might put a crick in international relations.
“I doubt it,” Sherlock suddenly remarked, looking at the way John stared out the window at their client. John glanced back, slightly startled. Sometimes he wondered if his partner really could read his mind.
At one point during Sherlock's transport to the medical facility, the detective's blood pressure dropped dramatically, as signaled by the monitoring equipment, and a few seconds later he subsequently went into cardiac arrest. Mycroft watched with seeming dispassion as the medical crew bustled around the badly injured body of the young Brit, trying furiously to resuscitate him. After less than one minute and a sizable injection of epinephrine straight into the heart muscle, Sherlock's pulse beeped back into existence, and a relieved murmur passed through the aircraft. The younger Holmes's condition had been stabilized. For now.
Mycroft Holmes stared at the computer screen as he might stare at an insolent colleague who was not aware to whom he was speaking. Thin white fingers traced the grooves of the armrest of his chair as he sat otherwise unmoving, looking at the glow of the screen.
More than forty-eight hours had passed since Sherlock and he were abducted, and roughly thirty-six since he managed to escape. Alone. John quenched a sob threatening to break out, partly because he feared how crying would affect his respiration, but also because he did not want to cry in front of the Ice-man.
"I believe we can have him ruled out as our culprit," Sherlock stated calmly and returned the photograph to its original place.
“Well, the train doesn’t go into this town where the resort is,” John said, searching the Amtrak site on his phone.
“You dolt!” she said. “Of course I won’t back out. I didn’t come all the way out here just for sex, you know. I actually like you!”
John did not even bother asking how Sherlock could see that, but he felt like adding that it really wasn't very helpful in finding their missing person.
"A very badly chosen time to go on a vacation," Sherlock quickly interjected. "Considering we've got a new case!"
John sprang to his feet as soon as he was certain the two mountain men were out of hearing range and sprinted the short distance over to the cabin. Still no sounds came from within, so if Sherlock was alive, he was either unconscious or had been silenced some other way. John winced at the thought of what those animals could have done to his friend in such a short time nonetheless.
"Someone from the cabin?" he offered, even though he had a feeling this was indeed the connection they were looking for.
John rolled his eyes. Sherlock was, with or without his diagnosis, still a stroppy bastard. At least some things never changed.
William stayed blissfully quiet throughout the procedure of getting cleaned until his older brother reached into the cabinet to take out a fresh diaper for him to wear. The little boy's previously placid face scrunched up at the sight of the hated object and morphed into an expression of pure disgust, and before Mycroft could react, William lashed out, knocking the folded piece of plastic and stuffing from his hands.
John desperately tried to think of names of bones or muscles, but his mind was giving up on attempting any sort of focus. He could feel the pull of sleep closing its steely fingers around him, making him numb to the outside world.
He briefly observed the practically scarlet mark which the boiling water had left on Sherlock's right hand - a second degree burn this time - and reached for the limb to examine it further. It would no doubt blister and become even more painful if left untreated. Sherlock pulled his hand away before John could grasp it.
"Four sets of tracks by this man, going in opposite directions. Steel-toed boots, the brand is, if my memory serves me correctly, a Timberland Pro product. This fellow is too large to obtain his shoes from a common shoe store, so he'd probably have to get them custom-made. But he's not bothered to acquire new boots in the past fifteen to twenty years, so either he doesn't have the means to do so, or it's not on his list of priorities."
The mountain man was grunting like a pig as he drove himself into the body beneath. Though his rapist's massive frame almost completely covered Sherlock's, nothing failed to muffle his cries of pain, anguish and despair, all mixed into one.
During one fleeting moment of total clarity, John wondered who was going to pay for his care. He knew that no hospital could turn down a patient in need of emergency medical treatment regardless of legal status or citizenship in the US, where public health insurance did not exist. He had, however, actively chosen not to sign up for travel insurance that covered medical expenses, as such an expense would have put an increased strain on his meager budget.
John's eyes bulged when the door handle suddenly turned, and he spun around, ready to throw himself at the door to keep it from opening, but it was too late. Mary stood in the doorway, her silhouette dark against the ambient lighting of dusk.
Sarah Cavanaugh? It was certainly a possibility, unless the clan had killed more people in the past week except poor Mary.
Instead of biting, he strained to turn his head away once more, but a hand from the bigger man joined from the other side. His face was firmly held right toward Sherlock's rape, which did not seem to end.
“No, no!” the woman blurted, loudly enough to bring the attention of several others around them. “If my suspicions are correct, we shouldn’t go into the woods.”
"Well, aren't you a charmer!" Mary playfully exclaimed and gave him a mock-slap. "Oh wait! You're just trying to charm my pants off, aren't you, you naughty boy!"
Sherlock heard a dramatic shuffling of movement as he ascended the stairs towards his own cabin, knowing immediately that Mary had not returned. Sure enough, the door flew open, and for that fleeting moment, he saw the look of hope on John's face, much like Bobbi Ferguson. John's face dropped however when he saw Sherlock, and his body sagged against the door frame.
Eyes darting back and forth among the rapids, he lumbered along the riverside, and he called for his son, keeping a sneaky sense of dread from just bubbling over. Panicking would do no good at present, but he also could not afford to lose Three-finger, his best on-foot hunter.
John looked a little taken aback. "So, added with this other set of prints, that's... three possible abductors?"
Realizing that he was holding his breath, John let it out with a sigh. It was no use pretending anymore. He had been wanting to lose some extra pounds before taking their relationship to the next level. Take up a gym membership, start eating more actual food and less greasy takeaway, walk rather than hail a cab...
It did not take Sherlock long to understand the psychopath's attempts at making the head fellate him, and he desperately tried to ignore the sensation of a slack jaw, moist with putrefaction, against his cock.
The older hunter impatiently shrugged off his brother's bothersome advances and One-Eye withdrew, disappointed and shaken by the rejection. Three-finger usually always had time for him.
Since the nearest train station was more than forty-five minutes away from their destination, taking the train turned out not to be an option. Besides, the threesome quickly found themselves running out of daylight hours. Time difference could be a real bitch sometimes.
The surgeon momentarily hesitated before speaking, and from experience, Mycroft knew that that was never a good sign. People were always eager to tell you the good news but hesitant to deliver the bad ones.
"This one's a runner," the doctor said. "Also, the pathway by that set of prints isn't in so straight a line as the others. Maybe someone the giant was chasing?"
“He seems perfectly at ease going naked,” Mary answered with a small laugh. “Not that I blame him. He’s not terrible looking, body-wise. And such a cute little bum for someone so thin.”
Sherlock failed to suppress a wince when his friend next to him emitted a particularly heart-wrenching cry of pure agony, and from the corner of his eye, the detective could see that they had indeed drawn blood this time.
Mary drove for several minutes, delving ever deeper into woods and finding no other separate paths, and she was worried. Suddenly being lost in somewhere like Sussex seemed like a breeze compared to this. Presently the pavement had come to an end and she was now driving on dirt. Coming to a complete stop, she considered making a three-point-turn in the middle of the road, but the thought of someone familiar with the path coincidentally careening through at that very moment made her nervous. Even now, remaining immobile was a potential hazard, and going back in reverse would be worse.
The Outsider didn't move until Three-finger poked at his ribs with his thick, malformed middle-finger which had earned him his name. The whore twitched, attempting to twist away from the mountain man so as to avoid his touch. Three-finger giggled, prodding the whore even harder, this time leaving a red mark on its skin.
A little over two hours passed before the long-awaited ambulance finally arrived to pick up their patient. In the meantime, Jedidiah Granger and his eldest son, Nehemiah, moved the severely wounded, naked man onto a faded green tarp and carried him to their front porch.
"We'll take care of your brother. He's in good hands." She hesitantly lowered her arm, still suspicious of him but apparently willing to negotiate. He did not doubt, however, that if he continued to make trouble for her, she would not hesitate to call security and have him bodily thrown out of the hospital. Considering he was not in his natural element, it might take him several hours to pull the right strings to get things moving. Sherlock did not have a few hours. He had to play along and at least give off the pretense of cooperation… for now.
"From one of the photographs?" he tried. Sherlock looked at him with a tiny, triumphant smile and turned on the camera. At least they had thought to bring that with them... And charged it.
It hurt how easily John had chosen Sherlock's company over hers even this very morning. Was that abrasive, ill-balanced lunatic really that much more interesting than she, Mary wondered, that John would rather run himself sweaty through a dense forest riddled with mosquitoes instead of spending a quiet, peaceful, relaxing day with her at the poolside?
But Sherlock continued to squirm beneath him like a slithering snake. A spray of tiny blood droplets hit the civil servant's sleeve when the catheter inserted into the back of Sherlock's hand was forcefully yanked out. Mycroft swore under his breath.
Against better judgment, John chuckled as well as one very memorable incident bubbled up to the surface of his memory. That day he had learned that his then-newfound friend sometimes used his rectum as an emergency storage space... and also gotten to know Sherlock much more intimately; perhaps more so than he was ready for at the time.
He set to work on the wood surrounding the nails. Some were easy, having been hammered more quickly and rather sloppily than others, and he easily pried them loose with very little digging. John chipped away quickly and nearly launched a splinter into his eye, but he remained resolute. He continued to tell himself that they would escape, that they were going to survive and return home.
John managed a small, joyless laugh at the thought. He could not help wondering if his friend had gone into histrionics over the fact that the catheter had required shaving part of his head.
"I don't miss him, not really" he said thoughtfully. He managed a rather false looking smile. "Perhaps that's indicative of how close we really were."
A nurse occasionally walked in to check his vitals and inject something into his catheter, probably a strong analgesic to make the pain manageable. John wondered if he stood a risk of dying. Perhaps his wounded body was too weak to fight off the pneumonia, as had often been the case in war-torn Afghanistan; a country where weapons were common, while nutritious food and antibiotics were scarce. Even easily cured ailments such as tonsillitis sometimes led to death. He had seen it happen too many times, especially in children. When the parents finally headed out to seek help, it was oftentimes already too late and all that could be done for the poor afflicted child was to make their final hours as comfortable as possible as bacteria spread through the bloodstream and slowly poisoned them from within.
Sherlock withdrew from the construction of his mind and re-entered the physical world, albeit reluctantly. He knew what was awaiting him there, and he preferably would have wanted to die rather than face his repulsive captors again. Sadly he could not will himself dead, despite some previous displays of impressive control over his bodily functions.
Sherlock shut his eyes. "I wanted to leave. But I wanted the drugs more," he finally admitted. "And part of it was because Mycroft didn't approve. I wanted to be spiteful, to anger him. And..." He paused, eyes still closed. Perhaps he hated seeing the possible look on John's face in response to the truth.
“Sherlock,” John called after him. “Sherlock, wait!” He was genuinely surprised when his partner actually obeyed.
Even so, the dodge caused him to lose hold of the crowbar and it fell quite useless to the dirt. John barely gave the thing lumbering toward him much thought, save for the fact that it had been the same individual who had thrown the hatchet, and that it was coming right for him - and that from the brief sight of it, the creature was dreadfully ugly. John turned on his heel, nearly slipping, and ran for his life, his weapon forgotten.
"Is there any place where we could talk in private, Ms. Ferguson? You need to tell me everything you know about Sarah's disappearance."
“Are you alright?” Mary asked him as he tried to stand on wobbling legs. John turned towards the small walk-in shower behind them and noticed something that might work to their advantage.
With an annoyed sigh, John clicked the current game away. He was hopelessly out-maneuvered by his opponent, and their flight would soon be departing anyway. He might as well fold.
Blood continued to seep from the perforated vein on the back of Sherlock's hand, onto the bed sheets and Sherlock's own naked skin. Mycroft could feel the raw, feverish heat radiating off of his brother's struggling body even through the several layers of cloth between them. The smell of sweat, terror, and hospital disinfectants made for one heady mixture in the small space, and Mycroft felt momentarily nauseated. At least the urinary catheter prevented any potential humiliating accidents involving bladder control from occurring.
John gritted his teeth before answering. “I am on vacation, Sherlock! This was supposed to be just Mary and I, if you’ve conveniently forgotten.”
“I wish you would please just listen. Mary and I – not Mary, YOU, and I, understand – had plans, and we had an agreement, that YOU were staying here, and…” The strength in John’s voice faded as he took a moment to think over his partner’s words. He glanced at Mary, who looked as though she had heard it quite clearly as well.
"Let me in, Sherlock! I have to see it!" he yelled, now practically frenzied in his attempts to dislodge the taller man. John was the heavier of the two, but Sherlock, despite his willowy frame, possessed a wiry strength that was difficult for John to counter.
"This man, whether he was involved in her disappearance or not, would have been one of the last people to see her alive. Thus we'll need to find him, and find out what he knows."
What if John had simply run off to save his own skin? Had the doctor reached that level of apathy to not care about anyone but himself?
John found it difficult to look at the trail of blood, knowing whom it came from. What had the animals done to Mary to cause such bloodshed? Was there a chance that she was still alive in the first place?
She sighed, utterly torn. She had no idea where to turn. And within seconds, focusing as much as possible on the road, she felt the same way quite literally.
Not that Mycroft was at all surprised, not where his younger brother was concerned. But after John Watson had entered their world, the civil servant had to admit that a few - only a few - improvements had been made. Sherlock had for the most part agreed to keep his brother reassured as to his present condition, whether or not he was taking his medication and where he was located, if Mycroft was so lucky. It was a suitable bargain, as it left Sherlock feeling less intruded upon and mothered, and Mycroft remained satisfied.
As Mary continued with the tea, John minimized the software window and opened the laptop’s internet browser, thankful that the resort had WI-FI connection. Searching for the abbreviation itself was not helpful, as the first results produced were the New York Stock Exchange and a carnivorous plant newsletter. Narrowing the search, he entered “cpn drug”.
Mary lashed out a second time when she felt his hand wrap around her ankle. The uncomfortable angle greatly reduced the strength in her legs, but fuelled by panic, she was still able to dislodge him. Feeling like a trapped caterpillar, Mary slid out of the car, landing heavily on her back. The fall caused further abrasions, but she had no time to concern herself over those. What drew her full attention were the boots which seemed to fill her entire range of vision. They were indeed the biggest boots she had ever seen.
"How about you, John?" the younger man asked in an obvious attempt to steer conversation away from himself. "I saw what they did to you, with that awl."
Hearing the rattling doors of the truck slam shut, One-Eye nervously glanced back at the figure in the crate, rearranged a few rags, and - for lack of any other ideas - moved to sit on the bed where the Outsider once lay. Perhaps his relatives might not notice...
No such luck, though. A gnarled, oversized hand entangled in Sherlock's nest of dark curls and jerked his head back to the point of seriously straining his neck. Veins and tendons bulged under the fine porcelain skin, protesting against the violent treatment, while the brilliant young detective's hands desperately clawed at the filthy mattress he was pressed deeper and deeper into.
"I don't, remember?" Sherlock said with a smirk. "I drive myself into fainting spells and fry my skin with the sunlight." He joined his assistant next to the counter as they waited for the water to reach the proper temperature. "And you do better than you think. All of that military training had to do with it, I imagine."
Another twitch passed over Sherlock’s face. Both the doctor and close friend in John wanted to simply hand him the pill.
"Somebody must have started it," John murmured. He opened the photo in a digital photo editing program on Sherlock's laptop and enlarged it further. "Sherlock, what do you make of...-"
Sherlock seemed to have no qualms about walking around naked with just a towel folded over his arm. With slight annoyance, John also noticed that the detective was getting quite a few appreciative glances from the other nudists, women and men alike. Very few of them were even close to Sherlock's age, and John thought, with a sense of satisfaction, that if any of them were looking for a hookup, they'd be wasting their time.
"Dr. Nasim," he said in acknowledgement with a slight inclination of his head. "I want you to tell me if it would be safe - from a medical aspect - to give my brother something to counteract the barbiturates responsible for keeping him asleep."
John shook his head in equal frustration. By pure dumb luck, he and Sherlock had happened upon Mary's path towards the cabin, not to mention the cabin itself. On top of that, the trauma he had experienced within the past day was hammering out chunks of his memory at one time, then jamming them back in later, only to knock out another piece. He scribbled down more words and showed Mycroft what he had written.
"I take full responsibility for what happens," the elder Holmes continued. "You yourself or the hospital need not fear repercussions."
Almost an hour passed in silence. John dreaded to say anything, knowing that Mary was everything but pleased about the development of their trip.
John yelped when the three-fingered lunatic suddenly pinched the flesh of his torso. Its very distinct laughter sounded again, and the creature doubtlessly seemed pleased about the discovery. The doctor choked back a desperate plea of mercy when the giant approached as well, enormous hands stretched out toward John to cop a feel of his own.
"Don't move," he heard, but he ignored it. He was wasting time just lying here in the mud. For all he knew, Sherlock was dead now. It did not matter; he would not leave him to rot away in the cabin of the repulsive monsters who were once men. He turned over and came face to face with the man who knelt at his side. Several teeth were missing on a scruffy unwashed visage. His breath smelled of far too many beers drunk each night. For a moment John felt as though he was back in the hellish cabin. His vision blurred, then became clear again.
Was this guilt, the detective wondered. Did he feel responsible for John's death? Was the guilt truly justified, or was it yet another one of those pesky human sentiments that clouded a person's judgment? Sherlock suspected he would never find out. Emotions on a whole were an undiscovered country for him, and now was too late to start exploring. Could learning to express feelings, or at least to interpret them ahead of time have prevented this disaster?
The notion made him think of Sherlock’s remarks made about her, though it was a common remark he made about girlfriends the doctor had: you know nothing about her. This was an exaggeration – he did not need to hack into personal files in order to initiate a relationship, after all. This was indeed what John told his partner.
"Get me more on this one," he said, tapping the name and handing the list back to his assistant, turning to leave without another word. Telling her to keep him updated on his brother would have been superfluous.
"Focus," Sherlock repeated, his eye contact firm and unmoving. John nodded and shut his eyes, clearing his mind and attempting to regain a sense of calm.
Grip tightening on the whore's head, he shoved, smiling at the pained yelp as his captive's battered body hit the floor. That wrecked arm had to be agonizing.
“But I’m…” John began, lifting his head. However, he knew he sounded enough like a broken record already. “Oh, what’s the use? Maybe I am and I never realized it.”
Another jab of a fingernail and John gave a muffled yelp. He was certain it had been in one of the wounds caused by the awl. Both of the man-child's meaty hands held the doctor's head forward, and his skinny relative pried open John's eyes with bony fingers. He did not bother wondering what filth was being transferred from fingers to eyes at present, not when the giant in front of him relentlessly, furiously ploughed into Sherlock, nails scraping against pale skin and leaving angry red marks.
He patiently waited for the Indian to explain further, determined to keep his features impassive and devoid of any emotion.
"At least you were alive to complain about it," John tried, but it was a lame attempt at combining comfort and humor.
John decided to try and lighten up the mood with some humour. "I wish you'd given me a bit more credit," he said with a wry smile. "You can trust me, I'm a doctor."
No good being angry now, though. Sawtooth squeezed the smaller hunter's shoulder and tugged him backwards, nodding toward the trees. They still had one Outsider captive, and if they wanted to keep it, they could not dally, as Sawtooth was not sure just how long he could trust someone of One-Eye's intellect to look after their sole prisoner.
In pausing to ascertain the state of his friend, John thought he might have heard the rumbling of an empty stomach. As though in agreement, his own stomach gurgled as well. He was a little surprised they had not felt the sensation sooner. As far as he could recall, neither he nor Sherlock had eaten since the previous morning, hours before they had decided to search for clues. And Mary.
Mycroft studied the writing as if trying to decipher a coded message. John figured he was likely judging the truth of the doctor's claims. John felt like strangling him. At the same time he could tell, even from a hospital bed, that Mycroft Holmes wasn't at his best. The man's complexion, while pasty by nature, was a sallow gray, and his sharp, piercing eyes were surrounded by puffy bags which suggested either too little sleep or too much alcohol, perhaps a combination of both. Mycroft's eye-whites were bloodshot, and John noticed he blinked a lot. Dry eyes from being on a plane for hours? Or was there something more behind it?
“Well,” Mary interjected, trying to diffuse the already volatile situation, “think of it this way: if we were at the original hotel, we likely would have had to eat from quite a few restaurants. Preparing our own groceries might be less expensive in the long run. And we’d know exactly what was going into our meals.”
She had once read that people choosing directions on random - like those who were lost in the woods -  most often went in the direction of their dominant hand. Mary was right-handed, but something within her urged her to choose left; a feeling she could not describe but the closest she could think of was like a needle pressed to the end of her spine. The rational part of her brain baulked at the supposed 'hunch'. Her so-called female intuition, raised to such heights by many women, had caused her to make some truly catastrophic choices in the past. Like when it told her John Watson would be a catch.
Mary, fearing that the argument might soon progress beyond verbal, stepped between the two men. "Sherlock, leave John alone!" she berated the detective. "You don't have to get on his case all the time for not having a trust fund like some others..."
Nothing more than a mere twitch passed over the Ice-man's impassive features, and for the next few seconds a deadly silence descended over the small glade and the eight people (minus Sherlock's corpse) that were present.
What was the younger Holmes' preferred painkiller and anti-inflammatory drug nowadays? John thought back on his time living at Baker Street, and he could distinctly remember a bottle of Aspirin on Sherlock's shelf of the bathroom cabinet, and, come to think of it, sometimes also in his coat pocket.
Daylight was rapidly becoming increasingly scarce, and John cursed himself for omitting to bring a flashlight. Sherlock often forgot even the most essential equipment; it was John's job to plan ahead, be responsible, and make sure the detective did not simply throw himself headfirst into dangerous business. Could he blame his lack of preparation on the fact that Mary's disappearance had made him, as Sherlock would say, 'emotionally compromised'?
John rolled his eyes. “Not all of America is like an excerpt from shoddy horror film. Especially not all of the Appalachian Mountains.”
Opening the door, she inspected the situation in disbelief. A creek traveled parallel to the road, but had also forked across it, thus creating the mud. Mary frowned when she noticed what looked to be a small, improvised dam at the other side of the road.
John had been to America before, but that was years and years ago, before he enrolled in the army. And he had never visited New York City. Regretfully he realized that the closest he would come to seeing it was from the airport, as a trip to the Big Apple was simply not cut out for his current finances. He had unceremoniously refused any funds offered to him by Sherlock, as he did not want to depend on his flatmate for a living, especially not where Mary was concerned.
He understood the hint, of course; he was not that dense. Despite having dated for the past two months, John had not yet taken his relationship with Mary to the next phase, even though he'd had plenty of opportunities to do so. Something just made him hesitate. Would Mary find him lacking or inadequate in the size-department? Would she find the expanse of his waistline a turn-off? Would he be able to please her? Would he even be able to... perform?
"Yes, you're right," John replied. He absent-mindedly scratched at his jaw, feeling stubble that needed to be shaved.
No way we'll be getting the deposit back on the rental, she thought. Were the circumstances different, she might have laughed.
Sherlock, meanwhile, had taken up a seat on the couch and not moved since. He had unceremoniously shoved John's improvised bedding aside and sat with his long legs crossed, balancing his laptop precariously on one knee. John hated the fact that a lousy internet connection was their only means of communicating with the outside world, short of asking to use the landline for the resort itself.
Now John was angry on top of every other emotion currently plaguing him. His infamous temper flared like a beacon, and he wrote one word, two letters, both capitalized, before practically throwing the notepad at Mycroft.
A familiar wrinkle formed at the center of John’s brow, an expression Mary had now become familiar with. It seemed to appear most often whenever Sherlock was involved.
Fingering on the sheath of his ever-present dagger, the clan leader considered his options. He could kill their captive on the spot, or he could try to stash it in a place where he could hopefully reclaim it later… assuming this ruckus with the Outsiders had blown over and the clan could return to their home.
Despite everything they had gone through together, John had never, not once, seen or heard Sherlock Holmes cry. He had seen the detective screaming in fury, laughing like an uncontrollable maniac, and practically everything in between. Many times he had seen his friend's features contorted in ecstasy following a toe-curling orgasm, and each time he had felt intense pride at being the one responsible for such deep, uninhibited pleasure in a normally untouchable man. But he had never seen Sherlock cry.
It took him less than half an hour to shower, shave and dress himself in a new, fresh set of clothing. He decided to forego his usual grooming session, which included plucking his unruly eyebrows into a more conservative shape and applying concealer to his face to cover up his abundant freckles. Mycroft was accustomed to getting ready on short notice and saw no point in dallying.
“And this is any different?!” John snapped, his voice loud enough for anyone to hear within a twenty yard radius. “You don’t get it! I thought you did, but clearly you don’t. This was my time away from everything! No emergencies, no cases, and no YOU.”
He also thought of Mary Morstan and whether she was still hanging upside down in the shed, naked, with her throat slit and glassy eyes, now clouded over, staring into vast nothingness. What had been the last thing Mary had seen? How long had she been alive after having her throat slit with a blunt, serrated knife? Sherlock knew that Mary had been alive when she was strung up and bled out like a pig slaughtered according to Kosher dietary laws, but he had purposely omitted sharing that information with his friend.
How would you know what I don't want, Mycroft considered sarcastically asking. His exhaustion and lack of nutrition was beginning to wear him down, but adrenaline maintained his awareness. He craned his neck to see past the working men and saw the hint of a suitcase. As they stepped aside from having cleared it off, he could see it was a very large one. Just as he had suspected, the tube led straight into an opening in the zip.
"He got sixteen years for attempted murder," Sherlock interjected. "Added to all those other felonies he'd been piling up for quite some time. The parole board will never accept his request. Either way, Mycroft has a say in things, and he'll make sure it doesn't happen."
Mycroft tilted an eyebrow and might have smiled for the one moment of jest between himself and his PA.
Mycroft accompanies a SWAT team searching for Sherlock and the disfigured perpetrators in the woods.
"What are you doing that for?" Sherlock asked, though he knew the answer. The mantra reminded him of something from a program he saw late on television as a child, of a boy reciting the names of birds to ward of some nightmarish thing.
“I’m going to need some help reaching my back. I expect you took a closer look at the photos,” Sherlock said, oblivious to his partner’s annoyed state. Only when he realized John was not going to answer him did he look up. He raised his eyebrows, as though to say “I’m waiting!”
"If we give him about ten minutes, he should come around by then," Nasim informed the elder Holmes brother as he injected the new chemical into Sherlock's IV.
“If you want me to stay in this half-hearted little apology,” she grumbled, “you had better stop saying ‘sorry,’ right this instant.”
Anthea asked no questions, and not quite two minutes later, Mycroft was holding a paper cup full of steaming hot coffee, which he experimentally sipped once it had cooled down to sustainable levels. His PA dutifully stood by him, obviously awaiting further instructions. Mycroft had a feeling she wanted to tell him something.
“And that might be where she went next,” Mary concluded, looking over the doctor’s shoulder. Though he voice was mostly calm, John thought he could hear a tiny trace of anticipation in her voice. Her eagerness seemed genuine, and it stirred a sense of pride in John. The young adventurous boy in him was suddenly excited in the case and wanted her to accompany him in the investigation. An invitation he was sure he would never grant her, for fear of her wellbeing, but it was an amusing thought.
"How long did it take for Sherlock to relapse that time?" Mycroft asked from the video feed. "Ninety-two days?"
Making a subtle change to his position in an attempt to alleviate the pain in his shoulders, the detective had to admit defeat when the change did nothing except worsen the ache. Blind, immobile, and only able to breathe through his nose, he tried to utilize the only sense he still had control over by listening for sounds that might indicate either the return of his captors, or - as Sherlock desperately hoped - his saviour.
"Your sense of perspective is ridiculous," Sherlock replied, continuing to walk as though he knew exactly where he was going. He likely did, John surmised.
John felt a slight lurch in his stomach at the remark. Even though Mary clearly did not like Sherlock, she still found him pleasing to look at. Did she think vice-versa about John, that she loved him as a person but found him unattractive?
"Of course. Sherlock..." She glanced at the sleeping man on the sofa with weary contempt. It was strange how young and innocent he looked in his sleep; truly a strong contrast to his wakeful self.
Silent - perhaps refusing to speak now that they had left the imagined safety of his brother's room - William finally nodded and picked up the pace of his walk. They entered the bathroom, closing the door behind them before turning on a light. This routine had been practiced down to a well memorized step-by-step process.
The woman repeated the message and asked if anything else should be written, but Mycroft politely concluded his phone call and the conversation came to an end. He knew full well that John would not leave things at that, but he frankly dealt with worse people for a living.
"Yes... Yes, of course." Knowing that he could not enter the pool wearing the robe, he finally discarded it, but not without a certain amount of hesitation. Mary had never seen him naked before, and his insecurities regarding his recent weight-gain weighed heavily on his mind, more than figuratively speaking.
“Considering Sherlock, it might not take anything done by us to be forcibly removed,” John remarked, trying very hard not to squirm. Part of him was constantly saying over and over in his head that Mary did not care how he looked, that she liked him just fine despite the extra pounds. But another nasty part of him gave him the urge to dash for his robe or towel as soon as he was so much as halfway out of the pool. He hated the way his belly pressed against Mary before anything else on his body did.
Sawtooth gave the smallest hunter a warning glare. He had not forgotten Three-finger's earlier defiance, not by a long shot. Would he need to assert his dominance for the second time in less than a day? Perhaps a blow to the head was not enough to cow the rebellious streak his eldest seemed to have developed lately. Perhaps some more extremes measures were indeed required. Sawtooth would not hesitate to use the methods he had used to subdue the stubborn Outsider on his own son.
John was listening, though he did not appear to be. Eyes squeezed shut to block the tears from their release, he breathed slowly, trembling. Sherlock took a cautious, quick look past their impromptu hiding place, and ducked back again to find John muttering some unintelligible chant under his breath. He listened closer, wondering if his assistant had inconveniently checked out emotionally, and realized what he was hearing:
“Yes!” the younger man tilted his head back, bouncing on John’s swollen prick and feeling as though it plunged deeper into him than ever before.
Sherlock had not adopted the use of his middle-name until the age of sixteen, and in his current state of agitation, his memories were likely to be an amorphous, muddled mess. Perhaps, Mycroft thought, he would get through to his brother by calling him by his given name, like when Sherlock was a little boy.
Drooling in excitement, the lunatic watched Sherlock's face intently as he leaned backwards and pressed down on the trap's jaws. Sherlock nearly threw up at the pain, and he felt bile climb up his throat when his attacker leaned forward again, hot puffs of foul breath beating against his face.
"I never thought I'd say this, but I feel really comfortable here," Mary said. "That's crazy, isn't it, but after ten minutes without any clothes, you kind of forget that you're naked. We're all equals here. I like that."
Sherlock immediately scoffed at his own thinking. "Logical reasons" and these beasts should not be mentioned in the same sentence.
Sherlock wished that John would not scream from underneath his gag. Provoking a reaction from their victims was exactly what these primitive psychopaths were after, and John was handing it to them without the slightest bit of fight. The wisest plan of action at present was to show as little emotion as possible; anything to make their captors to lose interest and thus allow Sherlock to start planning their escape.
Damn it, he had even forgotten to bring his Swiss army knife. The astoundingly clever piece of equipment lay unused in his suitcase; his original reason for bringing it having been a desire to impress Mary by showing her how good he was with tools, but it was useful for a lot more things than he had anticipated. Like picking a lock. John doubted Sherlock had brought his lock picking kit, useful though it might be.
Mycroft's eyes were immediately drawn to the jagged, festering puncture wounds on the corpse's left leg, recalling what John Watson had said about the bear trap, and in that moment the elder Holmes openly and viciously wished that the ex-army doctor had been the one lying dead and buried in the suitcase instead of his brother. It could have been John. It
Sawtooth could not perform again so shortly after his latest climax - which he'd regrettably wasted on Three-finger - but that didn’t mean he could not have fun with his new toy in other ways. He considered making the whore clean his member using its tongue, but knowing his luck, the smooth little rat would probably puke all over his lap, just like it had when he made it suck him the previous day.
“I guess it’s something we’ll have to work on then. If you’re patient with me, I’ll be patient with you.”
“I thought maybe you had been wanting to initiate something between us, but… lately, I’m not so certain anymore.”
Why couldn't they have chosen him instead? He was a soldier, used to taking the brunt of an enemy's cruelty to protect others. He had, however, failed to protect both Sherlock and Mary, the two people closest to him. Was this his punishment for his fecklessness, John wondered, to watch his loved ones suffer and die before his very eyes?
He suddenly realized that he should have secured photographic evidence of Mary Morstan's remains the moment he discovered them. John probably had no desire to re-enter the shed, but Sherlock knew that emotional distress could make people do the most foolish of things without any thought of the consequences. In this case, he suspected John might very well mess with the crime scene, perhaps by attempting to cut Mary down from the beam.
"You may want to skip this one, sir," said the Hispanic officer - identified as Hernandez by his name tag - and moved to physically restrain Mycroft, who suddenly wished he hadn't left his umbrella in the helicopter, as he currently wanted to use it to bash the man's head in.
"I think you're being too hard on yourself, Sherlock. You didn't choose this. No one would think less of you just because... because you have an illness."
Both Sawtooth and Three-finger were already frustrated when they arrived home. They had gone downriver to search for the chubby Outsider, but instead of the waterlogged corpse they had expected to recover, they found no trace of their prey. Either the river's current had taken him much further than preconceived (and much faster at that), or the Outsider had somehow managed to break free and escape... and both hunters seriously doubted the latter.
Sherlock buried his head in his hands, sifting long fingers through his dark, still-damp curls. John could hear him hyperventilating. "I'm not crazy," he repeated. "I'm managing it. I've been managing it since I was sixteen!"
John had long since given up fighting against the current. Instead he focused his remaining strength on keeping his head above the surface, which turned out to be quite a challenge in itself for a wounded man with limited mobility in his upper limbs and having suffered major bloodloss. Occasionally he inhaled too early, or a fraction of a second too late, and water entered his mouth, threatening to fill his lungs.
Breath heavy and hard, the giant unhooked his stained overalls and let them fall to his ankles. Apart from the tattered shirt - Sherlock briefly wondered where on Earth these brutes could find such a size - the clan leader was naked. Meaty hands clamped at both sides of Sherlock's head, and they seemed strong enough to crush the young man's skull. But crushing skulls was clearly not on the monster's mind, not when his frighteningly large cock was beginning to perk with arousal.
John rubbed at his face as though in an attempt to clear his mind of the whole story. He finally sighed and looked back at the screen.
John was about to object but held his tongue when he thought the situation over: did he really want to put Sherlock in charge of a rental car in an - to them - unknown country? Just as impulsive as a driver as anywhere else, Sherlock was bound to at least cross a few speed limits assuming he didn't drive the car into a tree.
If I even go, John considered saying. But again, he did not feel like getting into another argument.
The detective did have a point. They could be wasting valuable time. Wordless in their decision, they continued onward.
No. The Outsider's poor state of health dictated against it. Rather than making it live longer, such a drastic action could, and probably would, kill the whore on the spot.
"You're really tense..." the doctor said, his hands no longer simply applying the lotion, but kneading the long, thin muscles of Sherlock's torso. He admired the expanse of skin, creamy pale where it wasn't burnt red, unmarred by scars or blemishes. So unlike John himself. He thought about puckered scar tissue that still surrounded his bullet wound on both sides, and how it felt to touch it. He had sometimes witnessed ill-concealed shock and even disgust on certain women's faces, but his scarred body had never been an issue with the detective.
"Mr. Holmes, I..." The surgeon quickly reined himself in. "I'm sorry, I know you're a busy man. I'll try to fill you in on your brother's status."
"Yes, isn't that why you came to speak with me?" Mycroft was quickly losing his patience with the nervous, rambling man and thought about how he would have preferred to receive the information from Missy instead, even though she was merely a nurse and not a medical specialist.
Wondering briefly if Mycroft's Skype account had been created exclusively for Sherlock, John selected the contact and skimmed through the previous conversation, although it involved little else but infrequent small talk, perhaps the occasional question of what Sherlock's daily schedule was like. John couldn't help but wonder if the words were codes for something else.
"I intend to find their nest and search it through. Look for anything that could be used to incriminate them." Like a body, or remains of one, he thought, but did not say it out loud, as he suspected Ferguson did not want to think of her friend in such terms.
His grip on the crowbar tightened further as he rounded a corner that would offer him better insight into the backyard. The doctor later supposed he had his army days to thank for his above-average reflexes, because the moment he stepped into view, a hatchet was swung at him and very likely would have severed his head from his neck had he not dodged before his conscious mind was made aware of the danger.
The scrawny whore lay on the floor, fresh blood coating its thighs and ass-crack. Three-finger threw a hateful glance at it, hoping it would bleed out. If only they'd killed it and its pudgy little companion at once, they would not be in this mess. Now Outsiders were threatening their home, their very existence, all because Sawtooth had wanted a shiny new toy.
"MN!" the plump one objected. He got a lick across his face by One-Eye for the protest, as well as a hard jab with a jagged-nailed finger.
"Fine." William reluctantly stayed in place while his big brother secured the diaper on him. He hated everything about it; he hated how it restricted his movement, how it made his skin itchy and red, and most of all he hated that it could be seen from the outside that he was wearing one underneath his clothes. Almost no kids his size wore diapers anymore. Except for the ones with "special needs", which was really just fancy adult-speak for saying that there was something wrong with them. There was nothing wrong with him. He was not stupid, so why did he keep wetting himself?
“First of all,” he said, “I have never thought of you as crazy. Never. I’ve only ever thought of you as yourself.”
"So we're good, then?" he asked hopefully, giving Sherlock a playful nudge with his shoulder. "Still friends?"
Anthea had stepped forward to check him into the hotel the previous night, as she had picked up on the chaos that was clearly brewing in his mind. The establishment was not incredibly shabby, and for a moment he considered just falling into the bed without bothering with a sleeping pill, but he knew the moment he put his head down he would fall into an endless spiral of those chaotic thoughts, and then he'd be of no use to anyone in the morning.
The noise abated once the paramedics entered the helicopter with their patient. John kept his eyes closed for the most part, picking up a few words here and there, mostly medical jargon which he knew quite well. An oxygen mask was placed over his face, and he felt one of the paramedics searching for a suitable vein on his arm - the left one - to insert an IV catheter.
Nasim was a little surprised, as family members and loved ones usually begged for more time with the patients, but he had gotten enough of an impression of the elder Holmes to not be outright shocked that he was leaving already.
He chuckled nervously. At least there was that. And no Sherlock. In fact, he was uncertain if Sherlock even knew how to swim. There were surprisingly many menial tasks that the genius did not know how to do, and had no interest in learning.
"No, don't be; it felt nice." Sherlock, whose breathing had become decidedly heavier, turned so that they were once again facing each other. He grasped John's smaller hands with his own and replaced them on his body, this time on the front. The doctor took the opportunity to stroke the nearly hairless chest, and felt Sherlock's nipples harden beneath his fingers, turning into small, pebbled nubs. It was a familiar response, and one, he realized, he had missed.
Despite his fatigue and poor physical condition, Mycroft's memories of the past twenty-four hours were as sharp and detailed as ever. Low blood sugar apparently did nothing to impede his cognitive functions or his uncanny eye for detail. Sometimes he almost wished there was some way - any way - to slow down his brain that did not involve alcohol or sleeping agents. It was a Holmesian trait he shared with his brother, except that Sherlock's condition was further exacerbated by his bipolar disorder. Had shared with his brother, anyway. It was far from certain that Sherlock would even pull through, let alone that he would come out of this with his extraordinary mind intact.
"One thing, sir. I've received a number of voicemail messages from John Watson. He's asking about your brother. What would you like me to tell him?"
"I did look through the photos. You were right, there's more to it than just woods out there. I saw the chimney smoke."
He was jarred back awake when he heard the roar of a rough voice that made the scrawny fiend straddling him stop and look up. More footsteps, much heavier, approached, and Sherlock turned his faltering gaze to the leader of the clan. The detective did not need to know their language to understand that the giant was vastly displeased.
Sherlock's unending fog of despair immediately brought him to thoughts of improvised lubrication for further endeavors of violation, but as the cup came closer, he quickly perceived that this fluid was not nearly thick enough. His new suspicions were confirmed when the cup was all but shoved into his face. Water.
Not a complete stranger to hand-to-hand combat, he countered with a strike of his own: a side-kick aimed at the attacker's shin. The attempt at disabling his attacker would have sent anyone else to their knees, he was certain of it. What surprised Sherlock was that the wiry beast continued to move as though the kick had not even been delivered, save for the sheer force moving his foe's entire leg back. Otherwise, the inhuman thing showed no sign of pain whatsoever, and Sherlock hardly had time to marvel over the strange lack of a reaction.
"We will stop these bastards from ever doing this to another person ever again," Sherlock said, his voice and resolve firm and steady. "They will be brought to justice... but only if we keep a clear head and push on."
The shaking of John's legs increased by each step he took toward the nightmarish lodge. He had found a rusty old metal rod in the woods near the backyard which he now carried with him. Still he heard no sounds from the cabin. John stubbornly refused to admit the possibility that the silence meant there was nothing left for him to save.
“I assure you, that’s not the case,” John said, desperate to simply leave and hope they would not have to sleep in the car due to Sherlock getting them kicked out.
John knew he had to choose his words carefully so as not to walk directly into Sherlock's trap. Inexperienced though he was at emotional manipulation, Sherlock seemed to know how to guilt trip his best friend and flatmate.
The detective, defiant as always, kept his eyes firmly trained on the three cannibals. Under normal circumstances, meaning if their captors had been fully human, Sherlock would have been nattering off deductions, some of them very delicate and personal, in order to provoke the criminals and throw them off balance, which in turn would leave room for mistakes that might grant Sherlock and his stalwart partner an opportunity to escape. There was, however, not a language the detective could speak that would not sound like meaningless gibberish to these men.
Sherlock's head snapped up. "Is that right?" he said bitterly. "Weren't you just now wondering if you've been dealing with a crazy person? Would you even have wanted to move in with me if you'd known?"
"Are there any pre-operative health problems we should know about?" the nurse inquired. "Any hereditary conditions or...?"
Asking for directions in Cumberland rewarded the group with derisive looks, though not to anyone’s surprise. When someone finally did look at their map – casting another sidelong glance in regards to the scribbling – John and Mary’s guessed route turned out to be correct.
Once inside, John gave the woman at the front desk a fleeting look before he turned his head. Though she wore a skirt for hygiene purposes at a publically used desk and chair, she was otherwise topless. John could not help his physician instinct from taking over as he continued to give sidelong glances her way. From the neck - or what was left of it - down, she resembled an overweight man; he would have guessed visceral fat from the way her stomach stuck out further that her breasts. She gave what in her estimation had to be a welcoming grin as she greeted them. Her gapped teeth looked beyond yellow.
This man was none of that. He'd even held his own against Three-finger before the patriarch himself got involved. Probably he had fought battles before, perhaps with his life at stake. His feisty nature coupled with his unusual appearance titillated Sawtooth. He would take great pleasure in cowing the spirited Outsider. Despite his years, Sawtooth always enjoyed a challenge.
"She's been gone five hours now," John said when 4 p.m. rolled around and there had still been no word from Mary. "Something's wrong, Sherlock! You agree, right? Sherlock!"
But why? It made no sense at all... Unless, of course, the purpose of the dam was to stop the outflow of water from the road and favor the creation of mud. Which in turn would trap vehicles.
Looking up proved impossible at first from the cramped space of his tiny cell, but he managed to gain enough wiggling room to right himself. He tried to ignore the stains on the walls around him, despite the close proximity, and he did not have to think very hard to realize they were from the blood of countless victims from the past. Instinct told him to curl up into himself, but he resisted. He heard the rustling of Sherlock getting his bearings in the adjacent cell and turned on his side to address him.
Sherlock bristled. “Touched in the head was term they used,” he snapped. “Not that they have any sort of mental capacity themselves.”
He bent the whore's head backward, exposing the long, pale throat and preparing to slit it. Before he could do the deed, however, Three-finger grasped his forearm, his misaligned eyes glinting from behind a heavy brow. The smaller of the two needn't even speak out his request. He wanted to be the one to finish off the scrawny whore.
"This looks like the place," John announced, looking back and forth from the camera to his and Sherlock's surroundings. "Then again, all of the trees are starting to look the same."
John wasn't sure how he felt about being compared to the Ice-man in any fashion, but he decided to let that one slide for now.
His face read of deeply wanting to defy the need to be quiet. Though he resisted, the temptation was terrible. Mycroft would hate to find out how his brother would be as an adult... if he lived that long; William already gave the dreadful impression that he would get countless people cross with him in the future.
He felt Sawtooth enter him, immediately thrusting into his spindly body. He could take it, every plunge. He endured the treatment, as he always had, and listened to the peaceful snuffling and snoring of his brother, who lay blissfully unaware of what was going on. One-Eye had never in his life been approached, and Three-finger was glad for it. Instead, he locked eyes with his father's plaything, and the pleasure he felt at the terror on the whore's face was enough to help him reach a release of his own.
"The... facilities are well-maintained," John offered in a feeble attempt to add to the cheerful atmosphere. He could sadly not say that he was very comfortable being seen without clothes. It would have been a blatant lie. The only aspect of coming here that pleased him was the fact that the bill was going to Sherlock.
Sawtooth cut the rope holding the blonde whore up and threw the body over his shoulder. The pool of blood on the dirt floor from her slit throat had congealed into a thick, rubbery, dark brown sludge. Three-finger had witnessed on several occasions when his younger sibling bent down to lick coagulated blood off the floor, especially during the colder months when food was scarce.
Smiling, John nuzzled against the younger man as he placed an arm over a bare, pink chest. Resting his head on the detective’s shoulder did not seem to bother Sherlock, so he remained where he was. Silence followed for the next few minutes.
However… He would not mind at all if the scrawny whore happened to die. Considering Sawtooth had decided he wanted to keep the whore, there was nothing Three-finger could do without drawing attention to himself and thus earning a hefty punishment. Unless… the Outsider died by itself.
The doctor seemed in a daze, but he swallowed, his throat feeling so dry, and then nodded. "Shall we go back to the trail we found earlier?" he asked, steeling his mind and desperate to stamp out his faint feeling.
John only received a brief visual of the red stains dotting the driver's side door before he was crying out.
"Coming, my dear!" John called back with mock cheerfulness as he struggled with his robe. The waistband was still nowhere to be found, and John had to accept the possibility that Sherlock might have pulled it loose and discarded it somewhere outside the room.
John suddenly wanted to change the subject, but he knew Sherlock would not. He absent-mindedly trailed his fingertip along Sherlock’s slight stomach, feeling the occasional hair.
"Yes, at 6:23 this morning. His respiration rate is normal, and his oxygen saturation is also within limits of normal range, considering--"
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut, wishing he could also block his senses of taste and smell. He was too weak to fight back, and even then, he would only be hurt worse than before, and still be forced into pleasuring the bastard orally. The best he could do presently was escape into his mind in an attempt to block out what was about to happen. This had not been the first time he had done so (willingly or otherwise), and depending on the response of his captor, it might not be his last.
Heart racing, he headed back the way he came, pausing at the door to listen for sounds that suggested he had been caught, hearing none, and finally yanking the door open. He slunk along the exterior of the cabin, again stopped, and carefully peeked around the corner. John remained where he sat minutes before, though the events of the day had tensed his body into defense mode, ready to spring up and use the crowbar. He was looking right in the other direction, as though he had heard something in the woods, but he was still holding a stubborn, loyal vigil over Mary.
Ambulance? Where the bloody hell were they going to get an ambulance? As far as John knew, he was surrounded by miles upon miles of forests. According to the information about the area, the nearest hospital was forty minutes away. Nearly two hours of driving, and then God only knew how long he would be treated before he could tell anyone about a second person needing medical care...
The slightly sarcastic delivery of the line suggested that Sherlock was, despite everything, still his old self. Only the slight tremor in his voice revealed that something was amiss in the first place.
The lack of food and water must have been taking its toll on him. Either that or his injuries were making him delirious. Neither was a good sign.
He banished the thought from his brain, determined not to go there again. He had a real shot at a meaningful and loving relationship with Mary; he must not screw that up by dwelling on the past.
Sherlock stood leaning against the wall, motionless as he stared at both man and laptop. He tried to maintain a blank expression, but his blanched blue eyes betrayed him. John suddenly had the strong urge to hurry forward and embrace him, but he had a feeling he might get pushed away or hit. He expected Sherlock to remained silent and possibly even walk away from the situation, but the younger man stayed put.
"You would think this might attract bears, coyotes... whatever animals are indigenous to the area," John remarked quietly.
He thrust his phone in under John's nose, proudly presenting whatever that was on the screen. At this distance, John could not read it.
“O-oh…” he nearly stammered. “Alright.” Hesitant, he finally sat down on the edge of the mattress. Down to his boxer shorts, he realized this was the most naked he had ever been around Mary. He wondered how naked Mary was underneath that sheet. Supposedly he would find out in a few seconds.
"No, nothing," said Nasim. "Your brother hadn't yet been extubated at the time, so he was unable to speak. But he was visibly agitated and nearly pulled his IV out. Had he not been sedated, he could and probably would have exacerbated his injuries."
Though Sherlock's heart rate was still 120 beats a minute, his breathing was less laboured than before, and John took that as a good sign. He brought a can of Coke for his friend, briefly holding the cool aluminum against said friend's overheated cheek. Sherlock's eyes closed, and a pink tongue snaked out to wet already moist, full lips. In another context, it would have been a highly erotic sight, and John had to remind himself that he was there as Sherlock's doctor, not lover.
Much like how the chlorine had taken John aback when he first entered the pool, the sudden wave of heat within the sauna was a surprise, though John had expected it all the same. Already Mary was spreading out her towel and reclining on a bench. Not one to look as though blasé about any activities, John undid his own towel and took a seat next to her, although he put his arms in front of his torso, as an awkward attempt to obscure his stomach.
"We'll get you something to drink in just a minute." John watched as the long, lean muscles in Sherlock's limbs began to shake, and he realized Sherlock was in danger of passing out again. He had to be rehydrated, quickly.
Nearly as soon as she wondered what to do, she just so happened to look to her left and caught a hint through the trees of a distant yet bold red. She squinted, desperate to confirm her suspicion.
The final statement was not the warmest, simply an automatic gesture of proper etiquette, though he was grateful for the work done by the medical staff. It could have been worse: the rescue team could have taken Sherlock to the hospital where John was sent.
Mycroft glanced aside and John nearly thought he saw vulnerability in the elder Holmes' eyes for a brief moment. He chalked it up to the choppiness of his recorded image on the computer screen.
Was this it? John wordlessly asked himself. Was this how Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were to meet their end, not battling the likes of a criminal mastermind, but slashed to ribbons as food for inbred degenerates?
He watched as his son tormented the short, pudgy man, making him scream. That one was meat, pure and simple. They still had the whore from earlier to chop up, and Sawtooth was positive his little clan would feed off of her for at least a week. All they had to do was keep this one confined until it was his turn to be butchered.
Bobbi was starting to look uncomfortable. "I'm not sure we should be doing this..." she murmured, nervously wringing her bejeweled hands.
The flight over to the BWI airport strangely enough felt longer than the transatlantic one, even though it lasted less than an hour. John was not in the mood to speak, and neither was Mary. Perhaps she regretted even going on this trip with him. As things were turning out, she had good reason to.
John turned to face him. “The agreement was that I assist you with questioning Ferguson. And we’re finished questioning.”
John replaced all of the pills except one. The one he kept dug into his sweaty palm and he had to force himself to open his hand, lest the engravings dissolve and render the pills unidentifiable.
Mycroft felt momentarily lightheaded when he rose to his feet to exit the helicopter, now safely on the ground, but he was adamant not to let it show. Not to Anthea, and most certainly not to the men - Americans - who were escorting him. Mycroft would have preferred to have been accompanied by his own British specially trained unit, but there hadn't been enough time to pull the right strings, and Mycroft Holmes, a man who valued diplomacy whenever possible, had quickly made the decision to accept the help the Americans offered. He'd been promised "the best out of the best", and although he didn't trust these men like he trusted the ones he'd picked himself, they seemed to know what they were doing. Mycroft appreciated the fact that none of them had made an attempt to initiate small talk inside the helicopter.
“But to America?” Sherlock asked, incredulous. “What could possibly possess you to spend your vacation there?”
Was a person required to have been missing for twenty-four hours before the police would officially file a missing persons report? If Sherlock's suspicions turned out true, Mary did not have twenty-four hours. In fact, she might not even be alive anymore.
Sherlock said nothing for less than a minute, and then gingerly eased himself closer to John. He knew very well that John enjoyed the ‘cuddling’ after sex, though he was not fond of such himself. Either way, John still seemed to be on Sherlock’s side, as it were. All things considered, their confrontation could have gone far worse. He might as well indulge his assistant for once.
John wanted to ask Sherlock if he believed there to be anything left of Mary to be found, but he was afraid to hear the answer, as Sherlock never skirted around the truth.
He blurrily watched the three mountain man retire to their beds, the leader getting his own while the idiot and psycho shared another. Seemingly in but a few minutes, they had fallen asleep while Sherlock lay on the floor in the dark, wide awake.
He did not want to go back. But they would have to. Fists clenched, Sawtooth roared and turned away, taking his fury out on a nearby counter. Plates and cutlery scattered and crashed under his huge fist. The whore shivered and curled up; a weak attempt at protection from the dispersed shards.
Sherlock made a face that feigned surprise. "Oh! But I thought you fancied outdoor activities! Wasn't it you who said he wanted to get away from "stuffy old London" for a while? I specifically remember your expressing it that way, using those exact words--"
Inside his head, far from the tangible world, Sherlock entered his favourite place in all of his mind palace: a mnemonic representation of 221B Baker Street, accurate down to the smallest detail. It was a relatively new addition to his system, but unlike any of the previous rooms, most of which were created solely for the purpose of storing and categorizing information, Baker Street felt like home. That and John…
She slapped the steering wheel in response to her inattention and, with considerable effort, pushed the image out of her mind. John had been genuinely sorry for breaking her trust and would not do it again. Or so she wanted to believe.
For a moment the two simply stared at each other in a silent challenge. Things had been tense between them ever since their initial disagreement regarding their captive, and the tension was still present, much like an electric charge. Sawtooth cursed his eldest's stubborn nature. He should have known Three-finger would not give up that easily. Perhaps some further use of discipline was indeed required.
Fortunately Three-finger withdrew from the impeding confrontation, eyes downcast, before things had a chance to progress further. One-Eye hesitantly glanced up at his father, not sure if the crisis had been averted or not. He flinched when the patriarch moved, and once again his right hand went instinctively to his face. It was then that Sawtooth noticed the lacerated and grossly swollen state of his son's middle- and index finger, marks very obviously caused by teeth. The scrawny whore had bit One-Eye, and from the looks of it, he had done quite a number on the poor oaf's hand.
"They're flatmates, nothing more, and John Watson has no legal right to information regarding my brother's state of health or the course of treatment chosen for him!" Mycroft growled. He was quickly becoming angry, and felt a rush of heat flowing to his face, most likely making his ginger skin glow bright pink. It was why he, under normal circumstances, preferred to wear makeup during public appearances. Anything, even a subtle change in room temperature, could make him break out into a sweat as well as a furious flush, and a man who was sweating could easily be perceived to be hiding emotional turmoil. While Mycroft had long since learned to control his emotional displays, the same thing could not be said for his bodily functions.
In the beginning of their acquaintance, John learns of Sherlock's unorthodox way of smuggling evidence.
“Take it, whore, take it all,” he moaned. Sherlock leaned forward, tugging his assistant’s cock with him and making John cry out.
The paramedics had obviously decided to quit trying to get any information out of him, because the next thing John noticed was being lifted and placed on a stretcher - one could probably not even work a gurney on ground such as this - and carried toward the helicopter. The deafening sound of the rotors slicing through the air filled his ears, and for a moment John imagined the paramedics throwing him against the rotor blades and laughing as parts of his dismembered corpse were strewn about.
He was ambivalent - as he often had been in the ways of the Americans - about his trust in the medical system of this shoddy area. On the one hand, he surmised he would not be shocked at any mistakes by the staff, but on the other, he hoped that they would be at least be bloody professional about it.
"I'm not in the mood to talk," Sherlock said, his tone unreadable. John was uncertain whether his partner was busy thinking of more ways to escape their dilemma, or if he was truly worse off than he seemed.
John did not smile at the remark. At present time, he doubted the connection between himself and Mary was at all salvageable. The problem was, he loved both Mary and Sherlock, and he did not want to let either of them go, but almost immediately he realized how stupid and selfish he sounded. Mary did not seem the type to be anything but monogamous, and John was almost certain he was quite the same way. But he knew he had to grow some stones and decide who he truly wanted to be with: someone kind, patient and reliable, or someone who was not only a good lay, but a good friend.
Once the water had done its job to alleviate the pain, Sherlock withdrew his hand and gingerly picked up the mug of tea which had survived the havoc. He did not reward John with as much as a glance in passing. The soft swish of silk as Sherlock padded back to his room was the only sound that could be heard.
The nurse had left, but Mycroft had no doubt she would notify her superiors despite his urgent request not to. An American hospital could not afford being sued for malpractice, and the woman clearly valued her job enough not to risk such serious repercussions.
Mycroft spoke again, likely asking another question, but Sherlock, now fighting consciousness, was unable to make sense of the words. Everything sounded like a garbled mess, and it took all of the injured detective's effort not to zone out and retreat - possibly forever - into a secure little corner of his mind palace, where the evils of the world were unable to reach him.
"Calm down, Sherlock," he commanded, using his most authoritative tone of voice. It was the voice normally reserved for troublesome subordinates or difficult younger brothers.
"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is this way, sir," Nasim said, opening the door to a room with the number 462. A wad of paper which he presumed to be Sherlock's surgical journal was in a slot on the wall next to the door.
"I swear it was nothing I did to him," John insisted, flustered yet trying to keep his voice down. " I wasn't even planning on shagging him! He wasn't even supposed to come with us. And then suddenly he's initiating sex between us the moment Mary's gone."
“You’re the one who said that it was bad idea to even go into West Virginia,” John said, brow knit. “And now you have us headed to a town that likely has no electricity. Or more than five teeth, collectively.”
"Maybe she took a wrong turn," Sherlock suggested. "I knew I should have drawn her a map even she could read," he then added with a slight tone of regret.
Sherlock lay limp in the grasp of the huge oafish man-child, trying to force his senses to shut down and his mind to block out the vileness of his keeper. The creature's thick, muscular arms were wrapped around him so tightly that he could barely breathe, and the thing pressed his face against Sherlock's neck, nuzzling the short, curly strands of hair on his nape and inhaling the scent of his terror. At least the one-eyed degenerate had stopped tugging on the chain to the bear trap, which was still very much attached to the unfortunate detective's limb.
And so, apparently, was the skinny little psycho. Snarling like an predator protecting its kill, it exposed its inflamed, swollen gums and crooked, mismatched teeth and hissed at the larger mountain man. The knife remained poised at Sherlock's throat, scraping at the outmost layer of skin but not yet drawing blood.
Sherlock's shock and dismay presented a second opportunity for the skinny madman to shove another forkful of human meat into his mouth. This time the detective swallowed on his own, no coercion required from the giant alpha.
“I know,” John replied, taking one hand away and simply rubbing at the bridge of his nose. “I just… I figured I would be over it by now.”
"Well, he's still stable, all of his vital signs are very good," the doctor replied. "There was even a moment of consciousness..."
The detective nodded mutely. He was still subdued, maybe even downcast, when compared to his usual hypo-manic self, but at least he had come out of his room and willingly talked with John. It was progress.
"Gesture of good will, remember?" the detective replied. "Blending in with the natives as before and keeping their trust."
The little wretch could take it. He had brought it upon himself by defying Sawtooth, so it was only fair that he should suffer for a while.
