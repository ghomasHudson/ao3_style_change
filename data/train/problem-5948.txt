It doesn’t matter. Not now. It shouldn’t matter, and yet, here he is, hesitating over a simple implication, not even a confirmation of his suspicions. It means nothing.
So he might be bleeding.
Rhodey and Bruce watch him quietly, their mouths twisting in uncertainty, and Tony can’t stand to be here and watch them agonize over it when the roar of emotions and adrenaline are wreaking havoc inside his bruised ribs, with the scorching fire of vengeance and the wallow of hurt crying in echoes inside his mind, when he should be

“I’ll retire.” He says, hopelessly, interrupting even though she asked him not to – but the worlds keep bubbling in this tongue, pushing forward desperately as if they could make any difference if he said them faster, like he could cut her train of thought before it reached the dreadful, heartbreaking conclusion that awaited at the end. “After this. I’ll be done. For good. I will never use the suit again.”
It’s meticulous work. With Tony, everything is.
“Sure.” Tony replies, a little dazed.

Tony knows he is not nearly as wise as Thor is, for all the times Thor sounds like he’s too innocent, or too aloof, or too… something; There has always been a quiet, silent sort of intelligence to him, something that went unnoticed beneath the impressive image and power he had, but present anyway, and now, with his dual colored eyes, scars, and somber look – he uses that wisdom on his sleeve, much closer to reach, somehow gentler and harsher at the same time, a frightening power in and of itself.

Tony had almost forgotten what it’s like, to have Bruce around. He missed terribly. Bruce is such a good man, a brilliant mind who has been dealt a tough hand, with the lines on where he refuses to be diminished and where he refuses to be uplifted so tangled together it looks like a mess of exposed wires, that has to be dealt with calmly, with ease and respect, or else it falls apart.

At first, the idea makes Steve feel kind of bad, because it implies that Tony really was detaching himself from the others at first because of him; But then, Steve sees Tony and Clint trading jokes over breakfast and bonding over their love for action movies, he sees Tony coming up to the movie sessions more often with Bruce, he even sees Tony sharing ice cream with Thor once. Steve likes it.

“Cap?” it’s the first thing he hears, in an urgent tone.
The silence that falls upon them is oppressing.
Normally, they could send in medical – but what medical? Who? There’s no one to call. The closest agent is Cameron Klein, the one who sent the distress signal; but who knows what his qualifications are. Does he have anyone with him who could help, any sort of medical aid? They don’t know. They have first aid kits here, the man on the floor assures them. They all know first aid, they bandaged the woman’s leg all by themselves, he points out. But that’s not enough, and they all know this.

And he left her here. Alone. Thinking he was dead.
“They were sent back to the US. They were keeping them in Cuba.”
Steve wants to say he didn’t see this coming, but he did. He’s not angry. He knew it was going to happen. He only wishes it wasn’t necessary.
“And now you can come stay with me and make some explosions.” Stark joyfully says, clapping Doctor Banner on the back, as if exploding things is his idea of a fun time. “Everybody wins. What about you, Point Break?”
“Agreed.” Clint adds in, and, well, it’s not like Tony can disagree with that idea.
Thor nods slowly. “As soon as the sun rises, I will go to the forge and ask for his help. Stormbreaker can travel through the Realms as fast as the Bifrost could. If Eitri is still there, he should be able to aid us in building another Infinity Gauntlet.”
There’s security and cleaning staff, and some family members – a few of them thought it would be smarter, understandably, to hide in one of the most secure buildings in the world instead of their own houses. Tony can see the logic in it. It’s also easier to sneak into the building when there’s no lights, no security system, no rules. But it’s easier, his mind reminds him, for both refugees and rioters alike.

He hadn’t noticed how much, before. Maybe because he was trying not to notice it. Maybe it was all finally catching up to him, slowly but surely, every time he allowed himself a moment of quiet and a wander of thought. Maybe this is him finally coming down from the adrenaline high and feeling the throb of his bruises and the stinging of his cuts every time he moves, finally taking in the full extent of his wounds after the fight.
He guesses it only makes sense. He’s been feeling much more exposed these last few months, and feeling exposed had always made him feel cautious. It also made him feel anxious, defensive and ready to fight, but he can barely find within himself the will to push himself into an argument just for the sake of it, even if there’s still a huge elephant in the room whenever he and Natasha are alone somewhere. Their friendship is slowly making its way to what it was before— he always knew he can count on her on the field, but now, he’s been counting on her with his heart too, trusting her to listen to him when they share a peaceful moment and Steve admits under his breath that he’s
“Yes, we were.” Natasha agrees, and her tone is not at all friendly.

We'll go back to some plot next time! As we step a little further into this journey, we'll need some clever minds to aid Tony in his plan to find and defeat Thanos - a genius is always great, but hell, two, three, maybe four, is even better than one, don't you think? ;) So we will start discussing them, in the next chapter! I hope you're excited for it! The MCU has given us so much information they never used, I can't wait to put it all into action for you guys. It's going to be very fun!

All the practice dummies are scorched black and without heads, some of them falling from the supporting beams completely, and the entire back wall is dirty with soot and piled with rubble and scrap metal. At certain angles, Steve can even see the dents his shield left, and there’s a hole about the size of a football in the second lane, where Tony’s repulsor managed to blast through, despite the entire building being reinforced.

“You don’t know either.”
“Did anyone come for me?” Tony asks breathlessly, hoping Nebula can’t feel the way his heart jumps inside his ribcage the same way he can, loud beats against the bone, like a fist pounding against his sternum trying to break him from the inside out. “Did anyone recognize me? Anyone?”
“It is.” She admits, in a low whisper.

“FRIDAY is almost there.” Tony affirms with full confidence, even though he’s not sure if that’s actually true. “Just hold on. She’ll be right there.”
“The point is that even if it’s too late to stop Thanos from snapping his fingers, if the Stones were worried enough to send us a message, they might have left us clues on how to destroy him.” Thor conjectures.
The thought makes him freeze where he stands.
He hopes so, at least.
A burst of pain jolts him back awake, a hot, stinging sensation at his left cheek, not enough to hurt all the way to his teeth and jaw, but more than enough to make him startle and open his eyes.

He hadn’t even been strong enough to do that, despite how obsessively he thought about it every single second during their journey.
Jarvis knew Howard Stark for many years, trusted him, fought with him, lied for him. Such a partnership doesn’t come without intimate knowledge of one another. As much as work was the main reason they interacted, Jarvis had lived in his home, met his wife and son, played a role in his life. And so, he knew. He knew when Howard crossed the line between wary and paranoid, between interested and obsessed; and that line had definitely been crossed with Tony, even if Howard tried to hide it.

“You said the Stones have a mind. A collective mind of their own.

And because it feels right, he doesn’t know why, but it does— he reaches out and holds her hand, just as she does the same and holds him back, and they stay like that for a moment; Both of them enveloped in a fragile silence, holding onto each other like a lifeline,
“If they won’t listen to us, maybe they’ll listen to the President.” Cap reasons, even though he doesn’t sound very sure about it either.
First of all, I want to remind you that this fic won't be Avengers: Endgame compliant. You can tell by the way it started. But not only that - just with the trailer I can already see many problems I'm gonna have with the plot of the movie, despite being very excited for it. I can already spot the inconsistencies. So, trailer or no trailer, the course of this work has not changed. And let me tell you - if my theory of what is going to happen in that movie is correct, this fic might actually be harder on Tony than the movie will be. You can't imagine how that realization makes me feel.

That’s true. But why would he miss the chance to tease Steve, anyway?
So he has to use his words alone.
“Can’t we?” Tony miserably asks, even though the words don’t have any strength or actual confidence to them. “We have a wedding scheduled already. We could…”

of surprise, and old pain of being pushed away and treated like something other, something that does not belong and must be feared, even if he wasn’t turning green.
“We’re gonna leave you with it and we’re gonna let the agents know you’re here, if you decide to leave, you call them, and you let them know. Or if you need anything, let them know.”
Tony looks up, eyes stinging with unshed tears, breath heaving and heart beating fast, and he feels like the world is crushing him, swallowing him whole, like the vast universe had been, in silence, predatory, with no mercy. The sunlight stretches thin, going out like a flickering candle behind a curtain, obscured by the heavy clouds that slither closer and closer with promises of rain, with the smell of sulfur and ozone, cold wind whistling loud in his ears.

Tony shouldn’t fear the fact that they are leaving, if they’re coming back.

Steve has made a promise. He promised he would try.
But Bucky seems distracted. He sounds distant and he sounds anesthetized, and Steve wants to punch himself for doing this to him. “Yeah, sure.” He says, in a breathy tone, before lowly muttering, “Bye, Steve.”
Tony trusts him. Tony trusts him with this, with Gamma radiation, with all of it – even if Bruce won’t believe him right now.

On any other day, this hangar would be bustling with energy, people running around helping to load the cargo into the transport, people going over weather forecasts and final briefings – but it’s just them now. Them, running like baby chicks all over the place, desperate and vulnerable, fighting to remain strong despite being completely hopeless. Tony hears the muttered curse Rocket exhales, he hears the tremble in Natasha’s breath intake, he knows the rush in Rhodey’s steps is not just from the anxiety. The cold has caught them all off guard. By unspoken agreement, pride or efficiency, by fear or whatever it might be, they don’t talk about it, and hurry to meet the others inside, shivering in silence, skin breaking into goosebumps and teeth clattering between locked jaws, limbs stiff like a stone.
(It’s a promise he keeps breaking.)
“Are you close to the gates, by any chance?”
“I assure you all I have no intentions of causing you distress.” Vision assures them, after a moment. “I am not here as an enemy. I am here as a friend— if I may still be considered that by you.”
“No.” Steve exhales, a little nervous, before he realizes that is absolutely ridiculous and he came here with a purpose, so he might as well say it. “I brought you more coffee.”
Not about this.
His comm is ringing. It’s on top of the table, and Steve has to get up and reach for it with his trembling fingers, and the feel of the cold hardwood floor beneath his feet is enough to make him shiver, from head to toe.

Howard tells her Tony has the ability to learn. Something about pattern recognition and automatic protocol input, big words and technical jargon he knows Maria couldn’t care less about. The technicalities are irrelevant to her. But the idea that Tony can learn like a normal child would is brilliant, exciting really, and Maria takes time to sit down in front of the computer and explore the possibilities of interaction Howard has set up for her, just like any other mother would, eager to see what her son has learned during the time they were apart.

“I need you to believe me, Tony. This is not your fault. I just think we need this. Both of us.”
“I can’t wait.” Steve says, almost in a sigh - and there’s something dreamy about it, hearing his voice through a call; Maybe it’s just because Tony misses him, or maybe because he’s just too old and too soft and too… too goddamned in love, but there’s something about
Right now, they have no time.
The lounge is cold, the lights sterile and clinical, and they are scattered in various states of disarray, their conviction dying a slow, miserable death inside the cabin of the Jet, so the only thing they drag back inside the Compound walls with them is their wounded pride, nothing else. Tony has retreated his armor, Rhodey stepped out of his suit, and all of the others who had weapons on them had put them away with unbridled shame – The last Tony remembers sharing a moment like this with others was during

Every time she thinks it’ll be the last, and it never is. Every time, he says he’ll stop, but he never does.

“You were safe.” Nebula says, misinterpreting his sudden tense posture and raised shoulders as concern; And her words are not a comfort, but it’s
“I’d rather not.” Barton hisses, but lacking any real heat. “And if Thanos was the one who sent Loki, why would he give him an Infinity Stone? Even if it was inside the scepter? Doesn’t that seem weird, to just hand over one of the strongest weapons in your arsenal to a guy you don’t even know if he can do the job?”
And Tony knows there’s nothing Pepper fears the most than a tragedy she can’t fix or escape.
We're getting real, folks. These characters have been very hesitant to talk about certain things up until now - understandable, knowing how much they're hurting and how the last impression they have of each other is definitely not a good one, but that also means one other thing: there is a lot of rage and a lot of hurt hiding in there that they're holding back. That won't do. We need them to be honest, for once in their lives, because lies and omissions are exactly the things that brought them here in the first place. So now they have no choice. I will beat the truth out of them even if it seems harsh, you know why? Because they owe that to us.
“Simulation dummy. I needed someone to box with after Pepper stole Happy from me.”
“That’s why his suit is still private property?” Steve asks, for confirmation.
“Okay, so the first thing is finding safehouses.” He reaffirms. “What sort of place would be a safe place in a time like this?”
“They said it would take time to heal.” Nebula comments, and Tony is confused for a fraction of a second until he realizes she means the
They are all so out of touch with what means to have normal reactions or a normal life. What was he expecting other than awkward, heavy, stifling silence, with the history between them?
The others start talking again, almost hysterically, raising questions and concerns, but Tony can’t make a single word out of the cacophony of it all, the sound of blood rushing through his ears too loud and too overbearing. He sways back, honestly a little relieved – relieved, because he won’t be totally alone,

Tony feels too awkward to step closer and offer her comfort, but he’s sort of glad to see her and Rocket press close to one another, to seek support.

Or maybe not, but

Thor’s earnest, honest stare is unyielding, depths of secrets so alien Tony can not even hope to unravel just by looking, a burning flame of hope and trust still living bright inside him despite all the tragedy that seems to follow him – them – like stains that refuse to be washed away. Blood and blood and blood, and yet, Thor’s faith is still as sharp and alive as he is, thriving where Tony honestly didn’t think it would ever be possible to do. Tony doesn’t know how to deal with this kind of hope. A few days ago, he would have welcomed it, like he welcomed Thor’s rage and desire for revenge, to pull the others into Tony’s outrageous plan to take back what Thanos has stolen from them—
Suddenly, Steve can no longer let this go on.

Tony frowns. “What do you mean? Still?”
Tony doesn’t know if they’re afraid of what he’ll say, or of what he’ll do.
Maybe they were close. Maybe they weren’t. He doesn’t dare to hope for one or the other.
“Yes, animals and plants too, I’ve heard about it. FRIDAY filled me in.” Tony interrupts, feeling a little breathless. “How did
“It looks hard.” Steve naively says. “I mean, I never tried it.”
If Tony had wanted any proof that Nebula wasn’t lying about still having people around, there was no crueler way to give it to him than this. But there it is – there’s his
Steve closes his eyes, wishing he could make it stop. Wishing he could make this right. But he can’t, he doesn’t know how.
Bruce stares and stares, like he did to Rhodey, like he’s trying to find the lie; and Tony gives him a tight, but sincere smile, big and wide, so intentionally mischievous he can feel the way it stretches his cheeks and it squints his eyes a bit, and he pretends he doesn’t know he looks like a bad influence or a hazard to Bruce’s health.
Steve’s nice. Steve’s… different.
“Yeah.” Tony replies in a choked mutter. “I will. You too, Pep, okay? I’ll see you later.”
He can see it in his mind’s eye, how it was. How this happened. This plane came crashing down, on the middle of the day, when no one was expecting it, and it crashed on the street. The people working on the buildings to the left were probably busy, having lunch, handing in reports, just trying to make an honest living. Or maybe – maybe this was a residential area. Tony doesn’t know. He can’t see enough of the street to know. The air is filled with gray. They might’ve been residential buildings, those people might’ve been families, safe inside their homes, until something from above came and

“We were arrogant, and we were reckless, and now everyone is paying the price for it – but I have
He is still feeling like his eyes are trying to stay glued together as he walks towards the kitchen to grab some food, a little sore and gross from the feeling of crying himself to sleep, when he walks into the common area, still drowsy and completely unprepared, and finds, of all people—
No one answers his question. They all throw cautious glances at one another, as if they are too afraid – or maybe, they are wondering if he has finally lost his mind.
He can’t muster the strength to be concerned about something so unthreatening as Nebula. The only thing filling his thoughts is Pepper’s warmth – and beneath it, the looming memory of a fist, of six bright stones, and an enemy far too powerful for him to beat.
“Do you think you will ever sign them?” Bucky asks, and Steve is glad that he opted for an audio call tonight, not a video one, because he doesn’t know what his face looks like when Bucky asks him that. His voice is apprehensive, almost regretful, and Steve feels guilty enough without seeing the proof of Bucky’s hesitation in his face.
He doesn’t know yet how can he possibly fix this, but he’ll think of something. He always does.
, he is
He thinks of Pepper, despairing on a rooftop, telling him she’ll quit because every moment with him feels like dog years. He thinks of her quitting because she sees the bullet holes in his armor and can’t stand the idea that he’ll die for it. He thinks of her quitting when his nightmares woke her up and his armor threatened her for trying to keep him safe, like it had a life of its own, like Iron Man itself had been trying to stop her from stopping Tony.
It's like his bones are made of cheap plastic. How ironic, he thinks, as Nebula’s metal hand closes itself around his bruised forearm, and the pressure on the giant bruise there makes him flinch, just a little bit.
Tony rears back from his hunched position, reeling from the revelation. “I didn’t know you had a sister.”
“I was looking for answers on how to defeat Ultron. Though we defeated him together, you were the only one I saw.”
Like pinned butterflies, so still that they look like plastic. Like a world that moved on, that has forgotten them, that is no longer buzzing with the need of having closure for their conflict, because their conflict is no longer relevant to them.
And now he’s here.

, not to permanently injure or kill any of these people, no matter how hard they are trying to hurt them. Thor swings his axe with expert precision, and Tony would scream in horror if he didn’t know the guy is skilled enough to make the thing move in just the right way and just enough strength that it won’t accidentally murder anyone. And sure enough – a few people panic, and retreat as soon as they see a large, sharp projectile flying in their direction, which is smart, but others, who are not quite so smart or not coherent enough to do anything other than charge towards the House at max speed, those get a heavy handful of wooden handle hit their legs, or the blunt, solid side of a blade, pushing them over to the floor just painfully so they won’t be tempted to get back up. Tony has his non-lethal propulsors. He fires them at their lowest setting, and even so, people are thrown into the air lightly and topple over, also a good incentive to not get back up; But the bastards are

“It’s alright, I offered!” Stark replies, as if it is

(This is not how it’s supposed to go.)
Thor is the one who gives him the chance to act. Enraged, Thor descends from the sky and tackles the man with the guy with all his force, something that would be worrying if Tony could find within himself a single shred of care, ripping the gun from his hands and pushing him to the floor with all his weight – and before Tony can think much of it, he pushes his helmet back from his face and turns around, even if leaves him exposed, and jumps over the car, already looking around like a maniac in search for Cap, fearing that something bad might have happened to him and he had completely missed it through the sparse words said on comms.
“What about Time?” Nebula asks, in an almost demanding tone. “Where does it fit into all of this?”
“Those are Cap’s.” Tony points out, so shocked he’s not even mad.
Long gone are the days where he would jolt in surprise when that happened; at this point, he knows it’s not the flip phone. Never mind they have different ringtones, at first, he always assumed – he always
