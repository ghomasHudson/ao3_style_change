? Dean jumped up in surprise. He watched as the prince strode over to Baron Invidus. As he desperately wanted to know what was going on, he quickly followed and heard Castiel growl out at the ugly alpha, “If both of your men challenge me, I will kill them, Lord Zachariah.”
Dean never stopped the movement of his body. After so many years the dance became second nature. He let his eyes roam all over Cas' face and chest. His soulmate was fucking gorgeous and was apparently enjoying looking at Dean as well. He could feel the Omega's hard-on underneath him since he had moved up closer to his body. Dean made sure that on every other thrust of his body his chest bumped against Cas'. He wanted to place his hand over his heart so desperately, but not in front of an audience. It was a private moment that Dean had dreamt of for years.
“Gabriel.” He forced him to let go so he could hug his brother. “I promise you, I am happy. Please take good care of Emmie. Also, until I find out more, I need you to make sure that John Winchester stays far away from her and from you.”
Just before he crossed the threshold, Dean turned his face back to his former alpha and stuck out his tongue.
"Dean, that smells amazing. I can't believe how starved I am after that huge meal I ate last night." Dean snorted at thinking about other
As soon as the word was out of his mouth, Dean stepped back but continued to hold Cas’ hands. He started to smell worry coming off him.
Charlie was actually afraid of the threat in her friend’s voice, but continued. “Dean, it’s not that bad, so calm down and let me finish.”
He made a strangled sound when Dean's hands surrounded his cock. As he threw his hands back to support himself on the alpha’s legs, his hips thrusted his cock into each stroke of Dean’s hand.
He held Cas still with his free hand settled on the lower part of the omega's back. As soon as he felt Dean’s finger teasing him, Cas had tried to push down on it and Dean needed to tease him a bit first. When his mate threw his head back in want and need, the alpha leaned forward to run his nose along the clavicle that had been tempting him all day. When he followed the same path with his tongue Cas let out a guttural sound that made his canines drop in need to be inside his mate. It took everything he had to control his inner alpha that simply wanted to flip Cas on his back and thrust his cock into the tight, hot heat he could feel with the tip of his finger. He managed, barely, because he
He had searched forever to find something to tell his parents because his mom would check. She was more protective and nosey than his dad. She had good intentions, she just didn't believe that there was anything off limits for her to ask. He was embarrassed many times as a kid with her asking people how they met their soulmate and how it felt when they laid their hands on their hearts.
), but knowing and doing were completely different. Right now, he was relying on his instincts. Dean wanted to make this as good for Cas as he could. Taking a deep breath, he stared into those bottomless blue eyes, and listened to his gut for his next move.
Dean thought his friends were never going to let him go, damn them. He was wiped down, changed, with his bag packed to leave, when Benny stopped him again.
He looked around at all the other alphas and their handlers around the room. Dean was ready to go in the hall where his mate was, oh, yeah he was. He had been anxious all day, but especially since Sammy had told him that his omega had some worries. He was determined to make sure that no matter what was wrong, he was going to help his mate.
Dean could smell the nervousness coming from his mate and he did not like it! He threaded their fingers together and gave them a reassuring squeeze.
"An Alpha? Really, Cassie. I thought you would find a mild Beta more compatible with your bookish ways."
He couldn’t think of anything but Dean, so it only took a few strokes before he came all over the bed, again. Time to clean up and take another blanket off the bed.
He got a bit distracted by the gorgeous wings that were shimmering and all puffed up to protect Cas and to intimidate Alistair. The glorious white with green shimmers at the bottoms and a hint of black at the quills had him staring from the moment he had spotted his alpha, but the way they looked now just blew Cas’ mind.
The next room he came upon was a small bathroom, or, what they call a half-bath. Opening the door on the other side of the bathroom, it led him to the kitchen. It was small and cheery, a place Cas could envision having morning coffee with his mate, or with family meals around the small, round table (that looked hand-made!), and he loved that there was a half-wall which allowed him to see into the living room while he was in the kitchen.
“Oh, yes!” He bounced on the other’s lap. “I was going to order us some burgers, fries, and beer, after I had washed up a bit. Sound good?”
He was so lost in the flavors exploding in his mouth that he didn’t quite realize that Cas had had enough. One second, he’s tongue deep in his omega, and the next Cas had flipped over and Dean was face-planting on his mate’s hard cock. Huh. It was a very pretty cock, so he did what came naturally, and swallowed him down until his nose was buried in the dark hair at the base.
Cas found himself nodding before Mary had finished speaking. When Dean tossed Emmie in the air (really only a few inches) he felt his heart fall until she just floated over to land in the arms he had opened to catch her. She gave a hearty giggle, so very proud of herself.
He pulled the curtain back an inch to take a look into the club. The crowd was still pumped but thinned out just a bit. Maybe it would cool off a bit now. Just as he was letting go of the curtain he caught a whiff of cinnamon and caramel. The Omega was here! He would know that scent anywhere. He had lived with it burned in his memory for years. Dean was old enough now that he knew his soulmate was out there. He had to find him. Just then the DJ called to him asking what song to play.
Dean caught his shoulders and drew him close to his torso. He licked up Cas' ear and whispered, “Please, what, Sweetheart? Do you want me to fuck you?”
“Dean, of course I am. Cas is family, man. I’ve known for a long time that you felt so much more for him than just as a ‘brother’. I’m just glad that you’re gonna do what your heart wants, Dean. Seriously.”
"Let it be known and recorded that on this day to Dean and Cas (Michael looked at Cas to wink letting him know that he was respecting his wish to not be called Castiel) Winchester that Colton Jack has been born." There was no stopping the tears as Dean heard all the angels in Heaven giving thanks for his son, CJ. They had decided on his name and nickname sometime ago, but had kept it a secret until his birth.
Gabe stepped away with Emmie, singing a good morning song to her and Dean turned towards his brother. Sam was watching Gabe with such longing that it made Dean's heart ache for him.
“Grammie, that’s what I used to call my grandmother, if that’s alright.” Somehow he wasn’t surprised that his mate got his shyness from his mother too.
Dean nodded. “Yes, Sir, I—” He paused for a moment and sniffed, then whipped his head around and focused on a group of alphas.
When he was completely naked, he sat down on the bed propping his back on some pillows against the headboard before holding his hand out for Cas to join him. He smiled gently at him when he could smell how nervous his was. He helped his omega get on the bed so that he was straddling Dean, sitting on his thighs with their chests touching on each inhale. He liked having him so close, because could see the many different shades of blue that made up his gorgeous and bashful eyes.
"Alright, Blondie-Girl, plums it is! Let's go change this diaper first, since it can't feel very good on your tushy." He walked upstairs with Emmie's tummy on his shoulder making airplane noises. She loved it. They were just about to her nursery when Cas opened their bedroom looking like he was still exhausted.
"Hold on Blondie-Girl, hold on." Dean helped her sit down on Cas' lap before she ended up face first in Cas' french toast with blueberry maple syrup.
Waiting til he heard the shower start, Cas then went to pour himself another cup of coffee before starting on the frittata.
"Brudders are the best." He bumped shoulders with Sam, acknowledging his agreement with the sentiment.
He stood up and shoved his boxer-briefs down his legs and stepped out of them. There was no way he was going to be able to chase Cas in this underwear. If he wasn’t as hard as a rock, he might've been fine, but they were already a size too small (they were his back-up pair after all).
The alpha watched his mom standing by the cherry trees, blushing, as Bobby stood there continuing his courtship of the blonde omega. He snickered, remembering when the pair sat down with him, Cas, Sammy, and Gabe to ask for their blessings for Bobby to begin courting her. Mary had done most of the talking as the older alpha sat next to her on the couch, strangling the ball cap he had barely remembered to take off when they walked into Dean's house. Cas had given Bobby the
Since his hands were buried in Dean’s wings (who gave them permission to do that?!?) he could tell when his alpha scented his arousal, he could feel feathers caressing his arms and legs. It was instinctual to his Angel to protect him as well as to react to his mate’s needs (even when he was obviously unaware of what he was doing since he was fully focused on the piece of trash that was still spewing hatred towards him). How hot was that: even his mate's unconscious wanted him.
Cas was sniffing the air letting Bal guide him through the tables. His eyes were roaming over the club wanting to find him. He heard his brother order a bottle of champagne from the waiter that was there before they could sit down.
He had thought it was intense when Dean claimed him, but the thought that everyone (especially those who had watched him dance) would know that Dean belonged to him…Oh, crap! That was fucking hot.
Every heat he went through Cas dreamt of the Alpha: what he would look like, how he would take care of his mate during his heat. He came many times screaming out 'Alpha!', and it was that Alpha he thought of.
Dean looked longingly back at the gardens. He whispered, “Thank you, Charlie,” and thought maybe she knew it was more than just a polite reply.
Green eyes got lost in blue. The heavenly aroma of Cas' slick hit his nose, then it soaked his legs. Dear Chuck, he didn’t think his cock had ever been harder in his life! He needed to be buried in his mate now (and his inner alpha agreed if the rumbles from his chest were anything to go by).
Despite the fact that most or all of them would be in (or at least near) a violent brawl, every single alpha was dressed as if they were going visiting in Society. Castiel was the only one dressed casually, because even if he didn't plan on competing for a mate today, most fights got bloody, and damned if he wasn’t ruining any of his good clothes just because he had to host this ridiculous shindig.
Cas yipped when he found himself being manhandled again. Holy batcrap, that was hot! In an instant, Cas was on all fours with Dean’s cock very close to his face and Dean’s tongue buried in his ass.
Stopping on a dime, he turned and went from a jog to a run, now that he knew which way to go. He saw a flash of a naked butt going around the curve of the hallway, making him flat out run after his omega. He flung himself around the corner and slammed into the wall. While he was ‘son of a bitch’ing at himself, he heard Cas giggle, moving away from him. Barking out a laugh, he pushed off of the wall and rushed after his mate.
Cas poured another glass of champagne for himself. He was horny, hard, wet, and he wanted to be under his alpha, now! Just as he stood to go get Dean, he saw him come out from backstage. Damn. He looked so hot. The alpha had on light-blue jeans with a snug, turquoise henley. Fuck, Cas wanted to climb him like a set of monkey bars.
After finishing his morning business and a cursory wash, Dean came around the corner where the servant continued her duties. The omega was dressed into his traveling clothes: loose, soft, brown trousers with a billowy, cream-colored blouse, heavily embroidered with colorful vines and flowers around the collar and wrists. Dean was proud of his needlework. The young man loved to work on the intricate designs for all of his clothing.
"Here he is Emmie, here's your Daddy." Gabe was trying to calm her, as she had cried so hard she was now hiccupping.
Dean stopped just inside the door with his eyes on his feet. This was the hardest part for him: not being able to look for his omega. He wasn’t allowed to raise his eyes unless his omega stopped him. They had only just started when Dean heard a whimper from his omega, causing his inner alpha to issue a welcoming growl. Sam then pushed him on to begin walking down the aisle between the lines of omegas.
“Very well, Sam. I am Castiel and the idiot sitting on the floor eating candy is my older, stubborn assbutt of a brother, Gabriel.”
“We just gotta change then we’ll hit the road. It's about twenty-eight hours if we just trade off without stopping. Is that...is Cas crying?”
The one Dean had just dodged, turned quickly, just in time to see the other drop dead, which caused him to roar and charge. The green-eyed alpha dropped to the ground and swept his legs at the approaching alpha. As he fell towards Dean, his alpha punched him in the throat before twisting his neck, killing him as easily as the first.
But the claimed omegas rarely objected, either. Watching alphas fight for the right to mate them was biologically exciting, and the smell of their pheromones and arousal brought them to a state that almost felt like heat. At the end of a claim fight, the winner would take one look at their “prize,” and most omegas instinctively ran. The alpha would give chase and immediately mate the omega wherever they were caught. Most matings were downright messy.
He took his shirt off (actually, it belonged to Dean) and took a second to rub the Zepplin design across his ass to get some of his slick on it (hey, all’s fair…), then he dropped it at the bottom of the stairs. After kissing Charlie goodbye and telling her of his plans, he ran down the hallway past Dean’s room and stopped to drop his (also Dean’s) boxers at the end of the hallway. Cas knew that his scent, as well as the scents of his slick and come, was all one could smell in that bedroom. He just wanted to make sure that his alpha followed him around the bunker before finding him.
Cas couldn’t take his eyes off that cock. It was larger than any he had ever seen (yes, he watched porn) and it had made him feel so full and he craved more of it. His heat was ramping up and he needed more.
Dean was a bit thirsty and the intense stare of Cas’s brother was actually a bit unnerving. He grabbed Cas’ glass and took a sip.
They were both watching the handfuls of omegas and their guides (all guardians were forbidden from the Meet) walking across the lawn. No one was looking at anyone in the eyes. Steps were taken slowly.
He had known it would be his best friend, Benny, that spoke for them all. He always called Dean out on shit, and that's one reason why they were so close.
“I can’t help it, Cassie. You found your mate!” She had immediately enveloped him in her arms. Not exactly expected, but not totally unwelcome. It was better than getting thrown out or scowled at. Hm. Maybe later, once she got to know him.
Dean jogged back to the stage and after he collected his tips along with a few phone numbers (that he would throw out), he went to go get changed for his last dance. When he got there, he found himself surrounded by the guys. Benny, Michael, Mitch, and Gabe were facing him with their arms crossed over their chests. They were already in their jeans, boots, and hats for the group dance. He started changing, waiting for one of them to tell him what the hell was wrong, although he knew.
"Feeling better?" Poor Cas had been sick for the last week with morning ("it's not just morning, Dean!") sickness.
Dean was sitting on the couch in a bit of shock at how easily Cas’ alpha mother accepted that Cas was moving away. He knew not to believe in generalities, but he had always heard that alpha mothers were hard put to let their pups go. He was waiting for Cas’ omega father to come back. The man had insisted on making them lunch before they left and for once Dean was unsure if he could eat. He had asked his mate (he was mated!) if he wanted help to pack some of his things, but Cas’ mom had insisted it wouldn’t take them long and he got the impression that she wanted a few minutes alone with her son.
"Come on, Sammy, let's go play!" Pulling his sputtering brother along, Dean moved them towards his pup and Sammy's future mate.
There was a lot to keep his mind busy. The estate they had arrived at in the early evening was imposing and impressive. He had never seen such a gigantic dwelling (not that he had much of an opportunity in his childhood), and was in awe of what people could accomplish. As he was escorted through the long halls to his temporary chambers, he had detected the heavenly smell of fresh apples and cinnamon and wondered if the staff had been baking pies for the Meet. Also to his delight, Dean's room faced the back gardens, and it was obvious that the lord of the castle took great care of the grounds. Before the sun had gone down, he had feasted his eyes on a splendid park of flowers, trees, shrubs and picturesque fountains. Perhaps he'd be able to see them up close tomorrow. With that lovely thought, he drifted to sleep.
As he stripped down and sat in the hot water, he could hear the Angels speaking to each other but he could not place the language. He could feel their eyes on him in a way that wasn't as creepy as it should have been. Cas didn't feel like he did when some random Alpha would leer at him, this was more like a bunch of doctors examining him at once.
Dean glanced over as the thought sunk into Sam’s brain at the same time. These alphas had traveled over a thousand miles to grab Cas. Yeah, that wasn’t happening.
"Gabe, please. I have just a moment left. Hug me before we walk to Alistair's office. I won't give him the satisfaction of seeing our tears."
“I want you, Alpha. Please, mark me as yours. Tell the world that you are my Alpha. Show everyone that I belong to you.”
Dean gasped when he felt his mate’s hand burning on his skin. He watched as the omega’s eyes widened in shock, knowing that Castiel felt the same profound bound connect between them, before they even mated! He could do nothing but kneel before his mate and bare his neck to him. He whimpered as his omega stepped forward into his personal space and pulled Dean into his arms, before kneeling in front of him so he could scent Dean.
The beta squeezed Dean's hand as a goodbye and good luck, curtsied in a bounce, and the omega was alone with the alpha. So to speak.
He slowly thrust his finger in and out of his mate, going a bit deeper each time he thrust in. Pulling Cas closer so that he could feel the omega’s cock rubbing against him with a hand gripped on his ass cheek, Dean added a second finger on the next thrust. He took his time with just the two, slowly spreading them as he worked on him, so that he could stretch Cas enough so he wouldn’t hurt him when they mated. Dean knew that an omega’s body was built to take an alpha cock, but his mom had explained that prep was better for
“Yeah, no sweat. Ha! I mean, he mostly lays in your bedroom and cries, poor dude. I'm getting him some more water and cool rags. Check in later?”
The final picture took Dean’s breath away. Bal was sitting on a couch holding a newborn Cas with a sign next to him that read “Big Brother For Life!”. Cas was the most beautiful pup he had ever seen with those blue eyes dominating his face, a headful of unruly dark hair (somethings didn’t change apparently), and he was squinting up at Bal.
So here he was, in the car with Bal, wishing they were already at the club. After dinner he had enjoyed his hot bath and his orgasms before getting dressed. There was nothing to do for his hair, people had tried for years to tame it. Charlie eventually convinced him to just towel dry it and enjoy the 'sex hair' look and rock it. So, he did.
He was pleased that he had thought to bring his current embroidery project with him to help pass the time. It would keep his mind occupied, and away from sad thoughts, such as leaving his two younger brothers behind. It was a difficult and tearful goodbye the night before, and well away from their father, who wouldn’t have stood for that sort of thing. But Sam and Adam were young, and had sensitive little hearts, still, so Dean did his best to assure them that everything would somehow work out. Even though he knew it was a very real possibility that he might not see either of them again.
“What?!? I didn’t touch him, like ewww. I just imparted some knowledge on how to stroke one out. He uh…"
“I only have three more classes before the year is over. I will talk to my professor and I'm sure he will let me just come back for the final. I'm doing very well in that class. Next year, I will go to school closer to where we live.”
He had lowered his eyes and nodded. “Capice.” Then he looked back up and smiled. “I love you, Omega. Come on, it’s almost time for check out, let’s get dressed and get this over with.”
He resolved not to focus on the parents. Dean would do his very best to charm the pants off of them. “Alright, next. What about your schooling?”
There was no reason for the attraction, not unless Sam had been chosen to mate. An alpha angel couldn’t smell his mate until their original sire granted them the right, and had Blessed the alpha to allow him to be drawn to his mate’s scent.
he could’ve come right then and there. Without a conscious thought Dean began grazing his teeth over the stretched cord in his mate’s neck while growling, earning a whimper and another gush of slick from his mate. His actions made the alpha realize there was something he needed to tell Cas.
was turning him on. Prince Castiel was an incredible sight to behold, and every omega's dream alpha: young, strong and handsome. The scent of omega slick was everywhere in the breeze.
He took one last inhale of the scent before he began jogging down the hall towards the dungeon. His alpha was calling to his omega, and he couldn’t have kept quiet if he tried. Dean had never rumbled before in his life, but as he did, he thought he heard his omega answer him, from the direction he had just come from. Son of a
"Yes, dear. When your Omega picks you, the two of you will wait in line to go before your original sire. You shouldn't have to wait long, since Michael didn't allow many to join the ceremony this time. When you stand before him your Omega will place their mating bite on your collar bone and then you will bite them. They will have already been instructed that your bite and mating with an Alpha angel will change them into a cherub and they will have duties after your offspring have stopped nursing."
“Oh, yeah. Sure. That makes sense, Cas. I’ve seen the news stories about that, too. I just... Well, I'm not exactly thinking straight. I’m surprised you can.”
He watched the two walk off and gave a huff of laughter looking at the differences between his alpha brother, who was close to a giant, and the human omega, who was just short.
“Go to the dungeon, both of you. We’re less than an hour out. They won’t be able to get in, but take some weapons just to be safe. Now!”
Now he could smell tears coming from Cas, who was keeping his eyes on their entwined hands in Dean‘s lap.
“Ohhh...yeah. You were made for my cock, weren’t you, Baby? Hmm...fuckin’-A! I could live buried inside your body. The heat of your slick coating me as you squeeze my cock. Ah, it's never felt like this, Omega. Fuck!”
The lights came on and the music got louder and finally broke out of the loop it was in. Cas could see Dean was wearing tight blue jeans, cowboy boots and hat. Along with his necklace that he had noticed on the Alpha earlier. He couldn't help but trace the tattoo of the yin and yang with his finger, smiling at Dean as the Alphas sat on the chairs, leaving him and the other club goers standing in front of them.
Just as his omega looked up at him, Michael opened his door and motioned to them to follow him. Cas was the first to stand and he pulled Dean up with him. Huh. His omega was definitely not afraid, rather, it seemed that he was eager to speak to Michael again. Dean was thrilled, since most omegas held a fear of Original Sires. Even his mom was a bit reserved around Michael.
“Emmie, come on with Momma and Grammie.” He leaned over to kiss Dean’s cheek before letting their pup try to chew on his chin (her form of a kiss). Dean laughed and refused to wipe the slobber off his chin until Emmie wasn’t watching.
“Hurry.” He couldn’t help the growl that was in his voice. Dean had very little control left of his inner alpha, who wanted nothing more than to have his cock and teeth buried in his omega.
“Cas, Sweetheart, I'm fine, just getting old.” Taking hold of his mate’s hands he pulled them to his lips to press kiss after kiss on them.
"The crowd loved ya', brother. Thanks for getting them all worked up for me. I'll make sure to finish what you started."
“There’s at least five alphas trying to get in the bunker. I have cameras up. I heard them say they followed an omega’s scent.”
Cas just watched Alistair leave. He could see Gabriel shouting and chasing him out the bakery but he couldn't understand what he was saying. He believed he was in shock. He had read of the Angel Sacrifices, everyone had learned about them in history class, he just never expected to see one in his life time let alone being a sacrifice.
Regardless, Lord Winchester continued, “Sir, I merely wish to know why you have brought this…omega…here to me. If he has displeased or offended you in some way, he will be punished and we will take our leave immediately.“
Dean had stepped through the door of the bunker and was almost brought to his knees by his omega’s scent. It was floral, a light breeze of lilacs combined with a delicate hint of honey, but with the heady aroma of heat.
He followed the angel kisses (his dad told him that’s what freckles were) across the alpha’s cheek down to his lips. Holy fuck, his lips! They were delightfully plump, and felt lush on Cas’. Thinking of the way those lips had felt when Dean ate him out made his hips jerk just a bit, making him realize that the alpha’s knot had gone down and he was freed.
“Hannah, I was not eavesdropping, but angels have excellent hearing, so just know that I will spend eternity making Cas and our family happy. We will be back for you to visit, and if you ever need one of us, pray to Michael.”
“He doesn’t know what he needs. He's never...he just presented, Sam. He doesn’t know what he wants ‘cuz he’s in heat.”
“Yeah, sounds good. There's a decent place down the road. Bal and I were laughing at the name of it. The Elephant Butte Hotel just struck me as funny. I better go in and register, though.”
He only wished that he could be there when Castiel would report his claim to Lord John. It wasn't “done" to have the omega there for their obligatory meeting, but it was fun to imagine, anyway. Wonder if his father would think he was still unworthy. Guess it didn't matter, because his mate obviously thought he was.
Cas thought about that for a moment before he answered. He walked over to Emmie’s changing table to give him time. After laying her down, he rubbed his nose against hers. No matter how she came to be, he adored his pup. Huh. Cas took a closer scent of her and discovered that the lingering scent of his attacker was fading and she smelled almost like an apple pie, with the combination of his apple scent and Dean’s ginger and brown sugar.
He was enjoying (probably too much) his alpha’s embarrassment as he realized that was Michael’s intention. Cas turned and smiled at the intimidating, yet sweet, Original Sire of his Mate’s family, now
It took a few minutes for the sets of brothers to say goodbye, especially since her fathers didn’t want to let Emmie go,  but finally Dean told Sam and Gabriel they needed to go, because Cas was beginning to perspire at an alarming rate. His omega was in heat, and it was time for the others to leave!
"Looks like Emmie wants a bath before her milk, so we'll be right back." He paused after rising from the bed when Cas laid his hand on his arm, taking time to swallow his food before speaking.
“No, Omega. My elder brother is, though. I will be the one walking him through the ceremony. May I say, you smell more upset than the other omegas. Michael did explain what was going to happen, yes?”
Cas sat up and leaned on Dean’s chest. He buried his nose into his mate’s neck to calm himself with the scent of home from his alpha. Now that it was over, Cas could feel his body begin to shake. He tried to stop but there was too much bottled up inside him and then the shakes were accompanied by sobs. So much had changed for Cas in just a day, and he was simply overwhelmed. He calmed slightly when Dean’s arms wrapped him up and held him in a cocoon of his wings. Cas felt his alpha placing sweet kisses on his forehead, along his nose, and kissing away the tears running down his face.
“Omega, come on. Let's get in the room, away from the door.” He pulled Cas further into the room as he looked around.
“Yes, he still wants an omega, all right. I know of Lord Zachariah, and I have an idea of what he might be up to.”
Cas was so humiliated. He had never been naked in front of anyone since he came of age and the last one before that was Gabriel when they had to check for ticks after camping on top of nest of them. Ick.
"I have one dance after this. It's a group thing, then I'm done. Will you go get something to eat with me, Cas? So, we can talk?"
Dean sat and was tickled that his omega sat so close to him that they were touching from shoulder to ankle. He never even let go of Dean’s hand. His inner alpha was purring at the show of affection.
He laughed along with Cas, watching as a blush bloomed on the man's face at his own words. Dean knew that others thought he was hot, but he never thought it himself. He just used it to make the money to take care of his brother and to further both their dreams.
"Just another bit and we'll be there. I would ask if you're excited for our night out, but I can smell that you are."
He couldn't help but rub his fingertips over each and every robe. It seemed as if there were robes in every color known to man in this Angel's arms. It seemed impossible til Cas remembered these were Angels.
"Every day with you and our family is perfect, Alpha. The day we met, I was sure I was about to die, but it turned out to be the true beginning my life. I love you." He certainly couldn't resist capturing his mate's lips in a kiss before he began pushing the swing with his foot.
Dean had never been this hard or felt this desperate for anything in his life. He released the hold on his alpha and growled, lips still right next to Cas' ear. The tip of his cock immediately lined up right where it was supposed to, and he began to push. Ready for his alpha, Cas' body opened up and welcomed him in, and Dean sank into the heat of his mate.
As all this was happening, his cock had been slipping around on Cas’s thighs collecting slick. Apparently deciding to move things along, Cas closed his legs with his cock trapped between them. Then the omega squeezed, causing Dean to drop his forehead onto his shoulder, and let out a roar with ecstasy.
They took their time savoring the subtle flavor of honey and peaches. He stood and hugged Balt one last time.
“But...Dean, Alpha, I'm not an angel anymore.” Cas brought his eyes back down and frowned. Dean did not like the way his mate was acting, timid and sad.
"Hey, Blondie-Girl, come here, puppy." He scooped her up from Gabe and sat down next to Sam (who was completely focused on the sleeping boy in his arms) so he could show Emmie her brother.
I also apologize for not being able to answer a lot of my inbox messages, it just isn't working properly.
“Did you do all of this?” The redhead indicated the simple spirals sewn into his blouse. He wore a traditional mating top with a wide neck and large, billowing sleeves that were simply tied at the wrist. It was deep green with multicolored spirals around the collar, loosely tucked into a pair of thin, tan trousers. Those were casually light and simple. Nothing to restrict an alpha from getting to their mate quickly and easily.
He found himself with his arms full of his mate. Dean took just a minute to let them inhale each other’s scent, and then he could feel the last thread of control he had on his inner alpha snap. Reaching down he grabbed Cas under the thighs and lifted him, before he turned and dropped him on the bed hard enough that the omega bounced, causing him to laugh as he looked up at Dean through his lashes.
Lovely, lovely Dean seemed to be as hungry as he was for skin, for his hands had never stopped running over his torso and arms. He had latched on to his own scent gland and vacillated between licking and sucking on it and scenting him.
“Hello, Dean. I want you here so badly.” He hated that he started crying all over again, just from hearing Dean’s voice.
People began arriving in the early afternoon, and his steward took care of all room assignments. Since the prince wasn't particularly interested in meeting with any of them, he let his staff take care of everything. Just because he was forced to host this thing, didn't mean he was required to look for a mate. Castiel retreated to his library and had the servants deliver his supper to him there so he could enjoy his evening in peace.
“That’s what I mean, Babe. I knew as soon as I smelled you years ago that I wanted to have pups with the amazing smelling omega that proved to me I did have a Soulmate, and it’s why I've never been with an omega before, only you, Cas. Only you.” He smiled at his mate then said, “So, whatever you want, Sweetheart. Now, we’re set for furniture, but if there’s anything you want to bring, we will change things at home. I want it to feel like home to you too, alright?” He started folding the shirts that had apparently been dumped on the bed, handing them to his mate to pack.
"Gabriel, the coffee is done. If you get up now breakfast will be done when you get out of the shower."
“Is this how you do it? Do you do it faster, slower, harder? Show me, Omega. Show me how you would jack off, looking at the poster with my body on it.”
His omega turned to him as he said, “Mom, this is Dean Winchester, my Alpha, and my Soulmate. Dean, this is my Mom...Mom! Don’t hug him to death!”
“No, I'm not mad, Angel. I'm glad you told me and I'm so sorry it took this for me to step up and admit how I have felt about you. Years, Cas, we’ve wasted years.” He was surprised to see Cas smile at him.
"Alright, Dean. I'll help but, listen dude, you got this. Michael said you were old enough to start presenting to the Omegas. He believes you are ready to be mated and create new angels. We really need to replenish our numbers after the last war with the demons. Michael, Dad, and the rest of the elders are still trying to find out who supplied them with angel blades."
He walked down the stairs to enter the club heading straight for the bar. He desperately needed something cold to drink. Dean smiled, winked, waved at the women and men that called to him as he walked. He had to avoid a few hands, too, but most of audience was well behaved.
“Omega, do you want to run?” Gods, his voice sounded rough, even to him. He shook with effort of control. There was one last piece of it, and he gave it to his omega.
“I’ll lead you, Dean. I'll squeeze your shoulder when we get close. I know I've given you a hard time about how you’ve been acting and I apologize. I just...I just wish that I was chosen to have a mate, too.”
Hearing his alpha talk about saving the nesting bed for ‘them’ made him swoon. What an amazing man he was blessed with. He stepped around the suitcase on the floor so he could wrap him in a hug. He kept his arms around his neck as Dean spun to face him, looking down into his eyes, a bit sheepishly.
The redheaded and red-cheeked beta that attended him in the morning was named Charlie, and was one of the servants in residence. She regaled him with reports of the Meet preparations, gossip about the other arrivals from yesterday and descriptions of the prince (wow, a prince?) that was master of Novak Castle. Apparently, that was where he was. Nice to know.
A couple of mind-blowing orgasms, a shared shower, and a full breakfast later, they were on the love seat with his head in Cas’ lap and the omega petting Dean’s hair.
Cas wished that Gabriel could keep his feelings to himself. It's not like Cas liked Alistair any better than Gabriel did, after all it happened to his Father too.
“No, Castiel. We will find out after dinner when he sends off all the mates to their...um...to uh...”
As he broke through his skin, Dean could feel himself pulsing deep inside his mate. He was mated! He could taste Cas’ blood,  and revelled in that knowledge. Beneath him, Cas shook and his muscles squeezed his cock again, as he gave another moan. Dean carefully released himself from the bite and licked the wound clean before nudging the omega’s jaw with his nose.
Dean raised up quickly to kiss the doubt he had unwittingly placed on his mate’s face. He never, ever, wanted to make him doubt how much Dean wanted and needed him, and he’ll make sure to show him how happy he is with him for the rest of his life. His alpha whimpered a bit as he pulled out of the kiss to sit up next to Cas. Dean tugged on his hand until he got the hint and moved to straddle his lap.
Bobby had told them his story: while on earth he had been married to Karen, a lovely omega who had died from cancer. They had been reunited when he passed (accidentally shot in the head on a hunting trip) but the omega was only waiting to let him know that she loved him, but she was leaving heaven. If approved, there were instances where souls who were not going to become full-on angels could go on to a resting place. It was a state of suspension of an eternal sleep that was only broken if Heaven were attacked. Karen was so very tired and while it had broken Bobby's heart,  he didn't argue with her, since he wanted his lover to be happy and at peace. She had assured him that she wasn't upset that he had been chosen to be an angel while she hadn't, and she wished him happiness and love before she left.
"I believe they will be. I can't tell you anything officially, but I can tell you that I have Faith that you will be a mated angel by tonight."
“That’s my favorite lip your abusing there, Sweetheart. Yeah, I'd love pups, anytime, but if we were to plan for pups, I’d want to wait til you were out of school and teaching. I don’t ever want to stop your dreams. Do you want pups?”
When he informed his dad, John told him it may take years to meet an Omega, why didn't he find a nice Beta and settle down? Dean was determined not to settle like he believed his mom had. She settled for a Beta instead of waiting to find her soulmate. He always felt a guilt over that since he was the reason she had agreed to marry John, and then they had lost her when he was just four.
“Gabriel?” He had plenty of experience with his brother’s so-called sense of humor, enough to be wary.
He saw Cas wink at him then felt the hand in his hair pushing his head farther down. Hells yeah, he was on board with this! He looked down at the hard cock that was right in front of his face, glanced back up and he licked his lips before bypassing Cas’ hard-on altogether. He wanted the taste of that slick to coat his taste buds again.
Castiel then announced, “Sir, I have claimed Dean Winchester as my mate. You are relieved of your guardianship. I will see that you receive appropriate compensation.”
“Before we go where our instincts and desires are telling us, I just need you to know that I will never let your Father hurt you or our pups, ever,” he promised against Dean’s lips before sliding his tongue in the alpha’s mouth.
Dean walked around the back of the bunker to the outdoor shower he had installed the past spring. After dripping blood, guts, and mystery fluids one too many times after a hunt, he had had enough of scrubbing floors. Sam had told him to go first, since he wanted to wait for Charlie to bring him out some clean clothes.
Thanks for following this story, I'm so in love with these adorable dorks so there is plenty more coming for them but be patient, please.
Sam knew from studying his history that it was quite common for alpha brothers to be Truemates with human, omega siblings. So it’s logical that he could be mates with his brother’s omega’s brother. Sam shook his head at the knots his thoughts had become. He was just going to stop thinking, stand here and watch Gabriel eat candy until it was time to get Dean.
“Sir. Do you see that alpha looking at the table with his hands on his hips? His face is all scrunched and he's got brown, messy hair?”
“Dean, your mother and I will be in the next room for the dinner part of this ceremony. Say your goodbyes now and we shall see you soon.”
“Dean, please look at me.” The omega managed to flick his eyelashes up for two seconds. He’d take the win.
“I want you, Cas. I want to get to know you, your sense of humor, your passions, your fears, your dreams. I want to laugh with you for all our lives, I want to explore everything your heart desires. I want to make you feel safe, and at the same time, help you face your fears and banish them. I want to support you and help you make each and every dream come true.”
he wanted to watch Dean go alpha. He had been in love with the man for years, never thinking he could have anything more than a familial relationship with him, and he had even convinced himself that it was enough.
When Cas walked out of the kitchen to go get ready, Dean grabbed a cooler from the pantry and put inside some drinks and snacks. He knew he could always just make whatever they needed to appear (he was an angel after all) but he and his brother had been raised to do things in more of a human manner by Mary. To be honest, they both preferred to do things that way. Once he had everything they would need for the first few rounds of Cas’ heat, Dean followed his after his mate.
"Let's get you a bottle and we'll go outside and see Michael's gift, wadda ya say?" Wrapping her in his arm, he walked towards the kitchen to her chants of 'num num nums.' She definitely had a Winchester appetite.
“Alright. Umm...are you sure you’re good with me and Cas mating? I mean, really think about this.” He kept talking over Sam trying to jump in.
He had kissed before, but never had he been so consumed with the taste of someone. He could almost taste the honey scent of Dean in his mouth. It was heavenly. Cas let his hands wander from the broad shoulders (hot damn!) down to the alpha’s hands that were holding him by the hips.
“Thank you so much for everything, Charlie. I don’t know what I would have done if you weren’t here. I was already scared from falling, losing my wings, and then going through all of those biological changes. When those alphas chased me…” He shuddered. “That was something new: I had never been scared of an alpha before this happened.”
Cas unbuttoned the alpha’s jeans and teased the zipper down as he sucked on Dean’s tongue. Oh, the things he wanted that tongue to do to him! But he was apparently going too slow for Dean, ‘cuz in the blink of an eye, Cas found himself sitting naked on top of his also, gloriously naked mate!
Dean held perfectly still as Cas placed his hands on his face so that he could stare into his eyes. He held his breath, waiting for his omega to talk, but all his beautiful angel did was bare his neck to him while looking down in submission.
One last, hard push is all it took for Dean’s knot to lock them together, and with a roar the alpha leaned down and bit Cas over his mating gland while snarling the word ‘mine’ over and over. Cas muttered ‘yours’ as his alpha cleaned his bite before gently turning them to the side. As Cas  began drifting off to sleep he could still feel Dean releasing inside him. They were mated.
He had been so scared on his way to the bunker, and so afraid that the hunter would deny that they were mates. After those drunk alphas had chased him, he was incredibly thankful to Mr. Roche for putting him in a cab with a beta driver. He had even paid for the cab, as well as sending some bottled water and snacks for him and the driver. He was a good alpha and Cas hoped he found his own mate soon.
It seemed as if the alpha had a sense of self preservation, since he merely dabbed at his lip with the back of a hand and nodded in silence.
This really isn't a chapter. It is a bonus scene that was asked for, and I thought it would be fun. Hope it meets expectations.
The prince continued, “I’ve decided that if you challenge me, with the understanding that you fight for your baron, I will kill you.”
"Just help me sweep up the feathers while I go put on my ceremonial robe. Please, Sam. I'm nervous enough without you giving me a hard time."
Cas knew he was no longer an angel but he was surely in Heaven finally having his alpha inside him. Moving deep and hard, the large head of his cock rubbing against his sweet spot with each stroke was causing him to lose his mind, but in such a good way. He tried pushing his hips back to meet Dean’s thrusts but every time he tried the alpha held his hips tighter and growled. Damn, that was hot.
Charlie interrupted with, “No, you misunderstand me. No one in the castle baked any apple pies for today.”
The kitten is named after someone I've come to love very much which makes me ever so grateful to this fandom. I have made so many friends,  and began writing again.
"Absolutely, love. Here, you give me our pup and I'll feed her plums while you eat, then you can give her some milk while I eat. After that I'd say she'll be out." He traded the pup for the tray then proceeded to get more plums on his shirt than in her mouth. It was more her fault than his, but she was
“Oh, Sweetheart. Don’t be cryin’, now. I’m on my way, as fast as I can.” Dean made his voice as soft as he could.
“Alpha.” He barely heard the whimper from Cas, but he felt it resonate throughout his body, most especially in his cock. He pressed closer to his mate’s body, making sure he could feel every inch of him sliding in the slick between his thighs.
Sorry it's been a minute since I've updated this story, I'm still working on my Bingo challenges, and sometimes my health just gets the best of me.
“No, not at all. I just...I think we should continue this somewhere more private than the parking lot. I have already heard some growls coming from patrons that want you.”
happiness. John’s afraid that being mated and having pups would soften them. I think its best if you just don’t worry about John Winchester.” She tossed Emmie (it was gonna take a while to get used to that!) over to him.
“Never mind...where am I to go? Will you take me to where I need to be and, please, keep my brother out of trouble until this is over?”
These last few years had been harder, trying to keep his feelings from the hunter. He even suspected that Sam knew, but he had done his best. Now, though, because of Naomi’s actions, he was free from any inhibitions. He firmly believed that his Father made him into Dean’s omega. They were literally ‘made’ for each other.
He slammed his eyes closed going so far as to cover them with his hands while keeping contact with his alpha for as long as he could. He heard laughing along with bullets being fired, but Dean’s glorious wings never stopped protecting him. The show of strength, the mating bite on his neck, the sensual play of his alpha’s scent curling around his nose were causing reactions that would normally be a death sentence while locked up with two testosterone pumped-up alphas, but he knew Dean was his, and he had no fear. It was astounding to the omega to not feel fear around Alistair, and it made him feel reborn. Oh, they really needed to get out of here and go see Emmie quickly before he literally threw his mate to the floor and rode him til they were both raw.
It didn’t take but a few more thrusts until Cas could feel Dean’s knot was just about to lock them together. He thrust up into his alpha harder, wanting him to lock them together but he wanted his bite too. He brought his hands up and cradled his mate’s face forcing him to look up from where their bodies were thrusting together, to look into his eyes. When Cas was sure he had Dean’s attention, with no slowing down, he bared his neck to him letting him know with no uncertainty that Cas was ready to be his and his alone.
Cas could feel the excitement and desire surging through his body. He was shaking with it. There was also a bit of anxiousness of being separated from his Alpha without being mated. Cas believed that this was definitely more urgent, but he had felt this since he had smelled Dean all those years ago.
When Dean nipped his right cheek his omega gasped in shock, reached back, and grabbed Dean by the hair and pulled his face deeper into his ass. The alpha let out a chuckle and obeyed the silent order. Yes, sir!
“Cas, not gonna last too much longer, Sweetheart. Wanna feel you come on my cock. Please. Come on Omega, stroke yourself. Let me see you,” the alpha growled.
“Alright, Sam. I’m recording them and the vile things they are talking about doing to the ‘bitch in heat’ so that the cops can lock them up.”
Dean nodded once to his brother as he felt Sam clasp his shoulder with his hand. He literally was his ‘handler’ for the ceremony. He was glad that Michael had chosen Sam, and not his father, when it became apparent that his mom wouldn’t be able to walk him. Dean wouldn’t be able to show his father his nervousness, and he would not have known that his omega was here, for John would not have told him.
Placing nips along Cas’ shoulder blade, he grazed his teeth up the side of his neck, causing Cas to stretch it further, giving his mate room to taste him. Dean let his alpha lead him to the perfect spot where he sucked a deep bruise. X marked the spot when he was ready.
"Alright, it's my turn." Dean kissed Emmie and Cas before standing up to take his son from Gabriel (who made him promise to give him back, soon!) to present him to Michael.
"Why don't you ya' know, wave your hands or whatever it is the other angels do? I've noticed that you and your family tend to do things the 'human' way." Dean smiled when he actually used finger quotes.
He shook his head to get himself out of the past and into the present. He needed to finish his water. No drinking on the job was his one rule to the guys other than not touching anyone during club hours. If they wanted to hook up after, that was on them, but nothing could happen in the clubs. He had time to do one lap dance before he had to get changed for his slow number.
"Of course not, I gave my word." He tried to appease the Angel. He didn't know what he had done to make them threaten him, but he had given his word. He would follow them.
His omega canted his head to the side. “What happened? You were talking and then just went silent.” Is it possible Cas looked even sweeter with that head tilt?
"Oh, it looks as if Dean has found his one. So, come on now. Don't be shy. He won't bite, at least on stage. Ladies and Gentlemen, Dean the Rough boy!"
Cas smiled as his soon-to-be mate dodged a punch from one alpha, as he simultaneously broke the neck of the one who was trying to grab him from the side. Dean had grabbed him by the hair before gripping his head with two hands and, twisting hard, killed the alpha instantly, leaving only two, now.
“What, why?” Damn, he did the head tilt again. He prayed that their pups wouldn't do that or he’d have a hard time saying no to them.
He heard a snort from the direction of his omega. Seems he had impressed his mate. He turned his gaze back to the woefully misguided alpha in front of him.
Everyone knew about the AO Meet, where he and his father had been “invited" by royal command. One didn't ignore the king, not even his father. Dean had heard Lord John raging at his steward and anyone in the manor that was within earshot about how the king had ruined his plans. Dean was to have been mated to their neighbor, the Baron Invidus, in exchange for a very large and lucrative parcel of land. The union hadn't been properly approved by the king, but that wouldn't have stopped the alpha. Baron Winchester was on the “outs" with King Michael (and the king also detested Lord Zachariah), so his father figured better to ask for forgiveness than permission, since once a mating was consummated, it was rarely broken.
“No, Bal. There's no one. This is what I can tell you, what I know right now. Without having talked to Cas about what he wants, here are the things I want.”
“They don’t want you to see the bloodshed, Charlie.” The brothers smiled at each other listening to Cas explain the reasoning.
Dean wasn’t sure if they had been kissing for minutes or even hours. Even when Cas leaned back to look at him from under his lashes and he got a look at his omega’s lips, he wasn’t sure. They were red, swollen, and shiny with spit, and his blue eyes were dark with lust, giving Dean a thrill that he had caused such a reaction in his mate. The alpha was beside himself with how much he wanted him. He knew the mechanics of mating (man, that class was
“Cas, why don’t you and Emmie come sit with me for a bit as Dean makes his report to Michael? We need to get you fed before your heat hits. Also, I'd like some more time with you and my grandpup.”
Taking one finger he eased it between Cas’ ass cheeks, his progress made smooth by the leaking slick. Remembering the taste of that slick caused his cock to begin filling faster than the moan did. He shifted a bit, pushing his cock against Cas’ hip to get a touch of friction, but not enough to wake his mate, not yet.
“Please kneel here, on these pillows, facing each other. I want you to listen to the vows and make sure that your inner alpha and omega can live up to them.”
"Thanks, Sammy. I just want to, well, to be good enough. You know that Dad was disappointed when word came down that I would be a Virtue after I become mated. He wanted me to be a Seraph or he really hoped I would be like our original sire Michael and become an Archangel."
“Well it’s ‘cuz of Mom, I suppose. She has never stopped calling the little ones ‘pups.’ Hell...heck! She still calls me ‘n Sammy her puppies. Mom didn't change when she became a cupid. She still keeps a lot of her human ways.”
Dean took his time pleasuring his mate and was rewarded a few moments later when Cas came, his cock untouched, shooting his cum across Dean’s abs. He watched as the omega tried to catch his breath, giving him a moment before he began moving his fingers again. While he began thrusting in and out of the tight channel, he did avoid his prostate this time, giving him a bit of a breather.
Dean stroked his hand down Cas’ face, gently rubbing his thumb across his cheek and waited for him to look up. It took a minute, and he held still since he could smell the nervousness now coming from Cas. His patience paid off when he finally looked Dean in the eye.
He slowly raised his head before opening his eyes to see the most beautiful omega ever created, and he was his mate! He was just a few inches shorter than Dean and he had the bluest eyes, but they held unshed tears. Dean didn’t want his mate to be sad.
Dean hesitated. What his father had originally planned was wrong, and he might get in trouble if the king found out. But he couldn’t lie to a prince, right?
“Dean! I am much too heavy for you to be carrying. I am perfectly  capable of walking, Alpha.” His mate looked into the teasing, twinkling, blue eyes and laughed. He liked Cas teasing him. It made his heart lighter to see the laugh lines around his eyes and the one side of his mouth raised in a classic Dean Winchester smirk.
Those blue eyes glared back at him halfway through his speech, and his omega grabbed his shirt with both fists. “Dean Winchester! You are so much more than what you just said. You are a big brother who has raised your little brother and you put him through school. You are buying out Bobby so he can retire, instead of just leasing a place and starting your own business. You have given your friends, along with yourself, opportunities to make money to follow their own dreams. I will not have you talking bad about my alpha, capice??”
Lining up to his entrance, Castiel managed to get out, “Are you ready, Sweetheart?” hear his mate's assent and push in with one, long glide.
He could feel his heart start racing and his cock getting harder as he watched Cas fumble with the buttons on his shirt. God, but he was beautiful, and right now, he was giving off the most amazing scent of desire and just a hint of nervousness.
As Crowley walked off the stage, the room lights dimmed while the stage lights began strobing in a rainbow of colors. It was slightly hypnotic. After just a moment those lights went out as well, leaving the room dark save the lights in the DJ booth. He could just barely see the curtain moving. He assumed the Alphas were walking out on the stage.
He helped Cas settle on his knees before kneeling down in front of him. Cas reached and grabbed both of his hands and gave him a timid smile. When Michael began to speak, they both turned to look up at him.
"Oh! Daddy brought food! Yay!" Dean smiled at Cas' over-exuberance for the sake of their pup. As soon as she heard the word food, Emmie was focused on the tray that Dean sat over his lap as he sat down next to his mate.
He had never, though, had his alpha want out during sex. Don’t get him wrong, he loved sex. His alpha was just waiting for its mate and now that it’s found him, he’s anxious to knot and mate his omega.
“Alistair! Surrender and submit!” Oh, that growl. Yep, Cas could definitely feel slick leaking from his hole and he needed his alpha to fill him up.
Dean sighed. He never really believed the shit John used to say about omegas. He really didn’t. He was just scared out of his mind that he would mess up the one good thing that could be happening. He called out to his brother before he slammed out the door.
As the Spring explodes with beauty and growth, as the Summer sun warms all creatures, as the sweet harvest of Fall overflows in bounty, and in the crisp, cold, clarity of Winter, may you have love every season, every year, forever.
“Take all the time you need, Alpha. I'm not going anywhere. I'm yours.” Huh...Raising up to look at Cas he questioned.
He grabbed Dean’s phone off the table while he leaned back to kiss his brother on the cheek, loving the feel of his alpha’s strong arms holding him up, protecting him.
"The Angels. The Angels have called for sacrifices. You, Castiel, have been chosen to represent our most humble district. Report to my office by 5 p.m., and don't make me send someone after you. Good Afternoon, gentlemen."
“Lay on the bed, Omega, face down.” The moan from Cas made Dean’s jaw clench, trying not to come. He watched as he laid down with his arms under the pillow, but his eyes never left Dean's. As he stroked his cock a few times he heard Cas gasp.
Dean was a happy alpha. He was sitting next to his omega (he was mated! Well, except for the…ya’ know) and his pup was sleeping on his shoulder with her little nose pressed deep into his neck. It tickled every time she took a breath and he loved it!
"Bbbbub....ers!" Emmie's squeal as she tried to escape Cas' arms (not happening, Dean knew that it had bothered his omega that she had become so upset hearing his labor) to get to CJ.
“Dean!” Dean was startled at the scream Cas let out, and the fact that the omega came again just from the first lick across his rim. Hehehe....this was gonna be fun.
Well, he had never felt this fantastic before, either. An otherworldly orgasm would do that to a body.
“Well, I particularly enjoy walking among the gardens. Did you get a chance to see any of it, perchance?”
As he scrubbed the dried blood from the vamps’ nest out of his hair with hot water, he silently thanked Bobby Singer for teaching him general handyman skills as well as car maintenance. It felt luxurious after driving more than a day with an itchy head, but he hurried so he could go inside as soon as Charlie came out.
Dragging his nails up Cas’ spine until he could pull his head back his hair, Dean attacked his neck again with lips, tongue and teeth. He opened his mouth wide right above Cas’ Adam’s apple and held on with his canines as he breeched his hole with his middle finger, causing the omega to shout his name.
He could see Dean’s mouth moving, and he assumed that he was talking to his brother, but he never took his eyes off the other alpha. Cas was relieved as he saw Sam shake his head in the negative, and almost (almost!) missed the feral smile that broke out on his alpha’s face, just before he began stalking towards the last alpha standing between him and his omega.
He closed his eyes after seeing Dean’s face coming closer. He expected Dean to ravish him, but he was surprised when he felt the gentle nudge of a nose against his. Cas leaned into the palm Dean lay against his cheek, slightly turning so he could scent the alpha’s wrist. He felt the puff of air on his lips right before Dean finally touched his lips with his.
"Nonsense. You only turn twenty-one once and we're having a party. There will be plenty of your friends and family there if the RSVPs are correct."
Charlie stepped forward and curtsied. “Your Royal Highness, if I may?” She barely hesitated to wait for the prince's nod. “Sir, may I present Master Dean, son of Baron Winchester. Sir, this is His Royal Highness, Prince Castiel.”
"Yeah well, in my opinion Dad's been pissy since he was passed over for Archangel when he mated with Mom. He only talks to us by giving us orders because he can't order anyone else around. When you are mated and become a Virtue he won't be able to order you around anymore."
“Fuck me! You look so good taking my cock. Love watching, all shiny with your slick. Damn, Cas, don’t know how much longer I can hold on. I wanna be caught tight inside you with my teeth locked onto your skin. I need to mark you as mine.”
When they had first walked into the dining hall (Michael could throw a lavish dinner party for sure), Cas’s brother had approached them, intending to take Emmie. Dean didn’t mean to growl at him, but he was thankful when his mate explained about Dean wanting to bond with their pup. Gabriel and Sam would get Emmie soon enough.
"Cassie, darling, can it. I talk to your alpha, get his number, or....I call Mother Dearest and tell her that her little, bitty omega has found his true mate."
Dean had explained everything that he knew to his brother while sitting with his head in his hands. He was blown away at the knowledge that Cas was an omega. An omega that said Dean was his alpha. It was everything that he had ever wanted, but he had hidden it deep in his pocket of dreams that he never thought would come true.
Mary would then let go of Dean to help his mate stand again before she gave the Omega Dean's hand, in fact transferring Dean to his mate.
Realizing his mistake, the other alpha quickly put down the book he had been reading and stood up. “Forgive me, Your Royal Highness, I meant no disrespect, of course.”
"Cassie, chill. The head angel dudette said that you weren't in trouble and they haven't decided about me yet. So, you just gonna sit there and stare hunky angel dude?"
Dean was standing in a warehouse surrounded by alphas  lying on the ground, except for the ugly one who was snarling at him. Cas stood closely behind Dean.
“Fuck. That word has never sounded better than it does coming out of your pretty mouth, Omega. I could drive us to your place...”
He was, admittedly, very anxious and wanted to be home in his own room. Even though his life up to this point had been lonely and sometimes cruel, he figured the devil you know is preferable to the devil you don't, right? His father had never been affectionate, even when his mother was alive, but after her death he had been cold and distant. Then, after he had presented as an omega at thirteen, Lord John not only never gave a kind word or touch, he went out of his way to berate and humiliate him—both privately and in public (Dean was routinely informed that he was useless and unworthy). He also regularly struck him since he never thought Dean answered him appropriately or moved quickly enough for his standards.
“Nah, Cas. Right number, he’s just driving and had me answer the phone. Um...hold on. I'm gonna put you on speaker phone so you can talk to him, o.k.?”
“Raise up a bit, Cas,” he told the omega, helping him raise his bottom up just enough so that Dean could move his hand down between their bodies. He wanted to reach through Cas’ legs to tease his hole with a finger.
Dean was about to tell him to get another dancer up there when he caught the scent getting closer, and he watched as two men sat at table. Dean knew it was one of them, and he was going to find out which one and introduce himself. In a most unique way. He laughed as he stepped into the DJ booth next to the stage to talk to him and Crowley.
“Oh, Dean! That feels so good…so, good! Harder, please. I need your cock, I need your knot!” He was almost delirious in his pleasure at feeling the alpha’s knot start to catch on his rim as Dean fucked him harder and harder.
“Now, Sir, we have a few hours left before the Meet begins. Would you like to do anything in particular while we wait?” Charlie smiled while she paused for his answer.
The beta led him to the tents for a cool glass of lemonade. “I will stay with you until an alpha dismisses me. OK, sir?”
“Not trying to be. Seriously, he showed up in heat. Passed out in my lap. He said it started when he was thrown from Heaven and he’s looking for you.”
He heard the sharp gasp from Cas as he saw Alistair draw his gun, but Alistair’s eyes grew wide when Dean showed the shadow of his wings.
“She umm....she knows me as her Momma, thanks to Gabriel. He started it as a joke, but now she gets confused if someone refers to me as Daddy.” He could feel himself blush.
“Oh, that’s nice.” He drained his drink as he felt his temperature going up. They didn’t have too much time left before his heat hit him full blast.
They walked back to the living room to find Gabe laughing like a loon, while Sam was looking at Gabe like he
He heard the bedroom door open, so he rolled over and sat on the edge of the bed. Cas was very happy to lay his head on her shoulder when the tiny dynamo hugged him.
He tossed his forearms over Cas' shoulders as he slid from a side to side wave of muscles back to the S-wave like a cobra. Dean could smell his Omega's arousal now. It wasn't just him getting hard for him, he was leaking slick now, and he wanted that amazing smelling flavor on his tongue. He leaned forward to Cas' ear again.
Dean sighed when he watched his mom kiss Bobby on the cheek, in thanks for a small figurine of a turtle dove that he gave her. So far, Bobby had impressed Mary (and Dean, to be honest) with his instincts for courting gifts. He was happy for them both. For a while after John had been forced to fall, Dean and Sam had 'peeked' in on him, and every time he was in a bar drowning his sorrows instead of doing good as Michael had demanded. Dean was curious as to what his Original Sire was going to do to John, but right at this moment he didn't care, and right now he was happy to see his mate walking towards him.
Dean jumped when his phone rang, since he had been intent on hearing what his brother was trying to tell him.
“Well, I'm not a betting angel, but I will wager that you only have about thirty seconds left to live. Any last words? Do you wish to repent for your sins, for the evil you have done?”
Dean was surrounded by his friends as they patted him on the back and hugged him. He heard a lot of 'lucky bastard' as well, since he was the only one who had found their mate so far.
Pushing open the solid wooden door, Cas gasped as he looked into the room. The walls were a light cream with a soft blue border and accent wall. He glanced at the walls to see picture frames scattered all around the room, but he would check those out later. Right now, oh, right now he had to examine the bed. It was huge! He was gonna have to ask Dean how it fit in the house. It was big enough that four or more of him and Dean would fit, with room left for pups!
He took the stairs two at a time, not bothering to count the doors, and just followed his nose, since he could smell Cas’ nervousness.
“I see.” Cas looked down gazing at his cock, letting the alpha know that he had felt his reaction. “I believe I would like for you to take away the fear because I want this time to belong to us, completely.”
Sam stood up and admitted to himself that he enjoyed the look of wonder on the omega’s face when he was finally on his feet. He knew he was one of the tallest angels in his original sire’s line. Michael was forever teasing him that he still had an inch or so on Sam’s 6’4” height. He looked at the shorter omega and watched as a myriad of small, wrapped items fell out of his hands.
He ran his hands up the outside of Cas’ thighs, massaging them firmly, which caused the omega to push his ass up, trying to get Dean where he wanted him. The alpha just winked at him and whispered “patience” as he took one cheek in each of his hands to squeeze and separate them so he could see the hole that was leaking Dean’s new addiction.
"I love you, Alpha. Thank you so much for this life we have." Dean couldn't resist leaning over to kiss his teary mate.
Dean whimpered at Cas’ words. He couldn’t wait for everyone to know that they belonged to each other, either. Sure, there had been snark, innuendos, and some people had even asked how long they had been together, but once they left their bites on each other, there would no longer be any question that they were together.
When Dean stepped into their inner nest, he found Cas standing at the end of the bed, naked as he asked, just staring at their bed. His inner alpha wanted to roar at the smell of the omega’s slick and the beauty standing before him. He sat the cooler on the bedside table before turning to look at Cas, instantly getting caught up in those riveting blue eyes. Dean felt his chest puff up when those eyes widened, then darkened even more with lust as he watched the alpha remove his own clothing.
He walked over with Cas to the next room so he could explain Michael's wishes. Once they were seated, he took both the omega’s hands and rubbed circles with his thumbs to help settle him.
Dean was to hold his head straight ahead with his eyes on the floor. He was told that he would take one step at a time and hold in position for the count of ten until he reached the door on the other side of the hall. His mother would be his eyes in there until he heard someone say stop.
