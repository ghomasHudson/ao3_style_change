Sherlock stood in the open door, adorably sleep rumpled and wide eyed. His left cheek was lightly creased by the weave of the throw pillow, and his tousled hair stood out in a fuzzy shock from his head. His eyes flicked over John from top to bottom, no doubt deducing his nervousness.
Sherlock’s kindle bookshelf was an eclectic mess of esoteric topics, most books only partially read. Seven stood out from the rest, their progress trackers at 100%.
They smiled at each other for a quiet moment, then John leaned forward to press another kiss into Sherlock’s curls.
Actually, I know the answer to that. And I’m supposed to be kinder to myself these days, so. Here’s the reason.
A dry, tearing fight with paper and glue, and the ripped up red envelope fell to the pile of mail. Sure enough, Sherlock glimpsed the precise letters of his mother’s handwriting, front and center:
Sherlock has requested that we reduce our visits from once per week to twice per month while he adjusts to the greater share of childcare duties and enjoys the early days of his relationship. I broached the topic of couples therapy with him, suggesting it as a way to ensure a strong start for him and John, and he was amenable. I will bring it up with John in his session and schedule them for next week if he agrees.
Stop. It’s fine. It’s not that kind of letter. Because since my last letter, the one where I promised you forever and gave you a ring, we’ve been almost adequate at communicating with real words like grown ups, spoken out loud and everything. Wonders never cease, yeah?
[Sherlock cuts him off with a gesture as a car pulls up at the curb a few spots down from 221B. John Watson climbs out of the driver’s seat and runs a hand through his hair, then opens the back door. He emerges with a bright yellow shoulder bag and Rosamund Watson in his arms. He closes the car door with one hip and walks toward 221B. SH, who had been staring transfixed, brushes a curl off his forehead and turns back to GL, shifting from foot to foot]
John groaned into Sherlock’s neck as he pinned him against the bedroom door, fumbling for the handle. “You telling me you’re loud in bed, posh boy?”
“Come on,” he said, doing up Sherlock’s trousers and tugging him out of the car. They spilled onto the pavement in a tangle of limbs, and Sherlock draped himself over John as he scrabbled with the keys, gasping at the feel of Sherlock’s hard cock grinding into his lower back.
He hung up and dragged John into the alley next to the pub all in one motion. Before he could process what was happening, John found himself yanked forward so he pinned Sherlock against the wall. Sherlock spread his legs further and slid down the wall to equalize their height, so they were nose to nose and groin to groin.
“Please,” Mummy answered. She slid the bacon onto a plate, then turned to gesture to the assembled group. “Well, let’s get on with it! Christmas is starting! Let’s go!”
John let out a harsh breath and leaned up to nuzzle their noses together, his eyes closed, his watery smile the sweetest thing Sherlock had ever seen.
We’ve skived off for a week away at the beach with Rosie to celebrate our new family status. She loves the sand and the water, even though it’s still bloody cold. When we get back we’re leaving again, just the two of us, for another week or so away somewhere outside of England. We’ll resume taking cases when we get back, which will be whenever we feel like it. We’ve earned a break.
John met Sherlock’s eyes directly and, holding his gaze the entire time, raised the glass to his mouth and drank deeply. When they kissed again, bright bursts of black cherry and plum lingered on John’s tongue, the flavor better in John’s mouth than it could ever be from a glass.
Every noise went straight to the burning pool of crackling tension at the base of John’s spine, and he squeezed them both tighter as Sherlock’s thrusts sped, faster, faster, shoving forward into John’s fist and back onto his fingers again and again until a groan tore itself from his throat and his come spilled over John’s hand, his shirt, his
Sherlock tightened his hold around John’s waist until they were flush together, until Sherlock could feel John’s heart beating against his. He took a breath, squeezed his eyes shut, and confessed into the curve of John’s neck: “I love you too. Always have.”
And as John fell to his knees on the kitchen floor, one thought occurred to Sherlock in a moment of crystal clarity:
It still didn’t necessarily mean John would be open to a relationship. At the very least, though, it meant that John found something about him physically appealing.
Then the front door opened and shut downstairs, and the sound of tread on the steps jolted them apart with wide eyes. Heavy, unbalanced—not Mrs. Hudson.
This is a short excerpt from the novel Giovanni’s Room, a landmark work by the American author James Baldwin.
The sound and scent of sizzling bacon chose that moment to make themselves known, and Sherlock’s stomach gave a loud rumble. John barked a laugh and yanked Sherlock down for a good morning kiss.
"Guessing that's our ride?" he panted, thrusting shallowly into Sherlock, barely inside him at all. Sherlock hummed.
He broke off and twitched the fingers of his right hand, then took a breath and rushed on. “Sometimes, I would imagine that it was us. That
John, we are so delighted to have you and Rosie as part of the Holmes family. We love both so much, and we can never thank you enough for making our son so happy. Kiss our grandbaby for us!
“It is exactly that easy,” she’d said. “Put my boy out of his misery, John. You’ve had his heart for years, and I’ve grown quite tired of watching him wait for you.”
[SH wraps his arms around JW, buries his face in JW’s shoulder, and begins to cry in earnest. JW presses his face into SH’s curls and holds him close.]
The whole thing with the woman on the bus I told you about was just one more symptom of how completely and utterly fucked everything was. If I’m honest, I never should have gone back to Mary after she shot you. I didn’t want to. I only did because you said I should.
“Look, Sherlock and I need to head home. Just have Lestrade contact him if you need any more details, yeah?” he said, slipping past her. Sherlock had turned away and started toward the curb, and John was damned if he was going to let Sherlock strand him there to go home and sulk alone after the night they’d had together. Dinner and a case. Their perfect date.
They were quiet for a long moment, the only sound in the flat their slowing breaths and the soothing slide of hands over skin.
After a moment of blissful silence, John braced his hands on his knees and hauled himself out of his chair, then picked up a packed duffel he had stashed by the front door earlier that evening.
“Oh, come off it,” Sherlock said, rolling his eyes but tucking the tickets carefully back in their envelope all the same. “You’re just happy you don’t have to row with the chip and pin machine for a month.”
Sherlock’s brain went into overdrive. Deduce, quickly: Pupils dilated. Racing pulse. Physical proximity. Steady hands.
It’s truly moving to finally see these two men happy. I look forward to helping them take these next steps together.
John answered by opening the door and striding confidently into the sitting room. Sherlock followed, glaring.
I'm caught up now, so no more 'two posts in one day'. Sorry for cluttering up your inbox, subscribers!
Thanks for the shoutout, mate, and you’re quite welcome!!! For the record, it was completely obvious from the moment you were first in a room together!
Mrs. Hudson nodded emphatically. "Exactly. And it's incredibly common. A lot of people don't even realize that a lot of their gripes with their spouses, friends, and family all come down to a simple miscommunication on a very basic level."
“Don’t use it all,” he said, sounding a bit breathless, then poured the rest over the fingers of John’s unoccupied hand. That accomplished, he threw the packet aside, wrapped his arms around John’s neck, and canted his hips forward, thrusting into John’s fist. The feel of Sherlock’s cock gliding across his nearly wiped his brain clean blank—but not so blank that he didn’t pick up on Sherlock’s unspoken request. He trailed the fingers of his other hand from the small of Sherlock’s back, down,
John’s heart leapt, and he snuck a glance across the table. Sherlock looked like he wanted to drown himself in his wine glass.
They worked side-by-side for two hours, in near silence that grew progressively more comfortable as the sun rose and London came awake on the street below. Empty dust outlines were filled as items returned to their former homes, tea and toast were consumed, and every piece put back felt like another brick in the wall, rebuilding their fortress. Just the two of them against the rest of the world. At home, together.
Watson-Holmes OMG I never thought I would see this day! My twin brother has a husband!! I’m so proudhappyexcited for you, Johnny. Thank you for a great evening.
Sherlock grunted a vague acknowledgement, so John rolled away to dig his phone out of his pocket. Sherlock might resent Mycroft’s interference, but John was happy to abuse it for Sherlock’s benefit. Especially now.

John laughed helplessly to the ceiling, a mess of confused, amused, and turned on. "Sorry, gents. Duty calls."
“Ridiculous. Mrs. Hudson will live forever.” Sherlock’s arms tightened around John at that, and John felt him brush another kiss into his hair.
, straight down John’s throat with a high, desperate cry. John hummed his pleasure and drank it all down, held him gently in his mouth as he came down from his orgasm, soothing Sherlock with long, gentle brushes over his thighs and stomach. Sherlock pried his eyes open and looked down at John in wonder, ran his hands over John’s flushed cheeks, over lips that grinned with wicked glee, through tousled hair that stuck up in clumps where it had been gripped. Absolutely stunning, unbelievably gorgeous, simply—
You can shove right off, you horrible woman. Why John didn’t block you years ago I will never understand. You are wonderful parents, boys, don’t you listen to her
“What about that one?” Sherlock asked despite his foul mood, reluctant to speak or engage with the festivities in any beyond the required. He couldn’t believe that after all the build up, after all the supportive words and not-so-gentle encouragement, everyone seemed committed to ignoring the change in he and John’s relationship, but his curiosity over the package got the better of him.
“Here, drink this,” he said, passing him the water glass. “You’re probably dehydrated, and you’ll need your mouth wet enough to dissolve the tablet.”
, and Sherlock though of full-bodied flavor on John’s mouth, of seductive red, warmth in his belly, first kisses, and laying John down in front of the fire while a winter wonderland swirled outside their window.
The boys loved it, hooting with laughter and slapping the table until John walked up with their drinks, suitably impressed by Sherlock’s acting skills. Though that phrase,
“Well, Father and I are ancient and will most certainly not be staying up until midnight, so we’ll say happy New Year to you now and see you in the morning.”
John lifted his free hand and rested it on Sherlock’s hip, his thumb stroking through his shirt along one sharp hip bone. Sherlock’s breath caught, stuttered in his lungs—then gave way to a flood of courage.
John huffed a laugh against Sherlock’s cheek. “Mark the day, Sherlock Holmes voluntarily offered to call his brother for help.”
John hadn’t wasted breath denying the observational powers of a Holmes. A melancholy calm had settled over his heart, and with a quick glance at Sherlock’s closed bedroom door, he’d replied, “It’s not quite that easy.”
“I need you, John, I need you, hurry, hurry up, damn it,” he muttered into John’s neck, and when the lock finally clicked open John gasped with relief.
Sherlock dipped the ladle into the spiced wine and poured the dark red liquid into two cups, then made his way back to John, his nose full of the mingled scents of cinnamon and clove. A young constable John cornered him near the fireplace where he’d been warming up, but a quick glare from over John’s shoulder sent him scurrying away. John turned to him with a relieved smile and accepted his cup of wine.
John smiled, just a small thing, and squeezed Sherlock's arm once before letting his hand drift to the small of Sherlock's back to guide him out the door.
This is the second of four chapters being posted today. Make sure you didn't miss chapter 47, because this will make no sense without it. Two more chapters coming, but both very short just FYI. Subscribe/follow on tumblr/check back later for more.
"Well, boys," John said, downing the last of his lager and Sherlock's scotch in quick succession, "this has been fun, but Sherlock and I need to get home." John held his keys and mobile in front of him in case the effect of Sherlock's tongue on his was obvious in the lay of his jeans.
Sherlock had just fallen into a light doze when a change in John’s breathing pulled him back to wakefulness. He inhaled deeply, memorizing the scent of early morning John hair, and drew John in closer.
: Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson, can you speak to the ongoing rumors about a romantic relationship between the two of you?
A slow smile curled at the corner of Sherlock’s mouth, and he glanced up at John’s eyes for the briefest instant before looking down the street for a cab to hail.
Mycroft entered the flat and handed John a pharmacy bag, then sat in Sherlock’s chair without invitation. John sat on the couch, his palms braced against his forehead, eyes squeezed shut until he could finally make the words come.
The ache in John’s chest flared, cracked open, as Sherlock dipped his head to brush their noses together, to nuzzle against John’s cheek and jawline. He pulled back just far enough to meet John’s eyes one last time, then let his own fall shut as he finally,
[JW closes his eyes and grins, looks away, then presses his lips together and looks back up at SH. For a second he sways closer, then he takes a deep breath and two steps back]
John tightened his hold on Sherlock’s waist, pulling him in even closer, then drained the last of his wine and stepped away. “I’m going to go get a refill. Want more?”
I’ve never hidden who I am, I’ve never denied it, and I’ve always been comfortable with myself, even when the rest of the world wasn’t. But you never caught on. Possibly because you didn’t want to.
about his own divorce at length, which will drive you to drinking within hours, and you’ve been staying at Baker Street anyway and you’re much more comfortable there and…” He finally paused in his litany, a flicker of uncertainty crossing his otherwise impassive face. “I want you to. Just. Stay.”
John pulled their cases from the boot and handed Sherlock’s over, not letting go until their fingers touched. “Shall we get settled?”

one last time… then he closed the distance and pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s. John let Sherlock’s kiss fill all the empty places within him, dig out old hopes dusty with disuse and carefully packed desires, let everything fall into its proper place. He pressed every last ounce of his overflowing, aching sweetness onto Sherlock’s lips, his tongue, his body, and loved, loved, loved.
He pulled his coat the rest of the way over his shoulders and wound his scarf around his neck. A bandage poorly-applied.
John’s stomach sank. The easy, post-case contentment had been completely stripped away, replaced by an awkward distance. Five minutes ago he’d been ready to risk it. Ready to confess. Now, with Sherlock’s reaction to his history, his sexuality…
I have assigned some exercises in self-compassion and forgiveness in addition to logging his alcohol intake. While John has several other issues to work through, if he can complete this anger management course and forgive himself for not missing his wife, he will be well on the road to recovery. He appears serious and thoroughly committed to treatment for the first time in our long association. Prognosis is good.
“No!” John answered without a second’s hesitation, then shut his mouth with an audible click and pursed lips. Sherlock barely suppressed a grin, and Mrs. Hudson hid a snicker behind her hand when John flushed. “I think the rest of the world frowns on going out in a dressing gown and pyjamas,” John added. “Or only a sheet, for that matter.”
This is the third and final chapter for today, so make sure you didn't miss chapters 55 & 56. Three more chapters tomorrow!
"You sure you're up for this tonight? Mrs. Hudson would understand, you know," he asked, rubbing his thumb across the smooth fabric of Sherlock's fine suit jacket. He told himself he didn't actually sound breathless, but it didn't seem to matter much; Sherlock was speechless, his mouth slightly open and his eyes locked on John's. Frozen. Bad frozen, or... ?
I concluded our session by asking how he felt about John’s progress in anger management in relation to their past violence. Sherlock’s brightness dimmed a bit, but he agreed that the courses seemed to be doing John a lot of good. He described the same moment in the park that John did on Tuesday, relating to Sherlock’s fake suicide, and noted that John dealt with the situation well. He finally acknowledged that John’s violence is a problem, that he did not deserve to be beaten, and that he does not intend to allow it in the future, should it ever come up again, though he doesn’t believe it will. These commitments still feel quite new and raw coming from him,  but I do believe he is finally beginning to develop some sense of who he is and what kind of care he needs and deserves. I am pleased with his progress and look forward to seeing him continue his new, better habits through our next appointment.
Mummy closed the door to the room with a gentle click, a cloud of plaster dust puffing out. “Mycroft has been saying for years that he hardly needs his own bedroom here anymore and that we should just turn it into a proper guest room already. He had
I know this is stupidly early, but it’s also years too late at the same time, so it’s a compromise, right? And it doesn’t have to mean marriage if you don’t want it to, but it does mean that you have my commitment, Sherlock. I’m home. Forever.
Sherlock glared daggers at his mother’s back as he paced around the sitting room, doing his best to tune out the horrid small talk his family insisted on. They’d only been there for six hours and Sherlock was already on the verge of creating a crime scene of his own. They’d managed to finish decorating the tree, have lunch, ‘catch up’, and watch a horrid holiday movie together in that time, and though John had done an admirable job of keeping Mycroft in check and managing Sherlock’s moods simultaneously, they were both still teetering on the edge of their tempers.
Sherlock cleared his throat. "I suppose it's the least I can do after... all that. I can attempt to make this event easier on you."
Lololol this is what happens when Lilo decides to make up case details out of the blue. I hope that made even a tiny bit of sense. The details of the case aren't relevant to the story at all, so nbd if it doesn't.
Sherlock opened his mouth to reply, but Mummy interrupted the impending rant with swift efficiency. “It’s a little last minute extra something for Mrs. Hudson, dear. Do reminder her to open it as soon as she gets home, will you? It’s quite an urgent gift.”
John jumped as a hand slid over the small of his back and settled on his hip, one long finger weaving easily through the belt loop on his jeans.
And it was frightfully easy from there. The conversation turned to reminiscing about their time overseas, their exploits on leave both at home and abroad, and studiously avoiding the time since discharge for the most part. Except for John, of course, who had plenty to share. He regaled the group with stories from their cases, with additions and corrections from Sherlock where appropriate. They drifted closer and closer, John's arm around the back of Sherlock's chair and Sherlock's arm wound around his waist, until they were pressed together from shoulder to knee, sharing sips of Sherlock's third scotch while the others shared a story from their last tour, after John was discharged.
Sherlock carries right along with his prancing and sniffing, though a tiny smile quirks at the corner of his mouth. “Since I got engaged,” he replies, dropping to the ground to look more closely at the victim’s blood-darkened hair.
John captured Sherlock’s wandering finger in the crook of his own, used it to pull Sherlock into him as he tripped up the stoop of 221B, his back to the door.
Then the clinking of utensils against pint glasses filled their whole corner of the pub, and John looked up to find the whole army contingent watching them with wolfish grins.
Ella’s “self-compassion” exercises tell me I should frame these things differently, like I’m talking to a friend I love rather than myself. I’m not horrible, I’ve just been struggling with my identity and my past and my grief over Sherlock’s death and a hundred other things for so long. It’s bound to wear a person down. My mistakes are understandable and forgivable. I am working to get better and I have a lot of progress to be proud of.
to him. So I thought I’d try this. Spending quality time together doing something a little different. He’s probably going to realize five seconds after we get there. Hell, probably before we even leave. I’m wearing my date shoes, aren’t I? I need to go change my shoes—”
The rating will increase tomorrow. It'll either be M or E, but... let's be honest. It's me. It's probably going to be explicit as hell.
Mycroft’s forbidding expression didn’t waver, though he remained in his seat. He watched John for a long, silent moment, considering.
“I’ve been in love with you for so long, and it’s so automatic to hide it now, it’s like I’ve… forgotten how to let it…”
“Come on,” he said, nudging Sherlock’s shoulder with a smile. “Let’s ditch these cases. Your mother is not someone to keep waiting.”
“My grandmother used to visit and cook elaborate French feasts for New Year’s Eve and Day when I was a child. I hear Mummy still cooks oysters and scallops. They used to do foie gras, too, before they decided it was inhumane.”
Minding Watson was a thoroughly satisfying and engaging way to spend the day, and SH believes this trial run was successful enough that JHW will consider SH a viable source of child care in the future. Future engagements will likely be far less peaceful, as Watson is rarely as perfectly well behaved as she was today, but SH
comment, and John shot him an apologetic look, mouthing a desperate ‘sorry’. Sherlock didn't look bothered, exactly, though. His cheeks were even redder than before, his eyes a bit glazed over, dazed... dilated.
Sherlock grabbed John’s hand and yanked him out the door. “Thank you, Angelo, but we have plans. Good night!”
“The man on the end: naughty. You can see the tan of his missing wedding band from here, even in winter. Fake tan
Sherlock nodded and turned away, not trusting himself to speak. He wanted to slide closer, put his hand on the small of John’s back again, see if he would press himself close like before. He was flushed with warmth, though, and the fire had caught well, throwing off waves of heat. He no longer had the excuse of warming up by the fire after a chilly winter evening case, the icy bite having faded completely from his body in the wake of
“Yes. We will.” John hummed and threaded a hand into Sherlock’s dark curls. “I think you need to call your parents. They’ll want to know they’re going to have a granddaughter.”
My beta reader, Ladymacphisto, is 100% responsible for picking all the attire and flowers and stuff for the wedding. I am utterly hopeless at that kind of thing! A thousand thanks, LA, and sorry for sending you down the rabbit hole <3
“You’re free to do as you like, John,” he said, but his heart obviously wasn’t in it. He couldn’t even meet John’s eyes. John’s heart
"Call me if you change your mind, beautiful," Iain said. Then he leaned up and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s, a brief kiss that lingered, then lingered some more, edging quickly into something else altogether until a pointed clearing of John’s throat cut them off. When he leaned away, Iain let out a breath and shook his head ruefully.
Then John turned around, his eyes locking onto Sherlock immediately, as if they always knew where to find him.
[The paper crumples in SH’s hand, and he looks down as if he’d forgotten it was there. He scrambles to untie the ring, which JW takes from him and slides onto his finger. SH looks down at his hand with the ring, smiling]
“And why, John? Why is that? Come on, give me the rest. Or can you still not say it?” she said. Goading him. Testing him.
He couldn’t quite bring himself to do it elsewhere, this exorcism. Not at the shop to the man ahead of him in line. Not to the police officers crowded around wreckage and flesh. Not to the people passing on the street below his window.
John climbed the stairs to 221b with the plain white envelope in his hand, letting the sounds and smells of home draw him up and soothe his anxiously beating heart. After two weeks of tucking everything back into proper places, of filling cold bare walls and forlorn bookshelves, they were still nowhere near done. Their home had begun to take shape, a form both familiar and subtly different: all the same books and papers, the same seemingly random assortment of curios and oddities, and yet…
who provided gorgeous artwork to be embedded in chapters 67 and 83, and also drew fanart for chapter 58. What talent and creativity! You are so appreciated. <3
That same smile in return, with a squeeze from the hand around his waist. "It's okay with me," Sherlock said again.
I’m not magically fixed. I’m not all better. I might still slip. We still have challenges ahead. But if we wait to be whole, to be healed, to be perfect? We’ll never make it. Maybe at this point it’s about accepting each other’s brokenness, loving anyway, and working together to move forward. I’m working hard to be the man I want to be. The kind of man you deserve. And if you’ll give me the honor, I will work to deserve you every day for the rest of my life.
“Herd him down the next alley on the left, John,” Sherlock said, just loud enough to be heard over their pounding footfalls.
You can skip tomorrow’s chapter without missing any plotty things, except what John gives Sherlock for Christmas, which I’ll be sure to put in the author’s notes. Thank you again for your patience. I hope this has been worth the wait. More coming soon.
Sherlock turned up his coat collar with a snap and lifted his chin. “Oh, I suppose we could oblige. It is the holidays, after all.”
Sherlock smiled down at his phone, then pocketed it, resisting the urge to reply. John would obsess over it, wondering if his lack of reply meant he was smoking like a chimney. Perhaps it would bring him back sooner. Perhaps he’d be thinking about Sherlock all day because of it.
“Who, John? Where? And why should I bother when I have someone right here—” he held up the business card, “—who has already offered? We had fun. It was fine. He’s a bit of a bastard, but so am I, as you’ve told me on numerous occasions. I
“I don’t know if I’m getting old or if it’s just your influence rubbing off on me,” he said, “but I have no patience for starstruck kids anymore.” He drank deeply, eyeing Sherlock over the rim of the cup.
The question and her sudden attention seemed to catch Sherlock off-guard, but he nodded. “Yes. Once.”
John halted with his back to Sherlock, his hand still buried in his hair. That was... exactly the sort of information he'd been fishing for when he started this conversation. It only just occurred to him that he hadn't actually expected it to work. Or rather, he hadn't actually expected there to be anything to learn.
Which brings us, as always, to John. Sherlock has been aware of the nature and depth of his feelings for John for years, but his conversation with Greg helped him admit things that he wants for himself: to be a husband to John and a father to John’s daughter. Even now, he appears quite bashful, almost ashamed, to want these things. When I asked whether he’d spoken to John about his feelings yet he said no, but blushed and hid his face as a smile started to take over. Apparently John asked him to have dinner tonight, alone, and Sherlock is doing everything he can to avoid getting his hopes up, but he’s nervous, excited, and happier than I’ve ever seen him. He attempted to present me with another set of notes on the pants and shirts he owns and their associated effect on John, but patient confidentiality prevents me from getting involved to that degree.
Sherlock watched from the hallway behind the kitchen as John studied his glass of scotch, the remainder of the bottle on the table at his elbow. The glass was still quite full, about at the level John typically filled it to. Untouched? Or possibly a second glass, a third? He sat in Sherlock’s chair, rather than his own—what could be deduced from that? Possibilities unspooled in a thousand directions, but all of them led to a singular desire to say something, to rip the drink away and shake him and place himself for consumption instead.
John scrawled his messy doctor’s signature on each form with a complicated weight in his chest. He didn’t want her. He didn’t miss her. Everything had been a lie between them. And here they were, signing away the last year of pain and frustration, whisking it away like dust on the mantle. A few pieces of paper, and a whole marriage no longer existed.
CONGRATS GUYS!! So happy to see you both so happy! It has been great to follow your story for the past seven years!
John, with this ring I am wholly yours. All that I am, I give to you. All that I have, I share with you. I promise to love you, to be faithful, honest, and loyal in all times and circumstances, and to hold our daughter in my heart always. May this ring be a constant reminder of my commitment to you both.
John grinned at her, then slid a hand up Sherlock’s arm in a comforting gesture. “I am, don’t worry! It’s just for one night. I
John shook his head. “I haven’t looked yet. I thought we should… find out together. If we’re going to be parents.”
-course. Sherlock shouldered his way past people without a care, to shouts of “Merry fucking Christmas, wanker!” and other colorful greetings, until he finally stumbled onto the correct platform. He scanned the faces, intent and focused—not John, not John, cheating on her husband, bought a puppy for Christmas, not John, not John.
We gave a press conference yesterday that covered all the details of the Serviceman Stalker case, which you can view
John had doubted he had any actual say in the matter. Mummy would push the issue anyway, no matter what.
And when Sherlock tugged him back toward the bedroom, half-dressed and flushed, John kept their lips sealed together and went, free and wanting and ready. He took Sherlock to bed, wrapped him up in his arms, and for the first time let himself believe with his whole heart.
"I think that's up to you," he said, slipping a hand under Sherlock's suit jacket and letting it drift down his back to the waistband of his posh trousers before hooking his thumb there. "It goes as far as you want, and no further. So you have to tell me, Sherlock. Is this still for show?"
I can get for you, Doctor?” Mycroft asked. He feigned put-upon annoyance, but John could see echoes of the Mycroft from the plane. The one who, defeated and shaken, had asked John to “look after him, please.” John gestured at the tiny table’s other end.
The second the front door closed downstairs, Sherlock set down his violin and swept over to John. One hand immediately found its way to John’s upper arm, Sherlock’s default gesture of affection. Their resolve to wait grew more difficult to maintain by the day, but new touches and closeness provided some measure of comfort. John let his forehead fall against Sherlock’s shoulder and just breathed for a long moment.
The buildings had been abandoned for years; the roof was a warzone of scrap metal and used needles, but they were right along the flight path of the enormous C-17s that carried British troops to and from their stations abroad. They were a forgotten piece of London, unwanted, an eyesore to some.
John Watson is a new man. I have rarely seen such a dramatic change in a client in such a short time, but John has truly come into his own. I gave he and Sherlock back-to-back appointments today at their request to make transportation and child care easier. Like last time, they exchanged Rosie Watson in the lobby, though their interaction was completely lacking in last week’s repressed tension. They were comfortable, happy, and exchanged a quick kiss before John followed me into the office.
They were seated, mostly still, but a maelstrom of light and motion swirled between them. That evening they had run, they’d fought, they’d joined the flow of London in all its chaotic glory.
. Sherlock allowed a tiny smile to pull at his mouth when John stepped up behind him, pyjama pants whispering against the rug.
And Sherlock took an easy breath in, turned to John, and pulled the bottle from his hands, letting their fingers brush and tangle together.

The phone call and case were like a dash of ice water after their intimate dinner. John had glared at the phone when it appeared in Sherlock’s hand, but his irritation softened at Sherlock’s slight hesitation, the cut of his eyes over to John’s before accepting the case.
"We should really go see your parents," he said, and went for attempt number three. He slid his hand onto Sherlock's thigh under the table and squeezed. "Give them a Christmas that doesn't involve them being drugged, don’t you think?"
John let his hand fall away from Sherlock, suddenly needing distance. He propped his hands on his hips and spoke to Sherlock’s chest.
“Oh, it was no trouble, dear. I know Sherlock would never let me meet any of his friends otherwise,” she said with a charming grin, and Greg was instantly swept up into the Holmes clan. Sherlock tipped his head back and groaned, until John’s fingers tangled through his and brought him back to attention.
“What are you doing here?” he all but spat when John drew close enough. “She was obviously quite willing. Or did you get her number for later instead? You needn’t have bothered. She’ll quite happily take you back to her place right now, though I’ll warn you she has a rather large dog and her apartment will be a wreck.”
“The second batch,” Mycroft continued, “deals with custody of the child. Legally, we are handling this like a surrogacy. Since a mother cannot sign her rights away until the child is six weeks old, we are dating these forms for March of this year. Mary has agreed to sign the forms now so they may be filed at the appropriate time without the need to consult her again. There are two forms here. The first one says Mary agrees to relinquish all parental rights over the child. The second grants full parental rights to Sherlock Holmes.”
Mummy reached across the table to take his hand. “And you have us now, and we love you to pieces, so you never have to worry about that again. Now, who wants pie?”
Sherlock’s face broke out into a grin even as his breath hitched once, twice. He let the words hang in the air for a moment, let them have their own space and time, before he nudged his nose against John’s and spoke his own confession.
“There’s plenty. Come on,” he said, sliding off John’s lap. He let his pyjama bottoms fall to the floor, stripped his shirt off, stared straight into John’s eyes... then turned and walked away. John’s gaze followed him the whole way to the stairs, the sway of his hips,
Random bonus chapter, because most people on tumblr voted that they'd rather die extra hard tonight and have one of tomorrow's chapters bumped up to today. Uh. Hope you're still okay with that.
“That’s Lestrade! We have a case!” Sherlock darted into the kitchen and snagged John by the wrist, dragging him backwards away from Mummy and her snake charmer’s words. “So sorry, Mummy, but the work calls. John and I will be back before Christmas morning, but—”
This part I’m almost sure you’ve deduced already, but… yeah, my dad was pretty horrible to Harry and I. He beat us, especially me, and he was always accusing me of being gay because of the music I listened to, the sports I played, the friends I had. So, I have to apologize for all the times over the years that I’ve shouted that I wasn’t gay like the idea horrified me. It was never because I had a problem with it. It was because every time someone got anywhere close to questions of my sexuality, it hit on all of this mess in my head, and it was like a roaring rage inside my skull. Now I realize that rage was my father screaming at me that no son of his would be a filthy queer and I needed to get my shit straight or he’d kill me himself. So I brushed it off, justified it. Men were only for in the army or a fumble while drunk because everyone does that, don’t they? Don’t they?
: Sherlock, with this ring I am wholly yours. All that I am, I give to you. All that I have, I share with you. I promise to love you, to be faithful, honest, and loyal in all times and circumstances, and to hold our daughter in my heart always. May this ring be a constant reminder of my commitment to you both.
don’t deserve to be happy yourself? You don’t deserve to live? Why don’t you think you deserve good things?
John buried his hands in Sherlock’s hair and pressed their foreheads together, taking in all the smells and sounds of home, of 221B and Sherlock.
“You never would have shown up if I hadn’t gotten John to bring you and you know it.” With that, she turned her back on her son to wrap John in a long motherly hug.
Greg knows his mouth is hanging open in that way that Sherlock loves to make fun of, but he can’t seem to stop himself. He shakes his head once, then again. “Would anyone like to enlighten me?”
A faint whiff of cinnamon and nutmeg followed John into the cluttered kitchen—a delivery of Mrs. Hudson’s spiced scones could be expected that afternoon, then, excellent—and a pile of mail dropped unceremoniously next to his left elbow. All but the cheery red envelope that John held back, glimpsed from the corner of Sherlock’s eye. Not that he was looking.
And he trembled. Sweated. Studied John with wide, watchful eyes as he gathered his scraps and tied them tight, hid them away.
“He took such advantage of my boy,” she continued, “but of course Sherlock wouldn’t hear a word against him. We all make mistakes in our early relationships, though. What about your first boyfriend, John?”
There’s a bit more, just one more thing I have to say… but it has to wait. Tomorrow is my last day of anger management, then I have Ella’s evaluation the next day. Can you wait that long? It feels impossible, but I have to. I have to. It’s important. Essential. I have to.
Sherlock glanced over. “They’re likely to be embarrassingly clingy with you tonight. I hope you’re prepared.”
“Let them. I want them to,” he said, his voice rough, and he gave a weak laugh. “I should be so lucky, that people would think you’d want to be with me.”
"This is utterly moronic," he spat, and stormed out of Mrs. Hudson's kitchen, slamming the door behind him.
John leaned back, too, and tangled his fingers together with Sherlock’s. “We’re celebrating. I have officially never been married. Voided. Just like that. I’m free.”
“No. It’s not. We aren’t,” Sherlock answered, half-surprising himself by actually talking about it. Lestrade’s eyes went wide for a second before he mastered himself, evidently just as surprised as Sherlock. Bolstered, Sherlock took a deep breath and took a leap, ignoring the panic twisting in his stomach.
“Damn it, John, I swear if you don—GOD!” Sherlock choked on the rest of the sentence as John finally thrust in earnest, sinking fully into him in three long, slow strokes, groaning through his cocky smirk. Sherlock melted back into the soft duvet and pushed back against John, taking him deep, his mouth open and panting. He felt… open, flayed, like he’d broken apart and every bit of his love and pleasure pooled around him for John to see. Sherlock reached up, pulled John close and just breathed, just let John fill him up and ground him and utterly
Sherlock woke on Christmas morning with his nose in sandy greying hair and a sleep-warm, pliant John in his arms. The mess of soft grey sheets cradled them in a cocoon of their mingled scents and body heat while John’s gentle, even breaths puffed against Sherlock’s neck. Bright morning light spilled through the window—after eight o’clock, by the positioning. Mummy and Father would be expecting their Christmas morning festivities, but the idea of leaving his current position was completely unappealing to Sherlock.
His eyes locked back on John, tight with remembered hurt, as John stepped in front of Sherlock to shield him. “I’ve seen your blog. I know what the score is. You may not know it, but you’re in love with him, Johnny.”
If you all take nothing else from this case, I hope you’ll come away with a better idea of what our servicemen and women go through upon returning home from active duty.

course of action John had picked up on—the practical one, or the desired one? Both were dangerous in this case, so Sherlock opted for the more emotionally neutral option.
Her gaze slid to Sherlock and burned like a laser sight into the center of his forehead. “He’s all yours.”
“I’m truly sorry, Brian. I know it doesn’t help anything now, but I do regret the way I treated you. I don’t do that anymore.”
Remember the time he broke all your queen albums and threw them in the fireplace? never thought a burning record would smell like that
John dropped his bag and wrapped both arms around Sherlock’s lean frame, one hand on the back of his neck, the other at the curve of his waist. Sherlock hesitated, then brought his arms around John’s shoulders and leaned down to rest his temple against the side of John’s head. John’s arms tightened into a fierce hug, and Sherlock was on the verge of cracking wide open, his heart displayed, everything he felt for this man there for all to see.
“Mummy,” Sherlock snapped again, visibly horrified. John waved him off, though, and met Mummy’s gaze with a slight nod, his heart aching for the young, vulnerable Sherlock who had his heart broken. Sherlock deserved his honesty after that revelation. Time to fulfill his part of the plan.
John licked his lips again and stared straight into his eyes, unflinching. Braced to accept his fate.

“It’ll be fine,” John said, squeezing gently. “A holiday party with our friends will spread the attention around so your parents won’t be so focused on you all the time. It’ll give you a bit of a break from them.”
He’s so good with her and when I watch them together my chest feels like it could crack open and spill out all the things I

“I never would have checked a hiding place so high above your head. Very clever indeed, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock said. He let his lean body slide against John’s as he stretched up for the top cabinet and drew down… a bottle of scotch and rizla paper?
"Oi, Sherlock," Lestrade said, clapping a hand on his shoulder and suddenly looking far more sober than he had a moment ago. "You're going to want to open that now, mate. Promise."
They walked like that for a full block, silent, with John too terrified to so much as glance at Sherlock. His heart thundered in his ears, and his skin prickled with panic, the half-remembered terror of being outed against his will that he hadn’t had to deal with since his days with Brian. As soon as they turned the corner onto the next street, Sherlock’s arm fell away and he stepped back, much further than he’d been before the encounter.
Then they burst into giggles, wrapping arms around each other as they laughed and laughed, until the laughing turned to gasping, to grinding, to hands wandering and hot mouths demanding and
Sherlock grimaced. “No. Mummy will be revolting. Are you absolutely positive you wouldn’t rather stay here?”
It was hateful, and he so desperately wished John were there to mitigate the terrible mundanity of it all.
[GL leaves the frame of the shot at 09:23:02, looking back over his shoulder twice before he does. SH’s hand on RW’s back moves to cup the back of her head and he holds her closer, burying his nose in her hair and closing his eyes tight. JW drifts closer and lifts a hand to RW’s back, covering the spot SH’s hand just vacated.]
Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock caught the quirk of a small smile at the corner of John’s mouth. “All right, Sherlock. I’ll stay, if you’re sure you want me to.”
For those few who don’t know me, I’m Greg Lestrade, Best Man and peddler of criminal cases to these two nutters seated before us. I’ll keep this short, since God knows they’ve taken long enough getting us here, torturing all of us with their desperate pining in the process.
"Sherlock?" John said, shuffling a step closer and letting his hand drift along Sherlock's arm again. "You okay?"
, tucked away in taped up boxes. No lab equipment, no files, papers, illegally-kept police evidence; no dishes on the shelves in the kitchen, no kettle on the counter. Sherlock’s violin, sealed up in its case and resting atop a box marked
Every plane that passed, no matter the direction or distance, he sent love to it. He pictured the troops in their worn fatigues, catching brief snatches of nightmare-pocked sleep in their cramped airplane seats, and he loved them and loved them and loved them. He imagined every bit of feeling, every flutter of his heart, every bit of grit in the lens, all of it pouring from his chest to theirs. His brain to their brains. It was a game he played.
"No," he said, drawing back slowly, letting his mouth drag over Sherlock's cheek. "Let's stay. If that's okay with you."
Sherlock sat up straighter, his gaze intent. “John, I swear to you right now I will never touch drugs again for as long as I live. You know why I did it, and with Rosie here I would never—”
With their stomachs full and their bill paid, John held the door open for Sherlock and followed him out into the crisp night air, the low level hum of contentment following them from the restaurant. Their shoulders brushed with every step, and John bit back a smile. The evening felt
Clinking of graduated cylinders, knocking of tupperware. Squeak (cabinet open), thwack (cabinet closed).
“Crystal,” John replied as he pulled back from the hug, catching a glimpse of Sherlock over his mother’s shoulder in the moment before he mastered his expression. It was just a brief thing, a stolen snatch of time, but Sherlock’s face had gone unbearably soft at the sight of his parents embracing John. John already felt at home in a way he never had before, not even with his own family, and Sherlock’s expression seemed to say
[Sherlock Holmes, John Watson, and Rosamund Watson enter the field of view at 16:12:58. RW is seated in a pushchair steered by JW, while SH walks at their side.]
“Oh, but it’ll be so nice to see them before I leave, Sherlock, and more time with family can never be a bad thing!”
At the end of our session, I thanked John for his comments about mental health in both his press conference and blog post from last week. They are yet more evidence of his new openness and healing, and I’m pleased to see him passing that healing on to others.
: John’s reported suicidal ideation has diminished over the course of our last few sessions, but is still occasionally present to a lesser degree. Support from his best friend and improved outlook toward his daughter appear to be aiding his recovery.
I haven’t been able to leave this section blank for John since before his best friend’s suicide in 2012. I’m pleased to finally do so again today. I will continue to monitor for suicidal ideation carefully, considering his past, but John truly seems to be out of danger for good this time.
Sherlock gasped something like a sob and ground back against John as if he could get any closer, pull John any deeper. John pressed kisses all over Sherlock’s shoulder blades as he drew slowly back, then thrust in again, slow at first, then faster, faster, Sherlock’s hand flying over his own cock. A shift of angle, a firm slap on Sherlock’s gorgeous arse, then another, and John felt him start to come from the inside. Sherlock’s inner muscles fluttered as his cries became one long moan, John’s name, and his come spilled over his fist and onto the rug. John fucked him through it, letting the maddening electric pleasure he’d been holding at bay drive his hips, his cock into Sherlock’s arse. He pulled Sherlock’s arsecheeks apart to watch his cock sink in over and over, and it only took once, twice, three more times, and then the wave hit him, tearing a shout from his lungs as he filled Sherlock’s arse and pressed his forehead to Sherlock’s heaving back.
“There’s a snowstorm coming. John is leaving now, but he might not make it before the storm hits. He could be stuck out there for Christmas.”
Fine. I’ll tell you something that not even Mycroft knows. He was too busy climbing the ranks of Her Majesty’s Service and serving abroad to notice at the time and I find his assumptions useful on occasion, so I’ve never corrected him. But it is… relevant.
In the end, Mummy had barely needed to nudge them at all, it seemed. A romantic atmosphere, a shared bedroom and its implications, a few gifts—but most of all, the conversation they’d needed to have. Sherlock had dated before. John had been with men. Now Sherlock was melting under his fingertips with a purr John could feel through the cheek pressed against his knee, and he could already see how the night could end: confessions and shared breath and sweat and skin,
John barked a harsh laugh. “She lied about everything else. Why not that, too? We were always careful. I have to know.”
We’re glad to see you and Rosie so happy, John. Have a wonderful time on your vacation!! Xoxoxoxoxox
“I love you,” he whispered, and leaned in to press the words into his cheek, his earlobe, his hair. “I love you, Sherlock, so much, for so long.”
He tugged at the open edges of Sherlock’s coat, gripped the dark wool in his fists and kept his eyes leveled at Sherlock’s chest for the space of two long breaths. Then he lifted his gaze.
I’m not yet comfortable removing the suicidal indicator, considering how recent his last brush with suicide was, but he seems to be developing much healthier attitudes. More in notes summary.
Sherlock clutched the edge of the worktop with his eyes closed, taking breath after breath into lungs that refused to feel full. John’s gentle scuffling footsteps through the ceiling above played a rhythmic counterpart: over to the dresser, back to the bed, creak of the mattress. The wine glasses sat atop the counter, still and waiting, empty, awaiting the wine’s flushed red touch.
feel of Sherlock squeezing around his finger nearly did it anyway. The angle was awful, and his wrist hurt almost immediately, but John would have sooner marched back onto a battlefield in Afghanistan than stop the slide of his finger inside Sherlock. It was impossible to seek out his prostate, but Sherlock didn’t seem to care, just begged for another finger and moaned at the stretch. He leaned back until he was nearly sitting up straight, riding John’s fingers like his life depended on it, eyes closed and head thrown back in total abandon.
[SH sits back down on the couch as MH leaves with RW. JW closes the door to the sitting room behind them and turns back to SH. SH smiles shyly up at him.]
At that, John’s unaffected facade cracked open with unrestrained mirth. His high-pitched giggle, so at odds with his dangerous side, never failed to make Sherlock lose control of his facial expressions; his eyes crinkled, the corners of his mouth turned up, and his heart leapt wildly in his chest at John laughed and laughed, finally coming to rest his hands on Sherlock’s hips.
John took a step closer, until their breaths puffed into a shared cloud of fog between them. He waited for Sherlock to meet his eyes again before speaking.
[He leans back and reaches inside his coat, withdrawing an envelope. He looks at it, turns it over in his hands, then meets Sherlock’s eyes]
I know you don’t think much of my skills as a writer but for better or worse, it’s much easier for me to get my thoughts out on a page or a screen than to speak them out loud. I hope you can tolerate my writing long enough to hear what I have to say. So to speak.
Sherlock was in the shower, still nursing a headache and fighting the black weight of depression, but physically better than he’d been since before the plane. The buprenorphine had worked exactly as intended—relief from the opioid withdrawal symptoms to the point where Sherlock was very nearly functional again, though John regretted that he couldn’t do the same for the cocaine withdrawal. Distraction, sunlight, exercise—he’d make sure Sherlock got through the day, through the cravings and hopelessness and the toxicity of his own thoughts.
“I love you,” John gasped in return, burying his face in Sherlock’s neck and placing kiss after kiss on his neck and shoulders. “God, I love you.”
“I’m making you a better offer,” John said, stepping closer still. He plucked the business card from Sherlock’s fingers and tossed it on the desk, then took Sherlock’s hand in his.
“It was recommended to me. The woman at the shop called it…” he hesitated, felt his cheeks heat a bit. “…full-bodied and seductive. Perfect for a night in.”
He hoped so. He hoped it was obvious to everyone that after all this time, they belonged to each other, that they moved together and around each other with the easy familiarity of years and love.
“John,” he murmured, pulling him from his memories with a hand on his shoulder. John blinked and looked up at him, the painful haze slowly fading from his eyes. Sherlock smiled, just a little, before moving to the door and pulling on his coat.
: I was diagnosed with PTSD after being shot in the shoulder in the line of duty and suffered from severe depression at several points thereafter. It continued to affect me in subtle and unexpected ways for years after, but my most immediate need for mental health care was in the weeks and months after my return to civilian life. I was seeing a therapist weekly as required by my discharge agreement, but it wasn’t enough. I don’t mind telling you that if I hadn’t met Sherlock and joined him in his work at just the right moment, I might not be sitting here today.
“It’s not about trust, it’s about ethics and…” John sighed. “Oh, fine, I’ll call Mycroft. I want to read up and double-check myself on interactions first, though, maybe get a second opinion.”
"Oi, mate, you been living under a rock?" Bill said with a mighty slap to John's bad shoulder. One would think the nurse who'd patched that wound up would know better. "That there's the famous Sherlock Holmes, the detective Johnny's been running with since he got back!"
Hallucinations [  ]   Delusions [  ]   Sleep Problems [X]   Appetite Problems [  ]   Drug/Alcohol Abuse [X]
John took a sip of the scotch to give himself a moment to think. Admittedly, he'd latched onto the idea and not questioned it much since, going with his initial gut reaction. There was plenty of truth in it, though.
"You guys planning to stand out in the cold all night?" Molly asked, her cheeks rosy from wine. "Come on in!"
By the time they’d finished several small plates and two excellent drinks each, John had relaxed enough to enjoy the whole point of the night: quality time with Sherlock. His gaze drifted from Sherlock’s sharp gray eyes down the line of his neck, lingering on the dip of his clavicle and the straining buttons over his chest as that rich voice carried him from course to course. These were his favorite sorts of moments, the moments where their friendship was an effortless flow of inappropriate laughter and charming banter. When the sous chef arrived to take them on their private tour it was like emerging from a hazy half-asleep daydream, their own private bubble.
A shiver wracked Sherlock’s body beside him, and John pulled it all in. Tucked it away. Wrapped it tight with gauze and white tape, made a cast for his heart to hold the pieces together. Not now. Not the time.
: Sherlock has been sleeping more lately, though it’s due to lingering fatigue from cocaine withdrawal rather than a desire for a more healthy sleep schedule. During detox, his sleep was frequently disturbed by vivid dreams, which have lessened in the past week. He has never eaten with anything that could be considered regularity, but some of the gauntness from his recent self-abuse is beginning to fade. Withdrawal symptoms have been absent for a full week with no relapse. 24 hour monitoring by friends through the worst of the withdrawal was effective.
So like… if I fail to solve a case, or even lots of cases… do I not deserve to live? Does the whole rest of my life not matter?
I’m happy to be home, Sherlock. Wholly, completely home, with no obligations elsewhere. This was the last piece of the puzzle, for me.
He opened his eyes and found pale green staring right back at him, inches from his own. His one hand, curled around Sherlock’s back to drag over hidden scars, pulled tighter until his forehead could tip against Sherlock’s shoulder… and he breathed.
“I know what it’s like to have something to lose, and to lose it,” he said, fighting the instinct to snap something caustic and cruel instead. “I know what it’s like to plan John’s wedding. To watch him marry someone else, then to watch
John gave a helpless little laugh. Mummy couldn’t have possibly chosen three more couple-y gifts, except maybe a two-person sleeping bag. He wouldn’t have put that past her, though. He shot her a quick look with raised eyebrows
A subdued “okay” was all he got in response. He slipped his hands into his pockets, rocked back on his heels once, then fled the room, chased out by unspoken longing and a heavy debt owed.

Lestrade clapped him on the shoulder, and Sherlock whirled around just in time to see John’s eyes snap back up to his face, then over to Lestrade’s. The two exchanged pleasantries, laughed heartily about something or other, but Sherlock’s brain was fixated on that single moment, the briefest second where John’s eyes slid up to his face after lingering significantly lower.
to hear you admit some things out loud. Would you please? For me, John? You know what I want to hear.” She put on a syrupy sweet voice and batted her eyelashes, and it took everything John had not to recoil. He shot a look at Mycroft, who waved a hand from his place against the far wall.
