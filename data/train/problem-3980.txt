Gabriel winks as Mara disappears through a doorway to whatever lies beyond the bar in this place. “Anyway,” he continues. “Mara says Dean’s presence ain’t a secret. Everyone wants to get their hands on the Righteous Man, though I can’t say I understand the attraction. Me, I’m more about the ‘climb ‘em like a tree’ type—”

familiar and yet so brand-new pressed up against his own flesh, this body that sometimes still feels like a loaner.
The door to the bathroom swings open before Castiel can quite manage to stack the last box on top of the pile. Dean strolls out looking
night and every morning could be filled with the kind of wildly satisfying sex and submission they’ve shared, it’s these last few hours he’s spent with Dean that Castiel has enjoyed the most.
Smiling softly to herself, Billie clicked her fingers. In her palm, a glass sand timer appeared. It was deceptively simple—the outer frame made up of molecules that humans had not yet discovered, found deep in black holes and in the rings of a distant planet that their telescopes had not yet even spied. The forging of the glass had been the heat of the first sun, and the swirling gas within the inspiration for the first nebula. Despite its importance, it was plain. And it held a simple plaque at the front, golden and gleaming, ever-polished by the fabric within the sleeves of Death themself. The name carved into it had changed a few times, as fashions came and went, but it only ever referred to one being.
Taking advantage of the way the wiry man stumbles, the way his knife-brandishing arm swings wildly, Dean dives forward, instead of going for the door. He twists Alastair’s arm behind his back until it
Room 201 turns out to be a large hall—auditorium-style and filled to the brim with mostly-light-skinned men sitting bolt-upright as they listen to the person quite effectively commanding their attention.
“Ugh, what am I doing?” he asks aloud, slapping both palms across his face and wiggling his whole body around in abject frustration. “Arghhh,” he groans, before tearing his hands away and stomping back towards the bedroom where he does not pass go, does not collect $200. He beelines directly for the bed he usually shares with Cas, strips, and crawls under the covers, pulling them up over his head and tucking them in so that he can’t escape.
His fingers curl into a fist except for one that stays pointed somewhat menacingly in Castiel’s direction.
“You make me crazy.” Castiel narrows his eyes, affronted, but Dean holds up a hand. “You’re no picnic, Cas. You’re difficult, half the time you’re a brat.”
Perhaps Castiel should have seen this coming, the way Dean reacted just now, but in his defense, it’s been a long time since he’s encountered another person who’s built from the ground up to
About a month ago, Dean had nervously confessed his intentions to Sam, and both he and Jess (once they’d calmed down) had instantly volunteered to help Dean shop. They’d been inside the mall jewelry store for all of two minutes before the winner was spotted, perched on blue velvet inside the glass case, and the three of them were excitedly freaking out about how
The demon puked all down the front of his dirty, torn shirt, his stomach forcibly squeezing out the salt and holy water concoction that Dean had whipped up as a last minute-idea. As the last of it hung off his lip in a string of saliva and plopped down onto his heaving chest, the demon rasped, “He’s up the street. Just hang a left at Fuck You, Cunt Street. If you’ve hit Kill Yourself corner, you’ve gone too far.”
Dean shatters. He wants to cry. He wants to scream. He wants to destroy the lab, to burn his house to the ground, to pack it all in and call it a day. In his mind’s eye, he thinks about standing in the middle of Washington Square and screaming at the top of his lungs, “
They came in a few hours later, just as she'd expected. The cameras weren't necessary, not at the front door at least. They rode around in that dastardly truck, a vehicular beast she was coming to despise and recognize from sound alone. They came because they needed medical supplies, to restock, and because the fire from the pharmacy hadn't been subtle. She hoped that it would be the other two, the ones who had been there when the man had been injured—she wanted them all, but perhaps he would follow if she claimed them first; humans were so emotional, they did such things as that.
Sam’s hair falls into his face and he brushes it back reflexively, unbothered as he continues to focus on his work. He’s tattooing on the right side of the booth when Castiel joins the crowd of people watching, his eyes scanning over the photo-realistic back piece Sam is inking onto a muscular man sitting backward in the tattoo chair. The design mostly contains various skulls and thorny branches, nothing overtly elaborate or complicated, which is surprising. At first glance, the tattoo might even seem sort of generic, especially for a Winchester piece, but Castiel’s eyes clock the spark of magic Sam’s infusing from his gun into each and every line, and his own experience tells him that underestimating this tattoo would be a mistake.
Eventually, Sam appears in the doorway beside Naomi, a relieved smile gracing his tired face and barely any expression on hers. Dean stiffens, but Meg whispers to him that Naomi is always like that. According to them both, the surgery went well and Cas should be rolling into the ICU within the hour. Because of who Dean is, he’ll be allowed in right away. That’s a goddamn relief, since Dean was planning on fighting his way to Cas’ side come hell or high water and worrying about the consequences later.

be sporting that kicked-dog expression when he did. Expression didn’t match the attitude, though, and Dean would blame that later for the way he went along with it—at first, anyway.
“There’s no patrol,” Castiel argues, wondering even as the words leave his lips what the hell he’s doing. “They’ve all gone on to New Washington.”
Forcing himself to slap on a bright smile and to not dwell on his own bullshit feelings, Dean puts a hand on the small of Castiel’s back and leads him towards the mirror set-up. “Wait,” Castiel says suddenly, stopping short with his hand up. “Can you just…” He trails off, grabbing Dean’s free hand and maneuvering it up so that it’s covering his eyes. “There,” he says, sounding relieved. “I think it’s easier for me this way. I’m not so sure I can force myself to walk in front of those mirrors on my own, not looking straight at it.”
“Gossip travels fast in this community,” Sam replies with a levity Castiel resents. He knows that, of course he does (better than
“I have a gun,” Cas said vaguely, raising one arm loosely, waggling a handgun he held in his grasp. Dean could see the safety was on. “And it’s ‘brain’. ‘Brains’ is plural.”
After five hours of driving, of being monitored by Jo like she was frightened he’d launch himself out of the car, they arrived at camp. As soon as he could, as soon as she cut the engine and the others started to pile out of the cars and off the bikes, Castiel pushed open his door and began walking. His duffle could wait to be unpacked. He needed to be
The skin on Dean’s abdomen is caked with blood, sweaty and clammy beneath Castiel’s palms, his chest expanding and contracting with breathing that’s too fast and increasingly stuttered. It’s

pointing out how, if the point is to elevate the most marginalized voices, the obvious choice is for a Black omega to be at the helm.
Sam exchanged a look with Rowena, then back at the advancing mummies, silently shuffling their way through the galleries behind them. They both took off at a run for the open door, and the woman pulled them through and slammed it behind them.
Gabriel shrugged. “Damned if I know. Do I look like an ancient Atlantean to you? You’re the one who was sleeping with half the city, you’d know better than me.”
“Gabe?” Dean calls back, moving quickly to the edge of the fire escape and leaning far, far over the railing. “Oh shit—fuck,” he swears, disappearing down the steps in a flash of red flannel before Castiel can even swing a leg out after him.
The relieved look on Castiel’s handsome face would be enough for Dean to burn cities to the ground just to keep it there, more so as he leans forward to bring their mouths together once more and Cas meets him halfway.
Gabriel is standing off to the side, smoking a joint and looking frazzled, but Castiel is on a mission.
Sam starts coming along with Dean to rehearsals after that. At first, he seems awkward about being there, likely wondering if the cast and crew are judging him, or if they even want him there at all. He slumps in the seats at the back of the theater Crowley’s (

to look over at Cas and gauge where he’s at, but a much bigger part reminds him that he should be completely terrified at what he might see when he does.
If there’s one thing Dean can’t stand, it’s a spoiled snob with an entitled attitude. Give him anything else—
zombies were emerging from the trees, grunting and snarling in sync, their jerking movements sending a shockwave of terror down Anael’s middle. She felt cold with terror, despite gripping onto her sword and taking the lead, pulling the gang back into action as they approached the gates.
But when they all load up into Baby and set off, Dean can’t help but notice that (so far) there aren’t really any signs of apartment buildings or tents or anything that would potentially allow lots of people to maintain individual living spaces.
ask. The only thing Dean would lie to him about at this point would be his feelings about Cas himself, and only if Cas asked point-blank in a way Dean couldn’t dodge or divert. Not a cell of his being wants to be untruthful with Castiel, not anymore, not after everything he’s given Dean. But
on the meat of his ass. “Ouch!” Dean yelps, rolling over and sitting up, rubbing a hand protectively over his stinging skin as he does.
The city feels stark and bleak tonight, the biting cold that’s settled in over the past twenty-four hours not helping matters in the least. It’s almost too chilly for a thin shirt and leather jacket, but Castiel’s uber is already waiting when he steps outside, so despite the wind cutting straight through his clothes to his skin, Castiel forges on.
“Sure,” Dean nodded, his eyes scanning Cas’ facial features. The freckles and the blue eyes—looking magnificently bright in the majesty of sundown—pulled the oxygen from the cabin and made Dean momentarily forget about the depths of his fucked-up psyche. “But since you got your memories back, we’ve been alone, sure, but...around other people. And like I told you before, you’ve been weird, and it kinda breaks my heart, dude.”
“True, but why sink it rather than just blow it off the map? Maybe he kept it around in case he wanted to revisit it, use it in a new subplot? Regardless, you actually will be doing the driving this time. You’ve a link with the horn. After all, it’s your symbol carved into the bloody thing. Just sus out a direction and fly us that way.”
Freshly rinsed and (sort-of) coiffed, the two of them face each other, straightening out clothing and brushing off imaginary dirt and dust until they both look as presentable as they’re going to get.
Dean leans more and more heavily on his shoulder as time goes on. It can’t be much past noon (and with several miles to go) when Castiel has to sit them both down for a break that’s more than leaning against a convenient tree for a few minutes. He’s hesitant to do so, worrying that if Dean sits down, he may not get up again, but his own back is on
assholes want, would it be too much to ask you to get the hell on with it so I can go back to hating my life in peace?”
Three more patrol-less Saturdays and a small handful of party mix later, Castiel manages to negotiate the procurement of another item from Brynn, as well as apologize for the ruined piece (that she apparently never expected him to return, of course she didn’t). Dean loves it, naturally, refuses to let Castiel get anywhere near it, wears it under his regular clothing, and washes it carefully in the sink when he’s done. Much to his chagrin, Castiel more often sees it hung carefully by clothespins in the bathroom than he does on Dean himself.
“Hello to you too, Charlie,” he says to the empty space Charlie vacated and Castiel chuckles, stepping into it and dragging Dean in close. Without hesitation, his right hand goes to the small of Dean’s back, left hand confidently interlacing with Dean’s right, very sexy, very
Also, if you think they're recklessly crossing a lot of lines and boundaries for two idiots who couldn't even figure out they both wanted to spend the night together a few weeks ago, uh, they are.
And Cas would never understand how in the next moment, when he shuffled closer and opened the blanket up to Dean so they could share the warmth, how he made Dean realise that grieving together was better than grieving alone.
clearer in here. The air is less heavy, more breathable, and the room is much wider than the space in which Dean was trapped, so it’ll take longer to become smothering. Dean uses the adrenaline he’s built up from hacking through the wall to buoy him forward, dragging his body as fast as it will go across the space, as far away from the blaze as he can get.
Pretty sure it was fitted and forged in Hell itself. Definitely a gift, though, you know, mileage may vary on
“I know it’s hard to believe, but I haven’t always been the cute and cuddly guy you used to sleep one bunk over from. Gotta protect what’s mine.”
All in favor of blowing this popsicle stand? Let’s get home where I can press those buttons on top of some memory foam, instead of...
In fact, Cas’ broken, unconscious face flashes across his eyelids nearly every time he closes them—Dean
They’re headed to the smaller hospital just beyond the outskirts of the city so the ride is slightly longer than Castiel’s used to. When they’re five minutes out, he calls report in to the Emergency Department over the radio and faxes a copy of the EKG (normal, nothing acute going on that he can see) along with it. Since Mrs. Baxter seems to be the very picture of stable, Castiel disconnects her from the monitor to take her out of the rig and wheel her inside.
Right before the music starts and the wedding coordinator motions for him and Jo to start the long walk towards the altar, Dean glances over his shoulder to send a tipsy wink Cas’ way. Cas must be feeling pretty good too, because he doesn’t even admonish or scold Dean, just smiles softly and shakes his head before mouthing, “Behave.”
Clearing his throat a little, Dean’s oddly thankful that Bobby can’t see the way tears well up in his eyes at the familiar sound of his surrogate father speaking. Shaking it off, he squeezes the button on the mic clipped to his shoulder to open the channel. “Can’t get rid of me that easily, old man,” he retorts, though his snappy comeback comes out far less cocky than Dean was hoping.
With a map in their hands, gas in the tank of a mean-looking jeep, and each other as company, Cas and Dean had set off in search of this demon. They rode together with ease, despite the heavy conversation lurking over their shoulders. The bomb that Cas had dropped about the journey of their souls, together through existence, was kind of a big deal.
A quick glance down the perpendicular street shows Dean that it’s equally flooded with empty vehicles as thousands of people attempt to flee. They’re all trying to beat the looming deadline that half of them are likely not even conscious of yet. They’re aware that it’s happening, but not
The latter covers all of the previous topics and then some, but mostly lingers on a developing (and classified) international security issue, a senior leadership change in the Air Force, and several fiscal policy matters that are time and resource-sensitive.
“So…what’s up?” Dean asks, when his maybe-new-friend doesn’t automatically continue, still scanning the area behind them like she’s a covert spy instead. “Charlie, right? Gotta warn you, Charles, I’m workin’ real hard not to make a dirty joke about ‘unloading,’ but I’m sensing it wouldn’t be appreciated at the moment.”
Raising his eyebrows, Dean turns his hands over, opening them to take Cas’ in between his palms. The back of Cas’ hands are flecked with light blue paint, the color of their new bedroom. “Well, you know I’ll support you however I can, whatever you wanna do next. Any thoughts? There’s always stripping,” he suggests cheekily.
goddamn crickets, and Dean’s heart soars. Benny takes the opportunity to step forward and clap him on the shoulder. “Everyone who wants Dean?”
to take things to the next level, to follow through on his intended “gift” to Castiel. He gets his hands on Castiel’s shoulders, pushing him away and breaking their kiss with a
Instead of focusing on what’s coming, Dean thinks about the reasons behind why he gravitated towards the elements he did when he and Cas were planning this scene. Dean got into this thing with Cas first and foremost to get out of his damn head. Along the way, he’s found both relief and power in learning to reframe the way he approaches coping with his own perceived failings (whether real or imagined). He’s turned both pain and pleasure into a weapon wielded expertly by Castiel, that when used properly, has the power to carve Dean into the person he’s always secretly wished he could be.
It seems to have worked out—Castiel doesn’t know what exactly it is that Cain does these days, and he isn't sure that he wants to. He is aware that Cain maintains a low profile and resists allying himself with any group in particular, though, which were concepts they worked on together in therapy. From what he’s heard, when Cain
“Nonetheless,” Hannah chimes in. “Perhaps we should take the trail and conduct any further flying lessons on the ground. The town isn’t far. It won’t hurt to walk.”
“Hey,” Dean says off-handedly as he’s pulling on his boots, snapping his fingers like he’s just recalled an important thought. “Wasn’t there something you wanted to tell me? Something you wanted to talk about? I could swear we got interrupted last night, but I’ll admit,” he taps his temple, “It’s all kinda fuzzy.” He straightens up and suddenly, his expression becomes weirdly intense.
“I think it is,” Castiel says anyway, undeterred by Dean’s lack of participation in the conversation. “I think you’d get off on the idea of someone watching me take you, of being naked and vulnerable beneath my hands in public, or where others could happen by. I wouldn’t let anyone touch you, you know that well enough. You know that I’d protect you, surely, but do you know that I’d show you off? I’d be so proud Dean.” Castiel hums, his giant hands soothing tracks up and down Dean’s sides, encouraging him to slide back, to take more of the dildo, to rock against it until he can.
Perhaps he should let this bit go, but the transfer of power after Crowley showed up is still somewhat of a question mark in Castiel’s mind, one he feels strangely drawn towards sorting out. There’s just something about how it happened that doesn’t make
, Dean makes a disappointed noise. “Sure about that?” he asks, jerking his head towards the top of the doorframe they’re still standing in.
(Stay tuned until next week for Chapter 12, where MalMuses will fuck up all your feelings in the best way possible.)
As if Cas could read all that on his face, he smiled a little, hot breath ghosting over Dean’s lips. They’ve been close like this exactly twice in the time Dean’s known the guy, and while both other instances were equally charged, neither were sexy.
Castiel felt a spike of annoyance at their bickering, especially when he was moments from uncovering his memories and potentially finding a way to save Jack. Every moment he had to waste listening to Rowena and Dean get at each other’s throats was a moment wasted.
big. I wouldn’t blame you for not believing me, but as much as I’d do anything for Dean, keeping you out of the loop was the only thing I could do to protect you, too.”
As Sam and Dean reached the barrier, guns already in hand, the distant rumbling—the one that had definitely not been thunder—grew louder.
He finds himself shaking his head and cupping Cas’ jaw with one hand, kissing down the other side of his face with so much love, so much affection it feels as if it must be bursting out of him, all visible cartoon hearts and flowers.
He and Claire have come so far, and Castiel owes her so much more than he could ever think to repay. Perhaps Dean does too. After all, it’s Claire that has kept him human, made him soft in a world where he was all too determined to be hard.
Dean snorts when he thinks about it, but he’s smiling and there’s a warm, affectionate feeling filling up his chest. God, he loves Cas so damn much. For a minute, he thinks about going back down there, about actually
“I dunno, sunshine,” he replies, clicking his tongue against his teeth. “First you save my ass from those douchebags, taking on two of ‘em single-handedly. Then you bulk up like you’re thinking of getting into competitive bodybuilding, and now I find out you’re sporting more ink than an entire motorcycle club combined.”
Finally, as Dean continues to stare and flip through pages he’s read at least three times each with a persistently blank expression on his face, Castiel breaks.
preoccupied trying to figure out what the fuck is going on and what’s expected of him, here. None of this makes any sense, unless—
Stiff from the last few hours of endless paperwork, Castiel rolls his shoulders and makes his way over to the far wall of his office, the one that’s constructed completely out of glass. Floor-to-ceiling windows and a door that leads out onto a balcony, all overlooking the expanse of Hollywood Boulevard below, the city of Los Angeles as a whole, plus the surrounding hills and mountains beyond. On the other side of Novak Corp’s skyscraper, one can see all the way to the Pacific Ocean, one of the few buildings downtown that’s high enough and positioned properly to do so.
hurt him. Never said anything about intention. And if you’re really as oblivious as you’re playing right now, then I was right to say so. Honestly, you two dumbasses can’t see what’s right in front of your adorable little noses.” As if to make a point, she reaches out and boops Dean on his, making him scrunch his face reflexively in response.
Inside his chest, Dean’s energy is calm—the oily black tendrils satisfied and quiet where they usually roil, sharing space almost equally with the golden glow of Dean’s soul. The darkness is still very much there, but it’s been pacified for the time being.
Can’t hug family members, can’t hug friends. Can’t even get close to co-workers—being assigned to an actual COVID unit, everyone around them is a damn risk. They can’t comfort their patients properly either, which has
"I don't see what all the fuss is about," Rowena said from where she sat across the room. "Just set fire to them,” she said with a shrug. “We already know that works.”
To the Knight’s educational credit, this is definitely him. The history lessons Dean received along the road to hell didn’t get a damn thing wrong when it came to Cain’s looks
“No,” Dean persists, arm tightening where it holds Alfie firmly behind him. Kid steps across the line and Dean really won’t have anything to use. But the fact that he
Ain’t nobody about to beat him to this opportunity—he’s not above fighting, if he has to. More than one person moves to stand as Cas snaps the blindfold into place, but Dean is out of his seat like a shot, charging into Cas’ personal space and grabbing him around the back of the neck like he’s goddamn sure of his welcome.
Turning around with a glass in each hand, Castiel moves to set a drink in front of Naomi before settling down himself. He relaxes into one of the two comfortable-but-practical curved-back chairs she has facing her desk and takes a sip, glancing around. Castiel’s been here many times, of course, but he’s not yet been able to completely adjust to the opulence, unusual in a prison as it is.
Sam began yelling something behind his gag, and even Cas looked a bit panicked—understandably so, as these elves had clearly been strong enough to overpower him. Dean tried to dive for them, but just as his fingers made contact with Sam’s shoulder and the rough stubble of Castiel’s jawline, he felt dozens of tiny hands pushing him away and—
“I’m sorry, Dean,” she pleads, but Castiel shuts them all up by sliding past Dean and squeezing his bicep. When Dean’s eyes follow in surprise, he winks and shrugs. Oh, Dean
“Of course not,” Castiel replied grimly. “Because you were never made to know of them, and before God could destroy them, I stole them.”
Dean thought, his stomach souring worse. First, he’d tried to kiss Cas, and now he had accidentally talked about his dick in front of him. Cas was totally not interested.
Dean started to open his mouth but she disappeared before he could say anything more to her. “Oh, c’mon!”
“Our contract stipulates a check-in once per week. For many reasons, that’s not something I would feel comfortable eliminating completely, but I think a once-weekly chat is plenty for the time being. Anything else, we’ll play by ear. If there’s something I feel truly requires discussion, I’ll try to save it. Alternatively, if
why you wanted to be thrown in AdSeg badly enough to destroy prison property or I’ll get Tessa back in here with some terrible medical punishment.” It’s a completely empty threat and Dean knows it, but he pretends to act affronted anyway.
“In that case,” Castiel proposes, settling back and casually crossing one of his legs over the other. “Let’s start there. Let’s not talk about you at all. Tell me about Crowley.”
The sight unsettles Dean so badly that despite his best efforts, he nearly has a nervous breakdown right there in the secured parking lot.
“Ah. Yes, well, we are, in fact, at the exact location of where Cleito, the capital city at the center of Atlantis, was when the island sank. If you look that way,” Balthazar pointed due east, “you can just make out the Strait of Gibraltar.”
pull rank, could call him back and demand he stay, but he saw Dean’s vitals earlier and there really wasn’t anything concerning. It would be a power move, and one that he has
Less than a block from the Roadhouse, he regains his senses and forces himself to rein it in. It wouldn’t do to show up like a tornado, exploding into a bar where everyone knows him and will certainly have questions about why he’s so desperate to find Dean. The last thing he wants to do is embarrass Dean or out their situation to the public as a whole, and running full-speed into the Roadhouse screaming Dean’s name would be a great way to announce definitively that there’s something fishy going on.
It’s not unexpected when Dean breaks, twisting away from Castiel’s grasp like it burns, stumbling a few steps away to fist a hand in his hair and swear. “Shit. I shouldn’t have come here. I don’t know what I was thinking, Cas. I gotta—”
“Horse shit!” Dean yelled abruptly, getting to his feet. “More important people? Who else is more important?”
to process for anyone. It’s very likely that the man needed some space and time (and probably to sit Charlie down and grill her excruciatingly) before he was ready for any additional potential-True-Mate interaction.

takes him to his knees. The bathroom door suddenly swings open right beside him, and that’s just great, because that’s exactly what Dean needs, Castiel witnessing him like this. It’s not the stomach flu on the toilet, but it’s close.
“Sam, what’s wrong with your shoulder?” Castiel’s confused voice sounded from the backseat, and Sam was surprised to see him suddenly staring in concern. He suddenly looked more focused than he had since their fight in the graveyard.
It didn’t take a genius to follow the court proceedings, which was good, because The Gift definitely wasn’t explaining shit. The only truly notable thing Dean was able to pick up on was the part about
The first roadblock shows up more quickly than Dean expects. The next set of double doors—the ones closing off the alcove that the outer doors open into—is locked. There’s a security camera pointed directly at Dean’s face, but the red light is dark and he breathes a sigh of relief—it’s broken.
“Jesus, Cas,” Dean replies, slapping a soapy hand over his heart and leaving damp spots behind on his white t-shirt. “Haven’t we talked about this? You. Bell. Neck. Look into it.” He turns back to the sink, lifting the last dish out of the water and rinsing it off, setting it carefully on the drying rack before reaching down into the suds to pull the sink’s plug. The water goes gurgling down the drain quite noisily and Castiel swallows, suddenly feeling nervous and unsure.
“Don’t listen to him, Leen,” Gabriel calls out. Castiel looks over in time to see him stretch and flap his giant, tawny-golden wings hard, just once, like he’s shaking off the dust. They glitter with the movement. Gabriel grins, tipping his chin and winking up at Sam, who’s staring slack-jawed and wide-eyed at the display. “See something you like?” he asks, before turning back to Castiel and Eileen. “Seriously, though. Prettiest angel in the garrison right here, ask anybody. If Heaven had pageants, them feathers Cas is sporting would’ve bought our boy
And he’d fallen. As Hester had so eloquently told him once upon a time, from the moment Castiel laid a hand on Dean in Hell, he was lost. How right she was. Time and time again, Castiel had sacrificed, had rebelled, had gone against everything he knew and given up entire
“Okay, look,” the girl said, her hands up, palm-out. “I’m sorry if I was short with you up there, but I’ve been trying to keep the antiquities in one piece ever since the zombies arrived, and I get a little…territorial.”
“Coffee,” Dean says with a nod, voice low. Castiel squints at his whisper, prompting Dean to raise an eyebrow and jut his chin in the direction of Claire’s room.
"Pull forward!" Dean bellowed. His eyes, round like saucers, darted around at the zombies that were getting to their feet. "We gotta get Cas in the back!"
“You thought…” Again Sam pauses, but smartly, he decides to drop the issue and move on to whatever he was calling about in the first place. “Alright, Dean. Anyway, I have kind of a weird offer for you.”
as far and as wide as he wishes, just because he can. No bars, no chain-link fences, no beeping gates that open and close at set times. No power structure with him balanced precariously at the top, unseen enemies waiting in the shadows to try and take what he’s tenuously earned for themselves.
To stop himself from blurting such things out loud, he leans forward and bites Dean’s lower lip, sucks it into his own mouth before letting it go. “Kiss me, please,” Dean pants, his eyes cracking open, hazy and lovely and
of the Apocalypse World hunters were stumbling from the hallways, zombified and looking hungry as hell. Castiel dove across the room to the weapons bag and started tossing things at Dean, a few seconds later Sam felt an iron pike pole pressed into his hand, presumably for zombie killing. Fat lot of good that would do against the witch, though. Sam raised the shotgun and fired again but the blast went straight through nasty phantom in front of him leaving her cackling and soaring his way full speed. Unable to think of anything else to do, he braced with the pike pole out in front of him prepared to strike and waited to be blown from here to the Land of Oz.
Dean thinks, but he doesn’t have the strength or the energy to move, nevermind to run. The sirens stop or fade away, as do the roar of various engines, Dean’s not really sure. Perhaps they all just parked. His eyes open and close, and his ability to keep pressure on his stomach wanes. Dean wishes that he and Cas got a better goodbye than they did. He supposes that’s his fault, too.
someone’s probably COVID-infested hair, but here he is. He’d love to pretend it’s for strictly practical and health-related reasons, but they’ve already kissed and touched and crossed way too many lines for Dean to even pretend to believe that one. The reality of that is kind of gross, so Dean opts to ignore it in favor of doing some diligent scrubbing now.
off the first couple of years we were friends and you never gave me any kind of sign...” He drifts off a little helplessly.
“You are,” Cas assures him, threading fingers into the short hair at the nape of his neck. Dean’s breath puffs hot between them, and a tear falls from the corner of his eye onto Cas’ bare skin. “In the end, we all are who we are, no matter how much we may appear to have changed. Needing some assistance and
Castiel groans, shoving his glass away and ignoring how the wine jostles and splatters over the edge. He slumps down onto the table, stretching an arm out and resting his head on top quite listlessly. He blinks—an exaggerated, dramatic affair that comes with still more flashes of
“At least go and let Cas know that I’ll be setting up to research in the war room,” Sam said, “and get him to let Rowena in when she gets here—I’m covered in graveyard gunk too. A shower and an hours nap, maybe.” Sam sighed, giving Dean another long look before he moved around the war table, and past the kitchen, to head off through the long corridor that led to the showers.
“Dean!” Castiel gasps, just barely stopping himself from diving forward and then scowling when Dean winds up hanging by his knees from the scaffolding. His upper body swings back and forth gently as his shoulders shake with laughter, and when Castiel walks up to him, they’re basically face-to-face, despite the fact that one of them is upside-down. “You’re incorrigible,” he growls, and then immediately forgets why he was angry when Dean reaches out and cups his face.
Nothing seems amiss until after Dorothy comes over to where he and Lisa are sitting across from each other on two of the poolside lounges. Dean is ultimately making things worse on her poor face at this point, and Dorothy rolls her eyes, grabs Lisa’s hand, and drags her off to the bedroom to get her fixed up. As they run away giggling, Dean sighs and sits back, looking around for someone else to talk to.
Eyes pleading, Castiel tries one last time. “Dean, if you don’t calm down, I’m going to have to call for an officer and slot you. Why don’t you tell me what the problem is?”
“Oh, hell yes,” Dean agrees immediately, pulling his own t-shirt over his head without hesitation. “Boxers?”
“Yea, yea,” Sam says dismissively with a roll of his eyes that makes Castiel wonder how often he’s walked in on Dean doing something like this. The thought doesn’t sit well in his stomach, but everyone has a history. If Dean simply wanted a quick roll in the hay, he certainly could have made a move by now, and that’s enough for Castiel to put those particular worries aside. “Cas, your ten o’clock is here. She knows you might be a few minutes, I’ve got her set up with some tea in the War Room. I gotta get back, I’ve got a client in the chair. Dean—you good to show Cas his station?” Sam’s tone is pointed and Dean looks appropriately chastised, nodding sharply and shifting his stance under his brother’s disapproving gaze.
Once settled, Castiel flips the blanket he keeps folded on the back of the couch over both of them and cards his fingers through Dean’s hair, soothes his hands down his back. He resists the urge to verbally reassure Dean about anything they discussed earlier, thinking that might not be the best way to assuage his bristly embarrassment, considering.
On those nights, Dean slips out of their cottage in the dead of night and just walks. His feet lead him blindly, brain on autopilot, down to the beach. No matter the weather, Dean can and does sit there for hours, just feeling the salt on his skin and breathing the fresh air. Eventually, Cas always finds him. If he’s awake when Dean leaves, he’ll give him some space before following, but many of those times, he’s not.
Gabriel and Balthazar embark on an underwater journey to the fabled city of Atlantis to retrieve Gabriel’s Horn. Adventure ensues :D
All that to say, Castiel inevitably winds up leaving his toy in its parking space, opting instead to rev up his custom Model S. Rolling the windows down, he exits his personal garage through a remote operated door that dumps him into a short tunnel leading out to the employees’ underground parking structure. Castiel waves as he navigates through the manned security barriers and out onto the sun-lit street, enjoying the freedom of being back behind the wheel.
Reluctantly turning over and away from Dean’s peaceful face, Castiel checks his phone. By some miracle, his demanding job hasn’t needed him overnight and doesn’t need him now, so for that, he is grateful. Never has he wanted to keep a weekend to himself more—there’s still so much to figure out, so much to discover.
There is nothing Castiel wants more in the world than to protest, to tell this asshole off, to point out that both Dean
At this point, Rachel the producer calls out from where she’s crouching next to one of the cameramen. “Look surprised and excited about what she says next or we’ll have to do it over!”
“You know, I don’t blame myself for Dad, not much anyway. He’d been a lost cause for years. If it hadn’t happened that night, would’ve happened another. But Sammy—he shouldn’t have had to see that shit. It was
Pushing back from the table, Castiel stands and makes his way over to Jack’s side. “Jack—you know that I support you, and preserving free will is paramount, but how can you just
Castiel stood, watching them, the farmer and the shepherd, and he felt beside him a powerful entity that could only be God.
Beneath him, the sand is downright cold, but it feels good on his skin after that taxing run. The water, on the other hand—
Without a word, Dean shifted over to the other side of the cot, leaving just enough space for Castiel to lay down.
gas masks, knee pads, ponchos, jugs of milk and water, plus all sorts of first-aid supplies—Castiel struggles to keep a lid on it. The corner of her mouth hasn’t even fully healed from the last time she jumped into the middle of one of these things, and his inner alpha already wants to rip apart anyone who even looks at her (or Dean) sideways.
“Cas,” Dean croaks, failing to get to his feet but not needing to because Castiel skids to a stop in the mud and crashes to his knees at Dean’s side. Dean’s throat hurts like a

Dean supposes he should have expected that, after all, he knows how hard the entire Quidditch team works out, and bought spot or not, Novak is always lifting and sweating right there alongside everyone else. How else would he have gotten those spectacularly Quidditch-toned thighs?
Which is why, when the cops walked into the bar, that’s what Dean thought they were there to handle. He actually put his hands up, ready to admit it all and throw himself on the mercy of a judge that would
Inwardly, Dean curses Sam for insisting they move out to the more rural outskirts of the city, the residential developments that have absolutely nothing useful in walkable distance, not even a gas station or a 7-11. He also curses himself for being too damn antisocial and Cas for having zero people skills, or maybe they’d have some neighbors whose living room they could hang out in until Sam came home. Dean supposes that if it comes to that, a little awkwardness would be better than letting him and Cas turn into human popsicles.
“Just a little,” Dean agrees, but he’s smiling. “Hey, it’s all good. Once upon a time, I’m told I was pretty irresistible.” He cringes internally at the weird flirtation attempt, but Castiel seems amused and not at all put off.
one tells you what you can and cannot do. Not your father, not society, not fate. You are the master of your own destiny, Dean Winchester,” Castiel says.
“Boy,” Charlie remarks, reaching out with her foot from across the way to prod at Cas’ knee. “Betcha you’re glad to have dodged that bullet, huh?”

“Thanks,” Dean says, wiping the back of his hand across his mouth, clearing away the damp drops of alcohol lingering on his skin.
“That so? Seems harsh. Maybe you had good reasons. Besides, from what I hear, you’ve been through enough in this place. Ass-kicking seems...what’s the word? Redundant.”

Since the post is a sponsored one—the product is some bullshit health shake that’s supposed to help his followers bulk up—the biceps are the natural choice.
“Oh,” Castiel says weakly, somewhat regretting even starting this conversation. Claire’s right, his wardrobe isn’t exactly from Goodwill, and it’s not as if they can’t afford it. It’s not like he even cares—Claire can purchase whatever clothing she wants, as far as Castiel’s concerned. It’s just—confusing, in a way.
the vibrations sending shivery tendrils of want down Dean’s spine and into his fingertips. Dean wonders vaguely if this is a kink, and it probably is, since he thinks he could maybe come just from feeling Castiel growl into his skin a few more times.
“It’s just that from what I’ve been able to ascertain, Rowena has been running Hell in a somewhat similar fashion—she’s...hands-off,” Jack says hesitantly. “And the
Dean knows, somewhere in the back of his mind, that this is just sex and not life, but at the same time—
Rowena squinted at Billie. Death noticed that her aura was throbbing, sorrowful, rage-filled. But she didn’t show it on her face, and Death supposed that was none of their business. To Dean, Rowena said, “How did you even know she’d be listening?”
Billie smiled. “Well, I’ve got great news for you.” She snapped her fingers and the door of the room opened, letting two men in—a slim one with blond hair and a permanent smirk on his lips, and another one,  a shorter guy with a messy hair and a trickster expression on his face.
angry-looking. None of them were ever interested enough in the idea of using the Jacuzzi to voluntarily come anywhere near that mess, so Dean has to assume it’s only gotten worse over the years.
Dean avoids the video store today, having not quite gotten up the nerve to talk to the pretty woman he saw there previously. He throws the ball for Sam in Grand Central Park instead of down by the Seaport after detouring over to pick some potatoes, tomatoes, carrots and herbs from his Highline garden. It’s the first day that he hasn’t gone down to the Port since broadcasting his message, but Dean’s about ready to give up the futile quest for survivors.
the man to take the spoon in hand, but Dean just opens his mouth and wraps his lips around the metal rather unabashedly, leaving Castiel to stare down at him in disbelief—and a growing amount of embarrassing interest—as he swallows. Dean’s tongue jars the spoon in his hand, which makes Castiel panic and let go, leaving it to dangle from Dean’s mouth somewhat comically.
Dean eyed him, enjoying the tightness of the jacket around Cas’ shoulders and arms. His eyes flickered from Cas’ boots, to his ripped black jeans, and then back to the coat. He gazed fondly at the messy long hair that was starting to curl under Cas’ ears and fall onto his forehead.
As far as Castiel knows, the city hasn’t run into any issues with people taking and not giving back. Generally speaking, the apocalypse and its lack of electricity and indoor plumbing seems to have made socialism a lot more palatable to the surviving general public. No one wants to go back to living in the unsecured dark, watching their family be eaten by monsters, and wiping their asses with leaves. It isn’t like Chuck was wrong about that part.
The thing about Dean’s escape and subsequent campaign to clear his name is that it was only successful because of a group—no, a
When he climbed into the sleigh, Dean noted that Jack was still fast asleep, and so he took a moment to slide just a
Fuck kinda name is that, anyway? No, you know what, you have no room to talk. You're the one locked away in a dungeon in case you forgot, so you know what? Have a holly, jolly prison sentence, you Christmas Gnome."

Castiel held up a finger. “If you’re open to it, I have another idea,” he suggested, and unsurprisingly, Sam and Jess were all ears as Castiel filled them in.
to succeed and your infinite resourcefulness. I respect and appreciate all of those things, as much as anything else you are. I want you to be my equal partner in all ways, and this was the best solution I could think of to show you—to show you that sentiment is the farthest thing from lip service.”
Throwing the car into park, Castiel pulls out his phone and stops the Bluetooth sync that’s sending his iTunes library through the speakers. He uses the location services to find a tow-truck service nearby, noting options that are out of Reno (closer) and Incline Village (further, but also his destination). There’s one service in particular that catches his eye, since it appears to be associated with a local garage.
Despite his fears, they take it better than Dean thinks they might’ve if he’d been upfront from the jump, but as he suspected, not everyone agrees with the conclusions he’s arrived at on his own. Thing is (and the reason he brought the topic up at all), Dean’s not sure those
Rowena crumbled, her knees hitting the floor with terrible force as she, Balthazar and Gabriel screamed. Sam got out of Dean’s hold, closing the distance between him and Rowena in two steps, embracing her, her screams lowering to merely whimpers. Castiel ran to Balthazar’s side while Dean went to Gabriel, their bodies limp on the cot. Castiel shook Balthazar, his heart beating in his throat, fear being the only thing in his veins as he stared down at his brother with wide eyes. He couldn’t get a response from Balthazar, and saw that Dean couldn’t get anything from Gabriel either, his shake attempts useless. Sam was still holding Rowena in his arms, face buried in her hair as he whispered something too low for Castiel’s human ears to hear.
On Wednesday morning, Castiel arrives home similarly blearly and burnt out, the same way he has the past three days prior.
Their pace finally slows as Dean decides they’re not being followed. Castiel finds himself needing to give Claire some sort of… some reason,
on the damn planet that would make me happier. My whole apartment is about the size of this suite, but when I think about you in it? Damn.”
Shoulders lifting and falling gently as he panted, Cas nodded, pulling his eyes up from the dead, maimed demon. “Fine.” His voice was destroyed. “He hit me to stun me before the noose went around my neck. Is he dead?”
“No, nope,” Dean says, shaking his head and swiftly rolling out of bed to standing in one smooth movement. Castiel misses his presence immediately, but he has to admit, he’s interested to see where this is going. Dean heads for the hall—tugging on a pair of boxers from the floor as he goes—but at the door he stops, pulling his hand away from the knob like it’s hot. “Wait—time check?”
Oh no. Castiel’s hands went still and he raised his head, a chill running down his spine as the zombie Anael’d been fighting roared, black saliva blasting out of its mouth in rage.
” is the extent of articulation Castiel can accomplish, winding up clutching Dean’s shoulder and biting down on his t-shirt covered collarbone as Dean wraps a hand over his own and thrusts. “Oh,

Still suspicious, Dean huffs but turns back around. “We’re just friends,” he mumbles as he eases off the brake, signing
A porn rag, if he’s remembering the terminology correctly, dated from 2008, before everything went to shit. If Dean kept it this long, it’s safe to assume that the images in it depict things Dean was and is still attracted to. If the well-worn state of the binding and the creases on several pages in particular are any indication, Castiel has nothing to worry about.
lucky move that takes Cas down; a driven kick of the man’s ratty but steel-toed boots straight to the middle of Cas’ chest.
False sense of security, really. Crowley doesn’t need freedom of movement or even direct access to make anyone’s life a living hell.
Chapter Warnings: Police officers, homophobic language/insults (cops—>Cas), an arrest, mentions of murder, non-graphic mentions of gun violence, allusions to framing/set-up. Cas exercises some major white privilege in his interactions with the cops. I want to reiterate: the cops are VERY rude and the way they speak to Cas may be triggering.
"Y-Y-You good for n-nothing ugly little i-i-imp!" Cas croaked in between coughing up a bit of snow from his mouth and grasping at Dean until his legs seemed to shake so hard he nearly fell over. "I-I'm going to pull your intestines out through your mouth—"
As they venture down the rocky slope, Jack catches up to him in a jog, bumping their elbows together. For whatever reason, Rowena’s taken special precautions with him—armor plates that protect his arms and all the way up to his neck. Jack doesn't seem to mind at all.
Out on the street, he realizes he was right about the temperature; it feels twenty degrees warmer down here than out on his office balcony, and not nearly as windy. Castiel wishes he’d taken his suit jacket off before driving, but it’s too late now. He
Nothing. Nothing happens. The Bunker is as silent and empty as ever, save for the TV show Castiel forgot to put on pause that is now mocking him with its not-nearly-as-enticing supernatural crises. With a grimace, Castiel gets to his feet, knees cracking as he straightens up. He punches the “off” button on the side of the TV more forcefully than necessary before dragging a hand over his mouth.
Castiel’s blown Dean while he lay spread atop the dining table, remnants of a takeout dinner smashed beneath his torso. He’s moaned his way to orgasm while Dean ate him out on his knees in the too-small-for-two-men shower. He’s straddled Dean across one of the creaking kitchen chairs and railed him with his cock and two fingers, Dean’s leg propped and braced on the minibar, his upper body half in the kitchen sink.
Dean bites his lip and Cas digs nails into his thigh, like they both don’t know the outcome. But hey, maybe they don’t. Maybe one of those times Dean reached out in his sleep, he touched Cas’ arm. He doesn’t
Dean, feeling that confidence he didn’t understand, reached over and ran his hand over Cas’ head, ruffling his hair a bit in a way he rationalized to himself was entirely platonic...even when his hand lingered and his thumb brushed Cas’ ear. When Cas looked over, finally holding Dean’s gaze, Dean said, “And those people? They are persevering, sure. But they are lost and broken and ain’t no one movin’ on, Cas. We’re all just floating around, a fuckin’ mess of pain and confusion. You weren’t the only one putting on a show. Hell, if you’re feeling shitty for crying and greiving, then take a fucking number and get in line—” Cas looked blinked abruptly, and Dean snorted. “—’cause for every one breakdown you got, I got four more. I mean, fuck, I feel like I haven’t gone a minute since my mom died where I didn’t feel...I dunno, totally shattered and splintered into a million pieces. I don’t even know where to start pickin’ ‘em up.”
With the seconds ticking down, Dean strips quickly and moves his collar from his wrist to his neck. He ditches his clothes in the bedroom, grabbing his robe out of one of the duffles before stuffing his feet back into his boots. Laces still untied, he flies out the front door and down the porch,
Sighing (and ignoring Dean’s ridiculous self-deprecation), Castiel refocuses on the symbols decorating the open pages in his lap. He furrows his brow before reaching into his pocket and pulling out the keyring. “Perhaps something on—”

It was simultaneously the dumbest and most horrifying experience of his life as the elves watched him shove his limbs into the stupid suit that fit him frustratingly well.

“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says almost breathlessly, his entire demeanor slightly more overt in his interest than he perhaps would have preferred, but his thoughts caught him off guard and now Dean is
Dean shook his head. “No use in sitting around crying over it. There’s nothing we can do right now except fight whatever comes our way. In the meantime, I’m gonna go get us a shower.” He looked at Sam pointedly. “Because
“I’m sorry, Dean,” he calls over his shoulder before disappearing around a corner and into an ally. A shiver goes through Castiel that has nothing to do with the cold—he’s witnessed this kind of scene plenty of times in this part of town.
he thinks—as Dean’s tongue presses hot inside his mouth, his own hand reaching up to curl around the back of Dean’s head as Dean’s hand slides against the sensitive skin underneath the hem of his shirt—
“It’s alright, Dean,” Castiel chimes in. He appears out of nowhere at Dean’s side, one warm hand resting on his shoulder. “I cleared the unit prior to bringing Gordon in. I suspected he might—well, react precisely how he did.”
“I’m sure you’ve heard the sanitized version of how the Knights were founded. Two brothers, money, power, equal share of it all—you, too, can be the master of your own destiny if you join us, etcetera, etcetera.” Cain pauses and Dean nods, unsure of where this is headed, but curious enough to shut up and find out. “Yeah, well, it’s bullshit. The truth is, my brother Abel fell in with the syndicate that predated the Knights. They held a kind of power we couldn’t dream of seizing today, and definitely not back then. They did horrible things, Dean. Things you can’t even begin to imagine, and that’s saying something. I won’t even repeat their name—we’re not trying to speak a return into existence. Let’s just call them the Scourge.”
As Castiel’s loading up his car to head home, he gets a text from Dean that he’s headed straight to his place, too. Do not pass go, do not collect two hundred dollars (or in this case, shower and change). Logistically, Castiel knows he should probably tell him to go home and do all that, but put plainly, he just doesn’t want to. Since the hospital parking lot the night before, he hasn’t seen Dean at all and both of their shifts were busy, leaving little time for texting. The result is an anxious Castiel who is quite desperate to get on with their plans and in general, to have Dean in his arms.
my skills are rusty at the moment,” he tells Dean. While Dean grins and tries to look tantalizingly cocky while balancing on one leg like a sexy as fuck flamingo, Castiel notices the bag Dean left for him on the couch.
At the end of the day, though, Dean trusts his brother, and it’s not like he can come up with a solid reason as to why he’s uneasy about tracking this witch down, anyway.
He’s about to give Dean an out, to let him off the hook without consequence when Dean surprises him. Castiel watches in abject fascination as Dean leans forward, parting his lips and closing them around Castiel’s fingertips, sucking the blueberry into his mouth in a
I'm aware that some people like to know the major angst/pain plot points before they read and I don't have any issue helping out w/that. I only ask that if you use Tumblr, don't send an anon ask because I won't spoil publicly and will have no way to reply to you directly. Same vein, if i *missed* something you think should be tagged, please let me know.
“I can’t wait to see you take this cock,” he says quietly, plainly, like he’s innocent, like this isn’t one of the dirtiest things Dean’s ever done. “You know, I’d love to see you take a real one, besides mine, but I’m far too possessive to share.” Dean shivers at the suggestion, his body relaxing minutely because that

“I’ll find a way,” he says, determined, more for his own benefit than Sam’s, since there’s no way Sam could hear him now, anyway.
Frustrated, Dean paces a little, running his fingers through his hair. He stops to lean on the back of his seat before taking a long drink from his own glass of water.
Still, he’s seen the videos Hannah forwarded from the Family Business. Clips of Dean both in training and at work, recorded footage of him taking down coworkers twice his size on the mat, as well as would-be predators and other dangerous criminals in real-time. He’s truly a wonder to behold when fighting—intuitive and dangerous, all rolled into one fiercely protective and determined (

slow on the uptake. He only fully registers what’s happening after Benny’s already disappeared into his room and Cas is motioning for him to follow out into the hall, but Dean’s seen it once or twice, and he’s pretty freaking sure that was two dudes fighting over him.
“Oof,” is what comes out of Castiel’s mouth as he’s crushed against Dean’s chest, but it only takes him a second to recalibrate before he’s gripping Dean back. Scant seconds pass before he’s melting, sinking into the warmth of Dean’s body with relief.
The buzzer sounds and the lock clicks, the guard standing just outside pulling it open wide like Dean’s the damn Queen of England herself.
Just wanted to say a huge thank you to all of you who read along with this. I really wrote myself into a corner with the themes and such, and this was a real struggle for me to complete after the finale of the show aired. I didn't intend to do such a heavy-handed subversion of the shit we got, I *thought* I was going to have a Dean confession that I could light-heartedly parallel. LOL. Sweet summer child. Instead, here I am adding all kinds of emotion into the sex scene because
It’s hard to look at him. The Cas in Dean’s mind barely resembles the bruised and battered mess lying in this bed. The entire right side of his husband’s face is bruised and swollen, Cas’ right eye sealed completely shut by the trauma. There’s a ton of bloody gauze piled and taped atop his head, and there’s a wire or a drain or something coming out from underneath that Dean isn’t able to even
Turning around ready to assess the next threat, he found Dean and Cas already fighting like Hell. Back-to-back in the fray, he spared a thought that at least one thing remained constant in their lives, and that was their ability to have each other’s backs in the fight against evil no matter what was amiss between them personally. A zombie sent Dean flying across the map table and Cas turned immediately to spear it through the head from behind, offering Dean a hand up before jumping back into the melee together.
Castiel scowls. The sword knocks tauntingly against his thigh as he climbs the stairs—even his weapons are mocking him. “If everyone would stop
It surprises Dean when Castiel frowns, fiddling with his hands down by his belly button—not the response he expected. “Then why did you stop me?”
Before Lisa can say anything else, the distinctive sound of the President of the United States’ voice takes over the car radio. On any other day, Dean wouldn’t care one iota for politics or listening to politicians, but today isn’t any other day, and he already knows what’s coming. In the back seat, Ben is still whining and complaining, and Dean and Lisa seemingly snap at the same time.
“Up. Feet slightly apart, arms straight out, like you’re reaching for the walls.” As Castiel saunters over to the far armoire, the one that holds all of his bondage supplies, Dean complies with his instructions. While he watches Castiel rooting casually around in the top drawer, he regrets doing it so quickly, realization dawning that holding his arms out in this way is not necessary positioning for shibari, it’s punishment for his sass.
They were definitely zombies, Dean decided. What else could they be? They’d literally risen from their graves as Chuck had doomed them with a simple fuckin’ Thanos-click.
“Thanks for dragging my ass out here,” is all Dean says, but there’s something much heavier behind his words.
“Say no more,” Charlie butts in, setting her glass down on a sideboard and holding up a hand as she digs her phone from her pocket and scrolls through it. “Full disclosure, small world and all? I actually know these guys on a personal level. Went to college with the brothers.”
—for his, no hesitation. He wasn’t sorry and so I’m not either. It’s unfortunate shit ended this way, but Alastair was never going to let us go free.”

“That’s our official slogan,” Dean quips. His palm slips from Castiel’s hip to wind their hands together, and that’s nearly as nice, though it is a little—
it had been more of a relief than anything else. And when Dean finally moved out (he’d been quietly renovating another cabin since perhaps two months into Castiel’s injury), it hurt, but Castiel also thought it was probably for the best.
Still trapped against the wall, Castiel falters. “I don’t—” He opens his mouth and then closes it again, wracking his brain. He’s shared plenty with Dean, including most of the things he’d consider
probably the best choice all around, but Dean isn’t stupid. Cain might have helped him out in the past, but their singular meeting made one thing crystal clear—he
—>Graphic violence—prison fight between Crowley and Dean, Crowley uses a knife. Related injuries, blood. Dean has the opportunity to and considers killing him, he does not.
Across the room, Cas’ face turns stormy. “No,” he says, striding forward, still cautious but also full of intent. “We are not going to do that. May I touch you? You can say no.”
Moving bodies. Seventy, eighty, Sam wasn’t stopping to count. The zombies clawed at each other, piling overtop of one another, growling, howling, squeezing through the growing, glowing, gaping cracks that were threatening the entire camp.
been stuck weathering it out with Sammy. But Sam is a Ravenclaw and Dean is in Gryffindor, and their teachers and Headmaster had been crystal clear—everyone staying to weather this thing out at the school were to remain in their own Houses. Room assignments were not to be swapped or switched, and anyone found to be violating that commandment would be dealt with “harshly.”
Dean thought, cringing at the drying stickiness between his thighs. As he pushed himself to his feet, he knew perfectly well that everything that transpired should serve as the warning it was meant to be. Instead, Dean found himself angry—furious, even. He’d
The pickup truck disappears in a cloud of dust and music that’s more screaming than intelligible words or harmony, and Castiel follows its tail lights with narrowed eyes. He waits for another few minutes, rubbing his stiff, gloved fingers together, deeply concerned that the light inside the cabin is still on.
“We can’t be sure,” Castiel replies hesitantly, curling the hand that’s resting on Dean’s back around his closest bicep. “Come, darling. We need to get you warm. As soon as we’re to the top of this hill, I’ll bundle you up.”
It’s past noon when Dean wakes up on his own. He vaguely remembers hearing his watch beeping and hitting it until it stopped before turning over and burying his face in the pillow again. When he finally does get out of bed, he’s not in much better shape than when he got into it the night before. He skips exercising, skips eating, doesn’t even bother to shower or put on new clothes. His jeans are still caked in blood, the wound on his thigh undressed and sticking to the fabric, but Dean barely even notices.
The kisses he sucks from Cas’ face and shoulders, over his sharp jaw and down his neck, taste of water and Cas’ clean skin. The stubble on Cas’ face burns Dean’s cheeks, and he can’t wait to feel it on the sensitive skin of his thighs. Can’t wait to feel Cas for
“She’ll be the one buried beneath the largest pile of ladies, of that I am sure,” Castiel replies mildly before turning his attention back out the window.
In fact, Dean’s so busy admiring the ceiling, he doesn’t notice at first that Castiel’s no longer doing the same thing. When he drops his gaze, it’s with a little jolt to find the alpha mere inches away, staring
"Better, I think," Carl said, staring down at the stump with a faint look of confusion, like he still hadn't grasped that a part of him was gone. That wouldn't matter if he hadn't escaped the bite; he wouldn't even register the loss or the pain. "Let's just—Can we get this over with?"
His breath puffing cloudy condensation onto his own reflection, Dean gives a token struggle and that just makes Cas grab his wrist, twist it behind his back, and hold on tighter. “Fuck,” Dean murmurs, as the obvious bulge of Cas’ erection makes itself known against his ass. “This is cheating,” he complains, the cage already growing tight and painful around his own cock. “Ungh,” he moans, using his free hand to press down on his crotch and running through every disgusting, dick-deflating image he can come up with as Cas’ teeth nip gently at the shell of his ear.
Embarrassed, he mumbles a “thank you” to the man, who grunts and probably annihilates Castiel’s star rating for being as anti-social and oblivious as they come, but he can’t do much about that now. Stepping back out into the cold, Castiel shivers and regrets the leather against his skin.
“Or something,” Castiel replies, after breaking a too-short kiss before he can chance getting lost in it. No easy task. “However, there is a matter of some importance that I was hoping to go over with you first.”
It’s silent in the kitchen over the next few minutes as both Winchesters move around each other easily, in practiced rhythms. It’s different for Dean than at Cas’ place or with Cas in general—this sort of familiarity is the kind that feels like
and so Castiel swallows the words that threaten to spill off the tip of his tongue. Slipping out of Dean’s body and shoving back in again, he focuses on that and that alone, allowing the words to stick and burn inside his chest instead.
“No,” he agrees. “As you shouldn’t. But I do think it’s long past time you had some help from someone who’s sat on the sidelines for far too long.”
While Dean’s busy spying, trying to figure out who is checking out who (and who his competition might be in that department), he doesn’t hear the A.D. say, “Got it, go for Dean,” into his headset. “You’re live,” the guy adds, his tone annoyed as he taps the battery pack tucked into Dean’s shorts. The mic itself is wound around his neck like some kind of douchey hipster necklace, and Dean suddenly wishes he hadn’t been so easy about taking off his shirt. He probably looks like a complete tool.
This is the worst part of the job, without question. This is the thing most of the EMTs and medics he knows have nightmares about. Before it happens because of the fear of it, the anticipation, and then afterward for
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean can see Cas’ brow furrow as he mouths the words “nice-smelling sweat” silently to himself, sniffing after his armpit in obvious confusion. If all of his brain cells weren’t currently occupied being worried about whatever is going down inside his own body, Dean might have been able to admit that the reaction is seriously adorable.
In the aftercare section of their contract, Castiel leaves an elaborate note about extended skin-to-skin, sleeping together in the same bed, staying overnight unless otherwise requested, and not leaving before Dean wakes up. All of those things should go a long way towards soothing Dean’s feelings of rejection and abandonment, of preventing this sort of emotional drop going forward. As an afterthought, Castiel adds a note about checking in with Dean (and Dean
Sam hesitates, and his silence is answer enough. That’s fair—Dean wouldn’t want to publicly associate with himself either, if he was his brother—but it stings a little. “The D.A.’s office does,” Sam offers. “It’s not that—Dean, I was really worried things might come to this. The stuff I’ve seen in Crowley’s files—the
Crowley’s at the back of the house, working on various lighting and sound cues in the booth with Kevin and Charlie. From the (lack of) volume of their voices, that seems to be going better than might be expected. This theater is fairly state-of-the-art, which has done nothing to rein Crowley and his wild dreams in. Castiel makes a note to check in with Charlie later, help her scale back whatever unrealistic thing Crowley is inevitably demanding she pull off.
related,” Castiel exclaims, wrapping his arms around her thin shoulders and squeezing tight. “I love you,” he adds, kissing her cheek before darting away to catch up with Anna. The pleased smile on his mother’s face as he goes makes the sappy display
Dean lies there listlessly, vaguely noting the sounds of his block-mates moving around as he comes to terms with the possibility that this
But Castiel slides his hand back around Dean’s head as they walk, tightens his grip on Dean’s hair. “Listen to me,” he says fiercely. “I will
“The guards?” Castiel prompts, when Dean beings to ramble on a tangent about Crowley’s fighting style that isn’t particularly useful at the moment.
Warnings: a prison break, that’s literally it. Unless I missed something--let me know if that's the case!
Dean smiled back at him, squeezing Castiel’s arm one last time, and then turned back to the manifesto, grabbing his pen. Castiel sighed and turned to the notes on the table in front of him. They went back to sharing their thoughts, writing on another sheet of paper what they knew of Cas’ memories, and what Dean understood from the writings.
Now that the novelty of what they’re doing in bed has worn off, on most post-shift mornings he and Cas eat and cuddle in bed while binging something trashy. Bridgerton is just the latest, and Dean will go to his grave before he admits to anyone besides Cas that he digs it.
In the early, pink-skied dawn hours, Dean drags Castiel from dreamland with a nightmare. Still unconscious, he cries out and thrashes, kicking the covers away from the bed and leaving Castiel’s sleep-warmed skin exposed to the chill. It scares Castiel at first, waking him roughly and leaving him confused and disoriented. For a moment, he forgets where he is and why another man is in his bed, though it all comes flooding back like a tidal wave.
Cas clears his throat. His cheeks color slightly as he asks, “Would it be too much to ask you to say it again?”
Dean laughs again. “Yeah, and I can’t imagine he’s hopping back in it to save some idiot lackey who was too dumb to recognize he was being
Arm-in-arm, he and Dean are stopped halfway across the square to the dance floor by one of their (frantic) patrol units, come to seek advice on an encounter they disagreed upon how to handle. To Castiel’s great surprise and pleasure, Dean squeezes his hand before telling Castiel he’ll take care of it, whatever
“Sounds like it’s coming from the garage,” Sam said, already slipping his hand gun out from under the back of his shirt. “Come on. Might as well get on with it.”
They don’t leave the motel room for days. Dean keeps clothing (and a million other things) in his car, pieces that fit Castiel well enough, not that they wear anything at all most of the time. Sometimes—usually after a round of energetic sex that leaves him panting and worn-out—Dean seems
Castiel manages to get the door closed with his semi-frozen hands, grunting in irritation as he sidles forward and drops to his knees in front of the heater. “Faster,” he mumbles, presumably to the heater, since Dean is just crouching there. Which reminds him…
Considering what Castiel has in mind, he can’t think of anyone better to collaborate with on creating the newest sector of Novak Corp. With Billie’s help, Castiel has been able to build an entirely separate nonprofit that can’t be easily tracked back to the rest of his company, mostly to avoid the media and the public’s interest in his involvement. Undoubtedly, it will eventually come to light, but when that time comes, Castiel will defer to the nonprofit’s leadership on how to handle it.
“‘M’sorry, Sir,” Dean replies breathily, and Castiel believes him—he’s slipping quickly into subspace and the look in his eyes is nothing but
villain, of course, that’s no fun. It was supposed to be your father, you know. He was supposed to be the guy. But in the end, it was you. Well, you might not be an easy mark, but at least you could stay sober long enough to make it stick.”
His answer comes in the form of Castiel’s mouth against Dean’s own, warm and sweet with just a hint of the spicy tomato sauce from dinner. Dean’s residual headache fades into the background, dulled by the overwhelming realization that he’s
“Charlie needed a date,” Sam replies absently and doesn’t offer any further information than that, so Dean just pouts to himself and lets it go. At the moment, he’s way more concerned with Eileen mocking him, because that’s new.
no, he loves it, loves how free he gets to be when he’s wearing it, loves everything it represents. At the same time, he’d be lying if he said Cas’ obsession with the thing wasn’t starting to grate. Waking up to Castiel worshipping the little strip of leather first thing brings Dean right back to that negative headspace he’d worked so hard to fight off when he was left alone the night before. Still, it’s hard to argue with being jerked off in Cas’ arms as an alarm clock, though how that happened, Dean can’t begin to figure out. He supposes (like everything else lately) that he should probably just sit back and enjoy, and not question it.
holds position. Instead of diving in right away, Castiel pours some additional lube into his palm and then wraps his entire hand around Dean’s swollen, neglected cock.
live to embarrass you,” Anna retorts, grabbing his arm and dragging him to the front of the “Meet Santa” line before he can protest. If Castiel didn’t know that most of these kids have already had two or three turns on Santa’s lap, perhaps he would have put up more of a fight. In truth, this
Sam’s lip twitched softly, and he began to head off out of the war room toward the bedrooms—but he stopped, a couple of feet from the door, and turned. “Hey Dean?” he began, almost nervously. “I just want to say...I know I gave you a hard time about the Santa thing. Because that’s just us, and it always has been.”
only came to congratulate Dean and Alfie and to wish them luck in the future. She even went so far as to
Stroking Dean lazily, he finishes swirling his tongue around the head of his cock before pulling off with a slurp. Dean shivers. “No,” he concedes, “But I have a feeling I’m going to.” He relaxes his jaw and goes again, taking as much of Dean into his mouth as possible, until the crown bumps the back of his throat.
Castiel takes the news about Crowley in stride, kicking into high-gear “fix-it” mode before they’re even back through the doors to the secure area of the prison. Without discussion, Dean gets yanked unceremoniously into his office, Cas’ expression pensive and carefully blank as he closes the door behind them. He looks like his mind is racing a mile a minute and he doesn’t want any of it to show on his face. He motions for Dean to sit (he does) in one of the worn chairs facing his desk, and then spends several minutes making phone calls and not telling Dean jack shit about why.
a little. He’s still floating, but the anticipation is high and his blood is running hot through his veins.
Exasperated, Dean looked out at Sam, Ro, and Cas as they started to file in. “Can’t we just lock the door behind him and go back home?”
Dean pulls away swiftly, leaving Castiel practically flailing in mid-air. Naturally, he catches himself on Dean’s thighs, because they’re
way to go about any continued research as well as any potential real-world applications of such. Those are huge, Mariana Trench-sized
