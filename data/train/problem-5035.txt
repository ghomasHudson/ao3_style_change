Toni thinks, and gets the same kind of grin Rhodey would recognize, Rhodey would shudder at, Rhodey would feel a primal shock of fear at, down in the corner of his mind that echoes with the sounds of a maniacal whirring and a brutally-murdered kitchen appliance screaming its last.
, and her fingers tighten on his shoulders, clutching herself against him. “Holy fuck,” she breathes. Her thighs flex on his waist, heels in the small of his back jerking him forward, forcing him deeper. “Oh Jesus fucking Christ, you feel so good.” Her whole body shudders, tightens, arms and legs and hands and sex, until it feels like slick fingers rhythmically squeezing his cock.
“I am not at all sure about this, Barton,” Tony mutters, then readjusts his grip on the enormous stuffed rabbit to reach past it and ring the doorbell, and battles the urge to hide behind it as he senses Carol approaching. He chances a quick scan, catches a flash of her toweling her hair dry as she thinks about how she’s going to need to finally decide if she’s growing it out again or keeping it short, and rolls his eyes behind his sunglasses. “Never mind. The most pressing thing demanding her attention is her current hairstyle.”
(She has absolute faith that Clint will be along, because that’s just the kind of guy he is. But if he finds her sitting down on the job and
She blinks again, and it’s even harder to keep her eyes open. “Fine,” she says, and turns in the direction the blinking path on her HUD indicates. “I suppose it’s too much to ask if there’s any coffee in this hellhole.” She shuffles along, one hand scraping along the wall in an effort to keep herself steady. Behind her come the footsteps of the Winter Soldier, trailing her like an imprinted, murderous duckling. If it wouldn’t have been absolute agony on the ribs she definitely hopes are just bruised and not broken, she would laugh at the mental image.
“Active-duty Avengers receive seventy-two hours minimum when new soulbonds are formed,” Coulson explains, and pulls a thin pamphlet from his folder. He unfolds it, pulls a pen out of his inner pocket and presents both to Bucky. “Sign at the bottom, please. You’re on leave starting now.”
“I’ve isolated a clean sandbox in the Cubby cluster. Data transfer is in progress, and is estimated to complete in ten minutes.”
The armor shifts, flattens, angles, streamlines as Toni makes a desperate dive for Steve’s falling form. The idiot is laughing his goddamn head off, arms and legs spread to provide drag against the wind. She isn’t sure, though, if that’s to give her extra seconds to catch up, or because he wants to make the dive last longer.
She had followed in her parents' footsteps, designing luxury clothes and even starting her own separate fashion house right here in Manhattan.
The town was quite small, but was full of farmers with fresh produce, gathered in the square. Before they got out of the truck, Tony slipped on some shades and a cap. Peter would be okay, but Tony couldn’t afford to be recognized, even in this small place.
T’Challa gave him a sympathetic smile and moved to pat his shoulder. “I understand, but keep in mind that his response may not be what you want. People only fight like you and he did when they care too much. You did some damage.”
The kid called him religiously, every day. He pestered Happy to the point that his phone mysteriously fell and broke into minute pieces. Finally, Tony relented. If he could somehow do right by Peter, maybe hope wasn’t all lost.
Tony and Peter had been on the farm for close to three weeks, now and had settled into a a routine of sorts. Tony would tease Peter to no end and Peter eagerly soaked up everything the engineer showed him, asking questions and voicing his own animated thoughts.
By the time he reached the small aircraft, he’d made up his mind—he wasn’t going to leave. Steven Grant Rogers didn’t give up, damnit! He’d stick around, but leave Tony alone for a few days. Maybe if he gave him some time, they could talk more calmly. Hopefully, Rhodey would go back to New York. He knew T’Challa warned him about letting Tony be, but this couldn’t be it for them. He would try to approach Tony again and if he still told Steve to leave, then he would.
“I would never! Just because I left you that one time… But he’s outside trying out some upgrades I made to his suit.”
Peter’s eyes shone brighter every time he looked at a piece of equipment, but by the end of the tour, neither men could stifle a yawn. “Alright, Peter, time for bed, Tony declared. “We can continue Camp Stark tomorrow.” Peter nodded as another yawn betrayed him. “Where will I sleep?” Tony looked up and pointed to some stairs, leading to a second floor. “The room to the right of the stairs is yours. You’ll find a bed already set up, and there’s also a closet, bathroom, and balcony.” There was a kitchen and living room separating the two bedrooms.
Tony was about to interject that Peter wasn’t his son, but decided to go with it. If they wanted to be inconspicuous, this seemed like a good cover. “We’re actually here for the summer. This squirt has always wanted to see the mountains and I figured what better way than to explore them for more than just a few days.”
Steve smiled. The princess had been teasing him endlessly about his uniform, saying he had gone all “dark and edgy”. The thing is, his suit was the one Tony had made him. He only tore at everything he no longer represented, but he couldn’t bear to throw away the only thing that made him feel like Tony was with him, in a way.
“Hey Parker, let’s go inside,” he said, motioning toward the rather large barn near the middle of the farm. “We can star-gaze and braid each other’s hair another night.” Peter gave him a sheepish little smile. “Sorry, it’s just you can never really see the stars in New York. This is all so… magical”. Tony’s heart seized a little and his snarky smile molted into a reassuring grin. “I’m kidding, kid. You’re right, this is quite the view. Let’s go unpack. I need a shower.”
They both stepped out of the car and when Peter took in their surroundings, his eyes went comically wide and his mouth fell into a little o. “Wow, Mister Stark! This is amazing! I’ve never seen mountains in real life before. Are we going to see bears? And the stars, look at all the stars!” Tony let him ramble and grinned at his excitement. He turned to look at the stars that now dotted the blue velvet blanket above. Not bad. Not bad, at all.
The clean air filled his lungs and the slight breeze caressed his hair, giving him a bed-head look, no doubt. He’d forgone a haircut since they’d been in Canada, but he didn’t mind the rogue curls, he now sported. After twenty minutes of walking, he heard the gentle bubbling of a waterfall and began to walk towards it. It lead him to a small clearing, crystal water forming a nice swimming hole.
“Oh my, what have we here?” Said the creature, eyes appraising Steve in a way that gave him chills. “You are a ways off from your village, aren’t you?” Steve gulped and remained frozen. “Answer me, human. You trespassed upon my home and I’m sure you’re aware there are consequences.” He was so dead.
The billionaire wiped off some of the grease that covered his arms as he answered, “You wound me! And I’ll have you know, I haven’t blown anything up. Yet… Joking! Anyway, all good here. The kid and I went to a farmer’s market. I even had vegetable soup, can you believe it?”
“I don’t want us to be like this, worse than strangers. I know I hurt you- I know I broke your trust, but can we just try to be
**************************************************************************************************************
He was almost out of the room before Steve made a decision. He took a deep breath, then half-sprinted after Tony, pulling him into a dark hall when he closed in on him.
“You don’t get to be a successful businessman by playing nice,” Tony shrugged in response. “By the way,” he continued, “you should be having more than coffee for breakfast.” Peter looked at him, unsure of how to say it…”Erm, there isn’t-“.
“Hmm suits you, human. Well Steven, I suggest you find your way home now. I hope you have learned your lesson.” Steve nodded, a weight lifting off his body. And oh wow it didn’t hurt to breath anymore!
There were various welding machines and accessories, a station full of expensive-looking lab equipment, dozens of screens and hologram projectors, and two robots who immediately came forward to greet them, one of them who almost jabbed Peter in the ribs. “Hey you, be careful,” Tony chastised lightly. “His aunt will kill me if he goes back with so much as a scratch.”
“Yes, sorry… No I don’t need new armor. When I do, Shuri will be the first to know,” he said. “I actually wanted to ask for a favor. I know you’ve already done so much, helping Bucky—”
Steve stepper closer, against his better judgement. But the creature was allowing him to leave. He couldn’t very well be ungrateful. He could feel warmth radiating from him, wrapping him in delicious blanket of calm and joy. The fairy took his wrist, tracing swirls of magic to form what looked like a circle with an upside down triangle, the inside glowing a light blue. His touched lingered only a moment and then the spell was over. Why did the thought make him feel sad? “There sun— what might I call you? I think I deserve to know your name, seeing as you are now under my protection. Don’t worry about the mark, it will only be visible to fae.”
He’s abruptly cut off by Tony’s very soft, very real lips on his. It takes him a nanosecond to register what’s happening, but when he does oh, he’s very on board. Suddenly, he’s kissing Tony back, with the intensity in which he carries out a plan on the battlefield, except sparring with Tony’s mouth is a fight he never wants to end.
Peter blushed. “Uh, well, that little boy was me,” he explained. “I wanted to be like you… I still do. I never thought I’d ever actually end up here. But you’re here. You’re actually here and you’re so caring, generous, and— and you made me this sick suit. It all feels so surreal.”
, helped me find my place in this future that was so loud and unfamiliar. You let me in. I went about things in a horrible, horrible way, but please believe that I never wanted any of this to happen. Bucky- he was innocent and I couldn’t let him die, not again.”
again? We’ve been through a lot. I can’t just accept that I can only treat you as a teammate. And I’m not asking for you to jump back into a relationship, but can we start with rebuilding our friendship?”
The next morning, Tony woke to the smell of coffee. His need for coffee overpowering any urge to stay in bed, he threw on his well-worn AC/DC shirt on top of his sweatpants and padded out of his room, to the kitchen. It wasn’t as big as the one in the compound, but no less fancy, decked with a top of the line coffee maker, of course, as well as an industrial stove and a fridge he equipped with F.R.I.D.A.Y.
The genius grinned, pleased, but couldn’t pass up a snarky reply. “Well, I figured I can’t screw him up too badly. His aunt would murder me, anyway!” He heard someone knock on the other side of the phone. Pepper must be in her office. He heard a hushed exchange before she came back on. “Sorry, Tones, works calls. I have meetings all day.” He definitely did not miss that part of SI. “Ugh, say no more,” he replied sympathetically. “We’ll talk later, yeah? Check in to see if I’m still alive,” he joked.
. You knew the whole time. So spare me the bullshit. If there was anyone you didn’t want to hurt it was yourself.”
Suddenly, Steve felt like the biggest jerk, but before he could say as much, Tony pulled him down, hands cupping his jaw. “But maybe after he leaves, you and I can have our own lab meeting.” He waggled his eyebrows.
Steve’s insides iced over and before he can stop himself, the words tumbled from his mouth. “Yeah. Gonna “meet” him at your lab, right?” He laughed bitterly. Oh shit.
he did in Siberia, and during the Accords, and Tony especially loved that part where Steve told him the truth about his parents. Oh wait.
That’s how Tony found himself driving to Canada with Peter. He had convinced the boy’s aunt to let him out of her sight for four months, telling her he was offering Peter an exclusive opportunity to intern for him abroad, all expenses paid. The teenager was over the moon, of course, unfailing to mumble an embarrassed expression of gratitude at least once an hour. Tony had found and subsequently purchased an isolated farm in Canada’s wilderness. Sure, he could have had his private jet fly them in, but he wanted to be as off the radar as possible. He couldn’t be completely off, of course. Ross would go nuts. Rhodey agreed to keep the fort down in that aspect and Tony made himself reachable to Ross for emergencies on a secure, untraceable line. He did plan it out, see? Oh, and he left that stupid, relic of a phone with Rhodey. He would never need Steve Rogers. Right?
Silent tears were now flowing both of their faces, as if trying to dry out the pain invading their bodies.
Steve didn’t miss the slight snarl. He hadn’t even thought about mentioning Bucky. And Tony knew their location all this time? He could have had them arrested at any time, but he didn’t… When had this all gone to hell?
The king’s voice startled him back. “I will have Okoye take you to get one of our planes. Good luck, Captain.”
Snapping out of his unpleasant thoughts, he awkwardly patted Peter on the back. Baby steps. “No problem, Spiderling. And I’m Tony Stark, of course I’m the best.” He cleared his throat, stepped back and resumed walking, to another part of the barn. He went on to show Peter the welding station, computer area, the bots’ charging stations, and the emergency exits, should they ever need to use them.
They took turns experimenting with making meals and they were actually edible most of the time. Sometimes, they’d watch movies, often resulting in popcorn wars. It reminded Tony of the team movie nights. He pretended he didn’t feel a pang in his chest, and quickly pushed the memories away. These were new memories.
The dark-haired man winked. “It looks like our paths have crossed again, Steve Rogers. Now, what do you say we go join the dance?” He held out his hand.
“You’re incorrigible, Rogers!” He thew his head back and laughed. “If you must know, he has a beautiful ’67 Impala and we were going to see what gadgets we could deck her out with.”
When Steve was satisfied that Winchester was no longer in the room, he looked at Tony who was not very happy, with him, apparently. “What the hell, Rogers? You just met the guy and you act like he’s a Hydra agent you want to take down.”
He could stand out here all night, but the temperature had dropped and neither of them was wearing a jacket, and he couldn’t wait for Peter to see the inside of the “barn”.
He was aware that his pig-headedness was what got him into all of this in the first place, but he had to believe that it’d also aid him in making things right with his love. He couldn’t lose the best thing that had happened to him. Tony was working on getting all of them back, but the thought of only having the beautiful man back as a teammate and nothing more was utterly devastating. Not when he knew what being loved by Tony Stark was like. He didn’t think his heart would be able to take it, serum be damned.
He quickly engaged the suit in its entirety and slipped from whoever was holding him. He hovered over the water and turned—
Tony’s face turned positively livid. For a second. Steve thought, hoped even, that Tony was going to hit him, but instead he clenched his fists to his sides and stepped back onto the balls of his feet. His eyes remained locked on Steve’s. “You lost the right to ask that,” he spat out in a chillingly soft tone, making the soldier flinch.
Finally, someone who understands, Tony thought, amused. It’s a genius thing, he supposed. He almost voiced his agreement, but thought he should make sure Peter had proper nutrition. “It’s definitely mind fuel, kid, but you should drink a kale smoothie every once in a while. They’re actually not that bad.” See, he could be a good influence!
After what felt like minutes later, his phone rang three times before he noticed. It was Rhodey. Unprompted, Friday cut the music. “Fri, put him through.”
One of the two was Tony, of course. He was wearing a charcoal black suit with a heather green dress shirt that accentuated his olive skin. His hair, curly since he’d grown it out a bit, was artfully styled. Steve didn’t know why that other man was still talking to the billionaire. He certainly didn’t have any business touching Tony’s arm.
Tony’s face was blank, carefully smoothed to not betray any emotion, but his eyes could never lie. “A broken team doesn’t really work, does it? This is bigger than me or you. It always has been. It had never been my intention to break it in the first place. See, it isn’t
He hadn’t realized he had been staring at the floor, head bowed in shame, but he mustered all his strength to gain enough composure to look up at Tony. “Is that True, Tony?” He swallowed the knot in his throat. “You’e doing that for us?”
The boy leapt onto the bed and hugged him. “You passed out, and— and I didn’t know what to do. The captain said you were having a panic attack, but I just kept shooting him and tried to get you up, a—“
As greetings go, it’s not the worst one Phil’s ever gotten from her. He makes his way across the office, setting her cup carefully on her desk. “Good morning, Dr. Stark. Coffee?”
She stays still for a moment, because she’s never been the best at waking up and recognizing what’s going on. “You’re not Bucky,” she says.
", the Cossack Lullaby. The lines Natasha sings, according to the translation I used, mean "You'll look like a hero and be a Cossack in your heart/soul. Sleep, my angel, sweetly, calmly. Bayushki bayu." (a basically untranslatable phrase, used to lull children to sleep)
Rhodey gives her a slow, one-arm squeeze. “Selwyn from Berkeley developed the nano mask so Toni Stark didn’t have the patent and design stolen by her father,” he says gently. “I still don’t know why you’d want to hide your marks.” She side-eyes him. He shakes his head and grins. “C’mon, Tones. I may not be a child prodigy with an intellect approaching Einstein’s…”
“I have no fuckin’ clue what any of that last bits are supposed to mean,” he says, and the steady slide and click of the gun coming expertly apart in his hands is soothing. “But if I can have a rocket launcher, you got a deal.”
“World’s greatest, he keeps saying,” Carol says to Rhodey, crunching more popcorn. “I wasn’t very impressed though.”
To his credit, Clint doesn’t try to play coy or dumb, just eyes Tony steadily. “As best I can,” he says. “Gonna yell at me some more about it?”
She closes her eyes and lets her head sink back against the rich Corinthian leather of Howard’s chair. She just wants this day to be done with. She wants to shake the dust of New York off her shoes and fly back to Malibu, lie in the sun for a bit to recharge her batteries, get together with Pepper and keep their plans for world domination rolling.
Goddammit. Pepper couldn’t make her cry, but JARVIS just might. “Thanks, J. I love you too.” She runs her hands through her hair, making a face at the tangles her fingers catch on. Christ, she’s got to pull herself together and go mingle with a room of superspies and government agents and people with metaphysical connections to her soul, and somehow convince them all that she’s perfectly okay and happy to be amongst them, when all she wants to do is curl up in her bed and sleep for a month.
“Probably not.” Natasha brushes Toni’s hair out of her eyes, tucking the loose strands behind her ear, and Toni’s head tilts in the direction of the gesture automatically. Natasha isn’t usually so open with her touches; it must have been bad. “You miraculously managed to avoid needing stitches this time, but you pulled a few muscles, managed to collect an impressive array of bruises.” She pulls her hand back. “Bruised your ribs on the left side. They’re going to hurt like hell for a few days.”
He hesitates, tilts his head at her, gaze dark and far away for a moment. She’s pretty sure she knows what he’s going to ask, and she has a perfectly genuine smile ready for him when he does. “You mind if I bunk in with Stevie?”
Suddenly bashful, she ducks her head, feels her cheeks reddening, is absolutely horrified that she’s reduced to being awkward and shy. “You know me,” she says lightly. “Never been able to not advertise.” She raises a hand, letting the glove portion flow into the wristplates, baring her hands, and smooths her palm over the chevrons. “You look good in it. Like I should feel bad about debasing a national icon with my widely-reported debauch lifestyle.”
“Your physical symptoms do not match those I have on file from previous panic attacks, ma’am. I believe you are experiencing what is known in medical circles as
Distantly, he’s horrified at himself, wants desperately to stop, but the words are pouring out, cruel and careless. “You’re supposed to be a fucking genius, but you’re the dumbest fuckin’ person I’ve ever met.”
Unease creeps up the back of his spine, settles into a knot in the base of his skull. A name sifts out of the mire of his jumbled thoughts, accompanied by the sound of that voice crying as it calls his name, before the water and the cold and the---
“That’s a shame. If you didn’t hate me, I’d tell you that there’s a pint of Ben & Jerry’s in the freezer for you.”
be your soulmate in public. It solves a whole bunch of problems. You look like I’m going to whip out a knife and go American Psycho on you.”
The air whuffs out of him, and he crashes backwards, away from her, through a reinforced wall, and disappears into the gloomy room in a flurry of drywall dust and disturbed papers.
and Bucky knows that. He could say he wants a trip to the fucking moon, and Toni would build him a rocket ship. But what he wants is much simpler. She's already doing it. “Finish my arm,” he says firmly, and palms her cheek. “Sick of carrying this Hydra shit. Much rather carry yours. Have you with me always.”
His forehead furrows, changes mental tracks to think on that new piece of intel for a bit. “You feelin’ okay, Toni?”
She drops out onto the next floor through an overhead vent. It’s awkward and painful with only one hand available, and the blood slicking her hand makes her grip slip, sending her crashing down. She lands badly, wrenching her ankle. Keeps hobbling along. She’s almost there; just another few dozen feet. Overhead and behind, she hears the crash of the security door giving way, knows he’ll find the trap door she left deliberately open. Captain America’s a smart man. He’ll figure it out.
He stares for a long time after her, wondering exactly how fucked the world would be if she was ever inclined to conquer it. Decides he doesn’t want to know, because some things are best left unexplored. He turns to the fridge and starts making himself that sandwich, hands moving mechanically in the assembly of meat and bread and cheese and veggies, thinking and thinking and thinking.
He pulls her out of her chair and gives her a very tight, very warm hug. “I was just going to say that all of that you said? Is probably a smart call. We got this for you.”
Or maybe that’s his own goddamn guilt talking. Bucky doesn’t know. He’s too goddamn tired to keep track. His enhanced body might be able to stay awake and on his feet for days at a time, but there are some kinds of exhaustion that are beyond its abilities to cure.
“He… you and him …. are a lot alike,” he gasps. “Stubborn asses. Hit your limit and just blow up. Tempers like Satan himself.” He chuckles, rusty and croaking. “God, the grief he usta give me, keeping his ass from getting beaten up. Thousand pounds of attitude in a hundred pound body.” He blinks, tries to bring her into focus. “He’d like you too. He draws. C’n see you two, you know, down here. You, lost in your wires and fuses, him, lost in his sketching. God, that’d be somethin’ to see.” He blinks hard, swallows hard, tries to wet his lips.
“Quite, ma’am. Agent Coulson has requested I add a meeting to your schedule for 1pm, topics to be discussed will include the SHIELD assault on the Manor property. Ms. Potts would like a conference call when you have a free moment.”
No matter which way he pulls at it, he can conclude one thing for sure: Schmidt is afraid of the Phoenix. He doesn't know why, though he can make a few educated guesses, but the why doesn't really matter. What matters is that he needs to find and recruit Tony as soon as possible. He's spent years cultivating the man's loyalty and love. Maybe it's finally time to capitalize on that.
Toni snorts, and casually flips him off when he pauses to throw her his most charming smile. “I can't keep up with super soldiers going balls out, true,” she says with a smirk. “Which is why you are both going to slow your magnificent asses to my speed. Or, at the very least, keep said asses where I can comfortably leer at them as we go.”
“Bucky should go,” Toni continues, turning back to the room at large. “Rhodey and Carol. You’re the ones who can handle a supersoldier if he’s really flipped his nut. Clint and Tash are the best at infiltration and intelligence-gathering. Coulson, you’ll probably want to be on site in case things go tits-up which, let’s face it, they usually do. So that leaves me here to hold down the fort. Which is fine. I have JARVIS and FitzSimmons to keep me company. Also distracted. I haven’t had a good sciencing in awhile. It’ll keep me busy. And I’ll stay on comms in case you need another suit.”
“With any luck, there are home videos around. After all, why should I have to suffer alone with that memory?” Toni slides back onto his lap, wrapping an arm around his back to secure her seat and resting her head against his shoulder.
” He turns in time to catch her, staggers back a couple of paces and slides his arms under her ass as she jumps. Her legs wrap around his waist, feet locking at the small of his back, and her hands fist in his loose hair, gripping tight. “I don’t fucking
not happening. Hasn't since I found where they were keeping you. Jesus, James. I would never do that to you.”
They slam through the far wall, exploding past layers of concrete and aluminum, and spill into a cavernous underground chamber, half in shadow.
“There are words,” Carol says, slightly strangled, and Tony looks to where she’s flying off to his left, “that should never, ever be uttered again.”
“Monitor the situation and keep me informed. Better opportunities will come to recruit Mr. Stark to the cause, Commander.” Schmidt gives a smirk that manages to be slimy and suggestive, an impressive feat with Schmidt's bone structure. “Wait for one. That is an order, not a suggestion. Hail Hydra.”
hair out of her eyes. She grimaces, feeling the tack of blood cracking on her face. “Okay, more like six or seven times. You never seem to remember, though.”
Clint snorts, and the legs of his chair bang down on the floor as he drops his feet from the rail. “No need to fight over who gets to go first,” he says. “I’m sure there’ll be more than enough goons for everyone to have their fun.”
“They’ll be fine,” Clint says suddenly, drumming his fingers on his thigh. It sounds less like he’s reassuring Bucky and Natasha, and more like he’s trying to convince himself.
One by one, the items on the digital checklist JARVIS helpfully displayed turn green, and Toni’s grin just gets ewider. Anticipation builds in her gut, nervous energy that makes her feet want to jitter, her stomach tie in knots. She all but bounces in place, watching impatiently as the final few items run through their tests.
- Mostly violence and the effects of mental manipulation. Identity crisis. Science. Adulting like a champ. Did I mention the violence? Shitloads of it, folks.
Deep in the back of her head, she knows what he’s doing. He’s deliberately riling her up so her anger will override everything else that might be holding her back. It’s effective, she has to admit; even though she knows it’s just a trick, it’s working a little too well.
Toni stops in the middle of the hall, just past the turn-off to where she built the forge, and eyes him speculatively. He’s flushed and excited, all glittering eyes and hopeful smile. Which falters almost immediately at whatever he’s seeing on her face. “Sorry,” he mutters. “It is a bit much to ask.”
- and the skirt of her black dress slides up her thigh. But there’s no one here, no one to impress, and she doesn’t care how much leg she’s showing to an empty room.
“Shh, I know.” He pulls her close in a one-armed embrace, presses his lips to her temple. “But you can’t do it right now. It’s okay. I understand. Come to bed, huh? Let me look after you. Let us look after you.”
It usually does, because he's so ridiculously lost on her. He’s smiling as he opens the chat messenger, wondering what silly thing she’s found for him this time.
Her best bet is to not get killed, wait for backup. Can she stay alive long enough for someone to get to her? How long would that be? Wonders how long it’s been since her call to Coulson got dropped. Tries to do the math in her head. At least five minutes to retreat and extract, fifteen minutes tops to haul ass back here, another two or three to find her, maybe. It’s been half that, she thinks, maybe a little less, since she talked to Coulson.
With vision-dimming effort, she flips the release catches of her armor and drags herself out. With one hand still gauntleted, she crawls over to where the Winter Soldier is stirring, uncoordinated and loose-limbed.
Clint's eyes focus with frightening speed. “Jack Flag is dead,” he says. “Something went completely tits up on a mission he and Free Spirit were running with Cap in Bagalia. He ended up in a coma, and never came out.”
Tony opens his eyes and meets Clint’s stricken expression with a steady look. “It was Bruce’s,” he says simply, and pretends not to notice when Clint’s face crumples into grief. “I’m sorry he put you in that position, and I’m sorry I blamed you. I was wrong. It’s not your fault. It’s his.”
He dreams of fire and ice, snow and flame. He dreams of smoke and ash drifting in the still, forest air. Of cheering chorus girls and lifting a motorcycle above his head. A dancing monkey punching the face of evil in the name of patriotism.
Toni has spent more than ten years in a stable, open relationship with Clint, and there is a bond there that even Natasha, with her soulmarked arrowhead mingled with the red hourglass above her left breast, cannot ever hope to approach. Natasha knows how to look at things, how to take someone’s true measure. She knows that, at times, Clint was all Toni had. She knows that, at times, Toni was all Clint had. If Natasha had ever had that sort of relationship with another person, she would fight to the death to keep it, to hoard it, even from that other person’s soulmate. Natasha doesn’t share. She is greedy, and the good things she has, she deserves to keep all for herself.
The image of a face churns, surges, breaks the surface for just a moment. A gentle, elderly man with a kind smile. An echo, distant and tinny:
of this is real. It was a long night’s sleep to him, one minute crashing into the ice and sinking into the ocean and the next waking up to a brand new world. But it wasn’t just a long night’s sleep. It was
Carol shakes her head slowly, but her eyes don’t leave Tony’s. “Honestly?” She shrugs. “I don’t know, Tony. But I’ll try.”
His phone rings just after he swipes his access card through the reader on the secured elevator leading down to the long-term residency floors. He sighs faintly, because he really doesn’t have time to take a call, but it’s his personal phone, and of the handful of people to whom he’s given the number, he can’t think of one that wouldn’t constitute a priority call. He pulls it from his pocket as the ringtone sounds again, tilts it so he can see the caller ID.
Quill is the first to stir and groan, sitting up in what looks to be some discomfort, but one by one, they all follow suit until they’re blinking in dazed shock and rubbing temple, necks, foreheads, throats. And Tony stands, tense as an overcoiled spring, too tense to relax enough for his armor with its fucking Phoenix emblem to go away and return his jeans and tee and sneakers, as they all turn their eyes to him.
Coulson, bless him, never loses his calm because Coulson’s just like that. Toni’s fairly sure a nuclear warhead could fall out of the sky on top of his head and he wouldn’t even blink. Toni isn’t at all sure how he’s even tracking all of the words flying at him right now, but he’s bouncing back and forth between them all with hardly a pause for breath.
“You don't need enabling,” Natasha replies. “You have those sorts of ideas all on your own, with no help needed from me.”
“I do indeed, Captain,” JARVIS says, and a dark monitor across the room obligingly lights up to display a document, written with Toni’s neat, block-letter printing. “I’m afraid ma’am made it about as far as you have before she became overwhelmed and sought your assistance.”
“I’m going to be hauling that woman out of the rabbit hole for the rest of my goddamn life,” he grumbles under his breath. “Thanks, J.”
Desperately, she gets a hand up, fast and hard, deflecting the shield strike into the wall. The edge bites deep enough to hold him for a precious second. She capitalizes by slamming her other palm into his chest and firing her repulsors as hard as she dares against human flesh.
He stays there for a moment, catching his breath, recentering his mind to the calmness he needs in battle. “Mark III,” he mutters, picking himself up out of the ruins of the suit and shaking his head to clear the dust from his hair. Iron Man has killer robots after all.
She spoke it quietly, but firmly. “We must do nothing. Her visions will not come to pass for quite some time, until our sons are men grown. We will
Tony hears the disappointment in the Avengers’ thoughts long before anyone comes up to the roof to find him. Despite Steve’s intel on where the Red Skull had based his operations all this time, he somehow managed to get away yet again, leaving only an empty apartment behind.
He’s already in Steve’s mind, already knows this was a trap. He doesn’t care as much as he should, because this trap works both ways. Just as much to his advantage as it is to Steve’s, maybe even more so. He only gets split seconds to read intent in Steve’s thoughts before they become actions, but Tony’s brain doesn’t need longer than split seconds to make all his calculations.
time, when it’s failed the fifty times before. “You’re pissing away a solid partnership that’s endured for over sixty years. The Stark name was founded on its relationship with the US military, and the men and women in uniform depend on SI technology to keep them alive.”
“If you can still talk, he’s doing it wrong,” Clint says, and it’s the smirk that snaps Bucky’s temper, still frayed and threadbare with lingering irrational jealousy.
He pins her to the mattress with a hand around her throat, teeth bared and other hand reaching for a knife that he can’t find. When was he disarmed? How did he get here? He doesn’t know his mission parameters, can’t remember his assignment.
JARVIS’s silence is damning, but the hiss of the armor panels shifting, retracting, reforming is answer enough. Toni falls out of her armor, landing hard on her hands and knees -- and
A maddeningly familiar voice, leashed fury and pain and rage and grief: "You done, or am I gonna have to knock some more fucking sense into you?"
To the left of where her fist is a blue circle with the bright white outline of a triangle inside. Just like her arc reactor.
Steve’s head hangs so low all Toni can see is the top of his hair, thick and fine and so pretty she has the overwhelming urge to bury her hands in the strands and soothe away his aches and fears. “You find her over there,” he whispers, fierce and hopeless, “don’t tell her what she’s got waiting for her back here. She won’t come if you do. She won’t want me, sickly and scrawny as I am. And I can’t wreck it for you, so you just make something up, Buck.”
“Better not be,” Toni huffs, and Bucky grins like a besotted idiot as he watches her go over to pay Steve the same attention she’d just paid him. The feel of their affection for him and each other quietly washing through him is just as new as it ever was, and he hopes it never gets old.
She takes it from him, turns it over in her hands, frowns a little. “It’s okay,” she says soothingly. “It’s just a phone. I mean, it’s a pretty fucked-up phone, but I can fix it, no sweat.”
Jemma smiles, her whole face bright and happy, and he feels the last of his reticence crumble away. That smile always makes him go weak in the knees. “Don’t worry, Fitz. Everything will be fine.”
Light flared in the corner of her eye, and she turned instinctively to see its source. A tall, blond man, strong and determined, face a mask of pain and resolve, stood in the iris of the star itself. She blinked, and she was before him, close enough to touch him. He looked familiar, a little bit like her father, she thought, as she studied his face. There was pain in him, recent and heavy, grief weighing around his shoulders almost like a cloak, red with the blood of those he’d lost.
“You think he’s going to be able to be happy and safe with you across the country?” she says. “You think I’m going to do anything but worry about you on your own? You think we’ll be safe and happy without you here?”
(Only half as long as the previous chapter. The end of scene 2 was just too good a stopping point in my editing.)
He doesn’t have to wait long, and he doesn’t have to move at all to intercept her, because when she shimmers into sight, she’s right in front of him and glaring at with her hands on her hips.
Steve’s shadow falls over her, and she looks up to see him with his face twisted to something unrecognizable in its anger.  The shield is over his head, edge gleaming above her, a two-handed strike that will probably decapitate her if it hits.
“Children,” she says with a tiny, derisive snort, watching Clint slide under an obstacle only to kick it directly into Bucky’s path. Bucky vaults it without missing a beat, but hip-checks the next hard enough to send it sliding at Clint who rolls over it the second it’s close enough. “JARVIS, are Rhodey and Carol ready?”
The Winter Soldier’s gleaming metal arm, now dented and sparking and streaked with scorch marks, cocks back. She grits her teeth. “
Clint has proven immune to her dirtiest death-glare, but that never stops her from sending them his way. She grumbles and grumps wordlessly as she straightens her workout clothes around her, then stretches her arms with a grimace. “Remind me why I hired you again?”
The Phoenixbuster fires, and Tony is blinded momentarily by the brilliance of the flare. Before the spots can fully clear from his eyes, alarms start whooping again, radiation warnings and impact alerts, and the backwash of Phoenix fire washes over him, through him, and just for a moment, he's burning alive. It's in his skin, his lungs, his blood, his brain, and he can't breathe, can't think, can't scream.
Toni just eyes him steadily. “A great many things,” she says, “but this isn’t one of them. You’re my soulmate. That trumps everything else. In fact, here. JARVIS,” she says, raising her voice.
“I am a fucking grown-up, Barnes! You don’t get to tell me what to do! Leave me alone, I’m fine!” She makes another attempt to get around him, is too sluggish for how quick she tries to move and trips over her own feet.
she wants to say, but Bucky is warm and she’s too drained to argue with either of them. It’s easier to just close her eyes and do what they say for a little while.
His ears roar with dull noise, and he shoves away from the table violently, suddenly overcome with the need to pace. Heedless of the fact that he’s just silenced the discussion, uncaring that all eyes are on him, he stalks towards the window at the other end of the room.
He's lost at sea here, has been since the moment he woke up. Here, on the Moon, in the den of the Tower after he crash-landed back down to earth. For a moment, he’d let himself think that everything could just go on the same as it had before, that despite his changes, Steve was unchanged and together, maybe they’d figure out a solution to this weird twist in Tony’s life.
It’s awkward and fumbling, feet skidding on the wet shower floor. Toni screeches like a cat when her back hits the cold tile wall, twisting hard enough to jar her hip. Bucky overbalances trying to lift her with one arm, tries to correct and bangs his temple into the showerhead, swears mightily. Somehow, they manage to not kill themselves as they scramble and slip, end up sprawled on the shower floor, her legs around his hips, his hand splayed across her back, her fingers threaded through her hair, joined together and laughing their asses off with the water pounding down on them.
He can’t afford to lose Tony. Not if he wants to accelerate his planned coup for the Red Skull. He’s already laid a lot of the fundamental groundwork over the years, but a single misstep now could cost him everything.
“Well then. No time like the present. Send him to kill Stark and retrieve the Winter Soldier. That should prove to be an adequate test of his abilities.” The man smiles at him, and his eyes are cold and malevolent. “Ah. I believe the good Captain is attempting to break free of your conditioning, Johann. Should I be concerned?”
She doesn’t see the blow coming, but she feels it. Her head snaps to the side, cheek stinging. She raises a hand to her cheek, and doesn’t have to fake either the wide, shocked eyes or the tremor in her fingers as she turns to look up at Obadiah. “What the hell, Uncle Obie?” The tinge of fear in her voice, now
Toni smiles and cups his cheek. “You’re just that kind of asshole,” she says fondly. “It’s not me, it’s you.”
The mansion is quiet when Steve walks back through the door, bag under his arm. He pauses for a moment, but can’t even feel the vibrations through the floor that the soundproofing in Toni’s workshop doesn’t quite contain. He nods to himself, smiling in satisfaction. Toni must still be out putting her new armor through its paces.
For only having met her ten minutes ago, Colonel Carol Danvers strikes her as a woman who detests being treated as an invalid.
until he wants to reach into his skin and claw them out. Only iron discipline keeps him from doing so much as twitching.
“Sign the form, Barnes,” Rhodey says, coming around to clap him on the back. “I’m going to go pull strings and make sure there’s no issue with your flight path.”
He rolls his eyes and reaches around her to knock firmly on the door, hears the mutter of sleepy voices grumbling inside, the shuffle of bodies in motion. “Yep. I'm good.”
) Her legs have months of strength training. It’s child’s play to leap, slide her legs over his shoulders, lock his head in her knees. She has a second to relish the look of utter shock on his face, and then she throws her weight back and down.
Tony chokes and splutters, coughs until his lungs hurt, and squints at Steve through watery eyes. Steve’s laughing at him, bright and happy, lit up like a goddamn Christmas tree and as delighted as a kid finding the presents under it. “You’re not supposed to say things like that,” Tony croaks, clears his throat. “I think I missed a few things in your head if you’re saying things like that.”
“Well, Howard didn’t exactly have the permission of the Wakandan government to play around with their sacred metals,” Toni says, reaching out in an unspoken request for the shield.
“M’sorry,” Toni slurs, and kisses his ear gently as she rocks her hips in a slow and lazy rhythm, riding him until he softens and slips out of her. “Shoulda locked th’ door. Y’with me?”
She arches an eyebrow, and relaxes back in the chair, swinging it from side to side. “How much of that did you see and/or overhear?”
Neither one of them are looking at Rhodey, they're looking at each other with the kind of conspiratorial commiseration that Toni's
Toni rubs her jaw grumpily, but says nothing about the bruises she’s sure to develop, because Natasha is right. “What happened, anyway? I'm a little fuzzy on…” She trails off as memories surface, then blinks and scrabbles at her shirt until she pulls it clear of her chest.
He keeps cover behind the shield, deflecting the ray blasts away from him, and is taken completely by surprise when the armor shoots forward, flying down the hall to snag him around the chest and drive him back. The moment the armor touches him, Steve absolutely loses his head in a haze of red and fury, and goes away for a moment or two.
Her eyes open, dazed and lost and gorgeous, focus on him, jolts him from coiling need right to the edge. “I love you,” she rasps shakily. And
After a shower and a fresh change of clothes, she towels her hair dry and wanders into the kitchen. Just like Steve’s note via JARVIS promised, there’s a plate of food sitting in the warmer, and coffee in the pot. She eats her breakfast sandwich over the sink and drinks her first cup of coffee while she’s at it. She pours another cup, then heads down to the workshop to sink some time into some things she needs to do.
“And I thought you needed more PT before you used the suit. Are you okay? Your legs…If you’re in pain and flew all the way here…”
Steve froze. It couldn’t be. He took a deep breath and turned to find the source of the voice and found a pair of familiar eyes twinkling at him. But they belonged to a man. A man who looked only a bit older than himself. And several inches taller. But it was. It was his fairy. “Éamon?”
Then that Spider kid came along. He was like, well, like a pest. Pun intended. Tony tried to keep him at arm’s length. He didn’t want to screw someone else up. The kid was persistent, though and Tony admired that. He had so much potential, immense brilliance and was still full of innocence. Tony saw himself in him sometimes, but Peter was so pure and, god, oh so young.
She apparently, was not amused. “Don’t joke about that! But yes, we’ll be in touch,” she affirmed, “and Tony? You know I’m here for you, right?” Tony felt a small pang in his heart. Even if they weren’t together, she would forever be one of his best friends.
“I’ll give you a quick tour, though.” Peter quickly followed as Tony began to walk toward the lab area. Tony turned to the boy. “There are all sorts of test tubes, containers, chemicals, and whatever else you might need,” the engineer explained. “If you ever need anything that’s not here, we can always order it. It won’t be delivered here, but we can pick it up.  I’m not really the alchemist but I know you like all this stuff, so this will pretty much be your space.”
“We will leave and give you privacy,” Nakia said. “I will see you later, my love” she added, looking at T’Challa. Steve’s eyes followed the women until the door closed behind them.
He really would have continued in his self-wallowing, but every time he looked at Rhodey, his heart broke all over again. Yeah, he was progressing and doing well with the prosthetics Tony had designed, but Tony would never forgive himself for what happened. However, with each passing day, that guilt and heartache was soon followed by a deep fire that started as a small ember, a burning desire to do better, be better.
“No worries,” Dean said, looking from Steve to Tony. “I should go look for Sam anyway. Otherwise, he’d stay here all night. See you later at the lab?” Tony smiled delightedly. “Of course!”
Oh. OH. Rhodey was going to kill Rogers. Geeze, all he wanted was a summer in the mountains with his kid… no, the kid. Now, he was going to probably have to help Rhodey hide the body of America’s golden boy because, honestly, Tony doubted he could muster the energy to  hold him back. Damn it, Rogers.
Rhodey left the next morning. Tony watched him take off, until he disappeared into the sky. He’d decided to leave Peter to his devices for the day. He wouldn’t be the best teacher, with his mind all over the place. After several cups of coffee, he found himself walking outside, toward the forest.
He shot up and thought about running, but before he could move, he heard the slightest rustle and his hair stood on end. His knees were about to give out from under him, but he wasn’t about to faint now. Jaw set and fists clenched, nails digging into his palms, he slowly turned around.
Rhodey sighed, but nodded defeatedly. He pulled Tony to him and enveloped him a rather terrifying bear hug. “If you need anything- anything, Tony, you call me.”
While Peter ran in to retrieve it, Tony took out his glasses and surveyed the area. “Friday, show me heat signatures.” He scanned for a few seconds, seeing only nocturne animals roaming between the trees. Suddenly, he picked up a human, a large one at that. And it was getting closer, fast.
“Nope. Not happening. I made Pete a promise and I’m not going to cut his summer short just because Captain Lumberjack made an appearance.” He clasped his best friend’s shoulder in assurance. “Besides, if you disappear for too long, Ross will freak out and send a search party. Please?”
Yet, this boy who embodied all things pure, cared about him, looked up to him, and he didn’t quite know what to do with it. It made him happy all the same, a space in his chest adjusting to fit Peter.
Tony hadn’t moved his arms. Howard never hugged him. Not many people ever did, really. And everyone who did had either died or hurt him. Obe tried to kill him, Pepper left him. And Steve, oh Steve beat him to a bloody pulp and left him to die, alone in the cold of Siberia. The only exception was Rhodey.  So yeah, Tony Stark didn’t really know how to react when he was confronted with this kind of physical affection.
“Morning, Mister Stark,” Peter greeted cheerfully. “The coffee is fresh. I took the liberty of making some. I mean, it should be considered a food group. I’m pretty sure my body is 80% coffee.”
“Traitor,” Tony muttered, without any heat. Rhodey did seem slightly appeased, though. “Glad to know you’ve got someone taking care of you, Iron Dummy.”
“I don’t even know what “us” means. What were we? A pair of broken men trying to piece each other together only to break each other again? I admit that I didn’t go about the Accords the right way, but you couldn’t trust me to know what I was doing, to work them in our favor, with time. Yet I placed all my trust in you, when I shouldn’t have. You lied. You lied and even as my partner, as the love of my life not only  did you decide for me, but you chose someone else over me. Instead of working to find a way where you didn’t have to choose. You could have told me and asked for my help.  Do you know what it felt like? To be left behind, alone, broken— to see you walking away?”
Tony couldn’t see him, but he knew Rhodey was smiling. “Just making sure you haven’t blown up the mountains, Iron dummy.”
He licked his lips and continued, “Don’t tell the others, yeah? I don’t want anything to mess this all up before it’s all put in place.”
“So what, I can only have one attractive blonde friend? Is that it?” Tony looked at him, eyes glinting as if daring him.
Tony winced, hoping Peter hadn’t been hit if it was the ricochet web. “Uh, I think the kid hit the window with one of the web combinations. I better make sure he didn’t hurt himself.”
. The surprise was evident on Steve’s face. “You go back to the others. We’ll all be back soon enough. And when that happens, we just take it one day at a time.”
The old man smiled and nodded in agreement. “That’s the way to do it. If you ever need a guide, feel free to ask. I may be old, but I’m still running, and I know my way around these mountains.” He held his hand out. “I’m Bill, by the way.” Tony shook it and smiled. “Nice to meet you, Bill. I’m Edward and this is Peter,” Tony said turning to young man, who hadn’t stopped smiling sheepishly since Tony referred to him as his son.  Bill extended his hand to toward him and shook his hand, as well.
“Deserve what,” Steve inquired, curiosity winning over any sense of self-preservation. He wouldn’t blame Rhodey for punching his face in.
. Not the manic, I’ve-been-up-for-over-72-hours tired, no. His eyes reflected the kind of somber wariness that came with pain, like the light was being systematically snuffed out. His face was hard, and Steve almost wanted him to yell. It would have been better than the alternative, because yelling meant he cared, right? Yelling meant he had something to work with, a sign that what they had was still salvageable.
He hadn’t exactly expected to be welcomed with open arms, but he wasn’t prepared for Spider-Man to be there, let alone pelt him with- what were those, taser webs? He could take a wild guess as to who had designed those. Oh, Tony. Watching him fall to the ground when he saw Steve was heartbreaking. He used to be the person who
“It’s fine, kid. She only followed my orders. I’m glad you were there, too… Well, let’s get on with it, as they say.”
“Nice to meet you, Captain Rogers,” Dean drawled. Damn, even the guy’s voice was attractive. “Uh- you, too, Mr. Winchester,” Steve replied stiffly. Dean chuckled “Call me Dean.” Winchester raised an eyebrow and frowned at the soldier’s silence and rigid stance. “Who pissed on your shield this morning?”
The boy scrunched up his nose and looked at him as if Tony had insulted Aunt May. “It is the nectar of the gods and it would be blasphemous of me to drink a grass smoothie!”
Tony learned that Peter could, in fact, cook. Or at least make killer grilled cheese sandwiches. “They were my favorite food when I was a kid,” Peter told him over bites of the sandwich. They graciously dipped the sandwiches in hearty portions of the vegetable soup the mom at the market had given them. It was one of the best meals Tony had eaten in months.
“Hey, you want to scowl any harder there, Cap?” Natasha laughed, amused which earned her the trademark Captain America glare. Steve ignored her and continued staring across the room, blue eyes fixated on the pair of men who were currently deep in conversation.
Now, he was on the cusp of 20, and he still thought of the beautiful fairy from time to time. One of those times being the present. The village was celebrating the winter solstice. It seemed everyone was dancing ‘round the bonfire. He stared into the glowing flames, the embers reminding him of Éamon’s glowing eyes.
He was about to call for Peter, when the boy appeared next to him, wearing his suit. “There’s definitely someone here,” he said, still scanning,”And he’s getting closer. Almost here. Get ready.”
He felt the taller man’s smile against his cheek, as he pulled him closer “Good. That’s wonderful. Although, I suppose— I suppose you may call me Antaine.”
him— his ma would absolutely have a heart attack, Steve thought as he made his way further into the forest. The sun was setting fast and only fools dared to travel through the forest at night- few walked those paths even in the daylight. The fae were rumored to inhabit the forest and Steve had grown up hearing stories about all sorts of strange and scary things that could happen.
When they reached the farm, the sun was setting, casting an ethereal glow from the mountains that were mostly green, now that it was summer, but still capped in glittering snow. Peter had fallen asleep in the car, head tilted back, mouth slightly ajar. He looked so peaceful that Tony almost didn’t want to wake him up, but he figured the kid would appreciate sleeping in a bed more. “Hey, Petey-kins, wakey wakey; we’re here.” He gently nudged the boy’s shoulder until he began to stir awake.
“Of course,” Peter replied. The older man began walking out of the kitchen as he said, “Let’s get dressed and I’ll meet you downstairs in 15.”
The two men gathered wood they’d chopped earlier in the week and quickly got a fire going. They carried a couple of stumps over and perched on them, in front of the flames. Peter opened the bag of marshmallows and handed Tony a stick. 	The pair sat in comfortable silence for a few minutes, roasting the sweet pillowy goods and assembling their first s’more.
Steve smiled joyously. Èamon, a form of Edward. “It suits you,” he echoed the fairy’s earlier words to him. Èamon smirked and Steve just had to know— “Will I ever see you again?”
Tony smiled just as brightly, thankful for the human ray of sunshine standing in the kitchen. “Everything is perfect.”
Don't worry, Steve and Tony still have some talking to do. We'll see Tony's POV in the next chapter and pick up after Steve left.
Tony’s brown eyes studied him for a moment. “What about my body language gave that impression? Did I look uncomfortable?”
Peter exhaled, relieved. Just then, Steve stood before them, and before Tony could do anything, Peter turned to the soldier, furious and blasted him with what Tony knew was the laser web shooter.
Leaving Peter to his own devices for a while, Tony shrugged off the hoodie he’d been wearing and set to work on modifications for his own suit. “Friday, let’s hear some music.” “Coming up, Sir.” Seconds later, the notes to Zeppelin’s ‘Rock and Roll’ blared out. “You know me so well, sweetheart,” Tony praised before losing himself in his work.
Tony glared, as if he could physically see F.R.I.D.A.Y. “Tone down the sass, sweetheart. Leave that to me.” She was right, though. May wouldn’t be too happy if he starved her nephew. Back at the tower, he would only have proper meals if Steve— nope not going there. Back to food for Peter.
Before either them could say anything else, Peter jumped up and looked around, suspiciously. “Mr. Stark, someone’s out there. I can sense it.”
“I’m sorry, Mister Stark. Friday alerted him after you blacked out. She said you instructed her  to do so as part of a protocol in case of an emergency.”
He decided he’d pay Underwoos a visit, but first he needed a plan. Plan. It was almost like a foreign word to the man famous for low impulse control. It’s all part of being a better man and whatnot, he supposes. He doesn’t want Ross to get his claws on the kid, he decides. He doesn’t want him involved in the Accords mess.
The older man sipped from his mug, then looked up with a smirk and replied, “Okay, if you don’t at least try it once, I’’ll buy you those Flint Stone gummy vitamins and personally oversee that you take them. Every 15 year old wants to take those, right? Not a blow to your dignity at all.”
After putting everything away, Peter offered to make their lunch. “I’m not an expert,” he said, “but I learned how to make some easy stuff when Aunt May had to work late.” Huh. F.R.I.D.A.Y was right, then. The kid would end up taking care of him, making sure he ate. “Thanks,” Tony said. “I’m going to check in with Pepper about SI stuff, but I’ll be back in a few. She’ll find a way to kill me through the phone if I don’t call her.”
“I know, Pep. I miss you. Keep those heels sharp and take care.” She laughed. “You too, Tony. And remember to eat! Bye, you maniac.” “Goodbye, Miss Potts.”
“Didn’t want to hurt me, Rogers? God, just listen to yourself. How would you have reacted if you found out that your parents were murdered and that their killer was in the same room as you? Not only that, but you
It was summer, but the water in the mountains was perpetually cool. It pricked his skin, only momentarily, not enough to burn. Just enough to make him feel alive. He reveled in the feeling, body moving with the water. He pressed on the reactor, the nanites only covering his body from the chest up, allowing him to see and breathe underwater. He swam to the bottom and found a rock to wrap his legs around, anchoring him. It was…nice. Like he’d entered another world, where he didn’t have to worry about Steve Rogers, the Accords, or more alien attacks.
“I have to see him,” Steve replied. “He needs to know how sorry I am, that I never meant to hurt him. Maybe it’s selfish on my part, but I don’t know what else to do.”
Before he could say anything, Rhodey beat him to it. “Hi, is this Tony StaNk?” Rhodey howled as Tony rolled his eyes. “Ha. Ha. Very funny, platypus. You’re the sweetest.”
Steve’s breath caught in his throat and he had the overwhelming urge to laugh and cry at the same time. He tried to smother both of them down; however, which resulted in a choked and whispered, “Tony.”
“I- uh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry I hadn’t realized where I was. I didn’t mean to disturb your home. I swear!” He cried, any lore of how to address a fairy flying out of his brain. The being raised an unconvinced eyebrow and stepped into Steve’s space. “The boys from my village, they said I wouldn’t last five minutes in the forest and I know I shouldn’t have listened to them but I couldn’t help it. I had to prove them wrong. All my life, I’ve only been the little guy,” he found himself spilling his life story, frustrated tears streaming down his face. “It’s been “you can’t” time after time. I can’t even breathe properly and I’m just— I’m just
He didn’t blame the kid for shooting him. Hell, he deserved it. It took several of them to subdue him and while they weren’t exactly pleasant, that wasn’t the worse part.  Seeing Tony’s reaction, though? That hit him much worse. But he knew he would do anything so that the genius could look at him without fear or hatred again.
Tony snorted and flew lower, landing on the ground to make himself eye level with the other man. “You’re not really in a position to make requests, Rogers. There’s nothing to talk about. Like Rhodey explained, we’re working on amending the Accords and getting Ross to grant you pardons.”
Tony sighed in relief. Okay, but if you think of anything, you tell me and I’ll fix or add whatever you need.”
Peter looked down for the moment, his hands fiddling with the stick he’d been using to roast his marshmallows.  He smiled, almost shyly. “Do you remember several years ago, when the whole thing with Vanko happened and you were fighting his drones?”
Tony gently nudged him back into the chair. “Hey, hey, it’s okay. You did good, Pete. I’m alright. Thank you for getting me up here. How long was I out?”
T’Challa looked at him curiously, then gave him a knowing smile. “I won’t ask what you are doing because I believe I already know, he said. “But be careful. Know when to back away, Captain. He may not ever be ready to speak to you. Time heals, but his wounds run deep.”
“I wasn’t going to kill him. I was pissed, insane with grief but I wouldn’t have killed him… And you know what the worst part is? If you had told me before everything? About Bucky? Oh, I would have thrown things, yelled, probably locked myself in the lab. But if you had been honest, I would have tried to help him. If you had loved me enough to admit that, especially since it involved your best friend, I would have tried to understand. You knew I was working on the Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing. And I would have helped you find him, too.” Tony’s voice began to shatter around the edges and it was all Steve could do not to break out from the webbing to hold him. “But I guess that’s how little you thought of me, huh?”
When Peter seemed to relax a bit, he finally thought about Steve. “Uh, where is Rogers, but the way? You didn’t kill him, did ya?”
Peter witnessed the interaction in amusement. “Oh man, this is too much! I get my own A- WAIT. Did you say laser web?”
Tony casually slung his arm around the boy’s shoulder as they made their way to the barn. Peter didn’t smile. Nope, not at all.
“Okay,” he said defeatedly. Okay, I’ll go.” He wanted to look at Tony one more time, but the genius had turned away from him and started walking up the stairs. He didn’t turn back once and was soon out of view. Steve sighed, nodded to Rhodey warily and walked out the door, his feet threatening to betray him, but he pressed on, until he was hidden by the trees.
specialty to break people.” Steve knew that was aimed at him— that it was meant to hurt him, but knowing didn’t soften the blow.
Steve’s face fell before his jaw set in the all too familiar stubbornness. “Tony, can we talk, please? Just humor me for a little while.”
The walk back to the jet would have been entirely serene, if it weren’t for the storm of thoughts in his head. Thousands of stars glittered brightly overhead, specks of happiness against the midnight sky, as if mocking his sadness. He could make out the tumbling of a nearby waterfall and it helped soothe him. He let some of pain flow along with the water. He needed a plan, he decided. He hadn’t thought things through before running at Tony and look where that got him.
He was so deep in thought he hadn’t noticed the trees had begun clearing. His lungs were starting to protest and he thought it would be okay if he could just rest for a minute or two. He plopped down unceremoniously under a tree. A Rowan tree. A Rowan tree, in the middle of a clearing. A
Luckily, F.R.I.D.A.Y intervened. “Boss, the fridge and pantry are empty. You forgot to stock up on food.” Tony groaned. He knew he forgot something important, you know, like food. In all fairness, he pretty much existed on coffee. As if reading his thoughts, the AI quipped, “I know you consider coffee food, Sir, but I believe a growing teenage boy requires more adequate nutrition. And you should consider eating actual food as well. Maybe this spider boy will help you with that.”
Yet here he was, all because he couldn’t back down from a challenge. Some of the village teens picked on him because he was smaller and asthmatic. They dared him to spend an hour in the forest, “He won’t make it
Minutes later, Natasha found Clint in the corner of the bar. She walked up to him, holding out her hand. “Pay, up.” Clint shrugged his shoulders before pulling two $20s from his pocket. “About time those two pulled their heads out their asses, anyway.”
She let out a small breath. “Tony, god knows you need a break, more than anyone,” she said gently. “You have every right to get away. I was just worried about you. If I ever see Steve Rogers again, I will kill him.” Tony chuckled. He believed it. “I don’t doubt it, Pep. You could take him,” he said. “But seriously, thank you for worrying. I’m okay, really! I’m breathing the fresh air of the mountains and even brought the Spider kid along. Can you believe it? Me, a mentor?”
“You were foolish to come out here, sunshine.” Sunshine? He noticed Steve’s questioning look. “Your hair… it is like the color of the early morning sun, no?” Steve felt his cheeks warm. “But yes, quite foolish. Other fae might not have been so lenient.”
“I know you do, hot stuff.” Tony smiled at him before closing the distance between them, and leaned his head on the soldier’s chest. They stayed that way, in their own happy world for a few moments.
When they stepped through the front door, Peter audibly gasped in pleasant shock, looking everywhere at once. He fit the “like a kid in a candy shop” description to a T, at that moment, Tony thought. It was endearing.
Tony snapped his eyes open and realized he was kneeling on the ground. Peter’s arms were clasped around him. “ ‘M okay. It’s okay.”
Just as he was contemplating building an underwater lab, he felt a ripple in the water behind him, but before he could turn, strong arms gripped his waist and he was suddenly propelled to the surface.
This is the end! This story didn't turn out exactly like I'd imagine, but I felt that I needed to finish it so here it is. As always, feel free to leave kudos, comments, or prompts!
Once in his room, Tony stepped out into the balcony to enjoy the mountain view. He took out his phone and dialed Pepper. It rang twice before she picked up. “Hey— “ “Tony Stark! A letter? You leave out of nowhere and all I get is a letter?! What is going on with you?” Tony sighed. He wanted to tell her in person but didn’t want her to think he was having some crisis.
Steve inhaled deeply before replying. “I need to use one of your small planes. There’s something I have to do.”
“Sorry, kid. I completely forgot because I don’t want anything delivered here. I want to keep our location undisclosed.” Peter nodded in understanding. “It’s okay, Mister Stark. I’m not that hungry.” As if prompted, the boy’s stomach growled. Tony chuckled. “Come again?” Peter grinned, embarrassed. “There should be a town where we can get supplies about 40 minutes away,” Tony said. “Can you make it until then?”
Sorry if you were expecting a Steve/Tony reunion. I love happy fix-it fics, but I just felt that a lot of those are unrealistic because they both need time to sort themselves out. This was therapeutic for me and thank you to everyone who stayed on this journey with me! :D
“Rhodey yes. Sorry, Tones.” He turned back to glare at the super soldier. “You see, Rogers, this man is so damn selfless that he’s working to get all of you pardoned and allowed back. The others, they didn’t leave Tony to die so I’m not really worried about them, but you— you don’t deserve anything he has to give.”
“Nothing. You usually don’t talk to people for that long at these things and I thought he might have been nagging you. Just wanted to give you a way to escape.”
Tony immediately snapped into action, alert and ready to call his suit at any moment. “Kid, go get your suit!”
The two brunettes proceeded to pick out a variety of bread as well as a large jar of golden honey. Bill had let them try it with a slice of fresh bread and butter. It was absolute heaven on their tongues. It went the same way at every booth they stopped at, which was a great thing, as they wound up spending a couple of hours there, filling up on samples and chatting with the locals.
The broken expression on his former lover’s face reflected the torment in his heart, but he couldn’t give in. He needed to heal. They both needed to heal. And maybe they would never truly mend, but their family of misfits would help patch up the wounds. Now, he also had Peter, the stubborn, overly energetic, impossibly pure and kind-hearted kid from Queens. And that was enough.
Tony laughed bitterly, throwing his head back mockingly. “How could I think that, really? How could—? Let me see, could it be that you knew about my parents and never thought to tell me? You knew all the the time- when we had date nights, when we stayed up talking long into the morning, when you looked me in the eyes and told me you loved me.  But you know, a specific moment comes to mind, hard not to notice someone breaking your heart. I mean, the reactor
Before Steve could protest again, loud clunks came toward them. Both men turned to look at the source.
One night, after a long work-binge, Peter dragged Tony outside to make s’mores because he’d “never had proper ones”. The kid had the best puppy eyes, okay? And the billionaire had never had s’mores either. Howard and Maria weren’t exactly the s’more-making type of parents, and they never seemed to have time for Tony, anyway.
He stopped asking the spiderling to explain after the boy showed him a video of two men in a hot tub “five feet apart ‘cause they’re not gay”, except someone had photoshopped Iron Man and War Machine’s faceplates onto them. He tried to give Peter his best unamused face, but immediately proceeded to send the video to Rhodey. They were trending on Twitter the next day.
home— a place you should understand no circumstance ever disturb. And here was Steve, using its trunk as a seat. Yupp, he was dead. He’d never be seen again and Bucky would write “here lies an idiot punk” on his tombstone.
Sorry I didn't update last week! It was hectic. My little brother graduated from army basic training and I got a tattoo! Fun stuff! Anyway, here is the second chapter. Hope you enjoy it! I'm fueled by your comments and kudos! :)
Tony placed a gauntlet-clad hand on the shoulder of Rhodey’s suit, half steadying himself, half holding the colonel back. His face plate was now up. ”It’s okay, Rhodey. He’s leaving. You know what will happen if they bring him in. We’re so close.”
Steve almost laughed, out of habit. The man reminded him of Tony, with his crass remark. That only angered him more. He was about to tell Dean just exactly what he could do with shield, but stopped at Tony’s icy glare.
Steve grinned and leaned in the rest of the way, pressing a kiss to Tony’s lips, in response. “Oh hell yes.”
The dark-haired man had his eyes closed, a pained expression carved onto his face. He was trying to steady his breathing. Steve couldn’t take it. He strained against the confining webs. They bit into his body, but he pushed as hard as he could until they snapped. Tony’s eyes flew open at that and he immediately jumped back.
“Oh silly sunshine. I suspect you know I will not give you my name.” Steve turned to leave, shoulders sagging in disappointment. He heard an amused chuckle and stopped. “But I suppose you may call me Éamon.”
“Don’t come any closer,” Tony ordered, his voice slightly robotic due to the suit. It startled Steve. He’d been so mesmerized, watching the armor hug the engineer, protecting him- protecting him from— oh. “Tony no, I wasn’t going to hurt you. I just wanted to..” He wanted to touch him, hold him, and never let him go again.
“That is so cool,” Peter exclaimed, eyes shining. “I’ve always wanted to make one.” “I mean, I’ve done some small stuff at school, but nothing like this!” Tony studied his beaming face and thought back to when he was 15. Had he really been that young once? It seemed like a lifetime ago. “By all means, go nuts, kid. It’s what this is all here for.” Peter was about ready to dive in right then. “But not tonight. You need to sleep,” Tony amended.”
Sorry I haven't updated lately... It's been a couple of crazy weeks, but thank you for sticking with me! I'm already working on the next chapter. Our boys will have to meet again at some point, right? As always, please leave comments, kudos! I appreciate you guys so much!
When they stepped back inside the barn, they were armed with an assortment of fruits and vegetables, fresh eggs, cheese, basic spices, bacon and dried meats, the bread and honey, and a large portion of vegetable soup and an entire wild-berry pie a bubbly mother of five had insisted they must accept. Bless Canadians.
The robot in question whirred sadly, but proceeded to poke Peter gently this time. Peter chuckled and patted its head. “That’s U, by the way,” Tony said. “The other one is DUM-E. They’re like my kids. I built them myself.” Tony patted DUM-E fondly and the bot buzzed happily.
Next thing he knew, the boy had launched himself at him, enveloping him in a tight hug. Tony allowed it, and even found himself hugging back. Huh. Maybe he didn’t mind this hugging thing.
“Tony, Tony I thought the world of you- still do! You’re right. God, I realize that now. I was an absolute idiot. I kept telling myself it was never the right time to tell you. And you could have helped all along. Of course, you would have. I hate that I hurt you so much Tony. I can barely live with myself. There hasn’t been one day that I haven’t hated myself, that I haven’t seen the look on your face when I hit you. I love you. I’ve never stopped. I never will. You gotta believe me, Tony. Please. Please let me try to show you.” A sob racked through his body and he felt like his chest was on fire, flames threatening to devour him, but his eyes didn’t waver from Tony’s face.
“Maybe I still love you. I can’t imagine a universe where Tony Stark doesn’t love Steve Rogers. But in this universe, I can’t. I can’t let you in again. Not like that. So no, Steve, I don’t know what “us” looks like anymore. Maybe, one day, we’ll be able to have some sort of friendship, and I promise that as your teammate, I’ll always be there. But right now, I can’t look at you without seeing you over me, hitting me over and over. I can’t bear the thought of you touching me. Because I’ll be back there- in the bunker and it feels like I can’t breathe.”
That night as Steve packed up the small amount of items he had accumulated his short time in Stark Tower, the hairs on the back of his neck stood up like tiny pinpricks; He wasn’t alone.
He remembers the nights when their rations ran low and his mother would scrape whatever was left from their pantry and seemingly make a meal out of thin air. He remembers the hotdog-and-potato plates, and the creamed chip beef, and the thick sliminess unique only to egg drop soup. Sometimes when they craved something sweet, his mother would make fresh soda bread with dried currants and caraway seeds.
Steve Rogers is desperate for love. His entire body thrums with it, in the way he slips his tongue into Tony's mouth and grips one of Tony's hips in a harsh grip, hard enough to bruise. It's fine, though. Steve will kiss every one of his bruises later as penance.
“It’s almost time for you to go,” Natasha said. Her form was beginning to blur at the edges but he didn’t want her to go. He didn’t want to let go.
Steve sinks to his knees, looking at Tony the entire while. His jaw drops like he’s in some cheesy over-acted high school play, but
The castle's game park was ancient, built when Brooke's first king had laid the first stone but well kept. It stretched on for over 800 acres, one of the biggest game parks to be created. Palisade walls separated the park from the greater forest beyond.
Fortunately, Tony’s good at thinking on his toes. “Alright, you caught me, Romanov. I just spent the last half hour rocking Rogers’ world.”
“When it starts interfering with your well-being, then yes,” Rhodey replies. “You haven't answered any of my or Pepper's calls for the past two weeks. I had to talk her out of flying to New York to kick your ass. And, I can smell you through the screen.”
“They’re good pups,” the man beside the box had said, puffing on a cigarette. “They cost a pretty penny though.”
Hill blinks rapidly, but she recovers quickly with a smirk. “Did I just hear an expression of gratitude from the great Tony Stark?”
Tony clears his throat, and Carmen looks up, her big brown eyes going wide before a grin breaks across her face and—
“They would’ve limited our freedoms, Tony,” Steve tries again, and Tony is floored at the man’s tenacity. He shouldn’t be shocked. Tony’s sure that when the serum was applied, it amplified everything about Steve, including his stubbornness.
"Nothing much," Tony says before Natasha can say anything incriminating. His eyes dart down to the last stuffed animal in Steve's arms. It's an Iron Man bear, of course, all done up in the telltale red and gold of Tony's suit. "What's the deal, no one wanted him?" he says, nodding to the bear.
And regardless if this was some hallucination induced by the migraine, a spell, or the afterlife, or
"I wonder," Tony started, his voice going low, sending a strange tingling feeling down Steve's spine. There was a shift in Tony. He was no longer the bored-looking courtesan forced to entertain yet another self-obsessed nobleman. Steve recognized the change from countless excursions into the woods with the court.
By all means, Steve should been at ease. And yet he felt…lost. Like he had been working on a puzzle only to find a piece that didn’t match the rest of the set.
Some days his grief for everything he had lost would creep over him like an immense black storm cloud and engulf him whole until he could barely drag himself from his bed. It was on those days he missed his timeline the most. He missed
This fic is still mostly vibes but I'm excited to see where it goes. Thank you to everyone who very enthusiastically let me know how much you wanted to see more of this fic! Your comments really do help motivate me to keep going.
“Stone has the rather annoying habit of running his mouth.” Steve’s eyes locked onto Tony’s, practically
Tony's so caught up in drooling over a rack of ribs or some trashed wings he barely notices the others walking off to the next booth, Steve lingering behind to wait on him.
Of course, he does. Carmen's like him...in more ways than one. She had been orphaned at nineteen when her parents' plane had gone down over the Atlantic. And at twenty-one, she had also found herself the sole heir to a family fortune and no family to share it with. She got the idea for
Steve remembered in his timeline he had brushed Tony off the first time he had offered he had assumed that he had had some ulterior motive. He knew better now. And the thought of Tony shuffling around that big, lonely tower all by himself like a ghost…it didn’t sit right with him.
Giving him a once over, Steve decided that he looked good. Dissolving into dust aside, the past few years Bucky had spent just living his life in Wakanda had done him some good. Gone was the emaciated look to his face that even Zola's version of the serum couldn't hide. Although diminished in appearance, Steve could still see the bags under his eyes, though. Perhaps they would always be there.
Tony knows what it is. A marker. A claim. He’s Steve’s for as long as Steve will have him. Tony’s willing to indulge him. For now.
She completed the movement with a one-two combination, one of her palms against his chest, the other against his forehead.
"God," Steve gasps into Tony's throat as he pulls out of him. Tony's right there with him, his skin hot to the touch, his legs still shaking from the force of his orgasm.
Steve squeezed his hand just so and the coil of arousal unwound itself. The fire in his belly engulfed his entire being as he came hot and wet all over Steve’s hand and his own stomach. Through the ringing in his ears, Tony heard Steve swearing in the background.
“Not a good idea,” Steve said, panic slamming into him like a tidal wave. Tony wasn’t supposed to go back to Malibu, not when he nearly
“Fine with me,” Rhodey said happily enough, but Tony knew he was probably going to pay for it later.
Warmth bloomed in his chest, and Steve had to school his face from breaking out into a smile. Tony had been
Steve's eyes have always been a weakness of Tony's, and right now, when they're so big and blue and so fucking
A numbness settled deep inside himself like a stone pit had been dropped into the bottom of his stomach. Annihilated. The universe had
It explained a lot about him. Hell, it was one of the things about Steve that made Tony lose his mind and want to kiss him senseless in the same breath.
“You’re a genius, Shellhead,” Steve said softly. “I’m sure that big brain of yours will figure something out.”
Tony had also been helping rebuild in his own way. His joint purchase of the Damage Control organization from SHIELD had finally gone through, making it an official sect of the United States government. Now any and all casualties and destruction caused by both superheroes and super-villains would be cleaned up by government officials with funding from both Tony and the U.S government. It was such a grandiose gesture but what else could he expect from Tony? Had he been his 2012 self, he would have expected Tony to brag about the gesture, but he knew better now. Tony did brag, but only when he felt threatened.
Steve's breath, cool and minty, washes over his face. Tony has to blink a few times, processing what just happened before he can even think about speaking.
“Dogs are easier to take care of than humans,” Clint had replied, cuddling his pup close to him. Tony had just face palmed and waved Clint away.
“Happy will know for sure,” Tony said and with a wave of his hand, the hologram of Mark 42 he had been working on vanished. “He’s been watching Pepper like a hawk.”
He took a sip, relaxing even further as the sweetness of the jasmine melded with the sourness of the lemon and overwhelmed his taste-buds. Maybe she had been onto something when she had made the tea.
. For Natasha, for Bucky, for Tony, for every single person he had let down over the years. But then, like a miracle from God themself, Thanos and his legions had started to crumble, blowing away like dust on the wind. Hope had soared in his chest only to be fucking obliterated as soon as he had realized
Bruce shows up first, drawn to the idea of a bed to sleep in, a constant food source, and a (relative) lack of people shooting at him.
Rhodey let’s out a yelp before swearing and him and Tony are grappling each other. In their struggle, Tony wriggles the wrong way and both of them are tumbling off of Rhodey’s bed and onto the wooden floors of their dorm.
“Some meeting,” Tony starts and immediately wants to slap himself. He should just get to the point. Why even bother with small talk?
“She gets a couple of sweet potatoes and peels them and cuts them into slices. She lets them soak in some water then she throws them in a skillet with butter, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Tones,” Rhodey groans and flops back them, his hands clutching at his stomach. “I’m gonna die if I don’t eat real food in the next twenty-four hours.”
As if summoned, Steve comes bounding back to their table looking boyish and vibrant in the evening sun before Tony can process her words.
“They’re absolute disasters,” Tony had said fondly one day to Steve, when Dodger and DUM-E had bumped into each other while trying to grab a wrench.
He should have known Bucky would pull some kind of stunt. Despite their friendship, there was little love between Bucky and Steve’s father.
Shame overtakes the arousal filling Tony’s body at the whine he lets out when Steve withdraws his fingers. His breath catches in his throat like someone’s wrapped their hands around his neck when the head of Steve’s cock catches on his hole.
, after all) and his hair is product free. Steve feels slightly overdressed in the dark blue button-down Natasha said matched his eyes and black slacks.
Warmth bloomed in Tony’s chest. Steve said nothing as Tony stood behind his chair and bent down to whisper into his ear. “I think you need a break.”
death experience, but he got the all-clear from SHIELD's medics themselves. If he sustains a concussion, that's on them.
“She’s been halting,” Steve had said, refusing to look Tony in the eyes. It was hard to ever since the incident at dinner. He knew the others didn’t fault him, but he couldn’t help but be embarrassed.
Steve looks ready to protest, but Clint cuts him off. "Oh, you're on," he says. "Loser has to do the other's paperwork for two weeks."
“Is that what you think?” Steve says quietly, hurt coloring his voice. “That I don’t respect you? That I don’t know what you can do? Tony, I
He ran a hand through it, hoping to get some of it out of his eyes but looking at his reflection in the glass of the elevator, all he had succeeded in doing was giving himself a cow lick. Huffing, he tried to tame his hair, yet it was futile. His hair seemed to be as stubborn as the rest of him. Steve was so busy fussing with his hair, he hadn’t even realized that he had long since passed his own floor on the tower and wandered straight into Tony’s penthouse at the same time said sleep-deprived genius shuffled into the room. They both froze, staring at each other for what seemed like centuries. The last actual conversation they had shared had been a month ago when Tony had first invited him to live in the tower. Their other interactions since then had been few and far in between; short, stilted conversations with long awkward silences.
“Clint, you’re riding with me on the Ferris wheel,” Natasha declares when everyone makes it back to their table, and Steve has successfully made Tony as red as his suit.
"So what's the plan here, Cap?" Natasha says, leaning forward in her chair. "You've got the most experience with HYDRA out of any of us."
“I just needed to know…” Steve hesitates, rubbing the back of his neck with one hand. “Did I...did I do something wrong?”
"No," Steve said, yawning. "My father doesn't care, and the councilmen follow his lead. Bucky knows where I went and knows to stall if anyone starts asking questions."
"You've got me there," Tony says, going through the motions of measuring out cocoa powder, sugar, and vanilla. He can feel Steve's eyes on him, drinking in his every movement. Not in a hungry way for once, but almost like he's curious. In casual awe of Tony in a kitchen.
“Fuck, I missed you,” Steve groaned, breaking the kiss. Tony savored the look of Steve, his golden hair mussed, lips pink and eyes wild for the next time Steve went away. Sometimes having an eidetic memory was a blessing.
“There’s this French saying,” Tony says, when he pulls away. His eyes shine in the dark of the night. “Mise en place.”
“What’s going on? Fill me in,” he said, picking up the bottle of Pinot Noir. Tony’s eyes read the label quickly; it had notes of blackberry, raspberry and was that—he squinted—that was strawberry. As in the one berry Pepper was severely allergic to. Date night was already off to a
Stepping past a stray Chitauri body, Steve mounted the steps of the building ready to knock when the door opened on its own.
"Cease your fire," Thor says, wrapping an arm around Tony's waist. "We're joining the fray." And they're off. Thor's flying is different from Tony's own; Mjolnir functions as a weight, taking them into the mountain top's direction. It's completely flat on top, akin to a plateau. Every twenty feet is a gunman armed with what looks like a modified Chitauri gun. They're firing blindly, still looking out for the quinjet. "We're coming in," Tony says. "And Hawkeye, you're right. This does look like Chitauri weaponry."
"Carmen, cool it before you pop a blood vessel," he says, mentally filing away the idea to add a pole leading directly to the tower's hangar. "And I promise you can grill them when you see them at the carnival."
,” Steve’s foot pressed down cruelly on Tony’s cock and just like that, Tony was coming in his uniform.
"Then you need better friends," Tony said, finally meeting Steve's eyes. His breath caught in his chest. He had thought Tony's eyes beautiful, but the sun rays beaming through the foliage made them radiant.
, from a HYDRA goon sat on his workshop table. It operated like no weapon Tony had ever seen. Aside from his own repulsors. The energetic outputs were damn near equal.
“He invited the rest of us. His treat,” she said. “He said and I quote, ‘make sure the Capsicle knows that includes him, too.’”
Tony moaned at that, his eyes fluttering shut as he focused on bobbing his head along the cock stuffing his mouth. The vibrations traveled along the length of Steve’s cock who cursed and bucked his hips upward, shoving even more of him down Tony's throat. Tony reveled in the the cloying scent of sweat and musk that assaulted his senses.
"Besides," Steve says, leaning in close to him. "I'm gonna clean the booths out. I'm trying to beat the super spies. Can you keep him safe for me?"
With each word, Steve’s head throbbed. He felt as if he had been trampled underfoot by his horse. He was just about to dismiss Peter when something the boy said caught his attention.
and men who shrunk down to microscopic size. It sounded like something out of those comic books that used to stand outside newsstands that he and Buck used to spend their Sunday School money on. They had all had wacky titles like
Once again, the thought of calling Ross crosses his mind. Ross wants all of the Ex-Avengers of course, but if Tony gives him Steve, without a doubt the general would be jumping for joy.
a herd of deer nearby, along with an abundance of rabbits. Steve could see the visible change in the party, their excitement practically tangible. Nothing made noblemen happier than the thought of killing something.
Tony arches a fine, dark brow, “You? Punctual? The man who slept in the ocean for nearly seventy years?”
"I've seen your work," Tony says, latching onto the topic for what it was—a way out. "You were good."
If possible, his frown deepened. He threw back his covers and stalked behind the partition dividing his wardrobe from the rest of the chambers. Peter had laid out a simple linen tunic dyed green and brown trousers. His hunting boots stood by his wardrobe, cleaned of mud and polished to perfection.
Tony deepened his voice. “I am Iron Patriot,” he growled. “Surrender or suffer the wrath of I, the defender of truth, justice and the American way—”
“No, no it’s fine,” Chris said and set down her scissors. “There was a stray mine. We drove over it and I remembered being surrounded by fire. Fire and dust and smoke.”
Natasha must have been trailing him to learn his schedule because Steve corners him right as he’s leaving his workshop to head up to Bruce’s floor. His fellow scientist was making curry, and Tony didn’t want to miss out before the other Avengers (vultures) devoured it.
“I’m not so sure about that,” Bruce says, stifling a yawn. “Odin exiled Thor to earth when he disappointed him.”
… but I like it here. I like working with Bruce and the movie nights and the team dinners and…I like you. Once you get past all the hard assery and the spangles…you’re not that bad to be around, Winghead.”
Tony can’t look away. It’s like there’s some electric current going from him to Steve, and the second they break eye contact, it’ll cease to exist.
Tony shrugs and takes a sip of his own coffee. He had always had issues with sleep. He woke up frequently throughout the night and would only start feeling sleepy around two in the morning to the point where attempting to sleep at all felt like a waste of time. Give him a cup of coffee with four shots of espresso, and he'd be good to go.
A short, middle-aged woman answered his knock almost immediately, leading him over to a makeshift circulation desk with a kind smile. The brownstone was a two story building that been built in the earlier 20th century and remodeled about two years ago for a more contemporary look. The building was outfitted with large bay windows allowing for golden shafts of sunlight to illuminate the house and bounce off the freshly polished cherry wood floors. After signing in, he was told to take the stairs and the first room on the left was where his session would take place. Only three other people had attended the session. They all sat on the opposite side of the room, facing the doorway so Steve’s form was immediately under their scrutiny as he walked through the door.
Steve’s eyes narrow like he knows exactly where Tony’s brain went, and isn’t that a terrifying thought that Steve can already read him so well. Steve doesn’t call him out. Instead, he kisses Tony.
Steve, bastard that he is, withdraws his fingers from Tony's entrance, and if Tony whines, that's between him and God.
Biting his lip, Tony crossed his arms in front of himself like he was trying to hold himself together. “Fine. It’s…it’s Pepper. She and I got into a fight.”
"I'd do it again," Steve says firmly. "I know we didn't speak for those two years, but I needed to talk to you. In person." Steve's arms fall at his sides, and Tony wraps his arms around Steve's neck. He knows he's giving Steve all kinds of mixed signals. Pressing up against him one moment and pushing him away the next, but Tony would have to be a heartless bastard to push him away right now.
“And you’re acting like a man child,” Tony sneers. “And that’s coming from me, the resident authority on immaturity.”
Tony loved music. He loved turning the volume all the way up until the floors were practically vibrating and the floor to ceiling windows of his workshop were quaking. Each note would sink its way into his skin, setting his blood alight and filling his head with noise until he could barely hear himself think. On days where his mind went into overdrive, drowning his thoughts out with music was a blessing. It was no secret that he loved classic rock the most; it was loud and intense and it had pissed Howard off which made it good in Tony’s book. Howard had called it delinquent music so obviously that meant Tony had to play it, full blast, at all times.
Rhodey curses, anger and frustration evident in his face. He thankfully softens when he looks at Tony, eyes roving over him for injuries like Tony might be hiding them, which given their history, was a smart move on Rhodey's part.
Steve withdrew his fingers and Tony almost whined. Naked as he was, heat still surged through him like he was caught in the midst of a wildfire. Tears of relief pricked the corners of his eyes when he heard the squelch of lube. He could practically envision Steve’s cock, long and thick, his cockhead weeping. He wanted to take Steve into his mouth, lap at the pre-come dribbling from his tip.
They were eating dinner at a little hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant. Tony was friendly with the owners and the paparazzi never thought to look for them on that side of town, so it was one of their favourite date-night destinations.
Steve didn’t want to look away from the source of the threat. Another round of fire forced him to duck behind the tray and the force of each hit shuddered up his arm. He was grateful that the bullets only dented the metal, rather than piercing through.
Steve was hitting the ground before he fully registered the echo of a gun-shot. “Everyone get down!”
He didn’t bother to glance up. He knew what he would see on Sam’s face. A mixture of concern and sympathy. It was the same expression that each of the Avengers had worn when they came to visit. Nick and Agent Hill, too, when they stopped by to tell him that the shooters had been apprehended. Small comfort that had been.
“Tony, wake up, dammit, you can’t-” He choked, not even sure what he was trying to say or if Tony could even hear him. Desperate, he pressed down harder.
He tried to remember everything that Natasha had taught him about knife-throwing. Trajectory, distance, spin, force. Harder when he didn’t have eyes on the target.
Tony’s skin was ashen and agony was written into every line of his face, but he smiled up at Steve and squeezed his hand again.
Steve caught one of his hands in his own, even as he flattened his other palm more firmly over Tony’s injury.
This shouldn’t be happening. They weren’t on a mission. There were no aliens invading New York or supervillains trying to take over the world. It was date night and they were at their favourite restaurant. They had a table perpetually reserved for Tuesday evenings and wrangled their schedules as best they could so they would make it there more often than not. It had become something of a tradition- a routine.
Steve’s voice broke over the word and tears blurred his vision. He blinked them back and tried again. “Tony, is it alright if I hug you?”
Tony nodded jerkily. “I…believe you? I mean, there’s a whole host of reasons why you shouldn’t. I don’t even really understand why you wanted to date me in the first place. You’re you, and I’m me, and I’ve got to be the furthest possible thing from a good match for you, but you still- so I figured it couldn’t hurt, or, well, that if you changed your mind it wouldn’t hurt you too much and that’s what was important, but I never expected- I didn’t think you would ever- it doesn’t make sense.”
The important thing was that he had managed to keep those words to himself, even when Tony ended the date by pressing a quick kiss to his lips and giving him a smile that could have lit up Manhattan. Steve had stumbled out of the elevator in somewhat of a daze, but he hadn't said the words and he counted that as a win.
Steve didn’t hesitate, crossing the length of the couch and gathering Tony into his arms. The man was shuddering like he had just come in from a blizzard, and Steve willed his own warmth to soak into his skin. He cupped the back of Tony’s neck and drew his face into his shoulder, not caring that tears began to soak into his shirt. “Hey, shh, it’s alright,” he murmured, pressing a kiss into Tony’s curls. “I’ve got you. I’m not going anywhere.”
Since Steve had told Tony about the secret code, not a day had gone by without Tony using it in a myriad of different ways. Even when they got into arguments or shouting matches, Tony’s hand tapped out a fierce rhythm of threes on whatever surface was within reach.
Even as he scooped a knife from the table and tried to calculate which direction the fire was coming from, he hoped that no one else had been hit. Normal people didn’t have the advantages of his super-serum healing abilities.
“Serum,” Steve said. He continued to stroke the knuckles of Tony’s hand, careful to avoid disturbing the I.V. He wondered at how small Tony’s hands were compared to his. Strong, though. Calloused and scarred from all the work he did, yet still elegant. Beautiful. Steve wanted to capture their beauty in his sketchbook, but he wasn’t about to let go. Not for a second.
