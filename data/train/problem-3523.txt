Cas stares at him, feeling more betrayed than he probably has the right to feel, and he can tell Dean’s working hard not to laugh. Cas narrows his eyes and crosses his arms over his chest. “Answer a question instead, then,” he says, sounding like a petulant elementary schooler.
Castiel has pioneered Anna's car's CD player, replacing her classical soundtracks with his Ben Gibbard mix. The singer's soft voice has been a go-to ever since his music helped Castiel through his very first anxiety attack in college, and he couldn't think of a more appropriate time to utilize it as the car inches closer and closer to Dean Winchester's house.
Cas maintains eye contact for a few seconds, then sighs and slings his jacket over his shoulder, knowing full well that by the end of the night, he’ll have agreed to this stupid goddamn date.
There’s his jaw line, for one thing. A good jaw line doesn’t do much for some people, but it’s high on the list of priorities for Castiel, and Dean’s is damn near flawless.
He pulls open the heavy Victorian door and steps into the building. The security guard, a lanky grad student from MIT named Ash (who, if Cas is being honest, really has no business being a security guard), nods at him while drumming his palms to the beat of the music. Cas nods back before tapping his ID against the scanner on Ash’s desk and heading down to the basement.
The entire wall is black, a deep underwater scene dotted with the creepiest sons of bitches Dean’s ever seen: dragonfish and goblin sharks and gulper eels and at least three different types of squid. Cas looks awestruck, just staring at everything in front of him as if he’s looking at the actual ocean itself.
is written on the cover in bright fuchsia type, with, “Has fan favorite Dean Winchester finally found someone to accept his rose? We’ve got the scoop!” typed out underneath.
Cas drops his own hands to Dean’s hips and pulls him close, closing what little space is left between them as he feels Dean’s hand fist in his hair. There’s a spark of electricity wherever Dean goes, a low heat building in Cas’ gut at every touch. He catches Dean’s bottom lip with his teeth and smiles when he hears Dean let out a surprised little yelp.
Cas waits for a few more seconds before glancing up at Dean, who’s still watching the TV. “On the show, you had said—”
The five of them barrel up onto the stage and begin setting up. For Dean, that doesn’t involve much more than trying to get his bearings in front of a roomful of people. Singing in front of Charlie and Billie’s can in a tiny, one-room studio is one thing, but the dozens of folks packed in here tonight is practically enough to have Dean running for the hills.
“I think Anna’s right,” Cas says, giving Dean another kiss before sliding the gift into Dean’s hands.
“Could’ve fooled me.” Dean slides out of his chair and runs a hand through his hair. “Normally I’d walk my date back to their car,” he says slowly, “but I’m guessin’ that’ll get a big fat ‘no’ from you, huh?”
“I know it’s stupid,” Dean says before Cas can respond. “But...I dunno. Having to go to my shop and tell ‘em to cancel my pull list, not because I’m moving away or can’t afford it anymore, but because I went fucking blind.” Another humorless laugh, and Cas’ heart starts to pull down deeper into his chest.
Sam’s face softens, and he rests a hand on Dean’s arm. “Not everyone is out to hurt us,” he says. “Not everyone is out to hurt
Cas’ phone chimes when he gets back to his dorm, and he sees an alert that he’d been tagged in a photo. He taps the notification and, sure enough, there’s the group shot from a few hours earlier. Cas grins down at it in spite of himself: his teammates might be a little crazy and overzealous, but they take care of their own, and that’s all Cas can ask for.
Dean edges closer to Cas, closing up what little space had been remaining between them, and kisses Cas’ temple. “You love it.”
“Oh, fuck off,” Dean mutters, kicking lightly at Sam’s head again. Sam grabs at Dean’s ankle, trying to catch him off-guard and pull him off the couch, but Dean notices quickly and pulls his foot away. HIs baby brother might be strong, but there’s no way Dean’s giving him a chance to prove it.
Dean rolls his eyes. "And counting. It's only Thursday, dude. He's still got three more days." He glances at Cas' door, where his and Gabe's cheesy, RA-made name tags are still stuck to the door. It's October, so his and Gabe's names are scrawled inside a hastily-colored jack-o-lantern in an effort to be festive.
“Good.” And with that Gabe, ducks out of their room and jogs down the hallway; a few seconds later, Cas can hear him banging on Balthazar’s door. “Up and at ‘em, Balthy, come on!”
Dean wastes no time, peppering Cas with questions the moment they walk in the door. “Do any more Instagram creepin’ last night?” His eyes are bright even in the dimness of the restaurant, and Cas can tell that he’s clearly enjoying the way Cas’ cheeks burn with embarrassment.
Dean stares at him. “Ugh, come on,” he finally says before rolling onto his stomach and covering his head with a pillow. “Don’t joke about shit like that.”
If it means Dean will keep talking to him, then yes, Cas is pretty sure he wants to hear all about his problems, but he decides to keep that thought to himself. Instead, he settles for an awkward but earnest, “You listened to mine that first night. I’m happy to return the favor.”
“I know,” Dean interrupts. “But who the hell am I to tell someone I’m not allowed to be able to make them feel better? If she took comfort in something I did or said, who am I to tell her she’s wrong?”
Someone wraps their fingers around his elbow and is hauling him to his feet. Gabriel. When he’s not losing a massive amount of blood, he’s going to chew his older brother out like there’s no tomorrow. He keeps his head down as Gabriel leads him out into the club’s lobby, his blood leaving a drip-drop trail as they walk. A door is shoved open and Cas looks up just enough to see that they’re in the--thankfully empty--bathroom. He wrenches himself out of his brother’s grip and stumbles toward the block of sinks against the wall.
Dean sucks in a long, deep breath through his nose. “The cops never found who did it,” he says, “because they stopped looking. It was like the case had a goddamn expiration date, and once they hit it, they just gave us an apology and a lollipop and sent us on our merry fucking way.”
Dean knows what he’s getting at, knows what he’s gonna say, but so far, he’s refused to let that even be a possibility in his own head. Every passing second that Sam’s quiet has Dean dreading his answer even more. “What if he had just had enough? We did lie to him, strung him along on this stupid adventure. And the last time he tried to leave, you near knocked him out.”
“Okay, okay,” Dean interrupts, holding up his hands. “I get the idea, Emeril. So, what, you gonna shit on my eating habits, replace all my meat with fish?”
be curious about someone who’s all but refused to talk since the moment he got here?), and while that may be true, he also knows that curiosity sure ain’t synonymous with disinterest.
“What?” he asks without looking up. “What gave away the fact that you two numbskulls were rolling in money you had no idea what to do with? Other than the shabby clothes and mannerisms of Neanderthals, all packaged up in a cafe that looks like it wouldn’t even hire you as dishwashers?”
Cas gapes at her silently, unsure of how to respond, then unwraps his own burrito with a huff. “That’s not the current crisis.”
"A few more yards, yes." He looks at Dean, who nods. "You did really well today, Dean. The hill was a little rough--"
A few moments later, the four of them are gathered around a barrel out back, flames licking up its sides as they devour the last remaining memories of their time at Joliet and the hiccups they’d experienced in their first few days as free (it’s not inaccurate, Dean reasons, even if the law doesn’t necessarily see it that way) men.
Dean pauses, his lips quirked halfway between a confused expression and a smirk, and he finally starts laughing. “Why aren’t you writing brochures for the city, Cas?” He holds up both hands, fingers splayed. “Come to Boston, where our rivers
Cas furrows his brows, and tries to ignore the stab of disappointment that's currently making itself at home in his chest. "Oh. Is he sick?" Sam pauses before opening his mouth to respond, but Cas picks up on his hesitation almost immediately. His heart starts hammering in his chest and he feels his stomach drop down deep, his mind immediately going into overdrive—
“Happy to help. And, hey, an art project in history? Shit, if you were my teacher I might’ve actually tried in class.” It’s supposed to be a joke, but Cas doesn’t laugh and Dean wants to crawl under his desk, ideally to spontaneously combust. Instead, he clears his throat and turns on his heel toward the supply closet.
“In an effort to make amends for my shitty elbows, can I show you around? Help you learn the ropes of this hellhole?”
“Don’t call me ‘sweetie,’ tough guy.” Balthazar snorts into his drink as he tries not to laugh when Gabe seems to physically deflate at the retort.
“And how’d you two get saddled with this wild card?” Gabriel asks, taking a long drink of room-temperature water as he gestures between Sam and Dean with his fork.
They’d wasted no time after touching down in Florida, scouting out an Uber before making a beeline for the nearest—and biggest—liquor store in Fort Lauderdale, with Cas’ (perfectly reasonable, thank you very much) request of breakfast having gone ignored.
Dean looks up and grins, flashing her a thumbs up as he gets unsteadily to his feet. Her attention quickly shifts back to Kevin and Gordon, who are neck-and-neck, throwing tattered remnants of shirts and pants aside as they dig furiously for the ring.
As they approach the end of the street, Castiel starts to veer to the right, leading them onto the next street in their route. As he turns, though, he suddenly finds himself in front of Dean, who stumbles over him and almost falls. Castiel’s stomach drops when he realizes that he hadn’t told Dean that a turn was coming up, and that’s why they were thrown off.
The guy takes a few seconds to mentally locate Cas’ room in his head, then leads the group--Cas right in the middle of them--into Miranda Hall. Cas casts one last glance to his car, which now, with almost all its doors thrown open, as well as the trunk, looks like it’s been picked apart by vultures, before letting himself be guided inside.
He digs through the rest of Dean’s wallet and grabs his cards and cash; Cas startles when he feels the other man do the same to him. Once his wallet is empty, the man tosses it aside and Cas can see him nod to the man holding Dean.
“Damn, we’re in a tight spot,” Sam mutters. He sits back on his heels, runs his hands through his hair. “Uh, come on, come on, let’s—”
Out of nowhere, the ground at their feet explodes in a smattering of gunfire. “Son of a bitch!” Dean yells, his hands flying overhead. He squints into the harsh sunlight to see Novak looking straight ahead at a man aiming a shotgun at the three of them.
“Yeah.” Dean crooks two fingers into Cas’ belt loop and tugs him to face him, then starts punctuating each comparison with a kiss. “You’re smart. You see the good in people. Your jawline is sharp as fuck. You—”
“It’s one of the only scripted shows I’ve ever enjoyed,” Cas answers simply, and Dean raises his eyebrows, impressed.
It might also have had something to do with the boy’s soft flannel shirt brushing up against his bare arm and hands as he applied the makeshift ice pack, but nobody needs to know that.
“Is this for me? Thank you, sweetie!” She takes the rose and hugs him long and hard. “Oh, I missed you so much.” Ben hugs her back, but keeps a suspicious eye on the camera hovering just over her shoulder.
“Shit,” Cas breathes, chewing on his lower lip as he clicks through to one of the pages. He’s momentarily overwhelmed by all of the information, but grabs a notebook and pen and starts scribbling down the most important aspects each website has to offer, breaking them down into three groups: food, running and stretching, and prep for the actual day of the marathon. He also digs through his bag and unearths another folder Anna had given him, this one stuffed full of information about how to be a sighted guide paired with a blind runner. Sure, he and Dean can manage a few miles on a mostly-empty street, but Cas figures that will change dramatically once they’re crammed in with tens of thousands of other runners.
“All that hard work,” he says, tilting his chin up toward the inky dark sky, where the smoke’s curling up toward the stars in thin tendrils. “Up in smoke.”
Dean’s got no way of explaining why, but at that, his eyes find their way back over to Novak, and he decides, like most things, that it’s better if he just ignores it.
He takes a step back to let Sam and Cas crowd in and echo the last line before stepping forward again to continue, feeling more and more like he owns the place.
“‘That reality bullshit’ is what got us together in the first place,” Cas reminds him, shrugging out of his jacket and tossing his keys onto the kitchen counter.
His feet leave the ground, but they’re not high enough. He trips himself up on the bench and stumbles hard, nearly smacking his face onto the bench and dragging Anna down with him in the process.
Dean’s heart leaps up into his throat, cheeks going pink when it seems like Cas isn’t all that opposed to the idea, but before he can respond, Sam and Jessica are ambling back over, flushed and pleased as punch.
Cas smiles, and Dean’s gotta work fast to stop the heart eyes that are liable to start forming when he watches Cas wipe away beer foam from his upper lip with the back of his hand. “Or whatever.”
He can taste himself as Dean works his tongue into his mouth, slow and deliberate and delicate. Cas tugs his wrists again, whimpers into Dean’s mouth, and suddenly the tie is shoved up over his forehead. His eyes adjust quickly to see Dean, centimeters from his face. His eyes are cast down toward Cas’ lips, and when he glances up at him, Cas feels like he’s been punched in the face.
He rests his palm against Cas’ chest, warm and firm against his skin, and looks up at him through long eyelashes in a silent request of permission. Cas nods and focuses on Dean’s tiny little smile before it’s covered by Dean fastening the tie over his eyes. He digs his fingernails into his palms, soaking up the way Dean’s lips feel against his skin as he kisses his sternum, his collarbone, his neck.
“Can I look at it?” Cas asks. The question is more of a formality than anything; the sketchbook is open, and Cas is already looking at it.
Dean parts his lips instinctively, and Cas’ quirk up in that once infuriating, now endearing little smirk. He leans down, slowly, slowly, so goddamn slowly, and Dean struggles to raise his head up to close the gap. Cas’ tongue pokes out to wet his lips and Dean closes his eyes, waiting for the press of Cas’ lips against his own—
!” Dean yells. He sets his beer bottle down on the coffee table before resting his forearms on his knees, pinching the bridge of his nose with one hand. Castiel studies the way Dean’s shoulder blades go tense, the muscles strong and taut underneath his shirt.
Cas lets his eyes wander over each member of the team, and for the first time in a while, he doesn’t feel scared. Sure, he’s met with some blank or bored-looking faces, but nobody avoids eye contact or glares. He’d gotten so used to that at Samwell that it’s almost unsettling without it, but he shakes his head quickly to clear the thoughts from his head before addressing his new teammates.
if anyone finds out that I’m trying to lessen your suffering, especially when I should be doing the opposite. So I recommend that you keep your backtalk to yourself from now on, understood?”
There’s a hard left turn coming up, and Cas does a quick calculation of how many steps they have until they hit it. “Left turn!” he shouts over the screams and music and cheering. “Six, five, four…”
“Dean, sweetie,” she calls from behind him, “your partner’s just arrived, so do try and look a little more like you may be about to meet the love of your life, and just a smidge less like you’re on Death Row, hmm?”
“More than you,” Cas answers. Dean tries to pull away from him, and Cas quickly brings his free hand to the back of Dean’s head to steady him. “Don’t move,” he says. “I’m trying to help you.”
They ride on in silence for a few moments after that until the woman continues. “Quite an adventure you three are heading off on, I’ll give you that. But that treasure you’re looking for? That great fortune? One of you’s already found it. Just might be a
“I meant for work. Business as usual. Another day, another dollar, right?” He winks, clicking his tongue against his teeth in the way he knows Sam can’t stand.
“But it also led to me getting laid more times in two weeks than I had in my entire life,” he adds with a grin. “Win some, lose some.”
—when the bell rings, startling him out of whatever the fuck this thing is supposed to be. He drops his feet down to the floor and flips his sketchbook facedown, standing up as his kids gather their things.
Dean, as it turns out, is a big fan of pastries, and pies in particular. He treats the decision over which flavor to order like it’s life or death, ultimately ordering a slice of apple for dessert and cherry to bring home with him for tomorrow.
Cas takes a few deep breaths, trying to tamp down his anxiety as he and Dean make their way through the throngs of runners. Loud, upbeat music is pumped through speakers, oftentimes fading out and replaced with tips, prep suggestions, and weather updates.
Cas had been ready for the exhaustion, the sore muscles and screaming tendons and stitches in his side, but the one thing that Cas really isn’t prepared for, though, is the cheering. Tens of thousands of people have lined all 26.2 miles of the course, camped out hours in advance to get a good spot, and are cheering him and Dean on. They don’t know them, will probably never see them again, but they still want to see them finish and achieve what they set out to do, and Cas suddenly reverses his opinion that running is a solitary activity.
Dean raises a hand—to cheer or get them off the fucking stage as cops begin to infiltrate the crowd and swarm Crowley, he's not sure—but it’s only up for a second before he feels someone tug it down and behind his back.
“Son of a bitch,” he breathes. “Shit, did I get—” He gestures helplessly to the wine stain on his shirt, and Cas can’t shake his head fast enough.
would this be about my family?” He’s not yelling, but his voice is harsh, and Cas feels like he’s just shrunk to the size of a hobbit.
. Castiel is immediately slammed with a piercing, sour odor that smells like a mix of overcooked peppers and a full diaper that’s been left out in the sun for too long; he covers his mouth, pretending to yawn, and a girl sitting a few feet away catches his eye and gives him a sympathetic smile.
“Aw, you crying, Dean?” Sam asks, smirking. Cas is sure that he doesn’t know what the book says--they’ll have to explain it to him later--but he smiles anyway.
, listens to Gabe prattle on for another minute before finally snatching up some menus, muttering something about not being paid enough for this, and leading them over to a corner table.
He does a lot of shit, so much that he doesn't notice that he has a missed call until later that night.
And they turn. No swearing, no stumbling, no falls. Cas wants to stop and hug Dean, have a quick moment to celebrate the fact that Dean’s knees and palms aren’t scraped up, that they’re both still on their feet.
“Aiden!” his mom says, her breathing heavy. “What have I told you about interrupting people?" She turns to Dean and Cas, smiling apologetically. “I’m so sorry,” she says, “Aiden here is still learning his manners.”
Dean worries his bottom lip between his teeth and refuses to blink, his arms so taut they almost start shaking. He’s halfway convinced himself he’d have better luck throwing the whole thing away and snaring a rabbit on his way back to camp when he feels it.
Still unsure if Dean is awake, Cas takes a step closer and notices earbuds resting in Dean’s ears. Jack is lying on the floor, and Dean’s fingers are absently scratching at the dog’s black fur.
Dean wrinkles his nose, and warmth floods Cas’ chest again at the sight of Dean looking so adorable. “No,” he says hesitantly, and Cas nods to himself before turning and rummaging through the pile of groceries on the counter.
A few names are familiar--Ali Wong, John Mulaney, Tig Notaro--but Cas finds himself doing a double-take at Hannibal Buress. Hannibal. Like the cannibal.
He listens to himself, trying hard to ignore the way his inner voice is turning into one that sounds more like his old man than he’s comfortable with, but there’s no stopping it now.
“I brought a bunch of different kinds of healthy foods, food that’ll help give you energy and make it easier to run. I figured we could go through them and figure out what you like and don’t like, and go from there. Maybe put together some meals for the week.”
Cas’ blood goes cold at that, and he stiffens. He has a hard enough time describing himself to people during a job interview; there’s no way he’s going to be able to describe himself well enough to make Dean find him attractive. “I...me?”
to Cas, that is, and Dean’ll be damned if that happens anytime soon. Instead, he’s stuck grappling with the fact that despite it all, he
“Hope you’re posting that shit on Facebook, too,” Dean calls after him as he heads back up to his room to get changed. “I’ll be the first one to like it.”
His stomach clenches with anxiety as he throws his blankets off and swings his legs over the side of his bed. His toes dig into the carpet as he drops his head in his hands. Keeping his head down, he reaches blindly for his phone, palming around on the nightstand until his fingers wrap around it. Maybe the guy’s on Facebook. Dean unlocks his phone and is about to thumb over to the Facebook app when he stops himself. If Cas
“Folks have left before,” Cas says quietly. And Dean’s had his share of one-night stands, but something about the way Cas is talking makes him realize that this is something different. He’s got questions, and lots of ‘em, but when they enter into their third straight minute of silence, Dean decides to finish the story for Cas for now.
find out. They will, because they fucking found him. The Kansas penal system works fast, faster than Dean remembered, but it doesn’t matter, because come tonight, come hell or high water, Sam and Dean Winchester are getting Castiel Novak out.
“Did you follow him back?” Billie asks, ignoring his lackluster response to her question. “Tell me you fucking followed him back.”
The flames are licking up the sides of the car, the whole place getting hotter with every passing second. Dean cringes when he hears the tell-tale crack of another beam going loose high above them; if even one of them gets pinned here, they’re all fucked.
Dean is standing in the doorway, a cup in each hand and a bunch of blankets tucked under his arm, and suddenly Cas feels super self-conscious and exposed in his pajama pants and old T-shirt.
His heart sinks when Dean still hasn’t made a move toward any of the staircases, instead staying standing in front of the bank of elevators.
Suddenly, Dean snaps his head up and glares at Cas. “Why the fuck are you staring at me?” he demands. “Don’t think I can’t tell, Cas. It’s goddamn creepy.”
“Don’t be so sure,” he says, finally spearing a piece of the greens and popping it into his mouth. He drops the fork into the bowl and leans back against the counter, arms folded across his chest. He chews thoughtfully for a moment, then gives his verdict. “This shit’s not bad.”
Dean shrugs. “Not really, I guess. It’s hereditary. Started out slow. I had issues walking and driving at night, got in a couple accidents that Sammy was convinced happened because I was drunk.” He lets out a short laugh at that. “I wasn’t, by the way. He just figured I was being an asshole and lying to him, but then I started not being able to deal with glare from the sun, and you know those stupid Transitions glasses? The kind where the lenses change from sunglasses to regular glasses when you go inside?”
Cas cries out in pain as his body collapses to the floor, not really sure what just happened, or what he should do next. His whole face is tingling, his nose is on fire, and he starts to feel faint at the sight of blood dripping steadily onto his shirt and jeans.
“We’ll regroup tomorrow,” Sam says, one arm tucked behind his head as he gazes up at the stars. “All right?”
The little heart icon under the photo remains empty, and Cas lets his mouse hover over it. It’s an old photo, Dean would know he’d been doing some digging if he liked it, but a nagging voice at the back of his mind makes him want to click it, to show Dean that he’s there. Or something.
Cas opens his mouth and is about to start his sentence with “Dean,” but catches himself at the last second. “The Colt is my best friend,” he says slowly, “and he doesn’t know that I know. I can’t expose him to the media like that, just leave him vulnerable without any warning.”
They should’ve left. The second they scooped the money, they should’ve turned tail and gotten the hell outta dodge. But being in town, having even the slightest semblance of normalcy at their fingertips, had felt too good. They could spare a few hours for a drink or two and to regroup. It only made sense, to stop and get their strength up before figuring out how best to tackle the three hours left to get to Lawrence.
Dean watches the crinkles appear around Cas’ eyes as he smiles, and tries to ignore the way his cheeks go hot when he feels Cas reach down and entwine their fingers together. “Yes,” he says. “Let’s.”
Dean scoffs. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Sammy,” he mutters, shutting off his phone and shoving it into his jacket pocket. For a second, he wonders if he’s got the wrong place; he glances up across the street at the bakery. It’s a small building made with mismatched brick that looks like it’s been around since the 1900s, with oversized windows that are adorned with different pastry displays and specials written on the glass. There's a warm yellow light emanating from the inside that makes Dean want to come inside and out of the dark, chilly interior of the Impala. The light pink oval sign hanging above the door reads BUMBLEBEE BAKERY in looping, pale yellow lettering, and there’s a fat bumblebee buzzing around the name.
The sun is bright and hits him immediately when he exits his building, and he feels around the top of his head for his sunglasses before dragging them down in front of his eyes and starting on his afternoon run.
, you idiot. Frankly,” he says, turning back to Cas, “I’m surprised you haven’t added this achievement to your resume yet.”
he had, though, it’s still not a total lost cause; Cas could show it to him after taking him out to a nice dinner. After they get back to his apartment and engage in a makeout session that eventually turns into Dean sucking Cas off with that incredible mouth of his.
Dean places two folded twenties onto the receipt and pins them all together with his empty beer bottle. He pockets his wallet and grins humorlessly at Cas. “You get the next one.”
The fourth limo pulls up in front of the mansion, and the second the men inside get a glimpse of Lisa, they dissolve into whistles and cheers.
Castiel worries his bottom lip with his teeth, considering Dean’s request. He already finds it difficult
Castiel nods, and the man beams, looking like he’s restraining himself from pulling Castiel into a hug right there on the porch. “I’m guessing I have the right house, then?”
"I like it." Cas loves it, all its sweeping sentences and page-long paragraphs and its ability to get him to inadvertently skip meals so he doesn't have to worry about eating alone and the fact that it makes being sexiled easier to bear, but he decides to keep all these parts out.
Castiel sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose between two fingers and trying to well up the last remaining fragments of resistance he knows are hidden somewhere in his mind. “Fine,” he finally says.
, his mind supplies helpfully, just as Cas approaches. He’s got a hunger in his eyes, a devilish little smile playing at his lips that’s got Dean feeling some kind of way, heat building low in his belly. He reaches up to grab Cas, draw him closer, but before he can, Cas grabs his wrists and pins them down on either side of his head. He puts all his weight there, and Dean’s hips spark with want when he feels Cas settle his weight over them, bracketing them with his legs.
Cas works slowly with deft fingers, stroking Dean up and down while kissing his throat, pleased at the way he can feel Dean’s breath hitching with every motion.
“Wait, you’re the one who hit me?” Cas asks, the boy’s earlier confession finally taking root in his brain.
And Dean glances down at the man in his arms, the man who’s looking out at the sunset on the lake, their lake, waiting patiently for Dean to begin. The man who, somehow, has been waiting for Dean all this time, and who Dean’s been waiting for for just as long. Dean smiles and shakes his head. He presses his nose into Cas’ hair, breathing in deep before kissing him and leaning back, digging his toes deeper as if to ground himself.
“Well, y’know.” Dean leans on his desk and grins. “Who’s more reliable for art supplies than the art teacher?”
The call disconnects, and Castiel sighs. Getting to Anna’s office at the Massachusetts Association for the Blind will require an extra trip on the always-pain-in-the-ass Green Line, and after riding it six days a week, he’s not thrilled at the prospect of spending his day off squeezed into an already-packed subway car just to hear his sister ask him for a (probably) ridiculously outlandish and unreasonable favor.
“Gimme that,” Sam says instead, and before Dean can do anything about it, Sam’s fucking bear hands swoop in out of nowhere and grab the phone. Dean blinks, then waves him away dismissively.
Dean scoffs. “Good riddance,” he says, waving absently at the TV screen. “‘m sure they only kept him around for the drama, anyway.”
Dean purses his lips and studies Castiel curiously. The man still won’t look him straight in the eye, and Dean worries his lower lip between his teeth, wondering if it’s his place to ask before actually doing so. “Uh, hey, are you...
When Lisa had given Ellen, the woman who acts as Dean’s second mother, the bouquet of flowers picked just for her by one of the show’s PAs, she studied them for a second, thanked her, then tossed them behind the bar when she thought no one was looking. Her husband, Bobby, scoops them up and tucks them behind the ancient cash register before embracing Dean and giving Lisa a gentle hug.
,” says Victor Henriksen, a minor league hockey player from New York. Benny Lafitte, a restaurant owner from New Orleans, adjusts his tie nervously.
“Sam won’t shut up about it, so I’ll do it.” He sounds utterly defeated, and as Castiel kicks his shoes next to the door and grabs a seat on one of the barstools in the kitchen, he finds himself wishing he could tell Dean he didn’t have to do this.
He jerks his head forward in an awkward attempt at a nod, then chuckles nervously, wondering if she can tell that he had been planning on doing just that. "I won't, Anna."
you to describe it. So you don’t get to feel like an asshole for doing something that I asked you to do, okay?”
Sam lets out a soft, humorless chuckle before taking a seat on the overstuffed recliner in the living room. "I probably should, huh?"
Dean stays silent, but Castiel can see the way his body has stiffened, and it makes him want to get up and leave, pretend he was never in the Winchester house, before he causes more damage.
away before heading for the counter, the old wood floor creaking under his feet. “It’s actually something for my boyfriend. He used to come here a lot.”
“I can’t believe you’ve never been to Bova’s,” Dean says. He’s leading Cas down one of the narrow, cobblestone streets of the North End, and clearly judging Cas’ life choices, or lack thereof.
know why he said it for sure, even though that last one is a pretty good guess, but the words are out of his mouth before he can stop them. “What’re you doing on the 29th?”
,” Dean mutters, his gaze darting between Garth and the road ahead. He slides across the seats and grabs for the wheel, jerking them back onto the road at the last second. “Uh, Garth?” he shouts over the engine. “You okay, pal?”
Dean mumbles something that sounds roughly like “Fuck off” before burrowing deeper under the covers.
The vibe that Sam gives off is warm and relaxed, so Castiel is surprised that the first thing he notices about the Winchester house is that it’s clean, almost impeccably so. He had been expecting a bit more of a frat house decor, complete with empty pizza boxes and half-drunk beer bottles; two brothers sharing a house together doesn’t exactly scream
Dean stares at him, still in disbelief that they’re even having this conversation right now. “Uh, lessee,” he finally says, ticking off the reasons on unsteady fingers. “Vacation time, sanity, m’ fucking
“Don’t make me regret this, punks,” he calls as his kids disperse across the grounds, some hunkering down under the trees, others making a beeline for the bleachers by the track a few hundred feet away.
Cas concedes and gets to his feet, wincing at the way the soles of his shoes stick to the cement floor, which is coated in stale beer, peanut shells, and who knows what else. He takes a sip of his beer as some music starts playing, and Dean grins.
He grabs a bowl and scoops himself up some oatmeal, grabs a few pieces of bacon, and makes his way to his regular table, arriving right in the middle of a conversation.
He looks down to see Cas’ fingers entwined with his and then up, where Cas is looking at him with the barest hint of a smile, just enough for Dean to recognize that this’ll be okay. He doesn’t know how, or when, but it will. Eventually. Wishing to all hell he could raise Cas’ hand and press a kiss to the back of it, he gives it a quick squeeze instead. He hears Judge Turner mention something about a public defender—fat lot of good that did him last time—so he decides to keep his focus on the warmth of Cas’ hand in his instead.
“You never told me that,” Cas says quietly, wondering what his reaction would have been even if Dean had told him. Somehow, he doesn’t think it would’ve changed anything.
“Dean…” Sam starts, but Dean waves him off. Sam can try to act like he ain’t curious as much as he wants, but Dean didn’t miss the way those massive ears of his perked up at the question.
Cas hadn’t been able to get that incident between Dean and Alistair out of his head for weeks after it aired. It had been the first time something Dean had done on the show had rang entirely true to him, felt real and raw and unedited, and thinking of the similar experiences Cas himself had gone through made him want to be sick.
Two thoughts immediately start clamoring for his attention: how unfair it is for one person to be so goddamn good-looking; and how Balthazar somehow
“Uh, there’s a stick right in--” The stick snaps in two as Dean’s feet pass over it easily, and Castiel’s cheeks go pink. “Never mind.”
“I’m not hassling you with my problems,” he says, snatching the gradebook and glaring at her from behind his sunglasses. “Christ.”
Cas doesn’t look up right away, engrossed in whatever knickknacks Bobby’s got stored up in his shelves. When he does, though, Dean’s stunned at the fact that he can practically see the way the other man’s breath catches in his throat. Cas averts his eyes fast, but not fast enough for Dean not to notice.
Cas opens his mouth to answer, but before he can, the man slams hard into his side, and Cas is quick to register the fact that Dean’s hand is no longer in his. He looks up quickly to see a pair of hands dragging Dean into the alley they were in the process of passing. Before he can try to grab for Dean and get them out of there, he’s shoved repeatedly until he’s in the alley, too. Once they’re in the shadows, their attackers moves fast; Cas lets out a gasp as the man slams him up against a wall, and when he tries to squirm out of his attacker’s grip, he gets an elbow to the face for his troubles. He catches a glimpse of Dean trying to smack his attacker with his cane; the man grabs hold of it and wrenches it out of Dean’s hands, sending it clattering to the pavement and out of Dean’s reach.
Castiel watches as Balthazar snakes his way easily through the people he had awkwardly tried to maneuver around. He watches as Balthazar flashes a bright smile at their waitress before winking at a girl sipping a midori sour at the bar. He watches as he makes effortless small talk with the bouncer at the door, clapping him on the shoulder as if they were good friends, even though they had most likely just met that very moment. He watches all these things happen, and wishes he could do them, too, which just as much ease and candor as Balthazar does.
He was supposed to meet Sam and Jess at 2:00 for their cake tasting; it’s now 2:15, and there’s still no sign of either of them. Dean slouches down further in the front seat of the Impala and watches as raindrops race each other down the windshield. The clouds up above him are dark and full of rain, and frankly doing nothing to improve Dean’s mood. He sighs and grabs his phone, thumbing through his texts to find Sam’s message with directions and the bakery name.
Cas chews on his lower lip, then nods. “Someone smashed his head with something; he's got a decent-sized cut at his hairline,” he says, gesturing with his hand toward his own hairline.
Decision made, Dean lets the front two legs of his chair drop to the floor. He scoops up his coffee cup and downs the rest of it in two gulps. He looks up to tell the PA exactly that—
Dean shrugs. The tree bark is rough and grating against his back, and he shifts slightly to scratch an itch. “Ma always taught me to tell the truth, and that’s what I’m doin’.”
Cas immediately feels a pang of guilt; he didn't mean to make Dean stay up all night, and he's suddenly irrationally afraid that Dean won't want to hang out with him anymore for fear of this lack of sleep becoming a regular thing.
“Damn it, Dean.” Sam glares at his brother, who stares back at him, daring him to say anything else. Sam turns to Castiel and sighs. “Can you give us some time alone, Castiel? Let me talk to him a little?”
Sam’s backing away from the scene looking wide-eyed and panicked. If he hadn’t already had a plan to resume his law practice once things had settled down, Dean’s certain he’d have himself a future in the pictures with how good of a show he’s putting on right now.
Cas sighs and drops his head into his hands. He can feel Charlie’s eyes on him, waiting for a response, when his phone vibrates on the table. They both look at it, and Cas grabs it, unlocks it, and reads his new text message, appropriately enough, from Dean.
Dean struggles through the class, trying and failing to keep up and contort his body into different poses and stretches while not toppling over. Lisa’s movements are smooth and graceful and balanced, and more often than not, she’s over on Dean’s mat, adjusting his posture, aligning his hips, and, at Dean’s insistence, sneaking in a few encouragement kisses.
,” Billie interrupts, and Hannah nods vigorously. “But two,” she continues, waving his concerns off, “we’ll fade to black, just for you, Novak.”
As he walks, Cas starts to think about the feeling of community and sense of home that the camp gives him. Even though he hates where most of the camp’s priorities lie, it feels like he’s spent more time here than in his actual home, and despite his parents’ insistences that he’d feel the opposite, he actually feels more at home and welcomed here regardless of his disinterest in becoming an actual soldier. They’ve got plenty of those, and they like the idea of having someone there who has their backs if things go to shit. Most of them don’t know how to stitch up even the simplest wound; Cas can stitch even the most complicated wound in the most tender spot with pinpoint accuracy.
It’s such a simple, endearing explanation, so much so that Cas leans over and presses a kiss to Dean’s cheek with a soft smile. “Thank you, Dean.”
that voice, the exact person (and voice, if he’s being totally honest) who’s been on his mind since not only the fucking trainwreck that was last night, but his first day here. He presses his lips together into a thin line before tapping the eraser on the board in subtle defeat and slowly turning around.
“Date card!” he announces, trying to stop his voice from trembling as he plasters on a grin to try and hide his nerves. His fingers fumble for the envelope’s adhesive, but before he can open it, Alastair snatches it out of his hands.
the goddamn thing, but what if he's just really good at lying, at giving people what he thinks they want? What if Cas pushed things too far, too fast, and now Dean doesn't want anything to do with him anymore? Taking a deep breath, Cas finally manages to stammer out a quick, "He's not sick."
“Oh, thank fuck.” Dean flops back down onto the couch and starts to put his earbuds back on. “I was just getting to this part when--”
It’s a beautiful day, and they’re not the only ones who’d decided to take advantage. The place is packed, people lounging in Adirondack chairs that dot the small, grassy hill behind the building, kids playing tag nearby. A section devoted entirely to cornhole and other lawn games is set up right next to where a couple of food trucks are set up, offering everything from ribs to artisan grilled cheeses.
The whole thing goes on for what seems like miles—go, then drop; go, then drop; go, then drop—until finally, Dean sees his brother stop and turn his entire body around to face back where they’d come. He’s silent for a few seconds, still as a board before throwing his arms up in the air. “Guess what, boys,” he says, smiling wide at them over his shoulder. He doesn’t wait for either of them to answer before continuing, “We’re clear!”
“Thank you.” He releases Dean’s hair and continues to inspect the cut, making a mental note of what he would need to clean and sanitize it. It doesn’t seem too deep--not deep enough for stitches--and he’s confident that he could get the dirt out with some soap and water.
“What, there had to be a reason for it? We don’t look like guys who can keep a house clean?” he asks, mock-offended.
He’s taken aback when Dean makes eye contact with him, looking almost helpless. As if realizing what he must look like, Dean screws them shut and scrubs a hand over his face. Cas doesn’t move, watching the way Dean breathes slowly through his mouth as he pulls himself together.
The living room erupts in whoops as several of Dean’s fellow bachelors clap him on the back with a mixture of excitement and jealousy. Even Kevin looks pleased, if only because Alastair’s not the one going on the date. Alastair drops the card to the glass coffee table and stalks off without a word, Raphael and Zachariah following close behind.
“You gonna keep the party going, or what?” His voice is rough and hoarse, but against his better judgement, Cas likes the sound of its huskiness in his ears. “It’d be nice if you just got it over with, so I can pass out without worrying about you goddamn jumpin’ me.”
Dean glances up toward Aiden’s dad’s voice, then back to Aiden. “Listen to your dad,” he says, “and when you finally
Cas stares at him. “I thought we were just here to sleep,” he says. “We need to be awake in four hours.”
Cas smiles, but Dean can tell he’s nervous; he’s glancing distractedly over Dean’s shoulder into the sea of people chatting and eating and schmoozing, waiting to hear them perform. Dean follows Cas’ gaze, then turns around and rests his hands on Cas’ shoulders. He leans in close, bringing his mouth right up to Cas’ ear.
The house at 485 Rochdale Street is huge, painted a calm powder blue color with white shutters, with a white wraparound porch that looks like it’s made to sip lemonade on during the summertime. Well-kept shrubs dotted with pink flowers line the house, and if Castiel had to guess, he’d say that they’re taken care of by a professional, at least on a weekly basis. Taking a deep breath, Castiel pockets the paper with his partner’s name and address and climbs out of the car, ambling toward the front door and trying his best to act like he’s not out of place, like he belongs here, like he knows what the hell he's doing.
“I can do it,” Dean says, taking a few steps to the side until he’s standing over the cutting board situated on the counter. “What, just cut ‘em like regular fries?”
“I said he deserved someone who would make him happy,” he says slowly, “not that she’d be the one to do it.
“Hi, sweetie,” she says, taking a few steps forward before closing the door behind her. “How are--oh, is that from Wildwood?”
“Oh, pleasure’s all mine.” He grins and takes yet another sweeping glance over her body. “Find me inside?”
What’s shittier, though, is the fact that as they walk, Dean’s got nothing to do but stew in the scorching late-afternoon heat—not unless he wants to
She winks at him, then gets to her feet. “Let’s get these hooligans back together, huh?” She doesn’t wait for his response before putting two fingers to her mouth and letting out a whistle that has Dean cringing unconsciously as he packs up his bag. “Yo!” she yells across the grounds. “Two minutes, guys and dolls! That goes for you too, Picassos!”
Chuck Shurley, the show’s host since its inception nearly thirty seasons ago, is waiting for Dean in the main foyer of the building, and Dean grins at him when he enters.
Dean waves him off, testing what’s gotta be the ninth or tenth key in the lock to get them into the pen. Tenth time’s the charm, apparently, because the key finally turns in the lock with a satisfying
like we’re making plans here. ‘m gonna see if I can get my hands on a map, or at least some decent directions from the barkeep.”
“My mistake.” Cas smirks and turns off his phone before sliding it back into his pocket. As discreetly as possible, with the overly optimistic hope of a nervous elementary schooler passing a “Do you like me, check yes or no” note to his crush, he grabs a pen and marks Dean as his runner-up on his bracket, with the secret, far-flung hope that maybe, just maybe he’d somehow run into Dean on the street, they’d fall head over heels for each other, and
Dean gives him a small, tired smile before grabbing the menu again. "Y'know what this place has the best of?"
Cas nods, wishing he could channel Gabriel’s flirting ability that he somehow never managed to get a firm grasp on. Granted, he never really wanted a firm grasp on it, but now, he wants nothing more than to flirt with the boy who just accidentally bashed his face in.
“Christ, dude, get that stick out of your ass,” Dean mutters, leaning back against the couch and crossing his leg at the knee as they watch one of the contestants, an insurance agent named Harry Spangler, dig into Ruby, berating her for objectifying his fellow bachelors during a group date of strip dodgeball, calling her the event classless and disgraceful. “Who can blame her for wanting to see those male modeling sons of bitches in all their glory.”
Dean smiles and kisses Cas one more time. He holds his hand out, palm up, looking through his eyelashes at Cas. Cas adjusts the hat so that it’s snug over Dean’s ears, then entwines his fingers with Dean’s. Dean smiles at him once more before turning his attention back up to the sky.
“Whenever.” Dean’s response is short and curt, and for a second, Castiel considers hanging up and telling Anna that it wouldn’t work out, that he couldn’t do it. He could lie, say that he never heard from the Winchesters again, and just assumed they decided against it. Hell, that’s probably what Dean wants, too.
2. I've never run a marathon. The closest I've come is a 5K, so same thing as above applies: any inaccuracies are on me, and please let me know if anything major should be changed.
Somehow, they eventually manage to maneuver themselves to a lying position on the couch, with Dean on his back now and Cas straddling his hips, looking down at him.
does, whether he’s worthy of showing up on your feed or not?” Billie rolls her eyes. “You follow at least twelve different dog accounts, Cas. At
They don’t have to wait long for the bus to start moving; about five minutes later, the doors close and the driver pulls away from the Common to make room for more shuttle buses, slowly maneuvering through the winding Boston streets.
Cas wets his lips, just barely, before hazarding a glance down at Dean’s. It’s not a conscious decision, but Dean can feel himself lean closer over the table. He’s got his eyes fixed on Cas’, smiling in spite of himself when he feels Cas’ fingers ghost across his own on the tabletop.
In a wordless gesture of permission, Lisa stays where she is, and practically melts into Dean’s touch when he rests his hand on her cheek. He presses his lips to hers and they kiss, long and loud and just a little bit sloppy.
The episodes move fast, but they’re still a good nine or ten away from the fantasy suites. That doesn’t stop Ruby and Dick from going at it during what’s supposed to be a group date; they’re constantly reduced to nothing but giggling middle schoolers, trying (and failing) to keep the secret that they want each other to themselves.
Michael’s focused on Winchester, his back to Cas, and doesn’t notice him until he realizes that Winchester’s attention is elsewhere. “Hey,” Michael says sharply, reaching out and grabbing Winchester’s jaw roughly, forcing Winchester to lock eyes with him. “Did I say you could look away, asshole?”
Asmodeus Parise, the target of Ketch’s eventual ire, is also Dean’s handiwork. A wiry little fella who can’t keep his trap shut to save his life (and who, if Dean’s being completely honest, has probably spewed shit about
“No,” Cas says, jabbing a fork across the table at Dean. “You don’t get to pretend that didn’t happen; that girl acted like you were one of the Beatles.”
Castiel gives Dean another smile, this one just as small, but shining with a bit more confidence that makes warmth flare up in Dean’s chest. “Thank you, Dean.”
you come, because there’s no way in hell I’m letting you sulk in here alone all night. Now put on some normal pants and let’s go.”
Zachariah twirls his wrist, gesturing for Cas to continue. “What, do you need an extension? Want to work at home a bit, get those creative juices flowing?”
By the time they get to the tail end of the latest episode, it’s clear that, as much as he tried to avoid it, Dean’s all in. He’s leaning forward, resting his elbows on his knees, hands tented over his mouth and nose as he watches Ruby leave a particularly odd cocktail party where she declined to give out a rose, opting instead to head for a more private area away from the men and (most of) the cameras, where a masked producer is waiting to talk with her. And Dean’s so invested, so locked in, so fucking
“Either of you planning to fill me in?” he asks once they enter the living room. He glances at Cas, then adds, “And introducing me to the third stooge, while you’re at it?”
Dean scoffs and waves Castiel’s apology away, which takes Castiel by surprise. He expected a verbal beat-down, Dean chewing him out and swearing at him in the middle of the street again, but a laugh was the
Balthazar purses his lips. “Right, he’s much too old for you, isn’t he,” he muses. Cas can tell he’s running through every staff member they’ve interacted with, and he’s momentarily calmed down by the fact that he’s only been to Alchemy alone. There’s no way he’d know who Dean is; he’s safe, at least for the time being.
“There’s a difference between putting yourself out there at a goddamn…” Dean waves his hand, frustrated as he tries to think up the right words, “...speed-dating night down at Dive Bar and putting yourself out there on national
It takes all of thirty seconds after Cas leaves the tent for him to start being peppered with questions about Winchester.
“Today’s topic,” Dean says, turning his back to the class as he writes on the chalkboard in quick, uneven strokes, “memes.”
“There are no cameras here,” he says finally. “And you’re a good guy. Knew you wouldn’t rat me out.” He rubs the back of his neck uncomfortably, as if he’s trying to decide if he should continue, before mumbling, “If I’d met you here, I’d take you out.” He pauses once more, then finishes with an uncertain, “Just wanted to pretend.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “Dude, he was looking at you way more than us. Hell, he seemed more concerned with whether or not
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas says stiffly, realizing that his practice didn’t do him much good; his own voice sounds awkward in his ears. He makes a beeline for the fridge and grabs a carton of milk. He looks over his shoulder as he starts to fix himself some cereal, trying to take note of Dean’s features without being too obvious.
The guy cranes his neck to look behind him as Sam rambles on; Dean follows his gaze, and that’s when he notices a handful of other cars heading their way. Newsboy situates himself back behind the wheel and smiles again.
Dean clears his throat, startling Castiel out of his reverie, and when he speaks, his voice is strained with exertion. “Can I help you?” he asks.
that Cas doesn’t even have to think about it. He digs into his pocket for his phone and snaps a quick picture. It’s a shot of Dean’s side profile, slivers of the laptop and TV screens in frame as well, making it clear that he's watching the show with the rest of the group.
“He’s a bit of an upgrade from Uriel, isn’t he?” Cas muses, thinking back to his first-ever crush back in third grade.
Dean looks up sharply, having expected Sammy’s voice and being met with Novak’s low growl instead. He’s just in time to see Novak looking at him before darting his eyes back down to the ground. Dean can feel himself start grinning and before he can think better of it, leans over and nudges Novak with his elbow until the guy’ll look at him again. When he does, Dean lets his smile widen. “One for all.”
kissing Dean had been incredible, but actually doing so? Cas can’t think of anything else he’d rather do. Dean’s warmth next to him, in his mouth, in his heart, is worth losing every job for the rest of his life, because at least he’d be able to come home to the person he feels safest with. The person who cares so much for people that he’d spend all his free time protecting them.
Dean's eyes go bright in the darkness, and Cas' heart jumps a little. "That'd be awesome, dude. You're not reading it?"
They talk about what they think Dean’s like when he’s drunk (“Oh, the smoothest, no question”) or high (“He’d just sit there and cuddle and giggle and eat chips all night”), whether or not he’ll have a gimmick coming out of the limo (“Fuck, no, he doesn’t need it”), and what they’d do if they had a kid in Dean’s class and met him during parent-teacher conferences (“I mean, I wouldn’t be upset if my kid had to stay back an extra year...or three”).
Cas forces a smile onto his face, reminding himself that she doesn’t know Dean won’t be able to read it.
Once she’s gone, Cas grabs his pen with a mind to resume his work, but instead, a message from the company IM system pops up.
“Then why haven’t you hauled ass outta here yet?” Dean motions to their waiter for two more beers, and finishes his off. “It was a combination of a lot of things,” he continues, “but I’d be lyin’ if I said you weren’t one of ‘em.”
Michael closes his eyes and grins. “Perfect.” He grabs his overcoat and heads for the tent’s entrance, clapping Cas on the back as he goes. “He’s all yours, Novak. Enjoy.”
The group date obstacle course I wrote about in this chapter is based on a real Bachelorette group date, which
This doesn’t mean anything, he tells himself as he opens a new DM and types in Dean’s name, catching his lower lip between his teeth. He’s just killing time before his train arrives. That’s it.
“Do you hear that?” Dean’s head shoots up in frustration, expecting to see Cas looking even more annoyed than he feels, but instead he just sees the crown of Cas’ head, his face still buried in his book. Dean looks down to the tabletop and sees Cas’ hand out, palm up. When he doesn’t move, Cas curls his fingers toward the center of his palm.
“No,” Cas says, grabbing his foot and awkwardly balancing as he rubs his toe for a few seconds. “Not exactly.”
The door to the break room creaks open, and Cas considers looking up, but chooses instead to keep his eyes closed and try to squeeze in a power nap to make the most out of his half-hour of freedom.
Dean nods. “I have a question first, though.” Cas stays silent, waiting for him to continue. “You know how I said you’re good at describing things?”
Cas is on him instantly, straddling his hips and keeping him pinned. “Get the fuck off me, you son of a bitch!” Dean yells, struggling to catch Cas’ wrists and regain even the slightest upper hand he can. Fucking Cas is always one step ahead of him, though, and manages to drive the heel of one hand down against Dean’s shoulder, using it to steady himself as he delivers a punch of his own.
They snap a few, and both girls thank him profusely before going back to their table. Dean resumes eating without comment, but Cas stares at him. Dean glances up—probably after not hearing any smartass remarks—then looks over his shoulder.
Dean studies the flyer, which Sam’s got held up in front of the tiny ramshackle building. It’s not much of anything; Dean probably would’ve continued right on past without a second look. Hell, it sure doesn’t look like anything worth stopping for. The only reason he knows it ain’t just an old run-of-the-mill house is because of the massive signal tower out front.
Cas microwaves himself some leftover pasta and brings it over to the table, where his notepad and pen are lying from where he’d left them at work. While he waits for the pasta to cool, he uncaps the pen with his teeth and drums it against the blank paper, then starts writing.
“We only met him once, but Dean’s a good guy. And if he found someone who makes him happy, whether it’s through the show or not, then I’m counting it as a good thing. ‘S all I’m saying. I’m happy for him.”
