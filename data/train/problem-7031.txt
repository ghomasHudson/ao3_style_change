And Steve tried to remember why he had to… but apparently his thoughts were all…
And, yeah, Tony was
An understanding that that was just… perfect, for more reasons than he could list right now.
And, at the same time, he could look at Tony now and think,

“So, I’m also here for you when it’s different,” Bucky smiled, casually. “I’m pretty sure that’s what ‘always’ means, anyway.”
As his mindless little tour of their quarters came full circle, his eyes fell on the bar in the corner of the living room – the tall, crystal cabinet, displaying hundreds of amber bottles…and little vials of pills.
But every time he thought about it, he got a horrible, queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach, like when he had to hand his mother an angry letter from one of his elementary school teachers. A fear that Pepper would be disappointed in him. A fear that it would ruin something.

the things he wasn’t sorry for, without making everything worse. How to tell Tony how he felt about him – especially without… you know, actually telling Tony how he felt about him…
“And Sergeant Barnes?”

And Tony said it was good
But that wasn’t the same thing.
sorry for that, and when all this over I’ll tell you that properly, and I’ll be nicer about it. And then things will just be better than they were, and that’s as good as things are ever going to be, and that’s the reality.”
“Right, I should probably focus on uninjuring people, before I injure any more people,” he babbled, turning his attention back to Bucky.
And it wasn’t that Steve could think of anything he’d done wrong… yet. It was the worrying realisation that he should’ve thought about that
“Okay –
And then the hesitant excitement of wondering if there were more possibilities than he’d previously realised… other choices besides ‘live for other people’ and ‘live for yourself’. Maybe there were ways of doing both. Maybe there were moments that weren’t one or the other – maybe that was okay. Maybe Steve
...And he was excited about it.
So, instead, he steeled himself, his chest aching with hope as he met Tony’s gaze and asked him,
Steve was trying to get a mental image of the building from one corner of the basement.
He hadn’t realised just how big a part of things that was, until he was forced to do without it.

But it wasn’t as though he had any
He sighed, heavily, and resigned himself to a few hours in the gym. Which seemed like a shallow, pointless use of all this adrenaline, but he couldn’t think of anything else-

Or maybe it was a universal human thing, to be shocked to realise how young your own parents were, that the people you once thought of as old were really so young at the time…
But what actually happened was a slow, creeping realisation
Really, he could’ve relaxed that instinct just a little on this occasion-
The blonde guy walked into the room, carrying yet another tray. Behind him was a redhaired woman, holding a polished wooden panel, a little larger than a pillow. Tony’s eyes naturally followed them, and their activity, as Belle carried on talking – his attention still mainly focused on his own shoulder.

Steve felt a little lift inside him, something it took him a second to name… he was
So… Did he want to listen to this?
On the plus side, it seemed increasingly likely that he would literally die of shame before too long…
And then Steve cried.
“I, uh… Well, I hate watching the work being done…” Bucky answered, thoughtfully. Hesitating over something.
But, as Steve carried on talking, his words coming faster and more fluidly and with a certain sort of…
...And discovered that it was a sketch of a man's forearm, clearly intended as a medical diagram, with lines pointing to seemingly arbitrary points, and no annotation.
“Oh, Tony, please Tony,
But, on the other hand, there was something nice about knowing that they were actually dealing with this thing. As much as Tony would’ve liked to listen to his instincts above all else, there was something more comforting in the idea that they were going to make this work with their lives, and their jobs and their responsibilities. It made everything seem more tangible, more real.
He’d never thought that someone might think him capable, and value his opinion, and make efforts
“Can I?”
It was the structure that was missing.
“Well, I don’t - I don’t… think he thinks about any of
As coherent and cognisant as any thought that had ever come into his head – a hell of a lot more sensible than half the bullshit he’d been thinking for years, he realised now.
And, yes, there was
“Yes,” Steve gasped, writing up against Tony’s hand. Tony fumbled at his unfastened Steve’s jeans, his entire body starting to tremble as he slip his hand into Steve’s underwear and curled his fingers around his cock. “
“Hm, lovely isn’t it?” The guide beamed, with complete sincerity. “We’re very proud of it.”
“Mm-hm,” Steve nodded. “It’s not much help, but it’s something - if you want to read the file.”
“Okay, you know you’re acting weird, right?” Rhodey sighed, taking a step closer. “So, are you going to tell me what happened?”
…But this was the

He was gripped by the same focusing adrenaline that he might’ve felt if he’d been walking a tightrope-
“Oh, right, that… the update, yeah,” Steve murmured, some of the tension returning to his shoulders as he reached up to rub the sleep from his eyes. “An hour…”
And then he thought about it

I never thought that maybe you had a right to be mad, that I’d still fucked up, even though it turned out you weren’t perfect – and, I mean, it’s more than that. I mean – I was so, furious, that you were mad about ULTRON, when you’d kept the secret over Bucky... And I never thought, maybe I couldn’t be mad about Bucky, because I’d kept the secret over ULTRON.

“And, while we’re on the topic – if you do have any drugs that’d make a human more susceptible to interrogation, that’d be great.” Tony chipped in.
“Power” Tony shrugged “That’s all it ever comes down to, in the end. Having more stuff than the next guy, more land, more influence, whatever – there are probably a handful of people on any planet, prepared to go too far, for that…”
There will also be other one shots as part of the 1k milestone event, but I figure people can subscribe to the series if they're interested in it, so I won't be adding a new chapter to this every time I add one 😂

Maybe then Tony would have the space to think about it properly. Consider what he actually wanted, and what might really be possible, without all those other responsibilities to complicate things.
He could feel Bucky and Sam having a silent conversation over the top of his head. He wondered if there was any chance that they were high enough to forget all of this by the morning… But he doubted it. It didn’t seem like that sort of inebriation.
Tony stomped out of the elevator, clenching his teeth so hard it was making his jaw ache. He threw his White House Security Pass onto the coffee table in a little fit of petulance, and then sulkily fell into the couch. There was, as always, a stack of envelopes and legal documents waiting on the table by the door – but Tony didn’t have the mental energy to think about them yet. Instead, he let his head fall back onto the couch cushions, and opened his mouth to call for Steve-
“Sorry, not familiar” He managed, barely above a whisper. Already braced for the shocked exclamation –
…And then the somewhat shaper realisation that, no, this wasn’t
caveated ‘but you could be so much better, if you would only change’.
Wondering if this was a bad idea.
“Well, I guess that depends on what we find when we get there,” Tony panted. “Whatever we have to do to get inside, I suppose.”
He realised he was kneeling on the floor of a large empty room, walled on all sides by flawless glass, not unlike the expensive offices at the tops of skyscrapers… And he was up high. Not as high as his room in the Tower, maybe… But at least fifty stories. High enough to make out the shape of a sky line, to be looking down on the rooftops of surrounding buildings and blur the details on the ground below...
felt like a big deal, at the moment.
“Well, Bulsara is known as a place where people come to be happy,” Dr Arden answered with a knowing grin, “and lies and secrets don’t make anyone happy.”
And then actually looked to Steve as though he was waiting for permission to leave.
about Steve Rogers, something forbidden and…
Except that, occasionally, and with no warning what-so-ever, Tony would remember some little detail about the night before.
At least, until he felt Tony press another sweet little kiss to his skin, an inch lower, his hands slowly spreading Steve open.
Steve wasn’t sure exactly
to pay attention as Tony explained the step-by-step details of the procedure… But it was just a list of words in his head. Steve couldn’t engage his brain at all right now.
With that, Steve let go of a breath that he didn’t know he was holding - feeling the tension melt away from his legs along with it. For a split second he literally felt unsteady on his feet-
things more clearly now. And it wasn’t just that he was more aware, or more awake, or because his senses had all improved – this was a more cerebral thing. Like the moment when he finally worked out the crucial flaw in a complex theory, but applied to his entire life. A dawning sense of realisation…
The images being played on the sides of the skyscrapers…
when Steve was home. The countless moments of existential fear as he’d asked himself,
– just so
“Not really. It’ll be fine. I’ll… fix it later.”
. Always. Forever…”
But it was still there, barely contained, right under the surface…
And there was no way he could say any of that out loud anyway.
“We’re having breakfast with Tony and his boyfriend” She told him, already walking over to drag the next table closer. Tony forgot that he wasn’t supposed to flinch, hearing Steve called that. Luckily neither of their new friends were in any state to notice. “This is my husband Andrew, by the way”
And then there was an ethereal, ascending musical note… like a harp, but…
Everything from that moment to this had just…
He’d been forced to accept that he really couldn’t hold Bucky responsible for the death of his parents - that he
A low growl escaped him, from somewhere deep in his chest.
… you know,
...Oh, but could he
“Yeah, I’m okay…” Steve huffed.
And Steve thought he never would.
…Tony remembered this moment.
But there was a deeper satisfaction to this, now.
“This isn’t about personality profiles anymore,” Coulson replied, tersely.
And Steve glanced over at Tony, and watched him take a little USB pen out of his pocket, and press a button on the side – a button Steve knew meant ‘

more softly. “So why can’t you come over here? When I’m
As quietly as he could, he rose from the couch and stepped into the hall, pausing to survey the area. He cast a glance at his shield, resting in its usual place by the front door, but he didn’t reach for it yet. A quick calculation suggested it might be better to start this thing with both hands free.
He just took that pill, because he was supposed to… And, as he swallowed it, he
And then Bucky pushed himself up on his arms, ending up in the same legs-out position as Steve, already scanning the room with an increasing awareness…
What that said about him, he didn’t know… But there it was.
And then, out of nowhere, the floor disappeared beneath him.
He knew that he

Maybe Tony was seeing things that weren’t really there.
And then there was a firm hand, gripping his shoulder.

Which meant fewer believable cover stories, no way not to draw attention.

Steve’s shoulders bunched with an irritated sort of weariness - a vague idea that he was too bothered right now to be bothered with anything…
He wasn’t actually thinking about his introduction to SHIELD anymore, or about Nick or Nat - but, whether he knew it or not, it was all feeding into his elation. There couldn’t possibly have been a more symbolic or cathartic beginning to this new chapter in his life. He could
A part of Steve responded to that, instantly and instinctively and
This room looked very different, now that he could look at it with more sober eyes…
He was right to tell Steve his point of view, as well as being right about several of those arguments.
“Oh, God, Tony, I’m so sorry,” Steve gasped, hardly able to process how very sorry he was. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that to sound so- I don’t even know why I said that at all. I’m just - I’m sorry.”

And then suddenly there were all these words in Tony’s head. He even heard them in Obie’s voice.
“So clever,” Steve whispered close, punctuating it with the same barely-there scrape of his teeth, and the same tender press of his lips, a little lower down his neck. Tony’s heavy panting was interrupted by desperate, high pitched squeaking sounds as Steve carried on in that same pattern, marking every kiss with an endearment,
Which had been a tough mantra to stick to, because that was the only type of ‘love’ he was ever offered.
He was vaguely aware of a lull around him. The general feeling of people paying attention to him again.
Only ever
And Steve’s hands were in his hair
“I tried…” Steve whispered… but the thought of finishing that sentence was suddenly overwhelming. If he couldn’t take the blame, if he couldn’t spiral into all the things he wished he could have done… Then he was just left with what had actually happened. How he really felt about it. And the idea of having to go through those events again, trying to find the words for all those conflicting emotions, struggling to decide whether he should say he was hurt or angry-
His sleepy expression sharpened suddenly, when he saw the obvious distress on Steve’s face.
The night he’d drunkenly called Tony beautiful, and then fallen asleep in his lap, and then felt horribly guilty about… it was pleasantly amusing, to think of it now-
find an explanation for his father’s behaviour, even if it wasn’t anything supernatural, even if it wasn’t anything to do with Steve-
Even now that they were so much closer, even though their little interactions did occasionally bubble over into actual conversations these days, there were still things that simply fell outside the bounds of their relationship. Tony just knew they did.
That warm feeling he got sometimes, when Tony was talking about Steve.
As she walked by, the mother caught his eye very briefly, not even long enough to notice his unconventional haircut or 21st Century outfit - just long enough to share an awkward smile at her son’s harmless misbehaviour.

Another howl of laughter broke out from the other end of the table, and Steve didn’t bother to hide his sullen pout.

to calm himself down first.
And then his eyes happened to catch on the tray, sitting ominously at the very corner of his vision. It occurred to him that he really didn’t know what any of those drinks were – and that that was
“Indeed there is,” Freddie replied with a far-too-friendly smile. “As a matter of fact, there is a full guide that we’d be delighted to share with you - it also contains a more detailed itinerary of events, and some details on the history of Bulsara, and the festival.”
And yes, those memories
especially attractive or endearing for Tony to have flopped down onto the floor like that… like a big kid… That there was no basis for this reaction – this sudden impulse to smile.
And Steve knew before he even said it that he’d said it at least ten times already. He
how it felt to wake up in the 21st Century when you never expected to wake up at all. The strange mix of relief and terror that eventually boiled into a numb, confused trauma.
“Did it feel heavy, the last time?” Tony questioned, glancing back at him. He saw the flicker of thought behind Bucky’s eyes.
“Jesus fuck,” Tony groaned, digging his nails into Steve’s hips.
“For a picture of you,” Wesley mumbled, averting his eyes again. Tony made a big show of letting go of a frustrated sigh, and pointedly gathering his patience again.
true that Tony had always had his own apologies to make, regardless of what Steve had done.
And then Tony sighed, his body softening against Steve’s grip as he let his head fall back-
unbearable to him.
And Steve could see that same feeling in Tony’s eyes, as had overwhelmed him when Tony said
He didn’t know why.
There was a bottle of champagne waiting in Tony’s hotel room, along with two branded glasses and a corporate-looking greeting card.
Stark looked like…

“That’s it baby, keep drinking, it’s going to be okay, just keep going…”

“Really?” Steve cut in, incredulously. “This
“Sir? I apologise for the interruption…”
But really, Steve was so beautiful in that moment that Tony really
“Yes, thank you JARVIS, I’m reminded,” Tony snapped, a hot terror coiling tighter in his chest with every ring…
But if Steve started thinking about that, then it would be all too easy to start thinking about Tony, and the things he wanted to do the moment that Tony got back-
And then, at last, Tony bit down –
And, as much fun as that would be, Steve had other plans.
He knew immediately that Tony was right. At least about it making far more sense for him to come to Siberia… Probably about everything.
Steve’s heart froze in his chest.
“In my defence, actually, I bought

for, not just someone he wanted to save. Someone who could be the other half of him. Someone he could share his entire life with…
And then Tony sucked again, shorter and shallower this time, like an electric shock through his already over sensitive flesh-
“No,” Pepper answered bluntly – and Tony laughed. And then, before he could attempt to push them away from the subject, she commented, “in fact, the last time I saw you, you were borderline catatonic.”

Or, 'See, I'm quite reasonable about things if you bother to discuss them with me'
“I know all your worries were about the big picture. The long term and the underlying meaning. And… you’re not wrong, about that being important. And, looking back, maybe I was just… unwilling to even engage with that. So desperate to fix things

“Well, we’d have to work the details out.” Tony answered, softly. “You look tired.” Again, Zan just nodded.
…” Steve pulled a face, like he’d bitten into something sour. “And that was how you saw me after that, and that was where we started, because of that –
“It didn’t really work,” Steve heard himself mumble, still dazed.
“Who hired you?” Tony asked, after a pause. Wesley looked down at the floor.
“…What?” Tony asked eventually. But, as the word left his mouth, he suddenly remembered “Oh! The mission! Oh my God, we’re still on a mission… I’d literally forgotten all about that” And – still somewhat reluctantly – he climbed out of Steve’s lap to go and find his file reader. “That is a very good point, we should absolutely stop the people who are enslaving an alien race…” He muttered to himself, watching the screen load, feeling ever so slightly guilty that he’d been so
“No, nothing like that,” Steve assured him. “It’s just… I had to meet with the legal people today, about the Maximoff twins. And it was deeply irritating. That’s all.”
He shook that thought away especially violently.
And then there was that wave of pleasure that just kept crashing,

Steve bit it back and forced himself to keep looking in Tony’s general direction. For the time being, he was more grateful than resentful that Tony seemed entirely focused on Bucky.
“I should get back and get murdered,” he said, brightly – and Tony did manage a smile for that.
you. And if you didn’t tell me the whole truth, it would only be because you were scared or because of the pressure - and I’d understand that, so I could still like you. I wouldn’t have to ‘deal with that’. So, you know, why not just ask? What was I worried about ruining…”
Sometimes he was able to drown out the memories with very forced thoughts about something else – which, really, just traded one mental anxiety for another. Standing with his shoulders painfully clenched, deliberately getting himself angry over some other triviality, could hardly be considered a victory over his obsession with Steve… Just another form it could take, sometimes.
And Tony warned himself to pay attention. That, now more than ever, he had to know as much as possible about the drugs in this place.
Only that he wasn’t going to do anything that would hurt or upset Tony - which was still true. He still had no intention of putting Tony in an awkward position, or doing anything devious to sabotage his relationship, or asking him to choose
…And he didn’t.
He could feel the miserable anxiety plunging ever deeper as he watched Tony watch that video-
Steve spotted the staircase at the far end of the room immediately, but he forced himself to pause and scan for threats before he moved.
“Well, we worked it out eventually…” He smiled.
And yet…
Steve thought again of his younger self. He thought of a man who was, by now, a total stranger, about to embark on an entirely different life to the one Steve had known. A man who had the same face and family history as he did… but not much else.
“And I can’t be the one to make you happy, and there’s probably not much I can do to help…” Tony just carried on, over the top of Steve’s increasingly desperate muffled yelling  “But I could probably help more, if I just got it through my head that my feelings don’t count in this, and there isn’t a compromise, and we’re not building anything. There are just those things… that maybe I even see better now, I don’t know… things I wasn’t kind enough about before, because I was still thinking like I mattered. Like there was some point in trying to prove I was your equal or as important as anyone else you cared about, or as worthy of it. And if I hadn’t been so desperate – so hopelessly,
- but I

“No, I’m going in, and once I’ve shut down the central system,
Sober, and clear headed, and thinking of
“You ready to go?” Tony asked, and Steve nodded.
He resented Steve, for making these efforts instead of accepting the hurt he’d actually caused, for managing Tony’s reactions rather than dealing with them – for putting it on Tony’s shoulders, for making Tony the asshole for not going along with it.
It occurred to him that he should probably ask… Although, with no real sense of anxiety. He knew that there was no great secret about it. It was simply one of many details that he should probably catch up on...
He’d always wanted to be Tony’s friend.
He wouldn’t have known what to call it.
Erring on the side of caution, Steve had promised himself that he would steer well clear of anything his team had done on their mission to collect the stones - just so that he wouldn’t have to worry about the nature of a paradox that he didn’t fully understand.
And then, finally, Tony recognised why Steve was so shocked. He realised how quickly he’d  managed to move across that workshop. How firmly he still had a hold of Steve’s arm. Not as strong a grip as it could have been, because Tony had been thinking of
to say something, to explain, to
His protector.
“Uh, yeah, sure, why not,” Bucky shrugged, before he’d really thought about the question. It was only after he’d said yes that he realised… he
“You got any plans for how you want to do this?” Steve asked, as they were leaving the room.
The sudden, cold shock of Tony’s fingertip teasing at his hole again, now wet with lube. And Steve had no idea where Tony had retrieved that from, or when, or-
And then he wrapped the banket around Tony, and felt Tony snuggle closer into his arms, and that was all he cared about.
“You can’t keep that close an eye on everyone in this place.” Steve added, “You’ve been watching us.”
Steve had never given that night much thought, probably because there had been so many more traumatic nights than that in his life… well, in just that week, when he thought back to it.
“Tony” He smiled – and then, in a bright, shiny burst of sudden inspiration, he added “You should join us for breakfast.”
And then he realised… and looked up, and saw Steve realise…
And Steve was very briefly thrown.
“...Do me a favour JARVIS,” he announced. “Pull up the most detailed map of Sokovia you can find - and see if we can find a list of all the known warehouses, or similar facilities.”
And he just took it.
make him feel better. That it might not mean anything to Steve, or between the two of them – but that it might help Tony get this out of his system. Let him stop doing it in front of the mirror, or in his own head when he was trying to get to sleep… that it might in some way help him to let go, move on. That this might be one step towards the sad compromise he’d only just recognised, and bitterly accepted…
And Steve was just

… and then nothing.
And then the reassuring press of Tony’s palm against the inside of Steve’s thigh.
And, God, Tony was suddenly so angry.
Steve barked a frustrated moan, his entire body pulled tight with desperation, his cock achingly hard and burning for any sort of contact. For a second, Steve was too charged with need to even register the pause, still kicking his jeans over his legs without thinking, his hands still clawing at Tony’s sides.
Steve would try to tell him, he’d try to explain how wrong Tony was and how much he loved him, he’d

Tony wanted to smile at that. He felt like Bucky deserved a smile for that… But he couldn’t manage it. So, instead, he just nodded,

. That he was coming to meet Steve at the door.
“So… How…?” Steve questioned, cautiously. Hardly daring to hope-
This was as mindless as everything that had just fallen out of his mouth – but this came from a different place entirely. This was just good old-fashioned shock and fear and embarrassment. This was him being defensive, and reactionary, because he’d found himself neck deep in a situation he couldn’t understand or explain… and because he was

Steve looked at her for a moment.
“My name is Steve Rogers,” he started, leaving a pause for Tony to register the name. “My plane went down over the Arctic seventy years ago, but I was able to survive because of the serum. A SHIELD exploration team found that plane, and they were able to wake me up.”
And then something else caught Steve’s attention…
“You look tired,” he commented, biting back a little smile.
And then just as abruptly looked away.
But he still hadn’t made his decision.
It took him by surprise. One slow, heavy tear that seemed to come from nowhere, that gave way to two, and then three, as Tony thought about every story that Steve had told him about Bucky, all the little habits and turns of phrase that Steve had picked up from him - the hope and hurt that flashed in his eyes whenever he talked about him… Tony hadn’t realised just how desperate he was to bring Steve’s friend home for him, until right now.

“Uh, well, it…” Bucky frowned again, working it out as he spoke. “…It might be
It was only then that Steve realised his head was swimming. It took a second for his vision to clear… and then there was Tony.
“And as for ‘this is not who you are’,” Steve carried on, “what, I’m usually better than this so now it’s my job to be better than this? She never makes the effort so now no one expects her to make the effort, is that it?”
And he knew it
That meant he had been curled up at the end of the couch for about five hours.

Steve felt yet another flash of white-hot anger, as he recognised what that meant – and then another, and another, as he remembered more and more little details… as he realised how far back this went, just how
He’d have to hope and pray that Tony didn’t leave him over it-
So brave.
His mind began to clear –

He observed, calmly, that this was a very good example of the sort of thing that made him anxious. He remembered, belatedly, to ask himself,
How close this was going to be.
“You know, I once drank a Norse God under the table.”
Officially speaking, he’d never told Bucky about his hopeless crush on Tony Stark - although, of course, they both knew that he knew. But speaking it into existence was different, and Bucky understood that. He knew why Steve was so reluctant to acknowledge this, to make it real, to make it fully a part of himself…

And then, in a flash of inspiration, like the thought had come from nowhere-
that he could hear Steve’s voice in his head.
Even now, in this state of eerie enlightenment, Tony couldn’t quite make sense of that impulse… He might not have been up to feeling guilty over it, but that didn’t mean he could
He wanted to feel that happiness, that freedom, that thrill of anticipation. He wanted to remember every single minute of this day, and all the threads between them.
He heard Tony take a slow breath, with just the hint of a smile in there somewhere, as he put his hands over Steve’s, and let his weight settle back against him.

friction that was more unbearable than nothing. But he couldn’t help himself. Steve was so out of his mind with need, so tense and eager, that he simply couldn’t keep his body still-
“You draw it yourself, though?” Tony asked more directly, snapping Steve out of himself.
That there might even be some sort of a pattern, some outside variable…
And he stayed fixed in the moment, his attention entirely focused on Tony, his mind falling completely silent as he watched the cuffs closing around his wrist, and felt that pressure close tight against his skin again, and surrendered to the strange, weightless sensation that came over him as Tony secured them to the headboard. Steve waited until Tony lent away again before he gave the chains the tiniest trial pull, just to feel the resistance running up along his arms. And then he looked back up at Tony - who was just gazing down on him, adoringly.
It felt… Indulgent.

So, he shook the thought away, and glanced up to ask Sam and Bucky if they actually wanted to do this thing-
He stayed close to the wall, his eyes fixed on the target, reminding himself that his best chance was to commit to this completely.
And, in his fury and his misplaced panic, his mind was capable of picking out just the moments that fit this outrage. The individual arguments and actions – whoever they came from – that had contributed to a lifetime of impotent anger. The images that could be pulled into a theme that he’d settled on anyway, a general mood, a

Bucky reached over and gave his shoulder a reassuring pat.
And then he hesitated, when his gaze focused on Steve’s chest.
As it was, his heart seized in his chest.

And then, out of nowhere, there was that voice again.

Still, Steve took for granted that he was.

It was the way that Tony and Sam paused that snagged his attention. And the more focused tone in Tony’s voice when he asked,

Everything else, yeah – at least for the time being. Right now, as ridiculous as it sounded, Tony really could believe that he and Steve could have something. That it could balance out and be good and make sense… Even if it was all the product of this euphoria, even if it did evaporate in the morning, right now he could see it…
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispered, urgently.
But he’d never

, when Steve kissed his neck. It sent shivers all the way through him; it made him want to curl in on himself with the intensity of it. And then Steve kissed him again, soft and deep, just under his ear, and his throat again, and then the curve where his neck met his shoulder… Tony just turned to water, his arms falling uselessly against the bed as Steve kissed his chest, and his arms. Steve’s hands caressed firmly over Tony’s ribs, and then his hips – and then suddenly they were on Tony’s belt, and then his zipper, and then one hand was sliding under the waistband of his underwear.
And Tony
two weeks without seeing him.
A life like that was worth fighting for.
And there was the tiniest little intake of breath on the other end of the line, a sound that managed to be frightened and brave, stoic and defiant, all at once…
Steve broke out into a grin before he could stop himself. Even as he was telling himself that he didn’t know this woman - that he’d never even learned her name - still, her face was so very familiar to him. The friendly face that appeared at the beginning of so many dreams and flashbacks and what ifs… It felt like seeing a childhood friend, or something.
And he thought… he knew that Steve had difficulty, saying the things he wasn’t sure of. But the things he
Tony woke up with a start, feeling as though he was right in the middle of something. It took him a second to work out that he’d been dreaming…
And Steve felt a very familiar headache start to build behind his eyes. A pressure, with an edge of frustration… The old battery of responses. Immediately feeling responsible for finding an answer. Then a stab of injustice that he should have to, an anger at the world for making it so hard… Then the sinking feeling of inadequacy, the kick of self-hatred for not being able to just step up to this… the rising fear, that he wouldn’t have anything to say, that he’d say the wrong thing and…and, then…
They weren’t all good minutes. In the four days since Steve left, Tony’s mood had bounced from extreme to extreme like an out of control rally car. Thoughts occurred to him like mental explosions, sudden and unpredictable, scattering ideas in all directions.
“Uh, no, not really,” he muttered, shyly.
Back to the real world.
He found himself piecing together the information he did have, mainly for the distraction of it.
The wordless way he called out, somewhere between joy and desperation
“Please fuck me Steve, please, I want you to fuck me, I want you, please, please”

“No, before Steve said that,” Nat laughed, “someone else said it.”

“I’d like that.”

miss those. It had taken far too much time and effort to get to this point. There was just too much on the line. And, logically, Tony knew it would bring him closer to Steve if he went to those meetings.
“Yes,” he admitted. “Although mostly because I’m curious.”
And sank his teeth into Steve’s throat.
“And I really
It wasn’t until he was standing under the spray, letting the warmth soak into his hair, that Steve finally bothered to ask himself what he was stalling
He noticed Steve seemed a bit more relaxed than he had, at least. And Tony realised… yeah, there was a niceness to this. Being able to talk in the abstract about the issues that were outside of all human experience, but somehow still part of their actual lives…
“Wow.” Tony gasped. “That’s strong.”
Steve melted against the sheets, letting it wash through him, soaking down into his bones. There was no resistance to it, no limit. He let himself stretch into it, his cock throbbing hard again as Tony began to move inside him.
He was too overwhelmed by the intoxicating

to understand that – he certainly didn’t want to pressure Tony, or make this all about himself, while Tony had so much personal stuff to work through. Steve wanted to help with that, not be an additional burden.
And, God, he really had never put himself in Steve’s shoes before, had he? Or, wait – he’d never put Steve in his. He’d never considered that Steve would think the way he did, do things for the same irrational, unhealthy reasons he did, sometimes…
… You keep eating the flowers.”
Hating that these were the first familiar words he’d heard in weeks.
Steve would’ve preferred it if Tony had said that he loved him, or said that he wanted it to happen again, or even that he’d like to keep seeing Steve, just see how it went.
And he carried on smiling, as he learned more banal facts about the lab work and test parameters and the process for separating plasma. Growing ever more confident of the objective, clinical nature of it - until, without even realising it, he was slotting everything into that scientific framework.
He was overwhelmed by the urge to touch him - fleetingly panicked that he might actually do it. Subconsciously, Steve tensed his arms at his sides, clenching his jaw so that nothing unfortunate could slip out.
A musical laugh broke free of Tony’s chest.
“Steve…” Tony purred, as Steve melted back into kissing him. There was the simple urge for
For anyone interested, this chapter does in fact mark the end of what I'd labelled 'part one' in the story plan -
By the time he reached the Sanctum Sanctorum he was breathless and weary, hardly even aware that he’d run there at full speed. His physical exhaustion seemed fitting, like it represented not only his final sprint, or even this epic mission, but the struggle of his entire life up until this point…

“Just as long as you know better than to try and keep me out of danger, or stop me doing stupid stuff, or to try being all protective of me.”

There was a pleasant lift in Bucky’s chest that made it all the way up into a smile.
“Nat has a team sweeping the building for the human staff – they’re going to be detained for further questioning” Rhodey explained in a slow, clear voice, and Tony could tell he was simplifying this for him, “Turns out that The Guardians have some experience in this part of the Galaxy – and Zan’s found a kindred spirit in Nebula…” He paused, briefly, a little flicker of thought behind his eyes… there was clearly more to

He’d wondered, more than once, how it would’ve felt if he’d managed to kill the Winter Solider before he’d realised who he was. He’d tried to imagine the awfulness of that moment, if he’d pulled back the mask and realised not only that Bucky was dead, but that

He’d visualised what would happen if he panicked, and got it wrong… He’d pictured it in such horrific detail that he was still getting occasional pangs of fear that maybe it had happened…
“Hm? Oh, because my other shirt got covered in pollen, and that wasn’t helping, apparently…” Steve remembered, pulling his collar away from his neck as he spoke. He’d managed to forget the lace shirt at some point in the last hour, and now it was itchy again.

Tony wasn’t mentioning it, why he wouldn’t meet Steve’s eye… And Steve could think of all sorts of things that he
He remembered the dizzy freedom of snapping, the absolute absence that swallowed him as he hit that guy…
Tony stared at him for a second.
And he just about caught the delighted little grin that broke through Steve’s serious expression, before Steve grabbed him by the hips and pulled him up off of his feet. Instinctively, Tony threw his arms around Steve’s neck, pulling himself up into Steve’s embrace and wrapping his legs around his waist. A jolt of friction shot up along Tony’s spine, sparking a flood of hot, tingling excitement-
Steve looked over to Tony, standing just behind him now. He saw Tony sigh in recognition, and then look over at the man with a faux-cheerful smile.
“Come to bed.”
Tony giggled again. And then mentally kicked himself.
“They?” Steve asked, glancing at Tony. Tony could only shrug, subtly – this was as far into the story as he and Zan had got.

Forcing a sigh, Steve threw himself down onto his bed and covered his face with his hands.
And he’d never dared to
For a moment, Tony was entirely surrendered to that feeling, unable to do anything but let it crash through him, his frame still steeled against the train of sensations-
…And, in that same moment, Steve realised the difference between Captain America’s objections, and his own.
“And you obviously have a problem with me going at all,” Tony observed, taking a lazy step into the room. All the hair on the back of Steve’s neck stood on end, his breathing overcoming every attempt he made to control it. All of a sudden he felt strangely

“I promise.”
And Steve’s voice must’ve sounded every bit as outraged as he felt, because an entirely different sort of silence fell over the group then - like everyone was afraid to breathe.
“I don’t get drunk at all ever” Steve answered easily, as the redhead knelt to drive the spikes into the floor, rooting the makeshift table in place.
He’d given up on trying not to be miserable and thrown himself into it.
Suspended for however long somewhere between consciousness and not, entirely at the mercy of the intense chaos of feeling that he’d fallen into.
“But, actually, I remember the first time I realised that I liked you, it was when you didn’t make a big deal about Bucky not wanting pain killers,” he carried on carefully, like a man walking a tightrope. “So, I mean, I don’t really know what’s weird or what isn’t, but, from my point of view… I met someone, I thought they were attractive, turned out I liked them. I mean…”
“Not really, but I trust you.”
And hope…
And then it was like he’d missed a second, and he found himself panting and lightheaded and weak, his limbs hanging as heavy, barely tethered parts, his weight resting gracelessly against Bucky’s chest. Bucky still had one arm across Steve’s stomach, saving him from falling forward… holding still, now. Waiting for Steve to catch his breath.
“But you didn’t, and no one is dead,” Rhodey reminded him.
, and…”
“Well, get in here then, and we’ll celebrate,” Pepper told him cheerfully, as the familiar shape of the Tower came at him out of the blur.
He barely broke the kiss as he guided Steve over to the bed, climbing onto it and guiding Steve to follow him. He could feel Steve smiling against his lips. Then Tony pressed the lightest touch to Steve’s shoulder, and Steve complied immediately, lying back against the sheets and looking up at Tony with those perfect ocean blue eyes…

He’d collaborated with Sam, and Nat…
He sat up, and ran his hands through his hair, and stretched. And listened. After a second or two of total silence, Tony felt sure that Steve was still sleeping. He wasn’t sure why he was relieved, but he was. It was only a few minutes alone with his thoughts… but he’d take it.

And felt all the strength just leak out of his body.
Maybe it was just that he’d been so overwhelmed by Tony, all this time.
Steve smiled, but didn’t say anything – by now, there were the sounds of other people, down past the end of the hall. So they carried on in silence, strolling through the foyer and down the main corridor, keeping up their pace until they’d reached the final room before the basement. Another ‘lounge’ by the looks of things… They both paused, as though they were considering whether to go in or turn back. Tony glanced at his watch.
“…Hi,” Tony answered, slightly hesitantly. Steve felt his heart stop in his chest, turning to look at Bucky – who was already standing, showing Steve his palms,

Bruce and Pepper both jerked awake, as everyone else flinched in unison. Rhodey and Sam began to shuffle away from the sound, to where the rest of the group was huddling closer together in the centre of the room. Tony only noticed the mirrored panel as it began to move, slowly sliding upwards, like the mystery-door on a cheesy game show… For a second, it seemed like there was only darkness behind it.

Tony could now add this to the growing list of life changing experiences. Talking to someone about the strangest parts of his life and feeling like they not only understood – but they’d actually been there themselves. Being
Whether it made sense or not, Tony just
“...I don’t know, I like myself more when I’m around you,” Steve muttered, like he hadn’t decided whether he wanted Tony to hear it.
Steve closed his eyes, and took a long, slow slip from the new glass.
Tony breathed a little laugh, and pitched his lips together, and dropped his eyes.
“So, what was the big mistake?” Tony asked, his voice numb and flat, his eyes still locked in the middle distance.
In fact, at the time, it had felt like a bit of a cop out - following a desire so small and simple, because thinking about what he really wanted, and what consequences really meant to him, had seemed too daunting a prospect.
And then Tony felt himself bite back a smile. It was like his body had the idea before it reached his head. His lungs felt tight, and his skin felt warm, even before he’d processed that mental picture…

… But I’m not sure a heist is a good place for me to be Hulking out. Especially since I don’t know how that works here. Apparently,” he shrugged, embarrassed. “It’s fine - I’ll try to cover for you and… Stay out of direct sunlight, I guess,” he gestured down to his robes again. Tony smiled at him, and then looked up at Bucky and Sam,
“I love you. So much,” he said again. Tony let himself indulge in this moment. For a few seconds, he just let Steve hold him, and simply felt the soft afterglow of this pleasure, and the warmth of affection and pride and love…
For a moment, his mind was quiet.
And then Tony’s hand curling under Steve’s shoulder, nails digging into Steve’s muscles, his other hand grabbing Steve roughly by the back of the neck. The solid pressure of Tony’s chest pressed hard against him. Tony used all of his strength to pull himself against Steve, grinding into him, forcing Steve’s head up so he could claim his mouth again. He kissed Steve like he was suffocating. Like he was trying to consume him. Steve felt his lungs burn and his head swim and didn’t think of the connection to breathing – he didn’t know he wasn’t. He’d forgotten he was supposed to.

“You glad we did this?” Steve whispered, stroking his hand over Tony’s arm.
There was the initial shock of recognising
But Steve was setting the pace now. He ran a slow, strong hand through Tony’s hair, tilting his head so that he could kiss him deeper. Tony moaned a soft surrender, melting into Steve’s embrace, calming to meet his rhythm.
Tony let out a sharp, startled cry, as the pleasure shot through his over sensitive limbs-

And then Tony threw his head back to gasp for air, never breaking his rhythm, and Steve looked up to see him bite his bottom lip in desperation, so openly and unashamedly lost to this sensation - so perfectly beautiful-
in a way that he’d never felt before, in a way he probably had no right to feel - but that he simply took for granted, at the time.

Tony stopped, and really thought about it. He wondered whether there really was a bright, hopeful spark of truth to that… or if he just really wanted there to be.

His elated smile quickly pinched into a thoughtful frown, as he tried to place that feeling of connection. And then he glanced at Steve, and found a similarly thoughtful look in his face.

“Yeah.”
For when he couldn’t see it anymore.
Tony pushed into him again, dropping his head so that Steve could feel the heat of his breath ghost over his neck as he pulled back.
Tony and Steve shared another glance.
The year that Tony spent thinking of Steve as someone honest, and compassionate… and a friend. Thinking that Steve was a terrible liar, thinking that it made him so uncomfortable. Thinking that Steve might be stubborn, and reactionary, and annoying as hell sometimes – but never that he couldn’t trust him. Never that he’d be that cold.
And then there was a sudden startled yelp from Tony, and a sharp intake of breath, as he flinched back into Steve’s arms.
“I’d like to offer you a job - a role on a very important project,” Nick smiled, knowingly.
That they were at least as close as Tony thought they were, even if they’d never be as close as he’d like – that their entire relationship wasn’t a lie. That Steve wouldn’t leave him out of something like that, that he would have trusted him with something like that – that he wouldn’t have let Tony tear himself in half for days, destroying everything he ever cared about, on only half the facts… That he

“…It just felt like, all this time I’d been thinking that we were… Something, at least. And then something important happens, and suddenly I’m just some guy you know. Someone you obviously didn’t want to hurt, because you don’t want to hurt anyone… but when someone you really loved was in trouble, it was going to be you and your

He kept his grip hard against Steve’s skin, holding him basically still as he ran the flat of his tongue over him again, slower and firmer this time, letting the tip of his tongue flit over Steve’s rim before he pulled back.

He’d spent the entire evening in his office, making sure all of his paperwork was up-to-date and getting a head start on next week’s workload. Wanting to make sure that he was as free as he could possibly be for their appointment tomorrow – that there would be no reason for someone to phone him, nothing he might be called back into the office to deal with… No reason for anyone to ask where he was on Friday night.
No, not if.
Somewhere, amongst all the shame and panic and adrenaline, it occurred to him…

Steve’s head swam, as some of that unbearable tension eased out of his chest. The next few breaths he took were cool, and slightly sweet. Everything slowed down just a little.

to forget that.
“Right, okay.” Steve answered on autopilot… and then Tony was moving again, and the door was opening, and Janine was back.
… He could swear it didn’t all sound so awkward and tacky, when he was thinking about it yesterday.
It was only at the very last moment that he remembered,
Oh, that meant it was time to be alone with Steve, didn’t it?
“Maybe they’re trying to turn us on each other,” he suggested, grumpily.
Steve knew those rosters well enough to be sure there was no ‘Natalie Rushman’ on shift today, either-
all the strange impulses that he’d been so worried about confronting… And he liked them.
“No, I know, mission. Important.” Steve agreed, wiping tears from his face.

Instinctively, Steve snuggled into it, leaning into Tony, kissing him deeper-
Still, Steve nervously catalogued his living room as Nick did, because there had been too few exceptions to that rule for it to be worth his time thinking about it -

He was vaguely surprised by just how quickly Steve melted under his palm; how completely his expression changed from fierce aggression to total trust.
They came to a pause after a few minutes, each of them breathing a little heavier under the baking heat of the sky. By now, the festival had simmered down to a low hum far behind them, and there was nothing to obstruct their view of the tower, directly ahead. The sheer size of the building and the lack of any visual context made it hard to judge from this distance, but Tony had to guess that they were at least a mile away.
“Oh, hey,” Rhodey greeted him. “This is Figaro - he was explaining the difference between a hallucination and a shift in your perception.”
Well, other than Clint, of course.
“And I already know that I am

off, thinking of an undead, unnatural creature in the middle of it.
In fact, as he shook himself out of his deep internal crisis, Steve decided that it was all far more complicated than he was capable of dealing with, right now.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony smiled, kindly, his eyes softening in concern.
“What? No, of course not,” Steve frowned – he couldn’t remember being mad at Bucky in the first place. Actually, he couldn’t remember much of the last twenty-four hours, now he came to think of it… He wasn’t even entirely sure how their last appointment ended. Everything became a bit of a haze, after ‘the event’.
“Ah, well, allow me to introduce you to the exciting world of box stuffing,” he joked, gesturing to the papers in front of him.
It wasn’t even that it corrected his previous thoughts… although it

“FOCUS!” Steve remembered suddenly.
Oh, this was going to be bad.

But, right now, it seemed so obvious what this was. He could just…
he opened the door. Maybe then he could have built up a defence. Reminded himself of all the things he’d spent years working out.
It took too long, and too much care, to lower it onto the table. And, as Steve was recognising that, it occurred to him that he wasn’t sure how his legs worked, either… That, if he had to follow Tony, he wasn’t sure…
- would’ve demanded to know where Tony had been all this time. Rhodey would’ve at least
That was as much cognitive input as he could manage, at the moment.
Tony let his shoulders slump. Okay.
Steve felt his stomach drop as he watched Tony slide his phone back into his pocket, his entire body tensing as he waited for Tony to look at him.
A high pitched shriek from the end of the road grabbed Steve’s attention, and he looked up in time to see an excited toddler bolting around the corner, several feet ahead of his harassed mother.
sent a perfect apology along with that phone… Sure, that might’ve helped matters. Maybe Tony would’ve called the phone, then. Maybe they’d have got to a conversation sooner. But it would still have left all of Tony’s insecurities and neurosis and anger under the surface, if he’d not been pushed to letting them all go like that. It would have left all of
Surrendering.
A giggle bubbled over Tony’s lips at that, and he rushed to reassure Steve,
“Jesus Christ my whole life just flashed before my eyes,” Rhodey panted, reaching over to snatch his keys out of the ignition. Tony just let him. He’d moved on from the ‘car’ part of this plan.
“What was weird was that it didn’t sound weird, at the time. It sounded

was looking for.
He was so engrossed in his thoughts that he’d completely forgotten what he was doing with his hands. Halfway through another worst case scenario, Steve was shocked back into reality by the tennis ball crashing through the tips of his spayed fingers, narrowly missing his head before it went flying into the gym equipment behind him. A shot of adrenaline jarred his spine straight, his jaw clenching as the bouncing came to a juddering stop and the ball rolled across the floor towards him.
There was a brief curl of embarrassment, acknowledging that it was probably because the files were falling into their natural position - that Howard wasn’t the reason this one was already on the top of the stack… But Steve’s anger was hot enough to swallow it up, burning it into fragments that became a part of his fury.
. This wasn’t a variable he had to work in or an element he had to alter or a collection of arguments he had to rethink. It wasn’t just an unexpected outcome to this equation – it was one that should’ve been impossible. Something that would require a comprehensive overhaul of his whole understanding of physics…
...Not to think about the fact that Tony had never shared that detail with him, in the first timeline.
He was only thinking about it now because the rolling news channel had lost his attention.
“Yes” He answered eventually.
“Uh, hi, Tony?”
It felt like being one shaky step from safety - the panic increasing as he edged ever nearer, the resolve building up in his shoulders as he prepared for the final leap.
He resolved to take a moment to acknowledge it, just as soon as he had one to spare-
Again, he smiled. There was a time when he might’ve rolled his eyes at a gesture like that, or simply failed to notice it - but he was also a lot less cynical these days. More open to the kindnesses of others, more willing to take them at face value…
escaping his throat as Tony scraped his nails over his skin, his head swimming as his entire body tensed down towards Tony’s hand.
And then, eventually, those thoughts had started to break down into words and sounds and…vague, disjointed concepts…and images…
The last thing he heard was Tony’s happy giggle, lulling him into sleep.
…Tony seemed to be convinced by it
Now he realised that he had been actively holding onto his anger and pain. That he hadn’t wanted to ‘get over it’, or ‘move on’. That he didn’t want any of it to be
But it did.
And there was Pepper.
The ache in his hips tightened, the edge of pain bleeding into his breathing now, a pleading tone to every little gasp. His fingers pressed hard into the blankets, his only outlet for any of this barely tolerable pressure. His cock throbbed sharply, leaking steadily against his stomach, dripping onto the blankets. It was the most basic human instinct that urged him, again and again, to touch himself, the way he would immediately press his hand to a burn-
“Don’t worry, you’ll have a great time” She spoke directly to Steve, her voice soft. And Steve didn’t answer her.
Steve smiled at him.
He looked up at Tony with wide, pleading eyes. Tony smiled back, his eyes warm and dark.
From the outside, it was entirely unremarkable. A large, blocky building, set in a vast concrete lot. It had modern widows and a newly installed glass entrance way, over which there was a shiny, corporate sign –
None of those reactions were rational, none of those thoughts made sense, nothing about himself was familiar… but he

, as Tony pulled his shorts down over his legs in one confident tug. There was an immediate, illicit thrill, as Steve felt the breeze run over his exposed skin. And then Tony’s hand against his chest, encouraging him to shuffle back, guiding Steve to lie down against the lounger so that he could climb over the top of him. Steve let his head fall back as he arced up into Tony again, one hand on Tony’s hip, urging him closer-
Retreating.
He liked that idea so very much – on every conceivable level. Logically, it made perfect sense, and instinctively it felt so right, and emotionally it made so much feel better…

And Dr Stape dropped his shoulders, and shrank away from them slightly, and looked at the floor.
And it was only when he felt everyone turn to look at him that Steve realised that he’d said that last one out loud.
His eyes snapped up to Nicks with all the passion and power of an animal focusing on its prey-
And then he heard Tony’s footsteps behind him. He felt the warmth in the air, as Tony stepped closer-

“Well, he and Bucky came over, because Bucky was getting some pains in his arm… It wasn’t even a scheduled appointment,” Tony noted – like that mattered. “And during the procedure something went wrong, and I ended up taking a blow to the face.”
Tony’s hastily calculated – and created – route through the building had proven pretty effective. He’d made it down the first flight of stairs in a few seconds flat, and without encountering a single staff member.
But… mostly, he just felt

Belatedly, Steve recognised that Tony was trying to undress him. The very last of his cognitive powers made a truly valiant attempt to pull together at this point, waving for Steve’s attention through the haze of lust-

Steve knew that Sam was aware of the atmosphere - and he did nothing to make it better.

Steve felt as though he’d spent an awfully long time thinking about his next trip. He certainly remembered staring at a vial of the Pym Particle for so long that his arm ached with the effort of holding it, while a queasy sort of adrenaline sloshed in his gut…
That if Tony were to just dedicate himself entirely to making Steve happy, and keeping Steve safe, and making sure that Steve had everything he wanted… that there really would be

The pang of guilt, for thinking any of that.
“Ah, rookie mistake” Tony noted. “See, he’s not taught the system the difference between his left and it’s left – and then, rather than correcting it, he’s obviously just adapted for it, which really isn’t the point of an AI” And then he caught Steve’s eye, and then he caught himself “

But Steve was still on that tightrope.

Steve swallowed roughly, sweat prickling his forehead and the small of his back as he made a genuine attempt to twist away. That time Tony had to tense his arms, the muscles in his shoulders rippling under his skin…

Tony was on his feet immediately, already scanning the room for threats. He knew he should call Steve before he opened the door, that literally anyone could be on the other side of it… But he also knew Steve was in the shower. Subconsciously, he knew better than to think too hard about Steve in the shower – which meant he couldn’t really evaluate whether it was best to drag him out of it…

“Yeah - I mean, either sounds good…” Steve replied, still answering on autopilot… his brow pinching in thought as he recognised the tense excitement simmering under Tony’s skin. Like there was something he wasn’t saying… “Why, are you hungry?”
Fuck, Tony, oh, oh Fuck-”
Trying to plan things he could say to Tony, ways he could respond to all the things that Tony might possibly ask.
Not tonight.

The morning after the night before, and something of a transition chapter for both of them - so, rest assured, this is more an indication of what they're each feeling RIGHT NOW, and does have a little bit of the 'unreliable narrator' to it... although the reality of their bond gets explored in more detail in the next few chapters ;-)

Steve threw his head back and screamed, one hand balling the bedsheets into a fist, the other frantically grabbing the back of Tony’s head.

As it was, Steve had been drawn into something far more childish and petulant - and,

And there were no more words after that. No more ideas. Just a burning, physical need that he could feel in every part of him, a total focus he’d never felt before in his life, a heightening of pleasure to almost frightening levels.
The tension spread into Tony’s shoulders, as he inched his way forward to peek around the edge of the dumpster - astonished to catch a glimpse of Sam disappearing around the corner of the building.

Steve shook the image away, and looked back at the computer, firmly asking himself if there was anything else he needed to do before he left. And his eyes fell on a little yellow post-it, cello-taped to the edge of the computer monitor.

“So, what’re the jars?” Steve asked, jerking his head towards the little display next to the sink. And, okay, it wasn’t the smoothest transition – but the question did seem to genuinely catch Tony’s attention, and draw them away from that moment, and screw it, that would do.

Tony had started out by gesturing towards the couches, and even made a token attempt at sitting down - but, of course, he could never stay still when he was explaining something.
There were times when Steve was especially pleased that he had a friend like Bucky.
Steve actually had to bite back a smile.
“Although, of course, you won’t be in any way obliged.”
So Steve just let Tony melt into him, not making Tony look at him again, not making Tony answer him-
Oh, fuck, this was all

In truth, Steve couldn’t muster more than an excited nervousness about the whole thing. He was already picturing Tony’s smile as he came to a polite stop at the glass partition, and raised his head to say hello to JARVIS-
“No, I want you to fuck me,” Steve answered, his voice rough and breathless.

He glanced up to find the bathrobe that Bucky had just thrown over him, and he smiled.
“Right,” Tony announced, determinedly.
Tony felt the oddest urge to smile at that. There was something…
to hold on to. He had no idea what he was expecting it to do. He had no clue what was behind his sudden inspiration that it might help – but something had to help. Because he was sliding into something truly awful with terrifying speed, and he just didn’t have time to think of anything else.
There was a cold kick in the pit of Tony’s stomach and a sour taste at the back of his throat.

There had been real points, at the heart of all that.
probably wait, until Tony had a chance to think it all through. But there were some things he just had to get out there, in whatever inarticulate, uncertain form…
“And it’s not only you that missed the nineties completely, and doesn’t really know what’s going on in the world these days,” Steve laughed. “And it isn’t only you who’s dealing with a body that doesn’t work like anyone else’s, and all those questions about the future side effects and how it’ll react in new situations and… all of that… And, okay, this is going to sound… But if we’re being really honest?”
And then he saw Tony bite his bottom lip, and was briefly distracted by how much he wanted to kiss him again…
Without another thought Tony wriggled his way out of Steve’s lap and onto the floor in front of him, kneeling between his legs. Steve had barely had the time to frown in confusion, before Tony dropped his head and slid Steve’s cock into his mouth.
of those things.
“What?” Steve blinked.
It took a lot of effort not to literally cringe, Steve was so uncomfortable saying that out loud. Immediately, he braced for a barrage of difficult questions or uncomfortable accusations… or, worst of all, for Tony to look at him like he was a would-be supervillain, or something.

He thought of all those days he’d spent anxiously glancing at his phone, rehearsing all the things he could say to Tony and thinking of all the ways he might be able to help and worrying about all the mistakes he might’ve made…
Maybe it was just that he was tired. An uncharacteristically sluggish mental calculation told him that he’d probably had about three hours sleep in the last two days - and he must’ve walked at least twenty miles that afternoon in laps around the workshop. Maybe he just wasn’t awake enough to muster that overwhelming, existential dread anymore.

He saw Steve try to sit up then, try to look him in the eye – and took a step closer, so that he
“Yeah, I’d love too,” Tony beamed. And Steve grinned back, and dropped his eyes, the colour spreading down his neck… And then he hummed a little smile to himself, like he’d thought of something amusing. “What?” Tony asked.
The thing Steve had always regretted most was the fact that he never

He didn’t allow any further arguments for why he should be allowed to think differently-
Steve would have to make his heart beat faster.

Steve felt his balls pull up tight into him, his hips tensing with painful speed as his something inside him simply gave way without warning, his climax crashing over him, breaking into the pleasure of Tony, still coming inside him.
“I… don’t even know him” Tony managed, with difficulty. “I couldn’t tell you anything about him. He just – stood there.”
Steve found himself blinking at it, his mind still scrabbling to make sense of this impossibility even as he assured himself it was real… It was even stranger, seeing it in a confined little space like this. Like an optical illusion brought to life.

He hadn’t realised it at the time, and he was only just working it out now… But every time Steve thought of himself in that timeline, worrying about Bucky’s recovery in Wakanda but never going to visit him, he could so clearly feel that fear. He recognised it now.

So, even though he still really wanted to laugh, Tony managed to steady himself and ask,

Occasionally, it still overwhelmed Steve that he and Tony could even discuss those things-
When Steve finally woke up the following afternoon, he actually felt worse – at least for the first hour.
Tony was still smiling as he replied,

For a moment they just stared at one another, and Steve wondered if he looked as moved and happy as Tony did… he felt it.
And then he blinked, and closed his mouth, and screwed his eyes shut, and gave his head a little shake.

Steve let his head fall into his hands. He was sure all of this felt much simpler at the time. He was pretty sure it actually felt… nice, at the time.

“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, on instinct. “This is… I’m being ridiculous…”
“Hey,” he slurred into the sheets instead, grinning when he heard Tony chuckle softly at him.
“Oh…” He whispered, leaning his weight into the desk again. Tony breathed a laugh.
He grabbed a washcloth and began to scrub harshly at his arms. He wished the soap at The Facility wasn’t so soft, he wished he had something harsh and abrasive, something that might leave his skin feeling dried out and raw. He wished he

“Hm? Oh, no. No... I’d never thought of that, actually…” Tony’s brow creased in concentration, his lips pursed just slightly, his ruminative expression exaggerated for comic effect…

He was aware that it put an additional, unspoken pressure on the both of them, that there was a chance it would make Tony feel uncomfortable - in an ideal world, he would have avoided all that.
Steve just laughed.
Worse even than the thought of never seeing Tony again was the thought that he’d be so casual about it, that he’d nonchalantly throw it out there as a bit of cheerful news – that he didn’t even look at Steve when he said it.

And Rhodey dissolved in front of him.
Tony had been forced to take a few moments to calm himself, all too aware of the thoughts he was trying to smother. There was maybe a second or two where he might have capitulated and found himself right back in the same toxic cycles again-
He’d never been more scared of losing him.
And all of that was just sounds in his head. Isolated sentences that drifted through his mind like clouds across a summer sky. Purely decorative elements, with no power to shape or define the mood he was in. He noted some of them, and ignored others, and felt nothing specific about anything-
– that trust he had in Tony. That complete faith that Tony saw who he was, behind whatever he was doing in any given moment. Steve
Tony couldn’t quite believe he was thinking this, after two and a half years of abject misery…
Steve sighed, and forcibly crashed that train of thought - mainly because he couldn’t bear to get his hopes up. Because it felt arrogant and ridiculous and embarrassing to be getting his hopes up, at a time like this.
Asking that question was simply something that he’d learned to do, something he associated with moments like these on a very basic level.
Dev smiled politely, and continued.
He was so used to people drawing parallels between him and his father, mostly forgetting that his mom had ever existed - it threw him to have someone remember his connection to his mother in the first place…
I hope you enjoy it!
, Steve’s passionate outburst had been about something else entirely. Maybe Steve had developed a crush on the idea of Tony, out of his own loneliness. Maybe he’d mistaken a sense of gratitude and relief over Bucky with a genuine affection. Maybe he was just attracted to Tony, or
Tony smiled at him, and glanced up at the flyer again… and didn’t leap in to say
“Not really, no.” He sighed. “And, as for what happens to anyone else…”

Steve clenched his jaw. He knew it would only add to this violent, painful fury, if he had to sit here and listen to this…
Just as quickly, Tony recognised that he was supposed to flinch from that.
He wanted to say,

And that Steve had already seen a whole lifetime ahead of them,
By now, there were a hundred questions clamouring for attention in Steve’s head, only some of which had actual words - and no answers.
Whatever this was, Tony actually felt a physical urge to flinch from it – the same primal reaction people have to spiders and wounds. He very nearly threw his hands up, the words ‘
But… Well, if he was going to just let these things come to him as they may… then fine. It

And Tony could tell that Steve was
“Oh, fuck, Tony,” he managed, although his throat felt so much rawer than he’d been expecting… Slowly, the details of his body came back to him. He began to recognise the specific limbs that were still throbbing with pleasure, and the muscles that ached with release…
This had always been the first place that came to mind when he thought about this task, the only part of the trip that he’d bothered to picture in advance…
So, he found the nearest empty couch and fell into it, tugging Tony onto his lap. Tony immediately wriggled closer, pinning Steve between his knees and grinding against him-
deep down, Steve did want someone to see it, to
“I… haven’t found that yet… But, yeah, you could do a lot of damage from here” Tony answered the real question. “If I wanted to, I could shut this place down right now, in any number of ways. I found the control for the power” He gave the file reader a little wave to demonstrate. “So, yeah, whatever Varian they’ve given access to this system – and they’ve really gone out of their way, to help some Varian access this system – then that Varian
And smile.
” Tony hissed, as Steve pressed his fingers to that same place - and then dragged a firm, slow touch right against that fault line. Tony’s balls tightened, his cock throbbing so hard that for one startled second the thought he might actually come. When his vision cleared, he found Steve watching his face with a passionate sort of focus, his eyes dark and his lips pursed in thought…
Steve could hardly bring himself to look. He was fighting the growing urge to scream at Adam to shut up – to just let him panic, right now. All traces of his earlier inebriation had completely evaporated under the white-hot fear coursing through him. This creep had the power to destroy

And, okay, that threw Steve a bit – but he was on a mission now, and determined to do his very best to meet every individual challenge.
And, to Steve’s credit, he’d accepted Tony’s apology for his ridiculous reaction, and had been good enough not to hold it against him.
Oh, this was
In a few moments of speed reading, he’d learned that the serum he took was entirely manufactured by SHIELD scientists, based on a few trace samples of what they believed was vampire blood, and a lot of theorising. The final product was also infused with Steve’s own blood, along with various other organic components, and quite a bit of iron-
And if Tony had met Steve in another life, one where he’d been
Tony barked, as Steve wrapped his fingers around his cock, his hips bucking from under him so sharply that it jolted his spine. And then he felt the slow drag of Steve’s palm over the length of him, and then the electric shock of his thumb running roughly over the head of his cock… and then, almost immediately, that low, urgent ache –
He could honestly say he hadn’t had a voyeurism kink before

Right now, everything just seemed to make sense-
There was the tell-tale, almost imperceptible dip in the pit of Tony’s stomach that let him know the jet had
Oh, and then an unsettling collection of images… little fragments of conversation that he wasn’t sure he wanted to thread together…
But then…two, three, four… okay, this was getting easier
The Red Skull smiled again - even more unsettling, now that there was just a hint of humanity in it. Steve thought of those magic eye puzzles that they used to print in the Sunday papers… He had the same feeling that he’d be able to find Johann Scmitt’s face staring back at him, if he squinted from just the right angle…
the idea… he just didn’t tend to think of it. Most of the staple escape fantasies of the 21
