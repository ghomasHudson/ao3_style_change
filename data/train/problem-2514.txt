John reached out and lifted the bottle, light as a feather now. He let the last of the wine trickle into his mouth, lukewarm and cloying.
It felt anything but.

He snorted.
“God, as much as I’d love to witness that absolute disaster, I’m not that cruel.”
Backspace.
The ghost of a smile flickers across John’s face while he barrels onward.
John smiled at the abrupt shift in his tone. Sherlock typically showed disdain for what he wanted most.
Sherlock swoops down to taste the sweat gathered at John’s hairline, rubbing his mouth over the damp spikes at his crown. John reaches up to grip the back of Sherlock’s neck, pressing into him possessively.
“I was actually thinking about letting him try and disentangle himself from that mess,” he said and felt buoyed by Sally’s wicked grin.

“Boring.”
“So?” John grunts out, biting down on Sherlock’s lower lip until Sherlock is sure he will die from it. He squeezes his eyes against the onslaught of teeth and slippery suction, giving in to John’s ministrations for a long, sloppy moment before gathering himself again.
Sherlock think he was struggling to type at all. Lest he think John cared one way or another.
He stayed there for a long while, losing track of time after call-outs for four nonfat lattes and a song that sounded like chattering teeth over an oboe solo.
John felt something go loose in his arms and legs. This was classic Sherlock—a near-compliment buried in a tangle of insults—but something about the phrasing was

odd. Almost affectionate. John shook it off. Trying to deduce Sherlock Holmes from a text message was a fool’s errand.
Sherlock trails his palm along John’s cheek and feels the muscles in John’s jaw jump. He open his mouth and traces the outermost whorl of John’s ear with his tongue and then exhales—”Ohhhhh”—cooling the damp path with his breath.
“Someone else is in love with Sherlock?”
In a swift mood change, Lord Holmes' gaze hardened into something coldly dangerous before he began to speak once more. "Your back is covered with injuries and bruising consistent with beatings, not just one, many over time. A family member then, someone you live with. You are an only child because if you had a sibling they would be with you, as you, John, are not a brother who would abandon a sibling. Your assailant is clearly an army man because your wounds and scars are consistent with military discipline, most notably the whipping." Again the cold blue eyes flashed dangerously. "A British military man living in Constantinople? He could only be living at the British embassy, most likely assigned to guard duty, because there are no British fighting forces stationed in Turkey at present. Since most of your neighbours and acquaintances have been unwilling to help you, your father holds an influential position, probably Head of the Guards then. Motherless because a mother typically would have tried to prevent a father from beating their child even if only in the child's younger years, which clearly didn't happen."
“It came about rather suddenly, Duchess, as the orphaning of children often does.” Sherlock’s voice held an almost imperceptible edge but enough to caution the Duchess against further prodding. “We are returning to London from the embassy.”
At luncheon, Hudson insisted that John should stop work and eat; even coercing his Lordship into eating something by informing him that John's manners were such that he would only feel comfortable lunching if Lord Holmes did so as well. Surprisingly, Lord Holmes complied without argument, taking distracted bites of a sandwich. John, feeling better by the hour, enjoyed a good meal. He then reluctantly agreed to Hudson's suggestion of a rest; Hudson pointedly ignoring Lord Holmes' frown, which was presumably due to the idea of John leaving him for part of the afternoon.
As John began to recover his senses the first thing he saw as he opened his eyes was Lord Holmes' startlingly bright gaze fixed upon his face. John stared back somewhat dazedly, not sure how long his fainting spell had lasted. A blanket had been placed over him and a glass of wine was sitting on a side table next to him.
John found it impossible to resist the grin that tugged at his lips as he bent once more to the task of translating the Latin before him. This time there was no hiding Hudson's smile as he quietly glided from the room.
“Take his hand Master John, while I cover him.  That will help to calm you both.” John was too distracted to notice anything remarkable about this statement. He simply grasped Sherlock’s cold hand in his own and, seeing Sherlock’s eyelids shutter at his touch, began to speak to him in a soothing tone while Hudson deftly wrapped all the bedding that was on the bed around Sherlock.
"Tea, your Lordship," said Hudson in a voice that brooked no argument.
"You do not need to concern yourself with that, Englishman! For you will not win!" the gang leader boasted. There was a swell of approval from his followers which he acknowledged with a bold grin. Turning to the man who had brought the knives, he said, "Antoine will announce when the match shall begin!" Then, in a show of mock courtesy he indicated to Sherlock that he should choose a knife first from where the weapons lay atop an upturned barrel.
And so the day wore on. By afternoon the small breeze had grown into a cutting wind which was followed shortly thereafter by a shower of cold rain. The dust on road they were treading turned quickly to mud.
John sucked in his breath in horror at Sherlock's announcement. "No!" he exclaimed.
"Thank you, Hudson." Sherlock said quietly, sounding almost himself once more as he straightened his jacket sleeves. He then strode over to John, who was still lying motionless where his attacker had left him, too weak to move beyond an attempt to cover himself where his trousers had been torn. Once he had understood he was no longer in danger he had focused his will on trying to regain enough strength to sit up but hadn’t quite managed it yet. As it turned out it wasn't necessary. He found his nakedness covered by Sherlock's seaman’s jacket and light fingers brushed his bruised forehead and cheek as Sherlock asked him urgently how badly hurt he was.  At this close proximity even in what little light there was, John could see the both shock and fear in Sherlock’s expression. John tried to reassure him by opening his mouth to speak, but his voice refused to function and no sound came.
John, still and somewhat pale, listened quietly and then glanced away briefly before looking up into Lord Holmes implacable face. He faltered a little, but he responded from his heart, "Please Lord Holmes, I would rather go with you. Take me with you! Please!"
Quietly but with a steady voice, Sherlock said, “Thank you John, once again for your excellent medical care.  I am extremely fortunate that you are here and that you possess the outstanding skills that you do.”
"I'm fine now, Sir... um Sherlock," he mumbled in desperation, "Thank you. I'm fine. Please let me go now." Sherlock complied immediately, although at a loss as to what had caused this sudden change in John.  John, his blood on fire and a rigid erection straining against his trousers, muttered, "Thank you," again and curled in a tight ball with his back to Sherlock, trying to control his ragged breathing.
Dinner was a pleasure such as John had never experienced. Lord Holmes was dressed in evening wear; his astonishing good looks highlighted by a white linen shirt−stiffly starched and wing collared−covered by a low-cut, white, silk waistcoat. The white shirt and vest were offset by a black bow tie and cut-away dress coat with a glacé silk collar and blue paisley silk lining, while diamond shirt studs and cuff links sparkled at his neck and wrists. His dark curls gleamed, only partially tamed despite his best efforts with his two ivory backed hair brushes. His liquid silver eyes were bright with interest and his conversation animated. John was transfixed at the sight of him.
One of the older men appeared to be the informal leader. He had a second-in-command; a stocky man with an aggressive demeanour who obviously relied on force more than intelligence to achieve what he wanted. He had a fondness for drink too, if the redness of his face and bleary eyes were any indication. The other four were young men and inexperienced soldiers, likely not long off the farm.
"But I thought you and she were… well…"
"It's near daylight, Master John, but the Captain isn't able to tell us where we are, the instruments smashed as they are from the boom hitting the wheelhouse. He thinks we've been blown back and have likely lost considerable distance.
She drew her nephew in with a gloved hand and said to Sherlock, “We couldn’t have been more delighted when we learned that you are aboard! Until now we were certain the trip to Ostend would be as dull as ditch water, weren’t we dearest nephew?”
John, basking in the affection and warmth that enveloped him, felt a little like the sea tortoises he'd seen on occasion by the shore of the Bosphorus; floating, suspended in the warm water, safely hidden in gently waving sea grass.  He let go of conscious thought and basked in physical and emotional bliss. Happiness and contentment flowed through him, warming every part of his body making him hum with pleasure and… what was that? Something else… Oh. Excitement. That kind of excitement.
“I’ve an idea Hudson, don’t worry about money. I think I can get what we need to take care of him.”
John obliged.  Now that Sherlock was treated and resting well, he felt weariness begin to creep up on him again.  He would have gratefully curled up in the room’s one chair but when he made a move toward it, as he had once before Sherlock put out a hand and drew him gently to the bed.
Lord Holmes greeted John with a pleased smile but immediately resumed his pacing. Taking the cup that Hudson pressed into his hand, he swallowed tea absently and said, "In fact, Hudson, I could use your assistance..." but stopped upon catching the long-suffering expression on his valet's face and exclaimed, "But I need an assistant!"
Lord Homes waved a hand airily and said, "You know I never eat while I'm on a case, Hudson."
“There appears to be a cave of sorts, just over there,” he said pointing.  “Perhaps just the spot to provide us with a little shelter for the night, Sir.”
John scrubbed a handful of dust, there was no shortage of it in their room, over his face and hair.  He then tied a strip of cloth around his head to hide any wayward blonde strands that still might be visible.  His trousers were filthy already so they didn’t need disguising and once he donned his old jacket he looked very much like the dirty street creature he intended.
By evening, those who were staying in the village to await the arrival of the weekly steamer had been settled comfortably as guests in village homes. With bedding retrieved from the Wind Shadow, Hudson prepared temporary sleeping quarters on a sheltered portico adjacent to the tiny village's main courtyard for  Sherlock, John and himself.
“Ready to start for England John?” Lord Holmes asked lightly.
Henderson nodded respectfully and made his departure. Lord Holmes turned to address John but at the sight of his young charge's face the words died on his tongue. "John, what is it?!" he grasped John's arm as he took in his ashen face and trembling hand.
“What’s up, mate? I appreciate the coffee and all but you look like a man with something on his mind.”
John had chosen well.  The man pocketed the brooch with one hand while, to John’s great relief, with the other he pulled a roll of bills from his tunic and pressed it into John’s hand in exchange.  Just a glance told John it was enough, of course nowhere near the brooch’s real value, but enough.  He pocketed the money, turned and slipped back the way he had come; except this time he plunged straight into the market itself, dodging people, donkeys, goats and tables laden with tobacco, tea, spices, cloth and dried goods. He had disappeared into the fray before anyone else had a chance to notice him, let alone try to follow him.
John tried to cooperate but by now was very weak and finding walking difficult, so their progress to the stern of the boat where Lord Holmes cabin evidently was, was slow. To John's humiliation, he required Hudson's support more than once, which was provided surprisingly gently, to prevent him from stumbling and falling.
“Indeed!” agreed Hudson.
“He is no worse Master John, holding his own, I should say. As he is asleep, you would have been unwise to do anything had you been awake anyway.  Drink your tea and eat a little food.  You may then tell me what is best to do for the Earl now.”
Then, when he saw his words were having little effect on John's terror, in a move that would have astounded his acquaintances, he drew John into his arms and eased them both backward to the cushioned sofa where he sat and pulled John, stiff with fear, onto his lap.
There was no mistaking the message behind this request and John hesitated. How could Lord Holmes have known that for John, the warm oblivion of the Mediterranean Sea was far preferable to returning to his former home?
Lord Holmes grinned in John's direction, "Young John, do not believe everything you hear, or see, for that matter." His tone was affectionate rather than condescending. "Lady Adler was in possession of information that my cousin Mycroft wished to obtain. At his behest, when presented with the opportunity to take it, I did. In fact, John you were a witness to the event. It was well done, if I do say so myself," Lord Homes said with another grin.
There were six soldiers in all. They surrounded the three travelers who had no choice but to surrender. They were searched and their knives confiscated before the soldiers turned and retraced the route by which they'd come; herding Hudson, Sherlock and John along the path in front of them. It soon became obvious why, for after about half an hour of walking, the trees thinned and the path opened up onto bare rock walled by sandstone cliffs. It was here, at a hastily erected camp, that the soldiers tied Sherlock, John and Hudson's hands behind their backs with rope and pushed them roughly to the ground to sit while they argued about what to do with the three of them.
“He hasn’t ever had a chance to be a boy, Hudson.  He should have that, and not be worried about looking after me.”
Lord Holmes looked startled, "Good God no, John. I despise the woman!"
They set out on their journey at dawn the next day. John was puzzled by the lack of a map, given that they were not familiar with the region, but Sherlock seemed to know the location of the path and the direction in which they should travel. It wasn't long before John realized to his amazement that Sherlock must have memorized the maps he had been studying prior to their rescue from the Wind Shadow. It was clear he did not intend to travel by the main roads for they kept to a narrow track wide enough only for foot traffic. John was oriented enough to know that they were heading south, which put them in the direction of Gelibolu.
His senses returning, John dazedly turned his head to follow the viciously snarling Sherlock. He couldn't see into the darkness but he could hear dull wet thuds, the sound of flesh hitting flesh and a terrified gurgle from the soldier which was cut-off abruptly so the only noise to be heard after that was the sound of fist meeting flesh and skull meeting stony ground...
Now − in contrast to his cool, pale appearance Sherlock Holmes had the sort of physique that continually radiated warm energy (which was the likely reason he shed excess clothing constantly and rarely felt the need for blankets or nightshirts…) so it was almost instantly that John's subconscious alerted him to unexpected warmth and comfort and he started to wake in confusion.
“Ah,” Greg said slowly, weariness creeping into his voice.
John nodded, speechless with relief to see him but at the same time alarmed to see blood streaming down the side of his face to beneath his slicker. "You're hurt!" he said gesturing for Lord Holmes to sit on the nearest bunk and reaching for the contents of the upset medical kit strewn on the floor.
Just as John was able to gain his footing, the door was flung open and Lord Holmes strode in, looking anxiously around the sick bay, apparently for John because when he saw him, his expression eased and he asked, "All right here?"
The couple was not aware that a sandy haired youth, to all appearances just a boy, was perched silently above the arbour in one of the many ornamental cedars that surrounded the garden, listening to the exchange below. John, the observer in the tree, hadn't intended to eavesdrop. He often came to this place to think when he needed peace and quiet. The scent of the ever-blooming roses soothed him; reminding him of his mother, now long dead. He was not accustomed to company.
Hudson turned as well and brows drawn, both of them faced John with the same perplexed expression.
Sherlock considered what he had learned. Escape from a small band of six would be easier than if their captors had been a full unit of soldiers, but with nothing to lose these men were more dangerous than regular troops. He, Hudson and John would be kept alive only until their captors were certain that the three of them were traveling alone and had no companions to search for them should they be discovered missing. Under the circumstances, he, John and Hudson would have to escape soon. In their favour, dusk was approaching and darkness increased their chances of success.
The three were well into the town before at last they came upon a visibly lit building. Hudson, wasting no time, thumped on the door of what a sign proclaimed to be a Traveller’s Inn. It appeared decrepit and shabby even in the dim light cast by a lamp burning over the entrance but they were not in a position to be choosy about accommodations. John, almost collapsing under the weight of Sherlock who was breathing with exertion and leaning heavily against him, hovered in the shadows while Hudson, the only member of their party not stained with blood, negotiated a room from the half-asleep proprietor who appeared in answer to their knock.  The groggy innkeeper, reassured of Hudson’s legitimacy by the obvious quality of his seaman’s uniform, handed over a key in exchange for some coins without question. He gestured down a hallway before ascending the stairs heavily and retiring again to bed without a backward glance at his late night guest.
"If you are careful John, this is enough for three days, long enough to get you to Athens," she whispered. Then overwhelmed, she choked, "Are you sure John? Maybe this isn't a good idea. What if you're caught? It might be even worse than…" at this she trailed off.
John himself did not have the option of evening wear but he was scrubbed clean, his hair neatly barbered by Hudson and although he was painfully thin and his leg and back clearly stiff, his tanned cheeks and sun-lightened hair gave him an adventurous air. His deep, blue eyes shone with happiness and his manners, Hudson observed, were faultless.
At the sight of John's stubborn expression, Lord Holmes cast a look of appeal in Hudson's direction, who came to his aid by saying, "John, if you would, I'll need your help below, we have what appears to be a broken arm and a concussion among the crew members…"
Sherlock merely replaced John’s blankets, tucking them around him and, with a light stroke of John's hair, sat back to wait out the darkness of the night. The blanket tucking and the hair stroking, of course, set off another firestorm of glorious physical sensation in John and he bit his lip in an effort not to turn over with a needy moan and spread himself out before Sherlock.  Good Lord!  What in heaven’s name was happening to him?
This is a short chapter but I'm easing back into the story starting with small steps.
John’s next awareness was of being passed from Sherlock’s arms to Hudson’s.  He struggled to right himself, mumbling, only half awake, that he intended to stand and walk.
1876 Constantinople, Turkey
Forcing down his panic, knowing that he must think and act quickly to save himself, he had limped out of their quarters and into the dark garden to try to clear his mind. Standing in the still night air he could hear distant music and laughter from the embassy's ballroom and remembered Molly's recounting of Lord Holmes' visit. He recalled her laughing at how the female guests were interested in Lord Holmes himself while the men were far more interested in the yacht on which Lord Holmes had arrived. The Wind Shadow was said to be the fastest and most modern in design of any of its class in the Empire. Speculation was that it could reach England in seven days from Constantinople, an un-heard-of time for private yachts. Remembering this, the seeds of John's escape plan were sown. It was simple enough, although risky; all he had to ascertain was when the boat would be embarking on her homeward journey and to ensure he was aboard when she did. He would start his information gathering with Molly.
What he had not expected was this: a mistake with his credit card, a lost reservation, and an expensive taxi ride miles away from the post-conference action to a
“This is what passes for hard journalism nowadays? I weep for the future.” Sherlock snorts, sinking back down onto the couch and wrapping himself up in his dressing gown. He narrows his eyes at John. “And you find this interesting, do you?”
John felt his heart squeeze
Sherlock lets out a slow breath, unsteady but focused. He lays his hands on top of the pile, trails his fingers gently across the surfaces of the albums, feeling the tips bump and drag against angled edges and smooth planes. He pulls out a CD, the first that feels…. right… and sits back on his heels again, flipping the case over to read the song titles.
That gave him pause, too.
“Crime scene, actually,” Sherlock cut in. “Strangest thing. A friend of Molly’s, and–”
The sound echoes against John’s ear and John jerks his head away. “Sherlock,” he whispers, his voice hoarse, dark. “Stop. Please, stop saying it.”

John smiled down at the phone as if Sherlock could see him.
Focus.
But John cut him off by pressing his lips to Sherlock’s mouth, filling Sherlock’s air with the scent of cider and chips and breathing in Sherlock’s smoky exhale. Sherlock didn’t make a noise, exactly. He simply shifted the molecules around his breath, making them hum almost imperceptibly against the thin, firm line of John’s mouth. John filed that away as a whimper and pressed him more tightly against the bricks. As Sherlock’s not-noise lifted in scale, John prised his mouth apart with his tongue, licking the inside of his upper lip and sucking it into his mouth. He bit down gently and then, as Sherlock began to relax into the kiss, not as gently, and John felt Sherlock wobble against the wall behind him.
The lovely woman in the beans aisle walks away when he barks out an unexpected laugh and closes his eyes at the hopeless insanity of his situation. He has no idea what to do. He’s already, unconsciously, made a first move. And then left before sorting it out. In fact, he’s likely made an awful, irrevocable mess of

Typically, he finds the narrowing-down process quickens with a surfeit of information, but in this particular case, each component seems to take the experiment in a different direction, moving him farther away from the original design.

John relaxed back into the soft bed, hearing the springs creak gently under his shifting weight.
“That’s great,” he said, nodding, “Great. I’m happy for you. Where did you meet h–”
“Mmmm?”
, he mused.
John huffed.
“For fuck’s sake, Sherlock.”
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He closes his eyes again and imagines a crime scene.
John laughed out loud at this, too, missing London—missing
“Two,” John insists and walks (quite stiffly, Sherlock notes with satisfaction) to the cupboard to pull out their mugs.
Sherlock narrows his eyes. There’s something else going on here—John’s too-smug smile doesn’t match the strange unease flitting just beneath the surface of his expression. Sherlock looks him over quickly.
“You see, John?” Sherlock leans back in his chair. “You already understand!”
John grinned.
” Sherlock began again, and John started to stroke. “
John ran a hand through his hair, riled up in that particular way that only Sherlock could stimulate. Frustrated, climbing the walls, and yet completely

shifts.
John barely recognized the high, incredulous laughter as his own.
It was a nasty row in that it had been no row at all, just Sherlock leaving quietly, closing the door behind him without a fuss. And then John, buoyed by mortification and self-righteous anger, had played the coward to the letter, pointedly ignoring Sherlock all week and then moving out whilst he was a week in Dover on a paid mission for Mycroft.
John blew on the surface of his tea, pretending to focus on the cooling-down process so he could avoid Sherlock’s gaze.
“I suppose that’s right,” John says carefully.
“And I'll tell you everything I've not said over the phone.”

“What would we talk about?”
Sherlock was blissfully silent
“For me to...?”
John stares at him blankly, and Sherlock sighs. He knows he’s close to solving the problem. It’s the same way with any deduction, really, if a bit closer to home. He senses the space around the clue vibrating like a violin string, beating against the air molecules and disturbing them with quiet currents, circling outward from the problem. He doesn’t know what he is going to find, but he is compelled to search for it all the same.
Then Sherlock is lost, he’s swallowed alive in a tumult of John’s mouth and tongue, John’s breath heavy against his teeth, John pressed against his knee, John with clumsy fingers in his hair, John, John, John—
nervous – and he was disgusted with himself for it. Of course Sherlock would hear the waver in his voice. It was clear even over the high squeal of the steamers and the hollow clop of metal mugs against the countertop – baristas coaxing the bubbles from freshly frothed milk.
John made an involuntary noise.
—by kissing him fiercely, licking John’s mouth open and devouring him from the inside out. He holds John’s face against his, rocks against John’s groin until John’s fingers fumble against Sherlock’s belt loops. John runs his hands down the soft charcoal wool of Sherlock’s trousers, and Sherlock feels the damp heat left behind by his fingers.
, he replied, all coyness gone.
John thought he could feel Sherlock curling into the compliment, even across the miles.
“Of course you can understand, John. Words are powerful. They inspire, they galvanize, they can overcome. Writing them, reading them, speaking them, hearing them. They’ve more weight than even weapons. Anyone can understand that.”
“Ohh!” Sherlock moans. He’s not playacting, not anymore.
“John,” he calls through the open door. “Throw on a few rashers, too!”
Three dots danced in response almost immediately and relief coursed over John.
He was somehow a quiet night at home and full-tilt danger in one sharp rectangle and John’s breath caught. Sherlock looked slim as a rail, the rolled cuff of his
John shifts in his chair, doesn’t look at Sherlock. “It was just the first thing—”
Sherlock moves his head infinitesimally closer to John’s but still not close enough to touch. He inhales silently, holding the breath for a long count of three, and then exhales, flooding the single word with something close to reverence, “Ohhh.”

And Sherlock had just watched him, still as a statue. His narrow features were smooth, unreadable as he watched John Watson leave the flat in a flurry of nerves and stumbling footfalls and jangling keys. The last glimpse he’d had inside the flat was of Sherlock, swathed in eighteen million metres of smoky Moroccan silk, staring back with his uncanny, heterochromic eyes.
“I do,” John says, his dark blue eyes reassuring. “But, next time—”
He’d have to alter his ways, rethink everything he knew. All his best, most recent lines had to do with soft curves and cuppable breasts, or with delicate fingers

“It is to some,” John says mildly, not looking up.
Sherlock is drying his fingers one by one on a dish towel when the sound of John’s movements from the next room halt altogether and his voice drifts in through the open door.
John thought.
John leaned forward even more, pressing himself between Sherlock’s legs and placing his mouth against the rather prominent bulge in Sherlock’s trousers. He breathed out wetly, letting the heat from his mouth warm the wool at Sherlock’s groin and he closed his eyes as Sherlock’s hands reached down and wound into the short hair at the nape of John’s neck. They stood like that for a moment, John pressed obscenely into Sherlock’s crotch, Sherlock stroking John’s hair like a bedtime ritual. Then John broke the spell, reaching up to unzip Sherlock’s flies, folding aside wool and cotton to find the silk of Sherlock’s bare skin, warm and flushed. John had barely touched him and already Sherlock was beginning to leak, the scent acrid and powerful in the thin, cold air. John ground his knees into the plush coat beneath him, determined somehow that whatever shared or recycled energy made up this coat—John sent furious apologies to the cosmos for this admission—would somehow transmit their shared desire to its former owner, that somehow Victor would know that the man he desired and the man John loved was about to lose his fucking mind in the back alley of a North London pub thanks to John’s talented mouth.

he wanted to ask.
“He’s not...he isn’t…” John sputtered, unsure which accusation he should attack first. Then shoulders slumped. “He doesn’t look too miserable about it either way,” he muttered.
Sherlock looked down at their entwined fingers for a long moment. Then he untangled his hand. “I have to make a phone call.”
“Is it a case? Have you found us—”
“Have you.” It was not a question. John answered it anyway.

When no response seemed forthcoming, he chanced a look in Sherlock’s direction and regretted it at once.

John was just eyeing the soggy but legible Telegraph in desperation when his phone pinged. He lunged for it with gratitude.

Sherlock steeples his fingers under his nose and closes his eyes against the weak winter light threading through the curtains. He’s working on a problem. There is something the matter with John. His moods have been darker throughout the past several weeks, his temper flaring more frequently. A snarl of anger and then, just as quickly, a friendly elbow jab to Sherlock’s side—high Watsonian praise—or the brilliant flash of a smile for the simplest deduction. Sherlock tries to loop his mind around the problem, lassoing one idea fragment before it can connect to another, before the two can dissolve into one another and re-form as something new. He plays through this kaleidoscopic mind game for several moments without interruption.
John’s not truly angry, Sherlock knows. When John’s angry, he appears his most cheerful—mouth stretched into a grim reaper smile, teeth bared—all the while his posture threatens, ‘go on, then.’ Presently, though, John is muttering and clearing his throat in a forceful, familiar vocal pattern,
John returned to the call and pressed the phone against his ear to hear quiet breathing on the other end, intimate in a way that clutched at his heart. Sherlock was
He open his eyes, pushes through the piles with spread-apart fingers, trying to touch all the covers at once, as if the tactile alone will be enough to guide him. The images are a blur, the chatter and slide of cardboard and plastic against the thinning pile of carpet anything but a soothing melody. He draws his attention inward, looking for a hook, an obvious opening point, a
Sherlock nods stiffly.
“Oh!” He alters the vowel sound, running his open mouth along John’s neck as he does so. “Ohhh!”
The wind was bracing but John didn’t mind. Between his cider swagger and the warmth of wool swaddling his shoulders, he was perfectly suited to the cold.
John sat back down in his chair again, boneless. He gazed into the muddy liquid in his mug for a long moment before pushing it away.
With that, Sherlock slips by him, barely glancing down to see John running his thumb over the CD cover in amazement. Gold constellations winking out against a midnight sky and the title, in Sherlock’s handwriting, so damning, so
“Sherlock, look. I’m sorry. I am.”
No dots.
John thinks for a long moment. Sherlock’s impatience rises at once.
ether. The insects chirped on steadily outside, paying no mind to the monumental change that was taking place in the room beside them.
Together, they walked back into Gerrard’s to say their goodnights.
Sherlock swivels and sits up on the couch in one elegant motion, his elbows resting on his open knees, and leans toward John like a cobra ready to strike. His next words are meant as a reward for John’s candor, and he wants to see John recognize this. “Would you like to understand?”
“Accurate?”
Sherlock had always imagined his heart was a stone, but he was so, so wrong.
“Is he calling you often?”
“It’s cotton,” William says. “Cold water. Rinse it out.”
"I don't know if I want to hear any of it."
She blinks and her uni-brow furrows in confusion. "Yes. I was told to give you this letter."
“Most certainly, Sophy Kratides planted the others. I had the flat cleaned, and she’s managed to put in new ones. I will cut to the chase. I need help finding her connection to Pandora,” Mycroft says. “I also need you to remember the sequence key, but since that portion of your memory may never return, we must, in your own words, ‘deduce what happened using the evidence provided.’”
When I told Mike her idea, he reminded me of my need for a flatmate. I wondered why I hadn’t thought of it!
John nodded, watching the pen.
“He was in disguise.” Sherlock smiles, raising an eyebrow.
He’s not sure who this Errol Flynn is but that’s more like it! What an exciting way to carry cyanide! His head hurts so much right now, he’d take it...and Sherlock seems to remember something about the sword. He needs more.
He raises his eyebrow. “Get me your driver. I need to meet with Lord Blackwood.”
Did nothing impress him?
“I believe it’s about our … past.”
“My brother is a complicated man,” Mycroft continues. “He can project what he wants others to see. Be certain before you continue that you understand what he really is.”
Sherlock carefully slips his empty thermos into the small knapsack he carries for water and first-aid supplies. He always comes prepared on their excursions.
"Thank you!"
Will sits in the passenger seat and says nothing except hello the whole ride to hospital, his eyes scanning the streets as if he’s never seen them. It’s a bit odd. Molly and Mike politely try to include him, but all they get are grunts and nods. John almost decides to tell them about the run in yesterday with the three thugs to draw Will into the conversation, but doesn’t. The telling would sound a bit boastful. It’s just not him. It’s a tale best told over poker and a few pints. It occurs to John that Will’s been preoccupied since they’d left the flat. What if he’d found something on the internet? He glances over again. Will’s fingers are steepled under his chin and his eyes are no longer tracking the store fronts.
One other bit of trivia on this blizzard, I picked the radio station
The phone broke John's concentration, and Sherlock noticed how John raised an eyebrow as Sherlock uncharacteristically raced to pick up the phone.
“Boo, hoo! I’m gonna make little man cry.”
“I was impressed how she kept her act up until the end in her husband’s arms,” she says. “Even to you.”
“My name’s Mary Morstan. And you’re John Watson. I’ve been expecting you,” she said. “You look chilled to the bone.”
"If he's asleep, why isn't he in his room?"
Nothing mattered now except what would happen next. The faint silhouette of another man came into shape before his eyes. Was it the devil actually coming to life? No! He wasn't the one. Sherlock ducked behind a tree.
“Oi! That’s rude!” John blurts out. “I’ll have you know plenty’s happened in this room.”
“So it was. I’ll let you rest then. Nurses are here. The call button is next to you.”
I glared even harder at Sherlock. Always keeping something from me. He knew why she'd shut the door. In fact, I was certain he'd expected it. And that made two people tonight who were reacting oddly.
“I don’t know how he feels.”
“I don’t see the connection,” John says, looking to me for answers as well. “What does this poem have to do with a superhero?” John frowns. “Unless it’s a reference to you.”
“I don’t believe I recall that name, but I am rather bad at names, but the affection in your voice tells me that he’s your brother.”
Sherlock feels a rub against his leg and John jumps. “That’s…Blackbeard.”
Sherlock shakes his head but stops when he catches John’s disapproving eyes.
“If I did tease him to that extent, it’s common knowledge. You need something only a few might know. Someone who knew him well.”
Sherlock’s eyes grew wide as James clapped his hands and bounced with sheer joy at the prospect of his possible demise.
A year and three days later, someone posts the bottle to them. The same "please forward note inside to Sherlock Holmes, 221B Baker Street, London" is printed neatly with the same nub of a pencil. The same yellowed notebook paper is used, but the letter inside is very different:
The need to eat is literal and metaphorical for John. He needs sustenance; John must feed his transport along with his mind like any BAMF. If he doesn’t, he pays. Hence literally he needs to go home and eat dinner, but he’s also turning toward his metaphoric nourishment: home and blog.
John scowls at me. Mycroft raises an eyebrow.
He ignored me.
“The very question I asked myself. What is the answer, Lt. Lestrade?”
“I’m a Pepper” T-shirts. I actually had one. Image of what it looked like is here:
John quit watching the pen and studied the man’s face. If the man was lying, he was an incredibly gifted actor.
“I only read parts. That’s why you’re preoccupied right now. I must say, that I was very tempted to read it all.”
John sighed. “You’re right. He lied to me about something serious. I don’t think I can trust him. I’ll probably have to find another roommate.”
“No need to do that. He seems to be getting on with Greg. Better than—”
--------------------
"Um...Otter Valley." John squirms under him and twists his body trying to get free, yet not enough to throw Sherlock off.
“Find anything that interests you in our research?” he asks.
, he thinks, then shakes his head to clear it.
“If you hadn’t noticed, I haven’t been able to articulate much until now. At least it’s not your oatmeal jumper.”
“Bravo.” Sherlock voice cracks as he says it. He closes his eyes as his throat spasms.
The paramedic hushes her, then applies pressure. She hisses back at him.
John sighed. “You’re right.”
upset my cat!” Sherlock adds. John looks over to see Sherlock on the floor coaxing the cat out from under a table.
I step into the bedroom. The father’s body is face down. “No, this is not an abduction.”
“That must have been difficult,” John says.
This had to be the worst date he’d ever had. What kind of a date drugged you? This was worse than that blind date that Mike’s brother fixed John up with. What was her name? She smelled like cheese and wanted John to stop and buy 9-volt batteries for her transistor radio because she couldn’t miss Elton John’s interview on WJAR.
I sit back and stare into John’s eyes. “They’d planned it out—or at least they were led to believe it was their plan.”
"And what did James have to say today to you?" Sherlock raised an eyebrow, as he unwrapped the sandwich, then licked dressing off that had dripped onto his fingers.
"Anything for you, John." He unscrews the top then hands John a bottle of water before rummaging around in a med kit to find some tablets. He rips the foil open with his teeth and hands them both to John. Sherlock watches him as he's taking them as if he has never seen anyone take meds in his life.
“Is that why you stayed? Wanted to keep an eye on him so he didn’t nick something else from the stores? You were our special task force in charge of finding the locker bandit, I’d think you would want to hand him over.”
John should be checking the note soon. His trust in John finding it is steadfast. He expects his mobile to vibrate with a message from John or Mycroft at any time. He imagines Mycroft’s irritation when he finds Sherlock has gone off to meet Sophy on his own. Sherlock feels that satisfaction again. Maybe it’s because he recalls Mycroft always trying to steal his thunder as a child, or how he lost a sense of trust in his older brother when Mycroft abandoned him when he left for university.
John ignores Sherlock, turning to Mycroft. “How do you propose we do all that you suggested?” John asks.
John scrambles for his service revolver under the bed and makes sure it’s loaded with proper bullets this time.
I know there is nothing that will ever alter the past or my past actions. I can never undo those years that John believed I was dead, nor my arrogant barbs that drove Vivian Norbury to shoot at me. Whatever message Eurus has sent in my paper heart, it has to do with that day at the aquarium, and the only way to find the solution is to speak to the source. The outcome would illuminate her purpose as either benevolent or malevolent.
Sherlock pulls on his wrist, an invitation to his lips. Although it’s not quite mollified his own doubts, his lips are pretty confident. Eager even. To kiss him. John licks his own in anticipation. John leans closer, enough that Sherlock can feel the flush of his breath against the heat-soaked skin on his neck. John’s eyes flicker to Sherlock’s mouth. Invitation taken, mouths connect. Sherlock’s not sure whose groan is louder, but combined they get Mrs. Hudson’s attention.
John continued to talk to Sherlock. He probably didn't hear a thing, but he felt he needed to say it. "I need this job. Besides I already called Seb Moran and told him I'd take it. I'll be working with him most anyway. I'm meeting Moran at eight tomorrow morning in the quad."
“He’s in,” John says. Anthea nods. They watch the blinking red dot together move around what must be the top floor, then after a time, he seems to leave. They hear ding of an elevator bell and swish of its door, then it opens. The sound of Sherlock’s feet. He’s moving fast. John knows something is wrong. Then an alarm rings. He hears Lestrade’s voice say, “He’s on camera.”
The barrel bit into his temple as Moran continued to nudge it against his skull. Moran snarled at John, and John snarled back.
“I’m glad when you had the repairs done on the flat you and Mrs. Hudson decided on using these refurbished windows. Are you sure you’re okay?” John asks.
Sherlock also suspected that Mycroft had the room bugged—not that he'd reveal that bit of information to John. As soon as John left for his next class, Sherlock planned to scour the room for them.
His funeral was a blur—too many people yet not enough. Although almost all of Scotland Yard and Bart’s attended, I felt alone. Molly tried her best to comfort me, and Lestrade kept his hand on my shoulder at the graveside. Mycroft actually said a few kind words about John: his strength of character, his dedication, but I … I couldn’t. What I had to say to John was far too private for public ears.
"True. But I haven't now. You are merely exhausted from the trauma and still dehydrated. You lost a lot of blood. Your immune system has been taxed. You know as well as I that if I gave you something in those pills it would take more than a few minutes to take effect. Lie back and let the paracetamol work."
“We never truly know what another person thinks—what makes a person feel so low, that they only see death as the answer.”
Sherlock immediately drops to the floor, kneeling next to John. The luger still in Sherlock’s hand, is now trained on Sophy.
Sherlock can’t help but touch John’s body. It keeps his mind off the panic he feels within. He lets his long fingers distract him as he explores the curve of John’s back, the pivot of his neck. John laps a path down the center Sherlock’s chest then veers off to suck at his nipples. He keeps his tongue flat with every rough-tongued lick.
"He threatened me. I still have every letter. His fantasies became so dark that I finally reached out to that brother of his in the government for help. I was shocked when he told me what Sherlock had told him! That I," Moriarty said, pressing his hand to his chest and waving the pen above his head like a wand with the other, "am some sort of psychopath trying to win him over by murdering innocent people."
She takes a deep breath and looks directly at Sherlock. “He said you should call me Ruth.”
Not long after Anthea leaves, the third and final body of the day comes in. A stab wound. And Sherlock recognizes the victim as a homeless man he knew from his early days on the streets. He shared some bread with Sherlock. And a cigarette. He’d told Sherlock off-color jokes.
John sighs and looks at me.
“I’m taking advantage! You have a brain injury!” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You are not taking advantage. Despite my injury, I do understand what I’m doing.”
“John! I know this is important. The apple barrels. The mutiny.”
remembered," Sherlock says. "Everything. It’s most disturbing.”
Sherlock peers under his arm at John as he turns over. John reaches for his night table and pulls out some lube and a condom. Sherlock heart races. Not again.
Anthea crosses her arms. “He has two legs. No parrot. He does have a mole on his right buttocks.”
Sherlock smirked as he poured the hot water over the teabag into his tin cup.
"Are those the files Stephanie gave you?" Moriarty asked.
I remember Vivian’s words to Mary—that she and Mary were alike, that all they both wanted was a family and a little peace. But that’s not all either of them wanted. I wonder if those were her words, or if someone else put them there.
“All in good time.”
“It could,” Sherlock says. “It’s ‘we’ then. How shall
John looked around as she busied herself pouring the coffee in her make-shift kitchen on top of a counter of milk crates and plywood. She had a collection of posters lining the walls. “Keep on Truckin’” joined with a large collection of felt Peanuts banners, including Snoopy sitting on top of his doghouse shouting, “Curse you, Red Baron!”
He had to admit that he did think about sex a lot, but probably not every seven seconds. He wasn't sure how often other people thought about sex since it's not something people went around asking. He wouldn’t casually turn to Molly in Biology class and say, "Hey, Moll, how often do you think about the horizontal mambo?" He supposed he could ask Sherlock. It might even result in actual sex, which is a lot better thinking about it.
"Yes, but it's not a usual occurrence. Unusual actually."
Prone or not, looking down on people is what John suspects Mycroft does most of the time.
“Good. I’ll walk you then.”
“You said you don’t remember who you are, but do you remember anything prior to the injury? Anything at all about your life?”
“Well, you do have the right shaped eyes for it. The eye shadow is a bit much though.”
Even as Sherlock said those hurtful words to Sophy, John knew there’s a bit of truth in them. After all, Sherlock told him the most believable lies have a hint of truth behind them. And maybe he does follow Sherlock around a bit like a lapdog, but the man needs taking care of. God knows Sherlock won’t do it himself.
He wonders if he could experiment on live subjects. John would be disappointed. Even if he decides not to help her, there are others who will if he does not. But Sophy wants the sure thing: someone who can.
Fortunately, his roommate didn’t seem to have much, other than clothes and books. Lots of books. The guy didn’t seem to mind much taking the upper bunk, though. He'd said he preferred it after the toss. If these first few days were any indication, his roommate wouldn’t be sleeping in it much anyway. John wasn't even sure that his roommate ever slept.
“Percy Shelley.”
“John brought
“You mum’s?”
He was stepping backwards and shaking his head. So Sherlock wasn't the only one feeling a bit on edge. Something had brought the two of them there, and it wasn’t just that note on the wall.
He steps out of the room and doesn’t even hide that he’s in the hallway. No need. He does hide his limp, however. The man “guarding” his door smirks at Sherlock and lets him back into his bedroom. Sherlock shuts the door, then reaches into this pocket for his cell and begins to text John again.
“You, Mr. Hawkins, need a good spanking.”
"A bit."
“Careful, it’s a high explosive. Detonation will be rather messy,” she said, tapping the pen on the pad again.
"We don't need to," Sherlock says, and hugs him tighter. "We're taking
“I’d rather be this lead pipe or rope,” he sighs with a wave his hand. He’ll save John time. “Please explain the rules.”
“My point exactly. We are not them.”
"What about Sherlock? I thought you'd become close."
Of course she doesn’t know, and he doesn’t want to tell her he’s not going back. He doesn’t want John to know he’d been here. He’s sure John won’t be back at the apartment. There is something inside that he needs. His meds.
It’s a relief in tension that reassures John that the day might not be a complete mistake. “Looking forward to a day with Molly?” he asks.
“That’s all that matters,” John said. It was cold, but it was dry on the inside.
“John, there’s something else you should know.”
"Shush. Rest. I'll give you something now for the pain. You'll feel a pinch. There you go, man." The man winks again at me.
“Thank you.”
Sherlock has never cared for appearances although he does care what John thinks (at times). It's not unlike when he thought he could wipe away jumping off Bart's roof by drawing a mustache on his face and serving their bloody dinner. True, Sherlock hadn't actually deserved the headbutt that night, but does Sherlock really believe that by planning John's wedding and selecting a photographer he can simply erase the agony of those months he left John believing he was dead? All those times standing by his tombstone weeping compensated for by helping Mary choose which silver table service?
Shame said at last.
"Bon débarras," shout the men as John stumbles out. They leave him standing on the dock with his message in a bottle.
Sherlock threw his shoulder back and looked James in the face, but he still refused to give James the pleasure of any reaction.
The app beeps again. Another message to Sophy.
“If you kill him, I’ll never go with you,” Sherlock said.
“That is a key, and it is important, but it’s not the key I need-- that key is inside here.” Mycroft leans across the table and taps the side of Sherlock’s head. “It is a blueprint. A treasure map. A genetic marker.
“I know you will. This memory loss...my son experienced it before...as a child. He had a sister. I can’t go into details, but the circumstances of her loss were tragic. My son blocked it all out, all that happened that day, and all memory of his sister.”
“I should shoot you. But I promised your brother I’d keep you safe if I ever found you. Ironic that I do and it’s to find Mycroft.” She nudges it into his temple. “And Dr. Watson, look how you care for him. Not letting us near him. Not going inside. You’re lucky that we need to find your big brother. I guess I won’t blow your brains out here.”
On his elbows looking down at Sherlock, John whispers, “You are a beauty.”
“They are comfortable, and I, unlike you, can carry off any attire and look rakish. You’d look like a blue baboon my scrubs.”
John gives William a damp flannel to wipe his face, then begins getting his IV set up and back in. He’s cursing himself for not realizing William might run.
The rain blows off to sea as quickly as it came in, leaving everything even more humid and sticky than before.
, Sherlock."
some clothes missing, so it's taking far longer than usual to calm her down. John listens with half an ear and then hurries off mid-complaint with mumbled advice to check Lost and Found, no doubt cementing the reputation of surgeons as arrogant prats. Bother. He'll worry about that later.
"Leave. It. Open." I threw my arms out, but she still couldn't see me on the floor behind the curtain. The whoosh of the door slamming again made me even colder.
The gesture sends bells and whistles to Sherlock’s brain.
“Some good reading on your shelves,” Sherlock says diplomatically, scraping the plates off into the bin. “Although the James Patterson novels you have are rather predictable.”
Sherlock swipes them off along with his trousers. John begins undressing as well.
“I’ll come back after,” John says. “I want to.”
"All right. His name's William, then?" Greg asks as the doors open. John nods as he hurries away. He can tell that the nurse is a bit miffed at John's sudden interest in the recovery ward patients — turns out Mrs. Roberts is railing again about someone taking her things, only this time there
John sipped his coffee. She had made a fresh pot. Not bad. Nice and hot.
"Yes. Family name."
“When will you stop using that premise to get me to a crime scene?” I watch the mother as I begin to tap along the wall. “Here. There’s a hidden panel obscured by the ridges in the wall.”
“And Sherlock is going in to meet him alone,” John says.
Will is taller than John, and it's likely John doesn't like feeling short. So Will would need to be level to John, somehow. Maybe sitting like they are right now. He imagines John standing and coming to Will, concerned about some deep loneliness Will might reveal. Will would grasp John's hands, draw them upward, brush lips over a knuckle, over the thin skin around the cleft between two fingers. He would show some hesitancy, yet make eye contact, giving John the opening to assure Will that his feelings are not unwanted. Will would reach up to pull John closer — best to avoid the bad shoulder until he has more data about what level of pain John experiences. He would put a hand to John's side and reaching up, lay two fingers under John's jaw, drawing him down into a kiss. His hands will be close enough to vulnerable points on John's body to provoke a slight thrill, a subliminal fear response, without making John feel out of control. Although John's lips are a bit thin, when he licks or bites them, they have a splendid blush about them. John might even flush when aroused.
What Sherlock did not want to deduce was what the crusty tin pots and sticky cast iron pans had once contained. Most of them Sherlock refused to even touch. The cleanest he had scrubbed until his knuckles bled so that he could use them, but only after he’d scoured the sink with those hideous Brillo pads. And the yellowed terry cloth dish towels were literally stiff! He boiled them in the large kettle. At least that was clean.
And tomorrow? Sherlock has planned a day with Mary finalizing the flower selections. Now, it seems, that too is to be done without John.
"But where is his body?'
He buries John’s thick cock down his throat again. As John strains to see those perfect lips wrapped around his cock, John thinks Sherlock really is out to kill him. He bobs his head, swirls his tongue. Fiction builds. He’s about to shoot off when Sherlock pulls back.
"I doubt that, but one can ever be sure," Sherlock says. "I think she did care for you, but..."
John sucks his bottom lip in as he leads Sherlock into his room. Sherlock doesn’t expect to find a bug, but given the liberty to peek around with John’s approval, he takes advantage. John is a fascinating study. Always surprising and contradictory. Sherlock really does think his reading material in his bedroom is eclectic: from Tolstoy to Fleming to...what’s this under his mattress? A gay porn magazine?
“I lied!” Sherlock sings out.
Sherlock thinks.
Sherlock pushes his thumb into his forearm, leaving behind a white thumbprint. "I
He puts his head between his legs for a moment to compose himself. He couldn’t be there near John. He knows Helena’s car is waiting for him in the back of the building, but he had to get out and away before he changed his mind. He cuts around the side of the building through the grass and on to the drive that leads to the back parking lot.
"Turn this stone to gold," Paylar demands. "Change it, and I will get that arm tended to."
“Those interviews were completed yesterday. The position is already filled.”
leather gloves.The inside of them. Examine his effects.” He points to a large evidence bag. “You will find that the substance used to incapacitate the victim are in his gloves.”
He’s out of the building. The app beeps. Anthea quickly reaches over and taps another mobile shaped icon on his cell. Sherlock has sent a text.
"It is in your best interest to listen. My brother was … is obsessed with James Moriarty. It is an unhealthy obsession. It is also a mutual one. While Sherlock’s vision may be clouded by this obsession, my brother does embody an unmatched talent when it comes to mastering the intricacies of the criminal mind. He is correct that Moriarty is a very dangerous man, but understand that my brother can be just as dangerous. He takes unparalleled risks. That he seems to have found a kindred spirit in you is most distressing to the family. Most reasonable people would have found themselves another roommate, but not you, Mr. Watson. Why is that?"
"It was my brother."
Sherlock rolls the dice first, and proceeds toward the Ballroom. He thinks of his own rooms that he goes into and decides it’s a lot like Cluedo. “Served in the service as a doctor. Shot in the left shoulder. Most likely Afghanistan. You thought you were retired as a surgeon, but no longer.”
“Only one. The rest, I assure you, are very real.”
“I should punch you for that note,” he says checking Sherlock’s eyes closer. “I wasn’t far from Mike’s door when some of her men ambushed me.”
John crawls back under the cover and lies on his side facing Sherlock and lazily swings a leg over Sherlock’s.
He could hear her sniffing.
“Thanks.”
“Ta, I believe that’s it,” John says as he pays the driver. He watches for a moment as the cab drives off.
"I thought as much.”
“Shouldn’t you be advising me of my rights first?”
He couldn’t drop that line of thought. Was what he wanted that wrong? Was it wrong to want a man? Was it wrong to trust a man he hardly knew not only with his body, but with his mind?
Then he nearly staggers and falls. How could he have missed this?! Although these buildings held no interest to him, he’d thought he’d nosed around the edges of this place— or so he told himself— but what he sees before him is something he either avoided or blocked from his mind.
He was up wound tight in the sheets. I bent down to check on him and felt his head and checked his pupils when he sits up and kisses my cheek! I jumped back in shock and was halfway out the door when he calls my name. He settled down after. I, however, couldn’t sleep. That’s why I’m telling you my day.
John takes the coffee. “‘Overnight observations’ were the inside of my eyelids more than not, at least after Mrs. Roberts down the hall dropped off about two. Before that it was the usual ‘someone’s been in my room, someone’s taking my things’ round she gets into. Thank god for the night nurse. I swear the nursing home sends her over here just to get her out of their hair.” He sips. “Molly’s doing the blood-borne safety stuff in person? Isn’t there a video...something? Not like she likes lecturing.”
"Yes. I was saving it."
The idiot leaves on my shoes, socks, and trousers. I almost laugh at his stupidity. They obviously have never read about using this nor seen any old gangster movies. Thank you, BAMF John, your obsession may very well save me.
"Thanks, Molls. I should have trusted you. His name's William Hawkins, by the way. I got that out of him, at least. When's Lestrade coming by? I ordered morphine for Mr. Hawkins, and I think he's getting some needed sleep. Pointless to question him if he's under."
"Nobody has any standards anymore," Will replies.
“You may not have any choice,” Molly says.
“I’m not fragile.” Sherlock says. “Please.”
"What, Sherlock? You were his prey, weren't you?"
“What? That you barged in and disrupted my experiment?” He pulled back, but still refused to look at James.
“Yes.” She’s blushing, then turns around. Sherlock follows behind her to meet John halfway, and sees Molly meet Anthea in the lobby.
Although John watches Sherlock carefully, Sherlock hasn’t had one episode since that day at the yards where they last saw Sophy. His headaches have tapered off, and he hasn’t had one in weeks, which is one of the reasons John gave the go ahead for this visit. John wanted to make certain there were no setbacks or emergencies since they might not be able to leave the island if there was one.
be the graves. His hands are still high in the air but his fingers dance.
He makes his way back up the stairs to her room while she’s distracted. He chuckles silently to himself remembering how he crept up on John, startling him. John asked Sherlock, “Who do you think you are, James Bond?” Sherlock was flustered. Who was this Bond? John laughed and explained. Only two days ago in their flat this happened. Now, a guard stands with his back to a door in a room he will never feel at home inside. He shakes off his untidy memories.
“I’ll do my best,” John promises. “I know you need to keep those coffers full!”
It’s corny. That silly song. But. “You. All I want is...you,” John whispers shakily against Sherlock’s ear. “Make me come.”
Sherlock does. Grudgingly.
Suddenly, the path I’m walking and my father disappear. From there a maelstrom of real moments in time meld into phantasms. I am twelve-years old again in the reoccurring nightmare of my youth where deep inside the Hidden Hills, I’m crawling through the caverns toward a distant, flickering light. When I reach it, my hands and knees are bloodied, but I care little about them. Instead, it’s the light's source that holds my fascination.
Sherlock stops dead in the office doorway. A lamp is overturned, papers litter the floor. He takes three more steps inside. Behind the desk, Lord Blackwood is sprawled out on the floor on his back. Face pale, marks around his neck. Sherlock doesn’t need to kneel down and feel his pulse to know he’s dead but not for long. Still he checks, the dogs helping him, each whining and whimpering and licking their master.
He’s dreamed of chasing the bloke before— he imagines he can chase him again. William dashes into the stairwell, and John flies through the metal fire door after him. He should call out for someone to help stop the wanker, but John doesn’t want to call attention. Instead, calls himself a bloody fool and follows.
“No need to do that. I can handle my brother.”
“I hate you,” she whispers to Mycroft.
A moment later, he heard her “Hello?”
“I will love watching you suffer,” he said, thrusting the muzzle into Sherlock’s head for emphasis. Moran finished punctuating his thoughts by sitting down hard in the old rocker. The poor chair creaked and the floorboards groaned in complaint.
He watches as the sedan pulls aways. Almost everything she said and did tells Will she isn’t who she says she is. He has no memory of her.
“Leave him alone. I swear, James, if you touch him ...”
“Almost gone,” Sherlock says a bit forlornly as he dips a couple of fingers back into the ice cream bowl. He holds them out in front of his face, then reaches between John's legs and slips them inside his waiting arse.
Sherlock’s fist still had hold of John’s shirt. With a whisper of a touch, a hint of a breath, his lips brushed against Sherlock's. Sherlock didn't mind at all; John minded even less. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock's waist, effectively pulling him into his lap.

This nightmare has replayed many times and though I know what will happen next, I can’t help myself. I step out in front of the transmutation circle, my feet touching the edge. Twisted, horrifying mutations of animals and humans re-assembled in a grisly hodgepodge of parts surround me. I sweat and shiver from the waves of hot and cold that radiate from the spinning orb above. The snarling chimeras' jaws snap at me as they form a ring around me. I leap away, but there is no escape. I am trapped. I smell their foul breath and feel the heat of their bodies as the circle grows tighter.
“But,” John holds up his purloined ID, “as you already know, I’m John Watson. We can’t both be John. Too many Johns as it is.”
“I can’t do it here in these conditions. He’ll have to be moved,” says the doctor.
He keeps most of what he knows about Anthea to himself since it seems Sherlock doesn’t want to share. There’s not much more Sherlock does share about his time with Sophy, and John notes what little Sherlock
John's foot immediately began to bob faster, but his eyes remained glued to the page.
“Yes, you only need me. Now be a good boy and tell John Watson that you no longer need him. Vatican Cameos, remember?”
“Abraham Markham.”
“Drew? Does he remember her?”
Sherlock opens his eyes and the world comes alive inside John.
John and Harry giggled happily at their parents kissing.
Simple enough.
"Allergic reaction," Sherlock said. "Obvious. You have been scratching and sneezing. It is something in this new environment or you would already be dealing with it. The most common socially-encountered allergens are perfumes and cologne. You don't wear any. I do."
“It could work,” John says.
“Maybe you should have turned me over,” John says.
“I solve crimes because I enjoy the challenge, not to bring people to justice.”
. Git."
"Oh, do get on with it," Sherlock said gruffly.
The Personal Blog of Dr. John H. Watson
“No key here. Mycroft has it. Mycroft, give it to the nice lady before she kills us.”
Mycroft’s brows knit together into one his infamous scowls. Despite his projected haughty indifference, I know he is as perplexed as I am. He scans the flat for Rosie before walking over to John’s chair. “She’s taking a nap?” he asks, the facade completely gone. The disappointment in his voice is evident even to John. It seems Mycroft’s cold heart had been thoroughly melted by bright-blue eyes and a cherub smile.
“No, they never are.”
John stopped at the newspaper rack in front of Hatcher Library. He picked up a copy of the
He was five, but he didn't admit it. He'd also read
“I know that someone needs to help Lestrade write up his report,” Sherlock says, letting go of John’s hand. “It should be me.”
“You already had it.”
<Set to Private>
There she was with Moran. At least she wasn’t holding a gun, just a syringe.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Both John and Sherlock’s POV in this chapter with plenty of introspection and mutual pining.
And one familiar one, showing up at just the wrong moment. "Greg! Hi!" John tries not to actually squeak at the rumpled detective.
“No, tanks, as in canisters that were to be used as the method of dispersion. I am tracking it. Look! See the marks on the ground!” Sherlock taps the screen.
Not long ago, Sherlock cocooned himself completely from the world within a protective shell. Then, the difference between himself and a doctor was he believed himself incapable of feeling. No more. As he struggles looking down at the man on the stab who Sherlock once laughed and drank with, he feels. The only difference now is that he just doesn’t reveal it to the world.
He sees Winston’s shadow following not far behind.
“Now that I know is a lie. I distinctly remember him pushing me into the lake with I was ten, and saying to me he hoped I drowned.”
John frowns, trying to put thoughts together without sounding too off-balance. "You talked to him,” John says. “You know he's clever, you can hear he's posh. And to hear him tell it, he's been living with no idea who he is and bloody great lumps on his head. Someone..."
His mom would laugh at them as she weeded and tended to her garden. She'd always planted tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, and lettuce in the back. In the front yard, every spring, his mom planted petunias, marigolds, and other bright flowers. Even before John knew what the flowers were called, he still loved to watch them grow and bloom. And then he looked forward to fall, when he and Harry would help his mom can tomatoes and rake leaves.
"You mean sex?" John's voice cracks.
He doesn’t usually smoke but considering he’s on edge over tonight and all the possible implications and possibilities with John, he needs it. His heart pounds thinking of it without the nicotine, but at least his hands calm. He’s still concerned about the planned sting for Ms. Kratides, but focusing on what will John and he do tonight becomes his new obsession. Will it be more kissing, touching and mutual wanks or more? Oral sex or sexual intercourse? So many possibilities.
The first section of the chapter wasn’t written until this week. The last half was written this summer. It's so exciting and a bit sad having this so close to the end. During those lazy days when we were first creating this, little did we know how well loved this story would become. We are grateful to all of those who have followed along and all those who come to it now and read it in one long shot. Thank you for all of the Kudos and comments along the way.
"He wasn't in Calc yesterday either."
And of course he’d lead him to this place, a pool. The thing of Sherlock’s nightmares. His heart hammered against his chest, and he fought to control his breathing.
“Sherlock,” John whispered. “For the love of God, step away from me!”
But that was not the case: she knew him or saw that part of him. They walked away together as the credits rolled.
John sniffs. He hates this. So he was stuck on a boat with people who didn't speak English because he's too friendly?
“John still blaming you for Mary’s death?”
“Good. That's good. And as much as this is the season for giving, I must say that I like to be on the receiving end,” John says.
"Good night, John."
Eyes still looking up and shining, his lashes fluttering, his cheeks flushing, Sherlock sits back on his heels.
“Why not?” Sherlock reaches up and wraps his hand loosely around John’s wrist.
“We have determined which marker. We want to know how they did it-- the key as it were.”
“Yeah, well, he’s unusual; the name fits him.”
Molly gives a choked laugh. “Except you. She was avoiding you. I watched her. She ducked into a patient’s room when she saw you coming down the hall. It would have been funny if it wasn't so awful.”
“Oh, Sherlock, every person has a soft spot— that little pressure point that can be poked and prodded. It’s delightfully entertaining to watch people writhe and squirm. Please continue.”
At home it never got easier. His dad hated "fags." He'd heard him talk about "those cock suckers" more than once. He wasn't sure how his mom or sister felt, but he wasn't about to ask.
No mind palace was necessary to send him back to the night when he was on his hands and knees being fucked by that magnificent cock. Sherlock wished he could crawl down next to him and lift that quilt and gaze beneath to actually watch John's performance. John's hips jerked in perfect four-four time.
“I can explain,” he says. “Only untie me.”
Thank you to hotshoeagain for the excellent beta, and pointing out to me that a university student wouldn’t have a Stradivarius.
He’s a bit dazed, not at his best when he walks in through a side door. He wants Sophy to
. John will be so disappointed. He'd liked Ms. Bellin. A lot. Sherlock did too in a fashion. Although he’d thought she was a bit of a bore. Always good to be a bit surprised. The sheer complexity! Pretending to be a micromanaging administrator when in reality she was a master criminal kingpin. The woman hid her true essence and proved to be a crafty adversary.
John appreciates how fast they patch him up in A&E. All the while he’s second guessing about Sherlock. The knot in his stomach gets tighter as he thinks about how he put Sherlock off. Maybe he should have gone with him and spoke to him immediately. He hates leaving Sherlock with his own thoughts, which could be far worse than words. A nurse is putting on his plaster when Beca walks in the room.
John looked at her closely. “No, it can wait.”
"You should have taken the money," Sherlock said.
“I ...” I am about to tell him that Sherlock was not a girl’s name, that I had meant to tell him then that I loved him. I stop. John’s blue eyes are wide, his breathing becomes rapid gasps.
“What do you want me to tell him?”
--------------------
Sherlock’s erect penis becomes the positive stimulus as John inches closer. John’s eyes linger on the tent in Sherlock’s scrubs, then at Sherlock’s mouth. Just at the moment when John is about to abort, Sherlock grabs his t-shirt and applies positive reinforcement to John’s lips. Unfortunately he’s not quite sure what to do once said lips touch, but Sherlock is keen to strengthen the said behavior. With that, Sherlock responds and moves his lips. Then John’s eyes flutter and they both moan. John’s tongue tests Sherlock’s upper lip. He opens his mouth and…
Sherlock is trying to tell him. He really is. He doesn’t want to die. There were many times in his life when didn’t care if he died. He cares now. He has something, someone, to live for.
It's a twisty-turning ride, and it takes far too long for the world to go dark. His pulse pounds in his temples, and his breathing feels erratic. He thinks that he might be having a reaction to whatever concoction they used on him. He hates the world, but he hates Irene Adler more.
It was horrid. I didn’t tell John the rest. How the alpha touched me, or how I thanked god they hadn't removed my clothes. I thought I at least had that amount of dignity left to me.
With that, on to the final chapter.
We wait for him. The water runs. At least he washed his hands. He comes out, his mask is off and he’s a mess of wild red hair.
John straightens his back as John attempts to do the same with his inner resolve.
“It will be much more convincing to Sophy if Lestrade doesn’t know,” Sherlock explains to John.
“Please do.”
was the protagonist. The man in another man’s body.” James flashed Sherlock a wicked grin. “I do enjoy that idea. But a do-gooder?” James said with distaste.
He was wrong. His father drank even more than before, now that he had all day to do it. John doesn't know why he clung onto that idea. Maybe it was because he did love his father still with all his heart, and until that moment, John believed the father he loved would return.
John does. Hard. Enough to spurt out over his own hand and drive a high breathy whine from his lips to echo off the walls. The sight of Sherlock watching him come, the curve of his lips, those dark curls damp on his forehead—makes John's heart skip-hammer in his chest.

“Take off your shirt. I’ll be right back with a bin liner to slip over your foot so it won’t get wet.”
At lunch Sherlock tried once again to fend off all of John's questions regarding Moriarty, but instead he was forced to watch as John devoured two atrocious frankfurters dripping relish, mustard, and ketchup.
I was handed over to Moran upon Moriarty's death. Just a commodity shifted from one hand to another to be used to finish Moriarty's work. And when no longer useful, discarded. That is why I'm here.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “I need more time. I shall see Lestrade tomorrow. First I needed time to dwell on the note.”
————————————
John had always known that he was attracted to boys and men. At the movies, he didn't go to watch the women; it was the men he went to see. Sean Connery, Paul Newman, Robert Redford were just a few. He poured over their photos in well-used magazines and hid them under his mattress. Girls were fine, but after that summer with Steven, he knew the truth.
John stood and opened his hand. After Sherlock dropped them into John’s palm, his fingers folded and clenched tightly around the dog tags. Sherlock expected John to be angry. Instead, he bowed his head and began to quietly sob.
Snow began to blow down and around so fast and furiously that Sherlock could hardly see two feet in front of him. It was nothing like what he’d experienced in London. Yes, the wind howled and the snow came down in blankets, but not with this ferocity. He’d heard of blizzards in the states with drifts that buried autos.
“I always read thoroughly.”
Molly did have nice legs accented by a red and purple flowered skirt so short that it barely covered her behind. It didn't even take a light breeze to send the skirt up to reveal her cute little tushy along with matching red and purple print panties. They reminded John of bathing suit bottoms or what girls wore under the tennis skirts. Walking next to her John noticed she was getting plenty of appreciative head turns and smiles from male and few female students.
to blame.  I could have prevented it. I knew from the first moment I met her what she was. I should have known what she would be capable of.
“I read the papers and can read between the lines well enough. The one you saved.”
John bit his lip to keep himself from gasping. How the fuck did he know he'd had sex with Sherlock last night?
