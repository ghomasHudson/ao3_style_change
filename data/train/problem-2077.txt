I wrote the date and time and his initials.  “I know,” I replied, “and I’ve forgiven you.  Those weren’t mere words I said.  I have.  I do.”  I set the vial on top of the discarded cellophane.  “I was only doodling.”
Sherlock shed his dressing gown.
Ms Swann clicked again and her eyebrows went up further.
There was another roar from the terrace.
Puck’s eyes moved to it and stuck there.
Baskerville lay down and the lioness licked his head and his face.  Baskerville’s tail started to thump the ground.
“We can have its cover fitted with a strap so that you can carry it slung behind you,” he said.
"I'm putting this straight into the freezer," Sherlock said and swept around the corner of the half-open laboratory door.
“Last night’s storm hit home,” I told him.
A hand landed on my shoulder.
The silver disc shone in his hands.  He would not have to press very hard to break it.
“Kit?”
I’ve given him my
“You just saw a man die.”
At my neck, Sherlock bit deep.
“Eat,” Mrs Turner urged, “It’s going to be cold tonight.”
John held up a finger.  “Let’s go out,” he said and reached behind the door for his jacket.
One by one, everyone took a turn drinking, their fellows humming a little more loudly while one drank or ate.
If he hadn’t dropped the gun at the first wave of pain, I would have.
“Bored,” Sherlock repeated, dropping down a branch.  It swayed as he landed, glossy leaves rustling.  He reached for a cluster of berries.
With one more roll of the eyes, Mycroft glided off.  “Only something on the far side of the room, brother mine.”
Not unless the wall is a Moebius strip.  I haven’t taken my shoulder from the wood.
He looked surprised, then leaned forward and took it off the fork.  He looked around the room as he chewed.
He gestured at me and Corvus handed me the envelope.
My stomach roiled.
He inclined his head slightly.
“Or is it you they have a nose for Doctor Watson?” Mycroft asked, turning to face us.
The tone caused me to straighten up in my chair.
I raised my eyebrows, but didn’t say a thing.
"It would seem so," Sherlock replied.  "Lestrade, have you a rope?  Ours is fulfilling another purpose currently."
I leaned against the side of the settee.  “When you were gone, I dreamt of searching for you at the Falls,” I said and the falling water drowned out Holmes’s playing for a moment.  “I never re-lived any of our adventures nor a single hour of the many we spent in this room.”  My arm swept about me, then dropped to my side.  My voice dropped with it.  “I had to read my stories or my notes for that.”
I looked up then.
I turned towards him, some wild grimace no doubt on my face.  He nodded genially at me and I retreated without falling down the step and felt very grateful for that.
John probably should've been worried about getting ax-murdered, but this florist Sherlock Holmes seemed a bit innocent for that.
(I hope for sunshine tomorrow)
Holmes's heart races.
“Oh,” he muttered to himself, a bit excited again at the prospect of discovering something interesting. “Forgot all about you, didn't I?” He stroked the aging leather cover and leafed it open.
“I told you to do something!” the man screams, and he is hitting him again and again and again, and Holmes feels every blow so sharp and hard pounding on his sore, abused muscles that his vision goes black.
Covering his nose and mouth with his arm to stifle the smell of urine and vomit, he gradually falls asleep.
“Your trouser leg,” he says simply, and they talk no more.
He fished around and found the painkillers, took two. He felt like he shouldn't just leave this place without saying anything, so he decided to leave a note back.
He led John out of the green house.
“Yessir. 'Ow'd ye know?”
For the next several days John feared he was having some sort of nervous breakdown—he was a bundle of anxiety and strange, foreign thoughts.
“You'll see.”
“Yes yes. Goodbye, Holmes.”
“God have mercy,” Holmes mutters as the rat draws nearer. He swats at it, but misses. The huge black creature dives for his arm in wild rage. He yelps and swings his arm in an arc, the nasty omen keeping grip with a pair of razor teeth. Searing pain grips him and he finally manages to throw it off. It flies against the wall and dies instantly, lying at his feet. He grips his now bleeding forearm.
Holmes nods, not surprised by the story. By the color of the man's skin, he can easily tell why an alienist would misdiagnose his grief.
His discomfort with the handcuffs only grows on the ride to court. When he is let out, he murmurs to the guard to please loosen them.
Hi friends, sorry for not posting, my friends been over, I've had drivers ed, (almost every night) forensics class, and I've been promoted at my state's police explorers (sergeant!!!!)....so I'm busy lol.
The man smiled. John swallowed.
Irene was no idiot—she had a degree neuroscience, in fact, which some would say made her something of a genius, really. She knew the inner workings of the human mind like she knew the road to her house. She was clever like that.
Holmes can hear the first one like a cannon, a the sickening
“No, doctor, I'm well, thank you,” Lestrade says firmly. “Perhaps we should sit down.”
“I had a feeling something wasn't right when no word came from you after my letter. I came after a week of sending it.”
The inside was decorated like something straight out of the 60s—and John realized that was probably the last time anyone had lived inside. It smelt of mold and dust. He crinkled his nose and searched for a scented candle to light.
He dreams John reaches for him, and he reaches back, but then his body is too weak to grab his hand. “I don't want to go,” he says, but Watson is already too far away for him to reach.
“Back to work!” a guard snaps at him, and he returns to it sullenly.
Holmes obeys, and finds both his arms grabbed roughly.
“Sure,” said John.
He thought.
“What?”
, which had become credible again since the Second Wizarding War.
“Mr. Holmes?” the man asked.
“I’m fine thank you,” Sherlock replied still strolling around the room. Windibank shrugged and started in on his tale of his costly injury during an international match. James told his story animatedly while sitting in the chair facing away from the desk. This gave Sherlock time to get a closer glance at the weird bottle.
“Yup, shall we?”
“Sherlock, what are you doing?” John asked as he put his stuff down on the coffee table. Sherlock was now on his hands and knees by John’s chair.
The parts I wanted to add on to finish the story for me, not for class.
“Nope. Think about it. Lonely girl from a wealthy wizarding family looking for companionship,” Sherlock recounted.
“Mail’s here,” John stated. Sherlock grunted in acknowledgment. John went over to the blonde barn owl with the letters in his beak and the
“I wasn’t sure whether or not to bother you with this Mr. Holmes, but you helped my friend Julia with her little problem, so I figured you could help me with mine,” said Mary.
“Huh,” John smiled.
“What employment does James-” Sherlock interrupted.
“Oh my god,” John mumble as something clicked in his head.
“Sherl- “
“Home?” asked Sherlock holding out his hand.
“When I asked James to help me try to locate Hosmer, he told me to let the whole thing go and just drop it. I’m afraid that I might upset him if he found out I went against his wishes. I don’t want to know what the consequences would be,” Mary said. John and Sherlock shared a look but nodded.
“You cast that nonverbally,” Sherlock awed.
“Did you do something to this?” he asked showing her the bottle.
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock called.
He read. He walked into the kitchen and unceremoniously dropped Sherlock’s pile on the kitchen table. John took a seat across from his companion and opened the single letter addressed to him. His confusion as to who sent him a letter melted into annoyance as he read the letter from his sister. Sherlock looked up from the muggle microscope at John’s change in mood. Based on John’s expression, it looked like the letter was from his sister and she started drinking again.
“Yes?” She asked when she made the landing.
“I sent the official letter first, and the personal letter the next day. He responded to both with the same green ink and style as that in Miss Sutherland’s letters,” concluded Sherlock.
“Hmm,” he replied looking up at John softly. His look took John aback, John had never seen that look on Sherlock before.
“How long what?”
she thought. Mrs. Hudson only lightly dusted for them, but enough for it not to cake up. She looked out at the rest of the living room and sighed.
“Well, what’s yours?” Sherlock asked.
“What kind?”
“The moment you were chasing that niffler around the flat,” John said snickering at the end. Sherlock sighed and hung his head in embarrassment putting both hands through his hair. The flowers disappearing when they lost focus. John started laughing harder.
“Wait, what did you smell again?”
. He thought. “I figure Apparating there shouldn’t be a problem.”
“Well now John, where should I start?” Sherlock rhetorically asked John who shrugged and smiled in return. “We can start with Miss Sutherland.”
“Earl Grey of course,” he said like Sherlock was being stupid.
“What’d you chat about?” John asked innocently.
“Random guy got cold feet?” he guessed.
“Well you do now,” John whispered. Sherlock smiled and leaned his head towards John. They sat there with their heads together for a while.
“Crisp morning,” he finally responded. “Like when you walk outside right before dawn and the air just has that certain clearness to it.”
“Working on it. I have an idea, but it will take a couple of days,” replied Sherlock. He got up and took the stack of letters to the kitchen where he found a sack that would mask the smell of the potion and quickly shoved them inside it. John watched in enjoyment and curiosity, and eventually went back to reading the previously abandoned paper. Sherlock came back into the living room and began writing profusely in the purple ink that John used to record their adventures. John saw the use of his ink but didn’t think anything of it other than he should get Sherlock his own pot of purple ink, maybe he would like that.
“That’s not perfume it is?” John asked an amused Sherlock.
“They all look like they are from the same person,” he remarked.
“Take a seat, please,” Windibank said, directing them to the couch. John took a seat with a look from Sherlock that he would continue standing. Sherlock took in the small room and noticed a strange bottle on the desk as he made his way around the couch.
“The letter on the left is the most recent, it came from James Windibank doing personal business. The letter in the middle came from Windibank at his office. And the third came from ‘Hosmer Angel’,” he explained. “The day Miss Sutherland came asking for help, I sent a letter to the Federal Identity Commissioner with questions about if a wand permit is still needed to enter America. I signed using Mrs. Hudson’s name, so I could send another letter to him at his personal address inquiring if he would like to meet up to discuss Quidditch odds. I heard through the vine that he is an avid gambler.
“May I keep these letters for the investigation?” he asked
“I’m trying to make a more efficient Sleeping Draught,” stated Sherlock, like it’s obvious. He withdrew his wand from his pocket trying to clear the room of the smoke at least. John shook his head and walked towards the living room table. He picked up the
“Of course, I do you, idiot,” John said. Sherlock looked at him in disbelief. “What?”
“YES,” Sherlock suddenly exclaimed making John start.
“Nope,” he popped the p as he said it. “What do you think it is John?”
“Miss Sutherland, please take a seat,” Sherlock gestured towards the chair that was reserved for all of their clients. They all took their respective seats, the boys ready to hear her story. “Are you perchance related to Thomas Sutherland, the potioneer?”
Mrs. Hudson being “not their housekeeper” still came into the flat when they were out adventuring and at least dusted. Those boys were such a mess, but anytime she moved anything slightly to the left, she got an earful. They were out god knows where doing god knows what, she figured she had time to dust the living room at least.
Sherlock froze.
“Mr. Holmes?”
“Of course, that’s why I brought them. Oh, and can we please keep this quiet, I don’t really want this getting out, especially to James,” she pleaded.
“How long have you had feelings for me?” he asked scooting closer. Sherlock looked at him with a loving gaze.
“I understand, but I will be loyal to him forever. No matter what,” she replied.
“So, he used the potion to make her an offer that would be difficult to refuse under that much love potion,” John realizes out loud as he leans back in his chair. Sherlock nods at him confirming his suspicions.
“Yeah,” said John. “It’s one of my best spells after healing spells.” Sherlock just sat there looking at John with awe and amusement. John was watching the two patronuses and how they acted with each other, content with each other and their place. John found that it was probably true of the wizards they belonged to. He turned to look at Sherlock, he flicked his eyes toward his lips and leaned in. Sherlock met him halfway. The otter wrapped itself around the hedgehog and the creatures sighed with contentment. As John tenderly kissed Sherlock he realized, his interpretations of their patronuses was correct. They were content.
“Yessir, I read as much in A Study in Scarlet. But I think I may be able to find a job at the docks. They need strong workers.”
“Yes,” he says. “I fear Watson is angry with me.”
There is nothing he can do but follow them, follow them into the dark and violent chamber. He sees the machine, and it alights fear within him that makes him tremble.
He is given a mouth guard to bite into.
Holmes spots Watson in the crowd, and feels a familiar spark of comfort. He is, at least, not completely alone here.
Inside, there is a lot of screaming.
He wondered if he'd said something wrong, scared off the shy florist. It was stupid, though. He was just a guy, right? Just an acquaintance. He wasn't some school boy with a crush.
(at an insane rate)
“So you're telling me you grow weed in your apartment to study it and you've never tried it before?”
“So I trust you understand I deal with many impossible problems?”
Bedlam reeks.
The motel would be ready to open in a month, when tourists started traveling and needed a place to stay. Fernsby wasn't exactly a tourist-y town, but people did pass through.
Holmes takes a liking to a certain small growth in his cell that he did not expect.
Sorry for not updating, have had block lol.
“Gross indecency,” he says.
When he wakes again, it is because someone is gently shaking him. It is Elijah.
Perhaps the reason he is being transferred is simply because the asylum will prove less difficult to infiltrate.
That was a child's dream, of course, but why not go for it?
It was mostly local businesses, and they were mostly closed, until he came upon a flower shop with the lights still on and an “Open” sign (very ornately painted and pretty) on the door.
“I think, my dear Watson,” he says, “That some day, the true story may be told. For now, it is just mine and yours.”
John thought about. Sherlock had told him he lived on Baker Street. Did he stumble here subconsciously, looking for comfort from the only friend he had?
Lestrade looks up sharply.
“Bet you think I'm mad, rummaging around for change,” John said awkwardly as he sat down.
The music was one of those pop-singer types John didn't like—some guy with shaggy hair and an acoustic guitar and an ego bigger than his dick. He didn't know quite why the type disgruntled him so much, but he turned the radio off and listened to the white noise from his open window.
Then he realizes he is the one that is screaming, and the nurse is hushing him, but he can hardly even recognize his own voice. He croaks Watson's name feebly.
Holmes has always enjoyed flowers. He takes them to be one of the greatest privileges of life itself—an extra, an unnecessary, brilliant piece of life, put on earth only for the enjoyment of the people on it. Holmes has never been one to believe in God, not truly, but sometimes, in his most quiet moments, looking at the dandelion, he wonders if maybe there is something larger than anything, watching.
And that is John Watson.
And he tries to believe it.
John's eyebrows furrowed.
Sherlock grinned, sending John a look that sent heat rushing to his neck.
“Truly,” Smith agrees, shaking Holmes's hand eagerly.
John found it not too strange that Harry had failed to pick him up from the airport, but it was still disappointing. After all, he had just come back from Afghanistan, and expected him to at least. . .well, what did he expect? For his brother to be happy about his return? To be excited enough not to ignore it in exchange for getting plastered? He guessed that was too much to ask.
The Inspector sits in the armchair across from Mycroft's and drums his fingers on the arm. He knows nearly nothing about Mycroft Holmes, except for Sherlock's scarce words about him, but from what he gathers, he is a very important person. This could very well be blackmail he is about to receive.
There is no code in the post script, but there are small, pressed flowers in the envelope.
“Sherlock Holmes.”
When John woke the next morning, he thought the florist had been a dream; but when he looked out his window at the porch, the primroses were swaying gently in the breeze.
Elaine begins to weep. Elijah smiles at the ceiling.
Maybe life in Fernsby was about to get better.
Sherlock Holmes was watering plants in acute concentration. In fact, he was actually
Now, after prison, not only is he thinner and meeker, the torture he had experienced yesterday (was it yesterday? This morning?) has taken a much greater toll. He can feel his chest beginning to freeze.
Funny, how everything he owned really fit in that suit case. It would've been sad if he didn't get rid of so much before he left. But he survived with less in the army, so why carry extra baggage?
“It all right, love, I'm here.”
A new class of people bring him cases—people from the slums, people from the most despised parts of life. Whores and inverts and the poor, and he helps them all, given that they are of a fair character. Evidently, his recent jail sentence seems to have brought him an entirely new type of client—the criminal.
“Well, er, I'd better be going. Nice to meet you, Irene.” He waved as he left, looking a bit flustered.
Holmes begins receiving letters.
She got in her car and drove off.
Watson looks up from his seat, finally looking at Holmes.
Lestrade fidgets with his hat in his hands.
“Yes, we are here concerning two patients, Mr Horace Jennings and Mr Sherlock Holmes,” Mycroft tells him impatiently.
He did.
They sit for several moments in stillness.
“I know, my dear man. That is precisely why I had to do it.”
John was standing there, looking a bit shy. A quick scan told Sherlock that he didn't intend to purchase anymore flowers, he needed something else.
(We'll have to go on a walk soon)
“Thank you, Mr Holmes,” he says. “Your brother and Inspector Lestrade send their greetings.” Holmes nods.
God, how long ago was it? He must've been ten or eleven. They would go to the arcade with all the change John scrounged up from keeping his eye sharply on the ground for the few months before.
John looked embarrassed.
“It's not been easy, Mr Holmes.”
Instead, more and more papers were covering “The New Oscar Wilde”. The press was starving for a new story with Wilde away behind bars. Eyewitnesses claimed they caught the two men conducting inappropriate behavior left and right. Aynonmous tips were sent to the police.
“Yeah.”
It was Mrs Hudson.
“People like me?” Sherlock said.
Holmes steeples his hands, tucking them under his chin.
“By now.”
“I need to see them both immediately. It may be a matter of life or death—“
“I'll assemble a force,” Lestrade says gravely.
“Thanks. What'd you do?”
“W-why—“
“I'm sure we do.” John smiled awkwardly.
“What will it do?”
He didn't know quite why, but he'd been itching for an excuse to go back to
At some point a doctor looks at him, and does a lot of nodding. Holmes thinks he hears something along the lines of, “be gone soon,” and, “too many bodies already.” It makes him feel sicker.
how much to water each individual specimen, like a scientist in a lab.
It does not help that every few minutes he is getting up to hack his lungs out. His body temperature fluctuates at extreme highs and lows—he shivers but is hot, sweats but is cold—and his skin turns pasty.
Mr Smith and Miss Carpenter say nothing, only giving him a grave look.
He will feel betrayed. He will feel heartbroken.
She pondered her options until she pulled up to the flower shop.
So John went out that day, and he collected all the change he could find. He went to the laundromat and the market and the bar and just picked up change—a penny here, a two pence there, until he was on Baker Street, picking up change from the sidewalk.
The man raises an eyebrow, impressed.
“Erm. . .”
A letter comes from Mycroft:
Sherlock smiled.
Quickly, he unearthed the very same cardboard box he'd watched Danvers bury the night before. Excitedly, he yanked it from the ground. It was surprisingly heavy—what was in here?
“Yeah. But. . .I ended up drunk. Just like he would've been. It's a bit funny, really. Wonder if the bastard looked down and planned it.”
Lestrade shuffles into the room, his jittery eyes bugging about.
When Holmes decides it is time to take cases again, he expects business to be slow.
He falls asleep.
He tells Watson not to worry himself, not to be guilty. He tells him to take however much is left in his desk (likely around a thousand pounds) and distribute it among the Irregulars. After all, he will have no use for money for quite some time. He also tells Watson not to gamble, and to stay out of danger. He can almost hear the doctor sighing.
“And you understand these charges?”
“Shh. It's all right.”
Then, Mycroft receives news that hastens his plan.
Silently, he crept through the darkness and started his own car.
“I will plead guilty, on the condition that John Watson serves no time in prison.”
Holmes has always been one to dress sharply and takes great care in his appearance, that is—the days he does not lounge about in his dressing gown playing with chemicals.
It was one small room, filled with junk and dust and mold. There were a few pieces of old furniture, a frayed quilt, someone's coat.
This was a fun one guys! Please do tell me what you'd like to read next for a new long fic! Much love, Nim :)
He got a cab home instead, still in okay spirits despite his annoyance. He was home, it was going to be. . .weird, for a while, he knew that.
“Oh, I'm sorry, Holmes,” Watson says in a breathy voice. “I—I've—“
“This had better be a good one, Watson,” he declares as he strides to the door. “This month has been a slow one for the criminal world. Come in, Inspector.”
“Pleasant, my dear. Up the stairs, now.”
There are both men and women here, non discreet about ogling Holmes as he is brought in. They have surely heard of the plea bargain he has made.
This surprises Holmes slightly.
The relationship began torrid, they had years of locked away feelings to get out, but the waters calmed into something more comfortable, something much gentler and sweeter than Holmes had ever imagined. This was the way they were always meant to be.
They overpowered them quickly, and took them to the backyard. Then, horrifically, they lynched the Thornes, making each one watch as the next victim was hanged.
“I love you too.”
“Oh yes,” he said. “Honey bees,
The man smiled.
The Justice calls the courtroom to order, and an eerie silence falls over it.
It is his day to work.
(The rain)
Watson gives an exasperated smile at the mention of his two addictions.
At least he has Mr Smith and Miss Carpenter. At first he is silent, but their curious looks soon become too much.
It is true. Many a time he has given grace to a criminal. That is just one reason he never did become a real detective—he obstructed justice and broke the law almost as often as he aided justice and enforced the law.
Sherlock shook his head.
“Yeah,” he said to no one in particular. “Yeah, this is gonna work. I can do this.”
Watson's face peers down at him, all concern and hurt and too much for him to handle. He nearly weeps in relief.
“My baby had typhoid,” Elaine sobs. “Oh, my baby had it. Doctor! We need a doctor!”
John wondered what kind of flower shop would be open at midnight. He decided it would be in his best interest to find out.
Watson draws his revolver and points it in the mans face.
He comes a week into Holmes's stay in Newgate, and he does so very quietly. When Holmes sees him, his heart races. He attempts to look nonchalant but fails. This makes the guard weary of leaving them alone, but Watson talks to him out of earshot and he does so. The five pound note Watson slips him does not escape Holmes's eyes.
“I don't try to be.”
Five voicemails from Charing Cross on the telephone.
“You must,” he whispers. “I need you.”
“What is your name?” the man asks.
The man's face lit up.
He doesn't know what rumors are true, but none of them are good.
Holmes is not hungry enough for supper, so he passes his pasty grey gruel to Miss Carpenter and sits in the corner with his hands steepled beneath his chin, already forming ideas.
And then both the doctor and detective go pale.
“Elaine Carpenter.”
His eyes flutter open heavily. He knows the voice, of course, but is it real, or a fabrication of his feverish mind?
They come for him the following morning. Two men, average looking, in frock coats.
It was mostly white Englishmen here at the time, and strictly Catholic. Slavery had already been abolished in England, but there was still stigma and apparently, ardent supporters of slavery had fled to small towns like Fernsby where they could have their, erm, views, in solitary peace.
He doesn't speak of the torture—it is still too fresh in his mind, and he will not worry Watson anymore than he is already worried. But he does talk of Elijah Smith and Miss Carpenter, and he tells him their stories.
“I'm sorry. It was a necessary detail. I knew if I informed you of my plan, you would stop it.” Watson nods, for this is true. Yet he feels like he is on the wrong side of the bars. He should be with Holmes, by his side as he always is, through every danger.
“I didn't take you for a hard drinker,” John said teasingly as Sherlock sipped his very iced beverage.
“Wow,” John said. “That's really impressive.”
He cannot even stand up.
“Indeed.”
He eases it onto the stand beside him, where the flower petals lay. They are no longer fresh and colored, but shriveled and brown.
Feeling a bit distorted and more than a little hungover, he left.
And when Holmes lays in his cell that night, shadows filling in around him, he thinks of the parish again.
Overall, piles of crap.
“And what is your name?”
Someone is gripping his hand.
Watson smiles, weeping in relief, and they both fall back into an exhausted slumber.
“He's not my boyfriend,” Sherlock said compulsively.
“I must be going now, Doctor,” Mycroft says. “It is late, and I have matters to attend to at the Diogenes Club.”
He increased his pace. He was still at least ten minutes away from the hotel and no cabs had passed him. In fact, not a single vehicle had been on the road, probably  because it was well past 4am. John looked back at the car, not bothering to pretend he didn't notice it and his stomach did a little flip. The car had moved to his side of the road and sped up to John's pace.
“We’re ‘upgrading’ the system” Sarah said, looking somewhat dejected.
"Obvious. You arrived here in 6 minutes. The only restaurant nearby is the one two streets away, calculating your less than average leg height and your timing from your hotel to my flat, it should have taken only half that time, meaning, you felt some semblance of guilt toward your dinner guest, not someone you knew or they'd have understood your situation much more readily. so date it is. One you truly believed you had a chance with. Wrong, by the way. Despite your aesthetic exterior, the previous few texts she had sent to your phone had at three grammatical errors in each sentence and the improper use of the word 'hors d'oeuvres'..." his nose wrinkled in distaste "...suggesting she is clearly only educated up to a high school standard and had been instructed by her old-fashioned minded mother, most likely Christian, to find a rich husband to support her. Seeing as you couldn't even afford your own Chinese last month and had taken her to a 2.5 star restaurant, I'd say it was doomed from the start as she would be practicing celibacy until her wedding night." And with a flourish of finality he slapped John's phone into his hand (John had a very odd sense of deja vu) and swished out of the alley with a "Text me the details, Gavin. Laters."
"Is anyone here a doctor?”
"Is that what?" Sherlock turned abruptly, looking as though he had forgotten John was still there.
“...guest.”
He checked his website and was greeted with more or less the same amount of joy.
Surely he didn’t know the man. He knew John was a war veteran but not that he served in Afghanistan. For the people that did know him, one detail followed the other. So why did he feel he recognised the man?
He stopped walking, reminded himself that he had been a soldier and decided to face his new tormenter. Short, dark hair and impeccably dressed in a suit. John vaguely noticed the similarities between this man and Sherlock. The similarities stopped after the man grinned and spoke.
“Fascinating” The man breathed. John glanced at him, feeling his cheeks grow hot as his pale eyes flickered over John.
It was pretty lame but he doubted the reports without casualties were even glanced at. False alarms weren’t cause for concern after all.
Instead what he found could only be described as baffling. The flat was warm, cozily so with the fireplace spitting in contentment. In place of bodies on the floor there were books stacked haphazardly. In place of blood, there was tea and amongst the domestic mess, on the sofa, was the unmistakable shape of a man curled into his dressing gown.
"Jim Moriarty. Hi."
And John felt himself sigh internally. His first failure. He wondered if it would have made a difference had he left the restaurant immediately rather than hold out in hope of salvaging his chances at getting laid. He eyed the blood painting every nearby surface with a nauseous feeling in his stomach. Not because of the blood, he was a doctor after all. And a veteran of Afghanistan. No, this was because he felt some semblance of responsibility for the pathetic excuse of a corpse now being examined with a tiny pocket magnifying glass.
Despite the general objection to the idea, almost 80% of the population had the chip implanted. Most had balked at the idea of serving jail time. There had been expected protest of violating human rights and something else John hadn’t really been paying attention to. His focus was on finding somewhere to live. He regretted not checking the prices of the rooms in this hotel before handing over his card.
John stared after his flapping coat in bewilderment. He had expected criminal robberies in this part of town, not rude charity.
He had been without a case ever since the mention of a mind reading chip caused a nationwide paranoia about getting caught murdering their spouses. He supposed he would have to make his own crimes if something didn’t come up soon. He snatched his phone from the mantel and moved back to stand in front of the window.
“John? Did you hear what I said?” Sarah snapped her fingers in front of John’s nose, her mouth quirked up into a knowing smile.
“What the hell?” John managed loudly. He scrambled back to his feet nearly knocking his knees into Sherlock’s. Sherlock also stood brushing past John and stepping onto and over the coffee table in a navy dressing gown whirlwind to stand at the window.
John ignored the jab at humour and kept his eyes stubbornly on Sherlock's who decidedly ignored him. He flapped the belstaff behind him with a flourish to avoid dragging it through the blood as he crouched down and continued examining the deep lacerations on the victim's throat with that ridiculous magnifying glass. He placed a hand beneath one of the wounds and frowned. "Cold." He muttered.
John had filed a relocation form immediately after bravely descending from the tree, sporting many scratches on his arms. He was sure that any day now he would receive a call to a more dangerous part of the city, far away from the misfortune of the grey tabby that was Mr. Whiskers.
Not the victim.
Mycroft tapped his umbrella against the kitchen floor impatiently.
John moved forward hurriedly to the pale figure, grabbing at his wrist as the sound of something cracked beneath his trainers. He lifted his foot to find the broken shards of something that made his stomach roll unpleasantly. A needle.
While Sarah had looked the most promising candidate, he found himself turning all his jean pockets inside-out in order to find the number of a pretty blonde that had winked at him in line at Tesco's.
John felt his eyes widen a fraction. “Um...Afghanistan, sorry how did you-“
Incident: What looked like a heart attack due to a severed head in the fridge, next to the jam.
Couldn’t he?
It was late April and John was...excited. It was only a few days until the official trial began. It had made international news headlines for weeks. England was the talk of the world, and not all of it was exactly positive. As predicted, there was an uproar. There was protesting outside of hospitals and the news had exhausted all the synonyms for ‘invasive.’
He sighed, taking a sip of his tea which was barely warm and bordering on tragic. The one downside to being on the job 24/7 was that drinking alcohol was strictly prohibited. Technically he was on commission, ‘leaping’ to the aid of whoever needed it and only getting paid on the severity of the emergency. He found there was not nearly enough near death experiences in this part of London to sustain his endless take-away habits.
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.
The embarrassment of his card declining at the Chinese restaurant was worse than forgetting his wallet in a cab. He still remembered the strange moment after he had asked to try his card again, another customer that had been waiting behind him had swooped in, flashing his card across the machine and all but shoving John out the way once he had tossed the receipt at him. He then proceeded to demand the food he had ordered over the phone in a posh, arrogant voice. John couldn’t even squeeze in a thank you before the man was suddenly sweeping out of the restaurant muttering incoherent insults under his breath, his take away nestled in a plastic bag that was swinging around rather violently with the man’s long strides.
. No one really knocks unless they are a client. John got up from his chair and looked out the window to see her pacing before the door opened.
“A year or so ago my mother remarried. He is only ten years older than me. I thought the arrangement strange after father had so recently died, but I went with it because James made my mother very happy. Shortly after, I began my correspondence with Hosmer Angel.”
“Thank you, and good luck,” she sighed, then she got up and left. Sherlock watched her leave all the way out the door before turning to John.
“Yes, you?” Sherlock responded looking up.
“Tea,” John replied immediately.
“Her mother recently-ish remarried. Soon after, her correspondence with Hosmer Angel begins. Now tell me that doesn’t sound like a fake name,” Sherlock smirked with John following suit. “Her new stepfather works for the Federal Identity Commission. That is an extremely easy job in which you can create a fake identity if you desired, though it is technically illegal, so it’s automatically fishy.”
Casualties: an innocent carton of milk and my sanity.
John only stumbled to his feet, knocking the table in the process, whats-her-name's glass of red wine knocking over and spilling down the front of her skimpy cream dress. She let out an exaggerated squeal, one that sounded like it had been rehearsed for years, and threw the most burning glare John had ever received in his life.
“This is not negotiable, Sherlock”
He dug the infernal pager out his pocket and felt his heart rate spike. "John Standish" A street very far away from Baker Street and rather near this snooty restaurant.
Well that was half true. John had all but rammed down the front door
Why he felt he should be protecting Mrs. Hudson was beyond him. Her kindness had disarmed him. He couldn’t recall the last time someone had offered him tea without expecting money in exchange.
He supposed it was too late at night to call Sarah and ask her for a drink. He found that very few of his girlfriends accepted his running out on dinner dates to stop an idiot from bleeding to death and leaving them with the bill. He would have offered to pay for it if they stopped deleting his number. Sarah may be his last chance at getting laid. Being a leaper herself, she would understand.
He had invited John to look at a severed head in his fridge. Surely murderers don’t invite witnesses to their own crime scene. Do they?
Sherlock quirked his lips a little, raking his eyes over john as if he were a prize. "I did, just now."
“Unwise, brother mine.”
"But?" Came the echoed reply
What was that about?
However, his brother had kept his end of the bargain despite Sherlock’s second thoughts. There was the head in the fridge to prove it. He had originally requested it in order to practise removing the tiny chip in his head but decided he might as well determine the coagulation of saliva after death first.
John froze. Soldier. His adrenaline was still flowing through veins and had just increased tenfold after hearing this strange man repeat that little detail. Soldier. He was still hovering by the door when Sherlock slumped into a dark armchair by the fire and gestured to the one sitting opposite him.
"So who are you? And I'm not asking for your name, obviously, but what do you do?"
"Ok you've got questions." Sherlock sighed after a weighted silence.
"Sherlock I can only give you two more minutes-" Lestrade, from across the crime scene, began before he was silenced by a raised palm. Sherlock turned his attention back to John, who had regained the ability of speech.
"Found anything?" Said a very tired looking Molly, coming back into the mortuary, two steaming cups in hand.
John jumped back, his knees hitting the coffee table and his ass all but collapsed onto it. That voice. Sherlock sat up, uncurling himself from the foetal position and fixed John with his glassy pale stare. His eyes were somehow unfocused and painfully sharp at the same time. His hair even more ruffled than last time.
Well “I’d offer you a tea dear but it seems we have just run out of milk” She assaulted the puddle on the floor with an army of paper towels. John stood back to give her room, grateful for an excuse to look away from the most intense stare anyone had given him. “Do you mind tea without milk?”
"Oh god, oh god I'm so sorry" John began rambling, throwing the waiters a desperate look. They arrived en scene with napkins and silly french accents John was sure none of them really owned.
“Sherlock”
Did not read through this, haha not sorry
“I’m sure something will come up Sherlock. A nice murder. That will cheer you right up.” She replied, smiling as she poured his tea into a white China cup.
"Aren't you going to turn that off?" She asked a frozen John with very mild irritation.
He rolled out of bed, eyeing the bathroom longingly. He would not risk a hot shower on the morning of the trial. He was so wired, he would probably run out of his room without any clothes on if that infernal device beside his bed so much as made a peep.
(See the end of the chapter for
The receptionist, a surly looking man in his fifties, accepted the card after giving John a once over with the odd expression still on his face. John ignored him in favour of glancing around. The hotel was dingy, the nicest word John could give it. He felt a thrill go through him at the sight of ne’er-do-wellers lingering about the lobby. This was simply a Petri dish of criminal behaviour, despite being situated on Baker Street. The exterior of the building blended in nicely but the interior looked like it had once been akin to something fancy and had fallen on hard times.
“Excuse me?” John asked, bemused. For his first night on the job, things had gone rather strangely. He wondered if he had the right address.
His day was spent pacing in front of the pager for hours, turning it on every now and then to make sure it was charged and in working order. He then proceeded to clean his ears, pacing to the window in case there was someone housebreaking across the road.
Every time John had found the sleek black phone, Sherlock had opened his eyes and gave him an approving sort of smirk, as if he were merely testing John, rather than making it his life's mission to annoy him. This rather annoyed john. More annoyingly was that he had no idea how he was continuously being summoned to a perfectly peaceful flat, with no aggravated housekeepers in sight. He would have to try and replace his pager, there was something obviously wrong with it. Or it had somehow been hacked.
Sherlock's eyes followed John's line of sight and smirked. "Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, she's giving me a special deal. Owes me a favour. Few years ago her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out."
A few weeks later and John now found himself without money or food. Again. His army pension had gone to prolonging his stay at this ridiculously overpriced hotel and the leftover Chinese had only stretched over a little while. Now his stomach was demanding attention as he sat cross-legged on his bed watching the continued debate on the telly.
Dammit. He berated himself. There was just something so difficult about being professional at one in the morning. Especially with his boss being rather temptingly attractive.
“I’ll take a cup too Mrs. Hudson. Two sugars.”
"Time of death?" Sherlock queried, glancing up at John rather than Lestrade. John sighed and decided to just get this over with. He pulled out the pager and scrolled to the most recent alert. Sherlock stood and went back to hovering over John's shoulder, very much in his personal space.
"What do I think?" John hissed incredulously. All he wanted was a date that didn't end in stained dressed, that ended up in bed with a pretty blonde and maybe, just maybe, to sleep past 4am without being dragged out of bed to hand someone a phone that was sitting mere metres away from their hand.
John nodded approvingly. Less stairs to run down. He was a little surprised his card was approved. He hadn’t even checked the going price for a room. Or his bank account. Sarah’s promise of riches still echoing in his mind from the week before. That and the image of her in that lovely top, her hair slightly messy in what John’s mind supplied to be scandalously mussed. He imagined that’s what it would look like after he had run his hands through it.
He flicked his eyes over the pale man standing at the window. There seemed to be something familiar about him. His expression was that of surprise, not panic.
"Yeah, we're we going?"
“I am not having that thing anywhere near me. I don’t need your ‘concern’ to get any more invasive than it already is.” He stalked out of the kitchen, stepped around large stacks of papers and slumped into his leather chair. He picked up the Stradivarius that lived beside his chair and plucked a string continuously, glaring at his brother who was still staring at the kettle.
"What am I doing here, Sherlock seriously, what?" He muttered, making an exaggerated effort to remove his elbow from the loose grip. He was surprised to find the man's name on his lips, his thoughts drifting to how strange it felt to speak it out loud. Such an unusual name.
He stuffed the paper into pockets already full of other botched reports. He couldn’t just put down an elderly woman experiencing heart palpitations without a call for an ambulance. That would definitely lose him his job. So a little shock it was. Problem was, he couldn’t put it down to severed body parts.
“Room 47, second floor”
"But the police don't consult amateurs"
“Are you ok miss? Are you currently experiencing chest pain?” He approached carefully, speaking in what Mike called his doctor voice. He paused at the edge of the milk lake to gently take her wrist, examining her rapid pulse.
Not moving.
"Of the body. You were an army doctor, were you not? Surely you've seen plenty of violent deaths before" Sherlock's mouth twitched as John bristled by that statement.
"Move along, this is a crime scene mate" The hand on his elbow dissipated his thoughts and he let himself be shuffled further away from the police tape when a baritone voice cut through John's half-hearted apology.
“Sorry sir, but we’ve had one too many people staying and then ditching without paying.”
"You stopped her husband being executed?"
And once again, John was left staring after Sherlock with even more questions than before. His only consolation was that Molly, who he had only just been introduced to that night (or early morning), looked just as bewildered.
That man...Sherlock did she call him? Was he a murderer?
Oh glob oh glob oh glob. This is my first story! So scary! Thanks absolutely anyone who bothered reading it XD
221B Baker Street.
John flung himself onto the bed, his mind whirring like a machine.
It only took a few moments hesitation before John began the chase.
“No, a seven percent solution.”
"Yeah, he's always like that." Lestrade chuckled, silently relieved Sherlock's biting deductions hadn't been directed at him for once. "Come on, I'll need a statement from you."
"How do you feel about the violin?"
“Umm, I don’t know. Can I just pay whenever I leave?” John fidgeted slightly, his bag at his feet.
"Perfectly sound analysis but I was hoping you'd go deeper."
John stood staring at the mouth of the alley where Sherlock had just left. His mind worked furiously to process the rapid speech that had just assaulted his ears.
With a jolt he realised his program had ended and was now showing the late news. He glanced at his pager and to no surprise, there hadn’t been a distress call. Not that he would be able to miss the obnoxiously loud beeping from the device he was to keep on his person “at all times, John. Humanity depends on you. On us.”
Please just let me enjoy this break a little longer. GL
"Yes, yes yes!" Sherlock replied, spinning around to grin at John. "Tanned face but no tan above the wrists. That says abroad but not sunbathing"
“You’re Mrs. Hudson, right?”
She stood at the front of the room, hands on her hips and scanning the room severely. There had to be over fifty people sitting at the desks or leaning against the walls, some of them rubbing the sleep out their eyes or smoothing down hair. As John had arrived late due to a missing wallet and an embarrassing ride back to his bedsit in order to pay the cabbie, he was right at the back of the room, craning his neck over shoulders and cursing his height. Sarah nodded to an IT technician sitting at the computer to her left who turned on a projector. An image of the human body appeared on the whiteboard behind her.
"You didn't tell me exactly where."
“You’re a leaper” a baritone voice cut through the kitchen.
John felt right at home. Sort of.
John didn’t blame them for their motives for joining but was sceptical at the newcomer’s abilities. Having a bunch of greenhorns at the beginning of a national trial would not give good results. It’s as if the whole world was watching to see the test crash and burn so that the country would become the laughing stock of the world.
“Of what?”
Of course none of John's lectures elicited a response from the detective (except a small "oof" when the cushion collided with his nose). He just simply waited with his palm held out expectantly until John huffed in frustration and stormed back down those 17 steps.
"What?" What's-her-name squawked with a more natural sounding shrill. Even the waiters paused their fussing to stare at John in disbelief.
"Jesus Christ!! You wanted me to taste his blood??"
"Oh no I ensured it." And with sudden agility, Sherlock got to his feet and went into the kitchen. John heard the unmistakable click of a kettle being turned on. He followed after, leaning against the doorframe of the kitchen watching the other man raid the cupboards.
He glared up at Sherlock, definitely not noticing the way his irises were ensconced by a golden ring that gave his icy blue eyes an exotic green tint….
"Your haircut and the way you hold yourself says military but you're also a leaper, so trained in medicine. An army doctor. Obvious! And the glands have no tumors, therefore the conclusion is, John was murdered."
Sherlock was gone.  I started.  A firm hand pressed me back into my chair.
My phone sounded far too loud in the silent kitchen.
Sherlock focussed on the branch.  “You’ll have two of him by the river steps,” he said.  “If you help Archie tend the cuttings, they’ll grow faster.”  He reached out and stroked the branch.
I remained standing.
That’d be some nasty sibling rivalry.
“Our fellow isn’t here,” John murmured.
I locked the gate properly and I hoped no one had taken advantage of its being unlocked for nearly an hour.
“You’re not the only one that can hear people thinking, you know,” John said.
“Rose,” he said.
“But he never used my knife.”  Sherlock flipped the dagger again.  “Until now.”
“Passed some sort of battle in the hallway on the way in,” I said.
His bow moved across the violin’s strings and I thought I could hear music.
“What…”  A rush of air ruffled my hair.  I looked up as a tail passed so close above my head that I could see the texture of the fur along its length and the iridescent feathers with which it was tipped.  The downbeat of enormous wings blew something bright towards me.   Reflexively, my hand darted out and closed about it.
Sherlock’s hands twisted at his wrists as though they would fly away.
I opened my eyes.  “As good as tea?”
My feet barely touched the stairs, so rapid was my descent.  I started to smile as I pushed the half open door wide.   I could smell the wood burning, hear the fire crackling.
“I always knew that,” Sherlock said, throwing me his phone and sitting down in front of his laptop.  “Passenger lists, John.”
“Oh,” Sherlock said, standing up behind me.  “Ask him to come up then.”
“Cause and time of death?”
He wouldn’t have asked me to do it, if they were going to drag me in and drown me.
In his own good-natured way, Mike is an insistent fellow.
“Their mother had inherited ‘significant’ jewellery from her grandmother when they were children.  Their older sister had been given her share as a wedding present and they had been told that the rest would be theirs on their wedding days, but those days had never come and the whole matter was forgotten until their mother was on her deathbed and trying to tell them where the keys to the safe deposit boxes in their names were located, but didn’t have the strength to get all the details out before she fell unconscious and then died.”
I stood.  A bit of exercise on the steps might be what I needed to jostle my thoughts into a less libidinous path.
Don’t push it.  Be happy I’m eating.
I was out of my chair and looking over the banister from the landing in an instant.  Mrs Hudson was at the foot of the stairs.  “Mrs Turner’s cut her hand.  There’s blood everywhere.”
“Your swan has attacked someone before,” Sherlock said.
She tilted her head downwards, eyes narrowed, as I have so often seen Sherlock do, and looked from Sherlock to me and back.  With an icy fingertip, she tapped my cheek.  “Heal well,
“No, no, she likes to breath,” he said and dropped the collected stones into my palm.  “And she’s not…crumbling.”
“That was rather nice,” I said, holding my arms out and rotating them a little and twisting my wrists.  I rubbed my fingertips over my palms.  “It felt…”  I considered my hands.  “I’ve felt…”
Sherlock tugged at my sleeve and I took another step.
A moment later, the door opened a little.  Ms Swann reached out and stroked the swan’s neck.  He stretched his neck up until his head could curl about her neck.  The door opened wider.  The swan walked inside.
I could hear the effort expended to speak each word.  Details could wait.
Flew, for all I know.  Maybe there was an army of them waiting in the music room, on the gallery stairs, in the shadows, behind the curtains.
I stood, even though it didn’t bring us eye to eye.
“How does it feel?”
“Witnesses?” Sherlock asked, slipping away.  He stopped beneath the spot-lighted body, looking up to study the way it was wedged between the steel cables, one leg dangling, the metal digging into the soft flesh of the ensnared torso, unprotected now by its carapace.
Sherlock strode out the door.  A panel was open next to the fireplace on the landing when I joined him.
“Breathe,” he said to himself and tried to follow his instructions.  “Breathe, John.”
I felt his shoulder brush against mine.  “Yes, John?” he whispered back.
The light grew brighter, which encouraged me further.  The notion that it might be held by some hostile hand had crossed my mind until it had begun blinking the name Lestrade at me in Morse code.
I was puzzled, but forbore asking another intrusive question.
Lady Holmes sighed and walked away, towards the faint glow of our design.  “Yes.”  She stopped at the edge of the pattern.
Mycroft inclined his head.
“I have tattoos?”  I peered down my chest.  I didn’t see anything except a bit of shine where the skin was wet.
Sherlock held them up and jingled them.  He was in the middle of my dreary, little room turning slowly.  He grabbed my laptop from the side of the desk and tossed it on the bed.  “You handle that,” he said and dropped my keys next to it.
“The blood will take care of it all,” he replied.
“Where to?” I asked.
“Had he been in attendance?” I asked.
~~~~~~oo0oo~~~~~~
“You were sleeping very soundly and I’m very skilled with a blade.”
"Definitely the shower for us, right now," Sherlock said, looking over my shoulder into the library.
The carriage door opened.
Back I went to the other side.  I uncapped his water bottle, drank half of it, poured a few drops in my palm and rubbed it over my face.
Behind me, Mrs Hudson closed the front door.  I heard a bolt slide shut and the sounds of the street disappeared.  I looked back.  The inside of the door was not ordinary.  Its surface was deeply carved with flowers and fruit.  Half-hidden faces peered out from amidst the wooden foliage.  Above them the glow of the streetlamp illuminated the frosted orb at the centre of the fanlight.
“Did you see?” I demanded.
Let’s just say, I’m ready for one.
The door swung wide.  The last of the sun was pouring in the rear windows, gilding the furniture and reflecting off the lighter colours in the parts of the murals it reached.  John set the warm bag on the side table by the arm chair he favoured and opened one of the front windows.  The air was fresh from the day’s rain and milder than it had been in a week.  He hung up his green jacket, slipped off his shoes and retrieved a beer from the sideboard.  His domain might be small, but in it, all was well.
My feet gave twinges of protest, but I set upon the dinner with renewed gusto so we could get back to it and had nearly emptied my plate when two sharp raps reverberated through the door.
Kit found a knot hole for his torch and began searching the ground on his side of the verge.  After a minute, he held his hand out towards me.  In his palm, was an acorn.
I took hold of his arm and shuffled forwards.  "The cart's just behind me," I said.
“You did.”
The heavy stick was set aside, a notebook withdrawn from a coat pocket and set open upon the stone.  Something else was placed beside it which I could not clearly see, a pencil, I supposed.
“Good, good.  We wouldn’t want to be in Arabia or Khartoum before winter, although Persia in late autumn after Florence and Venice should be pleasant,” Holmes continued.
My eyebrows shot up.
He pointed to each of us in turn.  “Just make sure you come back from Marseille with all your internal organs in place.”
He inclined his head in that graceful way of his.
The footpath was nearly empty.  The man bumping into him set off alarum bells.
I did not move; it seemed I could not.  I simply closed my eyes and inhaled the fragrance of him.
It didn’t happen.  But after the third circuit, Sherlock leaned so close to John his lips touched his ear and whispered, “Focus on the balcony.”
“Yes.”  I shut my eyes then, so he wouldn’t see.  Which is ridiculous because it is nigh impossible to hide something from Sherlock Holmes, unless perhaps one has hidden it from oneself as well.
“It’s like a miniature peacock,” I said, “What is it?”
King Oberon looked up from the scrolls Mycroft was showing him when Puck skipped into the clearing.  He set a box Mycroft recognised down in the middle of the document he and his father had been discussing.
“There’s fresh-baked gingerbread,” she replied, gesturing with her head, hands full of tea and biscuits.
Sherlock stepped in after me, arms extended to either side, hands describing waves.
She stepped back into the hall and gestured for me to come in.  “It’s fine.  Sherlock called to say he might be delayed, so there'll be time for a cup of tea while you wait.”
A recipe for fairy gold?
A ewer of steaming cider and a plate of spice cakes appeared next to the candle.  “Drink up, lad,” she said.  “That’s an old family recipe.  The cold winds of winter are as nothing if you have a bellyful of that.”
Sherlock was leaning over me.
John turned and caught Sherlock’s slight nod.
“Shock and blood loss between 21:00 and midnight,” Molly replied.
“It didn’t look like this from the roof,” I gasped.
I gave him another tart and watched him eat.
The man bowed slightly then, taking one of Sherlock’s hands in both of his and raising it to his lips.  It did not look like an act of obeisance to me and then he began to croon as his lips hovered over Sherlock’s skin.
“Vernet?  I’m not familiar with that label,” I said simply to say something.  I am not a connoisseur of wine, but the hand-written labels on the wines we had had with our first dinner came to mind.
One by one, I changed the places where my clutching hands held the fabric of his jacket and slid along the bench towards the other side of the skiff.  The boat creaked as he shifted his weight.
“The clothes took the worst of it,” he said, finally sitting up.
“Yes, Speedy’s is part of the Manor,” she said.
Sherlock smiled.  “It must be catching.”
“It is what it is,” he murmured.
He handed off the torch and scampered after them, his freed hand on Midnight’s back to steady her on his shoulder, his other arm around the fallen oak's branches he had gathered.  He caught up with his brother and Wiggins just before all three were swallowed by the throng around an oak such as I have never seen.
He reached across the ledge, fingers outstretched and curved.  When he pulled them back from the wall, they were dark with clay.  He scraped it off with a knife into something in front of him that I couldn’t see.
She turned the card over and put it on the table.  “I should be getting ready.  Mrs Turner has a cousin visiting and they need a fourth for bridge.”  She smoothed the front of her skirt when she stood.  “Seems to be the day for cards,” she said and hurried away.
Holmes poured a glass of port for each of us, handed me one and settled into his chair, long legs stretched out before him.
Greg reached out for the lapel of Mycroft’s waistcoat and slid his thumb and index finger down the brocade.  “Lovely fabric,” he said.
Sherlock grinned.  “Those fortunes have something of a cult following in the neighbourhood.”
“No, he disappeared.  He’d stopped right in the middle and was looking over the railing at what turned out to be this building,” I said.  “I was across the road by the pub and between one blink of my eyes and the next, he was gone.”
“She’s distracting Father while she thinks,” Mycroft said, rapping on the table in front of him.  “Let’s test your box with the key.  Perhaps you’ve not found the correct one.”
Their flame grew and they stepped backwards.
He could leave John’s head uncovered, so he could taste that red mouth, sting about its edges, drink a tear if John cried.  He would shout, Sherlock supposed.
The flame at the far end of the room became a star.
What if it’s contaminated, too?
Inside a bell rang, a cool, silvery sound.
“We didn’t mean to startle you, dear, come sit.”  Mrs Hudson patted the table next to her.
“Bored,” Sherlock growled from a branch high above Mycroft’s head.
“But you don’t entirely rule it out.”
His strokes were long and powerful and he kept us in the centre of the river, turning the boat when the incoming tide carried us too far west.  He was keeping us abreast of the Tower, the boat rocking with his manoeuvres.  I clutched the gunwales to hold myself in place.  I cast a glance at the roiling waters; they had gained a rusty hue.
She stopped at the head of the stairs and raised an eyebrow at me.  “It could have been that the person transcribing the recipe from some other document forgot that bit, or the original document was damaged and that part was missing, but my guess is that they left it out on purpose.”
The violin resumed.  A line of violet light appeared ahead.
John opened his eyes.
“If they did, it seems they didn’t tell tales.  No one was disinherited.  No evidence of annulments or divorces, forced or otherwise.”
“’They stole little Bridgit, for seven years long…’  Well, no one stole ‘little Bridgit’, she came on her own and didn’t even think about going back for ‘seven years long’.  That song always irritated me.”  Mrs Hudson stirred honey into her tea rather vigorously.  “The fae folk always get blamed when it’s people running away, wishing themselves away.”  She set her spoon on her saucer.  “Mind you, if anyone was going to steal someone, it would have been Sherlock stealing you, but he didn’t, did he?”
I don’t know.
“Where are we exactly?” I asked when Dean Bradley had left us.  The vaulted chamber enclosing us was large and suffused with the fragrance of roses and spring flowers.  There was no natural light, only the candle flames that flickered over the cold stone that shut us in on every side.  I ran my hands along the joins between the blocks, reading the names and dates of Usher after Usher, and those they had married, that were carved into the rock.  “They feel old,” I said.
“Yes, ma’am,” Kit replied and did as he was told.
Mycroft batted it away before it landed on him.  “There’s something you could do for me that you might find entertaining,” he said.
I wrenched my gaze back to the pad balanced on my knee and drew a long upward line.
“But it didn’t end there.  Several unsolved murders in the following years were blamed on this book.”
The moonlight entering through the open flaps of the pavilion cast shadows over his face.  The eyes were dark hollows, the round of the prominent brow ivory.
Sherlock groaned softly, “Millennium Bridge.”  He slumped sideways onto the mattress, hand around the phone.
“She didn’t remind you?”
I closed one hand at his hip, pressed his head against my throat with the other.  “I sometimes dreamt that you had.”
On Hormead Road, everything still appeared calm.  Sherlock rang the bell with Swann printed next to it.  The person who picked up the answerphone did indeed sound like Ms Swann.
I didn’t miss a beat.
By the time we had completed a full circuit and reached our campfire once again, the aroma of Bert and Charlie roasting some type of meat over the flames was most welcome. Wiggins was sharpening small sticks and Archie was skewering chunks from a mound of raw meat and herbs laid out on brown paper spread upon the grass.  Kit was selecting suitable sticks from a pile of kindling that was even bigger than it had been when we left.  Midnight had his own chunk of meat that he was devouring raw to an accompaniment of satisfied sounds.
“Sherlock helped me with that.  Came all the way to Florida and I don’t think the case was that interesting.  He’s such a good boy,” she said.
A murmur rose from the crowd and I remembered that there were other people with us.
I took a quick sip, keeping an eye on Siròc, but she stayed high above the oak.  I took a longer drink and handed it back.
“…ghost?” I finished.
“I’m so sorry,” Ms Swann declared as she joined John.  “One of my colleagues, anxious about our next project getting started in earnest.  It can take over one’s life.  One has to turn it off sometimes.”
“I thought you’d rather be closer,” John said as they mounted the steps.
From the east, a breeze blew cool across his back.  John lifted his head.  Above the horizon, there was stripe of white.  A band of deep blue separated it from the jet black sky above.  He could not keep his head up.  He shifted his hips forward and moaned, every bite tingling at the contact.  He lowered his head to the slick skin between Sherlock’s wings.
John lifted both hands in surrender and Ms Swann slid the door back into place and locked it.
He opened his mouth to offer an apologetic sort of explanation but was cut short when the door slammed open and there stood a rather short man with alert, dangerous eyes.
Criminal activity: A lunatic called Sherlock
Regardless, once over her initial shock, she didn’t seem all too surprised at his behaviour.
Then John remembered his purpose for being here in the first place. “What was in this?” He demanded, pointing to the broken needle at his feet.
His deep voice resonated in his head. John felt a stab of shame. He was notoriously bad at remembering faces. Even harder was to put names to the faces. He had once offered to walk his girlfriend's dog after running out on a dinner date to an emergency before realising she didn't even have a dog because that had been the last one. Needless to say he had not gotten laid that night. Or any night since. Granted that had been three weeks ago and John was definitely feeling the effects of sexual frustration. He needed a good shag or a decent criminal act that did not involve severed appendages in fridges places by a familiar looking local psychopath.
Lestrade's eyes widened as they flicked from john to the small phone like device in his hand. "Oh you're the leaper that was signalled, right?"
He would've kicked himself if he hadn't been walking so fast. He should have hitched a ride with Molly, maybe even gone back to her place to crash. Maybe gotten to know her better. Maybe could've cooked her breakfast the next morning ...well, later this morning.
John had joined the Leaper force a month after his return from Afghanistan, after a long bout insomnia. His sleeping cycle was interrupted by dreams of sand and blood anyway, what was a few persistent beeps in his ear compared to that?
"So…"
Well this could be very nice John thought.
Sherlock sighed and turned to look out the windows of the cab, blatantly ignoring John.
The woman seemed to pull herself out of her initial shock at seeing a stranger intrude into the flat to query her health.
"He's with me"
John had switched the channel back to his nightly hospital drama, swearing to himself that he didn’t care for glory. If anyone did deserve it though, it was Mike. John had been unable to find a bad bone in his body, making him all the more intolerable. Nevertheless he agreed to a celebratory drink when his fellow worker texted him during the commercial break.
He stuffed the little phone pager into his pocket and set off at jog towards a busier street in search of a cab.
John sprang up, his dinner splattering on the linoleum floor with the cracked pieces of china. He snatched up the pager that was going wild with loud shrieking beeps. His heart continued the furious rhythm even after shutting off the sound and squinting at the name and address of his newest adventure. His adrenaline began to dissolve into dread.
"Coming?" He called back
Well until the next Thursday at 2:06am.
“The chip that will be implanted in every British citizen measures the subjects cortisol and epinephrine levels. Should it reach a certain level, this will transmit a signal to a Leaper or police officer in a certain radius. So far we have only been able to extend the signal as far as one kilometre. Our plan is to expand it to ten. That is, however, still being worked on. Now this is where we have been experiencing difficulties.” She turned back to the room, the next slide showing a close up of a small microchip. She sighed. “This is, of course useless unless we are able to pinpoint where the signal is originating. The plan to implant a GPS into the chip is cause for major concern. People are going to object, obviously. Well it’s only a small step. Mobile phone’s are essentially GPS’ already, it’s just not expressed as blatantly.”
“We need to act immediately,” Mycroft says shortly, “My brother could be in grave danger. They don't last long in solitary at Bedlam.”
on my lawn.”
The nurse brings him more mush.
“Cash?” John said skeptically. “I'll need an ID, then.”
Watson's heart is pounding.
It is not until two days later that Holmes starts to full recover.
“Kind of ironic,” John said softly, eyes on the abandoned cribbage board.
So he was gay, then. Seemed kinda stupidly obvious now that John thought about it.
He sits with his back pressed against the cold wall. It is very cold here, and he has made heat out of folding in on himself, hugging his knees.
He quietly retreated to his car. Once he was in the front seat, the nerves got the best of him and he started it and sped away quickly, looking behind his shoulder even as he made the walk to his door.
“Wondering why I'm open so late? Bit curious?”
“Yes, Holmes, you are home.”
“Mr. Holmes, sir, news for you from Bethlehem.” He scarcely even remembers the asylum's true name, as opposed to it's crude, more commonly used nickname.
“You 'ave a visitor,” he says, not looking at Holmes. Holmes stands and grips the bars eagerly.
“Friends,” Irene clarified.
“Cheated on you while you were service?” he said in shock. John shrugged, the memory of Mary sour in his mouth.
“Don't give him any trouble, he'll leave soon.”
“You'll figure it out,” she said.
It was all he could afford with the cash from his tag sale and brother's life insurance—after his travel expenses—and, of course, his biggest purchase of all, Fernsby Motel.
Always Yours, John
“So do you have one then?” John asked awkwardly, picking up his cup.
He reeked of illegal activity. John wondered if he should just call the police, or if that would be too drastic.
The thought gave him a type of excitement he hadn't felt in the past sixth months.
The man who stepped inside was sandy haired, a bit short, well built, attractive. His style was a bit bland, earth tones and jeans and a pair of boots.
The Yard take care of their investigation quietly, despite the public's demand for information. It comes time that the Yard must question both men.
Watson smiles at the teasing.
“Please sir, he is 90 years old,” the man says, but the guard ignores it.
It was one reason he didn't like to drink like this anymore.
“Coming!” he said, even though they probably couldn't hear. Putting the book back on the shelf, he hurried down the stairs and to the door.
He no longer has the strength to clutch his arm. Blood is dripping down his whole body.
Holmes ponders it. Then, he smiles, and faces Watson.
“Ah.”
“Of course, my dear doctor. Stay away from danger while I am gone. And stay away from gambling.”
He tries not to think of those two lonely, desolate years. It was many a time he slept in a place like this then—endured things unspeakable, things, to this day, he would never tell John. Leaving for two years is his biggest regret. He hopes he is making up for it now.
“Of course, it's no trouble. Sit, please. Cigar?”
Then they set the house on fire and fled.
, Year of our Lord 1895, at 1300 hours. Court dismissed.”
They take Elijah and Miss Carpenter away frequently, and they return tired or shaking or bruises or all, and often days later. Holmes tries not to pry too far into what they experience, but he still asks and writes it down. What they describe is so grotesque it is difficult to do so.
Rocks.
John suddenly felt that he was in tremendous danger, witnessing something evil that he was not supposed to see.
He must share a bunk with another man, something that causes him mild anxiety. He knows he is strong enough to hold his own against most of the men here, but he fears he could be overpowered if several people targeted him. It is entirely possible he will be recognized. He chooses to stay alert.
ever since he'd first stumbled upon it that night. He couldn't quite get the awkward florist out of his head.
The place had come with all the furniture, so at least he didn't have to worry about that. He walked up the creaky stairs to the second floor and peered into the master bedroom.
“Inspector Lestrade,” Mycroft says languidly. “Thank you for coming on such short notice. Please, have a seat.”
Hi! So I was asked if I'd consider double spacing to make it easier to read, but I'm not sure I can copy and paste it and have it still be double-spaced, and there isn't an option for it in here. So I don't know if this will be double-spaced or not, but if it is, please let me know whether or not you prefer it.
“Yeah. Said it was a “misunderstanding” and that “when I went away she thought we were done.” Well, we kept correspondence until I found out. Was all teary when I left, too. But—“ He shrugged again, rather uncomfortable. Sherlock just nodded. Violet brought in the tea and set it in front of them.
“Good good, Dr Watson and I will meet you there.”
“I will. Good luck, John. If you need me, don't hesitate to ask.”
“I've read Doctor Watson's stories,” Elaine says eagerly.
He looks around, and there is no broiling feels in his gut. His skin is a normal temperature, and he is able to hold his hands steady without trembling.
But there was one bit of life shining through that school that he has always remembered, and that was Priest Wentworth.
“No, he hasn't left the room,” she told him earnestly. “Won't let me in either, of course. One of the Danvers men, I'm sure.”
make sure that that does not happen, or it will result with both of them in prison.
Things were tense, but they pushed through, thinking that if they kept to themselves, perhaps the rest of the town would lay off.
They take Mycroft's private carriage to 221b, Holmes, Watson, and Mycroft, that is. Lestrade and the force, meanwhile, deal with more legal matters at the asylum.
He was awake for the rest of the night.
“Under investigation for what?” he manages finally.
More shock. This time Holmes is nearly sick on the floor. He squeezes his eyes shut.
“You cannot be near me,” he realizes, and the moment is a fresh horror, but Watson just gives him a small, sad smile.
“I think that would be the best course of action. Take precautions. I don't think he'll bother you much longer.”
He dreams of getting out.
Watson slowly begins to rouse from his deep slumber, looking at Holmes in confusion.
“Yeah, well, er, there's someone staying at my motel and, erm. . .” John shook his head, scratching the back of his neck. “Sorry, this was stupid, I should just call the police, I'll, erm—“
Holmes knows, and the knowledge burdens him, that Watson will have it explained to him what Holmes has said.
They leave Bedlam behind.
He lifts it, and it is still there, crinkled and wet with sweat.
“Humph. Well, you can changes the details. You always do,” Holmes says.
Sherlock turned away from the plant at this abrupt change of subject.
Watson does not come for the first three days.
She wasn't, apparently, as clever when it came to finding a suitable partner, because it seemed whatever boyfriend she picked up inevitably disappointed her. Maybe she'd try girls for a bit.
John was please to see that new guests were pouring in every day, and everyone seemed to be very much enjoying themselves. After that night at Sherlock's, (he couldn't exactly recall everything that happened, or, erm, most of it) he didn't see much of the man, and when he did, it was slightly awkward. They danced around each other like they'd had a bad one night stand rather than a blackout-drunk, two-person party.
He is holding out a bowl of gruel.
It smells of urine and vomit.
“Yeah, she is.”
Watson nearly crumples, and Holmes can see his face fall, can see the pain manifest inside him.
It is some weeks before he hears from Miss Carpenter and Mr Smith—that is, until one afternoon there is a knock on the door.
“It's rainy today. I fear the weather will only grow colder as the day goes on. I hope for sunshine tomorrow.”
He had a local source he could confide in.
“At 10 AM?” John said.
Then John would inevitably go find him, wandering around some lonely alley, already having forgotten he called. Birthdays were never a good time for Harry.
Over the next several weeks, Holmes prepares himself for court.
So there are people who love them, despite who they are. They have friends, people who care about them, are ready to stand behind them if need be.
When they reach the door, one of the guards shoves him in front of it.
Holmes walks away with a bit more relief, a bit less pain on his chest, a bit more hope in his heart.
“Who?” he barks.
“It's a Danvers man, then. Danvers Paper.”
“I am guilty, Mycroft.”
“Yes, and you are going to help me.”
“His ID said Danvers is his last name.”
he remembers foggily. He wants to know if they are dumping them. He must stay awake and find out.
“We've got a sick one!” she shrieks.
“Oh, it's all because of Sherlock. That's where I get them, you know,” she humbled. “Have you been?”
“One moment!” he cried, then quickly returned the hive to it's normal state and left the greenhouse.
Everything he usually took for granted became a fresh wonder to him. Hot tea and food, and warm water, and clean clothes. It seems almost too good to be true.
John watched the man's back as he crept down the gravel path to 23A.
It is for humiliation. Nothing more. They do not believe this will heal him. They want to break him.
Jennings is several yards behind him, playing the part of severely disturbed man with astonishing commitment. He bursts into laughter and weeping at random, and murmurs of a dead wife. He does not talk to Holmes, or anyone, instead taking in his eyes a look of utter otherness, like he is not even seeing them.
“He's been bitten by something,” he pants. The sight of Holmes in this state clouds his mind, but he needs to focus on stabilizing him.
“I'm so sorry, they don't normally sting, I swear—“
The doctor who had led them there nervously unlocks his cell door. Jennings steps out, brushing himself off.
“I'm fine,” he says, and wonders.
Irene shook her head, still grinning.
“Yes sir. What brings you here? Oh, please come in.”
“Sure, let's go.”
His symptoms banish slowly, but the first thing ti return is, of course, his sharpened mind. His mumblings and delusions disappear and he is once again his old self, griping about being bedridden and talking endlessly about any idle history he may.
The man shrugged, a bit too stiffly.
Then finally, on a Saturday afternoon, he is listening quietly to the heavy pattern of rain bouncing off the archaic walls when a guard walks over to him.
“'Ow long will ye be here?” Hugo rasps when Holmes enters his cell. Holmes fights back a gag at the man's odor.
John smiled.
“Are you okay?” he asks urgently. “What's wrong?”
Eventually, he decided he ought to confide in the local opinion.
Holmes sobs.
“You're two days early.”
Sherlock laughed softly, but it was true. They'd made that pact when they were twelve, and both of them would absolutely keep their end of the bargain if need be.
“I see you are as good as they say you are, Mr Holmes. Yes, indeed.” The man shifts, looking a bit somber. “I was doing well for myself, saving up to marry a lovely girl named Jane.” A small whispers briefly across his face. “But alas, she fell ill unexpectedly two years ago, and passed June of 1893. We were wed on her death bed.”
"Is that it then?" He asked
Any cases? SH
John decided he was beginning to miss Mr. Whiskers. He set his undrunk tea down and raised his palms up. “Look, I was called here on an emergency, if no one’s dying, I think I’ll be going now. Thank you for the tea” he added gently to Mrs. Hudson before stepping back through the door he had burst through. He descended the stairs much slower now that the call of danger had dissipated.
"I'm sorry, what?"
There was blood everywhere. All up the walls of the alley, spilling over the dumpster bins, illuminated by flashing blue lights and surrounded by uniforms all fluttering around like moths. In the centre of it all was a swishing black belstaff dancing around a slab of bloody meat. John supposed it was a corpse, however the expression on the curly-haired man's face couldn't be described as anything but glee.
Victim: Yes? Mrs. Hudson?
Recently though, John had just taken to slapping the phone onto Sherlock's palm none too gently, finding small satisfaction when he found it. Sometimes he found it under sinks, in the kettle, under the severed fingers in the fridge and once even in the pocket of the detective's purple shirt. The latter had him storming out again, if only to hide the unexpected grin suddenly making an appearance on his face.
The detective ignored his brother, his eyes flicking back to the lens of his beloved microscope.
All leapers to report to Bart’s at earliest convenience. S
“The trials have been run and the project is go, and over the next month, British citizens will report to their nearest hospital for the implant. The microchips will not be activated until the first of May. During this time you will all be retrained to accomodate this new system. For those of you staying on, that is. Leapers will not be required to have a chip inserted, I’m afraid you’ll have to rely on the good old-fashion call to 999.”
He found a twisted truth in Sarah’s words however. The original method of sending a distress signal was to punch in a number on your phone. No one was waiting to answer the call, it didn’t even ring. It simply sent the location, alerting the closest leaper into action. John had found it thrilling at times, not knowing what to expect when arriving at the scene. It was arguably faster than emergency services but almost triple the danger. It could be a knife wielding serial killer in a darkened alley….or an evil mastermind cat up a tree, waiting to make your life miserable. The possibilities were endless. That was also why leapers were trained at basic defence. As an army doctor, the role had been made for John and the dangerous prospect only sweetened the deal. Well, it would, if he were living in a neighbourhood full of criminals with cat allergies.
“Shh! Mrs. Hudson is trying to sleep downstairs, although with the racket you made storming up here, I believe she has taken some herbal soothers ‘for her hip.’”
Sherlock paused in his movements, putting the mug he was holding on the table and let a small smile grace his lips. He placed his hands on the bench behind him and took a deep breath. "I know you’ve got a brother with a bit of money who’s worried about you, but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him, possibly because he’s an alcoholic, more likely because he recently walked out on his wife. And I know that your therapist thinks you're suffering from PTSD because of the war. Quite incorrectly, I'm afraid. I'd describe it as withdrawal. Why else would you apply for essentially the same job here in London? That’s enough to be going on with, don’t you think?"
"What do you think?" Sherlock retorted, opening a dumpster and peering inside.
Not indicating that he was even aware of John invading his sitting room.
"What do you think, doctor?" John jumped. He had forgotten how close Sherlock had been looming over his shoulder, his hand still gripping his elbow as if afraid John would run away.
Here was a date that had just ruined what looked like a very expensive dress and was now planning on ditching the responsibility with apparently no remorse whatsoever.
John shoved his face into the pillow, pushing the strange residents of 221 Baker Street from his mind as he fell asleep, leaving his pager in his jacket pocket for the first time.
He glanced across the road as if expecting a case of defenestration from one of the floors of the hotel. He was horribly disappointed. His phone buzzed insistently in his hand.
Little did he know pale eyes followed his short trip back to his hotel.
He switched the channel once he had a semblance of control over his giggles, realising that, for an outside observer, he would appear insane, laughing at the corpses on a 9pm hospital drama. For his occupation, it would appear deeply concerning to his superiors. He settled for a safe alternative on the comedy channel, despite finding it deeply lacking in humour. He soon found his gaze wandering to the crack in the plaster behind his telly. Six months after moving into the crummy bedsit and he still hadn’t made a slight impact. Everything still felt so temporary. Including the crack in the wall. He rather thought it looked like the crack in the wall from doctor who. As if his life as a leaper wasn’t exciting enough, he now found himself dreaming about monsters coming out of the walls.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. He slid out the microchip that had been under his microscope for the past ten minutes and slid it across the table, back to Mycroft. It was approximately the size of his pinky’s fingernail.
Sherlock gave him a sharp look. "That's right, they don't"
