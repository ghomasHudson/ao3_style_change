“Mr. Winchester, how nice to see you.” The restaurant manager welcomes Dean with a smile, one that turns from surprise into cool professionalism in the space between one blink and the next. His hair is slicked back with pomade and his glasses are small and circular, giving him the appearance of some sort of twitchy rodent. “My sincere apologies, I was informed by your brother that you weren’t dining with us tonight. I’ll have the waiters set you a place at the table.”
He hates events like this. He's not cut out for them. He's a mechanic, granted the business is his own and he does well out of it, but he's more at home in his battered jeans and band shirts than in suits and fancy hotels. But he's also a supportive boyfriend and tonight is about Amara, not him. No matter how much he'd like to be at home on the couch.
“Well, how about I do dinner tonight and you can relax? The boys can help me. You know how Billie is starting to enjoy cooking.”
“How long is your lunch hour?” Her voice has changed tone now, dropped to something low and husky and it
He doesn't know what to do to help his twin, but he does know that contacting Dean would only push Cas further away from him. Cas has been betrayed by people in the past, Dean included, and adding himself to that list of people could break them forever. It may be a price he's willing to pay in the future, but that day hasn't come yet. For now, he's wallowing in his own misery and doing a damn fine job of it.
Gabriel is rarely sentimental so the statement had floored Castiel for a long moment. He'd brushed it all off but now, now that Meg has left and he's alone in his office again, he can't help but think about what's waiting for him at home tonight after work. A chilly apartment above his shop. Mac and cheese for dinner. Maybe a beer if he feels like it. Cable TV. There
Castiel gives him a strange look, tinged with sadness, then drops his gaze to where their chests are almost meeting, and Dean frowns. Cas is all tense again, like he was in the shower when he was so cold, and that’s all kinds of wrong right now.
He lets himself out, draping his jacket over his arm, and enjoys his morning walk to the coffee shop. The sun is coming up, warming his skin. It’s going to be a nice day. He gets his coffee to go and spends the morning buried in his books, mind on nothing but his work. He forgets all about the charity event and the rude couple he'd haplessly stumbled upon.
Sam hadn’t been pushed into the river that night. Instead, they'd found a realtor the very next day and had moved in together within the month. Dean had crowed with superior, brotherly delight for him and Amara had been sweet and encouraging. Sam often wonders what changed, why the woman has now transformed into an ice queen when once upon a time she'd been nothing but gentle, affectionate and fun. He supposed people just change with age. Dean certainly has. He and Gabe probably have too, but only in good ways.
I've fought through an epic case of writer's block with this one, so TY to my beta for the support and encouragement! And apologies for the long wait for this chapter ♥
A short while later, there’s sweat on his forehead and upper lip, dripping down his spine, but he’s red-cheeked with happiness at the results of his hard work. Castiel will love this. He just
2) celebrated on December 25 and now generally observed as a legal holiday and an occasion for exchanging gifts.
Doe-eyed and frowning, Billie reaches up to put the camera back onto the table then he turns away, clearly sulking. The strap of the camera catches on his shoulder and Dean watches it happen in slow motion: the camera crashes to the wooden floor and breaks, glass from the lens and pieces of plastic skittering out around Billie who freezes in shock. For a heartbeat, there's total silence in the room.
God, he's so confused and freaked out. Cas’ voice catches on another sob and Dean does the only thing he knows how to do: pulls Cas’ face into his neck and they lie there on the beach, nude and covered in cooled sweat and sand, Cas clinging as he cries for a reason beyond Dean’s reach. All he can do is stroke his skin, pet his hair, hold him close and whisper to him as the waves crash upon the sand.
“No sugar until after dinner, kiddo. You know the rules.” Dean wipes his brow with the hand that isn't holding onto Lexie. The shop is swelteringly hot in spite of the air conditioning and he vehemently wishes he could leave and go home with Cas and the twins to enjoy the sea air.
The conversation had been brief, Gabriel’s words stilted and thick with grief, and Castiel had let the phone drop to the table and the screen shatter with unseeing eyes, his breathing laboured and feeling as though the blood in his veins had turned to ice.
“C’mon, Sammy.” Dean’s wheedling now, his voice taking on an irritating falsetto that sets Sam’s teeth on edge. “I’ll buy you a nice salad at Olive Garden. Look, there’s one right there. And a water. Whatever size you like. We’ve had a great time, no sense in spoiling it by staying out too long, huh?”
“Business,” Crowley says simply, snapping his fingers at a passing waiter. “More brandy for us both.”
“Sammy, what the fuck?” He’d asked once, after one too many beers. “I’m the luckiest guy in the world. Why the fuck do you keep insisting that I’m unhappy? Are you jealous or something?”
okay. Perhaps there’s some trouble in paradise and all Dean needs is a signal that it’s okay to talk about it.
He snaps his fingers sharply at the two younger men flanking the double doors, who immediately nod a small bow to Dean before vanishing into the restaurant. Dean waves away his apology, his blood singing with the shot of Scotch he’d quickly swallowed before leaving the room, and takes in his surroundings. Low lighting, the murmur of political and economic discussions, ladies laughing, the clink and chink of crystal glasses and china plates, and in the midst of it all - Sam. Sitting at a large circular table flanked by two men that Dean recognises from their introductions earlier, but can’t name, and with Jessica sitting opposite him, her blonde curls twisted into an artful style on the top of her head, jewels glinting at her wrists and decollete. She looks as bored by the whole debacle as Dean feels. And, two seats along from her, dark-haired and imperious: Ruby. Dean snorts quietly as the restaurant manager reappears with a dark-haired, dark-eyed waiter in tow. Both of them are dressed in black tie, shoes shined to perfection, and not a hair out of place.
And after a moment’s hesitation, other glasses are raised both around their table and at neighbouring tables as a multitude of passengers join in, and his words echo around the room.
Smirking at his brother and shrugging in a helpless fashion, Sam links arms with Jo and, laughing together at Dean’s grumbling and grousing that follows them close behind, begin to pick their way through the remainder of the crowd. The early evening sun is warm on his skin, and they cross the street to where the cop with the aviators and the deep summer tan is standing directing the crowd. Charlie’s red hair stands out, bouncing as she waves enthusiastically at them, and he’s sure he can see Benny in a leather vest, matching pants and not much else. For the hundredth time, he wonders why Dean and Benny aren’t still together. They’d seemed like such a great couple, but at the very least they’ve managed to remain friends somehow which he supposes counts for something. Sometimes he wonders if Dean still pines after Benny; he catches him staring at him sometimes with an odd, faraway look in his eyes.
“Yes, actually. And he seems… I just don’t want him to be…” Dean flounders, trying to express himself without confirming their suspicions of him being utterly lovesick. “Nobody should be alone on Christmas.”
He replies to Gabe, telling him that they'll barbecue and that Castiel can stay over if he likes, that he can make up the guest room. After all, he wants to appear the gracious host - if only for an hour before he starts interrogating the older man for information, for anything he can work with to try and help his brother.
Sam had seen the scorn in the petite blonde’s eyes as she’d regarded Amara. He’d definitely side with Gabe on this one.
He leans his forehead against the glass and thinks of them when they first met. Dancing together, laughing, eating out, long walks in the park, stargazing in Dean’s car. Her hair soft under his fingers and her lips even softer against his. Love and devotion in her eyes.
He sits in the office for a while, staring out of the window at nothing, picking idly at one of the healing scabs on his wrist until it bleeds. He’s entirely unaware that, across town, his brother is waiting to give him either a strict talking to or a firm ass-kicking. Whichever comes first.
“Hmm?” Sam has barely been listening, entirely distracted by the hubbub of noise and movement around him. Now, as a flash of dark hair cuts across his vision, followed by a waft of expensive fragrance, he catches on to Jack’s words. “Oh. Ruby, wonderful to see you again. So glad you could join us.”
Dean is possibly imagining it but he's sure there's a barely-suppressed note of irritation in Cas’ voice as he finishes speaking. Somehow, his relationship with Jimmy seems to have become a little strained over the last few weeks and Dean can't quite put his finger on why. He's not even certain that Jimmy has noticed. He's sure Cas isn't doing it on purpose, isn't being intentionally snappy with his brother or rolling his eyes behind Jimmy’s back whenever he says something Cas disagrees with. It started just before Dean’s workplace burned down and seems to be slowly getting worse. Dean’s been meaning to talk to Cas about it, to check in and make sure everything is okay, but he just hasn't had the time. He's been working all hours to get the bakery back on its feet and when he gets home either he's either exhausted or Jimmy is there.
He straightens again suddenly as the tone of his cousin’s voice sinks in. Gabriel is normally fun-loving and excitable and usually would never pass up the opportunity to laugh at Castiel’s expense. But today he sounded flat and emotionless, and his feeble attempt at a joke had fallen utterly flat. Castiel knew then that whatever reason Gabriel was calling him for, it wasn’t a good one.
“Dean, if you need Gabe and I to loan you some money then you know we will. All you have to do is ask.”
“You're damn lucky, Dean,” John had told him once as they shared beers outside on the porch of John’s house late one summer’s evening. “Your own business and a woman who loves you. Plenty of men would kill for less.”
Does she know something he doesn’t? The thought enters his mind along with an intense wave of terror so powerful that he staggers into the wall and clutches a hand to his diaphragm. It isn’t far to Lexie’s room now, just at the end of the corridor. Just a few more steps.
“Yeah,” Dean’s arm comes around Castiel’s waist. He can hear the kids stirring in their bedroom as the sun streams into the kitchen in warm, glowing shafts. “Me too.”
“Hi!” Her voice is crisp and sweet, British, and she stands up to greet him as he approaches. “Do you need directions to the changing rooms?”
everything OK? His thumb lingers over his phone’s keypad as he hesitates, unsure how to respond. He's fine, generally speaking. But sometimes…
Seven AM and Sam is stirring vanilla creamer into his coffee, staring down at it like it holds all the answers to life's great questions, as Gabriel watches him from their kitchen island.
“I’ve done everything for you, Cas,” he says to himself. He stands at his kitchen window, his glass clasped in his hands, and stares out into the night. The trees sway in the breeze, some of their branches brushing his upstairs windows, and he remembers Billie all covered in dirt and crying. “I’ve sacrificed so much that you don’t even know about. And this is how you repay me?”
Are they still friends? He hasn’t a clue. Does one night, one incident, make them friendly? They’d disliked each other intensely before this yet it seems incredibly difficult to go back to finding the guy irritating and smug. Not now that they’ve spent time together, in an intimate sort of way, and both divulged fairly personal secrets. Dean about having issues in his relationship, and Castiel about his brother’s tragic death. Would he like to be friends? He has a clue about that. He thinks he would. His friends are thin on the ground these days, at least when it comes to ones he can truly confide in. He would quite like someone he could talk to.
And then he had started crying again. Cas had scooped him up and they had sat together on the bed for a while as Dean retreated, flitting about to prepare dinner and give Lexie his Tylenol. By the time burgers and sweet potato fries had been deposited on the table, father and son had appeared again, both red-eyed with their hair messed up, and Dean just grinned at them, trying to lighten the mood, and kissed Cas who responded with a slightly watery smile.
“He’s dealt with it all. He’s adapted. It’s okay now, Dean. You’re both safe. You don’t need to worry about it all the time.”
Dinner wasn’t the unmitigated disaster that it could have been. On reflection, as he sits in the smoking lounge with a brandy in one hand and a Jose Morales in the other, it went fairly well. He didn’t offend any of the other diners, he wasn’t asked to leave, and he’s still sober enough to know where he is and who he’s with.
Cas is curled in the corner of the shower stall, fully-clothed, his eyes half-open as water crashes down on him, and he hasn’t even flinched at Dean standing in the doorway. The air is cold, bitter, and there’s an icy breeze leaking in from the open window. He doesn’t need to test the water to know it isn’t hot.
He extracts himself from the bedding and pads to the kitchen, pouring a glass of cold water and drinking it slowly as he leans a hip against the counter, unconcerned with his nudity in the silence and solitude of the dark apartment. The only light seeping in comes from the streetlamp outside, and the blissful quiet is punctuated by the sound of cars going past infrequently. A dog barks somewhere below the window. Meg lives above a thrift store and spends the majority of her weekly pay in there, frequently showing up at Castiel’s bookshop to show him her latest bargain. Her red dress is draped over the back of the couch, crumpled now, her heels discarded beneath it. An empty wine bottle is on its side on the coffee table with two wine glasses next to it. God, they were drunk. No wonder his head is pounding.
She doesn't comment on Sam. She never does. He sometimes wonders if she likes him at all, but when he thinks back they seemed to get on well in the past. Maybe they all need to spend more time together, get to know each other again. Bond. Family ties. That sort of thing.
They’ve barely spent two days in England, and he wishes for more time. He’s been tempted to delay their journey home, to sell the tickets and buy them onto the next crossing, but the lure of the largest and most luxurious cruise liner the world has ever seen is too much. That and the fact that they’re tipped to cross the Atlantic in record time, and he knows he has to be on board. What a story to tell back home! They have plenty of tales to tell their friends and family already, friends and family who are no doubt already intrigued after they hot-tailed it off to Europe at a moment’s notice, but this will be something else.
“You've spoken to him a total of, what, three times?” Meg walks back across the room, her blonde curls bouncing with each step, and deposits a hot cup of coffee into Castiel’s hands. She sits down next to him, one leg tucked beneath her, and regards him critically. “And he's been a total ass every time. Why do you care? Whatever's wrong, it probably serves him right.”
Jimmy shudders at the memory, getting up from his desk where he’s been grading papers to pour himself another glass of wine. He frowns at the almost-empty bottle. He only opened it two hours ago. And, as it always does when he’s had a little too much to drink, anger swirls up inside him, dark and clawing.
Castiel sighs, twirling his pen between thumb and forefinger. He sits back in his chair, elbow on the arm and chin on his hand, glum. “What am I supposed to do?”
“And you won’t have to,” Dean says with a ferocity that surprises himself. “I’ll make sure of that. He’s getting better, and in a few weeks he’ll be his old self again. Then I’ll do whatever it takes to keep him safe.”
“Dean, it’s going to be fine. I know you don’t like ships, but there’s nothing to worry about.” Sam slaps a palm down onto the shining banister. “This is the finest ship in the world, remember? And not only that, she’s unsinkable. Unsinkable! You need to try and relax, enjoy the journey if you can.” In his peripheral vision, a dark-haired woman glides past, almost close enough to touch, ascending the stairs gracefully. “I know I will be.”
“Because I kinda think it is. I know we don't know what happened last night but let's be real, we totally know. And whatever it is, to have Dean scampering off to stay with my cousin, it has to be something pretty bad. I've
“A while ago? Nah. She's just a bossy bitch who wants a guy to follows her around like some Disney princess. And Deano played right into that fantasy.” He gives Sam a pointed look, stopping the interruption in its tracks. “But now? After the way she behaved at your birthday? I don't know. I don't want to not know, I want to say hell no, she's a great girl and Dean’s lucky to have her. But… I just don't know.” He wraps an arm around Sam, who leans gratefully into the embrace. “And that scares the shit outta me.”
The men’s eyes had bulged at the notes they’d been presented with, had both nodded, then the porter had mumbled something about arranging Dean’s luggage and they’d both vanished from the room.
“Don’t you think she can be a bit,” Gabriel swirls his coffee, eyes upcast to the ceiling in search of what Sam is certain will be a more diplomatic word than the one he initially thought of. “Domineering. Especially when it comes to Dean.”
The shop smells, as always, fantastic. Sugary, buttery sweetness fills the air mingling with cinnamon and the rich scent of ground coffee. Aside from his home by the beach, this is Dean’s favourite place. He wipes down the counter for the tenth time, making sure it shines, and rearranges a pile of cinnamon rolls beside the till which stare up at him tantalisingly. Out the back, he's already got two boxes of goodies ready to take home with him. As he tucks a plaid towel into his apron pocket and his fingers brush a little extra pudge that definitely wasn't there a few months ago, he wonders guiltily if he should cut back on the treats. Cas is so healthy and Dean has tried so hard to mimic him - doing extremely well if truth be told - but the cookies and cupcakes and brownies sold at Sugar Crush are just too good to be true, and his waistline is proudly displaying the effects. He runs a hand self-consciously over his stomach and retreats back behind the counter to rearrange a display of raspberry snickerdoodles, finding himself humming along to Rockin’ Robin and stopping instantly with a grimace. What the hell is wrong with Gabriel?
“Let go of me.” Dean shakes himself loose, his expression darkening. “And don’t speak to me like that. You ain’t dad.”
“No problemo, amigo. Dean, get on home. Meg and I can clean up; go enjoy this beautiful day with your family. And take a photo of you and Cas skinny dipping for me.”
That's exactly how he feels. He nods, fighting an impending headache as Billie slides down from his seat and makes his way over to him.
“Yeah, pleasure’s all mine.” Downing the rest of his drink and starting to feel more than a little hazy, Dean deposits his glass on the table beside the decanter with a little more force then he intended. A few heads at the next table turn to look and he averts his gaze, cheeks heating at the unwanted attention. “What brings you to this fine ship, Fergus Crowley?”
They're fairly pleasant to look at, a modest mixture of long-stemmed roses in red, pink and white, nestled in a glass vase and decorated with a ribbon. To one side sits his computer monitor, a sleek Apple iMac with more functions than he can care to remember, forced upon him when his old Acer gave up the ghost last month. And on the other is his fifth black coffee of the day in a mug that reads ‘
“Dean.” Ruby says, her rouge-tinted lips lifting in a smile to reveal straight, white teeth. She has a deep blue sapphire nestled in her cleavage and a string of pearls woven into her hair. Her dress is black and beaded, lace draping over her shoulders, and she looks wonderful. Shame her beauty is only on the outside. “So glad you could join us. Isn’t it a wonderful party?”
“Amara?” He rasps, throat tightening as he recalls her expression right before she pushed him. He's met with a quivering, shaky sob and, in spite of himself, he frowns. “Are you okay?”
He unties his tie and hangs it in the closet. His jacket next, then he unbuttons his shirt slowly, absently. He's thinking back over their night. Sam and Gabriel had looked so darn happy together that it made his heart melt for his little brother. Sam had had a rocky few years at college before meeting Gabriel, falling in with a bad crowd and taking too many drugs, but now he's straightened his life out - Dean smirks at his own pun - and settled down with Gabriel, plus he has a thriving career as a human rights lawyer to boot. Life is good for the youngest Winchester and Dean is eternally grateful. John Winchester had always wanted the best for his kids, and Dean is sure his father is smiling down upon Sam right now. On himself, too.
The letters had been shoved away in a pile beneath a selection of fashion magazines, and he'd found them when he was searching for the insurance paperwork for the car. He'd opened them by mistake, in truth, distracted by thoughts of the vast electric bill that had just landed on his desk at the garage. When he'd opened the statement, he'd initially thought there had been some mistake. That the letter had been sent to the wrong person. But he'd sunk down on the couch in shock as he read the names of all Amara’s favourite stores, the beauty parlour where she has her nails done, the hair salon that she evidently frequents much more often than he'd realised. The list went on and on and his shock had soon thawed away into heated anger. How could she do this to him? Get herself into so much debt without telling him, be so goddamn irresponsible?
“Hello! Earth to Dean!” Sam is snapping his fingers in front of Dean’s face and he blinks, thrown from his little fantasy with a start, and glowers at his younger brother. “Man, you
, mentally and physically, and doesn't even realise his hands are trembling until Dean covers them with his own. Soft lips meet his neck and track a warm trail up to his jaw.
“Yes!” Gabriel sounds surprised. “I had no idea he was coming. He normally avoids these things like the plague. We should say hi. Cassie! Over here!”
Sam had hoped that a trip to Europe would lighten Dean’s mood. See a bit of the world, drink wine in Paris, visit the Moulin Rouge for a night of fun and debauchment. Dean had certainly seemed to enjoy it - he had woken up the following morning in just his shirt and bow tie, a handsome Middle Eastern young man on one side of him and a young woman with tumbling blonde curls on the other side. But even that hadn’t seemed to bring any light back to his eyes. He was listless, dismissing endless love affairs as mindless fun, and drinking more wine in a single evening than Sam could consume in a week. For a few days in Prague, Dean vanishes without a trace. When he turned up, he had bruised knuckles and a split lip and a grim set to his jaw, and barely spoke a word for days. His breath smelled of alcohol and he slept late every morning. Sam was concerned, of course. But he had his own problems to deal with, in the form of one Jessica Moore, and one Ruby Cortes, both vying for his attention and affection, and both presenting entirely different opportunities. Sam was preoccupied, but couldn’t deny he was enjoying the attention. And as a result, Dean was slipping from his radar.
Dean jumps. He doesn't mean to, but he's so lost in his own thoughts that he didn't hear Amara enter the room or walk up behind him. Her hands trail up his back to his shoulders and she presses her body into him. She's cold against his warm skin.
“Okay. Well, tell him I stopped by. I’ll call him, catch him for coffee on his way home or something.”
, signed by three of the actors and the director. A gemstone he'd found on eBay and paid over the odds for.
There's an edge to Jimmy’s voice that Dean has heard only once before and, in alarm, he pushes open the door to an empty classroom to take the call in peace. The last time he heard Jimmy sound this distressed was almost a year ago, when Lexie was lying motionless and not breathing on the beach after being dragged from the ocean. Jimmy is panic-stricken.
Oh, Castiel is going to kill Dean. Dean is fantastic with the kids, he really is, but moments like this make him realise that there's still a lot he needs to learn. Things he should and shouldn't do when it comes to the boys. And teasing Lexie, who is impressionable and imaginative at the best of times, is one of those things he shouldn't do.
But over time, that fun grew stale, the excitement seemed to erode somehow and the light in Dean’s eyes began to go out. He would still have friends over for dinner parties but he was listless, only partaking in light conversation while their new friends drank their fill of his wine and ate his food. It soon became apparent that high society didn’t suit Dean, that it was fun for a while, but that he missed the simplicity of his former existence and the pressure and expectations that their wealth now put on him was crushing his spirit.
‘Every relationship takes work, Sammy. You know that. Hell, you've got a full-time job with Gabe on your hands. Me and Amara, were just fine. Did anyone ever tell you that you worry too much?’
Secondly, the way I planned this story to go has changed a little in the last few months, so please check out the tags as I've added two new ones.
“I…” He fumbles over the words, falls silent. He wants to say that no, he just can't. There's too much hurt here. Too much deceit, too many lies. But she descends into fresh sobs and, in spite of himself, his heart aches for her. “I don't know. We need to talk, okay? About a lot of things. I dunno what to think right now.”
“Well,” Castiel says finally and Dean’s eyes snap up to his face. “I think we’ll be taking our seats. Nice to meet you all. Gabriel, we’ll have a drink later?”
It’s a weak excuse, one of Dean’s weakest to date and he knows it. He can’t look Castiel in the eye, instead focusing on his gray plaid pajama pants and bare feet. He has a scattering of hair across the joints of his toes, Dean notices. Cute. Then he remembers what’s going on and blushes a deeper shade of scarlet.
Later, when he's sitting at his desk with his second Starbucks of the day and a fresh shirt on, Gabriel texts him to say that Castiel might drop by tonight. No reply from Dean yet, to any of his texts or calls, but WhatsApp tells him his brother has been online in the last hour. The fact that he's ignoring Sam totally is, oddly, reassuring. If his brother has gone to ground, he'll characteristically need some time before resurfacing, and Sam can work with that.
“Don’t you worry about it, sonny. You won’t be the only one thinking, you can be sure of that. Come on, now!” She turns to the young man behind her, dark-haired and whippet-thin in a smart suit, sweating under the weight of an armful of her luggage. “We don’t have all day, let’s get ourselves settled in and we can join these fine folk later on.”
The heat of the day has long passed by now, the enthusiasm and joyous atmosphere ebbing away for a while as the parade-goers take a break to chill out, freshen up, take a power nap, or do whatever they need to do to recharge before the night’s festivities begin. The streets are littered with rainbow glitter, coloured streamers, discarded items of clothing, and empty plastic bottles which Sam Winchester eyes with distaste. He’s already picked up what feels like a hundred and deposited them into the nearest trashcan, but he gave up hours ago - mostly due to Dean’s consistent eye-rolling.
he will. A wreath on the front door. Lights wound around the porch steps. A garland draped across the windowsill. A miniature tree on the step by the front door. He takes that opportunity to peer inside at the dark, quiet living room lined with bookshelves and a coffee table with a mug of steaming something sitting on it. A television set turned firmly off. A book lying open and facedown on the arm of the couch and a blanket bunched up as though someone had thrown it off. It’s all very homely, if a little sparsely decorated, and it makes Dean smile a little at the sight. He can picture Castiel curled up here, reading his book and relaxing before leaving for church. His gaze trails over to the hallway door and he pauses, frowning. Does Castiel have a twin? Because someone is standing there, in the doorway between the living room and the hallway, someone blue-eyed and dark-haired, someone staring straight at him and…
He shivers, still cold despite the sweater and Dean’s body heat. It’s the kind of cold that seeps deep into his bones. The kind that he can normally dismiss with a cup of tea or a hot shower. But that reprieve hasn't come to him tonight.
“I do, Dean.” Sam’s arm is suddenly on his forearm, stopping him in his tracks. His brother’s hazel eyes are dark with concern, his brow furrowed. It makes him look older, somehow. “We all know what she's like. But what I don't know is why you're still together. Even Gabe can't stand her, and he likes everyone.”
Jimmy Novak hasn't had the best few weeks. And it’s beginning to show. Three people at school have now taken him aside and asked if everything is alright. Each time he’s given them a brittle smile and said that he’s fine, he’s just having family troubles, he’s sure it will all blow over and everything will be back to normal soon. His colleagues have clapped him on the shoulder, told him to call if he needs anything, and carried on with their lives and Jimmy is trying valiantly to do the same.
Now, he’s back in the kitchen and listening to the shower turn on above him, and wondering how to reply to his brother. Things have been tense between them lately, there’s been a weird distance that he hasn’t managed to shake off. But maybe this is the olive branch that they need to help them get back on track. He and Sam fight like any siblings do, but never seriously. Not often, at least. And if they do then at least one of them comes grovelling to apologise. But this time they haven’t exactly fought, so neither one can apologise. He sights and swipes his phone screen to light it up. He’s out of excuses, plus it’ll be fun. He can take some beers, maybe they can rent a movie, and it’ll be like old times.
Dean swears there are tears in Cas’ eyes as he deposits Lexie on the couch, crosses the room and bends down to pick up the pieces of his broken camera. Tentatively, Dean reaches for Cas and tries to take his arm but he's roughly brushed off.
“Dean?” Amara appears in the doorway, dragging a comb through her long damp hair. “What are you smiling about?”
Margaret Brown, an indomitable woman from Missouri who boarded at Cherbourg and insists they call her Molly, looks Sam up and down before giving him a large smile - then declares that he reminds her of her nephew back home. John Jacob Astor, a man nearing his twilight years who Sam knows by reputation of course, shakes his hand in a distracted sort of fashion - on his arm is a very pretty young woman in the type of delicate condition ladies can find themselves in, and Sam has to stop the surprise from showing on his face. Where he comes from, men are faithful to their wives. Strong women with kind hearts who would just as soon grab a shotgun as give you a foot rub at the end of a long day. He thinks of Ellen, a woman he’s called Aunt since he was a child, who runs one of the bars back home in small-town Lawrence, who has been known to evict many a patron over the years with her bare hands. And her daughter, Joanna, starkly reminiscent of the pregnant young lady before him, and he’s struck with a wave of homesickness.
“Maybe next summer,” Dean can feel how tight his smile is. It almost hurts his cheeks. He adds a laugh for good measure but it comes out a little strangled. “Money is kinda tight right now, so if we do go away it’ll be a weekend somewhere. Maybe Uncle Bobby’s cabin up in the mountains. Probably nowhere overseas, I’m afraid.”
“No.” It takes Castiel a moment to gather himself enough to continue. “It’s on Wednesday. Gabriel took care of everything. I think he knew I was a bit… upset.”
“I think we all were,” Sam mumbles, eyes on his plate. He remembers the shock that had passed over Castiel’s face and the raised eyebrow Meg had given the group when nobody spoke up to defend them. He feels equally as guilty for not challenging Amara’s cutting words. “I thought Dean would have said something to her. Maybe he did, later on. They left in a hurry.”
But moments after Jack had poured Sam another glass of champagne, staring longingly at the bottle and wishing he was of an age to enjoy it himself, there had been a clamouring outside their cabin followed by a clatter of fists upon the door, and Sam had got to his feet to investigate the source of the racket.
there at her side like a kicked puppy and hadn’t said a word. It left a bad taste in Castiel’s mouth. Rudeness always does, but when it’s directed at him and, worse, Meg it really bothers him. He wished he had said something there and then, called the woman out on her behaviour. But he had felt so out of place at the event to begin with that causing a scene would certainly not have improved the evening at all.
“Morning,” Cas says, stifling a yawn. Dean's arm is warm around his waist and he wraps his arms up around his neck, leaning into the kiss. Then Dean smiles against his lips mischievously before Cas is dipped backwards, low to the ground with their lips still joined, and a laugh bubbles up inside him and breaks free as the children giggle somewhere in the background. When Dean lifts him upright again he's breathless and smiling.
Jessica had left with her mother before he’d found the chance to speak to her, and he hadn’t even gotten a good look at her face. He can picture it though, her petite features pinched with hurt, a red flush across her cheeks, her mouth in a grim line. The more he thinks about it, the angrier he feels with Sam. What the
So that's exactly what they do. The boys are in their footie pyjamas, Dean in sweats, and Cas in his plaid PJ pants and a sweater, and they pile onto the bed with Cas in the middle and wriggle about until they're all comfortable. There's an elbow digging into Cas’ ribs, Billie is a dead weight on top of him, Dean’s leg is too heavy draped over his thigh, but somehow he feels his muscles unwind as he closes his eyes and sighs deeply.
“No, Dean.” Castiel lifts his head, lying back on the pillows and gazing at Dean with a soft, love-struck expression. “No problem at all. And of course I’ll be your man. All you had to do was ask.”
He throws their bedroom door open and turns to slam it in her face but he’s too slow because she’s right there.
And that's how Dean finds them the next morning: Cas curled awkwardly in Lexie’s kid-sized bed with his child draped over his chest. It's Cas who he goes to first, stroking his lover’s hair and waking him slowly, smiling and leaning in to steal a morning kiss when Cas’ eyes soften and he smiles up at him.
The glass wall of the shower screen is behind him. The one he's been meaning to take a look at for weeks. And she pushes him hard enough to send all of his weight falling back against it, his hands scrabbling wildly for purchase on something and finding nothing.
If he’s honest, he’s pretty beat by now and hitting up a burger joint and heading home sounds pretty good. They’ve not managed to find any of their friends in the crowd, and Sam’s long past that merry buzz he had going on earlier from one beer too many, and now he feels hot, sticky and gross and would give anything for a cool shower and a change of clothes that isn’t covered in every type of glitter under the sun. But Dean, up ahead, shows no signs of slowing down.
Then she's sobbing so hard it sounds like she can barely breathe, coughing and howling, and in between cries Dean hears her begging him not to go. Not to leave her alone. Not to leave.
“Why am I not dressed in the appropriate attire for dinner with the world’s finest?” Turning, Dean walks away across the room and opens the door to the private promenade deck that the steward had taken such pride in showing him. The wind immediately catches his hair, blowing it out of any semblance of style, and he breathes in the sea air deeply. The whiskey has settled his nerves somewhat and he feels much more mellow than when they had boarded hours ago. “Because I’m not going. So you can run along and help Sam comb his hair, he’ll definitely need help with that.”
A voice drifts from somewhere above him, deep and masculine with a mild note of irritations running through it, and Castiel peers up at whoever it is, wondering whether to tell him to get lost or ask for his help standing up. The fluorescent strip lights are in his eyes and a bead of sweat chooses that moment to track down from his eyebrow and momentarily blind him. When he's rubbed it away and focused, a pair of deep green eyes are staring down at him, narrowed in curiosity. Castiel blinks again, shifting back a little to take in the stranger standing over him. Dirty blonde hair darkened with sweat, cheekbones and jawline that could cut glass, and a confused frown. The guy is generically hot, probably much hotter when his t-shirt doesn't have sweat stains under the arms, but Castiel is struck with an instant and strong sense of dislike. It takes his brain a moment to catch up, but when he does he finds himself standing up and taking a step back, putting some distance between them.
The hospital corridors are long, grey, sterile, and cold. The hair on Dean’s arms stands up as he walks, and it’s only partly due to the air conditioning being set too low. The glare of the overhead lights makes him squint and he keeps his gaze to the floor. The people milling past him - faceless doctors and nurses in their green scrubs and white coats - don’t stop him or attempt to talk with him. The expression on his face must say it all. He can feel his misery in every part of his body: lines of tension in his shoulders, the way the muscles draw and drag with each breath, the tightness around his chest that threatens to suffocate him, and the pull of his brows that seems permanent these days.
Exhausted and spent, Dean had just cradled her and stroked her hair, silent, and his gaze distant and glazed. He's too vulnerable right now to try and voice his feelings, for fear of her turning from the apologetic, sorrowful woman in his arms to something full of spite and venom.
Tomorrow is Christmas Day and Dean will be waking up with his brother, opening their gifts, then welcoming their friends for dinner and drinking long into the night. And, across the street, he can just imagine Castiel’s house looking cold and sad, and it causes a pang of sorrow to pulse in his chest.
As he’s scanning the room for Cas, feeling hot and over-wrought, he feels his phone buzz incessantly in his pocket and frowns at the name on the screen when he fishes it out.
“You're probably right.” Castiel works his hand free and passes it over his eyes. “I can almost taste the molecules in each sip. I just wanted to be awake for tonight.”
“Kinda, yeah.” He feels breathless, like all the people around them just don’t exist any more, have melted away, and it’s just the two of them standing here, with all the time in the world.
hates that nickname. “Why reserve all the festivities for a few short weeks? An the customers are loving it - look!”
“Dean?” Castiel’s warm voice pulls him back to the present and he finds himself in the bathroom, steam slowly winding its way up through the air, and Castiel is sliding his hands under his t-shirt and pushing it up. “It’s okay. Stay with me, stay here.”
Again, I ask you to place your faith in me and remember there's a happy ending tag up there somewhere. I'm sure there is...
“Maybe. But I like it. A lot. Thank you, Dean.” Castiel smiles at him then looks around them again, eyes sparkling in the light from the decorations. It could be Dean’s imagination, but he’s sure he feels Castiel shift just a little closer to him on the step. “I think I know which part of your hard work is my favourite.”
Cas isn't well. Jimmy, above anyone else, knows that. And he's sat alone in his study night after night, wondering if he should call Dean and speak to him plainly about Cas’ mental state. It's clear to him that he’s depressed. He's pale, he’s lost some weight (although he's still solid muscle on his thighs and biceps), and he looks like he barely sleeps an hour a night. Frown lines have made their home between his brows and his fingernails are bitten down to the quick. But it doesn't appear to be visible to anyone else - Dean seems to carry on as though everything is fine, in spite of his shock on that awful night where it all went to hell. But the nightmares… Jimmy knows they're just a side effect from what's plaguing his brother, not the actual cause. Castiel is afraid. He's afraid of making a mistake in getting married, yet he's afraid of losing the man he loves if he speaks his mind. It all stems directly back to Cole, and Jimmy has wondered more than once if Castiel dealt with it all adequately at the time. It certainly doesn't seem like he did. Surely if he had, these old fears of being left alone with his children wouldn't be resurfacing during a time he's supposed to be so happy.
He deserves this, he tries to reason with himself as he slips past a small group of elderly men who visibly look him up and down as he does. He grew up dirt poor, he worked his fingers to the bone from before he was even in his teens - he deserves to take it easy for a while. To have a few things handed to him, to have people fetch and carry and do whatever he asks them to.
Time passes and Dean just sits by the bedside, stroking Lexie’s hair and watching the children sleep. The moon moves slowly across the sky, flanked by twinkling stars, but Dean only has eyes for his kids. He can hear movement in the kitchen but doesn’t move, doesn’t venture down the hallway. He rests his chin on Lexie’s mattress and listens to him breathe, slightly harsh and raspy, his throat still hurting him from so long on the ventilator. The boy stirs and Dean hushes him with sort kisses and gently rubs to his back.
“It’s no problem at all.” The cop releases his hand and smiles. “I think your friends must have realised you’re lost. I believe they’re looking for you.”
Dean’s mouth is dry. He’s sure he’s never felt attraction this strong before, not in his entire life. It’s as though the air between them is sizzling, crackling with static, and he
The awards ceremony isn't his idea of a good time, either. He normally avoids such things like the plague - not that invitations get extended his way very often. His little shop in the quiet corner of town doesn't exactly call for many glamorous social events. Most people don’t even know he’s there unless they want something from him. But it's a charity event, a fundraiser, and in a moment of madness, he'd allowed Meg to convince him to buy tickets. He's now bitterly regretting it.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel almost whispers it, looking down at his hands and blinking droplets from his lashes. “I didn’t hear you come in.”
He ducks his head down to his chest as his breathing picks up, inhaling deeply to try and calm himself. He needs to get this shit under control. Even Ash had noticed at work yesterday, joking as he’d asked Dean if he’d had a few heavy nights lately because he looked pale and tired. Dean had shot back that he had, that he and Amara had been spending some quality time together, and all the guys in the forecourt had laughed and the conversation from there had devolved into lewd talk about who they’d fucked at the weekend, who was having an affair outside of their marriage, and who had the hottest girlfriend. Dean stayed out of it all, not enjoying the sentiments and knowing just how Amara would react if she could hear them all talk. Knowing how his mother would react. Damn, he misses her. If she were here right now, he’d be able to talk to her about everything that’s on his mind. He’d be able to be honest with her. Mary would help him. So would John, in his own way. As would Sam, Gabe, but he can’t bring himself to approach them, even after their offer at the barbecue. It would feel too much like throwing in the towel. And he isn’t there, not yet.
Then she's gone in a cloud of chai spices and sweet perfume and Castiel stares after her, a little hot under the collar. He knows exactly what dress Meg is planning to wear tonight, a tight-fitting red number that shows off her curves in all the right way. She'd sent him a photo of it the night before. And if her flirty farewell means anything, neither of them will be going home alone tonight. Maybe he should hire a tuxedo after all.
“Sure you don’t.” Castiel sits back against Billie’s bed, stretching his legs out in front of him and rescuing his mug from the bedside table, a smirk at his lips. “It wasn’t obvious at all.”
“So you act like a total ass, then expect me not to care?” She sneers at him and his heart pounds. An unpleasant sensation is opening up beneath his ribs, anxiety and fear all combined into one. He tries to get away from her again and turns to walk into the bathroom. Almost instantly, the room feels too small, the walls too close, and the ceiling too low. She’s right fucking there again, and he's suddenly hot all over, so he steps back to get some space, brought to an immediate halt by the shower screen. “I don’t think so. This would never have happened if you hadn't opened my mail in the first place.”
There’s sadness in Castiel’s eyes and Dean aches to lean over and put an arm around his shoulders.  He shouldn’t ask, but he knows before the words even form on his tongue that he’s going to.
Dean hasn’t been out for very long, not publicly at least. For years, only Sam and their closest friends Jo and Charlie knew the Dean wasn’t as into girls as he pretended to be; that the entire ladies’ man demeanour was him desperately trying to overcompensate for the fact that he wasn’t comfortable in his own skin and thought that there was something wrong with him for the way he felt. He’s always been a strong, confident guy, for as long as Sam can remember, and somewhere along the line had got it into his head that he couldn’t be the person he was while liking men. It had taken months of self-analysis, interspersed with fits of anger and emotion, for Dean to come to terms with himself and now that he has done it seems he wants the whole world to know. And the annual Pride parade has quickly become his favourite day of the year.
“Sammy?” Gabriel appears at his side, stroking his lower back and leaning in to kiss his cheek. He only doesn't have to stand on tiptoe to do it because Sam is still hunched over the counter, lost in thought. “You okay?”
“‘Kay.” Billie yawns hugely and turns over in bed, not really awake, tugging his stuffed elephant closer and going back to sleep with a speed that Dean truly envies.
He hears the slap echo around the kitchen before he feels it. His cheek flares with raw pain and he flinches back in shock. It isn't the first time she's hit him, nor is it the hardest, but it's enough to make him take a step away, his hand coming automatically to his face, feeling the heat drawn to the surface of his skin in the shape of her hand. She grabs his arm, her acrylic nails digging in fiercely and he knows there will be bruises later. Maybe even broken skin. That's happened before. Then she's in his face, her eyes burning with contempt and he swallows a burst of anxiety at the sight. He's frozen, rigid with shock as he always is whenever they fight like this.
Now, melancholy and missing home, he fumbles in his pocket and retrieves his tobacco and paper, rolling a cigarette between experienced fingers and striking up a match, cupping his hand over it to protect the flame from the wind. It takes a few tries but eventually he lights it and inhales, filling his lungs and coughing a little as the acrid smoke catches the back of his throat. He exhales through both nostrils, twisting his lips to one side and putting aside all thoughts of Ellen and Joanna for now. He misses them. He misses it all. This isn’t what he pictured when, as a child, he imagined being rich. Not at all.
It's in a white envelope with Cas and Dean’s names written on in neat cursive, and they've both been steadfastly ignoring it for the past week. It's an invitation to parents’ night at the school tonight to round up the school year, and neither of them are excited about going. Cas is nervous, both fretting about the kids not doing well and reiterating that it doesn't matter either way because he knows his kids are smart and doesn't need anyone else to tell him so. He gets this look about him whenever he goes on one of his rants about it, and Dean has to hide a smile behind his hand. As for himself, he just plain doesn't want to go. He still isn't good with crowds - when the bakery gets packed out he feels tense and sweaty - and he can't help but imagine people staring at him at the school, talking about him and Cas, talking about the twins. His fears are unfounded, he's sure, but he can't quite crush them down.
As though by magic, his phone chooses that moment to beep at him and he spins it towards him, reading the text message on the screen without really seeing it. It’s from Castiel, asking him how he is. Again. He’s sent a total of nine messages this week, all short but loaded with concern, and Dean’s replied to precisely two of them. He doesn’t know what to say. Half of him wants to block the guy’s number and hope never to run into him again, and the other half wants to divulge everything he’s feeling, every moment of fear and sickness and anger at how wayward his relationship has become because he knows Castiel will listen and respond with no judgement. But he can’t risk that, he knows he can’t.
After his seventh glass of wine and his third beer, when the world is starting to look a little hazy, Dean sits straight upright as a lightbulb figuratively goes on above his head. He’s got it. He can surprise Castiel! Decorate his house for him! Okay, maybe not inside because that would be kinda creepy. But just the porch and the steps. Maybe the front door. Castiel will be at Midnight Mass, right? So his house will be empty for a while. And what better way to swing into Christmas than to come home to a beautifully decorated doorway and to know someone is thinking of him.
concerned. It's not an emotion I feel very often, mind you, so I'd appreciate it while it's here. But I worry about you, Castiel. Shut up in your shop with only those dusty old books for company. It'll make you old before your time.” He'd glanced at Castiel’s tweed suit jacket. “If it hasn't already.”
By that time, it’s pretty late - almost midnight, and the snow is coming down heavy outside. It’s almost Christmas.
A while later, he makes sure Cas is covered with his heavy blankets and that he’s settled, then he goes to investigate the state of the kitchen and prepare a snack for both of them. But when he opens the refrigerator, he stops short. Nothing is really edible in there. There's out-of-date food, spoiled food, and not much he can really make for them to eat. A cold feeling sweeps over him - has Cas been eating at all since he got the news about his father? It doesn’t look like it, and he had felt slimmer in Dean’s arms as he’d helped him to dry off and guided him to bed. Castiel’s kitchen is usually immaculate and fully-stocked so to see plates piled in the sink and half-finished cups of tea scattering the surface is jarring. It looks like Cas has attempted to eat and drink but hasn’t been able to get beyond starting to cook before giving up.
“That’s a shame.” He sounds like it couldn’t be less of a shame. The guy gestures at the smudged body paint and glitter on Dean’s skin. “It appears that you’ve had a good time?”
Those were simpler times. Sad times, of course. Especially towards the end. But he has some good memories of his childhood, most of them revolving around his brother and his father, and the occasional trip they took together hunting or fishing or hiking. Spending time together, just family. Nothing like the life he lives today. He feels caught, trapped like a fly in a web, and as though something dark and ominous is rising up behind him, poised to strike at any given moment.
He’s adjusting to it all okay, he thinks. Better than he thought he would. It had taken a while to accept, but now he’s starting to feel at home in this world. Meeting Jessica has helped, certainly. And he can’t help it: he quite likes being waited on. You know, on occasion. Having someone to get him a drink when he fancies one, or clear the table for him after dinner, or make up his bed for him. Make sure the fires are lit and cleaned out the following morning. Cleaning. Tidying. All the things he didn’t realise he hated doing until he no longer had to do them. Of course, in what he’s come to think of as his ‘old life’ his home was a quarter of the size of his current one, so cleaning and tidying it didn’t take the mammoth effort that it does now. He didn’t need staff back then. Now he wonders how he would cope without them.
“Daddy?” A very small voice drifts from the hallway and Cas turns to look over the back of the sofa at Lexie, rubbing his eyes and stumbling softly across the room. “I can't sleep.”
“Why are you?” the boy counters and Cas smiles. Lexie has his cheek pillowed on Cas’ shoulder and is staring up at him with wide eyes. Cas naturally rocks him a little and Lexie lets out a content sigh. “It's nighttime.”
Shifting in his seat in the kitchen, he listens to her put her keys away. There's a cup of coffee log cold by his hand because he's been waiting for a while. Hours, it feels like. Eventually, Amara walks into the room and her cool smile freezes on her lips as she takes in the scene before her. Dean, still in his grease-stained jeans from the garage, sitting at the table.
“I don’t know why you even give a damn, I really don’t,” Meg says, pushing her blonde curls out of her face. “He seems like an ass to me.”
“Hello?” Dean covers his other ear with his hand to drown out the background noise, turning away from the small crowd of parents. “Jimmy? Everything OK?”
“We can afford their gym,” Gabriel reminds him, a slight edge to his voice. “But I’d rather go somewhere less pretentious that doesn’t cost two hundred dollars a month. Did Dean tell you that he has to pay extra for the tennis lessons? They aren’t even included!”
He's in the hospital. The last time he was here, something truly awful had happened. The taste of blood in his mouth, searing pain down his arm, doctors trying to hold him still as he screamed and cried and tries to twist away to look for Bobby. He shivers, and Amara kisses his knuckles.
“Sam Winchester, where the hell have you been?!” Jo’s voice breaks thankfully into his reverie and he envelops her in a hug, elbowing Dean aside. She hugs him back then thumps him in the chest when she pulls away. “We were supposed to meet hours ago, I’ve been calling and calling you both!”
It breaks his heart a little to leave the kids, as it always does, and he fervently hopes the evening will be over soon. Dean casts a look back over his shoulder at the boys as him and Cas climb into Cas’ car to head to the school. Lexie is in the window, waving to them with a vague, dreamy expression on his pale face. Jimmy stands in the doorway holding Billie by the hand and the look on the little boy’s face makes Dean’s heart clench. Billie looks so sad, like he's been told Santa isn't real or something. He's looking down at his feet and his eyes are huge and melancholy. Dean decides to speak to Cas later, to tell him to forgive his son, to remind him that accidents happen. The weird thing is that Cas knows that, and he normally would have forgiven his kid easily by now. Something is eating at him, something he's keeping hidden, and Dean is determined to find out what.
Castiel’s tone is stony and leave no doubt about how serious he is. Dean’s heart feels like it's pounding between his temples. He cannot let Sammy see him like this. Not now, not ever. He never should have called his brother’s number to begin with. The room spins again and he tips his head back against the wall, groaning as pain splits through his skull.
“I won this. In a raffle. I should probably use it. I was thinking of joining a gym again.” He can form complex sentences right now, he's too nervous and feels completely out of his depth. Bela seems to sense this and her hand closes over his before he can retract it.
