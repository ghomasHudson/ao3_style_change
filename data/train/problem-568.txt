Mrs Hudson is bringing around a tray of champagne flutes. When everyone has one in hand, Mycroft clears his throat.
“I haven’t heard anything. Why? What happened?”
remember, wouldn’t you, Watson? You used to be at the butt end of his many deductions.” He gives an unpleasant laugh. “I see that he was right about you as well.”
“Not strictly. He performed into the eighties and nineties. His last album was in 2013.”
“I happened to be on Baker Street and thought I might as well stop in for a cup of tea,” he said.
“You’re not sleeping.” He gives me a kindly smile. “Understandable.”
“True. Anyway, I wanted to thank you for making an effort, for saying what a few of us were thinking.”
He’s never been a performer, never enjoyed that kind of attention. At parties, he prefers to stay in the background, maybe have a long conversation with one person. He’s not exactly antisocial, but he isn’t really social either. An introvert in his heart-of-hearts, he can talk to anyone, but would rather not be the one up front doing anything.
Angelo smiles and claps John on his bad shoulder. “I’ll bring a candle. More romantic.”
Watson smiled back at the lady, his sweet face shyly revealing its dimples. It was not so many years since my mother had called him
“I’ll follow in a cab,” he says. “Don’t let Anderson touch anything yet.”
“Sherlock, I can—“
“You have risen, lighting the way for us all.”
, he thinks. It’s terrifying.
Watson drew a breath. “It’s my life, Holmes. I do not want a wife or children. I am content to remain with you, as I have said before. It is my only wish to be your partner, in every way.” He cast a sharp look at me. “Perhaps you’re tired of me, though; the first signs of crow’s feet are making you look for a younger man.”
Ariel smiled. “Elsa, meet your dad, John Watson.”
He pictures the man who limped towards him across the restaurant wearing an ill-fitting suit, obviously his best. He remembers how he’d held his head high, his posture straight in spite of needing to lean on the cane. Only his eyes betrayed his distress.
A traffic jam is forming around us as people reach for milk. Together, we step in front of the yoghurt.
that he loved: drugs.
The veil was growing thinner. I could almost see the other side.
He smiled.
“How can I help you, John?”
“No, I’m laughing at Rich. I think he loves you more than I do.” A giggle and a hiccup.
“Yeah, me too.” If he had to preserve anything from that time, he realises he would do the same as Harry. If he hadn’t been in the army when their dad died, he might have cleaned out the old house with her and argued over what to keep. Now, it doesn’t matter.
It’s always something…”
“I’m not expecting Shakespeare.” He huffed and lowered his head. “How can she think that Diarrhoea Dude could play John Watson’s part? Fans won’t accept it.”
That’s not something that can ever, ever be
“What I mean is, I think they’ve misunderstood the nature of our relationship.”
He steps out onto the street, squinting in daylight. And he still doesn’t have a place to live.
“I know who I am.”
He’s arrogant, too, and John can see why he has rubbed so many people the wrong way. He paces, tossing out words and syllables, talking more to himself than anyone, occasionally barking a question at Lestrade. He closes the door on Anderson, the tech, wonders out loud about
Then he suggested
“If you are correct, he is a bounder.” Watson frowned. “I shall throw him down the stairs if he becomes insulting.”
them.” That was the correct use of the words, no matter how hard Mycroft cried.
“Well, what is it, John?”
Sherlock clears his throat. “There’s another bedroom. Upstairs. You remember, John. It’s just storage now, but I believe there’s a bed under all those boxes. Somewhere. So, yes. There is a room.”
Sherlock had wished for that kind of anonymity as well, and realised that more than once Mycroft had kept him from the worst of himself. The stints in rehab, while horrible, had allowed him to step out of his life in a way that John hadn’t been able to do.
“Got it,” Irene said. “We can add a line or two that makes it clear they have some kind of psychic connection.”
“And how many times have you been
He studies Lestrade for a moment. “What’s new about this one? You wouldn’t have come to me if there wasn’t something different.”
“Yes, of course. I thought… I’m rather stupid about such things, but it seems to me that you would miss your daughter, and might be thinking about her. I’m sorry. It isn’t any of my business.”
"Let me finish. It's something I understand about myself now. I love you, and that means I will accept whatever you can give. And if I become too much of a burden at some point--"
“And what will you do?”
Sherlock is chained, arms to opposite walls, slumped over. His back is covered with blood, criss-crossed with wounds. A man with a whip hits him again and again. He cries out.
“At this point, it doesn’t matter.”
Sometimes, he thinks, it would be an advantage to be able to lie fluently. Telling the truth only brings more questions he can’t answer. He doesn’t want to talk about this, but he’s not a natural liar.
I turned to the door
There are things that Sherlock does which he knows make people angry. He’s been careful not to do too many of these things— especially regarding the kitchen and bathroom. He’s tried to be thoughtful of his flatmate, sensitive to anything that might make him change his mind about living with Sherlock.
He nodded. “Limited imagination.”
“Curiosity. I wanted to see who he was blackmailing, and to prevent that information from falling into other hands.”
“But why, Watson? Women adore you— and you are always a bit flirtatious with them. I think you do it to annoy me. Your feelings towards females are softer than mine, and a marriage would give you an appearance of respectability. It can only help your career, something you must undoubtedly consider as you are about to set yourself up in practice. A wife would complete your life, whereas I can only complicate it. Why would you want to stick with me? I’m stroppy, unpleasant, untidy, arrogant, petty—”
“It’s a mattress. How many kinds can there possibly be?”
“No, he’s not. What I mean is, nobody cares what he is. He plays eccentric parts, intellectual parts. He chooses what he wants to do and can take his agent’s advice or not. If he were gay, it wouldn’t matter. He gets interesting offers, and takes the ones he wants. That could be you, in a few years, if you don’t make everything about this. Right now, coming out might hurt your career. You won’t be the brilliant detective on the telly; you’ll be the gay detective. So build your career for now. Don’t go after trouble.”
“How did you know it was Afghanistan?”
“True. Miss Simpson did, though. And Miss Thompkins. You did not go, of course.”
That will come, though, with practice.”
The person in the bed is restless now, tossing under a thin blanket. “John…” he moans.
A small sequel to Neil Gaimon's "The Case of Death and Honey."
“I should hope so. I like being useful to you.” Instead of going into the kitchen, he came to me and sank into my lap. “You’d be lost without me.”
“You see that pretty face,” Donovan says. “You see that gorgeous arse, and you’re amazed that he’s even interested in you. He knows how to get what he wants.”
“You have made an appointment with her to discuss the portrait?”
, he reminds himself.
“But it must mean that they did not know of our departure. Surely that is good news.”
“And let people assume that we’re business partners, no more? Or will you give a suggestive wink when you say it so they’ll know what you mean?”
I had returned, as I said I would, but wasn’t sure how to smuggle his bones away from here, or where to put them. Still, a promise to a ghost must be kept. John hadn’t had much of a life, but his afterlife had given me something I would always be grateful for.
“You can hardly take responsibility for that. Blame your parents.” I sipped my coffee, that being a better remedy for the long, sleepless night than a cup of tea. “You did get the safe open. Kudos for that.”
” Ariel said as she was chivvied out of the flat. “He’s my dad.”
“Obviously. Read the last page.”
“Just as I said in my statement.”
Moriarty’s keen eye was focused on my partner. “Tell your boy that it is not very smart to finger loaded firearms in the pocket of one’s dressing gown.”
The boys at that school were privileged, for sure, and malicious in ways he hadn’t experienced before. In his old school he’d been pranked, and he’d survived many a fight on the streets, but he’d never really been humiliated before. No one in the neighbourhood could make him feel less, because they were all the same. You didn’t stab someone in the back or undercut them because even if you hated their guts, you were all scuffing along the same uncertain life, just trying not to get jumped on your way home.
“You have abominable taste, John. I beg of you, let me select your clothes from now on.”
It’s not a good idea, I realise. I still think of Sherlock every day. Sometimes I run through my fantasy when I lie down to sleep, picturing us in our chairs, comfortable in our silence. I imagine there are no text messages asking him to
And appointment date and time.
“I see your point. But I do rather hope that you’ll move a few of your things over. In fact, I hope you’ll stay, even when the tea and toast are gone and we have to start going to the shops or starve. I’ve never had a flatmate, so I can’t give you testimonials, and I do have some vices you should know about.”
(See the end of the chapter for
That’s over.
Some colour rises in John’s cheeks. “What can I do for you?”
Everything happens differently. Sherlock doesn’t go to the roof. He comes home from Barts and tells me that Moriarty is dead. And I say,
“Did you care? Did you… mourn for me?”
“This isn’t a
. I’m trying to figure out what that means, talking to Dr Eccles and going to the group, and I hope I’ll do better. That I won’t disappoint you. I just want you to know. I should have told you sooner, but apparently I’m rubbish at talking, too. Can you put up with me?”
Sitting up in bed, I consider my options. I’m sleeping upstairs, as I always have. The bedroom downstairs has been closed for three weeks. I know what I would see if I opened that door. Another reminder that you’re not coming back.
At the end, when he noticed all the text messages, he’d called John, telling him that he was needed. He wasn’t needed, but it was nice to have a witness to the conclusion, the moment when he revealed all that he’d deduced. He’s rather proud of this one.
He nods, gives her a rueful smile. “Yeah, I guess I am. A bit.”
“The other day, when you set Molly straight about her script. I know she didn’t take it well, but it really was necessary. I can’t think what they had in mind, offering to produce this fiasco.”
, he thinks. It’s bad enough having to use the cane, but he really can’t manage without it. He’s gaunt, having lost much of his muscle mass over the last four months. Grey hairs are starting to come in among the blond, and the eyes that stare back at him look weary. Not surprising, since he hasn’t slept through a night since he returned. Worse, he’s lost nearly all the confidence he once had. He’s no longer Doctor Watson, army surgeon, Captain Watson, RAMC. He’s a reject. No job, no family, no purpose. His once busy life has been reduced to therapy three times a week, physio Monday and Friday and Ella every Wednesday. He feels old. He looks old.
“Secondly,” he began, trying to make his voice as benign as possible. “What is the alien after?”
“Molly,” he says. “I have to go.”
It did not need to be said that he would be willing to save me from Moriarty, to die in my stead. He would do it without hesitation and consider his life well spent.
in his commitment to the relief of suffering, whatever discomfort it may cause him personally. And he is a dedicated student of human anatomy, as well.”
But he had never felt so alive as when he was in the middle of a war. And he survived.
“We don’t have to talk about it,” he said softly. “I just didn’t want to pretend it didn’t happen.”
Sherlock sighs and looks away. His eyes land on the empty cups, and in what might be a rare act of domesticity, he picks them up and carries them into the kitchen.
Sherlock looks up, his eyes narrow with anger. “Mycroft was supposed to be keeping an eye on him.”
John stood at the door, looking confused, but not full of rage. He had by now, I assumed, understood the consequences of fertility.
He shrugged. “It shouldn’t matter, but it does. Not being in that situation, I can’t give an accurate response.”
He called to mind what he already knew about John Watson. What he
He’s a man with many acquaintances, mates who will have a pint with him if he calls, people who send him Christmas cards. But not many real friends. Even Mike Stamford was never that, back when they were students. They sat next to each other in class and talked. Med school was too gruelling for friendships. In the army, there were people he was close to, but he’s lost touch with most of them; only a couple live in London.
I step closer. “Sherlock?”
“A therapist might help him do that,” Watson suggests. “Not forget, maybe, but find a way to deal with it.”
She hangs her head, looking a bit embarrassed. “I’m sorry. Thank you for the tea. And for talking to me.”
“After I insulted you so horribly, I used to notice you.”
“I know he matters to you, more than anyone else. But, Sherlock— he didn’t know. What you did devastated him.”
Sherlock sighed. “Depressing.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. In defiance of my name.”
John was alive. He was bitter and angry, and wanted to be left alone. He didn’t care that people had grieved. He didn’t love Sherlock. That had been a long-shot anyway.
“How are you, Rosebug?” It’s his nickname for her, dating back to when she demanded that he read
“Good. No, not— I mean, good that I’m right. Not imagining things.”
), she settled into television roles, playing various mothers and teachers and eventually grandmothers, witches, and royalty in a recent years. She’d guest-starred on
Wilkes’s nose twitches. He rubs it and says, “Dr Huxtable has asked me to speak with you. You’ll require my approval to talk to anyone.”
“He’s gay?”
“I assure you he is not so benevolent, my boy. We shall have to keep an eye on him. In spite of his jolly appearance, he is like a snake, silent and dangerous.”
“Excuse me, Mr Holmes,” the Inspector said. “It’s about your boy.”
“I’d like to dance with you.”
Watson leaned down, kissed me and laid his head on my chest. I put my arms around him, my eyes overflowing. I wept, perhaps for my foolish younger self, so eager and innocent.
“Turn over, slowly.” The man spoke in a normal tone now, a voice that Sherlock almost recognised.
He heard the steps and it was already too late. Something hit him in the head, and he went down, more from the shock than from the force of the blow.
Holmes (
“I’m so sorry,” he said, smiling regretfully. (Who said he couldn’t act?) “Contractually, I’m not allowed to read fan-scripts. They actually had to write it into my contract because I kept reading things fans sent me and trying to get the studio to produce them. To be honest—“ All a lie, of course— as if he would read anything a fan sent him! He’d stopped reading fan mail when he was sixteen.
“Aren’t you curious?”
“She’s my daughter. I have a right to talk to her.”
It’s more painful than missing John for two years. He was never jealous of Mary— it’s not that way for Sherlock. John wanted Mary. Sherlock just wanted John, whatever he could have of him.
“Well, I
They make their way up the stairs. He can tell John’s tired, so he pushes him into his chair and tells him he’ll make the tea. John smiles. “Thank you, love.”
Staying in hospital is not an option; he leaves through the window, returns to Baker Street. The burns are already mostly healed. The broken bones are mending as well. He was in stasis for four days, assumed to be in a coma.
“You are most kind, Mr Holmes. I feel that we have some kindred spirit for poetry. I could talk of such things for hours.” He cast a smile at his fiancee. “I’m afraid Miss Chadwick finds me a rather dull companion.”
Sherlock shakes his head. “Even if he did have feelings for me, he hates me now. I’m sorry, Molly. I’ve wronged you. I was always flattered by your attention, but I now understand what it means to have your feelings unrequited. To be rejected. Love is a dangerous delusion, something not to be trusted. I’d forgotten that, to my detriment.”
Nothing, apparently.
“You say he is not a common criminal,” he replied. “It’s clear he sees this as some kind of personal vendetta.”
“Explain,” he demands. “You’ve discovered something.”
, which is silly because that’s what he is, or to point out that Holmes is, in fact, stalking him.
To Watson, she might be
I might want to ask Stamford about those pills. I’m remembering the dream I had last night, falling asleep in a grimy hotel with him, somewhere. Sherlock cold, sick, lonely. It comforted me to be able to hold him, even if it was just a dream.
” she said. “What’s that going to look like?”
“You have your own horse?” I asked.
“Didn't we used to watch movies together? You know, when we were kids?”
“But no big wedding,” he said. “No tuxedos and groomsmen and flowers. Just you and me.”
Evidence of you. Evidence of a life that has ended.
“A disaster,” she summarises. “Perfect storm.”
I slapped my palm to my forehead. “Have mercy, Watson! No theatre reviews. I have no desire to see any of Messrs Gilbert and Sullivan’s entertainments. Proceed with the events of the evening. And no descriptions of finery— or blow by blow narratives of inane conversations.”
Watson went back to work. Praying that he’d be as quick with the safe as he’d been with the door lock, I decided to make a quick check on the rest of the house. Opening the door, I crept out into the passage and listened. The house was quiet.
“I thought you were supposed to be brilliant,” she replies. “Can’t you guess?”
A doctor came; I refused the medicine he urged on me. There was nothing to be done, and the pain would soon be over. I slept, I woke. I waited.
Sherlock shrugged. Whatever John might have thought, doing a reunion without him felt horrible. It couldn’t be over soon enough.
“It’s common sense, man! My god, you were drugged! You’re a doctor, so you should know these things. It’s not like spraining an ankle or stepping on broken glass. You’re clearly not in your right mind if you think you can just go home and sleep it off. Think of what could happen! You might accidentally put the toaster in the bath and electrocute yourself.”
I thank you for reading and all your comments. You've kept me going ❤️
I noted that he did not say,
“You could wear your uniform,” Mike suggests.
Maybe he should call him just to get a sense of whether this is even possible.
Sherlock opens the closet, looks at their shirts and trousers hanging together, as if nothing has happened. John’s clothes are all practical, like him. His shirts are checked, his trousers are khakis or jeans, and he has a collection of hideous jumpers. He dresses like a dad, but it’s oddly endearing.
He shrugged. “She could have no expectation of marriage from me, considering my position.”
She returns to the kitchen, sits in John’s chair. She knows her father lives here and has come here because— “You’ve had an argument with your mother.”
“Fanfiction.” She smiled at Sherlock. “Fans of the show writing their own stories, posting them on sites where other people read and comment. There are literally thousands of stories shared this way.”
He has something in his pocket, which he fishes out now. “I know how you feel about drugs.” He remembers how I was after Afghanistan, how I’d gotten myself a bit hooked on sleeping pills, which didn’t help much and made it all the worse when I gave them up. I never told you about that, though maybe you deduced it. You knew about the nightmares. Every night, waking in a sweat, still in the nightmare that haunted me by day. It’s not so different now, just a new nightmare.
He’s been here, and will return in a half an hour.”
“John.” I don’t know what to say next, or even if it’s up to me to say something. I’ve apologised, explained, and asked for forgiveness. He didn’t want to hear any of that then, and probably won’t want to hear it now.
. Smiling, she looked up at him. “We’re going to be seeing more of each other. I just got a guest spot on
It was odd, Sherlock thought, that brief expression. The audience’s boos had angered Brook. Any seasoned actor would expect some boos for the villain, and would take it as a compliment that he had inspired that reaction. Brook seemed almost to have forgotten that he was the villain of this piece.
You know, I really did intend to rescue you. Once again, upstaged.”
“You look like you could use a night out,” he says as he takes John’s money.
ajar when he entered the flat. It was closed. He didn’t remember hearing a click—
“I was just calling because I haven’t seen you in so long. I miss you. How’s school?”
That night I have a dream about her. It’s not the kind of dream you’d expect. In my dream, we’re in a restaurant, having dinner. I don’t know why I would dream this; I haven’t dated anyone in years. We’re talking, and I’m trying to explain something to her, but then I notice a box on the table. It’s a ring box, and I’m supposed to propose to her. When I realise this, I feel uneasy. I want to leave, but the waiter is there, asking me about wine.
I closed the door behind them.
“I’d just like to tidy up a bit, dear, if you’ll let me.” She gestures vaguely. “It’s been days… the things he left lying about… and my goodness, the kitchen…”
It wasn’t enough to go on, not nearly enough. But it had to mean something.
“You’ll have to get to know her,” Molly says. “And if she’s hiding something, I know you’ll find out. Don’t say anything to John just yet, though.”
“Not you, per se. Remember the last time we met in a pub? I told you I was there on a case. That’s why I was at the Rock Garden last night, looking for the same person. Stalking him, not you. I didn’t expect to see you there.” He stretches his back, twisting a bit from side to side. “Just a happy coincidence.”
Holmes nods at Crawford, who looks like he might say something, but then he seems to give up and simply leaves them to try their luck.
“She hates us both equally, then. It does not matter what we achieve; until one of us produces an heir, we are both failures.”
“I’m not planning to fuck you, I’m giving you a massage,” I said. “It’s a thing they do in India, which I learned while I was there. Very relaxing for the muscles.”
After shivering for a long time, I slipped out of my bed, thinking I’d see if there were any embers in the hall fireplace. Even if the hearth was cold, at least the movement might warm me.
“I don’t think we can… I mean, your back is still healing—“
“Yes, we did.” I laughed. “People say life is short, but it isn’t. I never intended to live so long.”
I’ve been existing for a week now, seven days without you. I don’t remember eating or sleeping. I just exist.
I stared into the ruby depths of my wine glass, swirling it and watching the tear-shaped drops slide down the sides. “Your death would have broken my heart, John.”
So why hasn’t he driven him away yet? Any sane person wouldn’t put up with Sherlock’s clutter, his moods, and his experiments.
Occasionally a new one will knock on our door, and we think it’s going to be a case until I observe a Watson nose, or a pair of deep blue eyes, or that inexpressibly dogged stubbornness that says it’s a Rosamund Watson. There’s always something.
“I sent him emails, just as I did to the rest of you. When he replied, it was always short. He never talked about himself. Sally said that he was hanging out with real stars, so maybe he didn’t consider us worth his while.” She shook her head. “ But that can’t be true; John wasn’t like that. I think he was just busy and overwhelmed. I don’t know, though. I never saw him after the final episode party. Just an email here and there.”
“You remember
Watson made the tea, spread some toast with jam, and cut it into triangles. “You must eat something, my dear.”
John touching him, calling him
your date.” He hands them menus and smiles at John, nodding at Sherlock. “This man got me off a murder charge.”
He waits an hour, pacing around, wishing he had a case, or that Molly had something for him to experiment on.
Feeling unusually gracious, Sherlock refills the kettle and flicks it on.
“Oh, this is my own bloody fault, I suppose.”
), he dreaded the day when he’d have to take something just to pay the bills. Mycroft had made it clear that he was responsible for his own success or failure. Being a difficult person to work with was all right when he was in demand, but now that the offers had become scarcer, he couldn’t afford to be a dick, even if that's who he really was.
“I heard Mum tell David that she only married you because she was pregnant. Is that true?”
“I don’t blame him,” he says at last. “But he could have chosen differently. Maybe he would have failed anyway, but he could have got a job and tried. He could have— well, it doesn’t matter now. He lived with his choices. I’ve made my own, I guess, and tried to do better, but I’m sure I’ve made mistakes too.”
He extended his hand. We shook, as gentlemen.
He loved stories about pirates, especially the ones where they were searching for treasure. Pirates might have loved their mothers, but he was sure their mothers didn’t beg,
Others share their stories, their little triumphs, their ongoing struggles. Many of them talk about how good it feels to finally be honest with themselves and other people in their lives. John says nothing, and Greg passes when it’s his turn.
“Of course. He won’t say anything. I told him I would bring you, but all he said was that you’d nothing to do with it. If there’s anything you want me to know, Mr Holmes, you’d best come clean now.”
Rugby wasn’t as toxic, he remembers. There were bullies on the team, and a clear hierarchy of leadership, but a boy could earn respect, however grudging, from his teammates if he played well. Watson had put all his efforts into that, and had succeeded. He was always the smallest, even after two years, but he was the team’s bull pup, an aggressive player who put everything into winning while remaining a good sportsman. When he joined the army years later, he recognised that social order.
He looks out at the dancers, trying to spot Matt or Christopher. He can see Sam over at the bar, talking to a big, ginger-haired bloke. He doesn’t see anyone else he knows.
“Christopher and I are having another party in January. I hope you two will be available.”
“You’ve not read the script?”
At any rate, here he is, outside his building, and the key is here and there is a bed waiting for him upstairs if he can just climb all the stairs to get there.
Irene popped the cork and began filling glasses.. “It’s never been clear to me why a heterosexual couple should be allowed to kiss before nine o’clock, and a gay couple has to wait. You’re not the first, but I think your kiss might be the one to start things moving in a new direction.” She laughed. “And it’s about time! What’s the worst they can do to me? Tonight is a one-shot. I already have a reputation for pushing limits in
John gives a sleepy hum against his neck.
“You’ve just wrapped up the fourth series of
“Still a grape. Not wine yet. You gotta wait.” He giggles again.
While he’s making this mental checklist, Holmes is leaning back in the chair, his eyes closed, his hands together in an attitude of prayer. He’s obviously awake, and doesn’t seem like the type of man who believes in a god who heeds pitiful human requests. At least he’s quiet.
As soon as she leaves, Watson turns to him. “The others… died?”
She lays a hand on his arm. “Sherlock, it was one date. Fifty percent of all blind dates are disasters.”
“I’ll be the judge of that,” I reply. “I’m still your doctor, you know.”
John is sitting right there, on the exam table, putting his jumper back on. Sherlock wants to ask about
Sherlock nodded. “Baz has never had a partner, so when I heard he might be getting a romantic interest, I was not enthusiastic. I argued against it. Irene Adler had been hired to write it, and she was the one who told me. She convinced me that it could be a good story line without ruining the dynamic between Baz and Gavin. John’s going to be playing Ian MacLeod, a doctor who’s taken the position of medical examiner and works with the Yard. It will be contentious at first, as all Baz’s relationships are, but eventually they will be partners. Lovers, I mean. The series will run for two more years at least, and we both have contracts for that long.”
“Is this a joke?”
“I’m not a child John.” Sherlock flushed, indignant.
Sherlock’s eyes opened and closed rapidly as he tried to process the new information. “Oh. Well, that’s… good.”
“John, please. Ahem… She wasn’t helping me anymore,” he shrugged, “so I stopped seeing her.”
John blinked. “Idiot,” he laughed and pushed Sherlock playfully. “So… are you really alright?”
“Well that’s a relief,” John murmured as he pulled Sherlock in for another kiss. This time it was more hesitant, John held back as he waited for Sherlock to catch up. It didn’t take long. Sherlock nipped at John’s lip and the doctor tightened his hand in Sherlock’s hair, moaning his encouragement. Sherlock lapped up the praise and on impulse he climbed into John’s lap. His awkward legs bumped into John’s as he struggled to get comfortable but when he slot into place above John it was perfect. The warmth between them grew and Sherlock revelled in it.
“That’s my line and you still have fifteen minutes.”
John blinked. “Oh.”
Sherlock cocked his head. “The integrity of Marlboro ash.”
“You’re always precise dear,” John mumbled around a mouthful of toast.
“You want my story?” He raised an eyebrow almost surprised that she would but she nodded. “I met him by a complete accident and he blew me away.” John smiled briefly, thinking of all the times they had run down the streets of London, chasing infamous criminals. “It was in the darkest of my days and he took my sorrow and my pain and just… buried them away. My limp,” he pointed to his leg with the stem of his crutch. “Is psychosomatic but Sherlock knew straight away. I stopped limping when I found him. But now… now I can’t leave the house without it. Sherlock was my crutch I guess… Without him, I’m reduced to this.” He threw his head back suddenly, both distressed and frustrated with what his life had become. He seemed to shake himself and he leaned forwards again, the soldier always composed and ready for action. Doctor Wright put away her notebook and continued to study the soldier. “I remember this one time, he had a case in the country and I had work. I remember taking him to the train station and watching him get onto the train. He said he would miss me and for a second I thought I had heard him wrong. But before I could ask him to repeat he had swept onto the train. As it pulled away I saw his hand waving out of the window at me. I had this compelling urge to run after him. Grab the hand and tell him to stay. But I just stood and watched him wave. Baker Street isn’t the same without him. Those bloody newspapers spewing their shit about him. It made me sick. I tried so hard to earn him back the credit he deserved but no one would believe me.” He looked up at Doctor Wright again. “I can’t keep screaming at the world when it doesn’t want to listen.” She smiled sympathetically. “So just to save my voice and sanity I stopped. I know the truth and that’s enough for me. It would be enough for him.” He clenched and unclenched his trembling hand.
“John, John, John!” Sherlock’s legs tightened and his eyes widened. Then John felt something warm between them and he flushed with pride, knowing he had caused that.
Another gust of wind battered against the side of 221b Baker Street, making a horrible moaning sound and the lights flickered above them.
“John…”
“I want bacon now.” He stuck his lower lip into a pout and blinked up at John.
“And what makes you think I will be any different, John?”
“No nothing. Just reminded me of something.”
“He sounds nice.”
Sherlock hesitated, then realised he had no witty response so poured the wine for them both. Another bout of heavy rain hit the windows and John was sure he saw Sherlock flinch.
“Don’t.”
The doctor chuckled, a sound that vibrated against Sherlock’s skin. “You can’t be shy now, not now I know you can kiss like that.”
“I think so,” Sherlock mumbled. “Funny, I expected you to have the crisis at this point, not me.”
John could only stare, pinned by that gaze as Sherlock dropped his hips, pushing his arse against John’s groin. John threw his head back and groaned. “Oh god, Sherlock.” He thrust up and saw stars. How Sherlock knew to move his hips like that, like some obscene exotic dance was beyond him. Somewhere in the back of his mind he thought hysterically: Sherlock Holmes is giving me a lap dance and he was terrified he might laugh even as he thrust up to meet him. So good, so damned good it was almost sinful and John let Sherlock know as he huffed, licked his lips and pulled Sherlock down for more kisses. “Hold… hold on…” John stood and Sherlock squeaked as he wrapped his limbs tighter around the short man.
“No, no no no no!” Sherlock slammed his fits against the arms of his chair as the flat plunged into darkness.
in London. As it turned out, his sister lived in Croydon, which is technically in London, but he wasn’t speaking to her, so it’s possible he wasn’t trying to be deceptive.
“A week?” I considered whether I might not be bored with this agenda. Perhaps there would be a murder, if I chose the venue well, or at least a burglary. “Very well. I will do as you say. But you will not win. I have never see a marriage where one partner did not gain financially.”
“Do you not think it a shame that there are so few female doctors?” she asked. “I know that I always blush when I am examined, even though Doctor Sterling has been my physician since I was a child. Do you not blush, Mr Watson, when you examine ladies?”
John laughs. “God, yes. And so am I.”
Nearly three hours passed before my uncertainty was resolved. When he came through the door, I observed his expression and his demeanour as closely as I had scrutinised any suspect. Disappointment was what I read. The treasure was recovered, and he would remain unattached, like me.
“Rosamund, what do you think you’re doing? Hm? Worrying your mother and me like that— Christ, I’ve been out of my mind, thinking of all the things that might have happened to you. Do you have any idea? Why would you do such a thing?”
The afternoon wore on. My thumbs produced valuable data, and after I cleaned up the mess, I made us sandwiches and more tea. When the bell rang, I assumed it was her mother and went down to meet her. I felt very adult-like, calm and in control.
He feels a cool hand on his face— not his forehead, which is bandaged, but his cheek.
I’m sure you could dig it up on You Tube if you wanted to see it, but I’d rather you didn’t. It was a religious horror film, something like
“Maybe. Or maybe it’s…” He stares into space, his eyes flicking back and forth as if he’s looking at an evidence board. “One sign, three murders, three different methods. Add to that, one failed attempt. Three successes, one failure. Why would he fail after three successes? He already knows what to do… Did he not suss you out adequately? Seems like a mistake you’d make the first time, not the fourth. But… what if it’s.. different people?”
John just wants a cuppa.
She shakes her head. “I couldn’t say anything about his love life. As far as I know, you’re the first. But I have seen enough of the man to know that he’s a sociopath. He gets bored, and will use you until he finds a new pet. That’s what sociopaths do.”
“In fact, I love you.”
“So,” he says. “I still don’t understand. Why me? What do you know about me?”
I thought of Philip.
He says goodbye. “Thank you. You were more than a friend to me. You mattered.” He remembers her that day in the morgue, the days he spent in her flat, recovering. She didn’t have to do any of that for him. She must have loved him, though it’s hard to understand why.
“Yes.”
People always thought the same about actors, he reminded himself. Being a good actor meant making it look so effortless that people assumed you were just playing yourself. It was insulting, really, that very few fans understood what went into creating a role, making it come to life, but that was the price of being good at it, he supposed.
“Why not? Because you’re a man? Men can’t be forced to do things they don’t want to do? Can’t be
Michael is smiling. “We didn’t finish what we started last time, did we? I was so sure, I’d already marked the place where they’d find you. But I’ve thought it through. You see, I could have come in here with a gun or a knife, but I underestimated your fighting instincts before. This time, I won’t make that mistake.”
He’s lived in various way-stations. After leaving his parents’ home, he moved into a dormitory room that he shared with a quiet boy named Mark. John was grateful for the silence; his parents’ house had always been full of noise as well as unused junk. He liked crawling into his narrow bed each night, knowing that there would not be screaming and crashing of crockery in a few hours. In the army, all space was shared space, and he grew used to the camaraderie of it, thankful that it was temporary.
My guests are Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, who are co-starring in the upcoming fifth series of
I thought about how John Watson would handle this situation. He would not argue over the phone with an authoritative school person. He would pick up his daughter and ask to hear her side of the story before reading the
There are nights when he wakes up, looks over and sees Sherlock breathing softly and deeply, feels bony knees poking into his side, and wonders at how his life has changed. He has the maddest man in London in his bed, and gets to follow him into the underbelly of London, help him solve crimes, and make his tea.
“This I’ve got to hear,” Anderson said.
“The kiss, though.”
They were just two teenage boys rutting against one another, mouths hungrily groping. He imagined them long ago, finding one another, confessing their feelings. A private space, maybe a closet? Two boys in a closet, quietly, furtively hurried, afraid of discovery. He didn’t care. Let everyone see. Let both of them be ruined. This was all he’d ever wanted, all he ever would want. He would not deny it.
“I’ve really messed up.” He rubs a hand over his face. “You knew, he said. You helped him with his… plan. I suppose he swore you to silence.”
Mr and Mrs Chadwick were nothing remarkable. He owned a hosiery factory which his father had built up some forty years earlier, buying looms that could produce multiple stockings instead of just one, and expanding his market. No doubt the elder Chadwick had been a shrewd businessman, and his son, the present owner of the business, seemed to be doing well.
. It sounds like so much work. He rubs his eyes.
He used to think about what it would be like to meet his nemesis again, years after they both left school. He’d imagined what he would say, how he would feel. That day in Barts was nothing like those imaginings. All the clever things he’d thought of were gone the moment Holmes turned and looked at him. There’s a name for the phenomenon:
is equivalent to ontological failure.
As I watched him sleep, I understood what a treasure I had in him. I had tested his patience and his loyalty, and he had remained. Though he had a flexible morality when it came to breaking and entering or telling a strategic lie, and a flirtatious nature that made me constantly jealous, he had never wavered in his feelings towards me. Many times he’d told me he loved me, not only in words, but in his concern for me, his loyalty. He’d written me a love letter. When we alone, in the privacy of our bed, he would whisper in my ear,
“He isn’t like that. Love is a disadvantage, not his area, biases his judgment.”
“John…” I whispered, overcome.
“I could come with you,” John says. He looks sad, and Sherlock can just kick himself for not ending it right now.
He draws himself up, crosses his arms defensively. “I told you before. I’m not cut out for this. I didn’t want it, and now that it’s not working, I can hardly be surprised, can I? You and Mike thought I would cure whatever was ailing John Watson. Well, he’s fine— found a job, worked through his gay phase, and reconciling with his family.”
He’s holding his glass, looking down at it and avoiding my face. “And what is this telling you?”
“Your car is out back, gentlemen. Just let me know, and I’ll see you out.”
“The medical applications are numerous.”
“You were ashamed.”
I was speechless for a moment. I could hear Watson’s voice downstairs, joking with Mrs Hudson, her laughing replies. I thought about that first meeting, when I saw John as a beautiful puzzle, a dangerous temptation, an antidote to all that was ailing me.
“He put it into the fireplace, I think, intending to burn it. It must have blown out. The floor was where I found it. I saved it because… well, it didn’t seem right to destroy a thing like that, written with such loving care.”
“Of course I don’t,” Sherlock croaked.
His cheeks flushed with shame. He was Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective. How could he not open and eat a soft boiled egg, bandaged hands or not? It was pathetic. So he resorted to a defence mechanism he usually reserved for Mycroft. “I’m not hungry now,” he tilted his head imperiously.
“But I want to… John?” He looked up.
“What?”
“I’m ready now,” Sherlock pouted.
Once they were positioned and lit, John turned to Sherlock and was surprised to see a glimmer of discomfort on the younger man’s face. He knew that Sherlock wasn’t afraid of the dark, was it the storm perhaps that had unsettled him? The younger man seemed to watch the new shadows caused by the candlelight, as if he saw something in them that John didn't.
“It’s just a sandwich…” he held it up in offering.
“What were you thinking about?”
Sherlock was about to retort when the toast was brought to his lips and he had no choice but to bite. The creamy yolk escaped the bread at the last second and trickled down Sherlock’s lip. He whined in protest.
The detective was batting his eyelids almost obscenely and somehow his eyes were wide. “Surely, you can manage one bacon sandwich for your patient… You’re always telling me I need to eat more…”
For a time, the two men were quiet. John read his paper while Sherlock concentrated on eating, the two stealing secret glances at each other every now and then. Sherlock licked his lips, thinking about the way John sometimes mouthed the words he was reading and cleared his throat. Suddenly, feeling brave he spoke up.
Sherlock looked up, flushed and sweating and he laughed.
“It’s not just bad weather, is it? Three days! Three days of this blasted storm.”
“Why is my egg wearing a hat? A poorly knitted woollen hat to be precise.”
“Don’t be daft Sherlock. You need to keep them on. Just a little longer.”
“Then,” John commented as he slit open the egg and selected a stick of toast to dunk, “it’s a good job you have a live in doctor who can also mind read.”
“Don’t do that,” John chided. In response, Sherlock opened his mouth, giving John a full view of the yellow and white gloop on his tongue. “You’re a pig!” John pulled his head back in disgust but he began to laugh, unable to stop himself.
Sherlock looked down at the half eaten egg. “It’s just too difficult…”
John’s fingers slipped over Sherlock’s chest and waited there a minute as he gauged the detective’s heartbeat. “You’re perfect Sherlock.”
“Tell me from the beginning. In your own time,” she added when he had rest his head in his hands.
John smiled warm and bright. It was a moment of now or never. THE moment and Sherlock couldn’t help himself. He pushed forwards until his knees were pressed up against John’s and the doctor met him half way for the kiss. It was almost premeditated. They fit perfectly, in synchronisation from the moment their lips touched. John’s hand cupped Sherlock’s cheek, his thumb stroked the sharp bone up to his ear and Sherlock shivered in response.
“And I love you too, just for the record. Thanks for breakfast.”
“What’s funny?”
On the street outside a motorbike roared past, the only sound of life in the otherwise silent flat.
John dropped Sherlock onto the sofa and climbed on top of him, their groins meeting again and Sherlock whimpered. John held Sherlock’s wrists steady against the arm of the sofa as he rocked into the detective’s pyjama clad lap. He was so warm, so god damned warm and John nipped at his neck as Sherlock writhed beneath him.
“My friend was worried about me. I haven’t been eating properly and he threatened arrest if I didn’t come see a new psychiatrist.”
“Don’t be obvious John, it doesn’t suit you.”
The younger man flushed at the praise whispered into his neck and he turned his head to hide his face in John’s hair.
“Sherlock?” The detective blinked. “Thought I lost you there.”
“Alright…” Sherlock saw the moment John made his decision. The set of his jaw reminded him of the soldier John was, his battle plan set. Sherlock didn’t have time to react as John moved again to sit beside him, this time with a deliberate distance between their legs. Sherlock almost felt sorry for it. Almost. And then John was leaning forwards and the distance didn’t matter anymore. Briefly Sherlock felt his breath warm across his cheek. John was so close, too close and Sherlock could hardly breathe. Then the doctor’s steady gaze flicked up from the sandwich to Sherlock and the detective couldn’t have looked away, even if he wanted to.
“Sherlock did you hear me? I said I love you.”
“No. Nah, it doesn’t matter,” he protested as Sherlock’s fingers fumbled at the man’s flannel trousers. “Sherlock… it’s okay really…” John’s face turned crimson and he ducked his head as he was pulled free.
“Crumbs,” he whispered hoarsely at John’s questioning gaze.
“Sherlock… Alright, I will if you stop… doing whatever the hell it is you’re doing. Prat.” His chair scraped as he pushed away, grumbling to himself about idiot detectives and even more stupid doctors.
“You’ll ruin those bandages,” he argued weakly.
Sherlock grinned. His hair was mussed, cheeks pink and his eyes shone. He looked positively impish and something in John sparked.
Now Sherlock looked at the doctor more carefully. He studied the exhaustion that clung beneath John’s eyes in heavy bags and the way he held himself at the counter. Ah, so the nightmares were back then. Possibly triggered by Sherlock’s accident. Usually whenever he managed to hurt himself it affected John in some way, most commonly through nightmares and post traumatic incidents. So far though there had been no panic attacks, but he would watch more carefully for them now.
“Are you going to sulk all day?” Sherlock grunted an answer and John tutted. “Don’t be a brat, just because of some bad weather.”
“Yeah… yeah,” John muttered between kisses. Everything was tender, from the brush of lips to the slide of John’s hand to support the back of Sherlock’s neck as he deepened the kiss. Sherlock whined, the noise soft through his gritted teeth. It was almost unbearable.
“Don’t, you’ll get your bandages mucky.” John pulled some kitchen paper off and wiped it away. It would have felt odd, mollycoddling Sherlock if it wasn’t obvious that he was enjoying it, in his own pampered way. He wondered how old Sherlock was when his mother first refused to feed him at the table or cut up his food. Still, Sherlock had a valid excuse now.
“Oh my god. Really?”
John tried to hide his smirk as Sherlock shook his fist at the window.
“John, I-”
“Great. I’ll go check the fuse box.” He stood up, placing a hand on Sherlock’s knee and using it to push himself off the floor.
“Yes. Fuck, yeah.” He moaned as Sherlock moved further down the sofa, angling himself just right beneath Sherlock. “Tell me, if it’s too much…” He slowly lowered himself down into Sherlock’s mouth and watched him carefully. The heat was all consuming and John squeezed his eyes shut as he tried to even out his breathing. He couldn’t come now. Not now. Oh god…
“I needed a new doctor,” he told her. “It wasn’t working out.”
“How about…” John leaned in again. “How about we try again and- and if it’s too much you tell me, yeah?”
“I know, I’m not a child,” Sherlock admonished.
“Well, if you’re going to be a silly bugger with the Bunsen burner then you shouldn’t complain.”
“Yes…” John began to toy with the handle of the crutch, “Greg has been great. A true friend to me after…” He choked on his words suddenly, and that surprised him. “He always calls me in the middle of the night, like he knows I can’t sleep and he just listens to me. Last night was…” He swallowed audibly. “Bad. I wasn’t in a good place and he found me.” John thought back to the previous night where Greg had received a call from a panicked Mrs Hudson and forced John’s door open to find him lying on the floor in a foetal position, Sherlock’s coat wrapped around his shoulders. Greg had picked him up and placed him on the sofa, holding him until the tears stopped. He stayed the night, soothing John’s back as he finally fell asleep. Yes he would be eternally grateful to the Detective Inspector.
“It’s just a lot of information… Sensory… catalogues…”
“Okay?”
Sherlock blinked and John’s stomach dropped. He didn’t say it back. Oh fuck. Why? What had he done wrong?
“Right… you still hungry?”
“It keeps the egg warm until you’re ready to eat it.”
“God I wish you were here. You’d tell me to stop babbling and out with it.” He smiled fondly and let go of his nose. “Greg was with me last night Sherlock. I was pretty bad and he stayed the night. I think I must have been on that sofa with him until dawn.” He stopped to glance over the empty graveyard. “I came because… well because I can’t keep doing this to the people I love. People you love, Mrs Hudson, Molly, Greg… It’s just, sometimes I miss you so much I feel like I could self-combust from the lack of excitement in my life! God, how I long for your bloody violin in the early hours, your damned experiments and the way you swan about, lording it over us at a crime scene. I miss you Sherlock.” He was shaking now and he took a moment to compose himself. “The amount of times I spent waking up in that room upstairs alone. I used to wish that I could lay down beside you after a crap day at the practice or after chasing gangsters or whatever. My dreams were haunted with the image of waking up to see your pale face against the morning sun. But I never said anything!” He struck the cane against the grass. “I never said anything because I was terrified. I knew that like everything I’ve ever known you would disappear one day. So I spent all our time hiding my heart from you. Bloody fool. I never had a chance to tell you so I’m telling you now Sherlock. And you’d better be bloody listening.” He took a deep breath, filling his lungs to maximum before exhaling sharply. “I-" He cleared his throat. “I came to tell you that I have to move on now. For the sake of those we love. I can’t spend my whole life hiding my heart away. So this is it. Goodbye Sherlock.” He placed a hand on the stone, staring for a few moments. Finally he walked away into the rain, leaving his cane resting against the head stone.
Every step made John’s heart feel heavier, almost as if it was pulling him in the other direction. But the wind brushed his ears, as if Sherlock himself was calling him home.  He was leaning on the crutch but seemed to pay no heed to the rain as he stopped in front of the grave of Sherlock Holmes. He stood on the patch, hand pinching the bridge of his nose as he willed himself to find the words he wanted, no, needed to say.
“Wh-”
He cupped John’s face with bandaged hands and sighed softly. It had been so long since Sherlock last held someone like this. And even longer since someone looked at him like that. Sherlock knew the look for what it was and he knew without doubt that he was loved. “Mine,” he growled, possession swelling in his chest until it almost suffocated him.
You don’t look up as I approach, keeping my balance by holding onto the seat backs as the train lurches around a series of bends, but you know I’m here. I can see it in the way your posture subtly shifts. You’re alert, waiting for me.
“I was just trying to get something out of him.”
is my calling. I came to you because I thought you might have the influence to do something about this monster. It seems, however, that the monster has managed you— and everyone else.”
I tipped his face up towards mine. “You’re prettier. And I’d like to see your
Charles took the corner of the flyleaf between his fingers and slowly tore it out of the binding. “Now it’s mine.” He took the title page in the same way, ostentatiously ripping it out, and continued with the next pages, tearing them one at a time from the book.
“I’m not a child, Mycroft. I will figure it out. John and I will be fine. Thank you for your advice. Now, leave.”
He stares off into nothing for a while, then closes his eyes. He looks back at me, his face grim. “I’ve seen jumpers before, and it’s less time than you think.” He takes a large swallow of beer. “Possible? Maybe. Are you saying that the scene was tampered with?”
These days I spend my time alone, thinking.
“I mean, stay at her house. Rosie’s having some problems and she wants me to talk to her. Just for the weekend.”
“It was nothing. Playing rugby. They worry too much.”
“John.”
“Do you not wish to know what I meant?” he asked.
“If you think he’d be open to it, maybe Sherlock could come to one of our sessions. It might be something he’s willing to work on.”
Someone who will tolerate the things that help him cope. Not the drugs; he's given that up. But the violin, the pacing and talking to himself, the irregular hours. Most people have tidier lives; they eat and sleep at regular hours. Having a flatmate who plays his violin at all hours, who takes up space with experiments and leaves clutter all over (
The young man gaped at me. “But I thought… you wanted…”
“What did you train for?” Matt asks.
It has to start with him, he decides. He has to be more courageous, learn how to say who he is and what he wants. With Sherlock and with Mary, he has to stand up for himself and stop avoiding uncomfortable subjects. That’s the only way this will work.
“You’ll come with me, won’t you? Can you?”
men in a series like ours. Having gay characters who are just people, with real interests and problems beyond their sex lives— that would be revolutionary.”
Mike said.
That part of his life is over. He’ll never be a soldier again.
“Death is interesting.” Moriarty takes an apple from the bowl, begins to carve it with a pen knife. “I’ve always thought so, anyway.”
“I never stopped caring about you and your mum, and I didn’t leave because of anything you’d done. Maybe it was selfish, but I’d dreamed about it since I was your age, and I thought it was something I could do for a few years, get it out of my system. Then I was wounded, and I lost everything— I couldn’t be a surgeon, couldn’t be a soldier, and I was losing you as well.”
No. This is not productive. He needs to get past all this sentiment, delete all these memories.
You feel the muzzle of my Browning pressed against the back of your skull, and you wonder,
“My pleasure.” Sherlock smiles and gives a little bow.
There was love of family, an unavoidable love. And there was the love he would reserve for a girl who liked dead mice, which was an unlikely love. And there was courtly love.
“Indeed, Watson, you must take care,” I said. “Your marital bed must be as orderly as an accountant’s ledger. Girls may be conceived on any day of the week, but if you want boys, you must have coitus only on weekends and bank holidays.”
Every life but two.
I place myself between him and the man with the whip, who apparently can’t see me. I’m the dream; what I’m seeing is real.
“You didn’t answer my question.”
He shivers. “It’s cold. Keep me warm, John.”
“My character, Tamara Robbins. You know, the series I’m in.
That’s the only way I can describe it. Not
Suddenly understanding that he is the one being set up, John falls silent. Maybe Sherlock owed Molly a favour. Maybe he lost a bet with Lestrade. Something like that…
She imagines John ringing the bell at 221B. Sherlock is upstairs, sitting in his chair. He’s been playing his violin, and now is just thinking. The flat is empty, so empty without John, and he’s just beginning to realise what that means. He understands how John must have felt that day he returned to the flat alone. He sees the cost of what he had to do, and he would pay it again, to save John. But he will have to live with this emptiness.
“I know,” he says.
“John, I don’t mean to pry into… I only noticed that you’ve been quieter than usual for the last half hour and seem unhappy. You haven’t talked about your wife—“
“Could be, yeah. He might have given up information about somebody big. In exchange, they let him out early, give him a brand new identity.”
First, John Watson, himself.
“So, are you going?” Lestrade smiled at him, that
He pulls Sherlock towards him. “Look at me. Do I look delirious?”
Women aren’t really his area, he’s decided. Dating taught him that. His mates called him Three Continents because he would ask out almost any woman, and most of them accepted
The rest of the evening went well. I managed to talk John onto the sofa and into a James Bond movie. And gay stuff.
,” I repeat. “I’m just so happy you’re back.”
“Have you figured it out?” John asks.
“Well, I’m not holding my breath,” said Sherlock. “To expect the producers of a successful series to take such a risk is not reasonable.”
. He hiccups as Holmes steers him to the door, takes his key, and opens it.
“We will have to test that hypothesis some other time, Watson. I mean no insult to your physique in suggesting that your punch will not be powerful enough to hurt me. It’s simply physics, my good man. No doubt you are a scrapper, capable of scaring off a band of thugs. Physically, though, the best you can do is bruise me. Do not worry that you will cause permanent harm.” I turned my face to the left, exposing my jaw. “Now, be so kind as to assault me.”
“He showed up as I was leaving Barts. We walked back here and talked a bit. He’s sorry, John. You know how he is. He never expects people to care about him, so he acts like an arse.”
When we received the engraved invitation, however, he did actually plead with me very sweetly, asking that we might go. Attending without me was out of the question. Though I hate to watch him flirt with women and chat up good-looking men, I would rather be there, watching his flirtations than at home worrying about them. I trust him completely, but he is sometimes naive, and might let things get out of hand, so to speak.
“Rosamund.” Ms Morstan was obviously used to her daughter’s defiance and was not having it. “We’ll discuss it at home.” She smiled at us. “I’m sorry to have imposed on you. It won’t happen again.”
“But why?” he asked, turning to look at me. “Why will you not help her?”
And gradually he talks about the hard parts, telling me, in bits and pieces, about the times he almost died, the times he almost wanted to, the beatings he endured, the drugs he sometimes took, the long hours without mental stimulation that nearly drove him mad.
“Well, that’s not happening,” my brother replied. “Mummy hasn’t even finished making the guest list. Leave it to me. I’ll let you know when we have a date.”
“Your attachment to him grew, and I waited, reserving judgment. At any point I was willing to separate him from you, and had arranged a way to do that. I could have easily ruined him. But I waited, seeing that you had given up the drugs and were working hard to establish yourself in this career you invented.
“It’s all lies.” My voice shook a bit, betraying my uncertainty.
“Sleeps through the night like a charm,” Bill is saying, as if proud of the fact that his baby knows how to sleep.
, when his hand unexpectedly shoots out and he pulls John to his feet.
“I haven’t let her have one yet. I told her she’s too young, and it would just be a distraction.”
“Am I speaking to Rosamund’s father?” a voice asked. I could hear that she dyed her hair chestnut brown and wore half-glasses on a chain around her neck. She was wearing lavender because people had always noticed how it brought out the green in her eyes. She had two married daughters and a son who had turned out to be quite a disappointment.
Mike sighed. “I know. But maybe you’re not aware just how hard people shipped you two.”
counsellor.”
In the end, he went to Molly’s reunion because he felt guilty about the fan, who hadn’t done anything wrong except become obsessed with a television series that had been off the air for over ten years, forgotten by normal people. Molly and the others would understand what it was like to run into diehard fans, and there was something comforting in that.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Woodley, one of the other shareholders, took a dislike to me. He used to cheat at cards, and I made him look bad. As a rule I do not cheat at cards, but when a man like that is flaunting it in your face, gloating over his gains, well— I am a more skilled sharp and managed to take a pile of money off of him. He resented it and came at me with a gun. I had to shoot him. I am, as you know, a good shot, but I truly did not mean to kill him. Zion told me it was the only way. Clearly self-defence, but his brother claimed that I was the one who cheated, and that Woodson was ambushed by me. Zion heard him threatening revenge and warned me, and I was able to avoid an ambush he set for me. In the end, though, he simply tried to gun me down at the mine. Zion threw me across my horse and got me to safety. I stayed with his family while I was healing. The wound became infected, and his wife kept me from dying. Native medicine has ways of healing never taught in British schools, Holmes. I would go back there just to study their methods. At any rate, while I was healing I wrote to your brother, and here I am— penniless and crippled.”
Anything might be possible. He would work hard, earn his chance.
“Mama is busy with Mrs Gardiner.” Her smile was chilling. “She’s put me in charge of you boys.”
He doesn’t talk much, but sometimes at night, when we’re lying together, he tells me things he thought about and dreamed about while he was gone. He tells me places he saw, the times he felt homesick. He’d thought he was ready for what it would take out of him, and was surprised at how hard it was to keep going.
, Sherlock noted. “No, absolutely not!”
Conversation suddenly feels like too much. He wishes he had just stayed home in his dreary flat and watched an old movie, or read a book, or anything. It’s not as if he’s outed himself; it was understood that neither of them are straight. He just isn’t used to talking about it. In a fit of desperate honesty, he’d told Mike, and— well, here he is. He’s never been on a date with a man, and if the last twenty minutes are any indication, he’s rubbish at being gay.
“Wedding?”
“It’s important to me, and she’d tell me if I were there. Let me talk to her.”
“Maybe you’ve changed your mind.”
His own confrontation with Fake Jason came next. They had practiced it so many times that he shouldn’t have been nervous, but he was. Every single time they’d rehearsed, Brook had some little suggestion, some nuance he wanted his character to have. At one point he’d decided that Fake Jason should touch Alex a lot as a way of seeking dominance over him. Sherlock had thought it ridiculous and annoying, and Irene had agreed. He’d settled for pacing around Sherlock like a panther.
“Do you really want to know?”
feeling he’d had all afternoon. “I think she’s one of those child stars who will always look back on
And Mike smiles so hard, his eyes disappear into his cheeks. “You’re the second person to say that to me today.”
“I don’t think I’ll need my nightshirt tonight,” I said. “Undress yourself and we’ll go to bed.”
When I first hired Watson, I remembered thinking that he would one day leave me and marry. Now it alarmed me to think that day might be imminent. In truth, it alarmed me to think of Watson with anyone else, whether male or female. Miss Ashton-Farbridge had not broken my heart, but it was clear that I did have one. Watson was mine; the freckle-faced girl would not have him.
Bursting through the door, he is about to call out John’s name, but stops when he sees Lestrade.
And now, all of that grief was meaningless. A ridiculous joke, only reinforcing how unimportant he’d been to John. He’d let them all grieve. How could he do that? That’s not what friends do.
He regards John, who is watching his tea steep. Watching very intently. Avoidance, it seems, is the strategy he’s chosen.
I wonder what he has to say for himself.”
It feels different from last time, and whatever he was injected with might be wearing off. In some bizarre, sociopathic way, it makes sense to want your victim alive when you kill them. Very poetic.
He wonders what Sherlock’s family is like. He’s met the brother, briefly, on the night John shot the cabbie. Mycroft works for the government, doing something fairly important and hush-hush. Sherlock says that he
“Oh.” Here it is, the really awkward moment.
“We don’t love
“Short version,” the cabbie said. “Not dead.”
It’s a small mystery that occupies him on the bus ride from Barts. What sort of book would Sherlock order? It must be something out of print, he decides, or he would just find the same content on the internet. Or maybe it’s written in German or Hungarian or some language John has never heard of. The subject? Sherlock has only two interests: crime and music. And he doesn’t read books about music, he plays his violin and occasionally drags John to a classical concert.
I turned in time to see him flee.
He doesn’t look at me.
Day had dawned by the time the two inspectors finished debating whether Watson ought to be questioned in my presence. I’d threatened to wake my brother and have legal counsel sent over before any more questions could be asked.
from the audience and a smattering of applause.
“Here is the truth, Watson: it was not to me that he confessed. I was a student, remember, not an ordained priest. The priest who heard the confession was so unnerved that he told me, in confidence. He also told me the name of the man. I had already decided to leave the priesthood at that point, and knowing my talent for deduction, he said that I must look into the man’s history.”
“We’re talking dates now, so don’t go and commit yourself to anything over the next month,” she said.
“Save it for tomorrow.” He carefully lies back in the bed, turning on his side.
“I wrote you letters,” I said. “Well, I burned them all, so you’ll have to take my word for it. I thought of you all the time, and writing was how I talked to you.”
“Why are you dressed as a clergyman?” he asked.
“Not surprising, really.”
Watson smiles. It’s the first time he can remember when Holmes has said something complimentary without couching it in insults.
“Thank you,” he said, and began his tale. “When I was a young man, I went into the priesthood, not because I wanted to give my life to God. In fact, I was quite certain that God did not exist. For me, however, there seemed to be no place in life— no calling which let me exercise my deductive talents. From a man’s fingers and boots and the knees of his trousers I could tell his profession and see how life had disappointed him. From a woman’s shoes and shirtsleeves and jewellery I could tell what she did to earn money and whether or not she loved someone. If anyone had asked me how I knew this, I could have explained the observations that led me there. Most people, however, regarded my deductions as impertinent and a bit mad. So I became a priest and looked into men’s souls, uncertain whether I had a soul or not.
he realises that this is John’s ex-wife, the one who had an affair and wrote him a
“What sister? You have a sister as well? It’s always something, I suppose.”
He doesn’t remember the house they lived in until he turned three. It was spacious, Harry used to say, though he thinks that’s probably an exaggeration. What does a nine year old know about
The fact that Watson wasn’t willing to ask his brother (okay, it turned out to be a sister) for help only meant that he didn’t want to get dragged into a slough of troubles when he had his own bog to wade through. That, I thought, was sensible.
“Mr Holmes,” she said severely. “You know that young man was devoted to you. It nearly killed him to come back here, all the papers saying how you’d fallen to your death in that awful cataract. He had to make a change of life after that.”
Holmes nods. “One of the staff identified him. It’s Adam Stark, Henry’s friend.”
“We’re already committing burglary,” he replied. “I hope we’ll not add murder to that.”
They were called onto the set and positioned in chairs. Mary Morstan, a petite bottle-blonde with an excess of energy and an annoying laugh, came out and introduced herself.
“I mean, sir, that I do not know about Heaven and Hell, only because there is no evidence of either. Lacking proof, I must assume they are a fiction created to scare people into doing what religion holds to be right. And I do not believe that God is cruel, or that he would cast children into Hell when wicked men and women go unpunished.”
The edges were a bit singed. I unfolded it carefully, revealing a page of Watson’s slightly uneven handwriting. The sight of that schoolboy penmanship brought tears to my eyes. But I feared what the letter might say, knowing he would have been angry with me for sending him away.
John pulled him closer. “Someone I love is fond of saying,
I regarded him silently, not surprised at his stubbornness, but forming another plan. I had no intention of letting him sacrifice himself. Forcing my face into a look of resignation, I sighed as if conceding defeat. “Very well. We will continue together. Tomorrow we will see the falls.”
“That’s right,” said John. “Sally Donovan will have a recurring role as a prosecutor for the Crown. In the opening episode, Anderson is a conspiracy theorist suffering from schizophrenia who is accused of murder. Molly Hooper’s doing a guest appearance as a lawyer representing him. Mike Stamford will have a small part as the person who introduces Ian and Baz, which is appropriate since he’s managing both of our careers now.”
there
“Sister?” John stuck his head around the corner.
“What you really need is not more
is poetry— in its most elemental form. This is beauty and poetry and romance and every bit of philosophy I need.”
“I can’t hear you.” I wondered if he had forgotten how to talk. Since he had no one to converse with, this seemed logical.
I saw him then. He stood shimmering in the green shade of the remaining trees, hovering over his bones. I remembered how he had led me here and I had seen the curved spine, the splayed limb bones, the small skull.
. It was the Argument from Ignorance. All Sherlock had was handful of clues that might look suspicious, but could have perfectly reasonable explanations.
— Theodore Roethke, The Waking
“All right, all right!” Sherlock grumbles into his knees. “Snark doesn’t suit you, Watson. I liked you better when you were blithely bumbling around in bars, looking forlorn and picking up serial killers.”
“John,” he says. “Please come in.”
He could simply ask John what is bothering him, but John would only say
David is the one she said she’d broken up with, but hadn’t. The one she still pretends is just her agent, though it’s obvious that they’re more.
“I’m afraid it’s worse than that,” Holmes replies. He’s smiling his stupid posh smile. “I am, in fact, real. Talking yourself out of it won’t banish me. Come on.” He grabs Watson under the arms and lifts him to his feet. Once they’ve stopped swaying, he puts Watson’s hand on the railing and moves him towards the last flight of stairs. “Lift your foot. That’s it. And warn me if you’re going to be sick. I just had my coat cleaned and am not keen on paying for that again. Rotting fish last time— funny story, but not when you’re possibly about to cover me in sick. So, just a word. Or a tap. You can just tap my arm if you’re going to lose it. I will step aside and let you rid yourself of the poison you have imbibed.”
Mycroft is waiting for me. That’s his patient face, I suppose. Time to go. I nod and get to my feet. Guess I got lost in my thoughts there, for just a moment, thinking about you, trying to remember everything we did together, everything you ever said to me. If I had a Mind Palace, I’d make a room for each day we had together, from breakfast toast to midnight violin.
“You… er… you wanted…” Watson stammered.
The sun is going down and he’s suddenly tired. Sleep doesn’t come to him much these days. It’s been a long time since he’s used himself up enough to go into stasis. Since Watson died he hasn’t killed himself once. There are ways he could do that. He could walk into the ocean now and drown, his body weighted so he would never be found. He wonders what that would be like, to drift forever under the waves.
“It isn’t your fault,” he says. “I don’t know why people want to blame everything on parents, when their first job is to make sure the child is physically safe and cared for, not to be there all the time, catering to their every whim. You are a good parent, and she is just being a normal fourteen year old.”
“I really wanted to tell you, John, but I couldn’t. I’m sorry.”
like somebody else, not your usual stroppy self. You remember how to cooperate with people, don’t you? Yeah, you do. I don’t understand why you have to be a prick about everything, tell them why their movie is stupid and poorly written. And you make demands— Sherlock, you’re not well-known enough to make demands of big-name producers. You’re just an actor who’s had moderate success in two series, only one of which is widely watched in the States, and done well in a couple movies no one has seen. You can’t afford to be a prima donna.”
She handed him a small box. “You’ll want this, I suppose.”
Not that I have ever entered such a state. I am at all times a scientist, determined to understand phenomena within the laws of nature. I do not know why I was given this talent, but I would not waste it on seances, though that might have brought me a tidy income. Money was not my objective; knowledge was what I sought.
He’s not ready to forgive that, but he is beginning to wonder if he could understand it.
He laughed. “Was your adventure with Miss Ashton-Farbridge not enough romance for you? If you want seducing done well, you might have asked me.”
By the time the clock was striking midnight, I had worked myself into a thoroughly pitiful state. When I heard Watson come through the door, his feet on the stairs, I did not rouse. I stayed in my chair, hugging my knees and staring into what remained of the fire, those dying embers symbolic of all I had lost.
“You may rely on me,” he said.
“Miss Wickham suggested that we two go to see a musical, and so we did. We were able to get tickets to
I read the telegram, cursing silently. Moriarty had evaded the trap. Though his underlings were captured, his organisation broken, he would not hesitate to come after us. Indeed, he had most likely already traced us to Switzerland.
Holmes looks exhausted. They plan to take an afternoon train back to London, refusing Huxtable’s offer of another night’s lodging. Wilkes is packing his bags, the headmaster tells them. Carmichael has been sacked as well, but probably can’t be prosecuted for his role in Adam’s death.
He gives a one-shouldered shrug. “Who’d want me as a flatmate?” It’s the same question he asked Stamford. Maybe she can dig up another old enemy for him to obsess about.
And the whole time Holmes was deducing him, telling their classmates that Watson wanked to pictures of Johnny Depp, he was probably wanking to equally embarrassing pictures. He was walking around the Priory campus, gayer than a picnic basket, checking out guys and rating their hotness, lying in bed at night and fantasising about that boy in maths class.
“It’s all right,” he whispered. “You can be sentimental. I won’t tell anyone.”
Once they’re seated with the tea, things begin to feel more normal.
In the morning he woke to an empty bed. Sounds were coming from the kitchen. Slipping on his dressing gown, he padded down the hallway, stopping at the loo to relieve himself. Proceeding on to the kitchen, he stood in the doorway for a moment to watch John.
“Calm yourself, Watson. The trap is already laid. Shooting him, however satisfying, would have ruined the work of several months.”
“I don’t blame you.” Really, I don’t. At first I didn’t know what to think, but when I saw how he nearly lost his job and is still doing penance for working with Sherlock, I have to believe that he was just as much in the dark as I was. “You didn’t have much choice about what happened. If it hadn’t been you, someone else would have done it. I do blame Donovan and Anderson, though.”
Something is vibrating. He can feel it in his arse. No, it’s his thigh. His pocket. Ah, his mobile phone.
chair, the squashy red one, drinking a cup of tea. Sherlock will have to make an effort to clean up all the mess that now surrounds him, and probably warn him about the violin.
To do this, he has to open a door in his Mind Palace that he’s kept closed and locked for years.
“Why do we have to do this? The script is so… bad. And nonsensical. I can’t play that role again. I feel like I’m going to be Alex Tribble for the rest of my life.”
Sleep is risky. It brings back those minutes when I couldn’t fathom that it was too late, followed by the moment I realise you’re dead. A horrible, endless cycle of hope and despair. In my dreams, you’ve died more times than I can count. Every time I wake up and realise you’re gone, I want to die, too.
“How’s the pain?”
“Oi, that look may work on Mrs Hudson but it sure as hell won’t on… me… Sherlock… Sherlock stop it.”
“I think that ship sailed when you nearly set fire to the kitchen.”
“What?”
John looked up from his book as the rain lashed against the windows, the wind slamming into the glass simultaneously. Across the room Sherlock snarled in response.
************************************************************************
Silence fell on the room. John inched forwards and carefully lowered his mouth over the food, all the while looking at Sherlock. The detective could have sworn he felt John’s lips, through the bandages and against his fingers which twitched in response. Sherlock didn’t even feel any pain in his burned hand as he brushed his padded thumb over the corner of John’s mouth.
“Okay, well, they’ll come back on soon.” He walked into the kitchen and mourned that the power had cut before the kettle boiled. Well, might as well make the best of the situation. He grabbed two wine glasses and the bottle of red and carried them, along with some cheese and crackers in to Sherlock again.
“It needs salt.” His voice was surprisingly gruff, deeper than usual and John watched him for signs of pain as he salted the egg.
John was mesmerised and he stroked Sherlock’s lip, touched where his skin was stretched over John’s cock and when Sherlock moaned it echoed through John. He brushed his thumb over Sherlock’s cheek and felt how full he was. It was incredible. And then he moved. Knees pressed against the sofa on either side of him, he began to rock into Sherlock’s mouth.
“Shy boys don’t kiss like that.”
“Why is that Doctor Watson?” She asked, leaning back into her plush leather chair.
“John! What are you-?” He closed his eyes as John carried him over to the sofa. It defied logic that John should be strong enough to lift someone like Sherlock, but here he was, surprising Sherlock yet again.
It was over too quickly, John couldn’t help himself. He squeezed Sherlock’s wrists, even as he moved faster, deeper and then he pulled out just in time. He came with a strangled groan, his face pressed into Sherlock’s neck.
“It was a controlled exper-” Sherlock whined as John stuffed another mouthful of egg into his open mouth. It nearly dribbled out again but Sherlock caught it just in time and chewed noisily, just to annoy John.
“John…”
“You’re the one who wanted an egg.”
And Sherlock loved it. His eyes began to water but he never once blinked, never looked away from John and he tested John’s grip against his wrists. When John didn’t lessen his grip Sherlock moaned, his eyes rolled back and he sucked harder as something visceral sparked in his gut.
Endlessly patient, she says nothing. Sometimes he wishes she would sigh or roll her eyes or just call bullshit on whatever he’s saying.
He looks greyed out now, but that might just be the fluorescent lights in the dairy aisle. Nobody looks good while shopping at Tesco.
“There was no case,” the DI insists. “Why do you keep saying that?”
He opens his bedside drawer and find the lube he stashed there, anoints his fingers. John watches, his pupils dark in the dim light.
His fist coming at my jaw was one moment in time. Lying on my back, looking up at the sky was another. I do not remember the moment in between. Reaching up, I felt the side of my face. He had not hit my jaw, but further up, near the temple. I assumed this was why I felt dizzy.
“I’m not a burglar.”
The block where John Watson lives is dismal, a honeycomb of tiny cells with single occupants. Sherlock walks down a poorly-lit hallway that smells of dampness and old cooking grease. These are flats where people live because they have no other choices. In one of these cells, John Watson is probably preparing tea and toast for his supper, or maybe a packet of instant noodles. No one would willingly live like this unless they were desperate.
“All right.” Watson shivers a bit. “Chilly morning.”
Sherlock’s expression falls from triumph to exasperation. “
Dear John,
“You think I’m moody?” He’s surprised at how ready he is to pick a fight.
They undress each other, giggling a bit as they do, and slip between the sheets. So far, sex has meant either oral or hand jobs. John has said that he’s never done anything else with a man, and so far they haven’t tried any penetration. Sherlock has been waiting, letting John become more comfortable with the idea of that before pushing him.
, yes. He is. Horny as well.
“You’re him,” the woman said. “Alex Tribble. I used to watch you every Friday night.”
“I make allowances because he’s fashion-impaired,” he explains. “Very sad to know that there are people who cannot dress themselves.”
Watson doesn’t respond. What can he say? It’s true that he has blamed Holmes. He still hasn’t forgiven him for what he did, and even though it was his own choice to stoically ignore him instead of punching out his lights, there might have been other things he could have done. But he was sixteen. It might have felt good to hit that smug face, but he couldn’t afford to get kicked out of school; it would have meant giving up.
Watson shudders again. Lestrade gives Holmes a look that is probably familiar to him. Holmes rolls his eyes. An exchange they’ve had many times, he thinks.
Holmes sighs. “It would be irresponsible to form a conclusion without complete evidence, but I believe you are right to suspect foul play.”
“Many,” said Lestrade. Gregson reluctantly nodded.
“I’m not being metaphorical, Watson. The word means exactly what you think it means. He was cut open.” Making a motion from the base of his throat to his pubic bone, he gives Watson a smile that can only be described as creepy. “The first one’s throat was cut, and the second one was stabbed multiple times in the gut. Obviously he’s escalating, gaining confidence and becoming more violent.”
“We’ll go to the Register Office tomorrow. You, me, and cake.”
“That thing. Where you seduce me with science.”
“So… will you? Move in with me, I mean. Or if you don’t like Baker Street, perhaps we can find something bigger, more private.”
Moriarty pauses, smiling. “We’re alike, yes, but not in the way you think. We both ruthlessly pursue what we want. Unfortunately, what you want is ordinary. You want John Watson. At this point, you don’t really care about the secret. You just want him back. And you’re willing to do anything for that, aren’t you?”
“We ourselves were figuring it out at the time,” Sherlock added, smiling at John.
“Beehives.”
“I don’t know what to call Sherlock— boyfriend or partner or lover— and feel embarrassed about that. Not embarrassed about him, being in a gay relationship, but just not knowing how to present myself to other people. And I didn’t realise that guy at the gym was flirting with me. And I’m not… I don’t… Sex is different. I’m not good at it.”
He stops looking at his email; Lestrade knows not to bother him with cases. No client can pull him away from 221B. He gives his full attention to watching John. On a spreadsheet, he catalogues how many cups of tea he drinks, how often he falls asleep and for how long. He asks John questions several times a day, just to check his memory, and he makes off-hand remarks to check his reactions. All this data he records for analysis. When he brings John back for his checkup, he will know exactly what he needs to ask.
His mood lightens as soon as the door closes behind him.
They eat and drink in silence for a while, waiting for the police to finish briefing Huxtable. A number of phone calls will be made this afternoon, Watson predicts, to trustees and parents.
“It seemed a type of poetic justice,” I said. “We did not involve ourselves because proving our story might be difficult. And by now all the evidence you might have found that would corroborate our story has been thoroughly trampled by your dim-witted constables.”
of January, 2010, he would make the same choices. He would ask to borrow the phone, invite him to move in, and he would silently love him.
“He was a juvenile detainee. I don’t know what he did—”
Irene nodded. “Of course. Molly suggested that we dedicate the performance to John’s memory. An announcement will be made before we transition from the retrospective to the live performance. Ticket sales are being donated to suicide prevention, and there will be a couple of breaks, public service announcements where hotline numbers will be shared.”
“We’re taking a well-deserved holiday,” Sherlock said. “I’m sure we’ll both have some offers by then.”
“I see. Perhaps you should call her.”
“Miss Agatha Downs, Milverton’s housemaid. I’ve been walking out with her each evening, and talking.” I shook my head. “Good heavens, those talks! But I have what I need— the layout of the house, Milverton’s habits—”
Holmes follows. “The doctor said you shouldn’t be alone.”
“Look, it’s fine if you don’t feel the same.”
He tries. “I felt alone most of the time. I didn’t understand how things worked, so I stuck with my team when I could. They tolerated me, like a mascot. I suppose that was the best I could expect, under the circumstances.”
The waiter returns and lists the specials. Sherlock insists that John order first. The fish special sounds all right, but he’s sure that they don’t serve it with chips here. “I’ll have the salmon.”
“Theme?”
“I’m Jasmine. Ariel and Elsa are meeting me here.”
He considered putting water on for tea, but poured himself a glass of wine instead, sank into his favourite chair, and sighed deeply. An existential sigh.
“I’m not going out. I just need to…” He shrugs.
“Let me,” John says. He slides down, puts his head on Sherlock’s belly and takes him in his mouth. It’s good, but the mood has passed, and Sherlock realises that he’s softening as well. He lets John try for a while, and then pushes him off.
“I could explain,” he says, “but you will find it hard to believe. Short story: not dead.”
I sat daily at my lessons with him, as Charles and Emma were three and four years older, respectively, and had already learned their first year lessons. As they laboured over geography and multiplication, I sat beside Edwin whilst the new governess, Miss Garvey, attempted to teach him his letters.
No more trains, he decided as he hailed a cab. No more reunions, reruns, or ill-considered sequels. And no more fucking aliens. Never again.
Miss Morstan smiled at Watson, who turned scarlet as she sat in the chair.
“Same thing,” he snaps. “You surprise me. This—“ He gestures around the room. ”I have no words for
He was speechless for a moment, and I could see that my argument had convinced him of something. Unfortunately, it was not what I had hoped.
“I shall expect visits to my cell.” Grinning, he began to climb the trellis. I watched, admiring his athletic movements from below, this being the real reason I wanted him to climb. I imagined those strong legs wrapped around me, as they no doubt would be later.
Mrs Hudson giggled. "Oh, don't worry. There's all sorts around here. Mrs Turner's got married ones."
“Why are you here, Mycroft,” I grumbled.
He shakes his head. “No more restaurants. That wasn’t me that he met. I don’t even know who I was last night, but it didn’t resemble me at all.”
“Oh, don’t encourage him,” I said, rising to open the door for Mrs Hudson and her tea tray. “He’s quite lazy enough without being reminded of it. I have to fend for myself these days.”
In addition to his depression, the PTSD, and the psychosomatic limp (
“And you have a right to be angry.”
He might have been irritated, thinking that the man had looked him up, pried into his life. No, that was impossible. It was just by chance that he’d run into Mike and followed him to Barts.
“Bohemian. Think on it, Watson. There’s money in this case, if nothing else.”
I decided this was fine. “Would you like some tea?”
“Bed?” He says this in a way that implies that neither of them are sleepy, but there are other things they could get up to in bed.
before me?”
Sherlock slides his hand over John’s buttocks, slipping his finger just inside his hole. He hears John gasp and feels him shudder a bit.
Rising from his chair, John follows him, stands at the kitchen door watching him run water, rinse the cups, and place them on the drainboard. He turns and faces John, still shirtless.
John assumed his Captain Watson Stance: back straight, arms folded across his chest, gaze level. “You need to tell us your name.”
“It has to do with Richard Brook.”
“Well. Sherlock Holmes.”
), at the news (
.” He’s not sure how he’s managed to pull these syllables out of his brain, but there they are. It’s like a magic trick, only the magician is completely pissed.
“Such behaviour is learned in an environment where it’s allowed to exist,” Holmes replies. “Bullying is part of a masculine culture that rewards the most brutal.”
“I’ve been trying to reach you for days, Mary. What’s going on?”
She frowned. “I suppose it being a Pygmy makes it all right. I just hate to think of some Christian soul missing its head in the afterlife.”
“Yes, I want to learn,” I said.
“She’ll be in school, John. She’s used to coming home, letting herself in. Just come after work, make sure she eats something and does her homework.”
All couples have arguments. For his parents, it was part of who they were. They fought constantly, occasionally grabbing and pushing and slapping. Sometimes throwing things. John knew this wasn’t normal, and was always terribly embarrassed when it happened in front of other people. When John was ten, his dad left after a particularly violent argument, drunkenly crashed his car into a tree, and died. At the funeral his mother still had bruises.
Irene put her manicured hands on her hips, daring anyone to have a problem with it. “There was an opening in the schedule when another programme was delayed. I told them we could be ready.”
“I’m not refusing on any sort of principle,” I replied. “You know what kind of man I am.”
“John.”
“You’re fine,” a voice says.
He blinked the tears out of his eyes and noticed that they were nearly home. The cabbie was slowing down, looking for a place to pull over.
“Okay, I’ll start with Sherlock’s call. He sounded frantic—“
That last one he deleted before sending it.
Just as he’s thinking this, a sign. John has put his hand on the seat, next to Sherlock’s. His pinky finger loops over Sherlock’s, a small gesture, a test to see whether they can just declare a truce.
Discouraged, he hung up.
“… keep an eye on him, won’t you?” Sherlock is saying.
He thanks his landlady and eats the soup himself.
“Well, yeah.”
Relieved, he stood and came forward, tentatively put his arms around John, and planted a chaste kiss on his lips.
“Take them off,” he demands.
As soon as he was home, Sherlock stripped off all his clothes and took a shower. He felt literally dirty, physically unclean— and he hadn’t even had a scene with Brook yet. Once he’d let the hot water pour over his shoulders and down his back for ten minutes, he started to feel a bit better.
“No,” he whispered. “It doesn’t. I love you. And I won’t let anyone hurt you— ever again.”
