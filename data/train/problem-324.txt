He could hear and feel Sherlock's heartbeat like this, strong and regular beneath his ear. He rested his other palm against Sherlock's chest and Sherlock held him firmly around his waist. He knew he was drifting off and he didn't want to, he wanted to stay awake to appreciate what they were doing, finally, together in each other's arms.
John supposed they would need to stop kissing to talk about it. And he didn't want to stop kissing. He didn't think he would ever get enough of this actually, kissing Sherlock Holmes - he never would have thought it possible.
"Sherlock," he whispered, warmth spreading through his chest at the thought of Sherlock doing this. He reached out cautiously and stroked a pale cheek. "Sherlock." Sleepy eyes opened to gaze up into his. "Hi, how are you feeling?" he asked softly.
"Ah, John, glad you made it," Sherlock said, turning around to him. "Would you like a drink before we go in? We still have a few minutes."
"Yes, meeting Mike after work, I told you." John watched Sherlock for a while, trying to judge his mood, but as often happened he was closed off, not exactly an open book at any time, but right now John had no idea whether he was annoyed, upset, nonchalant... "If you need me, I can meet him downstairs instead for a coffee. Or I can stay?" he tried.
"John," he heard above his reverie. He looked back into Sherlock's eyes and saw warmth there too. He wondered if that expression was purely a reflection of John's own feelings - there was no way they could both feel this way about the other.
John resisted the urge to help Sherlock up, mainly because he really needed to take a piss. He followed Greg instead and when he emerged from the toilet, still in his socks, Sherlock was leaning on the front desk, glaring at anything that moved.
"Taxi," John called before Sherlock could get very far, and before he knew it John had taken his hand and was pulling him into the back of a cab.
John withdrew from the kiss with an unintended slurping sound. He leaned up on his elbow, chewing on his bottom lip, staring at Sherlock as he held John's other hand in place. "Oh, nice," he said, grinning.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "Hmm," was his only response, followed by John being shoved backwards again and Sherlock managing to straddle his thighs, despite the sheet, which was pooled loosely around his hips, exposing so much lean, pale, skin John's own chest was heaving again just from the proximity. He currently had a solid erection and if Sherlock moved just an inch further into his lap, he would know all about it.
The cab was going as fast as it could, John assumed, but it was still taking too long. He was avoiding looking over at Sherlock, trying to calm himself after that kiss. At this point John couldn't even really blame Sherlock for the state he had found himself in at Angelo's, the poor man must have thought there was something wrong with his food, they spent so little time in there, even after booking. He surely assumed Sherlock had a case to rush off for, he couldn't possibly know that he and John were fucking, and Sherlock had assured him he hadn't said anything.
John swallowed heavily. Sherlock wanted, what - "More of this?" he asked, tentatively giving his knee a light squeeze, fully aware of where his hand was now.
He stopped dead for a moment, pressing a hand to his chest, stumbling and leaning on the shop doorway beside him, letting the tightness subside. He felt tears spring to his eyes.
John smiled, hiding the disappointment that Sherlock hadn't imagined that they were on a date, even if just for the experience of it. He did appreciate Sherlock's easy manner and the confirmation that he was making about their friendship.
John studied his reflection in the mirror on his wardrobe, stifling another yawn. Tired. He just looked perpetually exhausted. He certainly felt it right now after the worst night's sleep in some time. He was certain he had heard the bloody birds singing before he even closed his eyes.
John frowned and shook his head, adding a definitive, "Nu-uh, and can you please not bring up memories I'd rather not be having just now?"
He turned back and John was staring, waiting for a response. Sherlock frowned. "What was what?" he asked. He had pulled on his jacket but left his coat over one arm, giving John a better view. He knew he'd like that.
. And Sherlock's lips were beautiful; plump, soft, parting to clack their teeth together oh-so-gently, tongue lightly tracing the tip of John's...
John spat out some toothpaste to cover his surprise. Sherlock was leaning against the door and he moved to sit on the edge of the bath.
He looked at his toes, couldn't quite drag his eyes to Sherlock's face again, words started to come out of dry lips and he cleared his throat.
"Same thing I always do when I start thinking about you too much," John began, and Sherlock turned to him wide-eyed. John swallowed and held his nerve. "Think about all the things that really piss me off about you. That always helps." He allowed a small smile.
Still watching John he made a quick motion with his hand and murmured, "The same, please." Angelo moved off with a thank you from John. "What is it?" Sherlock asked softly.
John hustled Sherlock up the front steps, Sherlock got the door open and a quick glance around told John they were alone. He kicked the door closed and shoved Sherlock against the wall, sliding his hands around his hips as he moved in on him. Sherlock didn't even seem taken aback, he still had a grin on his lips until John kissed him and it felt so good, to be making the first move finally, to not feel the need to ask permission, he knew - Sherlock wanted this too.
"It appears that our bodies know what to do. If I can just turn this off," he tapped his temple, "then we'll be fine."
John swallowed. "Ah, yes, yes, love to, thanks." He grabbed a corner of the dark grey sheet and tugged it back enough for him to sit down, kicked off his slippers and shuffled into the bed. Sherlock lay down beside him and pulled the covers up to his chin, turning to face John.
"Oh. I hope you didn't get that awful bread again, the toast is like cardboard," Sherlock said, finally looking around, gloved hands dripping over the sink as John held up a loaf with an eyebrow raised. "Ah, well, thankfully I do in fact like the taste of cardboard."
And John had made a terrible mistake making Sherlock wear something so sexy, something that John had bought for him. He swallowed hard as Sherlock flopped onto the sofa.
Sherlock moved towards him, within arm's reach when he spoke again. "I am glad that you told me," he whispered. "I don't know that I've responded in the way that you would have liked, but I'll try to be more aware of your feelings in future."
John sat back a little. "Hey," he began, but Sherlock's soft smile made sure his words didn't do anything more than make John smile at himself. He knew he'd been covering his own feelings with a string of meaningless relationships. He only wished he'd realised it sooner. "There's not been anyone for months."
Sherlock smiled and they went their separate ways again, John changing quickly in his room before padding back downstairs and seeing both the bathroom and Sherlock's bedroom doorway open.
Sherlock sent the text and went to get dressed. This time they would meet at the restaurant. No distractions - an actual dinner. A date. A real, honest date where they both knew what to expect.
to look, he saw how serious and concerned his friend actually was. "Sherlock, you didn't forget a thing, this is great, really, it tastes... great."
"You like them?" Sherlock asked pointlessly. That was another thing that he had found himself doing recently, adding unnecessary fluff to conversations. He blamed John entirely. Of course John liked them, Sherlock could quite easily see the affect that this pair of rather tight jeans was having on his friend. He toyed with the collar of his shirt for a moment, one hand on his hip while John looked on, nodding.
But for now they both set about struggling out of their clothes. John rolled off him, shoved his trousers off, kicking off his shoes at the last moment and helping Sherlock with his, before Sherlock pushed his jeans down and off. Shirts were thrown over the side of the bed and John lunged back on top of Sherlock's lithe body and kissed him again.
"You'll need to be a bit more specific, dear, I have noticed he's brought his laundry downstairs more frequently."
They had nothing on that morning and so they had more tea, sat side by side on the sofa and watched a repeat of a David Attenborough documentary. It was nice, relaxing. Or rather, it would have been nice and relaxing if it hadn't been for their morning confessions.
"Well, shit," John let out in a whisper. He had known for a while, of course, that Sherlock was working it through, processing it, but the thought of him coming up with the two of them separating - he held his breath, not able to think beyond this moment, to let himself fall into the chasm of devastation that would be Sherlock telling him it was over.
What John didn't expect was Sherlock appearing at the top of the stairs as he was pulling on his coat.
A group of loudly chattering people jolted him out of his thoughts and he cleared his throat, rubbed at his eyes and drew himself up to his full height once more.
He was looking sort of... John couldn't put his finger on it - out of sorts. "How about you?" he asked, never expecting much in the way of detail, but maybe one day Sherlock would surprise him.
"Shall we go?" Sherlock said and he couldn't avoid another handshake from Angelo before he swept his arm out around John, not touching him, not here, and let him lead the way outside. Angelo thrusting him his coat as they went.
John pulled off his jumper and smoothed down the lightblue shirt underneath. He picked up his menu and began to wave it around his face. "It's warm tonight, isn't it?"
John shook his head sadly, so polite. A part of him wanted Sherlock to shout and scream at him and to lash out. That was the selfish part though, the part of John that thought a mirror of his behaviour would make it all a little easier to forgive.
Sherlock smiled. "Because I love you, and I want you to live with me again. I think it's the only way to try to get back to what we had, don't you?"
"I thought you were out," John said, desperate to just leave. "For God's sake, I knew this was an awful idea."
Sherlock's eyes were closed when John dared to open his again. John reached out to him, put his hand on Sherlock's good shoulder. "I promise you, I won't ever feel this way about anyone else."
Sherlock smirked. "Of course I did." He raised a hand and stroked the backs of his knuckles down John's cheek.
"I've started therapy again, right away, I've had three sessions already, it's daily, until I can get my head together. I've stopped the drink, no more of that."
John called his sister that night, worrying that he would change his mind if he didn't do it straight away.
Sherlock wouldn't normally be out of bed by now and here he was, busy with something that thankfully didn't look like his normal experiments. They hadn't elaborated on the bed-sharing thing last night, he hadn't dared to press the issue. John had woken several times reliving their hug, wishing he could hold Sherlock in his arms again. Sherlock had finally made a decision about their situation, but that didn't stop the turmoil in John's head wondering what would happen from here. Maybe today he would bring it up again, but for now, he needed to eat.
John looked at her with his head tilted, trying to believe her words. He had never seen that. Sherlock dismissed him as often as he did everyone else in his life. Until this recent spate of socialising, and odd moodiness. "So, what should I do? He's really trying to make some sort of effort, coming out for drinks, dinner - he took me back to Angelo's, but he made sure to let us both know that it wasn't a date." Just as John had done the first time they'd been there together... "What the hell is he doing?"
John managed to gently disentangle himself and reached for Sherlock's hand, rather more discreetly holding it close beside their bodies. Although by this point there was no need to be discreet.
Sherlock was watching him closely, clearly hoping to take some of the blame onto himself, but John wouldn't have it.
Finally, John drank up the last of his pint and eased back in his chair. "I think that's me," he said through a stretch. "Let's do this again, when I have more energy."
"No, thank you, I'll eat later, I have to get to Scotland Yard, apparently Lestrade has forgiven me and needs my help with something or other."
John nodded, forehead brushing against Sherlock's curls. God, he did need a drink for this conversation. No.
"Something or other, well that sounds important. What about me?" John asked, spreading peanut butter on his bread because he was running late now and there was no time for grating cheese.
. I started all this. Maybe I needed a bit of help," he conceded, "while you worked through your stuff." While John's own feelings deepened and he tried to work out what he would do if Sherlock didn't come into his arms... "But it's ok, we're ok.
"Because you are an insatiable romantic yourself John. I've always known it," Sherlock told him. "Now," he said loudly. "Can all of this business wait until the morning? John and I do have plans you know." Mrs Hudson immediately took to her heels and bustled out of the room, holding the door as she waited for Greg.
"My fault. I didn't ever expect her to just turn up here. I would have told you more about her if I'd known."
He relaxed into the second half, knowing the real reason for being here and so glad of it. He stole a look towards Sherlock whenever he could, so close beside him, apparently as taken in by the production as John was. John wanted to hold him, touch his hand, put an arm around him as he could see other couples doing. He kept both hands firmly in his lap, mirroring Sherlock's position beside him.
"Can I - can I touch you?" he asked, faltering because he had never thought about how good this might be. Of course he fucking had, he had dreamed it. But he hadn't let himself feel it, he hadn't dared. And this was too close to perfect. But Sherlock nodded eagerly, laid out underneath him, flushed cheeks, chest rising and falling rapidly.
John read the text vaguely before putting his phone down and continuing on with his paperwork. Must be a case, but Sherlock hadn't mentioned anything. Still, it wasn't unusual for something to crop up that Sherlock simply
John really wanted to lean his head against Sherlock's shoulder and close his eyes as well. He kept his eyes on the streets outside and eased back on his own seat, trying to get comfy for the short journey whilst ignoring the swirling warnings of nausea in his stomach.
"I did?" John said, looking around as if whoever it was might still be there. "But I wasn't here," he added pointlessly.
"No, no, it's fine, that's... yeah, great, I just thought- it's no problem at all. Shall we go?" He cursed inwardly at his fumbling, but Sherlock only smiled at him as they went out into the hall.
Suddenly, worried that this might be the end of it if he wasn't careful, John said, "We'll talk about this tomorrow, though, ok?"
They held hands until the cab turned into Baker Street and then John reluctantly pulled away to reach for his wallet. He shoved the notes through the little window to the driver, a quick thanks and they were outside on the pavement.
"What?" John asked, frowning. Sherlock shook his head and smiled, and John found himself simply smiling back. "Well, all right then. Take your turn, Mr Detective."
"Oh, nice, a single?" John turned to look through the tiny barred window behind him and caught sight of the officer shaking his head at them both.
John felt the tightness in his throat as he took in Sherlock's words. He couldn't speak so he kissed him instead, a chaste, gentle meeting of lips. Sherlock held him close, not releasing him after the kiss.
Because the endless hours of the night were more of a torture to him than the dreadful waking hours of the day.
He saw Sherlock move from the corner of his eye, standing up, moving back a step. John turned hurriedly to him. "I shouldn't have come," Sherlock said, in a rushed half-question. "I... John, you should have said something, I wanted to try and get to know this other side of you, but-"
John sighed and let his head loll back against the wall. He didn't have a problem sleeping anywhere, but he would definitely have preferred his bed right now. Or even better, Sherlock's. He took another look towards his friend and Sherlock was already asleep, curled on his right side, facing John with his eyes closed and hands tucked up under his chin.
John was on the edge of his seat and he reached out for Sherlock's hips, grasping for him tentatively through the bunched up sheet. "Please," he whispered.
Maybe he should leave the damned dressing gown here, just forget the whole idea. But the girl had already rung up the sale and John found himself handing over his card and taking the bag from her when she was finished. He walked out of the shop, trying to pretend he was fine, the bag clutched in one hand. It was only a sodding dressing gown - Sherlock would either like it or not. It wasn't a big deal.
Sherlock was gasping out words, thumping one hand on the floor while he grabbed at John wherever he could find purchase with the other. John was spurred on by the completely uninhibited display from his friend. He had seen him excited by a case, or by a cup of tea even after a long day, but he had never seen this.
"I think, we may need to be even closer, if I'm to succeed in my work, as well as in a relationship with you," Sherlock said slowly.
"I think it's fair to say that you started these relationships the wrong way around," Sherlock continued on, apparently oblivious to John's discomfort, or maybe just enjoying it. "Did you make friends with any of these women first? Was there anything between you that made you enjoy their company, first and foremost, as opposed to their bodies?"
John realised that nothing was going to be achieved here unless he and Sherlock separated, but Sherlock didn't seem to want to let go.
"I want to be as close to you as possible, John, I don't want you to miss out on anything that you could have with someone else." John shook his head but Sherlock held up his hand to stop any argument. "Please, let me explain."
Sherlock grabbed his hips and pulled their groins together. John swore under his breath as his hard, straining cock pressed into Sherlock's.
He asked Mary to make a cup of tea for when he woke up, and handled his next three appointments as quickly as he could.
John wanted to punch the git, whoever he was. But he stayed calm. "At least it's not a memory to regret," he tried.
"Hey, hey," John said, taking his face into a gentle grasp. "Now who needs to relax? I've got you," he assured his friend. "We're doing this together - I haven't ever been with a man, Sherlock, and there are some significant differences here. But I'm not going anywhere - if all we have is kissing, that's fine. That's more than fine. I'm here for
John nodded, "True." Mary went back to her desk. She had only a week left to work her notice and John would miss the ease of their routine during his surgeries. He didn't expect his next receptionist would be so willing to handle Sherlock.
"Yes," Sherlock said, nudging John's foot with his own. "Or, you know, it is sensible in this cold weather to conserve body heat by sharing a small space."
"So," he murmured, as they ate ice cream during the interval. Sherlock had insisted on going off to buy some from the foyer. "Who is it, one of the actors? A stagehand?"
John nodded, certain that was never going to happen, but really wanting to appease the man and have Sherlock to himself again.
"I know," Sherlock said, squeezing John's fingers a little, reminding him that they were in fact touching now - was it an invitation to go further? But he was still unsure. Alcohol plus first times, Sherlock's first time - God no, this was huge, serious stuff.
John blinked at him, not sure he had heard that right. "Closer, yeah," he said, wide-eyed. "Closer is good. You mean more cases together, letting me know there's trouble before it happens, that kind of thing?" he rambled on.
It was an enjoyable first half, a story John had enjoyed ever since his first read years ago, a go to book when he couldn't sleep. Come to think of it, it was quite the coincidence that Sherlock had a case involving this theatre, this particular play.
Sherlock ruffled his newspaper and looked at John across the top before putting it down in front of him. "Yes, of course, is there anyone else here?" he asked.
Sherlock let out a sigh and John didn't dare to move in case he spoiled the moment, but his hand slowly slipped from his friend's shoulder when Sherlock didn't respond further.
After a few more minutes John had to check. He got up and edged slowly around the room, pretending to be searching for a book on the shelf, then switching off the television before adjusting the blanket over the back of his chair and turning to peer into the kitchen. "Oh, God."
The sharp voice in John's ear didn't exactly disagree, and as with each stilted call they had together, John couldn't find it in himself to be too bothered by that.
The colour was amazing on him - John had known it would be. But the fear of the gift itself was enough for him to have questioned the whole thing all day. Seeing Sherlock wearing it now was good. It was all ok. Did he have to be so naked underneath? Probably not, but John really couldn't complain.
"Well it doesn't seem to be a worry for me this morning," John told him. He wanted to move, to get closer to Sherlock, like last night, but he was rooted to his chair and he could only watch as his friend suddenly stood up, clutched the sheet, despite their conversation, and came across the room to stand beside John.
Sherlock nodded and then picked up his cutlery and waited for John to do the same. They ate in silence for a while, John's heart was racing a little and the kitchen was really rather warm, he tugged at his shirt collar and cleared his throat.
John felt a small smile turn his lips up. He relaxed a little for the first time since this morning. "It looks good."
Sherlock thanked him and John gave a light press to the small of his back, urging him inside. They took their seats in the window and Sherlock tried to remind himself how to act, what to do first, as they sat together, neither mentioning the candle that Angelo lit for them and John simply gazing across at Sherlock as he rested his elbows on the little table.
John just smiled. Of course. Well, at least there didn't seem to be any lingering uneasiness about last night, maybe they were already passed it? John pushed down the twinge of hurt as he closed the fridge door. He should, theoretically, feel better, having got the burden of feelings off his chest. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to have worked like that for him.
He looked up to get a good view of Sherlock's face before redoubling his efforts and sucking in him again, squeezing his hips enough to leave finger marks, he knew. Sherlock cried out an almost defeated sound, chest and shoulders raised up as he came in hot spurts over John's tongue. John was so ecstatic that he couldn't even manage to swallow all at once, he had to pull off to catch his breath, his hand finishing the work as Sherlock's orgasm went on.
"Would you come here," John finally said, and he pulled Sherlock into a hug, so grateful for the warmth and strength when Sherlock's arms surrounded him. "Whatever you want," he whispered against Sherlock's cheek. "I'll be here."
John rushed into the kitchen to see what was so urgent, expecting flames at the very least. "What is it?"
"I really want to kiss you," John murmured, before he could stop himself. "I just wanted you to know, but I don't want to rush you," he rambled on. "I'll wait for howev-"
When he got home later there was a blank cheque sitting on the little table by his chair in the living room, a bottle of bleach holding it in place. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen. John smiled and took the bottle back into the remarkably clean kitchen, returning the cheque to Sherlock's desk drawer before he made himself some tea. Sherlock was too generous and John wouldn't take his money. Not so that his sister could avoid her problems.
Sherlock stopped at the bathroom door and turned back to John. "I'll just be a moment," and John, suddenly flustered, remembered his clothes were all upstairs.
John breathed in heavily through his nose, managed to look at Sherlock, met his eyes for the first time since he'd come into the room. "No, no it's not, it's not ok, don't let me get away with this."
John was late to work the next morning, making a fresh pot of tea to help Sherlock through the first couple of hours of the day, and popping in to ask Mrs Hudson if she could please make sure Sherlock didn't run out of tea before John got home with a new kettle.
"This is on me, this is all on me - I was upset with you because of the drugs, I was hurting because of what happened - I should
And the worst part of that was that he didn't mind it. His new obsession was John. The only worry he had was that one of them would decide that it wasn't going to last.
He got butterflies every time he thought about the changes they'd made. He found himself smiling, warming, more than he should while anywhere but his bedroom, during his lunch break. Just thinking about Sherlock, kissing him, lying beside him in bed, being together in the same room and wanting to kiss him all the time - more than that though, knowing that Sherlock wanted him too... it was almost too much to comprehend.
"Sorry, I- I didn't want to pressurise you. With... y'know..." He reached apologetically under the sheet, palming himself for a moment and hoping that explanation was enough. The warmth in his cheeks was annoying.
Sherlock slipped his arms around John's waist and pulled him closer. After another moment he grunted a little and tugged at John. "Closer," he said, slightly demanding but that was all good as far as John was concerned. Whatever Sherlock needed he could have it.
He was only able to look for a moment though before Sherlock shoved him backwards and moved in on him. John's back pressed against the edge of his chair as he whispered, "Fuck."
John nearly choked, couldn't take breaths deep enough because his heart was pounding so hard. "Sherlock..." he whispered, "I can't-" He put his fingers to the bridge of his nose, squeezing hard as he drew in what air he could and held it, before letting it out in a rush. "Yes, of course I do, you idiot," he said brokenly.
But he needed to be sure. He pulled back, seeking confirmation first in Sherlock's eyes, and then waiting for the words before he would move again.
"Death by blowjob?" John said. "Shall I write this up? I think we have a good title there," he guffawed.
"I am not," John said, but confusion flooded him. Had he been drinking a bit more these past few days? His bank balance was certainly feeling it, he had noticed that.
Sherlock considered his next words carefully. Now wasn't the time to let slip the reality of the situation to everyone in their acquaintance. He would need to discuss further with John. Especially after this morning's phone call from Mycroft. Sherlock had yet to be able to yell at his brother about that, he had the strong suspicion that Mycroft was blocking his calls. He had sent a lengthy text on the subject though.
Sherlock's hand was on his, clasping long fingers around his own and John was shaking, uncontrollably. He couldn't stop the chill running through his heart despite the marvellous sensation of Sherlock's skin on his.
"John, this isn't anything to do with him. I wanted to do something for you, to say thank you for your friendship."
He fell into Sherlock's arms, stomachs slippery with cum, heaving breaths in as if there wasn't enough air.
Sherlock looked into his eyes, fingers digging into John's hips, not allowing him to move away. "Yes," he said again, nodding intently. "Please, John."
"Get up, I'm gonna put you two in a taxi," Greg continued, completely unabashed by the state of John and Sherlock. "I managed to square things with the desk sergeant. What a couple of lightweights - you couldn't even make it to closing time!"
"What?" Sherlock looked up at him. "Oh, nothing, no, I -" He stopped and shook his head in a display of confusion that John had rarely seen from his friend. "I thought you were enjoying our evenings out together," he finally said.
John turned back, ushering Sherlock onwards, but he stopped as well. "Ah, Mrs Hudson, sorry, yeah, bit of a late one, we're both feeling a bit-" he stifled a fake yawn and gestured over his shoulder. "Better get upstairs."
John tried hard over the next few days to reach for tea and not alcohol. To not over-think what he wanted to ask Sherlock, because taking it slow was actually the best thing they could do, he knew that. Kissing Sherlock was more than he had ever imagined possible and he would smile just thinking about the next time he'd be able to touch him. The rest... well, there was no rush.
"I should have thought more about it. I wasn't thinking clearly, I wasn't even sure why I was asking and I ended up sounding like I was prying and... well, what I've always wanted to tell you... was that, I've never met anyone like you before, and it wouldn't matter who you were, man or woman - you fascinate me. I've never felt that way about anyone else." He got up suddenly, feeling too close, not wanting to make Sherlock any more uncomfortable than, if his face was anything to go by, John's words already had.
Sherlock tilted his head, looking slightly confused but not concerned. "Good, so am I," he said, leaning in for another kiss.
"Not at all. Although, better that it happened at home and not in the restaurant. Perhaps I'll wear something less... enticing next time," he added.
John cracked his eyes open as the cell door slammed into the wall, shielded his eyes from the brightest lights he'd ever known and looked up to see Lestrade's hulking form in the doorway. "Greg, is that Greg?" John asked.
Sherlock shook his head and pulled his robe a little tighter around his shoulders. When he spoke, John had to lean in to hear him better. "That I won't be what you want, not in the end."
When he could think again he realised Sherlock's cock was nudging against the back of his hand and nothing was going to stop him from taking Sherlock up on his offer of
The whole conversation rushed through John's head again and he heard the words as if Sherlock was there with them. "He was honest." His voice wasn't shaking, not at all. "More coherent than I could ever be, said we already have all that he can give. And the worst of it is, I knew that already. There was no need to tell him, to spoil this." His words had grown angry as he got frustrated and he shook his head, apologised.
"At this point I think normal has gone out of the window, don't you?" John murmured, steady breathing slowly resuming.
He put a gentle hand against Sherlock's chest, easing him back whilst still clutching him with the other hand. "I need to catch my breath," he said with a chuckle.
"Well, I've been out of sorts lately. Too much on my mind, distracting me from work." He didn't sound his normal irritated self about that either.
"No, John, it is not possible to make tea until we replace the kettle." He brandished it at John. It rattled.
"Where were we?" Sherlock said and he stalked towards John and John could feel a definite change in the wind as he was tackled onto the sofa.
John rocked back onto his heels, taking a deep breath. "I won't," he lied. "Better get these made," he added, turning back to his sandwiches. "Did you want one?"
"Sherlock," he said, pushing down his desires for now. He could easily do that, he was well-practiced. "I don't want you to do this tonight." Sherlock's face fell and John's heart dropped at the thought of causing him any pain. But he had to be sensible. "We have to wait, what if it's just the drink? I can't do that to you."
"Really. That's charming, John," Sherlock told him and he turned to continue along to his bedroom, leaving John by the stairs. "I'll be having a wank," he said over his shoulder.
"It's not you, it's me," John said flatly. "Really? Already? You've only made me dinner once, is it really all that bad?" He was mocking himself, their situation, because what else could he do?
He didn't need a drink to do this - with a bit of practice they could enjoy this without any level of panic. He was just so determined not to mess it up. He needed to relax, stop berating himself, stop worrying about the future - just enjoy each moment.
He was impatient now for the evening to start, for the walking to the restaurant, the watching John over the table, the ridiculous warmth and nervous tingling he experienced whenever he was close to John - and whenever John looked at him with
John kept his arm tightly curled around Sherlock's body - he wasn't backing away from this. If Sherlock could do it then so could he. "You want to talk about sex?" he said slowly.
He didn't have time to mention any of this to John though before he was unceremoniously shoved into the doorway behind him, pedestrians be damned, and John lunged into another kiss. A deep kiss, he was tasting that wine on John's tongue. John's hands were clutching his arse as he insinuated himself ever closer to Sherlock's body. Sherlock's hands went to John's hips, holding on tightly as the kiss continued.
John just shook his head, and thanked the stars above for his ridiculous life, as he followed behind.
"I know you are," Sherlock said gently. "I know John." He eased off the chair so he was sitting on the floor beside John, a little uncomfortably if his face was anything to go by. "I want you to forgive yourself."
They were naked. Naked under the warm spray of the water and John had no way of concealing his arousal. But he didn't want to, he wanted Sherlock to know, to see how turned on he was, just from kissing him.
Sherlock shifted and began sliding his hand beneath John's neck. John lifted up a little to allow the very welcome move. Once his arm was underneath, Sherlock tugged gently and brought John closer. John's skin felt too hot as he rose onto an elbow, shuffled in and looked down at Sherlock longingly.
Graham seemed to snap out of it at the same time as Sherlock. "Ok, well, will you let me know how it goes? I'm happy for you Sherlock," he said, and his hand slapped against Sherlock's arm in a most unusual manner.
"Oh, John," Mrs Hudson said softly, and John felt her hand cover his on the table top. "What did he say?"
Sherlock was up to his elbows in something in the kitchen sink when John returned home with shopping bags. He had made sure to stay out a little longer than usual, despite knowing that things would never go back to normal if he avoided the flat, but he just wasn't ready to go home.
But Sherlock was suddenly rambling, "I don't know if I can - I don't know, John... What if I can't and there's nothing between us? I don't want you to be frustrated... what if-"
"Ah," Sherlock said, nodding his understanding. "That's ok, you don't need to hide anything from me, John."
"I think I'm to blame," Sherlock went on. "I think you've been struggling this whole time and I've been selfish - I drew it out by over thinking and you've withdrawn a part of yourself. I've made you even more dependent on alcohol because of what we've started here."
Always articulate, always honest. Yes, of course. Why had John thought this would be difficult? It was Sherlock. And the crushed feeling that he was now experiencing was less devastating because he knew they were all they could be. They already had the relationship that no one else had ever managed with Sherlock.
Embarrassingly fast in the end, actually, but as always with Sherlock he felt it through his entire body. He used his cum to slick the way to Sherlock's orgasm, even as his own continued - holding Sherlock down by one shoulder as he worked his fist over Sherlock's erection, until Sherlock's head was thrown back again. He didn't seem too concerned that John hadn't managed to continue their experiment, when he came across John's knuckles with a loud cry of pleasure.
"I've got you," John said, running a hand slowly down Sherlock's back, marvelling at how smooth and soft his skin was, that he was able to touch now, to revel in the feel of their bodies pressed together. When he had let himself dream of these things, it had never felt like this - he couldn't have imagined how good it would be.
"No," John said, feeling a little sick at the directness again, as well as Sherlock's concern. "No, it was perfect. What we said - I thought about it all night," he admitted.
They were quiet for a while and John explicitly took notice of every shop window and squinted at each crack in the pavement to avoid thinking too much on how much touching was occurring tonight. His shoulder had brushed against Sherlock's as they collected their coats in the restaurant. And he was fairly certain he had nudged a foot under the small table as they ate their starter. After that he had kept his feet firmly under his chair. And now it was dark and he could just about pretend that they were merely walking close beside each other and that Sherlock's warm, coat-covered arm was not pressed against his.
"I woke up with my cock in my hand, wishing it was your hand," John told him shakily, heart racing, palms beginning to sweat with the admission, but he kept his eyes fixed on Sherlock's, determined not to let this go.
There was a lot of tossing and turning, a lot of huffing and throwing back covers. John already knew every tiny crack and bump in the painted ceiling above his bed and he traced each one with his eyes until his eyelids were too heavy to manage it anymore. Visions of Sherlock's sleepy, drunken face, mixed with the hopeless desire to touch himself and get some relief. His hand was loosely on his cock but he refused to give in.
Sherlock groaned into his mouth as John's hand sped up, his hips giving stuttering thrusts into John's fist.
Sherlock's head rested on the back of his chair and John took a deep breath and put his knee to the carpet, balancing himself.
. Now John was forced to think of his past - failed - relationships, in which he had ended up having little to nothing in common with any of them, after the initial physical side of the relationship inevitably lessened. "Um," he said again. "Sex."
Sherlock noticed John's slightly dubious look when Angelo said this, and he pulled out a couple of notes and shoved them discreetly into Angelo's hand as they shook. The man had a business to run and Sherlock wasn't one to run up debts. "Everything was wonderful, Angelo, John's just feeling a little, um... unusual."
He didn't plan on talking any more tonight, but Mrs Hudson had that way of cornering him so easily and somehow he ended up being drawn back from the front door and was soon sitting at her kitchen table, plate of biscuits between them, as she sat with her chin in one hand and looked at him sadly.
John grumbled and groaned and leaned against the wall beside the bed to help him slide more easily to the floor.
Sherlock jumped up. "I'll get it," he said, and quickly filled a glass and passed it to him before reaching for a jug and filling it as well, placing it on the table beside John. "Did I forget anything else?" he asked.
"John, I want to say something, and I feel that I'm the best person to say this, because we spend so much time together. I'm not being fair to you by allowing you to drink so much."
Sherlock took a few steps over to the bed and pulled back the covers, not taking his eyes from John as he did so.
"Gentlemen," Angelo said, arms wide as he greeted them. "What a great pleasure it is to see you here again. I held your usual table, if you'd like to come over?"
"Will you please have a seat?" Sherlock said, directing John into the living room where John could see orange juice and a coffee pot already set out next to the newspapers.
John swallowed. "I wanted-" he had to clear his throat. "Wanted to say thanks," he finished pitifully.
"Mmm?" Sherlock said, from where he was sprawled on the sofa, bare feet planted on the soft leather, head tilted towards John but not really appearing to see him. Sherlock hadn't been focusing on much lately and John knew he needed to find a decent case soon, although he was working, so John couldn't really see what the problem was.
"Yeah, in here, Sherlock," he answered, standing up as Sherlock came into the room. He was clutching at his right shoulder and looking pained. "What happened?" he said, moving to take hold of Sherlock's good arm and help him on to the sofa.
Then there was just one word - "Bed?" - and they both nodded and edged off the sofa, turning off lights before wandering towards the hall. Towards Sherlock's bedroom.
His hand drifted into his pants and he closed his eyes, wrapping around his hardening cock and letting his fingers curl around the head. He squeezed a little and let out a breath he'd been holding since he woke up. After a couple of lazy strokes he opened his eyes again and sighed loudly. Damn. He didn't want to be doing this. Not right now, just because it was fucking convenient. He wanted last night back, wanted to change what had happened, or rather what hadn't happened - they should have sobered up, talked about it. Maybe they could have worked something out and not just gone their separate ways until now Sherlock was probably completely over it. Probably went straight to sleep last night and John had missed any opportunity there might have been.
Greg pursed his lips together. "Hmm," he said. "I won't bother repeating to you what I've already told Sherlock here. But you two aren't teenagers, John, you should maybe remind each other of that now and again."
John hardly dared move in case he broke the invisible bubble of perfection that was the two of them standing under the shower, covered in spunk.
, this was why he kept it inside. Because if Sherlock was who John feared, was immune to the emotions of others, deliberately kept himself separate from attachment to anyone, then John didn't know if he could live with that - with the burning desires he had, the dreadful need for the reciprocation of his feelings... well, even the acknowledgement of his feelings. John didn't know how to even begin to deal with any of this.
John looked over at him, arms folded across his chest, too relaxed but beginning to think he shouldn't be. "Is that right?" he said softly, smiling. "Are you suggesting we should share a small space tonight?"
"Well, good morning again to you two," their landlady said, as she stood with one hand on a hip the other somewhere near her forehead, eyes wide and mischievous. "I was bringing your breakfast up and, well, I only
John didn't reply. He'd read them eventually, but the last thing he needed at the moment was a reminder from his sister as to how difficult it was for his family to maintain contact with each other, without an ulterior motive. He didn't want to know any more about his sister's new woman, or how much money she needed, and he didn't want to answer questions about Sherlock. About John and Sherlock. Harry had always made assumptions about John, and up until very recently he had been able to tell her she was wrong, out of order - stop pushing it. Maybe that was why he couldn't bring himself to have the talk with her now. She would see through him immediately and know that she had been right all along. He wasn't ready to apologise when she should be the one apologising to him for using him all these years.
"In your case certainly," John said with a wink. "I haven't forgotten it was you that got us arrested last night. Lightweight is right," he added thinking back to Greg's reprimand. "You do have a really low tolerance."
"Um, yes, ok." John stepped back a little before changing his mind. "Are you sure, though?" he asked, eyeing the jar on the counter closest to where Sherlock was, in fact, chopping carrots. John could imagine that those circular things inside were pickled onions, but he knew better. "Did you want me to clear up at all? Or..."
Sherlock freed a hand from under the sheet and reached out to run his fingers along John's arm, shoulder to elbow - leaving goosebumps, raising John's pulse - trailing along his forearm to where John's hand rested on the pillow. Sherlock's fingers closed around his and John jerked a little at the tickle on his palm, at the unexpected touch.
"Nothing I haven't done before. There was less sodium this time, maybe that's where I went wrong..." Sherlock mused as they wandered.
"Look, give me a week, I'll see what I can do." They said goodbye and John slid his thumb across the screen to end the call just as he looked up to see Sherlock standing in the open doorway to the kitchen. He looked concerned about something. "Oh, hi, everything ok?" John asked, as he stood up, slipping his phone into his back pocket.
"What are you thinking about?" John asked, dubiously, knowing that kind of questioning would usually get him nowhere.
"I want you to move back here," Sherlock said, and that was something John never thought he would hear.
John immediately realised he'd messed up when he saw the curtains closed and a pair of black tailored trousers hanging off the end of the bed. "Oh, God," he murmured, as he looked to his left and saw a sleep dishevelled and beautifully tousled Sherlock looking back at him from the bed. "What time is it?" Sherlock asked, hoarsely.
He pulled Sherlock to him with his free hand and kissed him again, delving straight in, licking and sucking on Sherlock's tongue, groaning into his mouth when Sherlock pressed his hand against his cock.
Sherlock looked over from where he was obviously attempting to get comfortable on the thin mattress. "How is this my fault?" he asked.
They settled into a corner table, Angelo brought out his candles but Sherlock stopped him. "Not necessary, thank you," he said. As an aside to John, he added, "I don't want to make you uncomfortable, John."
That was his fault entirely as well, of course. Since when did he have a problem with alcohol? He'd messed around plenty of times when both parties had been drunk. But this was Sherlock, and there was no way John was letting him do anything he could easily regret.
Sherlock was shaking his head before John could finish that thought. "John, wait, before you say anything else." He got to his feet but after a step forward he stopped, hands flopping at his sides as John backed up for his own protection. "You are my doctor, and equally you know I usually appreciate your capabilities on our cases." He gave a small smirk, before his face became serious once more. "But most importantly, you once told me that I'm your friend. Friends, John. That's the most... intense relationship I've ever had. I didn't know I was capable of maintaining a friendship. I have no idea how to think about doing anything else."
"Sherlock, I want to talk... to you," John nodded, as if confirming this to himself as well as to Sherlock, who was watching from his chair. "Yes," he added, and planted his feet, hands on hips. He waited for a moment, Sherlock didn't speak, didn't appear to understand why John wasn't speaking. "Ah- right."
With a giving-up sigh, John waved Sherlock into the living room. "Go and sit down, I'll make the tea."
Sherlock looked down and leaned back a little, his lower half edged forwards and he bumped into John's erection. His eyes widened and John felt his cheeks heat. But Sherlock said, "Ah, I see what you mean," and took hold of John's hand.
"John, you two have a special relationship. I've always seen it," Mrs Hudson said, and John raised his head to look at her again. "They way he looks at you, he'll never look at a single being in that way," she said decisively.
"Anytime you want to," John assured him. He couldn't take his eyes from Sherlock's lips. He cleared his throat, eased himself off Sherlock's body and slumped down beside him, attempting to distract himself, but by the look on Sherlock's face now he had achieved nothing more than upsetting his friend with the lack of contact.
Over his anger now, since the last time they talked about his sister, John asked, "What do you think? Should I give her another chance?"
"Beautiful," John said, and Sherlock may only have flushed cheeks because of the early hour and the closeness of their two bodies in the warm bed, or it might be because John made him feel the same way Sherlock did to him.
Sherlock reached behind him and started to rub John down with showergel, John stood a little shell-shocked still, and allowed Sherlock to wash him. He paid special attention to John's stomach, adding a little more gel to his hands and then giving John a serious look. "Is there anywhere you want to wash yourself?" he asked.
Sherlock put down his tea, as John wiped his eyes so at least he could see more clearly. He moved to the edge of his chair and John felt a hand on his shoulder.
Sherlock cried out as John squeezed the heads of their cocks together, and as soon as he saw the first spurt of cum from Sherlock's swollen head, there was nothing to hold back his own climax. He came with a roar, desperate to see Sherlock's face through it all, blinking through the spray of the water, gasping for each breath as he pulled on their cocks, swearing when he could manage it, shaking and crumbling as it subsided.
He found that he couldn't quite place the time when that had happened. Somewhere between John confessing his own feelings that fateful night downstairs, and him beginning to open up to Sherlock, and discuss his past relationships. Sherlock wanted him anyway, despite any of his past. His past made John who he was today. But he had needed to know that John wouldn't treat Sherlock as just a date.
Sherlock frowned for a second, then both eyes opened and he smiled up at John, his face now serene and beautiful. He nodded and then a chuckle rose, jolting John sitting so close to him, "I'm ok," Sherlock got out. "John, that was fantastic," he said through his laughter. "Where the hell did an army doctor learn how to do that?"
He sighed out loud, threw back his duvet and thought that at least Sherlock would be fully dressed when he saw him again. Hopefully.
He would if he could get a word in, if he could find one amongst the adjectives flying around his head, forcing him to do this, to bring out these feelings- "Damn it!" he said sharply. "I can't live like this, Sherlock." He clambered to his feet. "Where were you? I can't... how can I relax if you're off
John huffed out a chuckle. That was better. Humour was better. Although he did not feel much like laughing. He tried to stop himself, knew it was pointless to talk about it, to admit anything to his friend - because that's
"It's for me," John muttered, as he made his way to the kitchen. He swiftly poured out a generous measure of whiskey, dropped a couple of ice cubes in from the freezer tray and grabbed the frozen peas while he was there. He gulped some of the alcohol as he wandered back to where Sherlock was sitting, waiting. He pressed the peas to Sherlock's shoulder and just about waited until Sherlock moved a hand to hold it in place before flopping down beside him and taking another deep swig of his drink. It burned pleasantly on the way down and he groaned softly.
John resisted the urge to grab Sherlock's hand and shove it into his pants. Completely inappropriate. He would never do that to his friend.
"Fine with me," John assured him softly. "Stay as close as you need." He shivered as Sherlock ran a hand down his arm and took the towel from him. "Oh, yeah, that's... ah..." he trailed off as Sherlock hung it beside his own before reaching for John's hand. "Ok," he said needlessly. That answered his naked concerns anyway. Sherlock led them both from the bathroom and into his room, any thought of tea apparently forgotten. "I don't actually have any clothes down here," John said.
Finally, John rested on his palm by Sherlock's hip, wiping his mouth with the back of his other hand. He looked down into Sherlock's face, he had his eyes closed now, head on the floor, hands spread out at his sides. John smiled, stroked gentle fingertips down Sherlock's chest and murmured, "Hey."
"Sherlock, no, honestly, that's not what I meant," John started to explain, lowering his voice, a hand on Sherlock's wrist to stop him dashing off, glancing around them to ensure they weren't making a scene, but then not caring about that and ploughing on. "I was glad you came tonight, I
"I like to be clean," John said, trying to avoid spitting toothpaste at the mirror as he looked up at Sherlock's reflection. "How long does it take you?" Sherlock always looked pristine. He must have a stock of products he kept in his bedroom, because there wasn't much of his in the bathroom cabinet.
"Sherlock," John's voice came from behind him and Sherlock spun around. He smiled as John walked over casually, reached out and put a hand on his arm in greeting. Sherlock wished he would do more but he supposed that out here on the street maybe wasn't the place.
"Fuck me, Sherlock, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I don't know how to apologise enough for what I did to you, I didn't come here to beg for forgiveness because I don't know how you're dealing with what I did, and I don't want to set you back or make you feel worse, I just..." Another swipe across his eyes. "I'm sorry. I was so-
Sherlock didn't leave his mind as John prepared for bed, when he lay down, his hand rubbing over his cock as he closed his eyes. Sherlock was right there while he stroked himself through his underwear, watching John, just watching while John's hand went inside his pants, his fingers gripping in just the right place to get himself off as fast as possible.
Sherlock nodded, holding his towel in front of him in much the same way as John was, covering what they had both revealed already. There was really nothing much to leave to the imagination and so surely they didn't need to be this modest.
John narrowed his eyes. "You know, there's nothing stopping you from buying your own damn bread once in a while."
He decided on a new dressing gown since that was still Sherlock's preferred indoor wear. He spent a long time hunting down the perfect one online, before deciding he had to see it in person, so he set out to the shop after surgery the next day. It was perfect, soft, flowing dark purple silk, John almost wanted to try it on, but he was fairly certain of how ridiculous he would look.
And then Sherlock surprised him again by taking his hand, running it down between their bodies and pressing it to his crotch. To the obvious erection in his pants.
Maybe John really was just that obvious in his desire for his friend. Everyone had assumed they were together from the start, they must have seen something there even before John had admitted it to himself.
John couldn't resist. He wasn't trying to start anything they weren't ready for, but kissing Sherlock Holmes had become his favourite thing. He grazed his lips from the corner of Sherlock's mouth to his smooth cheek, before lightly kissing his lips again.
"Because when you said 'adventure', I wasn't sure if you meant being out on the streets, actually tackling real life... or this, playing Monopoly."
John was still feeling like a twat when Sherlock came into the living room. He was wearing pants. Blue, tight, leave-nothing-to-John's-vivid-imagination, pants. Flowing around his lithe frame was the new dressing gown.
Sherlock scowled. "Well, yes," he agreed. "Sorry, it smelled fresh and warm and... I put it on without thinking."
"You must see a fair bit of each other, working and living together? I'm not sure I would manage it."
"Woah there," John slurred, steadying his friend with an unsteady hand. Il Baretto had been a good, impromptu choice after finishing up at Scotland Yard, even if John had felt a little underdressed next to Sherlock in his ever-present suit. He was just glad that Sherlock wanted to involve him in his work still. His job was important to him, but being close to Sherlock mattered more, and a good case had the added benefit of taking his mind off other things.
Sherlock had reached down and was pulling open the jeans - dark blue and so tight and so wonderful over his hip bones,
His busy morning was made worse by several missed calls from Harry. He couldn't respond so he had to keep her in the back of his mind all day and hope that she had received the cash the other week and was just calling to say thanks.
John considered for a moment, gently moving his fingers under Sherlock's hand, over hard flesh covered only in a thin layer of fabric. "Are you wearing pants?" he asked.
Charing Cross at... 1am? Bloody hell. Bloody Sherlock. And now John was wide awake again, needed to clean up before he could go chasing after his never-still-for-a-minute partner.
John didn't hesitate again, he kissed Sherlock sloppily before launching straight onto his cock, sucking him through tight lips and trying for as much in his mouth as he could. He heard Sherlock cry out, gripped his hips as he eased back a bit, breathing heavily through his nose as he curled his tongue around Sherlock's cock head, licking over the ridges of soft skin, before taking him back in, further this time, cheeks sucking in around the thick shaft. It would probably be obvious to Sherlock that John had done this before, but he didn't care. They could talk later, this was happening now, and John had Sherlock writhing under his hands as he bobbed up and down on his cock.
"I think about you, every night, I can't close my eyes, I just see you lying there-" he was sobbing now, chest rising and falling in staccato bursts as the tears rolled freely.
He sat down on his armchair and opened the book, preparing to read a chapter or two before getting back into Sherlock’s mess. A slip of half-folded paper fluttered out as he opened it, landing on the floor. Intrigued, John leaned down and grasped it with two of his fingers, pulling it back up and unfolding the mysterious note.
He got up and started going through the notes and pictures and articles around his chair. There seemed to be three distinct topics to the material, three different people, and John organized each piece of information in separate stacks on the desk. He worked like this for what seemed to be an eternity, gradually moving deeper into the room, shuffling through everything and placing it in its rightful place in the stacks.
He hadn’t the slightest clue why Sherlock would own such a book, but since all the other books Sherlock owned consisted of gory and sometimes sickening topics, this title appeared very ordinary. And John was all for ordinary.
By the time he was halfway through, John decided to take a break. He spotted a leather-bound book on Sherlock’s desk, titled
John stared at the line for a few seconds while his brain refused to function. He read it again and again before confirming each and every word, making sure the writing style didn’t deceive the eye.
John heard the flat door opening and put the list back into the book, slamming it shut in a panic-attack. He rushed over to Sherlock’s desk and dropped it where it lay before, jumping back into his seat as the sound of Sherlock’s footsteps on the stairs grew nearer and nearer, until finally the door to the room opened and he stepped in.
Checked off - Because what would be a birthday party without music? John didn’t ponder much about this one. Neither he nor Sherlock liked obnoxious pop-songs, so Sherlock choosing instrumental music wasn’t anything surprising.
“Did - did you read it?” Sherlock asked, abandoning his usual calm demeanor to stammer out the words.
Sherlock was planning a date! John’s mind blanked out a second time, trying to comprehend all these new emotions flooding his thoughts. Sherlock had…
was. The flatmates never have cake except for birthdays, and here it is on a list, checked off, right before the day of his birthday. John chuckled to himself, at first wondering how Sherlock even knew about the exact date, then coming to the conclusion that he must’ve looked at his birth-certificate.
The word felt strange in his head, tumbling around along with Sherlock’s face. John hadn’t even read the last item on the list yet.
Shepherd's pie! John remembered telling Sherlock how much he loved the food, way back when they first met and were getting to know each other. Sherlock hadn’t forgotten!
For it was indeed John Watson’s birthday the following day, and although he wasn’t expecting any company to come over, it would still be nice to spend the day in a neater flat.
The room was empty, save the papers strewn across the entire room. Some were crumpled, some pictures were hung on the wall, but most of the paper was in piles, wherever the furniture didn’t take up space. It was like living in a paper house these days. John glanced into the kitchen, where the familiar de-facto laboratory had been expanded, dominating the counters and tiles as well. Still no sign of Sherlock. Must have ran off on another case somewhere.
Sherlock walked took two steps closer to where John was now standing, a confused expression on his face. A second passed where the two held each other’s gazes, before John grasped Sherlock by his collar and pulled him in.
Sherlock stood there as still as a statue, returning John’s stare with an mixture of embarrassment and panic. And something else too. John heart skipped a beat when he realized what that ‘something else’ was. Embarrassment, panic, and just a little bit of love.
Sherlock appeared to have written a list. John could never mistake the scribbly writing style for anybody else’s. It was numbered, with a small box beside each entry. A to-do list. Again, this was one of those things Sherlock never did. Like planning, in which he went to his mind-palace, keeping track of of what has and what hasn’t been done was exactly the same. So either Sherlock’s mind-palace wasn’t working, which was unheard of, or this was something to big to contain in such an abstract place. The latter was more likely, and John felt a rush of excitement in his chest, for he was about to read something that might even-out the balance of knowledge between himself and Sherlock. John Watson wouldn’t be kept in the dark for much longer!
«Please, back off and let him be.» he's undoing his buttons, leaving his umbrella to lean on the door frame. Mrs Hudson behind him is nibbling at he nails, worry taking over her.
» he's whispering in Mycroft's ear, the man head forced back on Sherlock's shoulder by a strong hold on his hair.
«Aren't you hungry, John?» he doesn't look at him, he traced a safety line for his eyes, just about above John's lips so that he can see his reactions without having to deal with John's gaze.
Sternum cracking and ribcage crumpling up in a ball of bones and meat and blood. His heart is crushing and pounding against the bleeding collapse of his body.
That time he couldn't decode the look in John's eyes, but he didn't question further. He can see it now, burning low like extinguished ashes in a fireplace, while the doctor's fingers examine his face and wounds, his bloodshot eyes and hands.
Mycroft's cuffs are up to his elbows, hands are cautiously reacing for Sherlock's. «Sherlock, it's fine. It's me.»
The doctor lets out a low chuckle, the annoyed one. What's going on? Is he angry? No, his hands are not balled up, they are resting in front of him, just before the full plate, pressed together.
Why would he wait up? He never does. Does he? Sure, it happened that Sherlock stayed up late composing silently or going through the mailbox looking for something interesting and that John returned home just before Sherlock decided to go get some sleep. But it's not like he waited for John to go to sleep. Did he?
«John, I don't really want to give you the treatment i dearly reserve for my brother,» grey eyes are burying themselves in John's dark ones but not quite staring as if Sherlock is looking through him and not
His hands are not the only ones that are shaking. And John's steps are not as steady as he thought they would be. John doesn't smell the same, he doesn't even talk the same way as he did before.
A loud bang, rushed words slipping under the door to nest in John's brain, laying eggs and maggots that will tear John's sleep to pieces for the next couple of years. «Shit!»
Heart beating fast in his throat, heart clenching tightly in his chest, John runs fast to Sherlock's door, slamming the door open. «Sherlock, what's going on?!» breath short, trembling hands. Adrenaline is flowing angrily in his veins.
John remembers the war. It's been years, but he remembers. If he tries- not even hard- he can hear the bombshell exploding, shell shock causing him a ringing in his ears for months. He remembers how his hands would refuse to stop shaking even after five months of recovery, how his sleep is still not peaceful and the way his mattress in the hospital room was less comfortable than the hard ground he slept in in the trenches.
He saw the anger, the resentment, the hatred looks that made his nape tickle whenever he gave his back to the man.
Another fix, another fix. But he can't bring himself to a stop, he knows he's making sounds and he can't control them. He feels vibrations in his chest, violent shakes going through his body, his back hits the bedpost with every oscillation. Back and forth.
“Bit not good.” John gave him a small, forced smile over his shoulder. “And you realised it a bit late.”
Lestrade expected Mycroft Holmes to call for his secretary to serve him, but the mayor himself went over to a cabinet, opened it, took out a bottle and a glass and poured. He returned to Lestrade with the full glass in his hand and held it out to him.
But no sooner had the words left John's mouth than the slower thrusts were history, and John was fucking him again with hard, deep strokes.
"Happy New Year to you too, Mike." His appraising gaze wandered over Mike's non-existent waist. "Mike... I think you've actually lost some weight. That mini-break at that spa seems to have worked miracles. Or are mattress gymnastics with Susan the reason for the ... two pound loss?" he asked with a boyish wink.
"Oh, right - before I forget..." John spoke up again. "You have an appointment with my tailor tomorrow."
Sherlock stared blankly into the distance. “Might it be...” he muttered to himself before returning to the present with a jerk. “Pictures!” he demanded imperiously. “Are there any pictures of Moran?”
"And now the incident with the bomb..." Sherlock mused. "They can't all be coincidences. There must be a connection. Something they all have in common. If only we knew who sent Charlie..."
Mycroft closed his eyes. If he watched Greg pleasuring himself on him - with him - his self-control was going to be over and done with in no time flat.
John breathed out small, moist kisses against the uninjured corner of Sherlock's mouth and wrapped his fingers around Sherlock's stiff member. Sherlock gasped and his body stiffened, his muscles tensing.
John fixed Sherlock with a steely gaze for several minutes, his lips pressed firmly together. Not a word was said, not a sound was heard, until Sherlock began to feel rather uncomfortable and shifted around in his chair nervously. He'd finally found the straw that would break the camel's back. His heart beat harder in his chest, and his head felt cold and empty. What would John do now? Would he punish him? Would he box his ears again? Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut briefly to drive away the memory of that moment. But when John spoke, Sherlock opened them again so he could stare at him, his eyes wide with shock.
Sherlock’s smile deepened, grew darker, hotter and seductive. He sighed quietly, sounding content. “Always straight to the point. That’s my John.” The slender fingers loosened the belt on the bathrobe and the exquisite fabric slid down Sherlock’s body with a soft brushing sound, gathering at his feet like a white wave. Mere seconds ago John had wished for nothing else than seeing Sherlock… marvelling at his nudity... But now, strangely enough, it wasn’t important to him anymore. Just like the bathrobe had done a moment ago, John’s eyes were now sliding over pale skin, over two small rosy nipples, the slender legs, the fine line of hair that started just below his navel and ended above a beautiful half-hard erection.
Mike nodded his head thoughtfully. "You're not entirely wrong about one thing... Dimitri really does appear to be gathering troops again. Fresh blood... young fellows... ruthless... prone to violence."
(John's talk of marriage proposals had given him some rather stupid ideas). Instead, he concentrated on the rest of the information included in John's statement.
for both of them. And for that reason, Sherlock was almost positive that John would greet his disclosure positively. Of course, there was always a small risk... but... John had said he missed him... No. There was no risk at all.
"Ah..." Sherlock said to show he understood. "Then this is one of those things we won't mention with a word tomorrow and both act as if it never happened?"
Sherlock's expression lightened with sudden understanding before darkening again immediately. "You never intended to take my virginity that first night!" he complained.
"Hurt his feelings?" Mike retorted loudly. "Hurt his feelings?! The tosser didn't bat an eyelash. How do you know it
"Thank you, Miss Morstan," Greg replied with extreme nonchalance before entering Mycroft's sanctum sanctorum. "I hope you told her she can go home," he said sotto voce almost before he'd shut the door behind himself.
Mike patted him on the shoulder. "We've taken care of much bigger problems before. Are you coming down to the restaurant? I've heard things about the wild pheasant..."
John interrupted the start of Sherlock's orgasm three more times. Sherlock didn't say anything the entire time. Not a word, not a sigh, not a moan. He was apparently too far gone for anything like that. His gasping, stuttering breaths were the only sounds that came out of him. His whole body appeared to be taut, and at the same time utterly without strength.
"Good God, Sherlock!" Mycroft sounded completely outraged, which did cheer Sherlock up. "You're a Holmes, after all! Why would you wish to throw yourself away on this man with his perverted little games?"
"And I'm..." Mycroft glanced around suspiciously, but there was no one there aside from them. Still, he lowered his voice when he continued: "And I occupy a public position." He raised one eyebrow. "So?"
"Good day, Detective Inspector," Mycroft Holmes greeted him, gesturing toward one of the chairs designated for visitors across from his desk. "Please - have a seat."
." When he saw Sherlock's eyes light up with hope, he added a firm "later" to his statement. "We need to do some work now."
"Very good," Jacques replied, filled one of the cups with expert ease, added some milk, brought the cup to John and set it down on the low coffee table.
When the knock came on the door, John got up, brought in the richly laden tray, and set it down on the coffee table. First he poured a glass of water, placed it on the coffee table where Sherlock could reach it, and put the straw in it.
His ankles were likewise bound with leather cuffs, although these were attached to a spreader bar. The pulling and pricking in his scrotum came from a thick rubber covering – otherwise known as a parachute – that John had snapped into place around his testicles, surrounding them just like a little cloak. Three chains were attached to the parachute, and the rope, which John had tied to the chains, ensured that Sherlock's testicles were pulled back between his thighs. The rope itself ran up Sherlock's back and over his right shoulder so he could hold the knotted end between his teeth.
"I know by now that you prefer it big," John remarked, drawing the words out, and Sherlock's cheeks flushed with blood.
But as it was, the security measure remained undiscovered and John was able to take his time observing the building where Sebastian Moran lived.
Sherlock appeared to be quite relaxed, at ease, and worldly – but there was a slight nervous jitter around his eyes and in his fingers that John noticed, even though Sherlock's hands lay folded in his lap.
'. John gazed at the delicate paper rings in his hand for a while, lost in thought, until a diabolical grin stole across his lips.
Without even considering the fact that he was dressed only in pyjamas, t-shirt, and an open dressing gown, Sherlock stepped outside in his bare feet.
Charlie was dead, and with his dying breath he'd accused John of having arranged the murder of Albright's nephew. Everyone in the mob would believe it had been John's act of revenge... revenge for the disparaging comments and countless jabs Albright had let fall about him in public.
"No... I..." John contradicted him just as stubbornly. "Then... then hit me... fuck me... it... would only be fair - justice, if you will. I... I won't fight back."
Mrs Turner seemed satisfied by the answer and left him alone again... with the same big smile on her face. It wasn't until now that Sherlock realised he really was quite hungry. He sat down on one of the chairs and pulled the tray closer. He inspected the daisies with a slight sense of embarrassment as he ate. No one had ever given him flowers before... this was all rather confusing. He could deal with animosity... but this sudden flurry of friendliness... He had no idea how to react to it.
"I... I don't know," Sherlock stammered. His arousal had only increased during John's descriptions, and the physical manifestation thereof pressed very insistently against John's hip.
"Do you even listen to yourself?!" John roared at his friend, furious. "What kind of a harebrained idea was that? A passbook? Could you not think of anything more idiotic?"
"You could say that," John responded absently, staring at his stockinged feet. Then he suddenly jumped up again and started to pace back and forth in front of his desk. "The mayoral elections are causing a lot of headaches. No matter what it costs, we have to avoid the same thing happening as in the elections in Leicester last year. They've had nothing but trouble since. We need to make sure that
After leaving the car Mycroft had provided them with, they were now running through the terminal to the counter where their tickets were waiting for them. When John, who was completely out of breath, finally managed to catch up with Sherlock. He was already talking to a young woman, whose smile seemed somewhat forced at this time of night. After some discussion, they were given their tickets and took their place in the queue for security checks. Fortunately, there were very few people waiting in line and most of them appeared to be over-tired businessmen.
John nodded. "Maybe Mycroft Holmes could... I don't know... make her life difficult by cutting her budget somewhere."
Sherlock enjoyed every single stroke to the utmost. With every pass, John rubbed across his prostate in the most delicious way, stimulating it, winding him up to the most dizzying heights and not giving him a moment's rest.
Wet circles around the crown … the rustle of the heavy silk against his skin … the first drops … Sherlock's throaty groan … the perfect hardness between his legs, which he hadn't even noticed happening … then, finally … the warm, wet mouth … tight … sucking … the movement … up and down … up and down … nothing but mouth and tongue and lips … hands on his hips … gentle … gentle pressure … gentle pressure everywhere … gentle sucking … the red lips stretched around his erection … the taut, hollow cheeks … the eyes opening … the cloudy gaze … half-lidded eyes … fluttering … closing … gentle, so gentle … a moan … then the familiar pressure … the need for more...
Sherlock stopped where he was, baffled. He'd never experienced hunger in John's house - he'd always been given everything he could ever ask for, but never - not once - had anything
Sherlock stared up at John's face in disbelief, then kowtowed with a quiet sigh when he recognised a very familiar adamance despite the heat in the blue eyes. Obediently, he stuck his tongue out again and let it slide over the silky skin. Over and over again, he teased small patches of John's glans with the point of his tongue before circling the entire head once with his tongue in a single, wet motion. Just as Sherlock was about to focus on the tiny opening in order to perhaps get a small appetiser... John withdrew his erection as quickly as he had the cigar a short time ago. Sherlock was left with nothing but the satisfaction of hearing John's heavy breathing, which sounded as if he'd just finished running the London marathon.
A quick glance at the clock told Sherlock that lunchtime was long past. All the tidying and sorting had made him thirsty, though, and he looked pensively at the push button on the wall. He gnawed on his lower lip for a while before he pulled himself together and left the room. He walked along the corridor and down the stairs, found the unassuming door that - according to John - led to the service tract and the kitchen, went through it, and found himself in a brightly lit corridor lined with several doors.
He wasn't left in the dark for long, as he soon felt John's fingers touch his testicles, causing him to flinch a little.
"No. You?" John retorted dryly, which threw his friend for such a loop that he toppled and almost fell off the last stair.
"WHEN?!" John suddenly screamed at him. "When were you planning on telling me he's your brother?! That the bloody mayor is your fucking BROTHER?!"
Sherlock dropped his shoulders in disappointment, but accepted the fact that he was only wanted as a brainstormer at the moment.
Sherlock had already grasped John's hand, his smile almost bashful, but froze when he heard those words. He studied John's face attentively. When he didn't discover anything other than indulgent amusement without a trace of anger or irritation, his posture relaxed again and he released a sigh of surrender.
"At least," Sherlock returned, letting himself fall just a little bit into those eyes, despite Mycroft's presence.
"Why don't you use the same one you used last time?" To Mike's great surprise, John's cheeks turned a pale pink at the suggestion.
Irene rolled her eyes. "You're too gracious, your worshipfulness," she said sarcastically before cutting herself off. She gave him a quick, appraising look and then asked with a sudden wave of empathy, "I presume you're going to go back to your original repertoire as soon as you're ready to return to work? Hands and mouth?"
"She's too... perfect," Mycroft affirmed. "You should probably prepare yourself for her being anything but well-inclined toward you."
No. He hadn't known. He hadn't had any idea up to this point what Barbie's real name was or who he was...
At the almost-end of this story, I now have one request. I don't think it's too outrageous to ask for lots of comments at this point.
"But there is something you should know," John said. "I'm done with it. With him, I mean. Once and for all." He nodded to lend weight to his words and as if to prove to himself that it really was the case. "Seeing him again... opened my eyes."
"Fine," Mike sighed. "But why didn't you put on another black suit? You have more than one - I know that for a fact."
"A pleasurable business," she corrected him with a concerted effort at remaining polite, all the while glaring at him angrily.
"That could have gone better..." he said to the room in general. "It's a crying shame that our prepared evidence disappeared. Someone's after your head on a stick, Johnny."
He stopped after just a few steps. It slowly dawned on him that he was alone on the street for the first time since Irene had picked him up. Alone in the city. All alone in the open air.
"Stop!" Sherlock had the impression he was shouting, but in reality it was barely more than a whisper. Still, John heard him and paused in his motion.
"I was able to speak to him one last time..." Mycroft continued slowly, as if every word required an extreme effort. "His last words... concerned you."
Sherlock rested his elbows on the table, folded his hands under his chin, and leaned forward. He fixed John with a sober look from his fascinating, pale eyes, causing John to lose himself for a moment in the shimmering irises and the bottomless pupils.
, it had given Moran an even more influential position within the mob. The perfect position from which to throw spanners in John's plans and damage him while he himself flew under the radar and remained completely above reproach as John's saviour.
Irene realised she'd overdone it, and hurried to calm John Watson with a quick smile. “Then I'm sure you'll want to give him the good news right away,” she said. Although she made an effort not to let her true feelings show, it was clear that she had strong doubts as to whether it would be good news to Sherlock. “I'll get him. Wait here, please.” She stood up rather abruptly. Maybe she could smooth the way if she spoke to Sherlock alone first...
A short while later, Sherlock was naked and kneeling on the bed the way John had told him to. His legs spread, elbows and forehead on the mattress, his hands folded behind his neck, while John let the beloved riding crop dance on his backside.
A warm glow appeared in John's eyes, the one that went with the gentle, happy smile that curved up the corners of his mouth. That glow and that smile together regularly took Sherlock's breath away, making his heart beat just a little faster. For the plain and simple reason that he simply couldn't comprehend the fact that that smile and that glow were for him alone, and for no one else in the whole wide world. Sherlock still didn't know what he'd done to deserve that smile and that glow. No matter how hard he'd made his brain and mind palace work on the problem - he hadn't come any closer to a solution. He'd often been tempted to ask Mycroft about it - maybe he would be able to figure it out... damn it. Now he'd thought about Mycroft again!
"It appears that you've finally learned to temper your tongue when dealing with clients," Irene couldn't help but remark. Guests had complained all too often about Sherlock's sharp tongue, and those jeers – all but asking for disrespect from his customers - had been the cause of vengeful acts directed at him just as often. He'd always taken it all without complaint, however, never denouncing a client or refusing another appointment with the person in question.
A crease appeared on John's forehead as he approached him. "You are a goddamn work of art. Your skin is like marble. Your body is strong and flexible – like a dancer's," John explained earnestly. He laid his hands on Sherlock's shoulders and felt the other man tremble beneath his touch. "Lips as red as blood, skin as white as snow, and hair as dark as ebony," John continued his assessment, now no longer quite so serious. Then he lifted his head to Sherlock's ear and lowered his voice to a sensuous murmur: "And with a cock that's as aesthetic as all get-out and an arse that's all but begging to be fucked." His right hand underscored his words by wandering over Sherlock's back until it landed on his buttocks.
Sherlock blinked up from his task as well and watched as Mike shrugged his shoulders, said good-bye to the person on the other end of the line, and ended the call with a little sigh.
"There were still a couple of these in the black lacquer box," John remarked conversationally, and Sherlock felt his mouth start to water. There were more of the cigars! As soon as he was done here, he would... but John's voice, which had abruptly taken on a quite firm, sharp tone, tore him out of his salacious thoughts. "But when I'm done with you here, hopefully you won't want any more of them."
"By all means," Sherlock replied, letting the dressing gown he was wearing slide easily off his shoulders. He didn't have a single stitch of clothing on underneath, and presented his body in all its shameless glory, a fact which was both a pleasant surprise for John as well as the trigger for the first erotic stirrings in his groin.
John grinned, pleased. "So we're in agreement. Charming." He let go of Charlie's hair. A relieved intake of breath sounded. "Good - let's try and think of something that won't impede your powers of speech."
"No," Mike admitted, and a reluctant laugh escaped John's mouth, which was still clenched together in anger. "Why are you so upset?"
Sherlock's eyes widened. "You'd help me? Against John? Against... your friend?" he asked incredulously. "Why?"
from that point forward, should they choose to continue them. Greg's demanding behaviour that night had thrown him off, and although it hadn't been an entirely unpleasant experience to carry out those kinds of instructions, Mycroft did rather tend to see himself in the role of the one giving the orders. That's what he was used to, and he wanted to keep it that way.
"There's still that bloody Donovan, that's for sure, holding her hand out to someone. Probably the Russkies," John snarled from the window.
"You always exaggerate so," Sherlock broke in, completely unimpressed and with barely disguised ennui. "It's fifty-seven times now, including this one. Hardly a hundred."
"Then it's too late for a wreath." He cleared his throat. "Why have you called? Did she have any debts that need to be repaid?"
"Fine … I'll just have to wait until tomorrow morning." He rolled away from John and started to get up.
If anyone had told him two weeks ago that he would be so eager to lose his virginity – to a crimelord, no less – he would have told that person to find themselves a damn good shrink.
"You know, his offer was really quite generous..." she began somewhat uncertainly. "You don't need to work for me the rest of the time, if you don't want to anymore. He..."
"That's enough... more than enough," John said, registering with some annoyance how breathless and hoarse his voice sounded. The small, smug smirk that played around the edges of Sherlock's lips only added to his irritation. He'd exposed himself in front of this whore. That hadn't happened to him in a very long time.
John did lower his head - as expected - but stopped with his lips a mere breath from Sherlock's mouth. Sherlock sensed the warmth of John's body, smelled the coffee on his breath, felt John's fingers under his chin, and his heart rate increased in anticipation.
"That's right," Susan affirmed. "If you trusted him, you would have told him that you're going to therapy a long time ago, wouldn't you?"
"At any rate," Greg continued, "I tried to pick her brain a bit... you know, the kinds of thing you ask when you flirt... where she's from, what her hobbies are, where her family lives..." Greg took a sip of his tea.
And that thought filled him with a profound satisfaction. The plug would stimulate Sherlock, keeping him in a constant state of low arousal, filling him up, making him aware every single second where he belonged... and to whom he belonged...
“Where else should I be?” Sherlock asked forthrightly. “John won’t get rid of me that easily. He’d need to bring out bigger guns than he did last night.” He became pensive, finally shrugging and saying, “He’d have to shoot me or something...”
"No," Mike said automatically, but then he considered. "Although... he did manage to get John's butler to worship the ground he walks on."
Preparations for the diamond smuggling operation had reached a critical phase in which it had become necessary to include other members of the crime
The skin of his face and chest were also perceptibly reddened, his nipples had contracted and were just as hard and erect as his penis, and were begging just as desperately for release. Everything in John was screaming to give him that release with his mouth, lips, and teeth, but at the same time the sight was so mesmerising that he didn't want to interrupt his current actions at any price, not even to fulfill that desire. There was something hypnotic about Sherlock's body, which seemed to be trapped in a neverending cycle of jerky breaths and shudders.
The first dozen or so slaps had rained down angrily on Sherlock's cold skin. It had been painful, yet bearable, and Sherlock hadn't been tempted even once to rise up to defend himself or use his safeword. Still, the strength with which the blows had been delivered drove tears to his eyes, and he bit into the sheets with his teeth. The speed at which the individual blows came, one after another with barely a pause between, had completely taken his breath away and made it virtually impossible to cry out to give vent to his pain.
"No," she admitted somewhat grudgingly. "The only problem was finding clothes for him. His things were still in the room ... but other than that, he was as gentle as a lamb." She pursed her lips, waiting for his response.
There, he resumed his restless wanderings around the ground floor. At some point, he became aware of the fact that he was pacing back and forth in front of John's office, and stopped abruptly in front of the door.
"Thomas," the butler snapped. "Get back to work." Thomas bowed slightly and left the kitchen through another door. Probably to fetch the bottle of water. "If there will be nothing else..." The butler turned to Sherlock with icy civility.
“Thomas - please go and get Mrs Turner, as well as Anthea and Eleanor. I have something to tell you all.”
"I don't think so. I was simply..." Sherlock cast about for the right words. "...younger... more in need of protection. You were so much older than me already. He probably thought you didn't need him as much as I did. But I do know that he loved you at least as much as he loved me.
Sherlock bit down on his lips and lowered his head. It was humiliating to hump a piece of furniture like an animal when there were more than enough hands available, even though he would have been more than happy just a few minutes ago if John had allowed him the same exact stimulation. But now … now he felt as if he were being put on display, and not in a good way. He felt debased, and yet...
"I don't want you to leave." John's heart was beating in his throat. Was it really that easy to say the words? So simple? Why hadn't he said them earlier? Much, much earlier?
“You could work a bit for it too,” John reprimanded him, slapping him on the arse with one hand. Sherlock jerked and tensed his muscles. A sharp, lust-filled shout escaped his plump lips.
"Oh..." Mycroft said slowly, and straightened up. "You weren't aware that Sherlock is my brother?" His lips curled in an unctuous smile. "What delicious irony." He leaned back and casually crossed his legs.
John caressed it slowly, using only his fingertips. A first drop of precome oozed sluggishly from the tip and John rubbed it over the glans with his thumb. Another moan filled the room and John continued to rub over the little slit with his thumb, spreading the now steady flow of precome on the whole glans. He heard Sherlock's deep moans, felt the soft pulsing of the hot flesh and thought:
Sherlock tested the tension in the ropes with a sense of appreciation, felt the slight stretch in his arms, enjoyed the mild discomfort in his shoulder joints to the fullest. He sighed in satisfaction. Everything was as it should be. The grateful smile he gave John when he was standing in front of Sherlock again set off a glow in his partner's dark blue eyes.
"And now take off your clothes ... please," John said – politely, but with a fiendish grin that was feared more than a death sentence in certain circles.
"He didn't tell me he was going until recently either. I saw he had her card a while ago. I've no idea how many appointments he's already had with her..."
All of a sudden, Sherlock pressed the plug into John's hand. "Put it where it belongs," he growled in John's ear, sliding the full length of his body against John's.
"Fuck," John moaned softly, biting down on his lips as Sherlock placed his hands calmly on John's thighs and slowly slipped his mouth over the tip of John's penis.
He didn't spend his nights there anymore, but all of his clothing was still stored in the green room. Whenever he got dressed or changed his clothes, his eye was drawn to the open box as if by magic. It was pure torture for him every time, with every glance, to be forcibly reminded of his ruined dreams and the accessory humiliations.
"Very good, Mr Watson," the butler said impassively, bowing slightly. "May I clear the dishes? Was everything satisfactory?"
John laughed a little. "That your brother's daft?" Sherlock sighed happily and John laughed again. "Your brother's daft. And I really wonder how you managed to resist the temptation to kill him for so many years. I'm almost there myself. It can't have been a lack of opportunity on your part."
But there was something else... another smell. A smell that was so unusual, so surprising, in connection with John that Sherlock hadn't noticed it at first, and that in itself was remarkable if not downright disturbing.
"Moran - you're the new borough head, as of now. Your first assignment is to sweep this mess under the rug," John said, nodding at Albright's body.
. Nothing better either. He usually knocks when I..." John stopped short, his forehead creasing momentarily. "When I have a friend here. He doesn't always remember at first, though - but I only need to remind him once. It won't happen again." After a moment's reflection, he added, "He may actually have been horrified, but he's too well trained to let it show."
John had taken him from Irene the same way he'd taken Jacques, the butler and master of all things coffee, from his previous employer. John engaged only the best to provide for his physical well-being. The best chauffeur, the best coffee-maker, and … the best cocksucker - Sherlock.
"Anything else?" John returned lightly. "That would be more like a reward for you. No, my decision stands. No lip contact for the next 24 hours. Maybe you'll think twice next time whether the cigarette's
An urgent, almost desperate tug on his shirt followed the frantically blurted words. But John didn't react. Instead, he continued steadfastly licking and sucking the hard, twitching flesh in his mouth. He hadn't planned on letting Sherlock ejaculate in his mouth, but now - given Sherlock's insecurity - he'd got it into his head to do exactly that. And he wasn't going to let anything stop him. Not even Sherlock himself.
John wanted nothing more than to plunge into him right then and there... he would have forced his hard cock into the twitching opening and felt the convulsions of the prolonged climax that was wracking Sherlock right then, thanks to the anal beads. Instead, he had to make do with his own hand, which was working frantically over his erection. His hips automatically jerked upward and hot semen erupted between his fingers.
One floor below, John was also getting ready to make a call... one which he’d put off for far too long.
She took it, gloating shamelessly over all the zeroes. That holiday home on the coast was as good as paid for.
"Don't you mean: why aren't you upstairs in bed with me?" John replied evasively, albeit in a playful manner.
There was a critical moment when he wondered whether he were going to be sick, but then the moment passed and his heart began to beat in rhythm again.
John could never say how evenings like that would end … sometimes nothing happened at all, sometimes John gestured to Sherlock and they went into John's bedroom to have some fun, and sometimes … sometimes Sherlock crawled on all fours over to him, climbed into his lap, nibbled at his earlobe and teased him until he tossed Sherlock over the nearest piece of furniture and got off with him until Sherlock's cries rang through the entire house.
John held himself completely still, not moving his finger a single millimetre more. Even if he'd wanted to, he couldn't have, as Sherlock was now incredibly tight, having virtually snapped himself shut like a prudish oyster. At the thought of that virginal tightness awaiting him, his neglected cock awakened promptly from the lethargy it had temporarily sunk into during the course of the lengthy preparations, reporting its interest and excitement.
Miss Adler's establishment was an old, multi-storey Victorian townhouse situated on a side street in a halfway decent part of the city. John's chauffeur stopped to let him off, then drove on to find a place to park. John would text him when he was ready to be picked up.
"...do the right thing," John interrupted him gently. "I know..." He pulled the coffee table closer with one foot and placed both hands on Sherlock's back. "Lie down." He carefully supported Sherlock, waiting until his shoulders and head rested on the table and his legs hung down on either side of the back of the chair while his lower body still lay in John's lap.
John's thoughts were whirling like buzzing bees inside his head. Nearly everything he thought he knew about Sherlock had been turned inside-out in the matter of a few minutes.
In the meantime, John made himself comfortable in the second chair, looking as if he had all the time in the world.
Sherlock took that to be the answer to his question. Yes - without John, so many things would never have been possible... so many things would never have happened... his life would never have taken a turn for the better.
"That's going to be rather difficult," Mycroft answered in a dull tone that made John perk up his ears.
"Right," he started again slowly, finally giving himself a little internal shove. "Miss Sigerson, I may not be exactly what you wanted for your son, but... I can promise you that I... you don't need to worry about him anymore. Never again." John took a deep breath.
Sherlock sighed and fingered John's handkerchief in his trouser pocket. He'd been carrying it around with him ever since John had left the house. If only he were at least allowed to call him... but John had made it abundantly clear that a call at the wrong time could have catastrophic consequences... and Sherlock understood that. A mobile phone ring tone - or even just a vibration - at a crucial moment could distract John or give away his position. At the thought of losing John, Sherlock's entire body cramped up and he felt sick. The need for a cigarette became almost overwhelming.
"Or must I beg? Is that it?" A spark of defiance appeared in his eyes. "Do you want to see me grovel? Must I debase myself before you first? If that's what you want... I'm prepared to do it. As long as it's really necessary."
He sank into John's dark blue eyes, took John's face gently between his hands and tilted it up. Then he kissed him. Softly, hungrily, and with a sense of desperation. Felt the narrow mouth open for him and receive him tenderly. Sherlock separated his mouth from John's, tilted his head to the other side and renewed their deep kiss, which quickly became wetter and more indecent without losing any of its gentleness. Their tongues met, twined incessantly around each other, licked over teeth, sucked on lips. Over and over again they breathed in each other's warmth and proximity. Shared their breath before their lips met once more for a new, never-ending kiss.
This manner of locomotion had always appeared absurd – or at least extremely obsequious - on every other man John had known. But not on Sherlock. Now, it reminded him of the feline movements of a panther, tracking its prey with animalistic instinct in order to pounce at just the right moment.
Sherlock's fingers promptly shot out toward John's hand, caught him by the sleeve of his jacket, and plucked at the expensive material in a bashful gesture reminiscent of a small child.
"Yes, because they're delivering it and setting it up tomorrow morning, and you..." John's tone became more stern. "… you're not to lay a single eye on it until I'm back."
"I'm afraid we're at a bit of a stand-off," Holmes finally said, his tone cool. "I find it difficult to believe you had no knowledge of the incident at customs."
“So?” John echoed disbelievingly. “That’s…” He shook his head. “I’d be pissed if someone made fun of my cock and I can’t… I just can’t… your prick
Greg nodded again, but remained completely unimpressed. "Miss Morstan... does he have someone in with him at the moment?"
"No, of course not," John growled. "No one said anything openly, but they all made it clear with their more or less vague allusions." John tore open the door of the minibar and stared at the neatly arranged selection of bottles.
Irene knocked on the door again, more forcefully than the first time. Finally, she heard something moving on the other side of the door.
Sherlock's face took on an almost defiant expression, but there was a flash of uncertainty behind it, wondering whether he'd gone too far. He knew that John and Mike were just having fun, but the thought that John might kiss someone else was suddenly completely unbearable.
"Looks like you have an interesting reel running in that mind palace of yours," John's faintly mocking voice tore him out of his gay military daydreams.
"I'm afraid I haven't expressed myself clearly enough," John remarked coldly. "If you're a very good boy and give me an answer right now, you may not leave here on your own two feet... but at least you'll have a chance of using your legs again in a year or so."
Sherlock flung his eyes open in shock. He didn't dare look down. Could it be? Could it be that John – John! - was licking his erection with his tongue? Licking him clean? Over and over again?
Why was he such a goddamn adrenaline junkie? Mike had always warned him it would get him in trouble again. Too bad Mike wasn't here to see the confirmation of his prediction. John's mouth went dry; he still had enough air, but it was a close thing. Yet he didn't call out for help or reach for the weapon in the inner breast pocket of his jacket. The pistol was small, more like a dainty trinket for a woman's handbag, but it would do enough damage at this close range to give him an advantage. John had taken it in order not to leave the house completely unarmed, as the shoulder holster for his favourite gun would have shown too much under his suit. It simply wouldn't have been appropriate for a funeral. He didn't even try to use his unhampered right hand to free himself. He simply held still. Fascinated and completely enthralled by Sherlock's angry outburst.
Irene hadn't expected that. “A favour? For me?” She quickly got her surprise under control. “You're too good to me,
"You don't think so?" Sherlock asked, his bitterness poorly veiled. "Then allow me to inform you that that is precisely Mycroft's preferred
Sherlock, however, was completely unimpressed by the outburst. He merely raised an eyebrow and asked, irritated, "Should I prepare for another meltdown?"
He wet his lips to cover his silence and horror, before saying, "All right... fine. We can fix that. If that's what you want..." He put the safety back on his gun, as if in afterthought, and returned it to his shoulder holster. Then he slid off the bed and stood up. "I'll go right down to Miss Adler and take care of it." He walked past Sherlock, but Sherlock grabbed him and stopped him. The adrenaline was still pumping through John's veins like mad, and the unexpected disturbance was enough to cause his anger to ignite again.
"I came to you of my own free will," Sherlock explained gently yet firmly. "Mike warned me, so I knew what I was in for."
Brick after brick... formed into oval archways and massive, stocky pillars that rose up out of low walls, extending yard after yard in surreal symmetry until they were swallowed up in impenetrable blackness.
John, who hadn't done so when he sat down, took the gesture as an intentional insult, and the combination of that along with Mycroft's words roused his combative spirit. He could still try the diplomatic route later. But right now, he needed to put this arrogant snot in his place.
Irritated and a little annoyed at himself, Mycroft shook his head at his own sentimentality. Under no circumstances could he afford to lose control. Mummy had never lost control over herself. And she had expected no less from him, from his earliest childhood onwards. That was the example she'd given, and the way she'd raised him. She had been...
It was too much for John... the taste of Sherlock's skin on his tongue, the tight, continuously twitching muscles surrounding his throbbing cock... the sweet aroma of the crushed strawberries... the scent of sin... He let go of Sherlock's nipple, buried his face in the curve of Sherlock's neck, and pushed in as deep and hard as he could... he wavered a moment... then Sherlock cried out his name roughly... Sherlock's semen spurted onto his stomach... the wave of his arousal broke over him and he spent himself inside Sherlock's trembling body.
Sherlock glanced down at his hand, which was still ensconced in John's. He saw it as if for the first time. Then he lifted his head and looked John in the eye. He examined John's face, seeking some point of reference, anything that would help him to finally understand this man. But John was so different than anyone else he'd ever known. John was sadistic yet caring, quick-tempered yet forgiving, brutal and ruthless and uncontrollable yet blessed with the patience of an angel where he - Sherlock - was concerned. Never before had anyone exercised so much patience with him, and he simply didn't understand it. Even now, he could see nothing but indulgence in John's face.
"Have fun looking for the needle in that haystack." Mike chuckled in resignation. "According to what John's told me, Charlie was dead certain John was the one who'd hired him... of course through someone who was posing as a middleman. Ridiculous. That someone would actually fall for a trick like that..."
That would be the first step... the first step toward finally taking charge once again over his own life.
An awkward silence filled the room, broken only by the continued blare of the television. After a shock-filled moment, all eyes turned to John as if on cue.
This particular manner of penetrating another body brought with it an odd kind of intimacy - it was almost more intense than one of the more usual sexual acts. Maybe it was because fingers were more agile and could act more independently than a penis.
"I loved you, Victor..." John repeated, casting about desperately for something he could say to buttress up his credibility. "Do you need money? Is there any way I can help you? Anything for... the kids? For their education?" he asked almost helplessly.
'. Sherlock immediately sank to his knees on the floor in a single graceful motion and looked up at John, his eyes filled with adoration. John, on the other hand, was hesitant. What was he supposed to do now? He would have liked nothing better than to lay Sherlock on a bed of silk and satin in return for everything he'd gone through for him. But if Sherlock preferred the floor right now... John tossed a cushion down, and Sherlock lowered himself onto it with a quiet smile. He shifted his weight, held his breath for a moment and then sighed with bliss. John's eye fell on Sherlock's penis, which was starting to fill with blood again and no longer hung completely limp between his legs... and on the gleaming prince's wand, which was still inside him.
"Perhaps I am a bit dehydrated," Mycroft acceded. "A cup of tea certainly wouldn't hurt. Where is this café supposed to be?"
John shook his head. "Sorry, no..." he denied it. "I'm not letting you put that on me. You'll have to find another scapegoat. I never touch the police unless there's no other recourse. And even then... I have absolutely no reason to set off … a
“I haven't the foggiest notion,” Sherlock declared with a thin smile. “Do you want to have them?” he asked, lifted his cup from the saucer and slid the latter across the table to John. “I don't mind.” Surprisingly, that was the pure, unvarnished truth. It was the gesture that counted for Sherlock. Not the tidbits in his mouth.
Incomprehensible sounds came from Sherlock's mouth, and he tugged at his bonds as John came closer, stopping behind his spread legs.
"Now that that's settled..." Sherlock said with a low, impatient sigh. "Could we get to the matter at hand? Whereby I should mention that John's already told me quite a lot about the whole situation with Charlie."
Sherlock whimpered, squirming on the sheets, begging for attention. But John didn’t touch him. He wanted an answer.
Sherlock's entire body tensed up. In his ecstasy, however, he didn't know whether he should try to escape the miraculous stimulation or whether he should curl himself towards that brutal finger. Overwhelmed by the two opposing desires, he froze stiff where he was, his mouth distended as if in a scream.
"My scar," John explained. His rough whisper was barely audible, yet it cut easily through the darkness to reach Sherlock's ear. "You're the first one I've ever let touch it. You're the first one who's been fascinated by it rather than disgusted. You're the first one who's ever actually wanted to touch it and kiss it, and you're the first one I've let do it and whose touch I... enjoy." John waited for Sherlock's response, his heart pounding. He'd never gone this far out on a limb before to expose his own weakness. Never made himself so vulnerable. Sherlock wasn't saying anything. Why wasn't he saying anything? He talked nonstop the rest of the time! Why was he silent now of all times?
"You of all people deign to give me advice on honesty and one's choice of profession?" Sherlock responded haughtily.
The corner of John's mouth twitched, and his smile suddenly turned into a derisive smirk. "You'd be waiting a long time for that," he remarked. "Sherlock... is my business, and mine alone. We don't need to prove anything to anyone."
John bit his lower lip in order not to moan again. He had to clench his fists at the second swallow. The third swallow had him closing his eyes. At the fourth swallow... he had to exert all his willpower not to lose control and thrust repeatedly into that deep, narrow throat.
Once again, John sought refuge in shaking his head. "I really don't know why I let you talk so much," he mused.
"And then... one of my former clients is sitting at the next table. What then?" he asked in a voice that was both more cutting and more forlorn than he'd intended. This was more than just an excuse for Sherlock. More than a variant of the lie he'd built up. It was something that really concerned him. Not for his sake... but for John's.
"You have to ask?" Sherlock retorted breathlessly, stroking his erection, which stood up at an angle to his body, stiff and thick.
"Er, yeah... sorry... I don't know either," John stammered sheepishly, glad for the fact that Sherlock had his back turned to him so he couldn't see John's face turning red. What had got into him? What was he thinking? He'd never done anything like that before... to be fair, such drastic aftercare had never been necessary with any of his earlier lovers, as John never let himself go like that... had never let himself go so far...
," Sherlock automatically corrected him. "Yes, I... I still have the glasses somewhere. Should I..."
"Room eleven – but I really can't..." the doorman made one last, desperate attempt. Why did the boss lady have to wear such high heels? She'd have been at the door already if she wore flats, and could have dealt with the mob boss herself. If he ever came out of this mess alive, he was going to demand a pay rise!
"I..." Sherlock's heart was so full that it strangled his vocal cords. Words that were foreign to him crowded onto his tongue, but he couldn't bring himself to speak them aloud. They felt too unfamiliar... he was too inexperienced in these things... "I was just... playing around," he answered with a deprecatory grimace.
For one long moment, John stood there staring at him, his mouth hanging open. Then he scrubbed his hands through his hair.
," said Jacques. "I'll take care of it." He straightened his bow tie and went into the entrance hall just as John Watson entered the house.
"No... but..." Sherlock wrinkled his brow. "You didn't just want my permission?" he pressed as he finally seemed to understand. "You really want to talk about it beforehand?"
with me to slam my cock up your tight little virgin arse. I want to hear you beg me to give it to you but good. To fuck you into the ground. Hard and fast and without mercy."
Sherlock did as he was told, and within a matter of moments he stood before John wearing only his shirt – which hung open on his shoulders – and silken boxers in the same purple colour as the shirt... with the exception of a wet patch which made for a darker shade in that particular spot.
"Fuck the suit," John gave voice to Sherlock's thoughts and poured some of the cream over his genitals. "
He hadn't gone more than ten steps before he saw Mike standing in front of him. John hadn't seen him arrive. Furious and confused, he stopped where he was and ran a hand through his hair.
Although both of their blood tests came back negative, John continued to withhold his semen from Sherlock. It was something he used to tempt and torture him – something he dangled in front of him but never let him have.
Sherlock didn't let the chance go unused. He arched toward John, welcomed him unconditionally into his body, let him work off steam, and tried to be as good to him as he could at the moment.
Sherlock sighed in annoyance. "What are you doing here?" he asked, putting an end to the senseless chit-chat.
"Don't start with that! Do not try to get clever with me!" He threatened Sherlock with his index finger. "I should have known from the start. From the first second! The same arrogance, the same sarcasm! God! Brothers!"
Then he gave John a wicked look from his half-lidded eyes and moistened his lips – dry from all the moaning and screaming – with the tip of his tongue. As a provocation it couldn't have been any clearer. Still, it seemed to John that it wasn't the whole truth. As if Sherlock were trying to hide something from him with this demonstration. But what? Could it be
Sherlock had reached him by now and sank down onto his knees beside John's chair in a single, smooth motion.
"I have never spread my legs … for anyone … except you. And you bloody well know it." Sherlock's voice was as ominous, low and dark as the distant roll of thunder, and went straight to John's cock, circumventing his brain entirely, causing the former to stiffen slowly but surely.
It would be brilliant, sure, and satisfying for them both... but this was not about him... not even about
Desire throbbed in John's groin, and he bit down on his lips. He couldn't lose control yet. Not yet. He still had to concentrate. He owed it to Sherlock. But later... later, all bets were off.
Although Jacques accepted the praise in the modest, genteel manner of a well-bred and well-paid servant, it was clear how much it meant to him.
His gaze met John's dark blue eyes, now almost black with arousal, and John's reddened lips, glistening with moisture.
When she joined Sherlock in her office several minutes later, Sherlock hissed angrily – without any further word of explanation - that that man had no right to touch him
"Because I'm not going to do that again until you don't pull a face when you sit down even though you've got two cushions on your chair."
The shame of his error threatened to overwhelm him. There was no anger and no adrenaline to make the hurt bearable. There was no lust and no desire to transform the ache into something sensual.
Dave led the way into the living room, where two long couches stood opposite each other, separated by a low coffee table. John and Mycroft each claimed one of the couches for themselves. Dave took up position behind John, while Naresh stood near Mycroft. The sun - which had finally managed to break through the thick cover of clouds - bathed the room in warm, yellow light even through the filter of the opaque curtains. The effect set a strong contrast to the icy atmosphere that existed between the two seated men.
What Sherlock hadn't been ready for, however, was the pain of the humiliation and rejection that accompanied the blows, and which he only became aware of now that his entire face seemed to be on fire.
he completed the sentence to himself. But he didn't want to burden Mike with that answer. "For a while now," he said instead. "But I'm more interested in knowing... since when have you had an opinion on the
much less... apt," Mycroft explained with a faint grimace meant to express his distaste. "What would that make me? The queen bee? Really..."
"Oh my God," John whispered huskily. He felt the new muscle contractions around his unbearably hard erection, thrust in once more, felt everything with a sudden, blinding, burning intensity, and spilled with a cry deep inside Sherlock's trembling body.
"At least you stay in one place here of your own free will instead of continually running away," Mycroft added. "Although I do wonder how Mr Watson puts up with you day in and day out, given your unparalleled conduct."
"That... that's it?" he heard John ask. Sherlock looked up, feeling just as surprised as John sounded.
"How do you know?" Sherlock returned with a sly smile, sending John's previous argumentation right back at him like a boomerang. John nodded. He'd seen that point coming and accepted it with a bowed head. "You see..." Sherlock concluded, not unkindly.
"He'd do anything just to see you smile... to please you... to gain your attention. Don't abuse that. Don't make him do anything for you that goes against his nature. He's... a good man... I don't know him, but the way John's been bad-mouthing him he must be a decent fellow." Sherlock panted, his breath getting short. The long speech had tired him visibly.
“Well, I … don't know...” Irene giggled nervously. John sent her a look that was slightly perplexed for all that it was calculating. “So he doesn't know what your plans are for him? No, of course not. What exactly are your plans for him? I mean... where are you going to take him?”
"And here I thought the only reason you don't want me to go is because you're going to miss me," John went on in the same light-hearted vein.
"Congratulations... your efforts have proven successful," he said with a strange combination of pride, relief, and desire. "My resistance has been successfully..." He broke off and gave his head half a shake. No. No half-truths for John. All or nothing. He looked up again. "You have succeeded in breaking
The taunts of the other students weren't forgotten, but they faded even further into the background, lost their meaning and no longer influenced how he saw himself, while John's compliments assumed a much larger role in his thoughts and rose closer to the forefront. Sherlock hearkened back to how gradually this development had occurred... how John's words of praise had been so painful at first... how they had later become merely unpleasant... how he had finally learned to accept them as some sort of delusion John suffered from, and how he could now believe them himself.
"Greedy as ever..." John said in a register that came suspiciously close to being a contented purr. "How about you?" he asked with a fiendish smile. "Should I milk you again to take the edge off?"
They went down the hall past several doors, behind which Sherlock supposed were the other - currently unused - guest bedrooms.
Above him, Sherlock let out a cry of surprise. "Oh, God... J-John... wh-what... are you doing? Sh-shouldn't I... Oh Godddd..." A long, drawn-out moan punctuated Sherlock's stammered sob. It sounded as if he were utterly overwhelmed.
John chewed on his lower lip, his expression grim. "Roehampton." He practically spat the word out. "The home-cooked drugs."
With a mixture of amusement and irritation - and to be completely honest, a large dose of arousal - he observed the effect his words had on Sherlock. The glassy, slightly disconnected look, the dilated pupils, the gently parted lips, the clearly visible pulsing of the veins in that long, white neck...
... something," Greg blustered in an undertone. "God... I can't even remember my own title! Something horribly nondescript anyway that's got nothing at all to do with the police and that I wish I'd never let myself in for!"
"Yes, dear," Doris responded immediately and took her hand, which lay limply on the blanket. "I'm right here."
"And I'm a happy lesbian." She lifted her chin in a challenging gesture. "And I still think the flower arrangement is gorgeous. They'll be wasted on Sherlock. He doesn't have an eye for things like that."
"All right, fine," John grumbled. "Mike, give our next appointment a call and let them know we'll be there later."
"That's why the results didn't jibe with the exit polls!" John cried out in sudden understanding, before shouting at Mycroft, "I can't believe it!"
When Mrs Turner put a plate of chocolate walnut biscuits in front of him, he was reminded so strongly of Mrs Hudson and his father's cook that he said, quite without thinking, "I prefer ginger nuts," only to immediately snap his mouth shut and look up at Mrs Turner in horror.
"I'm to be killed then," Sherlock went on placidly - at least on the outside. He wasn't about to show any weakness in front of John's enemies. He wanted John to have reason to be proud of him. Inside he was laughing hysterically, however. On the very day when he'd thought his life might finally have taken a turn for the better... might finally be
John’s story of how he’d received the scar on his shoulder led Sherlock to conclude that John could even sense a threat that came from behind his back. He hadn’t been fast enough that time either, but that was excusable given the circumstances. He’d had to turn around first, after all.
Sherlock was breathing hard. He knew what John wanted, and he wanted to give it to him. It still cost him dearly... but it was a delicious feeling to bow to the will of someone else.
John chewed on the inside of his cheek. He and Mike had nearly come to blows over precisely that issue.
. It's not as if you're going to go screaming it from the rooftops. I exchanged the ballot boxes from the districts of Lambeth & Southwark and Brent & Harrow after the polls closed."
. So Sherlock hadn't really told him everything. The way in which Mycroft formulated his remark didn't allow for any other conclusion. He'd already suspected it but he hadn't had much of anything to go on until Sherlock apologised - without saying for what. But in spite of all his efforts, Sherlock still hadn't confided in him. At least not yet. John hadn't given up hope. But no matter what it was, no matter how much he was dying of curiosity - he wanted to hear it from Sherlock himself. Not from his pompous half-brother. And so John only had one option: to lie.
John felt the whole world had gone topsy-turvy. "How can you be so... it's NOT unnecessary!" he countered vehemently, jumping up off the bed.
"Because this is precisely where you wanted me to be," Sherlock answered calmly. "Why should I be anywhere else?"
No sooner were they both in bed and John had turned off the light than Sherlock was wide awake. His fatigue had disappeared, leaving him restless and a little nervous. He was hypersensitive to every sound, every movement and every breath from John. He tried to relax. John really just wanted to sleep. That should actually be a soothing thought, but quite the opposite was the case. Sherlock didn't understand what the motivation was behind it. He'd never just lain in bed next to someone and slept. He didn't have any experience with it. Was it acceptable to cuddle? Or would it be better to turn his back to John? No, that would certainly be impolite... maybe he should ask whether he... No, that wouldn't work either. If John was about to fall asleep, he shouldn't bother him. Sherlock lay on his back stiffly, not moving so much as his little finger and hardly daring to breathe.
"Not to worry," Greg said with a wink. "I'll tell him you tried everything you could to stop me." Then he opened the door to Mycroft's sanctum sanctorum and went in.
"Of course," Sherlock said after brief reflection. He'd been hit in the face many times. He recalled fleetingly the last time Irene had slapped him when he'd thrown a tantrum because he'd thought his client wanted to get into his arse … that had been so long ago now … He hadn't really felt the impact strongly that time. Even though Irene's punch packed more than enough power, he'd been too angry and upset to feel the pain. On the other hand, he'd never received a slap like this before … in cold blood and meant as a punishment. An uneasy prickling sensation spread through his abdomen.
John pushed his chin forward and bit his lips. "What do you want to hear?" He was frothing with barely controlled rage. "That he's the best cocksucker I've ever come across? That he was an extraordinary fuck? We're here to get some work done! Not to chat about my latest sexual escapades!"
once more. And so John got a handle on his facial muscles, pursed his lips, acted as if he were giving Sherlock's request – no, his command – serious consideration, and then withdrew his cock entirely.
"Oh, for heaven's sake," Irene cried with a long-suffering look. "Yes, I understand now... your Doc hasn't said those three little words to you yet. So what?" She underscored her statement with a dismissive gesture. "The Doc is no honey-tongued smooth-talker... He'll say it to you eventually."
After directing his gaze at Sherlock's plump erection with a look that was both salacious and reproving, John took out a metal cock ring from the pocket of his trousers. Sherlock swallowed hard. His throat was suddenly dry with arousal. That was the smallest cock ring John owned... and although it was quite tight, it wasn't impossible to ejaculate with it on. Sherlock had proven that on more than one occasion. But whenever John used that cock ring, it meant he wanted to take his time. It looked like this was going to be a long night...
"Your... brother?" John echoed, bewildered. "But I don't have anyone..." It was then that the other shoe dropped. John gasped. "
Albright was still standing in front of him, his face distorted into a grimace and his fists clenched.
"That's good. Excellent, in fact!" John praised him with a patronising undertone. "Good boy. Are we going to behave ourselves now?"
"Yeah," Albright confirmed. "Your behaviour. What kind of boss doesn't have his shop under control?" Now Albright started to lose his composure as he became more agitated.
"Don't forget the cock ring," John whispered before dropping a kiss on Sherlock's full, trembling lips and setting off in the direction of the Tube station.
John ran his tongue across his upper lip and answered with an oily grin: "Frot the back of the couch until you come." When Sherlock hesitated a moment too long, John said, more sharply, "I'm waiting."
"Jacques?" The butler stopped where he was, bewildered, and Sherlock decided to take a chance on his weak position with this particular segment of the staff. "We require coffee." He deliberately omitted a
But he'd never been as wrong in his life as he was with this unpredictable wanker. For, to John's amazement, Sherlock's sultry-smoky bedroom eyes switched over to a sharp, alert, and calculating expression from one moment to the next.
Then he removed his fingers from Sherlock's body, which resulted in the other man whining and voicing some unintelligible complaints. He then stared greedily at the dilated, twitching hole.
"Mr Watson... our meeting isn't for another hour," Moran remarked. His expression became more full of foreboding yet also more alert with every word.
"Hello, Mama..." Sherlock said suddenly in a soft voice, sounding both so happy and so sad at the same time that John's heart squeezed, and he pulled his hand back, suddenly uncertain. Sherlock lifted his eyes from the gravestone, up to the blue sky, and took several deliberate breaths before focussing on his mother's name again and continuing in a soft, tentative yet determined voice: "I've thought about what I wanted to tell you for days, and now that I'm here it's all... gone. I'm... I'm sorry, Mama. My life... wasn't what you would have wanted for me, I'm sure - and it probably never will be. But... in the end, it all led me to..." He stopped and hesitated before starting again: "I've met someone I'd like to introduce to you - Mama... this is John," he said abruptly, touching John's arm and pushing him gently but firmly closer to the grave.
It might have been frightening, but Sherlock felt the snap of the cold on his cheeks, and for the first time in his life, he felt truly free. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the fresh, cold air. Dark clouds hung over London. It smelled of snow. And car exhaust. It was all a bit much.
Sherlock smiled, satisfied. “And afterwards… when you have… examined it thoroughly – your opinion as a doctor is very valuable to me – maybe a small demonstration would indeed be appropriate…” He casually started to fumbling with the belt on his robe. “I can imagine my experiences in masturbation might be of interest for you.”
He quickly took a sealed condom out of his trouser pocket, tore it open with his teeth, took out the thin latex shell and tossed the packaging carelessly on the bed. He unrolled the condom carefully and with precision over his stiff member, then felt blindly on the bed until his fingers found the tube of lubricant. He spread a generous portion on his erection, inhaling sharply through his teeth – the contrast of the cool gel on his hot skin was unexpected.
, John Watson.' At least that's how John would have taken care of things. But his adversary apparently didn't want him dead... or not just dead - John wasn't entirely sure about that. But what else did he want? To break the mob? John didn't know. He simply didn't know, and that uncertainty and constant second-guessing was going to drive him insane if it didn't end soon.
SwissMiss - Thank you for this brilliant translation. Words can not express how much I owe you and adore you.
Unfortunately, Inspector Lestrade hadn't been able to contribute anything more toward solving the bombing either. He hadn't noticed any identifying characteristics other than the fact that the second accomplice had black hair and was a bit shorter than Moran. His memory was continuing to play some rather unpleasant tricks on him regarding the night of the attack.
"Oh - just this thing where I don't want to end up sitting there like some idiot again while your brother shakes another ace out of his sleeve," John replied conversationally.
Kitty… I modelled her after Kitty Winter from the original stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. But if you like… you can also think of her as Kitty Riley from the BBC series.
Mycroft opened the square box and took out two foil packets. One obviously contained a condom, and the other was filled with a small amount of lubricant gel. Mycroft squeezed the gel packet, assessing the contents. There wasn't much.
The question threw John for a loop. On the other hand, Sherlock had every right to know where he'd be living from now on. Maybe he was just too surprised to express his happiness openly.
'? Was Lestrade just going to stand for 'Ginger' without so much as batting an eye? Impressive. Rather astonishing, in fact. He'd have to come up with something even more creative next time.
Sherlock's thoughts were racing and he worried at his lower lip. Was it possible for the data to end up in the wrong hands? How could he have been so stupid?! How could he - after everything he'd been through - not have thought of the security cameras? After he'd avoided the accursed things for years - had even developed a remarkable skill in doing so despite the fact that he'd been stoned half the time.
"Excuse me?" he retorted snippily, and once again Sherlock's deep, soothing voice pierced the darkness. Calm and objective and full of conviction.
There was something disarming about Sherlock's attitude that caused John to shake his head. What business was it of his whether Sherlock played fast and loose with his health? None. None at all. He was going to protect himself from any possible infections, and not give a flying fuck about the rest. His anger blew over as quickly as it had come up. A soft sigh hovered in his throat. His temper had got the better of him once again before he'd been able to rein it in.
It probably didn't make any difference that the offer had come from Sherlock himself that time, whereas this time John would be the one asking... or did it? Was that why he was hesitating? But he'd have to ask him... because what he needed, what he had in mind... Sherlock would never think of
John's hands wrapped around Sherlock's throat with an iron grip. Sherlock's fingers immediately caught John's wrists in order to prevent the worst from happening. But John didn't squeeze. He just held him there, showing no mercy. It seemed as if everything were frozen in place until John said, his voice broken, "Why... don't you just end it... put an end to it... Why don't you fight back? Why the hell aren't you fighting back?!" And Sherlock knew that John really did want Sherlock to fight back, to stand his ground against him, to use his safeword, to put up some sort of resistance... no matter how or what, as long as Sherlock didn't just let John do whatever he wanted. But that was precisely what Sherlock planned to do, and what he was doing right now. He was giving John free rein.
The brief swish of the riding crop through the air, the blow, the muted slap of leather on skin, the contraction, the sensation of cold - which only lasted for a fraction of a second - and then...
"Lube?" he asked. "Why not vaseline like last time? I liked... It felt good." A faint blush rose to his pale cheeks along with the admission.
