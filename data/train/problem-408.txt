As Sherlock continued to study the men and women in the ornate room, his gaze settling back on the magnificent greek god, he began to feel a tingling feeling running down his back and a swirling in his abdomen, a pulsation. He waited for it to disperse, but it only grew, a delicious ache. For a moment, he feared he was going to be ill, his stomach churning, but he realized mere moments later when he glanced down at the slight indentation at the front of his trousers that he was not ill, although the sensations were admittedly new.
Outside, John stared at the door for a moment before slumping down against it, head resting upon it and preparing for a long night of guarding the ice princess.
But more than beautiful, he was intelligent. Witty without being cruel, as love had surrounded his upbringing with endless opportunities to grow into a kindhearted young man.
He wanted John to own him.
“John, you're one of the best soldier's I've ever known. You're ruthless and precise, a leader through and through. I know you've been approached by others for your skills, but you turn them away. Just come with me, John. I can’t bear the thought of you here alone,” Greg begged, and damn, he knew that John could never resist a man begging for her, while complimenting something other than her womanly figure.
. I am going to stuff you full and then plug you up, refusing your release and marking you as
Sherlock and John stared at one another from across the chamber for a moment. With their eyes locked, the two were stunned into a silence that seemed both weighted and fragile.
Unzipping his jeans, pushing them down to the floor and releasing his member from his underwear, John flipped Sherlock upright, facing Sherlock towards himself and giving him a passionate, delving kiss.
Suddenly, the prison door was wrenched open and two more house hold objects, a coat hanger and a chair, came out of the shadows and prop up his father, holding his protesting body against the back of the chair.
“All right love, drink your spot of tea and tell me what you’re doing running around the palace at this time of night?” Mrs. Hudson appeased, hopping to stand near Sherlock, the heat from her kettle warming him in the drafty open space.
Worse still, when he realized the sleeve to his jacket was on fire.
Sherlock corrected himself with a sigh, his internal voice beginning to sound an awful lot like a certain army-doctor.
The palace was surrounded with ancient willow trees and sprawling green fields; the nature beauty of the grey structure was starling, and John felt her chest pounding as they rode towards the intimidating edifice. It was a remarkable piece of architecture, and John had never seen such a sight, gulping when Lestrade shot her a “you see?” look, raising his eyebrows.
Finally, Sherlock sighed, lifting her head up and meeting grey, changeable eyes in the mirror.
“Princess?” A soft, muffled voice asked through the door, “May I enter?”
Well, that just wont do, John decided with a determined nod.
“We have to dance, look natural. It’s a waltz. I’ll lead,” Sherlock murmured, his low tones sending a shiver down John’s spine and he stood straighter in his dress uniform. The music began, and after three counts, the two of them beginning to glide.
John smirked at the request.
If he could learn to love another,
John’s cock gave a twitch at that, and he shook his head, rolling his eyes at his apparently insurmountable arousal where Sherlock was concerned.
Ignoring the people murmuring around them, Sherlock turned to John with a small smirk, “well, John, how does it feel to be officially out of the closet?”
There were days he didn’t understand why John was so infatuated with him and his body, looking at the too skinny flesh in front of him; the slight concave of his stomach and his ribs poking through the light covering of muscle on his chest and abdomen. He ran his hands up and down his torso with a creased brow, but after a moment, he turned away.
In a word, she was enchanting.
John felt at peace, but also untethered. He was raised in an old-fashioned home. He went to church, got good grades, dated pretty girls and went to college.
Sherlock stood and began to walk towards the entrance before a hand tugging her wrist halted her.
“You-“ Sherlock choked on a sob, “you didn’t even let me say goodbye.”
John smiled at him, his eyes gleaming, and he leaned forward to kiss Sherlock languidly, sending a shockwave up his spine.
John met Michael at the coffee shop around the corner from the surgery after freshening up, and saw the young man clutching a coffee in his two hands. He appeared to be extremely nervous, if his fiddling with the coffee lid was any indication.
arse.
John took the suggestion, rocked on his feet for a few moments with a ridiculous grin on his face, and pounced.
Sherlock gazed up at John after a moment, tears glistening in his virescent eyes, “I don’t want to leave you.”
Penniless and without his mother to guide him, Sherlock fell into despair, but he never lost hope that one day he would travel and see the world.
Looking over to Sherlock, who was still sleeping innocently, John felt a rush of daring and thrust a newly human hand down the front of his trousers, moaning quietly at the feel of his bare cock after all the years of the appendage being covered in fur.
I know I have a pair somewhere, John thought as he rifled in his closet, finding an old duffle bag and flicking it open, finding the unopened package he had always wanted to use, but none of his old girlfriends had been up for it.
Sherlock tried to hold himself still, but quickly lost his internal battle when John quickly singled out his prostate and began thrusting against it with each pass of his finger in and out, the rubber an insufferably barrier between Sherlock’s skin and John’s, the impersonal finger moving in and out, finally driving Sherlock to need more, faster, harder-
It was terrifying in its beauty, and indicative of the time of turmoil in their realm.
The sounds reverberated off the walls of their sitting room, and Sherlock prayed to a deity he didn’t believe in that John had at least locked the door. He wouldn't be able to within stand it if Mrs. Hudson or worse,
The prince. Why was he important? Why would his picture be destroyed?
John held his breath, feeling unaccountably nervous but knowing that Sherlock, usually uninterested in John’s dating habits due to his own apathy, would not likely be homophobic, or biphobic as it were.
Sonnet 18: Shakespeare, my beloved bisexual….. Need I say more?
Mycroft realized where this was headed, and reached for his father, but two members of Moriarty’s network had already grabbed him, and were dragging him out of the mud, throwing him on the cold, wet ground.
Leaning down to John’s ear, Sherlock whispered, “you’re always so strong, let go John.
He hissed as the hot water burned the wound, and he expressed his displeasure, “stop that! It hurts.” John grabbed his arm and lifted it to his arm to wash it with his tongue, his animalistic instincts coming to the forefront.
‘Oh, no, I broke him’ John agonized internally, beginning to rethink this idea to confess to Sherlock as the detective continued to stare at him in silence, not a single facial expression giving himself away.
No, he was
John sighed, leaning back and throwing his arms over the sides of the tub, closing his eyes in blissful satisfaction as his muscles relaxed.
“John, please,” Sherlock beseeched, and John met his eyes with a tender smile gracing his features, his eyes crinkled in delight as he continued undressing Sherlock, unzipping the blank trousers carefully and pulling them down in one hasty movement, reveling in Sherlock’s keen as his cock was freed.
Without another word, John grabbed the bowl of melting ice cubes and placed them on the bed, pushing Sherlock down with a strong, firm hand between his shoulder blades and watching the young man acquiesce with a huff, lowering himself back down on the white bed and stretching himself out lazily like a cat.
Still, the urge to relief his frenzied body was tempting. Just by moving his foot slightly and nudging his bum just a little to the right-
Sherlock shook his head and laughed in delight, of course! How could he have missed the clues?
that had passed the man’s lips right before he kissed Sherlock's hand and the resulting arousal when he was awakened.
So she finally found the frog’s eyes under the bed, then.
As she rubbed her face, her left shoulder gave a twinge. What a day.
Rolling over, John lined his cock up with Sherlock hole, nudging at it lightly; his lubricated head meeting with Sherlock wet, slightly opened entrance, the two slick entities rubbing against one another.
“So, you are planning to stay for a while, I'm surprised Thrymn is giving you a chance despite his distrust of women,” Sherlock observed, turning around and walking back to her wardrobe to hide her flushing cheeks.
John removed his mouth with a teasing peck, reaching to open the lube, setting it on the ground beside him and reaching for Sherlock’s hips, pulling him easily to the edge of the bed and ignoring his indignant call at being manhandled, “
“You’re completely at my mercy like this, my beautiful boy,” he reminded Sherlock, his eyes shining with dark promise as he began to thrust even harder, his length seeming to split Sherlock in two with the length delving into his most private place. Sherlock felt completely exposed, John fucking him still in his jumper and through his underwear; Sherlock, naked and panting, pink from rapid blood flow in his arms.
“J-John, please,
The ballroom had been cleaned for the occasion, and every chandelier was lit with gleaming candles that made the golden detailing and angelic artwork all the more visible. It also made Sherlock look that much more ethereal.
Oh. Oh, no. It couldn't be…
Seven o’clock came quickly; Sherlock was sitting on his bed twiddling and wringing his hands after finishing donning on his tux, waiting for John to come downstairs so they could leave for the gala.
John grinned at the kind young man sitting across from him, “thank you, Michael, but I am quite happy here. I work as a GP now and occasionally help New Scotland Yard solve cases with my flatmate.”
- a bulge forming at the front of his trousers. He reached out to touch the statue, trailing his hand gently down the statue's torso and ending just before reaching the cock, letting his graceful hand trail away and fall back at his side.
Sherlock leaned off with a pop for a moment before whispering in a low, velvety voice, “
Reluctantly, Sherlock pulled away from John.
“Anything?” John hummed, pretending to think about it while his mouth quirked into a naughty grin, “well then, since you’ll do
Sherlock’s hand wrapping around his cock as he panted into John’s ear, his hands tracing John’s nipples with dexterous precision, Sherlock impaled on his cock, squirming on it and moaning unabashedly from the sensations while beginning to rock back and forth,
A beat of silence passed between them, their mutual nervousness palpable.
Rolling her eyes at nothing, Sherlock sat up and wandered over to her microscope to complete her bacteria-culture experiment from this morning.
Exiting the cab, John was slightly overwhelmed by the apparent size of the gala. It was being held at the London Museum of Art, and reporters were lining the curving stairs, cameras flickering constantly like strobe lights as finely dressed women and men, England’s elite, entered the fundraiser.
“Nothing,” John coughed, self-consciously, giving the haunting statue one last glance before hurrying down the hallway to catch up to Lestrade. As she walked, she tried to shake the young woman from her mind, but nagging curiosity left her to wonder: what might the color of her eyes be? What color would those curls be in the sunlight? What color is the unblemished skin?
With a swift move, Sherlock flipped them over so John was beneath him. Sherlock flushed at the memories of John beneath him which usually involved him writhing on top of his prick and moaning loudly, but tonight, tonight was going to be different. They had never tried this way, but Sherlock was confident that it was what John secretly wanted tonight, but it was also something a man such as John would never ask for.
No, Sherlock was always more than
“So sweet, there is nothing to be afraid of, my darling. I am right here,” John voiced gently, as if understanding Sherlock’s previous fear, and Sherlock felt relief filling his heart as John spoke out his fears and laid them to rest for the moment.
John watch this scene in complete amazement before releasing a chuckle and a fond eye roll at the ridiculousness of his detective, before going back out to clean up from their sensual date.
John thought with a jolt of awareness, his eyes flying open to look into the pair of stormy blue and green eyes staring right back at him, unflinchingly.
“Ohh, ahhh, J-John,
The two men stared each other down, John channeling his inner hedonist and wishing for nothing more than to lie in bed all day, introducing Sherlock to any number of erotic activities.
“Oh John,” Mrs. Hudson broke first, running forward at a speed impressive for someone her age and enveloping the blonde man in a tight hug, squeezing a laugh out of him as he hugged back, kissing her cheek fondly as she positively squealed in happiness.
faster, harder!” John demanded, but Sherlock shook his head with a smile, despite his desperate need to bury himself in John’s wet heat and never leave, he knew that John needed this, to truly let go.
A roar cut off Siger’s shaking apology from the creature, and Siger was suddenly lifted up by the back of his cloak and was dragged, choking, towards the doors of the imposing castle.
“No… Not really,” John remarked blandly, watching as Sherlock’s expression grew tenser as he deduced John’s next words, “I can’t come along today, Sherlock, I have a shift at the surgery,” John explained cautiously, watching Sherlock’s enthusiasm dim slightly at the prospect of John’s unavailability.
“Yes, Sherlock, for one,” she said, “but also to show your involvement in the kingdom when the king meets with foreign dignitaries and commoners- you’re such a recluse that very few people know what you look like. You are more than just a girl, you’re a symbol for the realm of feminine beauty and poise-“ Mrs. Hudson cut off as Sherlock rolled her eyes and shot a highly unflattering hand signal to her nanny of more than twenty years.
On his way home, Sherlock was biting his lip anxiously, unknowing how he was going to hide the purchases from John. And what if the army doctor didn’t like them? What if he thought Sherlock looked ridiculous?
Wriggling his tongue into the tight channel laying before him like a meal before a starving man, John relentlessly pleasured Sherlock, sucking at the sensitive rim and refusing to stop even after Sherlock’s cries died down into oversensitive whines.
The corset was an emerald green, bringing out the green in his eyes as he stared at himself in the large mirror.
Sherlock's head popped up from where he was talking to Rosie in surprise, and was caught with his hand in the cookie jar, quite literally.
Sherlock never,
Sherlock imagined John seeing him in such a garment, which forced his arse out, making it appear even more plump with the forced curve of his back in the steel-boned garment, and he knew John would positively wreck him.
Sherlock groaned and resisted the urge to touch himself, his mind replaying the memory in cruel, unending detail.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered, and felt John’s answering smile against his lips.
“I don't have friends,” Sherlock sneered, pushing open the ornate door and slamming it on John’s concerned expression.
John’s smug smile fell into something softer, more gentle as he witnesses the hardened detective who had faced so much adversity in his life blush like a young person facing affection and intimacy for the first time. Perhaps this is the first time for Sherlock, John pondered as he continued to stroke the cheekbone gently, emboldened by the fact he hadn’t been pushed away and Sherlock was leaning his visage into the quiet affection. John stared at his Cupid's bow lips in fascination, wanting nothing more than to taste, but the older man refrained, realizing that kisses may be startling to Sherlock.
Once the pathway was clear, the beast glanced up blearily to look at Sherlock, staring at the man in confusion for a moment before his eyes rolled back and he passed out, unconscious on the forest floor.
“How do you know?” Sherlock asked, confused at John’s rare insightfulness.
“What…. Ice? Really John, are you going to put me in an ice bath?” Sherlock scoffed, propping himself up on his elbows to roll his eyes at John annoyingly, giving John a peak at Sherlock arousal lying on his abdomen, hard and aching.
No, the beast was not hateful of others; the only person he was hateful towards was…himself.
, Sherlock thought wildly, bracing himself and exiting the bedroom to prepare for the upcoming case.
And then, between one breath and another, between meaningless introductions and platitudes, she flayed John alive- deducing her injury, her station, and her vulnerabilities to a room of strangers, and to her King. And yet….
It was only then that Sherlock realized he was weeping.
He shook himself and his amorous thoughts away, focusing on the dimly lite silhouette of Sherlock on the bed.
Instead of becoming frightened, Sherlock was intrigued by the lack of wildlife, and the sickening twisting of the trees as they continued down the rocky pathway.
So easily controlled by John's voice.
As the despondent beast looked impassively out the window, he viewed the firelight coming from just outside the iron gates, and with his advanced hearing could make out the sound of men shouting.
He was suckling on the head, running his hand up and down the length and brushing his tongue just inside the slit that was leaking white precome into Sherlock’s mouth.
Sherlock panted out, the dual stimulation of John pressing his arousal against the pillows and filling his aching, needy hole causing him to orgasm again, positively soaking the pillow beneath him.
“Come again for me, now,” John demanded, and Sherlock did, his cock shooting against his abdomen, some reaching his neck, settling there and dripping down Sherlock pale, elegant throat as John watched with throbbing arousal.
"Shh, we shouldn't wake the poor dear, he's had a fright."
Fingering was nothing new for the two men, but John took his time, rubbing and circling one, two,
It was far too late.
One finger, then two, and then three- stretching, nudging, seeking. All went questing in Sherlock arse, drawing in slowly and withdrawing too soon, leaving the young detective feeling quite unsatisfied and frustrated under the capable hands of his controlling lover. His arousal was a constant thrumming in his abdomen, and no amount of wiggling allowed him any relief.
John rolled off of Sherlock and disposed of the condom, wiping them both off gently, and then laid back down, gathering the still panting detective up in his arms, their legs winding together, the bedroom still lingering with the smell of sex and arousal in the air as their heartbeats slowed.
John replied by pulling out almost completely and pushing slowly back in, making sure to graze Sherlock’s sweet spot the entire time and reveling in his moans and attempts to squirm away.
“They want to harm John, and I know the three of us will not willingly let that happen. I say we boil water, as much as we can, and when they enter the foyer, we wait for them to stop just under the balcony and then let them have it!” Mrs. Hudson suggested, and Lestrade and Molly agreed, filling their largest pots with water and then boiling them on the fire stove.
“The man murdered his wife, but we have no record of him returning home from his business trip in Scotland. He never got on the train.” Lestrade explained with a weary sigh, and Sherlock observed the room in silence for a moment before walking over to the woman’s body, leaning down to inspect her wedding ring.
Sherlock promised inwardly, clutching John tighter.
“John, I-I feel-“
"Then you must go," John said, avoiding Sherlock's eyes when they glanced upwards to meet his own, turning away to stare at the dying enchanted rose. Sherlock stood still as a statue, and they both watched another petal fall.
“Sherlock, come over here” John beckoned to the couch, turning without another word to sit on the aforementioned furniture and attempting to draw up his remaining courage for this dreaded conversation.
Sentiment, John smiled to himself, was not always unwelcome.
John knew that it was his fault that Sherlock had run, he had clawed at him, roared his displeasure and given the young man the fright of his life, from the alarm gracing his delicate features and the speed at which he ran from John's rooms once he saw an opening.
“I mean, have dinner with me. With music, and dancing,” John elaborated, and watched the realization dawn on Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock shot up like a flash, darting past John to grab his coat and practically throwing himself down the stairs, ignoring John’s confused call, “Sherlock, wait!”
John lined up once again, not allowing Sherlock but a moment, and began to push his now throbbing arousal back into Sherlock. Sherlock’s eyes, droopy from his three subsequent orgasms, widened when he felt John’s throbbing manhood entering him once again.
He was beginning to text his associate before remembering, John had work. He had expressly told Sherlock to stop bothering him while he was at the surgery, because they needed the money to pay bills.
John greeted him with a smile when Sherlock sat down at the kitchen island, placing a plate of toast and bacon in front of him. Sherlock picked up the dry toast with a grumble, until John handed him some of his favorite honey from Tesco.
John was busy reading in the library, a medical text that held his interest. He had at one point considered becoming a healer if he had not gone into the army, when he still had a penchant for helping others before he became too self-involved. John shook those thoughts away with a grimace, thinking about his past was not a past-time he wished to partake in.
, rocking forward until his sharp hips met John’s soft backside and then again.
Sherlock was still staring at the floor, adjusting himself and breathing shallowly, when John entered the room, clearing his throat.
One two three
The maternal voice was coming from just over the side of the bed, and as Sherlock blearily scoots over and looked, he saw a pink and white ceramic teapot smiling up at him as if this was the most normal interaction in the world.
John and Sherlock cleaned up from their adventure in the living room, and Sherlock redressed swiftly, coughing lightly at John’s quirked eyebrow and walking over to his violin, picking it up and beginning to play. He didn’t want to sit on his tender backside quite yet.
As soon as Sherlock’s breathing started to come faster, indicating his upcoming release, John formed a tight ring around the base of his cock with his thumb and forefinger, smiling slightly at Sherlock petulant whine.
King’s Guard no less,” she spat.
“Well, it concerns you, so it is my place, actually,” John retorted, her chin lifting to meet Sherlock’s grey eyes in the dim light. Sherlock watched John’s eyes flicker down briefly before they resolutely met her eye line once again.
Standing there in his pants, he grinned when he saw Sherlock staring at his bulge with wide eyes, “not tonight love. Here, let me get you your pajamas.”
Hello all! I am terribly sorry to have kept you all waiting- life had been hectic between finishing exams, working full time, and some personal difficulties. I'm happy to say I am back and continuing to write this fic, as I have many more ideas and chapters to come. I hope you enjoy this short but sweet interlude. I assure you it will not be the last.
John watched Sherlock’s shy eyes look away, and stare out the window. John allowed Sherlock to look away, realizing how difficult laying out these desires would be to a man as private and suppressed as Sherlock was.
John had lit candles around the room, giving it a breathtaking glow in the London’s twilight. The scene was hopelessly romantic, and caused Sherlock’s heart to skip a beat. John was doing this all for him, he realized with a tender smile, which faded into confusion once again.
The two men chatted for a while, about how Michael was enjoying nursing at the surgery, and how long flu season seemed to be lasting.
“I know, Sherlock, but there is nothing wrong with inexperience. You’re doing wonderfully and even if you weren’t, it wouldn’t matter,” John said, smoothing back Sherlock’s curls and pressing her body to Sherlock’s, gently smoothing down Sherlock’s covered sides.
“So, would you like to dance?” Moriarty asked perfectly politely, and Sherlock steeled herself for the inevitably answer.
“Let’s take it once more,” John said, and ignored Sherlock whine as he slowly inserted the long, glass rod back into Sherlock’s bottom, leaving just the tip peaking out between Sherlock’s ripe bottom.
Warning: sexual assault mentioned
,” Sherlock begged as John began to stroke around Sherlock’s prostate in deft movements, his cock flushed a deep pink against his heaving abdomen, his dark chestnut curls falling around the pillow like a fallen renaissance angel.
After all, what was done is done. John is her bodyguard and that was that. And now, thanks the Sherlock’s outburst, they wouldn't be friends. Being alone was what she could count on- that way, she would never be disappointed.
John walked over to the bed, throwing his clothes down and began stripping, unbuckling his pants and shoving them down, standing in only his undergarments. Sherlock watched this with wide eyes, taking in John's strong thighs and his battle scar on his shoulder for the first time, seeing his love mainly naked was disconcerting and arousing in equal measure to the inexperienced young man, and just like with the statues, he longed to reach out and touch the golden skin. John looked up, and seeing Sherlock staring at him, seemingly frozen with his fingers twitching, and he winked teasingly.
John smiled at the adorable shyness of his moody detective, and began to gently nip at his plush lower lip, seeking access to his mouth by stroking his tongue across the seem until Sherlock’s mouth opened with a gasp. The kiss became heated quickly, as John grasped the detective’s face in his strong hands and took control of the kiss, backing Sherlock up until he was flush with the door, moaning lightly into John’s mouth, as John tasted the sweetness of too sugary tea on his tongue. John moved his hands up Sherlock's face and into his curls, lightly tugging at the silky strands like he had always dreamed of, basking in the sweet sighs coming from the younger man against the door.
He settled his backside on his lap and chuckled lightly at Sherlock little whimper of pain, his shirt covering his bits. Somehow Sherlock half clothed, sitting in John's lap freshly spanked was unbearably erotic, and John had to take a few deep breathes to calm his roaring arousal.
“Of course I did, I love you,” Sherlock pronounced decidedly, stating a fact, but his eyes were tearing up once again, looking into the soft blue eyes and small grin on John’s face, and realizing he would never be without him again.
Ashamed of his monstrous form,
No one in their village ever wandered off the path due to the dangers that were rumored to lurk in the forest, and while Sherlock had often dismissed these claims as idiotic, he was suddenly taken by uneasiness about his person.
“Do you realize what you could’ve done?” The beast roared again, shaking the very floor they stood upon, and Sherlock raised himself on shaky legs to escape from the volatile creature.
Privacy was a luxury that royals did not have, so Sherlock quickly stood almost nude as the servants finished preparations for her bath while tapping her foot impatiently.
Sherlock looked at her with a questioning gaze, and his father laughed, leaning over to place a kiss on his beloved son’s forehead, “your mother simply means that your inner beauty is far more precious and important. Don’t let the jealousy of other’s take that away.”
“The master told me you must go to your father,” she announced gently, and Sherlock nodded, the words clogged in his throat.
“Sherlock, for a late 21st birthday present, your brother ordered you new clothing from your favorite tailor. It should be here by next week, and it has new fabrics, which you should enjoy-“
“Right here,” John voiced echoed from behind Sherlock, causing the detective to gasp and turn around quickly, forgetting about his predicament and gasping in response to the quick movement over his prostate.
Sherlock ignored the pang in her chest at the thought of John dating yet another vapid man, and turned to confront her, seeing the doctor holding out a cup of tea for Sherlock to take and wearing one of her beautiful smiles that lit up the flat.
John breached his untried hole, and Sherlock was bombarded with sensation as he greedily rocked his hips down, ignoring the slight flair of pain in favor of the gush of pleasure throughout his lean body, his cock hardening further as he breathlessly allowed John to enter him, gravity working him down onto John's cock, as if John was some sort of sinful chair for Sherlock to sit on, and Sherlock's mind unhelpfully suggested that Sherlock never sit anywhere else if this was the feeling that John reaped from his untried body everytime.
As Sherlock was lost in his musings, the older man turned to look at him for the first time since they left the crime scene. Sherlock gasped at the hardness reflected in those blue eyes, normally so soft. He shivered in expectation of what was to come, despite the fact he was completely out of his depth.
Sherlock didn’t really masturbate, only when the need was unbearable and he needed deal with his transport, but in truth it was rare. Now, Sherlock felt pleasure building already just from the tantalizing and sinful thoughts racing through his mind of what he could do with the items laid to the left of him. Trailing a hand down his body, he gently grasped his manhood, stroking slowly over the shaft for a moment, bringing himself to full hardness faster than he ever had in the past, his fingers teasing up and down.
“Yes, and you came back for me,” John said back, his voice wavering slightly.
“Why should I help you? I’m not the king, that would be you, remember?” Sherlock hissed, also keeping a passive expression on her face as they neared the bottom of the staircase.
John decided a lie in was in order for himself and the younger man whose eyes were dropping tiredly, so he sat back on the bed, opening his arms, and Sherlock quickly curled into him, kissing him on the wound on his left shoulder and quickly falling asleep once again. John followed quickly thereafter, the two men sated.
Sherlock’s chest was heaving quickly, but he made no move to stop John, nodding at him when he peered into his eyes questioningly. Sherlock shrugged off the shirt, and tossed it to the side of the bed, allowing John to reach towards his lower half, his bespoke trousers tented in arousal.
She was building speed, and as she continued her cheeks flushed with anger until she was standing two feet away from John; John stood her ground and her gaze did not waver from the furious princess. Do not back down, do not show weakness.
John spanked him again and Sherlock smiled secretly to himself as he laid his head against the bed to hide his blushing cheeks and devious smile; after all, he finally earned John's attention.
,” Sherlock pleaded as John began to spank down rapidly, his arse swelling and glowing red in the candlelight room.
One day after his imprisonment, after being taken away from his father, and he was playing happily with John’s pseudo-daughter while becoming friendly with his staff and, if he is being honest, the only people who every truly loved him, despite how cruel he was to them.
Paraphrased Arthur Conan Doyle quote from the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
Sherlock’s genius could occasionally be overwhelming to the young man, so he used the mind memory technique to sort out his thoughts and memories and then store them away. He can close and open the doors, or memories, at will.
“Get off of me, you idiot,” Grey growled out, and John watched impassively as Sherlock’s eyes narrowed.
Sherlock was walking up the dirt pathway home, still mulling over his encounter with Moriarty, when he saw Philip running towards the stables in a panic. Shocked, Sherlock dropped the errands and ran over to the horse.
John scanned Sherlock’s nude body hungrily, licking his lips in want, “so is this the new normal then?” He asked, watching Sherlock whip around to face him and running his eyes up and down his bare chest and his bits.
“It isn’t the tea, you cock, its you drinking it. Blowing on it and swallowing it down with a moan just like you do with my-“
After a moment, staring at the exhausted and sweet expression of his sleeping detective, John went over to the dresser, taking out a new pair of underwear and gently sliding down the ruined pair from Sherlock’s lithe body.
What he found, however, caused a wicked grin to grace his features.
“I’m not even qualified to be on the King’s Guard, Lestrade. In case you forgot, I’m not a man,” John said, rolling her eyes at the ludicrous law that only men could be admitted into the Guard. When she joined the army she was accepted, unwillingly, because they needed soldiers. Desperately. But the King’s Guard are an elite group of men who are fighters, soldiers and knights at the top of their skillset.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson, these look delightful,” John said with a smile, having recovered his manners in an instant.
Sherlock gasped out, feeling the unrelenting rub of the plug on his sweet spot and unable to stop his guttural moan, causing Lestrade and several officers to peer at Sherlock strangely and with varying degrees of trepidation. Sherlock bit his lip and flushed deeply in mortification.
He hoped that Mycroft hadn’t hidden any new cameras in the flat.
Sherlock then pulled John forward; holding him as he gently laid him on the ground of the balcony, taking off his cloak to create a makeshift pillow for John’s head.
Deciding he would marvel at the mechanics later, his need becoming aching, he gently moved the buzzing object down with a delighted shiver, rubbing it up and down between his fleshy cheeks with a moan at the erotic tickling sensations. Finally, unable to keep his wet, worked open entrance unfilled any longer, Sherlock slid the blue vibrator into his aching entrance, up,
“That
“I’m not human?” The creature finished with a low growl, and Siger nodded in complete terror, frozen on the spot, still holding the rose.
John motioned for Sherlock to get up, and he did, standing before John and rubbing his arse like a scolded toddler, pout and all, his cock standing out and pointing at John’s face.
Until all there was left was the destitute ridden members of Iris, a once proud city, brought low by the failure of its protectors and the contemptible Valwald soldiers.
John watched Sherlock shadow behind the screen unbutton his shirt in a demure fashion, and he smirked, laying back and watching the slightly obscured strip show with his erection laying high against his black trousers in anticipation for his innocent Sherlock. John palmed slightly at his erection, biting his lip to keep from actually stroking his manhood.
“Good boy, Sherlock,” John whispered, biting back a smile as Sherlock bit his lip and glanced away shyly at the reminder towards his proclivity for praise.
John whispered to himself,
Sherlock giggled at the sudden picture of the beast wearing an oatmeal jumper that appeared in his mind's eye, and John joined in, until both men were laughing uproariously at the situation they now found themselves in.
"J-John, sir, please, I'll do anything,
"G-Green," Sherlock moaned in response, and with a grin, John attached the opposite clamp to his left nipple, swallowing up his gasping whimper with a kiss. After giving him a moment to adjust, John looked down and stepped away, gazing at the erotic sight in front of him and trying to remember how to breathe.
Next, Mrs. Hudson hopped over to the wardrobe, instructing Sherlock to follow. Sherlock grabbed a dressing down and followed the teapot into his bedroom, which had become far more comfortable in the past few months since his moving.
“I love you, Sherlock,” John whispered ardently, his hips rolling in complete motions, displaying his self control while Sherlock writhes on the sheets beneath him, trying to escape the overwhelming sensations and meet them at the same time.
John gaped for a moment in complete surprise before Sherlock swallowed him down again, reaching to place John’s hands on the back of his head and bobbing up and down.
Sherlock saw a flash of scanty lace in her hand, and felt a rosiness growing on his cheeks, cursing his pale skin when she turned around and cooed at his obvious embarrassment.
“I-“ many reasons to say no flew through Sherlock’s mind, but, for the first time, her bodily instincts took over and she found herself nodding before she had made the conscious choice to agree.
“What are you up to, Sherlock?” John asked, watching Sherlock’s wide eyes and innocent expression with a growing look of confusion.
“Have coffee with me?” John asked with a hint of a command, his eyes never leaving Michael’s face, who blinked in confusion before the words registered, and he smiled shyly once more and looked down, fiddling with the folders he was holding for a moment and nodding.
Sherlock, as usual, proved to be a distraction however, with his curls falling in his eyes and an absent-minded hand pushing the curls away as he sorted the texts, his lean muscles flexing as he moved the heavy tomes back and forth across the library, and his joyful expression when he discovered a new novel to read about bees.
at the thought of Sherlock finding these panties and wearing them, for John. He never wanted Sherlock to take them off. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s back, pulling him back into his arms and smiling delightedly as he watched his lower cheeks jiggle at the movement.
Perhaps a battle
Sherlock would giggle at her older brother’s description of normal children and would run off alone to play with the earthworms in the garden.
Sherlock had never felt desire, even when faced with romantic interest thrown his way, but here, in this castle where everything was new and exciting, Sherlock realized that he had never felt so alive.
A note was sitting on the kitchen table addressed to Sherlock, and he picked it up, a confused expression marring his face for a moment as he took in the impromptu message.
Sherlock raised her changeable eyes again and watched her blonde companion for a moment, watching her lips move-
In a moment of immeasurable desire, John came harder than he had in years, positively erupting, as he laid on his bed, in his newly reclaimed body, picturing his lovely Sherlock bouncing heatedly on his hard prick, moaning like a wanton courtesan, his naked body twisting and contorting to John’s every wish. Sherlock's high moans of pleasure in complete juxtaposition to his usual low, velvety voice as he found pleasure from John and John alone. The possessive nature of his thoughts, apparently not gone now that he was human again, caused a low growl to erupt from John as the final shocks of pleasure faded away.
“Alright, that is just fine, we will have you out in just a mo’. If you could remove your gown and lay torso down on the bed, I’ll take your temperature,” John said, walking over to the sterilized instruments laying on the table and glancing back to Sherlock.
No, he didn't want to get up either. Not quite yet.
Sherlock inhaled and exhaled slowly, fixing her ruby lipstick in the mirror one last time and, with a deep sigh, reached back to unclip her hair, letting her auburn curls fall down around her shoulders and shivering at the freeing sensation, running her long fingers through the curls to tame them.
“No, go into town, to the tavern, and try to find Mycroft. I will send word as soon as I can,” Sherlock announced, his father following him to the stables.
Beautiful, simply stunning, and all mine, John thought to himself as he lovingly reached a hand up to fiddle with the silky strings of the corset and listening to Sherlock’s begs for release.
“Ohhhh,
He upturned Sherlock as he sat down, forcing the younger man over his lap in the next moment, Sherlock’s head resting on the couch and his legs dangled to the side of John’s lap limply.
John felt a slight stinging behind his eyes at what Sherlock was entrusting him with, but he blinked them away, focusing on the younger man wiggling underneath him in impatient arousal.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at his droll sister’s priorities
“Yes, John.” He said quietly, moving his hand down John’s arm to grasp his smaller hand and hold it tightly in a vice grip. John squeezed back reassuringly;
“Sherlock,” John murmured through clenched teeth, trying to regain control, “stop moving for a moment.”
Sherlock held out for a moment longer, until his aching arousal could stand it no longer, him mind fraying from the pulsations echoing from his groin and lingering from his well-used arse.
Darting away before he could hear Lestrade’s indignant reply, Sherlock was racing down the stairs with John at his heels. The two men split up briefly with nods of understanding, going in opposite directions around the massive building, but by the time they met up on the other side, the murder was nowhere to be seen.
Sherlock wished, just once, John might go along with it, allow a person to believe someone like Sherlock, someone odd,
Sherlock made to get up, practically bouncing with excitement that he normally reserved for a particularly interesting double-homicide, until he was reminded of one little detail.
Leaning a hand forward, he released the right clamp, quickly leaning down to latch onto the abused nipple and sucking it gently to sooth the lingering pinch.
From no other stimulation than John talking, and a
But on the other side was a young man, at least ten years younger than John- now in his mid thirties- who was blinking at him owlishly.
After receiving no response from the detective, who had his eyes closed and was refusing to acknowledge his lover, John grinned wider and began to tickle lightly up his abdomen with his fingertips, causing the detective's eyes to fly open and a little hiccuping laugh to escape his mouth.
“Well darling, as you know, there is a ball tonight to raise Fairlyn’s spirits during this dark time, and you simply must attend. There will be many eligible suitor’s for you to choose from- after all, we must get you married before the bloom has quite gone off the rose,” Mrs. Hudson clucked to herself as she pulled out three massive ball gowns.
Ruffling under the bed for a moment, he emerged with two red silk ties.
John’s brought one arm up, tickling at Sherlock’s inner thigh for a moment, causing Sherlock to gasp from the warring sensations of pleasure and the ridiculous impulse giggle.
But… Then why was he naked?
John, usually not body conscious, felt oddly exposed lying there, allowing Sherlock to take control and look at him, his eyes always expressing his complete adoration that John was not sure he deserved after all his sins.
Sherlock Holmes, embarrassed?
Gooseflesh had risen on his pale body, and his cheeks suffused with color as John continued to pace towards him in his usual unremarkable manner, wearing a hideous cream jumper.
I simply adore this view, love,” John commented lightly, patting him on the bum while his blue eyes sparkled with mischief as he poured lube onto his thick fingers, rubbing them together to warm the slippery liquid before beginning to nudge just against Sherlock’s exposed pucker.
John wants him to….
Mrs. Hudson reminded Sherlock to be out of the bath within a half an hour when she returned to help her dress, and Sherlock grunted in reply.
In the doorway, each with tears in their eyes, Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade and Molly stood vigil, watching the young man mourn for his beast as the last rose petal fell to the ground.
“Your highness, Mrs. Hudson asked for me to check on you and make sure you, um, washed your hair as she instructed…” John’s voice trailed off with an awkward cough.
The scent of jasmine filled the room and she felt the curls at the nape of her neck wetly pressing against her skin.
People don’t just destroy things ideally; destruction was fueled by deep emotion, usually hatred. Why would the beast hate the prince…?
John walked over to his desk to gather up the assorted documents he had just finished up, walking back over and handing the stack to the young man, feeling a little hum in his stomach when the boy met his eyes and looked away, a slight rosiness on his pale cheeks.
“J-John,
“No,” Sherlock cried in defiance, fighting to escape John’s grasp, breaking away from John’s tight grasp and beginning to race back to the bedroom. But John caught his arm, pulling him back and turning him to face the army doctor, who had a warning written in his blue eyes.
Tugging lightly at the string hanging between Sherlock’s opened cheeks, John closed his eyes to savor the sweet moans coming from his beautiful detective.
"There, better?" She asked teasingly, her bare breasts touching the sheer paneling of Sherlock's lingerie. Sherlock panted harshly and looked down, seeing the beautiful bare breasts for her perusal and moved her hand down to touch.
the green panties made him smolder. As well as the unparalleled feeling of entering Sherlock, his greedy arse ready and willing for John’s cock from the first penetration…
“There, are we feeling better now?” John asked in a low rumble, and Sherlock nodded, tilting his face to hide in John’s oatmeal jumper covered chest. John chuckled and kissed the top of his head, “I love you Sherlock, and there will never be anyone else. This is where we belong, the two of us here at Baker Street.”
“I-I don't just want to
“Hold on a moment, Sherlock,” John commanded, and raced up to his bedroom.
Sherlock felt one finger coated in lube, then two, invading his body and he shuddered at the familiar pleasure filled sensations shivering up his spine. His toes curled against the carpet as he thrust back lightly onto John’s thick digits stretching his hole.
"J-John,
A sacrifice a soldier would have made.
John knew he didn’t want to overwhelm his lover with his, occasionally inexhaustible, libido; but now that John had taken Sherlock fully, well….
“Sherlock” his mother would smile while brushing away his tears and turning his face towards hers gently, “many people are jealous of your outer beauty, but many more will be jealous of your inner beauty.”
John grunted as Sherlock moved his own torn cloak away from his side to analyze his wound. Sherlock realized the cut was deep at would have hit some of his internal organs due to the size and depth of the entrance wound.
Encouraging his horse to move closer to the dreary gates and castle, Siger spotted a beautiful white gazebo just beyond the doors of the castle, maybe a hundred yards ahead. The gazebo did not fit the architecture of the gloomy and Gothic castle, but rather stood out as a snowflake against a grey sky. Squinting his eyes to get a clearer look, the enclosure appeared to have plants of some kind.
Sherlock nodded gently, and John’s eyes softened at the vulnerable affection shining in Sherlock’s eyes.
Moriarty had thrust his recovered sword into John’s side. It was already darkening his cloak with blood.
John was right of course, she was always right. Since that night, she and Sherlock had been slowly advancing their romantic relationship with slow touches and soft, chaste kisses, as Sherlock was new to the process and John had never dated a woman before.
, but John held him fast, the water sloshing around them in gentle waves.
John looked at Sherlock, who was quiet now, most likely tired from the emotional display and the subsequent discussion, and John knew he needed some time to rest before John started laying out boundaries for their new relationship.
“Thank you Father” he said in his usual pompous tone, and Sherlock snorted, earning him a glare. Before uttering another word, Mycroft and Katherine strode off towards the house, basking in their new presents and leaving Siger and Sherlock alone at the gate in the chill of the oncoming winter.
Sherlock, in a thoughtless move, raced over the began beating the wolves from the beast’s back and sides, but the wolves simply tore further at Sherlock’s clothing in annoyance and went back to attacking the beast.
Sherlock was running errands in Sussex, their family needing eggs and some bread. The maid volunteered to go, but Sherlock claimed the need for a bit of exercise and went in her stead. Truly, Sherlock needed time away from his prying brother and sister. They were so wrapped up in material goods that they never appreciated anything, and Sherlock felt smothered by their incessant whining.
Sherlock looked over with a smile, “and you invaded Afghanistan.”
Shaking his head, Sherlock tried to clear his thoughts and focus:
The cold night air nipped at the bare skin of people who lived in the area as they went about their wares, numb to the cold and continuing on with their day-to-day lives, a stoic, hardened manner about their persons.
“Yes, this is Lestrade- wait- what? How-“ Lestrade looked at Sherlock’s knowing grin and sighed, “yes, I’m bringing the team over. Did you happen to find the Belington Rose? Yes, alright, ta very much,” he clicked off the phone and dropped it back in his pocket with a sigh.
“Sherlock” John began, “I brought you here because its been one year since we met, and moved in and started solving crimes.” Sherlock continued looking out the window in perceived disinterest, but John knew he was analyzing every word and gesture John made.
He felt his arousal tenting his pants and groaned lowly, banging his head against his wardrobe.
Sherlock chuckled, stepping forward and beginning to walk towards the dining room side by side with the best, “That’s one way to put it.”
“No,” John answered, kissing down Sherlock’s abdomen and ignoring Sherlock’s huff of annoyance, “We are going to take our time, because it is our first time, and I want it to be special. For both of us,” John explained, and Sherlock watched him closely for a moment before nodding in agreement, his head flopping back on the pillow and motioning for John to carry on.
“Sherlock, what do you think you’re doing running off like that?” Lestrade scolded him like he would a child, sounding to be at the end of his rope with the consulting detective, until Sherlock looked up at him from his hiding place of John’s neck; his face wet with tears and his eyes still glistening, fear etched into his youthful face.
John started to stroke Sherlock’s cheekbones, cradling his head between John’s calloused palms and holding him tenderly but firmly, “you haven’t wasted anything Sherlock. I want to be with you, in
“Nothing John, honestly, you worry too much,” Sherlock sassed, rolling his eyes as he strode past John in the doorway, taking a deep breathe of his natural scent and felt his heartbeat pickup.
“Oh, J-John please,” Sherlock begged, but John would have none of it, standing up and circling the chair like a lion circles its prey, his eye glittering with dark promise.
And earn their love in return
“John let me go,” he said, taking in his father’s confused expression and correcting himself, “the beast, John. He is nothing like he seemed on that first night. He was-“ Sherlock paused, trying to think of a word to describe his enigmatic friend, his face turning up in a bittersweet expression, “understanding.”
Sherlock raged, “No, no, absolutely not! This is madness, Mrs. Hudson! It is one thing to be confined to my house arrest, and to dress and perform in public as a good, little princess, but I absolutely will not allow-“
Sherlock thought as he stroked around the path of matted hair, but pulled away his hand as if burned once he realized what he was doing.
“That’s enough out of you, young man. You didn’t eat at all yesterday” Mrs. Hudson reprimanded Sherlock, but he just sighed in response.
John disappeared into the bedroom for a moment before emerging with a small purple plug in his hand. Sherlock shuddered in anticipation; perspiration beginning to gather on his lean body while sparks of arousal shot from his groin at the sight of the teasing implement.
“Dinner?” John asked, glancing up to Sherlock who was sitting in his armchair studying bee cultures from Sussex.
Spanking, more orgasms :)
Sherlock slammed the door to 221B behind him, and walked quickly away, trying to stem to prickling in his eyes and the rapid breathing in his chest.
“Use your words, love, yes or no,” John insisted with a tender smile belaying his suggestive words, but Sherlock heeded his command regardless.
, expecting for John to deny what Sherlock had observed, but he stood there, looking at Sherlock with hardness set in his eyes, as if expecting retaliation from
“What do you know of the king?” John asked Lestrade once they were settled down a winding path to the palace. John knew the story- the suddenly orphaned prince who became king at the tender age of fifteen after his parents died in a shipwreck, only to prove to be one of the most politically savvy rulers in the realm. John was curious, having heard rumors from her small village in the western cost that the young king was a cold and unfeeling man.
“Not to me, I’ve never-“ Sherlock stopped, and turned slowly to face John, “I didn’t mean to embarrass myself with you the first time we’ve shared a bed.”
And actually, that gave John quite an idea.
“What’re you….
John’s breathing grew deeper, and Sherlock sucked harder, fitting as much of John’s cock in his mouth as he could and feeling the bitter shot of come trickle down his throat as John stroked his creamy neck.
Sherlock continued muttering over and over, his mind a jumble of contradicting thoughts, and John’s heart ached for his fragile detective and how frightened he seemed to be from this latest brush with death. This was different from their case “A Study in Pink” somehow.
Without conscious thought, Sherlock rolled off of John after a moment and kneeled between his legs, looking up at him with widened eyes.
Sherlock panted out “Green,” against John’s neck, hiding his blushing face there.
John’s lips turned up at the sight, and he leaned forward unthinkingly to kiss Sherlock on the forehead, breathing in his earthy, flowery smell that reminded John of his salvation. As he observed Sherlock closer, he saw a smattering of freckles over his nose, a mole marring his otherwise porcelain neck, and a swell of a little tummy where his shirt had ridden up on his otherwise lithe body. John fell in love with the small bits of proof that his love was human, the most human being he had ever witnessed, and not the genius who was without emotions, but rather the genius who felt emotions too well, who needed someone to protect his heart.
arousing.
It much more rewarding to tease Sherlock and bring out his brilliant blush.
Suckling, nipping, pressing in, the muscle giving way….
The realization of having
And nervousness? Why in the world was John nervous?
The enormous gates were connected to a surrounding wall that stretched as far as John’s eye could see. The granite stones seeming to shine in the glaring afternoon sun as Lestrade and John rode up the winding pathway to the palace stables. Why was such a barrier needed? To keep people out?
John straightened up, watching Sherlock oddly for a moment, unsure of Sherlock’s stilted response but feeling better that his uniform would work for the evening’s investigation.
“I’ll need your statements tomorrow, come by the station after ten in the morning. You two get some rest. Especially you Sherlock,” Lestrade said softly, as if to not further distress the detective, and Sherlock nodded in response.
“I will not,” Sherlock retorted, staring at the beast and feeling triumph at seeing the flicker of confusion run through the beast’s human-like eyes.
Or is it a promise?
The sleepy detective trailed behind, his face stretched in a yawn, and John grinned at the usually manic, unsleeping man being absolutely exhausted.
John truly was a golden prince, his hair and skin glowing in the sunlight streaming through the library windows, his short strands standing up slightly to appear as if a halo was around his head, making his smiling features even more angelic.
Together they went to the tavern in town, and Mycroft curled his lip in disgust at the drunken debauchery surrounding them, women throwing themselves at drunken men, the smell of yeast heady in the air at rain pelted the outside, causing the tavern to be overflowing with people from all walks of life searching to escape the storm.
“Oh, J-John, I didn’t mean to fall asleep,” Sherlock stammered, his voice somewhat laden from sleep, and John watched in fascination as Sherlock began to sit up and fell back on his stomach immediately, gasping at the confining corset around him and at John’s lust-filled stare. Blushing, he glanced down at himself, tracing one long fingered hand down his side with a timid expression donning on his youthful visage.

Then, well, then they would have some fun.
He rushed out, refusing to say any more goodbyes. He found Philip munching on straw in the stables and quickly saddled and mounted the steed, rushing down the cobbled pathway to the enchanted castle, never looking back.
“That was, the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever done,” John panted after a moment with a laugh.
To lie there and accept a spanking passively he could attribute to the stressful day, but this, holding himself open for John’s ravenous gaze and wicked hand to punish him, it was confirming Sherlock’s complete trust in John.
(See the end of the chapter for
Once he was undressed, Sherlock was able to see John’s entire form, unobstructed, in the bright, bathroom lighting.
Lick, suck, kiss, lick in,
What was she even doing here?
To add insult to injury, John looked into her grey eyes, the color of a storm in May, and winked.
So they went off into the London night, the sounds of Londoners passing around the as they walked the few blocks to the restaurant, comfortable in the silence of each other’s company. John bit his lip in nervous anticipation, his hands clenching in his coat as he tried to formulate what he would say to his genius detective. But when John peered over at Sherlock, he saw the man was striding in his normally graceful manner beside John, and the doctor felt a sense of calm rush through him at the sight of his best friend.
“Sixteen, thank you daddy. S-seventeen, thank you d-daddy,
your cunt” John declared in a shocked voice, and Sherlock blushed violently, hiding her face in the crook of John’s neck.
“C’mere love.”
He stared out the window and released an inaudible sigh, knowing that his sentiments were wasted on John, who would never be interested in a man.
Jealous Sherlock and caring John in this chapter, beginning to explore kinks in the next. Pure fluff.
“Go Philip, this way” Sherlock commanded, pulling the reigns to the left and ignoring Philip’s nervous neighing. Searching his surroundings, Sherlock noticed that the farther they ventured into the forest, the darker their surroundings became.
But soon, the Prince became hardened by the sights and sounds of battles waged for land, money, and power,
She was peering at Sherlock with a pleading expression and something else, something darker that Sherlock couldn’t quite identify.
Squaring his shoulders, Sherlock walked forward, seeing the struggle that had taken place in the tracks and smudges in the snow line.
When Sherlock gasped a moment later, his mouth opening, John took it as a delicious invitation and delved into Sherlock’s mouth, licking into him and tasting too sweet tea and a taste that was exclusively Sherlock’s alone. John had just begun to nibble lightly on Sherlock’s full lower lip, when Sherlock let out a moan and clutched himself closer, beginning to be bolder in his kisses back. John grasped the back of Sherlock’s neck, and tilted his head back, allowing John to plunder his mouth with abandon and force Sherlock to surrender control, which he did happily.
took her hair down, almost cutting it all off on a few occasions but her vanity preventing her from losing the luscious tresses she adored.
She leaned back, and took him in, looking beyond him to see Sherlock still lying in their bed, watching them both with a hesitant grin on his face, and then back to John, whose expression was truly as radiant as the sun, “are you happy, John?” She asked, the question redundant due to the obvious truth in his smile, but wanting to hear it from John’s own lips.
“Shh, sweetheart, go to sleep. I know you’re tired,” John whispered into the curly hair, kissing the top of his head and watching the embarrassed flush grace those magnificent cheekbones and trail down that long neck. Sherlock half-heartedly glared and John’s chuckle, and the two men quickly fell into a comfortable, dreamless sleep, wrapped up in one another.
Continue to ravish his attentions on John’s nipples, he trailed his hands down to unbuckle his pants, stopping for a moment to slide off John’s pants and boots, leaving him bare beneath the fully clothed Sherlock.
Giving a shaky breathe and a nod, Sherlock began to trace her fingers up John's pajama pants and up the front of her t-shirt covered torso, frowning at her inability to see barely any of John's skin.
“Color, darling,” John asked.
“Sorry Mrs. H” John called as he herded Sherlock up the stairs, zipping up his pants and winking at Mrs. Hudson who huffed in fond exasperation at her two tenants who reminded her of the sons she never had.
Entering the bedroom, he saw Sherlock asleep, his arms and legs akimbo on top of the duvet and his cum stained undergarments beginning to cool to his skin.
He dropped his phone into his pocket, and grabbed his coat, hurrying down the stairs and hailing a cab, heading to Leinster Gardens and praying he wouldn’t be too late.
"Sh'lock! Papa!" Rosie yelped, jumping down from the table and running to the two men. John lifted her up with a great swing and held her close, pulling Sherlock in as well, cuddling the two most important people in his life. Rosie then laid sloppy kisses on both of their cheeks, much to the men's amusement, before she allowed herself to be let down and resume eating her breakfast.
John stared in confusion for a moment while Sherlock untied his dressing gown, but when he discovered what was underneath, he nearly choked.
At those seemingly innocent words, Sherlock felt a bolt of heat rush down his spine and felt a blossoming of warmth cover the bridge of his nose and cheeks. He slowly lowered himself down onto the floor, his scarlet silk dressing gown fanning out around him as he settled on all fours and began crawling, avoiding John's smirk as he watched the detective out of the corner of his eye.
In the next moment, Sherlock sighed, and John opened his eyes briefly to see Sherlock’s eyes fluttering in pleasure from John’s kisses alone, his cheeks flushed John’s new favorite color; a mix of scarlet and pink rose.
“No, John, we can fight them off,” Mrs. Hudson declared desperately, but John did not respond, he simply stared out the window into the cold spring night, with whispers of flurries falling from the gloomy sky as if foreshadowing the coming events.
Moriarty’s eye’s gleamed as they set eyes on the enchanted castle for the first time, wondering if perhaps once this was over if he could move into the dark palace. With a smirk, he instructed the men to begin chopping down the large oaken doors.
John sat down, the bulge in his pants barely constrained, and looked at Sherlock's form meaningfully. Sherlock blushed in realization.
when she thought Sherlock was away, John made Sherlock want to be a woman.
Finally, as the last maid curtsied to leave with a quiet, “your highness.” Sherlock immediately threw her chemise from over her head and stepped into the hot bath, sighing as she sunk down beneath the steaming water and the foaming soap.
Sherlock shakily retreated to the door, walking slowly and still unable to escape his arousing torment.
John fucking Sherlock in the living room of 221B. Size kink, edging. That's it, that's the plot. I still have room for a few more kinks, suggest below or on Tumblr! Comments/kudos appreciated.
and then make you stand in the corner with your glowing backside on display while I watch some telly.”
"J-John, do you not like this?" Sherlock asked after another moment of silence, taking John's expression to be one of complete shock and eventual disgust. John shook her head, putting down the book she had been reading and dashed over to Sherlock, taking her into her arms.
“Close your eyes” he whispered, watching Sherlock shiver from his proximity and hoping it was no longer from fear.
“Come John, I don’t have time for your tedious questions! Yes, it’s a rose; the rarest in the western world and it’s been stolen. Do you understand what this means?” Sherlock’s voice grew slightly higher in pitch in anticipation, and John watched him for a moment before shaking his head.
“Sherlock’s father was threatened, by a man in Sherlock’s town, and he will be put away if Sherlock does not go back and marry the man,” John said, his stomach churning at the idea of Sherlock being forced into marriage, but knowing that he could not help Sherlock in this.
Sherlock adjusted the lacy strap on the ridiculous garment, feeling equal parts foolish and seductive. At least, she hoped.
(See the end of the chapter for
Looking into the mirror now, with her hair down, make-up painted on lightly, and only lacy lingerie to cover her mostly naked body, she knew she looked feminine.
“Suck me, now,” John demanded, grasping a fistful of Sherlock’s hair and gently rubbing, knowing how sensitive Sherlock’s hair follicles are and using the knowledge to his advantage. Sherlock grasped the end of John’s member and began to sink his mouth slowly down, until over half of John’s impressive cock was sheathed in the wet, velvety heat.
As he was taking off his fine clothing, changing into the simple trousers, shirt and cloak he had worn to the castle all those weeks ago, Mrs. Hudson came by to wish him goodbye.
thing I’ve ever done,” John giggled, thinking back to his transformation the night before.
Sherlock was about to ask how that was possible but then he remembered-
“Color?” John asked quietly, and Sherlock thought for a moment, before answering, “still green, John.”
And offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter cold.
John approached slowly, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth as he observed his demure lover,
“No,” Siger whispered, still gazing into the fire as if in a trance, “I will never let Sherlock marry the likes of you.”
As the two men tended to sleep naked, the feeling of John’s bare skin against his own gave Sherlock a rush of sensation as he gripped at John’s muscles to sooth himself.
“NO,” he roared, and Lestrade only cocked a silver eyebrow in response.
John sat in his armchair and watched his love standing by the window with his beautiful instrument in the twilight, his eyes shining as he listened to Sherlock pour out his frustrations and lingering, fading fear into his music, the melody soothing John’s soul.
Sherlock had oddly missed the beast since the night be proved he could be kind. There was a heart buried deep, somewhere, and Sherlock was determined to find it. True, he missed his papa with a present ache in his chest, but Sherlock also saw a loneliness lurking in the beast's eyes that he had often seen staring at him in the mirror. Sherlock knew he was lonely, and he knew he should have been more focused on created friendships with his peers, but Sherlock had always been a little too different.
Sherlock was leaking profusely against his own stomach, and begging incessantly, saying
John nodded and Sherlock reached forward, quickly unzipping John and taking out his aroused member and swallowing the tip with a moan of satisfaction.
Distantly, he heard John greeting Lestrade at the door, asking if he wanted a beer in a calm, normal tone, and Sherlock felt his control begin to slip.
But Sherlock wanted to care for John, help him see the man in the mirror that shown through his cerulean eyes every time he so much as glanced at Sherlock. The man who laughed at Sherlock’s character voices when he read aloud in the library, who struggled using utensils at the table but kept trying fruitlessly, even though Sherlock only found it endearing and wished he would just use his hands.
It felt-
In contradiction to his sweet expression as he stared at his love, he pushed, pushed, and
“Does he have fangs and claws too?” Prodded another.
As the beast looked out the window, he saw the beginning of buds blossoming on the tree. In just a few weeks, the spell would be permanent. He sighed, thinking about his fate and the fate of Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Molly, and Rosie-
“Thank you, dear,” she smiled sweetly as John handed her the cup of tea where she sat in the desk chair, and the three of them spent the next half an hour chatting about the weather, Mrs. Turner’s married ones, and finally, John and Sherlock.
Sherlock felt heat stinging at his cheeks, and his palms began to perspire in nervous excitement as he followed Captain Watson into the fray.
A roar emanated from the mirror in the next instant, the edges glittering from magic and John’s beastly body was displayed on the mirror’s face, he was roaring into the night on the balcony outside his bedchambers.
Meanwhile, John’s vision went hazy with the focus of an army captain and a doctor accustomed to critical trauma, focusing in on the murder and only him.
The panties extenuated how vulnerable to young man was, and also how susceptible to advances. Sherlock turned to the side in embarrassment, trying to cover himself and staring into a candle adamantly as if he could disappear if he tried, but John was struck momentarily speechless at the sight of his naked arse, outlined beautifully by the panty’s revealing cut, a piece of green silk separating Sherlock's cheeks, rubbing up against his hole, begging to be taken, plundered,
Sherlock grumbled slightly at the lack of warmth for a moment, before stealing the majority of the duvet and flipping over to the other side of the bed, his gangly legs sticking out of the bottom of the comforter.
Even if it was a compromise.
Sherlock wiggled around, clenching and gasping as the plug tickled his already frazzled nerve endings and remained locked, immovable, inside his most private place, the place that only John had ever explored. And now, John had connected nearly all his sexual desires and experiences to his aching bum, causing his hole to become ravenous for John's touch on a daily basis. And John knew it.
- and Sherlock slightly overwhelmed by the amount of deductions about John’s tanned, muscled, and imperfectly perfect body.
“Stay here Philip” Siger ordered absentmindedly, moving past the small opening in the gate and ignoring Philip’s distressed
Across the land, Sherlock sat perched on her window seat, drawing her legs up and clutching her silken nightgown as she looked over the palace gardens- garden being a modest term for the acres of sprawling flowers, shrubs, fountains and statues that continued past where even her sharp gaze could see.
Holding onto the base of John’s cloak and hanging in midair, Moriarty turned his deadened eyes to meet Sherlock's one more time, and with a wink, he let go and fell to the bottom of the ravine, never to be seen or heard from again.
Suddenly, a mad thought struck Sherlock, and he ran to the fireplace, ignoring his father’s confused exclamation of his name, and raced straight out the door with the looking glass. The three men followed, and Sherlock addressed the crowd.
“And,” John spoke over Sherlock with a chuckle of fond exasperation, “I thought it would be nice to go to the same place we went to dinner the first night, a year ago.”
He whined in defiance and shook his head, but the teasing strokes and kisses stopped suddenly as Sherlock felt the forest melting away around him.
“I do have a black tie outfit, Sherlock,” John cleared this throat, an unreadable expression donning on his face, “My dress uniform. I wear it to every wedding and formal event. Or…. Or is that not good enough?”
“Sherlock-
to Sherlock repeatedly, his chest heaving as his breathing became labored. Sherlock wiped the tears away for a moment, before leaning down to kiss the salty wetness away, savoring the feeling of his lover finally, after all his years alone as a beast, allowing himself to be vulnerable.
Sherlock shook his head, looking down at the mirror in his hands, “I’ll come back, I promise.”
A few meters away, the commander of the King’s guard- Thrymn- watched John with a critical eye as he sharped his longsword, tracking John’s movements and observing her skill at close-hand combat. She had passed the tests for speed, agility, and fighting on horseback. John took down a man- Anderson- twice her size on the training grounds the day before, and despite Thrymn’s unwillingness to even test a woman, she was exceeding his high-set expectations for one of his guards.
, my love,” Sherlock murmured, reaching down to kiss John’s collarbone and neck and reveling in the gasp he heard when he began to suck as he deftly undid John’s shirt, “let me.”
"Lestrade, I can't wear this!" John growled at the candelabra who was holding out his flickering candles in a calming manner.
She remembered afternoons spent exploring those gardens when she was a child, playing pirates with Mycroft before be became too busy being reared as the crown prince to concern himself with his lesser sister and her childish games. In the dark, when she was alone, she could admit that she missed his company. It was lonely being a genius with no audience.
“What did he say?” Asked Molly curiously.
“Sherlock, look at me,” John’s voice distantly echoed where Sherlock was lost in his mind, but he ignored it. He couldn’t
John kissed his arsecheeks sweetly and nudged him to continue.
John leaned up, licking the cum staining Sherlock’s abdomen and his neck, cleaning it away with sweet kisses and heated licks, until he finally reached Sherlock’s lips.
John turned around to look at his detective, who was sulking in his chair as John had stopped kissing him, and John’s heart swelled as he stared at the immature man-child in his living room.
And turned the old woman away.
think you were doing, hmmm? Flirting with him?” John growled, his anger from before bubbling back the surface, and Sherlock gulped slightly and looked away.
Leaning forward, John began to place tantalizing kisses on Sherlock’s no-longer innocent arse, tonguing lightly on the rosy cheeks and beginning to venture nearer, closer to the crevice where Sherlock’s prize laid.
Absolute
John didn’t blame her, he lost his temper with all his staff members practically on a daily basis. But regardless, he wished to be alone.
Mrs. Hudson gave a light chuckle at that, “Of course she was right love, mother’s are never wrong. And you are beautiful Sherlock, an absolute vision. Oh, I cannot wait for John to see you” she tittered, and Sherlock took a deep breath, meeting his own eyes in the mirror and steeling himself for the night ahead.
Panic was rising, flooding in her chest as she tried to calm the panic from the dream of the war, clenching her fists rhythmically.
With a final, teasing kiss against the pinking pucker, John leaned back, “all done.”
Around and around the dance floor they moved, Sherlock leading the steps but John very much keeping the two men afloat, their eyes locked intensely, blue meeting changeable grey.
Amazing.
Mycroft’s lips pressed together for a moment before he explained, “Because you are the princess of this nation, and that is what princesses do to provide for their nation- they look pretty and they have advantageous marriages to help their war-torn nations stay afloat.”
John watched Sherlock’s propped up bum squirm of its own volition for a moment longer, “next time, I think I’ll take a video, so then I can watch your sweet arse writhe for me whenever I like. Show it off to my coworkers, perhaps, that I have such a good, obedient boy.”
John rolled his eyes in fond exasperation, and began cleaning Sherlock off.
“You’re so cute, I don’t know how I kept my hands off of you for so long,” John murmured into the hushed tranquility surrounding the two men.
With a muffled gasp, Sherlock came once again, painting his stomach further with his essence, and his body shook from overstimulation already.
in a way that makes Sherlock heart beat faster and tingles rush down his spine when the beast roars or commands. Ever the prince and the army captain, used to getting his way.
John watched the detective for a moment, and was struck by the feeling that something was amiss. His eye grazed up and down Sherlock prone body, landing on his legs where they were hanging out of his dressing gown.
Trying to quell her disconcerting excitement at the proximity of her guard, she hurried through her task in order to gain some space from the vulnerable position she was in. She was utterly naked, with a practical stranger less than ten feet away; and yet, she felt safe in the ex-captain's company all the same.
John walked in the front door of 221B, walking slowly up the seventeen worn steps and entering his living room, finding Sherlock sitting in his armchair.
"Oh, good, where do you go in your mind, love?" John wondered aloud, stroking Sherlock's hair gently, "and just what were you doing there?" He asked faux-sternly, narrowing his eyes on Sherlock who had a string of pre-cum connecting his cock to the bedpost, the crime obvious enough for even John to work out.
“Well, I’ll leave you two. Sherlock, be polite to our guest,” he reminded lowly while Moriarty looked on with a small smile. Mycroft peeled Sherlock’s arm off of his with a confused look at Sherlock’s uncharacteristic clinginess.
The thick, easily eight inch dildo glistening with oil where it sat on the chair, ready and waiting for Sherlock’s arse to swallow it down to the root, forcing him down on the fake cock that would stimulate him endlessly throughout dinner, without relief.
Sherlock felt her heart pick up as a flush crawled up from just above her chest to settle on her neck, matching her red ball gown. Something about this woman before her made her lose control of her transport, and while it was utterly distracting, it was also appealing. Dangerous.
of a heart well loved, trying to control his quaking breathing as his emotions rushed in turmoil within his body.
A sharp knock at the bathroom door sent her flailing up, pausing in confusion. The knock wasn’t familiar to her- Mrs. Hudson’s was brief and firm, her brother’s was loud and obnoxious, and Molly’s was timid. Who then was this…?
“Well, John, how about a rousing round of gay sex to solidify our pride festivities?” Sherlock asked, half-joking despite his exhaustion, but John merely smiled and shook his head. Sherlock was surprised, as it wasn't like John to refuse sex, but then again the man had experienced quite a life-altering day of acceptance.
Because, John reminded himself with a deep breath to calm his nerves, because of everything he could gain. They could gain.
“Alright everyone, Bank of England, stat” Lestrade ordered gruffly, ignoring Sherlock’s glee and dismissing the young detective with a wave of his hand.
John.”
One step at a time, Sherlock nodded to himself and ignoring the fluttering of arousal in his abdomen, shutting the laptop with a click.
Moriarty and Sherlock looked at one another, the two geniuses deducing one another in the silence of the house, with Moran and Siger watching on with growing trepidation. Finally Moriarty’s face broke out in a crooked grin.
More recent images:
It was one of the only useful skills Mycroft had ever taught him.
“JOHN!” Sherlock yelled in a boisterous voice, breaking John was his musings and causing a small smile to form on the doctor’s lips and his eyes to crinkly up in the corners.
His hard cock was poking out of the front of his panties and was rubbing endlessly against the pillows beneath him.
Anyways, one night about two weeks after he had begun his “wooing-Sherlock” plans, he decided to take Sherlock back to the beginning and have a re-do of that first sensational night. It had been exactly a year since they had met on January 29
That would be her sacrifice.
Sherlock was hypnotized by the man’s bright blonde hair and carefree smile, as if he hadn’t a care in the world. His eyes, a soft blue color that sat above his rounded cheeks, reminded Sherlock of his family’s trip to the ocean before his mother died. He felt… Safe.
The beast, struck silent from such a request, nodded, and Sherlock turned sat on the worn leather armchair near the warm hearth, pointing to the soft armchair directly across from him.
As Thrymn nodded once and began to turn away, John impetuously added, “Sir, I have an idea of how I can help protect the family before I leave on the Quest with Lestrade.”
“You will be stationed outside of my door and I will call for you when I need you, which I can assure you will not happen,” Sherlock promised with a sneer, her lovely lips twisted in distaste.
“And when it does, I’ll be ready,” the princess murmured, spinning to stalk from the room, fine black skirts flowing and tickling her bare feet.
She warned him not to be deceived by appearances,
Lestrade looked puzzled for another moment before his phone began ringing.
Sherlock exclaimed as his spanked arse hit the cold wood of the chair seat, the dildo completely inside of him and the head of the infernal contraption tilted to nudge at his sweet spot.
John smiled as he walked back to his desk to sit down, looking forward to his date.
Mycroft always said he was too curious for his own good, and he was right.
“W-Why are you d-doing-
Sherlock, unsuspecting of this new type of torment, practically leapt off the bed, and John reached forward to settle his hands against Sherlock's hips and gripping them hard enough to leave bruises. With that, he buried his face back into Sherlock's plush arse, and kept blowing cold air between Sherlock's jiggling bum.
After his humiliating encounter with the beast in the library, Sherlock thought it would be best to take some time to regain his self control before tonight’s dinner by going to his bedroom. With falling about in the library, and accidentally referring to the one topic that was unspoken about by mutual decision- Sherlock’s home- the curly haired man was anxious to leave the beast’s presence before embarrassing himself further.
Once he’d said the cursed words, he couldn't seem to stop, the heartbreaking mantra being repeated over and over like an epithet, the bottled emotions tumbling through: “I love you, I love you, please don’t leave me here alone.”
Moriarty was good, the best, but Mycroft was equally as clever.
“John,
his brother had sneered to him, when he found Sherlock crying in an alcove,
Sherlock cried, tears running down his flushed face as the overwhelming sensations battered into his body, his bottom practically aflame from John’s overwhelming attentions and military precision whilst delivering his punishment.
…. Sherlock wondered, looking up and meeting John’s gaze with his own changeable eyes.
It was the beast; Sherlock recognized his slightly hunched figure in the darkness.
Getting into the shower and turning it on, he washed and conditioned his hair, and his body as he normally did with his slightly honey smelling body wash. Taking a deep breath, Sherlock picked up the razor and shaving butter he had placed in the bath and lathered his legs, shaving gently up and down cautiously, as he had never shaved there before.
Blinking away the slight stinging in his eyes at his good fortune, John teasingly reprimanded Sherlock, "you two shouldn't be allowed to sit together, sometimes I feel like I have two children instead of one."
“Er… No, not particularly,” Sherlock answered, twiddling his hands together in an uncharacteristic fashion as the woman went over to a shelf and started picking out some items.
, and while John should have been surprised he could remember the date, he wasn’t. Anything to do with Sherlock Holmes was significant to John.
Warnings: blowjob, edging, sexual frustration abounding ;)
As he grew, due to the endless love and support from his parents, Sherlock learned to ignore the harsh criticisms against his appearance, and grew more beautiful within as well.
When his wife had shot Sherlock, John had completely given up on his marriage. It was a breath of relief for John, remembering back to his wedding day and the regret he felt listening to Sherlock pour his heart out in front of one hundred and fifty strangers and a few dear friends. The heart he claimed not to have, and that John had never gone searching for; as if Sherlock hadn't spent their entire friendship rejecting such frivolities.
After a moment longer, they were alone in the dining room, Mrs. Hudson closing the door behind her, and the silence echoed in their wake. Sherlock and John turned to each other, sky blue meeting gray, and they found they could wait no longer. John rushed forward, pulling Sherlock down by the neck and capturing his lips in a punishing kiss, lingering slightly when he pulled away to tease the younger man after his eating performance, licking his lower lip and feeling a shock of electricity rush down his spine and into his growing erection.
Sherlock moaned in delight, distracting John from his sentimental musings, the vibrations moving from his lips to John’s cock, and suddenly the man could take no more teasing.
As Sherlock walked into the formal dining room, and saw hundreds of candle’s lighting the room with a soft, romantic glow, he flushed, realizing the implications of this particular dinner.
John reached for the washcloth and ran it soothingly across Sherlock’s chest and up to his chest. He covered it with more soap and washed his arms, tickling under his arms lightly and receiving a giggle for his attentions. He leaned down to swipe over Sherlock’s fully spent cock, cradling his soft member gently so as not to hurt Sherlock, and then moving down with the washcloth the wash gently between his cheeks.
“I know, John,” Sherlock said back, meeting John’s gaze levelly and placing John’s unoccupied hand over his heart; expressing his love for John in his devotion, submission, and every quickened beat-
She reached out to stroke both of their cheeks, smiling at them both fondly, before turning and closing the door with a final reminder, “ten minutes, I want to see you both in the dining room.”
Wait. Deflecting
Grasping his leaking, erect cock firmly, he began tugging it and groaning, just remembering Sherlock’s sweet, oversensitive reaction’s to John’s teasing, causing him to come from a few words and some light pressure against his cock.
After a few more moments of observation, however, a whimper worked its way up this throat, a flaring heat spreading down his neck in realization.
John stroked through his mussed curls, knowing how overwhelming someone’s first time could be, and simply laid with Sherlock, caring for him with kisses and whispers of sweet nothings.
Sherlock gently laid the rose back in its glass case, and walked slowly back to John and the bed, suddenly feeling the almost two days without sleep. Laying down and pulling a blanket overtop of him, he snuggled into John's side for warmth; and the last moment he consciously remembers was a pair of soft lips kissing his forehead.
John shut off the connection quickly after that, feeling as if he had already pried enough, and he didn’t want to prove himself anymore beastly by taking advantage of the oblivious Sherlock, but he couldn't help trailing his paw down his expansive abdomen and grabbing his large cock, already hardened from the sight, and stroking it to the imagine of the confused innocence Sherlock displayed in the art gallery. So sweet.
“Do you want to play?” John asked lowly, making the request seem more like a demand, and Sherlock gulped before nodding vigorously. Yes, he wanted, so much.
.” Sherlock trailed off, his face rosy from more than the heated bath as he remembered what he had called John during his orgasm.
We may not be so different after all, Sherlock pondered as he reached the castle gates, walking up to the large door and taking a deep breathe.
Sherlock did not even glance at her guard, but John seemed uncaring of this fact and continued: “She had always wanted a feminine daughter, since Harry was more masculine and utterly uninterested in gowns or propriety. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but my mother wanted ball gowns, and makeup, and a happily ever after like in the fairytales.” John huffed a facetious laugh.
to be taken. John looked down and saw Sherlock's cock becoming erect rapidly, and he mouthed at his tight balls momentarily, basking in Sherlock's overstimulated cries for more, while his body tried to squirm away.
Naturally submissive indeed.
"It's rude to kiss at the table, Mrs. Hudson said so," she parroted, and John and Sherlock glanced at one another sheepishly.
Once he was fully seated within his husband, Sherlock looked down to see John’s head to turned to the side, trying to hide from him. Sherlock reached a hand up, grabbing under his chin and moving John’s head softly to face him.
John’s eyes opened blearily and he blinked a few times, yawning and taking in the space around him. Sun shone in through the window, and John reveled in the odd sensation of warmth against his skin, the enchanted castle now full of light that permeated the very air. John took a deep breath in, and at hearing a noise to his right, he realized was that he was not alone in his bed.
He turned to storm back into his chambers, to shut out the light of the oppressing moon shining down, when he heard a distant shout coming from just beyond the castle gates.
She heard the princess gasp quietly. Inwardly, John was crowing that her simple praises and a chaste kiss could undo the brilliant, capable woman such as the one before her and transform her into a stammering, blushing youth.
Sherlock gave a secret smile, and allowed John to hold him as he pretended to continue to look for a book, basking in the sensations of being held and treasured.
Lestrade looked between the two of them with wide eyes, watching the tender, blushing expression on Sherlock's face with complete confusion, but John caught his gaze and shook his head firmly. Not yet, Sherlock wasn’t ready for it to be acknowledged.
Sherlock began to walk towards her chamber doors, now in sight. John’s footsteps followed behind her, but Sherlock ignored her  guard, a whirl of conflicting emotions in her chest.
Sherlock’s attention was drawn back to the case as his Papa pulled out a beautiful umbrella, with an oaken curved handle and a beautiful design that seemed to be perfect for the rainy days they often experienced in the small town of Sussex. Mycroft looked delighted despite himself, forgetting his usual cold exterior in favor of examining his new gift.
“I-I,” Sherlock hiccupped, matching the exaggerated breaths John was taking to encourage calm himself down and reorder his thoughts into a semblance of logical order.
“Lestrade, what have you got for me,” Sherlock queried in his usual haughty tone, and John had to choke off a laugh remembering Sherlock's high whines and begging cries the night before. He wasn’t so high and mighty then.
“How can you say that, John?” Sherlock asked after a moment of hesitation, looking down at the table and playing idly with a fork, a vulnerable expression on his face in the form of downturned brows and sheltered eyes, the candlelight dancing on his face.
“Well, ah,” John rubbed the back of her neck, “I’m here for your welfare, to keep you out of trouble, and the make sure you’re safe at all times.”
After a few more minutes of socializing, John grabbed Sherlock around the waist in a playful manner, “Sherlock,” John laughed his name, spinning him around, delighting in Sherlock’s surprised expression at his manhandling and pulling him away from their guests, “come on, dance with me.”
John’s eyes widened as more alabaster skin came into view until Sherlock slipped his soft white shirt off his shoulders and threw it carelessly behind his chair.
Grasping the sides of his thick coat, he wrapped it around his bony torso and ducked his head to hide his flushed cheeks and tented trousers from the prying eyes of Lestrade.
There were frogs legs displayed next to pearl necklaces at the armoire, a microscope placed lovingly at the center of an oak desk, and an ornate fireplace with a skull on the mantle. While the room was filled with golden chandeliers and bright windows, the darkness of the décor seemed a perfect blend for the occupant of the suite.
After just a few moments, Sherlock was writhing on the sheets with abandon, begging John practically incoherently to “get on with it, John!”
, yet again.
“What is over there?” Sherlock asked, and Lestrade and Molly glanced at each other with nervous expressions on their inanimate faces.
Quickly, without giving himself time to think about it, John brought up the first clamp to Sherlock’s right nipple, pressed it open and then attached it, watching it fall closed and relishing Sherlock’s pained gasp.
“What are you doing sleeping at the windowsill? You’ll catch your death, young lady,” she snapped, bustling around the bedchambers to get to Sherlock’s wardrobe.
With that parting shot, she whisked away and shut the door behind her, leaving Sherlock and John staring at one another in thick silence.
John slide down Sherlock’s body, as Sherlock watched in confusion and delight, wondering what John was doing but grateful that she was still touching her.
"When you are searching for that precious rose, I want you to remember that the only rose I care about is winking at me, and drawing me in, as we speak," John said, smiling at Sherlock's embarrassed huff as he continued to slowly draw his finger in and out of Sherlock's flushed rosebud.
All the Londoners, young and old, members of the community and allies, were smiling and laughing, hugs were all around as organizers passed out free condoms, dental dams, and pointed out were to get STI tests. It was such a mixture of ethnicities, languages, and experiences.
“Look at how your cheeks jiggle for me, your backside is so deliciously plump,” John commented off handedly, his eyes closing in pleasure at Sherlock’s embarrassed hiccup that he tried to muffle with the couch cushions.
“And how do you feel about your relationship, Sherlock?” Mrs. Hudson’s voice calling him from his musings, and Sherlock looked over to see John’s eyes watching him curiously.
literature-orgasms below. Pride will be next and after that, who knows!
“You’ll need some help with the corset,” the saleswoman called from just outside the curtain, and Sherlock nodded to himself.
Sherlock closed his eyes in mortification; no matter how many times he came in front of John, the pleasure of his body being John’s to manipulate and control so easily irked and humiliated him. Was he really so predicable?
Learning new intimacies has been an experience for the boys, but they wouldn't have it any other way. Warning: some sexual content and references to torture and alcoholism
Moriarty made a face at Sherlock's use of his formal title and scoffed, "Now, now Sherlock, we don't have any need to have formalities between us. After all, we are the two resident geniuses" he declared with a devious grin that didn't reach his cold eyes, "it's only natural that we get to know one another better."
John smiled, and gently leaned down to kiss Sherlock’s forehead, letting her lips rest there from a moment, and Sherlock closed her eyes against the stinging sensation behind her eyes, “because I love you, and because you’re the most gorgeous person I’ve ever known.”
But John stepped forward and knocked the large bin away with an easy swing in midair, and Sherlock watched the muscles flex beneath his think jumper at the movement while the trash bin hit the brick wall with a clang.
Sherlock rolled his eyes and flung his body from his place on the floor in order to lounge- or mope, rather- on the couch, his catlike eyes narrowed at John's relaxed form sitting in his armchair, filling out paperwork from the surgery, oblivious and uncaring in the face of Sherlock's turmoil.
A sign of blooming desire was the meaning of pink roses, Sherlock recalled from his Botany book, and his cheeks reheated to match the color of his rose as he delicately plucked the blossom from the beast’s hands, pulling it close and smelling the clean fragrance and wishing, for a moment, that he would be brave enough to steal a kiss.
” John clicked his lips in mock disapproval, his eyes sparkling contradictorily.
As they walked along the hallways covered in tapestries and chandeliers, John saw beautiful and exotic paintings and sculptures that she had never seen the likes of before, pictures of past monarchs, great battles told in their history, and places far across the realm that she would never see.
Yes, just maybe.
John,” Sherlock sighed as he entered his love slowly, the color high on his cheeks as John clenched around him, getting used to the new sensation.
John left the library shortly after their exchange, going to talk to the servants about their new jobs within the palace, now that the castle had been restored to its former glory.
"Can anyone be happy if they aren't free?" She whispered to herself.
“Good, how about after work?”
Glancing down at the pink rose in his palm, Sherlock gripped it tightly despite the thorns, and watched as his hand began to drip blood.
"Mmhm, did I say you could walk?" John reprimanded lightly, not looking up from his papers.
Finally, after an eternity, Mrs. Hudson said it was time to retire for the evening. Sherlock stood up and walked over to John, who was giving Rosie a kiss on the forehead and saying goodnight.
John rewarded Sherlock with a soft, wet kiss on his perineum, and Sherlock’s back arched slightly despite begin confined in the corset, whining lowly in his throat for more as John’s kisses dried on his sensitive skin.
Sherlock grasped John’s cloak, and pulled him forward, yelling out at the strain it caused his smaller body to hold onto the beast, and looked around wildly to see what had happened.
He turned away, shaking his head at his foolishness until he heard a feminine voice call.
, Sherlock thought desperately, swinging his arms wildly in front of the wolves, crying out as he attempted fend of the vicious animals, and letting out a startled shout that echoed all around him as one of the wolves tore at his pant legs, nicking the flesh of his ankle.
“I am beautiful,” Sherlock panted out, and John lifted their joined hands up and swept a sweaty curl from his forehead, “I am kind, and intelligent, I can deduce-“
Sensitive.
“Pretend to be ill,” John whispered as they approached the attending palace guard.
“J-John, I can’t much longer,” Sherlock whimpered, curling in on himself as the rocking cab continued to batter away at his already frazzled nerves and arousal, the plug shifting over his sweet spot with every jostled. Sherlock bit his lips roughly, the cupid’s bow turning red under his ministrations. His coat had long since hung open, revealing his tented trousers, and John nearly came at the sight of Sherlock attempting to control his transport, and utterly failing.
,” John begged, writhing on the sheets and trying to escape the insurmountable pleasure, but Sherlock was unyielding in his torment, beginning to press a finger inside of John, immediately finding his sweet spot and stroking over it with precision.
“What should we have for dinner, love?” He asked, and Sherlock flopped down in his chair in annoyance. He didn’t care about something as trivial as
“Well then, let’s go love.”
“So what do you say, Sherlock? I promise to fuck you, fill you, adore you,
Sherlock felt a tugging at the corners of his mouth as he bandaged the wound.
“It’s amazing,” Sherlock whispered, and John walked forward to stand beside him, taking his hand and kissing it like the prince he was, bowing slightly with a gleam of mischief in his blue eyes.
Screams and shocked gasps sounded from the crowd, and Sherlock tried to hush them saying, “he is not dangerous. He is educated and rational. He was-“ Sherlock paused, thinking, “kind to me.”
John leaned up and met his eyes, smiling an expression that was too sweet for someone who was currently buried in another human being to be wearing, his sincerely loving expression warring with the molten heat reflected in his midnight eyes.
The two men spent the day eating fruit kebabs from an old lesbian couple, dancing along with the Drag Queen’s singing Karaoke, and laughing uproariously anytime either of them were hit on by an old gay man, which was pretty often.
John shut his eyes, and willed his relaxed body to sleep.
Poem 3: Christina Rossetti “I loved you first: but afterwards your love”
Pairs of glowing brown eyes were staring at him from beyond the bushes and underbrush, and Sherlock gulped, sucking in a deep breath as the wolves drew closer to him.
“You parading around bare-arsed, I mean. I don’t mind it.” John said with a wink and a smile, and Sherlock turned back to his phone to hide the blush rising to his cheeks.
They mingled for a while with their guests, holding hand or brushing against one another as they received well wishes from their family and friends, Sherlock’s Papa and Mrs. Hudson were crying lightly as they greeted the boys with tearful hugs.
Sherlock raced down the stairs of the West Wing, past the ballroom and the kitchen, ignoring Mrs. Hudson’s calls for Sherlock to come back. He grabbed his cloak from his room and ran, down the front stairs and out the door. He paused briefly to look at the magic gazebo, with the beautiful roses blooming despite the cold winter night, and he mourned ever asking for a rose. If he had never sought to have one, his father never would have been captured, and he never would have been imprisoned.
John stepped back to admire his beautiful figure, with his arms above his head Sherlock’s lithe body was elongated, his back tensing slightly, his arse in the air was positively glowing as it sloped gently upwards.
John reached one hand up to toy with Sherlock’s hardened nipple, while at the same time reaching his other hand down to press teasingly against that saliva-coated hole, which opened trustingly for John and John alone.
John gently swiped Sherlock off, drying every inch of his sodden flesh, fluffing his curls lightly and scratching behind his ears, causing Sherlock to close his eyes with a groan of happiness at the action.
When he had been punished after the case a few weeks ago. When he had been….
"We caught him, he is in the stables safe and sound," Lestrade answered, and Sherlock gave his thanks. At least with Philip he would have a part of home with him, even though now Mycroft would be unable to track where Sherlock had gone.
Sherlock blinked in silence for a few minutes, looking helplessly around him and tensing his body to leave. Sensing his nervousness, the saleswoman walked over and laid a calming hand on Sherlock’s arm continued to shake his head in confusion.
John got up, ignoring his half-naked state, and raced across the room to envelope the old woman in a hug, whispering, “none of that
John growled as he typed out a reply:
Was he perhaps still afraid of John? The beast couldn’t blame him, after everything that had happened, but he was sure that he and Sherlock had grown closer in the past month or so they had been together.
,” Sherlock felt the rivaling sensations of embarrassment and arousal in his belly, the stinging from the ginger root fading but still prevalent as John bounced him lightly on his knee while he stroked Sherlock’s flushed cock and whispered embarrassing remarks.
“Look who’s being such a good little boy now,” John cooed, and Sherlock’s face blushed scarlet in the firelight at John’s babyish voice.
So John decided that he would be patient. For now.
“Naughty boy, alright, suck me,” John commanded, and Sherlock licked a stripe up the length before beginning to swallow John down, slowly, teasingly rubbing his tongue along the head while his throat constricted and swallowed around John’s manhood.
John kept effusing endearments, and Sherlock flushed predictably, adoring the feeling of John member entering him inexorably, warming the chill lingering inside and cementing their bond to one another. Playing was always fun, but nothing could compare to John's touch, John's love,
Sherlock laid down, with his hips over the pillow and placing his bum up in the air, looking over to John with dark eyes and wiggling his arse suggestively.
,” He cried out in an embarrassingly high voice, but John smiled and leaned down to take his length into his mouth once again, sucking and licking expectedly.
“Shh, love, you know this is how I feel about you. Shakespeare merely expresses it more eloquently,” John explained with a smirk in his voice, parting and closing Sherlock’s arse cheeks teasingly, “now read.”

“Sherlock," John quietly prompted after a while, “I need to know how you feel so we can figure this out. We don’t need to do anything more than this,” John remarked, enjoying the friendly intimacy between the two men in the flat at the moment, “but if you want more than this, we need to talk about it, love.”
And it was frightening, but Sherlock couldn’t focus on that now, couldn’t focus at all, not with pulsing sensations running up his spine with every smack to his pucker.
He manhandled Sherlock on his side, spooning him from behind and settling light, teasing kisses on the back of Sherlock’s neck as he rocked his erection through Sherlock’s ample arse slowly. Sherlock gave a happy little “mmmhh” sigh and snuggled deeper into John’s embrace, flexing his gluteus muscles and listening to John groan with a little smirk on his flushed face.
Gently taking it off, Sherlock stared down at the next article of clothing, a blush rising unbidden to his face.
Mrs. Hudson squinted her eyes disbelievingly but shrugged her shoulders, heading back to the wardrobe while Sherlock frantically formulated reasons to leave and be alone- and get that feeling back, whatever it was…
“John, you must come, someone’s stolen a rose!” Sherlock gestured wildly about, his ebony curls bouncing from the movement and Sherlock’s face slightly flushed from his exertion and rising energy.

“Shhh, sweetheart, come lie with me,” He whispered, kissing the nape of his neck, and Sherlock nodded silently, some of the tension leaving his lightly muscled shoulders.
John smiled, his heart aching at the sweetness of Sherlock at his most exposed, and he leaned up to wipe the teardrops from Sherlock’s face, all the while gazing at him as if he was everything while continuing to make love to him, nudging against his prostate in a rhythmic motion and trying to stem the stinging in the back of his own eyes.
Rushing through the door, she slammed it behind her, slumping back against it with a sigh as if she has escaped a demon. With her heart racing she clenched her hands together, her feet carrying her to her bed while her mind swirled with deductions and confusing emotional nuances that Sherlock had no use for before.
He was wearing a pair of green silk panties.
“Go back to sleep, lovely,” John whispered, and Sherlock obeyed, closing his eyes and beginning to softly snore in the next moment. John gently kissed Sherlock’s forehead and tucked the duvet around his exhausted figure.
“I, well, I like them too,” Sherlock admitted, biting his lip.

And that was how he knew something was
Perhaps the prince was a hated family member? Doubtful, the beast was of a prickly sort, to be sure, but he didn’t seem to wish that sort of spite on others. He is always rather kind, always smiling when Rosie is mentioned or Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson argue about the cleaning.
his mind supplied unhelpfully. John shook his head, walking out onto his balcony and watching as Sherlock mounted his horse and rode off into the night, his alabaster skin matching the freshly fallen snow. Even from a distance, Sherlock was a graceful vision. Without John's conscious thought, a howl tore itself from his throat, admitting to the sky what a lonely and saddened creature he was.
He began to palm at his growing bulge with one hand, the other reaching up to continue stroking his stomach and nipples. John continued lazily pleasuring himself for a while, until his own desperation became too ravenous to ignore, and he bit his lips to stop the sounds from escaping, picturing Sherlock in his mind.
As she poured the oily substance into her hands, she felt John’s eyes piercing her body from her placement across the room. Glancing down, Sherlock realized the bubbles had gone down significantly since they had begun their argument and, with the water she had sloshed on the floor, her sharp collarbones and most of her upper chest were now exposed.
"Sherlock what the hell took you so-" John trailed off, her mouth gaping as she took in the sight of her soon to be lover.
John gulped in a deep breath, shivering slightly at the dark memories of her past.
The corset kept him in place, his shaking causing his hips to sway and his plump cheeks to jiggle slightly with each movement, much to John’s enjoyment.
John winked flirtatiously at Lestrade and he chuckled, dismounted and grasping John on the shoulder- both of them attempting to ignore her wince.
Kiss- I
Allowing him to lie there for a moment as he calmed down, and stroking over the rosy cheeks, John picked up the detective.
“John” Sherlock called his name with his velvety baritone voice, “why did you want to go to dinner here?” John met Sherlock’s eyes. That was the question of the hour, wasn’t it? Why did John want to jeopardize the best friendship he had ever obtained for the sake of a confession?
Sherlock, still completely blissed out and lightly moaning, was shocked when a pair of lips captured his. John swallowing the luscious moans from the first orgasm of many he was going to bestow on his gorgeous detective.
you,” Sherlock whispered, looking down- and that was new- at the man who once stood seven feet tall with fangs and claws. Now he looks like a man, just like anyone else. Still, it was John, and Sherlock knew that no matter the form, his beast that he fell in love with resided in this man, this amazing man, whom he loved.
And she had kissed her hand.
John wanted to hold onto this strange, vulnerable man sitting in his chair. This ridiculous man who insisted on wearing his
“You-is this?” Sherlock asked haltingly, in shock.
” A velvety cry sounded from the doorway, and the beast’s eyes flew open in shock.
Sherlock’s father peered at him, assessing for a moment. Finally he said, “I want to hear the whole story,” picking up Sherlock’s pack and leading him back inside the house with an arm around his shoulders.
John sat in his armchair in the library, trying to read and failing, thinking back to his first night with Sherlock. It had been, in a word, fantastic. John marveled at the trust Sherlock was placing in him, and just
“Come now Sherlock, tell me, who is my
Sherlock cried, but it was too late, John was pulling him over to the couch, settling Sherlock over his knees in a swift motion, propping Sherlock's bum high in the air, much to the younger man's dismay.
Sherlock watched, his stomach tightening as John licked his lips without looking away from his hole, and he squirmed and writhed in vain, trying to close his parted cheeks that were revealing his most private place.
Sherlock was young, sometimes John forgot what it was like to be in his twenties, untried and completely unknowing of certain intimacies. Perhaps, Sherlock was jealous? He had certainly acted jealous of the women John had dated in the past, but this, this reaction was new. Sherlock seemed devastated, crushed.
John went over to Sherlock’s dresser, grabbing a pair of pajama bottoms and walking back over to his bed, laying the bottoms down and reaching over to begin undressing the oddly non-verbal man.
When he penetrated him. Laid him bare. Exposed him for what he truly was, at him most vulnerable. A man in love. And now, Sherlock would give that to John.
But what if John hadn't imagined the way Sherlock had flushed in the cab when John had praised him with a fond “amazing” after his deductions before turning away from John to peer out the window. What if Sherlock had only rejected John at Angelo’s because he simply didn’t understand human entanglements and romantic liaisons?
Seeing Sherlock being spanked like a recalcitrant child, crying out for John to stop.
Later, in the library, Sherlock was browsing for books, amazed at the light illuminating the space from the sun shining outside: no more clouds to cover their days. As he searched for a book on organic chemistry, he felt a pair of warm, muscled arms wrap around his waist, pulling him back into a hard chest, a pair of lips kissing the nape of his neck, tickling his downy curls lightly.
“I’m not going to touch you Sherlock, and you’re not to touch yourself,” he said softly, adoring the confused crinkle between Sherlock’s brow before continuing.
John began to fuck Sherlock rapidly, pulling almost completely out and pushing back in,
Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade were glad that Sherlock and John weren't hurt overly much, and when Molly brought Rosie into Sherlock's room to see him while he rested his hurt ankle, she clattered and clanked up to Sherlock and demanded he not leave her again. Sherlock giggled at the imperious little girl's command, but nodded his head with a mock-serious expression, until Rosie was content with his promise to stay.
Finally they came to a stop, and Sherlock could not calculate their placement in the castle in his mind palace. He had never been there before.
Sherlock twisted in his bindings, trying to escape and press against the sensations, his chest heaving and his cock beginning to slowly harden once again in his thoroughly soaked pink panties.
Sherlock thought in retaliation, the sheer humiliation of John walking in to see Sherlock, naked and flushed, no hands on his aching prick but one teasing his pink, hardened nipple and one thrusting a light blue vibrator in and out of his ravenous hole, begging to be taken by a man, well, John might come marching over to wretch Sherlock's hand away, pulling out the wicked, pulsing object himself and-
“Look at you, Sherlock, letting me put nipple clamps on you, like a slut,” he said lowly, but not harshly, watching Sherlock’s reactions to ensure he didn’t go too far into their passion play.
Truthfully, Sherlock wanted a rose because they were beautiful. Their simplicity and deep colors reminded Sherlock of the beautiful aspects of life, like his mother, and his books. He never knew why those particular flowers were so dear to him, only that he had always felt pulled to them in ways he didn't fully comprehend.
