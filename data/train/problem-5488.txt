“This won't be the end of your careers though,” Donna told them thoughtfully, halfway through their second bottle of wine. “You're both big names. You'll get through this. Me, on the other hand? I'm going to go down as centauricorn hunter
Dean moved his mouth off the cock.
“Just because I have wings, does not mean I lay eggs!” Castiel shouted after him, also running in that direction.
All alcohol served in the last 100 years was genetically engineered to get you drunk without the organ damage. It was somewhat ironic to Dean that in an age when this was possible, most people got their highs off direct brain stimulation. It did make some sense though: why introduce substances to create the effect your brain could achieve instantly?
Silence settled over the table.
They were sat in their hotel room slowly packing up, reading to return to the US. Their world tour for promoting the film finally finished.
“That’s your answer? Just Dom him into feeling better?”
And Sam spent the rest of his life trying to avoid all thoughts of horses, for fear that he'd accidentally develop a fetish.
Sam and Castiel stood there, Billie behind them looking bored, but his guys? His family? They looked so hopeful. Dean prodded at his eyes in the mirror. “You couldn’t have given me a body before my crows feet, could ya?”
Dean whistled low, impressed. “So what were you doing there?”
Castiel pulled out his still lube-wet hand, his fingers already missing the warmth of Dean surrounding them. He used his hand to start stroking down his own firm, erect cock, while he moved into position straddling Dean.
Bela, Dean had quickly realized, had an answer for everything and everyone. She was silver tongued, and if it wasn't for the fact she was slowly draining Dean of all his enthusiasm to act, he might have tried to hit on her. He was sure a night with her would be an unreplicable experience, if nothing else.
As I sit here reflecting on what I just watched, I have to say it was... genius, and perhaps, one might even go as far as to say, one of the most brilliant pieces of cinema of recent years.
Dean wiped his eyes with the back of his hand as he watched Castiel leave the room.
In the year Dean had been working for him, Dean had come to know Castiel better than any of his neighbors knew him. Probably better than a lot of his friends, and
That was when Sam noticed the rest of the stools at the bar were unoccupied.
“Anyways, so the aunts aren't actually dead?”
Dean leaned against Castiel’s legs for support.
Sam thought of Jess. Of the first time he’d met her. He was so caught up thinking fondly on the moment, he missed when Dean and Castiel started kissing.
“Can you stop reading those reviews?” Castiel said dryly as Dean continued to laugh raucously while scrolling through a compilation of reviews he'd been emailed by his agent.
Jody clapped her hands together. “Dessert, guys?”
“It is better than the Ma'lak Box,” Dean had commented with a shrug from his deathbed, as they explained to him the conclusion they’d arrived at. The bar was much bigger, for starters. He had decent sized living quarters and the bar to survive and live in. For a man who had spent hours of his life in years gone by contemplating how he should spend the rest of his days living on a far-flung planet or in that damn box, he was doing pretty well.
“More than us? Since when?”
“I love you,” he said once more, fingers quivering as he reached up to touch Dean’s cheek. Needing contact with Dean more than anything else right there and then.
“Ah, yes, you're the theater actor after all. The mysterious theater actor.”
Castiel stretched to grab the lube from under a pillow, where it had rolled to after their session that morning.
“Yeah?” Dean replied with a sultry whisper, leaning towards Cas.
“It wasn't bad, ya know? After we stopped going to school, it was a bit weird. Though I think that's why Sam was so determined to go to college, so he could have that experience we never got as kids.”
“I think I need a shower, help me relax,” Dean said suddenly, springing up from his seat.
“Yes?”
Castiel Five took his position behind a glowing Dean. He couldn’t resist pushing some of the escaping cum back into its warm, little home.
Dean rolled his eyes. “I do have meeting coming up. Isn't like we've all just quit acting. I've got to get a new job yet. Especially now.”
“What are you now?”
“Yeah?” she was distracted, anxious, now in a budding panic over what she’d just potentially done to her liver.
Benny stood up and followed Donna off to the bar. “She's gotta point, we are here to celebrate together.”
“I didn’t say anything,” Dean mumbled, blinking at Castiel.
“And now for the grand finale.”
But there she was in front of him, the woman from his dreams. The woman he'd been dreaming of for weeks now.
“Them.”
“I think we’re good then.” Castiel smiled at Sam, looking tired but energized. “Be happy, Sam. Eileen wants you to be. Dean and I want you to be.”
“Really.” He smiled fondly across the small table.
Castiel pressed a kiss to the crown of Dean’s head.
“Suuuure,” said Donna with a smirk on her face. “Your kids. I believe ya.”
They had decided on a 1pm session. For no other reason than an afternoon delight made Dean feel very self-indulgent, which in turn made him feel even hornier. He was practically vibrating in his skin with nervous energy and longing for what was hopefully about to occur.
“If you just told me… but then, you’re so shy.” He tightened his fingers further around their cocks. It was slightly on the side of too much friction, but he knew they both liked that. Just one of the many ways they’d discovered they were compatible. “I think I like that about you. You’re my own Pandora’s box of sexual pleasure.”
“Are you tempted by any of them?” Castiel had no hint in his voice as to if he thought this was a good or bad thing.
Castiel Four stepped forwards and drew Dean into a passionate kiss.
Dean was a bit sad to learn he wouldn't be able to keep the shirt. It had felt so nice on his skin. He thought it had just been some fancy designer, but he figured now it was probably just really well worn in.
“I don’t know.” It was the honest truth. Sam didn’t think he could pin it down to one issue. “Systematic failure to communicate?” Sam ran a finger along the glass, drawing wavy lines in the condensation. “Have you ever been in love with an ex?”
Sam sat down next to Dean on one of the couches. Jody clearly entertained enough that she had so many seats free.
“What do you want me to say, Sam? You were engaged for over ten years with no wedding. Clearly things weren’t all that great.”
Unsure what to do with himself, Dean traveled back to see his folks for a little while. He told them the film had gone well, but production had been so troubled he wasn't sure if it would ever make it to release.
Heaven or Hell should have had first dibs to Dean’s soul, with neither option worrying Dean given who was in charge. He knew though that if he didn’t end up in either of those places, he’d just be booted out to Purgatory, something they’d all agreed no one wanted. The Empty wouldn’t touch Dean even if they begged, leaving just Purgatory to contend with.
“And besides, cowboys have always been more of Dean’s thing,” Cas commented, kicking off his slippers and settled into bed. “In fact this one time he-”
Dean rubbed his eyes and sat up in his bed, running his hand over his dishevelled hair.
“This place is pretty cool though. It was worth coming here to see. Feels exactly like it was from the early 2000s. That’s kind of my aesthetic.”
“But then I was a cowboy, Dean. And that was where it got really strange. Ruby was there, but she was dead, well, again. And then I had a horse. I rode the horse!”
. Talked about the future, what we wanted. Just turned out it wasn’t the same thing.”
The kid pouted and tried a bit more of the beer. “Yeah, you warned me. I just thought it’d be cool to try something, you know,
“What about dinner?”
“Leave Sam to Freud and come drink your coffee in bed,” Dean mumbled into his pillow, tapping Cas’ side of the bed.
“Would you prefer I use the term oral sex? Oral making love, maybe?” Castiel teased.
Dean feel asleep soon after.
"New?" Sam snorted. "It's like 40 years old now."
“Very good,” he praised.
Castiel kept stroking Dean’s hip with his thumb.
“Ha, the luck of the child star,” Donna laughed, before catching herself. “Sorry, sorry, that sounded awful. I just mean, it must be nice having the cushion of your past films to fall back on?”
Castiel's steps were shaky as he led Dean to the shed. Blood distribution happened at the most inappropriate moments to him.
“Yeah well, imagine the fun you’ll have sharing the experience. Not many people get to try authentic beer, from before the scientists got their hands on it.”
“Do you even have a CD player now?” Dean looked around the half-packed apartment.
Castiel brushed a thumb over Dean’s lips, rubbing the small amount of cum left around Dean’s lips into his skin as if it was lip balm.
"I have to finish a draft of my new novel today, which means I'll be in my study. If something urgent does happen please feel free to call me over the kitchen intercom.”
“Why?” Castiel questioned quickly. “You're a well known, seasoned actor.”
“It was... a new experience for me too,” Castiel said forlornly. “Much different to anything I've done before.”
“We’ve got to wrap things up soon,” Castiel Ten reminded everyone. “The time devices will only keep us here for the next 15 minutes before we’re dragged back to our own time.”
A happy Dean meant a good life for all of them. If that meant Sam had to help fit hooks and pulleys to the beams of the bar, he’d be happy to do so.
“What is it?” Cas asked again, confused as to what could cause such a reaction in his son.
not this soon–”
Thursday arrived at a crawl. At times Castiel was certain the world was teasing him by creating invisible hours to slow down the progress of the week. His novel was coming along well though and he was very pleased with the scene involving cream, edible glitter, and six ice cubes.
“Fine... fine. Call me next time or somthin', alright? So I don't have to be calling you. I ain't seen you in months now, and then this.”
Damn Sam for being reasonable.
“There was a damn breeding bench in Castiel's character's house.”
Dean swallowed. “No. I came clean, and I’ve been working so hard for you. I think I’m...”
“If your morning was anything like it was when I appeared here as Six, you’ve already had your share of fun today,” Castiel Seven argued back.
Castiel rolled his eyes but leaned in to kiss Dean soundly, mingling their breath together for a moment, the pistoning action stopping so they could share in these other sensations completely.
“Sure, sure, Sammy, that’s…” Dean trailed off. He was looking at the mirror on the bedroom wall. His mirror, he supposed, in his new bedroom.
Castiel’s brain supplied.
A centaur with a unicorn horn.
“It differs as Dean usually picks at random.”
“I just... don't want you to think I'm taking advantage of you.”
Dean was on his knees in front of Castiel, mouth currently wrapped around Castiel's erection, fisting the base with his left hand, while his right hand rolled Castiel's balls and stroked along his taint every now and then.
“We can't! Or at least, I can't,” Donna argued.
“How? Why would an empty room help with that?”
“It never mattered much to me either way, the concept of being with someone didn’t appeal. And then,” Castiel sighed, “then I fell.”
“So you do the film work in between?” Dean wondered out loud.
cook thanksgiving dinner.”
“Just my uncle, no need to worry.”
“Still, that's in six months, why are we doing press
“He,” Claire kicked the man’s already prone leg, “said it was something to do with adding to you all going along with it. If you were separated, you woke up. Each time you woke up he just put you back under with new situations. The last one went on for a few weeks, apparently the longest. I got really close one time to finding you all, so he moved you.”
Sam shrugged one shoulder. “Not hating it.” Though he hated how after only a week at Dean’s place he felt like he was moving through molasses all the time. His brain didn’t feel sharp like it used to. At first he’d put it down to fatigue from the move, but several days on, it just felt a lot like apathy.
“A touch, yes.” Castiel couldn’t remember the last time his answer to this question had been any different.
“I ain't got the proper response to that, Dean,” Bobby said flatly after a moment.
“Really?” Dean sounded so hopeful that Castiel’s heart blossomed with joy.
He gave a sizeable tip to the bartender once their drinks were set before them.
“You know your brother talks about you all the time. Big city lawyer and all, and all your fancy degrees.” Coming from anyone but Garth, Sam might have felt slighted at the phrase fancy degrees, like they were getting a dig in. From Garth though, Sam could only feel bashful at the praise.
“I love that you were still jealous.”
“I dunno, his work schedule’s been a little crazy lately, and then things with Jack and his dad.”
did for vampires.”
“I was in New York for four years at one point, my sister was at college there and I ended up hanging about.”
Dean couldn’t muster the words for how much he loved Castiel for thinking of this. For knowing him so well. His only response was to blush and duck his head, too overwhelmed to be able to voice his feelings properly. Castiel Three let out a growl as Dean clenched around him. He pulled out before his orgasm hit though, saving himself for Dean’s mouth.
Standing up, Sam reached for the ceiling and stretched out his back. “Whole point of you coming down was to help me pack, Dean.”
Sam knocked on Dean’s bedroom door almost politely a few times before finally giving in and barging his way in.
Dean placed a hand on Sam’s shoulder and squeezed gently. “You got this.”
Sam fiddled with the cloth napkin in his lap.
And it was. Castiel had to do a lot of research to get things
“Yup.”
Slowly all the actors decided the best place to go. A couple of calls were made to invite members of the crew various people had befriended. It was probably about as close to a wrap party as they were going to get.
“Yes, multiple times. I read from one of your books nearly every night.
“Yeah,” Sam answered, trying not to show his panic. Castiel seemed perfectly at ease in the kitchen. Almost like he hadn’t just tracked Sam down and was currently standing in his Dean’s kitchen.
“What?” Castiel said, confused. He turned on the bed to face Dean. “No 'but'. I liked it... I really liked it,” he added shyly.
Being the King of Hell didn’t feel anything like Sam assumed it would. They came to him with problems and he made decisions, found solutions. Sometimes over new-soul allocations, other times over who was allowed overtime or just how many paper napkins they needed to order.
“Can we agree we can’t both just quit now?”
the longer he sat on the throne.
Sam waved his hand about. “That’s for you two to decide. But I do know, if he takes this self-exploratory thing much further, he’s going to be trying to fit a bar stool up his ass, cut his dick off just to,” Sam hissed through his teeth and threw his hands up. “I don’t know, but he’s going to get more extreme somehow when the virtual stuff stops giving him his fix. He can’t die, Cas, but he can still suffer.”
The man had a solid build, broad shoulders, beautifully ruffled dark hair, and eyes that Dean wanted to study for a long time.
“I love you, too,” Dean breathed, eyes closed as he tried to stop the tears from falling. “I love you so damn much.”
“If you want some advice? Real advice? No one really knows what they’re doing in life. You can only take on the situations as they come to you, in the best way that you can at that point. Changing your mind about your future doesn’t invalidate any of the work you did in the past, and it doesn’t mean it was pointless, Sam. It doesn’t mean you didn’t want that at the time.”
“How long do you have this room for?”
“Huh.” Now Dean looked more impressed. “And that was how they got into that museum back in Houston to steal those angel gadgets,” he concluded. “Did you manage to get back the amulet and Stick of Destiny too?”
Castiel blinked. “The food? But all these people taking off clothes, indulging you in your favorite kink and--”
“I just… I had no idea.”
Sam Winchester, 14x01
“You’re still coming tonight, right? Mom invited you?” Dean was oblivious to the quiet freak out Sam was having. “It’d just be nice for you to get to know Sam.”
“We can buy them for each other,” Castiel explained to Jack. “Same with Ben’s moms, or any of the moms and dads. You can buy them for yourself too. Though, Dean doesn’t like flowers, I think I’ll get him something else. What do you think Dean might want?”
“You gonna finish those fries?”
“And then I tell everyone on Zeely how much I love it, and then suddenly others are coming to try it. The circle continues. The drink sucks, but no one wants to admit they spent so much on something sucky.”
Castiel thought a second. “Sometimes. If I’m not picking up on things quickly enough, then you should be more direct. You deserve all the pleasure I can give you, Dean. And no matter how much I try, I am not always good at noticing subtle hints.”
“Th... th... thank you,” Dean shivered.
A couple of weeks before Dean had started doing his yard work too, Castiel had been in a bind trying to decide the sexiest job for his protagonist to have. Castiel’s mind had gone through the mill many times before he’d put the question to Dean.
“It is a big movie,” Castiel continued, “and we've not yet seen the finished article ourselves, but even without all the computer generated add-ons, I am already sure this will stand as the proudest piece of work I've been in. A marvel for our times, and a film people will be watching for years to come.”
Jack was crying and red faced when Castiel reached him. “Oh, Jack!” Castiel tried not to panic. Jack had been fine only 20 minutes ago when he’d gone to bed though. “Is it a virus?” Castiel asked Dean. “Should I get an ambulance?”
“Yes! Yes,” Dean gasped, fingers almost sore from how tightly they were gripping.
“I got beer, Sam, if you want one? German and cold.”
“I've been spending some time with one of the guys I shot the film with. But he had to leave today for Europe.”
The schedule this time around was more packed this time than it had been before Dean's mini break from the film. They had a variety of endings to film and then the pick-up shots of scenes filmed previously that hadn't come out well.
“Any preferences?”
Dean shrugged a shoulder and still with his eyes on the TV started talking.
He stood against the wall and let gravity drag him down until he was sitting, knees bent, heart heavy.
Clearly a giggly kinda drunk then, Dean thought to himself.
Castiel just couldn’t contemplate that whatever Dean had done could be awful enough he was moved to tears.
“Yes, sir,” Dean nodded.
Dean sat quietly and continued sucking.
“Don’t look so proud of yourself,” Dean muttered, not even looking up from his laptop as he continued to go through the essay he was on.
Cas swallowed, meeting Dean halfway. “Yeah.”
, question for Dean Winchester.”
“Very alive, I promise. Also very naked under this blanket, so, fuck off and let me sleep? Where’s Cas anyway?” He asked, looking to the empty side of the bed.
is the official term,” Bela cut in. “We need a trademarkable character. I need you to all get into the habit of calling the creatures this as early as possible.”
Anna had easily been able to negotiate her way out of the contract.
“Huh. I only follow hockey myself,” Donna admitted.
“Well,” Benny thought on this a moment, “better than nothing I 'spose.”
“Definitely. This can be a one time thing if you want, I’ll never bring it up again.”
Dean’s hands stalled for a brief moment. Yeah, the disappointment still hurt, but he wasn’t going to let it ruin the time he did get to spend with Cas or Sam. They were always apologetic, but it was never of any comfort to Dean.
Yeah, it sucked how much he missed Jess. And it sucked that their engagement was over and he’d effectively thrown away the life he’d spent so many years building, but being in the bar with Dean felt
This hadn’t been how he expected the end of all things to look.
Once Dean knew the truth, there’d be no more hanging out like this.
Sam laughed despite the sadness in his heart. It was a hollow feeling. He didn’t know in that moment to voice the love for his brother he had. Despite everything they’d been through, despite the fact they’d basically ignored each other for most of their adult years, Dean had still driven out to help him pack up his stuff.
“Although...” Castiel inserted a second finger, also on his right hand. “I don't hear much begging, now I think about it. A little whore like yourself,” Castiel paused a moment, to give Dean the chance to veto his language, “you're probably very good at begging, aren't you?”
The voice was coming from the gentleman sat beside him, which meant it had to be the elusive
“I’m Castiel Nine,” another stated.
things. It films in Canada...”
The demon in the back adjusted his tie and stuck his hand up.
“You know hair color has nothing to do with personality, right?” Sam carefully spun his fork to get some of the noodles on it.
“Hell yeah,” Dean laughed, slapping a thigh. “They had this apprentice once at the garage. Dad sends him out to buy tartan paint. Dude was out for six hours before he had to admit defeat.”
The day before his 91st birthday, a reaper had appeared to help Dean with his journey to the afterlife.
Kevin shrugged. “I wish I was. Shots of dicks? Sure. Female nipples? They were going to slap us with an R rating. Given that so much has already been made about the... nakedness, we had to keep it in somehow.”
, it kept Heaven and Hell from arguing where he deserved to end up. It kept harmony in the universe.
He helped Bobby out during his stay, doing as he and Sam had as children on their holidays: deconstructing old wrecks of cars for scrap, doing some inventory, fixing fences, whatever Bobby needed. It was the perfect way to clear his mind while he tried to figure what he wanted to do with his life after the film finished in proper. All he knew for now was that he wanted to completely finish his filming before he even started looking for a new project.
“Who is he?” Dean said sharply, trying his best to sit and failing.
“You really not going to ask?”
“As in, Hannah Allen, one of the studio heads.”
"From where? Angels-R-Us?" Jody crossed her arms and looked down at Dean.
Later on their discarded takeout containers were still on the kitchen table and the brothers had long since relocated to the sofa to watch
“Probably was for the best,” Castiel looked a little wistful. “Everyone seemed to get on so well. We'd never have gotten anything done,” he chuckled.
“And I love you,” Castiel returned, taking the opportunity to pump Dean full of cum.
,” Castiel informed them. “Do you have speakers installed in here we don’t know about, Dean?”
“I'm... fuck, you know I'm 37, don't you?”
“My tummy hurts,” Jack’s voice was small and his shoulders hunched.
“Things with Eileen are going really well.”
“There, there. None of this is your fault,” she comforted.
who has been a fantastic hand-holder throughout this experience. All remaining mistakes are my own.
right for the book, but it was ultimately very satisfying for the both of them.
“You think he’ll try and hurt us to get free of this place?”
“I think he’s in the kitchen, I could hear the coffee maker when I was walking over. But, Dean,” Sam made a pained noise, “I dreamt that you died, and then I married someone with a blurry face? I don’t even think it was Eileen. I don’t want to dream cheat on Eileen with a blurry person.”
Dean nodded and speared a meatball.
“Not, like, literally
Castiel moved in to kiss Dean.
“No, but I’ve lived much longer than you, and spent most of that not knowing happiness or the concept. And then I found you and Dean, and everyone else in our weird, perfect little family. At some point I figured it’s about time I learn how to be happy. Things aren’t perfect right now,” Sam snorted at the understatement, “but when are they ever? We’re together though.”
“Samsam? That’s unique. More so than Castiel perhaps.”
Dean was stuck awkwardly with the shirt half off, Castiel's hand placed warmly on his chest, and a burgeoning erection.
“Most of us tend to keep our clothes on at the start, but we will end up naked by the end.”
Castiel was already mentally trying to figure out what they’d need. A lot of towels, some water,
“Agreed,” Castiel chuckled.
He didn’t, and with that Sam put all three copies into the box of stuff to be donated.
“I get the last cookie because you slept with Cas.”
Dean pouted and took a long draw from his glass of milk, staring down Sam as he drank.
“That's the thing about life: you never know what's around the corner. Magic or mayhem, unless you are there, you'll never find out.”
“Oh.”
Dean had saliva coming out of the corner of his mouth. His jaw was aching and Sam was standing in the doorway to the playroom sighing as Castiel finally came hard down Dean’s throat.
, actually discuss their problems instead of things ending in a bloodbath. We’ve found a way to finally piece together the last of the plan,” Sam explained in a hurry, looking so proud of himself.
“I know that, but if I have a chance to say something I have to take it. I’m worried what is about to happen next week,” he took a shuddering breath. “I haven’t seen my Dean in two weeks and I miss him.
They'd later traveled to Sierra Leone so Castiel could take part in the charity project he'd help set up to build homes there. Getting to see a small part of Africa had been such an amazing experience. Dean had gone to bed each night excited like never before to see what the next day would bring. Every day felt like they were really accomplishing something to help people, with their very own hands.
Filming the movie had turned into nothing like Dean had done before. Sure, he'd done some green screen, but this? This was almost entirely that.
Sam shuddered. He was happy for them, he really was but he still picked up a crutch from the porch for added stability and set off towards town to kill some hours. And more importantly, get away from ever having to hear Dean’s orgasm moan. Besides, he had to think up what to say to Eileen next time he saw her.
That didn't mean Dean had any idea what he wanted to do with his life. So much of his time growing up had been these films that he'd never really thought about it. He'd been offered a few roles. Nothing had seemed right though. Dean's only direction in life was his strong desire to show that he was more than just some former child actor. Aged 22, Dean Winchester wanted to make a name for himself as more than just a kid.
No one denied the requirement for new angels.
“Is my favorite pizza boy going to play a visit?”
Castiel would have been lying to say the thought hadn’t occurred to him.
"You killed God, so now we need someone to keep the magic of this place together."
"I think that should work great. I gotta head off to class now, Mr. Cas. See you Thursday."
“You’re not interrupting,” Castiel affirmed, punishing Dean and addressing Sam in one swoop. Castiel frowned a moment. “You’re not due to be here until tomorrow, or we wouldn’t have brought our activities out to the garden.”
“It’s like, guh,” Dean hissed, his cock was now wet with precome. “Like this blast of happiness. Of knowing you want me so much you’re prepared to get naked in front of me.”
Dean shuffled in the doorway. "Sorry, I just didn’t want to worry you by invading your space."
“Practice makes perfect,” Dean quipped, wanting to leave the room and not think about the fact Castiel picked Sam over him in the dream world.
Sam pulled a face. “That’s awful.”
“Whatever it is, Dean, I’m sure we can discuss it and find a way to make it better.”
That caught Dean’s attention fast.
“We have an ending, don't worry about that,” their director Gabriel replied with a wink.
“And then I kinda, had sex with my horse? Because it was the reincarnated form of my dead wife?”
When Dean's arms started to hurt from clinging onto the headboard, Castiel disengaged just long enough for them to move about.
“I'll give you this much: damn entertaining film, son. It was so fucking crazy it must be genius,” John praised.
Castiel nodded solemnly. “Yeah. After
“Wine?” Jody offered, reading the somber mood of the trailer.
“Thanks,” she smirked. “So he gets paid to keep you under. Lured you in somehow,” she paused.
“That's so neat!” Donna exclaimed when Castiel eventually finished.
So that was why Castiel smelled familiar, it was the same smokey, rich fragrance that Dean had detected on the shirt. It also explained why Dean was the only one dressed so casually.
“So now the leader of their tribe is a male? Well that's progressive,” Jody shot back sarcastically.
He knew looking in the mirror that he used to have freckles when his skin was sun-baked and golden. But since he’d had to resign himself to staying inside, he’d lost that sunkissed look. He’d lost it all when Sam and Castiel created this place for him. It kept him alive, it kept him
Castiel raised his arm out, grip tight on the branch and moved to swing forwards–
“More like you're throwing money at a problem you should have foreseen,” Chuck grumbled.
Castiel hung up the phone. His mouth was dry and his heart beat erratic. He also was as hard as the wooden chair he was sat on. Lately Castiel had found himself going through lubricant like it was water. Both were just as necessary in Castiel's mind at this point. Without the lube he'd have rubbed himself raw masturbating to the thought of the faceless handyman that tempted his dreams every night.
“I can pick up some groceries tomorrow if you leave me a list,” Sam offered. It would give him something to do instead of worrying about how much he didn’t want to do the presentation for his second interview. The list was essential since Dean was apparently such a homemaker now and Sam didn’t want to be caught out buying the wrong kind of flour.
“You seriously know nothing about sport? What do you watch on TV? You do watch TV?”
“I kept having these dreams about Eileen while we were under. Didn’t really realize it was her, but once I woke up it all just fit together.”
Castiel's skin felt like addiction under Dean's hands. So smooth and soft. The water made it mesmerizing just to run his hands all over Castiel's supple flesh.
Their characters, Logan and Jess, had been orphaned at a young age and left in the care of their aunts. The first film started with the two brothers discovering their parents (top government scientists) had actually been murdered and that their deaths weren't accidents after all. The brothers sought revenge only to get their little pre-teen butts kicked. They then discovered that their aunts were secretly spies for the government, who had met and fallen in love - and later married - while in service together. The aunts trained up the boys, passing on their skills and remained as their mentors throughout the film series.
Dean laughed and faux moaned even louder than his real moan had been.
It was something Sam had been wondering. He and Dean hadn’t exactly been on talking terms when Dean and Carmen had split.
“You're so beautiful,” he whispered into Dean's ear.
Out of curiosity, on the plane trip back to LA, Dean Googled the film. A few sources had picked up that production was going poorly, that Anna had left, that the director was a novice to this format. To Dean's surprise, he read that Chuck had been
“Yeah, yeah. Fess up why don’t you?”
Sam woke up again only an hour later. That had been by far his most vivid dream yet. It had to be the wine he’d consumed at dinner, or the cheese? Cheese did that, right? He rubbed his hands together and tried to warm them up.
Sam wouldn’t come over once he’d finished his day in Hell and help Dean clean up Baby’s spark plugs. Not least because Dean hadn’t driven the Impala in so long he couldn’t remember exactly what the steering wheel looked like. He could remember the feel, of course, the wheel under his clenched fingers, the rumble and vibrations at his feet. The details though were slipping away as the decades went by.
Castiel took Dean’s hand and led him to the bedroom in reply.
Castiel rummaged through the bathroom cabinet for the ear thermometer he had in his first aid kit. He was walking back to his boys when he heard the unmistakable sound of a child vomiting.
“Did you just break up with your fiancée and move across the country too?”
crazy, Cas!”
Bar owner picked the music, patrons shut their piehole.
?” Donna interjected.
tempting. In the last few weeks since filming had been completed, he'd done nothing but indulge himself. Stopping for a coffee seemed like a perfect treat. Well, at the time. Now, bladder full of coffee, he had to sprint to the room he'd been pointed towards. Looking quickly through the rack, Dean grabbed a soft-looking orange t-shirt. Pulling his current shirt off, and yanking the other on, he sprinted (with direction given by harassed looking staff) to the waiting area behind the stage.
Dean nodded silently, body shaking slightly now from the strain on his toes. He loved being bound in a way that forced him onto his tiptoes, and Castiel did so love obliging Dean’s needs.
“This is more than I could have ever dreamed of, and we’ve barely gotten started.”
“I wasn’t exactly the greatest fiance.” Dean hadn’t ever asked what happened, what the final straw was. Sam had no easy answer to give and didn’t feel like going into it right there and then.
“Winchesters aren’t the only ones who can come back,” she said coyly. “Don’t think I crawled out of hell just to rescue your ass.”
“We’ll see.”
“You have more clothes to take off,” Dean shrugged.
did so well, they want to push the rating up on this.”
"You don't need to be, it turns out. We checked the rules and sub laws. Crowley made a few interesting administration choices when he was considering leaving Hell to Dean."
“Do you want me to blow you after this?” Castiel offered.
“Whatcha got?”
“Dean, why am I readin' that your new film's a horse porno? What the fuck?”
“We need to get you out of here. Alex borrowed some wheelchairs from the hospital we’re going to have to use to take you back, your muscles must be made of jello right now from all the relaxant he was feeding you.”
“Look!” Jack threw down the rest of the wrapping paper and held up the largest gummy bear Castiel had ever seen.
At 1pm on the dot there was a sudden burst of light followed by a dull thud: a second Castiel had materialized into existence. He stood to the side just in time for a third burst of light as another Castiel, followed by another, and another, and another, and so on until the room held nine Castiels in total. A long moment passed when Dean thought that must be all of them, but finally a tenth (and this time final) Castiel appeared in the library too.
There was a war going on between Castiel’s id and super-ego.
“Blonde or brunette?” Dean asked through a mouthful of spaghetti. “Or a redhead? Did little Sammy find a fiery red head to bed?”
Suddenly Dean couldn't stop himself and he'd grabbed the other man and kissed him thoroughly. All thoughts of the people around them fleeing his mind.
Dean whimpered as Castiel massaged Dean’s spent cock.
Castiel smiled lovingly at Dean.
“Just coffee for me,” Castiel requested.
“No!”
“I’ve told you I loved you before.”
, I know I've been drinking, but that has to be the alcohol talking, Cas. That makes no sense at all.”
“I...”
The virtual fantasies Dean had become accustomed too could trick his brain into feeling this sort of pain, but the technology of the day still wasn’t good enough to leave behind the physical marks Castiel could inflict on him. And beyond self-flagellation, Castiel was Dean’s best chance of feeling like this.
?” Donna gulped. “I've never had to do press junkets before. I just thought I'd have a little more time to prepare.”
“You gonna stop me?” Dean’s eyes creased with happiness as he teased his bedmate.
“But we love him, and he’s in pain.”
“How about after this... we, um...” he said nervously. Deep voice even deeper.
“I’m willing to try her pie.”
There was a pop as Dean removed the thumb from his mouth.
“Nothin' much. How's school?”
“I do live and breathe my work,” Dean pointed out between sweet kisses to Castiel’s neck.
was given to him by his agent. The script was
“They have an incredible underground theater scene. You need to go back and check out–”
"G'night Sam, Cas," Dean murmured a couple hours later, kissing his fingers and touching them lightly to the photo on his bedside table. He missed them some nights more than others. Mostly he missed them during the day. The long, long day. As fewer and fewer people were coming to frequent the bar, Dean started to wonder more often what the point was of staying open.
“I like that, how you say fuck,” Sam panted.
TV wasn't something he'd ever thought about.
“Just after six. I was contemplating waking you up in case you had somewhere you are meant to be.”
“That’s the sweet spot,” confirmed Dean, although no one in the room really needed verbal confirmation when it was clear to see from Dean’s huffy breaths his prostate was finally getting involved.
“We’ve been doing more than just this,” he said with a roll of his eyes. “You haven’t even seen the garden since we put in the pomegranate trees.”
He drained one glass entirely and poured himself a second.
“Some can. Not you though.” Sam sounded puzzled.
Sam nodded his head, agreeing but not really feeling it. He felt all sorts of numb, if he had to put a word to it.
“You want some help cleaning up, Jody?” Garth offered.
He was pale beneath the sheen of sweat, with scruffy black hair and a nose that had been broken a good couple of times.
“We got no idea either,” said Dean. “That they overpowered Cas as well? Something’s up.” He looked tired, but Sam could see beneath that was the level of exhausted Dean achieved when he was
Castiel turned to greet Sam, perking up a little at the sight of him.
“Airforce, actually.”
“Will you… will you spank me more?”
“You’re not really my type anyway,” Cas smirked.
“I can hear you talking you know,” Dean grinned and looked up at the chatty Castiels.
Sam ruled Hell.
“No problem. Jody said she’s serving at 7, we got a little time. Go wash your stank off.” Dean reached out and shoved Sam forwards. Sam stumbled a little but shot Dean an unamused look before heading to the shower.
“I gotta head out. I regret ever agreeing to teach first period,” Dean said as he shut his laptop lid. “How about I bring pizza back tonight? I know you’re not going to eat much all day with the schedule you’ve set yourself for this new book.”
“Maybe?” Castiel asked, walking in with a tray of soup. He was dressed in his underwear and one of Donna’s personalized silk bathrobes that read “D-Train”. Sam hadn’t asked why, he just assumed he was safer not knowing.
Castiel looked deeply into Sam’s red-rimmed eyes. After a moment of study, he seemed to accept what Sam had told him.
“I've also be curious to know – how did you get my shirt?” His eyes crinkled beautifully.
They all found themselves thankful they had a nurse in the family now to give advice on recovery. A nurse who had done a lot of extra reading, research, and discussing enough hypothetical with a resident at her hospital that Alex had said she worried they probably thought she was planning to put someone into a coma, not help them from coming out of one.
“When did you have time to do
“They were holding an open casting call for kids at my school. I was never very good in school, and when I heard I could bunk off class early to go to the audition, I was all for it. Sam decided he wanted to go too – even back then talking about how it'd look good on his college application. Not even ten yet and the kid was a giant dork.
“And then since they knew I'd been apprenticing Chuck, I was brought in to help,” he finished with a squeak. “I don't know why! I've never even written a screenplay before! I was mostly just writing blog entries for him about cats!”
Dean examined the plant before him. So healthy, so strong. "No problem. I've been told I’m good at handling
Dean sat in stunned silence for a while.
“Well... perhaps one of them. There's a TV series that looks interesting. About a guy who hunts
“When you were
Dean thought absently as he polished up the glass again.
“Don’t stop,” Dean pouted.
The rest of Castiel’s sentence got stolen by Dean’s lips pressing down on his own lips.
Time was slowly counting down until the big movie premiere. Within the next 48 hours Dean had to introduce Castiel to his family, but more worryingly, he'd have to finally sit through a screening of the movie.
The thought had been on Sam’s mind too, for longer than he cared to think about.
Dean rolled his eyes and slumped back on his bed, regretting ever answering the phone. If he angled his body just right the phone would stay in place over his ear and he wouldn't have to hold it and expand even more energy on this conversation.
“Why didn't you just go with him? Not like you have anything else to do here.”
Dean snapped up the raisin oatmeal off the plate. Sam would allow it, knowing Dean’s dislike for raisins was going to mean it wasn’t really a win for either of them.
“What do you think, should I mark up the other cheek too?”
“How about I take your bed for the night, Dean, and you two stay in here and talk like you clearly need to?”
, thought Dean with some relief.
“It wasn’t meant to last for all eternity,” Castiel added, voice strained. “None of this was supposed to last as long as it has.”
“S’not cheating if it is your dream, I think?” Dean pondered out loud.
“Thanks for inviting me tonight, Dean. I don’t think I realized how badly I needed to get out.”
“You have us.”
He felt cold and shivery, faint, but yet everything burned.
On the wrong day, when he was in a bad way, Dean would probably find a way to sacrifice himself for a cat stuck in a tree. Not that Sam was in a position to really judge.
“It is, Bobby. The horse porno thing is probably just the PR company trying to boost publicity.”
“I know. Just give me a second before I have to share you with the rest of the world again.”
“Ask what?” Dean mumbled through a mouthful of fries.
“And I with you. Would you like a bath before we sleep? After the bath we can watch the footage back.”
“Would I? Absolutely.”
“Yes, whatever, one of those?” asked Fergus Crowley, another actor Dean had been keen to work with upon signing up for the project.
The manuscript had taken twice as long to write since he kept having to stop to deal with not-so-little Cas.
Dean slammed the door to his back office and sank down into the desk chair, head resting in his hands as he tried his best not to smash up the office or cry.
“Your eyes roll back a little when you orgasm,” Dean said with a sly grin, forever fascinated every day at the new things he was learning about Castiel.
Sam stretched and looked over at Castiel. He was sat in the rickety chair, already dressed in the clothes he’d had on the night before.
“Oh, this is Cas,” Dean said by way of an introduction. “Cas, this is Sam. Baby brother, meet my best friend, and vice versa.”
Pie wasn’t really his thing but Sam didn’t want to be the awkward one out. He would have taken the grapefruit segments.
Sam’s heart was racing. He looked to both Dean and Castiel. Their mouths weren’t moving.
Castiel held tighter onto the warm body next to him, hoping that maybe, just maybe the kids would quieten down if he pretended things were okay.
Between the pain, irritation, and boredom at not being able to move like he was used to, Sam’s thoughts had been consumed mulling over what they’d experienced.
“I guess many hands really do make light work,” Dean chuckled as he stood naked before them.
“We have a couple of whizkids working for us to take lead on all of that, top of the line workers, revolutionary techniques. None of you have anything to worry about. We expect the film to be completed and ready within the next six months. I expect to see you all at the premiere in November.”
Dean pointed at the beer once she’d left. “You want the rest of it?”
“Why do you like this?” he had to ask, had to understand so he could do better by Dean in the future.
This should have been yet another warning signal to Dean, but he hadn't realized this yet.
? No need for that right now. You're making front page news.”
They were at another production meeting, their second after the failed first attempt. Key actors, Chuck, and Bela Talbot (who was there on behalf of the studio), were all sat around a large table.
“Yup.” Dean had a big grin on his face.
“You don’t sound very sure of that, Dean.”
“You don't know that, stop being such a grump.”
Dean stood up from the couch and looked around. He shut his eyes and span before pointing to a random Castiel. “You’re up first, slugger. Do you want me to strip now or…?”
“Goodnight, Dean.”
.” He sounded adorably aghast at the suggestion, but Castiel wasn’t going to let this drop now they had a solution so close to hand.
That being said: I cannot say that I hated it.
was his home. Not Kansas – not any longer.
“That’s just a fantasy. I like it when people behave well for me.”
“That’s okay, sweetheart. It’s my fault really for buying it for you.” Dean stroked the child’s hair so gently. “How about your dad helps you clean up, and I’ll make some special tea for you? Get that tummy feeling all better in no time at all.”
The flush of Dean’s right butt cheek made Castiel feel connected to humans in a way not much else could anymore.
“I knew it!” Benny shouted, slamming his hands on the table. A moment later he looked bashful at his own enthusiasm.
They kissed again, each holding the other tighter and tighter.
“Yeah… yeah.” Sam’s voice cracked and his grip on the five DVD cases he had in hand tightened.
Sam did not like the sudden glint of determination in Castiel’s eye.
“Fuu... fuck... Please, please... Cas... fuck me.”
True to his word, he then proceeded to vomit all over one of the supporting actors, including his script. Bits of puke remained in his beard as security dragged him off muttering and mumbling to himself.
Dean frowned. “I’m home normal time. You forgot what a clock looks like, Sammy?”
It was fun finding new places and things with Castiel. Fun because Castiel seemed to look upon everything as if it was so new to him and so precious, even though he was the one with much more world experience than Dean had.
Castiel allowed a small pout. “But you had fun.”
Pressing on before Sam could try to turn the conversation towards Dean's
“When are you handing over Hell to someone else, Sammy?” Dean spoke up, interrupting both of them.
“I wish I had that kinda creativity, brother,” Benny added.
“Yeah. Cas wasn’t there at the time, he wasn’t in my vision that time.” Dean frowned and rubbed his hands together. They still felt so cold and numb. For Sam it was more an issue with his feet. Castiel, meanwhile, was feeling it along his spine.
Dean shrugged, “I guessed it'd be something like that.”
“Dark,” Castiel laughed humorlessly. “The small town I was staying in had about two hours of sunshine a day that time of year.”
“I have to get some stuff packed to go. But if you're happy to run errands with me, I'd love to spend what time I can with you.”
Flicking through the script, Dean was happy to note much of the dialogue remained the same. He wasn't very sure what had actually changed in the film until he read a scene opening.
Dean and Castiel had found themselves alone in a booth at the back of the bar. Hidden slightly from the rest of the party who were mostly playing pool and drinking more.
“No,” Castiel gave Dean an indulgent look. “Not literally. You just look so happy.”
The thought had been on Castiel’s mind more and more. He’d flayed skin from Dean’s back during their last session, and as much fun as it was, Castiel’s doubts had started to creep in.
Amazon,” Bela further explained. “So we're going with a sort of generic rain forest. Chuck is still working on the details for that.”
“They've engineered it all. All the disasters, even down to Chuck's original script getting stolen.”
“HEY!” Dean shouted out. “Go away!” He stumbled a little on his tiptoes, unbalanced by Sam’s sudden appearance.
After a bit of stretching Castiel sat up as well, resting against the headboard.
Castiel choked on his juice. “You're 22?”
“Taking home a man you've just met today, and begging him to fuck you?”
Dean, now firmly awake however, felt nothing but nausea and dread.
“You know – and this isn’t a line, but you look strangely familiar.”
“You know what day Saturday is, right?”
“Mom!”
As Castiel loosened his tie some and then completely removed it, he observed Dean’s cock perking up even more. By the time he’d undone two of his shirt buttons, Dean was moaning lightly, thumb running lightly over the tip of his now plump, pink cock.
“Jump in a taxi now, go on. Fulfill that desire I'm sure you've always had to run after someone at the airport and declare your love,” Sam was laughing but Dean was quietly calculating in his head if it was too late for that.
different shirts this time.
“So, she slaughtered the lot of them and now they’re fighting. It was just three sheep to start with, then the grasshoppers got involved,” Castiel sighed as he finished his story.
Castiel stopped his movement by grabbing either side of Dean’s hips firmly.
“That would be wonderful. Let me have some alone time with Dean?”
“It’s locked!” he shouted at Dean.
Sam had no idea who Alex was but the others nodded like this made sense.
“I would have finished this last night if you hadn’t suggested we try that new shibari pattern.”
, he thought, burying his face into his pillow, crying, emotions swirling. He wasn’t feeling numb at least. Guilt  was coursing through his veins making his chest feel icy cold.
“Thanks. You’re really good with them.” Dean was so close Castiel could see even the faintest of Dean’s freckles.
“It's stupid because he'll be through security before I can get there. And...”
“Yes,” Castiel nodded. “But didn’t we always?”
“Anything, everything,” Castiel assured Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam fell back to sleep happily curled up with Eileen. Castiel went back to bed too, slipped his headphones on, pressed play once more and cuddled up with Dean.
Castiel was still in his slacks, shirt and tie. In fact, all he’d managed to take off in the time Dean had completely stripped was his socks and jacket.
Castiel nodded and took his trench coat off again. “Talking is probably for the best.”
“Grapefruit segments,” Jody said deadpan. “With a light dusting of protein powder.”
“Really?” Dean looked up beaming at Castiel.
“I…” Castiel shifted in his seat. “This isn’t about me.”
After eating Sam felt more refreshed and human than he had in a long while. More himself, at least. Castiel was a big part of that.
Charlie flashed a smile at her. “Empty threats, Jody. Where would I even get laxatives? It isn’t like they sell them in stores.”
“I need more.”
“I’m planning on being messed up over Jess for a long time. A long, long time. You’re safe with me.”
Sam took a deep breathe. “I got this,” he agreed. If only because he didn’t see that he had any other choice. “And Dean?”
Sam sat back and observed happily as Dean and Castiel talked. He caught his mom’s eye at one point and she smiled, laughing a little with a small head nod in the direction of each of Dean and Castiel.
“The air’s clean, right?” Dean grinned. “Smells amazing all year round. And if you look up there,” he pointed to the canopy of a small woodland section that had been started, Sam’s eyes followed the line of where Dean’s finger was pointing.
Dean laughed and ruffled Sam's hair. “Sure, Sammy. They're probably all over you to hear about your Hollywood film career.”
“That can't have been easy,” Castiel said, eyes full of concern.
She’d been cold to the touch, so real as well. He couldn’t remember why he’d been trying to reach out to her, but by the time he was there, she was gone already. The harder he tried to think on who she was, the more it hurt. Letting go, pretending it hadn’t happened, that was the only way Sam was getting through the days.
“No,” Castiel explained, “that was an article of furniture the centauricorns use to sit down on more comfortably. Or so they told me anyway.”
? The play about the guys who realize they have more to gain from their play
Sam blinked. “I, uh.” He put his food down. That wasn’t a connection he’d made in his mind. To him and Jess they’d been
Castiel shot Dean a worried look, now suddenly feeling nervous himself. Dean in turn took Castiel's hand in his own.
“Unfortunately not,” said Castiel. “But I’m not sure their intents were… malicious. They seemed more like collectors. Curious about angels and the supernatural. We talked for a time after I finally caught up with them, before they escaped.
Not many people would consider hanging out at Jody’s house, wrapped in blankets, and eating soup to be a vacation, the Winchesters had never been
“That’s… wow. That’s dedication.”
Stomach full of food and heart full of peace, Sam went to bed happy that night. Which was why he was so surprised that he felt so awful the next morning, almost like he hadn’t slept at all. One night of good times apparently wasn’t going to cure him of the melancholy taking over his soul.
“Yes,” Castiel nodded. “Same way that Dean’s socks really do smell and tomorrow we have to track down that collector, probably dodge some vampires. You know, the normal.”
. “He’s in trouble.”
“Urgh,
“I don’t know if I believe in love,” Castiel paused. “But I do know that I believe in you.”
“I think it’s your turn next, Five.” Castiel Four stood back and took some deep breaths to help level out his breathing again.
“Yes?”
countless layers of hand-applied lacquer bar.
“She left you.”
“He’s human and addicted to coffee now, not dead, not anymore. It was just a dream, go back to sleep.”
It was just, more often than not, even the good days weren't good anymore.
“Hey, listen up!” Jody was the one who had made the noise. “Since we're finally united, how about we all go out to dinner somewhere? Since we won't see each other again probably until the press tour?”
“Hey you two lovebirds,” Benny interrupted. Dean felt his cheeks heat up slightly.
Castiel ran his thumb along Dean’s lower lip and then slide it into Dean’s mouth past those luscious lips. Dean happily sucked on the offered thumb, always happier to be sucking on something when given the option. He wanted his mouth full more frequently than he wanted his ass full.
Dean was an excellent pool boy, or pool cleaner as Castiel kept reminding himself was the correct term. If he'd known Dean also did gardening, he would have never placed the ad.
“I could go for some pizza and wings,” Dean added.
Oh, and that his new star was a little known actor by the name of
Sam grabbed a section of his own hair, ruffling it. It took a few deep breaths before he could get out the question that had been haunting him.
When Friday swung around Sam thought about calling up Castiel to see if he was free. Just for a drink would have been a nice evening, but Sam’s resolve to not sleep with Castiel again was wavering even in his own mind. Just because he didn’t want to date the guy didn’t mean they couldn’t have fun. And they had definitely had fun together.
The reality of their lives struck again a couple of days later when they were finally back with their co-stars. The studio decided to split the groups into the humans and centauricorns for the press they had to do.
His heart, spirit, and (to his small grumble) cock all leapt when the doorbell finally rung at 1 pm.
“And again? Maybe a little louder?” he prompted.
“Yeah, same.”
Castiel’s thumb was gentle stroking over Dean’s stubble.
“I want you to finger fuck me, rough, hard, fast. Use a lot of lube. Like so much lube I can’t get clean without a shower – several showers. And then after, I want you to come on my chest.”
“I dunno, Dean. Not sure I can't see you doing the exact same thing week in, week out.”
“Yeah, yeah, but my kids were always massively into them.”
Bobby leaned over from his seat behind Dean.
Sam shrugged. “I think it’ll help save me, if I’m being honest. I’ve nearly forgotten, Cas, what humanity feels like. A garden would give me a rest as well. We have the power now to expand this safe zone outside of the walls of the building. To build a dome of spelled wards over the land so Dean can see the sunlight again. To let him go outside once more.”
Truthfully, he was just ad-libbing what Sam had told him when Dean called him in a state after the first day of filming with the same fears as Donna.
“I'm a 22-year old who has only ever appeared in films meant for pre-teens. Not some big blockbuster PG-13.”
“Er, yeah,” Dean admitted. “He makes me happy, Sam,” was the only lame retort he had.
“You wanna take this to the bedroom?” Dean suggested, playing with Castiel’s shirt buttons.
"Yeah? Sure you ain't pumping water from the fountain of youth back there?"
“It takes more than a few shots to get to me these days, um,” Dean swallowed nervously. “So long as you feel able to consent?”
"I try," he shot her a wide grin.
“I taught myself to pick a lock from a YouTube video once,” Castiel admitted. “I’d locked us all out of the house.”
“Sure do! Best gumbo on the delta. You should all drop by anytime.”
“You know why!” Dean shouted, standing up again and closing the space between them. “You fucking know why.”
Dean tensed a tiny bit. Castiel couldn’t see his eyes but knew instinctively Dean’s pupils were probably expanding. His pulse was quickening and his breathing rate increased. All in tiny, tiny amounts, but Castiel could still sense it.
“I've never spent all that much time in Canada. Sounds fun, we should make some bookings to look at houses in the area.”
The more he thought on it, the more sense it made. Thanks to Dean, Castiel had the cleanest pool for a ten-block radius. Other people might only have their pool cleaned every few weeks, but Castiel, who used the pool maybe twice a year, was sure to have his done sometimes four times a week. It just made him feel better for reasons he couldn’t put a finger on.
“Are you saying you’re not enjoying it?” Sam finally answered.
out with,” Sam said slyly.
“Dear Saint Jess,” Dean huffed.
“I will,” said Dean, trying not to sound too petulant. But he was tired, and Bobby
While he and Castiel were waiting for their luggage at LAX, Dean called his mom to let her know he'd gotten back safely from his trip. He'd vaguely told his parents before he'd left what was happening, separately begging Sam not to blow how completely gone he was on Castiel. His parents thought Cas was just a guy he met while filming and – based on his mom's teasing – maybe had a small crush on.
or somethin'.
His editor had been very happy with the final manuscript though and the book had finally been published two weeks prior. Just thinking about the book made Castiel think he deserved a treat. He hadn’t ordered takeout pizza in years and it seemed a suitable celebration for the new book’s success.
“So you have all these rooms to yourself?”
Their trust and faith in him was embracing, but Castiel wondered sometimes if it wasn’t also misguided.
“Sex is mostly about the physical sensation to me. But you wanted to talk, I don’t see how talking about my sexual antics is helping.”
“S’that you, Sam?” Dean called out.
He was introduced to Charlie and Ash, the special effects geniuses who were going to be fixing up all the computer generated stuff.
“Did people really use to drink this?” The kid looked up at Dean with great disgust. “Three thousand dollars for a genuine-recipe 21st century beer, and it’s
Sam watched as Dean and Castiel locked eyes.
“This ugly mug can fend for himself. Don’t feel bad for him. Plenty of food at home.”
Sam let out a huff of a laugh.
Dean sat back, the mood slowly petering off now. “What do you mean what? I told you–”
Dean was in love.
“Thanks,” Dean said sweetly, kissing Castiel on the cheek.
“When are you due to hear about that job again? I hope it is soon so I can get you out of this place.”
Dean stuck his head in the fridge. “I forgot how much you ate, Sasquatch. How about I order Chinese?”
“I think I'd like to hear you beg.”
“Uh, guys, hi,” he waved.
Dean let out a strangled noise. “But Cas, that was, I mean, I won’t, I
Anna dipped her head in acknowledgment of the kind words.
To Castiel’s relief Dean turned out to be competent, efficient, and even artistic when it came to doing yard work.
“Yeah yeah, well he had the biggest dick of us all.”
Bobby, his uncle in every way but blood, lived just a few hours from Dean's parents. He ran a junkyard and was an essential part of why Sam and Dean had been able to grow up so level headed.
,” Dean winced. “So very, very ew.”
“Thanks for coming up, it… it means a lot.”
“We'd like to take this opportunity to open up the floor to questions, so we can share with you some of the behind the scenes antics from this
Dean worked all his magic to get Castiel hard enough again before breakfast so that he could fuck Dean. Dean asked for Castiel to go hard, so hard Dean would be able to feel it for days.
“They based them all on reality,” Benny told her.
Dean bit his lip and hissed a little when Castiel took advantage of the slightly chilled air and tweaked his own right nipple.
“Oh.” Dean felt so downhearted. Though he was sure part of him knew this little bubble he'd been existing in with Castiel the last 24 hours couldn't continue indefinitely.
“He’s in love with you, you’re in love with him...” Sam looked between his brother and Castiel, silently imploring them to just get over whatever this block was.
Dean couldn't help but instantly like Charlie and Ash. They were warm, funny, and obviously crazy as all hell for willingly getting involved in the film.
Jody, Donna, Garth, and Charlie.
“That’s understandable, Dean. I’m not feeling completely myself again yet either.” Castiel looked down and could see Dean’s cock was still pretty hard, outlined nicely in the pajamas he had on. “Though…”
“The equipment was running through all of you initially,” Donna explained.
“No offense meant, Dean,” he hiccuped, holding onto Donna now like a baby koala.
“No,” Castiel smiled down at him indulgently, cock still moving silky-smooth and oh so very fulfilling.
Jack drank it without complaint and was soon drifting off to sleep. Castiel kept reading until Jack’s breathing had evened out.
“That’s your entire plan? Just pick to be happy?”
“How do you always end up naked before me?”
It wasn’t the most traditional of beginnings. But then what was traditional about the story of an angel and the human he’d once rescued from hell?
Castiel lent back in his chair, amazed. “That's so cool. So really you had the rude child to thank?”
“A bit, I've been able to stage a few productions now. Nothing big, of course, but fairly well received so far.”
Since none of them still knew the movie ending or really the plot in general, they had to distract reporters trying to ask them about the film with other stories. Donna also talked about a new TV show she was on – something that made Dean feel very relieved to hear about. At least one of the other actors involved would get out of this mess alright.
Sam whooped down the phone. “I knew you had it in you!”
“Yes.”
“Sam is still on his case I believe, and we do need to catalog the items we find, but yes, I would like to grope and make out with you in the storage room.”
Castiel stalled suddenly. “Um, are you okay with dirty talk?” He'd gone back to his normal voice instead of the sultry tones he'd been using.
“Ha, yeah,” Dean replied, amused. “That was a fun evening. Probably for the best the studio didn't film us altogether after all I bet considering how much we drank.
“Love? Companionship? I don’t know, stop me if I’m getting too crazy with my list.”
“Eh, I’m okay,” Dean shrugged off. “Sorry about the gummy.” They’d grabbed what was left of the gummy bear on their way of of Jack’s bedroom. The kid had somehow managed to eat almost half of it in the short time he’d been left alone with it.
He knew he shouldn't have stopped for that coffee, but it had just been
Or my general fun-filled account
"Magic? I can't do magic." Or rather, he probably could, but didn't want it at the cost it came with. Sam tried his best not to remember the feeling of power he used to have with the demon blood in his system.
“Nah, I get it, I'm no Anna Milton,” Dean sighed.
“It doesn’t count if it is on in the background while
commandments. They’d set it up so no one questioned why Dean never went outside. So no one outside questioned why the building was there. No one would ever try to knock it down for redevelopment, or even build too close to it.
“It has to be you, Castiel. You’re the only one of us originally from this universe.” Hannah’s form was so different to any of those she’d inhabited in this universe.
“You’re just saying that because I’ve got my mouth on your cock.”
Sam chuckled some more. “Well, why not?”
“That’s… that’s...” Dean sat down on the couch behind him. He looked up at the still standing Sam and Castiel. “That can’t be true.”
“I'll miss you,” he whispered in Dean's ear, hugging him tightly.
They both sprang back away from each other when Dean and Mary came back to the table.
Sam excused himself to the bathroom after. He looked in the mirror while washing his hands and noticed he was smiling.
“Can you go pick up the U-Haul, Dean?” Parking being what it was on his street, Sam hadn’t wanted to get the thing any earlier than necessary. He didn’t want to trust Dean with finishing off the packing though.
“What!?” Sam asked in disbelief. “Er, no?”
The light around her was so intense. He wanted to lift his hand to shade his eyes. He couldn’t though, he couldn’t seem to move anything below his shoulders.
,” Castiel stressed.
“I wouldn't expect it any other way, Becky,” Dean said glibly into his microphone.
, that’s the one thing we’ve infused in the walls of this place.”
“I don't do nudity. I have a strict clause about it.”
“Why thank you, Dean,” Castiel said through gritted teeth, jaw clenched, muscles sleek and proving their power.
? Who the fuck thought
“Yeah, yeah, I can.” Dean slid off the table he’d been sat off, looked around for his keys. His hand hovered over them before he looked guiltily up at Sam.
Dean didn’t blush, he wasn’t sure he had the ability to feel embarrassed anymore about his desires. That didn’t mean he wanted Sam to know all his business, though.
Shamefaced and distraught, Dean could only nod his head and refused to look up.
In the back of his mind Sam was thinking about times in the past. Times he wouldn’t have dared ask this of Dean. When his first question would have been
Dean licked his lips and went in for a second almond pastry.
He was stiff from all the packing and the focus on getting things done. It felt surreal locking the door up and hiding the key on top of the door frame. He wouldn’t have normally ever done that, but given the apartment was empty, and this way he avoided a last awkward goodbye with Jess, he was prepared to let it slide.
, exactly what Dean had been looking for. It was, Dean had to admit, another action film, but the action took place in the Amazon. It was about saving the last of the rain forest, set in a universe where all but a small section had been destroyed.
“I understood that, but I just wasn’t sure about how effective spanking was for… that kind of thing. That people could really, you know, from spanking.”
When he still hadn't had a call from the studio asking him to go back to the film, Dean decided to make his next stop his Uncle Bobby's place.
want you to be happy, and safe. Mostly safe.”
“Oh?” His grip on the headboard was white-knuckled and yet he was managing to fake nonchalance so well. Castiel knew he had to do something about that.
“Sometimes a good clean out is just what you need.”
Dean couldn’t stand up. His wrists had been cuffed behind his back to his ankles, forcing him to keep the kneeling position he’d been in for the last… Well he wasn’t sure how long. Hours, days, weeks? Time passed so oddly now.
Sam didn’t add that it would be better for himself and Castiel too if Dean was in a good mood more often. The bar had come to mean so much to him, it was his place to unwind from all the antics of Hell, and he was sure Castiel felt the same way.
“You feel so good,” he murmured against the warm skin of Sam’s neck, kissing and nuzzling, breathing in Sam’s scent.
“It isn't that many,” Dean defended, feeling suddenly on the back foot.
“Really?” Dean raised an eyebrow. “Cas has never watched a game in his life.”
“And if I want it to change?” Dean moved a touch closer. “What if I don’t want to spend any more time feeling like I’m wasting an opportunity?”
Dean didn’t look
“It was just a dream!” Sam now felt highly defensive.
. Like I'm not just this awkward man who has never managed to settle down. As if my experiences actually have meaning.”
“Your level of disturbed,” Dean mumbled under his breath.
“Oh definitely. You've broken me, Castiel,” Dean uttered softly. “My poor ass aches for you now.”
Dean nodded again, still too embarrassed to talk.
“I... you said, I must beg a lot? I don't, I don't do this a lot.”
“We’re immortal, Sam, and I’m still technically an angel. If we can’t get a little biblical every now and then, who can?” Cas said while helping Dean into his own robe.
This was still one of his good days, he reminded himself. And that thought alone made the pain in his chest radiate fiercely.
“Depends on your definition of sexy,” Dean told Castiel philosophically. They had sat down to enjoy a quick snack before Dean had to leave for more classes. That he worked jobs back-to-back between classes was why Castiel had started insisting on feeding him. The guy needed someone to take care of him before he worked himself ragged. Especially now when he was so close to graduating.
“What? No, no, I like the food at the strip clubs. Good food.”
“Yeah?” Sam was hanging onto Dean's every word.
“You should try it, it’s useful.”
Dean turned back around to look at Sam, one leg in his car as he rested both arms on the top of the open door. “Yeah?”
Dean moved down to take off Castiel's condom, tying it up and chucking it in the bin. He moved the sheets so they could both get under and then curled into Castiel's side.
who provided all the beautiful art here. The
He paused before he undid any further buttons, just taking in the sight… and maybe trying to tease Dean a little.
They did, but Dean has a proven track record with meeting Castiel's exacting standards.
“You can’t get your money back,” Dean said firmly, knowing exactly where this was going. It wasn’t even like $3,000 was even all that much these days. “You signed the waiver, remember? I told you the historic stuff was nothing like what they serve now.” He was a bit put out since he was also brewing the beer himself and it wasn’t a bad batch, if he did say so himself.
“Would you… would you like to come in and share some pizza with me?” Castiel’s skin was tingling.
“Yes!” said Bela joyfully. “And you are our leader in their war.”
“Just Sam,” he laughed, unsure if Castiel was being serious. Sam found himself thinking that he couldn’t seriously be contemplating sex with a man who he didn’t even want to give his name to, could he?
He was, Dean discovered with delight, just as much fun outside of the hotel room as he was inside it. They spent their days shopping as Castiel picked up an eclectic shopping list of things he needed for his trip. At the same time, they got to see a side to the city Dean would never have thought to explore.
“Last few years, every time I spanked the monkey–”
“That means...” Dean’s gaze hardened. “You and Cas
“Turn over, grab the headboard,” Castiel replied after studying Dean and the bed. He sounded firm and Dean realized he kind of liked it. A lot.
