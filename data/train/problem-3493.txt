I turn to look at the Angel who stood up for me. Her female vessel is small and slender, and her short hair is tangled in wild curls. For all her heart-shaped face, she's exuding dignity and raw power. Purple and veined with orange, her three eyes are staring at me dispassionately.
Anael nods in agreement, crossing his four arms. With a graceful motion of his hand, Balthazar sprinkles trickles of his Grace in the air, twisting and shaping them into bright diagrams, charts and the long list of chosen Humans. Ephra squints and leans forward to read the standard formulation glorifying the name of God in every line.
I have never traveled back in time before in my entire life. And while I know how to do it in theory, like any Angel of my rank, I've never had to actually practice it before. It's unsettling. And to think that at this exact moment in the timeline, I am in Hell on a wild-goose chase while the righteous man is breaking the first seal... If I had known then what I know now...
Jesus' most devoted disciples are slowly coming out of their trance as their memories are restored to normal. They stand frozen in horror among the heinous crowd shouting for blood and death, especially those who had never heard of Jesus before.
By raising the righteous man from Hell, I thought I was saving him and offering him a new life, a second chance, but it turns out that all I did was play my part in bringing tragedy upon his family. Tragedy orchestrated by God down to the last detail. Both Hell and Heaven are striving to deceive him and make him suffer. He will probably not know peace until he dies. But then, will he have collected enough happy memories to rest for eternity? I hope so. Dean deserves to find serenity and felicity.
"His father held out a whole century and he wasn't even the man of the prophecy," says Ephra. "So why wouldn’t this one make it too?"
A hint of fear flashes through the governor's eyes as he sees the vociferous masses clamoring for my brother's blood with increasing fury.
"I have not been watching the Humans as closely or for as long as you have, but from what I have observed of them since their creation, I already know that Jesus' message won't be understood."
in my life. 'Cause yeah, that odd beginning of friendship in Purgatory with a dead vampire that wants to ride my body to escape and do whatever he plans to do, this is the most normal and healthy relationship I've ever lived. My life is so fucked up.
At our feet, the young woman is struggling and panting to draw water from the well. She pours it into her jug, then wipes the sweat from her forehead. Her long brown hair is all tangled, and her linen dress covers her pale and clearly malnourished body. Her eyes are sad as she looks up to the sky.
When we get there, the meeting room is very quiet. The General is standing with her four hands flat on the table and her head down. Which is not a good sign.
"Uriel is quite good at drawing information from demons," I argue in a hoarse voice, "along with his undeniable destruction skills. He will make Alastair talk."
"Once you have regained your strength all of you will go back to search for Camael. I will ask for back up immediately."
When I reach them, I keep my eyes set on the righteous man who is holding a dagger behind his back. He glares at me with defiance and disbelief. Any other Human would probably have dropped to their knees or been overcome with fear. But Dean is no ordinary Human, and his gaze doesn't waver. He acts like a soldier, cold-bloodedly.
My brethren promptly do as Anna commanded and disappear. Down on the ground, the executioner has stopped his whipping, but now the guards are mocking my brother, dressing him in a scarlet cloak.
My sister's voice sounds somewhere between confusion and amusement. She materializes into physical reality, her white dress brushing against the Human's motionless hand.
Laughter ceases and silence falls. Pmox is staring at me wide eyed. Balthazar's composure wavers just for a split second before he pulls himself together and makes what looks like a military salute, most likely inspired by Humans.
"I know what we've been ordered to do, Uriel," I say without taking my eyes off the demon. "But I want to know who's leading them, now that Azazel's dead."
"Well well, Cassy..." His smile draws thin lines at the corner of his eyes. "There's quite the hype going on about you, you know, you're all over Heaven's big news. The simpletons from the Wind Division have been harassing me with questions about you."
There is something intense and deeply unsettling about her unblinking gaze, as though she is expecting
"My name is Inias. You may not remember, but we crossed paths after the Flood, and I was also there to support you and Camael at your trial…"
"You're right. But the Council thinks that we won't be able to get a confession from Alastair. They are currently discussing the possibility of recruiting Dean Winchester to do the job."
With these words, she opens her wings wide so that they fill the entire room and even extend into the walls, then she disappears in a silky rustle of feathers.
I hold out my arm in one swift movement, focusing my energy on the hilt of the dagger shoved into his chest, and make it rotate in the wound as I reach out to all of the Garrison soldiers this time.
Today, I can hardly enjoy the peace and quiet of the place. I'm not alone under the warm sun rays. Slender and pale, Baradiel is standing there, staring at me unblinkingly. His vessel's face is set in that same melancholic expression frequently found on statues sculpted by Humans. Only the blazing glow of his true eyes is moving like lava. He is ready for action, just like me.
Indeed, there is a door slamming, and I slowly stand up again. In the house, the television immediately turns off. The blond woman pauses in the doorway, her arms full of groceries, blinking in surprise.
I look down at one of the sacred books resting on a chair, and spot one of the tomes I've already read in the library. The cover illustration features a bloodthirsty pagan god that the Winchester brothers succeeded in slaying - the story had been so compelling that I had actually feared for their lives even though I was aware that they had survived it.
"I was opposed to it." Gabriel throws me a sharp look. "A good old-fashioned execution would have been neater and faster. I was the one who gave Camael the idea of the seal he used on Cain, so it's partly because of me that he's in this situation today. Tearing an Angel's Grace off and shoving it into a Human's uterus? And making him a Messiah so the Humans will worship Dad by following a bunch of rules? I love my brothers, but there are times when I have this overwhelming urge to bang their heads together..."
Cas searched for Dean's mind, trying to assess his mental state, making sure he did not do anything stupid. But Dean's mind was simply numb. He was in his room, probably on his bed, staring at the ceiling.
Sam had retreated a few steps behind the table in the main hall. “I didn't believe it either, but this man is going around looking like you, repairing cars.”
It took a moment for Sam to realise what Dean had just said. “I guess, they got to know each other pretty well,” Sam replied.
Their foreheads gently touched and all Dean could feel now was his angel breathing on his skin, because Cas could.
Sam was out of the car in no time. He slammed the door a bit too hard, looking at Cas to read him for instructions, but Cas just slightly shook his head. Sam exhaled. Cas just needed him closer. He nodded but entered the bar anyway.
Mike let his head fall to Dean's side, connecting with his brother's head. Sam watched them from afar, breathing hard, leaning at a nearby tree.
Fifteen minutes later they were on the road; the engine of baby purring under them. Mike was in the back with Cas, slowly calming down by just sitting in a car he was familiar with and the soothing presence of the family's angel. He even closed his eyes. He was drifting into a semi sleep while involuntarily reaching out for Cas' hand like an anchor. Cas let him, remembering that he was able to breathe, if he wanted to.
The shop was open, as usual. Dean could hear music from two houses prior. What in God's name was Mike listening to?
Mike's face underwent a mental journey, running through a list of possibilities. He was seating himself in the driver's spot, bouncing a bit, moving pedals and flipping at displays with his finger. Cas soon found himself mesmerized by Mike's movements. For the split of a second he forgot the man was not Dean. He felt himself soften in his presence, then startling when he caught himself doing so. Mike, mercifully, did not perceive any of this.
“... until we find out who you really are.” Sam added but smiled. “Are you okay with meeting him, in a neutral surrounding of course, for all our sakes?”
Dean thought about it, eyeing Cas who did not convey any underlying message. “You two get along well,” he said.
Mike suddenly looked at him, like really looked at him. Cas squinted his eyes. He felt something strangely familiar coming from this look.
Cas was beaming at Mike. “Thank you,” he just said and licked the tip of the cone. He closed his eyes, trying to get anything else but the taste of molecules. The whole scene looked way too intimate for Dean. He snapped his mouth shut and left the kitchen immediately, locking himself away in his room, trying to calm down.
Zachariah himself replies instead of Balthazar. His voice rises in the reverent silence of the soldiers who are unaccustomed to standing before such a high-ranking Angel.
My soldier spreads his wings and disappears immediately, leaving his batrachian on my desk. I share a long look with it. Its eyes are glassy and there's something about them that is making me uncomfortable.
There is a rustling of feathers at my left, and Uriel lands on the ground, his eyes riveted to the city where Humans are moaning and groaning.
"I have to move on to the next area," the Angel of Fertility says with a hand gesture, before spreading his wings and flying high up in the sky. The swarm of Cherubs immediately follows him to the skyline, fast as lightning. Hester follows them with his eyes until they disappear away.
All Angels, Archangels and Cherubs are here. The Garden of Eden is crowded with Angels as far as the eye can see, around a million of them at the very least.
"Uriel has been wanting a celestial revolt for thousands of years, he merely radicalized his methods. I came to protect you as soon as I found out what was going on in the Garrison."
Amplified by the unique acoustics here, his voice carries strongly inside the Opera, and behind them the soul keeps dancing, too absorbed in her memory to even notice anything else. This is what happens to all souls in Heaven, with a few exceptions - like Ash - who wake up from their state of happiness to regain consciousness, until the assigned Angels force them back into their memory.
He points at the couch with his chin, and Brap rolls his eyes and sighs loudly before drawing back his legs and sitting down properly to clear a place for me beside him.
"You don't fool me!" Siosp bursts out with rage, gesturing wildly at the fire all around. "No Creator would allow His work to be destroyed! If God existed, He would never tolerate this!"
The four of them unfurl their wings and fly away, leaving the Garrison alone in the courtroom. Anael turns to Camael.
"We are currently inside the Paradise that will from now on be our rallying point. This is where you will all submit your reports, receive orders and attend meetings. Except for the Garrison and the Animal division whose mission is directly linked down there, you will no longer walk the Earth and be around Humans without an authorization from your direct supervisor and prior approval of Gabriel, Raphael or Michael. The Creation has been divided in three main dimensions. Earth and its mortals where we shall never and under any circumstances intervene unless otherwise ordered. Paradise where you will find your offices, meeting and training rooms, and where the souls of virtuous Humans will rise, but I will explain this point later. And Hell where the souls of the Humans who sinned will be
My soldiers' reports are flowing into my head, clear and to the point. Everyone answered the call except three. Three Angels among my new recruits did not respond.
"The Sisters managed to adapt their projects to the inconvenient disappearance of Adam and Eve." Anael crosses his arms. "Cain's bloodline will take the destiny of Seth's since he was never born. Everything is planned for the next millennia, the reproduction process and births are closely monitored by Balthazar and the Cherubs. Nothing is left to chance." His eyes narrow into green slits. "Anyway. As you know, the Mother of Monster – or the Mother of All like some of us call her – is still running free and sowing her poisoned creatures all around. We have not been able to locate her yet, her creations are multiplying and turning Humans into monsters at an alarming rate. In a few hundred years there won't be any Human left on Earth if this goes on. Moreover, the souls of monsters escape Reapers when they die and get sucked into Purgatory. With each monster created the Mother of All becomes stronger."
"I have never disobeyed. You are the ones who betrayed the mission and our orders by joining Uriel."
It's night and the celestial vault is speckled with shimmering stars and wandering souls. Camael obviously sent us halfway across the planet. Standing a bit further, Siosp is desperately trying to straighten his wings up and take flight, but all he manages to do is fly a few hundred meters up before collapsing back down with a frustrated growl, raising an ash cloud around.
Something is off. Cas looks panicked like a trapped animal, unstable. Maybe he's still insane? Did he even hear all my prayers? Why doesn't he explain why he disappeared?
There are hands grabbing my arm and helping me up. I thank Hester with a nod as my blade reintegrates my Grace. We are all alive. That is, only the soldiers of the Garrison are. Gabriel annihilated every last one of the rebels, leaving them no chance to repent.
I glance at the door and its dirty window through which I can see Alastair gazing around with dispassionate curiosity, as though he were simply visiting the place willingly.
"There, here's your stream. We find your boyfriend quickly and we get the fuck out of here. You reek of fresh human blood for miles around. Wouldn't make any difference if you put signs all over the area saying « free buffet »."
My brother is staring at me with an indecipherable look in his eyes, and I remember the last time he touched me so tenderly, when I was draining out of my life-force in his arms, mortally wounded by Camael.
No wonder we are Heaven's misfits. Created for the sole purpose of monitoring Father's experiment on animals with souls that He ended up favoring over us. Guardians of a species whose existence causes so many issues and conflicts within our Family.
"Castiel!" he says with a smirk. "Please, take a seat! Would you like some cake? Perhaps a nice cup of tea?"
"Do you remember..." A smile grazes my lips. "Do you remember that fish that ended up hanging on the top of a tree because it fought out of an eagle's claws?"
No one has ever prayed to me since Camael. Hell's vile atmosphere interferes with the flow and I have to focus to grasp the delicate thread of words. I silence Hester with a commanding gesture of my hand and press my fingers to my temple.
"Some of God's chosen ones have lived for much longer," I say quietly. "I only hope he lives a long and happy life and succeeds in his mission."
Miz and Pmox join us together, closely followed by Zedekiel, always the latecomer. He smooths down his ruffled feathers and lines up as well.
The moon is full, and the valley where we carry out the resurrections has become a crater that keeps widening. More than a hundred distraught Humans are wandering about and staring in disbelief as more of them keep appearing on a regular basis. Ephra and Rachel will soon come to harvest and sort them out before erasing their memory once more.
It seems like my ruse worked, no one arrested me to throw me into rehabilitation and I safely fly back to my troops.
"Just taking a stroll around. The late autumn breeze is quite pleasant, and you’re missing out by staying here. There are a lot of things currently happening on Earth and in Heaven. Did you know they’re forging weapons and holy trinkets in the firmament as we speak?"
With a choked gasp, Chuck scrambles to his feet, shoulders hunched as he clutches his bottle to his chest.
A sharp move, and my blade sinks deeply in the werewolf's skull. He gives out a choked gurgle and warm blood drips on my fingers. A sour smell rises in the air. Like rotten meat left in the sun.
I am the first one to show up in the meeting room. Anna is standing there, three Angels I have never seen before at her side.
I don’t know if Camael actually betrayed both the Garrison and Heaven like Michael claimed. But should the Archangel be right about this, what I am about to do is necessary. Righteous. Even merciful. The Mother of All most likely used Cain, her creature, to get to one of us. Cain is sullied now. He is no longer God’s chosen one, only an abomination. The Angel of Joy will be sent to rehabilitation and will come back to us purified, just like Anael and Zachariah were. His redemption will be easier if Cain has no memory of his Guardian Angel and stops praying to him.
"And I expect you to behave with dignity, and obey without question! I won't allow any of you to be stupid enough to rebel and get killed: that's the last thing the Garrison needs!"
Starting a fight here and now would waste precious time and not only give Anna the opportunity to escape us once again, but also endanger the perfect vessels for Michael and Lucifer. Our mission is to execute Anna, not to go around battling common demons. We don't have time for this nonsense.
"Not quite. My superior ordered me to study the Holy Scriptures to get a better understanding of the Humans in my charge."
What has Azazel done to this child? Why does he have so much power? If Lucifer's true vessel can deploy such overwhelming power on his own, I can't imagine what Lucifer could achieve with such a weapon in his possession.
"Right!" Zachariah cheerfully claps his hands. "Let me remind you the reason why we are gathered here. Castiel over here found out that Anna, who was untraceable to us for over twenty years, is being hunted by demons and still has access to our chats through celestial channels. The Communications Division is currently working to correct this problem and cut off access to her. It also seems that she remembers everything, since she used the forbidden seal of banishment to cast out Uriel and Castiel. So what's the problem, you might ask? Well, by the time our two brothers recovered the use of their Grace, the Winchesters and their little pet demon found a way to hide themselves and Anna from us! Now we can't locate them. The question now is: how to track them down?"
The hideous and distorted face vanishes instantly, and the victims' features return as they die. Their choked cry fades away and the bodies collapse, raising dust from the arid ground. My coat swings around my legs - then, my wings unfurl and I flap them vigorously, dashing off to appear just behind a demon whispering evil incantations to send us back to Heaven. Did he think we wouldn't spot him?
"You won't find your answer from the righteous man's mouth," says Levanael softly. "He's only a Human. He doesn't know what's at stake and can hardly see further than his own interest."
Only when I report the details of their deaths to the Garrison and to the chain of command do I realize that these three soldiers died before I had a chance to learn their names.
Hester stills with a soul in his hand, gaze sharpening on a silver fox hopping around in the ashes. The setting sun is glowing red in the horizon, casting warm colors in the desolate landscape. The animal grinds to a halt and cocks its head up as if to size us up, wet snout quivering in the air, and ears parked up. Its soft fur is infused with warm purple shades. Then, it seems to lose interest and goes back to hopping off.
I need to get this mission over with. Praying that Dean won't make me kill more than a thousand innocents whose deaths will weigh as heavily on his conscience as mine, I walk closer so I can read the feelings through his eyes.
I am losing my mind. My Grace is whirling and unfurls my wings against my will - I have no choice but to grab onto the table's cold edge to anchor myself to reality. For a fleeting moment, I can feel myself sinking back into the past, struggling against the raging winds of the Flood, eyes riveted to the small boat, innocent lives at my fingertips.
I look down, struggling for the right words. Dean is Human, he is not bound by our laws: he is allowed to utter such atrocities with no fear for consequences. I could read in his soul a dreadful lack of Faith, and Faith is what drives my entire existence and gives it meaning. How could I possibly explain what is inherently acquired, what is natural to me?
I look down and fail to hold back a smile. Yes, Dean Winchester is truly special. Most Humans would not have survived just one tenth of what he went through on Earth or in Hell. I suppose that's the least we can expect from Adam and Eve's descendant and the most powerful Archangel's appointed vessel.
I follow her gaze. A portion of the terraces is occupied by about fifty Angels, including Zachariah who's staring at me with a displeased look on his face.
"Oh for Heaven’s sake, Cassy." Balthazar rolls his eyes and folds his arms in obvious annoyance. "They've played and they've lost. Now can we move on or are you waiting for them to die of old age?"
Cas' body goes slack against me and he lowers his head. He blinks and stares at me in amazement, his hair disheveled and cheeks red. Looking totally debauched.
The sound of his footsteps keeps getting farther away. I cannot fail this mission, nor can I lose the very small amount of trust I was able to earn from Dean. I have to give him some proof of my commitment and help him, but without the hierarchy viewing it as evidence of feelings or disobedience.
I'm wiping the sweat off my brow when something crash into my back with the brutal strength of a train that tackles me to the ground. I fall and my head hits violently a rock. The sounds grow heavy like if I was under water and a shrilling whistle fills my ears. A massive weight pins me on the ground, my cheek held down in the dust. Cursing breathlessly, I turn my eye to see a werewolf – a bit blurry – opening his wide mouth full of fangs. His warm and slimy drool leaks on my cheek and I scrunch my nose when the nasty stench assault my nostrils.
I glance at Levanael who's watching our interaction, her head tilted to the side and her blond hair flowing over her white dress. She makes a short chin gesture to encourage me.
I painstakingly hold back from disagreeing on this point. The Archangel Michael explicitly told me not to tell the truth about Camael's true motivations.
Only out of the respect I had for her in the past do I not signal her presence to the rest of the Garrison.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, my brother’s body disintegrates and his Grace ignites as his wings crumble. And the next second, there is nothing left of Siosp except a slow rain of ashes falling into the fire.
"All I did was reveal the truth to them and offer them a choice. The choice Father couldn’t bring Himself to subject them to. Blindly have faith in Him, or eat a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge to finally be able to understand His plans."
Dean forgot hunting, forgot Sam, even Cas. There was just the car and the man in front of him, who seemed to inch closer to his heart every second. It was easy to accept Mike as his brother in this regard, because being good at restoring cars was one of the few things Dean naturally liked about himself.
Cas had chosen this setting on purpose. He rarely had spoken to Mike during the past days, which made him uneasy. For the first hour they sat in silence. Cas had agreed to listen to Mike's favourite music. It seemed to relax him, though Cas wished he could still pop in and out of places like he used to, or at least park parts of his consciousness in other dimensions. The music was not that bad, but it was unfamiliar. Dean never listened to European electronic music. But Cas persevered. Mike was beautiful and the Winchester aura soothed his angelic constitution.
Mike sighed. “Hey, I kinda like you. There is something about...all of this,” he gestured with his hands in front of Cas' body. “But this is ten times weird.”
Sam opened the fridge, going through all the possibilities. “Dean is our cook, usually. Want a sandwich?”
Mike's face twitched. “He doesn't think he deserves to be saved,” he remarked, searching for something in Cas' face.
Cas looked at him. He studied his face, the tension in the muscles of his arms. It was a genuine question. “God wanted me to,” he eventually said.
When they returned from an exhausting hunt Mike sometimes waited for them with beer and hot coffee. He looked relaxed and calm while Dean felt beat and unravelled. It always reminded him, that he could come back from this, that it was possible to breathe.
Cas shot him a look, then turned back to Mike, his face softening again. “My friend is very direct.”
Sam and Cas were sitting at the table in the main hall, pretending to do research when Dean arrived back from his meeting. They exchanged glances, then casually watching Dean putting down his duffel bag, emptying it.
Mike looked at the photo, his jaw working, swallowing hard. The woman with blonde hair was smiling, the little boy by her side looked exactly like him. For a moment, Mike was Dean, imagining himself into the picture. He closed his eyes, letting the picture sink in and lowered his head.
Mike had brought him ice cream. “You wanted to try this one, didn't you?” he asked, handing him a frozen cone of rosemary and chocolate flavour.
When a slow song started playing, Dean looked at Cas, extending his hand, his face soft. “Wanna dance, angel?”
The morning came swiftly, the horizon giving way to the first light. Mike woke up, finding his head on Cas' shoulder. He blinked. “Sorry,” he said, his voice sleep heavy.
Mike squinted his eyes, looking to Sam, then to Cas, then back to Dean. “I figured from the look of your... housing,” Mike said, pointing around the room, “that you are not ordinary townsfolk.”
The weight of the past threatened to crush Dean in one fell swoop. How did he end up in this fucking family therapy session all of a sudden? It was all too much, it had always been too much. He feared to break down if he spent another minute just sitting around all these people. He wanted out, going on a hunt. He needed to feel in control again.
At some point Dean asked himself, what the fucking problem was. Cas could spend his time with whomever he wanted. He always came when they needed him for a case, so he was still loyal. He had abandoned them before when he was too busy to care. He was still an angel, no matter what. But Cas was still... well, Cas.
Mike opened the door, asking a random stranger passing by to take a photo with his phone. The man obliged and took a snapshot. Mike thanked him and showed the picture to Dean.
Cas looked at his hands. “Meeting your brother was... not what I had expected,” he said. “It was a simple task for an angel, to save a man from hell. The light is always stronger than all the darkness, but when I saw Dean, walking earth again after I had reconstructed him, something had changed.” He paused. “Dean always thinks it was Anna, the other angel, who showed me free will...”
Dean was driving on, focusing on his job. Sam studied maps and read about the town they were heading to. It took them the whole night to get to it. At some point Dean switched seats with Sam, getting an hour of sleep himself. He dreamed about the yellow-eyed demon and saw Mike getting snatched away. He had a twin now, another me who suffered from this life, another brother his heart would break over.
The road was long, as usual. Cas had asked to drive with Mike for a while. Dean seemed not entirely happy, but he did not want to rock the boat over it.
They drove to a diner that served good burgers and Dean could finally settle down in his own skin. They started talking ghost science with Sam and car mechanics with Dean, swooning over baby. Eventually, a smile appeared on his face and in the end he laughed wholeheartedly over Cas making an involuntary joke about heaven. Mike was a decent fellow, Dean had to admit. He was more than okay. Mike started to feel like a weird mirror of himself, that made him kind of warm and fuzzy inside.
And Cas could not deny him in the end. It was just impossible. “Let me go to him,” he said, slowly stepping back.
Dean went hunting again with Sam, while Cas decided to keep an eye on Mike. He found himself drawn to the strange, yet so familiar man. More than once he just watched him from a safe distance in his workshop. Cas realised he had never looked at Dean for such extended periods of time, though he knew him in ways not even Dean could. But to see Mike work, move and squint his eyes as Dean would do was soothing to him; it reminded him of home. When Cas returned to the bunker, he found Dean, sitting in the kitchen, eating breakfast.
It was amusing, Cas thought. Here Mike sat with an angel, who was far more powerful than Dean and Sam combined, but for some reason he put his trust in Cas. Well, he did not know yet about Cas' real identity, or maybe humans were naturally drawn to angels. It was their original mission after all, to help people, to make them feel protected, if God commanded it.
A few moments later, there was a knock at his door. Dean pressed his eyes shut. He felt like a fucking teenager, storming off because he was pissed at his parents. His parents, good God, he wished it were just his parents he was running from.
Mike laughed. “I've heard that one before,” he said from under the lid. “Still, they are old beauties, and these ladies are to be treated with respect.”
They entered the little establishment and chose a seat at the window. Almost all tables were at a window. Only the barstools faced towards the waitress. There were only women here in vintage uniforms with name tags; just the hair pieces were missing. They smiled, walking around with coffee cans, asking to refill your cup. The music was what put Dean at ease the most - good old blues and rock'n'roll.
“Well, we ain't shooting family, so... Yes... Yes, Cas... but I still don't believe it. I need your help.”
Dean lost his footing, stumbling backwards, holding on to Sam who caught him. His lower lip quivered. Then he inhaled deeply and cleared his throat. “Tell me.”
He nodded, allowing Cas to tell their story. And so he did. In the end he glanced at Dean, whose head was lowered over his drink. “... the same demon has snatched you from the hospital, replacing you by a dead look-alike. They did not show the dead child to your mother again, and Mary decided to keep quiet about you, because she had made a deal once and thought it was her fault.”
He kissed Cas' hand he was still holding, softly thumbing over his jaw. “Have you ever told him?” he asked.
A clanking noise rang from under the car, then Dean rolled his body forth. “Confidential my ass. Are you kidding me?”
Cas could take in the scent of the guy pretty well. He was sweating, and his body odour mixed with the oil grease on his skin and work clothes. It was remarkably similar to Dean, but something smelled different. They were not the same, so no clone, though Cas would have to come closer, to touch this man to be absolutely sure.
Dean stopped for a moment, staring into one corner of the room. He tasted vanilla on his tongue. “Barely,” he said and resumed unpacking.
Dean sobered up in an instant, his big brother protection mode kicking in. “I'm sorry, Sammy,” he said, rubbing his eyes. “I fucked up.”
Nobody answered. Cas pushed down the door handle and peeked inside. Dean WAS lying on his bed, headphones on. He did not look at Cas, he did not move at all. Cas did what he had always done, sitting down on the edge of Dean's bed, watching him. And that was it. He remained there for as long as Dean would need him.
He looked around. Where was he? He saw the sky. It was a lovely day, sunshine warming his skin. He looked down at his feet. They were naked, water washing over them in a steady rhythm. A hand on his shoulder. He turned around.
All he wanted to do was call Dean on his phone, but he did not dare to disturb him. If Dean finally found some rest, then the world would have to offer more than a doppelganger casually repairing cars for Cas to trouble him. But then, in what world did a twin of Dean even exist? The angel intended to find out who had sent this imposter in the first place. He doffed his trench coat, putting it into the trunk of his car. The suit underneath with the tie and the white shirt made him look like a business man. Cas smirked. Dean liked that outfit, though Cas did not bother showing himself like that. He liked the beige security blanket. It was Jimmy's coat, Claire's father's. It was less sentiment than familiarity that made him keep it. Like Dean, the coat's proximity felt stabilizing to Cas in more than one way.
Sam was the first to recover, always soft to whatever lore Dean laid out in front of him. “Yeah, I'm okay with that?” he said.
They arrived first in the bunker. Sam greeted them and poured Mike a drink from Dean's whiskey bottle.
Cas inhaled. “Okay, my vessel can reach around your heart, through your skin. It won't be damaged, I work on an energetic level, but it's better for you to lay down. It will still be rough.”
Sam took back his phone. “I believe you, because I have taken the photo. This here is my brother Dean.”
Of course, Mike did not turn into some kind of housekeeper, and that was the beauty of it. To Dean, he was just this seemingly unfazed part of their family that still very much belonged to them, while Mike was just happy to have any kind of relationship to his new found family members. Dean prayed every now and then that Mike would continue to stay away from hunting. He wanted that, he needed it more and more each day. He was the safe haven, and Dean would have wished for it to stay this way forever. But Mike was not some kind of superhuman, dropped into their laps to feel better about themselves. He had a jarring way to bring things to the surface that the other three wisely kept locked away.
Dean was not good with changes he did not initiate himself. People came crushing into his heart and he spent a whole lot of time just deflecting it, battling the onslaught of emotions he had not invited in. Cas had been the worst. An actual angel who deemed him worthy of spending time with, helping him even, then staying around, never giving up on him. The only two people who had never given up on him were Sam and Bobby. Sam did not count, he was his younger brother. Nature practically forced him to love the only family member who cared for him. Bobby was different, yet deep down Dean did not even trust him to stay. Every day he could fuck up things royally, and Bobby may decide to move on, to finally see him for the failure he was and just leave. That was Dean's life, struggling desperately to be worthy of anyone's time.
Sam got up, anger welling up in him. “You tell me, Dean. All I know is you behaving like a crazy person these days. Thank God for Cas, who heard your prayer. You might as well be dead out here and I wouldn't even know.”
Then Dean put his hand around Mike's shoulder. “I'm sorry, Mike, for everything,” Dean whispered, is voice breaking.
Mike was still a bit dazed. Cas touched his arm. “I think we need to talk with him, too. He has a right to know.”
Sam had found another case just yesterday, which looked like a ghost possession. Nothing too complicated and hopefully barely any blood involving.
He was not keen on confronting himself with their past, but he owed him. Mike was as much part of this fucked up family as Sam and himself. The best Mike could do was share their pain and feeling held by his brothers at he same time. It was not just another unfortunate soul cursed by the name Winchester, it was also another shoulder to lean on, to bear the unspeakable truth, another Dean to carry the load, if not just as a comforting idea.
Cas' tilted his head. This man in front of him, he asked the important questions. “I have been assigned to him since the dawn of time,” Cas said.
Dean, who could be very particular about what he put into his mouth, felt oddly relaxed by his brother taking the lead to feed them. Was that what it felt like to be known, to trust, and to receive by himself? Dean breathed out a sigh and slid down into a comfortable position on the red leathered, soft bench, that looked and felt a lot like the back seat of baby.
Dean looked at Mike and suddenly he felt the need to hug him if that would be something he did. He still felt far too raw in Mike's presence to be comfortable.
They fell silent again, driving on the narrow road to the memory of a life Mike had not been a part of.
Cas looked around in his car. What kind of trouble could he come up with for the inspection? He sighed. Dean would know. And how came this doppelganger was good with cars, too?
Dean could live with all of this, the loneliness, the anger towards the supernatural that had torn his family apart. He had lived with this for his entire life. What he more and more failed to endure was how Mike and Cas looked at each other.
Mike's jaw tightened. The colour in his face still had not returned fully. “Okay, that could work,” he said.
The pain was back in Cas' chest. With two fingers he absently rubbed over it, where his heart was supposed to be.
That bitch! Cas thought. He turned off the frequency and opened his eyes. The word of an archangel could only be neutralised by God itself. But God was gone. Castiel sighed. He had chosen free will once, had chosen Dean Winchester. There was no turning back to be an obedient soldier again. There was no shortcut through heaven anymore.
He held his hand over his mouth, shutting his eyes for a moment. “I wish mom could see this,” he whispered.
They glanced at the house for one more time. It was just a house, their lives in it long gone. A new family lived here now; maybe they would find peace.
They dispersed and packed a few things. It was Friday evening. They should wrap this up over the weekend so Mike did not get fired from his job for not showing up on Monday.
He slept for a whole twelve hours. It was the deepest rest he had ever experienced. The smell of coffee was finally bringing him back. A cup with the steaming, hot fluid stood on his bedside table. It was such a familiar smell, a safe smell, like home.
The men approached each other. Mike was alone. Dean found himself admiring his nerves. But then, it was daylight and the store still open. Every attempt to tackle him would not get unnoticed.
Cas raised an eyebrow, the offer somewhat confusing him, but he decided to push past that and take what he got. Maybe that was the way in.
Dean felt a sudden stab of pain in his stomach when he watched Mike climbing the surface, laying down, giving himself up to these guys he had just met and to the higher power of an angel. He saw himself, kneeling at Bobby's body in the barn, angry at the strange creature that had just send his friend to sleep with only a finger to his forehead. Mike trusted Cas, because Dean trusted him, and he did not know why.
But it was too late. Mike had already seen him, felt him, connected to him. A part of Mike had done so from the moment Cas had stepped into his garage. He was a Winchester, eternally bound to this one angel.
Mike nodded. “Of course, I... damn...oh, sorry, I am not supposed to swear around an angel, aren't I?”
Dean looked at Cas, who understood. His grace might not be as strong as it used to be but he could still manage to make people gape. He could still show his wings.
Mike still sat at the table, his glass empty. Dean took a chair again and settled at the opposite side. He looked at Mike. He really looked at him. It was the strangest thing to gaze into one's own face. That way he had to confront everything he mostly ignored. There was emotion on display, far more than Dean was comfortable with. Did he look like that when he was confused, hurt, restless? He watched Mike looking at Cas as if searching for reassurance. Dean inhaled. Did he purse his lips that much, licking them involuntarily? Dean directed his gaze to Cas. His angel seemed a bit uncomfortable and not only because he had just met another Winchester. There was something else.
Mike reappeared, wiping his hands with a cloth. “I see nothing wrong here so far. An oil change wouldn't hurt.”
'All right,' he thought. 'I did that,' and the constant question whether it had been worth it to be cast out by his own kind crept back again. Would his devotion to the Winchesters ever be enough? He thought about Mike, the way he had beheld him, his face full of awe when he learned about Cas being an angel. Humans had a weakness for being saved. Their limited lives bore great agony, not knowing why they had been born onto this planet in the first place. They just loved the feeling that it was worth the pain.
Just listening to the sound made his head spin. It was hard to separate his feelings for them. He had not expected that. Cas took the best road to Mike's town. He bemoaned his inability to fly these days. He had become far more human than he was comfortable with.
Cas tilted his head. This man used some elaborate language. “Have you always been a mechanic?” Cas asked aloud before he could catch the words.
Cas turned his hand around, taking Mike's. He had to keep his focus because the images were blurring. Mike's hand felt exactly like Dean's. To touch him was like touching his friend. There was no difference but their souls, and Cas desperately needed to remind himself of that. But in the end, he could not refuse a Winchester.
Would there ever be a day Dean found peace? A day, when he could meet his mother again and tell her everything he wanted to?
Cas told him about his encounter and all the first measures he had taken to check for a trick plus the invitation for beer in the evening.
Sam could barely contain himself while watching the two men from Cas' car through the window of the bar. He wanted to jump out and confront the man. Sam did not really fear for Cas but for his own sanity. But he had promised only to come if Cas called.
Mike was glad to be by himself in his car for awhile. His mind wandered. He was not alone anymore. He was a brother, a brother to two badass men and an angel who saved people from monsters. Monsters!
Cas felt for the man. He just saw an ordinary human being who was scared, but more so hopeful he might have found a tiny piece of the puzzle that was his life. He not only looked and talked like his favourite human. Cas could also sense all the loneliness that came with a lack of family.
After half an hour he drove right into the parking lot of the dealership. Mike beckoned him to his workshop door, and Cas let himself be steered in position so Mike would have all access to his car. He got out of it, letting Mike take a look.
Dean looked at him, feeling the energy surging through his body again. His heart started pounding and the strength in his limbs faded. It was the same he had felt the day before. It was the same he had felt during the last weeks on and off. Until yesterday he had been able to subdue the rising panic, but now it had won. Was he about to faint over Cas like a fucking damsel in distress? What happened to him? Dean braced himself, but it was too late. All he could do was silently mouthing “CAS” again. Then all went black.
Mike tried to imagine them hunting werewolves, vampires, shapeshifters. All he could see was them, running around with guns, like boys who played soldiers. Mike had held guns in his hand, but he tried to stay away from them. Cars were much more comfortable. He knew everything about them, but so did Dean. Dean, his brother, his twin. An urge formed inside him, to be more like Dean. It was strange, he could have never imagined what immense need to relate to his kin lay dormant inside him. They had awakened it and it forced its way upward like an oncoming storm.
Cas turned his head, finding Sam sitting at the bar, staring directly at them. Cas nodded and Sam got up, slowly walking towards their table.
Dean glanced around. Did people still look? Mike took in a mouthful, closing his eyes and swallowing the sweet, sticky liquid with an over the top exhale. “I miss that,” he said.
Mike put down his bottle. “Listen, pal, it was all fun but you don't expect me to believe your crazy story, let alone coming with you to meet who? What is this?” He looked around, having noticed the tall man who had entered the bar a few moments ago that gazed at them suspiciously. “I'm not afraid of you but I sure won't walk with you into some kind of death trap just because you make some intriguing propositions.”
Cas nodded. “I saw what has happened to you.” He could not look at Dean, he did not dare. The pain and confusion, the anger and terror that now ran through him was something Cas was not ready to face head on. So he decided to work towards it.
Mike blinked, as if waking up from a kind of vision. “Yes, ehm...,” he cleared his throat. “I want to talk to Dean, but I feel, that won't be easy. He seems so...”
Mike was thinking about it. “I guess I've tried, but maybe...I don't even fully believe you are real now,” he admitted and lowered his head, wiping his forehead with his hand.
When he saw him first, Castiel's breath stopped for a moment. He did not really need to breathe but this second he was acutely aware that he could, or not, like right now.
They stood beside each other kind of awkwardly when Dean said “I could drive by his garage someday. Maybe talk a bit.”
Dean's jaw worked pretty hard, his hand feeling the urge to clutch his gun. Cas stood close by, observing him carefully.
Mike's head peered from the car's front lid. “Dean, hey, I thought I recognised this voice,” he said and smiled, quickly cleaning his hands.
The man looked up from his work. “Hey.” He put down his tools, cleaning his hands with a towel near him. “Can I help you?”
Dean started looking around. He was at the side of a road in the middle of nowhere. Slowly, he remembered what had brought on the situation he now found himself in. He gazed at his little brother, feeling utterly embarrassed. “Don't know,” he mumbled, trying to get up.
Sam looked at him for a moment longer, then he got in his own car, driving behind his brother, not letting him out of his sight.
It was a strange thing, seeing your brother preparing a sandwich for you. For Mike 'seeing a brother' was the weirdest thing itself.
The engine started roaring. Mike closed his eyes, imagining the Impala's parts, working together in symphony to carry them to their destination, safe, strong and reliable. Dean cared for his car, so Mike felt taken care of.
Cas looked at him with such awe. How was this man able to see through him after this short period of time?
Everything about the man over there was exactly as he knew Dean to be, but at the same time it could not be real. Dean had been on a hunt with Sam. They had talked over the phone an hour ago, but that was not the most important evidence. Cas could always feel Dean if he wanted to, his thoughts, his pleading, his curses when a truck driver cut his lane. Cas always knew where Dean was. Right now Dean lay down sleeping after the hunt. Cas could see his dreams.
Dean could have played it cool. Maybe he was talking about a sportsmate, maybe they just hung out because Mike was alone otherwise, or maybe another thousand reasons why he would return again and again to his neighbour's house to drink a vanilla milkshake. But he did not. He wanted to, oh, he so much wanted to, but something deep inside him refused to pretend he did not know. Because Mike was not just some guy, he was not even Sam or Cas, he was his twin. He did not need to pretend, it would be unfair and disrespectful, most of all to himself.
Cas arrived at Mike's apartment. It was late, but Mike had continually renewed his call. All Cas could do was sending him a sense of calm until he arrived.
They had gotten along so well but Mike's relationship with Cas started to disturb the careful crafted peace, and Dean did not know what to do with it. A part of him wanted to throw Mike out of their lives, so Dean would not have to deal with that anymore. Then he could retreat into his self-made prison, where self-loathing was an ugly, private matter, he could wallow in whenever he wanted. Another part wanted to hug him, never letting go, like he was a long lost friend who had opened a door to sanity.
Cas was suddenly moved by Mike's wonderment. It had been a long time somebody regarded him with awe. “I am,” he said, remembering the days when angels were good. “I am also a hunter,” Cas added.
Cas realised what was happening, and he did not like how this made him feel. “Do you have a brother?”
Mike pushed a button on his workbench and the car got lifted up, so he could continue his inspection at the bottom. He took a lamp and some tool to shine here and knocking there, wiping his nose with his forearm. He sniffed just like Dean had done this morning. It rang like a weird echo in Cas' ears.
Mike's face went through all kinds of emotions at once. Then he inhaled. “Well, you know this one already,” Mike started, beckoning Dean towards the hood. They both looked at the familiar innards of this old American car, sharing silent glances at each other while Dean watched Mike explaining the mechanical details. He understood the inherent beauty of the essential workings of a car, enthusiasm written all over his face, his whole body. Mike was like him, he took comfort in the simple mechanics of a vehicle that made you feel safe, strong and sexy at times. Most of all, it was a constant, an unbroken promise to be there for you, if you cared for it. It was like a partner who communicated without talking back. That's why they loved cars. They were reliable and you wanted to look after them.
Dean looked at him for way too long and eventually averted his gaze. “Don't ask stupid questions!” he said, throwing the cloth on a nearby table. “Was it Mike? Did he pray to you?”
Sam squirmed in his seat, remembering the torturous moment all too well. He got up. “You can just lay on the table,” he said.
In the outskirts of town was a lake where only few people gathered. They chose a remote spot, still close enough to a road. The men sat down in a semi circle and started talking.
Dean had retreated to his room and Sam was in the library. Cas took off but let Dean know where he was headed. Dean had demanded it.
They gave Mike the family tour. The town, the house and the few sites where memories had been made. It was not much of a home since John had taken them to the road pretty early. Still, the house where their family's fate had been sealed was something they needed to share with him.
Mike could not take his eyes off Sam. He was an intriguing figure, yes, but there was something else that made his heart leap.
So, who was that clone over there in the workshop? Cas adjusted the sleeves around his wrists when he approached the dealership's garage.
Sam was honestly shocked. He had refused to believe it until now. All the legal evidence had suggested otherwise. But he trusted in science. “What do you want to do now? How are we...?”
He felt opening up to Mike, to himself, to the life that had chosen him. Being with Mike felt like a refuge, a dream he may evoke at night, when the monsters threatened to overwhelm him. It felt almost peaceful.
That stung somewhat awfully in Dean's chest, and he was taken aback by the sheer force of it, but he said nothing.
The fire died down, and they filled the grave with soil again. Mike helped and felt at least a bit useful doing it, though his heart still raced. Dean on the other hand felt way more like himself again after their work was done.
Cas' mouth twitched. “All right,” he said, hesitating. “What's your name...I mean, who should I ask for?”
Cas was the one who accompanied Mike to the main door of the bunker. “There is something you should know. You are a Winchester,” Cas said, hesitating, looking away briefly.
It took a few minutes to calm down, but Dean ordered himself to not pass out again. He would not abandon these feelings, not Cas', not his own.
The genuine concern in the other man's voice made Mike's heart ache. He had never met people like these two. “I never got your name,” he said.
The two men sat in silence in Cas' car. Mike was a nervous wreck, tapping his finger against the car door, twitching with his legs. He was so much like Dean when he was agitated. It was almost endearing to Cas, if he would not have been so anxious himself.
Sam's eyes widened. Then he saw Mike smiling and he understood, leaning back, putting his hands behind his head, watching the scene.
Dean shot him a look, lingering for a moment on the anger that had formed in his stomach, then quickly dismissing it.
'Castiel', a bodyless voice said when he approached the gates of heaven. They happened to be a state of mind, a frequency he could turn on when he closed his eyes and prayed. He may not be able to zap around with his human body anymore, but he did not need to in order to contact his own.
Sam reminded himself to breathe. Seeing someone who looked exactly like Dean triggered all kinds of feelings. He still feared this was some kind of monster who played a cruel trick on them, but Cas was right. This man WAS Dean, and then he was not, but not in a threatening way. He felt like family.
“Yes, it was, but I accepted my fate nonetheless. You were never supposed to be burdened with it. I... only told you now because I feared for your life. I cannot have that on my conscience.”
Dean nodded and kept to himself that he envied Mike. He truly lived the life Dean never had, just doing things he was born with, carved into his bones. Somehow that did not make him angry, to see a version of himself who was able to experience this. It was like watching a mirror universe, finally being able to relax, finally feeling some peace he never thought he could have. It melted the walls even further.
Mike shook his head, wringing his hands. “I prayed to you and you... heard me. You came for me, because I asked,” he stammered, the immensity of the moment overwhelming him.
Mike came to the bunker regularly now. He mostly just hung out, talking about the mundane things of life, connecting to each of them in a unique way. They did not feel him to be forced into their lives, he just eased into them one step at a time. Soon, Dean got used to seeing his own face staring back at him. It became more of a comfort than it was disturbing.
The car came down and Mike opened the front lid. He shook his head. “You know, these cars need care. The level of dust in here is dangerous,” he said.
Dean sat in his car, two streets from Mike's shop. He did not want to park closer, because he feared Mike would recognise the car from afar, betraying him.
Dean breathed hard. Hunting monsters was one thing, talking to a potential twin and opening up a whole can of family worms was something else entirely.
Another thing that made him climb up the walls was Cas vanishing for days without telling them where he had gone. He did this all the time, but now Dean not only worried what kind of danger he had walked into, he wondered whether he met Mike along the way, having a blast without Dean knowing it.
The door of the main entrance opened, and then Dean stood on the high ledge, looking down on the three men. They all glanced up at him, quiet and nervous. Dean slowly descended the stairs until he finally came to the big table. Cas could sense he had been drinking, hopefully after driving.
The diner was old fashioned indeed. There was something strangely soothing about nostalgia. It definitely felt better than the original. Mike did not want to have lived in the sixties. He would have gone to jail for feeling for men the way he did. Not that he felt totally comfortable as a bisexual now, but there was no law anymore that would have his neck for loving the wrong gender.
The Dean doppelganger smiled. How many times had he heard a line like this? But the angel did not have the faintest clue about cars. What was he supposed to say? How to come closer to him?
Mike took a bite from the offered food. “Healthy,” he said with his mouth full, and Sam's heart threatened to burst, because it was exactly the way Dean would have said it.
Mike went quiet for a few seconds. There he was, together with the man in the trench coat, fishing rod in his hand.
Cas flinched and Mike stopped laughing immediately. “Sorry, I didn't mean,” he said “but, you know,” he ran his hand over the back of his neck. “people rarely ask about my family.”
They were in each other's personal space now, though Mike was not sure where Cas' space really started. His angel aura might as well be wrapped around his whole family. He only felt the draw, not just from the power the angel emitted but from the things that had already happened between Castiel and the Winchester brothers, that somehow were written into Mike's memories now as well.
“Okay, just bring him. We'll see, bye.” Dean exhaled and ended the call. He grabbed his jacket and his keys. “I need some air, Sam,” he said.
Cas drove around in his car when a voice entered his mind. At first he thought it was Dean's but then he realised Mike was praying to him.
"Because they gave him a choice." Anna's new human voice still carries her former rank's confidence. "They either kill me... or kill you."
"So you wanna waste me?" continues Dean, to Uriel's apparent silence. "Go ahead, see how he digs that."
sorry. Or at least… I believe I am. Certainly not in the human definition of the word, but I really tried to defend Anna, to spare her the execution. Seeing my siblings lose their way and die is never pleasant. And even though we were unable by nature to shed tears neither for Siosp nor for Camael, Anna's fate is affecting me much more than these ancient executions. Anna has been my mentor ever since my creation. She was an important part of my world.
"There is no way to bring him back from the dead, it's true. However, you have to make the Humans believe it is possible."
"Precisely. I believe that the contagion has spread. It hangs in the air and all of our brothers are being infected one by one. Azazel, Alastair, Lucifer, myself... we would never have behaved like this before the Garrison was created. I'm sick, Castiel. We all are, and it's getting worse."
A shiver runs through my Grace and I look down at my hands stained with blood. In a wave of energy, my skin and clothes are spotless again.
"I was getting to that very point. Your idea to disrupt this pact was most welcome, for the Council and I never expected Lilith to be so selfish and value her own insignificant little life over her master and creator's freedom. According to your last report, sixty seals have been broken, correct? Lilith is getting squeamish... because she is the last seal."
All eyes turn to Balthazar whose shoulder our General is now perched on. Anael is staring us down and folding her wings to her back. It seems like she only just arrived. She probably didn't hear us talking about Camael.
He's looking at me in the eye at last, but his accusing tone only makes me angrier. If he heard my prayers, he
They told us Zachariah informed him of his death and Judas' betrayal years ago. Without even knowing that he was being sacrificed by his own kind, Jesus humbly accepted it. No questions or hesitation, obeying like only an Angel knows how to. I wish I could spare my brother the agony that awaits him. Camael is a soldier of the Garrison. An Angel of the Lord. Since he is doomed to be a mortal, the least we could do is to offer him a quick and painless death.
I look down at my clasped hands and whisper a hesitant prayer to my Father. And like always since my creation, I obtain no answer.
I stare intently at her, ready to obey her orders and follow the path she will point out to me, whatever it may be.
A soft sound flutters nearer as a dove flies in my direction. The bird looks exhausted and can barely flap its wings, so I lift a hand and let it perch on my finger. My Grace beads up to wrap it inside a globe of healing light.
," she snaps back, narrowing her eyes. "That's the name I chose for myself. Don't you ever call me Anael again."
I have knowingly worked to make happen the tragedy that destroyed the Winchesters. That sent Dean into Hell.
Silence is merely troubled by the rustling of the plastic sheets grazed by the breeze. Dean is facing the door, head down and fists clenched. He tilts his head towards me, face veiled by his own shadow.
Alastair's whimpers are still coming from the door, muffling the patter of water drops hitting the floor. There must be a pipe leaking somewhere.
"Castiel and Camael never once stepped inside the library. Azazel, on the other hand, frequented it regularly. He was only a second rank Cherub and was always so considerate, witty and pleasant. Unlike all those uncultured soldiers, he was erudite and wanted to know about everything. We did not suspect a thing and after a few hundred years we stopped keeping an eye on him when he did his researches…"
I didn't know that, although Hester doesn't seem to be expecting an answer. His gaze is unfocused and lost in the distance, farther than the skyline.
"I have nothing to fear from you, Angels. But I won't let you slaughter my beloved children any longer. I have no desire to see Creation destroyed. All I want is to see my children live there in harmony. Therefore, I propose an arrangement."
My wrists are instantly released and I squint into the blinding light - in a blast of pure energy, Hester and Rachel have been hurled out of here. The book hovers in the air for a second where Hester had been holding it, before falling to the ground with a loud thud that echoes through the vast space.
My soldier snickers and tosses the demon into the pentagram traced on the ground - facing the still tied corpse - before wiping his hands.
Taking advantage of my shock, he breaks free from my grasp and sends me to the ground with a punch far too powerful to be delivered by an ordinary demon.
He shakes his head, glaring at me in irritation and bitterness as I gather all of my Grace into my fists, halting the healing process and protection of my vessel. Uriel doesn't even try to deflect or block as I punch him in the face twice with all my energy gathered into my fists to sever his Grace from his vessel's brain.
Michael pushes himself from Raphael’s arms, trying to regain his strength, and turns to face the Angels.
The giant and wide open mouth's coming closer to rip off my neck, but suddenly a bright light makes me squint my eye. I see Cas' silhouette towering the monster, his hand plastered on its furry head and glaring coldly at it as the light resorbs. The werewolf falls back heavily on me, his mouth gaping and charred right on my face.
A warm hand on my shoulder. I look down to meet my sister's gaze. She is almost one head shorter than I am, staring at me seriously, unsmiling. Her dark blue eyes are tinged with lightning tones, eyeballs filled with her Grace.
"I’ll ask you to never tell a word to any of your brothers about it," Michael says more authoritatively. "
I send this silent order to my two soldiers, who obey, moving swiftly. Anna looks at us one by one, stealthily, like a tracked animal. She knows that this time, she can no longer flee. She lost her upper hand since we used a seal to expel her from her host, and Balthazar made sure no other vessel would say yes to her. It took us a year and a half, but we finally did it.
"I'm getting there, don't rush me. Where was I? You cut me off. And when I lose the train of thought I have a hard time finding it back."
Is it advisable to touch a Human with demon blood? What would happen if I were to attempt to exorcise the demonic part in him? I suppose it would kill him. If a cure was possible for these children, we would probably have received an order to do so decades earlier.
"You soldiers from the Garrison should stop coddling these creatures. A little bit of panic won't hurt them all that much. Don't you think animals felt panic too, when they were burned alive to save your precious little monkeys from Lucifer?"
I turn my head to Baradiel who is waiting for my orders, standing as still as a statue. I signal him to follow me by spreading my wings. The next moment, we’re back on the boat's deck. The dark ocean extends all the way to the skyline where the sun has already sunk down, but the last golden glimmers cast a shading of soft pinks and greens melting into a deep blue sprinkled with stars. A salty breeze ruffles my hair and makes my coat flap. Jimmy Novak's soul is gently fluttering inside me, so fragile and yet so powerful.
"Some home burglaries, a bank robbery, domestic violence charges, and a teenage runaway. Nothing for us, anyway."
I close my eyes, my sister's words soothing me with sour comfort. If Anna is right, then Siosp was wrong: my Father does exist and He is not the cruel and terrifying God I thought He was, when I obeyed all those orders. All the innocent Humans I slaughtered with my own hands over the centuries, all the deceitful illusions I built, all the minds I manipulated, all the acts of cruelty I condoned in the name of Fate... none of this would be the Will of my Creator.
No one equals Uriel when it comes to brute strength. He is unquestionably my Garrison's greatest asset. But Uriel is slow, and I was aware that unless I restrained Anna, he would never be able to strike her.
"You got it three centuries wrong, Brap. Ecanus won, he's the one who guessed the closest date right by 34 years."
The Archangels dismiss the Sisters and Balthazar and consult each other. Then, Michael turns his gaze to me to announce the verdict.
"And now, here's your first order to give to your soldiers: that they should get lost, shoo. There are a few things I need to tell you about your duties before you assume the position, and it's highly confidential."
"Hey! We should place bets on this one, too! I was right about Anael, only just a couple of years earlier!"
"You want us to talk to them directly?" Ephra huffs, his Grace glowing bright. "Our voice won’t just
"I understand your anger," she continues, her voice softening. "Camael is my brother too. But I don't ever want to see any of my soldiers be killed before my eyes again for talking when they should have kept quiet."
The General flies away without a word when she sees that the mission is fulfilled, obviously in a hurry to leave the area. Balthazar follows her soon after, mumbling something about a boring meeting he has to attend. The soft rustle of their wings echoes for a few seconds while the soldiers ruthlessly drag Jesus away. Judas watches it all as he is the only apostle left standing there.
"All we need is for him to learn this after Jesus died, so he won't be tempted to sabotage the mission." I hope my tone of voice sounds indifferent.
"Castiel, about time!" Zachariah calls out cheerfully. "So nice to have you back! How was your little joyride in Hell?"
My arrival raises a powdery cloud of snow around me. I fold my wings and look down at my brother who is sitting on the empty park bench. His true face is frosted in a glowing haze and his three eyes are sternly closed.
His fist crashes into my face with so much strength neither my aura nor my Grace can stop the blood vessels in my nose from bursting. I strike back instantly, hitting him in the jaw with my fist, making him stagger backwards. I duck to dodge his next blow, and seize the opening to smash his stomach with a wave of condensed energy. I can hear his bowels rupturing, but it doesn't affect him at all. Suddenly, the side of my skull cracks open under the effect of an extremely violent blow. A stream of blood streams down my face, adding to the blood dripping from my nose and filling my mouth with a copper taste. My vision blurs and my movements grow sluggish, my coordination impaired. My Grace is damaged - due to the sheer force of the attack, it has temporarily thickened to absorb the effects.
I remain silent and look down at the city. The boy finally managed to make the donkey move and is heading back to the market stall where his parents are working.
I burst into a cosy and warm living room with half-open glass doors leading to a garden. The grass is rustling under the falling rain, and there is a gentle breeze bringing a scent of wet earth and cut grass into the house's warmth. Several armchairs and a couch piled with cushions are set around a small round mahogany table. On the embroidered lace tablecloth, a mimosa arrangement in a vase. Next to it is a tray laden with pastel pink porcelain cups, filled to the brim with steaming tea.
"I know I’m not a good soldier. Contrary to what everyone may think of me, I am not so stupid as to be unaware that my former division got rid of me for this reason."
I had never seen this zone of the Paradise. I guess its purpose is to isolate rogue Angels before they are given proper punishment. Or am I to stay alone in here for all eternity?
Guardians are rare, and to my knowledge, this kind of mission has not been formally assigned since Cain. Now, the closest thing is the protection of vessels or their families - and that's only when the Angel has been asked to do so and actually keeps his promise. I know for a fact that there are Angels who disregard their vessels, and sometimes leave them in a poor condition, or even deliberately put them in a coma, just so they won't have to ask for their consent to invest their bodies the next time. I can't imagine what Dean would think of them or any of my superiors. I guess the word
"If we were to cause His wrath, then perhaps He would at least acknowledge our existence, if not love us."
Oh. I look back at the road as I ponder over my soldier's words. I can't bring these valid comments to the hierarchy, since we are in the past. And even if I could ask them, I already know that I would be given the usual answer:
"I guess we haven't been watching over the same species for all these millions of years, Uriel. There is good and there is bad in the Humans, and some of them show courage, wisdom, genuine and selfless kindness…"
Had we arrived any later, the righteous man would have turned into a demon, permanently, and everything would have been lost. We must save him no matter what it takes.
A guard rams the sharp end of his spear into his side to make sure Jesus is dead. Right at the same time, the last voices of the rebels echoing in our heads vanish, replaced by a heavy silence. Then Michael's calm voice announces that the rebellion has been defeated, and lists the names of the executed rebels. They have all been executed. No one has been sent to rehabilitation.
They all make their blade slide into their hand with a sinister tinkling, except for Balthazar who keeps his hands in his pockets, looking around with a whistle of wonder.
"Lucifer made demons out of Humans, the only living species vile and ruthless enough to serve his dark agenda. Dean Winchester broke a seal and slaughtered thousands of innocent souls in Hell. The line between Humans and demons has always been ambiguous, Castiel, and your righteous man is no exception."
Torn by the widest range of emotions I have ever experienced, I walk to my brother's side to the barn. With a faint flick of his fingers, he raises a gust of wind that brutally opens the doors, exposing the inside where the Winchester brothers are standing and...
I have more than enough going on right now. All I need is to make sure the righteous man remains unharmed.
With your clean history, you could even manage a proper division and join the Council in a few centuries, if you don't do anything stupid."
It has been a week now since it started raining. On the first day, the Humans did not worry. While Noah, his sons – Sem, Cham and Japhet – and their wives stepped into the ark with all of the animals they could find, everyone else just remained inside their fragile houses and waited for the downpour to stop. But it didn’t stop. On the second day once the chosen ones where all secured into their ships, heavy rain poured down. The rivers and lakes overflowed, the oceans rose, invading more of the lands with every second passing by. Animals found refuge on the heights while the Humans, increasingly worried, climbed on the roof of their houses. Many of those who had heard of the arks desperately tried to climb on board. We killed on sight any of them who dared come too close, making them drop dead before they even had a chance to reach salvation, regardless of whether they were human or monster, adult or child. Every single one. For orders are orders.
Benny clears his throat and the sound pulls me off my thoughts. I look at him, he's spinning his weapon, looking impatient.
"I found Pestilence!" Ecaop shouts, splitting away from our group. His outline disappears behind the demons swarming all around.
In a beating of wings, the entire Garrison surrounds me in a perfect circle. Anael is radiant when he puts a hand on my and Camael’s shoulder.
"You know how powerful Uriel was, how convincing he could be. He didn’t leave them a choice. You know, Castiel, I used to think there was something special, beautiful and wild about you. I guess I was wrong. The Council was right to choose you as my replacement. You are as empty and cold as they claimed when they ordered me to test your obed..."
I point out this anomaly to Levanael and we share a meaningful look. The man staggers to a dark alley and starts weeping like a child.
My blade makes a hissing sound as I slice through the black smoke demons are made of. Hester's silky wing is brushing against my back – in every battle he spontaneously positions himself to have my back covered.
We turn around to face a second-class Cherub. Even though he is much smaller and less powerful, his three yellow eyes look down on us with a gaze of superiority.
Zachariah stuffs one last cake into his mouth and pats my shoulder before flying away, followed by the other Angels.
Now this is not ordinary. And this won’t allow any kind of reproduction. What is the point of all this?
"All I can tell you is that Camael's mission is the latest attempt from Heaven to instill Faith, love and fear of the Lord in Humans."
He understands now. I can't stay here any longer, he might blurt out something that would compromise me.
With time, I’ve come to understand Father's interest in His latest creations: they are complex, unpredictable, inventive and fascinating.
"Indeed. Have you taken a close look at them? Most Humans are very ugly, of course, but there are a few rare ones that are quite pleasant to look at. I’m in charge of selecting the human bloodlines that will become some day our vessels, and I make it a point to wipe the ugly ones from the list. When the day comes, I’d like to possess a drop dead gorgeous Human, thank you very much."
The General's Grace is swirling and clouding, but she quickly puts herself together. Her posture stiffens.
"Pharaoh's army is moving into the passage! They're going to catch them! Run away, tiny Humans, run away!"
We move as one, taking hold of the rebel despite of his cries of protest. Once he's held down on the ground by four of us, Anael steps closer and kneels, looking down at him with sad eyes, fingertips brushing against the chiselled curve of his face.
Clutching the heavy book under my arm, I fly out of Heaven to the place I pointed out to Dean, faster than ever before in my life.
On these words, he rushes up the stairs with a terrified look on his face. I look away in disappointment. Clearly, writing is the most beautiful and powerful thing about Chuck - I was not expecting such a cowardly attitude.
I watch as he lowers his arms and opens his eyes. The look on his face is diametrically different from Cain’s usual one. Even more so because now, over this face, a second and translucent one is superimposed. Michael’s face. It is so strange that such a tiny creature can contain inside him the eldest of the Archangels.
Or the choice to believe what the demon-blooded boy and a rebel who abandoned me said: that my Father no longer gives the orders. Which would mean that I made Dean endure a cruel hardship on an illegitimate order, that an Angel possibly slaughtered my most loyal soldiers because they believed they were following God's orders, and that something is definitely wrong at the highest command. Although horrifying, believing this would preserve my Faith - my Father would still be the merciful and benevolent God I've always pictured in my mind. It would explain so much... my unanswered prayers, the hierarchy's disregard for us, and all the orders I have reluctantly executed.
"Silence," Anna interrupts exasperatedly. "And finally, this is Baradiel, formerly of the Rock Division. He is one of the oldest Angels created. His wisdom and experience will be most useful to us."
I rise to my feet, the sudden move scaring away hundreds of birds perched on me, and I fly to the sky, screaming Anael’s name to give the alarm.
He said my name - the shortened version that he was the first one to use - with a hint of resentment, as he holds the blade tighter in his hand.
"We’re wasting time with stupid questions. The Human female will manage to raise Henok on her own. Let’s get to the point. We need Cain’s consent, don’t we?"
Her blue eyes are filled with ice-cold rage. Her soul is still as pure and bright as the day she was born, but tormented. I see despair. Hatred. And one last glimmer of hope… one last single hope that we will bring back her children to her. A silent supplication.
