Sherlock did remember; of course he did. That had been one of their very first cases together, one of the first moments he’d ever felt real connection to anybody. John had been so very valuable on that case, serving as his helper and his confidant and his supporter and his bodyguard sometimes all at the same time. And the case itself had been his most gruesome at that point, with a murdered music professor whose eyes had been gouged out and throat slit by an angry governess, the image of which had evidently implanted itself onto Sherlock’s mind after the fact.
As he left the room, he didn’t want to think about it—really, he wasn’t trying at all—but with every step his mind was recalling and calculating all the numbers of times he’d seen kisses, touches, covert whispers…. The runaway thoughts would follow him all the way to Scotland Yard, he knew.
When he failed to continue, seemingly fumbling to put his wants into words, Sherlock sat up straighter to arrest his attention. John was holding himself back again; Sherlock could see it clearly now where he never had before. And if it was the death of him, he’d make sure John Watson never had to hold anything back from him again. He was determined to know and love this man in the same measures he’d been known and loved all this time.
“After everything,” Sherlock continued, scarcely able to believe it, “everything I’ve done, all the ways I’ve failed, you
. It had never been. It must have been her. But was it on purpose, or was she as much a victim to her abilities as he was, using them unwittingly and without malice meant? Or was it all intentional, but for the purest reasons—because she thought she was doing the right thing, enticing him to make the right decisions for all of them?
“I don’t think we’re going to.  Unless...”  John pulled out his wallet and procured a card.  “We phone a friend.”
Sherlock looked perfectly innocent as John’s mind, again, dissolved into a tangle of incoherence.  “So you have sex toys.
“Sex, in every room, on every surface.”  John laughed to himself.  “Maybe it’s a honeymoon thing.  I like the appeal, though.”
Once feeling warm again, John continued his investigation by looking at the walled gardens.  The entire east wing of the house had a nine-foot tall brick wall running parallel to it.  John walked alongside it, taking in the dead ivy and crumbling bricks until he found the entrance -- an archway -- at the front of the house.  The inside would be stunning come spring, he realized immediately. A fountain stood to one side, and a tiny, stone-walled pond to the other.  Arbours covered certain paths; beds where the spring flowers would soon appear flanked the paths.  Shrubs stood stalwartly, unaffected by the late winter's chill.  John spent nearly twenty minutes poking around.  It obviously wasn’t the mysterious garden Mrs. Hudson spoke of.  Or was it?  John went back to the entry arch and tried to estimate the length to the back wall.  The last portion, he could tell, extended to the end of the house entirely, wherever the back wall of the garden ended at the second to last set of windows.  He hobbled out and around again to see more closely for himself.  Indeed, the ivy-covered wall wrapped all the way around.  There was no sign of a door or gateway arch, however, anywhere.  It was almost as if it was not just locked, as Mrs. Hudson said, but hidden away on purpose, blotted out of existence.
“Rimming,” I say, drawing the word the word out in my deepest register.  Yes, John.  I do, without question.
John had many memorable blowjobs in his life - some in some insane crazy locations by a few of his more adventurous girlfriends - but nothing compared to this.  And it had everything,
“Mummy enjoyed going to the Grand Theatre and Opera House, and my father liked visiting the tropical gardens at Roundhay Park.  We were often busy when I was young, but Mummy got started on her research and Mycroft went off to London and... I enjoy solitude.  Sometimes I’d go into the city by myself, just to explore.  It’s not London, but it’s a decent enough place.  Above-average crime rate. Harold Shipman studied medicine there.”
“Why?” asked John, feeling significantly better, his discomfort alleviated both by the release of gaseous pressure and the boyish camaraderie.  Sometimes he missed the easy, mindless way men came together, the way he and his mates would joke around after a rugby match at university, or later, while he was deployed, the way he and his fellow soldiers would find amusement in nothing worth any significance: practical jokes, stupid old movies, and, of course, bodily functions.
John shrugged his shoulders.  In the distance, the sounds of the colour cannons continued.  “I don’t pity you,” he said, and meant it.  John’s own family issues were complex.  And he definitely didn’t want pity from anyone either.  But Sherlock had only been 13.  Surely he couldn’t have been expected, exceptional mind or not, to solve his own father’s murder?
The flush of the angry woman’s face faded a bit, and she laughed dryly.  “I thought he was some kind of...sick voyeur.  He told me he was writing an article for a contemporary women’s magazine about men’s opinions of women’s personal grooming.  He said he had a few questions and wanted to do a write-up of the spa.  Then - boom - he’s got his nose in everyone’s business!  Then he told me about...” She blushed.  “Never mind.”
“He said you were home,” Owens said to Sherlock.  “He kept going on and on about you, how proud he was of you, how you were so clever, were doing so well at school, how interesting your experiments were.  It’s an unfair world, Mr. Holmes.  Do you know what I would have given to have a father like yours?  One who looked at me as yours looked at you?  My father thought I was filth!  And you were treasured.  You had everything you ever wanted or needed, but you didn’t even care!”
There was a murmur among the crowd and shortly someone came up with one.  “Barbara, you’re in shock.  I’m going to inject you with epinephrine.  Can you understand me?”  He pulled the safety release from the device.
John took a look around at the barbarity of early modern medicine and decided Sherlock had a very limited view of progress.
We fall into bed, facing each other.  John is asleep almost instantly, mouth parted against the pillow.  Sometimes John’s breath smells a certain way.  It’s hard to describe, really.  I can’t seem to come up with appropriate metaphors or even specific adjectives to categorise it.  But sometimes it smells sort of sweetish, and I get hard in a manner of seconds.  Then again, sometimes his breath smells horrible (prawn cocktail crisps) and I get hard just as quickly.  He hasn’t eaten anything in ages, or brushed his teeth, but his breath comforts me and I close my eyes and fall asleep smiling.
“But I wouldn’t be averse to taking things further.  If you want.  I’ve been tested if you’re concerned.”
He shot what would have been his limit if the season were open (just how much power DID Mycroft Holmes have, anyway?  Enough to have the authorities turn a blind eye to illegal game hunting, at the least) and turned back to the house.  Insteading of going in the front, however, he walked behind Holmes Hall to bring Toby back to Lestrade, who was probably still tinkering around in his shop.
I was challenged by JanusJupiter on Tumblr to write something erotic with the word "moist" and make it actually work.  Erotic and gross.  My favorite combo.  Keepin' it real, yo.
Sherlock was quiet and withdrawn when they returned to Holmes Hall.  John was exhausted after getting very little sleep the night before, so he said goodnight to Sherlock, who decided to find out as much as he could about Miles Donovan.
John walked out on his knees a bit to meet him.  “Sherlock, are you telling me that this whole hair business - you really thought I’d be repulsed by - oh, God, the
In which John is brilliant, Sherlock makes a confession, and someone has been meddling, but it's all good.
Jenny touched his arm and laughed.  “Valerie Singleton, right John?” she asked.  John hadn’t a clue what’d she was talking about.
John closes his mouth.  It’s not as if he can’t afford those ridiculous boots.  He has more than enough to live comfortably.  He has enough to travel, even.  Be indulgent once in awhile.  It’s just the purpose of the thing.  What is it about Sherlock and footwear?  John likes a quality shoe as much as the next man, but he’d better damn well be able to run in it.
Outside, the September wind blew through the heathered moors, whipped through the branches of the trees.  It blew over the garden walls below; nothing stirred within.  Sherlock’s roses, now heavy with scarlet-hued hips, slept on, undisturbed.  Within the stone walls of Holmes Hall, in an upstairs room in a bed walled-in by their worldly possessions, two men did too.
John wasn’t thinking of kissing him after all. He can feel himself blushing furiously, the skin of his cheeks flaring with heat.  It’s an alien feeling, a strange and ugly full-body wash of shame.
John meant to wait up but fell asleep on the sofa.  He woke late in the morning thinking that maybe Sherlock had touched him in his sleep, placed a hand on his head, smoothed his hair.  But he couldn’t be sure.  He wondered what it would be like to lie with Sherlock on the sofa, both on their sides, snuggled in, snoozing on a lazy afternoon, dust motes swirling in the air while London went about its business around them.  Would that be something Sherlock would even want?  Would he be demonstrative?  Affectionate?  Or would their physical interactions take place only behind locked doors, away from public scrutiny?  What was sex, exactly, to Sherlock?  A biological imperative?  Although Sherlock always maintained that John knew him better than anyone else, John still couldn’t predict how his friend would act, what would change, when their relationship finally moved from just friends to lovers.  And how would John explain his...inadequacies...in bed?  What kind of lover would Sherlock be?  Attentive and thorough?  Bossy and dominating?  Shy and clumsy?  All at once?
“What’s happened this time?” John asks, tucking the phone between his cheek and shoulder as he sorts through test results and hospital reports.  He’s swamped and has no time for Sherlock’s shenanigans.
Suddenly, John felt very old and boring and completely unworthy of Sherlock Holmes, gorgeous naked sex god.  He huffed a sad-sounding sigh.  “I’m sorry, Sherlock.  It looks as if you’ll be stuck with Grandpa John and his plain old vanilla sex preferences for the time being.”
Sherlock was visibly shaking when they parted, lips wet and flushed.  “John,” he said, voice gravelly and deep as his hips thrust up against John’s, “I need more.  I want...I want to...oh God.”
Nevertheless, he still felt awful, and while Sherlock had assured him that he was all right, it didn’t change the fact that John had, with all his might, smashed his elbow directly into Sherlock’s slumbering, slack-jawed face.  His nose had erupted like a fountain.  John was still tending to it when Sherlock’s mobile rang.  Sherlock rode to the crime scene with gauze stuffed up his nose.  Before exiting the cab, he’d plucked each one daintily from each nostril and deposited the bloody things into John’s hands.
“Not too long ago I might have said yes, but now I have life anew and I’ve concluded that one could never have enough adventure, John.”
“No!” he half-shouted, and then restrained himself, for as maddening and sickening as the whole thing had been, he at least refused to cause them any more needless hurt by wording this tactlessly. “She—your-your mother, she pushed me.”
At Sherlock's predictably vague and witty, if delayed, response, Michael simply smiled, changed the focus of the strange meeting into a surprise reveal of the pair of concert tickets he’d procured for himself and John, and then they left, with Sherlock standing there wondering if he’d ever once in his life been clever if he hadn’t seen this coming in all those years.
“How long?” Sherlock repeated unconcernedly, his own thoughts barely making sense to him except for that one word,
“He was better to me than I deserved,” was his simple answer, and then he followed Sherlock’s lead. “I’m going to unpack and ready for bed.”
“It went better than I had anticipated. He knew all along, after all, how I really felt about you. He said…”
He gave her a look that made it clear he would put up with no teasing from her about it. Sherlock observed the glare that passed from him to her and how it made her smile only widen all the more, and the detective wondered what he’d missed. Bea had known all along that John loved him, somehow. Some detective he’d turned out to be, in fact. It had taken her hardly any time to discover John Watson’s greatest secret, while it had taken Sherlock twenty bloody years.
That made the doctor look up in concealed surprise, just as he’d suspected it would, for there was no haughty self-satisfaction in his voice, no arrogance like there used to be, but only pure soft gratitude.
He didn’t want to say it aloud. That might make it real. But he did anyway, because they had to start speaking the truth, to each other and to themselves.
sure, about everything, and just like back then he drifted into a perfectly restful and dreamless sleep.
really that important that they be entirely clean today. After all, you’ll be seen with me, and by comparison you’ll be dressed like a perfect professional even if your boots are a bit dirty.”
But that had been years ago, so many, many years—nearly twenty in fact, and all those admiring acquaintances and so-called friends had been gone for so long he’d forgotten half their names. All except one, that one who had
in there, and John’s heart connected with that enigmatic soul which somehow made its packaging incredibly scintillating.  The mind inside that body was brilliant, but the body itself wasn’t half bad.  Okay, it was gorgeous.  Tall, angular, lithe, pale - everything that John’s wasn’t.
Melissa gave them a perplexed look at Sherlock’s desire to accompany John but not participate.  She showed them both into the “Forest Retreat” room, produced a plush robe and slippers from a cupboard, and told John to enjoy himself.
“Yes, but not all doctors can be army doctors, now, can they?  It takes a certain skill set, a specific type of person.”
The pain was ebbing now, a bad sign.  The shoulder was worse than the leg, he could tell; bones shattered in the shoulder joint itself, the scapulae a ruin.  The round that hit his leg may even have nicked the femoral artery.
John shook his head.  Everyone kept saying that, it seemed.  Sherlock chose his lot, and depression aside, John thought that the man was very comfortable in his own skin, as happy as he could be as long as his mind was stimulated.
you,” Watson now spoke up, a hard edge like accusation in his tone, his stoney features impossible to read in the slanted four o’clock sunlight but delightfully familiar all the same. “You ran. You had never planned on leaving that cavern without her. The moment you knew she couldn’t leave, you knew you would stay, and you
“John?” he called out from where he’d been arranging some old newspaper clippings in the sitting room floor.
“I wonder,” he started again, taking strength from where his palm was flat over John’s heart, “if maybe I
But then that shyness dissipated into a deep uncertainty, which was equally as rare in John Watson’s demeanor and gave Sherlock pause in his playfulness.
He turned away and pretended to busy himself by straightening some books on the shelves by the window, but he glanced over to his friend and was not disappointed. John looked to be greatly confused at Sherlock’s candid observations. (And to be honest, so was Sherlock himself. He had intended this as an opening into a new era of healthy friendship fueled by mutual respect and support, but his own mouth had taken a turn he hadn’t expected there. He wasn’t speaking in vain flattery, though; John’s eyes were his most expressive feature. Sherlock had always thought so, for even when his friend tried to hide every emotion behind a facade of stoicism, a hint of his true heart always whispered in his keen, mournful eyes. Their immense history and secrecy turned the doctor’s classic handsomeness into more than just that; they made him a mysterious man as well as an attractive one. It was one of the things that had endeared him to Sherlock from the day they'd met.)
That was true enough, he supposed, though he imagined it was more difficult to live with a narcissistic, ego-crazed, half-abusive cocaine addict than with a sometimes-cranky but mostly soft-spoken war hero. He had suspected John of so much back then, and someday he guessed they would still need to work all that out. But after everything, here they were, and for now that was enough.
“Well,” he said, stepping toward him with a contained eagerness to show off his restored deducing ability, “your boots told me.”
. He was going to do everything he could to be good to him, and figuring out exactly how to do that would be the most important, and most enjoyable, mystery he’d ever unravel, he was sure.
, my god it was still so difficult to comprehend—whispered in muted horror. “Mother…she used her powers on you, to make you go?”
Sherlock was sitting, on an underwater bench, apparently, with his head tipped back and eyes closed.
“Hmm?”  he murmured, listening to the night sounds of London and Sherlock’s breathing.  It felt strange, being in Sherlock’s room instead of his own, but the bed was comfortable and it felt so good to be home.
But she’s not done.  She’s searching for the right words.  He hasn’t heard Mary’s ghost in nearly fifteen years, but he can almost her whisper,
Something dark passed across Sherlock’s eyes. “Don’t be an idiot, John.  She’s proud.  I’m betting she is extremely skilled at her art.  Maybe you can get her to stroke your feet as well.”
Sherlock gently worked the lubricant around his entrance before applying more to his fingers and pushing it carefully inside.
John summoned his Watson resolve and walked past the large pool and back to the dark recesses of the warm, steamy area which currently housed a very naked Sherlock Holmes.
“I told you before that I do not particularly like to be touched, and you are aware that I have very acute senses.  I’ve made my body transport for a reason, John.  If I paid too much attention to it I would never get anything accomplished.  I know.  I’ve made that mistake before.  Disconnecting the body from the mind was necessary to the work, and so I mastered my body.  However, I know that for most people, you included, attention to bodies is...important.  Necessary, even.  I...”  Sherlock chewed his words for a moment.  John let him.
Mr. Campbell made an affirmative noise at that.  “You couldn’t keep a secret from him if you tried.”
Unlike my dog, I have never made a habit of judging people by sniffing their genitals.   That would be a bit extreme, even for me.  But Redbeard knew how to distinguish the scent of home, knew the smell of his master.  Sometimes I plant my nose in John’s crotch and just breathe.  He pets my hair and I wish I had a dog’s nose to categorise everything my feeble human one cannot detect.
The only time John actually saw Sherlock genuinely weep was at when they saw Hilary Hahn perform Sibelius’ violin concerto at the Barbican.  Tickets had appeared in the post one day around Sherlock’s birthday (Mycroft’s doing, John assumed) and Sherlock seemed genuinely pleased to have them that John couldn’t say no to accompanying him, even if it looked suspiciously like a date.  In retrospect, it
The last thing he wanted to be doing was listening to a bunch of cultured know-it-alls discuss the value of every last bit of Holmes Hall.  After making sure everyone was where they were supposed to be, he slipped out.
He could have as many minutes as he needed.  John looked down, between them, seeing Sherlock’s cock, hard and nearly purple between them, his balls nestled up against John’s pubic bone.  Oh God.  They were
“That is not what I asked.”  Another long pause.  “Dr. Watson, I assure you that there is no need for a deadly weapon within Holmes Hall, regardless of what you think you might have heard.  But if you really would like to, you may use a shotgun for hunting. My father’s over-under is in the study.  We have an abundance of pheasant, and if you’re keen you may hunt on the property.  Rabbits are plentiful, and there are foxes that are occasionally troublesome, as well.  I must caution you, however, that under no circumstances should you keep a weapon in your room or carry it while fulfilling your security duties.  If I find that you do so, you will find yourself facing more dire consequences than simply having your contract terminated.  And trust me, Doctor, I will know if you do.  Now.  If your trigger finger’s feeling...neglected...take it out on the birds.  Or there’s a shooting range a few miles east.”
, a piece that was never meant to be played on any brass instrument, much less the tuba.  A challenge, then.
He opens his eyes.  “You’re beautiful,” he murmurs, words that make my chest ache.  No, John.  We’re beautiful.  This, us, together.  I use the moment to push my middle finger in, too, and he groans and arches, his hand moving faster over himself.  I move my hand so I can press his perineum with my thumb.  The smell of sex is heady.
“Glitter is tiny pieces of cut up foil, whereas shimmer is mica.   Cosmetics contain both.  I’d like to test the various properties of shimmer and glitter in both cheap and professional-grade cosmetics and see what traces they would leave from skin-to-skin contact, such as a casual embrace or a sexual encounter.”
Thanks again to BettySwallocks, whose help and encouragement have made this what it is.  Infinite thanks.
That’s not to say he doesn’t like anal play, however. He does.  Quite a bit, as it turns out.  I am rather dexterous with my fingers, and talking isn’t all my tongue is good for.
“Maybe your father gave it to her, as a token of friendship.  Could it have been his buttonhole for the day?”
“I just can’t seem to take it all in,” lamented Mr. Leybourne, whose hand seemed a bit shaky around his teacup.  “She was such a lovely girl.  And all the while, she and Robert...arrested for manslaughter...”  His nose turned red, and for an instant John was sure he was going to cry again.  Sherlock did
John helped the two men put biscuits, tea, and a glass jar shaped like a beehive on an intricately-wrought silver platter, then followed them out to the back garden, which adjoined the canal towpath.  Mr. Chapman had a small but beautiful lawn and flowerbeds, complete with a little brick patio.  They sat down, and Mr. Campbell insisted on serving.  They drank tea and ate biscuits as Mr. Chapman detailed his recent visit to the Hebden Bridge vintage fair and the oddities he’d picked up there.
Now in Sherlock’s arms, John focused on catching his breath, simply enjoying the feel of being buoyant, the slip of cool water on his skin.  He’d never been in this position before, being carried face-to-face by another man.  Naked.  The fact that Sherlock was a man was making itself blatantly obvious at the moment, too.
“Yes, I think so.”  Sherlock held the keys in his palm for a moment before unlocking the first, old lock, and then the more modern one.  He then handed them back to John.  “For your safekeeping,” he said, and pushed open the door.
“Deleted.”  Sherlock turned away from the offending exhibit and moved on scene in which a plastic girl was in the process of having her gangrened limb amputated by a plastic doctor with a very real-looking blade.  “I have a memory system of sorts.  Look, John.  They don’t have any bandages.  And she’s going to bleed all over the floor if they cut her like that.  Have you done amputations?”
want to have some kind of man-to-man deep relationship talk with you right now, okay?  Sherlock and I...we’re just...”  John sighed.  That was the problem, wasn’t it.  They were “just”.  Just friends, just flatmates, just an inseparable pair.  “We’re just us,” he settled for.  “Sherlock doesn’t
Less than a minute later, he heard both his and Sherlock’s phones chime simultaneously- a text from Lestrade.  He’d just sent the autopsy report via e-mail.
“What’s it called?”  John had learned that roses, the prize racehorses of gardens, had extensive and complicated nomenclature.
John laughed.  “That’s not flirting.  It’s manipulation.  Look, Sherlock, I’ve got us this far, alright?  Trust me.  Bodies, remember.
When John finally felt he wouldn’t hurt his lover, he no longer tried to hold it back, and he thrust in earnest, holding to whatever part of Sherlock he could grip - a hand, a thigh.  Gone was his precision.  He was vaguely aware of his own vocalisations as he pumped his hips.  The entire universe had shrunk down to this room, this bed, these two men, flesh slapping against flesh as their bodies learned one another, pleasured one another, loved one another.
something to him, inadvertently, perhaps, that would damage Sherlock Holmes more than he was positive she’d done to Mrs. Jenkins.
for Sherlock, but it came as naturally to John as breathing.  His body would betray him, override his head and heart and then there would either be mind-blowing sex or Sherlock would retreat deep into his head and the man John had grown to love would be lost to him forever.
“No, come on,” said John, trying to get off the bike without toppling both of them over.  “If everyone’s here for the race, there won’t be so many people poking about the rest of the place.”
Gathering his courage, John slipped his hand under the waistband of Sherlock’s trousers, his fingertips working their way under the elastic of his pants, through the warm, crisp hair of his groin, closer and closer to what was sure to be an absolutely gigantic…
“We’ve only recently been on speaking terms again,” said Sherlock.  “We’re trying to reconcile old differences.  This is his way of apologising, I imagine.”
“Yeah.”  The two men gave John the list again, and he’d folded it back to tuck in his notebook when a new thought struck him.  “Oh, just out of curiosity, do either of you know Sally Donovan?”
He started swimming in the pool to build up his strength and mobility, and he rode his bicycle to the train station on work days: might as well keep trying to get his leg to cooperate.  The bloody thing gave him trouble when he least expected it to, even though he knew that there was no physiological reason for it to still be acting up.  Sometimes his thigh just ached, and he’d lie in a hot bath, trying not to look at the scar, which still looked comically like a purple arrow pointing to his penis.  That particular organ had been completely neglected since his injury.  He rarely, if ever, woke with an erection, and the three times he tried to pleasure himself had failed miserably, ending in flaccidity and frustration.  He always had struggled with emotional intimacy, but physical intimacy had always come so easy to him, second nature, really.  He’d had a small but trim body, his face wasn’t unpleasant, and while women tended to think he was more “cute” than “gorgeous,” he knew he wasn’t a bad-looking man.  Now, having lost most of the muscles he’d maintained simply by carrying his pack, he felt weak and damaged and scarred.
She draws up a knee and leans her chin on it.  “Nina’s mum has a friend.  A single friend.  A single, interested friend.”
“The sepals, there, contain the flower within.  Rapid cellular elongation within the petals themselves will force the sepals apart.  They will peel back so the rose can bloom properly.”
“Mr. Owens, I don’t want to be a pest, but I find myself really needing to use the loo.  Would you mind if…”  He jerked his head toward the house.
“It’s highly unlikely I woke up from your stare alone. I must have heard you.”  John closed his eyes again.
John had settled in for the evening when he heard a noise in the corridor.  Panic raced through his veins and he eyed the fireplace poker before steeling his resolve and taking a deep breath.  He got quietly out of bed, tiptoed across the room, and flung open the door.
“Apparently the heat has caused everyone to sit home and be miserable.  Odd, that.  Usually hot weather escalates crime.  Anyway, no.  The good people of Leeds have been behaving themselves and the country folk couldn’t muster up a good mystery if they tried.  I have been researching, however.”
Inseparable, that is, except for one issue; it was the same one that had plagued him from the start. A year ago, he’d believed it to be displeasure that John was no longer living there, no longer just across the hall from his room, a constant that was both useful and comforting. But it wasn’t just that, was it? It was that John was off living with
He hated it, making accusations like this that he couldn’t confirm, as much as he feared they were true. But John’s instincts had always been powerful, perhaps better than his own, and the other man’s piteous look told him he was probably right to accuse. He’d been changed, turned into a man who would pack up and leave during an apocalypse, who would abandon his dearest friend to fight it alone and potentially die while he hid someplace safe, and no matter how blind or selfish he’d been then, that wasn’t
Sherlock could feel that his own face had gone slack and colorless with the shock, but he could not find his voice to interrupt and could only listen as the words poured from John’s mouth like he couldn’t stop them any longer, and perhaps he couldn’t.
Sherlock’s startled gaze lifted to meet his again, for though he was trying his damned best to fix his mistakes, he in no way saw himself as
felt refreshed enough to bother with such a menial task when it wasn’t necessary. Hence, you went to bed early and slept well.”
This was certainly a problem, but he didn’t know what the solution could possibly be. What could he say? They weren’t tied to one another in any way that would justify bringing up his odd covetousness, and he didn’t even really understand the feeling enough to explain it anyway. John wasn’t his
Sherlock’s hands faltered on the photographs for only a moment as he stacked them, but recovered before she could possibly notice. The irony of her casual observation was that some part of him, for reasons he couldn’t quite understand, was hoping no one else had noticed that.
John stifled a grin at that. Sherlock Holmes had never appreciated the effort that went into dressing like a gentleman, but these days the only tie he even owned was inside his kit of disguises, to be worn only when absolutely necessary. John Watson, on the other hand, always dressed well and everyone recognized it.
The vehemence with which the question was put startled Sherlock as much as the news itself had. John had always been a man of intensity, which manifested itself as a temper that was sometimes a little too quick when he was stressed or upset. But rarely was that temper turned upon Sherlock, and so when it did occur he often reacted poorly as well. This time, however, he felt no countering irritation, but only an immense sympathy for his friend, who had never had a love like Michael before as far as Sherlock knew.
Something like a sob choked his voice for only a second, as his hands tightened on the wooden frame of the sofa so hard Sherlock feared he’d have bruises on his palms or do damage to his joints, and his face took on a look of agonized fury though he still never raised his eyes to look at Sherlock.
I know how you take your tea—just a splash of cream and a biscuit on the side even if you won’t admit it.”
Sherlock frowned at that, for he rarely saw his friend in such a disputatious mood these days (as he himself rarely was too, in fact). As he knew John had no quarrel with the children, that left only one person who could illicit such a reaction in him. It was likely a problem, then, with Michael.
Sherlock couldn’t bear to look at him any longer; turning his back and taking a couple of steps into the unlit side of the room, he tried to organize the sudden onslaught of dizzying emotions while being overwhelmed at seeing John in such gut-wrenching distress. And how many years had he been? How had Sherlock never known it until now, when it had been so clear all along?
“I suppose so,” he replied, hanging the hat on the stand and adding his coat with it. “Why do you say that?”
He looked up, and he wasn’t sure if it was his lack of clarity or the pure joy alighting his gaze, but John seemed to be as confused as ever by his behavior. The other man regarded him with an exhausted sort of bewilderment that screamed of his own dejection.
And Sherlock was only just now remembering that he’d never told him so, had he? Seeing him glow with Michael’s praises had felt strange because John had never
“I…suppose it might be habit. Michael always left our bedroom door open. And it is somewhat cold tonight so I thought it would be warmer that way.”
So he stepped forward and closed the distance between them; reaching out with one hand, slowly so as not to startle his friend, he pressed his palm against the left side of the other man’s chest, and he could feel the pounding of that strong heart even though John was fighting to look as calm as he could on the outside. The other man’s exhausted eyes scrutinized Sherlock’s face as the detective watched his own fingertips toy with John’s collar for a moment, the familiarity of the gesture overwhelmingly comforting even though he couldn’t recall ever having done it before.
Bea’s grin widened, but she let it go for now and went to fetch more of the extra tea Sherlock now purchased just for them.
I just want to be clear here that I’m not against Alice as a character! And I don’t actually think the canon meant for her to be manipulative or anything. I just never felt like her relationship with Sherlock was a healthy one with true love, honestly, especially there at the very end. I mean she started the apocalypse ON PURPOSE but he still chose her?? Not my cup of tea for romance at all…plus, okay, yes, I want John to have the chance to be happy with Sherlock, damn it. But I just wanted to be clear that I’m
was the first moment in which Sherlock Holmes realized that John Watson had learned to confide in someone other than him—in fact, he’d confided in Michael Morstan
“Why?” Bea demanded, having the presence of mind to speak up before any of the rest of them could even process his words. “Why would you leave it open to come back? You made your choice. You left to be with our mum.”
Sherlock supposed he should feel more appreciative of how impressed Michael was, and how he grinned with John’s infectious enthusiasm and congratulated the great detective on his brilliance, but somehow Sherlock didn’t feel as uplifted as Michael intended, because the man applauded John equally. For a sickening moment upon realizing that, Sherlock thought he was jealous because John was receiving praise for a case, and he thought himself an awful and repellant friend; but then he realized after the pair had departed for lunch that he hadn’t been jealous of John at all.
. John had saved him, over and over again since the very start, not just from bullets or knives (though those were numerous as well) but from much more—from loneliness when they'd first met, from obscurity through his stories, from grief after Alice, from overdose. In the last three years he’d cared for Sherlock’s daughters and paid the rent on Sherlock’s abandoned apartment and solved Sherlock’s cases all while Sherlock himself had been gone seemingly forever. He had made mistakes, it was true, some of which Sherlock probably didn’t even know, but he’d taken responsibility as best he could when other men might have folded or made excuses. He was magnificent, truly.
“So what am I supposed to do now?” John’s voice was rough and jagged, and he didn’t even seem to be addressing Sherlock anymore, but possibly rather the uncaring universe outside the window. “What the
He could see the answer in John’s whole posture, how his shoulders dropped and his brow softened. They were both recalling the same circumstances, Sherlock knew—those five years of arrogance and ignorance on his part, the next ten full of grief-fueled fights and blame and bitterness, and the those last three in which he’d seemingly abandoned John without gratitude or care. They both knew how dark their relationship had gotten at some points, and how so much of it was Sherlock’s fault, and yet all he could see in John’s face was love,
When he had no choice but to confirm the awful, tangled truth, poor Bea denied it with a fury, argued back and forth amongst the group of them for nearly half an hour, and finally stormed from the house and did not return until the next day.
He felt his breath even as the most peculiar peace swept over him, his eyes wide as he put a voice to his swirling thoughts at last.
He didn’t notice it, then, when John paused in the doorway and looked back into the sitting room just as Sherlock turned up a couple of the gaslights. His dark, tired, slightly disoriented but now-peaceful eyes followed the detective’s movements for a few seconds as he moved about the room collecting the mess of papers, his form still elegant despite the permanent damage the drugs had done to his nerves—forever slim, oddly fragile despite his wiry strength, and possessed of a peculiar masculine grace not unlike the Stradivarius violin he loved so dearly. This man was John’s to touch now, after years of silent, painful yearning. The thought almost took his breath away.
He smiled back at her, always a little shamefacedly with the guilt forever tucked into the back of his head, but reminded himself he could only do his very best to be the girls’ dad from now on and try to forgive
“I loved you,” the brave man whispered brokenly. “I always loved you, more than anybody else ever could. And there were moments there in the beginning when I thought—I fooled myself into thinking you might love me in return, even just a fraction, even if it would never be returned the same way. But then there was Alice, and you…you chose her, over and over again, and you drifted so far from me you didn’t even look at me anymore, much less
years of his life previously in a cocaine-hazed hell of his own errant emotions, and yet it felt like a whole lifetime somehow. London had recovered from the darkness that had manipulated its citizens into nightmarish monsters; apparently “experts” had finally concluded the whole thing was due to mushrooms in the water supply or some such foolishness, though the common belief was still in the supernatural. Prince Leopold was engaged to be married to Princess Helena; Sherlock still didn’t quite understand how the lad had become a part of everything in the first place, but he’d let that question go. The children, who were all young adults now, really, had done up their little cellar dwelling a street over from Baker Street; it was now brighter, warmer, better-furnished, full of light and laughter and a little household of four all healthy in both body and mind. And John…
Sherlock tilted his head curiously, his eyes—those devastatingly sharp and brilliant deep brown eyes—narrowed on him in scrutiny.
“Really?” she said, and he wasn’t sure if he was imagining the knowing lilt underlying her neutral tone. “I thought you noticed everything now that your brain’s working again.”
“Tell me, John,” he found himself commanding, his voice much harder than he’d intended. “No more lies. We’re finished with all that.”
A moment of indecision twitched in John’s jaw, but then the man answered with just slightly more openness, and some sadness,
John frowned down at the pair of them—unmarred leather gleaming in the morning light streaming through the windows, subtle and practical but clearly of the finest quality once one bothered to look closer and see it, much like John himself.
. He was free to live wherever he wished, with whomever he wished, just as Sherlock had been free to choose Alice.
. This was so very different; John knew the best of him and the worst of him, had lived with him for more than a decade, had held countless long conversations with him already about every subject under the sun, and would certainly
“Back in those days before the Rip, why didn’t you tell me you were attracted to men? Or even afterward?”
(Billy, Sherlock had noticed in the last months, tended to gravitate toward the doctor almost like a kitten emulating its mother's feline skills...or rather a better comparison was a cub emulating a mighty lion. His past experiences had clearly made Billy slow to trust and quick to fight, but luckily both of these qualities were well understood by John. The man had managed to win Billy over not only through personal understanding of that mistrust and temper, but also because he was willing to take the time to teach the young man all the skills he'd wanted to learn but had had no father to teach him—specifically, self-defense and the defense of others. Now Billy was certainly more confident than he had been in the past, and though he carried himself like a strong man, his quick eyes still sought out John like a boy in search of his father's attention every time he entered the house.)
Three pairs of eyes sought out Bea’s opinion as Sherlock offered the man his own teacup whilst settling his hand on the doctor’s shoulder with an uncommon warmth. Sherlock looked intently into John’s face, which John allowed, still holding the teacup in one hand without sipping from it yet; seeing that the other man was steady after his difficult conversation with Michael, Sherlock sat up again but did not remove his hand from John’s shoulder.
No answer came, but John entered the room and tossed his coat over the back of the settee with the same measure of heavy forcefulness he’d possessed near-stomping up the staircase.
He’d thought himself to be awake when he’d felt John’s fingers brush against his shoulder. He’d opened his eyes into the early morning sunlight in his bedroom only to find the fingers that were touching him were dripping blood onto his mattress, and John was staring at him through empty, bloodied sockets, his throat parted straight across the center so that a waterfall of red soaked his new friend’s shirt and vest. He’d awoken in reality a second later, his bedroom still dark with night, the drugs having convinced his sleeping mind that John had been murdered sometime in the last week due to his own failure to apprehend the murderess in time. And yes, he had been so terrified that he hadn’t even considered how rude and ridiculous it was to get into someone else’s bed without their permission. He’d just curled up against John so that he could feel his living warmth and slept until noon the following day. It had never occurred to him to wonder why John had still been there when he’d awoken, hadn’t even moved to push Sherlock’s head off his shoulder all night and half the day.
“I…” John’s voice trailed off, as though he were too flustered to string together the proper words, and that was so very unlike him, “I couldn’t—I wasn’t interested in any of those men.”
“Nothing,” he replied, and Sherlock’s observational skills might still be on the mend, but no one would have missed the lack of conviction in the single word. “It’s fine.”
John’s breath stuttered, and Sherlock was horrified to see a single tear slip from one eye and dash itself against the carpet at his feet.
Sherlock spent the next few days letting the girls process it without pushing, because he understood how difficult it was to align all of Alice Flagg’s beautiful and angelic qualities with the monstrous ones mixed between them that seemed to contradict the good in her incomprehensibly. Why? He often wondered in those early days. Why would she scold and shout at him for abandoning their girls (with good reason, of course), but then trick his mind to do exactly that only a moment later to be with her? Why would she have insisted so many times that closing that first rip was everything, but then beg him the next day to move them all to the countryside and never look back, only to change her mind again in an hour? Why did so many of his memories now seem tainted with the realization that his behavior toward her had often bordered on unnatural obsession rather than devotion?
He was surprised, then, when another thirty minutes went by and he heard the floor creak under a heavy step in the hall, and a moment later a quick knock sounded on his shut door.
“It’s like I don’t…belong anywhere.” His voice had faded into nothing but a whisper, like a prayer or a secret he’d never found the words to utter until now, his head bent like a man without hope. “I don’t belong to anyone, and I never will. Because you’ll never want me. You will
He held still and allowed it when Bea did something helpful with the uncooperative sleeve so he could get his arm in more smoothly.
at me. And that’s not fair to him; he deserves so much better than what I can give because I’ve already given everything to
“Yes.  No?”  Sherlock breathed out his nose and looked genuinely distressed.  He’d opened his mouth to say something more but it seemed to have got stuck.  Just then, a heavily built man with a greying ponytail exclaimed, “Well if it isn’t Sherlock Holmes!” and slapped Sherlock on the back.
“The name is Sherlock Holmes,” said the man in the bed, not bothering to extend his hand for a formal introduction.  “And I’m a brilliant high-functioning sociopath with a drug problem.  Nice to meet you.  Now get the fuck out.”
“Suit yourself,” said John, lying back on the table and dangling his feet over the side.   He thought about all the times he had seen his flatmate’s naked feet.  Even his toes were long and slender, like his fingers, and he was prone to wiggling them when bored.  “Observe all you want, but don’t ruin it for me.”
First, some thanks.  To you, the readers, who took a chance on this story and stayed with me; you left awesome comments, recced me on Tumblr, spread the love around.  I appreciate each and every one of you.  To you, Bettyswallocks, who is a dear friend, and Canolacrush, who has become one.  These two people spent hours on this fic.  HOURS.  They deserve a round of applause.
Expecting dinner to be some kind of formal affair with more table settings than he could count, John showered, shaved and put on his best shirt with his green trousers.  It turned out, however, to be a fairly casual event.  Mr. Holmes was apparently running late and wouldn’t be in until the morning.
Leybourne excused himself and fumbled his way out of the garden.  The Inspector officer, a man whose name, John remembered, was Campbell, declared he was had everything needed, shook hands with Lestrade, and said he’d be in touch, before he, too, excused himself.
“Well,” he sighs, pretending to be put out.  “What is it this time?  ‘Cause if you’re asking to go to Glastonbury again, you’ve got another think coming.”
“She watched our wedding video.  But she didn’t mean mine and Mary’s.  She meant ours, Sherlock.  I married both of you that day.”
John shoots him an incredulous look.  “The tuba can’t possibly be more challenging than the violin.”
They were people my mother knew from university, mathy-type academics.  She blended in well, finally in her element again, while my father made friendly conversation with other spouses who weren’t quite as brilliant as their mates.  I hated events like those, even if they were far and few between.  Anything that honoured my brother was awful by nature.  However, it did give me an opportunity to observe.  There was a woman there in a black beaded dress who held champagne in one hand and slurped down oysters on the half shell in the other.  She ate three in a row.  Must have been indulging, I mused.  Oysters must not be a luxury she had often but had obviously acquired a taste for them somewhere.  Mycroft, the lardarse, was holding court close to the dessert table, so I, on principle, avoided the entire area, even though I wanted nothing more than one of those little chocolate squares with the raspberries on top.  The woman in the beaded dress took the arm of a man too old for her and disappeared into the crowd.
His eyebrows come together.  He hasn’t been out with a woman in ages.  Years.  Talk about trust issues -- after what happened with Sherlock’s sister, he could barely stomach a woman’s interested smile or raised eyebrow.  And then, finally, when he’d moved on from that, it just didn’t hold the same appeal as it once did.  He had Rosie to think about, after all.  He’s accepted celibacy, too, and the intense longings for physicality have dwindled.  She thinks he’s been dating her whole life?  Is his daughter on drugs?
So with all the grace of a prepubescent child, Sherlock Holmes lifted one of those perfect arsecheeks off the seat and farted so spectacularly that he could no longer be ignored.  The resounding noise eclipsed that of the idling trucks (fuck the peacock - think bellowing rhinoceros) and by the time a wide-eyed John and a slack-jawed Lestrade turned to look back at him, the smell, which was by far more potent than anything produced by a sausage roll, permeated the vehicle.
He departed, leaving John and Sherlock to stare at each other across the table.  John had finished his meal; Sherlock clearly had eaten what he was going to.
“Of course, John.  Do keep up.  Need to test corrosivity of simple bases on soft tissue.  I told you all about it yesterday.”
During acts of love, flesh was beautiful, all types, sizes, and colours.  Combine his love of the flesh with practised and knowing hands, and John Watson made one heck of a lover.  Quite simply, he made women feel beautiful in their own skin, for, under John’s attentions, it
“Some busy you are,” he said at seeing Sherlock spread out on top of his bed like a starfish, staring at the ceiling.
John smiled.  “Let’s see.”  He pulled off the rest of the petals, one by one, before announcing, “Alas, Sherlock.  She does not.”
“Obviously.  Turn him over.”  Sherlock stayed back, lavender rubber-clad fingers steepled under his nose as John and Molly turned the corpse face-down.  “Examine his back.”
“Maybe you should.  Look,” said John, poking at the sausages, “I’ve got an idea.”  He spelled it out to Mrs. Hudson, who raised her eyebrow.
.  Common objects seemed more phallic than ever; even the bananas on the counter with their gentle curve seemed to taunt him.  One afternoon it seemed as if every cloud in the sky was shaped like a dick.  When John changed the toilet roll, he found himself looking askance at the metal rod that held the cardboard tube.  He wondered if he were developing a complex.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him and entered his room, making his way to the table to switch on a lamp.
John finished undressing, hanging his trousers and shirt in the wardrobe and stashing his socks inside his shoes, before sitting on the treatment table.  Sherlock had taken to poking his nose into every bottle he could find.
“Yeah.  Since you’ve had such luck with it.”  He instantly regretted it, although he didn’t take it back.  “Harry, it’s just that…”
John inwardly grimaces.  He despises the name Rosamund but Rosie fits his daughter well.  He hates the new nickname; it’s a constant reminder that his daughter is no longer the little girl she once was.  While he’s glad she’s independent and proud of the young woman she’s becoming, there’s still a part of him that clutches to her babyhood, those nights she’d sleep on his chest, or those days she’d hold his index finger as they’d stroll through Regent’s Park.  He’s never been the type to dote on small children or bemoan their aging, but there was something about being so needed that agreed with him.  However, fatherhood has been exhausting and often frustrating.  Even though they got on fairly well, loved and needed one another, raising a child alone was not the life John had envisioned for himself.
His eyes snapped open to find Sherlock’s boring into them.  Several things happened at once:  No fewer than six different expressions crossed his face - shock, disbelief, fascination, repulsion, fury, and arousal? - before Sherlock launched himself from his chair and bolted from the room; John pulled his feet from James’ hands and sat up so quickly that he nearly kicked the poor man in the face; James held up his oily hands in a gesture of self-defense.
It was serendipitous then that Lestrade’s phone rang, and the conversation turned from the obnoxious topic back to a serious one, something about the case. John took notes on a small notepad as Lestrade spoke; traffic began moving (finally).
“I’d rather hoped you’d say that.”  Sherlock smiled then, a shy smile that John nipped at with his own lips.
Sherlock took John’s hand, wove their fingers together, and held it.  John let him.  They both sat there, staring at the offending ladder, both unable to express the depth, complexity, or intensity of feeling.
“Well, there goes that appointment,” said the manager.  “And she was here for the the full monty.  Damn.”
Sherlock looked pleased and amused, as if he had revealed another clue to a mystery.  John didn’t like it.  It always made him wonder whether Sherlock really could read his mind.  The detective always said he could deduce John’s thoughts simply from his facial expressions - he’d catalogued them all, as far as John knew, on little mental index cards tucked somewhere away in his Mind Palace - but often the things Sherlock knew about John made John think that perhaps Sherlock could see more, see deeper, than surface tells, lines of the face, twitches of the lips.  Of course he could.  They were...friends, after all.  Flatmates.  The other unidentifiable thing of which they did not speak.
“I hadn’t expected this,” murmured Sherlock, nosing at John through the fabric of his trousers.  “Being aroused so easily.  I can’t decide if it's annoying or wonderful.  You’re awfully distracting, and you smell fantastic.”
.  His own shampoo is blue, and who knows what colour Sherlock’s is... but what was on that tile was without a doubt semen.  Sherlock’s, to be exact.
In his spare time, John worked in the garden he now considered his, pulling up weeds, wrangling with vines, and cutting dead wood.  All of Sherlock’s roses got a good trim.  They now looked scraggly, like newly-shorn sheep, and John was afraid that he’d killed them outright until new growth began a week or so later, tiny pink leaflets forming on the remaining stems.
He had an quiet and rather awkward dinner with his sister, who was adamant that he wasn’t “ready” to work again.  Disregarding her concern and promising he’d be fine, he packed his bag, and in the morning, headed to the train station.
Through trial and error, they’d found that John was most comfortable with a certain brand of massage oil than anything else; the smell was pleasant, its viscosity perfect, and one generous application usually lasted the entire time.  Unlike Sherlock, who, under John’s gentle ministrations, opened easily, his anus relaxing nearly on touch, John took a while.  Which was perfectly all right with him because his lover was incredibly skilled with both his fingers and tongue and the whole process felt
After mentally wrestling with logistics, John decided that the optimum massage delivery position was sitting on the backs of Sherlock’s legs - much more comfortable than trying to lean over him from the side.  Clothes were simply going to have to go, so John removed his, manoeuvred Sherlock into position, climbed on top of him, and then had a moment of reflection.
John held up the strip.  “There’s barely any hair on it,  you idiot.  It couldn’t have hurt that badly.”
Angelo gave him a knowing look and Sherlock didn’t bother to correct him.  “I’ll get you the mussels linguine, Mr. Holmes.  Very fresh.  Extra lemon.”
“She’s staying at Rainna’s,” John tells Sherlock after waiting to see if his daughter will apologise.  She doesn’t.
“I’m sorry, my friend,” said Mycroft, who did seem genuinely apologetic  “I had not wanted to mention anything to you until I was sure something was indeed amiss.  It was not my intent to ruin you.”
Jesus.  Was Sherlock just mining for data?  John didn’t think so.  “I haven’t given it much thought,” he answered honestly.  “Not really
Whatever had been holding Sherlock together suddenly breaks, and for no reason, he begins to laugh.  He laughs for a solid minute, a little silly giggle that makes John laugh, and then they pause to catch their breaths, look at one another, at the stick, at each other again, and then Sherlock just loses the plot.  He laughs so hard he slides off the sofa and onto the floor, where he lies on his back and continues laughing, a completely uncontrollable avalanche of glee sends his diaphragm into spasms and he can’t stop.  It’s all very funny, thinks John.  Sherlock is funny.  Their lives are funny.  Hil-fucking-arious.  John slides off the couch, too, and they try to catch their breaths.
It was only later that night, as he rubbed his feet together under the duvet that John wished Sherlock would be the braver of them, the one who
“Oh, I know that, it’s just...if you wanted to…”  She takes a breath, frustrated.  Tries again.  “In that video...she tells you it’s OK.  To move on.”
John looked to where Sherlock was frowning away at whatever it is he got all over his hands.  “How much did you lose?” he asked the manager.
“It’s not like you’ve never, Sherlock Holmes,” said Lestrade, who was taking the opportunity in a break in traffic to change lanes.
There are things I don’t tell John.  Things that John would say, “bit not good, Sherlock.”  Things that he doesn’t really want to know.  Not really.  I’ve made a promise not to lie to him, not like I had to before, but sometimes I lie by omission.  It’s better that way.
“Right then,” said John  as they pulled up to the grand reception entrance.  “For once, then, do as I say and try not to get us kicked out.”  He wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the situation.  “You know, Sherlock,” he said, popping his back as the driver gathered their bags, “I
Mycroft nodded.  “My brother’s brain is his sword and shield.  When in battle, everything else defers.  Becomes negligible.  Collateral damage.”
Sherlock shook his head in the negative.  He crossed over to the desk on which he was keeping his papers and ran his fingers over the cover of Maggie Donovan’s
“The Dr. Marten steel-toed work boot,” said Sherlock, looking smug.  “Created by Dr. Klaus Maerten and originally intended as orthopaedic shoes.  Production began in 1960 at Grigg’s factory in Wollaston and used primarily for industrial wear.  Made fashionable by The Who and Elton John.  Frequently worn by punks from 1977 and adopted by the American grunge culture of the 1990s.  Declining sales led to Chinese production in the early 2000s, although they are now currently being manufactured again at the Cobbs Lane Factory.”
“You’re a nutter, you know that?  And your brother can’t possibly be that bad,” said John, still laughing.
John hurried to help him with a cardboard box full of old textbooks, which he set on the front counter.  Mr. Chapman climbed onto his stool and began to lift out the volumes with his large, gnarled hands.  “All of these are outdated,” he said.  “I love to go back and read them, especially the old history books.  It makes me feel old,” he wheeze-laughed.  “Makes me wonder what they’ll think up when I’m gone.”
“I am not restringing that damn rod.”  Off went his trousers.  “This bloody water had better not be too cold.”
He immediately looked to his left, where a sex-dishevelled consulting detective was gingerly holding what remained of Mrs. Hudson’s vintage chinchilla-fur muff.
John excused himself from Greg’s after a chummy afternoon of beer and football, suddenly feeling the need to go home.  He hadn’t received any summoning texts from Sherlock, which was unusual.  Feeling happy, full, and a little bit drunk from the last can of lager he really should have declined, John took the tube home.  He reviewed their latest case in his mind, trying to think of salient points for his blog.  He finally clarified a title in the time he walked from the station to 221B, and he was certainly not thinking about sex, which is why, when he opened the door to the sitting room, he couldn’t help but gape, mouth open, at the scene in front of him.
Sherlock let out a low moan before completely giving in to his body’s baser instincts.  The next thing he knew, John was trying not to get pushed into the headboard.  Sherlock was making a holy racket above him, grunting like some kind of beast.  Good God, it was sexy.  John let his eyes roll back into his head at the intensity.  Between a stimulated prostate, the friction of the sheets against his cock, and the heavy, solid, muscular form of Sherlock sweating against his back, he did his best to hang on.  It might not have been more than minute of frantic, forceful coupling before Sherlock lost it, groaning “Oh
