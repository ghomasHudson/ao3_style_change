Sam eyed the items now scattered on Dean’s bed. “Birthday candles, wine, bone, and zebra cakes? Sounds like a party.”
A few minutes passed, and the snow began to pick up. Dean couldn’t help but notice the way they gathered on Cas’s eyelashes, making him seem… well, angelic. He didn’t quite know how the angel’s “thermoregulation” worked, but the snowflakes stayed longer on his skin than on a normal human’s. He could see the unique patterns of each individual flake, preserved like a fossil.
Dean felt angry, somehow. The proposal wasn’t unreasonable, but it wasn’t what he wanted to hear. “He asked me to do it. I’m not gonna let him down.”
“In a way, yes. And it likely will make it less funny for you.”
Castiel, who ended up totally nude in the wine-soaked mud, was in some kind of shock. Probably from being dragged, or more like slammed, out of hell. He looked a little singed from hell’s flames, but overall he was fine.
Dean realized he couldn’t keep standing there, lamenting to himself in a dingy motel room, so he left Sam on the phone and walked out. As much as he wanted to go for a drive, the car was too damaged to drive anywhere without getting pulled over. Instead he began to walk, heading nowhere in particular. They were in a small town, one he wasn’t all that familiar with, but he’d be able to find his way back.
“In fewer and simpler words, yes.” He would’ve laughed if he weren’t feeling so nervous all of a sudden. “Is, ah, is it working?”
Castiel’s bare flesh was soft, with a touch of hair, and no defined musculature. Dean found himself liking it, liking that Cas was still so normal despite being an all-powerful being from the dawn of time. He kissed down the angel’s neck, surprised at the way Cas squirmed under his touch. It was as if Cas was being overwhelmed by emotion, by sensations he was feeling for the very first time.
“Thank you. For that, and for bringing me back. Frankly, I didn’t know if you would, so it’s reassuring that my fears were unfounded.”
Dean was surprised by the sudden knowledge that had been planted in his head. It was a kind of ritual summoning, to drag someone out of hell. It would be difficult, and deadly if done wrong. “I don’t think I can do this without your help!”
“I know how to get him out. He sent me a vision.”
“You are, Dean. You are so worth defending.”
Castiel had other plans. When Dean had slowed down a bit, his arm getting tired, Cas gripped him by the shoulders and rolled them over so that Cas was now on top, his knee between Dean’s legs.
He was so out of it, he didn’t even realize the cashier was done scanning his items. “You good, man?”
“And you felt guilty, so you felt like you had to.”
“Then just pretend, because I do.” Cas was predictably still, like a plank of wood, Dean moved to hug Cas’s torso and nestle his nose into the crook of Cas’s neck. Though his eyes were closed, Dean could tell Cas was watching him.
“No, I wanted to. He’s your friend too, Sam.”
The angel looked wrong without it, especially in the cold, but he didn’t seem at all fazed. “You seemed cold.”
Taking Cas by the tie again, he gently pushed him onto the bed. Had it been a normal night, both parties would have been completely nude by now, but this was special circumstances. He was going slow for Cas, in the event he might come to realize that this is a bad idea. As he moved to straddle Castiel, Dean added, “Make sure you tell me if you wanna stop, alright? You gotta use your words. This is supposed to be fun, and if you aren’t having fun, I’m not gonna be having fun.”
Quiet, nearly drowned out by the sound of their bodies moving in unison, Cas muttered, “Dean… Dean…”
That was concerning. Was the angel gonna kill him for his sins or something? “What is it, Cas?”
He stopped, as he realised Sam was still on the phone.
Finally, Cas stopped looking at Dean and turned his attention to the falling snow. “Maybe I just wanted to see how you were doing. It is the apocalypse, after all.”
“I could drink you out of house and home. Though if you want my opinion, I think you drink too much.”
“It’s a long story.” Dean sat down in the motel’s desk chair, not looking at Sam. “I… I had my eyes opened, I’ll say that.”
Clearly wanting to be a more active participant, Cas worked a hand up to the base of Dean’s head and pulled him in to kiss him again, rough and sloppily. Things were starting to approach Dean’s comfort zone, of a fast fuck with no consequences. The problem was, he was getting into it now. He wanted to drag it out. Wanted to savor it, if this night with Cas was the last sex he ever had.
Cas had been staring at Dean intently for quite some time now. It wasn’t unusual, just one of Cas’s little quirks, but there was more concern in his eyes now. As if he were afraid Dean was going to spontaneously combust. “I believe there are places indoors to hide from your problems.”
“Well, I’m not burning in the fires of Hell anymore, so that’s an improvement.”
The cashier looked at him with hate in his eyes. “No offense dude, but I am not paid enough to give relationship advice.”
“Like 16 hours.”
“Aren’t we… supposed to be naked for this part?” Cas asked, his voice breathy.
A few thrusts later and Castiel came, his soft hands leaving bruises on Dean’s thighs. Not that Dean was complaining. It was certainly the weirdest situation in which he had ever had sex, but it did not disappoint. He’d have this over an emotionless motel fuck any day.
“I love you.”
“No. Though, Dean, I must warn you, this is entirely new territory for me. I can’t guarantee I’ll be a good partner, especially not right away.”
“Also, why does he need your help? He’s an angel, can’t he find his own way out?”
Tensions were higher than ever, what with that whole upcoming apocalypse thing. Dean felt like he couldn’t be inside around Sam and Bobby, not when he knew what he had put them through. And it was his fault, his own fault the whole damned thing started. It took all of his effort to look Sam in the eye on a good day, and today was not a good day. Dean felt like shit, and all he wanted was to be alone.
Dean smiled against Castiel’s skin. The idea scared and thrilled him all the same. “Love you too, Angel.”
“I tried to tell you, you just refused to help me. And it’s not like I haven’t done more dangerous things before.”
Once his baby’s windows were clear, he reached into the trunk and pulled out a beer, pleasantly chilled by the South Dakota winter. Popping it open, he took a sip and sighed. The wind was so strong that he almost didn’t hear the woosh of air signaling the arrival of a certain angel.
Dean had realized, after all that, it couldn’t just be friendship he held towards this man. It was clearly muddled and suppressed from years of being on his own, but it was affection nonetheless. He put a hand on Cas’s arm, testing the waters. “Actually I…”
“Fuck, Cas.” Dean moaned, realizing suddenly that there was nothing he wanted more right then and there than for the angel to be in control. Secretly, he liked it better being on the bottom. It was less work for the same pleasure. And god, if he wasn’t feeling pleasure now.
When Dean got out of the shower, Sam had left. Off to get a beer, according to Cas. Dean knew he was probably just leaving to get out of the situation. Cas sat at the desk, his hand tapping the wood. Dean couldn’t remember a time he had seen him this nervous before.
Fortunately, saving Sam from further embarrassment, Castiel exited the bathroom, steam pouring out the door. Dean was struck by how domestic he looked, the dark jeans low on his hips and his hair wet and tousled.
Dean stood, letting out a breath. He approached Cas, leaning on the desk, hoping the wood wouldn’t collapse under his weight. “I know. And I… I’ve spent a lot of time in my life repressing my emotions, out of fear. As if they’d compromise me, somehow. But I’m tired of that. I’m tired of a lot, now that I think about it. To be honest, I never expected to live this long. And I definitely never expected to meet someone like you.” With the care that one would treat a small bird, Dean reached out and caressed Cas’s cheek. “I love you too, Cas. I think I always have. But I was so self-absorbed, so obsessed with the idea that this hunting lifestyle would kill me that I couldn’t see the good thing right in front of me.”
He didn’t expect him to say, “No, you’re not.”
“How’re you feeling?” Dean muttered, as he put his muddy clothes into a bag. He’d have to wash them later.
That word scared him. Partner. Dean wasn’t the partner kind of guy. Or, he hadn’t been one in the past. The apocalypse had forced him to slow down and focus on what was important, so his trend of one-night stands had vanished nearly overnight. Coincidentally, this started right when a certain angel pulled him out of hell and strolled into his life, so perhaps it wasn’t only because of the apocalypse. “I don’t care. Just be yourself, that’s all I want.”
Sam shook his head. “It’s more than that, though. It was impulsive. You’ve been like that since Cas went to Hell. And you never told me what happened there.”
Finally, he spotted him. Ragged, ghostly, and scarred, but the angel he knew nonetheless. He flew towards him, slamming into him at full speed.
Out of the screams, he heard a whisper. “Dean!”
Even though angels weren’t supposed to have emotions, Castiel was certainly feeling them, looking bashful. “It might be.”
“Hello, Dean.”
With that, Dean took Castiel’s face into his hands and kissed him. He started off slow, not knowing the pace the angel would be comfortable with, but as Cas began to understand it better, he moved in with more ferocity. Cas was clearly eager, and Dean took that as a queue to do more.
“They put me on hold.” Sam had the phone sitting on his chest on speaker, the tinny hold music playing out loud. “What the hell were you trying to say earlier?”
“How long have you been on the phone, anyhow?” Dean asked.
Dean shook himself out of his stupor. “Yeah, yeah. Say, how do you figure out if you’re in love with your best friend?”
“Oh, good. So I don’t seem like a total douche.”
“It would appear that I am. I… that worked better than I had hoped it would.”
“Yeah, yeah.” Sam tapped his phone, hanging up the call. “I wish you’d have told me you were doing that. It’s not safe to do something like that alone. What if you’d gotten yourself trapped in Hell again?”
“That’s ok. Not like we have anywhere to be.” Dean remembered the last thing he had brought to the ritual. The one that wasn’t important, but could prove useful. “Think you can get yourself out of this hole, or do you need my help?”
“If you’re truly this cold, we can go inside.” Castiel said.
Castiel’s expression had remained serious from the moment they had stepped into the club to the moment they got home. Occasionally there would be a flash of emotion, but Dean hadn’t seen one since they had left. Which was why Cas’s next statement surprised him so much.
“I can try, I can’t guarantee how good I’ll be.”
“Right. Fairness.” Cas moved to stand, but nearly toppled over. Dean quickly moved to catch him, steadying him with his arms. “This vessel is still a little woozy from the journey, I’m afraid.”
“Cass. Want a beer?”
Whether it took Castiel that long to notice or it had finally gotten weird Dean didn’t know, but Cas finally spoke, “Is there something on my face?”
Dean turned himself over, propping himself up on his knees. Though he couldn’t really see Castiel from there, he could picture the angel lubing himself up.
“What in the fresh hell?” Sam muttered, taking it all in.
Cas nodded. “I’ll be going, then.”
“Yeah, but I’m not the one who had to turn him down.”
“I’m sorry. I wish I could do more.”
The thin layer of snow crunched under Dean’s shoes as he made his way out towards the car. It was late, but he needed to clear his head.
Instantly Dean knew who it was. “Cas?”
Cas, clearly not expecting this burst of emotion, patted Dean on the shoulder. “I hate to say it, but probably still in hell.”
“No, no. Well, there’s snow, but I was just watching it. It’s kinda pretty when you look at it up close.”
Dean’s heart stopped. “Wait, what? Aren’t angels not supposed to feel emotions?”
“I can do that. On one condition.”
Dean wasn’t a man to express his emotions well. He much preferred them bottled up, a tight cap keeping them hidden locked in a safe under the rug. So, when it came time to address those emotions, he struggled. How did he even feel towards Cas? He loved him as a friend, surely, and as his savior. One couldn’t help but love the person who literally dragged you out of Hell.
‘How much longer?’ He mouthed, motioning to his watch.
He started to clear the snow off of his car’s hood, his hands quickly burning from the cold. He knew he probably should’ve gotten gloves, but he no longer cared. It was something to do. And it was productive, which was more than he could say for anything else he had done today.
Castiel eyed Dean’s hands on his tie, and examined Dean’s face. “I’m willing.”
“What, did you do that on purpose or something? Doesn’t make it any less funny.”
“Many people find talking to their guardian Angel to be a helpful release of stress. Of course, their guardian Angel rarely talks back, but people don’t seem to care.” It was at that moment that Dean realized the beer had somehow made its way into Castiel’s hands and quickly disappeared. “And if I didn’t want to hear, I would have left by now.”
was simply too much for his poor libido to take. If there was a later, they’d definitely have to approach that.
The rest of the night passed without event. Sam didn’t return, apparently opting to get a second room, which Dean didn’t complain about. And when Dean awoke, he found the angel he loved in his arms, and for the first time in a while, felt truly and utterly happy.
“Worth it? Why wouldn’t it be worth it?”
“I could never hate you. Not when you’ve done so much for me and Sam.”
Castiel looked frozen in time, as if he didn’t ever think he’d get this far. Dean stroked a hand up and down his arm.
Dean realized he was still laying on top of the poor man, so he rolled off of him, landing in the mud. “Still got all your fingers and toes?”
“That’s good.” Plugging his phone in, Dean sat down on one of the dingy motel beds. “You know, I never got to thank you. For sacrificing yourself to save me, to save all of us. It was brave of you.”
When they got back to the house, Dean was still laughing. It reminded him of the kind of juvenile fun he and Sam used to have as teenagers, prank calling sex shops and bars and seeing what they could get away with. Sure, it was dumb, but that was kind of the point.
Now Dean really was crying. It was such a show of tenderness, like he hadn’t experienced in years, and it made his pent-up emotions boil over. “I don’t know where I’d be without you.”
“I can thermoregulate better than the average human. Though you should probably go inside before this snow gets any worse.”
“Can you sort of…” Cas tapped the sides of Dean’s legs, prompting him to close them. It felt awkward, but any concerns about hip discomfort left his mind when Cas said, “Just like that.” And slammed his cock in-between Dean’s legs.
Right, that. Dean didn’t have a spare pair of pants, but he was wearing a jacket, so he gave it to Cas. When the angel tried to refuse, Dean made an effort to put the jacket around his shoulders. “Take it, Cas. It’s cold out.”
“You’re so good, Dean,” Cas muttered, and Dean nearly came again on the spot. That was… new. But he had always rather been one for praise, and the fact that the person praising him while also slamming a cock in-between his legs was an
Dean took that to mean no, and so he climbed out of the hole himself. He held out a hand to Cas, and he took it. Dean pulled him up from the grave-like hole, helping him sit down on the grass. He grabbed the box of zebra cakes and offered Cas a pack.
Dean smiled slightly. “That’s not why I’m doing it.”
“Duly noted. But at the end of the day, I’m gonna keep doing it.”
“Listen, I know absolutely nothing about this town. It seemed the safest place to do it.” Dean stood, offering a hand to help Cas get up. “Think you can run?”
-----------
“Go for it.”
“Appreciate the concern, but I’m not gonna catch it that quick.” Staring at the cloud-covered sky, Dean felt small. His life was just a pinprick in all of human existence, and he had spent most of it messing things up.
“Hey, don’t apologize. Everyone’s different.”
“Dig a hole, put the candles around it, put a paper with a sigil drawn on it in the center, throw the bones and wine in, light the candles, and do a couple chants. If I do it right, it’ll send my consciousness into Hell so I can find him and pull him out.”
Applying some lube to his hand that had definitely been there when this started, Dean stroked Cas’s cock, slowly at first but picking up speed when he heard the sounds he was making. Cas seemed to be letting loose, a string of moans and expletives pouring from his lips. He didn’t exactly know how long it’d take an Angel to climax, but the sounds alone made him willing to wait.
How was Cas always able to read him like that? Was it an angel thing, or was he just that good at getting through Dean’s shell?
—————
“Who, Castiel? How’d he manage to do that?”
“But you don’t reciprocate.”
“Cas?” He called out, his voice distorted. “Cas!”
No reply. He decided to float higher, going above the flames. “Cas! Where are you? Yell or something!”
He would need candles, and lots of them. A shovel. Some wine, type up to him. Some kind of bone. Paper, or something to draw a sort of sigil on. Most of which could be picked up at the nearby Wal-Mart.
“Well, I’m not most people.” Dean hoped the inflection in his voice would show that he was joking.
Dean is pacing. It’s all he can think to do. Pace, and worry. Sam, who’s currently on the phone with the insurance company, is giving him a dirty look.
Castiel gave him that stare, the one that he knew only ever happened because Cas didn’t know it made people uncomfortable. “There was a suspicion I’ve had about myself, and it was only cemented by our visit to that house of ill repute. And I knew, as soon as I stepped into that room with poor Chastity, that I wouldn’t enjoy my time there.”
It was, quite possibly, the weirdest way someone had ever come out and confessed their attraction to Dean. And Dean couldn’t say he didn’t find the angel attractive. He just tended to assume that everyone he met was heterosexual. “Well, that’s a lot to take in.”
Even if he did yell, the sounds of the damned would drown it out. He’d have to find Cas on his own, somehow. The problem was, he only had until the candles melted to find him. If he failed, his consciousness would be barred from entering Hell again until he died.
“Exactly. And it’s starting to feel like hell in there right now.”
“No idea. But he showed me how to do a certain ritual to get him out, so I went and got the supplies.”
“Dean, what did I-”
That pulled a real laugh from Dean. It wasn’t often that Cas said something so clearly human. “Yeah, yeah you’re right. But I like the cold. Makes me feel more alive.”
“I didn’t know if you would want to pull me back from hell after my revelation to you. It was my greatest fear that I had ruined a most beautiful friendship, and I hope you can forgive me for picking such an inopportune time to make such a confession. But there was naught else I could think to do, and saving your life was more important to me than anything.” Cas was beginning to cry. It hurt Dean to see him so distraught about this. “I could have come back on my own in time, but this way I could come back faster, and prove to myself you don’t hate me.”
Dean waved a hand in a “never mind” fashion, and left again. He could at the very least get started on the ritual to get Cas back by collecting the necessary materials.
“He’s in love with you, isn’t he.” It wasn’t a question. It was a statement. “I’ve seen the way he looks at you.”
“Yeah, I knew you liked em, and you’d probably want something normal after you got out of hell.” Dean opened himself up a packet, eating one of the small cakes. He was starving from digging all night. “Say, these aren’t bad.”
“We’re getting there. I’m just trying to keep it slow, make sure you’re comfortable.” Dean nearly jumped as he suddenly found his clothes magically removed and carefully folded on top of the dresser. It was a little chilly, since of course the heating didn’t work, but that was motivating enough to get things moving faster. “I’ll get to it then.”
---------
“Good enough.”
“I told you it would work. I am at least a little competent.” Dean went to his suitcase and found the only clean pair of jeans he had, handing them to Cas. “Go get yourself cleaned up. Bathroom’s just over there.”
His items now in hand, he returned to the motel room, to find Sam still on the phone.
“You do. It’s not like any angel I’ve met, and not even like any human I’ve met. It’s like… like you’re trying not to see beauty in the world, because you know there’s a chance it’s going to end soon. Like you’re afraid it’ll give you false hope.”
Cas must’ve worked some magic, because all of the bodily fluids were now gone from the bed. Leave it to an Angel for easy cleanup. “You kept your promise, then. I will not die a virgin.”
Dean frowned. “I never turned him down.”
“No I’m not.”
Dean really, really didn’t want to go over it right now. The problem was, Castiel had a face that was just too easy to talk to. He had told Cas more about himself in the last few months than he told most people in years. But Cas was different from most people. Not just that he was an Angel, but he had a willingness to listen, to shoulder the problems of others in his own unique way. Course not all of his problem-solving methods were perfect, but he tried. “It’s nothing. Just thinking too much.”
When Cas took both their cocks into his hand at once, Dean practically yowled. Cas applied a little more pressure than he normally would’ve to himself, and the sensation of an unfamiliar hand only added to it. But there was something about Cas’s grip, some sort of underlying power to it that almost made Dean blow his load right then and there.
“Checking up on you is a reason. Though, is it so hard to believe I simply wished to visit a friend?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “You never visit without a reason.”
“What do you have to do?”
As Dean was about to speak, the sound of a car door closing nearby alerted him to the fact a police officer had just arrived at the park. That wasn’t a good sign. There was still a six foot deep hole in the ground, and Cas still wasn’t wearing any pants.
“You know I would never just leave you to burn in hell. You did it for me, it’s only fair that I do the same for you.”
Dean flew to where the whisper had come from. It was so quiet, he couldn’t quite pinpoint it, but at least he had the right area. “Cas! I’m here!”
“It’s like… it’s like we keep going in circles. Sam and Lucifer, me and Michael, the Horsemen. It’s not even an argument anymore, we just say the same shit over and over again hoping it’ll somehow be different. And it never is.” Dean ran a hand along his face, swallowing the anxiety building in his throat with a swig of beer. “I’m just tired of it all, Cas.”
Dean felt warm enough to melt the snow around them, and realized he was blushing terribly. He didn’t know how to respond to the flood of emotions he was feeling now that the levee had broken. Even though the angel wasn’t particularly a hugger, Dean still threw an arm around his shoulder, pulling him close. Castiel was cold, as Dean had expected, but warmed in his proximity. It had been a long time since Dean had been this close to another person. He missed it. Missed the feeling of a warm, radiant person beside him. And there was no one more radiant than Cas.
A pause. The angel was probably weighing the effects of the alcohol on his soul, or something like that. “I shouldn’t.”
Cas put a hand over Dean’s, leaning into the touch. His expression was that of relief, like an exhale after holding your breath. “That’s alright. So long as we got here in the end, that’s what matters.”
“I… Oh.” The angel’s eyes widened. “So, unless this is some human tradition I am severely misunderstanding, you are attempting to ‘come on to’ me.”
“Dean!” Another whisper, fainter this time. All the screams were becoming faint, signaling that his time was almost up.
“Maybe try calling back in the morning. It seems like they’ve forgotten about you.”
“Then we’re all screwed.”
“You have?”
“I assure you, this is as close to fun as I’ve ever had. Please, continue.”
“One of my little human pleasures.” Cas eyed the cakes pensively. “Dean, there’s something I have to say.”
“What? Since when?”
Dean didn’t meet his eyes. “I’m gonna get cleaned up.”
And Cas, well, Cas wasn’t even human. He was an angel. One who wasn’t always good at his job, but an angel nonetheless, which meant he would live on for eternity while Dean would grow old. The prospect was a depressing one.
That was it. Dean didn’t need Sam’s help to fix this. “I told you, he asked for my help. And he pulled me out of Hell once, it’s only right if I do the same for him.” He gathered up his supplies and once again made for the door. “Have fun being on hold.”
Dean pictured Cas bending him over, fucking him in the ass over the hood of his car. And, as incredible as that fantasy was, anal was something he needed to be prepared for. That didn’t mean he didn’t have other options, though. “Would my thighs work?”
Dean kissed him again, this time grinding their hips together in a way that showed Dean exactly how much fun Cas was having. A lot, apparently. Upon separating, he undid Castiel’s tie, tossing it to the floor. When Cas didn’t protest, he began to unbutton Castiel’s heavily worn white shirt. To his own surprise, his hands were shaking. The pressure was on, after all, to make it a night to remember. Not that his feelings were deeper than he thought, that couldn’t be it.
When Cas pulled himself out, Dean collapsed onto his side, breathing heavily. “Hot damn.”
The sun was setting, and the night air was cool. Dean found his way to a park they had passed by on the way to the motel, hopping the gate to enter.
“I do. Or at least, I think I do.”
The candles didn’t need to be a specific size, so he got three packs of birthday candles. The shovel he already had. For the wine, he settled on one cheap enough he wouldn’t mind wasting it, but not too cheap that he wouldn’t want to drink what was left over. They sold bone for stocks, and he grabbed a notebook for paper. He also grabbed a box of zebra cakes, since Hell-raising was hungry stuff. Plus, Cas might want something to eat after he’s dragged out of hell. Not that he needs to eat, but Dean knew the angel had his temptations.
"Stelly got a puppy?" Dean asked, surprised, and jealous.
“This new doc what's he doing different?” Benny asked as he placed Dean's order with the kitchen.
“There's my brother,” Cas said, pointing to a short sandy-haired man.
Cas beat him to the fridge pulling out the juice and grabbing a cup from the cabinet. Dean sat back in his seat at the table. This wasn't
Cas nodded and sat down at the table they had to go to work the following day they would take their babies and figure everything else out, Cas called their dad to see if the family doctor would come to the house to check on twins.
“I knew it was you a month ago,” Dean replied, running his hand up Cas’s shirt and enjoying the hard muscles underneath.
He headed into the kitchen, trying to ignore the fact that there was an enormous box, which was hard to comprehend. Since the thing was delivered at six in the morning, he did want to know what was inside. He put the coffee pot on the brew and headed back over to the box, walking around it he noticed a latch with a combo lock on it. He furrowed his brow at the item before picking up the envelope that the delivery man handed him before he left. Dean opened it to find a letter with three numbers at the top of the page and nothing else.
”It's ok. Next time tells Miss. Becky ok, and she can come help, ” Cas said, leading Dean into the elevator, Jimmy and Stella right behind them.
Dean went around introducing Cas to the rest of the people, a bouncy red-head who was making her way back outside with their younger brother Sam. They were talking about something going on with a computer. They waved hello when Dean introduced Cas.
“That's ok, maybe not today. I just wanted to introduce myself to you, and maybe one day this conversation won't be one-sided,” Cas said, pointing at Ivy.
“Oh, a journal in case she wanted to write and a few pens. They are felt just in case,” Dean said as Cas unlocked the door to Ivy’s room.
“I'm sure Dom will love it,” Gabe snapped as he came around from the back of the mirrors in his everyday close, leaving the room.
Gabriel was a bit taken back by his brother's response; usually, he nods and laughs it off. Cas wasn't going to take their shit tonight. Getting more annoyed, he had to cancel on Dean.
read with caution they read a except from Ivys journal
Dean couldn't help but watch the way Castiel's muscles ripple as he walked away. That perfectly round plump ass that Dean wanted to squeeze and smack it. He let his imagination run wild, wondering if the bot’s cheeks would turn red while waiting for Cas to come back. Dean was hard as a rock even though he knew the bot would pick up on it. He tried and failed to think of something, anything else.
Elle came in and smiled, shaking her head. Stella waved her over signing.
“Where’s Ivy?’ Cas asked the dark haired girl sitting at the desk. He hadn't meet her yet.
The Omega turned his ass to the camera, rubbing and giving it a slight slap making it jiggle a bit. It made the Alpha groan low in his throat. He wanted to be the one making that perfect ass red.
“Cassie,” his brother yelled, spotting the youngest Novak.
"No, come on, let change you," Elle said, holding out her hand.
“Master, should we go to the bedroom?” Castiel inquired.
“Like you, friend.” ivy said with a slight nod.
Dean finally worked up the nerve to tell Ivy that he had moved in with Cas. Ivy was worried about where she would sleep and where Jimmy would sleep; he was supposed to come home for the weekend.
He waited in line while looking over the menu, deciding which drink he wanted this morning when his phone dinged. Checking the screen, it was from an unknown number. Cas shook his head, ignoring it while shoving the device back into his pocket and stepping up to the counter. He smiled at the pretty girl behind the counter before placing his order for a tropical blend of nectar along with a tuna bagel. Stepping to the side to wait for his order, his phone went off one more time. He sighed in annoyance after spotting his brother's name. At least this was the brother he liked.
Dean popped off, continuing to pump Cas with both hands, “fuck my mouth,” he said, wrapping his lips back around the tip.
“Especially if you are boring,” Dean replied, taking his free hand and moving Cas’ arm from over his face.
"What did you do?" Elle asked, setting Stella breakfast in front of her.
”Too many words, keep it simple, ” Cas said, laughing as he pulled a t-shirt over Deans' head.
Dean nodded as he leads Cas out of the library, saying they could come back tomorrow that they needed to head to their room and start getting ready. Their guest should be arriving soon. Cas was nervous yet again as they headed to their room. He was worried he was going to mess everything up and be kicked out for offending someone. Dean told him to stop worrying. No one was going to kick him out. Besides, it was hard to get banished from the realm for small things. Now, if he killed another fairy or kidnapped one something along those lines, then yeah, he would be banished.
I'm still watching you!
Dean choked on his beer at Cas’ admission, “Wait, do they not know if it was you or not?” he questioned between coughs.
The children were kept at the Orphanage until they either found a family to take them in and teach them how to hide what they were from the rest of the world, or they came of age and learned to do it on their own.
“You said my name, you haven't...” he cut himself off feeling the tears well up in his eyes at how proud he was in that moment.
Cas carried Stella to the car when she fell asleep; Jimmy walked with Dean, who was happy holding anyone's hand.
They both nodded and knelt before their Omegas, they told them they would be right upstairs, and if anything happened, Becky would call them, they would come to eat lunch with them later. Dean nodded and hugged Cas Stella mirrored what Dean did Jimmy was sure she didn’t fully understand, but she didn't like the way it was making her feel tears filled her eyes as Jimmy squeezed her tight. Jimmy told her not to cry. He would be back for her at lunch. Stella sniffed and nodded, understanding that he might come back. Once they had said their goodbyes, Jimmy told Becky about Stellas rash, and the cream was in the bag.
“Your first patient is Marv, he is,” Meg started to say, but Cas cut her off.
Ivy was having a nightmare. Jimmy whispered in her ear that she was safe that it wasn't real. She needed to wake up. He was there. He would keep her safe. Jimmy squeezed Ivy tightly to him. A single tear fell from her eyes. He wiped it away with his thumb. Jimmy wanted to know what she was dreaming about, don't take who? He would ask when she woke up. She rolled over and snuggled into his chest, rubbing her face against him. He sighed. He was so hard and uncomfortable, but Jimmy knew Ivy would wake up if he tried to leave. Jimmy turned to see who was coming in when he heard the door handle turn.
“Of course,” Cas said standing from his seat and leading Dean out of the room. They headed to the dining hall Ivy wasn't there and she wasn't in the TV room,they went to the nurses station too see if they knew where she was.
“I take it you are talking about Ivy and Jimmy?” Cas rubbed his face. Ash’s complaint since Jimmy showed up at the center.
“You got a better idea?” Dean asked
Stella touched the dresses with a tentative hand, not sure if it was ok. She looked at Jimmy, who nodded. Stella smiled and grabbed a fist full of the materiel rubbing it against her face it was ruffled tulle, and she moved to the next on doing the same thing until she found a soft cotton dress with pink and purple stars on it she pointed and then pointed to herself.
“Ivy, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to break your stuff,” Ash said hoping she would forgive him. Ivy just glared at him as Cas and Dean sat at the table.
"I can't believe they kept that she couldn't hear to themselves," Jimmy said, leaning the door frame again.
"She is a hearing dog for Stella," Jimmy said, sighing as Stella picked up the puppy, wagging her finger at it, babbling.
Cas shook his head and went back to reading his book, ignoring Dean's attempts to flirt with him. Dean leaned over and rested his head on Cas’s shoulder and sighed, “What are you reading?” he asked, trying to take the book out of Cas’s hand, “I'm bored.”
After hitting send Cas sat back and smirked, he knew his knot was big, and hopefully, he would get a response. He slipped his hand under his boxers to gently rub himself, thinking of how lonely he was and how he should go out and get laid, but what was sex without meaning? So here he was, spending money to get off watching an Omega fucking himself on a fake knot. The bell chimed, letting him know he got an email a few moments later.
Cas turned and looked to see who he was supposed to be marrying, taken aback at the sight of the man glaring at him. The guy was handsome. To say the least. He seemed uptight, sitting there in his pressed dress shirt and slacks. He nodded his head slowly in greeting, looking Cas up and down with judgment clear in his expression. A little giggle pulled Cas’s attention away from Dean and towards the sound. He found a small girl sitting next to his brother, covering her mouth to smother the laughter, her eyes bright bottle green, and her hair a dark brown. She must be Dean's sister, with her similar facial structure and eye color; she was the one who is supposed to marry Jimmy.
Meanwhile, Sam is thinking back too-- remembering everything that went down with Michael and Lucifer.
ROWENA
ON JACK’S BODY, lying in an infirmary bed.
Find an exit. Get as many others out as you can, but--
The woman frowns, and crosses the road to join them. Pushes others aside to get a better view.
--the war room, to find Castiel standing in the center of the room, Jack beside him. Dean skids to a halt about two feet away from Castiel.

The Woman in White. That’s right.

YOUNGER CASTIEL
Castiel frowns, genuinely perplexed. Slight head tilt. Still the same Castiel Dean knows... and loves.
MICHAEL
The taste of burgers. The feeling of a warm bed after a long day.
No. Is it like this?
Amara smiles. She knows the truth of Dean Winchester’s heart.
I mean-- maybe Dean and Cas sacrifice themselves too much and too often. I think both of them see themselves as a weapon, a tool--
(scandalized)
About Lucifer? Or Jack?
SAM (CONT’D)
ON SAM, bursts into delighted laughter.
MATCH CUT TO:
I’ll make sure to keep Castiel.
Dean, Jack didn’t do this.
Dad did what he had to.

BECKY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
As I’ve explained, dear, it’s a delicate situation. Even if I were a conduit powerful enough to control the current... Jack doesn’t have the voltage, so to speak.

Thankfully, Eileen returns and they’re distracted--
No, more like... spending time with the people you care about.

END OF ACT TWO
TO BE CONTINUED...
(relieved)
Goodnight, Claire.
A beat, as we cut to Jack and Castiel looking taken aback. Then Dean steps forward and--
Yeah? What makes you so sure?
In the background, shafts of light begin shining on the car-- Castiel winces, and we shift to--
A slow pan across a creepy looking warehouse. Through the windows, we see the flickering light of a large FIRE.
ROWENA
She extends her arm out and--
And to answer your question; no. I’m not going to give you what you need.
Our Dean frowns at the younger version of himself. Then all at once, recognizes his surroundings.
It’s not-- dammit, Cas. We’re
WIDE SHOT from the side of the church as we see the EX-DEMON GANG and DARK-HAIRED WOMAN point guns towards each other--
The greatest wars of Heaven were fought in your name, Dean. Under my command, under Castiel’s... in a few short years, you nearly wiped out an entire species.
CHUCK
He raises his arm, and we see Chuck ENVELOPED WITH SHINING YELLOW LIGHT--
‘What happened?’ Cas asked extremely confused by what was going on.
“Why say Jimmy was trying to give them to you?’ Cas asked. He already wasn't the biggest fan of Ash, but this made Cas not like him even more.
He nodded while setting the empty beer bottle on the table, Castiel stood up, holding out a hand for Dean to take. He hesitated for a second before telling himself that if Castiel didn't want to do anything, he could simply say no, and Dean would leave him alone.
Wren huffed under her breath and followed suit, trying to ignore the strange feeling she was getting. As they headed into the building, they stopped just short of the entrance, their reflections showing their skeletal sides. Someone was close to Death. Luckily for them, the home they worked at was a nursing home for aging monsters. Someone passing within the building wasn’t exactly new to them.
Cas came back down with Dean reminding Jimmy to give Stella her medicine, Jimmy said he already did, and Stella was an excellent girl and didn't put up a fight.
“In my room with a note saying to ask Jimmy if he wants some,” Ash answered, pulling the note out of his pocket.
“Hello, I'm Henry; it's nice to meet you,” the king greeted, holding his hand out.
Cas looked at Dean, “Salem, just because you are bad at poker does not mean everyone is cheating.” Dean said, chuckling, “You remember Cas.”
CHUCK (CONT’D)
‘Shotgun shuts his cakehole’.
The truck door swings open. The woman smiles and pulls herself up to the passenger seat, swinging it shut behind her.
CASTIEL
So I will be too.
EXT. LEBANON MAIN STREET – DAY
(furious whisper)
Are you alright?
ANGLE ON SAM, peacefully asleep in the passenger seat. Using his jacket as a pillow.
ANGLE ON Sam, wincing at the sound. Grimacing.
(defensive)
Jack, standing in the corner with an armful of vegetables, finally BREATHES OUT. He walks over to the main counter and lets the vegetables fall on to it. Next to him, Michael examines the pile of vegetables. A strategist uncertain of which move to make next.
I’ll be warm enough. I like watching the sun rise.
Would you like me to comfort you? Hold your hand, tell you it will be alright?
It’s ok. I find crowds a little overwhelming too.
I really never thought we’d be here.
We might be able to rescue him. We might be able to stop my Father.

He gives Sam his most shit-eating grin. Sam rolls his eyes.

I’ll help, too.
JODY (CONT’D)
And any connections you can see between the vics or the scenes of the crimes?
ON CASTIEL, murderous-- and Dean, silently warning him not to react...
CASTIEL
ACT THREE
Chuck waggles his finger at her.
Ash regards him with a surprisingly analytical gaze.
“The cakes are mine. Everything else, though, that’s for the ritual.”
Dean wiped his eyes, trying to repair some of his dignity and make himself seem more stable. “You’re probably right about that one. You’ve saved me in a lot of ways, you know?”
“I dunno. Forever, I guess. How did you not know? I’ve had relationships with men while we’ve been hunting together.”
When Cas began to stroke, Dean was gone. He gripped Cas’s hips with enough pressure to bruise a normal human, and made sounds he didn’t even realize he could make. Cas’s lips came down to his mouth, his neck, his collarbone, wherever he could reach, each one pushing Dean closer and closer to the edge.
“And that’s where the alcohol comes in.”
Suddenly, Dean felt a pain in his head, and heard a long, high-pitched shriek. For a moment, he wondered if he were having an aneurysm, but realized behind the shrieks he could hear a voice calling out to him.
“Hmm. You have an interesting way of looking at the world.”
Well, it looked like Dean had been wrong on that second part. As hilarious as it had been, to see Castiel’s interactions with the aptly-named Chastity, it had resulted in them getting kicked out of the club and being asked not to come back. Despite Castiel’s apparent best efforts, Dean hadn’t missed the clear discomfort in the angel throughout the whole scenario. This was the first time Cas had ever been invited to partake in such earthly pleasures. Maybe women weren’t his thing. Next time… if there was a next time, he’d have to bring Cas somewhere a little more open-minded.
Meg nodded and left smiling saying Dean should be in soon and it was almost time for dinner. About twenty minutes later Dean came in with another man, tall burly guy, scruffy with blue eyes
“I'm gonna take off; if you want to talk or hang out, call me,” Gabriel said as he walked out the door, closing it behind him before Cas had a chance to answer.
you! If you two don’t start putting your back into it, I’ll make a shish kebab out of Sam too!
He turns on the engine. Music is playing on the radio, but it’s quiet enough to be indistinct other than the general tune.
Sam looks between them as they argue, and smiles. Everything is finally
--but the second he comes back it’s all bitch fights and surly attitudes! You know sometimes you remind me so much of Dad it scares me.
EXT. KELLY’S CABIN – NIGHT
Oh, Michael. You stupid, stupid boy.
So many people whose lives I couldn’t restore.
(talking quickly to cover up what nearly happened)
ELLEN
It’s harder, as a human. But I don’t think this is my Heaven.
JANICE
Oh yeah. ‘Prison Break’.
Dean stands up and rummages in the cabinets behind him before drawing out a BIG, FLUFFY QUILT. He drops it gently over Eileen and Sam from behind the couch, and then presses a hand on to Sam’s shoulder briefly.
Amara looks at the lake, and is thoughtful...
LISA (O.C.)
Once upon a time I was
ROWENA
I already looked through everything we have on the Empty. There’s nothing.
Oh, man. I nearly forgot about that reaper chick. I was about to ask if you’d ever slept with a woman, if you even knew what your type was but--
Dean JERKS UP away from the steering wheel.
YOUNGER CASTIEL
A volunteer hands him a CUP OF HOT TEA.
EILEEN
So, you think we can pull this off?
MUSIC (V.O.) (CONT’D)
(slightly mollified)
I think Michael was right. We’ve just gotta believe. And I believe in Dean, and Castiel.
Meanwhile Sam calculates whether he can make it to Dean’s side, whether it’s worth incurring Chuck’s displeasure--
DEAN (CONT’D)
Yes, he texted me...
Yeah, I guess personality-wise they’re definitely reversed--
A beat, as Sam looks away, embarrassed. Pondering how much truth to include in his reply.
I think I might have an idea.
DEAN (CONT’D)
He closes his eyes in prayer, grips his left shoulder--
I’m sorry I didn’t say anything before. I was bein’ a coward.
CLOSE ON a WITCH’S BOWL OF INGREDIENTS sitting on a table. Rowena’s hands are moving over the smoking concoction, adding flower petals and dropping in a lit match. Tilt up to reveal Sam, Rowena, Dean, Michael and Jack standing around it. A SALT CIRCLE surrounds the party. All except Michael and Dean look a little apprehensive.
AMARA
Holy crap. Did I dream that?
MICHAEL
CLOSE ON DEAN’S PHONE, still in Sam’s hand. The group photo of the Roadhouse Gang filling his screen.
That’s your side of the trade. We will take
He SNAPS his fingers, and the party--
Sam looks back towards the stovetop. His expression is distant. Beside him, Dean and Jack talk to each other-- oblivious to Sam’s internal struggle.
ROWENA
Sam casts Dean a glare.
CASTIEL
I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t--
I get that much. I guess life was never going to be fair, what with Vizzini running the place.
(having a chick flick moment)
Well, there’s time to fix that--
ROWENA
CASTIEL
Michael stares at the wall for a moment, as though making eye-contact with someone else in the room entirely.
What do you mean?

Dean turns towards Jack, while Sam goes back to typing something on his laptop.
Then quit complainin’.
That seems counterproductive if you intend to say no.

Jack. Bringing back all those angels and demons, it was enough to cause the whole world to change. If you’d started bringing back the dead too--
A crowded, narrow city street. The old cobblestones and architecture imply a European setting.

ON DEAN, looking at Sam. Allowing himself a totally open expression now that nobody can see him. Filled with love for his younger brother... but filled with melancholy, too. He knows that it’s the
I’m sorry. You don’t have to--
What makes you think people will accept us? We tell people who we are, what we are-- we’ll just be made outcasts. It’s fine for someone like
Claire? I want to get back before sunrise if possible--
(ever a brat)
Maybe you will. But you do that, and I’ll be waiting. You’re a human now, Alastair. You’re not special. You’re just a sick man with a prison sentence.
No, nothing. There are no guidelines for this. Even when I took on the souls of Purgatory-- I am not Jack, and even if I were, the forces of Heaven and Hell are in a different league of power entirely.
(acidic)
Yeah. Me too, pal.
She HEALS DEAN of his injuries (in a shot mirror of 5.22 SWAN SONG again-- ‘Cas, are you God?’). Dean looks away, shaken.
Sounds like Dean.
He stills. Hangs his head, fists tight and body tense as he confesses his real fear:
Jack catches Sam’s renewed look of alarm, and quickly works to reassure him.
On Michael, attempting to open the fridge-- only to have several things fall out on to him, which he barely manages to catch.

dangles from the rear-view mirror-- engraved with words from the Bible. “Faith is being sure of what we hope for”.
If this doesn’t work, I want you to know--

You know what, dude? I take it back. Best party ever. Misuse the carefully crafted emergency warning system all you like.
ACT FOUR
Mostly, yes. I took your suggestions to heart. Although I wasn’t sure how to incorporate the dispensaries.
To Team Free Will.
Well, admittedly, some of it is, but I put us in our current... situation. I don’t regret... doing what I had to at the time, but we’ve barely spoken since we-- “saved the world”, as you said.
Dean flips it open and hits receive. Holds the phone to his ear.
Shot of Dean FLICKERS-- PULL BACK to reveal the shot as VIDEO ON CHUCK’S TELEVISION SCREEN--
You did this?
But Dean says he needs to work on being grateful, rather than guilty.
Sam sits up, alert, and disrupts Eileen.
Well, Halo-Man, if you get drunk enough, I promise you’ll see the light. Metaphorically, of course.
Dean. I don’t want your money.
ROWENA
I was--
Meanwhile, Dean shows Sam something from the folder-- a photo taken at one of the crime scenes. A DEMONIC SIGIL carved into a wooden wall, covered in blood.
Samuel, let’s crack open some of these books, shall we?
Dean looks at him... and recognizes the Castiel from his time. He laughs. Overwhelmed with relief.
(frowning)
(chuckling weakly)
You’ve never known how to share.
LOW ANGLE ON HER FACE, looking pleased. Almost... devious.
You lack faith in
Rowena’s wide-open eyes are glassy. UNSEEING. There’s an anxious moment, where it looks like she might be blinded-- but then, her head tilts down and her vision focuses again. Dazed, tired... but otherwise unharmed.
MICHAEL
I know Cas! I know. And I’ve got to let humans have free will, or there’s no
We pick up where we left off, with Dean and Jack looking horrified, Chuck looking smug, and Michael looking tired but not surprised.
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – CROW’S NEST – NIGHT
ON DEAN, at the wheel. His face is set with determination, and we don’t quite know whether he is Dean or Michael. Until--
The dark-haired woman straightens up-- BLEEDING from a couple of shots to her arm and shoulder-- but they’re not fatal... She grins. Vicious.
On Castiel, looking a little embarrassed.
He summons his LA-Z-BOY and a table topped with an OVERFLOWING POPCORN CARTON to the PORCH OF THE CABIN, and makes his way leisurely towards his seat. Hops onto the recliner. Grabs a fistful of popcorn.
BLACKOUT.
Well, Cas helped.
But-- if I’m God, nobody has to sacrifice themselves anymore. Nobody has to die--
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – LAUNDRY – DAY
LUCIFER
Alright, alright. Steady on, soldier. Just a couple of questions, and we’ll let you go home.
That depends on what you want.
Yes, I’ll always have you.
CHUCK
Dean immediately puts himself between Castiel and Chuck, while Sam does the same for Rowena and Jack.
LUCIFER
Just a warning, boys-- this really isn’t my area of expertise. It’s less of a delicate medical procedure and more me sticking my head into hot water and letting you know whether my burns are first, second or third degree.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Chuck snaps his fingers. The spears piercing through Dean DISAPPEAR-- and Dean collapses into Sam. His body is a BLOODY WRECK.
Crap, alright. Come on, Cas--
CHUCK
(serious)
He leans down to kiss Castiel on the forehead.
Torturer 2 leans down over Sam and digs his hands out from under him. He gets out SHINY SILVER HANDCUFFS from his pockets, and wraps them around his wrists.
You don’t have to say it, Dean. I know you don’t--
ROWENA
You can if you want. I won’t stop you. But I don’t think there’s ever going to be a fair answer. I suppose that’s why Chuck ended up playing favorites.
Amara and I will reweave Heaven’s fabric into the same pattern that you created here. I can feel the love you have imbued this bar with. All we need to do is project it outwards.
Crowley and Rowena are arguing as they stand over a POT OF WITCHY POTIONS.
YOUNGER DEAN (CONT’D)
CUT TO:
Jack--
CHUCK
(then, with a small, soft smile)
I know Sam said that he hadn’t found anything that could get him out, but...
Dean and Castiel move towards each other, still smiling... and then sway to a stop just before they go in to hug. The joyful expressions flicker. Both men hover on the threshold... uncertain.
Well, I ain’t cooking for ’em.
Michael looks at Dean, and Dean nods. It’s time.
SON OF A BITCH.
Well, well, well. Look what the cat dragged in.
Coming!
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
Dean looks away again. Then, oddly, we get a small smile-- he’s remembered a scene from long ago.
(filled with loathing)
A scene of apocalyptic devastation-- THE MAIN STREET OF LEBANON, empty of people. A few cars crashed into sidewalks and shop windows. One has collided with a fire hydrant, which is still spraying water up and flooding the street. Shopping carts, handbags, bikes and strollers lie abandoned on sidewalks. A POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD.
AZAZEL
WIDE SHOT from the side of the road. The truck slows down and draws up in front of her.
Chuck sighs. Disappointed with how easy it was to kill her. He turns back to the final rogue element, Castiel--

Will you cease speaking as though I’m not present? And if I might say so myself, I am a
Mammon moves around Dean to untie his cuffs-- Dean lashes out, and manages to TWIST AROUND TO KNEE MAMMON in the BALLS.
Oh, no. Only those with enough of a human soul were granted a freshly made body. Those who were less... developed, he put in line to be born as infants-- without any recollection of their past lives.
MICHAEL
Right. Perhaps resting is a good idea for all of us--
But it’s NOT ENOUGH. MID SHOT ON SAM-- now SPATTERED with MONSTER BLOOD AND VISCERA. We lose sight of him as the monsters close in...
Michael fixes Dean with a stern look. Doesn’t have the patience for his attitude.
INT. HEAVEN – HARVELLE’S ROADHOUSE – DAY
Silence. Sam’s mouth tightens again. Back to survival mode.
ELLEN
(shakily)
Sleeping. I think he would have blacked out right away-- his body might have been running on Earth time while he was in there.
I need you to modify an existing spell. Specifically, the one Lucifer’s vessel used to try and summon him back from the Empty.
Dean has a point. I don’t know if Jack can control that much power, much less little old me.
With that, the ROADHOUSE GANG look at Castiel expectantly. He looks back, sighs, defeated, and resumes his place at the table.
ROWENA
A beat, in which it immediately becomes clear that neither of the Winchesters wants to answer that question.
DEAN (CONT’D)
TORTURER 1
This is all very kind. I’m sure Sam and Dean would have appreciated this.
You always said that nobody in their right mind would choose this life. That you wished you could do something other than hunting.
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – LIBRARY – DAY
I failed, Cas. I failed them.
EXT. CITY STREETS – DAY
Dean looks across at Sam, unconscious beside him, and shakes him.
(jolted back to the conversation)
Tell me, Dean. What does it feel like to grieve?
What if we keep waiting? Maybe Chuck will keep sending things to fight us, and I’ll slowly get enough power--
CLOSE ON the wound, which is stitching itself back together with black goop, and--

He smiles at Eileen and takes her hand. She grins back, eyes sparkling. NAUSEATINGLY IN LOVE.
BLACKOUT.
That’s too far out of your way. I appreciate it, but we’ll be fine-- this will probably be nothing, just a couple of low-ranking demons trying to get back on top.
Um. Yes. That’s me. Bobby’s here?

Don’t worry. It was going to his head, so I cast a glamour on him. Now he looks and sounds just as miserable as you remember.

shouldn’t forgive me either. Idiot should’ve let me die and saved himself.
Castiel looks as though he is on the verge of tears. He reaches out to Claire’s shoulders, but his hand doesn’t make contact before the scene changes again--
On Sam, grinning. Totally in agreement with Jack’s sentiment. A little proud, too.
Oh, the usual. String him up like the others.
JACK (CONT’D)
(still stuck on the previous thing)
...And, I’m sorry about Crowley. Really. I mean, he saved us, in the end. For all the doubts I had over the years.
CHUCK
Perhaps I don’t know you. After all, everything we think we are was written by Chuck. Can we claim to truly know ourselves outside of him?
Dean starts up the Impala engine, puts the car into gear... and starts driving.
What the hell are you asking?
He spears Michael THROUGH THE HEAD with another pointed rod summoned up from the earth.
MICHAEL
Sure. Yeah, I can do that.
DEAN (CONT’D)
Sam Winchester did that. I merely gave him the means.
We thought the cosmic bomb was our only chance. And before that, we thought the Primordial Trapping Spell was our only chance. There’s always another chance, Jack.
Um, she uh, went to. Kansas City to get... something. Anyway. I don’t know, she’ll be back. Soon, probably.
Whoa. Harsh, sis.
The sound of a merry gathering fades in as we cut to--

EILEEN (CONT’D)
STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE
A beat, as The Empty stares. Trying to work out if this is a lie, or a trap.
Dean looks up as MORE LIGHT SHAFTS open up in the sky, a SCREECHING NOISE of ANGELIC GRACE echoes, and the scene dissolves into--
(warning)
Dean doesn’t like where this is going at all.
And suddenly, JACK VANISHES.
YOUNGER DEAN
Dean turns to Sam, with a smile.
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDORS – DAY
INT. GENTLEMEN’S CLUB BACK ROOM – NIGHT
No. No, no, no...
--a forest. Purgatory. Modified footage from 15.09 THE TRAP, in which a (slightly) YOUNGER DEAN and YOUNGER CASTIEL regard each other. The foliage and surrounding scenery is scattered with BEAMS OF LIGHT-- Dean’s relentless onslaught is already taking root here--
I need you to be my vessel.
ROWENA

And now?
Suddenly, they see the TWO TORTURERS walk out of the motel. The shorter of the two trips over something in the dark.
He waves his left hand towards Rowena again and TWISTS IT--
CASTIEL
(decides not to ask)
going to help us? After...
What’s the matter, Cas? You don’t think you deserve to be saved?
Jo hides a laugh behind a hasty cough.
(emerging from the shadows)
Chuck conjures an ARCHANGEL BLADE, and walks over to his son. Michael looks terrified-- he backs up into some open cabinets, which spill plates and cutlery over him-- various items crash to the ground, some of the plates breaking as they do--
ROWENA
THE EMPTY
CHUCK
DEATH
Not me.
CASTIEL
Sam and Dean are being dragged through the motel lobby by TORTURER 1. The lobby is an absolute wreck-- walls are stained green with mildew and mold, carpet is rotted through. Every inch of space screams ‘decrepit’.
And we cut back to--
TRUCK DRIVER
CLAIRE
INT. MEN OF LETTERS – STUDY – DAY
END OF ACT TWO
(he contemplates this, then--)
Oh, same as always. Skipping school, making trouble. I wish they were as well behaved as your Jack.
Sam and Jack BURST IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR. Sam runs three steps at a time down the entrance staircase of the Bunker, and races across the war room.
Max looks DISTINCTLY unimpressed with this particular phrasing, but Sam doesn’t realize that--
(genuinely pissed off now)
He’s in a BLANK WHITE SPACE. The exact inverse of the Empty.
So, what was your thing?
(wincing)
(to Sam, approvingly)
And what good is revenge?
BIRD’S EYE STREET VIEW straight down on a BANKED-UP HIGHWAY. Cars abandoned mid-traffic jam. Match cut to--
(gruff)
END MUSIC CUE.
Learned
BLACKOUT.
(reassuring, also signing in ASL)
Dean leaves, marching out of the war room--
CHARLIE
Does it live on more than just a page?
He allows himself a dry chuckle, but there’s no humor in it-- only bitterness.
LUCIFER
EILEEN (CONT’D)
QUICK CUT MONTAGE of the Impala from previous episodes, very similar in content and style to 5.22 SWAN SONG but incorporating new footage from later seasons. Clips from episodes such as 11.04 BABY. Fifteen seasons of memories. Sam and Dean in the driver and passenger seat, laughing, crying, talking, arguing, singing.
CASTIEL
You know. Manual labor.
You’re using my indie engine as a base for your Triple-A? Huh. How long will that take?
Hey! Don’t compare
, but--
(See the end of the chapter for
Don’t act like you know him, or me, just because you think we’re similar or whatever.
MICHAEL
YOUNGER CASTIEL
Dean shakes his head, amused.
Dean looks up from his Castiel to watch the scene. Like watching a car crash. He’s captivated and horrified in equal measure.
Or, it shouldn’t be.
MICHAEL
DEATH
But I learned to tune that out, mostly. I mean, otherwise it would have been overwhelming for all this time.
And finally-- Castiel looks up slowly towards Dean, confusion and fear beginning to clear from his eyes.
MICHAEL
No, you don’t.
You know things aren’t going to change, right? I mean, I’m not going to propose tomorrow, or anything.
There’s a pause, as Amara seems to weigh up her decision. Then--
Lucifer vanishes and REAPPEARS RIGHT BESIDE SAM in the library archway. Jack has to swivel around to face him as he walks down the steps. Dean sits up on the table next to Jack, wincing with pain.
THE EMPTY (CONT’D)
It’s... complicated.
CHUCK
I mean I’d still rather be in Heaven than Hell, but...
You do?
(nonplussed)
MID SHOT OF DEAN, lying upright on his bed. Still fully clothed. Jiggling his leg restlessly as he listens to music using his BIG BLACK HEADPHONES. He stares at the wall, deep in thought.
Castiel and Jack are walking up the Bunker’s driveway, a long road that is lined with trees on either side. (Note: similar to the driveway shown in 8.20 PAC-MAN FEVER where possible, but spaces in trees should show fields and open sky rather than industrial buildings.)
“I have no idea, what's missing?” Meg asked she knew that Ivy and Dean's father was a drunk and probably forgot many details that should have been placed in the file.
“What I don't-” Dean started to say but changed his mind, “Do you feel anything?”
“Hello, Dean,” Cas whispered back getting up to greet the other man that came in with him.
“I have something for you,” Cas said pulling the pen out of his pocket and handed it to her.
Ivy held onto Dean as they made their way down the hall to Cas’ office, Ivy sat down in one chair while Dean took a seat in the other chair and rubbed his face. Cas leaned again his desk in front of them.
"I'm with little Miss I would be mad too. Yes, I brought her down she was sitting on the steps when I came in this morning," Elle said, setting a plate of food in front of Jimmy.
No one else seemed to care, but Cas was taken back at the action. It was a little too intimate for a brother and sister, in his opinion. He was even more surprised when Dean returned the affection before setting his sister down on the ground.
“I'm sorry you are having a hard time; Dean will be back tomorrow for lunch, right?” Cas asked, reading in the file the times and days Dean came to visit his sister, noting there was only one day out of the week he didn't stay too long and another he didn't come in for breakfast,
Stella looked at the towel and then at Jimmy, who wasn't looking. She pulled it off again. She didn't like the way it felt on her skin. It was too soft.
When he was done he told Benny he would pick him up later and they would go see Ivy together it might cheer her up. She love Benny like a brother and Benny always got her to smile even laugh sometimes. Dean headed home. He looked up at the run down building, making his way up the steps and past the neighbors that were always arguing, he tossed his keys and wallet int he bowl by the front door. Dean sat down on the couch and waited for lunch to roll around so he could see Ivy and Cas again.
“What's that about?” Cas asked, noticing the exchange between the two.
“Ivy you do know I want you home, right?” Dean asked making sure his sister knew that was something that he did want.
Karen yelled up, asking what was taking so long if they were coming down; Harper looked down at the woman they thought of as a mother. She brought this man here claiming to be her twin; she knew Karen would have put him through all the test. Harper sighed, putting her gun down pushing past the man she was sure was an imposter heading down the ladder.
“Mother,” Castiel greeted coldly, the woman made whatever was going on inside of him agitated, pressing against his abdomen, trying to get out and attack the woman. He took a deep breath and let it out, excusing himself to get a drink from the kitchen.
"I'll be back for lunch, and we will meet Stella and Jimmy at home after work, ok?" Cas said to Dean.
A still sleepy Dean walked in with Cas close behind both rubbing their eyes mumbling good morning in greeting.
The spot where he could see the slick starting to pool was getting larger, slowly leaking its way down the sides of the Omegas legs.
The monster children, however, had to work harder at hiding their basic instincts and appearances.
Cas nodded, looking down at his watch, “Which reminds me, I have a shift,” he said, trying to keep the relief from his voice as he stood from the table. “I'll be back before dinner.”
“I never gave that order,” Cas replied annoyance in his voice. He worked in a few other hospitals. It was only on doctors orders were patients taken to their room.
"That should be exciting, I will be sure to make sure the others know the puppy is working while it's here, and I am sorry to hear about Stella but now that you say that it does make sense," Becky said thinking about all the times she thought Stella was ignoring her.
“I don't know,” Cas shrugged, not looking at his brother.
As they walked to the door, they could see through the Glass Dean was trying to comfort Stella while Benny sat off to the side, looking like he didn’t know what to do to help.
Dean was sleepy by the time they got done with lunch, last week after the park and the twins said they had fun Jimmy and Cas decided they would take their babies out separately once in a while like Cas taking Dean to the car museum and Jimmy had some special planned for Stella during the week after her doctors appointment.
Ivy swallowed and with shaky hands, she opened the present the rest of the way revealing a blindfold and silk ropes. She dropped the box and took off for her room, running into the bathroom she threw up curling into a ball, she started to sob just when she thought he was done with her, he would show back up.
“I'm gonna check on her and maybe I can get her to come out,” Cas said patting Ash on the shoulder in reassurance.
Jimmy nodded, unbuckling Stella and taking the empty bottle, placing it on the counter next to the sink. He let her get out on her own and explore a little, but she stayed where she was waiting for him.
Dive into Ivy's background, TRIGGERS. TRIGGER WARNING
“That's not true,” Dean said, looking at his brother and sister.
“She'll be ok,” Meg said catching on that in the short time that Cas has known Ivy she had wormed her way into he heart.
“Have I done something to offend you? Am I not what you ordered?” Castiel asked almost robotically, looking deep into Dean's eyes.
“That’s our little brother,” Dean said, pointing to the boy in the picture.
Dean looked at it, thinking he was never going to see it again, “Thanks,” he said.
“What's Up?” Dena asked, worried something had happened.
Dean let out an irritated huff and signed the paper, whatever it was, he would just send it back; it wasn't a big deal. He told the delivery guy to leave it in the living room. As the man nodded. He turned and wheeled in an over six-foot-tall box, dropping it off in Dean's apartment without care before turning and leaving. He looked the giant box up and down, deciding to wait to open it until after he had his coffee. me too
