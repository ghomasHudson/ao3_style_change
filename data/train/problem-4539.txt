Cas nodded without breaking the kiss.
Cas had agreed and had stepped into the shower… with all his clothes on. Dean was way too stunned to say anything so he spent the rest of the shower pointedly not looking at Cas’ see-through shirt. Next time, he didn’t even have to ask. Cas joined him immediately. He felt a little braver that day and told Cas that he could take off his clothes too since they were gonna get wet eventually and he would have to undress anyway. He tried to sound casual about it but to his own ears he just sounded desperate. Cas did as asked, though.
“Love you, kid.”
Dean murmured a quiet, “Thanks,”, when Cas pulled up the shower chair. The shower chair, another genius idea from Cas. Sure, Cas didn’t come up with them but he did introduce the idea to Dean. He had googled a bunch and then asked to borrow their credit cards, or rather, Mr. Zack Atkinson and his little brother Colton Atkinson’s credit cards, and a few weeks later, he disappeared for an hour or two and came back with a large package.
He nodded, his gaze stuck on the magnets on the fridge. Cas turned around and Dean realised he didn’t see his nod.
“We’re full,” the guy repeated.
Cas crawled into his arms, pressing his face into his neck.
He was both surprised and also not when not more than five minutes later there was a knock on the door.
“It’s an emotional day,” he said.
Dean rolled his eyes again, suddenly uncomfortable with Cas’ intense gaze. He knew this, technically, Cas having brought it up a couple of times. But he never knew a day like this would come. He never knew Cas was ever gonna see him naked.
Cas’ face fell.
Dean nodded, seeming to have gotten what he needed.
“Good. Hop up on the chair and I’ll start the pancakes.”
They shared a glance before Cas lifted his shoulder in a shrug.
He unbuckled the seatbelt and slid over on the bench, wrapping his arms around Dean.
Cas frowned, “Of course. I rebuilt you, Dean. I know every part of you.”
Cas smiled, “Ditto.”
“Can I… come in?” Cas asked.
Dean found him like that, half lying on the couch, staring blankly at the turned off tv.
“Did I… did I do it right?”
“Hey, uh, this place open?” he asked.
“Bye, little man.”
“Sam has been teaching me a little.”
He flipped the bread in the pan, listening to Claire’s breathing on the other side of the phone and to Jack’s inconsistent blabbering to his toys in the next room.
“Did you not like it?”
“Goodnight, dad.”
“What did you wanna talk about?” Cas asked softly.
“A nephil has come into being,” he said, straightening up and sending an urgent and panicked look at Dean, “It's the offspring of an angel and a human.”
“Okay,” Cas responded easily. Dean looked at the kitchen counter and Cas followed his gaze.
“Actually, let’s watch One Tree Hill.”
Dean huffed out a laugh.
“Maybe we can— Mmh, maybe we can fit in a little something before we wake Jack.”
“Bye.”
He smiled and leaned in, pressing a kiss to Dean’s lips. Dean hummed.
Cas knocked out Dean’s queen and Dean threw his head back and groaned. Cas was smiling at him.
“Sorry,” he said, “We’re full.”
“This seem ruined to you?”
Cas attempting to put the tie back on made him snap back to reality. He put it on the wrong way. Well, actually it was the right way, but wrong for him. Dean walked up to him and fixed it. Before he thought too much of it he leaned over and kissed him. Cas knew exactly what to do this time.
Cas did as told but he was still stiff. It made Dean pause.
“Cas! Cas, hey,” Dean said as Sam asked, “What happened? What’s wrong?”
Cas sighed exasperatingly.
She crouched down and hugged Jack.
Cas kissed his neck from behind him in acknowledgement. Dean smiled softly.
He walked back to his chair, grabbing his jacket and putting it on.
Cas nodded.
Cas hesitantly reached out and put his hands on Dean’s hips. Dean nodded in silent praise and encouragement. He moved his hands up, caressing his skin, all the way up to his chest. He flicked his thumbs over Dean’s nipples and raised his eyebrows.
Dean had his knees pulled up to his chest and Cas unknowingly copied him.
“Scoot up.”
“Now?”
Cas looked down, as if he was unaware he was wearing any.
“What? Of course, I am.”
“You already had one of those today.”
“Oh…”
Claire sighed, tilting her head, “He was referring to literally anyone on campus, not my actual roommate. Besides, not everyone is gonna get the love of their life as their college roommate.”
Dean gave a half-shrug, “I can’t feel that. No nerve connections since the surgery.”
They ended up barely talking, just listening to each their breath over the phone. It made Claire feel better. And she knew, as long as she had her family, everything was gonna be okay. Even college.
“It’s not stupid,” Cas argued, “It’s a big change, it’s only natural to want something to resemble some sort of normalcy in all the chaos.”
“Can you turn it off? Being ticklish?”
Dean signaled for him to get up so they were face to face. Cas did as asked and Dean put a hand on his cheek, all pink and flushed. He kissed him gently, Cas parting his lips on pure instinct now.
Cas was staring at him crazily, his hair all over the place, his eyes bulging. Dean almost wanted to laugh.
Cas doesn’t always join him in the shower, at first he just helped him from the side, without wetting himself completely. After a few times Dean had made some comment that he might as well just join him inside the stall. That it would make it easier to actually help him. That was the only reason, of course.
So, yeah. Dean had showers to thank for pretty much everything, he supposed.
“Right.” He laughed, “Ironic.”
He nodded.
The kiss evolved, Cas dragging his tongue along Dean’s lower lip, Dean eagerly letting him in.
“Suck up,” he said, no real power behind it.
“Want me to make you something?”
She nodded.
Dean dragged his nose along his stomach lightly but this time Cas didn’t react at all.
Dean took a deep breath before shaking out all his nerves.
“Then, yes.”
“This is insane, man. I don’t— can you really be sure it’s ours? I mean, that it’s me. We haven’t even… you know, in like two days.”
“So? I could talk some more.”
Dean threw his hands in the air, “So much for the tearful goodbye.”
Dean backtracked, “Alright.”
He chuckled, “Yeah, I remember.”
Dean shrugged off his jacket and hung it over the chair connected to the tiny dining table the room had to offer.
“Uhm, do you… you do know that I’m…”
“Hey, sweetie. You’re on speaker.”
“Weird guy,” he mumbled. He nodded to the bed, “Sit.”
Dean wanted to argue but stopped himself when he saw Cas’ face. He can be real stubborn when needed.
She nodded, “Capiche.”
“It was good,” he nodded quickly.
Cas glared at him, “My true form has three heads so according to your logic I have three brains.”
“Are you freaking out too?” Dean asked, hesitantly and a bit too enthusiastic.
Having made his choice, he removed Cas’ hands from his legs and pressed his lips to them instead. He left a trail of kisses up his left thigh, getting closer to his crotch. He then did the same thing with his right. He saw Cas clench his fists in the sheets and smiled to himself.
Cas sighed before turning to her, giving her a fond, yet sad, smile and pulling her into a tight hug.
Cas pressed his forehead to Dean’s and panted as he started moving. Dean kept showering him in praise. And Cas was doing good. Dean wondered if maybe some reflexes and instincts from their vessel shone through unintentionally. Dean knew Jimmy wasn’t in there anymore but maybe those things still remained.
“Hey,” Dean grins, a little self-consciously, smoothing his tie. “Don’t clean up too bad, huh?” He turns round and Cas gets fleeting a glimpse of Dean’s ass, perky and toned in the suit pants. Cas does drop the bagels this time. “Think I look professional enough?”
They’re still wrapped up in each other when their breathing finally slows, and Dean feels distinctly sticky and slightly nervous again. Uncertainly, he pulls away from Castiel to tuck himself back into his pants and pull his jeans up, hands trembling slightly. There are floury smudges on his jeans from Castiel unbuttoning them, and there’s a very visible white floury handprint on the black fabric of his shoulder where Castiel had gripped him as though he was the only thing that existed.
“Yeah?” Cas is smiling widely now, completely unable to stop himself. He feels giddy with happiness, the sheer elation of not being alone in this quietly incredible thing between them. He leans into Dean a little, grateful for the solid warmth of Dean’s body, reminding Cas that this is somehow really happening, that it’s somehow even better than he ever imagined.
“Oh,” Cas says, because he hadn’t thought about that. He feels a smile pulling at the corners of his mouth, warmth and happiness welling up uncontrollably, so pure it’s almost painful.
“Hey, we can get some, if you want,” Dean says, nodding towards the road, “There’s a gas station just up ahead, I wouldn’t mind stopping to stretch my legs anyway.”
He’s left so stupidly giddy by the entire encounter that he accidentally switches the cappuccino machine to “full” instead of “off” when he and Meg are closing up, which promptly results in both of them being drenched in hot foam.
The thought of not being around Cas every day makes his whole chest ache, so Dean tries not to do it. But sometimes it just creeps up on him and it’s like having a bucket of ice water poured over him, a constant knife in his chest that twists deeper and deeper as it gets closer to the time he knows they’ll have to say goodbye. It’s not just about parting ways – Dean knows there’s no way he and Cas won’t stay best friends. But it's like there's also something that Dean's always been waiting for that might not get to happen, that graduating and leaving for college might get in the way of, and even though Dean has no idea what it is he’s waiting for, the idea that it might get pushed aside, might never happen, is somehow unbearable.
“Shut up,” Cas scowls, hanging up his apron.
“None of them,” Cas replies without thinking, wrinkling his nose.
The next thing that happens is the sharp blade of the knife piercing Cas’s thumb instead of the onion he’d been chopping. Cas sucks in a breath of pain and the knife clatters to the floor, the noise making Dean whirl around.
“I haven’t decided yet,” he admits, a little breathlessly, because they spend all their time in each other’s space, but he’s not used to Dean touching him like this, with quiet intent. Almost like he could want this the way Cas does. He’s not used knowing that Dean is wearing pink floral panties under his jeans.
, one day through thick murky mist.
Dean’s eyes widen. “Then why are we only doing this now?”
“Because – I don’t know. They think they’ve got me all worked out just because of the way I look and the way I talk. Or they think there’s not much going on behind the pretty face,” Dean grins, but it doesn’t reach his eyes and it hurts to look at, how good an imitation of carelessness it is.
Pleasure throbs through Cas, heat pooling low and heavy between his legs as he feels his orgasm start to build. Gasping, he clings to Dean, forehead pressed against Dean’s shoulder as Dean’s hand works him steadily, ruthlessly. He’s already so close that it’s almost too much. At a skilled twist of Dean’s hand, Cas bites down on Dean’s shoulder – and the low, wrecked groan Dean lets out in response is what sends Cas over the edge. His world explodes, everything going a little blurry round the edges as he clutches at Dean, coming harder than he ever has in his life all over Dean’s hand.
Wordlessly, Dean nods.
“It’s fine,” Castiel is smiling, like it really is. He’s suddenly looking at Dean in a way that makes Dean’s heart suddenly feel like it wants to escape the confines of his chest.
Dean’s heart fumbles a beat in his chest, his world implodes quietly, infinitely. Cas’s mouth is hot and wet and perfect. Dean tangles his hands in Cas’s tousled hair like he’s always wanted to, tugs him closer, all warmth and racing hearts. Cas lets out a low groan against Dean’s mouth and then suddenly Dean is on his back on the bedspread, breathing heavily. It’s the same one they’ve sat on together night after night, all those times Dean wondered if this would ever happen. It should feel surreal, but it doesn’t. It just feels startlingly real, like this was always inevitable.
. The reason Cas was looking at him with all that pent-up, heated longing was because he actually wants Dean. Cas wants Dean the way Dean has always wanted him. The realisation is dizzying.
“Yes,” Castiel affirms, and he’s smiling too, a little shyly.
“I think you do yourself a disservice,” Cas tells him, more confidently than he feels. “You don’t seem straightforward to me. I don’t think anyone is.”
“I’m going to finish this,” Cas says, at last, voice even rougher than usual, sending a thrill of arousal through Dean, “And then I’m going to kiss you.”
Outside, the warm evening air fills his lungs as he gulps it down breathlessly, trying to regain some kind of control over himself. He leans against the wall and shuts his eyes, letting the golden glow of the sun against his skin ground him. It’s been weeks of this, weeks of having Cas look at him the way Dean has always wanted him to while it doesn’t mean anything. It’s all too much, how easy it’s been to indulge himself in the illusion that Cas could feel the same as he does. Dean feels as though he’s hit breaking point, but he doesn’t know where to go. All he knows is he can’t go on ignoring this, pretending it’s okay anymore when it’s slowly driving him mad and breaking his heart all at once.
But – suddenly, Dean becomes very aware of the delicious, hot pulse hammering under the skin in Cas’s neck. He can’t quite help breaking the kiss to suck on it, just gently. He’s not going to bite or anything, really. Cas lets out a low, beautiful groan and clutches Dean closer, rocking their hips together – and, god. Dean sucks harder, hands clenched into fists where he’s still cuffed. He can’t resist scraping his teeth lightly against the warm skin, groans roughly at the agonising temptation of the warm, wet blood underneath it. Cas lets out a low gasp, fists clenched in the front of Dean’s t-shirt, and – suddenly, okay, that’s about as much as Dean’s newfound bloodlust can take. He doesn’t mean to do it, he really doesn’t, but before Dean can stop himself, he finds his shiny new fangs sinking into the warm, smooth skin of Cas’s jugular. Immediately, hot, wet blood fills his senses and oh god, it’s bliss, it’s oblivion, it’s -
“This is what Christmas tasted like to you?” Cas sucks the candy again, looks at Dean.
“Oh, great,” Sam says, enthusiastically. “We were just about to stop in town and get dinner, you wanna join? We could go over the stuff you’ve brought then.”
Cas finally looks up at him, eyes so blue it hurts to look at them. “Thank you, Dean,” his voice is slightly hoarse. “This –” he breaks off, swallows, turning the album over in his hands. “This must have taken you ages.”
“God – yes,” Dean breathes, cock twitching in his pants. Castiel’s hands are deft and quick, undoing his pants and sliding into his boxers, and Dean lets out an involuntary groan at the feeling of Castiel’s fingers wrapping around his hard cock. Already dangerously close, he arches into it, burying his face in Cas’s shoulder. “Holy shit, Cas,” he groans, as Castiel pumps him slow and steady and so fucking good, making little noises against Dean’s neck like he’s as turned on as Dean is just by touching his cock.
After Cas has gone, he often places his hand over the space there. It becomes a habit he stops noticing, a way of soothing himself when nothing else can, when he’s lost, afraid of his own reflection as though he can see the memories etched into his skin. There’s nothing there now, when he looks, just pores that Cas once put back together.
“Alright?” Cas’s low, gravelly voice breaks Dean’s spiralling thoughts. He glances up fleetingly, a flash of dark blue that has Dean’s heart racing. They’ve been friends for years now, but the rush is still the same, the thrill of being this close to Cas. Fleetingly, he wonders if it’ll ever change.
Cas feels his heartrate picking up again, heat flooding his cheeks. Arousal sparks through him, tingling all the way to his fingertips and pooling low and heavy in his groin. He imagines Dean picking the panties out, running his fingers over the smooth material. Does he always wear them, or just sometimes? If just sometimes, then why today?
Warmth mixes with the heady darkness of Cas’s expression, a small smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. “Okay,” he strokes his thumb across Dean’s bicep and turns back to his work, the smile even wider than it was a moment ago.
Hesitantly, Dean holds it out and Cas’s fingers grasp it reassuringly, warm and dexterous and familiar. His heart rate picks up further, not entirely from the prospect of being tattooed for the first time. Swallowing, he watches Cas swab his bicep with alcohol and pick up the marker that’s sitting on Dean’s bedspread.
of Dean beneath the material, how hard he is. Beneath him, Dean lets out a stifled sound, and the hand in Cas’s hair tightens. He’s rocking his hips in tiny, unconscious movements, and there’s already a damp patch of precum on the front of the panties. Cas laps at it, hears Dean’s intake of breath as he tastes him for the first time, salty and sharp through the satiny material. Cas can’t help groaning at it, fingers digging into Dean’s hipbones as he nuzzles closer into Dean’s crotch, mouthing all around the hot, hard shape of Dean’s cock and feeling Dean grow impossibly harder under his lips.
“Cas,” Dean groans, pinching the bridge of his nose after hastily righting the car. “Someday, I’m gonna swerve into something when you do that.”
Cas always gives the best presents. Dean knows it’s something to do with his unnervingly observant nature, the way he’s so tuned into the people around him. Or maybe just Dean. The thought makes something unfurl in Dean’s stomach that’s feels a bit like fear, or anticipation maybe. It happens a lot when he thinks of Cas, these days. Which is a lot, if Dean is being totally honest. Cas is his best friend, has been since they were both eight years old, so it’s normal that he occupies a lot of space in Dean’s head. It’s just that these days – sometimes it’s so much that it scares Dean, just a little. Because he knows there isn’t much time left where Cas will be a daily fixture of his life; next fall, they’re both heading off to college and everything’s going to be different.
“Yes,” Dean breathes, one hand clenched against the countertop, the flush on his cheeks now spreading down his chest. “God – yes.”
The touch that presses over his hand is warm and real, nothing like heaven. A strong, rough palm covering Dean’s grip on his shoulder, burning like sun.
Cas swallows, heart pounding. He can’t seem to find his voice. It’s embarrassing how hard he is over his best friend in a pair of lace panties.
Mercifully, the impala proves remarkably unharmed by the entire debacle, which is more than Dean can say for his pride. The impala gets them safely the next five miles to a shitty little diner, where Dean sits down in humiliated silence beside Sam. Cas slides into the other side of the booth with fluid ease, as though he wasn’t just responsible for Dean destroying a well-tended garden, several antique gnomes, and the best part of a white picket fence. He’s still not wearing his goddamn trench coat, shirt unbuttoned enough that Dean can see the dip of his clavicle, the angular line of his collarbone. It doesn’t help matters.
Cas feels himself flush even brighter red, heart racing uncomfortably. He’s not used to beautiful men smiling at him like they want to know him.
“Yes, you dumbass,” Meg rolls her eyes, taking off her apron. “He was smitten. And,” she smirks, flicks Cas on the nose, “Judging by how much you’re still blushing, so are you.”
“No,” Cas admits, trying to ignore the way his heart is thumping. “But technically, we’re closed now. So, I’m no longer a barista. Just a guy who’s spent way too much time around coffee to want to think about any more than strictly necessary.”
, to see Sammy growing up” Dean breaks off momentarily, shakes his head like he’s trying to surface from deep water. Cas notes the set of Dean’s jaw, the way his knuckles are white around the wheel, resists the urge to reach out, soften them.
“My blood?” Cas asks, eyes on Dean, dark and heavy.
Relief is overwhelming, but bittersweet. Dean looks wrecked. His green eyes are stark and staring, a year of being on constant alert, and the sharp lines of his faces are hollow and shadowed. Castiel watches him check the surroundings methodically before sinking down at the bottom of a particularly gnarled tree, putting his head in his hands. Even from the shadows, Cas can sense his exhaustion. He wonders when Dean last slept, if he sleeps.
Everything crumbles. He would know that voice, that touch anywhere. He turns, and the blue of Cas’s eyes makes the colours of heaven irrelevant.
Dean’s eyes fly open, and the first thing he sees is blue. Deep, exhilarating blue. Like the sky at that moment just between dusk and darkness. And then he’s drowning. He ducks forward and captures Cas’s mouth again with his, stomach somersaulting at the stifled sound Cas makes, like he thought Dean wouldn’t do this, wouldn’t want this. The heat unfurling deep Dean’s chest intensifies at the way Cas’s hands grab at the front of Dean’s shirt, clumsy and desperate, the way Cas shifts closer, all warmth. Cas’s mouth is hot and wet and perfect, tongue twining with Dean’s as they kiss, pressing so close together that their noses nudge together, that Dean’s not sure who’s heartbeat belongs to who anymore.
“I don’t –” Dean hisses and yanks instinctively at his restraints as Cas swallows visibly, drawing attention to the pulse hammering in his throat. “
Cas nods, watches the moving December colours play across Dean’s features.
“Well, one thing’s for sure,” Dean murmurs, and Cas can feel the curve of Dean’s smile against his lips, “These panties? Best $30 dollars I ever spent.”
“I wasn’t sure you’d like it,” Cas admits, looking down, and Dean catches a hint of the nervousness Cas was full of earlier, that makes sense now. Dean feels a rush of warmth for him at the courage it must have taken to cross that line, to take a whole ten years of friendship in his hands and do what Dean never had the courage for.
Dean’s cheeks are pink with the cold now too. “Uh – yeah, it is, I guess.” He’s looking at Cas intently in the muted lights of the deserted gas station, with an expression that is familiar yet unreadable and makes Cas feel warm even in the cold.
Heart beating impossibly faster, Cas takes Dean deeper, swallowing him down until his nose is pressed flushed against Dean’s stomach again. He hollows his cheeks, flicks his tongue over the head of Dean’s cock once, twice, and then Dean is crying out, his hand clenching Cas’s but the one cupping Cas’s jaw still gentle, even as hot saltiness floods Cas’s mouth. He swallows it down, his own cock throbbing painfully at how good Dean tastes, at
In the clearing, Dean tilts his head back, gazes up at the sky. He stares into the unblinking ghostly stars for a long time, before his eyes flicker shut.
“There are lots of ways of being smart,” Cas says, carefully. He removes the strainer.
“Dean,” Cas takes a deep breath, “I’ve wanted to do this pretty much since we met,” he admits, and even after everything they’ve just done, it still makes his heart pound to confess it out loud, holding Dean’s gaze.
Dean is on his feet immediately, instincts sharper than ever – but then he freezes. His face is swathed in shadow, but Castiel can see the faint stars reflected in the green of his gaze.
Cas is looking at him, blue eyes full of a warmth and concern that’s almost harder to bear than the seductiveness. He’s looking at Dean as though nothing else matters.
Cas leans in, head bowed in concentration, fingers skilled and precise as he inks the outline of the sigil on Dean’s skin. This close, Dean can smell the distinct muskiness of Cas’s skin, the way the patchouli incense he always burns clings to his tousled hair. Dean has to force himself to concentrate on the image taking form under Cas’s touch, resisting the urge to lean in closer than he should and do something monumentally stupid like brush Cas’s hair away from his face or kiss him.
“Merry Christmas,” Dean echoes, dazedly, and his voice sounds as rough as Cas’s. He shakes his head, smiling in disbelief. “I told you that you always know what I want before I do,” he pauses, “Though, amazing as all the others were, I think this present might just top the list.” Dean is vaguely aware that he’s grinning giddily, heart still pounding.
Cas does smile then. “For the record, you’re hard to work out too.”
Pressing one last sloppy, open mouthed kiss to Dean’s neck, Cas drops to his knees, gazing up at Dean from the kitchen floor. A sharp jolt of arousal shoots through him at how affected Dean looks; his lips are red and swollen, cheeks flushed and chest heaving, his green eyes darker than Cas has ever known them.
“I don’t mind,” Cas’s tone is light, obliging, far nicer than Dean deserves. He hears Cas set down a bowl and then there are footsteps approaching.
Castiel feels as though he’s breaking apart and being mended all at once. He can just see the moon; a year since they arrived here. Dean is still praying to him, as though Castiel is as much a part of his life now as he was then, as though he couldn’t stop if he wanted to. A year of silence, and Dean is still making them both promises.
, whispered in Castiel’s ear, over and over again, as though saying it often enough would make it true. One night, barely audible;
Something passes across Cas’s gaze, eternal blue and blown pupils like supernovas, and desire entirely unrelated to bloodlust slams into Dean, leaving him breathless. He groans, strains desperately against his restraints, watching helplessly as Cas gets to his feet and approaches agonisingly slowly. Cas’s expression is torn, dazed, as though he’s still somewhere trying to make up his mind without accepting that his body already has. Closer like this, Dean can taste the clear, pure swirl of his grace, the hot rush of blood. The combination is intoxicating. Fleetingly, he can’t help thinking about how if he wasn’t tied up it would be so easy to just take one bite, one tiny nibble – but no. He wouldn’t. Dean swallows determinedly, doesn’t take his eyes from Cas.
“But seriously,” Cas presses, twisting his hands in his pockets, “Dean. I think you’re a lot more than all that stuff you just said, and I think anyone who doesn’t notice that or care about finding it out isn’t worth your time.”
“Cas,” Dean shakes his head, overwhelmed by the same fear and wonder that had coursed through him the first time he looked at that handprint on his shoulder, “I love you.”
They kiss until Dean’s jaw is aching, until they’re both breathless and grinding against each other like they’re still teenagers. When they pull apart a little to catch their breath, Cas’s eyes are shining with the same quiet happiness threatening to overwhelm Dean, full of the same longing that Dean has spent years trying to hide. Dean’s heart suddenly feels so full it hurts, and the moment turns serious, quiet, as they lose themselves in each other’s gazes just like that first night they met. Gently, Dean traces the line of Cas’s jaw, and when he pulls him in again, the kiss is searing, poignant, so full of promise it should terrify Dean, but it only makes his heart beat harder. Cas’s hands are all over his skin, more memorable than any ink.
Cas’s heart is pounding. He knows this is his only chance; Dean is far too observant of him usually. Making sure Dean’s attention is still on the iced buns, Cas grabs a pen from beside the register and, before he can lose his nerve, quickly scrawls his number on a napkin in untidy blue ink. He’s just debating whether to add an ‘x’ at the end or not, when Dean’s voice floats over from the display.
“I very much hope that’s true this year,” Cas says, quiet in a way that makes Dean catch his breath, inexplicably nervous too. He’s looking down, still fiddling with the stray thread from the cuff of his jumper. His expression is uncharacteristically vulnerable in the soft light, messy dark hair and wide eyes so blue that they make Dean’s heart fumble a beat in his chest when Cas suddenly looks up, holds Dean’s gaze. It’s very quiet, the space between them. Dean feels very aware of his heart, doesn’t know why it’s suddenly going quite so fast. “You go first,” Cas says, low, eyes intent and full of
When they eventually part, the sun around them has melted into a honeyed glow and Cas’s hands linger on him, like he doesn’t want to let go. They look at each other in the soft evening light, and there’s all the smouldering heat of the last several weeks in Cas’s gaze, but also something softer, something so earnest it makes Dean’s heart fumble a beat. Cas with smouldering seductiveness darkening his blue gaze had been a lot to take. But, Dean realises, Cas like this, eyes shining with quiet happiness, is the most devastating of all.
“Well, yeah,” Dean grins, a little sheepish, “I’d have thought that much was obvious. I don’t just go around hassling all the baristas around town, you know.”
“Hamlet, is he that guy with the skull always shouting about ghosts?”
on the counter between them, white dust exploding out of it in a soft cloud that settles over both of them like snow.
As far as situations go, it’s not ideal. For starters, Dean is – temporarily – a vampire. Which is a fairly stressful state of being, actually. His gums are still tender from where his brand-new fangs have made an appearance, and everything is so fucking
The colour is high on Dean’s cheeks as he shakes his head, “No. I think I’d rather have yours, actually.” And before Cas can say anything, Dean’s lips are suddenly on his, soft and warm, so warm in the cold air. Cas feels as though he’s been holding his breath for years and is suddenly able to breathe. It’s wonderful, the heat of Dean’s mouth against his, the slick of his tongue twining with Cas’s, tasting of peppermint and making something hot curl deep in Cas’s stomach. His hands are cupping Cas’s face, rough skin, tender touch. Cas is breathing hard when Dean pulls back, both of their breath clouding the December air between them. “Tastes better on you,” Dean grins, and it’s a beautiful thing, tentative and free here in the cold without heaven watching.
, finally here and only just now, to choose this—)
Language is funny that way.
With a "Cas, don't forget my bag, alright? Must've slipped under your seat," Sam leaves them alone.
(Another glance: Castiel has found a bench. He's slumped, staring up at the stars.)
(Until two months ago, he survived day in and day out with the grim certainty that tomorrow was never his to claim.
"Cas, how don't you know?"
In all the times he did indulge, he never allowed himself to play through the sweet. The tender.
Then harder. But sweeter, too.
—heat.
The crack in Cas' voice startles Dean from wherever he drifted off to. It's then Dean hears how Castiel's breathing has gone thin. How he draws into himself. Looks at his hands. Clenches them into fists.
What comes out next is not what Dean intends to say: "You know I'll always be by your side."
"What's up?" Sam asks, leaning against the threshold of his room, bag tucked inside.
Dean's a selfish little prick who sometimes can't pull his head out his ass long enough to realize his impact? Nowhere near his intention. He was so wrapped up on internalizing Cas' confession, he never gave Cas a hint that he was wrong about Dean. And now that Dean finally tried to start the conversation, he's only told Cas they need to talk; thinking back at his constipated attempts at language earlier, Dean hasn't given Castiel any indication of what about. Or rather, what Dean might possibly have to say. Cas has already long dismissed any possibility of requited feelings.
Cas' thunderous gasp only steadies Dean's resolve.
"I want—"
He swallows. Hard.
"Anything."
Castiel grimaces. "It's fine. The timing was a surprise, but I sensed it was on the horizon."
Pissed?
Their eyes meet for a confrontation with blue and an exaltation of possibility.
It had when he needed it not to the most: at Castiel's confession—his dying words a protective chant, his affirmations an anointed blessing that Dean lost himself in.
…And that's it, isn't it?
(Dean loves Cas so, so much.)
This—with fucking everyone who came back with less than a blink of an eye: a mere phasing in and out… and the world was back again.
Dean's teeth sink into Cas' lips, nipping back into them a tender red haze.
Utterly.
and sometimes just a confessional through his name:
Dean wants to tear apart his side.
Moan.
"Cas," Dean says between kisses. "My legs are falling asleep."
"Well? What have you to say?"
He has demands, and they involve an arm wound round his waist, his butt to a pelvis, and little butterfly kisses to his spine.
Kiss.
(And, on any other day, Dean suspects his voice would catch on the depth of the truth.
Because if Sam had told him then to get lost or get dead as Dean feared, Dean knows… he wouldn't have lasted the month. Died daddy's little blunt instrument, anonymous and forgotten, without having known anything else. Then for a while, they were everything to each other and still are, but the sickening codependency has changed: healed. They have others in their lives, in a way that

"Dean, I beg of you." An undeniable Enochian register deepens Castiel's solemnity. "In this, you must not tease me. You mustn't—"
Inhale.
Deep, deeper.
…Oh the fucking
"Tell me—"
There's so much to say. There's too much to say.
Everyone's back and truly
Dean brought the lube; he can't be faulted for forgetting the come rag.
(He needs this.)
Now, though…
Came back better—even—because they finally stayed the writer's hand.
"Stop." A soft rustle sounds as Cas moves around the backseat, digging around. A bag comes up in Dean's periphery. "Bring this to Sam, and leave the room keys at the desk. I… I will follow when I'm ready."
(Dean doesn't fully know what he's saying, or why he feels so listless over this need for reassurance.
A gentle echoed affirmation of Castiel's confession, and a utilitarian acceptance of what is and was, all at once.
(Dean has never been more thankful for the emergency 3mL lube bottle he keeps in his to-go bag.)
Dean's hands are locked on the steering wheel, thumbs whittling into the leather. He doesn't make to move except to glance at Cas in the rearview mirror.
Died using his last words to say as much.
in a way it could never be before to get up from the table. To cross the room. To kneel down at Castiel's feet, even with the itch at his side.
It'd be unfair… no, it would be unjust and cruel to make him wait any longer.
It has for years now.
(What's compelling Dean now may be a slip in the timestream or some other Star Trek crap; it feels like it. Or maybe a near hysterical acid reflux from his core churning toward his throat. Maybe it's the exact edge of desperation that only cuts across prayers screamed in mounting hallelujah.)
Hands on Dean's hips, drawing him close—close—closer—
Yes… and no.
Completely.
Sam's stinkface communicates quite clearly that he won't let this lie.
A kiss to his collarbone—
—hum against his jaw—
(He stayed curled on the floor in the dark for hours.
"If… if you need me, right? I'm there."
Lips touch lips in a kiss not-kiss: a sharing of breath held too long.
The difference.
There's an itch in Dean's side, though, that is aching something strong, and it's not just the lockjaw risk of a scratch dug across his ribs.
"I love you. I really do."
"We can go at your own pace. I just thought…"
Cas lets out a little huff that's more laugh than scoff. "I believe we are currently fulfilling th—"
Sam's response comes after a beat too long to be anything other than shrewd, his curiosity at the emotional undercurrent in the car pushing calculations through that big head of his at a mile a minute. Finally: "You're disgusting." It's a throwaway stock reply of a little brother, not quite halfhearted but also not making an effort to press Dean.
Well, it's that. But it's also the strange heaviness lingering after the fight, like an inhale caught between him, Sam, and Cas as they ride through the night to get as far outta dodge as they can. It's the same breath stolen since the moment Cas ripped whatever post-resurrection grace Jack snuck behind and used it to fling a shuriken at the final killer clown vamp's calf. Had to be some kind of miracle, because there shouldn't have been enough time to aim it, what with Cas' reflexes adapting to humanity for the millionth time.
"Huh?" Concern furrows Sam's brows as he stops short.
Willing himself to see what Cas saw.
Exhale.
Dean wishes he could spend all night kneeling at Cas' feet. The way Castiel hunched over him, maneuvering their locked hands behind Dean's neck to draw the kiss deeper: Dean's definitely had this dream before.
"Fair." Sam opens the door to his room. Takes a step in. "Guess I'll see you tomorrow then?"
Here, there should be a joke. A pissy little comment.
Free fucking will.
like ten weeks ago—was almost killed by an evil mime and Chekhov's rusty nail. Anything can happen on a day like today, this day that started with pie and also mourning of all Jack couldn't zap back and John's journals somehow with Baby pulling through for what has to be her millionth and a half mile, plus Sam, his Sammy, there at his side…
Dean tries at the handle and obviously can't turn it. With more strength than may be called for, he punches the door crying, "Bitch!" and flips the peephole off for good measure.
He was a fool for wasting the past two months, aching during sleepless nights as he convinced himself that maybe, just maybe, he deserved to be loved.
It's hard to find his voice after a long drive in silence but Dean manages as he pulls into the first motel with vacancies he sees. "Hey, Sammy," Dean says as he rolls Baby to a stop, "find out the rates and where we can find the greasiest breakfast burger in town for the morning."
"Thank you for securing an extra room. It was thoughtful of you."
Willing himself to understand.)
But it's been a few scant hours since the vamp had Dean in his grasp, and at the moment when the nail's point made contact with his skin, all he could remember was standing outside Sam's dorm door all those years ago. So many
And as Dean has learned and will have to bully Cas into loosening up his standards around, Castiel can't fucking lay there in the wet spot and
"Well," Sam draws out. "If that's all you're going to say about it… fine. I'm going to finish my homework. If you want to help me practice…"
Dean's mouth goes dry.
But he knows it's right. He's right.)
Instead, teeth drag against clenched teeth.
for a damn moment.
"Anything."
Something's off. But what? What did Dean miss? He flounders, "Seriously, if now's a bad time…"
There have been a lot of these touches lately.
(So so long…)
To be fair, they're rank. Covered in jizz and BO and spit and lube—blood, too, maybe, if his stitches split. The sheets are sweat-through and pulled from their corners. Cas reminds Dean they have a clean bed in the third single. But Dean ain't moving nowhere, what with him shuddering and fucked out of his goddamn mind, and he won't let Cas leave him either: just him reaching to turn off the lamp was enough to send Dean whining.
"Dean—yes. Of course—of—!"
And hell, if he's regarding mortality and age, when did
He has driven with less sleep in rougher shape for far longer, but Dean hits his limit twenty minutes after the Illinois border.
And the little spoon.
It always messes Dean up: just when did Sam go ahead and grow up?
"I think I'd better wash off. Smelling like a barn ain't my idea of a study hour."
Return. Oh—an actual kiss.
Then again, if (...once) Sam finds out all the details of him and Castiel, Sam is going to fucking throttle him for being an idiot.
Something about this, after two months of easy work and no Big Bad on the horizon and no deus ex machina laying in wait to fanfiction the shit out of his life—
Dean might have to accidentally lose that knife over the side of a bridge next time he does inventory.
Castiel laughs and lets go of Dean's hands. He pats the bed. "Care to join me?"
"You aren't m—"
He loves Cas.
to take a risk: to raise his hands slowly to Cas'. His thumbs whisper for permission against the fists they find, and the rest of Dean's fingers follow as Castiel slowly opens for him.
It was, in a way. Only took them a quick fifty minutes to find the kids, clean themselves up, ready disposal of the double-dead meatbags, and make a tactical drop-off of the now-orphaned boys at the station. In and out, wham bam thank you ma'am, the monster of the week put down, and somehow, a loose end that no one remembered needed tying up went ahead and did just that in a neat little headless bow.
Break.
Cas wasn't by Dean's side at the moment of walking away from God and all that was promised—all that ever could and may have been—to pursue this, here, now and tomorrow in his mortal life. This is it. This is free will, and free will almost got him killed in the most mediocrely boring way possible but it was free will and that should mean something, right? And it should mean something that there's nothing—actually, there's
His soul and all of who he is pressed to his skin in a freckled flush, his very life blood rushing to get close—close—closer to Castiel.
Sam doesn't know about the job application Dean's got in his room. Sam doesn't know about Dean's Indeed account, or Dean's call with an honest to God career coach last month, or the help on his resume he recruited from the nice librarian two towns over. Doesn't know about the throwaway credit card Dean set up specifically to complete something called a StrengthsFinder Assessment just because it sounded interesting and hey, maybe it was nice for once to be told he was

"I need…"
For all their touches, they haven't talked much in the last two months, since Cas came back. Not since…
Working with Sam on his signing would be a good distraction. Sam went full blown with his lessons having enrolled for an accelerated online course. Meanwhile, Dean's been focused on the job search, so he's been putting off his own studies—but he knows he wants to. Will. For Sam and Eileen and also just because it's all around a good idea.
Sam rolls his eyes, "Sweet dreams." Then there's a smirk as he slams the door on Dean and slips out a quick "Jerk" as the lock engages.
Clutching.
"Dean, you need rest."

Sam's eyes glow with emotion, their shine wise but not distant. Jesus—he's Dean's baby brother but he ain't no boy no more.
The soft smile he gets in return makes Dean think it's the latter. "I love you too."
"That fight really did a number on you, huh," Sam adds when Dean doesn't say anything else.
"If you—if it's too much… We don't have to tonight. I wasn't even meaning tonight, really. I don't want to pressure you into anything. I just figured we should eventually and—"
A not-flirt flirt. A not-touch touch.
Issue is, though, the dream? It never accounted for his old knees.
The Impala's headlights shine on a wall that has seen better days. Even at night, Dean can tell a waxen muddy peach covers the expanse of the motel's chipped exterior: the kind of brownish pink that reminds Dean of the linoleum kitchen floors in most decaying Midwest suburbs. They're in the same houses with wood-paneled living rooms, a doily under the remote canister, and at least two well-worn cat towers. The bathrooms would have eggshell- or lavender-colored, artfully arranged, look-don't-use hand towel displays that Dean took great pleasure in disrupting and—
—slip of clever fingers—
Hand to his cock.
Sam doesn't mention Dean bringing him his bag. Nor does Sam question Dean when he asks for three singles, though that's the second most expensive configuration available. He hits his limit, however, when Dean walks him to his room and then hovers at the entrance.
"Cas, no. It ain't like that."
Cas has already said so much. He's waited too long.
"I don't know what to say."
"Sleep well, Dean."
Tries.
Dean imagined sex with Cas endlessly over the years. Favorite fantasies included hate fucks and life-affirming handjobs and "educational" tutelage of the sexual variety; methodical mind-controlled drilling into Dean's ready mouth; wings and glowing eyes, shredded clothes and being lifted like a doll. Weird hentai shit and kinks, lots of kinks. A panty here and a hearty slap across his ass there. Biting and nails dug into skin, pinned wrists and Cas fucking him like he's trying to nail Dean to the mattress. The aforementioned kneeling.
Blue eyes stare back. Unflinchingly.

Wet heat rushes into him.
. Feelings talk."
Dean doesn't know if he can form sentences. But he must, he has to, he—"Tell me… tell me I can have this. I can—that it's okay to— "
How could he not?)
The bedside lamp casts a soft ochre glow that bathes Castiel in ethereal stillness. It's a familiar one, found so long ago in an autumn dreamscape Dean remembers more as instinct than memory. The humble beauty feels like something straight out a Renaissance painting, and the near uncanniness of it—of Cas—strikes him stupid.
His eyes laser onto Castiel's in the rearview as Cas tilts his head in confusion. "Would it not be more effective to debrief with Sam?"
Exhale.
Wanting.)
"He needs a breather."

"Yes, Dean. I'm yours."
Dean only realizes right then that—Dean? Yeah, he's a fucking
Perhaps Castiel (as Dean would do in his shoes) has been readying himself for an awkward conversation. A "well-meaning" kind rejection. An affirmation of friendship and brotherly love—only. A hapless
And Dean knows that whatever happens after he and Cas have their talk… things are gonna be different. In a way he can't anticipate, and something about the not-knowing… it's starting to feel exciting. Frighteningly wondrous.
"I wanna learn what that kind of happiness looks like—with you."
Dean looks away. Ahead. (Away.)
(Quiet falls.
(That would be an edge—a cliff—a knife's blade—that Dean is too familiar with. He's lived his entire life there so far. It's the same cut of gritty fingernails once digging into his scalp, cupped palms close as if that alone could hold Cas' confession tight to his skin.)
"I love you."
Holding heartbeats sunk into palms like psalms.
Castiel sits on the bed still decked out in his hunter gear. Dean feels underdressed in his sweats and a thin tee, but ultimately he's extremely happy he brought a change of clothes into the bathroom instead of walking out in the buff. Dean honestly didn't think Cas would have sought him out so soon, if at all tonight.
. I'm only the man in front of you because we've been sharing our lives together—in a team with Sam then with him and Jack, and in a family with them and the rest, but there was always this undercurrent… something just ours.
It also depressed the fuck out of Dean.
And very, very needy post-orgasm.
Sam crosses his arms, more thoughtful than defensive. "Of course."
(Like, come on. Jenny, of all people…
(He never thought he would live this long.)
"Sure. Let me know if you need help with the stitches."
"I thought you didn't notice because you simply couldn't, your big angelic blues seeing beyond a puny human with his puny human feelings. I understood. I was miserable, but I understood. At least when I had you, I had you. And yeah, you're right, there's happiness in just the being. With you at my side, I had some measure of it. I am learning the part about the saying; need some practice on that bit. But. But, Cas, I know one thing…"
, once Dean knows to listen.
lifetimes ago.
(A hand rises up Dean's side to curl around his left bicep to pull him closer, holding tight in its grip an echo of what was and—now—what always will be.)
There's no desperation in his voice. No terror. No death rattle. No sarcasm. No flippancy. It may be the first time in a very, very long time that he's said those words to Sam without emotional pretense. Maybe it's the first time.
(He's wanted this for so long…)
Between the three of them, the rest of the night should've been easy rolling.
These are very, very important demands.
"Yes?"
"I love you."
"Hello, Dean."
The fantasies were there. But the longer he knew the guy and the more profound their profound bond got, the rarer it became that Dean followed through on actually jerking it to Cas. It felt weird. Invasive, and too intimate. Too desperate.
…Maybe they'll get around to those last few.
It takes them a moment to sort things out, but eventually, they both are satisfied.
"I appreciate your flexibility, but there won't be a
This is how he learns his name can be as a benediction once Dean knows to listen.
Realization strikes hard. Fast. Wicked. If Dean hadn't been Clockwork Orange flashbacking the latest (and if he can help it, last) time he lost Cas, the expressions on Castiel's face would have petrified him as they once had. Now, they only flood Dean's ears with a panicked yet anticipatory heartbeat.
Dean knows what is right there in front of him, but he can't make his coward mouth put out the words he needs to.
Amazing how just about anything can sound like

Dean coughs, overcome. "I'm gonna—" Dean knocks a thumb behind him.

"Yeah, yeah." Dean slugs Sam in the shoulder. "Don't mother hen me now."
get so damn old?
—flush of his cheeks—
"Cas…"
The sense-memory of just how profoundly Dean could—and has—fucked this up is not a literal stake to his chest but he is still pierced by the raw jolt of his own previous silence… silences… they hurt. Jesus, they hurt so much, more than being thrown to the floor like a sand bag and more than most of the injuries long-scarred across Dean's body.
, too."
A part of Dean desperately wants to join Sam and avoid whatever mess awaits him if Castiel wants to find him tonight. Dean feels guilty that he's tempted even though he was the one that dropped the bombshell on Cas; the self-flagellation here is familiar and warm and grounding in the worst of ways. Dean could also drag out the inevitable for as long as possible if he tells Sam the truth; he'll have to suffer through the scolding. At least then he might be able to get some advice afterward.
"I'd like that."
Flickering menacingly in the dim illumination filtering in through the windshield, Castiel's expressions now twist openly, so vulnerable as Cas has too often been with Dean in the past few years. There—in pulled and beautiful wrinkles—is sorrow and hope and ease and fear and more emotions than Dean can ever hope to name beyond to describe that same jumble within himself. The pink around those big blues fall fallow from exhaustion and shock. Earlier's muddy peachness seems to find a new home as shadows fall on Castiel's lips as they draw themselves wide.
"And you managed to piss him off?"
had taken over, and his eyes began to water, vision tunneling and cock scalding hot, hypersensitive to the tiniest stimulation.
Dean cried harder, hiding his face in Castiel’s neck. He was so fragile, and small in the Alpha’s arms. Castiel felt as if he’d been hit in the back of the head with a club.
Pulling himself back from the memory, Cas recalled it was Saturday, which meant Dean didn’t have to get ready to go to the college campus. Instead he’d be sleeping in, exhausted after a busy week, but even more exhausted and fucked-out after last night's activities. Cas had fucked him long and hard, pistoning roughly into Dean's tight channel while he was practically bent in half, thighs shaking from a youthful flexibility put to the test.
So, on top of unfairly good-looking and hot as hell, Dean was also excruciatingly endearing. Castiel was such a goner.
“I’m -I. I fuck ‘em all, but no one -
Better never to taste the forbidden fruit, he guessed.
How anyone could hold a grudge against Dean and deliberately cause him harm was beyond Castiel, his Alpha was seething, but it was simply a natural protective response, and years of stupid one-sided pining. Regardless, the present situation demonstrated that some lines were not to be crossed. If any vow should be regarded as holy, Castiel was sure it’d be marriage. Mating was pure, honest, and trespasses against the bond could hardly be forgiven, even if one of the perpetrators was the most appetizing Omega in the whole county.
. But he’d try. He’d try not abusing Dean’s ass like he craved, like an Alpha intent on mounting his heated Omega bitch, seed aimed at the opening of the cervix to ensure he caught. He could refrain from biting down on Dean’s mating gland, fighting what every cell in his body was begging him to do.
So, push he did.
And then Dean was talking, amidst moans, with broken words, halted by sighs and keening, whimpering, sobbing. “I– I dreamed of you Cas. Always do, you and me. We – ah! We were at the park, where we met. You- fuck, fuck! Ah… okay, uhm. I was walking Miracle, just like… just like that day. I felt someone staring at me, no– not at me, at my, nngh, my b-butt,” the last word came out shaky, meaning that despite everything, Dean still felt vulnerable when talking about himself this way, “But Cas, in the- ah! In the dream I was n-not wearing my red shorts, I mean… I –fuck, Cas! Right there. Fuck! Your tongue feels so good fucking me. Fuck! Yes, y-yes. Uh, okay. Okay- I. Ah! I- I was wearing the shorts, but they were, god– they were shorter, Cas, so much shorter… my – my ass was hanging out, and even – mmm, yes. Cas you could, you could see my balls. The shorts didn’t cover them … too damn short.”
Dean was definitely an attention whore, but even after months of dating, they weren’t quite there yet.
“I couldn’t stop myself, Cas. I feel so empty all the time, so I let those Alphas fuck me. Feels good for a little while, real good, but then I can’t go on. I can’t take their knots because -because they’re not you!”
Castiel moaned and driven by some primal instinct, he made quick work of Dean’s belt and pants, until the boy had nothing but a pair of lacy panties to protect him from Castiel’s delirious Alpha. Next went Castiel’s own pants and boxers, till they were shoved past his knees.
“You know I do, sweet boy. Wouldn’t haven woken with my tongue up that pretty hole of yours otherwise.”
Dean blinked twice, doe-eyes growing impossibly darker with lust as Castiel wrapped a hand around his length and jerked him lazily, thumb swiping at the wet crown. Unconsciously, Dean licked his lips and Cas didn’t miss the fraction of a second in which Dean caved.
Reluctantly, Cas shakes his head. “He’s got a big interview tomorrow. I don’t want to upset him.” He rubs foam off his chin.
“And how is that?” Cas asks, eyes darkened. He’s leaning forwards, too close even though he’s still all the way across the room. Dean can
“Oh god, please don’t tell me you read my annotations,” Cas groans, putting his face in his hands, “They’re just nonsense. I just scribble down whatever comes into my head as I’m reading and then put it into more coherent notes later.”
“Here,” Dean’s nose is pink from the cold, eyes bright as he leans back against the car beside Cas, hands him a paper packet. “Peppermint candy canes. Go on, knock yourself out.” He sticks his hands in the pockets of his leather jacket and stares up at the sky, like Cas had been moments before. Cas wonders whether Dean is comforted by the blankness too, or if he aches for the far-distant twinkling lights and their warmth, so long absent from his own life.
Pulling back, Dean manages to knock a shower of flour to the ground in his haste to get to Castiel’s side of the bench. His heart is racing and his mouth is still tingling from Castiel’s kisses, but finds himself hesitating when he’s there, nothing separating them, suddenly strangely nervous. Castiel just looks at him like he always has, the way Dean has never been able to get out of his head. Only the blue is darker now, coloured with something beautiful, quietly hopeful. His hair is stupidly messy and dusted in white, and when Dean takes a step forward and touches it, tentative, Castiel lets out a breath like he’d been holding it, like he wasn’t sure Dean would want this. Like Dean hasn’t been losing his mind over this slowly growing thing between them for the last five weeks.
Dean’s expression shutters slightly, before being quickly masked by his characteristic carefree grin. “Oh?” he scrubs at his mouth briefly, glances down at his hand, “Got it?”
“How – how was your day, anyway?” Cas stammers, ducking his head as he hurriedly starts preparing Dean’s tea, because he doesn’t know how to deal with Dean looking at him like this. He feels self-conscious and a little dizzy from how hard his heart is beating.
“You’ve been distracting me,” Dean murmurs, senselessly, lost in Castiel’s gaze and the softness of Castiel’s rumpled hair beneath his fingertips, the warmth of his body so close, “Looking at me like this.”
“Yeah?” Dean says again, but he’s grinning this time.
Cas has always looked a little devastating. Rumpled dark hair that makes him look like he’s just been thoroughly fucked, and those intense, deep stares that make Dean forget his own name. But lately – lately, Cas has become a whole other thing. The dishevelled hair has acquired an artful, tousled look, and he takes off his trench coat sometimes, showing off the strong, lean lines of his torso and the slender angles of his hips. Sometimes, if it’s warm, he even rolls his sleeves up. It’s driving Dean a little bit crazy.
you.”
Cas feels his cheeks flush burning hot. “Uh – thanks.” When Dean just looks at him, smiling in a way that makes Cas’s fucking toes curl, he stammers out, “How was your day?”
Obligingly, Cas opens the box. It is empty, save a couple of crumpled silver wrappers, but it smells of ghostly peppermint. Cas sniffs, imagines little Dean and Sam sitting in the impala alone on Christmas day. His chest aches at the thought of Dean trying to distract Sam, keep him happy and amused while Dean was probably afraid. “I’ve never tried peppermint,” he tells Dean, inhaling again and trying to figure out the scent. It’s sharp, clean, a little powdery. Like dusty snow. “What’s it like?” he asks, curiously.
“Lots of things,” the guy grins wider, and leans closer into Cas’s space. He smells of faintly of mint and smoke and warm skin, like he’s spent all day in the sun. “I’m not fussy.”
Dean swallows, “As I’ll ever be.”
Dean smiles too, the hesitancy melting away. “Okay,” he says, golden-green eyes shining with something that makes Cas’s stomach turn over, “See you tomorrow, Cas.”
Abruptly, Cas, sits back on his haunches, breathing hard. “I can’t concentrate like this,” his eyes are darker than Dean’s ever seen them, a flush just visible creeping up the exposed skin of his chest. He lets go and sets his materials on the bedside table without moving away from Dean, without letting go. Slowly, not breaking eye contact, Cas leans back in until they’re even closer than before, both breathing unsteadily. Then, with the same tender carefulness with which he’d just been tattooing Dean, Cas leans in and kisses him.
When they met last year at some freshman house party, it was pretty much all Cas could think about the whole time Dean was speaking to him. Dean had a sharp jaw and soft green eyes and had been wearing a sleeveless Zeppelin shirt, exuding this air of raw attractiveness Cas hasn’t encountered before or since. Dean had leant against the banister of the stairs, right into Cas’s space, and talked to him about Slaughterhouse 5 and mechanics and baking in a low, easy drawl. When he’d laughed, he did it with his whole body, head thrown back, face lit up like the sun. He’d given Cas a clumsy, drunken hug at the end of the night and written his number on the palm of Cas’s hand in sloping, black ink.
“Were you listening?” Cas says, indignantly.
“Nah, I don’t think the future’s that simple,” Dean says, “Don’t think it’s set in stone. I think it changes all the time, depending on what choices you make, who you meet.”
“Irresistible?” Cas’s brow is furrowed, expression unreadable. His pulse is throbbing through the space between them, hot and wet, and god, Dean wants him.
“Shut up,” Cas nudges him playfully, and they end up sprawled on the floor in a tangle of limbs, laughing. Cas winds up with his cheek pressed against the discarded pink satin panties, the material soft and lacy against his skin.
“Okay?” Cas asks quietly above the sound of the needle, not looking up.
“Will you have one too?” Cas asks, peering into the bag and tentatively drawing out one of the striped candies before handing it back to Dean.
“Blue?” Dean frowns in confusion, catching sight of the ink staining Cas’s fingers. His voice is lower and softer than usual, despite the uncertainty.
“How much you want to come over here right now,” Dean whispers, low and seductive. He can feel his fangs descending a little at the prospect of Cas’s soft, supple skin, the heat of it under his mouth. “How much it affects you, seeing me
Cas swallows, trying to ignore the low, heavy ache between his legs as he pulls at the elastic of Dean’s panties again, thumbing at the skin under it as he looks up imploringly at Dean. Dean, for his part, looks as wrecked as Cas feels.
It works; Dean laughs out loud, beautiful and lit up and all for Cas.
Dean takes another deep breath, ignores the way his heart is racing. “I know you’re an angel and so you probably don’t get this at all, but the way you’ve been looking at me recently, all – all smitey and intense – it’s sort of what people do when they want to fuck the other person, Cas. And I know that’s not your intention, that’s not what you’re actually trying to convey,” Dean swallows, ignoring the heaviness in his heart, “But I just wanted just wanted to let you know that’s how humans would probably interpret it. So, maybe, you know, tone it down a little. It’s – uh – kind of distracting.”
crammed into a single, charged moment.
Cas nods, pouring boiling water onto the tea leaves. “Yes, we don’t see each other much though. My family is –” he waves a hand dismissively, “Complicated.” He closes his mouth abruptly, embarrassed at the honesty Dean seems to elicit so automatically in him.
There’s a pause that feels almost as long as the last year, then –
Cas is silent. There’s a pause that might be a single heartbeat or the whole last ten years, and then there’s warm, tentative pressure against Dean’s mouth. Cas’s lips, silken soft and hot, brushing tenderly, slowly, against his. Cas’s hands cupping his face, rough and warm and trembling, holding him still as the world spins away into nothing. Cas’s breath, gentle and unsteady against Dean’s mouth, punctuating the kiss.
“Dean,” Cas feels the smile spread across his face, all his awkwardness eclipsed by genuine delight, “That’s amazing. Congratulations.”
“You left,” Cas says, dishevelled hair illuminated in all its glory by the setting sun. His brow is furrowed in worried confusion, and he looks so gorgeous in the soft golden light that it’s hard to look at him. “Are you alright?”
“Student? I thought you looked the brainy type,” the guy clearly catches a glimpse of the expression on Cas’s face, “I don’t mean that in a bad way,” he adds, hastily, “No way. Honestly I’d give anything to be smart like that. My brother is super brainy, but not me.”
They’d met at freshers’, at some house party thrown by someone Dean doesn’t remember. Dean had known he was a goner the moment he glanced up and found Cas’s blue gaze on him, quiet and intent, head tilted slightly, watching Dean like he was fascinated, like he could somehow really
“Cheers, Cas,” Dean’s voice is indistinct around a mouthful of raspberry muffin. “I can’t stay, but –” he swallows, suddenly looking almost serious, “Thanks for this. Seeing you this morning is – well, just what I needed.”
“It was just in here with your Dad’s old phone, under the map,” Cas replies, turning it over interestedly in his hands. There’s a faded image on the front he can’t quite make out, worn green and silver and gold. The colours of Dean’s eyes, as he looks at Cas in the half-light of the unfolding road. “What is it?”
“Cas,” he chokes out, “
He stares at the door for several moments after Dean has closed it behind him, until Meg creeps up behind him and pokes him in the back, making him jump. “Not in a rush to close up today, Castiel?” she sing-songs in that way she always does when she’s teasing him.
, goddamn it.”
“It does make my mouth feel cold,” Cas observes, with interest. He sucks the candy further into his mouth and pulls it out with a pop, feeling the cool cleanness of the air being pulled between his lips. Dean clears his throat slightly. “I haven’t encountered any other food that has this effect,” Cas licks slowly at the tip of the candy, and is aware of Dean inhaling sharply, “Do you know what causes it?”
“Dean,” Cas is holding the wrapped present, but he’s not looking at it. He’s looking at Dean with the kind of familiar, earnest sincerity that makes Dean’s heart ache, that he’s going to miss so much. “There is no chance of me ever forgetting you,” Cas says slowly, and the
“Uh – I’d better get going,” Dean does smile then, although it’s a quieter thing than the cheeky, flirtatious grin Cas is used to. It somehow makes his stomach somersault even more, warmth spreading through him. Dean rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, and fumbles in his pocket for his wallet, sliding a note across the counter towards Cas. “Can’t be late for meeting Sammy, but – uh – I’ll be sure to come in tomorrow for another one of these,” he nods at the green tea Cas has just made him. “Keep the change.”
“It’s just – I didn’t – I didn’t mean to do that,” Cas mumbles, heart thudding. He’s trying to fit in the logic of this being reality. Of Dean really wanting him. It doesn’t seem like it should be real. It doesn’t fit. “I mean – I wanted to,” he adds, hastily, feeling Dean tense beside him, “I just – I didn’t ever expect it to happen, or anything.”
The next thing Cas is aware of is Dean’s arms around him, both of them breathing unsteadily against each other. They’re sitting on the kitchen floor against the cabinet, clothes scattered around them in disarray. With a rush of heat, Cas sees the pink floral panties lying tangled near his thigh.
“I was beginning to feel concerned I wasn’t making my intentions clear enough,” Cas confesses, “You seemed completely unaffected.”
Dying hurts, but there’s a relief to it too, like letting out an exhale you’ve been holding in for too long.
He studiously avoids looking up, not wanting to acknowledge that the last time he made eye contact with Cas resulted in him ploughing through someone’s front garden. However, after several long moments of increasingly loaded silence, he caves, giving in to temptation.
“Like this?” Cas is frowning, examining his work.
“It used to have peppermints in it,” Dean says, looking back to the road. There’s a wistful kind of sadness in his gaze, but a slight smile playing across his mouth. “Sammy begged Dad to buy it at some gas station when he was, I don’t know, maybe four. He didn’t even like peppermints, he just liked the Christmas tree on the front of the tin, wouldn’t shut up about it. It was filled with those red and white striped candy canes, you know the ones?”
you, Cas,” Dean says, because it’s wonderful to say it, better than breathing. “God, I love you.” He reaches up with his free hand and touches Cas’s jaw. Cas looks at him like he’s looking at everything in the whole universe all at once, and then they’re kissing and there's no fear, just wonder. Dizzying, pure elation. Like breathing after years underwater, like the feel of the sun on skin after a lifetime of night. Cas’s mouth is heat and oblivion. His hand grips Dean’s, both of them covering the space on his shoulder that once bore Cas’s angelic imprint. Dean can feel the warmth of their hands together, the heat of Cas’s skin over the space that has always been his.
“Have you tried apologizing?”
Shit, shit. Hit my spot, Alpha, please!
“You’re such a perverted old man.”
After screaming his lungs out, and surely waking up the neighborhood, Dean had come for the second time. The first, of course, had been with Cas’ tongue shoved inside his asshole, both of Cas’ thumbs hooked at the sides, aiding in his endeavor to lick and poke farther in.
so I just -I couldn’t risk getting mated or whatever, so no knotting. They were just quick fucks, I promise. They didn’t mean anything.”
Despite the wary look on his face, the man raked his glance over Castiel, giving him a hasty once-over. Whatever he saw he seemed to like enough to introduce himself.
Dean had
Turned out, a student needed help with their final essay. Mrs. Roberts had not gone through all the trouble if the kid wasn’t whoever they were. Which explained why she looked displeased with the arrangement. Surely, a rich daddy’s girl or some football player, the Alpha figured.
Dean was always so good for him, complying to his every whim.
Dean was no stranger to waking up to Cas’ ministrations, so Castiel wasn’t worried about his boyfriend rousing, but sometimes, just sometimes Cas wanted a twosome, and Dean’s ass was calling him hither, so very naughtily. Like a prostitute fishing for clients, the muscle tensed and relaxed, fluttered, aching to be taken care of.
“Touché.”
Still, teenagers talked, or rather gossiped, an awful deal. And it was difficult not to overhear about Dean's exploits when even the library fell prey to idle chit-chat from bored, sex-joneseing students.
“You walked up to me, and you s-started touching me. And I didn’t say nothing, Cas. I wanted you to touch me, I didn’t even- didn’t know who you were, but your hands felt real nice on m-my body. Fuck. I wanted you so bad, and you – Ah, ah, ah! Yes, yes, Cas, baby, do that again, fuck, do that again, please. Fuck, this. This! Wanted this, first day. Swear. Oh, god! Cas – in m’ dream, you, you grabbed my ass, right by the center. And the -the shorts were so tiny! And I- I was wet, like a girl, so wet. You moved ‘em a little to the side, and started f-fingering me, right there. People stared. And I- I didn’t, didn’t know you, Cas. I just wanted you in me, ‘lways do.”
Cas hummed, eyes shut, and pressed the side of his face against Dean’s muscular upper back.
His mouth, inconsiderate of Dean’s repose, decided to explore the smooth cavity, and soon enough Cas was suckling at the muscle without any finesse or rhythm. The squelching sounds filled the emptiness of their room, and Cas felt the head of his cock bobbing against the inside of his thigh. He also felt the body beneath his stirring, so he clutched at the skin harder, unwilling to let his prey escape. Next came the sharp gasp as Dean almost broke his neck turning his head back to look down at Castiel with the haze of sleep clouding his mind.
And not only did Dean smell ripe for the taking, but he was also extremely beautiful, with big forest-green eyes and strawberry-pink lips behind which a pearly smile flashed frequently. He was lean but not skinny, with supple skin, lithe limbs and freckles all over his face. In short, he was the picture of a beautiful and fertile young Omega, and many intelligent, decent Alphas in Truman dreamed of enriching their lineage with Dean’s good genes, a guarantee of outstanding offspring.
A loud bark pulled him from his reverie, and soon enough the gorgeous ass was out of sight, its owner turning around and taking a couple steps back.
Castiel’s head, fifty feet underwater, was having trouble keeping up with Dean’s unexpected confession. All he knew was that Dean was upset and it was his fault, so he needed to fix it. He needed to make his Omega happy again. Needed to see that cocky smile curving up his lips, to hear contented sighs as he aided in creating those dirty sounds that drove Dean’s Omega feral.
