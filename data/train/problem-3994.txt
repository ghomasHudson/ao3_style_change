“Dean…” Cas’s hand searched for him in the darkness of the room. Dean grabbed it and laid himself on him, spread over the angel. He still had his eyes closed; his skin was hot to the touch. “This was…”
Sam looked at Dean and smiled. “Dean. If you told me you
She reached out to him, pulling him closer and kissed him. She looked around, resolute. “One day.” They looked at each other, not understanding. “Wait one more day.” Sam traced to letters in her hand to Dean’s amazement.
He turned to face him.
“Yes, I’m afraid I can’t fully control my grace when I’m this…close to you.”
“I love you Dean” He said between two kisses, caressing the freckles on his cheek.
“No…I think Amara’s warding is strong.” Castiel looked at Jack “It’s about me…and Dean.” He looked up to the ceiling and back at Jack “Someday, I might want to be human with him. And I need to know, when this day come, will you make me human?”
“Maybe…go outside. With you.”
Cas chuckled “I love you too.”
An interesting lead coming from an ancient book in Germany gets really interesting but no one in the bunker or in the hunters’ network can even begin to translate it. As Jack is nowhere to be found, the boys call on their most trusted expert on old spell books: Rowena, queen of Hell.
He opened it with shaking hands.
Sam looked at Castiel who seemed very silent. “Cas I’m sorry I yelled at you.”
“Germany. But we have copies”
“Son of a bitch…sorry…” Dean calmed himself, wiping the sweat off his hands on his jeans.
“Cas? You alright?”
“Alright.” He sighed, resigned. “Alright… but you’re
He sighed and caressed his face. “Stay with me Cas.”
Dean turned around and picked it up, it weighed a ton. He secured it around his arms and chest and followed Eileen in the hallway, back to the library. Sam and Rowena were almost done with the plants.
“Where…where is he?” Dean asked in a raspy voice. He was still dizzy from dying.
“Oh no, these were better, these I
“But…you wouldn’t be an angel anymore.” Jack said saddened.
“No. I wanted…to talk to you about it first.” Castiel looked at him.
And Dean really didn’t know what he was going to do. He usually did his thinking driving baby around, he thought. And not a second after he thought about it, there she was… beautiful as ever. Like the first day he drove her after his dad gave her to him, all those years ago.
“I have to try Sammy.” Dean said, resolute. Sam could see that he was not going to let this go. He closed his eyes and sighed, rubbing his forehead with his hands.
“Because you can’t part here?”
Sam sighed and kept painting. “You’re really willing to die?”
When Cas came back, Dean was asleep, sheets bundled around his naked body. Castiel put the sandwiches on the table with the beer. His eyes roamed over Dean’s body, looking at every detail he had missed earlier, the freckles, the scars. He hesitated before deciding to wake him up. He gently caressed his shoulder, grazing past his waist. Dean moved slightly.
Dean grabbed his face and kissed him, hard. He pulled Cas’ hair and kissed his neck making the angel whimper his name. “You won’t hurt me, but I need you to want this Cas” his voice was just a breath on Castiel’s skin, making him shudder in pleasure.
“What’s wr-wrong with him? Why isn’t he waking up?”
“Thanks” Dean answered, getting himself a cup of hot coffee.
“Well, it’s a good thing we worked on the translation then!” Kaia turned her computer around, the screen facing Dean. He squinted his eyes to better see the words and began to read the chapters marked by the girls. His eyes were tired after a week spend on computers. Meanwhile, Sam was getting a copper bowl ready and some other instruments and ingredients to prepare his call. As Dean kept reading, he stopped at one paragraph in particular, he could see Claire looking intense next to him, raising her eyebrows.
Jack made his come-back after months of silence after Dean prayed to him on his birthday. Jack gifted him with the most unexpected of present: a feather of Castiel’s and a letter addressed to Dean. Though he still works hard on rebuilding Heaven, he still pops by to see Sam and Dean.
Some love and some drama this time 😏
warded.”
Dean was still trying to breathe normally as Castiel removed himself from him. Eyes closed in bliss. He cleaned them again, as usual. Dean glanced at the angel. He was awesome. He managed to rest his hand on the angel stomach and Castiel held his hand, gently stroking it with his thumb. They both smiled, impossible to let go of each other.
“I’m sorry I can’t be of more help.” Anja said apologetically.
Dean woke up screaming and thrashing, nails pressed against his palms.
C A N T
“I don’t know what to do Cas, I don’t know…” Dean shook his head, his hand on Cas’. And as they stood there, considering the possibilities they heard Sam’s voice raising in the infirmary. They both ran to it, feeling something was wrong.
The sun had set for… three hours now? Maybe five? Dean had completely lost track of time, he didn’t even put on his watch and had lost his phone somewhere in the bunker. He was drowned in books in the library, each with a cover stranger as the other, some he suspected were made of skin but he wasn’t sure of what…or who exactly. He did not want to think about it. He needed to stay focused. He kept on translating the pages on Sam’s computer. And the translations were getting him nowhere closer to an answer. But he couldn’t stop, not now. Not ever. He had promised himself. He would find a way.
“Those were the usual sandwiches I make you, Dean.”
Castiel is back at the bunker and spends his days and nights with Dean in the guest room. It had been warded to keep the Empty away from the angel.
“I’m sure you can. Be sure not to use your grace in the process or this will be useless.”
Castiel was pleasantly surprised, he didn’t think Dean would be this willing. He kissed his neck, gently sucking. He hit the same spot again and removed his fingers, making Dean lose his mind. He held his legs a bit higher, knees up.
“Maybe we can’t…” Sam said slowly. “But I know who can.” He got up with a smile and Dean almost had to run to keep up with his little brother. They passed other groups of hunters, numerous piles of books laying around, post-its coming out of them, they were moving fast.
“You don’t ha-“ Dean closed his eyes, it was useless, he was going to let him anyway. “It’s oka- humm” Cas had kept up the pace, gently squeezing and releasing Dean’s cock, analyzing Dean’s responses. Dean’s back arched and he gripped the angel tight. “Ca-as…”
“So, what did you… two find?” He leaned against his chair; the hot mug nestled in his hands.
have ‘intercourse’ here, you know.” he cleared his throat, his own cheeks getting flushed “The room
“It’s okay. I love it.” Dean whispered back. He had gotten drastically closer to Castiel. He could still inhale the mint and honey. But what he wanted to taste was something else entirely. His mouth found Cas’ without him thinking, sending butterflies flying in his stomach. Cas kissed him back, barely grazing Dean’s neck. In this moment Dean realised he had never been like that with anyone. True, relaxed, whole. Cas made him complete. He didn’t know how to tell him, he didn’t know how to show him yet… but he felt for certain that Cas was
Dean was calm again and after repeating that ‘No I swear I’m not going to cry again’ several times to Cas, the angel started getting up. “Get some rest now, I’ll make you a sandwich”.
made him realised, he was worth caring for. And he needed to save
Sam couldn’t look anywhere else than on Eileen. He watched as her chest went up and down, breathing. He had kept her hand in his, in case she woke up. They had managed to stich her stomach, thanks to Castiel. He had put her on a deep sleep where she couldn’t feel any pain. That’s where the beast had grabbed her with its claws, almost gutting her. She had look in its eyes, blinding her on the spot.
Dean could work with that. This was one more lead, one step closer. “That’s… great. Thank you, Garth.” he said, truly thankful for his friend.
“Yeah, Sam. I’m not stupid. It’s not that!” He kept on hitting the keyboard, hopelessly.
Jack was surrounded by blackness and emptiness. He closed his eyes and recited the Enochian prayer that Rowena had him learn by heart. The prayer to find Castiel inside the Empty. When he opened his eyes again, he found a dot in the distance that stood out from all the rest. Castiel. He ran towards him as fast as he could. He could see his trench coat in the distance. His powers were subdued here. But he could still run. Even subdued, he was still strong enough.
“Yeah, come in” he said, putting the photograph on the nightstand, rubbing his eyes in exhaustion.
“I only need blood now” Sam said, cutting his hand, letting the droplets of blood fall into the bowl.
“How loving someone can be wrong?” Cas asked softly. “How can
“Did you sleep well?” Castiel asked.
“Mmmphf…thanks Sammy.” Was all Dean could muster to satisfy his brother. He didn’t want to celebrate and this was definitely not a happy birthday as far as he was concerned. Sam poured himself a cup and sat facing his brother.
Dean waved his hand in the air, coughing and squinting his eyes while Castiel was totally unbothered by the smoke. The amulet in his hand started glowing and then shone brightly, illuminating the room. They looked around the room, searching.
When Dean woke up this morning, he was peaceful. For a moment he was confusedly warm, then he realised he was still nestled close to Castiel. The angel was not asleep, of course. Dean moved his drowsy body, trying to slowly wake up. He was feeling fine today, compared to the earlier days. That was a good sign concerning his recovery. Castiel turned his head towards Dean’s, smiling tenderly. His arms brushed against his body. Dean didn’t want to move.

“Cas?” He called before the angel left the room. He looked back at Dean, waiting. “You know I love you, right?” He grinned.
” Cas rolled his eyes. “It’s about me.”
He decided that he will drive baby as far as he could, as long as he could.
“You’re here, great.”
“Dean. I already asked Jack. It’s something I want.” He gestured at them and the pie “I want to experience everything with you, and as an angel, I simply can’t.”
“I can’t lose her.” His eyes were pleading.
Dean looked at him without saying a word. If Cas said those words, he could believe it. No one had said those words to him before, not like that.
Dean went out to walk Miracle for a bit, some other hunters had already walked her around the bunker but it was nice to get out, even for a quarter of an hour. When he came back everyone was caffeinated and books were piling up. He grabbed a coffee and headed for the study room, where Jody and Donna were working on books and translations.
“It’s okay Dean, I wasn’t the biggest priority these past few days.”
Castiel followed the instruction pressing the dough tightly in the pie pan. He added the sliced-up apples and the caramel syrup he made earlier, closing the pie with the rest of the dough, leaving place for the steam to escape from. The woman in the video said it was very important. It wasn’t perfect but it looked good enough.
“Yes. Yes. Very much so.” He opened his eyes, they were glowing. “Sorry for the lights. I’ll fix them.” And just like that, the lights were back up.
“Hi Dean.”
He was there. On the bed.
Sam had barely been waiting since he took the time to shower first. He was waiting in the kitchen, hair still wet, opening the beers as Dean walked in. Miracle was lying on the floor, wagging her tail. Sam handed one beer to his brother and went to clink the bottles together.
Dean tapped his fingers on his arms, looking at him intensely. “Okay.” He inhaled. “Then you should do it.” He nodded “We bring her to your room and you save her.”
“Charlie. I’m wishing her good luck.”
“Let me do it. I’ll show you Cas...” Dean breathed against the angel’s neck, making Cas curl his fingers over Dean’s hair. “…just how much I love you.” He slid his hands underneath the overshirt, stripping the angel off, his lips still sealed on Cas’. He continued with his shirt, tugging at it and getting rid of it further away in the room, parting with the angel lips only to catch his breath. He grabbed Castiel’s hands, holding them on the wall, and started kissing him tenderly on the mouth, then moved to his neck and collarbone. Castiel moaned and breathed loudly, as he intertwined his fingers with Dean’s. Dean licked and pulled on Cas’ soft skin, kissing his nipples, one at the time. Castiel gasped, amazed again. Dean kept going lower, taking off his hands of Cas and working on his jeans and belt. Cas’ hands were on his arms.
“No Cas! You listen to me now. I won’t lose you again.” Dean’s chest was aching, “I can’t.” He breathed.
Dean and Cas were still in the library, books piled all over and tabs open by dozens on the computers. All of that added up to nothing more than what they already knew.
Dean shook his head “No. I have nothing for Eileen and what you did…it should have worked.”
like it was?
Sam had moved and stood behind them, they were all looking at the computer, analysing the screen, trying to recognize…something.
“Yeah? Do you have backup?”
“Dean. If I go to Heaven, I won’t be here all the time, with you. Maybe for days, or weeks, maybe even longer. Time is not the same in Heaven.”
Dean cleaned his mouth with a napkin and continued “Even…Even when I’m old and all wrinkly?”
“You know I have to do it.”
It was so beautiful. Dark blue, almost black. Shining like ebony on the edges. Shimmering with colours when facing the afternoon sun. Orange and pink, blue and green, purple, melting away together in the sunlight.
“Hello!” Jack was always smiling when he saw Castiel. He sat next to him. “Castiel, I need to ask you something…”
“Cas…” Dean said once he was calm enough. “Cas this was amazing.”
“What...” They heard a confused voice in the corner of the room. “Castiel?”
A Miniwashitu, that’s what had attacked Eileen. And they couldn’t even kill it now because it only appeared once a year. So, Dean looked for a way to reverse the blindness it had inflicted on her.
, he had to be. He had never felt like this with someone in his whole life. And Cas had been part of it for the longest of time.
“You slept nine hours; I never saw you slept this long before.”
She smiled weakly, she was exhausted from hallucinations and the lack of sleep. Jack put his hand on her forehead, closing his eyes in concentration. His irises where bright golden when he opened them, power radiating from his hands. Eileen’ eyes fluttered, she looked around the room and focused finally. She touched her stomach, running her hand under her shirt, grinning. She reached for Jack, holding his face.
“Thanks again, man” Sam ended the videocall.
“I know they are. That’s why I’m rebuilding Heaven. When the time comes, I want all of us together.”
“I asked Castiel to help me rebuild Heaven but he told me he should stay here, with you.” Jack answered honestly, making Castiel turn his head and Dean raise his eyebrows even higher.
“It’s beautiful.” Castiel stated. And Dean thought he was talking about the lake but Castiel was looking at Dean. “Your eyes in the sun, they’re beautiful.”
“You passed out!” Sam repeated, angry “I told you to get some rest and you passed out!” He tried to compose himself, exhaling. “I got back with Eileen to Cas’ room with the armchair, next think I know you’re on the floor and Cas’s screaming to wake you up.”
“Hmm…maybe.”
“I think it’s working.”
“I’m sorry did I say something funny?” Cas was confused again.
Dean couldn’t help but chuckled “You’re strong Claire. Maybe I will come.” He sighed. She got up and pulled something out of her pocket. It was a paper, a little wrinkly.
“It’s almost time.”
“Yeah, it must be around 4pm or something in Germany… I can probably get a hold of her now.” Sam nodded, and tapped Dean’s shoulder. “Move, I need to use the computer.” Dean moved without protesting, and went to look for another chair. He was hopeful, he didn’t want to be disappointed but, he felt like this could change things. This was the most intriguing lead they had. The book was so old. There must be something, somewhere in it, that could potentially help him get Cas back. He came back, a wooden chair in hand. He sat between Sam and Eileen, the back of the chair to his chest, his legs stretched on either side. Sam was calling Anja on some videocall software Dean didn’t recognise. After some time, the “please wait” screen was replaced with the face of a fifty-something blonde woman.
“No, it’s crap.” Dean answered. “But it was fantastic”.
“Dean…” Castiel had a hard time to focus “I don’t want to ruin the pie. I need to keep an eye on it.”
Dean’s heart raced, he wanted to tell him how he felt, so much. But he couldn’t. He didn’t know why. He wanted to but he…couldn’t. He was afraid of something intangible, something eating at him. He loved him, he was afraid of losing him, he wanted him like he never wanted anyone, so much it hurt. He didn’t think he deserved the angel’s love. He was terrified.
“Do you know if she’s had any delirious thoughts?”
but we were waiting on you before sharing it with the others.” She smiled at him.
He was here. Castiel.
“Hello.” Jack had materialised in front of them, waving his hand in the air. Dean was jumpy but also very relieved by his presence.
Dean had been so stupid. He thought that the book would solve everything. He had allowed himself a sliver of hope and got nothing but frustration. When Sam told him Rowena had cracked it, this was it, he had thought, he had found a way. But it had turned out horribly wrong. They had found a spell alright. And he had mistakenly thought this would have been the hardest part. How wrong he had been… finding the spell was not the hardest part. Because they couldn’t perform it at all, it turned out. The ingredients required to perform it were very hard to come by, and some…impossible even.
“He’s better now. He’s stronger. And you’ll be safe.”
“Sammy.” Dean added, “I
This time, Castiel kissed him first, holding Dean close to him. He pushed Dean onto the table next to them, pushing his legs apart, making the hunter moan. “Do you want me Dean?” he said in a raspy voice against his neck.
She rolled her eyes “It’s not a definite no at least, I’ll take it.” She smiled, gently punching him. “Now, let’s get to coffee making, we’ve got people who need the fuel!”
“Sam. I’m going to heal Eileen.” Castiel had spoken very clearly.
“You need more sleep” Cas rolled his eyes and Dean looked at him, amused. Castiel had brought a pot of coffee on the table, hot and ready to pour.
Charlie waited, resting against the kitchen’s wall.
“Oh…me of course, and Amara.”
When he had asked some of them why they were here, some answered that they kind of owed it to him for finding a way to bring them back after Chuck made them all disappeared. Some others just wanted to help, others were here for the challenge and the thrill of discovering the bunker. It was a hunters’ lair after all. For different reasons, absolutely all of them wanted to find a way to bring Cas back. They were all determined and it gave Dean a new hope. Sam smiled the entire night, very glad with himself. “It was my idea, but Eileen procured the logistics, she got the word around and… here we are.” He had said to Dean while everyone was chatting in the war room.  “Thank you.” was all Dean could say to his brother. Everyone chose a room somewhere in the bunker and it seemed for an instant that the brothers were just throwing the biggest slumber party ever.
“I can’t let her die. Not like this, not knowing we couldn’t have saved her.”
“Dean! You made it here!” She said, getting up and gesturing towards a shelf behind her. “Look at
Dean went straight to his bedroom and opened a compartment in his desk, grabbing a bottle of bourbon. He drank it straight from the bottle, he wanted to forget, the ache, the words, still echoing in his head. Every damn minute. Second.
“Of course, I’ve got some other pictures that are a lot more embarrassing, but I’m keeping those for myself.” She winked.
Dean hugged Sam and left the room, feeling like a weight had been lifted off him. Charlie was right. Sam was the one who knew him best. He was tired and headed for his room. Instead of finding Miracle lying in the bed alone, he found Miracle and Claire waiting by her side.
“No…Maybe some really powerful witch? Maybe Jack could work his powers on it?”
He dialled Sam’s number to check on his brother, ‘a call is still better than a text’ he thought.
“I can bring you an armchair if you want, you’ll be more comfortable.” He offered.
“What’s my purpose if I can’t save her? I feel useless.”
“You…never mind. Don’t read my mind!” Dean said reproachful.
“Dean I…” he barely even spoke “Yes.” he could feel Dean’s breath on him, mere inches apart.
“I don’t know…” Dean held him tight “I feel stupid. We could have enjoyed it more, but I was stupid.”
“Do you have news?”
Dean ran a hand on his face, sighing. He didn’t know what else to do. He had called on Bobby but he didn’t know either, no one in the hunter’s network knew what to do. And time was running out, fast. There was only one thing left to do.
“Thanks Sammy, they’re in the bottom drawer of my night stand.”
“Yes… He’s all alone, Dean. And the angels… they might not be all be on his side.” Cas frowned in concern “I’m worried for him.”
He nodded “Not of you.” He brushed the angel’s cheek.
“You’re welcome. I have to go now.” She smiled and vanished.
“Cas, if you’re not on board with it, we can wait. I don’t care about that; I just want you here with me.” Dean came even closer, touching the angel’s arm and gently caressing it. Cas grabbed Dean’s hand on his arm, holding onto him.
“Yeah, well… I guess you never forget you first nest case.” Dean simply replied, cleaning off the vamp’s blood on a dirty rag that was laying in the barn. He handed the rug to Sam and put the machete back into its sheath. He walked over the impaled vampire and stopped, looking at the body hanging from the rebar, its head laying inert on the ground a few steps further.
“She’s asleep. She had more hallucinations earlier.”
“But…Jack?” He had come up with the same conclusion as Castiel.
“Hey, baby” he said to his old friend as he turned the contact on.
Dean was getting some coffee in the kitchen and couldn’t believe he had slept this long. He sat down at the table, looking at his texts and calls to check if Sam or Eileen needed something. He got nothing except the daily text from Sam, saying there was no problem. He put on the radio and sipped his coffee.
“But your grace, your wings…” he whispered
Dean got up and walked over to the Impala, smiling.
Dean snorted. “Right. That’s me right there.” He rubbed his hands on his jeans, trying to warm himself, he’d been there for too long and his fingers were becoming numb. “I just wish we could make Jack appear to help us, y’know?” He sighed, reaching for Cas’ warm hand to hold.
“Dean, you should sleep too, you’re not well.”
“Good. Now we need to do the room.” Dean added, looking at Eileen.
make up jokes then!” And Cas laughed. Dean passed a hand on his cheek, melting inside. “I love you.” It had been so easy, saying it to him these past few days. His fears started to vanish. His angel was not going anywhere.
“Hi Dean. I’m glad to see you in the flesh.” Amara smiled back “You too Castiel. I was very sorry to hear about your demise.”
“Why not? Cas looked like my father Dean. I wanted to remember him too.” She held onto his hand for a moment, gently squeezing. “He was important to me too.” He looked at her and even though he knew she was not Cas’ daughter; he could see a little of his strength behind her blue eyes. She left soon after, leaving Dean and Miracle to gaze at the photograph, now the most precious object in Dean’s possession.
“You’re not getting out?” Sam asked.
Jack appeared in the kitchen, dressed in white and blue.
“You’re important Dean. You’re important to me.” He said, stroking Dean’s face. Still breathing hard.
He was left alone with the angel and his worry. He sat in Jack’s chair, because it was closer to the angel. Castiel looked so peaceful. Dean pushed some of Cas’ hair aside to better see his face. He reached out and held his hand. Warm and soft.
“As well as can be expected. He’s not leaving her side.” Castiel continued “Give me the book, you look on the computer.” and slid the computer across the table.
“Well, what it says Dean, of course. We need a part of Castiel. Without it, you will never find him in the Empty.” she answered.
“No…not as far as I can tell.”
Dean helped Castiel onto the bed, making him sigh heavily.
The words echoed in his head.
Dean was scared of going too fast or saying the wrong thing, Cas was scared for Dean and his health, scared of hurting him. In result, they had been very cautious with each other during the week. Cautious but loving.
“Anywhere with you would be nice. I already love it here.”
“Hello!” Jack appeared in front of him, making Dean jump and spill coffee on his shirt.
closing another chapter in his dad’s journal? Nothing really. Well, some things, but he couldn’t think about that for now.
“He’s alright. How could he not be with a father like you?” Dean brushed Castiel’s face, making the angel melt at the sight of his soft green eyes.
“For what?” Dean asked, incredulous. “You did nothing wrong.”
“Hmmm…yes, yes.” Dean’s eyes were closed, the pain of Castiel being out of him starting to be too great for him “Cas... I’m yours”.
“No, I’m sorry.” Jack looked at Castiel, trying to find something positive “but I fixed your wings, you can fly.”
“I could give you advice if you want. I want to help you.”
“I know, I know.” Dean patted his shoulder again. “Listen…I found a letter in-“
“No Cas. She wouldn’t want you to.” Sam shook his head. “She cares about you too; she wouldn’t want to put you in danger.” He drank his coffee, sighing.
“What?” Dean was confused.
Castiel put the pie gently in the oven, setting a timer and always keeping an eye on it to check if it wasn’t burning. After some time, he looked at the time on his phone… Dean had been gone for more than two hours. Maybe something had happened? But Castiel thought about how he really enjoyed his walks with Miracle, he was always revigorated after them. And as he looked at the recipe one last time, he heard footsteps in the corridor coming up to the kitchen, settling his worries.
“Eileen!” Sam had both his hands on her shoulders, trying to restrain her. She was convulsing on the bed, menacing to fall from it and hurt herself, or worse. Dean and Castiel held her body still, pushing on her legs. Finally, she stopped thrashing and opened her eyes, looking aimlessly in the room. The boys let go of her and Sam put one if his hand in hers, she held onto him, slowly calming down as he traced letters in her hand. Dean looked at Cas, asking him silently to do something.
“I…just did. We did.” She paused, getting closer to him, a hand on his. “Dean… you know when it’s the right person. You know… when you decide to be loved. When… you’re willing to accept it. That’s when you know.”
“Thought she’d had better taste” Bobby added, as if reading his mind.
“A colour code? Seriously?” Dean chuckled. He was amazed at their efficiency; he could never be this organised. Except maybe when cleaning guns and fixing Baby.
Dean took his hands off, waving them in the air as if to say he was innocent. “Alright!” He grinned and his eyes smiled with him, making Castiel pause to look at him, Dean grinning in happiness was an alluring sight. Dean grabbed him by the waist and kissed him. “This…I can really get used to.” Castiel kissed him back, smiling. “I’m sorry I doubted your culinary abilities.” He started kissing his neck “Humm…you smell like cinnamon.”
“No, of course not,” Cas agrees. “And you’re already on your knees. Ask me.”
Sam bends down next to Cas and holds his own hand out to the friendly cat. Immediately, a low growl starts in its throat, its ears pressed back against its head. “How come they like you?” Sam says, put out, and stands back up. As soon as Sam has stood up and stepped away, the cat draws closer again.
“That’s…probably a longer story than we have time for, but the short version?” Sam stops walking and turns to Dean. “You went to hell. It was to save me and…we tried to stop it. Tried everything to—to keep you from going, but…”
“I have work to do,” Cas says more seriously. “But I...” He hesitates and his eyes flick to the side. Dean’s beginning to learn it’s a tell for when he’s nervous. “I wouldn’t mind...
The more Cas mulls it over, Jack’s deal with the Empty to get Cas out seems too good to be true and while Sam, Dean, and Jack may not want to look that gift horse in the mouth, Cas is beginning to understand the repercussions of exchanging his grace for his freedom.
“Cas, I can’t be…the person you think I am. And if this—the not eating, the not sleeping, the disappearing for days at a time to be alone and not talk to anyone—if that’s because of
Cas’s mouth is on Dean’s again. Cas slips his tongue against Dean’s and Dean pulls Cas even closer.
A few months after Cas’s return, something starts to change. At first, Cas wonders if this is an inevitable numbing to the vivacity of the human experience. Surely humans don’t feel so strongly all the time, so if he doesn’t feel quite as warm when he sees Sam laugh at one of Dean’s horrible jokes, or if his worry isn’t as sharp when they get a call from Eileen in the middle of a hunt, Cas takes it in stride.
Cas hesitates, chewing on the first word that comes to mind, which is
“Yes, of course,” Cas replies, characteristically serious.
Dean clears his throat again and places the book back on the bed. “So, listen, Cas. I wanted to—well, Sam said I should...” Dean drags a hand down his face and looks at Cas. “All right,” he says, coming to a decision. “I’m just gonna come out and say it.” He moves to sit on the edge of the bed but stops himself before he hits the mattress. “Shit.” He touches his bloody shirt again and then says, “Should get changed first. Let me...” He holds up a finger and Cas watches silently as he hurries out of the room.
Dean pulls one leg up so he’s down on one knee, the proper stance if he’s going to do this. Which, holy shit, he thinks he’s going to do this.
“Are you afraid?” Cas asks, concern suddenly coloring his features. His eyes dart down and away, looking for an answer. “I apologize if I—“
“I suppose I never considered it,” Cas is saying, his voice low but carrying in the quiet of the room. “There isn’t much that’s traditional about what we are.”
before, but his memory is sluggish and fails to produce the desired information.
“Hope you don’t mind,” Sam replies lightly as he thumbs through the instructions. “Standing for too long is...” He trails off as if distracted, but there’s something slightly off about what he’s saying. Not just because the Winchesters rarely ask for help with anything, but Sam seems especially eager about this particular project. Cas wonders if it’s strange for Sam to be focused on something so unimportant when earlier he’d been so adamant on finding Cas’s miracle cure.
It’s a scrawny, wiggly thing with dark salt and pepper fur, little white socks and a white belly and chest. Since Cas brought it into the bathroom with a towel, a cardboard box with torn up newspaper for litter, and a water and food bowl, the kitten has come to accept the two humans as friendly. It had scarfed down the proffered canned tuna like it hadn’t ever eaten, purring like a motor the entire time, and now it determinedly hunts Cas’s fingers as he wiggles them in and out of reach of its sharp claws.
Cas furrows his brow and turns his body to better see Sam in the dim glow of the string lights. “My symptoms?”
Dean groans and drops his head against his arm.
“Yeah. I, um, genuinely know what that feels like. And I just want you to know that we’re gonna do everything we can to figure this out.”
noticeable. Unfortunately, it only seems to grow in intensity each day. He doesn’t think glasses are going to cure him of it, as sure as Dean is that they will.
“Oh,” Dean says, perfectly and deadly serious. “It’s necessary.”
The reference goes over his head, but Cas looks down at himself. His clothes have been baggier as of late, but it only registered as a slight annoyance and he never thought to wonder; he doesn’t spend much time in front of mirrors. But as he smooths a hand down his side, he can feel every rib slot between his fingers.
The landscape is fairly barren given the harsh midwest winters, but low-growing scrub brush dots the field. In the distance, perhaps two hundred yards ahead of them, little pinpricks of light shine. Cas tries to count them in pairs, but they move, disappear, and reappear too often to get a proper gauge. There are, Cas estimates, at least a dozen.
Dean clenches his jaw in surprise and sits back in the booth (when did he lean forward?) “Adequate,” he repeats.
“I only got one,” Cas realizes. “I can go—“
He releases Cas’s wrist when they get to the car and Cas obediently climbs into the passenger seat while Dean slides into the driver’s side. He fishes the keys out of his jeans pocket and turns the car on, relishing the familiar rumble as the engine catches.
tasted a french fry?”
“That’s categorically untrue. For both of us. And Jack, for that matter.”
The kitten makes a valiant jump from Cas’s knee to the floor, rolling onto its back with its legs kicking as it desperately reaches for Cas’s fingers. Cas scritches its rotund belly and the kitten clasps all four paws around his hand and little teeth bite down playfully.
the same, but then why are they called different names? One is “organic” and the other is “all natural” and Cas has no idea what either actually means. All the while, his head pounds, the pain growing sharper and more pronounced as he glares at the bright font on the boxes.
“More cats?”
A strange, sharp sound pierces the air and Sam stops short. He and Cas exchange a look. Cas stands and strides toward where he heard the sound, somewhere below them, off toward the east. Sam hobbles over and they pause, waiting for the sound again.
you notice. It’s the way Cas holds himself, his posture, and his hands at his sides that move more naturally where before he had the stature and countenance of a toy soldier. It’s like he’s finally
Dean frowns and shakes his head. “I don’t understand.”
“Marry me,” Cas says.
Dean hums thoughtfully. “No, I guess not. And I wonder—" Dean shakes his head and stares down at his plate, brow furrowed.
feel that, so I…miss the feeling of feeling.” Cas huffs out a laugh and it fogs the air around him. “Beyond feeling, however, there is also a lack of appetite, a lack of sleep, a lack of desire to maintain this…body.” He gestures vaguely to himself. “Because none of that matters.” He glances at Sam who is staring at him with a pained expression. Cas sighs and lets his chin drop to his chest. He rubs his eyes and says, “I wouldn’t worry about me, Sam. I know that every case of soullessness is different, but we can at least be confident that I am not homicidal.”
“I think we can both agree we know what being soulless entails. Dean, I am not postulating. This is…the reality of the situation.”
Much closer.
His fingers hesitate over the plastic spines with his father’s black, familiar scrawl cast underneath. Dean has favorites, of course, but this is Cas’s first song he’ll truly hear like a human and suddenly that feels like a very big deal.
“Okay, well, according to this, it looks like it’s maybe six or seven weeks old, but they say malnutrition could make it seem smaller than it is. So maybe eight weeks? It kinda looks like this picture.” Sam turns his phone around and Cas glances over at it from where he sits cross-legged on the hallway bathroom’s floor. There’s a chart that shows weekly photos of kittens from newborn to 8 weeks. Cas looks at their own kitten again to compare.
“One way to find out.” Sam starts walking.
, the way his voice is deeper and raspier than usual and Dean can feel Cas’s voice vibrate in his own chest.
“Yeah, man! If you thought fries were good, that’s small potatoes.” Dean finds great joy in the frown that pulls at Cas’s mouth at his incredibly good use of wordplay. “Pie, for one. Apple, specifically and—hey, you got wings! You fly to Mama Janie's Diner in Waverly, Kansas and—“
Cas raises an eyebrow at Dean. “You have the ‘magical credit card’.” Cas makes air quotes, mostly because it always makes Dean smile.
Cas leans into Dean’s palm. His hands withdraw from Dean’s neck and chest, leaving a coldness behind that isn’t just physical. Dean aches to be closer to Cas, but before he can make a move, Cas takes Dean’s hand in both of his, turns his head, and kisses his palm. It’s a soft and reverent kiss, and it catches Dean completely off-guard. He’s not sure why this small moment of affection is what pushes him over the edge, but he can sense the moment the dam breaks inside of him. He’s flooded with an unforgiving and unrelenting understanding that this being, this
“Ask me,” he repeats and Dean can see the mirth in his eyes. The little shit loves seeing Dean squirm, but two can play at that game.
Cas huffs out a small laugh.
Cas side-eyes Dean and sees the red creeping up his neck to his face as he stumbles over his words. Then Dean turns and gives Cas a lopsided smile in earnest.
Cas raises his eyebrows, feigning surprise. “I’m fine,” he says and he hopes he sounds sincere.
“What’d we miss?”
“Yeah, well, someone’s gotta be the optimist here.”
, which has no lords or flies so far. Humanity’s love of metaphor never ceases to amuse him, even in spite of its constant muddying of Cas’s understanding of various media.
my grace in its entirety.”
“I should go,” Cas says quietly.
Sam clears his throat and Cas is about to excuse himself when Sam says, “And, hey, look. If you ever wanna...talk about it. Or anything. I’m here.”
“It’s short,” Dean adds with a smile and a knowing look sent Cas’s way.
They walk in silence, just the crunch of gravel sounding as they make their way across the parking lot. Dean beelines toward the rotting wooden picnic table stuck in a small grassy patch adjacent to the main office of the motel.
It’s not a question. But Cas has this little quirk of a smile on his face that has Dean’s heart pounding in his ears.
Sam steps back in surprise, eyebrows raised and eyes wide. “Cas!”
“Yeah, your grace.”
“Hello, Sam,” Cas says. Cas's tone is calm and light even though he’s currently straddling Dean and looking decidedly ruffled, clothes askew and hair on all ends.
It reminds Cas of Jack, which he recognizes as both pathetic and painful in equal measure. Jack’s mission is critical and his responsibilities endless and heavy beyond reckoning, so Cas would never voice his disappointment in his son’s absence from his life. But knowing why Jack spends so much time away and accepting it are two very different things. Still, Cas will keep his thoughts to himself if only because he knows Jack. As earnest and as desperate to please as he is, Jack would almost certainly take it upon himself to spend more time with Cas, which may pull him from those duties that are far more important. Certainly more important than any personal feelings Cas has about his son’s whereabouts. He is God, after all. What is the plight of one ex-angel against the weight of the entire universe?
“Would you like to get married?”
Dean goes to lean up, but Cas holds him back with a hand to his chest. “Dean, you think very loudly.”
Cas moved Thomas from the bathroom to his bedroom the previous night. The kitten very suddenly came down with what can only be described as separation anxiety, the symptoms of which included yowling all through the night when left alone. Cas is secretly grateful because sitting on the hard tile of the bathroom had been hurting his back more than he thought was reasonable. Thomas took to his new living quarters right away, locating the cushy desk chair and claiming it as a prime napping spot.
Cas’s eyes flick over to Dean, expression unreadable. “Crash course,” he repeats.
It doesn’t come.
Cas, on the other hand, likes to take his time. It drives Dean up the wall, even though Cas has explained any number of times that Dean has had decades to figure out which foods and supplies he likes best, while Cas is just starting. It doesn’t help that humans have created seemingly thousands of brands of the same items with little to no discernable difference between them.
When Cas doesn’t reply, Dean clears his throat and says, “So, uh, what’re you reading?”
“Mountain lion?” Cas speculates.
Dean wonders what comes next. It’s not like he can ask the guy to go steady with him, ask him to the prom, invite him over to meet his parents. Hell, even if Dean were the kind of person who dated, he’s not sure he’d ever get up the courage to ask; it's something that would leave him so vulnerable. It’s just not his style, he decides. Love ‘em and leave ‘em. Except...
“Try these,” Dean says.
“Well, Dean, you tell me. Was Sam lying?”
a romantic. Gross.
“Speaking of, Sam’s worried about you.” Dean says it lightly and takes another sip of beer, playing casual, but his lack of eye contact betrays his anxiety.
Dean’s hand drops to his side, his mouth agape. “For…me? What— Why? Am I that important?”
“Thank you.” Cas hopes his appreciation is seen as sincere enough to allow his escape without further questioning.
“That was a very bad joke,” Cas remarks. His eyes are lit up and more alive than Dean has ever seen them.
“Oh, fuck no. That’s definitely Sam’s job. I’m a realist.”
It’s true that the nuances of human affection and relationships escape Cas. His first attempts at showing Dean his feelings, as convoluted as they were, were faulty if well-intentioned.
Cas hums around the spoon in his mouth as it delivers a second bite. His brow is furrowed in concentration which is just downright precious. “It is hard to describe,” he says. “Apple and cinnamon and sugar and...something else.”
Cas goes to the bag and sees what it is based on the image emblazoned on the front. “A gazebo?” Cas asks.
about it since he doesn’t want to bother you, so any help you can give me here would be much appreciated.” At that, he slides his plate toward Cas. The burger is only half-eaten and the fries are uncharacteristically present. “You can start by putting on some weight. You’re giving me serious
Cas smiles at the kitten. “I like it.”
“You were the one who offered to join me,” Cas reminds him.
Dean plucks a cassette out of the box. Cas takes the box of tapes from Dean when he hands it over and pushes it back under the seat. Dean pushes the tape into the tape deck and presses the fast forward button. Dean’s sure there’s something to be said about the fact that he can almost perfectly time when to stop the winding tape.
“Dean called Marco and Ophelia from the Newport chapter house and they agreed to let him peruse their library for relevant books and stuff. Eileen is headed to the Missoula chapter house. And we’ve still got quite a bit to go through in the archives here that needs cataloging.” He meets Cas’s gaze with such confidence, Cas is almost moved by it. Sam puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder and squeezes. “We’ll get you right, man. Promise.”
“But never say never,” Dean agrees. “Well, hey, if you wanna work this like a case, I don’t mind tagging along. This could be the easiest, most low-stakes case I’ll ever see. With the bonus that it’s a five-minute drive from home.” Dean knocks Cas’s shoulder with his fist and says, “C’mon, we got groceries to put away.”
“Can’t tell from this far away,” Sam replies in a low voice. “But they’re too low to the ground to be coyotes. Could be rabbits, but they don’t usually hang out in groups like that.”
grateful. He would sacrifice his grace tenfold if it meant seeing that look of pure relief and love on Jack’s face again and to have Sam and Dean back in his life.
Cas breaks the kiss first and Dean whimpers at the loss of contact, because he’s pathetic and needy. He also doesn’t super care at this moment, and pulls Cas in again by his jacket (when had he clutched his jacket?) Cas relents, but only briefly before he pulls back again.
In spite of Cas’s strong grip on its scruff, the creature still reaches out wildly with its claws, swiping the air in fury and letting out hisses and high-pitched yowls. Its back legs kick up to try and remove Cas’s hand, leaving him with a few good stinging scratches. The thing is hardly bigger than his hand and yet it has so much will, Cas can’t help but huff out an amused laugh.
“Fuck, dude!” Dean says and before he thinks twice about it, he grabs Cas’s wrist and pulls him up from the table, leading him to the Impala. Cas comes without a fight and Dean doesn’t dwell on what it means that this millions-year-old celestial being is allowing Dean Winchester to manhandle him in a motel parking lot.
This time, he feels…empty. He rolls the irony of the word around in his mind. Listless, hopeless. Empty.
of my grace. I was not made with a human soul. I have…nothing.” Cas opens his hands and then lets them fall closed.
“Yes,” Cas replies. “We have a trespasser.”
of it are one and the same. A fallen angel who chooses to fall, like his sister Anna once did, is reborn with their own body and their own soul. A shortcut, Cas thinks, that God designed with the knowledge that some of his first creations may envy humanity to the point of descent. Grace removed, such as Metatron did those many years ago, leaves a trace behind like a homing beacon, the same remnant found in any angel’s vessel after their inhabitant’s departure. It was how Cas could sense his own grace back in that library and hear Claire’s prayers so many years ago.
“For...”
Dean snorts a laugh. “Yeah, well, he’s bothering
But Cas hasn’t moved his hand and he hasn’t pulled his eyes off Dean. Dean finally returns Cas’s gaze. “I like it,” Cas says. His voice is remarkably light, considering Dean feels like he’s drowning right now.
Dean returns wearing a clean white shirt and dark gray sweatpants. “Sorry,” he says and strolls right over to sit on the bed. He places his hands on his knees and pointedly looks everywhere except at Cas.
As a roommate, Sam is incredibly considerate. While it’s true that their private interactions up to this point have largely revolved around Dean: helping him, saving him, and ensuring his oft-suicidal missions aren’t successful, Cas will admit he’s always had an appreciation for Sam’s softer, more sincere temperament when compared to his brother’s. Dean is often so tightly wrapped in his own emotional restraints that Cas doesn’t know where he stands, how to act, or what to say.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“If you’re jealous, you can just say so,” Dean says and takes a too-large bite. He grins childishly and Cas can’t help but smile a little, even as he shakes his head in disapproval.
Dean’s not sure how he always gets saddled with popcorn duty, although he’ll be the first to admit this time he’s not too bothered by it. Sam had picked out
and watch
Secondly, posting schedule should be Tuesdays and Thursdays from now on. Everything has been written, there's just minor editing that has to be done. If there are any minor content warnings for each chapter, I'll be sure to post them in the chapter notes at the end and let you know at the beginning, but honestly this fic is largely introspective and also sometimes there are cats. Enjoy.
“What are they?”
Once he makes it to where he approximates the sound came from, he looks up. He can just see the silhouette of Sam’s upper body from above and Sam shakes his head no to indicate he hasn’t heard anything else.
Dean shoots a look at Cas and says, “Why? What’s up?” But he doesn’t wait for an explanation before easing into a spot by the curb. As soon as the Impala stops, Cas gets out and heads toward the post office, just a building back the way they came.
has other motives,” Cas says pointedly and rub’s the kitten’s head until he begins to purr, eyes slipping closed.
“I lied to you,” Cas continues, ignoring Dean’s jibe. “About the fries.”
Sam sees his chance and he takes it. “And, you know, there’re other monsters, too. Like, uh, sirens.”
“All I mean is that angels don’t experience stimuli in the same way. We don’t...” Cas pauses and glances at the ceiling as if searching for the right words there. “We just know the essence of all things, all at once. Human senses are so rudimentary—molecular—in comparison.”
They’re of all different sizes and levels of scruffy. A large, white cat—the one Cas thinks he spotted earlier—looks particularly rough, both ears cauliflowered, its face a mass of scarring. It gives him a mean look and Cas decides not to get in its way, should it come to it. But the others seem slightly less peeved by their new visitors and creep closer to the humans in curiosity.
Well, he doesn’t want to leave Cas. He hopes Cas doesn’t want to leave him. The love part is far too close to that aforementioned something vulnerable and he’s quick to back off that particular train of thought.
Dean chuckles and draws a fry through ketchup. “Yeah, you got me there.”
The microwave beeps at him and he empties the contents into a bowl. As he nears the doorway to the movie and gaming den, he’s disappointed to note that Sam apparently paused the movie when Dean left. Great. He could feign a headache, he supposes, but then there is a delightful little thought that maybe Cas will take pity on his sorry, weeping self and let Dean spend the rest of the movie curled against him on the couch in his arms. They try to keep the PDA to a minimum with Sam around, but this is what he gets for bringing
See, Jack brokered a deal wherein Cas gave the Empty his grace in exchange for a life back on earth and Cas was wiped clean of every angelic notion to the very dregs. And in its place, there is nothing.
The marked difference in Dean’s countenance when Cas takes that first bite is surprising. It’s like Dean’s been waiting all day to get Cas to eat that burger, despite the fact that it only got to their table five minutes ago. It occurs to Cas then that his behavior must be causing Dean a remarkable amount of stress. The realization sits uncomfortably in his middle, hot and roiling just below his diaphragm. He hasn’t been faking it well enough, he realizes. He’s let this thing, this numbness, come too close to the surface. He must be better about his façade in the future, he decides. That should assuage Dean’s worry at the very least, until...
“I hardly think that’s an appropriate response,” Cas replies. “Besides, he didn’t seem upset.”
“I don’t mind,” Cas says, and he finds that he means it. It’s a welcome change of scenery, if nothing else. Plus, it feels surprisingly good to move his body beyond its typical route of bedroom to bathroom and back again with occasional stops at the kitchen for necessary meal breaks.
Sam pulls a half smile, sad and understated. “Yeah.” Sam drops his hand from Cas’s shoulder and Cas takes a small step back.
feel a certain way about things. For example, he should feel elated to have a bedroom he can call his own, he should be grateful to be living in a world without a petulant god’s rule, he should show more gratitude to Sam and Dean who have taken him in without question. Instead, he is twice removed from the sentiment, as if watching a facsimile of himself from behind glass go through the motions. And on top of everything else, he’s not entirely interested in breaking through that glass. The penetrating fatigue is bone-deep, sapping him of all motivation, even in his own mind.
“I need your help. I can’t do it by myself. And Amara… it’s new for her too. She never knew Heaven like you did.”
“It’s okay Dean. I know. It’s okay.” Castiel knew just how much Dean had repressed his emotions, all his life and even more so these last years.
He walked up to the angel slowly, lingering behind him. Castiel could feel Dean’s warm breath on his neck, he closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling. Dean enveloped his arms around Cas’ waist, he couldn’t wait anymore… he needed to feel close to him. The angel grabbed the hands settled on his stomach, caressing them. Dean gently kissed the back of his neck, pushing the flannel away with his nose brushing against Castiel’s skin. He loved him. So much.
“I did. You should be comfortable.” Eileen signed back. Dean chuckled and shook his head, signing “thank you” back to her and laid himself on the table, head resting on the pillow.
Jack nodded. “I have to talk to Cas about something now” and disappeared, leaving Dean alone in the kitchen with his mug in hand.
“How’s it going?” Castiel had come up to check on him
“Yeah? I’ll take every help I can get.”
“In his bedroom, dumbass!” Sam continued, exasperated “No wonder you remember nothing, you passed out!”
“Well, I still have my jacket. The one wh-where he put his hand on me before disappearing. It’s got his blood on it.” Dean said, hopeful but still bitter at the memory.
Dean closed his eyes, throwing his head back on the pillow. Castiel’s touch was like fire on his skin. He felt the angel mouth on his collarbone, nipping at his skin. On his nipples, licking them lovingly, His teeth gently biting his stomach “Okay…I-“ Cas had started stroking his dick gently, making him close his eyes in pleasure. “Do what you want with me” Dean had most generally been the pleasurer in his previous sexual encounters and was starting to feel very vulnerable in the angel’s arms. Castiel put a hand on his mouth.
“Nothing. I’m…” He hesitated “You know I’m sorry. For the way I treated you, the way I yelled. Of course I don’t want you to sacrifice yourself for me, or Sam, or anyone.” Dean sighed “I’m angry sometimes, and… I’m proud of you. You’re a tough kid.” Dean smiled.
“I’ll always want you.” Dean finally smiled “Cas…there’s no one else but you. I mean look at me…”
Hearing Dean pronouncing his name like that made Castiel’s heart melt. He held him in his arms, leaving a kiss on his head.
“Dean…the Empty is a horrible place. And the fact that it might endanger you or Sam, or Eileen…” Cas shook his head, looking in the distance.
“How did you…” He glanced at the amulet.
Dean frowned his eyes “Yes, but what does it have to do with anything?”
“I’ll bring you one anyway.” Sam replied. “How’s he doing?”
“Well…
And seeing him like this broke Cas’ heart. He couldn’t do that to him, but he couldn’t stand by either. He rubbed his hands on his face, inhaling and exhaling through his nose.
“Cas, you’re killing me.” Dean whined, heat coming in waves everywhere in his body. He could feel his jeans getting more and more tighter, almost unbearable. He sighed hard, holding Cas’ flannel tightly between his fingers.
They both fell silent, Sam sipping his coffee and Castiel checking on Eileen’s vital signs. Their silence was deranged by another knock on the door. Dean came in, patting his brother on the shoulder like Castiel did just before, causing Sam to smile. He stood next to him, watching Eileen with concern.
his name. He couldn’t acknowledge that
“I don’t know. To protect himself? Maybe he thinks he’s still in the Empty…”
“Well…” Bobby said taking a breath “
“Sam, where is he?” He was getting very worried now.
“I love you too Cas” was all he wanted to say. He said it to him every night, drunk on his bedroom’s floor. He knew damn well that he had said nothing that day. Nothing. And he was terrified he could never tell him. Completely terrified. Absolutely lost. Utterly broken. “I love you too Cas” he whispered again. His body aching and burning from the immeasurable distance between him and his angel. This night he didn’t sleep well between the pain and the nightmares.
“Hello Dean.”
“Yes, I do. The spell is good. The ingredients too. We have Jack with us.” He looked in his brother eyes. “It’s going to be
dream. The one Castiel visited so many years ago. It was too much for him. He looked at Cas.
And Dean wanted to run and hug him, revel into seeing him again. But he was stuck in wonder and awe. All he could master was “Cas…” just loud enough that he could hear himself say it. Softly, like a whisper. Cas had heard him of course.
had said to him before being snatched but the Empty. But he just… couldn’t.
“Yeah, I’m sure!” Sam answered laughing.
was what they had accomplished in
“You do know me.” Dean smiled as Cas put on some pants and a shirt.
“Time to move, bitch!” Amara’s voice seeped through Jack’s mouth, smiling.
“We’ve marked the pages. There’s a colour code.” Jody added.
back. That he let his angel go into the darkness without protesting. That he laid on the cold floor for hours, alone and crying. No, he couldn’t go in the archive room yet. He had to keep what little strength he had left to focus on
“For leaving you.” Cas answered, meeting Dean’s verdant eyes.
“Not fair, Cas.” Dean breathed, yanking the angel’s belt away. He was faster than Cas, he tugged at the elastic band underneath, hairs tickling his fingers, he looked down, sliding his hand even lower, looking into Castiel’s eyes. When he felt the hard bulge against his hand, he gently curled around his dick, stroking it languidly. Cas’s eyes widened and escaped a soft moan, making Dean even more exited. Cas whimpered his name again with every stroke, his eyes fluttered shut. All of this was new to the angel, and Dean’s touch was pure bliss. Dean’s jeans were getting very uncomfortable, he groaned but kept going. He was not important, Cas was.
, the angel that had saved him more times that he could count, the angel he was desperately in love with, the angel he needed to save, his angel. His heartache turned into something else, resolution, purpose, a hint of hope. But he didn’t allow himself more than a hint. If he did and failed to bring him back, he knew he wouldn’t survive it.
Cas smiled and gently entered Dean. The hunter threw his head back on the pillow, gasping.
Dean looked around, as if to check if there were still walls or not.
“I’ll sleep when we have a way to kill this thing and heal Eileen”
“I’ll rest later Sammy” Dean gritted his teeth and looked at his brother, seeing the worry in his brother’s eyes. “What is it? Is Cas okay?” He said, suddenly worried.
“Just tell me if you want to stop.” His finger slipped into Dean’s mouth, who slowly sucked in-between moans, he was getting very hard and it was getting difficult to concentrate on anything else than Cas’ touch. Cas’s stroke had stopped, making him whine. But he said nothing more. Cas looked at him, caressing his face. He loved to see Dean like that, he was so beautiful. His.
Dean’s hands were tight against Cas’ head and waist, his body uncontrollable.
“I’m going to check on Sam and Eileen, bring them some sandwiches maybe” Dean said after hours of research, his eyes fighting sleep, dark circles around them.
“It’s not. Not anymore.” Dean answered, his hand sliding behind Cas’s head, resting on his hair. “And you can feel it too.” He looked at Cas’ hand still on his chest. He put his left hand on his and met his eyes “Tell me if I’m lying.”
“Och, sweet Samuel… I canna work my magic on copies alone. I need the real book in my hands to perform a ritual.”
_______________________
“I tried calling Jack but he’s unreachable.” Cas shook his head. “And I can’t use my grace.”
“Come here” Dean put his mug down and patted a chair next to him. Castiel put his phone on the table, walking towards him. Cas sat next to him, almost facing Dean.
“Sam? What happened?” Dean screamed at his brother, trying to make him snap out of it. He shook his brother “Sam!”
“Wh…do you? Want to kiss me?” Dean asked, pleasantly surprised at the inquiry.
Dean chuckled “But you’re
“Now what? we’ve got this book but we can’t translate it…”
“Dean…” He looked in his eyes and could see the malice in them, the longing. “I think you should-“ But Dean had got up and circled around the table, kneeling in front of him. “I think you should get some rest”
Dean was walking down the corridors, wiping the constant gentle flow of his tears, he didn’t even know exactly why he was still crying. But… he couldn’t stop, his body was not letting him stop. Once arrived at number 11, his room, he opened the room and went to sit on his bed. Miracle had followed him and sat beside him on the bed. His head resting in his hands, elbows on his knees, slowly calming down. After taking a deep breath, he walked around his room and looked around, looking at the things he amassed during the years. It was nothing and it was everything: weapons, books, photographs, trinkets, mix-tapes, porn magazines… was
“Hmmm… Jack?” Dean’s eyebrow was raised “Who are you talking to?” And it was like Jack wasn’t even listening to him. “Jack!” Dean snapped his fingers in the air.
“I want to kiss you again.” He dived towards Castiel, but the angel backed his face, making Dean whine.
“I am.”
“What do you want to do, once you can get out of this room?”
“I’m getting him out! GET OUT OF MY WAY!” He shouted back, blasting the shell of Lucifer with all the power he could muster. The Empty exploded in black goo everywhere, sliding off, only to reform itself in a multitude of Lucifers around Jack and Castiel. Jack looked at Cas, still sound asleep. He ran to him, grabbed him hard and dragged him away. He was so close to the rift now… he couldn’t give up. He was getting him out. The Empty materialised in front of him. Lucifer with his wings spread, eyes burning red.
“Dean!” Cas’ body was shaking with pleasure, he moaned without knowing and whimpered Dean’s name in Enochian…he was completely lost in his touch. “I-I…huum” He stroke Dean’s hair with his other hand, tugging at it. Dean moaned and it reverberated on Cas’ dick, he could feel that the angel wasn’t going to last long. He bobbed his head and took more of him inside, sliding his tongue down his length. He cupped Castiel’s balls in his hands, caressing them, and this was it. Castiel’s back arched, his hand curled around the sheets, crying out Dean’s name. Dean jolted as the lights flickered and exploded in the room. He didn’t stop. Dean had never felt that when pleasuring someone, he was so close to the edge too. He swallowed Cas’ hotness and swiped a finger on his lips. He let go of Castiel’s hand gently. In all of his dreams it was someone doing this to him, not the contrary. But it had felt so good doing it for Cas. So good.
helped.”
“I don’t have to do it now. When you’re ready too.” Castiel offered, and Dean nodded in agreement.
He kept dragging the angel, blasting away at the Empty trying to stop him from moving. He fell again, Castiel falling by his side, motionless.
The Empty was thrown away by the most powerful blast emerging from the Nephilim. Pure energy radiating in waves from him, Amara’s and his. He closed his eyes again and they were his again.
“Yes. You always shine with your love Cas. I’m trying to do the same in heaven, I’m trying to make love shine, for everyone.” he paused “Amara says she can help you ward off the Empty by marking your vessel with sigils and symbols, very old ones.”
“I know.” Jack said, all-knowing, but he was still glad Castiel had said it out loud. “I need to get back to Heaven. Pray to me when you make up your mind about the warding. I love you too.”
When he realised what was nestled inside, his heart skipped a beat. He escaped a sound caught in his throat. He went back to sit down on the bench to anchor himself.
They stopped at some point to look at the water in the distance, slightly deranged by waves forming in the cold wind. The sunlight hit them right in their faces, forcing Dean to use his hand as a visor.
“Ready?” Rowena asked
“Still, his opinion matters to me.” He hugged Jack “Thank you.” he looked at him “I’m very proud of you.”
“My masterpiece. Beautiful.” He said, to no one in particular.
. That’s all he could think about.
“I’ve brought you coffee” Sam said, resting the tray on the table they had moved earlier in the week into Cas’ bedroom. Dean didn’t want to eat anywhere else. He spent most of his time in the room with the angel. Cas had no need for eating but he liked to watch Dean and talk to him while he did. They were still discovering this new relationship between us.
on his vessel, but otherwise…” Jack shook his head “That’s all we’ve got for now.”
“I will. Always.” He said back, locking him in his embrace, holding onto him like he could disappear any minute. Dean nestled his face in the crook of Castiel’s neck, safe.
“Yes, I feel great.” Dean cleared his throat, trying to get his thoughts in order. “Maybe I’ll call on Jack, to see if he’s got any news.” Dean slowly sat up on the bed, still facing Castiel.
Sam grabbed her hands, hugging her close to make her stop. He soothed her as she cried in his arms. He had only his touch and smell to reach her. He felt so hopeless.
It was weird seeing Castiel without his trench coat. He was wearing ‘normal clothes’ now. He didn’t want to wear the clothes he had in the Empty anymore. He borrowed clothes from Dean’s and Sam had picked up some jeans around town. He was wearing a purple flannel, one of Dean’s favourite.
“I’m sorry. I can’t. Not now anyway.” Cas shook his head. “I’m sorry Jack.”
Dean nodded and held his hands with both hands. Amara put her hands on Castiel’s chest, closing her eyes and reciting a chant. When she opened her eyes, they were jet black. She inhaled sharply and waves of power seemed to emanate from her hands, causing Castiel to wince and refrain a scream. He squeezed Dean’s hand hard, his vision blackening for a second. Dean’s hands were turning white where the angel squeezed him but he didn’t care at all. Amara closed her eyes again and suddenly Castiel was slowly relaxing.
“I…Claire… That’s where he… got snatched.” He sat at his desk; arms crossed over his chest. “I can’t go back there, it’s too hard.”
“Well, after all that you did for me boys, it’s quite nothing really.” Rowena smiled as Sam entered the room again.
“Well… do you think you have the ability to make me…mortal?” Castiel asked, unsure.
“You and me” He said to Miracle, “we’re gonna bring him back” he continued “and then there will be two miracles in this bunker.” he kissed the dog and Miracle yapped excitedly. Apparently, she agreed to join him on this mission.
“I’m not. I’m not at peace.” He said, gazing into the angel’s eyes. “This is important. You listen to me now or I don’t know if I’ll ever get the courage to say it again.” He pleaded.
“If I get the warding…Dean, this will change everything between us.” He couldn’t look at Dean.
“I want to make you feel good. Let me.” Dean whispered in his ear, sending tingles through Cas’s spine. Dean then proceeded moving his mouth lower, lower. His stubble brushed against Castiel’s inner thigh, and when Dean licked him there, he could feel the angel shiver beneath his hands and mouth.
He blinked a few times, trying to focus his eyes on something or someone. He was in his bedroom again. Not Castiel’s. Why was he here? Has it all been a fever dream? He panicked, his heart racing, breath getting shorter. Sam was next to him, Miracle at his feet.
Dean was worried none of it was going to work. He was worried it was going to work. He was worried. What if Cas was not there? What if Jack couldn’t find him? What if he found him but the Empty killed him for good this time? What will he say to him? Will he be the same? What if…what if…
“Yes, but lying is not a small feat, Dean.” He was so serious that Dean couldn’t hold a smile back. “Why are you smiling?” the angel asked.
. Not how he felt. “He…before he got snatched…” he said, almost whispering “He told me… that I changed him.” His eyes were watering now. “He told me… that he loved me.” He looked at Charlie, who had moved her other hand to his shoulder, supporting him. “And I don’t know how I’m supposed to feel, Charlie. I don’t.” Charlie hugged him close.
“Fine. I’ll go ask him if it’s okay.”
, what would it be in
Dean sighed again, shaking his head, refraining tears from falling. He didn’t want to talk about it but he didn’t want to forget either. Not
When Dean woke up, he was pretty drowsy. After a moment he noticed he was in his bedroom. He had his clothes back on. Sam was next to him, seated in a chair.
And there it was. The feeling that he was indeed in Heaven. Dean was speechless and Bobby looked at him knowingly, drinking his beer, letting Dean process it. And Dean
“Dean…I could use-”
“Worth a try. I think I can get her on videocall…What time is it ?”
Cas tilted his head, pushing onto Dean’s hand, marvelling at his touch. He had never felt this. In all his millennia life. His joy overpowered any reasonable thought he could have had. He would do anything for the human in front of him. Anything for Dean. He would say it again, and more.
“Only yours?” Claire asked.
“I love it too.” Dean chuckled and laid his cards on the table, winning again.
“What? Jack, that’s not good enough!” Dean continued, but Castiel put a hand to calm him.
Dean looked at him, worry in his eyes. “Cas…can you look at me and tell me you can save her?”
He did not want to be scared, but he also knew that the more books were discarded, the more it meant that the possibility of finding no answers at all, was also very real. The day was punctuated by sandwiches, prepared by Eileen and Sam during a break. And in the afternoon, peanut butter and jelly ones, made with love by Claire and Kaia. More coffee coming from Bobby and Stevie. Some late comers from Bobby’s network got to the bunker around 5 pm and got to work after making their round of “sorry we’re late” “hi” “yeah, we’ve got some catch up to do”.
They spend the day watching cartoons, sorting plants Dean had brought back to the room. They really needed to reorganize the bunker and Sam would be pleased when he came back from the hunt. After Miracle’s walk with Dean, they played board games and poker. Castiel tried to teach Dean how to play chess.
“Well… we need to break into the Empty. You know where angels and demo-“ Sam started but got cut halfway.
“Don’t you want me to…?” Dean looked down at Cas’ crotch, getting bigger by the second.
“It’s a big new world out there. You’ll see”
Suddenly he stopped thinking.
Hope you like this chapter!
He got up after a few minutes, on his way to buy some pies to bring back home. At last, he had something worth celebrating.
“Come with me. I need your help getting the jars from storage.”
And Dean was starting to realise that maybe he could finally get a little peace here. He took a sip of his first beer in Heaven. And...
“You’re mine.” Cas whispered, thrusting more into him. Dean was pulling at the sheets around him, his hands searching for Cas’. He finally found him as Cas pressed them closer together, making Dean cry his name.
Dean was already getting up. He got dizzy and stopped. Closing his eyes, and grabbing the edge of the bed, trying to find his balance.
“So, how does it work?”
Yes. Tomorrow, Dean’s most important hunt will begin. No, not a hunt, he thought… a war. A war to find a way to bring
“Yes. Best in…years.” Dean answered honestly.
“Yeah? Then let’s go to work.” Eileen signed and smiled, determined.
Dean went out that day, he took Miracle and drove away with baby. Eating up miles, driving nowhere in particular. He stopped at a lake somewhere on the road. Miracle yapping happily as he walked with her along the banks of water. It was cold and no one was around, they walked like this for some time. Dean rested with Miracle on a bench, sharing a peanut butter sandwich with her. It was good to be outside at least.
“I do.” He kissed him like never before, pulling him closer, his tongue sliding inside the angel’s mouth, tasting him. Cas kissed him back, biting Dean’s lip in excitation. Dean growled but didn’t stop. Castiel was taken aback after his involuntarily bite but he quickly realised that Dean had liked it more than it had hurt him. Castiel kissed him again, savouring every moment in Dean’s embrace, his fingers burning on his skin.
“Thanks kid.” Dean clapped Jack’s shoulder and released him. He looked at him. Sometimes he swore he saw Cas in his eyes. He wandered just how much Jack chose to take from the angel when he was born, had he chosen to look like him?
“And you couldn’t come to say hi?!” Dean yelled back “We were worried, we needed you!”
“Of course. You keep reminding me.”
“Cas, I can’t focus if you keep doing this.” He whimpered, taking his hand out to get Castiel’s jeans and taking his underwear off him. Cas hurriedly did the same, still kissing Dean everywhere his mouth fell while he clumsily got rid of his jeans.
“He’ll be here, Dean.” Sam reassured his brother while cutting some black henbane with a knife. Rowena was crushing what looked like bones with a mortar and pestle. Dean kept pacing and glancing at the dark blue feather. Eileen came back with more dried plants and put them in an orderly manner on the table: wild buckwheat, vervain, yarrow and some snapdragon.
“Dean… I didn’t see you today. You didn’t come to see us in the dungeon.” Claire said, almost like a reproach. “Kaia and I…we’ve got some leads to bring him back, you should come see us tomorrow.”
“And your mom and dad…” Bobby continued... He could see Dean’s face changing, beginning to get hopeful. “They got a place over yonder” he told him, still waving in the distance. It was starting to really hit Dean that he was in fact in a new and improved Heaven.
“Why did you take this picture?” he couldn’t look away at the photograph. He stroked it gently with his thumb.
Jack sighed “I understand. Your love is too strong. I can feel it, radiating from you.” he smiled “And from him.” he smiled “I had to try.”
lake? You made this?” Dean said, dumbstruck. Cas was a fucking artist.
Castiel was here.
“Sam, I promise that we will not misbehave.” Castiel answered, serious, making Dean almost spit his coffee out of his mouth.
“I’m alright.” He answered, kissing him softly on the mouth “But if you’re not, then I’ll wait.” His cheeks were flushed red from desire and his hair was a mess. “I want it to be perfect too.” He sighed, passing his thumb on his lips “I swear you’ll be the death of me someday.”
“Well, this is linked to God…or at least God’s powers. If you can summon the ‘powers’ here, it’s Jack we’re summoning.” Castiel eyes shone “I know the spell. Come on!” He got up, extending his arm towards Dean to follow him. “I can’t believe I haven’t thought about it before!”
“The books are very old, so she’s going to work on them first and send what she thinks will help us after” Bobby added.
“Give me the amulet now.” Castiel ordered Dean.
“I was. Now I’m not.” Bobby simply answered, looking at Dean from his chair.
“Great. Thank you.” Dean was reassured. At least Cas will have a secure room once he got out of the Empty. Even if Dean wouldn’t make it back from his sacrifice, Cas would be safe.
Dean was shocked “Bu-but then you could die.”

“Hum, yes?” Cas tried to focus on the game but was better at chess.
“Dean, I don’t sleep.”
“Jack, what happened in Heaven?”
, for her?”
“No!” Jack stopped him.
“Yeah, man. You always did care too much. That’s why we… that’s why we all love you.” Sam answered. And panicked almost instantly when he saw Dean, broken again, worse than before. He really thought he said the right thing there. “Dean, what is it?” he said, urgently.
“She’s got a very large collection of books on lore, and not only European, but from every part of the world” Sam added. “This could change things, Dean. Anja has always been interesting in the afterlife and it seems she’s got quite the collection from what Garth has told us.”
“I need…Cas. I need to tell you…” he struggled, fiddling with his hands, shaking his head.
“It’s better if it’s Jack anyway, he’s more powerful than any of us, more than the Empty even.” The brush slid on Dean’s skin forming a circle on his chest. He felt a tingling of energy coursing through him. “Turn around, I need to get this on your back too.” Sam continued.
“Yes. The Empty. Castiel was snatched by it after he made a deal. We need to get him back.” He was serious, looking in her eyes. Rowena’s eyes flickered to Dean’s for a moment then she went back to Sam’s.
“Eileen picked up a case up north, I think we’re gonna go there and check it out today.”
“Every day you’re on Earth and an angel, it can find you.”
love him, I would have been surprised.” Dean looked at him, speechless. “Dean…I’ve literally watched you two falling in love over the years.”
“I know he has these new powers…but he’s still young. He has much to learn.” Cas shook his head “I wish I could help him with his burden.”
“No…I prayed to him and he just…doesn’t answer. I don’t know what’s going on with him.” He sighed, and Dean looked at him with heartbreak in his eyes. He had prayed to him too, but never got any answer, he looked away. He
“No. Nothing.” Jack shook his head, avoiding their eyes.
Cas suddenly choking. Dean finding him in the Empty only to find him dead, drowning in his own blood. Cas covered in black goo, saying he loved him. Dean crying and saying
He got out to try and find him and when he opened the door, he was surprised to find him less than 30 feet away from the bunker’s front door, seated on a rock, head in his hands. He sat next to him, cross-legged.
Dean’s heart was racing, every part of him that touched the angel’s skin was on fire. He couldn’t look away from the blue eyes staring down at him.
what defined him? He thought it was sad that there were not more photographs of his friends and family. Only a few he cherished, but not enough. And not even one
“I am with you.” The angel was confused
Three months since Dean had realised what some of the ingredients really were. Three months of torture and ache. Worse than before. Because what was missing to break Cas out of the Empty was Castiel. As stupid as it was. They needed a piece of his celestial being to bring him back.
“Samuel, always so little faith.” She grinned and suddenly she was not there anymore. The boys waited about five minutes before she appeared again, a very ancient book in her hands. Sam slid a table across the floor for her to deposit the book on.
“No, Sammy. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you what happened. You’re right. Cas was your friend too… you deserve to know.” He looked at his brother, setting a garbage bag aside. “What happened to Cas, it was not random. He made a deal with the Empty…”
“What do you mean?”
“Jack, I need to talk to you.”
Castiel backed slowly, cupping Dean’s face in his hands “You are not stupid. Stop saying that. Stop it.” He shook his head “You are not this person, Dean. I know you’re not.”
“I’m just an angel Dean.”
Dean sighed and shrugged. “I don’t know.” He ran his hand over his face, rubbing the fatigue away. “Jack says he’s alright…I don’t know what’s wrong with him.” and sighed again.
It had been six months since Rowena cracked the spell book.
Sam and Eileen are working a case up north. Jack pops by to ask Castiel a favour and to help him get out of the bunker. Dean is finally better and tries opening more to Castiel. The angel wants to be closer to the hunter, intimate, but don’t know how to show his feelings. He’s afraid of hurting Dean unintentionally and restrain himself, to Dean’s frustration. Though he understands the angel is reluctant, he thinks it’s not for the good reasons. Dean is scared too, but not in the same way. He has the opportunity to explore feelings he repressed for years; he wants to share more with the angel but is still clumsy when it comes to expressing his emotions.
He heard something he had not heard in a very long time. Feathers. Wings rustling. And he saw him. Standing close to the water ledge. In his damn trench coat. Just a shadow in the sunset. Still, he would have recognized him anywhere.
As the week of research comes to a close, Dean and Sam continue to try to find a way to bring Cas back from the Empty.
could get it for you, of course.” Rowena proposed. “I’m the Queen of Hell after all, it comes with its perks.” She was going to snap out of the dungeon, Sam could feel it.
“You would?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
“Jack! We need you.” Castiel called, feeling something weird. Like if the line was disconnected, like if no one was on the other side. No angel radio. Nothing. And as he concentrated, he realised he couldn’t reach Heaven at all. He felt worry fill him, what if something had happened to Jack? What if he was in danger too?
“I feel too much, huh?” Dean asks, almost chuckling.
“Dean? Man do you have like… tears in your eyes?” Sam asked, partly worried and partly amused by the sight while cleaning off his weapon.
“Just like this.” Bobby continued. Taking the moment in.
Yes. He was bound to Cas. He had been ever since he raised him from Hell. Sam and Rowena had found a way to kill Dean momentarily to allow a former visitor to set foot in the Empty, just a few moments. It would only take so much to grab Cas and get out. But all of this would be of absolutely no use if they couldn’t get a hold of Jack. He was the only one who went to the Empty and back except for Castiel.
“Would you care for a coffee? I would! Come on, let’s go get some.” she got up, leaving the table and a kiss on Stevie’s head.
too. And I want you.” Dean finally said what had weighed on him for years now. He always pushed it back, even more in recent years. But the feeling never left, it kept on growing despite his best efforts. Tears rolled softly on his cheeks. “I want you Cas. I love you. I love you” He felt like he couldn’t stop saying it now.
“Are you angry to see me Dean?” Jack asked, frowning in confusion.
He stared at the box again, brushing it delicately. He could sense every detail of the wood carved beneath his fingers. It was very long, maybe more than his arm. He undid the copper latch, opening it cautiously as if it were made of glass.
“Do…you want me to help him?” Castiel asked unsure.
“YOU! GET OUT! GET OUUUUUUT!”
“I don’t know if I can do that.” Dean answered slowly.
“Hello Jack.” he put down the book, looking at him.
Dean sighed and rubbed his eyes. “I need coffee.”
“Thank you” Dean uttered, talking to Amara but looking at Cas, still hunched with the memory of pain.
“Yep” said a familiar voice next to him. And he realised he said his thoughts aloud.
“No Dean.”
“Don’t get me wrong. I’m glad you want out. But…” Sam stopped himself, not knowing if he should continue on his line of thought.
back. I’m going to get Cas out of the Empty.” And it felt good saying his name, saying it with hope and not despair.
Castiel came in in the infirmary after having knocked on the door. He nodded at Sam and put his hand on his shoulder, trying to reassure him. He handed him the hot beverage; Sam smiled back but the angel could feel his sorrow. It was unbearable.
“I think I’ll go for a drive” He simply said to Bobby.
“You look good Cas.” he said, his chest burning with want and desire. Castiel understood immediately.
fault the spell requires it!” Rowena had declared after Dean’s voiced concern.
“I know Bobby, I know. Thank you for everything.” he hugged him goodbye one last time and watch the rest of the research team leave through the bunker’s door. He exhaled slowly. He went back to his room to pick up Miracle for her walk.
“Oh well…” she said, getting her knife out of her back pocket, and cutting her hand just like Sam did moments before. Blood slowly leaking from the wound.
Dean was speechless. Jack looked at him and extended his arms, a beautifully carved wooden box appearing out of thin air.
“No!” Sam almost yelled. “I won’t stop, and I can’t see you like this Dean!” He stopped to breathe, “I can’t!” he added, eyes fille with pain. “Man, we’re all that’s left. You got to talk to me, Dean.
“What?” Dean’s eyes were wide “Cas is stuck in a Led Zeppelin loop? Really? Why?”
“Sam. If Eileen’s state worsens, I’ll use my powers to heal her.” Castiel said, serious.
“What?” Cas said, perplexed. “Dean. I know you.” He continued, still looking at him.
“Cas…everything. You did everything. Never think otherwise.” he kissed his forehead “You’re…everything to me.” Dean’s eyes were starting to water from the emotions. Cas made him so vulnerable.
Dean and Cas were left alone in the room, with the exception of Miracle sleeping on the bed. Dean was slowly waking up and was glancing at Castiel on the other side of the table. The angel was sending texts on his smartphone. Surely the other person will be drowned under tons of emojis.
Dean paused and thought about the song Cas was stuck into, tape recorder in hand.
“So, Jack did all that?” He finally said, looking around.
“I know.” Dean said breaking into a smile. He sat straighter on the bed, composing himself. “Could you…say it again? For me?” he murmured with pleading eyes. Even if someone had been in the room, only Castiel would have heard him. They were so close he didn’t need him to speak any louder.
Cas stared “Dean…I thought you didn’t want me reading your mind.”
More goo tried to catch him but he fought it back with his powers, burning it. He finally reached Castiel. He was laying on the ground. Asleep, it seemed. Jack had thought like the rest of the group that Castiel would be awake. He was taken aback for a moment but thought about Dean, who were still dead on the other side.
“What? No. Maybe? No.” Dean discreetly – he thought – wiped away a single tear out of his eye. He turns back to look at Sam. “Dude.
be wrong?”
Jack turned his eyes away “It’s okay. I know you and Dean are in love.”
“Sam, I want you to go fetch some pillows and stuff for her. Go.” Dean ordered his brother who left with a vacant look.
” his foot brushed Castiel’s, gently pressing against his lower leg.
Dean put one of his mixtapes in the tape player, the same one he gave Cas all those years ago. He had secured the headphones on the angel’s head. He hit play.
“I don’t need…I don’t need you to say it back. I know it’s different for you” Castiel added, his voice breaking slightly.
Slowly but surely, he started to find a rhythm, opening a new page, scanning it, translating it, turning the next page, drinking – spiked – coffee, unperturbed. Then, after what felt like hours on end something made him twitch. Miracle, who had been sound asleep, started wagging her tail, and barking.
He started eating but quickly felt sick and realised, once again that he was not hungry. He wandered around, going nowhere in particular. He arrived at room number 15. The guest room as Sam liked to call it. It had been Mary’s for a while. And it had been Castiel’s too. The song continued as Dean entered the room.
“Couldn’t you come with me to take a look? You’ll be safe there.” Jack asked, pleading.
“It’s from Anja, in Germany. Garth’s contact” Dean answered. “Maybe she knows more about it, since she’s the one who sent it.”
He was so tensed he almost let a jar slipped out of his hands. Eileen had great reflexes and caught it just in time, closing her eyes in relief.
“No.” He breathed.
Cas’ hand moved even higher, making Dean moan. Taking his time was getting very hard to accomplish by the minute. The angel stopped to look at the human, and he could see clear as day the lust in his eyes, pleading for more. But Castiel was scared of hurting Dean, he had been so fragile this week, he didn’t want to push him.
“Castiel! Castiel, wake up!” He shouted at the angel, shaking him. He tried to wake him up with his powers but it was completely useless. Nothing changed at all. He was still asleep. Jack sighed and began lifting him up. He was stronger than any man, and he was going to get Cas out of there. Even if he needed to drag him out unconscious. He would figure out a way to wake him up later.
“Didn’t you hear us? Praying to you?” Dean asked, a bit hurt and angry.
not to wake up.”
Dean squinted “What? You’re an angel, you don’t age.”
“What is it Dean? Did you hit the right key?” he said, a little jokily.
“Dean…” He said, brushing the tears of Dean’s face with his thumb. Then he took him in his embrace, shrouding him with his angelic warmth. Dean’s face was nestled in Castiel’s shoulder and he took it all in for once. The feelings…pure and powerful. His scent, his body, his breath on his neck. And then he could not wait anymore. He held his head up to face him, holding Cas’ face in his hands, his fingers burning to feel more of him. Still, he kept them there. And he looked at him like he so often did. Sweetly, longingly, truly. But this time was different. This time he closed the gap between his lips and Cas’ with a soft kiss. And Heaven felt like
“What is it Cas?” He was scared he had gone too far, maybe Cas didn’t want that at all?
Rowena threw a powder of some kind in a giant iron bowl making smoke puff out of it. She chanted louder, adding more powder. Sparks flew out of the bowl, making Eileen flinch, but she continued the chant nonetheless. Rowena, queen of hell and a witch; Eileen human who came back from the dead, Jack a Nephilim turned God who literally exploded in the Empty and came back anyway. Those were strong vessels for the spell to work through their chants.
At some point in the evening, Sam walked around the bunker to check on everyone, tired of working on the computer all day, plus Bobby finally understood the videocall thing by himself, mostly anyway. Sam was amazed by the work that had been crunched in one day and was starting to get really hopeful for the week. If
“For what? Cas was my friend too. You’re not forcing me or anything.”
“You’re so beautiful, Dean.” Cas whispered in his ear, his breath brushing against Dean’s skin. His hand moved swiftly on Dean’s cock and he let a small noise escape his mouth, closing his eyes in bliss. “I never thought…you could be more beautiful.” Dean looked into his lusty blue eyes, and by the mere sight of them felt a rush of pleasure coursing through him. He locked his lips on the angel’s. He couldn’t believe it was Cas, doing this to him.
H E A L
“Sure, what?”
“I know she’s suffering; you don’t think I know that?” Dean waved his hands angrily in the air “But I won’t risk losing you! We’ll call Jack!”
“You do nothing, Dean. Let me do the work. I want to do this, for both of you.” Amara looked at Dean intensely “After all, I promised you I would always help you.” Dean glanced at Cas when she said that, embarrassed. She had said that under completely different circumstances.
The third chapter ! Hope you like this one, big things happening :)
“Where…When…How? Claire! Thank you.” He hugged her tight, she was laughing.
It had almost been a week since Jack had gifted Dean one of Castiel’s feather. And today was the day he could finally bring him back. He had been overjoyed at first but rapidly started to get jumpy, worry taking over the first joy he had felt.
“Thank you.” And Dean smiled again. Only Cas said ‘thank you’ every time he made a compliment, like he was surprised but humbled at the same time. He loved giving him compliments. He had done so for a week and was not getting tired of it. He felt like he had years to catch up on.
Castiel opened the bunker’s door, stepping inside. Dean was in the garage and would be here any minute now. The angel had loved their outing, as short as it had been. Seeing Dean like this…so peaceful and happy… It made him feel even more love for him. It was almost like something had shifted in Dean, pieces of himself slowing clicking into place.
The sunlight had all but disappeared and the bunker was all lit up with artificial light. Dean was head in a book on Native American legends. He tried to find the piece in the puzzle that Sam and Eileen had missed during their hunt.
“No, I’m…” Dean shook his head “Never mind. Yes. I liked it.” He finally said.
Blood. Tears. Blackness.
“Cas! Jack found a way to get you out of this damn room.” Dean cheered, smiling.
Dean groaned and got up, wincing. “How’s Eileen?”
“Sam, look it’s not translating. I don’t even recognise the language.” Eileen said to him.
Dean’s eyes widened at the realisation. Castiel did research on sex. He knew they had not yet gone all the way…but still. He didn’t know how to take it, was the angel not fulfilled like he thought he was? Did he want more? Blowjobs and hand jobs were one thing but the rest was not as evident for Dean, he was very new at this and…scared?
“DON’T MOVE! I WILL SHOOT!”, he shouted.
angel.”
“Well, who’s laughing now, huh?” Dean says, panting, before slashing his machete onto the vamp’s neck, cutting it clean. Sam was done on his part too.
Castiel poured another cup of coffee and got up, putting a finger under Dean’s chin, turning his face upwards to look at him “I have to check on Eileen again, I’m worried it’ll worsen fast now.” He laid a kiss on him, warm and loving.
Dean was speechless, gazing at the angel. He could listen to Cas all day. He was just so honest, he never wavered on his feelings. He was just Cas, in love.
“Seriously? Who got worried for my comfort as a dead man?” He said, laughing and looking around the room.
He stayed with Cas the whole night. Holding his hands and caressing his face and hair, brushing his fingers against his soft eyebrows, praying to him in whispers. As much as he was tired…He wouldn’t be able to sleep. He was too afraid to wake up and find him gone. He stayed like this for hours. Watching over the angel.
Jack’s presence sometimes. He swore he could just sense him there sometimes, when walking Miracle outside or riding Baby around. And maybe he could just explain or ask for his forgiveness for the way he treated the kid. For how he got angry at him. Something. Anything.
Dean looked back at the angel, the sun hitting his face gracefully, bringing out all the different shades of blue in them. He came closer and let the angel marvel at his eyes some more while he did the same. He brushed Castiel’s rebellious hair away. He couldn’t believe that he was here with him,
“Cas!” Dean stepped into the kitchen wide-eyed, his mouth agape.
“No Dean…my grace it’s unpredictable when I’m with you. And if we…if I…I don’t know what I’ll do.” Castiel tried to explain. “This will change things. I know it will… And if my grace is placing you in danger…”
“Maybe…” he frowned for a second, slightly turning his head and then whispered “No, not now.”
She smiled softly, holding Sam’s hand in hers. She sat up at best she could, wincing. She put her hand on Sam’s chest to reassure him. She could feel his worry transpiring. She turned his hand over like he did before. Her nose twitched and she started tracing on his palm.
“Cas…please” He pleaded but didn’t even know what for exactly.
better than anyone.” Her eyebrows were raised “promise me you’ll try, at least.”
“Quality stuff?” Bobby said, snorting.
“I don’t know if Jack knows how to keep the Empty away from me… and I don’t want you in danger.” Castiel’s voice was filled with worry.
“Do you want me to stop?” Cas said gently.
“I’d never…It was the first time for me…I…” He said softly.
Dean was still confused, but started to understand what was happening. Could it be true? It sure sounded like what Jack would do. He sat down next to Bobby, wanting to hear more.
“Yes! No!” Dean was confused too. “No, I’m happy to see you… I missed you that’s all.” He hugged him again. “I’m sorry I yelled.”
And yes, he did see and hear all that in the few seconds it took him to open the door and enter the room followed by Sam. He did feel the ache, burning in his chest. But he also saw Claire and Kaia, laughing, smiling, happy. Happy in this horrid room. The one where he disappeared. And this happy view warmed his heart enough to keep going. Claire had stopped laughing when she saw him and Sam enter.
“You’re sure? ‘Cause… we can keep going if you want.” Sam offered, still looking worried.
Jack touched Cas and Dean and they were suddenly standing in the infirmary. Sam jolted from his seat, taken aback.
“Maybe it’s too much of a long shot…I don’t know…” Sam sighed, resting his hands on the table, gently tapping his fingers.
“You will. But for now, you need to rest. You scared me last night.” He said, and it took everything in Dean not to pull him on the bed with him and kiss him again. “Dean…I’m tougher as you said. You can’t just pull me on the bed and make out with me.” Castiel stated.
Jack looked up. It was Lucifer’s voice. But he knew better. It was the Empty passing as Lucifer. Still, he was taken by surprise. “Lucifer’s” hands grabbed him and threw him five feet further, like he weighed nothing. He got back up, panting, trying to get back to Castiel.
“Are you alright? I mean… is there something you want to talk about?”
The angel walked towards his room, removing his coat when entering. He didn’t really need it but going out without it would have been conspicuous. He put his boots beside the door. Everything was quiet inside; the warding was still holding and after a check-up he concluded that it didn’t need improvements or do-overs. Eileen had done a great job with it. Still, he felt like it wasn’t the best protection... his grace threatened him and anyone close to him. Even with the warding in his vessel, a mistake could potentially bring the Empty back.  He heard a small knock on the door and Dean entered, putting his boots aside with a thump and closing the door behind him.
They were just a few people around and no one to bother them. Cas had put on a coat even though he was impervious to the cold. Dean had done the same, stating this would be weird if Cas didn’t put on a coat with this temperature. It was a beautiful day but a cold one. They walked by the lake shore without saying a word, Cas just looked around at the water and at Dean. Dean did the same. They didn’t need to talk and yet they understood each other. Miracle was running around, scouting for branches.
“I know I can.”
closer. He found nothing but old papers and yellowed photographs. The ones he had given Mary. Photographs of him and Sam as boys, sometimes with John. And as he perused through them, he thought of something. Maybe Jack had left something in his bedroom…maybe something of Cas? He still wasn’t answering any of Dean’s prayers. And prayed he did. He didn’t like it but had learned to see it more as a text or a call you’d send from your phone. The song continued.
Dean came closer, sitting in another chair next to Jack. Out of breath. Unable to keep his eyes off of Castiel.
“We are…he’s here.” Amara posted herself before them “I wanted to come in person, and I know the warding.”
Sam? Dean waited to see his brother face opening the door to put away his gun.
“We could, but we agreed…. one God is enough. She doesn’t want to make the same mistakes twice. She was really hurt last time.” And Dean could see the hurt in Jack’s eyes. The kid could feel what she felt. This had to be hard to live every day, sensing someone else’s emotions. “Of course, she could materialise instead of me. But she’s okay for now.”
And as he thought about all these moments, every stare, every joke between them, every instant, every fight, everything… he could see Castiel reacting before him. Smiling, frowning, sighing, chuckling even. And Dean smiled at the sight. How could he have been so stupid? To think he couldn’t be in love with the angel? To think he didn’t deserve his love? To think Cas didn’t deserve all the love he could give him? Dean’s chest was burning with a new desire. He reached for Cas’s face and the angel opened his eyes. Dean could feel that Castiel had read his mind. Though Dean couldn’t feel what Cas was thinking he could see a mixture of emotions emanating from the angel’s eyes. Passion. Fear. Love.
Like a poor soul lost in a labyrinth, following Ariadne’s golden thread, that’s how he felt. Chasing a feather in the wind. Chasing the ghost of his love. The love he never got the chance to express.
“Please don’t.” Dean replied “Don’t die again.” tears rolled off “You can’t die, not again.”
“I know. But would it be okay if I sleep next to you? In your arms?” Dean’s cheeks turned red.
“You have to try. I know you can do it. You’re strong. But you feel too much Dean, you have to sort your feelings out. You have to try.” Sam said, eyes shining with tears looking intently in his big brother’s eyes.
“I love you too, so much. And you do make me happy.” Castiel smiled in bliss. He was complete. In all his life he had never felt…fulfilled. And here he was, on Earth in the arms of a human. Fulfilled. In love. Burning with desire. “You were so beautiful tonight, Dean” he kissed him slow and stayed like this for some time, calming him. He thought about what Dean had said, about spending his life with him.
“You are?” Dean didn’t expect the angel to be scared too.
“Cas…” Dean had gripped Cas’ arm, trying to make him look at him. He wanted to see him. The angel understood anyway and locked his eyes with Dean’s. His chest felt hot and his lungs were like fire, it was so beautiful seeing these green eyes full of lust and pleasure. Dean’s pelvis moved slightly and Cas hit something in him causing him to moan very loudly. After his first encounters with Dean’s moan of pleasure he thought he had hurt him but soon discovered it was all but the contrary. He thrusted his cock in him, hitting the same spot, their breath mixing as Dean breathed out, holding Cas’ face as close to his as he could. As their foreheads touched each other, Castiel’s hand found Dean’s dick, stroking him. And just hearing the sounds coming out of his mouth, Cas moaned back. He felt like he was close.
“Hi Anja! Thanks for answering so fast!” Sam saluted her.
Dean wanted his final hunt to be great. And what could be greater than killing vamps
“Dean… there’s something wrong. He’s… he’s not waking up.” Sam explained.
“How did they get here so fast?”
“I’ve decided I’m going to bring him back.” He said, laying his mug down.
“Hmm…yeah?” he shook his head, as to get his thoughts in order, rubbing his eyes.
“It’s alright. I’ll get the cart. Get the big jar with the lamb’s blood.”
“Dean… I want to try something with you.” Castiel breathed. “From what I’ve read, I think you’ll like it… very much.”
“I’m ready.” Cas looked at Amara then at Dean. The human looked at him, scared but hopeful. “It’s okay, Dean.” he reached out to take Dean’s hand.
“It blinded her Dean, it blinded Eileen” Sam was crying “She can’t see. You should have seen her; she was so scared.” Dean hugged his brother, closing his eyes. Castiel was next to Eileen, his hands hovering over her head.
he thought.
“I could.”
“The what?” Dean mouthed at Sam, who shrugged as if to say ‘don’t ask me man’
Cas’s hand brushed his skin down to his waist, sending shivers down Dean’s body, stopping between his legs. With his other hand he grabbed some lube that he had bought during the week, hidden in the nightstand. Dean’s eyes registered the lube but the human couldn’t think clearly anymore. He looked at Cas’ hand and back at the blue in his eyes, pleading. Cas squeezed some lube on his fingers, rubbing it. Dean couldn’t say anything. He was scared and vulnerable.
“Rude.” Dean points a finger at Cas with a frown.
“Dean, although I…appreciate your willingness to finally address this, you should know I never expected you to reciprocate. And you may flatter yourself, but my current state has no relation to you or my…feelings regarding you.”
Dean pulls back. He and Cas stare at one another and Dean sees reflected in Cas’s eyes what he’s feeling: pure, unadulterated, passionate love. And maybe a little lust, but it’s mostly love, Dean swears.
“Oh.” Sam pauses. “Cool.” He brings the binoculars back to his eyes and looks behind the broken structure to the field beyond it. He suddenly tenses and inhales a sharp breath. “What—” he hisses out, incredulous.
3. Thank you for all the lovely comments!! All depressed angels deserve at least one (1) kitten.
Dean’s plodding along behind him, boots seemingly finding every single snappy stick on the forest floor. They’re not trying to be sneaky, but it’s habit now for them to try and walk lightly.
Dean and Eileen return one night in early April from a particularly bloody case involving a nest of vampires. Cas hears them come in, their voices muffled from down the hall. Cas thinks he should shut his bedside lamp off so he won’t attract Dean’s attention. Any conversation these days is a chore, but so is reaching over to turn off the lamp, so immobility wins and Dean predictably stops at Cas’s door.
“No!” Dean cuts in quickly. “No, you didn’t do anything. I’m not—“ He huffs out a breath that’s supposed to be a laugh but ends up sounding more like a stifled cry.
changed, because that would require Dean acknowledging that Cas told him in no uncertain terms that he loves him. Cas isn’t sure if he can be more explicit than that, if he can prove it any better than by being wrenched into oblivion for it.
Castiel holds the fry at eye level and peers dubiously at it. “I’m not sure—“
Cas leans forward, so tantalizingly slowly Dean thinks his whole chest might burst before they ever touch. They’re inches apart when Dean feels the first brush of skin on his bottom lip. Not Cas’s mouth, but his thumb. Dean opens his eyes (when had he closed them?) to see Cas studying him like he’s the most interesting thing in the world.
Dean frowns at that, a protest rising in his throat before he can remind himself that given the last three months, he has absolutely no leg to stand on. He
“What is it?” Cas asks.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees anyway. It’s then he realizes Cas’s right hand is still over his heart and Dean is still gripping his wrist. He moves that hand to Cas’s cheek, his thumb mimicking Cas’s from moments ago, ghosting his bottom lip. Cas’s breath catches and his eyes flutter closed, which Dean finds markedly arousing.
A silence stretches between them that Cas would usually fill with questions about Dean: if he’s okay, how the hunt went, if he needs anything. Instead, he listens to the sound of the central air kicking on and says nothing.
Cas accepts the truth with no discernable trouble and only falters on what to do with the information.
Dean snorts a laugh and follows behind Cas as he moves toward the syrups and pancake mixes. He picks up a bottle of the corn syrup-y stuff Dean is so fond of, and then his eyes follow the line of real maple syrup bottles on the top shelf.
Cas looks annoyed, but continues, “For lying to you.”
Dean’s not sure when it happened, but Cas’s left leg is up on the soft leather benchseat, his knee barely pressing against Dean’s thigh. His whole body is turned toward Dean, and the angle allows him to be closer.
Soon Dean’s wastefully large dinners start to grate on Cas’s nerves as it reminds him that he hasn’t had an appetite in days. Still, he pretends. He smiles warmly and says “thank you” and chews and swallows even when it goes down like gravel to sit heavy in his stomach. He goes through the motions, holding light conversations about nothing at all, waiting for some kind of resolution to this barren feeling inside him.
“I’m sure whatever you choose is fine, Dean. I trust you.” Cas’s soft rumble sates the gnawing anxiety in Dean’s gut.
Dean snorts a laugh. “Motel coffee. Smells like heaven, tastes like... Well, not quite like hell, but at least a kissing cousin.”
“Okay,” Dean says in surprise. “That’s, uh, great.”
“Free will was a mistake,” Cas mutters darkly, and he tosses one box into the cart at random and places the other back on the shelf.
Dean waves his hand. “It’s fine,” he says, perhaps too quickly. “It’s your pie anyway.” Cas retracts the spoon and twirls it between his fingers dexterously. Dean’s stomach does a little flip watching Cas’s slender fingers maneuver the utensil, which is ridiculous and Dean must be more tired than he thought.
“Use the fucking crutches!” Dean cries out, holding both arms out in distress.
“Yeah, we get Jack and he can… He can create angels, so he can create new grace for you.”
“If you guys are done being gross, we still have the movie to finish,” Sam says.
Cas barks a laugh, surprising himself and causing some of the cats to skitter away again in fright. “No, Dean wasn’t lying. But that was a feature of my grace, unfortunately. And I couldn’t
Cas blinks and takes a moment to come back to the present where he’s been pushing a single pea back and forth across his plate for the better part of an hour, everything else left untouched as conversation swirls around him. He’s been reacting appropriately, he thinks. He’s gotten his soft huffs of laughter, his thoughtful frowns, his grunts of affirmations down to a science, oftentimes reacting based on tone of voice alone to allow his mind to turn off; the act of keeping up a conversation is exhausting.
Cas leans down and presses a comparably chaste kiss against the side of Dean’s mouth. “Until later, then, Dean Winchester,” he murmurs.
“Yes,” Cas replies.
Cas frowns and turns his attention back to the kitten who has moved on to attacking the cuffs of Cas’s jeans. “So, we should put him back outside?”
