“Hm,” Peter drummed his fingers quickly against the countertop, then stopped.  He looked at the dishes in the sink.  He peered curiously into the skillet on the stove, where there was still a hash brown and two fried eggs.
“I’ve never seen my father offer somebody a job in his R&D department so fast in my life,” Harry said, with an uncomfortable smile.
“What are you doing here, Stark?  Why aren’t you with your friends?  …Why are you in
“You too-” Tony glanced at the young man’s name tag, “-O’Conner.”
“Have… have you even eaten yet?”  Tony interrupted, rubbing his face with one hand.
Steve took his hand, and pulled him forwards, guiding Tony back across his lap.
The Iron Horse Garage, 1:45 PM.
Steve laughed, and ran his hand along Tony’s chest and side, feeling the ways the addition of the shield had opened the familiar angles.
Pause.
“Actually… hit ‘D-9’ for me first, will ya?”  Tony decided, pointing to the jukebox.
Steve looked dubious, but let it go.
“DID it-” Fury snarled, fists on his hips, “-at any point occur ta you two
Tony assumed Murphy’s Law would kick in at any moment, but he was enjoying it while it lasted, safe behind the lenses of his dark sunglasses.
“I’d forgotten I had this…”  Tony said.
He’d occasionally been charged with property damage, and he’d put several people who had threatened his employers in the hospital, but War Machine had never been known to kill on purpose.  The darkest things on his record (officially, anyway) were the deaths of two known Maggia enforcers who had been standing near a heavy iron door when War Machine had repulsor-blasted it open.  Things like that, as Steve knew all too well, came with the territory.
“Where are they-” Peter peered out towards the lights of the bridge, and spotted movement, “-ah, there, right.  See ya-” -Thwip!-
“How does it feel?”  Steve asked.
Steve’s shield ended up hanging over the arm of a chair.
“Captain America named him that,” Tony said, pausing in mid-air to answer, “-we were all tired of calling him ‘that biker guy’ anyway…”
“Steve, how did he know where-” Tony began, knotting the belt as he turned.  He caught sight of Peter, and stared.  “-Are you being followed?”  Tony demanded, quickly.
“Yeah, I did.”
“You know, I only know one song on this entire list,” Steve said, from over by the jukebox.
“…You like
Tony yelled, speaking directly onto the police-band radio frequency.
Zeppelin’s
“Yeah, dat freak’s crazy, we don’t owe him nothin’ either,” the coward from earlier agreed.
Harry and MJ began a sudden and frantic discussion over how to accomplish this, on a jukebox that was already
The halls were choked with dust from the explosions, and a fire had started somewhere, adding the futuristic tang of burnt plastic to the scent of war Steve knew all too well.
MJ waited for Harry to continue, but he didn’t.  It wasn’t fair of her, she -knew- that… Harry had been hurt badly on the edge of a superhero battle the day before, and this thing with his dad on top of it…
War Machine took off in a new direction, pushing his bootjets to the very outer edge of their range.
“…*…Uh?”  Tony responded, unconvinced.
Stealthily, he began spinning a canopy of web over the entire battlefield, thin-stranded but strong.
,” Tony nodded sleepily, “-did it jus’ fine.”
Peter replied, surprised.
“Pretty much,” Tony smirked, without turning around.
“So I guess that means you outrank me,” Steve said with a grin, picking up where he’d left off on his tool-cleaning.
Luke began.
He’d never been the same, though.
…And breathed.
“Yeah, so when you go off to jail this time, you might want to think about a career change,” Spider Man advised him.
“Both Aunt May and MJ called me this morning,” Harry continued, running a hand through his hair distractedly, “-I told them you and Tony were staying with some friends of Steve’s and that I didn’t have the number…”
there, you know?  I can’t fly for real,” Jerome explained.
“You forgot Germanium, and Vibranium is
“…That you can trust?”  Tony supplied.
Steve put his jacket down, found a clean red rag in a bin by the small pneumatic air compressor, and started wiping down the tools in Tony’s big red roll-around toolbox.
Fury stared back at Steve across the table, and held his well-chewed cigar in the fingers of his right hand thoughtfully.
“You’re hired,” Tony said, flatly.
“…I said that out loud?”  Peter squeaked.
Oh for god’s sake…  they DIDN’T…
Peter nodded.
, is the entrepreneurial spirit of the city of New York in action,” Tony said, adding the electric bill to the top of the pile, “-check the company names and dates against that list of bills you remember paying before the garage burned.”
It was a distraction.  A slow burn.  A promise.
Steve’s loft, 7:20 PM (same day).
“Ya know what?  I -like- that idea.  C’mere, let’s you and me go have a little ‘chat’…”  Fury growled.
The radio clicked off.
“Turn it up.”
“No, I was out looking for the Green Goblin.  …Come to think of it, you window guys probably see a lot up here, don’t you?”  Tony guessed.
F-2       The Battle of Evermore        Led Zeppelin
Tony took a breath.
Both Steve and Lt. Farrell had been familiar with rank structures long enough to know a rhetorical question when they heard one.
“How does cinnamon toast grab you?”  Tony suggested, instead.
be just the glow of the bulbs that I can see, magnified…”  Tony mused.
“Ooo, I like that song,” Warbird said, taking the record from her.
Tony chewed on his lower lip for a moment, considering.
Which… was a good thing in hindsight, because getting caught breaking into a coffee machine while holding a large hockey bag containing Iron Man’s armor and the Midnight Racer’s helmet and hoverboard would have been…
He took off his red gauntlets one by one and let them fall, dead weight.
“Right.  -Thank you.”  Tony replied, automatically.
Tony ordered, and blasted up out of the hydrant-spray, shattering the water into a spreading nimbus lit from within.
“No,” Tony agreed.
“Whadda you think, Cap?”  Fury challenged, “-or do you gotta go talk it over with somebody -first-?”
The Helicopter was thrown forwards by the blast, and it pin-wheeled in midair for a few seconds before the pilots’ regained control.  Hawkeye shut his eyes tight, gripped the overhead bar, and put his free hand over his mouth quickly.
“I can fix it later,”  Tony agreed.
“Agent Sharon Carter, sir.  I’m with SHIELD.”
He’d broken up what he’d been told was a riot at a small college campus, and learned that two of the Red Skull’s henchmen had been behind the whole thing.
“It’s good to see you again,” Tony said, simply.
“Soho, it looked like, but he coulda turned off later,” Jerome admitted.
.  Peter borrowed it for me last week, remember?”
“Yeah, you should have seen SHIELD’s title before they made it into an acronym,” Tony snorted, “-but this is Reed Richards’s new book.”
“Who are you
“That is a- fine idea, and it did occur to me,” Peter assured him, “-eventually.  But the problem was there was -ice- under the bridge.  And it fell off.  And I webbed, but the angle was too low.”
…Had that thing just jumped to light speed somehow?  Tony wondered, his eyes widening a little.  Or- -had he just witnessed the opening of a wormhole?  Why a light flash in -that- spectral range, instead of the ripple of a space/time distortion effect?
He smeared on the last of it, and wiped his face with the back of his wrist, staring at the hard design in front of him without seeing the wet, contrasting paint on his left hand.
Steve’s stride broke into a run, and he reached the fallen figure in seconds.  He’d been right, Iron Man wasn’t a robot.  Somewhere inside that suit of armor- -a red and gold affair that would have done Flash Gordon proud- -there was a living man.  From the sound of his breathing there might not be for very much longer, unless…
Peter finished the pancake, and Steve’s orange juice.
“Harry came back to rescue me when I fought the Green Goblin downtown the other night.  I mean, he didn’t know I was Spider-Man, he was just looking for Peter Parker, and since I was in costume at the time, of course he
Peter put his hand down too, eyes shining.
“-Just so you know, I’ve been waiting to tell you about this…”  Tony explained clearly, “-and it has
If his targets just kept jinking around like that…
, not jump-start something as sophisticated as the arc.”
“I just finished,” Tony lied automatically, then corrected, “-with… what I’m doing on it tonight, I mean.”
“Sensitive?”  Steve asked.
“Oh yeah, you’ve got that new Avenger induction ceremony…  How did War Machine get picked for that, anyway?”  Peter asked curiously, beginning to peel and eat the banana he’d grabbed earlier.
“-Later,” Steve smiled, standing, “-come back to bed and watch the news with me.  We’re in it.”
feel…”  Peter muttered, trudging upstairs anyway.
Luke shouted into his wristband, putting a boot gently but firmly on the neck of one of the thugs who had begun to inch away.
Then he yanked down on Steve’s shirt a few more inches, and kissed him deeply.
Questions pounded in his Harry’s skull like the headache behind his eyes.  He checked his watch again, but it didn’t make the garage door open.
Tony was THERE, at the concert, AS Iron Man.
Tony admitted, a slight exhalation of air that sounded as if it -felt- good to make.
“-Right,” Steve placed a small kiss against the side of Tony’s neck just because he could, then walked past him towards the kitchen.
Tony almost wished he could call the hostile alien craft back and ask.
A brief knock, metal on metal with a great deal of carefully-controlled power behind it.
Two looters, encased in web along with the color TV they were in the act of stealing, suspended from a lamppost.
Both of them were happier to look down at the ring than make eye contact right now.
Steve darted into the alleyway beside the garage, and up the fire escape of the building next door to the rooftops.  Down in the garage, he found Tony looking thoughtfully at a stilled clock sitting on the same shelf as the striker for his propane torch.
Jarvis’s fond smile was quiet and contained.  He was slightly balder than when Tony had seen him last, but he’d aged well, and the solid lines of the RAF boxing champion Jarvis had once been were not altogether lost beneath the rounded corners.
“-Yeah,”  Steve admitted,  “The Avengers do assist SHIELD sometimes, but I get the feeling that Fury’s been trying to put things past me that he wouldn’t have tried on Ms. Van Dyne and the others, and I don’t like it.”
fliers seemed a deadly impossibility.  Then they vanished, disappearing into the forest of buildings on the other side.
Steve had rarely seen another man’s crotch at close range before, and never when he was allowed to stare openly.  He
“The best,” Tony agreed, without hesitation.
-Shit-
Tony asked.
“-Mmm,” Tony murmured, approvingly.
“-And if War Machine never existed, you’d still have a face,” Tony cut her off.
“-You’re welcome,” he said, with a smile that could be heard.
Steve took a steadying breath.
“Hmm.  Then it
Tony sat happily on the floor in boxers and Steve’s blue bathrobe, eating General Tso’s chicken out of a take-out carton by the light of his arc reactor.  The only other light in the room came from a small bulb under the range hood, ill-equipped to illuminate even the whole kitchen.  The diffuse light of the city beyond the windows was more than enough for Steve’s keen night vision though, and Tony liked watching him move in low light, a big pale shadow, light on his feet, and topped with shifting hints of reflected gold and silver.
He remembered the battle that followed- -one of his earliest as Iron Man- -and the hate and confusion in the eyes of a drug-poisoned schoolteacher when he had finally taken the madman down.
“I’m in high school,” Peter pointed out, “-and from the looks of these I doubt you could pay me right now anyway.”
He saw a tall corner apartment building that lit the streets on both sides of it in crawling tangerine-yellow, and painted the upturned faces of the grim firemen.
…I’ll think of
“I…”  Harry looked up, his eyes clearer, “-yeah, I guess I am,” he smiled, wryly.
without really being what he wanted to
what you’re doing, you know.”
Tony was a unique texture, at least in Steve’s experience.  Soft skin over firm muscle, sweat-slick, with a tantalizing scrape of dark body hair trapped in between, everywhere but nowhere thickly, until it-
“Cross SHIELD, the Army, and Stark Industries off your list, and go from there,” Tony suggested, dryly.
“I’m sorry, what…?"  Tony blinked.
“-Then I would be honored,” Tony promised, after a pause.
Steve timed his steps to open the distance between them again, and looked into Tony’s face silently as the last four lines repeated as an ending chorus.
“-Oh yeah.”
Harry ran, and felt like a coward anyway.
him.  Very, very much.
“Peter’s definitely picked up on the fact that you don’t trust War Machine, but I should have handled this problem when it first came up…”
A hero, who walked in shadow.  A great war, and troops called up.  The angels of Avalon- -why did that make him think of Spitfire?  A tyrant, whose face was red.  -Boy, did that strike home…
“Get out of my house, Stark.”
“Is he all right?”  Danny asked, relaxing after he saw Iron Man look up.
Tony sat back down on the smooth concrete floor beside the jukebox, and leaned his head back against the dented wall, shutting his eyes for a moment.
Pause.

them that made Tony stop moving.
There was large shape curled up on the foot of the bed, cocooned in the blankets.
Maybe if he could just get this out of his system…
“A very good evening to you, and… circumstances permitted,”  Jarvis shrugged,  “-thanksgiving is an
Tony spotted a coffee cup in the sink, and sniffed it.  Something with chicken.  He didn’t remember drinking that, and obviously Steve had put the cup in there… had they been talking about the ring last night?  Had he, on top of everything
“You have to know that I’ve condoned its use for a pillow, a lunch-table, an umbrella, an operating table, and a children’s sled…”
Steve broke the kiss after a long moment, then gave him another one just as good.
“-Spider?”
An underline to exactly how much this project was pissing him off.
“Hi,” Steve whispered.
“And since this fuel flow valve defaults to ‘full open’ when there’s no current,” Peter said, pointing awkwardly around Tony’s hand to the appropriate place on the diagram, “-it basically flooded his engine.”
“You WHAT?”  Peter exclaimed.
Spider Man, Misty Knight, Iron Man, Elektra, Power Man, Iron Fist, Hawkeye…
The song’s oddly new/old shimmer came and went, wrapping itself around the drums and vocals in bright, lingering bursts.  Steve delayed a back step momentarily.  Tony stepped in closer at the invitation, then maintained the new distance.  He felt the warmth of the left side of Steve’s face in the air near his, and smiled quietly.
“I can’t read Vietnamese,” Harry objected, frowning at the list.
“Okay, ah… I brought your record back,” she said.
Steve’s eyes took in the office swivel-chair out in the middle of the oil-stained concrete floor, and the pieces of Tony’s red and gold armor scattered on the ground by the pulled-out jukebox.  He smelled whiskey, and without looking, Steve knew that there would be nothing wrong with the garage door.
Steve unfolded his arms and came over- -he’d been hanging back from what looked like a very private ritual- -to help Tony look.  He didn’t find the helmet, but he did see something that looked disturbingly like a remote bomb detonator.
“-Do I?”
?          Iron Man                          Black Sabbath
…Which worked fine, until his enemy dived sideways with both red-gloved hands outstretched, and grabbed something in the tangle of blankets trailing off the side of the bed.
Whitney laughed, and it made both of the guys smile.  Women were like that, sometimes.  Just… great ambiance.
Abruptly, the man’s head blew off.
There was a fading scent of incense in the still air, and the distant, orderly confusion of mid-morning traffic below on forty-second street.
Turning and cutting power quickly, Tony dropped heel-first onto War Machine’s still-hot unibeam lens and fired his bootjet, using his hand repulsors to keep from actually taking off.
“Bye Cap- -er- -Steve,” amended Peter.
-about heroes, some of whom could fly.
Well probably, but it would hardly be fair to break up with her

Tony’s eyes focused forwards as he flew, actually squinting a little against the glare of the metal-fire, isolated in the darkness.
…Where the actual
“So, what
Steve hung his scale mail shirt over a hook on the back of the closet door and paused, head slightly to one side, listening.
“Enlightening,” Steve replied, unzipping his bomber jacket and folding it over one arm.  “-But it’s good to be back.”
Tony gave Lt. Farrell the rest of his thoughts on the two Goblin Gliders and the wrecked vapor-atomization chamber outside, and… waited.  He sat on one of the fire truck’s highly-polished steel running boards in jeans and a green, open-collared shirt he’d borrowed from Danny Rand that morning and felt decidedly… -naked-.
“Which way was he headed?”
“Were you any good?”  Tony asked.
Steve folded his arms, smiling quietly.
“…Though it does look pretty cool, and um- -thanks for thinking of me?”  Peter amended, smiling winningly.
“I’ll get right on that,” Tony agreed, taking the card.
Tony watched Steve’s lips close around the mouth of the brown glass bottle, and swallowed.
“Yeah…”  Steve slid his hands around the small of Tony’s back, warm under the envelope of the jacket.
Steve looked down at his right hand.  Balanced, strong, capable.  He’d worked out that morning at the Avengers gym, and he could feel the difference that made, the way the fibers that held his hand together inside were just a little looser, a little more awake.  That didn’t happen automatically.  Hank didn’t use half of what he had.
was blowing him.
Peter’s photo-developing chemicals- -had he left them under the sink again, or had they been in the hazmat locker?  Photo paper…
Especially since Steve seemed to wa-ohmygod…
“…Thank you?  Peter said, after a pause.
Tony glanced back at him.  He replaced the carafe, and pressed the ‘on’ switch.
“That’s not some weird double-entendre, is it?  Because if it is-” Peter began, reddening.
“Notta chance.  There’s pancakes,” Tony pointed, without getting up.
on a girder planted in the sidewalk to the dump-truck’s left.
Wanda stifled a giggle.
“The hell they were!”  Iron Man cut him off, speaking both loudly enough to be heard over the idling rotors and directly onto the helicopter’s designated radio frequency.
The steady beat of the heart monitor was the only sound in the room.
“What was a picture of a girl in her dainties doing between the pages of an encyclopedia?”  Steve asked, not quite laughing.
A firing order and hasty cross-chatter about resisting arrest and probable escape trajectories assaulted his ears.  Something exploded down and to the left of him…  and in two more heartbeats, he was well out of range.
Sam looked nonplussed, and folded his arms.
The door opened, but it had opened for someone who had a key, and that light, almost casual booted tread was unmistakably Steve’s.  Tony kept sketching out the details of his invention- -inventions, now- on the open space left on the back of the flyer.
Tony blinked,
, Tony judged.  Maybe not long on brains, but the kid thought on his feet.
“No, it’s -jinxed-,” Peter argued, “-every time you build a new suit of armor, the freezer goes out.  It’s like rain and a freshly waxed car…”
swirl of hair, bright as summer wheat straw, against skin Tony hadn’t once thought Steve would want to see, let alone
“Yeah, go ahead…”  Tony nodded, licking his lips.
“He was waiting for me, Iron Man.  I ordered him back here after we lost the Green Goblin,” Steve explained.
“Oh,” Harry sounded a little crestfallen.
“Think fast,” Tony advised, dryly.  “-I’m dating Steve, you know.”
that, can’t you?”  Tony observed, skating over in full armor minus his helmet.
Peter kept his silence.
“…I need a longer cord,” Tony decided, frowning and moving back.  “…This’s a twelve.  Need to make a fifteen, maybe a twenty…”
“Crrrcrrrkck- -on Man, come in?”

“Don’t do this, Pym.”
God, when had things gotten so
-Eyebrows like that would need charcoal, Steve thought, automatically.
This tower really wasn’t Hank’s, it was -Jan’s-.
Steve thought of the way he’d let Bucky bum cokes off of him when he’d wanted to make sure the boy wouldn’t disappear.
the- -oh, the heck with it…
“You sure it was a dude?”
“What are you reading now?”  Steve asked, sitting back again.
“Well, between Peter… and you, and me and… Hank Pym… I think Harry could be in far worse hands.”
“…And ah- my cellmate used to bring me breakfast while I was recovering from this,” Tony added, tapping his chest just beside the arc reactor.
Somewhere like…
“Are you trying to hint that I’m outnumbered, here?”  Peter asked, uneasily.
“All right,” Steve said, gauging the dogged look in Tony’s eyes.
, letting this come to a head now could only serve as a distraction.  And they had a Goblin to catch.
“Mmph-! …Mm,” he glanced down at the cup dubiously, and dabbed his mustache with the edge of his bathrobe sleeve.  “-Ahem.  So, you fell in the river…”
Nobody was listening, and half the people on the ground were already racing back for the chopper.
“You’ve got to get him under water!”  Fury shouted, from over near the freight elevator.
His hands were everywhere, and in no hurry.  He ran them lightly across the quiet definition of Tony’s stomach, stroked them up the backs of his thighs, brushed the hard crease between Tony’s hip and thigh with his thumb…
“It’s old,” Tony shrugged, without looking up from his repulsor-gauntlet wiring.
A superhero.
“Ol’ Shellhead brought’cha in.  He’s waitin’ outside, actually,” Ben said, jerking a thumb towards the room’s only door.
much,” Steve took a breath.
The Iron Horse Garage, 4:02 AM (next day).
“This,” Steve said sheepishly, letting go entirely and putting his hands over Tony’s eyes.
The Green Goblin wasn’t liking the way the odds were shifting.  He WANTED the Midnight Racer.  He wanted him dead in so many ways.  That sneaking, thieving, indecisive, no talent
breakfast.
“Y- yeah almost, but can leave I these up to dry until-” Peter began.
“Hey!”  Tony called, striding over with barely-controlled annoyance, “-can I help you with something?”
“-Exhaust system’s different…”  Tony muttered, brushing ash off the second Goblin glider with his fingers, “-the other one would’ve been faster, but it probably turned like a seven-forty-seven…”
He patted ineffectually at the snooze button, and accidentally hit the corner of the clock with the base of his palm.
“Oh yeah, are you kidding me?”  Tony assured her, “-I just meant you’ll have to wait until I can fabricate things again for the fine work.  I can patch it up now, no problem.”
Tony instantly ducked his head out of line with the garage security camera, and shielded his face with his arm.  The damage, if that thing was on, had already been done.
“Well, I just got it, and I’m not sure the adjustment on the clutch is right,” Cap said aloud, but passed Tony a handwritten note with a significant look.
him…”  Tony hissed, softly.
Tony blinked, not realizing he’d spoken aloud, then shut his eyes as he felt Steve’s fingers gently cupping the back of his neck, lowering him down the rest of the way.  Tony’s back popped twice, and he groaned softly.
Pause.
Outside the Iron Horse Garage, 8:43 AM (same day).
Steve poured himself a glass of orange juice, and watched Tony from the table for a while.  It felt like something he should remember.
The Iron Horse Garage, 2:41 PM.
Needed to get out of here.  Now.
Tony shrugged modestly, and gave Steve a dazzling smile… to avoid making eye contact of
Less than two minutes later, Iron Man was there.  And
“Oh, right,” Tony handed Harry a twenty, and the three of them left.
Nice lips, definitely.  Well shaped, and the lower one was full.
The exo-suit facing them was massive, at least twelve feet tall with shoulder-mounted rotary guns, and far bulkier than Tony’s Iron Man armor.  …It
“TONY!”
Tony took the receipt the cashier handed him across the counter, and barely looked at it before folding the slip of paper into his wallet.
“Ohhh…!”
Tony squinted against the too-bright kitchen lights overhead.  It was a modern room, with a long white sweep of contoured cabinets, a steel-topped kitchen island, and an espresso machine.  Jan had gotten tired of the 1960’s primary colors thing, apparently…
“…You’re seriously not going to take it,” Harry realized, looking at him a little puzzled.
anything, that I know of…  Between us, I don’t think I would have caught him anyway.  He was there and gone in a moment, like this shadow racing across the moon…”
“That’s me,” Tony agreed, casually.
Minutes…
“NO, goddammit, I wouldn’t have BOTCHED the job!  Now get your flag unwound and tell me what that magma dragon did ta to Wall Street!”  Fury barked.
“-That would make you the artist,” Tony said as he returned Harry’s handshake.
Steve left his bike, and pounded on the roll-down garage door with the side of his fist.
okay?”
‘im.  That fucker brings the heat down anyway.  Word is he torched that warehouse he was usin’ himself an’ flew off in different threads.”
He came downstairs half an hour later, after a round of very passable banana-walnut pancakes.  Tony was snoring gently, and he didn’t appear to have moved.
True, Spider-man was probably behind this -somehow-… but the Racer had tricked him, had made him take revenge on the wrong people -first-, like a fool…
Steve looked up, and smiled.
“You’re wrong, Iron Man!  You’re abandoning-” the copilot began.
“For being well-read.  It’s kind of nice to talk to somebody who is, on something besides science.”
Tony’s bedroom, 10:40 PM.
It was basically a glorified vending machine incapable of dispensing any beverage worth paying for anyway, but it was failing at even -that- simple task.   It would humm, make promising clicks, and- -drip ineffectively.
“What if I never do?”  Steve asked, seriously.
War Machine waited, facing the floor to ceiling windows that ran the length of the entire west wall.  A number of couches and chairs were clumped stylishly in the room behind him, but as sturdy as they looked, they hadn’t been built with eight foot tall powersuits in mind.  The sun didn’t discriminate however, hanging low along the horizon beneath a magnificent pile of red-orange clouds.
“Never mind, I’ll come down through the skylight and help you fix it,” Steve promised.
The soaped window of a building that had been broken into, from the inside.
Tony poured his coffee, and the underside of the gold band on his finger clinked quietly against the ceramic mug’s handle.
“Hey- -hey, Iron Man?”  Spider Man broke in, loping up to him.
Steve suffered a brief relapse, then collected himself during the next few bars.
“Mmmm… this feels better without metal in the way,” Steve smiled against Tony’s shoulder.
Iron Man pointed out, dryly.
It was a long red slash, running from a hands’ breadth to the right of the center of his chest, to the outer edge of his right shoulder.  Blood didn’t show up well against black leather.  It absorbed, spread, and slid off with the wind shear of his movements.
“You’re forgiven,” she smiled, and meant it.  MJ pressed his fingers with hers, then released his hand and went to open the door.
A nurse opened the door quickly, without knocking, and paused.
“Are you sure?”  Steve frowned.
“-Ah,” Tony nodded once, amused.
to do with your little ‘interrogation’ fantasy.”
Before his quarry had flown straight into- -and apparently
to be hung over.  Curiouser and curiouser.
“It was nice meeting you, Peter,” Steve said, turning.
The night air was cooler than Tony remembered, and wetter.  It cleared his head a little.
Okay, that was good.
“M’kay…”  Harry frowned, doubtfully.
-Whatever jazz record Steve had put on in the meantime wasn’t bad either, but he’d be damned if he’d admit that without a decent break-in period.
The 1950's-era encyclopedia set with the condescendingly-captioned pic of a Polynesian girl was a real thing, unfortunately.
Steve began fitting Tony’s hands through the arm straps above his head.
each other,” Tony breathed.
He was wearing his tan trench coat unbuttoned over his costume, and he looked tired in a way that would have been difficult for a stranger to see.
Tony heard Peter’s voice and felt the chill of the room simultaneously.  He hissed sharply through his teeth, and snatched the blue bathrobe off the floor.
“I’ll remember you said that, Private Rogers,” Tony promised.
"So were you,” Tony said, looking at him sidelong.
“Hey boss-?”  Peter said, hesitantly.
had come along with a blessed infusion of
“…No,” he sighed, “-you haven’t either, I take it.”
And then he was coming, hard and hot against Tony’s stomach, pressing down closer and sliding his dick forcefully against Tony’s in a broken rhythm he soon lost- -and Tony picked up.
Steve remembered what an active agent tasted like.  Something between getting pure carbonation out of a soda fountain without the syrup, the slight choke of chalk dust, and something …sharper.  Dangerous.  Something that burned and numbed at the same time, yet still left a slight tang in his mouth, like powdered lemon soap.
Tony snorted, and wiped up the last of the spilled coffee.
A smile spread quietly across his face.
“-Pleased to meet you, sir,” Peter added.
“What’s the problem?”  Cap asked, quickly.
“I sent the kid home early yesterday.  I figured anything serious enough to keep you from answering…”  Tony trailed off grimly.
He shut his Harley off, and walked up to the damaged door.  The circular saw inside fell silent.
, he could do.
Luke set the slightly bent forklift down, and looked around for stragglers.  The one who’d gotten the worst of the earlier collision was getting his bearings now, but he took one look at the forklift driver, then another at Iron Fist dragging his three remaining allies out of the shadows by two right wrists and a -foot-, and surrendered quickly.
“You should see this,” Steve said, climbing back onto the bed and sitting up cross-legged against the headboard, newspaper in hand.
When he made it to Steve’s door he hesitated. “Are you sure about this? You don’t have to if you're not ready.”
“What do you think you are doing?”
Their scientific mutterings were interrupted by a hitched breath they both turned and saw Bucky was curled up on himself again, he had his wings plastered to his back so tightly you could see that they were shaking with the effort his muscles used to keep them close to his body, which was wracking with his silent sobs and effort to calm his frantic breathing. Tony immediately moved to action with Bruce but he worked opposite of Bruce, while the scientist took a look at what had happened and getting a reading on blood pressure, oxygen levels, heart rate, all that good stuff. Tony worked to calm Bucky down he made sure that Bucky could see him at all times and he made eye contact and asked before he touched him. Tony knew what this was, he had suffered enough panic attacks to see the symptoms. He continued to soothe Bucky and he told him where he was and what year it was along with the fact that he was safe, Tony had created a protocol for J.A.R.V.I.S to relay the same information when he would wake up from a nightmare or had an attack, he would have to enact the protocol on Bucky's floor in case this happened while Tony or the others weren’t around and couldn’t help.
“I have you on a hormone stabilizer that should help with the aggression and hopefully the arousal.”
Without warning Tony got up off of Steve’s lap and pulled Steve to follow into the bedroom with him, Tony sat Steve on the bed and left to go into the bathroom where Steve heard him turn on the water. Steve was thoroughly confused by the time Tony returned with a basin of water and some towels. Tony climbed into the bed behind Steve and it clicked, Tony was going to wash his wings. Steve hadn’t gotten them cleaned since before the battle so they needed it. Steve felt tears in his eyes, Tony was too good for him. Here he was, worried about how Steve’s wings are doing and willing to wash them for him after all the grief Steve had caused him in the past two days.
Steve woke to unbearable pain in his back, His sheets clung to his skin with how much he was sweating. He had to decide what to do, He
Bucky went back to the workshop, after wrestling Steve into a horizontal position on the couch and gave him a shower and a meal replacement drink. He went over to Tony’s desk, on it there were a million papers everywhere, notes scribbled in Tony’s familiar chicken scratch. Bucky put his hands on the desk and lowered his head, he needed to find Tony.
“You are going to feel so good, all open and slick for me.” he leaned down and captured her lips in a dirty kiss, the taste of her pleasure shared between them.
“Thank you for this Tony.”
“I’m good, and i think you should stay in that cell until we have all of this figured out.” Steve was glad that nothing happened, but he couldn’t help but feel saddened at the rejection, even if it wasn’t directed at him. The other him, he really needs to come up with a better name for the guy, starts his slow pacing of the cell.
"Please lower the temperature a little Jarvis." When the water is lowered to a more bearable temperature, He proceeds to reach behind him to work out the many out of place feathers and wash them off. when he got out and dried his body, he caught his eye in the mirror before a loud "Thwack!" Filled the room. Water sprayed off of his wings spattering the mirror with small droplets.
Steven watched as Rogers walked over to the bed where Tony was now lounging and idly stroking his cock as he watched the two of them. Rogers stepped up to Tony and Tony licked his lips before he took Rogers into his mouth again, he timed his hand with the movement of his mouth and soon Rogers was making moans. Tony quickened the pace, but his hand stayed in rhythm. Rogers’ hips stuttered and he threw his head back as he came down Tony’s throat, Steven saw Tony's Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed all of Rogers’ cum and then pulled off with a wet sound. Tony started to move his hand faster, but Rogers caught his wrist and leaned over to whisper something in his ear that made him groan and stop jerking himself altogether. Rogers backed away and walked over to where Steven was still laying on the floor, he crouched down and effortlessly picked Steven’s limp body up, then tossed him on the bed like a sack of potatoes, Steven landed on the other side of Tony.
“He has broken ribs and I think a punctured lung, he was coughing up blood when he was still conscious.” Steve told to Bruce and the various medical staff that began fluttering around the unconscious man that Steve laid on the stretcher.
“I'm Steve, we- they- I am one person again.”
“You better keep those wings clean, or so help me I will pluck you myself!” there was a beat of silence and then a flutter of wings and Steve running up the stairs to get ready. Bucky sent out a alert to the team and followed to get ready himself.
All eyes turned to Tony. Steve and Bucky both had their wings up and were twitching them, bracing for a fight. Tony however was looking down at her new breasts, she brought her hands up and cupped the swells of flesh which were barely contained by her black tank top. She glanced up, hands still cupped around her boobs and zoned in on Steve.
“Hey, I'm still here you know,” Tony had the cutest pouty face and Steve leaned down to give him a kiss too, then Bucky leaned over and did the same.
“Well, either way let's get some rest and then go see Bruce and Loki in the morning so they can tell us if it has something to do with the magic."
(See the end of the chapter for
“You look like a fish out of water.” That brought Tony back down to earth, and he snapped back.
“The team should know.” Steve’s sudden comment caught Tony off guard, his fingers stilled in Steve’s feathers where they had been mindlessly petting the soft wing draped over him.
When Tony woke again The alarm was going off and Steve was already in his suit, that was not a good sign. Tony got out of bed and pressed the button in the wall to call the suit, when they were both suited up and flying to where the attack was happening was when Tony finally found out what they were up against.
"Damnit! Jarvis, why am I locked out of my own system?" Tony's voice growled out into the otherwise, silent lab.
Tony’s eyes then moved to the final person in the room, Steve. Being the old man that he was Steve insisted on reading an actual copy of the paper instead of reading it on one of the many Stark tablets scattered all around the tower. Steve was in his running clothes. A grey tee stretched across his broad shoulders, the fabric clinging to his body like a second skin (geeze, didn’t Steve know that they had more than one size of shirt, not that he was complaining). Lines of strong muscles trail down to a pair of navy-blue joggers resting on his ridiculously small waist.
Steve reaches behind himself and takes Tony into his hand, he lines Tony up with his hole and slides down.
When he arrived Tony and Bucky were in the middle of what looked like a food fight with the flour, they were both laughing and Tony had so much flour in his hair he looked like he had white hair, the look contrasted with the youthful glee plastered on his face. His eyes caught Steve in the doorway and waved him in to the kitchen.
“You didn’t know? interesting.” Loki seemed happy with the information he was given. “why don’t we give him a visit, captain.” There was a flash of green light and they both were gone.
“We entered through the back and took out the guards standing post to the doors, there are rooms which appear to be offices. Currently searching for information.”
When Tony woke up, he was in the guest bed of Steve’s floor in the middle of a super soldier sandwich. Steven was passed out in front of him with a calm smile on his features, which were smoothed from sleep. He could feel from behind him that Rogers was hard and ready to go again. Tony pushed his ass back into the cradle of Rogers’ hips and Rogers hummed while he came awake to the feeling of Tony’s naked ass rubbing his hard cock.
“what do you mean, another like me?” Steve questioned. Loki grinned again and the feeling in his gut came back.
“yea- yes, th..they did.” once Bucky could speak he wobbled out a few words that broke Tony’s heart, he was going to burn Hydra to the ground, after he cut their dicks off and forced them down their own throats. Tony hugged Bucky and smoothed a hand over his sweat damp hair in an effort to quiet him.
The next pair was plain and pink cotton that Steve liked better, the only thing was the color. It hurt her eyes to look at and she couldn’t imagine the color not showing through any pants that she might be wearing.
“Ok, Steve. I’m going to massage the gland now.” Steve made a cute little approving noise in the back of his throat.
“Do not cry, it has been long since then and though they still hold a piece of my heart with each of them I have found that time makes all easier. that was only the story of my first born there is 4 more, do you still wish to continue?”
"OK team I think we definitely earned some dinner and then a team movie night," Tony announced once they had all got in the quinjet and were on their way back to the tower "what should we order today? I was feeling like Thai."
“H-he said ‘our child’, but Tony is the father. He was the one who fucked me last night, you just watched.” Steve fidgeted under the gaze of his lovers, both men made eye contact over Steve’s hunched shoulders before Tony broke the silence.
He got up and went into his bathroom and turned around to look at his back in the large mirror behind the sink. His back was red and inflamed near his shoulders and looked puffy and bloated.
"I don't see anything too troubling, just some inflammation. I would like to continue to monitor it though, and if the pain gets worse come to me immediately."
“What the hell Tony, are you blind!” Clint dropped his bow and pointed to Loki like a little kid. “Can you not see the guy that tried to take over the world is sitting on your couch?”
“Spit it out, what do you think is going to happen?” Steve’s blood feels like it is boiling, like he is back in an ally during ‘38 and he is fighting three guys bigger than him.
“There you go, now, I didn’t tell you right away because you were sleeping for the first time since the fight and you needed it. Secondly, if you hadn’t worked yourself so hard I would have, but you are no use in helping Tony if you can’t keep your head up.” Bucky gave Steve a glare but ran his hand through the soft golden hair.
They moved forward and both gave Nat and Pepper kisses on the cheek respectively before the impatient look on Bucky's face broke them apart and they opened the back door to let him see Steve.
Bucky looked at Tony to see his answer, he looked contemplative and unusually serious, but then he nodded his head and grabbed the tablet off of the bedside table to work on while he sat at the other corner of the bed. He was present, but would likely not participate in the conversation, having his presence be there, but not intruding on them and the same time not being left out of the loop.
“-eve? Honey? You have to breathe for me baby, come on, I know you can. Remember how you breathe when your asthma acts up. Yes, there you go darling. Good job, doing so well for me. Can I touch you?” Steve nods his head and Bucky moves forward, makes sure to telegraph all his movements and keeps from grabbing at Steve, even if that is all he wants to do. Grab the man and never let him go, curl up in a giant ball of feathers and never come out.
"I'm going to try to fly."
The brunet's eyes were closed in pleasure but the blond was looking at him with love in his eyes. Bucky had never seen that in something like this before, they were usually just women with breasts the size of watermelons and guys with dicks the length of their arm, never anything like this. Not even in Steve’s drawings.
They spend the rest of the night drinking the whiskey on the fire escape and talking to each other while they watch the fireworks. It is sometime around midnight when the festivities stop and both of them are thoroughly drunk and tired, Bucky has to carry Steve into the apartment and lay him down on their single mattress that they share. He leaves to turn off the radio and shut the window when he sees the drawing on the table from earlier, Bucky picks it up and looks at it. Both of the men are handsome and Bucky can feel himself getting hard from looking at them, when he looks at the faces trying to figure out who Steve based them on (because he
I hope you enjoy!
"FUCK!"
"Sir is sending a jet to pick him up four days from now."
“Tony?” Steve’s voice wavered. Tony looked up into his scared blue eyes. “I-I think I’m... stuck.” Steve was looking down at where they were connected and tried to pull away again. No luck. Steve started to panic again, His breath caught in his chest.
Tony nodded and walked off deeper into the lab to his area, his mind already running with the information he was given. Steve wasn't due for his bi-monthly check up with Bruce for 2 weeks he knew because he made sure to be in his lab so he could get a glimpse of those abs as the doctor worked on him. And no, he wasn't stalking or obsessed with Steve, he just could appreciate the aesthetic pleasure of viewing human perfection.
"Yes, the first measurements shows a 6 foot wingspan, whilst the measurements from today show an 9-10 foot wingspan. in order to fly I calculate a 20 foot wingspan is needed." Steve cautiously looks over his shoulder at the wings. They were already too big to hide, but he couldn't imagine what a 20 foot wingspan would be like.
“Not that you can’t come and visit big guy, but why did you decide to drop by?”
“Tony, what did you do?”
Bucky came back to himself slightly and moved up to Steve’s right side leaving her legs open for Tony to move between. “Well, I guess I better leave my mark on you too, it’s only fair. Don't you think doll? Would you like me to suck on your beautiful tits while Tony fucks you in those panties?” Steve moaned out and tilted her head back into the pillow. The rhythmic rise and fall of her breasts with every breath caught Bucky’s eye, he zeroed in on the movement and dipped his head to take one of the flushed pink buds in his mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey Steve, it’s me.” He called.
"It means sir, that I cannot allow you access to master Rogers unless he allows me to. Would you like me to ask him you would like to speak with him?"
“What's the plan Cap?”
Once they arrived at the tower the food was already there. They all devoured their food and the team began to trickle into the den, where they would fight over, and then watch a movie. Nat was already in her red bean bag chair, Clint in his nest on one of the ledges Tony had built into the walls, Bruce was tapping away on his tablet in his recliner muttering about something or another, and Tony sat on the couch next to an empty seat where Steve normally sat. The only thing that was missing was the Super Soldier in question, who, after having his fill of food went to his floor looking tired.
“Sorry, I can't understand you. I'll work on something to amplify your voices wavelength and have Jarvis order some doll clothes that are in your sizes.” Tony turned around and handed Steve a little piece of paper towel and then filled a cup with warm water.
When Tony’s ass felt close to normal Rogers had him stand again and he watched a Rogers stood too. He stepped away from the bed a bit and started pulling his pants down and letting his erection hand hot and hard between his legs.
Bucky makes his own breathing more defined and Steve, whether from muscle memory or actual memory, starts to copy him. This is how they would sit when Steve would have an asthma attack, Bucky would coach him to breathe and eventually he would copy Bucky's breath.
“Hell, we didn’t even do anything more than hands and mouths till he saved me from the Hydra base that first time. physical stuff was always hard for him before the serum, he couldn’t always get it up because of his poor circulation and even if he did it wouldn’t last for long. I think he thought that with everything else he could still be himself, be a man. To bottom would have made him a dame, but one who didn’t have curves.”
“Let’s go eat.” He said over his shoulder as he walked out of the gym.
Bucky made a face at Tony and that was the breaking point. Tony jumped over Steve and tackled Bucky to the floor. Normally Tony wouldn’t be able to get the upper hand physically but he had the element of surprise. While Bucky was stunned on the floor, Tony used his genius brain and won the fight before it even started. Tony knew just where Bucky was the most ticklish, soon Bucky was in tears, rolling on the floor and trying halfheartedly to swat Tony’s hands away while he giggled his ass off.
As Clint flew them to their destination Steve contacted SHIELD to see what they were up against.
“No, not really. They tend to just do what they want. That’s why I need the harness I’ve shredded quite a few shirts. Now I’ll need to get another before I can go out again.” Steve trailed off, his features pulled together in thought.
The sound of tearing fabric brought Steve out of his daze and he followed the hallway back into the living room where he found Bucky, perched on the ledge that was installed in the corner for nesting super soldiers and the passing Clint. He had his dark wings pulled around himself and the remnants of his shirt were in a pile on the floor beneath him. Steve slowly walked to him and leaned to pick up the shirt. when he saw Bucky’s wings pull tighter around himself as Steve got closer he decided to let Bucky calm down first, before he tried to figure out what happened.
“Steve,” Tony laid a hand on Steve’s shoulder and pushed so he would face him, Steve could easily overpower Tony and not turn, but he allowed his body to be manipulated.
“You will count, once I deem it enough, I will stop. If you have kept count correctly and do not skip or forget a number, I will allow you to suck me off. If you do loose count, however, we will start again and you will watch as I jerk off and you will leave, not allowed to touch yourself or reach climax in any other way.”
“The little punk was always getting into fights with guys the size of four of 'em, I'd always have to drag his sorry bleeding ass back to his ma so she could stitch him up. He always got sick ‘cause of it. One time I really thought I was gonna lose you Stevie, your fever was so hot and you were spewing nonsense, I'd always have to share the bed with you in the winter because it was too cold but, you had a- creative, solution to that problem as well. The winter of ‘35 you were shivering so bad I pulled ya on top a’ me, Stevie was 17 at the time, and he musta had a-”
"Good work team. Let's take down the rest of the base. Hawkeye and Widow take the upstairs. Iron man, get to the computers and scan them for information. Thor and hulk, there are another group of drones coming from the southwest. I will see to the prisoners in the basement levels." once they got their orders each Avenger split up to take on each of their designated tasks.
“-best if I looked at him now.” Steve looked down at Tony in his arms he was half asleep and was finally calming down.
“But that isn't true-” Tony interrupted.
“Yes! I mean, if you would.” Loki smiled some more and rearranged them on the couch so he was laying on his back and Steve was half on top of him and between the back of the couch.
P.S. for the 30th chapter I am planning to make it a long one so it may take me some time to get it out but, i promise it will be good!
“sorry, I was a little preoccupied.” he said still staring lovingly where his finger was in the now, lukewarm water.
“Are you completely stupid? Did the Hydra agents shrink your brain? That is still Steve, no matter the size and you have probably just earned yourself another 3 months of cleanup and butler's duty.” she looked over to Steve for confirmation he nodded, thought about it, and then held up four tiny fingers. “4 it is.” she said and then forcefully pushed him into the elevator before getting in herself so she can take advantage of his now forced servitude to her, and all the other avengers, but mostly her.
It is like reflex or maybe instinct for Steve to fully expand his semi-open wings, he feels like his brain is not his anymore, like he is just a spectator as his body does what it wants without his say. Steve beats at the air one, two, three times and then settles and watches Bucky’s every move. Bucky waits for some invisible queue and jumps into action, literally, he uses his speed and agility to his advantage over Steve's power and size. He quickly had Steve pinned under him, his wings are up still but he had his joints tilted down pinning Steve’s wings to the floor. Steve uses his wings under him to his advantage and rolls Bucky off of him. Bucky is fast to get up so Steve uses his wings to jab at Bucky and get Bucky under him on the floor like he just was.
Bucky looks directly into Steve’s eyes so he understands every word he is about to say. “You don’t have to tell me anything. Not a single word, and even if you do, I promise you, Stevie. That whatever happens I'll still love you, both of you, you and Tony are stuck with me, Ok?” Steve nods and lets out a small, wet, ‘Okay’
“Now, now, Captain I have come to help you. I can use my magic to stop the effects.”
“I missed you too, Buck”
“We won’t do a bikini wax today or anything like that, you just need to get some clothes that fit you, you don’t expect to walk around with your nipples poking a hole through one of Bucky’s shirts all day, do you?” Steve blushed and shook her head at Natasha’s implication. She began to lift the hem of the shirt when pepper said to wait.
When Steve walked into the room, he was freshly showered but only had pants on and was wringing a piece of leather in his hands while pointedly not looking at Natasha.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sure, let's see what he has to say."
“I know Stevie, I just’ want ya to be able to be known as an artist, and drawing these pin ups for some crook isn’t gonna get you there. Your work is too good for him.” Bucky toed off his boots and set down the gift he got secretly in the bundle of his coat while he sat heavily on the couch and made a move to take up Steve’s paper. It was upside down which, while Steve is usually kinda touchy about Bucky seeing the work he does for Williams, Bucky could tell from the way that Steve was acting and the faint blush on his cheeks this was a really good one,
Harry sighed quietly, and a flicker of naked pain showed for a moment in his eyes.
, Tony.  This isn’t about agency priority in a criminal investigation, this is about Fury being sore that I let the Centralia story break in the first place.  If I start letting SHEILD decide what truths I can tell, what battles are worth fighting… then I have no business leading the Avengers at all.”
Tony decided.
“-Why, you got that kinnda change?”
“I’ve barely started ‘The Two Towers’, I’m afraid,” Steve smiled.  “-Do you give all your friends books to read like this?”
The crowd screamed again.
No.  Peter didn’t need to hear that part.
Steve threw the condom away in the trash by the bed, and was glad to be rid of it.  He was slightly -between- sizes for those things, but Tony insisted they were important even between men, so he dealt with them.
“It ain’t no good around here, Tony.  Yez gotta woman?”
Peter caught his breath, and saluted back.
Steve looked up from pouring a glass of milk, and saw Peter clinging miserably to the nearest window frame.  He was shivering, and his whole costume seemed a shade lighter than it was supposed to be.  There was actually a rime of ice across the lower front of his mask from the condensation of his breathing.
Tony chose a beer and a Coke out of the refrigerator, and handed the Coke to Peter.  He sat back in his desk chair, and crossed his boots on the desk beside the phone book.
?         Ruby Tuesday                The Rolling Stones
Steve rolled his motorcycle into the garage, and Tony pulled the door down after him.  Tony glanced up at a small gray box he’d recently mounted on the garage wall, but the indicator light was still green.
“-I went to art school for a while,” Steve added as a peace offering, “-I dropped out to join the US Army in forty-one.”
“He was my butler, actually,” Tony admitted, smiling wryly.  “-He works for the Carnelian ambassador to Great Britain now.”
Steve said, sounding pleased with himself.

Well, there was no reason the arc reactor would fail within his lifetime, provided he kept the voltage fluctuations down by occasionally connecting it back to an ordinary AC power source, and didn’t draw off enough power at once to drop the reaction within the arc casing below 10,000 volts…
“Hey Tony!  Yer kid’s awake!”
O’Conner climbed up past him onto the truck.
Harry waited uneasily, leaning against the hood of his car.
“Captain Stark?”
“You got them?”  Tony asked, getting up quickly.  He was unshaven, and wearing the same green fatigue pants and oatmeal-colored thermal shirt he’d had on the day before.
“Yes, in just a few hours,” Steve replied, like a man who had just woken up from a dream.
Tony’s fingers followed unhurriedly, skimming lightly across open country, sometimes stroking unapologetically into the warm, fascinating shadows her body presented him with…
Interesting.
felt like a bigger deal than meeting Steve had.
“Never mind.  I’ll be down in the garage.  Just knock.”
Tony got up, forcing himself to walk steadily, and took a half-finished bottle of Jack from the second shelf.  He unscrewed the black cap with his fingers, and took a long swallow.
Peter explained.
“Tony, how many other buildings does Rand-Meachum own?”  Steve asked.
Tony had completed the Mark II Iron Man armor nearly a month and a half earlier, but in the press conference Morgan had held when he revealed War Machine’s existence, he claimed that an early version of the plans for the suit had been stolen from Stark Industries.  This had started an extremely cold-blooded conflict between Morgan and Tony that Tony officially lost in 1968, when Morgan was awarded all patents relevant to the War Machine armor.
Tony said, deadly calm as he tracked the Goblin through a hairpin turn.
“Screw this!”  Tony fired his bootjets and shot straight upwards until the cars in the parking lot below looked like an assortment of small glass beads.
“I need you to get Spider-Man and your mechanic safely to Avengers tower, and then disappear.  Can you do that?”
“-How was Harry?”  Steve asked.
“-Oh, right.  …Wait, wouldn’t I be on the couch without-” Steve began.
Tony remembered the Captain America poster he’d had on his wall as a kid.
, it’s re-synchronizing the electrical-” Tony broke off, and gave Steve a dirty look from beneath his arm, “-oh come
“WHAT?”  Hawkeye demanded.
“No problem.  You were doing a lot better than most people do anyway…”  Tony smirked behind his faceplate.
of all things really stopped Harry from dating her?
“O-kay, that’s… wow,” Peter acknowledged, grimly.
“You’d better not try that elsewhere,” Steve muttered.
“No, but Reed said that all traces of the Venom creature are out of Peter’s system now,” Sue assured him, creating an invisible forcefield-couch across from Tony’s chair and sitting down.  “-You did the right thing by bringing him here, Tony.”
Almost.
Unlike the frost giants however, the Green Goblin had a reputation for taking hostages… temporarily.
“Over here, Cap,” a grizzled fireman signaled him, pointing to a half-buried strip of corrugated steel on the ground.
-!”  Steve beamed, and leaned back against the door with Tony in his arms, shutting it harder than he’d meant to.
He couldn’t put his finger on what -exactly-, but he reached down on instinct, pressed in a hidden catch beneath the breastplate’s left side seam, and pulled it forward.
One of Tony’s hands fell to Steve’s arm, gripping and kneading lightly as he whispered snatches of profane encouragement.
“Oh brother…”  Steve pushed his cowl back, and rubbed his face with one hand.
, and besides… Harry didn’t want to.
the people who lived in the neighborhood, and was even cautiously warming up to the idea of living in a future where it was
“-What?”  Tony blinked.
St. Vincent’s Hospital, 8:02 AM (next day).
-There-.
“Twenty,” Steve whispered into his hair.
Tony dropped into a chair at the foot of the bed and sighed, running a hand back through his hair.  He looked at Harry and Peter for a long moment without speaking.
than you?”  Cap asked.
“-I don’t know,” Tony admitted, drawing his knees up and folding his arms over top of them, “-after what happened during the Tet Offensive, I don’t think there was a way to win it…”
Tony was out cold against Steve’s side, head heavy on his shoulder, dark hair drying flat on one side.  The muffled light of the re-synching arc reactor was nearly steady, but Steve left the plug where it was.
“Yeah…”
Steve had said that one looked ‘snappy’.
Luke caught the oncoming forklift’s rising horizontal tines with the dexterity of a seasoned bull-leaper, and halted its ramming maneuver by bracing his feet and lifting straight upwards.  The forklift’s wheels lost traction and spun, glaring headlights picking out the mahogany sweep of unbroken muscle through a wide tear in Luke’s yellow shirt, and glinting off his steel headband in the darkness.
“Saving the world?”  Steve asked, leaning a hand against the table.
1:46 ½ PM.
“Good, I was hoping to catch you before you went to bed, or- -I didn’t just wake you up, did I?”  Steve asked, as if the possibility had just occurred to him.
“Nothing,” Tony blinked, “-continue.”  -He returned to his wiring.
“-Substandard equipment heat malfunction, huh?”  Tony fumed.
,” Peter yawned, “-I’m just going to crash here tonight.”
“You’re making my head hurt,” Peter accused, “-on purpose.”
in a way Tony seriously doubted the blonde was aware of.
Steve was rocking up into him now, eyes unfocused,
There.
As catalyzed as they were by the transistors that boosted them, Tony’s jets -were- still basically just air compressors, and point-blank they cooled instead of heated, plunging the temperature of the other suit’s unibeam’s focusing lens down fast.  It exploded in a hail of high-tempered glass and a small fountain of electrical sparks.
An explosion rocked the mall from where Easton had been standing a moment earlier, and threw him and his rescuer skidding across the smooth-polished floor.
“Yeah?”  Steve asked, glancing up at him.
One picture on that wall wouldn’t be coming back though.
“We have more of what you’d call an open relationship,” Tony smirked.  “And… thanks for getting me off that missile, lady.  When I couldn’t break out of the magnetic field from Warmonger’s suit, I… that was a bad moment.”
War Machine crouched unmoving at the edge of the roof, scanning.  His silhouette was slight and boxy against the starry night sky, obviously just another piece of the monolithic new skyscraper’s high-tech security equipment.
He turned around, hands on his helmet.
“What?” He asked.
He got in, put on sunglasses, and drove down the tunnel that opened into a parking garage that SI workers use. The tunnel comes out of the ground and only he, Aunt Pepper, and the Avengers have access to it.
“Peter, you and I both know that that’s a stupid idea,” Wade said.
“What are you doing?!” Peter yelled at the bystanders. “Run away!” He tried to persuade them.
His teacher just sighed. Mr. Harrington knew that Peter was smart and could probably balance chemical equations in his sleep, so he let it go.
“Where are you, you little bug?!?” The voice was getting closer and his class started whimpering.
“PETER PARKER I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THESE GAMES!!” The voice yelled before Peter heard lockers smashing into the ground.
Peter turned into Wade’s chest and buried his head there.
Peter rubbed his neck sheepishly, “remember my closet renovations?”
the AI responded.
“If not now then when Pops?” Peter demanded.
Peter took his time with conversation until he realized he had to leave if he wanted to make it to school on time. He quickly said his goodbyes and ran to his room to grab his backpack, green jacket, and Spider-Man suit (for patrol after school).  He quickly shoved his suit in his backpack and ran to the elevator. He was on the 97th floor of Stark Tower, and he needed to get to the garage, 99 floors below him.
Here Peter was lying on the ground bleeding, in Times Square with his identity revealed.
Peter tried to hide his face in his locker but that didn’t stop Ned.
“NED NO!” He basically pleaded.
And he was pissed.
“You could never disappoint us, you are a nice, cute, and genius kid, and we both love you, but that’s not to say we aren’t mad, because we are.” Tony said while breathing in Peter’s shampoo.
Osborn just rolled his eyes, hopped back on his hoverboard and threw more lockers at Peter. Peter quickly jumped out of the way and cringed at the resonating noise. He really didn’t need an overload right now.
“THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?!” Tony yelled.
“Don’t tell anyone!” Peter yelled as he ran out.
“But you’re making me a new one,” Peter taunted.
Peter pulled up to school and people turned and pointed at him as he drove by. He parked in his parking spot, converted the roof back on, and started walking into school.
