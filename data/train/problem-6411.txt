It makes absolutely no sense at all and Tony loves it.
And honestly, for the most part, Tony is thrilled that his two favorite people are starting to become each other’s favorite people as well. It’s just that this is really new, and it’s taking Tony a while to adjust to them being such good buddies. He’s not bitter or jealous at all, nor is he worried about either of them falling head over heels in love with each other and leaving him in the dust. Really, he isn’t. But…
They’re just about to leave the stage after their keynote presentation when Tony spots Steve at the back of the audience, smiling from ear to ear and applauding with the rest of the crowd. Rhodey’s standing next to him with a proud glimmer in his eyes, giving them two thumbs up—his signature seal of approval.
and you’re gonna kill it with dinner but lmk if you want me to help with prep ok?
It looks like Steve’s grin can’t get any wider, but somehow he manages. “Okay, here goes.” He pauses for dramatic effect, and Tony leans forward in anticipation. “Jim likes Bucky.”
He must have rambled on out loud instead of just keeping his thoughts to himself because next thing he knows, Steve has laid a placating hand on his shoulder, trying to calm him down while simultaneously stifling his own laughter.
By the time Tony has caught up to Steve, he’s already mostly done changing into his outfit. He turns around to Tony as he’s buttoning up his vest and says, “See? It suits me! Now we can be a true power couple!”
thinking.”
Well in that case please tell them I’m sorry.
“On DUM-E’s code? That’s serious.” Steve finishes washing his face and takes Tony’s hand, leading them back into the bedroom.
“Oh! That was my idea. Honestly, I was just telling Jim that I wanted to surprise you and he decided to tag along to show Bucky some support.”
“Here, these should last you a whole week.”
“Well you didn’t
“Before you say anything else, I just want you to know, I’m so sorry.” Steve looks pleadingly at Tony, then at Rhodey. “I lost a bet. When you were away in Aspen for that tech conference a couple months ago, Bruce and I got into a drinking contest. I don’t even remember how it happened, but it did, and he bet me that I wouldn’t be able to outdrink him. And of course I agreed to the bet. I thought I’d win! But I didn’t, and his term was that I needed to wear Harvard gear for every outfit, for a whole week, if I lost. So here we are.”
“Morning, traitor,” Rhodey says as he sets the cutlery down. “Nice flannel pants.”
Tony rummages through a drawer, finds what he needs, and hands Rhodey a mini ice cream scoop.
“Portion out the dough and drop it on the sheet,” Steve instructs. “Leave a few inches between each scoop so the cookies have space to expand as they bake.”
Clearly taken aback, Steve asks, slightly offended, “What? Why’s he a little shit for wanting to date Bucky?”
Steve laughs. “Later. Lunch first.”
“Are you sure?”
“So remember last week when you were getting super jealous of all the time Jim was spending with me and worrying about me stealing your best friend from you?”
Okay, so that sounded a little more passive aggressive than Tony meant it to be. But in his defense, the scene in front of him is the last thing he expected to see when he arrived home from his investors meeting. Who can blame him for being caught off guard at seeing Rhodey in his kitchen with oven mitts on, sliding a fully loaded casserole dish into what he’d always called the devil’s contraption (
Tony stays silent for a while, trying his best to process everything he’s just heard. His instinct tells him to crack a snarky joke, but the words won’t come out. Instead, he says, “You really mean that, Captain?” His voice cracks on the last syllable. He knows he sounds weak, and needy, but Tony can’t bring himself to care.
It’s not what Tony wants Steve to do; he genuinely thinks Steve looks hot as fuck with the beard, and he enjoys tugging on the longer hair. But he accepts this. He loves Steve’s clean-shaven look as well. It’s
“A drinking song.”
Before Steve can think of a retort, Rhodey takes the dishes from him. “I can grab these. Why don’t you call it a night, yeah?”
“Careful, Cap. Wouldn’t want to accidentally stab yourself with this.” Rhodey pauses, then smirks. “Though the blood would blend beautifully into that crimson shirt you have on.”
“Yes! Come on!”
“What,” Rhodey starts. “The fuck. Are you wearing?”
With that, Tony and Rhodey launch into a tune together, holding their coffee up high and practically shouting the words out:
“Great! Night, Steve! Enjoy the couch!”
As soon as they’re close enough, Steve pulls Tony into a warm embrace, placing gentle kisses in his hair and whispering to Tony how proud he is of him, how much he loves him. Out of the corner of his eye, Tony sees Rhodey clapping Bucky on the shoulder and giving his own congratulations.
"Hey, bud," said Tony, his expression revealing absolutely no hint of the fact that he was trailing his fingertips along Steve's inner thigh under the table. "What's up?"
"Stephen and I would not allow that to happen, Captain," said Wong.
And Dad did call Papa out sometimes on what he coined, "his 1940's mentality" and how ridiculous he could be about certain things because of it, but for some reason Papa was absolutely refusing to see that he really needed help, and Peter knew it was causing Dad a whole lot of stress, which Dad really didn't need on top of everything else that he was already stressed about. Papa wasn't the only one who worried about Dad's heart, slightly enhanced genes or not.
Tony thought for a moment. "No, only enough for the east side of the Tower since those would be the ones that would fire towards the school anyway."
Peter thought with a shudder.
"No, no, it's okay," Natasha said quickly. She pushed herself up from her chair, forcing a smile. "I'm gonna go see what Clint and Pietro are up to now, okay? I'll… come by and check on you later."
"Uh huh," said Peter. "Me too."
"Pete? Buddy, tell me what's wrong," Tony said as shot to his feet, with Peter practically collapsing into his arms. He tucked his boy's head under his chin, his entire skinny body shaking so badly that he couldn't even seem to form words.
“One that I have taught him, yes,” answers Natasha as she starts the engine.  “Your kid’s a pretty fast learner.”
"She's gonna wonder what happened, you know she is!" warned Uncle Bucky. "And your dads—"
"All right. That Mr Jarvis was a pretty smart guy, hmm?"
With a shaky nod, Peter pursed his lips as he peeked over the edge of the platform, the cloak imitating his every movement. Tony could hear him muttering to himself as he took in the scene, thinking almost against his will of how proud Steve would be if he could see him.
"It would end the war," Steve finished. "I mean, a source of unlimited clean energy would be a pretty impressive peace offering, so I can't imagine why it wouldn't end the war."
Steve’s quiet for a moment, grimacing as the pins-and-needles sensation ramps up its repair of his leg, his mind searching for where he’s heard something like that mentioned before.
—but they still happened far too often, and nothing they tried seemed to completely help him. Whether it was therapeutic massage, white noise, a new sleeping medication concocted by Bruce, or one of Thor's ancient Asgardian slumbering chants, nothing was able to keep the demons at bay for longer than a few nights, leaving them right back where they started and completely frying Tony and Steve's nerves in the process.
Tony thought proudly.
"So Thanos is for sure coming here?" Dr Strange asked.
And just as quickly, "No, no, no! On second thought, I don't think I wanna know!"
"Pete?" Dad asked in alarm, turning to face him. "Buddy, what is it? What're you sensing?"
And then Tony's back arched up off the bed, his entire body shuddering and his blunt fingernails digging into Steve's skin as he came all over Steve's hand, pulling Steve over the edge with him only a few seconds later as their combined cries of pleasure echoed off the walls of their bedroom. Steve collapsed down onto Tony, taking care not to crush him as he pressed gentle kisses into the damp skin of his cheek and neck.
"Tomorrow we're gonna bring our boy back, yeah?" Tony softly asked a few moments later.
Since when had O'Brien ever referred to his inner governmental circle as his ‘parliament’? In all of his years with the Air Corps and before that as a civilian, Steve had never before heard him use that term.
"No, it's not a bad idea," answered Steve. "But I don't think we need to wait for her. I didn't see anything that indicated she was there in the parallel universe, so I don't believe she'll be a factor in the battle."
"Not too much, babe, yeah?" he said as he worked himself open. "You've already got me so damn close from that naughty mouth of yours."
Tony's eyes narrowed in surprise. "You're joking, right? You actually think I'm gonna leave the two of you alone after what happened?"
"So you're thinking the kid saw something that we can't?" asked Clint.
Quill was silent for a moment, his expression implying he was thinking, although there was no way Tony could be sure. While he waited for a response, he looked around. He had been keeping Peter right by his elbow ever since Quill released him, not wanting him out of his sight, and Strange had wandered off on his own as soon as the group got outside, and was now sitting in the
Peter breathed in, pondering. He'd never quite thought about it like that.
"Um, I will in a moment!" Mantis replied in her high-pitched, squeaky voice. She raised her hand, pointing to where Strange was still floating over the rocks, his neck and wrists encircled by tendrils of green light emanating from the stone around his neck.
Even if it couldn't even come close to repairing the gaping hole in his chest, where his heart had been carved out by a golden glove embossed with six colourful stones, and then smashed until it was nothing but ashes.
"Yeah, Tony, as far as I know he's fine," replied Sam. "He and Clint went down to Bucky's apartment for the game. Why?"
"Papa's got you, little guy, I've got you," Image Steve said. He cradled his boy in his arms as Tony skidded to a halt behind them, his helmet retracting as his armoured arms pulled them both against his chest.
"Yeah, well, instead of arguing about it, why don't we just work on getting you back here, yeah?" said Tony. "'Cause that'll just be the easiest way to solve all these problems."
"No," said Tony, fighting the urge to look away. Since the room was almost completely dark the fact that Steve could even see the scar at all was surprising, but Tony wasn't going to ruin the mood by trying to figure out why.
"Y-yes," he stammered, gasping as a fresh wave of pain hit him like a tsunami. "Yes, he—he—"
The sun was just beginning to climb over the horizon when there was a knock on the door.
"Yeah! And I'm so happy for you!" Peter said. "But please tell me you're not still wearing that ugly cadets' uniform, 'cause I'm pretty sure there's—"
"Try and sleep now, little guy, okay?" said Papa as he tucked Peter's blankets over his shoulder and kissed his head. "We can talk more about what you'll need for the dance tomorrow."
"Um, right, Mr Wilson," Gwen said. She gave Peter's hand a reassuring squeeze, making him flush even pinker. "My mom and dad talk about when I was little all the time too. I think it must just be a parent thing."
—it wouldn't sound quite as daunting.
"Peter! No!" Gamora cried as she stumbled backwards, barely able to keep herself from falling. She turned to look at Strange, her arms crossed over her abdomen. "What is happening?"
“Ah huh…”  Tony trailed off as tapped commands into his keyboard, accessing the program controlling the security cameras.  Not even three minutes later he had altered the code to hold onto the footage for an entire week.  “Okay, that should help a bit,” he said.  “And I also want you to send me a text every single time this warehouse is accessed, you got that?  Include the security code used and a screenshot if you can grab one.”
"No, they left there the day before yesterday. They're in Mongolia now, I just talked to them last night."
"Wait!" Mantis said, her already freakishly-large eyes widening as she looked down at her arm. "Something—something's happening!"
"Uh huh," Tony heard Peter say. "Talk to you soon."
"Do you believe him?" Tony asked after a couple of blocks. "Stacy?"
He felt Steve smile against his scalp. "Whatever it takes, sweetheart."
Drawing in a deep, shuddering breath, Steve glanced back at the door he'd just slammed, and the shield he had just happened to knock loose from a nearby shelf. Natasha had put it there shortly after they got back from Wakanda, after Steve had launched it from his and Tony's bedroom one night in a raging fit of anguish. Even now, his stomach roiled at the sight of it, at the shield he had wielded as Captain America since 1942.
"I think the correct term for Cole would be psychopath, honey. No conscience means that you can do whatever the hell you want and not worry about the consequences."
And the only way Steve could see to dig himself out of the hole he had dug was to defend his Olympic titles.  Without the anticipation of those medals, Steve was in danger of losing his endorsements, the only way he could cover his pool rental and the treatments for his bum shoulder.
"I agree, sir," said JARVIS. "There are some similarities to the encryption keys used for the Project Insight algorithm, but if I do say so, this is even more advanced. As such, I am unable to transfer any of it to the Tower's servers without a significant risk to the security systems."
he asked. "'Cause—'cause—"
"Yeah, he's told me that a few times." Steve bit down on his bottom lip, still fiddling with Tony's fingers. "Tony, Phillips told me not too long ago that he thinks there's still some serum left. He didn't say any more than that, and he also doesn't know where it is or how much, but… I was thinking…"
Steve thought.
"Nope," said Uncle Bucky. "Now, since we've used up all of our chess time yapping, I think you should take another nap, yeah? Before Ms Sarah comes in here and yells at me?" He leaned forward, lowering his voice. "When Stevie and I were kids she used to yell at me when she thought I was keeping him awake too much, and I don't need to go through that again."
"No, honey, it's okay," Tony interrupted. "Just… I mean, you get it, right?"
It was an angel. A literal angel, glowing like a human-shaped sun as she hovered in space.
"Because it wasn't yet time," Dr Strange said, a bit gentler. "But I promise you, it is now. We must get to Wakanda."
"Yeah," Peter answered, his eyes just as wide, which he quickly realised wasn't such a good idea given how scratchy they were. He squeezed them closed, rubbing them with one hand as he fumbled in his backpack for his glasses.
"Ah, I see. You seem to have that in common with your father."
"Oh, sure," Sharon said, winking. "Guess that means they're not keeping you flyboys busy enough though, hmm?"
Because even if HYDRA was gone, Tony was not taking any chances, and especially not with his husband and son. He was going to make sure that whenever—not
"Yeah, she did," agreed Steve, nodding as Cam Mitchell took his seat next to Major Lorne, who had arrived with Sharon Carter on his arm. All of Steve's teammates were now there, just like they had been for Peter's serum procedure.
of code scrolling across his monitor woke Tony from his fitful doze, his head snapping up so fast from its lolled position that he wrenched his neck.
"If I have to," Steve murmured, moaning when Tony dug the pads of his fingers into his scalp. His eyes fluttered closed as he relaxed against Tony, trying to focus only on the feel of his husband's fingertips instead of the pulsating pain in his foot and side.
"You guys just can't keep your hands off each other, can you," he said, that evil/ mischievous gleam in his eyes that Steve knew drove Tony bonkers. "It's like watching one of those stupid-ass rom-coms on a continuous loop. I mean, aren't you getting tired of each other yet?"
Something had to give, and soon. Otherwise… well… Peter didn't really enjoy thinking about the otherwise.
"Okay. Goodnight."
Tony scoffed, rolling his eyes. "Howard never spoke to me about much of anything, much less some super-secret project that he worked on before his fall from grace."
Because he did. Steve knew exactly what Tony needed in that moment, because he needed the exact same thing.
"Okay, sweetheart, okay," he whispered. "But in the meantime, I'm going to try as hard as I possibly can to make sure none of this happens."
"Papa, what—what is it?" he asked. "What did Dad find in the SHIELD data?"
"Well… a shower sounds pretty nice, for starters."
he thought, a sharp stab of guilt piercing his heart, guilt that he tried to stamp back down.
"It's like they've been erased!" said Drax. "Erased from existence!"
Steve huffed, his shoulders sagging as he burrowed even further into Tony's pillow, holding his breath until his lungs started to burn and he couldn't hold it any longer.
Ned had just correctly answered the year that the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb when Papa appeared, taking up his usual spot in the gym's doorway. But he had barely gotten his arms settled into their crossed position when Mr Harrington suddenly gasped so loudly that he cut Gwen off in mid-sentence, gulping as he pushed his wire-rimmed glasses up the bridge of his nose.
Lang scowled, glancing over at Steve as if he was looking for help. "Okay, first of all, Mr Stark, I didn't know it was Hank's house that I was breaking into until a lot later."
"Aww, thanks, Gwen!" Ned said with a wide smile. "I'm so glad you guys are looking as forward to this as I am."
"No, we will not," said Nebula. "And that is something I am willing to die for."
“No!” Steve cried as he bolted upright, panting and shivering and covered in sweat.  He glanced frantically around the area, confused as hell as to where he was, when he felt a pair of calloused hands gently take hold of his shoulders.
Emoji Key for those who don't know what to say in the comments!
First it had been Riley's death, which happened so quickly that it was as though Steve had blinked and suddenly Riley was nothing more than an airborne fireball, and one so close that Steve had actually
With a heavy sigh, Tony loosened the tie from around his neck and unbuttoned the top button of his shirt, lolling his head in the direction of the decanter of whisky tucked over in the corner, the amber liquid a dark shadow against the lower third of the fancy container. It was on nights like these when his cravings were the worst, when his fingers practically itched to hold the glass and he could almost taste the whisky on his tongue, burning its way down his throat and sending warmth blooming across his chest. But Tony hadn't had a single hard drink since Peter's emergency trip to the hospital back when he was three years old, and he wasn't about to now, no matter how badly he wanted it. If this cockamamie plan of his was going to have any possible chance of success then he couldn't afford to slip up.
"Oh, I've thought a lot about it," he said, almost shyly. "Let's just say that I have some definite plans."
“Steve taught me how to use the cash register this afternoon!” Peter exclaimed.  “He even let me calculate the sales tax by hand!”
"Very good, sir. Firing in three… two… one… mark!"
"Are ya done?" he asked.
"Yeah, well, that's different," Ned insisted as he ate another chip. "You and I don't usually hang out once practise is done, so—"
“You were too afraid, yeah?” Tony murmured as he slid a pillow underneath Steve’s hips and settled in next to him, trailing his fingertips up and down Steve’s spine.  “Before?”
The only person who ever would see Steve that way.
"Well, if you're sure," Gwen said, her tone suggesting that she thought otherwise. "But don't forget that I'm here if you want to talk about anything. And I'm not trying to be pushy, I just—"
Tony thought bitterly.
"Hey, you don't need to yell at me, you know," Ned said with wide eyes. "I already know all this."
As it is, Steve ended up low-balling himself anyway.  He knows his time is worth more than the ten dollars an hour he’ll be making to coach Peter, but he figures he can always renegotiate once Peter starts going to meets and racks up some decent times.  Empire State allows its professors and sports coaches to earn up to an additional twelve percent of their university salary on outside projects, which means Steve still has some wiggle room to work with.
And right there, worn proudly on his left arm, was the gauntlet. Golden in colour, it was embossed with four coloured stones set in a line across Thanos' knuckles. Purple for the Power Stone, blue for the Space Stone, red for the Reality Stone, yellow for the Mind Stone.
Unfortunately, it was Steve's similar healing factor that was now working against him, causing many of the broken bones that he'd suffered during his torture to heal out of whack.
"This is so fascinating," Gwen said as she added some finishing touches on her drawing of Leo. "It's so much better than just looking at pictures in a book, isn't it?"
Steve thought as he started his bike.
"Come in?" Tony said, pursing his lips when Clint poked his head around the door.
"What—?" Tony started.
Steve’s about halfway through writing his third workout when it suddenly hits him.  While Peter may already know the fundamentals of the four strokes, he would probably still benefit from having Steve in the water with him to demonstrate certain things, such as how best to push off from the wall and how to time his strokes to ensure that he touches the wall with outstretched arms.  Most of the coaches Steve had when he was a beginner taught like that, and Peter deserves nothing less than the best.
Especially since he’d likely have to repurpose one of the rifle assembly lines.
And no one could ever take care of him better than Tony.
"Very well, if you are absolutely sure," JARVIS said. The UI still sounded unconvinced, but thankfully didn't bug him about it. "Would you like me to turn on the rain sounds?"
"Yes," answered Dr Strange. "Wong and I are the guardians of this Sanctum."
only barely drowned out by a booming explosion.
"Damn," murmured John. "That's… gonna take some getting used to."
"And then you'll launch it into space, right?" Peter asked.
“No, not exactly.  I’m just…”  Steve huffs out a sharp breath, tossing a puzzled look at his computer.  “I don’t usually meet with random parents unless their kid’s a student here, so… where’d this guy get my name?”
"Well, nothin' wrong with that." He made a move towards the kitchen exit, but Peter grabbed onto his hand, halting him.
"Now why doesn't that surprise me, hmm?"
Steve laughed, his gorgeous blue eyes twinkling in the dim light of the moon.
"Dad, you don't have to pretend with me anymore," Peter said, so matter-of-factly that it sent Tony's heart plummeting to his knees. "I know what's going on, I'm not a little kid anymore."
—to take.
Steve dug the pads of his fingers into Tony's scalp, smiling when Tony let out a soft moan. "Howard knew how smart you are, sweetheart, I'm sure of it."
Begrudgingly, of course. Shoving him into an office the size of a broom closet and forcing him to work such long hours that he'd barely been able to see his son while he'd been home, much less now that Peter was stuck in the hospital, waiting on a surgery that might never happen and costing so many credits per day that Tony would already have to work until he was about a hundred and ten to pay it all off.
Steve’s entire body felt like it was as pink as a lobster as he finally whispered, “I—I’d like for you to have me tonight.  If—if that’s okay.”
"Actually, I thought you were beautiful, " Steve said as an adorable pink blush crept up his neck to his cheeks. "And as soon as I thought it, I felt ashamed." He shrugged, shaking his head. "I didn't know at the time that it was okay for me to think that about another man. It'd been taboo my entire life, and—"
And Tony soaked up every single second of it, like an overly thirsty sponge.
Oh, he could train with them, in their massive training arena up at the Compound where his family usually spent the weekends. He could practise all the manoeuvres that he'd been perfecting ever since his genetic mutations began expressing themselves, including using his homemade webbing and web shooters that had so impressed Dad that he'd started using a few of Peter's design techniques in some of the new tech he was building for the team, but he still couldn't call himself an Avenger.
"Somehow JARVIS came back to life," Tony said. "And he's already calculated Steve's reentry angle, and—"
“Yeah, I’m okay,” Papa said as he patted Dad’s shoulder.  “More than okay, even.”
"Uh—uh huh."
"Oohh, honey, that's good," Tony said once he'd swallowed, clearing his throat. "What magic did you use to conjure up this concoction?"
Tony blinked, giving Obie one of Peter’s
replied Alt-Steve, pressing his palm to his chest, a move that Steve unconsciously imitated.
"Mr Beck's transfer date is exactly six months after I came online in this facility."
“So, I don't mind walking you to the door, if that’s okay with you?” Tony softly asked.  “You know, make sure you don't get mugged or something?”
“Thanks,” Tony murmured.  He downed the last of his now-lukewarm coffee, grimacing at the bitterness as he pressed the button for Pepper’s office.
"Oh, that's awesome!" she exclaimed as she hugged him again. "I think it'll be fun!"
Gwen blinked, smiling politely. "Well, I guess we'll find out, won't we?"
Throwing the sheets back, Tony's eyes widened as he noticed that they were torn in a couple of spots. He'd heard what he'd thought was a ripping sound while he was giving Steve his initial blowjob the night before, but since his brain had turned to mush pretty much right afterwards he hadn't given it too much thought since then.
"All right, all right, there's no need for us to keep snarking at each other," said Bruce. He turned to Steve, pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose. "You did ask me to find out who was on the other end of the pager, so… there ya go. Looks like we got a response."
He’s just a kid!” Tony whispers, his jaw dropping open at the thumbnail of an obviously younger Steve Rogers wearing one of those full-body tank swimsuits that used to be so popular.  In the picture, his arms are raised in victory, the smile on his clean-shaven face so bright it could give the sun a run for its money.
"That's okay, we don't have to," Steve said quickly. He jerked his head towards the notebook in Peter's lap. "So, what do you like to draw?"
"O-kay," she said slowly. "Pretty sure the games are set up in the dining room so…"
He just had to be very, very careful. Hope that they could actually accomplish what Natasha had been wishing for all this time, that they could actually somehow reverse the snap, was probably the most fragile of hopes that Steve had ever thought to conjure.
"No, I—" Steve started, hissing as the pain ramped up to an unbearable level as soon as he moved his arm again, finally giving up when Natasha planted her palm on his shoulder, halting his movements.
Peter wanted to shout.
"Pardon me, Master Peter?" JARVIS said. "I didn't quite catch that?"
That was Bucky!" cried Captain Wilson as he bolted for the door.
"Yeah," he whispered as he pushed himself up to his feet. "Okay."
the point here,
"Oh, it's not?" Tony snapped, his hands clenching into fists at his sides. "It's
"I'll go and grab 'em!" Peter exclaimed before Tony could even look in his direction, and then was racing out of the lab a second later. Tony stood back, still holding the air canister as Bucky looked up at him again, a tentative curiosity in his eyes.
"Okay," Steve said as he finished his first sandwich. "That all seems reasonable."
If they hadn't been in Wakanda, and had access to the best medical technology in the entire world, then—
"It's a wonder that he's lived this long given the heart defects that he has," the doctor continued. "He's a pretty remarkable young man."
“Aahh!” Steve yelps as nausea slams into him like a runaway freight train, the intense pain consuming almost his entire being.  He tries to gulp in air as he reaches his shaking hands towards his leg, his stomach twisting again as his palms come back wet with blood.
"Papa—!"
"Yes," Steve stated. "That's exactly what we're saying."
Peter blinked, feeling like he'd just been punched in the gut. "Um… you mean the Oxford that—that's in—?"
"Your son can heal on his own?" Shuri asked as she dunked a large white cloth into a basin of bluish, sweet-smelling liquid, soaking it through.
He was cut off as a shiny grey rope suddenly appeared through the portal, one so familiar and beautiful that both Alt-Steve and Tony jumped back, their hands automatically clasping together as the entire battle seemed to pause, as if it was drawing in a deep breath.
Whatever it took.
been on his list.
Steve blushed so hard that the tips of his ears turned pink.  “Ah, yes sir,” he said.  “Reading is one of the best ways to keep up with things.”
"Hon? You okay?"
"No, not likely, but it's always good to make sure," agreed Tony. "But what we really need to discuss is if we're gonna let Pete watch the experiment. I mean, obviously we'd have to make sure he couldn't hear the trigger words, but you know he's gonna want to watch it."
"Peggy? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be getting ready for the party?" I asked.
“Sure.”  As he pulls on his clothes, Peter tries to listen to what Dad and Mr Rogers are talking about, but their conversation is quickly drowned out by the arrival of a group of six little kids and their parents, probably there for a swimming lesson.
How long had it been since he’d felt the soothing touch of a hug?
"Thanks," said James as he got to his feet, hauling Steve up with him. Steve was so dizzy that he nearly swooned once he was upright, his eyes unable to focus on anything besides James's shiny armoured arms holding him up.
"Mr Stark!" Rogers exclaimed, his pale cheeks flushing pink. "Uh… are you all right?"
"Nah, it's okay bud," Tony said as he undid the crooked knot and retied it. He had been taught how to tie a tie by none other than Edwin Jarvis himself, a master of proper formal British dress, and while it might've been silly to pride himself on such an accomplishment, Tony still enjoyed it whenever Peter had to ask for his help.
"Well, wow!" Pepper said with a surprised smile. "You guys are actually going on vacation? Not that I don't think it's a fantastic idea, I'm just really kind of surprised."
, don't tell me—!"
"I'll follow on your six, Cap," she said. "Just like we practised."
Nine days of going round and round with more lawyers, government officials, military officials, and reporters than Tony ever cared to know existed, all while trying to subsist on less than a handful of hours of sleep and trying to keep a semi-brave face for Peter, his brave boy who was so worried sick for his papa that he could barely function, but could still deliver a three-minute off-the-cuff competition speech that knocked the socks off of every single judge
"So, Helen thinks we should hopefully be able to get the paper published in the journal
"Huh?" Tony said, snapping his mouth closed. He had been dangerously close to drooling, not exactly something he needed Colonel Phillips to see.
"Yes," Steve murmured into Tony's chest. "It would help."
"Happy New Year, buddy," Tony murmured as he kissed Peter's cheek. "It's gonna be a great one."
Quill and Gamora exchanged glances, with Gamora finally shaking her head.
He trails off, his mind working almost too fast for him to even speak coherently.
"They were captured along with the guy who had the Time Stone," said Bruce. "I don't know if that helps you or not, but—"
“So,” he says, pushing himself up to a sitting position.  “You got any idea where we are?”
What he wouldn't give to have Tony even speak to him at all. Acknowledge that he still existed, even if he wished that Peter had made it instead of Steve.
"And you didn't see the need to tell me that some stranger was visiting you?" Tony demanded.
🐰 = it’s so fluffy!
"Pardon me, sir, but Agent Romanoff is on the line," JARVIS said, startling Tony so badly that he knocked over his coffee cup, splashing the burning hot liquid all over his hand and several of Bruce's handwritten notebooks.
Tony sighed heavily as he leaned back in his chair, waiting for his computer to finish compiling the last of the code he'd just entered. He had asked Phillips if he could continue working in his office during the X-302 patrols instead of just sitting around in the hangar, to which Phillips had agreed as long as Tony agreed to follow the comm chatter over a speaker and report any potential issues to him right away.
"Which is what Fury helped me figure out," added Carol. "I was… out of commission for a bit after the crash."
"And he's one of the Avengers? The guys Thor told us about?"
“What?  I can’t tell my husband that I find him sexy as hell before lunch?” protested Dad.  He held up his left hand, displaying the titanium ring on his finger that Peter had helped Papa pick out.  “Pretty sure this says that I can tell him anytime I so choose, so I would suggest, buddy, that you just get used to it.”
But, as Steve was discovering, things apparently weren't as black and white as he had always thought.
"Banner's lab was covered in scorch marks," said Tony. "And from what Phillips told me no one's dared to go down there since he went kaboom, so—"
it about Ireland and flat tires, anyway? With no spare tire available and the auto club saying it would be a three-hour wait, Steve had suggested that they hike a bit along the country road they'd been driving on, which ended up leading them to an absolutely beautiful waterfall that Steve identified as the famous Maghera Falls, a place his ma had told him about as a child. Peter of course had been completely fascinated by it, and insisted on not only exploring the falls and the surrounding beach area but also the nearby caves. Steve and Peter ended up taking so many pictures that they both maxed out the memory on their phones, something Tony hadn't thought was possible.
“Please!” he pleaded.  “Everyone’s gone already, and I’ve got nothing to do!”
Papa let out a short chuckle. "Something like that. Try and sleep now, okay? It'll help with the jet lag once we get back."
"Because they have protocols that they need to follow, Tony, you know that," Rhodey said, with the air of barely-tempered impatience that Tony had long become accustomed to. Tony knew Rhodey was in a very difficult position, his own standing in the Langaran Air Corps precarious ever since the accident that had left him unable to continue flying.
"No, no, it's okay," Tony whispered. "Unlike you I can't get it up again more than every couple hours, so I'm just gonna let you have some fun for awhile first. Sound good?"
"And that right there is the main reason why we're all here," Sam said. "Because we are a team, and we don't leave our teammates behind, no matter what. Whatever it takes, right?"
"Well, the weather forecast says it's s'posed to rain that day but who knows, they're only right half the time anyway," said Sam. He leaned forward, narrowing his eyes. "You okay there, Cap?"
"Eh, don't congratulate me yet," Bucky said. "Ring shopping is one thing, but actually popping the question, that's just kinda yikes. I still haven't quite worked that part out yet."
A massive thank-you to my wonderful betas, allthesinnersandallthesaints, JeBeeEh, and She’sLikeTexas ♥️
T'Challa smiled, in the way a parent would smile at a child who didn't quite understand something. "Not exactly, Ms Romanoff," he said. "You see, in my culture, death is not the end. It's more of a stepping off point. You reach out with both hands to Bast and Sekhmet, and they lead you to the green veld where you can run forever."
“Um… Pete?” Dad said, nearly sending Peter straight to the ceiling.  “What the hell are you doing in here?”
—from Peter's perspective, possessing such futuristic thinking skills often led to approximately ten to fifteen percent of actual progress and eighty-five to ninety percent of pure frustration. And apparently the Stark family—or at least the Stark men, since Peter never got the chance to meet his grandmother—didn't really know how to handle such immense frustration in ways that weren't unhealthy. Even before Grandpa's arrest and subsequent trial, Dad had always described him as being cold and distant, which only grew worse once his trial was over.
Ned let out a chuckle. "Yeah, I guess that's one way to look at it. Even though the Soviet Union was made up of a bunch of different countries, and we were just one."
"Okay, so… open the door then."
After arriving at one of the big, fancy piers, Peter broke the lock on a public restroom door and slipped inside, sinking down into the corner by the empty trash bin. He grimaced as he tipped his head back against the tiled wall; the room smelled like a bad combination of boys' locker room and strong disinfectant, but at least he was out of the damp, muggy air and could rest for a bit. He had been going almost nonstop for over two days already, and was pretty much fried.
“And why do you think this guy…?” Tony broke off, cursing internally for already forgetting the guy’s name.  “Um…”
The worry wrinkle appeared between Steve's eyebrows. "All right, sweetheart. Go ahead."
"Yeah, but, even if we assume Pym was right and the particles don't follow the rules as stated by the Planck Scale, then that means there's no good way to predict what might happen once we start messing with this thing again," Tony said. He huffed out a sharp breath, tilting his head at Scott. "It might mean that you just happened to accidentally survive thanks to some billion-to-one cosmic fluke. Not exactly what I would call great odds."
And with that, Steve felt his entire body relax, because of course Tony knew he preferred to make love face-to-face.  That’s how they’d always done it.
"Oh." Grandpa immediately shrank back on the hard chair as though he was trying to disappear into it. "Yeah, that's right. So they're all set then, yeah?"
Steve gave a jerky nod.  “Okay.”
"Captain Rogers is ready for takeoff in Phoenix One," he said into the comm as he fired up his engines. "Call it out, A-shift."
"No, he's sure as hell not," said Bucky. "But maybe this'll finally force him to tell us what the hell the space missions are for."
"Pete! Hang on buddy!" Dad yelled as more missiles launched from his suit, assuming the Jericho formation that he'd once been so proud of. "I'm coming!"
he thought as he rinsed the soap bubbles from his hands.  While he certainly wasn't an expert, to him it had seemed as though Steve suffered from some sort of neurological disorder, and Stark Industries had helped to develop several protein-based drugs that were being studied for various things.  Maybe there was a way Peter could get Steve involved in one of their clinical trials.
He stopped short when Uncle Bucky's face drained of colour. "Holy shit, kiddo," he whispered. "So you're saying that Meridia, or whoever the hell is in charge of Meridia, now has access to all of the Phoenix satellites?"
"Hmph," grumbled Tony as Steve headed for the bathroom. "Why does the high school have to start so damn early anyway?"
"They won't kill him, Dad," Peter said, trying to offer them both at least a tiny bit of reassurance. "Papa's too well-loved by too many people for them to just kill him."
“Looks like it’s time, sweetheart,” Steve said softly.  “I’ll see you soon.”
“Hey, Mr Rogers!” Peter exclaims, jumping to his feet as soon as Steve steps out onto the pool deck.  “How was your day today?”
"Don't really wanna talk about my father right now, if that's okay with you," Tony whispered. He kissed the same spot again and Steve shivered, clutching Tony even closer to him.
Outside, it was beautiful, the perfect day for a nice, leisurely morning ride on the bike. But as the slightly brisk late-April breeze whipped past Steve's face and whistled in his ears as he drove, Steve was once again reminded of the dream that had driven him out of bed, forcing him to have to focus far more closely on his driving than he normally did.
"But I don't want to be leaning on you," Steve added. "You've got all those bruises all over your back and I'm not gonna be making 'em worse by pressing on 'em."
Except, as the days went by, even Steve had to start to admit that he wasn’t.  Because not only did the bad dreams continue, they grew even more graphic, more terrifying.  Instead of seeing Morita’s bloodied and broken body lying in that rubble, he would see Tony’s, his beautiful eyes completely lifeless as Steve sobbed over him, begging him to come back to him.  And Peter, sweet, loving Peter, who tried so hard to keep Steve’s mood as uplifted as possible, it was his blood-stained and dust-covered hands who kept reaching for Steve’s from underneath the mountains of rubble, begging him to help him find his father.
"Well, I hope so," said Peter.
"Very good, Captain," said JARVIS. "Please be advised that these names are currently all manually reported, which means that—"
“I love you too,” Steve said as another tear trailed down his cheek.  “So much.  Tony, I can’t even tell you—”
"Yeah, I know," Steve said sadly. "If we stick to the base it should be okay. I mean, we are technically working together."
Tony pursed his lips, wrapping his arms around his front in a vain attempt to get himself to stop shaking. He knew he should refuse, just walk out of that room and never look back. It's what a strong person would do.
"And you don't need to call me Mrs Rogers either," she added. "It's way too formal for my taste."
"If Thanos was so pissed off at the Avengers, then why the hell didn't he just attack us? Why attack all of Earth?"
"Yeah," Tony agreed. "I'm gonna keep looking though, see what else I can find."
"Shall we?" he asked.
"Holy shit, there's another one!" cried Major Lorne barely a second later. "Rogers, it's right on you!"
"Oh, but I want to," Tony replied, shooting him a rather cheeky grin. "Besides, aren't orgasms one of nature's best pain relievers?"
At first Steve was too stunned to even respond. Surely the general wasn't trying to imply that Tony had anything to do with the Meridian beam that took out Bucky's aircraft, was he?
“Oh wow!  Thanks!” Peter said as he hugged the box set to his chest.  “Um… but are you sure you're okay with me buying this?  Since it’s so rare?”
"No, Pete, you really don't," Tony stated. "And I don't want to hear another word about it, okay? Don't you be listening to anything Grandpa says about that stuff 'cause none of it's true."
"Okay. And?" Natasha asked. "Based on what I know about quantum physics and everything that you've told me so far, it seems like it's pretty uncontrollable."
"Good," Gwen said, just as a horn honked a few metres away. It was Papa's truck, double-parked on the busy street. "Well, I guess it's time for you to go."
"Well, then let's roll," Clint said. He strapped on his sheath of arrows, poking his head back inside the jet. "Guys? Cap says we're ready!"
"Yes," murmured Steve as he obediently opened his mouth, taking a big sip of the broth. It was only lukewarm, and barely more substantial than water, but his stomach welcomed it eagerly anyway.
"Like the Armed Services Committee?" Steve asked.
"He is badly injured, Mr Stark, but he is alive," Stacy said solemnly. "I saw him myself, so he knows we're here."
"Well… yeah… but he's not exactly the same kind of human as you or me—" Gwen broke off as she caught Peter's
"No, I don't think it's a coincidence either," Steve said. He let out a heavy sigh as he downed the rest of his tea. "I just don't like not knowing what's going on. Especially if it's something that might be important, if that makes any sense."
"Woohoo!" Peter yelped. "We're gonna go skiing!" He threw his arms around Steve's neck, nearly knocking him backwards. "Thank you, Papa! This is gonna be so awesome!"
“I do,” said Steve.  “And I’ve never seen a Road King up close, only in catalogues.  It’s even more gorgeous than I imagined.”
"Yes. Yes, it does, thank you, Tony, I really appreciate it. And I'll be sure the Board doesn't disturb your team retreat. To a private, luxury villa in Italy. Yeah."
"Hi, Steve," said Peter. "You don't look like a doctor?"
Tony gave what he thought was a nonchalant shrug, one that of course Steve saw right through.
But he couldn't. He had spent too much time and overcome too many hurdles to get where he was, and there was no way he was going to jeopardise it now.
Suddenly, a beam of light as bright as a thousand suns burst down from the sky, landing on the battlefield about fifty or so metres away. Stunned war dogs shot out from all directions, yelping in dismay and forcing Steve's attackers to pause just long enough for him to see what appeared to be a massive axe shoot its way out the bottom.
And, no matter how much Dad didn't want to hear it, Peter knew without a doubt that he had no right to stand in its way.
"Ah, yeah," answered Steve. "We heard you were dead!"
"Sounds good, bud," said Dad. "'Cause you know I'm not sure how long we're gonna be today, so—"
"Ah, it's kinda a long story, Pete, okay?" Dad said quickly.
And a huge thank-you to my awesome beta, allthesinnersandthesaints 💖
Alt-Steve said, planting his feet as he raised his shield in the circle's direction. "
"Um… he likes to joke when he's nervous, Doctor," Peter said. "It helps if you don't take it personally."
He wasn't whole.  He had gone through too much to likely ever be so again.  But now he knew without a doubt that he could still live a whole life.
Like the movie he and Gwen were going to see as soon as the school day was over. Peter had been looking forward to their date for over a week now, as it would be the last time he'd get to be alone with Gwen before she left for England.
“Nah, I’m good.”
“He said the only reason he didn’t come to you was because you’ve been so bogged down with work lately and he didn’t want to distract you with his problems,” Steve says.
“Every word.”
As far as Tony can remember, the last time he saw his favorite honeybear make anything more complicated than a simple pasta dish for dinner, they were still sharing an apartment in Boston before Rhodey’s first deployment. After an exhausting week filled with midterms, group projects, and lab reports, he had almost burned down their kitchen while trying to make a roast chicken. Luckily, DUM-E was there to save the day with his trusty fire extinguisher, Tony managed to reset the smoke alarm before the fire department could be alerted, and they ended the night by adding two more empty boxes to the growing pile they named the Leaning Tower of Pizza. Rhodey had vowed then and there to never use the oven again and DUM-E in turn made sure to always be prepared in case of any fire-related emergencies.
Tony makes good on his promise not to speak to Steve the whole time he has to fulfil this bet. When Steve asks a question, instead of responding directly, Tony texts his reply. Sometimes, he even tells JARVIS to relay a message back to Steve. Even when Steve is sitting right there, next to Tony, in the same room.
“I didn’t think it would get this far,” Steve says. “I just wanted to fuck with you for a bit. Mess around and have some fun. I didn’t think you’d
Steve pulls Tony to him, tucking his head under his chin and stroking the hair at the base of his neck. “You have nothing to worry about, love. Jim is fine. Your friendship is as strong as ever.”
“Sweet dreams, darling.”
“I know.”
“...is he okay?” Tony hasn’t seen Rhodey this aggravated in a while.
“We will. We’re better together.”
“We need to head back to the SI booth and stay on the show floor to answer questions for a few hours,” Tony tells them. “Then we promised the R&D team a round of drinks at Caesar’s on us. Why don’t you join us? And we can head out to dinner together afterwards?”
had just told you the truth and been a better friend --- then maybe we could have had a fighting chance against Thanos. Maybe we would have won.”
“Uh huh.”
Maybe he’s starting to feel a little left out.
Steve shrugs. “Suit yourself.”
Tony nods and quiets down, thinking back on the last few weeks now that he finally has the context. He guesses it does make a certain amount of sense, for Rhodey to spend more time with Steve than usual to learn more about his best friend. If anything, it’s definitely a smart move. There’s no one else in a better position to dole out advice for this particular situation.
“But I like being distracted with his problems!” He’s well aware that he’s whining at this point. He takes a couple deep breaths, then deflates, arms uncrossing and hands falling into his lap instead, which Steve promptly takes into his own. “I was worried about him,” he mumbles. “I know he wasn’t deliberately avoiding me or anything, but even just that tiny bit of distance felt wrong.”
our robot sons wanted your attention
“Hey now, Buckaroo, you can admit you’re getting sick of being around me. I mean, I sure as hell am tired of looking at your ugly mug all day.” Tony laughs and dodges as Bucky reaches out to shove at his shoulder. “You’re right though. We’re really lucky. To have them as our best friends.”
They head back into the compound. For the first time in what feels like years, Tony’s chest feels lighter.
Tony loves Steve’s new look. He loves the longer hair, how he can tug at the locks when they’re kissing and it always sends a shiver down Steve’s spine. Tony loves the beard, the way it feels on his skin as Steve trails his lips down Tony’s body. He just really loves the new look and he wouldn’t mind if Steve decides to keep it.
The worst is when the press takes notice of Steve’s tie and cufflinks and start hounding him with questions on why he’s chosen to wear these accessories to the event. Is he going to be a guest lecturer at Harvard soon? Did he make a recent donation to the school? How does his MIT alumni husband feel about this? His MIT alumni husband, who poses for pictures with him while flashing his shiny class ring for the press.
“You wanna go help Jim out a bit? He’s...struggling.”
Steve nods harder.
“I’m finally allowed to know what it is?”
Oh no.
“Because I’m an expert on the thing he needs help with.”
The next morning, while Steve is in the shower, Tony scrolls through his phone in bed. Apparently a lot of people got pictures of them during their date, and everyone has something to say about Steve’s new look.
“I hate that you think so low of yourself.” Steve takes a deep breath, and Tony can feel the Big Inspirational Speech coming. “I know I haven’t been a good friend to you. If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have changed how I acted towards you. You deserved better.”
“Alright. Fine. Tell me what I need to do.”
yes ♥︎
Tony will admit, it was mildly annoying.
“Hmm?”
Tony doesn’t listen and instead turns back to the mirror and starts lathering shaving cream all over his own face.
“No! That’s not the issue! I just can’t believe he kept this a secret from me!” And to that Rhodey was always the person that Tony would reach out to whenever he needed to figure out his own feelings and relationships. It’s definitely a little upsetting to think that his best friend didn’t come to him to talk about this when the tables were turned. He knows Bucky pretty well too, after having worked so extensively with him on his arm and the SI prosthetics line. Tony could’ve helped too!
“Huh. I didn’t realize they were hanging out so much. But me too, I’m glad.”
“Yes you were, and no you didn’t explicitly, but the implications were clear, even if you obviously know that friends can’t be stolen.” Steve rolls his eyes fondly. “But anyway, it looks like this mission is about to be officially over. Do you want to know what I was helping him with?”
Tony quickly lets go of the jealousy comment, more intrigued by the fact that he can finally find out what the hell is going on with his friend.
“Much. Thank you.” He stretches out on the couch, hooking his arm behind Steve’s head so that he’d follow Tony down, settling on top of him. He reels Steve in and kisses him until they’re both breathless. Steve pulls back for only a handful of seconds before they’re both leaning in again, this time meeting for a softer, more tender brush of their lips. Slowly, they fall back into a steady rhythm of affectionate touches and gentle caresses.
“Your goatee?”
“That’s good to hear.”
bucky doesn’t know anything about flowers but if you want to give him something meaningful i’d suggest a bouquet of carnations with yellow and orange roses
“Excuse me?”
“Hey.”
Not to mention, he absolutely would have loved to have the opportunity to give Rhodey a bit of a hard time now that he has his own super crush on a supersoldier. It’s what he deserves, after all the grief he gave Tony back when he was still harboring what he thought were unrequited feelings for Steve.
He heads to the kitchen to get started on dinner. It doesn’t take long to decide what to make. He knows the grovelling process should start now if he wants to be forgiven soon, so Steve settles on making Tony’s favourite -- carbonara, from the recipe that Maria had passed down, and chocolate bread pudding for dessert, a dish Steve learned from his mother.
Steve looks away and Tony can see a single tear tracking its way down his cheek. Steve roughly wipes it away before going on.
“Okay, sounds easy enough.”
up to something. There's no doubt about it because, well, Steve just loves being a little shit sometimes.
“Thanks, honey. It’s kind of weird though, isn’t it?” Tony sighs. “I think I’m gonna avoid going out in public for a while. Wait a couple weeks for this baby to grow back in.”
“Yes! We all do!” Tony exclaims. He takes the bowl away from his friend and steers him towards the baking tray next to Steve. “So why don’t we leave the taters alone for now and help Steve with these cookies instead? I promise, this is so much more fun.”
“–Bucky does, too!” Steve interjects.
Steve laughs. “Nah. We were just out for drinks.” One of his eyebrows ticks up in amusement. “We actually
“I know.”
A long and heavy sigh escapes from Steve’s lips as Bruce drops a heavy stack of clothes on the table. “You know, Tony’s not going to talk to me all week.”
“Because let me tell you, Tony. These last two years were horrible. I told you, during the mess with Ultron, that we’d always do things together and I broke that promise. It keeps me awake at night knowing that if we hadn’t split the team up, if we had just talked --- if
God, he loves days like this.
“That’s not what I mean.” Steve takes a deep breath. “Listen, Tony. This feeling isn’t new.” He looks down, seemingly uncertain how to continue.
They all settle into their seats at the table and dig in, making casual conversation throughout the meal. Steve savours every moment, knowing that this will be the last civil moment he’ll have with his husband for the rest of the week.
They work in companionable silence after that, and while Tony helps Steve mix up a new batch of cookie dough, he notices the stiff lines of Rhodey’s shoulders start to loosen as he gets into the rhythm of the work. He occasionally sneaks glances at the oven, likely nervous to see how the food he placed inside earlier will turn out. But with Steve around to guide things along, Tony’s sure that Rhodey will be pleasantly surprised at how great this dinner will taste.
“No, I’m gonna,” Tony insists. He crosses his arms in front of his chest. He knows he’s acting like a petulant child and Steve shouldn’t have to deal with his tantrum, but he can’t help it.
He must have passed out at some point because next thing he knows, he’s waking up in a bed with soft sheets, with machines beeping around him and a slight tug on his right hand where he must be connected to an IV drip. He opens his eyes and takes a look around.
So it’s not like Steve and Rhodey
“To be fair, I didn’t think I would shave it all off either. I
It’s date night and Steve wants to get cleaned up before heading out to dinner. Tony, wanting to see the beard for as long as he can, hops up on the bathroom counter to keep Steve company as he shaves.
"So?" he smirked. His arms wrapped around my neck and he pressed a quick to my lips.
"In that case, want to go dance?" He smirked.
"Oh, Steve," he said, softly. He turned me on my side and cupped my cheek. "I never came to you because I didn't think you were ready."
"I am?" I asked.
"Let's go," I said, trying to walk through the doorway again. I still couldn’t go through; and Tony was still laughing.
"Damn," he whispered.
"People are staring at us," I said. He looked around to see nearly everyone staring at us.
"T-then why are you always jerking off? If I was enough, you'd come to me," I said, my voice shaking more than I would have wanted it to be.
"Ah! No touching!" I scolded, grabbing his wrist.
"How...?" I asked.
"Yeah, but it won't let us out of your lab, Tony!" I said.
"I'll be back in a bit," she said. She left and I got in the shower. When I got out, she was sitting on my bed with bags surrounding her.
"More! Please," I repeated, trying to thrust back on him. He pushed all the way in and stayed there as he leaned over me, pressing his font into my back.
"Damnit," he breathed. He looked down at me and turned around, grabbing a tissue from god knows where and wiped my face down.
"W-what?" He mocked my tone.
"What do you mean, Steve? Of course, you're good enough for me," he said, turning on his side to face me, "You're more than good enough." I still didn't turn to face him.
"Positive," he stated, grabbing my wrist and pulling me to the empty desk. He pushed me against it and set his hands on my hips, keeping me in place. He pressed his lips to mine, possessively and ran his tongue along my lower lip. I didn't open my mouth and he pulled away.
"You don't have to thank me. I was one, too, you know? A long time ago, but I was one, I remember wanting my first time to be special, too, so don't feel bad because I want more. We'll take this as slow as you want," he said, softly.
"So... are we doing this or not?" I asked.
"Sliver berries. What does that have to do with anything?" I asked.
"I want this, I really do, because I like you a lot, but- just- just not here, not now," I breathed, my arms wrapping around his neck and his hands resting on my hips.
"Hey Tony," I said.
"Don’t worry, I'll take it out tonight," he smirked.
"O-okay," he stuttered, thrusting slightly into my mouth.  I sighed and stood up, putting my mouth on his ear.
"No! No, it's just- I, um..." I trailed, hoping he got my point.
"For what? I thought that was hot," he smirked, kissing me again, his tongue sliding back into my mouth. I blushed as he continued, and noticed Bucky smirking at me from a distance. I pulled back and Tony set his hands on my hips, grinding against my front.
"Please," he whispered. I smirked and pulled both his pants and boxers down to mid-thigh. My eyes widened at his much-larger-than-average size, and I smirked up at him before licking at the tip, just barely touching it. He gasped, his hand still resting in my hair and he bucked forward.
"Oh," I blushed. "You can move." He slowly pulled out and pushed back in, building up a rhythm.
"Are you sure you want this, Steve?" He asked, his fingers ready to pull my pajama pants down.
"Not yet, Baby," he murmured. I sighed and rolled my eyes, spinning us around and pinning him to the pool side.
"Wear the black one!" Peggy shouted from the other side of the door.
Next: black skinnies with dark purple band tee. Maybe
"Oh, Steve, I'm sorry," Tony said, wiping away a stray tear sliding down my cheek.
"Whatever," she groaned.
"If you're okay with that, yes," he said, biting his lip.
"I- uh, - don't actually know how to dance," I said, shyly.
"I wanted to see you swim," he shrugged.
"That sounded a little stalker-ish," I stated.
"Yes," he said, starting to push me towards him. Bucky was always stronger than me. He shoved me into him.
"Yeah, but-"
"So, what? It's not like they don’t already know we're dating," he said.
"Steve, you need to get out more, this is your first high school party, isn't it?" She asked.
"Do it again," I said, looking up at him.
"I'm sorry, I wanted to see my boyfriend shirtless and soaking wet," he said.
"For fuck's sake, Tony, I want you to fuck my mouth," I growled, biting his ear. I pulled away and he stared at me,
"Of course, they do! It's a party!" Maria groaned.
"Prep?" He whispered against the shell of my ear. I shook my head.
"Hey! Steve!" Bucky yelled from a table.
"Holy shit!" I moaned.
"Yes?" He whispered back.
"Fuck! Tony! I'm-" I didn’t get to finish my sentence before I was painting the desk white and Tony was spilling inside of me.
"Tony, please," I grunted as one of his hands very slowly slid into the back of my trunks.
"Hang on," Tony walked to the door and pushed.
"So, you're not...?" He asked.
"I don't care," he said, then smirked. "Although, if it's making you uncomfortable, we could always continue this elsewhere."
"I hate you," I sighed, bringing the curtain to cover the glass doors.
"Yes... and his boyfriend just dumped him... he's single," she sang.
"I have got absolutely no idea, but make me do it again," I stated. He smirked and leaned down, biting a bit harder. I let out the same noise, just a bit louder. He made his way down my chest, biting and sucking marks into my unfairly pale skin, and to my stomach. He traced the lines of my abs with his tongue and I shivered again
"Jarvis, drain and clean the cool, would ya?" He asked.
"Really, ah, how's that?" He shuddered.
"Fuck!" he shouted, yanking on my hair. I moaned, which sent vibrations through Tony. He bucked into my mouth and I choked a little. My eyes widened.
"I'm ready," I muttered. He pulled his fingers out and I whined at the loss, but soon enough, his head was pushing in. He pushed in until he was fully seated, and waited. My eyes squeezed shut, tears pricking in the corners of them.
"Do that again," I said, my voice hoarse. I put my mouth just on the tip and waited.
"I can’t believe we have to have sex in your lab! Where would we even do it? There is literally only one surface available, and that can’t be very-" I stopped my words when I saw his eyes darken.
"Why not?" He smirked at me.
"What? I'm just saying," she smirked. I rolled my eyes and she handed me a pair of combat boots.
"Yes," Tony smirked.
"Yep," he smirked, swinging the curtain shut again. He walked back over to me and mouthed at my ear.
"Still loose from last night," I said, grinding back on him. He was already hard again. He undid my jeans and pressed a quick kiss to the small of back before thrusting in, still wet with my saliva. I cried out, lurching forward. He waited for me to adjust before pulling out and slamming back in. I moaned and bit my lip. He started an, antagonizing, slow, pace, running his hands up my back, to my shoulder, and then back down.
"Come on, Tony. In here?" I asked.
"I may be a virgin, but I do know how to get rid of these," I smirked, running my fingertips along the bulge in his jeans.
"Yes?" I smirked. He crushed his lips to mine and I opened my mouth in a gasp. His tongue dove in and explored my mouth. I moaned and he tightened his grip on my hips. The kiss was sloppy, all tongues and teeth, and he pressed his hips onto mine, grinding roughly. I grunted and pulled away for air. I leaned back in, hungrily and bit and pulled on his bottom lip. I pulled away, but left my lips against to his,
“I think you guys are doing fine without me,” Tony replies. His voice is hoarse. He hardly speaks anymore. He doesn’t have a lot to say these days. “You don’t need me. I’ll just make things worse.”
“We’re doing okay, I guess.” He turns to Tony fully. “But every time I walk into that room and talk to the team, I get this nagging feeling that something’s missing. Someone. Is missing.”
“Is something going on with Rhodey?” Tony asks, leaning against his side of the double sink in their ensuite. He’s on the last step of his skincare routine, applying anti-fatigue serum onto his face and wrapping it all up with a few dabs of eye cream. “Because, I’m not kidding, he swore on DUM-E’s code that he’d never touch an oven again so you understand why his behavior today is weird to me?”
“Like, band tees and dirty jeans?”
“He was asking you for
“You don’t need to remind me what we’re facing right now, Cap. We’ve lost a lot of people.”
Several mornings now, Tony had gone into the kitchen to see the two of them making breakfast smoothies after apparently going on a run together. One time, just as he was about to leave the office, he’d texted Steve to see if he was free for dinner only to find out that he and Rhodey had gone out for happy hour somewhere. And just a few days ago, Rhodey had canceled lunch with Tony and Pepper at the last minute because he had been caught up running some errands with Steve in Brooklyn and had lost track of time.
He’d brought Bucky with him as his R&D partner and sort of the live demonstration of what they have in store for the future of prosthetics. Truth be told, if Bucky hadn’t fought tooth and nail to escape from Hydra and come back into Steve’s life with a malfunctioning arm and damaged nerves, Tony never would have ventured into this area to begin with. As far as he’s concerned, Bucky deserves all the recognition for his own work and sacrifices, for overcoming decades of trauma and brainwashing, and helping to build a brighter future for the world.
Bucky grins. “Fuck yeah, I’m always down for beer and carbs.”
Steve steps in and sets the tray down on the coffee table in front of them before taking a seat on the other end of the sofa.
“Why? I did this to myself.”
“I missed you. Everyday.”
“Honey, why is Rhodey spamming you with texts when he hasn’t responded to any of my messages for at least a day?”
“You’ll survive.”
“...okay but if they do end up burning or anything less than perfect, does that mean I get to eat them?”
Date night goes well. Steve and Tony have a good time, despite Tony’s initial grumbling.
“When you guys came to Vegas for our conference?”
“Honey……what are you doing?”
while Rhodey’s proclaims
“A toast?” Steve asks.
A little while later, he hears Tony and Rhodey’s voices filtering in from the hallway and braces himself for what he’s sure to be a whole boatload of judgment.
“Nothing!” Steve exclaims. “I just like looking at you.”
also stop ignoring my texts wtf honeybear
As Steve lathers the shaving cream on his face, Tony notices that his eyes keep sliding over to Tony and the corner of Steve’s mouth twitches up constantly. He knows, immediately, that Steve’s up to something and asks, “What? Why are you looking at me like that?”
After a couple minutes, Tony pulls back. “So should we get started?”
“Oh, I don’t know, sweetheart. I think I’m on Jim’s side for this one.” Steve chuckles.
Tony’s heart feels full to bursting knowing that Steve and Rhodey had flown across the country to cheer them on in person, and he instantly feels his media-ready smile slip into something more genuine. He nudges Bucky to hurry off the stage and together they make their way towards their friends.
“What?” Steve scowls. “Do I not look good with a goatee?”
Why didn’t Rhodey ask Tony? He can cook, too.
The first thing Steve does is go down to the workshop to find his husband. Sure, they were in each other’s orbit all week, but Steve still misses Tony. He’s so glad things can go back to normal, and Tony can speak to him again, and they can make up for the awful week he’s sure they both just had.
Steve closes the distance between them and pulls Tony back into his chest. “You still look amazing though.”
) while Steve adds generous helpings of chocolate chunks and macadamia nuts into the batter of cookie dough at the counter behind him.
Steve nods.
Tony turns to find Steve standing at the door instead of Rhodey, holding a tray filled with plates of pasta and chocolate cake. It smells delicious, but Tony hasn’t had an appetite since before...
“We could really use your help, you know.”
To his left are floor-to-ceiling windows that look out to a familiar lawn. Tony’s back at Avengers Compound.
“Yeah, don’t worry about it,” Rhodey adds. “Pepper had offered to get us those upgraded passes when we asked her to help get us in here, but we’re really only here for you.” He turns to Bucky. “We want to take you guys out for celebratory dinner and drinks, though, after you’re finished here for the day.”
“Hmm?” Steve sits up too, snaking his arms around Tony’s waist and resting his head on his shoulder from behind. “What’s he saying?”
“That can wait. Come on. Let’s take a walk.”
“Feeling better?”
“Good, you should. You guys will have fun,” Steve responds softly, already beginning to drift off to sleep. “G’night, love.”
And Tony has to admit that Steve looks
“Why don’t we do that?”
Setting his phone down, Tony feels infinitely more relaxed now that he’s got the reassurance of both his boyfriend and his best friend that everything is okay.
“Tony, wait a minute.” Steve, wide-eyed, takes a step backward. “Let’s not do anything rash, okay?”
The first time Tony notices this budding friendship between Steve and Rhodey, he’s in Las Vegas at CES, showcasing Stark Industries’ latest innovations in prosthetic technology.
But thank you. For the advice.
“No, no, that’s fine. We just wanted to surprise the two of you and show our support,” Steve says.
“Good morning,” Steve croaks, then clears his throat and tries again. “This all looks delicious. Thank you guys.”
On days like this, they like to take their time with each other. For all that they enjoy running their hands all over each other and littering marks scattered throughout one another’s body, they also simply love kissing. So this lazy Sunday, where they don’t have anything or anyone to answer to, finds them curled towards each other on their oversized couch, spending minutes—maybe even hours, who’s counting at this point—just leisurely making out, with no intention to take it any further until perhaps much later.
“What? Why wouldn’t he ask me?!”
Tony narrows his eyes at Steve. “…right.”
Judging by the smirk that’s creeping onto Bruce’s face, Steve is not going to like what he’ll say next.
Tony gasps theatrically. “He’s withholding cookies! That has to count as cruel and unusual punishment.”
“Shit. Tony, I’m so sorry.”
“Steve, you’re such an idiot.”
it. Steve
“I forgot! I just knew that I couldn’t get drunk, so I figured I’d win! And I really wanted to get him to reenact the whole Single Ladies video, so I agreed to the bet!”
Rhodey pours himself a glass of water as he waves back. “It was alright. Mostly slept the whole way through. There was a bit of turbulence, which is always awful, but it's nothing I’m not used to anyway.”
Tony frowns. “Sweetheart, if you want me to wear skin tight workout shirts with you then that’s not happening. That’s your thing, not mine.”
“Bet’s over.”
! He absorbs alcohol like it’s water!”
“Yeah, alright.”
“You’re sure?”
Tony lets out a sigh and swings his legs off the couch to sit upright and reach for the phone. He picks it up and taps it awake, eyebrows raising at the notifications on the screen.
Tony doesn’t look at Steve, addressing Rhodey instead as he continues to speak. “More of a cheer. Actually, a song.”
“These last two years have been brutal, I’m not gonna lie. Being on the run wasn’t the most glamorous lifestyle, but we made do. We went on missions and tried to help as many people as we could. I’m proud of what we achieved. But I never stopped thinking about how much better things would have been if we had you with us.”
A moment later, Tony returns with the coffee pot and three mugs. He pours each person a cup and sits down next to Rhodey, barely even sparing Steve another glance.
“Alright. I believe you.”
A face he hasn’t seen since the early 90s pops up in front of his vision. “Carol Danvers,” he chokes out. “Am I hallucinating, or is your hair really glowing?”
Tony only got a brief glimpse of the messages, trying not to invade his boyfriend’s privacy too much, even if the matter at hand happens to be related to his best friend. “I only saw a few words here and there. Something about ‘going to do it’ and flowers?” He hands the phone to Steve so he can unlock it and read the texts in full.
It’s still strange that after decades of surviving on simple meals and takeout, Rhodey’s suddenly interested in cooking again. Tony wonders if it’s just that Rhodey is trying to find things to fill his time now that he’s officially been honorably discharged from the Air Force, or if there’s something else going on with him.
The next day, Steve wakes up to the sound of plates being set down on the coffee table in front of him. He opens his eyes to see that Tony and Rhodey have apparently made breakfast for all three of them, and are bringing the dishes out to eat in the living room. The two of them are wearing matching MIT shirts, which isn’t generally out of the norm, but judging by their shit eating grins, they’re doing it mostly to fuck with Steve this particular morning.
They walk in silence for a while before stopping near the helipad. There, Steve shuffles his feet a bit, as if he’s contemplating what he wants to say to Tony next. Tony can feel the tension between them building up and his eyes start darting around as he tries to form an escape plan.
“Sounds good. You guys do your thing and text us later so we know when to head over. In the meantime Steve and I are gonna go check out some of the sports tech.”
Regardless, Tony can’t help but burst out, “That little shit!”
Tony gets up and goes with him.
They’re both wearing aprons with silly slogans—Steve’s says
Rhodey rolls his eyes. “You only say that because you like it with lumps. They’re not supposed to have lumps, Tony.”
Not that Tony’s disparaging Steve’s cooking skills. In fact, Steve’s an excellent cook. Their best dates are always the ones where Steve’s making the meal, no matter if they’re full five-course meals or a simple stir fry. It makes sense for him to be the person to go to if someone wanted to expand their horizons in the kitchen. But
“Thank you, honey,” Tony says as he takes a step back from Steve’s arms to quickly give Rhodey a hug. He flicks at the event pass hanging from a lanyard around Steve’s neck. “I didn’t realize you guys were coming, otherwise I would’ve asked for the Deluxe Conference Pass for you.”
It takes a few days before he’s back on his feet. In the time since half the population turned into dust and Tony went missing, the Rogue Avengers --- what’s left of them, at least --- have returned to New York to work out plans to undo the havoc that Thanos’ snap had caused. Tony hangs back and lets them do their thing, not wanting to interfere with anything. He’s too tired. Too exhausted. He doesn’t want to think about everything he experienced in the last month. Getting stabbed. Losing the kid. Almost starving to death. He wishes he could forget.
, Steve! I’m shaving my goatee! There’s only room for one person in this relationship to have a goatee, and if you insist on keeping yours then I’m getting rid of mine.” With that, Tony swipes the razor across his jaw and for the first time in over twenty years, he sees his bare chin.
“We can still get those for you now, if you want,” Bucky suggests.
Steve smiles brightly, eyes sparkling with mirth. “Yes. Are you ready?”
“We’ll do better this time,” Tony mumbles into Steve’s chest.
Tony scans the comments and decides he really can’t take this anymore.
(That’s another thing they do now—communicate. Like actual adults in a healthy relationship. Younger, emotionally constipated Tony would never believe this.)
“I was showing him around all the spots in Brooklyn that were important to Bucky before the neighborhood was gentrified.”
Steve is softly nibbling a path up the line of Tony’s jaw when three short bursts of buzzing sounds from one of their phones on the coffee table. They pause for a second, keen to ignore it and get back to kissing, when the phone starts up again, vibrating five more times to indicate a total of eight messages that someone’s decided to send so urgently.
“So he wanted to…”
Later that night, as they’re getting ready for bed together—because that’s a thing they do now, they’re comfortable and sappy and basically already married—Tony brings up his concerns with Steve.
Tomorrow, Tony decides, he’s going to ask Rhodey to work on a fun new project in the lab with him. Maybe if Rhodey insists on learning to cook more, they can work on designing a new kitchen assistant, build another bot son just like they did back in the day at MIT.
They while away the time on Sunday by lazing around the penthouse together, locking down their floor so their friends can’t come barging in unannounced like they’re wont to do. They’d both been so busy lately that it’s been rare for them to just bask in each other’s company like this, and Tony’s really enjoying it. He can’t wait for the promotional campaign for the SI prosthetics launch to simmer down a bit, so he can spend more time at home with Steve and the team instead of his office fifteen floors below. Not that he doesn’t like working with the bright minds of his R&D team on innovating for the future, but there’s nothing quite like being with family.
I wasn’t ignoring you. I thought those blurry pics you sent were just the bots messing around with your phone
A third of the way through, Steve pauses and smirks at Tony. “So I was thinking.”
“Well, for starters,” Steve says, “how about matching goatees?” He gently wipes his face with a towel and turns from the mirror to Tony with a giant shit-eating grin. A giant shit-eating grin that’s now framed by a perfectly trimmed goatee.
“Yes, exactly. I love you, honey, but I can’t accept any Harvard gear in this household.”
“Yes. Tell me.”
After the plates are clear, Steve helps bring the dishes to the sink. As he walks the short distance from the kitchen table to the counter, a butter knife slips off a plate, but Rhodey manages to catch it.
By the time Bruce is done, Steve can feel a few stray tears prickling at his eyes. He’s not going to survive this week.
“Before we eat,” Tony says, “I’d like to make a toast.”
Now that his internal turmoil has settled, Tony goes through a mental checklist of things he’ll have to take care of in the near future: lunch with Rhodey tomorrow so he can make fun of him for his little crush; upgrades for Sam’s wings and Nat’s batons for their next training session; a shovel talk for Bucky once Rhodey finally asks him out, you know, just for appearances; and a shopping trip to find a present for Pepper’s birthday.
"Uh. No thanks, I'm good," I said.
"Are you sure I'm enough for you? I mean, you could have anybody on this stinkin' planet if you wanted, and y-you chose me. Why me, when you could have someone like Pepper, or Clint, or Phil? Why wouldn't you choose someone that wasn't just a science experiment? Why, if you could have someone so much better than I am, would you choose me?" I said, more and more tears making a searing trail down my face.
"OW! What was that for?" She whined.
"Ah," I gasped as his warm, wet mouth surrounded me.
"Well, that was interesting," I said.
"Definitely," I said.
"Fuck!" He yelled, his hand tightening in my hair. I moaned around him and he bucked forwards a bit, making me gag. I pulled off.
"Don’t mock me," I pouted, "And why do we have to do this? Who even put up the mistletoe?"
"W-what?" He asked.
"Damn," he moaned. I pull up and did it over and over again until he was trembling. I scraped my teeth along the base, teasingly.
"Relax, Steve, it'll get better," he assured. I nodded, knowing it would. As I said before, I had done it before, but it's been a while. He slowly pumped in and out, and, when he felt I was ready, he added a second, I winced, but soon adjusted. He added a third not long after and I squeezed my eyes shut. A few minutes later, I was on the verge of desperate.
"O-okay," I said, still unsure. He started moving back and forth against me, not actually putting any pressure between us, which I was grateful for, I didn’t know if I could handle the embarrassment if he did. I slowly started swaying with him and closed my eyes. He put his hands on my hips pulled me closer to him, grinding against me. My eyes shot open and I blushed a bright red colour, my eyes searching for Bucky or Peggy. I couldn't find them, so I just rolled with it.
"Are you going to throw your Christmas party this year?" I asked.
"Steve, trust me. I can take it. I have a lot of experience," he smirked, then swallowed me back down.
"Oh, you have no idea," he smirked.
"Did I do something wrong?" He asked, taking a large step back.
"T-Tony," I warned as he kissed along my jaw.
"Good God, Steve, of course, you can," he breathed. I smirked backed him into a wall, then sank to my knees. Thanks to a very, very, vivid demonstration by Bucky, I know exactly what to do to get him off, and how to drive him nuts.
"Hmm. I love your reactions. Well, have fun," Loki smirked as he turned away.
"Jesus, that music is loud," I groaned, taking off my helmet. I took her helmet and we walked in. I kept my head down as she dragged me through the sea of people.
"Close your eyes, Babe," he sang. I sighed and shut my eyes. He wrapped his arms around my waist. He shoved something in me and I gasped, bucking forward.
"A-am I good enough for you?" I stuttered, tears beginning to prick the backs of my eyes.
"Ah!" I gasped as he dragged his teeth up my length
"Ah!" He laughed, "take a closer look at it!" I looked up and noticed silver berries on the mistletoe.
"Thanks, Buddy," Tony said.
"No, actually, I'm quite curious. What does he never do?" I asked Pepper.
"Turn around, Steve," he ordered. I still didn’t move and he grabbed my chin and made me look at him. I was smirking at him, smugly.
"Don’t make me make you turn around," he stated. I stood still, smirking.
"Too bad. Nat will force you to go, if she has to," Maria said.
"I told you not to mock me," I stated, "and are you sure no one's going to hear us?"
"Fuck," he gasped as I teasingly dragged my teeth up his length. I was running out of breath but was trying to stay under as long as I could. Another perk of the super soldier serum, I could hold my breath for longer periods of time than most.
"Yeah. It's hotter than hell out," he said, "The air conditioner is on the fritz and Jarvis can't figure out what's wrong with it."
"Tony," I warned/whined.
"Oi!" I said. "I don't want to go... My mom says that people get drunk at parties."
"Cool," I smiled as he finished my suit I grabbed it and we both walked to the doorway. We walked through it together, but we couldn’t actually get out of the door way.
"You know you love me," I smiled, kissing him, lightly.
"Kissing you," he breathed, leaning in and closing the gap between us. I closed my eyes, his tongue running along my lower lip. I opened my mouth and his tongue slid inside. I moaned into the kiss and immediately pulled back, covering my mouth.
"Next time?" I asked.
"Holy shoot!" I moaned.
"Tony, we're locked in your lab, and you're laughing? What amuses you about this situation?" I asked.
"It's okay," I smiled, "You weren't in my mouth, so nothing happened." He smiled and stroked my hair, gently. I took the head in my mouth and swirled my tongue around the head. I pulled off and licked a stripe from the base to the tip, then took him as far down as I could.
"Loki says that if there are silver berries of the mistletoe, we have to fuck," he laughed, bent over.
"Yeah," he agreed, getting his clothes on. I started to get mine on, but he stopped me.
"Why can't I just wear my tennis shoes?" I asked.
"Who says I was asking?" I asked. I slid to my knees and traced the bump in his trousers. He visibly shivered and I smirked to myself. I popped the button on his way-too-tight jeans and pulled them down, his boxers following suit. I licked the head and took him in. He moaned, grabbing a fistful of my hair. I took him deeper with each bob of my head. He gripped my hair tighter and I looked up at him through my eyelashes with my most innocent-looking, blue eyes. He stared into my eyes for a moment before I smirked around and swallowed him whole.
"Shit," I gasped.
"Tony," I moaned. He moaned around me as I pulled on his hair and I slowly bucked up, involuntarily.
"Steve," he whined. I smirked and pulled down the zipper on his jeans with my teeth, a technique used by Bucky.
"Yep," he said, "Now you can get dressed."
"Tony," I whined, shifting uncomfortably.
"Turn around, Darling," he purred. I stayed put, smirking. I knew it pissed him off when I didn’t listen.
"No, Steve. I have no idea what's going on," he answered, pushing at it as well. He glanced up and busted a gut, laughing.
"Stevie," he muttered, his lips trailing down my neck, leaving small bites and bruises in his wake.
"Oh, yeah, here," he smiled, leaning over the side of the bed. He came back with an unopened bottle.
"Ugh," I groaned as I slid on my clothes.
"Hmm. Well, maybe I want to see my boyfriend shirtless and soaking wet," I smirked.
"Uh, no," I chuckled.
"You're wearing shorts," I said.
"Wanna suck you off," I breathed.
I've been with Tony for a little over a year now, and I'm happy. Well, mostly happy. Lately. I've noticed that Tony has been... oh, shoot, what's the word? What is it called now-a-days? -oh! Yeah. Jerking off a lot lately. I'm starting to think he's becoming bored with me. I'm not a virgin, definitely not, and I know he isn't either, so maybe he just doesn't want to have sex with me. Maybe I'm just not good enough for him. He hasn't ever confronted me about the topic, so I figured that must be the reason; I'm not good enough. I knew I wanted it, but I guessed he didn’t, so I asked him or talked to him about it. That was possibly the biggest mistake I've ever made with him.
"Why?" I asked, turning to face him. Tony pressed against me and wrapped his arms around my waist.
"Just follow my lead and let the music take over," he smiled, turning me back around.
"Can I show you?" I smirked.
"Ngh, more," I grunted.
"As you wish, Sir," the AI responded.
"Now, let see what you've got," she said as we entered my room.
"Let go," he urged, actually biting my thigh. I moaned loudly, the sting of the bite way more pleasurable than it should've been. I came all over his hand.
"What brings you down here?" I asked.
"Because why?" Tony pressed.
"Damn, you look hot, Stevie," Bucky smirked, hitting my butt.
"But you never even bothered to ask, Tony," I said, shakily. "That's what made me upset, was that fact that you never even considered that I might be ready. At least if I wasn't good enough for you, you could have told me, and we could've ended it and forget about it, but the fact that you never stopped to think I might actually want to, hurt worse than ending it would have."
"Because, they don't go with the outfit, put them on because I still have to put my dress on," she said
"Tony," I whined, arching into him.
"Damn right I do," he smirked, yanking me under the water.
"Tony, stop," I said, slightly breathless.
"Oh, fuck oFF," I gasped as Tony squeezed my thigh.
"Tony? Is this your idea of a joke?" I demanded, pushing at the invisible barrier.
"But it's illegal! I don't want to go!" I said.
"Thank you, Tony," I smiled.
"Tony, listen, I," I said, quietly.
"Yeah, otherwise, I wouldn't do this," he said, spinning around to face me. His face was inches from mine and he was staring at my lips.
"Yes," I said, firmly, then sank back down. I continued with the slower than molasses pace of unbuttoning his pants, but then Tony gripped my hair.
"Yeah," I blushed.
"I-I don't care, I don't want to go!" I said, firmly.
"I'll have to remember that for next time," he whispered.
"Oh," I said, turning back to face him
"No buts! You're coming. Everyone else is, too, so it's not like you'll be the only weirdo there," she smiled.
"B-because," I stuttered.
"Yep," he answered, "and everyone is invited, even Bucky, and Loki."
"Absolutely prefect," he said, then spun me around. His fingers were removed from me and I whined at the loss, but soon his head was at my entrance. He slowly pushed in and I moaned, hoarsely. He bit into my shoulder and I moaned again.
"Hey, Tony?" I asked as we stared up at the ceiling in his room. We had been sharing room since a few months into the relationship, and I enjoyed the warmth and comfort he provided, especially after a night terror.
"You're a virgin," Tony breathed.
"What?" I asked, my voice strained.
"Get some!" He yelled, then ran away.
"I love you, too, Tony," I whispered ack and he pulled away to pull my shirt off. I smiled at him as he traced a line down my side to my hips and he smiled back. He leaned back in for a kiss and I wrapped my arms around his neck.
"Oh, I think you can do better than that," he taunted, twisting his hips to hit just the right spot inside me. I gasped and pushed back on him, trying to make him hit that spot again. He pulled out.
"Hey Steve. That's a nice look on you," he smirked.
"Hmm?" He hummed.
"Well, I fuck you over the desk," he stated, biting on my neck. I gasped.
"Bucky!" I yelled, as Tony turned around.
"Really? Steve, say it," Tony said.
"You're a natural," Tony whispered in my ear. I shuddered.
"It was," I said, shyly.
"Did you just cuss?" Tony asked, pulling off.
"What's all that?" I asked, eyeing the bags suspiciously.
"You know, you're kinky for a super hero," I smirked at him.
"Well, knowing that I'm the only one who can make you feel that good, is hot as fuck," he smirked, then took back into his mouth.
"Shh, we're almost there," he said. I sighed and he opened the door to a large walk-in closet to what I assumed was a guest room. He pressed his lips on mine again and I pulled away.
"Let's go, Steve," he smirked, dragging me off by the wrist. Bucky caught a glimpse of me and raised an eyebrow. I just shrugged and let myself be pulled along through the large house.
"Faster, Please, Tony," I panted, getting impatient.
"Okay," he drawled, gripping my hair in both hands and thrusting gently and shallowly into my mouth. At least, that's what he was doing at first. Eventually, he was forcing himself all they down my throat, making me choke a bit. I looked up at him like before, batting my eyes.
"What is so damn funny, Stark?" I demanded.
"Hmm?" I hummed, unable to form coherent words.
"Good. We should probably get back to the party," he said.
"Thank you," I said.
"I said we have to fuck. What's so wrong with that? I mean, it's not like we haven’t before," he said.
"Sure...?" I asked, giving Pepper a confused look. She just shooed us off and Tony dragged me to the middle of swaying bodies. He spun me around so his front was against my back and started dancing against me. I turned back around.
"Yes, please do," I murmured back as he slipped his hand up the bottom of my shirt. His fingers lightly danced across my sides, barely brushing the skin. I shivered and he moved to switch our positions. He straddled my hips and rested his hands up by my head.
"Fine," I sighed, grabbing the black outfit. I got dressed, struggling with the tight jeans. I slid the band tee over my head and stepped out of the closet.
"Tony will be there," she smirked.
"Duh," he stated.
"Damn right," he smirked, kissing me, hard. I grunted and my arms wrapped around his neck as his hands settled on my waist. I kissing him back just as hard and smirked when I heard him moan, lightly. His hips grinded slightly into mine and I could feel myself growing harder. I moaned, lightly as his hips grinded harder, forcing mine further into the wall. He smirked into the kiss, one of his hands sliding backwards to squeeze my butt.
"Oh, my god, I am so sorry, Steve, I shouldn't have- AH!" I cut him off and took him all the way back down again, relaxing my throat so I didn't choke.
"It's just, knowing Mr. Innocent isn't a virgin," he smirked.
"I'll see you tonight, then," I said, walking out of the cafeteria to my motorcycle. I drove home and changed out of my school clothes, which were about as dorky as they could be; a white button down with a sweater vest, and khakis. Someone knocked on the door. I walked down, in a white undershirt and my khakis.
"Tony," I whispered.
"Really?" I demanded.
"I chose you, Steve, because there is no one better than you in this universe. I chose you because you're a science experiment, because you are the best, the only one on this stinkin' planet that want, that I need. Stevie, I chose you, because of who you are now, not because of who you were before the serum, not because of who you were before you went into the ice. I chose a smart, caring, bright eyed, lovable, insecure, adorable, childish, Captain. I chose you for everything you are, experiment or not. Don't you ever forget that, Steven Rogers," he said, both hands cupping my cheeks. He leaned in and pressed his lips against mine. That kiss, was everything I had ever wanted. It was soft, passionate, but not heated; it was sweet and slow, and so full of love I could just explode. We had kissed before, of course, but they were nothing compared to this. There was no tongue involved, no clashing teeth, no open mouths, just connection at the lips, and it was nothing short of perfect. We both pulled away for air.
"Thanks for repairing my suit, Tony," I smiled at him.
"Shit, oh, fuck, Steve, pull, off, I'm gonna-" I pulled myself and he came on my face.
"How'd you get here?" I asked.
"Steve," Tony said.
"Me, too, Steve," he panted, still hitting that same spot.
"Damn you, Rogers," he stated.
"Well, then we don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with Steve," he said, taking a step so he was against me again.
"Hmm?" I hummed, looking into his chocolate brown eyes with new reassurance.
"Yes," I smirked, dropping down again.
"Alright," I sighed again and slid the boots on. She left to my bathroom with a red dress in her hand and changed. She came out in a short, sleeveless dress, that hardly covered her rear end, and red high heels.
"Thank you, Steve," he smiled, kissing me gently. We left the closet and Bucky gave me a knowing smirk before pulling out his phone.
"Can I show you, just how much I love you, Steve?" He muttered against my lips.
"Okay, now kiss me," I laughed as he rolled his eyes, playfully and leaned back down. He slowly but surely made his way down to my neck, and bit softly. I made a noise that sounded like a mix between a gasp and moan, an arched up.
"You're welcome, Sir," he said. Tony walked out of the area and carried me up to his room where we dried off and dressed, then fell asleep, cuddling each other.
"WHAT?" I demanded.
"Do you like being bitten?" He asked.
"Blame it on that damn mouth of yours. You know, you're kinkier than I thought you were," he smirked.
"Hey, Tony?" I muttered.
"How the fuck do you look so damn innocent when I'm literally fucking your mouth?" He panted. I just batted my eyes again and he came with a shout down my throat.
"No problem," he said, finishing a patch.
"Hmm. Well, nice to know you feel the same way," I smiled. He looked at me and smirked.
"Come on, Stevie, don't be a baby," he said, pulling back and grinning widely as he squeezed harder.
"T-tony, what are y-you doing?" I asked.
"Seriously?" I asked.
"Well, that was quick," I smirked, wiping my mouth.
"Oh, so we have to kiss to get through, I get it," I said, "No biggie." I pulled him to me and kissed his lips.
"Shoot," I breathed as he took me down further.
"Holy shit," I winced as he pulled out and he chuckled, breathlessly.
"You have no idea," I smirked. I kissed him again and pulled away.
"There it is," he smirked, leaning down to kiss me. He repeatedly hit that spot, and I could feel the familiar coil of heat building my stomach.
"Tony never-" Tony stomped on her heel-clad foot.
"You never have to ask to do that," he smirked. I put my mouth on his ear.
"Well, it was damn good," he smirked. "Now, it's your turn." He pushed me backwards and kneeled over me, taking me into his mouth as soon as he had my pants down.
"Yeah. It's just... been a while," I whispered.
"Seriously?" He asked.
"You're welcome," he smiled as we went upstairs.
"New clothes," she stated, "go try this stuff on."
"Hey, I want you to meet my friends, this is Pepper Potts, and Edwin Jarvis, we just call him Jarvis, though," he smiled, introducing them. I smiled and shook their hands.
"I'm not sure going to a party is wise, Maria," I said, quietly.
"We know who you are," Jarvis smirked.
"Because, I wanted to see your reaction to having to fuck in the laboratory," he smirked, "and I have to say, it was quite entertaining."
"Is that what this thing was installed for?" I asked, pulling at the curtain.
"Fuck," he hissed. I grunted as he pulled out and slowly pushed back in. After three minutes of that same, horribly slow rhythm, I started grinding back on him to hurry him up. He picked up his pace, steadily thrusting into me. I moaned out as he slammed into the right spot. He continually hit it and put more force behind his thrusts, making me brace myself against the side.
"S-someone would SEE us," I gasped when his hands slid to my butt.
"Heya, Stevie," he smirked, sitting down, his legs dangling in the water.
"Let go, Steve," he said, nipping at the inside of my thigh, while simultaneously jerking me off.
"Wait here," he smirked. I rolled my ass and waited, feeling bits of cum drip from my ass.
"I'm close, Tony," I moaned.
"God, that couldn't have been your first blowjob," he stated.
"Your choice," he whispered. He grabbed my hips and forcefully spun me around, slamming my front down on the table. I moaned as his length pressed against my jeans-covered ass.
"Yeah," I sighed, rubbing the back of neck, nervously.
"Steve Rogers," I smiled.
"Well, I will be happy with whatever you are willing to offer," he smiled.
"Hi," I said, shyly.
"Bucky dropped me off," she smiled.
"That would be me," Lok said from behind us.
"Yeah," I blushed, getting up and redoing my pants.
"I'm not letting you walk in those things, get on," I said. She rolled her eyes, playfully, and got on the motorcycle behind me. I handed her a helmet and put mine on before driving to Maria's house. I heard the place before I saw it.
"Look up!" He laughed. I looked up to see mistletoe.
"I want to show you just how much you mean to me," he stated. He pushed our mouths together once more and I melted into it. His tongue slid along my lower lip, asking for entrance, which was, of course, immediately granted as I opened my mouth and his tongue slid inside. His tongue explored my mouth as his hands did the same to my body. They traced over my pecs, down to my abs and he traced every part of my six-pack with his fingertip and I shuddered.
"Can the Arc Reactor get wet?" I asked.
"I see you guys have been let out," Loki smirked. He saw me walking with a slight limp and laughed.
"You know you love, me. Now let's go," he smiled, taking me out.
"Steve," he sang.
"Hey, Tony?" I asked.
"Steve, is this your first...?" He started. I looked up and nodded. He pulled me off my knees.
" 'We'll'?" I asked.
"Holy shit! Tony! Tony! I'm- oh fuck-!" I yelled as I came untouched on my stomach. Tony wasn't too long after, pulling out and cumming on my stomach, as well. He stood up and went to the bathroom, coming back with a washcloth. He cleaned me up and threw the cloth in the hamper, then flopped on the bed next to me. He slung an arm around my shoulders.
"No," Tony answered, "When I have to make repairs on the suit when it's on me, I can put myself in some very compromising positions."
"Mr Stark, it's all my fault!" Gwen said before Tony could get a single word out. "I just let him go, and—"
He was nothing short of perfection.
, which means that—"
Peter thought.
After starting the dishwasher and making a huge pot of hot chocolate, complete with marshmallows, Peter and Gwen gathered up a bunch of blankets and headed up onto the roof of the main building. They set up their makeshift camp in front of the telescope, with Gwen sitting between Peter's legs, leaning against his chest. Taking turns with their stargazing, they were able to identify Venus and several constellations, taking plenty of notes in their notebooks for their Decathlon finals coming up in a couple of months.
And while Steve knew he couldn't take credit for any of it, he was still very grateful nonetheless.
"Sam," Steve finally forced past the knot in his throat. He felt so sickened that he probably would've vomited had he had anything in his stomach. Bucky had wanted to be a pilot his entire life, ever since Steve had known him, and the thought of him losing one of his limbs, of never being able to fly ever again, it was—it was—
“Yeah?  So?” Tony said, ignoring Obie’s whiny tone.  “It’s not like we need any more of ‘em at the moment.  JARVIS told me we’ve got over eighteen thousand units just sitting up there in the warehouse!”
Tony didn't know if it was the pain from Steve's healing nose or the fact that he hadn't slept for over three days, but he was out cold only about three minutes after Peter, his breathing a bit ragged but otherwise steady and even. Tony, however, remained wide awake, his mind running through various calculations and permutations as he tried to make sense of everything that had happened since they had dropped Peter off at that party.
Steve winced.  “Well, if that’s the case, at least she didn't,” he said.  “‘Cause as much as I hate to admit it, there have been a few who’ve looked right past the ring and asked me anyway.”
"Well—
And hopefully only the first of many more to come.
"Apparently not this time," said Auntie Nat. "We didn't get all the details 'cause we had to leave, but Thor mentioned something about an older sister than he'd never met, the goddess of death, apparently, who'd been imprisoned or something."
"Yeah," Peter said as he hopped off, quickly backing away. "Yeah, don't think I'll be doing
"We're ready," he said as Tony and Sharon climbed into the front. He curled his arm around Peter's shoulders, a knot rising in his throat at how bony they were.
With a quick glance over at Tony, Steve nods.  “Take ‘em out.”
Nodding at Dr Strange, Steve watched in awed trepidation as the doctor held out his arms, spinning his right in a circular motion as another of the glowing golden circles appeared. Steve quickly stepped forward, holding out his hand towards his obviously shocked husband, who was standing in the middle of their kitchen.
That soft blue light was Tony's heart, and as such, it was up to Steve to nurture and cherish it.
"Tony," Tony said. "Please, ma'am, if you don't mind, call me Tony." He had never been comfortable with being addressed as Mr Stark. All it did was remind him of Howard.
Peter shrugged. "Yeah, but Papa is too. You know none of us sleep well when you're gone."
"I never say things just to be nice, Peter," she stated. "Sleep now. I'll come and check on you in an hour, all right?"
"Yeah, I do," Steve cut in, swearing as he swerved to avoid another missile, one that looked remarkably similar to the missiles he usually carried. "Soon as we go through all this is gonna stop. JARVIS?"
As Steve had hoped, it didn't take much convincing on his part to get the rest of the team on board with his plan. It was both flattering and humbling to see the acceptance in the eyes of his teammates as Steve spoke, their unconditional trust that this was actually going to work.
Just like Dad, Uncle Bucky was now afraid of the dark.
Gulping, Steve shook his head. "No, I can't say that I'm opposed to having your hands running all over me. But—"
"Want you to fuck me, baby," Tony whispered as Steve kissed down Tony's jaw to his neck, sucking a mark into his pulse point. "Want you so bad. It's been way too long."
“Checkmate,” he said as he offered Steve his hand over the board.  “Good game, sir.”
"Well, yeah, I know that," said Peter. "But he definitely seems to hate Thanos, so—"
Which, if what he'd figured out a few minutes ago was correct, was actually impossible. He just hadn't worked up the courage to tell Dad yet.
"Gotcha," Uncle Sam said, nodding once at Uncle James before they both took off from the plain, peeling away in opposite directions. Looping around in a huge infinity symbol, Peter's heart skipped when they crossed in the middle almost directly above Thanos before flying back towards the Avengers' line. Then they paused, hovering in the air.
"You're not crazy, Uncle Bucky," Peter insisted. "You're fun."
"Tony,
"What the fuck is wrong with you goddamn people?" Dad screamed, sending Peter scrambling to curl into a ball, his hands clamped so tightly over his ears he was afraid he was going to push them into his skull.
Hammer's eyes went wide behind his thousand-dollar glasses, and he smiled, a sadistic smile that caused Tony's blood to crystallise into ice in his veins.
"I know," he whispered. "I know you are."
"Right," said Tony. "And Hank was brilliant, but he wasn't at Howard's level, and he's not at mine or Pete's either. So when the weapon was deployed it ended up being a lot more destructive than he'd originally calculated. And because of that he ended up killing not only about a hundred times more people than the military leaders had deemed acceptable, he also ended up killing his own wife."
How can we just stand here and
With a soft groan Tony pulled off his glasses, rubbing at his stinging eyes. He had just finished—or as finished as he could be before Peter had a chance to look everything over—the final design for the tesseract containment vessel, one that required slightly more vibranium than he had called for in his original calculations but would then compensate by boosting the energy output by at least another seventy-five percent.
"Speaking of Ms Potts, sir," JARVIS cut in. "She is indeed on the line."
Peter was so exhausted and drained once they pulled into the Tower parking garage that he didn't even try to argue when Papa lifted him out of the backseat like a baby and carried him the whole way up to the penthouse, with Peter resting his head against Papa's chest so he could hear his heartbeat. The pain was still intense but at least his stomach seemed to be okay, although at the moment Peter couldn't imagine ever being hungry again.
"Steve!" Tony shouted as he ran towards the aircraft, catching sight of his beloved just as the canopy popped open. Steve looked like he'd been to hell and back, with his pale cheeks all flushed and covered with stubble and partially-frozen sweat, but to Tony he was absolutely beautiful.
," Tony murmured as his belly gave a violent swoop. It had honestly never occurred to him before that moment, but now that he was seeing it, it all made perfect sense.
"I will," Steve said with a nod. He attempted a smile, one that Tony eagerly returned before pecking his lips in another kiss.
—to how to sew—"
He checked his timepiece again. 2058.
Until he did.  And as it stands, Tony’s had absolutely no contact with either Howard or Obadiah since that day.
"M-Mr Stark," he said. "I'm—I'm glad you're okay."
"And you, Tony," Steve said. He placed his hand on Tony's leg, gently squeezing. "Sometimes I think you forget that you were once a kid like Peter." He held up his hand, halting Tony's retort before he could even retort it. "But I agree with you. And once the mission's over, they won't. We'll make sure of it."
"Yes, sir," answered JARVIS. "All Tower drones are currently operating in their usual stand-by capacity."
"No thanks, JARVIS. Goodnight."
"Yes. Her name was Hela," said Papa. Finished with his dough, he handed Peter a block of mozzarella cheese, taking the cheddar for himself. "And she caused the deaths of a lot of people and managed to destroy Thor's hammer before Thor and Loki were able to stop her."
“Tony,” Steve whispered as he cupped Tony’s cheek, tilting his head up to capture his lips.  He didn't waste any time keeping the kiss chaste, running his tongue across Tony’s bottom lip and whimpering as Tony allowed him inside.  Before Tony, Steve had never been a huge fan of kissing, finding it little more than a small stepping stone to the real event.  But with Tony, Steve had discovered that it hadn’t been the kissing itself that he hadn’t enjoyed, it was just that he hadn't ever kissed someone that he loved.
Comments give me life!  I can’t wait to hear what you think of the chapter!  💕
“Nah, it’s okay,” Tony says dismissively, but not before Steve sees a flash of self-loathing flare across Tony’s face.  One that he’s seen far too often for his liking.
he thought as he scanned the vast plain, grinning as he watched Hulk leap from a pile of twisted debris and land right on top of at least ten of the ugly warg-like things. Behind him, sparking portals still hovered in the air as more and more people poured onto the battlefield. Many were Asgardians, based on the insignias on their medieval-like uniforms and Uncle Thor's friend Valkyrie, who was leading them, while others seemed to be wizards like Dr Strange, dressed in monk-like robes and holding their magical bright golden shields clutched in their hands as they formed a line behind them. A line that was quickly joined by about a hundred of King T'Challa's Wakandan warriors.
Which, Tony realised a few heartbeats later, he definitely wasn’t.
Tony flinched as the pencil in his hands snapped right in half, fighting against the tears threatening to reemerge.
"Not too bad this morning," she said once she was finished. "You're a bit damp, but nothing I wouldn't expect given your history."
"And you might wanna clean up your face a bit too," Tony added with a concerned frown. "You look like you got clawed by something."
After making sure that Peter ate a few more bites of popcorn, Tony shuffled across the apartment into his lab, face-planting onto the couch as soon as he crossed the threshold.  The tears started only a couple of heartbeats later, spilling down his cheeks almost before he realised they were there.
"Come on in, Peter," Pepper called through the door, her secretary having already announced that he was on his way.
going to tell me.  Is that it?”
"Yeah, I know it," Tony agreed. "I told you he pretty much saved my life."
“Steve?” Natasha asks, startling Steve from his thoughts.  “Did something happen yesterday?”
"Seemed like forever, but it was probably about three or four minutes." He started to lift Steve into the water, halting when Steve cried out in pain and fear as soon as it splashed against him. "Is it supposed to hurt him?"
Gripping the bike’s handles, Steve watches as Clint gracefully climbs up one of the tall trees about twenty or so metres from the northwest perimeter bunker, situating himself on a thick branch.  Then he reaches into his sheath and pulls out three arrows, notching them into his bow.
"Um, excuse me, Mr Wizard, but where the hell do you think you're going?" Tony demanded as he took off after him.
Peter grasped one of his center pawns, moving it forward two spaces. "Yeah, why?"
he begged. "I love you, don't let them do this to us!"
"Think the fever just broke again," he said as Steve set the tray down across Tony's lap, sitting down next to him. "So you're just in time."
Slowly, Peter nodded, his disheveled curls flopping over his forehead.
And it wasn't that Peter thought Ned actually believed most of that stuff his mom liked to gossip about, it was just… things were already weird enough. All the stuff Dad and Papa had told him about, the year he was missing and what they did to bring him and the others back, was literally straight out of a science fiction novel, and Peter highly doubted that Mrs Leeds' book club ever read anything that even came close to science fiction.
Tony frowned.  “Mmm.  I wonder how many more of my employees had that same feeling, hmm?”
What Tony was preparing to do by stepping inside that store would literally change everything.  Change his life, change his son’s life, and change his entire company.
"Yeah," Steve said, his own smile equally forced. "You've got three minutes, okay? After that, no matter what, we're pulling you out."
“Very good, sir,” answered JARVIS.  “And, I have just received word that the replacement medical supplies have been successfully delivered to the Foundation in Sokovia, all locks intact.”
Steve huffed, giving a reluctant nod. He really had no right to be begging Tony anything regarding Peter. As much as he loved Peter, Tony still knew him far better than he did, and Steve needed to trust his judgment.
"Yes, well, I'd agree that it's a fairly accurate description," O'Brien said. "One that I know I'll never forget, as I'm sure your mother won't as well."
They had all night, after all.
his flight through the portal.
"Thank you, Your Highness," Steve said. He offered the prince his hand, which T'Challa shook with a firm grip. "On behalf of all the Avengers, please allow me to offer my sincere condolences on the loss of your father."
“Uh huh.  Be right out.”
Tony Stark?” Sam asked.  “As in—?”
"JARVIS, please mute," Steve said with a sigh as the raucous applause broke out in the Los Angeles auditorium where the newly-elected president was giving his victory speech. Steve pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to ease the tension headache he had been nursing for most of the day. It was inevitable, he supposed, given how badly the incumbent president had been faring lately in the polls, but Steve supposed that his old, optimistic self hadn't wanted to admit the possibility that he really could lose the election, until he had.
"Yes, sir," replied JARVIS as a target symbol appeared on Tony's HUD, highlighting a spot about two-thirds of the way across. "I am reading an electromagnetic spike at this location."
“Mmm, I’m afraid I’m gonna have to overrule you on that one, bud,” Tony said.  “The doc said you need to make sure to eat with those painkillers that you’re on, so… how ‘bout I make you some popcorn, yeah?  You can just nibble on that while you watch a movie.”
"That's probably 'cause you won't need to start shaving till you're thirty," Flash Thompson said as he came up behind Peter, slapping him hard on his backside. "Little baby-faced Prince Peter probably doesn't even know how to grow facial hair yet."
Another thud sounded from the bedroom, this time followed by a gleeful, "Woohoo! Did you
"Bruce!" Steve yelped, ducking to avoid a war dog that launched for his neck only to be hit from behind by another, slamming him against a jagged boulder so hard that it knocked all the air from his lungs. Panic instantly welled up inside Steve, as it always did whenever he couldn't breathe, and for a moment he was completely frozen, unable to even raise his shield as at least five of the war dogs jumped on top of him, biting and tearing their way through his uniform.
"JARVIS, run another pre-flight check for me again, yeah?" Tony asked, nervously adjusting his headset for the umpteenth time.
"You've got me, honey," Tony murmured. He quickly kicked off his own shoes before fumbling with the buttons on Steve's uniform jacket, launching somewhere in the general direction of the chair. "Want you naked, babe. Like right the hell
look that Peter had seen way too many times during their Decathlon trips, usually as the result of him misplacing something really important.
And if that was the case, then Peter didn't think he wanted to know what she'd been forced to make Papa see, not to mention the fact that Papa thought he was fighting against Dad when Peter first got there. No wonder Papa had told him that he didn't know what was real anymore.
"Tony?" Steve asked, concerned. "Are you okay?"
" he purred, sliding his palm rather provocatively up Steve's thigh. "Are you trying to proposition me?"
Obie’s face was so red by that point it was almost purple, his index finger shaking as he pointed it directly in Tony’s face.
"Hell no, he couldn't!" snapped Peter. "But even without Captain America, Papa would still be a good person. Captain America isn't only who he is, just like Iron Man's not only who Dad is, and I really wish the news people could remember that! My dads are real people, just like they are."
"Tony, I got it," Steve replied. He tapped his compass, holding his breath as his nanite helmet closed over his head. "I'm ready."
“Thanks,” Bucky says.  “You too.”
Peter gave his head a hard shake. "Um,
"That's probably most of it, little guy," said Steve. He'd seen enough of how the government worked—especially in the aftermath of the Battle of New York—to know that he didn't approve of most of it.
Quill barked out a laugh as he stepped up next to Gamora. "Oh yeah, that's a good one. 'Cause it's completely right. There's not a single ounce of feeling inside this massive, ugly-as-hell body of yours, is there? Or at least not for anything besides genocidal mania!"
Not exactly someone who’s usually looking at colleges yet.
"Phoenix Three, standing by," said Carol, her voice alight with barely-contained excitement. Out of the corner of his eyes Tony saw Rhodey smile, his pride momentarily overcoming his own nervousness.
Tony sighed.  He’d been afraid of this.  “Pete, I’m not sure that’s such a good idea—”
Steve's eyebrows knitted together into what he probably hoped was a fierce glare, but his red-rimmed eyes and the tear track winding through the grime on his face lessened the effect, causing him to look almost pathetic.
"Ahh, can you please make sure that my dads' bedroom is soundproofed? Like, right now?"
"It was fine, Uncle Sam," Peter said, shooting him a look in the rearview mirror. Uncle Sam had promised Peter that he and Uncle Bucky wouldn't go overboard on the teasing during the drive up, but since Peter had neglected to properly negotiate the terms of that promise, or even get it in writing, he had a bad feeling that it was going to be open to far more interpretation than he would have chosen.
"Captain!" the grounds person cried as he attempted to slide the ladder over to Steve's aircraft, which Steve ignored as he jumped down to the floor. The hard cement rattled every bone in his tense body as he looked out towards the runway, barely able to make out Bucky's burning aircraft as it approached, listing badly to the left. He couldn't seem to get his eyes to work right. Everything was blurry, and there were funny-looking circles hovering around objects that were messing with his centre of gravity.
“Gee, thanks,” Tony muttered.  He didn't particularly enjoy being reminded of how old he was, preferring to remain in his self-induced semi-ignorant bliss, even as he was forced to watch as his beloved little boy grew taller and taller.
"Please, sweetheart," Steve pleaded as he gripped Tony's elbows. "Can't we please just go back to bed?"
Tony thought, clearing his throat. "Thank you, Mr Beck. Go ahead and proceed with your presentation."
their universe. And the thought that they might now lose him was—
"What the… Steve, are you okay—?"
“Mmm,” muttered Dad, his eyes still glued to his tablet.  “Got too caught up in your amazing find, huh, bud?”
Setting his phone down onto his desk, Tony stared at it for at least three minutes before he felt like moving again.  It really was amazing, for lack of a better word, how he had only met Steve not even three months ago, and yet he somehow seemed to know and understand Tony better than someone who had known him his entire life.
and landed smack down in the middle of
"Let's get you in the tub, bud," Tony said. "The eau de teenage boy you're emanating is a bit strong at the moment."
"On it!" Rhodey replied in a boom of afterburners, flying past Tony while launching his own grenades. One of them happened to explode right next to the suit's leg, knocking it off-course just enough for Tony to re-aim his laser below the thing's neck, knocking out the critical power relay as he breathed out a huge sigh of relief.
that followed was probably the loudest Tony had ever heard, causing the entire hangar to shimmy as Steve's excited voice came over the comm.
And then, in spite of having a giant axe embedded in his chest, Thanos raised his gauntlet-covered left hand, embossed with all six of the glowing Infinity Stones, and snapped his fingers.
"Well, it's more like Phillips asked me a few rather pointed questions that I answered, but yeah." A rueful smile quirked the corners of Steve's lips. "I've been told that it's pretty much impossible for me to hide what I'm feeling, so… it didn't take him long to figure it out. My entire team knows too, my friend Bucky told me."
"No, I know you weren't," Steve said, sounding just a bit more awake. "But I wasn't kidding about tonight either."
"I love you, sweetheart," he whispered into Tony's neck. "And I'm sorry."
And it wasn't that Tony didn't trust JARVIS's calculations. He was only trying to be extra careful. An out-of-control Hulk may not be quite as big of a threat as an invasion from space, but it still ranked up there near the top of things that Tony really didn't want to have to deal with. So if his caution just happened to tip the slightest way into paranoia, well, since he was currently the only person in the penthouse, then at least there were no witnesses present who could call him out on it.
"1938, Buck," Steve said fondly. He could remember that incredible baseball game like it was yesterday. "It was the Dodgers against the Giants. And against all odds, the Dodgers won."
"Uh huh. Thanks."
Obie’s eyes briefly narrowed before he threw his head back and laughed, clapping his hand on Tony’s shoulder so hard that Tony grunted.  “Ahh, that’s a good one, Tony!  You had me there for a second or two!”
"I mean exactly what you think I mean, corpsman—"
"Right." Gulping down the rest of his coffee, Tony picked up his pencil and proceeded to trace a series of straight lines that cut directly across his drawing. Once he was done, he showed it to Bruce, impatiently tapping his fingers on his knees as Bruce studied it.
"It looks like Pete wrote a code that links a communications chip directly into Clint's hearing aides," said Tony. "It'd be pretty much untraceable since it doesn't use normal communications frequencies and Clint would be the only one receiving it."
. So—"
“But—!”  Papa broke off as his eyes flicked first to the image, then over to Dad.  “But… sweetheart, this is—this is when I told them I was leaving, that I was gonna come to New York and open my store.  When I told them that I never wanted to see or hear from them again.  And—if I change that, then what happens?  If I hadn’t come here and opened my store where I did, then I wouldn’t’ve met Peter, or you, and—”
"Yeah, yeah, I know what I used to say." Dad paused, sucking in a deep breath. "Look, buddy, you know I like to sound off a bit when I'm upset, but—"
"With the armour's current configuration, I would estimate an opposing force of up to fifty million Newtons, sir," answered JARVIS.
"Pardon me, sir," JARVIS said. "But Agents Romanoff and Barton are requesting access to your laboratory in the penthouse. For research purposes."
"Love you too, Dad. Bye."
“Uh huh.”  Hurrying into the stall, Peter strips off his clothes and pulls on his swimming trunks, grateful that they still fit since they’re his same pair from last summer.  Then he tears his brand-new goggles from their packaging and grabs his towel, draping it across his shoulders as he comes out.
"But you saved us first," Tony croaked. He wound his arm around Steve's neck, pulling him down for a sloppy kiss that was all teeth and tongues and panting breaths. "You just appeared out of nowhere in the middle of the desert. I couldn't believe you were even real."
"Now wait just a minute," said Clint. "So you're telling me this is just another one of your Asgardian bedtime stories?"
"A guest?" Steve said as he glanced back at Natasha, who simply shrugged. "JARVIS, show us who it is, please."
"Just follow the coordinates, Sam, please," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "We'll be okay."
“Tony—”
"Yeah, yeah, okay," muttered Bruce.
"That is quite likely," agreed Thor. "But I still maintain that it should be me. I am the least likely to perish in the attempt."
"Your lady friend?" Steve prompted.
Dad instantly smiled. "Ah, he's good, bud," he said. "He's… it's kinda funny, you know? I mean the guy looks like the epitome of every single Air Corps stereotype that exists and then some, but in reality he's nothing like any of 'em. And the fact that he's drop-dead gorgeous doesn't hurt at all."
“It’s unlikely that he’s been moved from the general area,” Fury said.  “My undercover agent hasn’t seen anything that would indicate a prisoner transfer, and—”
Tony’s jaw drops open, gaping at Steve like he’s just grown a second head.  “Um… maybe trying to get us out of here?  Or is that not something you'd be interested in?”
"I love you so much," he murmured into Tony's hair. "And thank you. I needed that."
🔥 = this was so hot/ sweet!
it when Steve was frantic with him.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Steve had asked, trying to keep his temper intact through the haze of his own pain and fatigue. "Tony, you know you can't always be forgetting to take care of yourself!"
"You're sure?" Steve asked, his lips brushing against Tony's with every word. "It's been awhile."
"That's a huge relief, Carol, thank you," Steve said. He glanced down at Tony, his brown eyes pleading with Steve behind his glasses. "Ahh, do you think it would be okay if we—if Tony and I could—?"
As soon as the elevator doors closed Tony brought Steve's hand to his lips, kissing his knuckles. "Why don't you go and get changed, babe," he said. "If we're gonna be here for awhile, then… you're gonna want to be more comfortable."
—without Dad noticing.  No possible way.
Steve’s life, one that he had tried so hard to mould to his own perfect standards and had then failed so miserably, was finally starting to fall into place.  He was in love with the most beautiful man in the world, he had his very own bookstore, something he’d dreamt about ever since he was a scrawny kid growing up in Brooklyn, and the sweetest boy who had ever been born was now calling him, “Papa”.
Suddenly a panicked shriek of "
Steve thought as he felt himself slipping into unconsciousness.
"Goddamnit, Thor, I want a beer!" Uncle Clint called from the back of the line as Uncle Thor stooped down to smile with yet another one of his "adoring fans," a little boy who looked to be about six or so. "Can't you do all this some other damn time?"
"Well… yeah!" Phillips retorted. "How else do you think the enemy could keep up with us? We've always had the better tech, which also means we've always had the better people designing that tech—"
"There," Papa said as he stepped back. He blinked, his blue eyes shiny as he placed his hands on Peter's shoulders. "You look so much like your dad, little guy. Almost too handsome for words."
And then there'd been Obadiah Stane, the man who'd tried for years to mould Tony into the perfect Iron Monger war profiteer, and then arranged to have him and Peter kidnapped by the Ten Rings after Tony tried to push back. Steve still couldn't even think of the man's name without white-hot rage flooding his body, along with a hefty dose of fear at how close he had come to losing his husband and son forever.
”Oh, yeah!” Peter says emphatically.  “I watched all of ‘em!”  He starts to add that he’s sorry Mr Rogers lost in his last race, but then decides against it.
"Oh, sure," Gwen answered as her mother stepped over to the foot of the stairs, cupping her hands around her mouth.
“Ehh, not necessarily,” answers Steve.  “Just because I used to be a swimmer doesn’t mean I know how to coach.  I’ve met tons of swimmers who would make really lousy coaches, and a lot of really good coaches who never made it anywhere beyond their high school teams.”
he thought as he drifted off, not knowing if he would wake up again.
“Mmm,” Tony murmurs.  “I’ll think about it.”
"There's no way Liz's parents would let her have a party without them there," Peter said. "They're almost as strict as you guys."
"Of course it's not," she agreed. "So that's why I'm here. No child wants to be cooped up all by himself, and especially not one who would much rather be outside, right? I believe Steven told me that you're a master tree climber. Am I right?"
Even after Tony's appeal for his heart surgery was denied for the third time, Peter still held out hope. And while Tony had no idea how in the hell he did it, he knew it was also the very reason why he had to continue fighting for him. Peter had the potential to literally change the world, and there was no one—
look so goddamn cute that Tony had to fight the strong urge to pull the car over. "I think first I'd like to take him fishing."
As to why the Langaran officials never made it a priority to look for this person remained a mystery, as did the tech that he allegedly stole.
"Looks like we're here, Стив," Bucky said softly as he gathered up his rifle and secondary sidearms. "You ready?"
"Copy that," Natasha said as she headed for the door. A moment or so later Gwen Stacy appeared, rumpled and dishevelled with her face lined in tear tracks and her left arm wrapped up in a padded sling. Steve stood to his feet as she stepped inside, followed by her father, his hand resting protectively on her uninjured shoulder.
"Steve, Rhodey and I are gonna show Carol around a bit first, maybe get her something to eat," Natasha murmured as James led her out of the room and Bruce rushed off to yet another overdue conference call. "It shouldn't take too long."
about three heartbeats later.
"Mmm. Well, I sure hope whoever it is is smarter than the last civvy we had. Remember that guy who they had a couple years ago? The dude who didn't know his own head from his ass?"
"That was kind of the point, sweetheart," Steve said, with a downright mischievous wink. "JARVIS, is Peter still awake?"
"Peter, what're you doing?" Gwen hissed as he pulled up the sleeves of his hoodie, activating his web shooters. "We're supposed to be meeting my dad at the museum!"
"Is Dad okay?" Peter asked as they scrubbed the vent clean of egg yolk. "JARVIS said he was sick, and that I couldn't go in to see him, but—"
"What?" Peter said, grimacing in surprise. "But that doesn't make any sense? JARVIS wouldn't just disappear unless one of us told him to, so—"
"General," said Steve.
Mr Stacy's eyes narrowed as he held eye contact with Peter, almost daring him to look away. "A private organisation," he finally said. "With no oversight."
Tony hadn't thought it was possible for Obie’s face to go any greyer, but somehow it managed.
"And why was that, sir?" Steve asked. He was only barely clinging to his temper, and the fact that his stomach was now almost continuously growling wasn't helping.
Steve immediately laughed, an honest-to-goodness, true belly laugh, realising about a split-second later that he could not honestly remember the last time he had done so.
Which it didn't. So far, things seemed to be going according to plan.
"Yeah, yeah, not likely," Tony mumbled, his mind already branching out into several different directions. "Remind me again how many parameters we've set up for target identification?"
Too dazed to think of another excuse, Tony obliged, rolling onto his stomach with his arms at his sides. He let out a soft moan as Steve reached for the bottle of massage oil, pouring a generous amount into his palm and rubbing his hands together.
Steve frowned, tapping his fingers on the back of Tony's hand. "That's another odd thing that I noticed in my research. I found a list of civilian scientists that had worked for the Air Corps over the years. Your name was on it, and Howard's, and a guy named Justin Hammer that—"
“Well, then consider this a reminder.”  Tony’s expression grew serious again, his fingers tightening on Steve’s arm.  “I know you’ve probably been told about a million times how brave you are, honey.  But doing something like this, confronting an actual war criminal about the shit he did to you and your team after everything you’ve been through, well… I’m pretty sure that takes the cake on it.”
It all made perfect sense now.
"Yep. But apparently they didn't pay nurses all that great back then, and so she had to work a whole lot just to keep them in their house," said Peter. "And pay for my papa's medicines whenever he got sick. That's one reason why my dad's always donating money and supplies to hospitals around the world. He always says that no one should ever have to go bankrupt just 'cause they get sick, or have a sick kid. He even helped to build a brand-new wing on a hospital in my grandma's hometown, not too far from where our house is in Ireland. And he even named it after her."
"It's okay, Steve," he said softly. "I'd rather be able to joke about it than just be wallowing in misery all the time, you know?"
Grabbing Steve's discarded t-shirt from the night before, Tony slipped it over his head before padding over to the tiny half-bathroom to pee and brush his teeth. Next to the sink sat a brand-new toothbrush and razor still in their respective packages, just as Steve had told him, and Tony couldn't help but smile as he helped himself to some of his man's toothpaste and shaving cream as he tried to make himself at least a little more presentable before Steve came back.
"Hmm. You look like someone cut the ends off your shoelaces," he said. "Something happen on your run?"
For a long time Uncle Bucky stood still as a rock, his face impassive. Finally, he gave a short nod.
"Peter," she said, the huge smile on her gorgeous face already making Peter weak in the knees. "Did you know that your dads have their very own ice cream flavours?"
“Only if you remember,” Peter said as Tony opened his arms for a goodbye hug.  “Are you gonna try and take a nap today?”
—and his precious son.  The family he’d never thought he would have, and now couldn't live without.
"Yeah, yeah, I get what you're saying, kiddo," said Uncle Bucky. He dropped his chin to his chest, shaking his head. "I guess I never realised that when they're sucking you in with all of their promises of riches and glory, they never once tell you that you're gonna have to sell your soul for it. I mean, I saw Stevie's ma. I saw how hard she had to work when my ma didn't, and I guess I just assumed that it was 'cause Steve was always so sick, so…"
Steve smiled. "Nah, I'm not too worried about them. I'm sure JARVIS'll keep 'em in line."
And when it was over, when the last of their combined cries of pleasure had bounced off the walls of the room and they had managed to drag themselves into the tiny bathroom to clean up, they lay back down on the bed, curling up together under the sheets with Tony's arm draped across Steve's waist and his chest pressed up against Steve's back. Most of the time it was the other way around, with Steve being the "big spoon", as Tony liked to call it. But on this night Tony just knew that it needed to be different, that it was Steve who needed to be held while they slept. That he needed to feel Tony pressed up against him, infusing him with the strength that he felt he was lacking.
Fury rolled his eye. "Yeah, thanks."
And when he was ready, and had flipped over onto his back, his eyes never left Tony’s face as Tony hiked his legs up and carefully pushed inside him, clamping down hard on his bottom lip so he didn't come too soon and ruin it.
I can’t believe we’re so close to the end!
Just like he’d been in the ice.
let Tony get him some help.
"Yeah."
He felt Steve's lips on the top of his head. "Yeah. I guess so."
"His heart rate and respiratory patterns were consistent as such, Captain," answered JARVIS. The UI paused then, as if he was weighing his next words. "However, Master Peter specifically requested that I not report it to either yourself or to Mr Stark."
"That was only one time, brother!" she said. "When are you ever going to let it go?" Then she turned to Peter, gesturing towards the far end of the banquet table. "Come with me and I'll tell you all about it."
Pocketing his phone, Peter zipped up his jacket and headed down the hallway, remembering to grab his sunglasses from his backpack just before he reached the doors.  It was bright outside, the first sunny day Manhattan had seen in what seemed like forever, and even though spring was still a few weeks away, at least with the sunshine it wasn’t quite as dreary.
“Say again, Steve?” Natasha asks after a heartbeat or so pause.  “Vanished?”
"Time to stand down now, soldier," Tony whispered. "The war can wait for a bit."
Bucky shrugged. "As far as I know she's on the widow's compensation fund since her husband was killed in action."
"We should at least explain all of this to Tony and Bruce, Steve," Natasha said firmly. "Let them decide if it's possible or not."
“If that is indeed the case, sir, then it is likely Pierce who ordered the abduction of Captain Rogers,” said JARVIS.
Or at least,
"Well, at least there's that," said Dad. He huffed out a sharp breath as he checked his reflection, turning to allow Uncle James to pin on his boutonnière. "Are ya ready, Pete?"
"No problem!" Peter said. He quickly slid a chair over next to the hologram, indicating for Bucky to sit down. Then he handed Bucky an extra pair of protective glasses and took Bucky's metal hand, bending his arm at the elbow to allow Tony to access the outside of it.
“You're not just some college girl working down in data entry, Tony!” Obie had shouted.  “You're Tony Stark, the goddamn CEO!  And you need to set an example!”
"Weird is a good word for it," agreed Grandma. "But from what I've seen, 'inconsistent' would probably be a better choice. And it's those very inconsistencies that have hurt more people than I care to count." She let out a heavy sigh, fingering the thin golden band circling the third finger of her left hand.
"Nah. If Phillips had a problem with it I'm sure he'd say something. He's never been known to keep things like that to himself before."
The very same face that currently belonged to the man who was just about to jump out of yet another plane into yet another disputed-borders country because of yet another conflict that Nick Fury had felt that SHIELD needed to stick its nose into.
Steve waved her off with a nod before sitting down at the workstation over in the far corner, hoping it would help prevent him from being interrupted. He didn't really feel like answering anyone's curious questions at the moment.
The fact that their engagement announcement and subsequent wedding plans served as the perfect distraction to those few people who still wondered if Dad should’ve been up there on that trial stand next to Obie was the proverbial icing on the cake.
"Copy that. Thank you, Colonel."
Uncle Bucky's eyebrows knitted together as he glared at Peter. "You heard us?" he asked, low and tight.
"Line is secure, sir."
"I don't think this is as connected to that programming as we originally thought, Captain, since both of the other times Peter went comatose he had sustained physical injuries as well," said Dr Cho. "But now, since we no longer have to worry about him having to fight against his own subconscious while he's healing, I'm hoping that means this episode will be shorter than the others."
Thanos sneered, his ugly purple nose only a few centimetres away from Peter's. "Your boy, huh?" he said as he raised the gauntlet towards the sky, triggering something that sounded like an avalanche of rocks thundering down onto the planet. "Let's see how he likes losing a child!"
They had to win this battle first, which, from the looks of it, was going to be the largest that Steve had ever fought.
"Yeah, yeah," Rhodey had muttered as he exited the locker room, still grumbling under his breath about the fact that he couldn't order Tony to take better care of himself since he wasn't officially under his command.
But the song ended all too soon, and Peter reluctantly released Gwen's waist, trailing his fingers down her arm to squeeze her hand. It was time.
"Hey!" protested Clint. "Now wait just a goddamn—!"
friends.”
"Sweetheart, please, talk to me?" Steve pleaded after they had sat in silence for at least five minutes. "'Cause it seems like these dreams of yours are just getting worse and worse, and—"
is wrong with you?"
A knot rises in Tony’s throat, one that he tries to swallow away.  How is it possible that this tiny, eighty-some-odd-year-old Italian lady can, with just a few choice words, slice right through all of his layers of proverbial armour and get at the very heart of Tony’s fears?
Tony watched as Peter exited the lab, returning a minute later with his backpack and a bottle of blue Powerade, his curls flopping down over his forehead as he settled in to do his trigonometry homework. Tony's throat tightened as he watched him for a moment out of the corner of his eye before returning to his own workstation. It never failed to amaze Tony how a kid could go through all the shit that Peter had gone through and still be able to retain some semblance of normality.
"Give us three hours to get set, then we'll head out," said Steve.
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter's brown eyes were twinkling as he smiled. "Yeah, I did. I'm calling him JARVIS."
"But we still had JARVIS randomise stuff for us," Peter added as his mask retracted, his sweat-dampened curls springing up in all directions. "Otherwise it wouldn't have been fair."
“I will once I know Steve’s okay,” Peter said as he slid from the car.  “Love you.”
"I can't, sweetheart," Steve finally whispered. "I can't—I can't relax, not now, not with everything, and I'll only keep you awake. You go ahead, you need the sleep more than I do."
"God,
of heavy metal footsteps that were perfectly in time with the beat of Steve's pounding heart. Steve's belly gave a hard swoop as the all-too-familiar sound of the Iron Man armour grew closer, struggling against the invisible force that pinned him in place.
Grandma blinked, her eyes narrowing just like Papa's did when he was puzzled. "And how'd you guess that, hmm?"
And why did hospitals always have to have so much white everywhere anyway? As an artist, Steve had always found the lack of colour disturbing, and not at all conducive to a person's recovery.
And so Tony sat, carefully clutching Steve's bruised left hand as Helen completed her examination, including blood tests and X-rays of pretty much every single bone in Steve's body. Bucky and Sam, accompanied by two of Happy's guards, had taken Peter to the hospital cafeteria to get something to eat and were then supposed to have him try and get some sleep, so Tony knew that he was in good hands.
"Would you have still volunteered for the procedure if I had?" he asked.
"Oh, are you now?" Steve asked, trying to look innocent. Tony was absolutely correct though, he did cut a very handsome figure in that undersuit of his. And in pretty much anything else that we wore as well.
"Dad?" Peter said, sounding surprised and more than a bit concerned. "Are you okay? You never call me this early?"
"Look at me, Tony," Steve said as he lined himself up and slowly pushed inside him. "Look at me while I take you."
"Mr Stark's current temperature is thirty-eight point two Celsius, his heart rate has decreased to one hundred and one, and his respiratory rate is twenty-one. All are still slightly elevated."
"Quill," Drax said a heartbeat later, just as shocked and frightened as Tony felt as he began to disintegrate, leaving nothing behind but a pile of blowing ashes in three seconds flat.
So tired of shivering all the time, so tired of being so weak, of the constant coughing and struggling to breathe, so tired of his blue lips and fingers and his pounding heart that was like a tire spinning in the mud, making a huge mess but going absolutely nowhere.
Steve thought, hoping against hope that he was actually right and not just dreaming it.
Peter chose to let that one slide. "Dad, we just spent weeks trying to figure out how these silly particles work on the off chance that they might turn out to be helpful whenever what you keep dreaming about is gonna happen, happens. And that's fine, you know it is. You know I love doing stuff like this with you, so it's fine. But what's not fine is this thing you've got going on where you feel like you have to carry all of this crap by yourself. This is exactly how you were after Loki and the Chitauri came, Dad, I remember it. You were obsessed with making your suits, and obsessed with protecting us, and—"
"Ah, a dance-off?" asked Tony, bracing himself for the answer.
As it was, Steve could now hardly look at Tony's arms, which were covered in bruises and bandages from the failed IV placement attempts, without breaking into tears. He at least wasn't completely paralysed, like he had been down in Miami for all those weeks, so he could occasionally respond to Steve's voice and squeeze his hand. But that didn't make it much easier for Steve to have to see him like this.
Tony was cut off as Steve added a third finger, his hands clutching the sheets in a white-knuckled grip as he writhed against Steve's hand. "Baby,
"All the time, little guy," Steve said fondly. "Cinnamon's actually good for a lot of things. It helps keep bugs away, it's good for upset stomachs, and it's great for opening up your airways."
"Yeah, you're absolutely right," he whispered. "Thanks."
"All right, go on and take your lovers' quarrel somewhere else, yeah?" Tony cut in. "You're starting to hurt my ears."

Only this time Steve’s cheeks and chin were covered with prickly blond stubble, his lips were swollen and cracked, and his body was covered with a thick layer of sweat and grime, which meant he had probably been lying there for the entire weekend.
"I've cleared you to work down in Dr Banner's old laboratory," Phillips said. "Believe me, no one's gonna wanna go in there after what happened to him."
"Dad?" Peter asked, more timid than Tony had heard in a long time. "What's happening?"
"What the fuck is wrong with you goddamn people!" Tony screamed, anguish hitting him the chest like a spear when Peter curled into a ball in his lap, his hands clasped tightly over his ears.
“Ah, yep,” Dad said.  “Hour and fifteen tops, all right?  You’ve got homework you can be working on, yeah?”
Apparently Christmas time was a popular time to purchase those types of books, as that was at least the third set he’d had to order in the last couple of weeks.
Yay, they finally got to meet!  And they both seem intrigued 😉.  We’ll get to hear from Steve again in the next chapter 😊.
” Dad said as the image began to dissolve.  Carefully, he removed the glasses from Papa’s face, handing them to Peter as he went to work on the leads, grasping Papa’s hand once he was done.  “You did it, honey!  You fucking did it!”
"Thor!" Steve practically squeaked as he finally scrambled up to his feet. But Thor paid him no attention as he began marching towards the two aliens still standing by the open force shield, picking up speed with each step as his companions took off after him.
"Um… morning Papa," Peter said, wincing. "I'm sorry, I kinda—well, I mean, I guess I just—"
"Yeah, okay," Sam said as he angled the jet slightly downward, ordering Clint to reset the flaps. "But if we end up crashing, I'm gonna insist that this doesn't count against my piloting record."
The only problem was, Steve was no longer convinced he could do this all day. Or even for another single second.
"I just brought you your tea," Steve whispered as he brought Tony's hand to his lips, kissing the back of it. "I'm sorry I woke you."
And then he turned on his heel and climbed into the car. Tony watched as it drove away, leaving him behind, his heart cracking in two and his mind spinning so fast that he felt lightheaded.
"Oh good freaking grief, Pete," grumbled Tony. "You just had to let Howard in there too, hmm?"
“No promises,” Steve says warily.  “But, um… how?  Why do you think that?”

"That sounds very peaceful," Natasha said softly.
"That's right, Papa," Peter piped up from his chair on Tony's opposite side, where he was covered in so many various layers and blankets that Tony could barely still see him. With Peter's unstable body temperature, he had to be extra careful whenever he was out in the cold, and was currently appropriately dressed for a climb up Mount Everest. Tony had imported his down parka from Siberia—he'd ended up purchasing six of them, given Peter's tendency to misplace things—under which Peter was wearing two of his Spider-Man suits with their own built-in heaters, and a separate heated undershirt as well.
Steve gave a nod just as there was a knock at the door, with Tony quickly swiping his tears away.
And then, as if they needed even more to worry about, his Spider Sense activated.
“I knew it!” he exclaims, so loudly that a woman at a nearby table turns to look at him.  “Oh, I just
Tony’s lips twitch, and he idly pats Peter’s back, who, after a pretty impressive freakout when they were first brought aboard the jet, proceeded to conk right out next to Tony on his gurney, his skinny arm tight across his father’s waist.  Like Thor said, the poor little guy was so worried while Steve and Tony were missing that he hardly slept, instead helping Bruce and JARVIS decipher the Tesseract data which allowed them to build the tether that Thor used to retrieve them.
"You are welcome," Papa said, with a rather conspiratorial grin. "Now, will you please try and get some sleep?"
To Tony’s shock, Obie actually looked chagrined.  “Okay, okay.  I’ll admit that was a little low, and I apologise.  It’s never polite to talk ill of the dead, and especially about Maria.”  He straightened his shoulders, setting down his glass.  “But I stand by my statement that the pharmaceutical division was only a drain on our resources, and as your Chief Financial Officer, it’s my job to make sure that Stark Industries does not tolerate any such thing.”
"Probably 'cause he knew you were with him," Peter said. He ducked his head, suddenly self-conscious. "It's always better when someone's there with you when you're sick. My dad… he tried, but… by the time I got real bad… He'd try so hard to make it home in time to sit with me for a bit before I went to sleep, or even eat dinner with me, but—but most of the time they just wouldn't let him. They just worked him so hard… and no one cared about what they were doing to him. It wasn't until he got put directly under Colonel Phillips's command that he was able to start getting home before curfew started, but even then it wasn't every day."
"Yeah, especially with the nasty type of pneumonia that he had," Sharon said with wide eyes. "Kids really are resilient, you know?"
Tony blinked, his brow furrowing just slightly. "Steve," he murmured. "You don't have to ask."
But Tony had no sooner tapped in his first command when his entire screen went blank, and an ominous, robotic voice came over the comm.
Steve shook his head, his eyes filling with tears as he fiddled with Tony's fingers in his lap. "Tony, it was—it was… oh God, it was
"Yeah, that sounds about right."
"Getting them to agree to let us use the tesseract," said Peter. "Yeah, I know. And that's what Grandpa said too."
"Yeah, maybe. You think it's still okay for him to go over to his friend's house like that?"
Steve huffed, his blue eyes filled with such intense self-loathing that Tony flinched as they locked with his. He
"Hey, little guy," Steve murmured as he got to his feet, holding his arms open for a hug that Peter stepped into without any hesitation. Steve closed his eyes as he buried his nose into his son's downy soft curls, tears pricking behind his closed eyelids.
"Steve—!" Tony exclaimed, but Steve was already there, approaching Peter as if he were a cornered wild animal.
The bob of Fury’s Adam’s apple as he swallowed was all the answer that Tony needed.

"Um… your father was a planet?" Peter asked. "How'd that work, exactly?"
"Well, that'll kinda depend on what he thinks of you when you do finally meet him," answered Peter. "But like I said, he usually trusts my judgement, so I think it'll be fine."
"As you wish, Captain."
"That'd be nice," Peter said softly. He buried his nose into the soft fur of his polar bear's neck, contemplating if he should ask about going to Gwen's house now or wait until his dads got home.
"Nah, don't thank me, I didn't do anything," Uncle James grumbled. "I do have to be getting back through. Colonel Phillips wants me there when he debriefs the backup patrollers. Captain, you're to call one of the safety officers when you and Tony are ready to head back to the base, got it? Colonel Phillips doesn't want you going anywhere unescorted while you're still healing."
“How’d what go?” Steve shoots back, chuckling when Natasha grins at him over the rim of her mug.
"Me either," Peter said as he let out a huge yawn. He had been stressing all day about Dad and Steve, wondering if Dad was gonna keep being a dummy about things or if he'd suck it up and make up with him, and now that Peter knew they were okay all he wanted was to go to sleep.
Rhodes let out a sigh as he and Tony wrapped their arms around Steve's waist. "Yeah, she and I both figured that, but… well, you know Carol. She's not gonna stay here on the ground if she thinks she can be useful up there."
"Which part?"
"Neh," Uncle Bucky said, sneering. "That may be true, but he still shouldn't be punished for what happened to me. It's not fair to him. He can still fly, can still advance in his career. I'd—I'd only be dragging him down."
"Tony!" Steve screamed, his throat raw from all the dust and debris and yelling after his husband and son. His heart was thudding so hard it felt like it was going to shatter as he scanned the sky, clutching his chest.
This time, he could only blame himself.
"Honey, just
“Good afternoon, Mr Stark,” he says as he shakes Dad’s hand, who seems to be just as awestruck as Peter—and maybe even a tiny bit more?  “And you must be Peter?”
"So, Grandpa came by again yesterday," Peter said. He braced himself for Dad's reaction, relieved when he saw Steve reach for Dad's hand. "He… well… he was—"
And if he’s slightly ahead of Schmidt, then that means…
Steve's frozen fingers were so tightly wrapped around Tony's gauntlets that he had managed to dent the metal. "S-stay with m-me!" he gasped. "P-please, d-don't l-leave me alone!"
Used to the abrupt halt as he arrived at the predetermined coordinates, and the brief breathlessness that followed.
"Oh, you know," Gwen said with a shrug. "It was school."
He was Captain America, and Captain America didn't run away from bullies. No matter how big and powerful they happened to be.
, DUM-E suddenly disappeared. Peter's eyes went wide as he dropped to his knees on the lab floor, using his magnifying glass to search for the bot he had loved since before he could talk. He was finally able to locate him right where he had been standing, now at about one-millionth of his previous size.
"But I still don't think Tony would want you to be worrying about it," Uncle Bucky said gently. "You're looking pretty wiped out, kiddo. I think you should only be worrying about yourself."
“No!” Steve said firmly, shaking the thought free before it had a chance to take root and flourish.  That whole line of thinking wasn’t even his to begin with, so he’d never subscribed to anyway.  He didn't need to worry about “channelling his feelings” onto something else because he could control them just fine on his own.
"Oh, you know him," Natasha said. "Still no word from Thor?"
Peter immediately clapped his hand over his mouth, his eyes scanning rapidly across Uncle Bucky's face, where about a hundred different emotions were crossing all at once. "Oh my God, Uncle Bucky, I'm so sorry! I just blurt out things without thinking sometimes, my Dad says I get it from him, and I just—!"
"Isn't that what you're always talking about, Dad?" asked Gwen. "Hello, Captain Rogers."
Uncle Bucky nodded. "Yep."
They lost thirteen baseballs during one of those pickup games last summer, a fact that Tony had greatly enjoyed reminding Steve of all the way up until Thanos invaded.
"Very good, sir."
"Tony?" Steve said as he took a step towards Tony, halting in his tracks when Tony immediately backed away. "Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
Davis smiled triumphantly, leaning back in his chair. "Well, Captain, in this case I believe it to be very relevant. You see, there is no other United States-based peacekeeping or law enforcement organisation that I am aware of that would allow a… couple such as yourselves to participate in such organisation together, especially if one of the members of said couple is in fact the other's superior. So I am wondering, Captain, how you are able to reconcile this?"
"Uh huh." He made a beeline for the massive bed, burrowing down under the covers in the very centre and closing his eyes. Colonel Phillips had been right when he'd said that the room would be big enough for the three of them, but Tony hadn't assumed that he'd meant that the actual bed was as well.
"Oh, shut up, Flash," Ned snapped before Peter could respond. "And what are you even doing here? Aren't you supposed to be spinning tunes?"
Being immobilised in ice and left to suffocate, it was one of Steve's absolute worst fears coming to life.
"Sorry, Dad, but I just—I just wanted to be here, and—"
"Ah, well, since we'll be moving in a parabolic orbit, breaking it too soon would mean the aircraft would be travelling through the atmosphere at too steep of an angle," replied Bucky. "Which means that the heat shield wouldn’t be aligned correctly."
"Uh, yeah," Peter said sheepishly. "I was gonna just go and make a sandwich or something, but—"

"Shh, honey," Tony murmured as he stroked Steve's hair, matted and covered with grime. "Pete's with Bucky and Sam. They're taking care of him so Helen and I can take care of you, okay?"
"Yeah," Peter said with a frown, not at all convincingly. "So I've heard."
Sam pursed his lips, glancing towards the ceiling and walls of the prison as he weighed all of the possibilities. The bunker they were trapped in was much larger than the bunker had been down in Miami and also much more wide open, which was actually a disadvantage for the Avengers since only three of the team members could fly.
"Yeah, it was," answered Steve. "If the real thing is anything like those simulations then we're gonna be in for a treat."
"I know," Peter said, sniffing. "It's just… I just feel—"
"Hey, what's that mean, that mo store thing that you've been calling me?"
A huge, massive thank-you to my wonderful betas, allthesinnersandthesaints and jehbeeeh.  This story would not be the same without them! 💗 💗
That at least was enough to make Steve chuckle. He had never, in all of his years with the Air Corps, ever been late to a briefing, and there wasn't a single person on their team who didn't know it.
Tony sighed as he stepped back, tugging off his shirt to start getting ready for bed. "Nothing other than he's the typical nerd. Graduated from Stanford with degrees in math and physics, works as a VP for some huge accounting firm that caters to a bunch of big-name actors and athletes, has a wife and two daughters that run in the LA social circles but there's gossip that he's secretly gay, that's about it."
"Yeah, I thought it was weird too, but Phillips has always been kind of a weird old bat anyway, so I guess I shouldn't be too shocked," said Dad. "It's not the strangest thing that he's ever done."
His lungs screaming for air, Tony raised his head, flipping onto his side as he scrubbed his palm across his soggy eyes.  He’d always known that despite his genius intellect, underneath it all he was just a complete idiot.  Peter had warned him that he needed to tell Obie about Steve.  Hell, even Rhodey had mentioned that he might want to say something before things got too serious.  But did Tony listen?  Did he listen to his sweet son who he knew had grown to love Steve like a second father?  Did he listen to his best friend in the entire world, the guy who’d been looking out for him since he was fifteen years old?
"Dad?"
(See the end of the chapter for
This time Steve allowed his frown to form in all of its glory.
“Yeah, probably,” answered Peter.  “It’s not like I can’t walk or something.  Don't think I’ll be able to help you in shop for a while though.”
"It's not getting worse!" Steve shouted, his heart lurching when Tony jumped. The absolute last thing he wanted was for Tony to be afraid of him. "Oh God, I'm so sorry, sweetheart, I didn't mean to yell like that… I just… can't we go to bed? Please? I need you, can't we just—"
, just—" Peter said, or rather, squeaked into Dad's chest. He knew she was just worried about him, but her voice was rapidly reaching dog whistle levels in pitch and his head already felt like it was splitting in two.
"Oh, I'm fine," Peter said automatically. "Same old, same old." He grabbed his notebook, tearing out the pages of new code. "I wrote these this afternoon while I was waiting for you guys. More layers of encryption for JARVIS."
"And that's all that matters," Tony mumbled.
If only he could somehow go back.  Somehow relive his senior year, when he became only the third Camp LeHigh swimmer to ever qualify for the Olympic Trials, and the first to actually make it to the Olympics.
“Jesus Christ,” muttered Fury.  “You really are one stubborn son of a bitch.”
"Yep. 'Bout damn time too." Tony glanced down at his chest, watching as the nanites began to flow back into their storage case. "I'll give it a real test run this weekend, yeah?"
"He's loony, Pete," Dad interrupted. "Simple as that. Even more messed up than HYDRA."
"That is the theory, sir," JARVIS said. "However, without a copy of the structure for reference, I cannot be certain."
Thor gulped, staring vacantly ahead. "I should've gone for the head."
As the announcer calls “Ready”, Tony’s surprised to see that Steve is bare-chested under his warm-up suit, along with the rest of the swimmers in the field.  Apparently the full-body swimsuits weren’t in style for this Olympics.
"Okay, then the same question still applies," Tony said. "Who the hell is building all this stuff for them? If it's not me and it's not Howard, then
"You're welcome," she answered. Then she shot him a smile, gathered up her books, and headed for the door.
And then losing Bucky, and being forced to grieve for him while still fighting the war, well… after that, Steve wasn't sure if he'd ever learn how to do it properly.
"No, Bucky, it wasn't me," Steve said with a laugh. "You know I'm not good enough at chess to beat Peter."
Which Steve was also trying to do, even though it was harder than hell. His serum-enhanced libido aside, Steve desired Tony as much now—even more so, actually—as he did when they first met, and the thought that maybe Tony didn't desire him back anymore… well…
"Copy that," said Dad. "And keep your eyes open. You'll probably be the first one to see Thanos when he gets here."
"Together," Steve echoed, nodding as he kissed him again. Then he wrapped his arms around Tony and rolled so he was on top of him, bracketing Tony's hips with his knees as Tony's long fingers curled around their cocks, stroking them together.
This chapter depicts a couple of pretty intense flashbacks.  Please be safe 💗
"Mmm." Steve supposed that Dr Strange was sworn to secrecy by some stonekeeper oath or something, but he had just about had enough of all of the so-called "rules" regarding the infinity stones.
"Not like I'm gonna turn down the opportunity to see you naked," Tony said with a wink, earning a weak half-smile from his husband as he got started on Steve's hair, saving his bruised and swollen face for last.
"Pete? What's wrong, something happen at school?"
It’s no use.  Now that his curiosity is piqued, Steve’s not going to be able to concentrate on much of anything until that 4pm meeting is over.  Which means his entire day is pretty much shot.
So… it looks like our boys will finally get to meet each other in the next chapter! 😉
"Hank Pym," Tony said, without hesitation. "That asshole was always jealous of Howard."
And it was even better once their penthouse was finally done, because then they only had to ride the elevator up to their home instead of driving back out to Grandpa's mansion in the suburbs. Even as a little kid Peter could tell that Dad was uncomfortable there, almost as though Grandpa's ghost was haunting him or something, which Peter always thought was a bit odd since their Malibu house had also originally belonged to Grandpa, but Dad didn't seem to mind it quite as much.
"I'm sure we can help with that," Papa said kindly. "Tony?"
"Hey, buddy," Dad said, sounding so exhausted that a knot rose in Peter's throat. "You can probably figure out while I'm calling, yeah?"
“Thanks, Dad.”
In fact, Tony had reiterated to Peter just that morning that he could buy whatever he wanted so long as it was something he knew he’d be allowed to read, an instruction Peter had been all too happy to agree to.  He had also promised Tony that he would do his homework at the school before heading over to the bookstore, a pact that so far he hadn't broken once.
, 'cause I take videos all the time, but anyway… That was right when Papa and Uncle Thor pulled up, so they both heard Flash call me an idiot but Flash didn't know that Uncle Thor was in the truck with Papa, and so then Uncle Thor got out of the truck, and he came right up to Flash, like right up into his personal space and stuff, and then he looked down at him all grim-like, and—" Peter paused to gulp a few breaths of air, still grinning widely. "And
"Yep, I did," Peter said weakly. "Beat Uncle Bucky too."
Sam cut him off with a raised hand. "Nope, we're not going there. I'll see you on Thursday, right? One o'clock?"
Heat burst through Steve's body like an exploding grenade at Tony's desperate tone, and he chanced a glance up at his husband's face, nearly climaxing at the mere sight of him. With his wet-plastered hair and hooded eyes lined with those thick, inky eyelashes, the sheer beauty of him was almost overwhelming.
Bartlett's eyes flicked briefly from Steve to Tony and back to Steve again before nodding towards his two partners. The two men started to approach Steve from opposite sides, almost as though as they were trying to corner him.
"Everything look good here, J?" he asked as he expanded the left boot of the hologram, tweaking a couple of things on the ankle joint.
Steve shot him a frown. "You're feeling guilty. And don't try to tell me you're not because I can see it written all over your face, and there's just no reason for it, sweetheart. No reason at all. There was no way we could've known that Raxton guy was gonna be at the theatre today when we didn't even know what he looked like."
“But we are doing everything that we can to locate Captain Rogers,” Fury continued.  “However, given the current rising tensions in the area and the weather system that’s dumped over a metre of snow there in the last few days, we are having a bit of trouble obtaining permission to enter the country.”
Peter's heart started to thud as Thanos stepped away from the vanishing portal, his rather small, beady eyes scanning the area. Given the dude's size, which was considerable, Peter estimated that he was at least as strong as Hulk. Which, based on what Uncle Bruce had told Peter about Hulk's fight against Abomination, was definitely
Tony snorts, his chin dropping to his chest as he shakes his head.  “Jesus, Cap, you sure do have an interesting way of propositioning a guy, you know that?”
"Tony," Steve said quietly, turning to his husband. "Sweetheart, we need to get Peter back to the Tower. Right now. We can call George Stacy to look after him, but I don't want him out there in the city while—while—"
Instead of answering, Steve grabbed Tony's chin, bringing their lips back together as he shifted them on the couch so Tony was lying underneath him. Tony's legs instinctively hitched up, wrapping around Steve's waist as his calloused palms glided up Steve's arms to his shoulders.
Peter shuddered as another bolt shot down his spine, the electronic wobble increasing. "Dad, please! This isn't good! You've gotta—!"
Exiting Peter's room, Steve headed two doors down to where he had tucked Tony in, finding him in the same position he'd left him. Carefully, he crawled onto the bed, sliding his arms around Tony as he pressed gentle kisses along his temple and cheek.
Slowly, Tony turned his head, gulping against the marble-sized knot in his throat as he studied the girl's androidish face. She wasn't crying—perhaps she was unable to cry—but her shoulders were sagged and her eyes half-lidded, like she was also grieving.
As antsy as Tony was to get started, by the time General Okoye came to escort them to the banquet, he had managed to settle down a bit. Changing out of his travelling clothes and getting to relax some while Steve insisted on waiting on him did him more good than he cared to admit. Repairing Thor's busted-up ship out in New Asgard for over a week had been more exhausting than he'd tried to let on, but of course, Steve had been able to see right through him, as he always did.
