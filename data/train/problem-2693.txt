He'd been driving for a while on Highway 281, and he remembered he had Cas' tape. He pulled it out of his pocket, took the cover off and put it in.
He stared at the screen. His wallpaper was the photo he had taken of a picture of a four-year-old boy. The boy's mother shopped regularly at the supermarket where Castiel worked under the name Steve. One day the boy had given him a picture that had a flowery meadow painted on it with lots of bees buzzing about. There was also a big bee and Jonny, the boy's name, had explained to him that it was Castiel/Steve.
Dean told him about the last case he'd handled, and Cas listened. When Dean was done, he felt like he'd been there with him. "This will be our last case," he thought and swallowed. He had a big lump in his throat.
At some point, Dean turned off the road and drove onto a dirt road. After a while he stopped, turned off the engine, looked over at Castiel and squeezed his hand. Castiel turned away from the window and looked at Dean. An almost shy smile came across their faces. At such moments, they always felt like newly in love teenagers.
"You know what, Gabe? I'm really surprised you didn't bring 'him' here. After everything you've done here. You probably wanted to start small first by bringing his brother here. But it doesn't work like that. You may have had good intentions when you lured me here, but I can't trust you anymore. You promised it..."
Yesterday, when Dean had called Cas from Glasgow, they were on the phone for four hours but at five in the morning Dean had said 'goodnight' because the next day he had to be in Edinburgh.
On the way to his bed he put down his duffle bag. Then he sat down on the matress. Cas hadn't heard him approching so he opened his eyes a little startled.
As if struck by lightning, he broke away from Dean and inhaled. Dean also breathed heavily, but grinned at Cas.
„Black as your wings and blue as your grace“, mumbled Dean and gave Cas a short but very clear kiss.
"Cas, please don't get scared now but actually have a plan... When we are in London we have an appointment at the London Eye. Sam and me get in to a gondola. You, your best man and a pastor coincidentally will come in there too. After two rounds the wheel will stop with our gondola on the top.
"Yes but I need to blow out the candles before that. By the way this idea was so cute, Cas, thank you." Dean stood up. After half the candles, he groaned.
"Gabe, you're such an ass!" Castiel's response was quiet, but angry. Gabriel winked at him, stood up and now looked Castiel in the eye. A small smile played around his mouth.
"Oh come on, we're all drunk anyway. It'll all be forgotten later." Gabriel struck a conciliatory tone. Then he turned and looked at Sam. "Winchester, I'm right, aren't I?"
He walked up the stairs, opened the apartment door, put his keys on the dresser in the hallway, and headed toward the living room. It was Castiel's favorite room and whenever you wanted something from him, that's where you would find him.
Dean was happy. Cas had done everything right with the tape. And now when he thought about it, he admitted to himself that he had been holding out on Cas for far too long. He decided as soon as he got home, he would call Cas. He would ask him to come by and then tell him that in the future he would stand by him in public. Let the others think what they wanted to think.
They drove down the road sitting in Baby. Dean as driver, Castiel as passenger. For the way back, it would be the other way around. Castiel was the only one he would readily allow to do that. Sam had to ask for days, and then Dean would just grumble and hand over the key. But with Castiel...
Dean noticed how his lower abdomen reacted, even more than before. He slid his arms under Cas's coat and pulled the boy even closer. Cas increased the pressure of the kiss, which finally took Dean's breath away.
"Hey, buddy", Dean whispered. Cas closed his eyes again. Dean sighed and was about to leave but Cas grapped his arm.
Dean would never admit it. Neither to Sam nor to Cas but he was heartbroken. He felt betrayed but most of all sad. He felt like he was about to be robbed of something he wasn't allowed to have. Time and a life with his best friend, his angel Castiel.
The next morning he called the Oak Park Retirement Home. He introduced himself as Dean Winchester, because he thought he could get more information that way. After he got in touch, he heard laughter in the background and then nothing. He was about to hang up when a very nice sounding lady answered.
"Mmh."But Dean didn't seem to be interested in that, wandering his lips along Castiel's jaw and muttering a 'later' when he reached his chin. Castiel clasped Dean's hand, which was still stroking along the cuff of his shorts. He could feel himself starting to get hard again. He turned his head to Dean, mumbled an 'okay' and pulled Dean down to him.
It was the evening of his birthday and Castiel was sitting on the couch at home. The TV was on, but he hardly looked at it. He was thinking.
Dean opened his eyes. He realized that Cas was watching him. He had been so preoccupied, he didn't notice Cas had pulled away.
The pastor knows the guy who will be on duty there when we are there. I know it isn't a big wedding only a private one but the big fest we can have after my tour.
Castiel shook his head, and Dean threw a punch. Castiel whimpered briefly, was released by Dean, and plopped back in his chair.
"You won't hurt me, buddy, please...", he whined. He tried to put his knees around Cas's hips to pull him towards himself. And Cas? Cas removed his trousers, then he leaned in and lined up. Dean closed his eyes, his heart reacing when he felt Cas's teasing.
"Oh, God... I'm sorry," Dean said quietly, but Cas was not deterred. And Dean? He had never thought that chasing his feelings could be this good. He dived his hands into Cas hair and pulled him down a little more. Cas has losened up a bit so he wouldn't gag ths time. Instead of he growled and Dean could feel the vibration of it. It made him shiver.
Arriving at their still shared apartment, Dean got out of the car in a reasonably good mood. He was also a bit nervous, but wanted to give Castiel the opportunity for an explanation. It was a pleasant spring day, not yet particularly warm, but nature was blooming. Secretly, Dean loved this time of year and that's why he started whistling softly now. On second thought, he was even ready to forgive Castiel.
Meanwhile Cas had managed to free himself from the hug and had turned to Dean. He put his arms around Dean's neck and pulled the older Winchester towards him. Dean let it happen wordlessly and started to turn in circles with Cas, slowly swaying to the music. They both closed their eyes.
Soon after he turned around, Dean could feel Castiel's strong hands wrapped around his stomach. Castiel spooned him tightly, pressing his lips to Dean's neck. He groaned and turned his head so he could give Castiel a proper kiss. While Castiel's hands wandered down over his chest to his hard cock, his mouth came to Dean's ear.
After a few minutes he got up and started to pack his suitcase. He packed laundry, toiletries, a few of the vinyl records, his favorite mug and the small plush dog that was on his bedside table. He put it all in the car already, but then ran back again. He had forgotten something.
Dean carefully pulled out the headphones out of Cas‘ ears. He also took the phone and put it on his nightstand. Cas didn't made a sound. He only moved closer to Dean than he already had.
It had been five years since Dean had broken up with him. And he could not talk about it with anyone until today, because Dean was still in the closet. Their relationship had never been public and that was also the reason why Castiel suffered so much. He would have liked a hug, but he had promised Dean at the time to keep quiet.
Dean and Sam sat at the bar of the hotel they were acommodated. Deans' bodyguards were with them to handle super fans if there would be any. But this evening only an old man was sitting at the bar too. It seemed that he didn't know who was sitting with him and the brothers were practically on their own. They talked about random things in a low voice so the man wouldn't get disturbed.
"You're amazing, you know that? Even when things aren't perfect, or we're fighting or something, you're always there. You can always be counted on, no matter the situation."
"Fuck," Dean breathed, burying his hands in Castiel's hair while Castiel rested his on Dean's hips. Their erections lined up, Castiel thrusted up in a slow move.
Castiel had lost track of time and he feared that Dean, who had not even interrupted him, had fallen asleep. He was about to ask if Dean was still awake, but didn't get around to it.
They kissed again, put the boxes on their nightstands and cuddled against each other. The candles weren't burning any longer, so the room was dark now. Only the starry nightsky could be seen through the open curtains.
Cas and Dean put the bowls and plates together and brought it all into the kitchen. They didn't wash it off, though. They went back to the library.
He had discovered a place that night that he had never shown to anyone before, not even Sam or Cas. It was a place just for him, he thought. But today it was about to change. He was gonna show Cas that special place. He had something planned…
Dean stood up as well, his appetite gone. He took a beer from the fridge and sat down in front of the TV. Castiel's behavior was on his mind.
He left the washroom and went back to class. The teacher looked at him briefly, but said nothing. For the last few minutes, Dean was no longer present. He immediately had a free hour, which he would spend in the library, since Cas still had lessons. But after that...
"I know that, but I missed you anyway. When you're not by my side, I feel so alone. Even though I almost always know where you are."
"Yeah anyway. I'm sorry." They were both silent for a moment, then Castiel spoke again. He was sitting cross-legged by now, and in such a way that he could now look at Inias. "That you are confused, I can understand, but have you ever thought about it? I mean, why are you confused? I was no different back then. But I realized very soon that girls could be nice, but that I couldn't do anything more with them. It were always the boys who fascinated me."
He pressed Cas against the wall and pressed their lips together before the other could say anything. Cas, very surprised by this outburst, but no less enthusiastic, replied. Whatever made Dean do it, he was on board.
Dean pulled at Cas's arms, and Cas understood. He slipped so far over that he lay on top of Dean. Dean took a deep breath and enjoyed being near Cas. As if by magic, his lips opened and their tongues began to play slowly. This went on for a few minutes, then Cas separated from Dean's mouth. Dean tightened the grip around Cas's upper back, almost as if he was afraid Cas would leave now. This one seemed to feel this and laughed softly one time. Then, just like when they met at the gym, he went over his jaw to Dean's ear. There he gently kissed the spot under his ear and nibbled lightly on the earlobe. Dean's breath would stop and he'd open his eyes. This was more intimate than anything he'd ever done before.
"It doesn't matter. I will be careful." He bent down and bit Dean's lower lip slightly. Meanwhile, his right hand moved down and undid the trousers. He pushed them down as far as he could and now the bulge was clearly visible in Dean's boxer shorts. Grinning, Cas looked up.
"Mmm," Dean said now, but didn't let that stop him from continuing to spread kisses on Castiel's neck.
Dean slid to the floor and began to cry. In less than two hours his whole life had fallen apart and he had lost everything he loved. The radio was playing in the background, which he had not noticed before. The song that was playing did not help to improve his mood.
They both laughed quietly for a moment, but did not move otherwise. They just held on and listened to the song. At the end of the song, Cas nudged Dean with his nose.
Now Dean turned to his right side, he didn't want to get up yet. There was something on Cas's pillow, but with his eyes not yet fully open he couldn't see what it was. He rubbed his eyes a few times and then leaned on his elbows. What he saw now astonished him. He blinked and looked again. In fact...
Before all the turmoil started, Dean and Castiel had talked about it and both had agreed that they would make it through the four months.
Dean's cock was leaking with precome. Cas licked at it and swallowed down. He slid up and down, sucking. Dean felt a finger moving. Oh Lord- Was Cas?- Shit!
„Dean“, Cas began, „I have seen this kind of thing here so often, but I never thought it would happen to me. I am just speechless.
"Yeah sure you can, he's not there." Castiel listened for a moment. "Right... See you then. Me too!" Castiel made a kissing noise, then hung up. Dean's stomach turned.
Sam sat in his room, but he forgot to close the door. Jack, who had dared to go into the library and read his book very quietly, suddenly heard a song. He followed the very sad melody and stopped at Sam's door. Sam sat with his back to the hall and therefore could not see Jack.
"Of course you can go, Dean. You look very battered. If you don't get better, please go to the nurse's office."
"Yes it is, Cas" Dean said, putting his hands around Castiel's face, "it's that simple." He looked at Castiel intently, then lowered his head a tiny bit. Their lips touched, just very lightly, but for both of them it felt like time stood still. At first Castiel didn't move, but a short moment later he sighed, wrapped his arms around the middle of Dean's body and returned the kiss with more vigor.
With Cas it was something else entirely. If you would ask Dean, he would answer that it felt like he was a completely different person. Cas was a year above him and was a straight-A student in his classes. He was beloved by the teachers and the girls. The boys in his class were not enthusiastic. Similar to Dean, the students assumed that Cas was involved with Meg, but this was not true here either. Meg was Cas's best friend and unlike Lisa, she knew what Cas was really like. She assured Cas again and again 'Clarence, your secret is safe with me'.
At some point, Cas stopped. They got out, and Dean let Cas guide him. After a short walk, they came to a clearing. It was already dark, but it looked even darker out here.
But he couldn't concentrate on watching TV even half an hour later. He decided to let it go for the day. He got up, turned off the TV, and went to the kitchen. His mother had used to make him warm milk with honey when he was a little boy and not quiet. He had always fallen asleep after it. Why it came to him just now, he didn't know, but he would just try it.
"What are you doing, Gabe?" Angrily, Castiel looked at his brother. Gabriel had been getting on Castiel's nerves mightily with his questions for a while, and he had to know the answer to the question for Inias or he wouldn't have asked it. "For you, everything is always just a game right? I guess it doesn't occur to you that you're hurting someone with it?"
The questions became more permissive and the tasks more 'interesting'. Gabriel's turn had just come and he had chosen Inias.
He walked out of the kitchen almost backwards again. Now he noticed something he hadn't paid attention to before. There was a duplicate copy of everything that was lying around in the room. Two plates, two cups, two Asia boxes, two red wine glasses. A bad feeling was slowly but surely spreading through Dean. He ran to the bedroom, where he found that the door was closed. "Castiel?" he called loudly and opened the door.
"Yes, Dean, I'm listening. You're off, you said. Sorry." Castiel smiled slightly. It looked more like he just lifted the corners of his mouth, though. He put his cell phone down on the table. Turned it over, screen down. Then he glanced at Dean.
It was a starry, summer night, warm and clear. ...and the music playing softly in the background as they drove. Dean would tap the beat on the steering wheel while Cas watched the stars. „As if he knew every single star“, thought Dean and smiled as he watched the dreamy looking angel from the corner of his eyes.
It wasn't a long act but it was an act full of love and passion. Afterwords both men were lying panting and exhausted between the sheets and pillows. Sated and far more than happy, Dean snuggled against Cas. Cas pulled Dean even closer and placed a light kiss on his head.
"Come on, Cassie." Gabriel interjected. "Don't be a coward." That made anger boil up again in Castiel.
Meanwhile they had finished eating and Dean thanked them for the nice idea. Cas smiled. He loved it when Dean was happy, and right now he was.
"You know, Jack", Eileen started and put her hand on Sam's, so that they were both resting on her stomach "eight months from now..."
Dean's note had been on the coffee table since he had arrived back home. Castiel wanted to call him, but he didn't know if it might be too soon. They had just seen each other again today. And even though it was the best birthday he'd had in years, it felt to Castiel like he was crossing a line if he called Dean now.
"Yeah, maybe, but it's true. You write an application maybe once a month and that's it. Especially since it's been going on for two years."
"Cas, it's good to see you again." Castiel and Inias had stopped. Castiel looked at his brother and whatever it was, Inias looked like the time he had come home as a young boy with a bloody nose and scraped up legs and hands. That had been the time when Inias had been so teased by the boys in his class. He had run all the way and hid in Castiel's room until he had come home, cleaned the wounds, put band-aids on them, hugged Inias and promised him that everything would be okay. Inias had always come to Castiel when something was bothering him, even later as a teenager. Until Castiel had left.
Ten minutes later, an arm wrapped around his shoulders. Castiel flinched slightly, turned to the side and looked at Inias. His little brother, who had grown taller than him by now. When Castiel had left, Inias had been close to his majority.
Jack was pleased to see this. Sam smiled again, sometimes he even laughed again. He had no more dark circles under his eyes, rarely woke up because of nightmares and had also regained his former strength. Sam had never said it to him, but Jack could sense that Sam was glad he had brought Eileen. Sam would probably never get over the loss of his brother completely, but with Eileen he could go back to life.
Back in his bedroom, he turned on his cell phone. He had a message from Meg and one from Gabriel. Meg's was nothing more than 'maybe we'll see each other again', while Gabriel's was 'PLEASE get in touch. We need to talk.' But Castiel ignored them. Yes, maybe he had overreacted, but Gabriel had broken his promise. That hurt. He lay back in bed and turned off the light.
"Honey -bee...", Dean caressed Cas cheak with his thumb, "I missed you too! You won't believe how much and I'm so happy that you're here. Your arrival here was indeed a surprise but if you allow it, I have a bigger one."
"I thought we were here in the kitchen." Jack tilted his head to the side with a questioning look. "What's going on? You two have been acting so strange all day, you can hardly keep your hands off each other?!"
The time with the Winchester brothers, especially the time with Dean, had made him develop feelings and emotions he had never known before.
"Naawww, Cassie, still the the great protector for our youngest?" Gabriel's voice dripped with false pity. Even if he meant it in jest, Castiel knew Gabriel knew no such thing as boundaries. Even when they were children, Gabriel had it in for Inias. He never got violent with him, but words can sometimes hurt more than a fist.
But even here, nothing more than kissing or cuddling had ever happened. Every now and then the kisses became more heated, but nothing more.
Castiel didn't answer and went back to looking at his hands. Dean swept the table aside and reached for Castiel's T-shirt collar with his left hand. He pulled it up and raised his right hand as if he were going to punch. This time Castiel flinched.
"I'll do it this way, y'know? It's me who's saying sorry." He wrapped his hand around Dean's erection and began to stroke him, matching his thrusts. Dean closed his eyes. "But I'll add this."
Dean throw himself at Cas who tipped over and pulled Dean with him. Their were laughing and rolled from one side to the other on the bed for a while. When they stopped Cas lay above Dean and smiled. Dean pecked his lips again.
~ It is possible to get from Lawrence, Kansas to Lafayette, Louisiana within one day (or the other way around)
Why hadn't he noticed Sam before? Dean had often shown him pictures of his brother. So why hadn't he recognized him? Probably because he hadn't expected to. Castiel was annoyed. He would have left immediately if he had known Sam was here.
Dean hesitated but then laid down beside Cas. Now Cas sighed and moved closer. He put an arm around Dean's middle and his head on Dean's shoulder. Dean stiffened but didn't move. When Cas didn't do nothing further, he relaxed and turned so he now was facing Cas.
Dean was close and Cas began to loose the steady rythem, so he as well was near. Dean put his arms around Cas's neck and dragged him down for a hard and breathless kiss.
"Dude, what was that about?" cursed Dean, shoving Castiel. He lashed out again, but this time Dean intercepted the fist first. Now, as Castiel raised his other arm to hurt Dean elsewhere, Dean enclosed him in his arms.
The boy didn't pay any attention to them and disappeared into a cabin. Immediately Cas was with Dean, stood behind him and wrapped his arms around Dean's middle. They didn't have much time and so Cas whispered in Dean's ear only a 'Wait for me after school, at the exit by the gym'. Then he turned Dean's head in his direction, gave him a short and firm kiss and disappeared. Dean tried to calm himself down with cold water, but it only half worked.
"Cas, honey, I've got something. I know the vacation had to be cancelled because of me. I've got a new date now."
Cas heard Dean come into the library. From the entrance hall you could see the room itself, but not the tables in the library.
"Cas?" Dean's questioning voice brought him back. He cleared his throat slightly and looked at Dean.
That's when the boy came to the sinks. He looked at Cas and smiled, then dried his hands and left the room. The door wasn't even closed properly when Dean was already at Cas.
This is where Cas interrupted him. He threw himself into Dean's arms and pressed their lips together. Dean must have been surprised, because he could barely keep his balance.
It was such a tender kiss that Dean's heart ached. The kiss was so different from all the others before it, including the ones earlier at school.
It wasn't the first blow job he'd had, but the mere thought that it was Cas this time made his pelvis involuntarily pop up. Cas gagged slightly, he probably hadn't expected it.
You were the first person I had such strong feelings for. I wasn't used to it, I still am. Sometimes I'm really scared that one day you'll get tired and leave. Because I still can't understand what keeps you here with me and what I have earned you with. What do I have that you can possibly need?!“
When his big brother had stopped by last week, Castiel had been very baffled. He had believed all along that no one could find him.
But now he had to wait. Dean had been gone for almost a week by himself. This morning he had checked in with Cas and said he would be back late tonight.
"Ff- Cas-," he whispered. Castiel moved again and Dean could feel the burn but it didn't matter. Pleasure he felt too and he wanted more. He began to rock back against Castiel's fingers.
"No, just like this." Castiel told Dean. He had found a languid rhythm for them while kissing Dean deeply. But when Dean begged again he managed to put more power behind the next thrust. Dean rocked back against him and Castiel who by now has burried his face in Dean's neck, moaned.
A week later, Sam, Eileen and Jack were sitting in front of the television. They had completed a Harry Potter marathon and when Jack, sitting on the floor, turned around, he had to smile. Both Sam and Eileen had fallen asleep. Sam's head was resting on Eileen's lap and Eileen had turned slightly to the side so that her head was on her shoulder.
His sister Anna, his big brother Gabriel, his little brother Inias, his mother Naomi, his father Chuck, his good friend Meg and a few more people who had to belong to Gabriel. In addition to them, however, there was also a very tall, brown-haired young man and a small, petite woman with orange hair.
„Cas, I'm sorry. I didn't know my mpff-“ Here he was interrupted by Cas. The angel had thrown himself into Dean's arms and kissed him stormy. Dean kissed him back and then they parted ways.
" Whoever was on the phone, it wasn't Gabriel, first of all, and secondly, that one word triggered suspicion in Dean. Who was that on the phone?
He got up, showered, and made his breakfast in a good mood. According to the time, it was more like brunch, but he didn't mind. He sat down at the kitchen table and looked out at the courtyard. The sun was reflected in the blue water of the large swimming pool.
"Dean, your question from this morning..." Castiel tugged on Dean's ear. "Was that one in jest, or did you mean it?" Dean looked at him for a long moment, then stroked his finger across Castiel's nose and cheek.
It was way past midnight when Castiel woke up. He had a headache and felt exhausted. He sat down and saw that Gabriel had fallen asleep in the armchair across from him. He got up and went to the kitchen to heat up the pasta from yesterday. Halfway through, however, he turned around, went back and took the letter.
Arriving in the washroom he had to realize that Cas was not there yet. He paced restlessly up and down between the sink and the door. He had to wait five long minutes, then the door opened. A boy came in, whom Dean recognized as one of Cas's year and Cas himself.
Sam and Eileen stood at the stove. Eileen at the pot and Sam behind her. He had both arms wrapped around her middle and whispered something in her ear. She turned her head slightly and looked at Sam in a dreamy way. He smiled at her.
He let the picnic blanket slide into the footwell, moved closer to Dean, put his hands around Dean's face and kissed him. Dean made a surprised sound, but muffled by their joined lips, and returned the kiss. At some point they broke away from each other and looked at one another, cheeks flushed and breathless. Castiel's eyes glistened a little.
Moments later Dean managed to push Cas away from him so far that they looked at each other. The song was still playing in the background.
"It's like I'll never forget," Cas said quietly. "For five years I've been trying. I've dated other men, but no one can replace Dean. To me, he was and is the one great love."
It had probably taken him longer than the times before, because when he turned around now, Dean was standing right in front of him.
"Heavenly you say every time. Glad you like it." Dean, feeling Pie inhale, set his nearly empty plate aside, glanced at Castiel, and scrambled toward him. He took his plate from Castiel's hand, set it aside as well, and sat on Castiel's thigh.
What Dean didn't tell Castiel, however, was that he would be on his way right away. He was going to call his boss and see if he could go on vacation a week early. That way, he and Castiel would have more time to get their lives back in order.
He went back to the bedroom, where his private desk was. In the left drawer were still things from the relationship with Dean. Letters, small souvenirs, a disposable camera and a frame.The frame contained his favorite photo of the two of them. It was taken when they had met, before they had really gotten together.
Curious as he was, but with a proper distance, Jack followed Eileen. She disappeared into Sam's room and nothing was heard anymore. The next morning she appeared in the kitchen, prepared a small breakfast for two, took it and disappeared again.
"What's wrong?" Dean's voice sounded so loud it sounded like he was lying next to him. Castiel swallowed.
"God... You're so tight, Dean!", said Cas against his lips and captured Dean's mouth. Dean sighed and Cas twisted his fingers. He was searching for... "Jeez- Cas-", Dean cried out, his head and upper body rising... and Cas had found it. He now tried to hit Dean's sweet spot with every move of his fingers.
"And you're perfect." Dean kissed his cheek and then whispered in Castiel's ear. "And it's so cute that I can still make you blush after all these years."
Castiel captured Dean's lips once more and rolled his hips again. Still easy and slow. Dean put his arms around Castiel in a tight embrace. Yes, he had missed this. To be near a person but not only with the body.
A knock woke him up. Still half asleep, he glanced at the cell phone he had somehow placed on the nightstand. Eight o'clock.
"Oh come on, that's long gone and forgotten." Castiel smiled, Inias raised his eyebrows. "You better tell me what that was about your reaction to Gabe's question!"
"Ah, shit," whispered Dean. Castiel chuckled but didn't stop. This felt so good, so familiar. Dean opened his eyes, his breath hitched. Castiel noticed it. He slowed down.
Here Cas broke off in a tearful voice, waited briefly, cleared his throat and then continued speaking in a husky voice.
Cas dropped down on his elbows, leaning in for a kiss. Slow and gentle. He could feel Dean shiver beneath him.
He was more excited than ever about a birthday. For four months he had been taken. Not Lisa, as everyone thought. No, his boyfriend was named Castiel. Or Cas, as he called him.
"Dean. The main thing is you're here, the kids are here, and we stay healthy and happy. Everything else will come naturally As it has so far." He lowered his head and kissed Dean and this time the kiss was one that led more into an area that they shouldn't enter while they were in a public park with a lake where other people might pass.
Castiel smiled at Inias, who had come into the living room. He gave Sam an expressionless look, which Sam returned. He gave Meg a brief but firm hug. He also hugged his father and mother; it would be the last time, he knew. Then he stopped in front of Gabriel, looked at him sadly and held out his hand.
Dean, on the other hand, had lifted his head again and was watching his friend. Now they heard a voice and Cas had to notice that something was different.
"You mean- You're asking if I'm serious about the man I first saw when I was a teenager in school, the man I met again in college, the man who showed me what it could be like to be with another man, the man who helped me through every hard time, the man I couldn't imagine as a better partner and father to our children, the man I love more than anything-" Dean had to catch his breath. "You're asking if I'm serious about marrying this man? Of course I'm serious!"
They kissed again and Dean wrapped his arms around Cas' neck. Cas, however, broke away shortly after and began to kiss gently and approach Dean's crook of the neck again. He continued moving down the neck until he reached Dean's throat. Here he bit. Not in a way that hurt Dean, of course, but in a way that would be seen.
"No,no,no!", he thought and ran to Cas room. But his friend wasn't there either. Now his thoughts were expolding. Where could he be...
Cas had passed this on to Sam and Jack, and miraculously, Sam had found a case a few states over. He left with Jack about an hour after Cas told him. Silently, Cas thanked the younger brother and wondered if Sam knew anything.
"You left that out earlier, though. You hadn't mentioned that detail, but now I can understand your behavior."
And that was all he could say, because all he could think of to say was moan. Cas had put him in his mouth without warning.
"Dean, all of this is mutual. We've known each other for fifteen years and you haven't left my side for a day. No matter how hard it's been or how unbearable I used to be. You were all in when it came to adoption and you love our kids. These are just a few reasons why I love you. I really love you a lot and I would be honored to be your husband."
"Been a while... Whose fault is that, then? Certainly not mine, and honestly, I could have lived better without a reunion. So, you said hello. Mission accomplished, you can go again!"
"I'm so happy right now, you know!" Inias had spoken very softly, as if no one should know, then he hugged Castiel. Castiel was totally confused at first. The last time Inias had hugged him like that was probably a good ten years ago. When they were younger it had been normal, later it had become weird. But the way Inias was clinging to him now.... Castiel swallowed, then returned the hug. Inias was almost 23, but here in his arms Castiel was not holding a young man. He stroked his brother's back reassuringly.
Dean must have made a sound because Cas woke up, turned on the light on the nightstand and looked at Dean. He saw that Dean was listening to music. Cas put his hand on Dean's cheek and wiped away the tears.
"Well, checkmate, Clarence!" the woman giggled, but Castiel didn't respond to her. He just looked at Dean, and Dean looked back. With attempt to put all the disgust and anger he felt into that look. Eventually, the last cell in Dean's body seemed to have realized what was happening and he retched.
"Yes, thank you, it was perfect", murmured Dean and placed a soft kiss on Cas's temple. "Right here... Under the nightsky."
"Yes. I know how much you love it. The apples are from our garden. Jack helped me pick them up." Dean stroked Castiel's eyebrow with his thumb, then put his hand to his cheek.
"Ssh." Castiel's hand was still stroking him in a lazy motion but he tightend his grip a little bit. "Let me show you how sorry
Dean smirked and Cas frowned. A slight hint of fear could be seen in his eyes but also curiosity. Dean stayed silent and just locked eyes with Cas. Now Cas got a little nervous and boxed Dean's shoulder in a light way.
"Well, actually, I'd quite like to sit this one out." Inias spoke very softly, he was still shy, but Gabriel had heard him. Some of the others as well and they started laughing. Now Castiel, who had momentarily disappeared into a daydream, looked up as well. He looked first at his big brother and then at his little brother, but could see nothing wrong.
Jack found this flyer in a small wooden box under Sam's bed, took it, put the box back and left the room. He would call there tomorrow, maybe they could help him.
He drank his coffee, listened to the birds he could hear through the open window and enjoyed Sunday. It was a little quieter outside, you could hardly hear anything from the neighbors. In the distance he heard a low rumble and thought, illogical as it was, that maybe a thunderstorm was coming. He shook his head, got up and took the dishes to the sink. He took the rest of the groceries to the refrigerator.
"No, he doesn't. He'll get a surprise when I tell him as soon as we're in London but I know he won't destroy the wedding. How about you? Do you have a best man? Could maybe Gabriel come here by then?"
The thought of this conversation made Cas very sad right now, because he knew that this would never ever happen anymore.
"Dean, I missed you!", Cas said quietly. "And I'm sorry for my surprising arrival here but I couldn't wait any longer." Dean chuckled and pushed himself on to his elbow.
The fact that Dean was standing in front of the motel door could only be a bad dream. Someone wanted to play a trick on him. He shook his head and slammed the door. But the knocking started again. Castiel took a deep breath, then opened the door a second time. It was not a dream. Dean was actually standing in front of the door. They looked at each other.
Cas, however, did not want the kiss to end and let his mouth slide over Dean's. Again, Dean opened his mouth so that Cas could easily stick his tongue in. With the beginning of this kiss Cas let his hip circle around Deans. Dean moaned and let his hands slide into Cas' back pockets to press him even closer to himself. Cas just did a second hip-circle when the door opened.
The crowd was furious and Cas was happy, Dean sang this song only for him. He was so excited to see Dean that began to shiver.
It wasn't really a question, but Dean stopped talking anyway. Even in the dim light, Cas could see that tears were streaming down Dean's face.
"I've moved our vacation to there now. Tell me, are you even listening to me? You're just looking at your phone."
"It's true, isn't it? What Gabe said." Inias looked at Castiel, but he looked at the ground. "Cas, I saw you with the other young man then. When he said goodbye to you at our front door. You know, where Mum, Dad and Gabe went to Grandma and Grandpa's. I walked all the way to school and back again just so he could drive away and you had time to clean up the mess." Inias laughed softly and Castiel looked at his brother.
Dean took Cas in his arms and pressed him against himself. He was so happy, and Cas, the way he hugged him back, he was happy too. There was another click in the background, but they didn't let it bother them.
You are simply the best and therefore it is an honour for me to accept this proposal. Yes, I will marry you.“
It was still two days until his birthday, but Castiel wasn't looking forward to it at all. Nevertheless, he thought about it.
"Sshht", was Cas's answer. He also had to control himself and stroked Dean with his thumb reassuringly on the forehead. He gave Dean another kiss and then stepped back. "But somehow this is not the right place. Would you like to get something to eat?"
"Cas", mumbled Dean and kissed Cas on the temple. "Hey, I've only been gone a couple of days and nothing bad happened."
The picnic basket and the cooler were placed on the back seat, Castiel had the picnic blanket folded on his lap. Music was playing softly, Dean softly tapping along to the beat on the steering wheel every now and then. Castiel held the blanket with one hand and looked out the window of his door. Their free hands lay, fingers intertwined, between them on the bench seat. Only the soft clatter of dishes and bottles could be heard otherwise.
"I'll make it good for you, Dean." He let go of Dean's hard on and Dean whined. But he gasped when he felt Castiel's finger brushing against his hole. Castiel removed his hand and turned away to grab the lube which was standing on the nightstand. He also took a condom. He was sure that he wasn't 'ill' but better safe than sorry. When he gripped Dean again, the other man squirmed. Castiel chuckled.
Dean put his arms around Cas from behind and Cas dropped his head against Dean's shoulder. Dean in turn laid his head down in Cas's crook of the neck. For a few moments they stood there like this, then the nightly silence, in which they had only heard a few crickets, was interrupted by a melody.
"Mom, Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you guys up. And yes, I'm going to go. I shouldn't have come here in the first place. But Gabriel can tell you everything else later. He's in a chatty mood."
"Yeah, later", mumbled Cas, took Dean's suitcase and bag, throw them on the ground, put his arms around Dean's neck and crashed their lips together. Dean sighed and responded by puting his arms around Cas' back and kissing him back.
Dean was all the more surprised when he realized what the thought of the couple who had disappeared in one of the somewhat out-of-the-way toilets during the break was doing to him. You didn't have to be very smart to understand what was going on in there. Dean couldn't concentrate on math anymore because the idea of him and Cas...
"Well, it has a deeper meaning for me too. Today is the 20th of May right? Do you know the meaning of this day?"
Castiel smiled happily and got into the car. He would now start the drive to Lafayette with the certainty that Dean was back. It would take a few days, but then....
It had been a week since Gabriel had been there, listened to him, brought the letter from Dean, and asked Castiel to come home with him.
„Wow!“, whispered Cas reverently. He heard a faint click again, but just as he was about to turn around, Dean was behind him.
Everything was ready. Dinner was ready, the library cleaned up, the table was set, Sam and Jack were gone for two days and Castiel was waiting.
Dean tied a scarf in front of Cas's eyes and the question if he could see anything else, Cas denied. He let Dean take care of him and then he was led on by him. After a couple of minutes, they stopped. Dean let Cas go, but did not take off the scarf. Cas heard a rustle and heard a faint click. Then Dean was back with him. The scarf was taken off and Cas blinked two or three times. What he could see now took his breath away.
When Castiel woke up around half past eleven, he felt surprisingly well. The sun was shining brighter, the birds were singing louder.... Whatever that was.
He went to the door, but he wasn't really expecting anyone. It was 2 p.m. on a Sunday. He opened and almost fell over backwards. He hadn't expected to see Dean. They eyed each other slightly uncertainly, then laughed and Dean shrugged.
He couldn't ask any more questions, because Cas pushed him against one of the bookshelves and his lips were back on Dean's. Even though this kiss began as stormy as the previous one, Cas slowed the pace. He wrapped both arms around Dean's middle and pushed against him. Dean responded by wrapping his arms around Cas's hips and kissing back. So they now stood in the dark library for a few minutes.
They had never made their relationship public, and they always met in secret. While they had been in Purgatory for the first time, they had confessed their feelings and had also realized how stupid they had been to let so much time pass by. But it didn't matter now. They had each other through thick and thin and that was the most important thing.
~ If you wish, I will describe the deja-vú of Dean & Castiel more precisely in one of the following parts.
You never saw them together in school, at least not officially. But sometimes, when classes were unbearable, messages were sent. Then you could have seen them together in a washroom, an empty classroom, under a staircase or in Dean's car. Dean wisely did not park in the main parking lot, but nearby in a small side street.
"Cas-" Dean panted, eyes closed. "I need- Can you-?" Castiel hushed and kissed Dean's neck. After a moment he inserted a second finger and kisses his shoulder.
Dean also noticed changes. Castiel had gained a little weight, but really only a little. And it suited him well, he no longer looked as slim as before. Dark circles had formed under his eyes and he looked much older. The only thing that reminded Dean of the Castiel from before were those piercing blue eyes and the way Castiel tilted his head to the side when he was thinking. That's exactly what Castiel was doing right now, and Dean, who had often thought of that gesture, cleared his throat.
"It wasn't an affair, Gabe. It was more, we were together for three years. And I was ready to ask 'the one question.' But at the time, it had looked like my feelings wouldn't be reciprocated in the end."
"I told you I missed you. Hey, what's up? The music's not playing?!" Cas released himself completely from their embrace and went to the vinyl record player. The smile disappeared.
Again, Dean turned towards Sam with the last sentence and Cas who was lying on a bed, giggled. This song and these looks - it was so much Dean.
When they met, it was never more than a little smooching, cuddling, talking and enjoying the togetherness. At home they could not meet each other. With Cas there were always too many family members present and with Dean Sam was present. Not that Sam would have had anything against it, but he was at an age where he had to question everything and Dean couldn't he would ask an awkward question when their father was there. That's why they only met outside the school in places where no one could bother them. Quieter corners of parks, wooded areas between their houses, the lake...
Dean's hand curled gently around the base. His gaze flicked up and met Castiel's. They already had one round earlier but it hadn't been like what was about to happen now. This time it would be different.
When song number 5 started Dean had to smile. It was 'I Will Always Love You' by Whitney Houston. This choice of music was so typically Cas.
"Here... Something is wrong with our current room, so they gave us new ones. You have one and I have one." He throw the the key towards his brother who easily catched it. Sam looked a little confused but stood up.
"Yes." Then he kissed Dean. They both sighed softly. When they broke away from each other again, Castiel looked at Dean seriously.
The sight made his stomach turn. Two shocked faces looked at him. Castiel was lying on his back, a woman, about the same age, was sitting on top of him.
Sam was getting thinner and thinner and looked more tired every day. He couldn't even be there for Jack, who had lost the only father he had ever had. He knew that Jack was sad, and he was suffering the loss. Only, either Jack didn't care so much or he was just good at hiding it. He walked around that bunker as happy and unknowing as ever. It drove Sam crazy, and one night he was yelling at Jack. He was very drunk and afterwards, smiling bitterly, he realized that he was behaving like his own father. Jack only left his room after that when he could be sure that Sam wouldn't see him.
In the kitchen, he reached behind the refrigerator and pulled it forward a bit. Behind it were loose wooden boards from the wall. He pushed one aside, reached in and pulled out a small black box. This was where 'it' had been well kept, Castiel didn't trust electronics and would never have moved the refrigerator.
"That's not fair, Castiel. You know how much that book meant to me." Now Dean sounded angry. Castiel narrowed his eyes. Had he been asked later what had triggered it, he probably would have just shrugged. Whether it was Dean's obsession with the book or the argument with Gabriel that was still bothering him? I don't know. Whatever it was, the anger boiled up again and Castiel lashed out.
"I'm not a coward, Gabriel," Castiel shouted angrily. "I'm just a man who was trying to protect himself and the person he loves. From a world where we always have to defend ourselves, aren't acknowledged by the people who most should be, and are labeled by everyone as 'people of a different species' as soon as the truth comes out. So tell me Gabriel, who is the coward here? Me or you? Me who tried to have a life or you and your people who hide behind an old book and prejudice because they are afraid to get out of their comfort zone and would have to realize that the world is just not all black and white?!"
„Well... For one, Swayze sings ‚she‘ all the time, so it doesn't really fit, and two, I think it's so much more personal.“ He smiled at Cas.
"But? Cas what is it?" Cas didn't answer. He went to his suitcase and searched for something. Then he came back to the bed and sat before Dean. A little quieter than before he repeated his answer.
"I can't tell you the young man's name, but you observed it correctly. He and I were even a couple until his career became more important to him." What Dean had written in the letter he concealed. Somehow he doubted Dean had meant it.
Both of them were sweating and heavily breathing now. Castiel slipped out slowly, took off the condom and threw it on the ground. They could care about it later.
Cas laughed, he actually laughed. This first verse was nearly 100% like the phone call he had with Dean this night. Dean had told him that he loved the music, the fans, to be on tour... But he misses Cas everytime. And sometimes he wishes he could just cancel a show and fly right back to Cas.
"Yes, I'm still here. I'm sorry about Dean. I really liked him." Mildred cleared her throat. "And as for the huntress... her name is Eileen Leahy. She taught me sign language back then so I could talk to my daughter. Is there anything else you need?"
When Dean woke up the next morning, Cas was not with him. If they were alone, so if Sam or Jack or whoever wasn't there, they spent the morning together in bed.
Cas looked at Dean with big eyes and nodded. Dean screeched like a teenage girl and wanted to hug Cas but Cas asked him, by raising his hand, to stop.
The library was still dark, only the candles illuminated it. And these candles were now standing so that it looked as if Dean had wings. Cas opened his mouth. Dean giggled.
Castiel put his second arm around Dean as well and pulled him close. They were still lying under the covers, all sweaty, and they were supposed to be taking a shower, but neither of them wanted to get up. Now Castiel also felt Dean start to shake and cling to his arms.
"I'm sitting at work, staring at your picture, feverishly thinking about what I can change so we can have more time together again. But since I'm the only one bringing home money around here, I can't make a part-time job out of my work."
During that time, and the weeks that followed, Sam got worse and worse. They had been able to bury Dean and he was now resting next to Mary. Jack had suggested this and Sam hadn't objected. He hoped that Dean was in heaven, in his own and with everything that made him happy.
In a split second Dean and Cas separated from each other. Cas acted as if he was drying his hands and Dean stood, a little lower bent to not be seen in the mirror, above the sink and pretended to want to wash his hands. Both held their breath.
The finger was massaging the ring of his hole while Cas had him still in his mouth. Dean gasped and whimpered. Cas seemed to have mercy with him. He pressed one finger in, slowly and thoughtful since it was Dean's first time. He hummed around Dean because of the tightness. His mouth and finger were now in the same movement and pace. It was so overwhelming but it wasn't enough. Maybe Cas felt it too because he let go of Dean's dick, crawled up to his face and lingered over his mouth while he added a second finger. Dean's eyes opened.
A few minutes later, the black Chevrolet was heard driving away. Dean was gone, the apartment key he had slipped under the door from the outside.
"Cas?", he asked in shock. He couldn't remember that he heard Cas behind him. "Believe me, I'm freak and thrilled you're here but we could get in really-"
"Yes you will, come with me and let your family help you. You don't have to tell them the truth. This can stay between us. But it would be a distraction, and besides, you're only going to be 30 once, so come home."
"I want you," Dean began again, speaking slowly, "to leave the apartment and not come back until I'm gone." He didn't turn around, but at some point he heard footsteps moving away, and a moment later the apartment door slammed shut.
During the last verse, Dean had started the engine and was driving off. Lost in thought, he had just driven back on the road. If he had looked over his shoulder or in the mirror, he would have seen the truck approaching from behind. But this way...
"I wanted so badly to talk to someone about this, it would have been a lot easier for me to deal with the whole thing. But I stuck to our agreement, Dean. Even though it was damn hard. To be honest, it still is. I don't understand how you could break that promise?!" Castiel had spoken very quietly, but Dean had understood everything. He loosened the hug and pushed Castiel a little away from him.
They originally planned to use the first two weeks of the month for vacation, but Dean's boss and his staffing schedule intervened. Dean passed this on to Castiel and they both agreed that they would go later. But by mid-April, the 'vacation together' issue was forgotten and never brought up again. Dean wondered, hadn't they both been so excited?!
"Yes, okay, I'll tell him", was all Dean heard, then the barkeeper hang up and came closer to the brothers.
"Yeah, later", mumbled Dean, winked and pulled Cas' head down again. What started light and as a kind of game grew heated. Cas and Dean were busy for quite a while.
„I'm gonna blindfold you now, okay? You don't have to be afraid, otherwise the surprise would be gone“, whispered Dean Cas into his ear.
In March, Castiel seemed happier and more excited than he had been in a long time, and that lifted Dean's spirits considerably.
He put the needle on and went back to Dean. He pulled Dean a little bit away from the shelf and took him back into his arms. Again, Dean responded. He put his arms around Cas's hips again while Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. The music began.
"Stop it!" he said calmly but firmly. "This isn't making it better." Castiel tried to break free of the embrace, Dean only held him tighter. "The best thing is, you-"
"You know-" Castiel purred, "I'm sorry as well." His hand began to stroke Dean's erection, his own cock slid between Dean's ass cheeks. Dean asked himself blurrely when Castiel had removed his boxer shorts. The hand moved again.
An hour later, Dean was in the middle of what he thought was a Star Wars marathon, Castiel came through the living room and went to the kitchen. He had headphones in and was talking on the phone through them. He didn't even pay attention to Dean and Dean, who had briefly looked him over, turned back to the TV.
"I was talking to Sam. About us. I explained everything to him and found out two years ago that Sam is friends with Gabriel. I sought Gabriel out and asked about you. He couldn't tell me anything, though, and I gave up hope of ever meeting you again." Dean's voice sounded sad.
"No, I don't care. Now go," Castiel replied irritably. "And don't call me 'Cas' anymore, that time is over."
Finally he felt him press and it was so much bigger than he thought. His breath hitched ans Cas stopped.
When he sang the last sentence he looked towards his brother again as if he wanted to say it to Cas. Cas got goose bumps and smiled again. He loved Dean so much.
"Cas, will you marry me?" Cas' eyes opened so wide that Dean feared they fall out. Cas opened his mouth but closed it again.
"I'm sorry!", he mumbled. The next thing that happened was Cas turning out the light with a little wave of his hand. The room was black now and nothing was heard except for their breathing. But if someone would come in now there would be a long build tension in the air.
"No, was just startled by some of the things you said. That's why I left right away. I wanted to see you."
Cas turned around and what he saw now almost made him faint. He hadn't even noticed that they had turned on, but he was surrounded by many candles, which, on closer inspection, were arranged in the shape of a heart. And in the middle of it all, there... there was Dean. He kneeled on one leg.
But now that Sam hadn't eaten for a whole week, it was too much for Jack. He sat on his bed and wondered who else he could ask for help. He had already called Jody, but after several unsuccessful attempts he had given up. One last possibility was this young woman Sam had talked about a few times. After much thinking, he remembered that Dean and Sam had once told him about a retirement home where she had worked under a false name. He also knew that Sam kept a flyer somewhere.
Cas couldn't understand it at first but after a whole day with a lot of thinking he got it. Dean couldn't look at him anymore, so he thought.
The boy went, without looking at Dean, to the toilets. Dean, who stood bent over a sink, looked at Cas in the mirror questioningly. Cas shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.
"Just a kiss, Cas? Like the old days?" Castiel shook his head slightly. He kissed Dean on the mouth and across the jaw toward the ear.
"Oh, right." Castiel laughed out, slightly hysterical if you listened closely. He took a spoonful of the noodles on his plate in front of him. "Mmmh, that's what I'm saying. Delicious!"
Right now he was warming up his dinner and while watching the food turn in the microwave, he made the decision to go to his parents after all. He was free and unbound and could go back to his apartment if he couldn't stand it. But Gabriel was right, maybe the distraction would do him good and one only turned 30 once.
At first he was a little confused, but then it came back to him. Dean was here and he was lying, snuggled close to Castiel, behind him. Dean still seemed to be asleep, so Castile kept quiet, snuggled a little closer to Dean, closed his eyes and smiled. Yes, Dean was here.
Dean sat up straight again and wiped the tears from his face. "Isn't life a bittersweet melody?", he asked himself. "At the time, Cas told me that if everyone else had left, he would be the only one by my side. And now", Dean smiled sadly, "now everyone else is here and he is gone. What an irony."
While the song was playing, Cas and Dean had moved slowly swaying to the music. Wrapped tightly in each others arms, spinning in circles. Dean's head resting on Cas's shoulder and Cas's head in Dean's crook of the neck.
After an hour, Dean came out of the bathroom showered but completely exhausted. The door to the bedroom was open, the windows were open, the bed was newly made and there was no sign of the woman. Dean walked towards the kitchen as noises were coming from there. He continued quietly and then stopped in the doorway.
There was Cas.. In his bed.. And it looked like he was sleeping. Dean closed the door and moved forward. He could see that Cas was crying. Silent tears were running down his face. Dean would've never imagined that he could even feel more heartbroken than he already did.
"I could never have told Gabe all that. That's why I was so happy when you showed up. I was hoping, at the risk of sounding childish now, that you would give me a hug and tell me everything was going to be okay. Like you used to. When you actually said that yesterday, I was about to burst." Inias looked at Castiel. "I really missed you, Cas!" said Inias softly.
Dean had told Sam that he was gonna go for a drive tonight. Without his brother. He didn't mention that Cas was gonna be there. Not that Sam didn't know it, but Dean didn't want to tell him specifically. He just wanted some time alone with Cas. It had never really been a problem with Sam living in the bunker with him all that time, Dean was even happy about it. He liked having ‚his‘ people around so he could look after them. But now he just wanted to get out.
Before they got to the bunker, Sam drove to the police station to pick up the small box with Dean's personal things in it. Without comment, Sam put the box in the back seat. Then they drove on and a little later they reached the bunker.
"Say hello to me-" Castiel whirled around, his face contorted angrily. He walked toward Dean. "Say hello to me?"
Dean could feel the anger building up inside him. Anger about Cas, and anger about himself for not knowing.
When Castiel's first finger pushed in he sighed but also tensed up. Castiel kissed his neck and then under his earlobe.
It was half past four in the morning when he was handed the key to his room. He put down his suitcase and lay down on the bed, totally exhausted as he was. Within seconds he was asleep.
"Cas, look at me. Please." Castiel glanced at Dean. "It's over, okay? Talk to me. Tell me everything. Laugh, cry, yell at me, but please talk to me."
"Okay...", mumbled Cas and pushed in deeper. He was shaking with the effort of holding back. With his own tip he passed Dean's ring of muscle. Dean moaned louder than before and Cas clenched his teeth. He was ready for other moves but Dean wasn't, so he thought. But Dean was ready. He wrapped his knees around Cas's hips and tried to pull him in faster. A few moments later Cas was fully inside and nothing was heard but their heavy breathing.
"Then so be it. We're going to get married and we're going to have an even better life than we had before."
So now they were driving in the car and Dean had just changed the cassette and started it now. He had also put it together especially for his project. Now, when the music started and when
Dean, who had sat diagonally behind Cas in one of the chairs, had smiled and a warm wave of affection and love had rolled through him. An idea had been born in him.
"Sweetheart... Who do you think helped me change your room and who do you think is the bodyguard right now in front of our door? Hopefully he still has his music on?!" Cas giggled again. "So, yes Dean, I have a best man."
"It's all right. And yeah, I've thought about my confusion a few times, but just like you said - in this family, it doesn't count. And that's why I leave it at meeting women."
Another hour later, Dean was so tired he had almost fallen asleep twice already. He would not sleep in their shared bed tonight, so he decided to go to the bathroom only briefly. On his way there, he had to walk all the way down the hall. Here he stopped.
The picture hung in his locker, but after a few weeks it had disappeared. Castiel had wondered about that, and not a little, because only he owned the key. Oddly enough, Jonny and his mother had also never come back. What he had experienced at that time now made Castiel decide to dial the number from the note. He somehow already knew it by heart. No matter what time it was or how Dean might react, Castiel had already lost too much.
"Is this what you wished for?" He began to move the fingers already scissoring them. Dean panted and curled in himself a bit.
The little flower stands for: New beginning, loyalty, trust, innocence, constancy, purity and modesty.
A little later, Dean pulled away from the kiss. He was slightly dizzy, he needed air. Not that he regretted it. When he looked at Castiel, he seemed to feel the same way. Castiel laughed, still a little breathless.
"Cas, where-" Dean stopped his question. The room was darkened and lit only by two large candlesticks. Dean looked at the table first, then at Cas, stunned.
"I'll definitely come visit you, give me a few days first. I have to finish something here and then I can take some time off." He stopped for a moment, then said softly. "I want to be with you again." Castiel gave him a kiss on the head.
They listened to music and talked. Cas got up in between and changed the vinyl records. It was mostly the music that Dean liked listening to the most.
"I think you know there's still some clarification needed on some things, but I hope we do better this time." Dean laughed softly.
"Since December-," Dean repeated. He snorted and took a sip of beer. "Since December." Much too quietly, he set the bottle down.
Slowly Cas walked towards him, but Dean told him to stop. Cas stopped and looked at Dean with big eyes.
"You weren't well?" hissed Castiel. "Do you know how I was? I was left by you for a book. Do you know how cheap I felt? I loved you, Dean. With everything I had. I wanted to spend my life with you." Tears welled up in Castiel's eyes. "I would have left my family because of you. I was going to ask you to marry me. Do you understand?" Castiel looked down at the floor for a moment, then glanced at Dean.
Arriving at his car, he was astonished. A daisy and a folded note were stuck under the windshield wiper. Castiel put his suitcase in the trunk, went back and took the flower and note. The daisy he tucked behind his ear, the note he opened. He remembered that Dean had always carried a notebook with him. Then he began to read.
He hooked his fingers into Dean's belt loops, pulling him even closer so that they were pressed together from the waist down. Dean was so surprised by this new closeness that he released himself from Cas breathing heavily and looked at him slightly intimidated. Cas smiled and used the new freedom to change places. Now Dean was pressed against the wall. Cas looked at Dean briefly to assure himself that it was okay for him, but the only thing he could see was this newly awakened lust. He kissed Dean hungrily and stroked Dean's lower lip with his tongue to get admission. Dean granted and also opened his legs a bit so Cas could put a leg in between. This touch was also unknown and Dean gasped. He separated himself from Cas, closed his eyes and let his head sink against the wall.
He was waiting for Dean to come back. Where exactly he had gone, Cas didn't know. But he knew Dean would come back. All those years, it had always been this way.
Castiel smiled. "I won't." Then he kissed Dean, tenderly and his hand and hips began to move again. Dean choked out a moan and Castiel moaned in response. Castiel's hand tightened a bit more around Dean and his thumb swiped around his head and Dean realized the certain feeling in his abdomen.
He took a quick look in the rearview mirror, backed out, and drove off. As he pulled out of the parking lot and onto the highway, he laughed. He didn't want the rearview mirror. Dean and him, even if everything wasn't settled yet, would be looking forward together again from now on.
Sam, as the good friend he was, promised to make a video call with Cas for the show in Edinburgh today because Dean said he would sing a song only for Cas this night. Everytime Cas could be away from work, when Dean gave a concert, Sam and him video called so Cas could be with them.
Castiel said nothing to that, he just put his hand against Dean's and smiled. He rose as well, sat down and reached into the picnic basket. Hidden under a cloth, was the box of Apple Pie. Castiel opened it, put a piece on Dean's plate and his own, and set the box aside again. Then he handed Dean his plate and waited for the reaction.
After one or two more slow thrusts and a squeezed fist, he came. He locked up, clamped down around Castiel's cock. He didn't make a sound he only pressed their lips together harder. A few seconds later, Castiel followed.
"These, Dean, are the individual ingredients of a burger. I know you like to eat them, but I thought we might mix them up ourselves tonight." Cas had, while he was talking, spread the bowls and plates on the table in such a way that both of them could easily get at everything. He now sat down opposite Dean and smiled at him again. Dean swallowed.
In this list were: 'Dirty Dancing', 'Gone with the Wind', 'The Notebook', 'Pretty Woman', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'When Harry met Sally...', 'Out of Africa', 'Notting Hill', 'City of Angels' and of course 'Titanic'. But their absolute favourite of the 30 or so films they rented was 'Bodyguard'. Therefore it is not surprising for Dean that the song of Whitney Houston was included.
Lisa was his best friend, but that's all. Dean had had relationships too, but with all of them it had been a partner and these 'relationships' had not lasted more than a few days.
"Cas, I know this comes maybe all out of a sudden but you can believe me that I thought it through." Dean had sat down now so he could look at Cas fully.
Jack had backed out by now and Sam... Sam had slipped from the bed to the floor and was crying uncontrollably again. He missed Dean. He missed the brother and best friend he'd always had at his side. He missed the little taunts, the gloating comments, Dean's music, Dean's food, even Dean's long showers. It had always been a sign that he was not alone. Those rare little touches. Sometimes a hand on the arm, sometimes on the shoulder. What would Sam give to get one last hug from his big brother?!
"That your pie is heavenly is because-" Dean pushed Castiel's head back slightly and placed his lips gently on Castiel's. "It's because his baker is an angel." He kissed him gently. "But you're generally an angel, Cas." Dean kissed him again, and this time Castiel replied.
After the ceremony we have a whole week to ourselves. I don't know if you like this plan but I'm actually a little excited?!"
"No, Dean. Not yet, just relax." The slow torture continued but then Castiel added the third finger. Dean groaned.
He had left Lawrence, his place of birth. He had left Dean, his friends and family behind, taking only his cat, Nawiri, with him. He had been without a permanent home for a while, but then had settled in Lafayette, Louisiana. He had quit all connection to home, had deleted all social media accounts, and since then also called himself Steve. He wanted to forget everything that had happened before, but even now, five years later, his broken heart had not healed.
"I'd like to now..." That's all he got, but Dean knew what Cas was about to say. The thought of it immediately made all the blood flow towards his lower abdomen and he whimpered softly.
Dean took a photo of the bouquet and was about to send it when he remembered that it was total nonsense. He read the message again. Something confused him.
"Sam and Dean told me they came to you about a case. There was a huntress involved. She's deaf. I forget her name, but I know she was on the case. I really need her name because Sam's getting worse and I think she's the only one who can help now."
"I missed this too," Dean said but before Castiel could ask what he meant, Dean's lips wrapped around the head of his cock.
Sam gets the worst news he could get. He falls, but he can get up again, also because of Jack's help...
Contrary to what he was used to, he had not reacted to this message. He had looked at Jack and just told him that they had to go back immediately. Jack had packed up and they had left. Eventually they were on Highway 281 and they passed the same spot where Dean was killed. Sam just drove right past it and if Jack noticed something, he didn't say anything.
Dean, who hadn't seen the punch coming, went down. He wasn't hit hard, yet he looked up at Castiel, a little confused but also angry. He stood up and, holding his left cheek, walked toward Castiel....
The angel had stopped crying but his face seemed restless. Dean strocked his cheek. Slowly. And Cas leaned into the touch. They hadn't done this for a while now. Stolen kisses, desperate touches and secret make out sessions, oblivious to the world outside of their own, were a quiet routine for them. But since the big reveal nothing had happened between them. The last time was months ago.
"What do you want?" asked Castiel gruffly. It seemed he didn't want an answer, as he turned away from the door and walked toward the center of the room. Dean stood in the doorway a little indecisively, but then stepped inside and closed the door behind him.
"Sir, did you say something?" The truck driver turned to Dean with the phone on his ear. He had dialed 911 and now he knew the ambulance was coming.
Not five minutes later, Dean's hand, which until then had rested on Castiel's stomach, began to move. Dean let it rest on Castiel's abdomen and Castiel could feel the warmth radiating from it. Very lightly, Dean stroked his finger along the cuff of Castiel's boxers and Castiel moved slightly. Dean laughed softly.
"Ehm... Well..." Inias choked, had to cough, and promptly blushed. The other guests whistled and jeered, but Castiel stood up and went to Inias. The man had lowered his head.
„Is it over yet? What a pity.“ Dean almost laughed. Cas looked so cute as he looked in disappointment toward the tape.
Dean went up again so only the head was in his mouth. The tip of his tongue swiped around it and then pressed into the slit. Castiel held onto the sheets and moaned. Then his hands let go and he slid them into Dean's hair. Dean hummed in approval and the vibration went right down Castiel's cock.
The first song was 'Right Here Waiting' by Richard Marx. Dean looked a little surprised in the direction of the cassette but decided to let it go. Songs 2 to 4 were 'It Must Have Been Love' by Roxette, 'Nothings Gonna Change My Love' by Glenn Medeiros and 'Power of Love' by Frankie goes to Hollywood.

What can you offer, you ask?! You are the kindest, most loving person of all. You help everyone who means something to you or those who need help; you are there for them. You have the habit of doing everything from the right motives, even if the actions slip into the wrong direction. You have the purest and brightest soul among all earthly beings and you try to get up again immediately every time you fall.
"How could I. In this family, you only count if you marry a woman, or in Anna's case, a man, and start a family. With me, questions were never asked because I was so busy with school. Later came university, I had more opportunities and since I always had good grades, Mum and Dad didn't ask either. When I finished studying and came back here, it became more difficult then. When I met Dean, I often got into trouble explaining things to Mum. I'd quite often come home late or stay out for a few days, but I never brought a woman with me. Secretly, I wonder why I didn't get caught to this day."
Now he put the glass on his nightstand, put on his pajamas, crawled into bed and sat against the headboard. Then he drank a few sips, leaned his head back and closed his eyes. Wonder what Dean was doing right now?
"You didn't?!" Castiel was shocked. All eyes were on him. Gabriel put his hand on his shoulder, but Castiel shook it off. He didn't feel like joking anymore.
"Oh, so here and there. What is it?" Dean looked at him and Cas knew he must have noticed something.
At midnight they were all not sober anymore and after congratulating and singing loudly, they decided to play 'Truth or Dare'. The first round could still be called harmless, but after Naomi and Chuck said goodbye.... Well, we all know what happens when parents back off and leave their actually adult children alone.
After Cas fell asleep, cuddled up to Dean, Dean took the phone and the headphones from the nightstand. Ever since he saw Cas crying with music in his ears he wanted to know the song which left Cas this upset. He pressed play and listened...
"I'm really sorry, Cas," Dean affirmed softly, his voice shaky. "I really missed you." Castiel cleared his throat, then replied just as quietly.
After a week of not talking, he got back to him, said he was sorry and that he would like to explain himself. Dean agreed and headed back, saying he would be home in two days.
", he thought. Cas took him in his arms and held Dean. Dean was surprised by the gesture, but returned the hug no less strongly.
"Oh man, now don't act like that." Gabriel laughed and turned back to Castiel. "Sooner or later-" But that was as far as he got, because Castiel lashed out and struck. Gabriel's head shot back and he went down.
They stood, what you could see in the darkness between trees, on a small plateau. They could look at a lake surrounded by trees and bushes. No artificial light anywhere in sight, only the stars and the moonlight reflected in the lake. Underneath them there was a soft splashing sound, which suggested that there must be a small waterfall down there.
Cas and Dean didn't like the fact that they had to keep their relationship such a secret. But they knew exactly what would happen if the quiet boy from the year before last and the straight-A student from last year were seen together. Neither of them wanted to risk that, partly because Dean had one more year of school to attend.
Dean had changed, Castiel had to admit. He had become thinner, he had dark rings under his eyes and the first gray appeared in his hair. But that was only noticeable because Dean and Castiel were standing close to each other. The only thing that hadn't changed was the gleam in his green eyes. Castiel shook his head slightly. How long had those eyes haunted him? And how often did they still do so today?
I want this to be over. I don't wanna hide anymore. I wanna go shopping, go to the cinema, go on a vacation but I wanna take YOU with ME." Dean stopped and breathed in, then he went on.
Cas had told him that he could take a few days of and would like to come and visit Dean, even when it has to be in private. Dean had been so exited that Cas had to laugh because he feared his mobile would start to burn with how much Dean beamed. They decided that Cas should come to London and meet with Dean there. Dean would arrive there tomorrow and after the show he would have a week off before he would fly to Spain.
The truck hit the Impala with full force and threw it into the roads ditch opposite. There the car overturned and came to a halt on the roof. The cassette continued to run.
Dean rolled over and snuggled against Castiel. He buried his head in the crook of Castiel's neck. Castiel stroked his back soothingly.
"Hey, Dean." Castiel laughed nervously. Dean looked at him with an icy stare, then walked toward the hall closet and picked up his jacket.
Dean put his head in the back of his neck and made room for Cas. But Cas had other things on his mind. In a blink, he switched positions again.
"Cas, you idiot!" Dean yelled. With his right hand he slapped the steering wheel a couple of times angrily, with his left hand he held on to the steering wheel begging for help. But there was no support for the fall he was experiencing just now.
Every time Jack could see Sam, headphones were on his head. Sam alone knew what kind of music was in them.But what Jack could say was that there was one song in this playlist that made him cry even more than the rest.
"No, no, no", Cas thought, "this can't happen. I gotta pull myself together. I got something to say to Dean. I knew it was gonna be hard, but so hard? Dean is so happy. I haven't seen him like this in a long time. Ugh, I can't. But I have to..."
He explained what had happened and she apologized for not hearing about it. Since she lived alone, those messages didn't reach her. It was also agreed that she would not go near the brothers for her own safety. But Eileen promised that she would leave immediately and the next afternoon she was there.
"I'm sorry, what?" Dean replied, now very angry. His hand clawed at the table, knuckles white. "Where am I? You know exactly where I am. But if you want it that way.... Where are you all the time? You don't even stop by my work, you don't even call when I text you that I'm on lunch break. When I do manage to get home an hour early, you just hang out in front of the TV."
He had burned the milk twice, made the honey run out, bumped his head while cleaning, and burned himself several times on the pot. In the end, he had managed to finish a glass of warm milk with honey, but he felt as if he had been standing in the kitchen for the first time ever.
After dinner, he cleaned up and packed his suitcase. Laundry and toiletries would be enough for a week. He wouldn't want to stay longer than that, if he could even stand it that long. Tomorrow he would be on his way.
Then he jumped up, his chair tipping over. He threw the bottles across the kitchen, they shattered on the tiles.
After spending the afternoon in two restaurants and making sure that Dean had taken care of Sam, they drove to a place that Cas wanted to show Dean. It was beginning to get dark. Dean, rather unusual for him, sat on the passenger side and looked at the landscape. With the sky darkened, the stars came out.
Then he drank the rest of the milk, put the glass away, turned off the light, and lay down. He actually fell asleep pretty quickly, too, but that didn't last long. Around midnight Castiel woke up again. He had had a strange dream, but couldn't remember it. Maybe he would fall asleep if he turned on an audio book? He got up and went to the living room, where he had left his cell phone earlier.
Two days later Sam was sitting at the kitchen table when Jack came into the kitchen in the morning. Sam looked up, got up and went to Jack. Without a word he took the boy in his arms, squeezed him tight and then left the kitchen.
"Do you picked this day randomly to ask me or does it have a deeper meaning for you? For me it has. Three years and three days ago we got together. So three and three, I thought it made sense. How about you?"
Dean was very busy at work. The press office where he was employed was very busy because of a big meeting with many politicians from all over the world. He therefore had less and less time for his boyfriend. Due to extra hours, he now quite often came home much later. Most of the time Castiel was already asleep.
Cas smiled. As he moved his mouth back down the path and stopped at the bend of Dean's neck, his right hand moved down Dean's body. Dean held his breath again, but now closed his eyes. Cas gently bit into a sensitive area on Dean's neck. Dean twitched once and opened his mouth slightly to breathe better.
Dean was on tour again. This time it was a big tour, nearly a world tour. On this tour he only had his brother and manager Sam with him. His boyfriend Castiel stayed in America. Sam was an absolutely fan of the relationship between Dean and Cas but they all decided to keep it a secret to not scare the fans away, so the record laber said it.
Cas was glad that he was alone in his room because he blushed furiously after this verse. Dean had sang it towards Sam again but wasn't only looking in his direction but was fully turned to him.
"Since the first time we met, I've been wanting to get my mouth on this, Dean." He looked down again, using his tongue to put pressure on the underside of Dean's cock. Dean surpressed a shudder and reached for Cas's head again.
Jack swallowed and was about to burst into tears himself. This song reflected complete despair. He wanted to go to Sam and tell him that he wasn't alone.
For three years, Dean and he had been together, but then Dean's book became a hit and Dean became an celebrated author within a few weeks. Then, just before his 25th birthday, Dean told Castiel that he was ending their arrangement because he wanted to concentrate on his career for now.
Gabriel had placed said letter on the sofa table, got up, and Castiel lay down. He didn't want the letter, but Gabriel insisted. Castiel grumbled, but his brother only put a blanket over him. When Castiel fell asleep, Gabriel disappeared. The letter was still on the table.
"And me with you." They both smiled and shortly thereafter they fell asleep, even though it was already noon.
At quarter to nine he heard the door of the bunker open and when he heard the familiar 'Cas, I'm back' he knew Dean was back. But he remained sitting in the library without saying anything. Dean would now go to his room for a moment before he came into the library. Dean knew that Cas's favorite place was there and he also knew that he would find the angel there.
"May 20th is the 'World Bee Day'. Bees are an endangered species and the human race has to care for them, much more than they do it nowadays."
"Mmh," he murmured just as softly, stretching his neck a little. Dean understood immediately and began kissing lightly from his ear down to his shoulder. Castiel's response sounded like a purr.
"I'm ignoring you? That's funny, I could say the exact same thing," Castiel replied, suddenly very serious and tense. "You're always just working, coming home late, who knows where you are-"
„Dean, what- Wow-“ Cas didn't know what to say at all. All around the lake, lights went on. It looked like a giant halo. Just across from them, a big white banner suddenly appeared. Behind the banner, a very bright light shone towards them, while a darker light, from somewhere below them, shone towards the brighter light. In the middle they met and formed a kind of threshold.
Castiel removed his fingers after stretching Dean open so it wouldn't hurt, both of them were already sweating. Dean heard how Castiel rolled on the condom and used some lube so he would get in easier. Castiel positioned himself at Dean's entrance, wrapped a hand around Dean's cock and slowly pushed in. Both men held their breaths until Castiel bottomed out and then moaned simultanisly.
"Hey," Dean said softly and began stroking Castiel's back. Castiel, meanwhile, was holding onto Dean's jacket desperately, his face pressed against Dean's shoulder. Dean rested his head against Castiel's and rocked them both back and forth gently.
The argument that followed had ended with two bloody noses and an angry and disappointed Castiel. Wondering if all the whispered words of love had meant nothing, he had walked out of Dean's apartment and out of their, until then, shared life.
~ I searched for apartments in Lafayette, Louisiana and actually found one which I could use as inspiration. Name and location are real and if you want to take a look at it, here's the link:
Everywhere were burning candles, rose petals on the floor like like a trace. He closed the door and followed the petals. When he stood before the bed he wondered if maybe he got the wrong room. On the bedcover, written in more rose petals, was a heart and in the heart he could read '
Castiel was stuffing the trash into bags, he had already put the dishes in the dishwasher. Dean went to the refrigerator, took out two bottles of beer and sat down at the table. One bottle he kept, the other he put down across from him. Castiel, who had been watching, looked at him. Dean silently indicated that he should join him at the table. Castiel did, and for a while they watched the drops of condensation on their bottles.
While he himself could have spoken the film from memory, everything had been new and exciting for Cas. Dean had watched him through the film. He had sat cross-legged on the floor, leaned his head on his arms and watched the action on the screen with his mouth slightly open and his cheeks red.
"Come on", Cas whispered, and they walked to the middle of the clearing. There he settled down and pulled Dean down with him. They lay side by side now, looking up at the sky.
"Are we a little impatient?" Dean grunted and rocked back. He had missed this. Only for Castiel he bottomed, he only trusted him. So yes, he was a little impatient. He wanted to feel it again. He wanted the feeling of letting go.
Dean and Cas had both remained true to the name of the song. Their thoughts had been with each other until the end.
With these words Cas disappeared towards the kitchen and Dean sat down at the table. Shortly afterwards Cas came back with bowls and plates on a big tray. Dean made big eyes.
"Yes, Dean, I will marry you but did you think I came with empty hands? Of course not. I planned to ask you as well." Now Cas opened the box in his hand and Dean could see a dark brown wooden ring, parted by a single green line. Dean's mouth opened in awe.
They went back to their old room, grabbed their things and headed of to the next floor for the new rooms. Dean's room was on the opposite from Sam's, so they said good night and parted ways.
Castiel quietly took it all in and then walked through the living room, the missing records immediately catching his eye. Dean had also taken his 'Blue Hawaii' with him. Castiel knew Dean had done this on purpose. He had mentioned often enough to Dean that Elvis was his lifeline. That this record was now missing had a meaning, Castiel understood immediately. He shook his head once and then went into the kitchen.
"You're really killing me, Dean." Dean lowered his head, playfully but gently snapping at Castiel's throat, growling like a hungry animal. Castiel laughed again and pulled Dean's head into the crook of his neck. Then he spun them both around so that he was on top.
2) A daisy can be found everywhere so it was easier despite the fact that they were at a motel and it would be a little bit weird if Dean had found white roses or something similar in its meaning.
"I..." Kiss. "Love..." Kiss. "You!" Cas giggled and Dean pulled him even closer. Cas raised his head and looked at Dean.
Dean tugged impatiently at Cas's coat, which straightened up, took it off and was immediately back with Dean. He stroked down Dean's upper body with his hand and this time stopped just above the belt. He let his hand slide under Dean's shirt. Dean, who had not yet been touched by Cas at this spot, raised his hand towards him. As they were no longer directly on top of each other but slightly offset, his already slightly swollen member pressed against Cas' hip. The relieving pressure made him groan again. He repeated the movement and surprised Cas. He then released himself from Dean's lips with a soft groan and Dean took the opportunity to switch places.
Cas opened his mouth as if to say something, but then closed it again. He intertwined his fingers behind Dean's head and pulled him towards him. The kiss was a light one, without any particular hidden motives, but still, this moment felt much more intimate than many a night together.
"Relax, Dean," Castiel said softly. As soon as Dean did it he moved his finger in and out, slowly. Dean's breath came through his open mouth and his fingers curled the sheets.
Dean wasn't angry, to be honest he was relieved Cas had told them his secret. But Dean was more than disappointed that Cas hadn't told it earlier. Now they didn't have enough time left to figure out a plan that could save Cas.
Castiel's family knew nothing of his homosexuality, so he was all the more surprised when Gabriel at some point hinted in that direction. He told his little brother that he had gotten the idea when he had picked up a letter without an inscription from the mailbox almost four and a half years ago.
"If Sam knew I was listening to this kind of music, I bet he'd look at me in a weird way," Dean thought.
"No," he began. He kissed Dean on the neck, then gave him a kiss on the collarbone. Dean gasped for air. He pulled Castiel close, and Castiel returned the hug. The doubts from before were gone.
"Yeah, Cas, I'm alright." Dean murmered. He turned his head and smiled. "Just move, please." With his other arm an hand Castiel held him even closer and locked their lips. It turned out to be a very passionate but also gentle kiss. Castiel pulled his hips back a little bit and pushed forward again. Dean let out a quiet moan and Castiel repeated the move. Only this time he pulled out a bit further before diving back in.
The knocking did not stop. Grumbling, Castiel got up, took a step and fell lengthwise. He had forgotten his suitcase.
When they calmed theirselfes after it enough that they could talk in a normal way, they turned to their sides so they could look at each other.
The ring was made of black metal, parted in the middle by a blue line. This blue line, which looked like a river, glowed in the candlelight.
He shook his head briefly, got up, and put his plate in the sink. Then he grabbed a jacket and went to the car.
"Oh my mmph-", was all Dean could say, then Cas's mouth was on his. Cas's tongue asked to be let in, which Dean let out a soft groan. He buried his hands in Cas hair and pulled the older boy towards him.
He had spent the whole day preparing the food. Sure, he could have ordered the burgers, but he wanted to make something special with the food. He had prepared everything himself. The bowls and the plates with toppings were waiting on the kitchen table while the meatballs were kept warm in the oven.
Cas sighed softly and released himself from the embrace. He stepped back a little, put one hand on Dean's face and smiled at him.
