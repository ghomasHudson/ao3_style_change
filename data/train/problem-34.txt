"/Always, John. You're my mate,/" he murmured low in his native tongue, he gently pulled John's face away from his ruff to look into his eyes. A small smile quirked the corner of his cupid bow lips. Fawnlock leant down to press a kiss under the crown, fingers still playing with John's hair.
There are 'NO RUNNING' signs sparsely scattered around the museum, the security guard doesn't say anything as the boys run by him, the boys were genuinely just thrilled to learn, they weren't fooling around. They have a purpose- a goal - a thirst for knowledge. "Those boys are absolute sweethearts." He compliments Mycroft, Mrs. Watson, and Winston as they trail after them.
Fawnlock watched with curious eyes as John collected a jumper that looked too long for the human and a bit too big too, and then used a pair of scissors to snip to collar of the knitted jumper. He stood still as John tugged the jumper on the fawn, carefully slipping the material over his delicate antlers, and settling the jumper on his arms and such.
"I'll send Mousey to tutor John when the snow begins to melt. I'm sure your bond while have formed strongly by then. And you'll have the entire three months of winter for your...honey moon."
Sherlock pouts as he watches Winston pack up their bags in the boot of the limo. He didn't want to go, even if he needed to get ready for his new school since he was being accelerated into a higher year, he didn't want to leave John. John was his best friend, his ONLY friend. He didn't want to lose that. They played together every day that he was here, pirates hunting for treasure or scientists gathering specimens.
John was the one giving frustrated huffs now. "You two can stop dipping into Fae-speak, yeah? I feel like you're a pair of adults spelling things out so their kid won't understand. I'm grown, I can handle it." John scowled at the pair of them, and Moosecroft just chuckled, shaking his head.
"Some years, yes, it can snow quite a bit... I can show you trees to cut down like I said, and if you ever need anything during the winter months, I can try to find it for you. There's stocks of food Mrs. Hudson and I have gathered all around the wood." The fawn smiles slightly, flipping his hand palm up under John's. "Mrs. Hudson's always been the one to care for me I suppose. She's almost like my Maman, a part of my herd, one would say. " the Fae mused lightly. His tail thumped lightly against the soft grasses and quilts of his nest, he turned to gaze at John, "Do you have anyone John? A herd?" He asked softly. He pulled at his scarf once more, fingers stroking over the yarn.
Fawnlock blinked in slight shock as he watched his brother’s form exit the den, the young Fae's ears flicked and his tail twitched slightly as he straightened and started to pad after Moosecroft.
The familiar rumble started up quietly in Fawnlock's chest as John rubbed his knee under the table, the fawn blinked at his brother's words, head tilting slightly to the side as his ears flicked.
He bleated softly before his looked up at John, blushing softly, "Well, yes, other than nest making, and well, coupling. There's gift giving, customary nuzzles and scent sharing. I can teach you the proper ways too... Then there's... And then there's the-" Fawnlock trailed off as he silently peered back down at his dark hands on the quilt, the fabric bunching in his grip.
"Thanks, Sherlock." John says quietly to his friend and finally gives in and throws his arms around Sherlock's shoulders.
right? Wanting to be with someone but not knowing how they feel, yeah?" Greg looks at him with intense eyes.
As the first note sang through the den, John felt it reverberate down to his bones, hollowing through him. He was caught between closing his eyes and falling into the music, and keeping them open to watch his mate play. He settled for the latter for now, watching as long fingers cradled the instrument lovingly.
John pulled away, back to the closet to sort through the jumpers. He found one that'd always been a bit too long on him, a nice dark chocolate cable knit. He pulled it off the hanger and then searched around the room for his Aunt's sewing basket, pulling out the pair of scissors and snipping the collar open a bit.
"I'd like it all. I want to do everything with you. I want to experience it all." John smiled and ran his hands up along his mate's torso and shoulders, to cup his cheeks and rub over them with his thumbs, feeling his whole body hum with happiness. Why not add to it? "If you'd like...when the snow clears, we can clean out the cellar and set up a lab for you here at home? That way you can perform your experiments here too, so you don't have to go hoofing all over the woods. Would you like that?"
He took one of the wrapped up books and started to unwrap each book, "For a nest to have good structure, you need to start with a firm but still comfortable base, like comforters and thick quilts. Then you surround it with something like.. Hmmm, pillows and the. Bunched up.. Soft things.. Then you cover your base and pillows with lose blankets, quilts, sheets and more pillows." The fawn explained softly, stacking the books off to the side.
The fawn looked down at his feet for a moment, fingers going to tangle in the fringe of his scarf, the one John gave him.
John nods in agreement to his friend and puts the little creature back in the water. He watches as the little creature settles back into the water, starting at it for a few minutes before returning to Sherlock's side.
"Wow!" John clings to Sherlock as they observe the beehive in awe.  The sound of buzzing fills the room, the bees flying around in search of flowers to pollinate.  Of course, there are none, but that doesn't matter, the beekeeper takes good care of them.
Mycroft gives a tiny shake of the head. He suspected about their mother but... he really didn't want to concern Sherlock just yet. Not until he was certain. However, he is suspicious that their mother has begun to deteriorate because of her severe depression about their father's death.
Sherlock nods, "Maybe," he gives his brother a small smile and gets up, digging through his pack for his book. After finding it he curls up on his bed around the book, before plunging into the text to forget his own problems as he works out the story's plot within the first chapter.
John moved into the kitchen and set a kettle of water on to boil, preparing three cups for tea. While waiting for the water to heat, he moved over to slip into the seat beside his mate, reaching out and resting a hand on the fawn's knees, rubbing it with a gently soothing drag of his fingers. Watching the fae steeple his hands together in an endearing way, John couldn't help but smile before looking expectantly up at Moosecroft to begin.
Fawnlock bleated softly at the bare contact, his chest rumbling as he began to nose John's jaw once more, lips trailing sensitive skin. The fawn's dark hands tentatively roved his mate's now bare skin, a hand skimming the warm swell of the human's bum, fingers trailing light circles into his thighs and hips.
The fawn lent forward to press a kiss to the tip of John's nose in a usually rare (for the fawn) affectionate manner.
John goes to get more things for the couple's nest, and Fawnlock starts something he's determined to finish.
The taller boy rolls his eyes, whining softly, "I hate these essays out teacher makes us write, the topics are soooooo boring!" He flops down onto his bed, sprawled out across the bed cloth like as starfish, "Not to mention the fractions, so dull, I can do Mycroft's maths homework." He sputters out a sigh as he turns to look at his best friend, pouting at his amused expression.
Sherlock gives John a small smile, "I bet you'd make a great doctor or an astronaut, John." Sherlock shrugs, the subject changing didn't bother him at all, he changed subjects all the time because he was always jumping from one idea to the next in his head. "Is this where you're staying?" He asks, stopping and looking to John. Sherlock notices that John looks a bit down, he doesn't really know why, did he do something wrong? Did he somehow upset John? Sherlock sighs.
"Yeah sure...probably in my pack." He turned and reached for the bag, opening it up and rooting through it for his canteen. It was fairly empty from his hike yesterday morning, and he handed it over. He hesitated for a moment however, still holding the flask.
"/John is such an ordinary name for a man who must be extraordinary enough to catch your eye./" He commented softly, eyes flicking skyward to the moon.
Sherlock nods thoughtfully, eyeing the sprouting plant in John's hands. He shoulders his pack, "We'll have to find Mycroft and tell him," he grabs for John's free hand, humming softly.  As they exit the school building Sherlock spots his older brother, "Mycroft, I'm going to John's house tonight. We're going to work on our project."
John hummed and brought his mate down against his chest, nuzzling at his temple as a hand moved to gentle the edge of one ear which furiously flicked back and forth.
The Fae explained softly, ears twitching and tail flicking. He easily and gracefully moved over a fallen log, turning to offer John a hand after he was fully over. "Not many Fae stay near the gate during the daytime." He gave the human a soft smile, barely a quirk of the lips.
Sherlock groans and rolls over towards John. His eyes flutter open and he yawns softly, "Jawn?" He smiles a tad sleepily before, curling his fingers around Bilbo and clutching him closer to his little chest.
"I'll gather then for you while you finish those up so you have free hands. But first..." He took one of the berries and put it between his lips, then leaned in again and kissed Fawnlock so the berry squished between their lips, coating them in juice. With a soft laugh, he licked up the mess he'd made on the fawn's mouth.
John steps aside and pulls Sherlock up so he can look through. "It's amazing!" John leans against Sherlock as he looks through the telescope.
The Fae's tail swished as the fawn pulled up to meet gazes with John, a soft smile painting his plush Cupid bow lips, his inquisitive eyes drank in the sight of his mate's beautiful post-coital face.
Mycroft rolls his eyes and continues sipping his tea. He wonders why Sherlock did not tell mummy that he is being considered to skip a few grades.
The fawn looked back up as his mate spoke once more, pushing himself up and taking John's hand, "And I'll always fight for you, John, always, I'll never stop," their fingers intertwined as the fawn stood.
Sherlock watches John giggle with a smile, scooting closer. "John thank you for helping me," he carefully wraps an arm around John again, a lopsided grin on his face.
As the bushes close once more the fawn brushes his fingers over the willow trunks, humming softly as if in tune with the wood. He begins to pad back into the wood, snow crunching under his dark feet.
On their way to the door, the fawn padded into the kitchen to nuzzle at the feathers at the top of Mrs. Hudson's head, squeezing her shoulder lightly in farewell.
"Can I?" Once a nod is given to him, John scurries over and tries to reach up and climb into the tree, he falls just short of reaching the lower branch.
"It's so squishy... and clingy." He says, trying to pull his hand back, but the octopus just clings onto his hand more.
Greg smiles as his crush takes his turn to speak, oh what a lovely blush. He lifts a hand to gently cup Mycroft's cheek, thumb caressing his cheek bone. He feels the near sharpness of it... Mycroft seems to have slimmed down drastically since last year, Greg notes. Hmmm...
"Oh yes! I forgot something we can use to make the base. There's some sleeping bags down in the cellar...Harry and I used them when we visited in the spring to sleep out in the garden under the stars." He headed off to the kitchen, opening a slim door beside the pantry that lead down into a storage cellar. He dug out the sleeping bags and shook off the dust, then climbed back to join Fawnlock and held out the bright blue sleeping bag to him, because he knew, just knew the fawn would be delighted to find the scent of a very young John still preserved in its dense material.
Fawnlock was a comfort to John just by being there. No matter what his sister thought and how she acted, didn't matter, because he loved the fae. He'd call her when they returned to their cottage. Maybe she'd even want to talk to Fawnlock on the phone. That conversation would be....interesting to watch/ listen to.
"You are amazing and you are wonderful for this wood. It is flourishing and gorgeous and it's because you care so much for it." John leant in closer and wrapped his arms around the fawn's long neck, nuzzling against the soft ruff of fur around his neck.
John's gaze dropped to his mate's chest for a moment, but it seemed the fae was healing wonderfully. Making him rest for the day had done well, and John's attention and care seemed to be the best sort of medicine. At Fawnlock's request, John nodded, glad to make that very small sacrifice in light of what Fawnlock was going to do.
"I like your brother."  John admits, not at all bothered by how Sherlock is with Mycroft; if anything he is jealous of the relationship.  "Nothing like Harry..."
John closed his eyes as the fawn leaned into the hug and nuzzled him again. It was such a soothing, simple gesture, and yet, and comforting as it was, it was also thrilling. The buzz of new friendship and companionship shifted through him, right down to a tingle in his fingertips and toes. Finally they broke apart. and John let himself be lead to the sofa, slipping onto the cushions. Watching Fawnlock prepare his tea, he couldn't help but smile as the fae explained his new found love for tea thanks to John. He was glad to impart anything to such an exotic creature, even some as simple as they way he took his cuppa. John took his own biscuit and nibbled at it, watching the Fawn with a smile. "She said you have a sweet tooth. I had figured out as much. I'll have to hide my jam and sugar cubes the next time you come around."
After he finished his biscuits, the fawn pressed a warm kiss to his cheek and Scottie's forward to sip at his tea.
"Doesn't coral die if you touch it with your bare hands? " he asks, watching Sherlock pick up the coral.
"/Let's go meet your John then. Let me see what could be worth throwing away your crown./" He moved past his brother, ears flicking as he walked to the mouth of the den, glancing back over his shoulder.
She handed one to each brother, "For your dens, dears." She smiled softly, patting each brothers' chest before lifting her feathered hands to stroke each Fae's furred cheek, "/Moosecroft, you're always welcome to visit,/" Mrs. Hudson looked to John and Fawnlock, "/You too, as well, I expect it,/" she tittered softly before leading the King, Prince, and man to the front door.
"I don't see how he can ignore it. We're pretty good at advertising it." John hummed in content as the fawn nuzzled against him, just enjoying their time together now, lazy and happy, since he was quite sure it would be tense and uncomfortable once Moosecroft appeared. But Fawnlock was right. Everything would be alright. He was more than happy to lean back and suffer through the assault of kisses. Hands slid up to stroke his mate's sides in soothing patterns, reassuring him.
It was Fawnlock's "duty" as guardian of the ancient wood to protect all the creatures, supernatural, ordinary, big, small, dull, weak, dangerous, or moderately interesting, it didn't matter, he was in charge of their protection, and was to make sure there was balance. Despite his tendencies in being a more chaotic guard.
With everything set up on the counter, John went and retrieved the recipe card Mrs. Hudson had given him, and began chopping and measuring out everything according to her instructions. He seared the meat and sautéed the veg, then poured a generous amount of water into the pot with some herbs and spices, nothing too strong, keeping it nice and mild for the healing fae. Once the whole pot was set to boil and simmer, John cleaned the mess he'd made and washed his hands, wiping them on a tea towel and coming back to the nest with a satisfied smile.
"Greg." Mycroft's face flushes brilliantly, heart threatening to pound out of his chest.  He turns his face away, but his eyes stay focused on Greg, he allows a tiny smile to spread across his face. It is all he can manage anyway.
"Hey now...there's nothing to be embarrassed about. I want to know everything about you. That's how couples work. How mates work. I like the idea of everyone knowing you're mine, and them knowing I'm yours in return. Now that I know, I've leave the cleaning for later. It's something you like and you want." John pulled his mate in closer by the hip and slid his nose up Fawnlock's cheek.
John hummed and closed his eyes, nuzzling into the ruff of fur just under Fawnlock's ear. He was so soft and warm in John's arms, he never wanted to let the fawn go. This close, John could smell the tea and berries from earlier, as well as the fresh, earthy scent that was all Fawnlock. He grinned against the soft fur, rubbing his cheek slowly over the velvety texture. "I could never leave you for long. This is where I belong now. Where I've always belonged. I am yours and you are mine...I'm sorry I made you wait so long . But I was waiting for you too." He sighed against the fae's neck and held him tighter, fingers dragging slowly up along the fawn's spine.
Mycroft watches the boys and smiles, his pocket buzzing, he pulls it out and finds that Greg had texted him. A blush joins his smile.
"I sent the owl to Mrs. Hudson, now she'll be expecting us," he quirked a soft smile, "And know we've got an escort." He gestured to the small bird flapping before them, dipping slightly as it waited for the pair to follow.
"Oh God yes, please." John murmured, pressing his fingertips in against the fawn's tailbone and slowly massaging it a way that made his knees weak and loosened his grip of John's hips. He grinned up at Fawnlock, tilting his head and catching the underside of his mate's chin, pressing quick kisses against the soft skin above the scarf.
John closed the rest of the distance, bringing their noses pressing together. He rubbed his nose against Fawnlock's in a sort of nuzzle, echoing the smile with one of his own. "You found me. You leapt to protect me and you didn't even know my name." John slid his hands down and tugged lightly at Fawnlock's ears, rubbing the soft tufts between his fingers. "I think you deserve someone more than anyone. You are brave and selfless, and have given yourself to the well being of this wood. You're brilliant and wonderful."
The fawn offered a hand to his mate, and pulled him down to him once his hand was taken. The fawn snuggled up close to his mate, arms wrapped around one of John's.
He mostly liked living with only his brother and the house's staff, which was the butler/driver and a housekeeper who both cooked. But sometimes he missed the comfort of his mum, but Mycroft tried his hardest and he was grateful for that, he wasn't the little selfish brat everyone thought he was.
John took the canteen with a thank you and opened it up to take a long swallow of water. It was crystal clear, and refreshing, and he licked his lips and screwed the cap back on. He tucked the canteen back into his pack and pulled the whole thing onto his back, standing beside the fawn and brushing grass from his knees.
The fawn huffed softly, a small smile curving his lips, "I suppose there are recipes that are traditionally Fae in nature," mused the Fae as he nibbled at his chunk of bread, "and I could help you cook, I do have some favorites I liked when I was younger." He sipped at his soup, tail swishing from side to side as he wriggled closer to John.
Fawnlock padded over to the door and opened it, dropping John's hands so his mate could lock up the cottage if he wished.
One of the Fae's hands gently brushed over John's stomach, the other sliding up his back, fingers tapping his vertebrae lightly.
The fawn bleated softly, grinning wickedly. A shiver raced through his furred body as John's hands skimmed over his sides, and then another at his love's words.
Sherlock allows himself to be pulled to the T-Rex skeleton, "I admit it's impressive.." He frowns slightly, "But they were extremely flawed creatures, huge heads, tiny arms, small brains..."
"Mummy is doing a bit better, taking it day by day." Mrs. Holmes takes her tea and sips it lightly, the taste not even registering. "I am far more interested in what you boys have been up to." She looks between them with interested, even though she looks completely exhausted.
"There is a small pond with a softer bed further into the wood, if you'd like to take a dip later after we get breakfast and I show you the trees."
John stroked up the length of the fawn's back, then back down to curl over his tail, playing with the soft fur. He closed his eyes and listened to Fawnlock's story, brow furrowing in mild agitation as he spoke of the fight between the fae and the beast. John wished more than ever that he could have accompanied his mate and protected him like he'd promised. But he respected Fawnlock's need to perform his task alone.
Sherlock raises a brow at the high schooler, squeezing John's fingers, "You know my brother then?" He asks.
Pulling Fawnlock against him and making sure not to disrupt any of the bandages. Pressing a final kiss to his forehead, John snuggled against his mate and closed his eyes. He could feel sleep weigh down Sherlock as the tea and medicine and just exhaustion wore him down.
John gives a small smile and leans up to clasp hands with Sherlock, getting the boost he needs to get in the tree. Once on the lower branch, he straddles it, and grins at Sherlock, "Thanks, captain." He looks up, "How high can we go? "
They fluttered open once more and he bit his lip, and huffed, "Mousey was someone I considered a close acquaintance, maybe even a friend. She was useful during some of my experiments as an assistant, she had knowledge and skills I appreciated. Though I never told her such."
"I'm baking, so I'll be in the kitchen, make sure to say goodbye before you leave dear," she smiled softly and patted the fawn's back.
Another little nuzzle against the soft scarf, and John leaned back, fingers lingering as the base of Fawnlock's tail, scratching lazily at the softer tufts of fur.
Mycroft shifts in his seat and smiles, "What if we go to the Summer Home for a couple weeks when school lets out? I'm sure you can find a friend there to play with and maybe do your experiments with."
John beamed with the praise he was given, he was no chef by any means, but the simple things he cook make were good enough for Fawnlock it seemed.
"Mycroft, could John spend the night? And we could have a bonfire and roast marshmallows like that one time?" Sherlock peers up at his brother with hopeful eyes, he was late to go meet John down by the pools but wanted to get Mycroft's answer beforehand so they could plan more.
Mrs. Watson smiles and shakes her head. They are sweet, just so sweet, polite and endearing. The way Mycroft is with Sherlock, the way Sherlock just treats John like he's the most important and most perfect person in his life.
"I'm not worried about him. I know we love each other...that's all that matters." John smoothed out the scarf and then took the fawn's hand, threading their fingers together. "Together. Always together. Nothing and no one will ever come between us."
"It's obviously because I'm so charming." John teased, slipping his hand up along his mate's back and stroking the long lines with absolutely adoration.
The fawn's ears twitched at the sound of his mate outside the cottage, he looked up as John entered, he bleated softly at the sight of his mate, a smile on his face.
The fawn watched patiently as John cooked, admiring his mate's nude form as he worked, especially his bum when John was turned away.
Fawnlock’s damp ears twitch slightly as he answers, "There's no need for grass or any of that, you have plenty of things here, but I'd like my quilts and books." He bowed his head slightly, "Then my scent would be here too, our combined scents in the place we sleep would help seal our bond." Fawnlock gave a shy sort of smile, leaning forward slightly to rub his damp nose against John's.
"Captain!"  John ducks under his mother's arm and tackle hugs Sherlock.  He's in khaki trousers and wearing a light blue dress shirt, a brown tartan pattern sweater vest over it.
John took another bite of his sandwich and chewed thoughtfully, tapping his fingers against the fawn's knee before withdrawing his hand and licking a bit of breadcrumb from the corner of his mouth. "Well, I just planned on spending the day with you...if that's okay, of course." He gave Fawnlock a nervous smile, taking another quick bite and chewing , looking the fawn up and down before swallowing and speaking. "I don't want to wear out my welcome early, I'm just excited to know more about you."
John was panting just as hard when the kiss broke, gasping for a gulp of air as he tilted his head back against the mound of pillows and blankets. He licked his lips again and again, as if savoring the taste of the fawn's lips, the taste of the kiss.
Fawnlock hugged John back tightly, nuzzling his nose by John's ear, he snuffled softly, scenting his mate. His ears flicked and his tail swished in contentment, the Fae happy to have his mate back by his side.
John shifted up and moved closer to Fawnlock, reaching out and gathering him close so he was resting back against John's chest. He rested his head on his mate's shoulder to avoid the tall antlers, and kissed the curve of his shoulder, holding him gently and radiating love through their bond.
Sherlock chuckles and pads off to his closet. He carefully pulls something out. It's a box, obviously unopened. He shifts it onto its side, pushing it in front of John.
Sherlock hugs his friend tightly, "I'm going to miss you too!" He pulls back slightly, "I have something for you, John!" He takes something out of his pocket and drops it into John's hand, "To remember me, I read about stuff like it in a book Mycroft gave me," the small bronze anchor was on a leather strap so someone could tie it around their wrist, "There's a Jolly Roger carved onto it, so you can remember how we played pirates." The taller boy stared at his shoes as his cheeks flushed.
"Maybe we could move my books into your cottage for the winter," he huffed softly, snuffling slightly, "I like having a nest, and my violin..." He sighed softly. He pulled away slightly to lock gazes with John, "The veil should ice over in a week or two," he murmured softly, he lifted their intertwined hands to his mouth and brushed his lips over John's knuckles.
Sherlock, for once, is happy all day in school, as well as leaving it, nothing the other children seemed to say could bring him down, tomorrow he and his brother would be at the summer home, and he had good news for his brother.
Sherlock chuckles and scrubs his thumb over John's knuckles, in an affectionate manner, "Mycroft will be happy to see you, and you'll like Mary, our cook, she's nice and makes yummy biscuits."
The whole ride (of five minutes) he bounces excitedly and runs to the house when let out and rips through the halls excitedly.  He opens Sherlock's door a bit more quietly and peers inside where he sees his friend sleeping. Quietly he climbs onto the bed and lays next to Sherlock and pokes him. He spots his bee and smiles,
John wraps his arms around Winston's legs when he is retrieved.  He couldn't believe Sherlock returned so soon.
John didn't expect either brother to suddenly have patched things up after a single meeting. It wasn't the sort of thing you could just put a plaster on. But he knew his mate needed that connection with his brother. Family was important. John yearned for a connection with his sister as well, but they weren't at that point yet. She still preferred the bottle over her brother.
John shook his worries away and looked back down to the ball of warmth and fur and love curled in his lap. He smiled and kissed the top of Fawnlock's head.
"So... do..do you want to go exploring with me?" John blushes, glancing up at Sherlock. Sherlock made him nervous, he wasn't sure why...maybe it is because he hasn't had any friends for a long time?
There was a question in his bright eyes and he leaned slightly forward, lips brushing over John's flushed cheek, "Good?" He asked quietly.
The lips ghosting over his chest and stomach had John shivering, but it was the nuzzle to his crotch that really did him in, the knowledge that the fawn was scenting him in such an intimate place had his head spinning and a low moan rolling from his throat.
Fawnlock pouted slightly, "You play dirty, I'll play dirtier." He promised softly, his grin turned mischievous once more as his lips brushed the shell of John's ear.
Who would dare to hurt his brother? The poor thing, he hasn't got any friends, so why hurt him too? Isn't the emotional damage enough for those bullies?
Mycroft shakes his head slightly at the way the two boys behave with each other. If their conversation from earlier that he overheard. Those two will end up married. He just hopes John has the decency to ask for his brother's hand.
"Christ, yes. I concede. You win. You absolutely win." He somehow managed to get the words out, groaning as the wool jumper was pushed up out of the way and deft, dark fingers skimmed over his bare torso.
This creature was ancient and magnificent and had seen things John could only dream of. Yet here he was, tilting down to kiss and pet John, and making him feel like he was no older than a breathless teen, smitten by first love. John could only nod and watch as the fae padded off, straining to see the last flick of his white tail before the darkness consumed him.
John grinned under the rain of soft kisses, hands running up and down Fawnlock's sides, smoothing the wool jumper down. His fingers wound around, creeping to his back so his could tangle them through the soft downy fur of his tail.
"S-sorry Harry, you were off with the girls and well I ran into Sherlock, we got to playing and I lost track of time." John keeps his face down cast, eyes filled with a bit a fear. He didn't like upsetting his sister as he had to live with her and she sometimes looked out for him.
Afterwards John leaned back and pulled off his pack, then off came the coat and his jumper, set in the grass at his side. Bare chested to keep his clothes from getting soaked, John leaned in and swept up the cool water into his palms, pouring it over his head and rubbing it across his short hair and sun tanned face.
"There's one part of the wood go for Mrs. Hudson's wood, though she uses glamour to make the logs last longer, so she uses less; in there the trees aren't very suitable as homes. Well go there after." He waited for the human to shoulder his pack before he ducked out of his den, holding out a hand for the human that followed.
Though he admonished Fawnlock's rebuke at the offer, when his brother gave in with a reluctant huff, Moosecroft couldn't help but smile. That fuss was probably as good as he was going to get, and he dipped his head in acquiesce. Anderfawn was actually busy with a task the King had sent him upon. Employing glamour to disguise himself as he went to the human realm to broker peace with the local law enforcement in the small town a bit away from the forest. It was the same town John went to collect his supplies from, and though it was no major city, it was worth the chance to reach out to the world beyond. And now that his brother had formed a bond with a human, it was even more important to unite the two worlds.
"Thank you, John." The fawn mumbled softly, wrapping his arms around John and nuzzled into his neck, snuffling softly.
John hunted another handful, turning and pouring them into Fawnlock's hands. Both their fingers were getting stained from the juice.
"Do you want to go ask your sister if you can stay over?" With a sigh, John nods and begins heading to the place he is staying with his family.
"Oh.../Oh/." John breathed, eyes widening just slightly as the fawn explained the courtship unfolding between them. No, perhaps he hadn't understood completely, though he'd been hoping things had been taking that sort of turn. But with it spelled out so plainly, now he felt something like an idiot. Of course, Fawnlock had essentially let him into the fae's bedroom and they'd been rolling around together on his bed. Of course that's what was happening. John smiled and pulled Fawnlock close again, touching their noses together. "Yes, yes! I do, you wonderful creature! I'd want nothing more than to court you. I just wanted to make sure that was what you wanted as well." He reached up and rubbed Fawnlock's cheeks, then leaned in and gave him another kiss, humming happily against his lips. The fawn's ears perked once more, and he leaned into John. Dark palms and speckled fingers cupped the human's jaw lightly, brushing against the skin gently. Fawnlock gave a soft bleat and huff against John's lips.
"That's cool!" John says, looking at the coral with Sherlock. "What do you need all these specimens for anyway Sherlock?"
"Well...there's a ceremony....it differs depending on what sort of religion you follow. An exchange of vows and rings...they share names. And then there is usually a big party with lots of food and dancing. It’s a celebration...lots of fun for everyone. Then there's a honeymoon. The newly wedded couple goes on a vacation...and well... Consummates the marriage"
"Make sure to stay warm while I'm gone, I don't want you to be frozen when I come back." The fawn hummed, a slightly amused smile quirking his lips, "The wood for the fire is over there." He pointed before cuddling back up.
Sherlock snaps out of his gaze, blinking at John, "Uh, so take out?" He asks, taking John's hand, worrying his lip between his teeth once more. He squeezes John's fingers, pulling him towards the kitchen.
The fawn gave John a small smile and nuzzled against his cheek before holding the canteen tighter and standing. He stepped into the water and wadded to the middle of the creek, where he carefully knelt. He dipped the canteen beneath the surface and watched as bubbles surfaced. His tail flicked, splashing the water a bit as he started to hum softly.
"Yea..." John says sheepishly, still smiling. Mummy is the ONLY person allowed to call him that... except maybe Sherlock... Maybe.
The fawn snuggled closer, arms tightening around John, fingers stroking soft patterns into the small of John's back. His ears flicked, his damp nose brushing John's skin.
"I guess you could say it's like love... Though I've never really loved anything. To me it's always been an extension of myself. I feel it's pain, it feels mine, I doubt Mrs. Hudson hasn't told you of my moods, they affect the woods as they do me." The fawn sighs softly, nuzzling into the scarf once more, "At first, I saw my guardianship as an obligation, the wood a burden... My being was like the winter itself, cold, aloof, cruel, biting like the icy winds. But as it's magic and life seeped into my bones, I found myself unable to see it like that anymore... Just the thought of that icy cold I had become, made me feel sick to my stomach." The fawn huffed softly, ears twitching. "'Twas a lonely existence, as I've said. Mrs. Hudson and her owls revealed themselves soon after. She said the wood had always been her true home, despite her time with humans... I wasn't so lonely after that." His gaze moved to lock with John's, "And now, I'm even less so." He gave the human a slight smile.
Sherlock purses his lips slightly and rocks back onto his bum, "Hmm, maybe, but we're just kids... I don't know if there's much more we can do, we already hold hands all the time, we're always together, we share almost everything.." He steeples his fingers, tapping his indexes against his lips.
The fawn watched with twitching ears as John went to collect some biscuits and a cup of water and come back over. He tilted his head so John could wrap the scarf around his neck more easily, he gave John a bright smile, accepting the kiss happily.
"That was lovely," he compliments, blushing still... he may never stop, "tell me this is real Greg." He stares at the rugby player nervously.
Sherlock wraps an arm around John, letting him lean into him and cuddle close. He leans close, glad John trusted him to guide him but still worried. His eyes stay glued to the screen as he slips into his Mind Palace.
John's gaze slid over the fawn, watching his reaction. He seemed very pleased, from the noises he made, to the way his body swayed closer. John loosened his grip on the Fawn's hands, and reached up to his shoulders instead, leaning forwards the rest of the way to bring them close into an embrace. His arms slid around Fawnlock's back, squeezing lightly in a friendly hug. John just felt over whelmed with emotion; it may be completely fantastical, and maybe he'd wake up and this whole day would have been a dream. But for now, he was happy. "Thank you..." He said softly, just below the curve of that soft, velvety ear. For the first time in a long time, he didn't feel the shake in his hands or the ache in his leg. He was so very grateful for all of it.
"Yes, but the pieces of coral in these pools have been broken off from larger organisms out at sea. This is dead." Sherlock replies softly, examining the light purple coral, "I like this piece's color."
The past two weeks had been horrible, though his texts and syllabuses held some interest. He missed John, playing pirates, exploring the beach, the sleepovers... He felt miserable, not even Bilbo could comfort him, much less his brother or their butler. He barely ate, not having much of an appetite, much to Winston's dismay, he slept very little, much to Mycroft's (he'd have to deal with the grumpy seven-year-old). He sulked in his room/lab almost every day.
"Make sure to shake the spiders out love." He called, then turned to find the bits he'd packed for them to eat. He could heat the thermos in the fire, and pour the stew into mugs that they could sip out of.
"No, it doesn't seem like art... I drew a pineapple when I was three."  John giggles and sees the sign for the Geology exhibit.  "Oh! Fossils! Come on Captain!"  John continues pulling his best friend along by their near fused hands.
"We're doing this one." He smiles, giving Mycroft the booklet and picking up a piece, sliding it into place.
John could feel that the fawn was settling on top of him, his muscles relaxing and his nose snuffling about to find the most comfortably spot to lay his head. He realized the fae was readying for sleep, which made sense, as they were both exhausted. They were sticky and dirty, but it didn't seem to bother Fawnlock in the least little bit. And really, John was too happy to care much himself. He supposed they could take a shower or bath in the early morning, which he'd have to introduce the fawn to, but the warm water would surely thrill Fawnlock.
John lifted his hand from the blanket and took Fawnlock's, squeezing it gently and kissing his temple, just below his curls.
"Hurry up, Mycroft!" Sherlock tugs slightly on his big brother's hand before releasing it kindly as he and John start running up the museums massive set of stairs at its front.
John blinked in surprise at Fawnlock's sudden excitement, which God, was absolutely adorable how he stuttered when he was so thrilled. John's mouth gaped, but as his mate's words caught up with him, he couldn't be anything but shocked. John tried to remember just what part he'd said in Fawnlock's tongue as the fae rubbed up against him. Through the confusion, he felt his heart swell with happiness to please the fawn so much, as was his want to do.
Biscuits sounded lovely to him, he could hardly blame Fawnlock's love for them. Besides, she made hers with jam, so naturally John was in love with them himself. He looked on as they spoke in that wonderful foreign tongue, but when they switched back to English which was surely for his benefit, his smile fell softer.
"You'll always be safe with me." John murmured, moving his hands through the water to move up Fawnlock's thighs, tracing them to his hips and back around towards the base of his tail.
The Fae pulled away once more, eyes a bit brighter, "I'll go to him tonight after the witching hour, invite him to the wood to meet you." He gave a soft smile before his brows furrowed once more, "But I'd like you to stay with Mrs. Hudson while I'm gone, it won't be all too safe with me gone and who knows what could take advantage of that." The Fae huffed softly, rubbing his nose against John's.
He closed the space between them and pressed a kiss to the fawn's mouth, fingers stroking down the soft fur of his cheeks. Lips lingering, it took a while before he leaned back, tongue darting between his lips. "When would you like the ceremony? Spring? When all the flowers will be blooming bright, and the gates will be open and the weather warm? It will give me time to get you a ring...to get word to Harry..."
John yawned and rubbed his face, climbing to his feet, a bit wobbly before heading to the kitchen. He saw the damp rag and could figure out what it was used for, and decided he might and well clean himself up as well. Rubbing off the dried patched on his stomach and shoulder, he then wrung out the rag and tossed it into a basket of dirty laundry by the back door to be washed later. He wondered briefly about getting dressed into some pajamas, but had the odd feeling Fawnlock would huff in protest had that been the case. He settled for wrapping a blanket from their nest around him and padding over to the burning embers of the fire, prodding at it with a poker till it stoked up once more, filling the room with warmth.
"Alright, Winston and I will be around with the car at quarter after ten.  Please be careful. I love you Sherlock.”
The Fae ground down against John once more, panting softly, ears flicking as he tugged on John's jeans. The fawn fumbled with John's button and flies, grumbling softly as his fingers didn't seem to cooperate with his brain. Fawnlock let out a bleat of frustration as he pulled away from their kiss and fumbled with John's button, after a few seconds of not progress the Fae pouted up at his mate.
Sherlock happily scoots close to John to cuddle and read. Though his head snaps towards Mycroft as he speaks with Mrs. Watson about the rugby player who'd helped him and John.
Moosecroft tilted his head and considered Ms. Hooper. She'd been infatuated with Fawnlock, following him even to his wood. Until he had scared her off. She was so very shy and timid, as most of her type of fae was. She'd dabbled in the arts in hopes of taking care of the Prince, even though it was apparent he was not interested in that sort of relationship. He gave his brother a lazy blink and then looked down at John, who was watching the exchange with interest.
He knew he could absurd sometimes, asking John to grab something that was in his pocket for him or a pencil that's just fallen by his foot but he didn't want to get himself.
"There isn't a moment I want to be away from you. You're my life now. Without you, it's not complete." He leaned up and kissed the fawn's cheek, still holding his hands tightly. "You'll have to tell me what I can do to make it more comfortable for you."
As the fae wriggled and squirmed, it only spiked up John's heartbeat, and when he managed to turn around and smirked in victory, John folded down and caught his mouth in a kiss until the wry twist of Fawnlock's mouth had melted away beneath the persistent press. It was completely unfair in the rules of pillow fighting, but John wasn't above such underhanded tactics to win.
John is practically bursting with excitement now. He made a friend! This is the best day of his summer, "Yeah!" John exclaims. He grabs Sherlock's hand again and begins pulling the boy toward the direction he came, intent on showing him the rocks and pools he found before.
“What have you been up to?” Mike asked. “Last I heard you were going off to the Middle East, hoping not to get shot.”
With a guttural cry, Sherlock shot his seed into the damp grass. John’s hips shot forward, knocking the omega into his own spent seed, as his knot began to swell. The Alpha forced it past the swollen rim of the omega’s entrance. Growling in pleasure, as his knot continued to grow.
“The kids who went missing daddy,” Rosie looked at her dad like he was silly. “You remember, stranger danger and not talking to strangers.”
John was sucked in immediately. He tried to be a bit skeptical, but within the first thirty seconds he was hooked. A buttery baritone voice, melodic in it's disdain for stupidity, narrated a ghost story. When the listener was ready to scream in anticipation, sure that this was a real paranormal encounter, Sherlock Holmes in great scientific detail tore it apart. Dissecting the hows and whys methodically. His posh voice doing nothing to curb his bloodthirsty enthusiasm for solving the mystery.
It had been Luther himself who had broached the topic with John. Two months into their friendship, he had sat John and just spat it out. He would love to come to spend more time with Rosie, and he needed somebody to focus on. John had understood without needing it spelled out. He could remember sitting in his bedsit after he had gotten home. No focus, no drive. He had been a god damn zombie until he had met Mary.  He wouldn't wish that on anybody.
“I suppose it’s good to know that you don’t have a pack of unclaimed pups running around three continents,” Sherlock shot back, picking up his tooth brush. He grimaced as the bristles of the implement tickled the roof of his mouth. The morning sickness, which had lingered for far longer than he liked, had been replaced with an unbearably sensitive gag reflex. Pregnancy was intolerable.
Mycroft’s car pulled up to the curb, just as Sherlock and John stepped outside. The man was seriously a miracle worker. If John liked him just a smidge more, he might have kissed the surly man.
“Since when do you giving a shite about convention Sherlock?” John laughed. “You never did before, don’t start now.”
“I have a proposition for you,” the man walked towards John. “You keep me updated on Sherlock’s condition, and I’ll make sure you are richly compensated for your time and trouble.”
“I worry about Sherlock, immensely,” the balding man continued blithely. “Imagine my shock when I found out he was pregnant.”
John did not bother asking his flat mate if he wanted a cup of tea. Rather he simply made him one, doctored up with a splash of milk and a bit of sugar. The doctor juggled the two cups, and walked into the living room.
Sherlock glanced at Dr Watson-John, briefly. “That really depends on your Daddy, but I am interested in learning about the stories that happened here.”
“I think my fucking house is haunted,” John muttered angrily. “The weirdest shit has been happening.”
“Shut up,” Sherlock muttered, before struggling to stand up. “We should head back. I can’t believe we left Mycroft unattended, he probably has the whole flat bugged now.”
The pack was antsy. It was the first full moon that they would be running with John and vice versa. The dynamic was drastically different from what any of them were used to. John was used to running with alphas and the occasional beta that made it into the army. This was a pack of three betas that occasionally ran with a rogue omega.
The force of the rage suggested that yes, they really were. Sherlock did not know why or how, but that anger was building.
Sherlock remained silent as he watched John fall asleep sitting up. His feet tucked under Sherlock's thigh, like a child seeking warmth. This man was adorable. He grabbed the red and black tartan blanket that was on the back of the sofa, and tucked it around the sleeping man. It took more effort to walk away than he would like to admit.
“Sherlock, whether or not you want to accept it, you will be bringing a life into this world in less than seven months.” Mycroft looked concerned for the first time. “You are going to have to plan ahead for once in your life.”
John had put Sherlock in the cottage's green room. It was the only guest room the cottage had, so he wasn't sure why they differentiated between it and the other rooms. But they always had. Or so John had explained as he shown Sherlock where it was. He had no bags to put away, so he had not lingered long. Only long enough to note that there were no flowers on the walls or anywhere else, which Sherlock deeply appreciated. After dinner, Rosie and Dodger had helped John with the clean up of dishes. Sherlock had tried to help, but had simply gotten underfoot. Which Rosie had seemed to find hilarious.
But the look in her eyes told him the truth. She couldn't see. Mary had left that night, back to London. John had not argued with her. Hell, he had helped her pack, though he had refused to put Rosie down.
“Sherlock and your daughter are fine John,” the doctor answered. “Your mate is stubborn, he refused the services of an anesthesiologist, claiming he needed to be awake for his research. He did accept an epidural however.”
Mrs Hudson had not had to wait long for a response. The next morning Sherlock Holmes had shown up at 221 Baker Street. Martha had opened the door, still dressed in her dressing gown, ready to blister whoever it was disturbing her sleep. What she found on her stoop was a tall, slender man with a long coat, who looked debonair and haughty. Martha drew herself up straighter in response, she opened her mouth to say something, only to be overrun.
John snorted, as he turned to get the supplies to make hot chocolate for Rosie and tea for them. “What stories do you think my five year old can tell you?”
“Daddy there's a glass broken on the floor,” Rosie was at the door, a squirming Dodger in her skinny arms. John abruptly remembered the sound of glass breaking and giggling abruptly cut off. He cursed lightly under his breath before brushing past Sherlock.
They all sat down at a long table, that was well weathered. “Sorry,” John muttered, looking slightly embarrassed. “We do everything at this table. We eat here, do arts and crafts. First aid. This table sees it all.”
It had taken time for John to find a caretaker for his girl. There had been days that he had to take her to the practice with him. She had thrived under the attention of both patients and the administrative assistants who had coo'd and baby talked her. John himself was not a baby talker. He preferred to talk to Rosie like she was a tiny adult, and he thought she appreciated it more as well.
Pregnancy had obviously addled his brain. He was at his bi-weekly check up at the hospital, and even his bare arse on a cold examine table did not make him cranky. Which was a first. John had been called away for an emergency at the clinic, so nobody would appreciate his snark anyway.
“On what?” John and Sherlock asked as one. They glanced at each other, before focusing on the small woman.
John sank down into his armchair. Not for the first time, Sherlock wished he had chosen to sit closer. Close enough to touch. It was a side effect that Sherlock had not been aware of, before this little mishap.
Rosie came running into the dining room, her face red with cold and her eyes bright with excitement. “Daddy daddy! Dodger is going crazy. I think he found something!”
The need to be out of the flat, doing something, anything had forced Sherlock into the clearing. Running with the pack on a full moon during pregnancy wasn’t unheard of. However, it was not fully embraced by those of the medical field. John had supported his decision in his understated way. Oddly enough, Sherlock appreciated that, which he didn’t understand fully. Never before had he sought somebody’s endorsement. He craved John’s approval, almost as much as rose petal tea and spicy pork dumplings, maybe more. Sherlock blamed it on the hormones. Or maybe it was the gas that he couldn’t seem to escape. Whatever it was, it was boring.
Just as John was approaching the front door, a slender whirlwind burst out of it. A long, dark coat swirled around trouser clad legs. Chaotic curls and pale skin. And that scent. John knew that scent, intimately. Though it had changed somehow in the past month. Before it had been cool, crisp like an autumn day in the park. Now it was warm, almost drugging. Cinnamon buns being cooked from scratch. Warm, yeasty. Sweet. John’s.
John cleared his throat, and refused to look at Sherlock. He glanced out the darkening window. “Where are you staying while you are in Wales?” he asked.
John cleared his throat from beside him. “Meat pasties for your tasting pleasure,” he called out mock formal to his daughter. Rosie yelled in delight, inspiring Dodger to howl a little stuttering bark, that was ridiculously adorable.
“I don’t want to move,” Sherlock threw out suddenly. “I like living in London, I like 221 B. Baker Street.”
“Don’t bother asking Mycroft if he wants some, he is on his way out,” Sherlock mocked. “He has places to be and diets to fail.”
One person had seen Joey Simpson, the youngest girl, on the night she disappeared. She had been dressed in a light blue dress, walking in sheets of rain in late August. When the driver had pulled over to offer her a ride home, she had run away like the very devil was after her. That driver, who the article did not mention the name of, had driven straight home to call the police.
The pack skidded to a stop just inside the clearing. Yet John could not be bothered to look away. Everything that was important was right here. His cock and Sherlock’s clenching arse cradling him.
Sherlock did not go limp, as any other wolf would have done under an alpha. Rather those intriguing eyes bore into John’s, confusing the wolf’s senses. With a reluctant growl John stood, Sherlock prone under his legs. John howled urging the pack on to the hunt.
John’s alpha instincts were in full gear. He couldn’t touch Sherlock like he wanted. He couldn’t touch the bump. But he could feed his mate, and provide proper nourishment for his unborn pup. And maybe, just maybe Sherlock would let him touch him sometime in the next decade. Or before their bump would be heading off to university.
“Unless you have something moderately intelligent to say, Anderson, please refrain from lowering the I.Q of the entire street.” Sherlock snapped, as he tried to focus on the mutilated body in front of him.
“Want to go for a walk?” John tried again, his hand rubbing small circles along the small of Sherlock’s back.
“I must say, if this is how you go about flat sharing,” Sherlock began without looking at John. “I can see why you have flat mate issues.”
Now the only thing he had to worry about was hiding the bump from the peons at Scotland Yard. Though, Lestrade and his lackeys were idiots. It shouldn’t be hard.
John couldn’t help but imagine it in a different context. Sherlock on his hands and knees, on his back, riding his dick. Any way John could get him. He wanted him in every way possible. John hadn’t been this eager for sex, since he was a virgin, desperate for his first knot.
John enjoyed watching Sherlock work his magic. Except for the fine tremors that wracked his hands and the tight lines around his eyes that belied his nerves. John knew that he was the only one who noticed. Then again, he had made observing Sherlock his sole hobby since their first meeting. The one thing John had learned in the past several months, Sherlock did not like having his condition shoved in his face.
The consulting detective could not deduce his flat mate. Days before he had been on the sofa, mindless with pleasure, moaning like a bitch in heat and John had done nothing. Sherlock was not sure whom he was the most disgusted with. Himself for acting like a typical omega; or John for not claiming him like a proper alpha.
John laughed shortly, more out of shock that anything. All this time he had thought Rosie was not being affected by the weird shit that was happening in the cottage. It turns out she was in the middle of it all. Hell, she probably knew more about what was going on than he did.
While John had touched the bump frequently, caressing and whispering sweet mumblings, Sherlock had gone out of his way not to touch it directly. With hesitant hands he quickly pulled his shirt out from his trousers. Carefully, he had to be careful; the omega touched the thin skin of his belly. He couldn’t really feel much, so he pressed down slightly harder. It was only practice at being composed at all times, that made it possible for Sherlock not to jump when something kicked his hand.
John felt an overwhelming sense of rightness, as he looked down at his mate. Sherlock’s riot of dark curls on John’s pillow, his scent mingling with John’s. It was like coming home. He knew Sherlock was impatient to get on with it. His hips rose and fell like waves crashing on a beach, yet John took his time to worship the body beneath him. He had to memorize it all.
After a rather quiet and awkward dinner, Sherlock sits comfortably in his mother's lap, his book in his lap, by the window that gives a nice view of the sunset. Which she stares out at quietly.
"We are definitely a pair..." John murmured fondly as she scampered off, feeling his cheeks heat up. When she returned with the jumper, his smile widened and he accepted it, holding it tight to his chest.
Fawnlock's tail swished as he chuckled softly at John's question. The fawn's fingers curled tighter into John's jumper as his ears twitched.
The elder Fae took the thermos with a grin and a twinkle in her eye, "You're Welcome, it was his favorite as a wee little fawn." She chuckled softly and turned to open the door, "And thank you for the extras, now please do come in," she waved a hand and Fawnlock ushered John inside, rolling his eyes and huffing loudly at the pair's chit chat.
"I won’t be gone too long.. A few hours at most. Stay hydrated, drink the water...you lost quite a bit of blood last night." He cupped the fae's cheeks, rubbing his thumbs over the thin, velvety fur as he stared down at him with complete adoration. "I love you." Fawnlock pecked John on the lips as he pulled away a bit.
Moosecroft himself stood at the entrance of the den, his head held high and haughty and he regarded his sibling. They were similar in several aspects, the light brown hue of their fur, and the dapples darker spots along their bodies. The similarities ended there, with Moosecroft's ruff and hair a dark ginger, and his large sweeping antlers wider and flat before they broke off into points. He didn't sport the wild curls of his brother, now the piercing silvery eyes. He wore a thick cloak that was lined with a downy fur, its woven threads glittering in the fire light as it dragged down across the dusty floor of the den.
His fingers traced up his fragile antlers, he hummed softly, "These should drop after the new year." His speckled fingertips tapped along the brittle branches of bone, "They've pretty much hardened fully.."
Sherlock's a light sleeper, so when he hears a soft whimpering, his eyes flicker open. The fort's lit by the hazy blue light of John's torch. Sherlock sits up, rubbing his eyes, "John?" He spots his friend's tears, "What's wrong?" He scoots closer to his friend.
John giggles upon seeing Bilbo and then cuddles into Sherlock, opening his new book to start reading it with his best friend.
Mentions of the wargs brought him back to the first day they'd met, when neither of them had known each other, yet still Fawnlock had protected him, defended him. Loved him. Because it was only pure, selfless love that made you leap out to protect a stranger. John wiggled closer, pressing his smaller body under the fawn's arm.
As Fawnlock slid his arm around John, he nuzzled closer to the tall fae. He loved the feeling of being completely wrapped in someone else. There was no push or pull in their relationship, no one was in charge, (despite Fawnlock being adorable bossy) despite their differences, they were equals. John could snuggle up against his mate and didn't feel any less of a man for it. He just felt loved.
John paused beside his mate, and prepared for the oncoming sneeze in response to Fawnlock's magic, but for once, he was blissfully blank. He raised his hands up and rubbed at his nose just to be sure, then grinned over at Fawnlock when he returned. "I didn't sneeze this time!" He said excitedly, taking up his mate's hand in his now that the biscuits had been hastily consumed. Having Fawnlock tucked up against his side was wonderful, and John felt complete with him there.
Sherlock narrows his gaze at Harry after watching John visibly grow smaller under her gaze. He deduces several things on the spot but keeps his lips pursed as he gives her a glare. I don't like her, he concludes.
Mycroft makes a soft noise, slipping closer to Greg, placing a hand on his shoulder and grips the material of his letterman jacket. This kiss is slow and sweet, it causes a slight stir in his pants. Not yet enough to get him fully aroused, Greg certain has his attention.
Sherlock takes the small mouse as he's offered, and moves to the mouse's box, carefully setting him back inside so John and he can put up the cage.
At ten pm this is what Mr. Watson comes home to with a smile. Harriet had been apprehended by the Scotland Yard per her instruction to get sober and learn some tough love.  She'd threatened her with this last time and being a good parent, she followed through.
It's been building up to this, they've know each other for a short time, but it's now time for John to teach Fawnlock something new.
Despite all his hardships, the fawn had turned out wonderfully, brilliant and sweet, and so loving. John leaned his head against his taller mate's shoulder, watching as he turned the pages and admired the portraits.
The little blond boy smiles at his reflection in the water. Suddenly there is another imagine beside his and he turns around. "Sherlock!" He greets enthusiastically.
John doubted the fawn was shallow enough to leave him for a nicer nest mate, he'd only been teasing. But it was nice to hear it.
"I'm happy too, if anyone cares to know." John said mildly, a smile on his face as he slid back into his seat and sipped his tea.
"That's because I have the most wonderful, deserving mate in the history of mates. I'd do anything for you, you know."
As he was pulled back, dark blue eyes stared up at Fawnlock, John's fingers lightly brushing against his mate's stomach, smoothing over the soft fur of his underbelly.
Sherlock doesn't know what leads him to it, being polite for Mycroft's sake, his loneliness, or his curiosity; but Sherlock shrugs slightly, "I don't see why not, I could use help collecting samples anyway... Could you help with that if I explore with you?" He asks the other boy, gaze narrowed slightly.
It was exciting to think he'd get to visit places that were special to the fae. "The gate is an actual ...gate? A place? I thought it'd be more of a metaphorical thing." John asked the fawn quietly.
He ran his fingers through the fluff, feeling the fawn's hands slip through his short hair in an echo of the sensation. Unable to resist the smile on those perfect lips, he leaned down for another kiss, tracing the outline of Fawnlock's mouth with a flick of his tongue.
"I'm so excited!"  John exclaims once inside the lobby, waiting to pay the entrance fee. He is bouncing where he stands, still clutching Sherlock's hand.  "Oh, I bet they have an insect exhibit and one for dinosaurs and I really want to see the Tyrannosaurus-Rex Skeleton." John goes on about what else he wants to see, so thrilled about nearly everything in the museum.
The young Fae braced his elbows on the tabletop, pressing his palms together in a prayer-like fashion, silvery gaze locked on his brother's own pale one.
"He is a troublemaker, but he is very bright." Mycroft smiles, he is so proud of him - always. "I'd do anything for him, I love him dearly."
"I've got it."  He takes Sherlock's hand instead and walks to the kitchen where there is an island with chairs surrounding it.  He places the takeaway bag on the table and then goes to fetch the tableware.
John closed his eyes with the soft, slow nuzzles and just let himself sink into the feeling of being adored. Of being a home for someone. "I suppose I can share you with the forest a bit longer." John murmured, then turned his head and kisses the tip of that damp nose, watching it wriggle in response with a warm smile.
"Oh," Mrs.Holmes snaps out it, tilting her head to smile at Sherlock, "Are you done, dear?" Sherlock huffs internally and slips off his mother's lap.
Fawnlock had felt John's thoughts and worries through their bond, he pouted slightly. Dark palms moved over his mate's jumper, fingers curled into the knitted weave, pulling John closer into a warm embrace. Fawnlock breathed in his mate's scent, eyes fluttering closed as he tried to comfort his mate. Soon, the young Fae sighed softly and tucked his chin against John's shoulder, careful of his antlers, before his eyes flickered open once more. The fawn nuzzled at John's neck, the rumbling strengthening as he stayed cuddled close to his mate.
"Yes, yes boys.  Would you like to take my car or shall we go in yours- if you have one?"  Mrs. Watson asks as they exit the door of their apartment and she locks it behind her. She looks down at the two young boys holding hands and smiles, a bit curious, mostly happy her son is happy.  She turns to Mycroft for the answer to her question.
John was watching Fawnlock's face nervously as his mate inspected the nest he'd built. He hadn't had much to go on besides making it comfortable, and hurrying, because anytime spent away from the fae was like ripping off a limb. As horrid as a job as it’d been, the fawn seemed happy with it, if his kiss was to be any indication.
He sighed happily, nosing against Fawnlock's ear and whispering softly to him. "I know it’s only been a few days, but I've never been happier in my entire life, then the time I've spent with you." He leaned back enough to stare into those pale, beautiful eyes and smiled softly. "I love you Fawnlock. With every bit of my heart."
"If you are agreeable, I could have one of the court healers come teach you the healing arts. I understand the magical aspects may be beyond your grasp, but having a more intimate knowledge of the herbs and fauna used in the processes will surely supplement your knowledge. It can only be a benefit when living with my brother."
The rumble in Fawnlock's chest had quieted throughout the night, was a soft hum like sound. But as John stroked his face with gentle fingertips, the rumble grew in volume, the fawn's nose scrunching slightly in pleasure as he slept. Soon the gentle touches woke the Fae, and he snuggled closer, tail swishing as his eyes fluttered open.
There wasn't a touch that the fawn could give that John didn't like. But still John tensed under the harder nips of blunted teeth, gasping and tilting his head back against the mounds of pillows and blankets in their nest. Fawnlock seemed fairly obsessed with his neck, which John could only encourage because it certainly was one of his most erogenous zones. John rolled onto his back and pulled Fawnlock with him, pressing a thigh up between the fawn's legs so they slotted closer together.
He murmured with a soft smile, still nosing against John's palm, lifting his own hand to cup the human's cheek, thump gently sliding over a trail of soft blush. The fawn's ears flicked as a deep rumpling started up, the Fae brushing his lips over John's wrist. John's coat slid of his shoulders as he scooted closer, his hand slipping up to John's hip.
John turned and reached up to touch Fawnlock's cheek, gently stroking his face and the fluff at the base of his ear.
John hummed happily as the fingers splayed over his back, his own hand returning the favor by stroking across the fawn's scalp, curving around his ear and scratching gently. The fawn hummed softly as John ran his fingers through his curls, leaning into his hands as he scratched behind his ear.
John could feel as the fae began to tense up, and reached down to grip his firm backside, rubbing the sleek curve of muscle and encouraging him to buck forwards all he wanted to, to bring forth his release and the euphoria that followed.
"Interesting," the fawn muttered as he rubbed his cheek against John's shoulder briefly before pressing a kiss to the fabric covering it, "You've got to work on pronunciation and your accent, so it's alright."
He opens the door, gesturing Mycroft inside, "Nothing fancy, just two bedrooms, an eat in kitchen, sitting room, and a loo." He gives a slightly shy smile. He steps insides after Mycroft, toeing off his chucks, "Your shoes if you could." He mutters softly.
"I don't suppose the years of training it would take to become an Astronaut would be worth it, do you?"  John hardly waits for an answer, moving on, past the facts and real rocket fragments and meteors and projections of the galaxy.
John pads to Sherlock's room, his feet bare, looking around the house in awe. Sherlock dumps out his bag and smiles at John, "thank you for helping me collect samples." He sorts out what he's found and takes care of what he's got going already, John smiles at Sherlock.
The Fawn's ears flicked as he carefully tipped his head away from the human, his antlers were sharp and dangerous. He nodded as the human spoke, his gaze falling to what he was doing, going completely focused on the human's hand, yet still aware of what was going on around them. He hissed softly at the stinging liquid and bit his lip, he watched as the human rubbed some ointment into his skin. He nodded as the human spoke, "I'm supposed to do that," he muttered, bowing his head slightly, "Protect the creatures of the Wood, keep balance." He mimicked his elder brother.
The Fae hissed at the bird as it made several soft sounds, the bird lowered its head and the fawn gave a firm nod. The bird lifted its head and screeched, causing several other large raptors to reveal themselves on bare branches around.
After a moment of silence, the young Fea spoke, "Of course brother, you're always welcome in our den, let us leave."
"Thanks, Mycroft!" John smiles again, setting his bag on the floor of the limo. "Whats for dinner?" Mycroft laughs, one track mind, just like Sherlock.
Sherlock looks down at his lap, a light blush dusting his cheeks, "His name's John. He likes playing pirates with me, and he likes helping me collect samples." A small smile graces his lips as he says this, "And he's a great friend."
"/This...fool hardly dalliance you've taken part in is no doubt due to the taboo nature of choosing a human. You wish for him to be a mate, yet by the very definition of the word, he never can be. Not only is this creature not a Fae, but he is male and human. You will never be able to create a litter with him and continue our line. At best, you should take him as a concubine and nothing more./" He pulled back with a look of pure disinterest on his face. "/You shouldn't get so attached to your play things. Eventually he'll break, and you'll have wasted your only bond on a creature who has already lived through half of his lifespan at best./"
Another cloth is grabbed for Mycroft and he wipes away the sweat and dirt from the day's stresses. Afterward, he feels much more refreshed.
He did close his eyes, if only for a moment, to bask in the feeling that radiated from the gate, and the closeness of the fawn at his side. "Mmm...I'd like that. Make a big batch to get me through the winter." John whispered, a lazy, sleepy sort of lull to his voice. He curled on his side a bit so he could look up at Fawnlock, head propped on his arm. "Tell me more about these woods. That animal that attacked before...I've never seen anything like it. Are there other animals in this wood that don't live anywhere else in the world?"
The fawn's ears dropped a bit sheepishly, as he took another bite if his biscuit. His tail flicked and he leaned back on the sofa, "Well, I've always liked sweet stuff, since I was little." He sighs softly and Mrs. Hudson, who came into the room during his explantation, gave a gentle smile. "When he was little he was always trying to get honey from beehives, always getting stuck up in trees or stung." The fawn's ears dropped as the Fea teased him lightly, "I didn't know better," he mumbled, she chuckled and moved to ruffle his curls, careful of his antlers, "Oh, you didn't, then you continued just to torture your brother." Fawnlock smirked softly, turning to John with a slight shrug. "I'm still in the business of being the bane of my brother's existence." Mrs. Hudson shook her head before moving back to the kitchen, "I can make you boys some sandwiches, it's been a long morning, so if you're hungry?"
“Ladybird is all I have...don’t worry, it’s a good look. Think it may even rival the deerstalker. Now give me that,” John gestured to the handkerchief and Sherlock passed it to him.
“Don’t be angry with me,” Sherlock said, lowering the handkerchief to reveal a smattering of angry looking gashes across his cheek.
John dropped the handkerchief beside them and pointed to the box of butterfly stitches, before reaching for the wipes and tearing one open.
“I’m just saying, if you thought you needed to be out of the way for me and Rosie to have some daddy-daughter time, then that’s not the...err...case. In fact, I could really do with a hand. And there’s no one I would want more than you...to help with bedtime...to help with Rosie’s bedtime.”
John looked up, a loud sigh escaping him before he downed the rest of his brandy and put his tumbler down at his side. “Dare I ask? Auditioning for a part in the Phantom of the Opera?”
In the firelight the darker-haired man looked tired, the flickering shadows casting darkness in the hollows of his cheeks and under his eyes. John noted that there were a few more lines around his eyes than when they had last been this close to notice, there were also a few more nicks and scars dotted here and there.
The solitude that lay in the wake of the two sibling visits was a lot less charged than it had been a few hours previous. The background rhythm of monitors beeping sounded less like a timer ticking down.
Then as if this confirmed her worst fears and this wasn't just some sick joke, her head snapped back to Sherlock and she stared at him with the same eyes as John's.
Sherlock’s were as catlike as ever, even more so between the hours of 7pm and 6am when the volume of the house was dictated by a slumbering two-year-old.
“I says to John, why didn't they let you keep it, split the money two ways and you could be living somewhere nice and cosy, have an office too, proper official.
A warm, solid weight on his shoulder, indicated the arrival of his brother; the clip of a metal umbrella nib hitting the tiled floor confirmed it.
The same stood now; a light source at another angle had been cast. Here was a John who had not only thrown himself in front of a knife for Sherlock but had been resurrected and then had the audacity to ask if Sherlock was okay.
In two quick strides he had crossed over to the head of the bed and crouched down, his eyes not leaving John's bewildered face.
Harry stayed a little longer, hovering at the bed, unsure where to put herself but not wanting to sit back down again.
He got to his feet, and when Sherlock didn’t reply he added: “I’ll get you something for the headache,” and left.
Sherlock had refrained from touching him. He was unable to recall a single time he had ever wanted to touch someone with the intensity that he felt now, but he couldn’t.
The scar was larger than he had expected, no-doubt interrupted in its healing process by a makeshift patch-up job on a battlefield and the heat of severe infection. The result was a web of pink-to-white lines, thick like veins, puckered with the effort of holding everything together.
But Sherlock didn’t argue, instead he ran his finger across the foreign object holding his hair in place and smiled slightly.
Sherlock could have said an endless array of things and they’d all have been true - a cup of tea, a cigarette, a hug, a fix.
The crackle of fire began to die away as its yellow blaze simmered to an orange glow, leaving little more than embers and charred logs in the grate.
“You,” he had said before the reality of his state - sat there on the doorstep of some anonymous, faceless office, his brother’s figure carving a sharp contrast to his own - slapped him as hard as if Mycroft had done it himself and he began to sob.
“Three stories, six songs and two great escapes to Mrs Hudson’s before she nodded off. Not the worst we’ve had this week.” John brought the balled up wipe to his friend’s face. “This might sting a bit.”
He had been nineteen and out of his mind outside Mycroft’s office. Security hadn’t let him in, why would they have? He had been wearing a hooded sweatshirt despite the summer heat. It had been far too big for him and scattered with cigarette burns.
The relief was so immediate and so apparent that his balance faltered and he had to put a hand out to the wall for support.
The unofficial smoking area, marked by a line of blank-faced nurses, paramedics and patients - one of which pulling along his drip, was at the very back of the hospital. It didn't have a shelter and cars passed it far too closely to be health and safety compliant. A low-standing wall was likely to have been used as somewhere to sit if it weren’t so wet from the rain.
He had not seen it before - not properly. There had only been mere glimpses when his flatmate padded down the hall after his shower or when it peaked out from underneath an unbuttoned shirt before John hastily pulled the two sides of cotton together.
“Oh, ugh, yeah. She went down about an hour ago,” John replied, running a hand through his hair as he remembered that that would be a dead giveaway too.
There had been a rough squeeze and murmurs of reassurance. He had buried his face in the lapel of his brother’s suit jacket, the soft cotton the first warm comfort he’d received in days.
As was the unspoken way with sharing a smoking break during a tense situation, they took a few more pulls before conversation rebooted.
He could feel Sherlock’s eyes upon him now, not just looking at him, but reading him, no doubt picking up on the way his hand was moving, the intensity to which he was looking at the cuts, the fact that he had unconsciously slipped his free hand onto Sherlock’s knee and given it a gentle squeeze.
When Sherlock had met John at the very beginning all those months ago that now seemed like a lifetime, he had thought him - aesthetically at least - plain.
Bolder than Sherlock however, she ran a finger down the length of the longest white line, rubbing the unblemished skin beside it to feel the difference.
The corner of John’s mouth curled slightly. “Go on then,” he said getting to his feet and stretching. “Tell me what happened and I’ll get the kit.”
“Have they caught the bastard?” Harry asked, eyes following a girl who looked no older than sixteen. She was paperwhite apart from the long stretch of purple marks up the inside of her arm.
In any other situation this odd question would have goaded Sherlock easily into an account of everything he knew about the fairer Watson - from the points he had deduced mere minutes from his first meeting of John, to the snippets of texts he had read over his flatmate’s shoulder.
By the time they returned to the ward, Mycroft had already left. A cup of tea sat on the bedside next to a small cup of tablets and a handwritten note.
He had then perched beside him, taking stock of his brother’s filthy clothes, the sweet yet acrid chemical smell that clung to him, the dark circles around eyes that had dulled considerably in the last few months.
“The great Sherlock Holmes drooling on my leg,” said a voice, barely audible over the hospital’s background noise.
“And what have they said to you about John?” Harry continued. “They said stuff to me but I couldn’t take it all in, not on the phone, not when they’d woken me up.”
The taller man awkwardly discarded of his Belstaff before taking his seat at the fireside. It must have been raining outside for his trouser legs and shoes glistened with a dewy shimmer only encountered when braving midwinter weather in London.
Sherlock frowned. One look told John that the musical back catalogue of Andrew Lloyd Webber had long been deleted from the detective’s hard drive if it had ever been there at all.
As John finished applying the last of the butterfly stitches, it seemed true darkness had engulfed most of the flat. A single lamp at the bookshelf now their only source of light.
Satisfied, he left the room, closing the door on John and the phenomenon that had just risen between them.
“She reads too many of the tabloids, thinks everyone fighting overseas is coming back in bits. She thought once he’d had his stint it would...I dunno...prove something, I guess. But John has always been fighting some cause, defending something..someone. That’s just how he is.”
“I missed the coverage of the killer cabbie story but I remember seeing the hairpin on the front of the Standard.
John had pushed him out of the way. And while, as an uninvested bystander, Sherlock would say ‘well, he knew what he was doing and there’s nothing to feel guilty about’, this did little to stem the dread and sickness threatening to break over him.
“Just so you know,” John began, cutting up more strips. “We - Rosie and me, I mean - we love you and as far as I’m concerned we’re all in this together. Whatever ‘this’ is. I know it’s not normal to be raising a child with your best friend but if you’ll have us I want it to be that way. There’s no one I want to do this with other than you….again, whatever ‘this’ is.”
Would he notice the blotches of red above his cheeks, the evidence of cold water splashed liberally and in haste - his shirt collar still damp? Was it obvious that he had vomited in A&E? Was the pattern of blood smears across his trousers telling of his fumbled attempts of staunching the gore from John’s chest wound in the messy backstreet in Highgate?
John was looking at him from beneath half closed eyelids, the one corner of his lip curled slightly, “people will talk.”
“Wait, no, one more thing.” And John unclipped the ladybird from Sherlock’s curls. “Might damage the no nonsense image,” he said pocketing the hairpin and standing up.
“Yeah, I could get you some bibimbap,” John seduced Sherlock carefully. “I know how much you enjoy that.”
However, it was not boring. Sherlock was adding information daily to his spreadsheets. This was going to be the best-documented case of alien residency known to mankind.
“Don't offer if you are not serious Sherlock,” John warned. “Rosie already gave her blessing for our wedded bliss.”
John could only watch in stunned silence as Mycroft gathered his coat and umbrella and left the flat. He wasn’t sure what had just happened, but he could tell Sherlock was worn out and just plain angry.
John chose to ignore Mycroft, as he helped Sherlock to his feet. “Come on love, you can’t keep the pup trapped in there just because we haven’t figured out names.”
Sherlock glanced at the snow too. He did not relish the idea of trudging along in it. “Thank you, I appreciate the hospitality, and this delicious dinner.”
“Yes, but still it’s always a lovely surprise,” Dr. Cass smiled at the omega. “Now, you are doing well.”
Sherlock leaned against the doorjamb and watched Rosie twirl around the dining room, Dodger in her arms, as she hummed a Christmas song tunelessly. He could hear a faint clapping sound, that almost seemed to be cheering the little girl on.
“So Doctor, when are you planning on claiming Sherlock?” Mycroft ignored his little brother. “I would ask what your intentions are, but you would already be dead, if they were not honorable.”
John smiled, his face lit by the fire and holiday lights. “How did you get into paranormal research?” He asked as he sipped from his tea mug.
John smiled at the man, recalling the smiling face of a fellow student, from what felt was a million years ago.
Sherlock nodded. “For some, paranormal activity is a leap of faith. I prefer using science to back it up.”
Sherlock pressed down again, wanting to make sure of something. What he was searching for he didn’t rightly know, but he knew he found it when the baby kicked his hand again. More than a bit content, Sherlock fell asleep, his hand resting on the bump.
John knew a con when he heard one, but Rosie just looked sweet and innocent. “Yeah alright, but only one.”
The man straightened his own impeccably tailored suit jacket, and turned around. “I am sure I will be seeing you around, Mr. Watson.”
“So Sherlock, still not wanting to know the sex of your baby?” Dr. Cass was a strident woman, with little tolerance for bullshit. Sherlock liked her immensely.
“I don’t want to be pregnant,” Sherlock murmured. “I have too much to do. Crimes to solve, criminals to catch.”
John’s hips shot forward, rubbing his prick against the tender, swollen hole of the omega. He wanted to fuck into it, until nobody would doubt his claim. John removed his teeth from Sherlock’s shoulder, lapping at the sticky blood that trickled down the bare, pale expanse of skin.
“Might not be a bad idea,” Sherlock murmured. “If this what I fear, I don't think you want her to see.”
“Good,” John mumbled, as he tucked his cold toes under Sherlock's thigh. God it had been a long day, and he was exhausted.
None of the children had gone missing from the cottage John Watson had purchased five years ago. However, when Sherlock put it on a map, that cottage was at the center of the missing children. It was interesting. The cottage itself had been rented and owned by a fair amount of people since the mid 1980s. In Sherlock's opinion far more than was average for the size, cost and location. Few people stayed more than a year. John Watson and his family had stayed the longest at five years.
Subtleness had been an art John had been forced to appreciate when he started courting Sherlock. He carefully ran a hand from his mate’s dark curls, down the curve of his spine, until it rested in the small of his back. He could feel Sherlock relax under his hand.
John stood stoically, his tail raised high, as each member of his pack came to greet him. It did not matter if the betas liked him personally. In this place, and in this form they had to respect him. He remained aloof, as Donovan, Lestrade and Anderson brushed against him in a submissive greeting. His full attention was focused on the sole omega of the pack.
John couldn’t help the nervous laugh that escaped him. He was meeting the family already, and he hadn’t even marked his almost-mate yet. Not that Sherlock would ever acknowledge the mate thing. Not even with a cub in the oven, so to speak. John was pinned by two sets of rather intense eyes, as he tried to choke off the laughter before it started.
“Don’t you dare Sherlock,” Mycroft intoned, his voice snooty as the queen herself. “Nicotine is not good for the baby.”
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the car pulled to a stop at an abandoned warehouse on the wharf.
Rosie's chin wobbled for a moment before she stood a tiny bit straighter. “Rosamund Watson, I'm five. Who are you?”
“She beat up James Moriarty on the playground, again.” Miss Molly continued softly. “I am not sure why, can you or Sherlock come and pick her up?”
Those were the days Sherlock reminded John more of a prickly cat, rather than the wolf he was. Craving affection, but refusing to show it himself, he was such a contradictory creature. John would start slow. Just a simple touch, his finger lingering too long on Sherlock’s nape. His hand on Sherlock’s hip, for whatever reason John could come up with. There were days, more than he would like to admit, that John would spend his whole work day thinking up ways to touch Sherlock. Innocent ways. Decadent ways. Hell, he wanted them both with the same fervor.
John had stood there, Rosie snuggled into his coat for warmth, her cold face pressed into throat as she keened tunelessly. He hadn't been sure what to say, to think. He was a god damn doctor, he should have seen the effects of postpartum depression. He was a fucking soldier, he should have seen the effects of PTSD. He had no excuse.
By the time he made it out of the loo, his intestines intact as far as he knew, Mycroft had already installed his fat bottom in Sherlock’s favorite spot on the sofa. The consulting detective flopped into the saggy wing back chair, idly searching for his nicotine patches.
Pregnancy was bloody insufferable. The naps alone were enough to make Sherlock want to pull out John’s gun and shoot holes in all the walls.
Sherlock’s startling grey eyes met John’s in the mirror, as he pulled his dressing gown around his constantly changing body.
John felt he was normally a well-adjusted alpha. In comparison to some of his companions, he was rather mellow in fact. However, seeing Sherlock, the omega of the pack, ignore him in such a blatant way riled his alpha instincts. With a growl, he stalked, stiff legged, over to the taller wolf. When Sherlock did not roll over and show his belly, John leapt.
Give him a good malevolent haunting. A bloody demonic possession. Anything to break the monotony of London in December. Every time it spit the slightest bit of snowy drizzle the city went into panic mode. Sherlock enjoyed the chaos, but abhorred the stupidity of people.
The alpha bit back a growl as he took in his surroundings. It was one of those fancy luxury cars that John had never had the pleasure of riding in. A beautiful beta sat in the seat across from him, typing away on her Blackberry.
With a groan, John changed into his human form. Sherlock followed shortly after. John snuffled Sherlock’s dark, curly locks as he hunched over the omega’s nude form. His cock heavy between the man’s pert cheeks. With a growl, John pulled his companion to his knees, his teeth sinking into the smooth muscle of Sherlock’s shoulder.
John raised his snout, scenting the air. The copper tang of blood was heavy, so familiar. It was like being back in Afghanistan. Where it always smelled of blood and sweat. He could hear the sounds of the betas’ blood lust as they gorged themselves on the stag’s intestines. The wolf found it exciting, but not as stimulating as the arousal that permeated Sherlock’s scent.
Martha Hudson had been baffled at first at the strange goings on, and then progressively more scared. When she had been shoved down the stairs by an invisible force after cleaning the empty flat upstairs, she had finally gotten mad. She was not going to be run out of her home by some bully. She refused to put up with it from an abusive husband and she would be damned if some other sort of diabolical bullshit was going to drive her insane.
When he woke some time later, Sherlock’s other hand was buried in his hair. Those mysterious grey eyes John was still learning to read were focused on him.
“It's all part of the package when I investigate a haunting, and I won't lie,” Sherlock smiled. “You have a hell of haunting happening here.”
John swiftly followed after the pack, until he was in the lead. He could feel the restrained power behind him. And it made him giddy with excitement. He could feel the pack spreading out, as they pinned the stag down. Trapped, and white eyed with a primal fear.
John was not so lucky. Anger thrummed through his veins at the delight Sally had for attempting to tear his mate down. Time and again, she never allowed a chance to pass. If it had been closer to the full moon, John’s wolf would be tempted to rip the stupid cow’s throat out. He wanted to lash out and put the beta in her place.
John could feel the strain in his hind leg, as the wound he had suffered as a human flared up, even in this form. He refused to allow it to undermine him. John reared up and hunched over the omega’s longer, skinnier form, and clamped his jaw around Sherlock’s throat. He growled once, and jerked. Not hurting the younger wolf, simply showing him that he meant business.
“I’ve been thinking about you since the first night in the woods,” John confided as he pushed his hips forward.
John stroked Sherlock’s protecting hand, not wanting to interfere, just to be part of the bonding. He rested his head against Sherlock’s leg and simply existed next to his family.
Maybe that should have been the first sign that there was something off about the cottage. How careful he had become with people being left in the house alone.
Miss Molly helped her with her book bag, and they stood outside, waiting. Soon enough, her papa and daddy came into sight. Her daddy’s long coat was swirling around his legs, as he talked with his hands to her papa. Papa was in his usual oatmeal colored sweater, watching her daddy with awe in his eyes.
John stepped into the quiet room. Sherlock was in his wolf form, curled around a tiny baby. Those lovely grey eyes were a bit murky, but alert. He knew that weres had a tendency to revert back to their lupine form after a trauma, but to see his family so. It broke his heart and glued it back together, stronger than before.
“If you knew then why fight it so hard,” John couldn’t help but question, even though he was too exhilarated to really care about the answer.
“So did they believe you then?” John turned to face Sherlock properly, his bare feet propped up on the sofa between them.
“Okay love?” John asked quietly. He was generally quiet on their walks together, and Sherlock appreciated that. John never seemed to feel the urge to add to the noise pollution in the omega’s head.
John bit his lip, trying not to smile at the irrational omega. It hurt to hear his cub referred to as devil spawn, but it was half Sherlock after all.
Rosie still missed Joey, who she had not seen since Christmas eve the year prior. She was however, making friends at the primary school she was attending in London.
Mycroft watched his brother’s mate pace the waiting room. Anxious as all expecting fathers were. He found himself both amused and touched. He did not spend his time idly; after all he had lives to arrange. When Sherlock and his little family arrived home at 221 B. Baker Street, it would be to a proper nursery.
“I don’t know if it’s a good idea,” John shifted on the bench, uncomfortable. “An omega and alpha living together is asking for trouble.”
Sherlock dressed as quickly as he could, once his appointment was over. He never liked the feel of a hospital’s sterile air on his skin. He slowly made his way outside, to find a cab. It was a quiet trip home.
Mrs. Hudson had tried to talk John into disallowing Sherlock to continue his consulting work. John had realized early on that nothing was going to dissuade the man from doing what he wanted, when he wanted. And in all honesty, John wouldn’t want it any other way. Sherlock was passionate about his work. The work. In his mind, it was the only thing that mattered.
John had found himself introducing himself to the tall, well built older man. He had found out that Luther had been a veteran of war, and having lost his sight in Afghanistan, was now at lose ends. They had sat in the corner of the pub and traded stories as only two veterans of war can. By the end of the night, Luther had seemed like an older brother to John. He too had few connections in the town. He was as lonely as John. The next day, John had invited Luther to Sunday dinner of roast and potatoes. Rosie had adored him on first sight.
“Of course not,” John soothed, picking his words with care. “You are dehydrated though, an IV would fix that right up.”
“More information than I ever needed to know,” Sherlock smiled back. “And the butcher totally wants into your knickers.”
Sherlock hissed in frustration and twisted his hand trying to find an angle that would allow him some satisfaction. Every time his wrist bumped against his belly. He thumped his head against the sofa, before lifting his hand from his hot, swollen prick. This was bloody intolerable.
Once they arrived at St. Bart’s, they refused to let John follow Sherlock. Male c-sections were quite a bit more complicated than their female counterpart. As a doctor John understood this. However, as he watched his mate being taken away from him in his time of need, it made him want to tear through the hospital in a rage.
They had not continued the story Rosie had started earlier. By some unspoken agreement, that had seemed much too familiar after only knowing each other for a few scant hours, Sherlock and John had changed the subject to rapidly approaching holiday. Christmas was only days away. Rosie had not paid them a lot of mind, playing with Dodger quietly until when Sherlock glanced over, both child and puppy were sacked out asleep under the Christmas tree. It was the cutest puppy pile Sherlock had ever seen, if he was being honest.
“I think this is the first time I’ve seen you for a loss of words,” John laughed. “What’s wrong love, sharing a bedroom too progressive for you?”
“Have you?” John questions, his hands tracing shapes and symbols into the thin skin covering their bump.
John stopped fussing with the kettle. “I'm sorry what? Are you telling me that my daughter's imaginary friend is the ghost of a dead little girl?”
John was just leaving the surgery, when he got a text from Sherlock. Demanding, as always, that he stop and pick up milk before coming home. In the month that they had been living together, John had yet to see Sherlock actually go and buy groceries. In fact, Sherlock had barely left the flat, unless of course he had a crime scene to go to.
“It’s Mike! Mike Stamford,” the man came to a halt in front of John, huffing slightly from exertion. “I know I got fat!”
John had followed his gaze, and laughed softly. “I had better get them to bed.” He stood, and leaned backwards-groaning softly when his back popped. “She's getting too big for me to do this for much longer,” he whispered to Sherlock. “So I try to do it as much as I can now.”
John sat down. “Pregnancy won’t be boring at least,” he tried. “Think of all the data you’ll be collecting.”
John had to fight the urge to pull his omega back to him, to assert his dominance in the most basic way. To mark Sherlock up and make sure everybody in the greater London area knew the man was his.
John wanted more. His prick breaching the omega’s tight hole was an exquisite torture he never wanted to do without.
“Tea boys, decaf of course,” Mrs. Hudson sang out. “Oh babies in the house again. How wonderful, Mrs. Turner is going to be so jealous.”
After he had been medically discharged from the army, John had kicked around London for a bit, staying in a horrid little bed-share and moping. He had met Mary in a coffeeshop, and it had seemed like a glorious connection. Not even a year later they had been married and expecting a baby. They had gone on a driving holiday around Wales when Mary was about five months along, and she had fallen head over heels in love with the Mumbles.
“Died in 1979,” Luther murmured. “Right here in the house, they found her with her head in the oven. Police deemed it a suicide.”
After a lifetime of waiting and pacing, Sherlock’s harried looking doctor entered the waiting room. John was in her space within seconds.
John spooned up behind him, his lips automatically going to the nape of Sherlock’s neck. The omega arched his body, and John’s hands automatically found their way to his bump.
Once he was nude, John knelt next to Sherlock, his fingers ghosting over the thin skin of his clavicle. John would not normally describe the omega as delicate. But his skin was delicate, translucent with blue veins close to the surface. It was a part of pregnancy, but never before had John found it so appealing.
As Sherlock loped out of the forest, John grinned. The hunt, whether the omega knows it or not, was on. He had a mate to woo and win.
John refused to conform to the usual alpha behaviors. It was rather intriguing, and completely infuriating.
It turned out that John in fact did know somebody who would talk to him. John didn't have to go into the surgery today, since it was Christmas Eve and Rosie did not have school, they sat around the dining room table with tea and scones. Rosie was outside with Dodger, building a snowman. John kept one eye on her, as he introduced Sherlock to Luther.
“Because you three are too blind to see what is laid out in front of you,” Sherlock snarked testily. “A blind four year old could solve this case before you even had a clue.”
John growled, long and low in his throat, when Donovan pushed Sherlock back on his heels. It was instinct that had him pushing between the two antagonistic pack mates, baring his teeth at the female beta.
A wolf, John assumed was Sherlock slunk into the clearing, a tall, rangy black wolf with stormy eyes. Ignoring all of the social dynamics of the pack, Sherlock showed no deference to John. It was intriguing.
And that is how he found himself spending his day. Unable to exit his car, while he sat in the pouring rain listening to a catalog of episodes, the next better than the last.
Donovan froze, a vicious smirk on her face. “And how do you think you can punish me?” She inquired snidely.
Rosie scrambled up, eager to go and chase down her blue Boston Terrier puppy. He had been an early Christmas gift and Rosie was deep in puppy love.
“Most people tell me I am a git or an asshole,” Sherlock admitted with a shrug. “One gets used to it.”
John snorted into his water, his eyes watering from trying not to laugh. His daughter was coming out of her shell fast around Sherlock Holmes.
“Yoo-hoo, mail darling!” Came Mrs Hudson's fluttering voice from downstairs. “Letters from all your friends!”
With an unnatural grace, the omega leapt into the forest, racing away from the pack’s kill. Without a second thought, John followed. He chased Sherlock over logs and streams, branches and roots snapping under his paws. Sherlock led him on a merry chase, until he had the younger wolf trapped like a rabbit in a snare.
She sounded like a child in need of reassurance, maybe she realised this because before Sherlock could answer she said: “Yeah, he’ll be alright. He’s too stubborn to d-”
“And that’s the last of it,” John said, lightly pressing on the final strip applied just above Sherlock’s cheekbone. “Should heal well enough in a few days.”
“What time is it?” He asked, the thick grey sky - not to mention the concussion and fatigue - skewing his perceptions of anything as grounded as minutes and hours.
Sherlock took the cigarette and felt no guilt. Harry was right, if he couldn't smoke now when was he allowed to? By the same token, if Harry asked whether she could down a few glasses of red when she went home, he'd hardly refuse.
There was affirmation in their mutual questioning. This was, without a doubt, the faceless sibling Sherlock had often wondered about in the months of his and John’s friendship. The estranged wife of Clara, the alcoholic, the giver of a phone that had acted as a catalyst to a relationship that had led to her brother lying in this antiseptic room, three and a half pints of blood lighter.
Her haircut was recent, only a few days judging by the tiny stray hairs that clung to her coat collar. This suggested a new job or love interest.
In his confusion he sat up abruptly, his back protesting at the sudden change of position after a long time hunched over.
Long gone were the days of violin concertos at three in the morning or wake up calls to gunfire in the living room.
“Christ Sherlock, what’s happened?” He had said; maybe as a move to disguise his sordid family affairs from the security guard who had been watching from the threshold.
He had sat on the steps waiting, chewing at his fraying sleeves and generally unnerving passersby who were not accustomed to seeing this sort of man in Knightsbridge.
He walked back over to the living room, medical supplies under his arm, and plonked himself down on the floor in front of the fireplace. He beckoned Sherlock to do the same, adding “I can reach you better here” when his friend hesitated.
A quick glance at the window confirmed it was still raining but Harry seemed undeterred, retrieving her lighter and the Superkings.
Neither made a move to break the contact. Injuries, and the caring for eachother that followed, always seemed to blur the physical boundaries they had set between themselves - however unspoken.
His hand at Sherlock’s knee moved back up cup his friend’s face again, his fingers absently twirled the ends of his friend’s hair as he worked.
“Yes,” was all Sherlock said, his hand back to bunching a handful of John’s clothing as the older man extracted the final piece of glass. “I mean yes to dinner. Dinner would be...good.”
Sherlock didn't need to answer. The dapples of blood on his clothes, the creases on his shirt said it all.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied before the cold sensation hit his cheek and was followed rapidly by the fierce stab of alcohol hitting open flesh. He hissed, flinched, but otherwise remained still in John’s grasp.
A smattering of rain at the window that he barely noticed until now reminded him that the world was turning still, weather was changing, London did not stand horror struck by a knife crime in leafy suburbia.
“It’s all a blur,” he said, filling his lungs with the cheap tobacco smoke so he didn’t have to elaborate.
“So, what happened to the suspect?” John asked, finishing the clean-up job and picking up the tweezers.
“I need a clear space to work on, so that will have to do,” John said before his friend could argue.
Sherlock was watching him again, properly watching, eyes darting back and forth following his fingers but also his own mental game of cat and mouse that he so often fell into during a lapse in conversation.
“Oh it was the usual tedious story, John. Man stalks star of little amdram production, she takes no notice until amourous letters start turning a tad macabre. Upon the final performance of said amdram show, said star finds said stalker in her dressing room getting a little too friendly with one of her costumes from Act Two. I then track him down to a shady little strip club in Soho where I interrupt his follow-up entertainment of harassing the scantily-clad bar staff. He then proceeds to tell me that he and Miss Amdram were very much in love and that I should keep my nose out. When I asked as to whether it was the barely legible love letters or the wanking into her clothes that won her over in the end, he let his emotions get the better of him, smashed his beer bottle on the bar and jabbed it in my face. On reflection, I may have handled the situation with a little less tact than usual. The dancers were very nice though, one of them gave me their handkerchief and called me a cab.”
That's how she had met the man after all. Mrs Hudson had married a very bad man in her youth. She had gotten out relatively unscathed, except for a healthy distrust of attractive, charming men with dark eyes and a penchant for serial killing. The night he had been executed in the great state of Florida, she had drank a magnum of champagne in celebration. The next day weird things had begun to happen at 221 Baker Street.
John was thankful he did not have a lot of crap to move, one rather heavy box, a duffle of clothes, his computer and his gun. All in all, it was the easiest move he had ever participated in. He was in the process of hailing a cab, difficult to do when carrying all of one’s possessions, when he was shoved bodily into a car.
John could feel his canines extending, his claws lengthening. It sounded like a threat, a threat to the wolf’s mate.
His body was revolting against him. Before the bump, Sherlock could go days without food. He could function without sleep. Now, he couldn’t even walk down to the corner shop without feeling exhausted. According to the idiotic doctors John took him to every month, Sherlock had mild anemia.
John snorted. “Well yeah, I mean local stories about a half demon half goat taking misbehaving children away, being published in the papers is outrageous. Even for Wales.”
John put his arm around Rosie's shoulders and steered her away from the tree. He left her and Dodger with Luther and headed back outside with the shovel. It did took them ages. The ground was hard and frozen, but with two determined men they made the effort. They built a fire pit close to the ground, and between digging sessions warmed the earth with coals.
John wasn't sure if she was aware of what was happening around the cottage. Rosie was not scared or nervous acting in the house. Unlike John himself. She never crawled into bed with him at night, unless she was sick. He could remember crawling into his parent's bed in the middle of night for a plethora of reasons. Monsters under the bed, stairs creaking ominously or just wanting cuddles. John bent over and kissed Rosie's head affectionately. She leaned into him for a side snuggle, without removing her hands or concentration from the pastry.
“I don't need a doubter,” John had snapped tiredly. “I need somebody to figure out what's going on with my house.”
“Mrs Hudson, I'm Sherlock Holmes. I'm here about your ghost problem.” The man smiled what Martha thought was the sweetest smile she had ever seen. And that had been the beginning of their friendship.
Sherlock listened to it again. Possibly female? Definitely angry. He played it again. And again. There was the proof that this cottage was under paranormal threat, but other than breaking glasses and misplaced items, were John and Rosie in danger?
Happy Holidays all! Thank you all for reading and taking the time to leave comments and kudos, they are all appreciated. I hope you enjoyed!
“Don't apologize,” Sherlock smiled. “I think that's fantastic.” Sherlock looked at the woebegone, slightly wonky shaped pastry on his plate. It looked like a five year old made it. Honestly it looked better than anything Sherlock could make. With the slightest bit of trepidation, he cut into the crisp pastry, inhaling the savory aroma of spicy meat, potato and gravy. He had been missing out all this time.
They separated slowly, John resting his forehead against Sherlock's cheek. “Stay for Christmas, and we'll talk about moving to London.” John murmured. “As roommates, to start.”
“Nothing quite that interesting,” Sherlock answered. “I do have a landlady and a podcast producer. Lestrade is sort of like a puppy I guess. He is barely house trained though.”
It was practically a declaration of love, coming from Sherlock. John hid a smile, as he dialed the local Korean shop. The owners were becoming increasingly familiar with the occupants at 221 B Baker Street.
“Mate? What the bloody hell are you talking about?” Sherlock shouted. “The idiot outside was a potential flat share, not my mate.”
“Mummy would of course like to see you before you deliver,” Mycroft continued on blithely. “Seeing as you look a like death warmed over, perhaps you should go today.”
John walked into the flat and went straight into the kitchen. After a long day at the surgery, dealing with aches, pains and the common cold, all he wanted was a cup of tea. Even if that cup of tea was decaf. He could hear Sherlock playing the most discordant notes on his violin. The noise sounded like a cat in heat, being strangled. It had been another bad day then.
The constant, low-grade arousal that buzzed through his body at all times. It was like the food cravings, never ending. He was always hungry, for food, sex and human touch.
“Yes. We really need to work on your observational skills,” Sherlock murmured, as he led the way to John’s bedroom. He didn’t want to disturb the experiment taking over his own bed. He wasted no time stripping out of his dressing gown and laying down on John’s immaculately made bed.
John kept his thrusts shallow and slow, his hands roaming Sherlock’s body. He allowed his lips to linger on whichever bit of skin they landed on. Sherlock’s ear, his cheek; and when Sherlock came again, his bared throat. He nipped at the reddening skin, as he rode out his own orgasm.
“She's been here forever,” Rosie began, petting Dodger's ears. “I don't remember a time when she wasn't.” She glanced up at John. “She's nice, not like some of the other children who come and go.”
“Here-here or here-in-town?” Rosie asked her thumb heading for the corner of her mouth. John hadn't seen her suck her thumb in months.
John was rather worried with the pasty sheen gleaming from Sherlock’s already pale skin. He had seen first hand the havoc morning sickness could wreck, but Sherlock seemed to be suffering from a rather severe bout of it. His already lanky frame was not holding up under the constant barrage of nausea. John rubbed a soothing hand over Sherlock’s lower back. It felt as though the man had already dropped at least a stone’s weight.
One year later, John and Rosie were living at 221 B Baker with Sherlock and Dodger. One of the spare bedrooms was just that, a spare bedroom filled with boxes and detritus. Sherlock had had his way, and John had not argued. Much. Luther visited often, and had become fast friends with Lestrade, much to Sherlock's chagrin.
John tightened his fingers around his cup and looked out on Rosie again. “Sherlock thinks it might have something to do with the weird things happening in the cottage.”
“I don’t need a moment. My answer is no,” John growled. “Now, it’s time for me to move into my new flat.”
John was still laughing when Rosie skidded back into the kitchen, Dodger right behind her. “Daddy can Dodger have a meat pasty too?”
John put one of the Beatles' albums on the old turn table, and he and Rosie bopped around the kitchen as they worked on supper. They were making one of Rosie's favorite meals, meat pasties. With a five year old fluting the edges of the pre-made pastry, they were not the prettiest of dinners, but they were damn tasty if John said so. John could hear giggles echoing around the dining room, that were not coming from his daughter. At this moment Rosie's tongue was peeking out from the corner of her lip, as she studiously worked on her pastry skills.
Sherlock was, for a lack of a better term, feisty. Nothing at all like the omegas his family had foisted on him in the past, before Afghanistan. Sherlock did not let his biological urge dictate what he did with his life. In fact, he seemed to fight it with every breath he took.
Sherlock collapsed back against the flimsy pillow the hospital provided. All of the fight seemed to drain straight out of him.
“No,” Sherlock's grin faded a bit. “But that is the curse of being a skeptic. Not even solid scientific proof can change your mind.
John and Sherlock leaned forward, and with the natural grace of story teller, Luther started talking.
And Sherlock would pout. Then he would simmer, every little thing a constant irritant. Then the shouting would begin. It would go on for days, until it reached John’s breaking point. Sherlock had withdrawn into himself. Quiet and if was anybody other than Sherlock, John would say forlorn. John couldn’t stand to see him that way, like a sculpture made of ice.
“My name is Sherlock,” the man knelt in front of John's daughter, looking her in the eye. He didn't baby talk at her, which John appreciated greatly.
Sherlock pushed past John, getting into Sally’s face. “What’s wrong Sally, sick of getting on your knees for married men?” He sneered disdainfully.
John was beyond gobsmacked. If this was the man behind the voice of his favorite podcast, the witty, sarcastically brilliant man who told the best stories. Well he was beyond fucked. He glanced down when he felt Rosie attach herself to his leg. This was still a thing she did, when she was feeling shy, which seemed to be around anybody who was not himself or Luther.
I knew all those kids that went missing. Mumbles was small, it had been a hub of tourism back in the heyday, and it was in the middle of that decline you know. It was like the village was dying. But not that teacher.
“Does pica run in families?” John pondered for a moment, before dismissing the line of questioning. “Have you eaten a proper supper?”
There were drawbacks. Only a few alphas were born each year, and even fewer omegas. Before they had come out of hiding, things had been even. Now, however there was a surplus of betas, and not enough alphas and omegas to go around. The imbalance left the pack, a smaller scale of society, in discord. Improper aggression and incompetence in the work place were only a few of the symptoms of the imbalance of society.
“No,” Sherlock sneered from his seat on the sofa. “You’ll insist on calling her something inane like Izzy.”
Rosie and John both looked at the man in shock. That was inconceivable to them. “Well, you are in for a treat then,” John smiled at Sherlock. “Rosie made them, so they will be delicious.”
Sherlock blanched as he watched the movers bringing in the baby furniture that had been in the Holmes family for decades, if not centuries.
John basked in the vision of Sherlock nude in the moonlight. His skin’s glow seemed to rival that of Luna. The alpha couldn’t stop his hands, as they reached around Sherlock’s hips, to rest on the bump growing there. The omega allowed it for several minutes. Before stepping away.
As a child, in his mother’s pack, John had run with omegas. Until they were old enough to mate and start raising pups of their own. In the army, omegas were anomalies. They simply did not compute with the lifestyle. A rogue omega was even more rare. Unheard of even.
He wasn’t sure if he would ever get used to the idea of being pregnant. It was definitely an occurrence that Sherlock had not planned for, wished for or wanted.
“That is one of the perks of being an alpha mate,” Dr. Cass grinned wickedly. “Not to mention the sex.”
