"Naturally. The villa is ready and waiting. Besides, you and I both know-" and in unified snooty female tones startlingly similar to those of their Holmes relatives the brothers finished the sentence together.
"Our favourite little spy" John chuckled. "Go on then, what does he have to say" Sherlock cleared his throat and read aloud. "Congratulations brother, I knew we would be expecting a happy announcement eventually." John laughed, and Sherlock had to join in as the tension of their conversation was defused."Prat."
It felt wrong that the earth was still turning, the sun still shone, people were born and smiling and happy, life kept going even though his whole world had stopped. People would not remain sympathetic forever, this much he knew, so he got up every morning and went to work at the clinic, made mindless small talk, smiled and laughed in all the right places because he was fine, declining offers of drinks and dinner and coffee and chats from Molly and Lestrade in favour of Harry who knew exactly what was going on. He'd work and do the shopping and go back to his flat and stare at the telly and go to bed, trying fruitlessly to sleep for more than an hour at a time. He'd lost more than he'd care to admit at St Barts, yet the annual pilgrimage continued on the anniversary regardless of his personal hatred of the place.
be hurt by the news." Mrs Hudson sighed and sat down "It's that sister of his isn't it?" Sherlock was astounded by Mrs Hudson's intuition and made a noise in the affirmative. "Well Sherlock I think you have to give her a chance to tell him herself but if she hasn't by next week... You tell him. Gently, mind you, and be sure to apologise for it before you say anything. Of course you could always ask his sister to come clean about whatever it is." Sherlock contemplated this, better she admit that she's dying than Sherlock inform those closest to her. Most people tended to have an issue with the way he handled death in general, but clients are different than John. John would need a bit more tact. "Thank you Mrs Hudson." She chuckled warmly "Not a bother dear, now go sort everything out and give John a kiss from me." Sherlock slipped his phone back into his pockets and stalked to Harry's room, leaning in the doorway unobtrusively to allow her some time without his actual presence. She would want to see the people she loved, not him, after hearing news like that. So he stood quietly, waiting for a cue that signalled he could enter fully.
“For god’s sake… you’ll never understand what it is like when your mind is whirring out of control only to jerk to a stop and refuse to connect the dots. I did what I had to do. I got the job done, so kindly drop the subject so we can focus on
"So you made up your mind then?" John asked kindly as the silence threatened to stretch. Sherlock nodded sharply and opened his mouth as if to speak but shut it again just as quick with a cough.
Mycroft had danced his feet sore and laughed until his sides ached by the time they decided to call it a day, leaving the mopeds in the private parking area in town and walking the couple of kilometres back to the villa .
John out. Which he had, but while Sherlock knew that he had folded like a sheet of paper after a single well placed surprise blow, John had clearly put up more of a fight; the split lip and puffy eye he was sporting as he lay on the ground a few meters away a testament to that fact.
"What if she disapproves? Of you, of us, even of me? Though that last one is completely illogical. There has to be some way I can guarantee that she likes you, not that women have trouble liking you but this is different. You have fantastic posture which is good because she can't stand slouching. What if she thinks you're not intelligent enough for me, or too unsuccessful? But you'll be compared to Greg which is great because he cannot hope to compete but still there are too many variables!" John sat in stunned silence as the monologue played itself out into dark streams of muttering. "Sherlock, calm down. It's not like it's the end of the world, even if she hates me, which I hope she doesn't but if she does, I've survived Mycroft. He's not exactly my biggest fan but it hasn't changed anything between you and I, so don't think for a minute that I'll let whatever comes next change us either. Yours. No one else matters to be honest." Sherlock processed this, scrutinizing John's face for tells of deception, there were none. He took a deep breath and nodded, curls falling softly against his forehead.
At least, until tea was drunk and supper picked at. Then Sherlock heard a whisper in his ear. “Are you alright son?” he asked quietly, knowing well that they could not be heard under Mummy's waxing lyrical about the state of affairs in Mycroft's offices.
He began looking forward to crashing into him backstage during shows, catching sidelong glances of John mouthing along to his songs from the sidelines as he sang them. After a few weeks he asked John to hang out with him in his room, they had become closer over time and the bus was empty anyway, they were heading out to London and seeing as the rest of the guys had family there they left earlier to stay with them. John accepted his invitation to ride with him in an instant, flashing one of his signature smiles. Sherlock knew that he was failing miserably in his efforts to deny any feelings he had for John, he couldn't pinpoint what it was exactly that made him feel anything at all for him except the fact that he was
"If... if you ever feel like talking to an old man for a while, well, you know where to find me Sherlock Holmes."  John smiled weakly and Sherlock nodded with the best approximation of a smile he could manage pasted on his face. John nodded and spun around to walk inside, pulling his suitcase behind him before stopping short and striding back apace to stand right in Sherlock's space, so close he could count the number of hairs on his head , and with a reverence a cloudy day in London could never have warranted, slid one hand into the curls at the back of Sherlock's head and guided their mouths together so gently that if Sherlock hadn't been able to feel the lips warm and steady against his own he'd not have noticed.
"There shall I gaze on the mountains again, on the fields and the woods and the burns and the glens, away 'mong the corries beyond human ken, in the haunts of the deer shall I roam. Oh ro soon shall I see them, oh he ro see them oh see them, oh ro soon shall I see them, the mist covered mountains of home. Hail to the mountains with summits of- My God have you been standing there the whole time!?" In hindsight, he should probably have interrupted sooner.
“Puzzling over what my good fellow? Did you not just solve a case that had baffled Scotland Yard for weeks?”
Sherlock sighed loudly, throwing his phone across the room, causing John to open an eyelid slowly. "I'm not getting that back for you later" John mumbled, voice muffled by the pillow against his face. Sherlock looked at John for a second, giving him the we-both-know-that's-not-true face before falling back against him. "Not a case then?" John asked hopefully. He was knackered and quite frankly loathe to leave the new found comfort of Sherlock's bed. In a contrast to everywhere else the Sherlock-hurricane tore through his bedroom was immaculate, if a tad dark. John quite liked the colours, dark greys and black accented with purple and navy. It was almost like Sherlock wore his room around everyday.
Mycroft bit back the urge to laugh. His brother may have been a genius but at this he was most certainly not. "Will I tell you? I don't know if you'll appreciate it brother." Sherlock glared at him "Oh don't be so dramatic Mycroft, it's not a good colour on you."
"John?" Sherlock called softly to him through the open window of the cottage, sitting now in his chair with his violin strings being plucked between his fingers. "John I'm not going to wake up in the morning." John frowned and looked up from his weeding. "What are you on about Sherlock?" Sherlock held his gaze with a sombre expression. "I am not going to wake up tomorrow John, nor any morning after that." John sputtered and stood up, eyes wide and terrified. "Of course you are! We have so much.. You have so much time left yet! You're Sherlock Holmes, young forever!" Sherlock's lip wavered just a fraction. "John." He was up and inside in moments, sliding to his knees on the ground in front of his best friend's chair. "You can't know that, tell me you're kidding Sherlock. Tell me it's just a trick. Please."
The first quiver of Sherlock’s lip as the word left his mouth was joined by watery eyes in what seemed like an instant.
He had long thought himself incapable of relationships and feelings to begin with. Having a boyfriend must indicate he has felt affection and… love at some point.
"I get the feeling this isn't exactly what you had in mind, come here, I have an idea, you just tell me if you're uncomfortable ok?" John prompted gently and Sherlock rolled closer, facing him with a look of wary caution in his eyes. As gracefully as he could manage John scooted just a bit higher on the pillows, until his chin was level with Sherlock's head, and then he closed the gap between them fully, nestling one arm under his head and the other around Sherlock's torso and insinuating his leg between Sherlock's, they were connected from head to toe on his part.
Not many people would be so willing, so unafraid of touching him. Given the evidence of John's genuine surprise that Sherlock did not recognise him, and his relative ease before realising Sherlock had no idea who he was, the improbable truth seemed to be more confusing than anything else.
Piqué turns - A series of travelling turns done on one leg, pointed forwards in quick succession while the other is bent and pointed towards the knee
The blonde was by his side all of a sudden, elbows leaning heavily on the railing as he looked out across the London skyline. Sherlock did not know what was expected of him in the situation so he turned to watch the city too. "I'm going to miss it. Definitely." Sherlock looked down at his face and nodded. Shipping out in two days time, this party was for the man next to him, a last hurrah in case he didn't return. "I should say you would. Afghanistan or Iraq?" Sherlock was surprised to find his mouth moving of it's own accord . Must be the alcohol he deemed before waiting for a response from the shocked man beside him. "How do you know that?" Sherlock sighed. "Give me your phone for a moment." Strangely, the man did as he was asked. A phone was dropped into Sherlock's outstretched palm. Deftly after years of playing violin he swirled his fingers across the keys, typing out a message to his client. When he was finished he replaced the phone into the other man's pocket and began. "Afghanistan or Iraq because you have a military stance about you, controlled and well postured. The chain around your neck is attached to the dogtags you just acquired when you received your duty notice last month. You're a careful man who would do anything to help those in need but also an adrenaline junkie who is waiting for the next high. You're sentimental because you can't afford not to be and not as well off as others assume you would be, which explains the phone from your brother the divorcing alcoholic. It was gift that you would otherwise not have accepted but it gives you a way to contact him and make sure he is okay when you're gone. This party is in fact for you as a going away of sorts as in two days you will be leaving for either Afghanistan or Iraq." He let the last word fade slowly out and waited for the inevitable insults that were sure to follow.
“Alright, alright, not one word. Now pick up your cutlery and eat, Sherlock, you’re still so thin, it’s a wonder your feet are firmly planted on the ground at all,” Mycroft interjected, a small spark of panic alight in his eyes.
He was unsurprised to find the workshop busy, with the master gone the bulk of the work would be thrust upon shoulders that were not quite ready for it yet, and mistakes would be made, therefore getting ahead of the work was the best and only solution if their shop was to remain open. They would need a master, but from the look of that coffin, there was one in their midst, he just had yet to be found.
happening and I want to go on my own terms. I don't want to suffer. That's why I'm going to Switzerland tonight for some assistance. I'm
Evidently he had been wrong about taking things slow, then again this was Sherlock Holmes, of course he would be wrong. Sherlock had been genuinely concerned that John would find the experience un-enjoyable, not that it was Sherlock's first encounter, no. But before the gesture had lacked sentiment. The other's hadn't mattered to him. No one mattered except John.
"Never would have been my plan on both fronts, thank you Mycroft for that by the way, and I myself would not ever consider Seb to be anything more than a grievous mistake that I will never and have never made again. I was 16, and college is a breeding ground for that sort. I learned my lesson, no one until John." He said it lovingly,as if just the name would express all his feelings for the man. To them it did, the drawled "John" could show every word he could never hope to express to John, and it was sometimes better than their compliments at expressing things."He has fantastic posture, ex-military?" and so they launched into the most amiable conversation they had ever had as a family, discussing the two men's boyfriends. Father would have turned over in his grave Mycroft thought to himself.
The odd thing was, John was so used to the openly emotional part of Sherlock being on display in their home these days, that this was quite alarming. The mask only usually dropped when there were strangers or people they didn’t like about, or occasionally when Sherlock was having a Bad day and was reminded of something from his time in Serbia. He looked down at himself self-consciously but the blue checked shirt and brown shoes couldn’t be that offensive, and he’d worn one or other of them before since he’d come home.
Looking around the familiar spot, very little had changed since the last time they had been in London, the only thing that had changed had been them. "Sherlock I-" John was quaking, his leg paining him more than it had in almost fifty years and suddenly everything was too much. Sherlock finally looked round and his hand shot out to steady the older man, the warmth of it penetrating through layers of coat and jumper until it felt as if they were skin to skin. "Not yet John, we're almost there." John steeled himself and nodded, and they stepped out into fading sunlight side by side, partners to the last.
Inside, wrapped carefully in an old bandana Sherlock had worn religiously in his quest to become a pirate, were the little reminders he had kept of his youth, his humanity and his overwhelming capability to
Mary smiled brightly at him and nodded, slipping a carrot stick between her teeth. “I heard you're scheduled for Christmas, Boxing Day and New Year's Eve, so I have two working theories. Either you're a complete workaholic or you don't have anywhere else to be. If it's the second one, a group of us are having a kind of ‘We're working and it's Christmas let's pretend we aren't here’ dinner that you should come to. If the first, you should come anyway.”
"Holmes, Duck!" He yelled before rushing at the hulk of a man, adrenaline pumping through his every cell, to knock him to the ground with a tackle as Holmes spun out of the path of danger. The struggle was a brief one after that, a few good hits were all it took to subdue him, and the arrival of a few constables and a lamp soon after was the cue for their departure, which was not taken without some small degree of consternation from Lestrade until they were finally dismissed, although not before Holmes had stumbled across the 'crown jewels' as they were, in a display jar on a shelf, and the butcher's wife tied in the corner. The constables had been suddenly very keen to be out of the butcher shop as well.
“These have yet to be solved,” Lestrade had uttered to John with a sad smile, and then proceeded to read out the details to an unresponsive Sherlock like a father or mother would voice out stories telling of adventure and courage to a frightened child who'd just awakened from a nightmare.
He would whisper softly into his ear and talk of his favourite memories of them together, not just as a couple but as friends as well. Slightly disturbing was the fact that he was lisping throughout these dreams but apart from that it was a small paradise where he simply listened to John's voice and felt the love that exuded right from his pores. Tonight was no different. A while after Sherlock drifted off, John entered his mind palace, dressed in his cardigan and pyjamas, a strange combination but no matter. Sherlock felt John lay beside him as he always did in the dreams, head perched on his elbow to start before slowly making it's way to his shoulder. "I remember the first time I laid eyes on you, God it seems like eons ago. Do you remember that?" Sherlock smiled "Afghanistan or Iraq" It was John's turn to smile then, he shifted closer. "You know, even then you were undoubtedly the most attractive man I'd ever seen, still are." he chuckled softly and Sherlock waited for more.
a pleasant surprise. Unlike you my choice of partner was based on much less superficial things." Harry scowled, the frown darkening her features, aging her by many years. She smiled sweetly, and Sherlock held back the grimace that was fighting to break across his cool façade. "Who tops? I bet you're always at it, if what I remember about Johnny's habits with women is still standing then I'm surprised you're able to sit down right now. Ain't that right Johnny boy?" John shuddered. The last person apart from his big sister to call him that had wanted to kill him, Sherlock and two of their closest friends. The name didn't sit well with him at all. "Harry come on, why are you asking these questions? It's really none of your business in the first place." Glaring challengingly at his sister John sat with arms folded, becoming Captain John Watson of the fifth Northumberland fusiliers once more.
Dinner was going about as well as Sherlock could have expected. Mycroft sat across from him, a knowing grin threatening to break across his face that was smothered only for the more important task of stuffing said face with Christmas dinner. Mummy, as vaguely polite as ever, was waiting for them all to finish their first glass of wine before she started in on him Sherlock knew, and Dad was silent, watching him with a curious gleam in his eye as he work ed his way through his plate.
Orabelle thanked the powers that be when she heard happy sounds coming from the hall that signalled her favourite niece and nephew had arrived. With a cordial nod she strode to the door, excusing Mycroft as she passed and grabbing Greg on the way. Mycroft sighed. "Really Mummy, they just arrived. Must we?" she gave him a look that allowed no argument and Greg chatted to the twins he'd stolen from the study, just following along. "Darlings! Come along, I have a request to make of you." Orabelle swept passed a confused John and winked at him as she moved further into the house. "Is she really going to...?" Rora asked and Sherlock groaned. "Of course she is. Ugh!" Still, the Holmes gang formed a trio at the front of the group and lead the way, leaving John to speak with the spouses.
As expected Mycroft looked up, followed by Lestrade who looked down first and at Mycroft's outstretched neck. Mycroft looked across at Lestrade who was already looking at him. Greg took a step forward into Mycroft's personal space, giving him the chance to refuse. Mycroft stood frozen to the spot, eyes wide and back pressed up against the doorframe. In a rush of heady adrenaline because Mycroft was not moving away, if anything he was inviting Greg to make his move, he strode forward and grabbed his tie, pulling their faces together before hesitating for just a moment and then pressing his lips to Mycroft's own with a passion he had kept to himself for too long. Mycroft melted against him, a small groan into Lestrade's mouth conveying his sense of triumph, want, and Sherlock was positive it was the word finally. He and John had been keeping their eyes on each other fastidiously, very pleased that their plan had worked. When they eventually did look back, Mycroft had wrapped his arms around Greg's waist and clutched him against his body. Sherlock coughed and Greg stepped back and Mycroft ran a hand over his lips, looking for all the world as if he was for once completely uncertain of what to do next, or if that had even happened. With a soft smile Greg had held out his hand and Mycroft, returning the smile, took it. "Merry Christmas brother" Sherlock smugly added and John beamed. "Now Mycroft will give you a lift so you two can talk" John ushered the two towards the black car that awaited them at the end of the road. "Thank you John, I think we can take it from here" Mycroft dismissed him as he stared into Lestrade's eyes with a look so deliriously happy and surprised that John couldn't help but smile as he watched Greg open the door for him to get into his own car.
Sherlock could only roll his eyes. He wanted out of the hospital as soon as possible but he did not like leaving any questions he had unanswered. With a quick nod, Doctor Stamford left Sherlock alone once more.
smiled placidly at Mycroft, who's shoulders had finally relaxed once he was certain Sherlock was not going to be difficult. Yes, they had been more civil towards each other recently, but long car journeys had always been a point of contention for them and he didn't want to be on bad terms before they even started this holiday. Once Greg arrived with Anthea/Holly ("Her real name is Lucia John why do you insist on using whatever paltry name she deigns to give?" he'd sighed and attempted to explain that it would be wrong to use her name before he was given it but Sherlock had just snorted about his morals being unbelievable.) there was friendly banter between the men with the occasional quip from Holly and then they were pulling out of London and into the country.
"Mary, I'll make it my business to get them to you before this baby is born if I have to fly them to the hospital in a police copter myself."
Sherlock was quick to inwardly deny that he had let an ordinary being like John Watson throw him off the loop. The two of them had barely interacted, after all. Sherlock would normally flag boring individuals and mundane interactions as
John’s head snapped in the direction of the person whom he wondered had the audacity to think such a silly thing.
Greg smiled at the deluge of files he'd received as he scrolled through them on his laptop in a sitting room in the East wing of the manor. The idea he'd had for his speech had come together like nothing else he'd ever had to do, and he was just making a hard copy to be safe. Mycroft was seated at the desk with his phone in hand, texting away in rapid taps of long fingers and waiting only moments for replies. It had gotten dark quicker than he'd expected it would, he'd been so far out of it that his only indicator that it was late was the sudden noise of children being tucked into beds and serenaded by their parents, and then the commotion of Sherlock being dragged away from John and sent to his room which was a secret that none of them were allowed know the where abouts of to avoid any sneaking. Greg thought it was hilarious, his wife hadn't minded their being separated before the wedding at all, but here was John whispering reassurances and Sherlock being petulant over those same few hours. "I'll just go have a word with John, we should think about sleeping too My, you know, get that all important last batch of beauty sleep before the photos tomorrow." Mycroft made a noise "Thanks ever so for that reminder Gregory, I do not photograph well as it is, but I'm sure I'll look even worse being sat next to you." Greg laughed and pressed a kiss into his hair. "None of that now, I for one think you always look ravishing. Off to bed with you, I'll be in in a little while."
After what felt like eons later, the elder Holmes sibling spoke up. “I thank you for your assistance in this matter, Doctor, but I must ask, what is your association with my brother?”
The next morning, standing by some new police tape, Sally waited for the inevitable arrival of Sherlock and John. As much as she disliked the man, she was not going to begrudge him his happiness by ruining his surprise. The only way to avoid that was to separate him from John and return the box quickly. After thoroughly explaining this plan to Jim, she waited in her usual spot for them to arrive. The cab pulled up and out swept Sherlock as dramatically as ever with John hot on his tails. Sally never thought that she would be thankful for a double homicide but it was exactly what she needed to make this work. While Sherlock swooped over the body in the bedroom, Anderson led John down to the kitchen to examine that one. As soon as they were gone she strode up to Sherlock. "Congratulations... I think..." She said holding out her palm with the box sitting on it. Relief washed across Sherlock's face. "It was gone when I went back for it yesterday. Thought someone had stolen it but apparently not." Sally listened carefully for any footsteps but heard none "I'd put it away now fr-Sherlock, don't want to ruin the whole surprise" His brow furrowed when she corrected herself, and he cracked a small smirk. "Almost did that myself, asked him to get my phone out of my pocket without thinking and very nearly panicked, but it was fine because it was gone. Then I had to panic for a different reason." He chuckled and Sally giggled too, pondering how they usually acted so caustic towards each other and trying to remember why it had become that way. His deductions were harsh yes, and quite rude, but they were truthful and in this moment of camaraderie between them Sally Donovan resolved to repair, to some extent the relationship she'd never had with Sherlock Holmes. "Good luck anyway, I've a feeling he'll be very happy with you." She smiled widely at him and he looked quite taken aback. "Thank you Sally, I do hope he will."
"John!" Sherlock breathed mid-pace "How did you know where I was? Mummy forbid anyone from saying and also why do you have Lestrade's tie on your face?" John walked cautiously over to where the sound of Sherlock's voice came from with arms outstretched and inhaled the scent if Sherlock deeply when he met the wall of flesh and wrapped his arms around it. "I could shoot you through the heart in a crowd with my eyes closed Sherlock Holmes, I know every inch of you, to smell, taste, hear or see. Don't doubt for one moment that I couldn't find you. As for the tie, It's bad luck for us to see each other, but I can't see you can I? Greg's idea. I couldn't sleep." Sherlock enclosed John in his arms too, nuzzling into his hair.
and then shrugged, but his reply was cut off by a gasp as they rounded the corner to enter a massive room filled with instruments of every sort and Sherlock muttering about invading his space as he lifted a familiar violin from one of many chairs. "Sit down, sit down! I waited long enough, your violinist is back, now I demand a performance!" John blinked slowly and walked over to Greg and plopped down beside him. He gave him a glance and looked away only to do a double take at the little suited boys in his lap. "When did you get twins?!" Greg giggled and ruffled their hair "About twenty minutes ago!" He shook his head and resigned himself to the insanity that his life had become. Orabelle sat down and the others followed suit, with the girls making as if they were conducting and pushing their cousins to various instruments. Mycroft sat down at the piano, Sherlock with his violin, Ford at a Cello and Aurora a bass. "Is there anything this family doesn't do?" John asked, awestruck. "Affection?" Sherlock called as he put resin on his bow. "Fun?" Ford followed with a smirk. "Failure." Mycroft said stiffly from the piano stool and Aurora blew a raspberry at his back with an affectionate yell of "Spoilsport!" Soon though they were finished tuning the instruments before them and Mycroft turned and gave the others a nod and began to play a few notes of a soft tune. In perfect time the strings joined in with fast notes and Mycroft played over them with a passion John hadn't known him capable
Sherlock's cheeks were still flaming and John wanted to inflict more damage. He closed the space between them with slow strides, backing Sherlock against the wall and reaching around to his neck, moving his face down to meet his own. Their lips met, innocent at first. A gentle and playful display. That ended when Sherlock pressed John closer to him, holding him in place and moaned softly into his mouth. John's tongue was on Sherlock's lower lip instantly, and there was no hesitation until he was granted access. The kiss deepened until both were breathing heavily and Sherlock had flipped their positions, putting himself in control. His mind palace was buzzing with John, every nonplatonic thought he'd ever had, what he liked, his reactions, like John was the only thing in the world that mattered. In a strange way, he was. Experimentally, he rolled his tongue against John's and if the ensuing pressure against his thigh was anything to go by that was one to remember. Wouldn't be difficult, John was one area that would never have a single moment deleted from his brain. John's hands had slithered under his shirt, stroking his stomach and back, pulling him closer. His mouth was moist and warm against Sherlock's, and he was breathless, heart pounding as he struggled to get closer, wanting more, wanting to be entwined and never let go. He very nearly had his way, John was already succumbing to the light push towards the hay covered floor when there was a quiet cough from the door. John had turned bright red when Sherlock broke away to see Mummy watching them with an intensity in her gaze that would have made lesser men crumble. "Lunch?" she inquired, thankfully not commenting.
John smiled as he circled again, this time stopping with Sherlock's back against his chest and breathing warm air against his neck. Sherlock shivered and then cut off a gasp as John's hand trailed lightly behind it, reaching up into his curls while the other arm spun him around and then John pressed their lips together (He let go of Sherlock enough that he could pull away, he hoped he didn't but he could) and kissed him for all he was worth, and Sherlock responded, in his own clumsy sort of fashion, pressing back against John who began walking him backwards until they hit wall and Sherlock gasped, giving John the perfect opportunity to introduce his tongue to the proceedings. Sherlock let out an utterly inhuman noise that John couldn't help but find unbelievably hot and he growled into Sherlock's mouth in return, sliding his hands down to a well toned arse and lifting, forcing Sherlock to wrap his legs around his waist and bend his head down to continue the kiss, to deepen it further as he pressed the entire lithe body against his own. Those little noises kept escaping and every time John meant to stop he found himself kissing even more hungrily, grabbing handfuls of the ridiculously plush arse at his disposal and immersing himself in the entire little whines for mercy. He could feel everything through the thin layer of dark leggings that separated Sherlock from him and he knew he had succeeded in seducing him, he hadn't quite expected to take it as far as he had but now that he had he was pretty sure he'd like to continue, if Sherlock was alright with that.
A short (too short if you asked Lestrade, not short enough if you asked Sherlock, those helmets were hot as hell) moped ride later and they were in the heart of Venice itself, staring at canals and gondoliers in the hustle and bustle of the main square. The beautiful architecture of the city surrounded them on all sides, and John couldn't help but photograph them all on bridges and statues, walking and laughing as they explored the city and bought ridiculous souvenirs of masks that wouldn't have looked out of place in a child's dress up box, eating in authentic Italian restaurants and relaxing as a they were swept and serenaded  along the river in gondolas. That was all before the night life of Venice even awoke, drawing them in with hypnotic rhythm and a siren's call to dance, the pulse and throb of music racing through bodies as they crowded the  square,  all glistening in the moonlit plaza.
John laughed breathlessly into Sherlock's shoulder as they swayed much more softly now on the floor. "I knew you'd be able to dance but where did all that come from?!" Sherlock twirled them both around and cradled John to him just a bit more, yet another guest taking a leisurely stare at his arse in those trousers. "I confess that I always had a certain passion for dance, I only gave it up because it became both too time consuming and towards the end a bit... emotionally charged for me. Still, it appears my love of it has gone unchanged." John inhaled Sherlock's shirt and smiled into his chest. "You're bloody good at it, thank God we won't have to go to ruddy dance lessons for the wedding anyway."
Sherlock quivers in his arms, overcome already, and John strokes his back gently, simply holding him and waiting for an answer.
It was a good idea certainly, starkening the elements of the dance to just three or four characters: The white swan, the black swan, the prince and potentially Rothbar if he could find someone up to the job.
Mary Morstan told Sherlock and John she was pregnant on the 28th of February over Skype. She and John had wept, while Sherlock, ever poised, had let a few graceful tears trickle down his face and clutched John to him with every ounce of strength he possessed. He'd been sceptical when they'd first went to meet Mary, understandably so, because seriously it's a pretty massive step from jewels to pharmacy last time he checked but the opportunity was one they didn't want to miss. John's easy banter with her and Sherlock's well... being the least offensive version of himself for the most part had made the meeting feel smooth and easy, like (Sherlock imagined) they were all three old friends. Her terms had been very reasonable: She needed money for university, no more no less, She didn't need visitation because this wasn't her baby at all (but if they wanted to keep in touch she was happy to), and finally they were banned from using any part of her name. When the meeting was over, contract signed, and a date arranged Sherlock asked about the jewellery thing. She'd smiled and beckoned him closer with a giggle. "I really needed a job and they hired me. Plus the discount is pretty phenomenal." He'd chuckled to himself all day after that, and she'd told John, much to his chagrin, that he was a "keeper".
Sherlock had barely finished getting dressed when the phone rang. It was Lestrade. "JOHN! We have a case!" Sherlock practically jumped out of his seat. John tried to calm him down but it was rather half hearted. The gleam of joy in Sherlock's eye was a welcome sight and it made his whole face light up. He became increasingly impatient as John began dressing at an average pace. Sherlock was raring to go. John felt that familiar burst of exhilaration as he clambered into a taxi outside baker street. Sherlock was not far behind him and much to John's surprise, rested his hand on John's thigh. John entwined their hands and pecked Sherlock on the cheek, enjoying the light pink colour his neck turned. Sherlock turned his head so they were face to face and smirked "No half measures John" and he pulled him in for a kiss. It was different this time around, more passionate, it was the type of kiss that eluded to something much more devious. Neither of them noticed the car pulling to a halt at the police tape until a couple of minutes had passed and there was a knock on through window. Sherlock pulled away, sighing dramatically. John rolled his eyes as they got out of the taxi.
grab the key to the door, which Sherlock unsurpisingly pulled from a knot hole in the trunk and handed to John without question.
Sherlock sat stoic on the opposite side of a small table to Jim Moriarty. They had both been dead for a few years now, but this was to be their penultimate meeting. Sherlock had spent every waking minute on the trail of every single person who could be involved with Moriarty. Each of them had posed a new threat, but after three years of traveling and hiding and killing, he was finished, save one. In truth Sherlock had known after the roof that Jim had faked it too, he had chosen to ignore that particular fact in favour of chasing down any helping hands. If he didn't have the man power Moriarty was nothing special, he wouldn't be one to get his hands dirty directly. Yet here they were, yet again, together on the roof of hospital. "Fitting, isn't it? You know I like to make a performance out of it all! We have so much history here, don't you agree Sherly?" Jim pursed his lips and leaned forward on his elbows, putting his chin in his hands. "Awfully quiet aren't we? How about a video to get you more vocal hm? I made this one myself, watch it every night before bed" He pulled out a laptop and tilted the screen so both men could watch. "Are you ready? Oh it's so good!"
"If I may interject? Harry here is feeling vulnerable, her situation with her ex-wife comme girlfriend is tenuous and her sex life has been non existent for a while now. She assumes that as she takes the dominant role in most all of her relationships, you too would be dominant. However - to answer your question Harry - she has no concept of the importance of
“Oh.” Sherlock’s dejection was palpable, and John wished he would just turn around and see the evidence staring him in the face.
It occurred to Sherlock then that very rarely did doctors do minor tasks such as the replacement of bandages - minor procedures like these can be left to the nurses.
“I take it this means you wish to remember it?” Watson chuckled lowly, stalking across the room to meet him.
John cursed under his breath as Sherlock's body went limp once more, the wheels of his gurney squeaking against the linoleum floor as he was pushed straight into surgery. Someone was already pumping air into Sherlock's lungs, trying to assist in ensuring his body receives the oxygen it needs, while another promptly pushes John into the adjoining room to prep.
Lestrade groaned and rolled his eyes. “Can we get to the bit where you just tell me what happened?” he complained fondly, taking a bite of his sandwich.
As the conversation settled to a comfortable plateau (or rather Harry's polite questioning came to a close, Sherlock already knew everything about her) Harry grinned toothily. "So. We all know what I really want to hear about so go on, tell me how you wooed Three continents Watson, world's straightest." Sherlock looked confused briefly and tilted his head to the side. "I don't quite know what you mean. We became flat mates and then friends and quickly it was established that he was my best friend as I was his. Right about the point when I realised that he'd willingly die for me, and that I'd willingly die for him was when it became clear that I had stronger feelings than mere friendship for John. After several tortuous weeks I expressed these feelings to John and he thankfully reciprocated them and now here we are exactly six months, three weeks, four days, eight hours, twelve minutes and fourty seven seconds later." Harry furrowed her brow and looked genuinely taken aback by the response. Sherlock bit his lip and turned to John "Not good?" he asked nervously. It wasn't as if he'd been keeping count he just calculated it based on the time. John smiled and kissed him on the cheek "Very good actually. Remind me to ask you that frequently because it's quite frankly one of the sweetest things you've said to me." Sherlock rolled his eyes, a half smile playing on his lips "Duly noted."
Sherlock didn't look up from his examination of the crime scene photos to reply. “Well while I appreciate that the passive aggressive lecture you're no doubt building up to would be
The arch of his back was incredibly graceful and further down... that robe left little to the imagination. John blushed deeply and sat down, heat radiating from his entire being but specifically towards his lower half. "Morning John" Sherlock called. Even the way he said John... "Jawn" It was completely irresistible John pinched himself and shook his head. Not appropriate thoughts for the breakfast table, especially not about Sherlock. John wasn't even sure if Sherlock was still a virgin or not. "Morning." Sherlock whirled around and in moments there was a plate of steaming food on either side of the table, swiftly followed by tea.
It almost made sense. It explained the brief flare of pain that shot down John’s right shoulder just before he heard the call over the PA system that led him to Sherlock Holmes. The soulmate mark worked in such a way that if one’s intended life partner was dying, the skin around his or her own mark would redden and get inflamed, and in the unfortunate circumstance that said life partner passes away, the numbers on the arm would lose its silver glow and rise on the skin to settle like a permanent scar -- a tattoo; an angry reminder that any subsequent romantic partners would pale in comparison to the lost soulmate and never be fully compatible. Real life couldn’t be any more sadistic.
John's ears pricked up, he thought he heard a voice calling his name but it was far away, almost a whispering. Then again, and again, louder now, unmistakably Sherlock's voice and he was up and out of bed, flying down the stairs and across the sitting room and only breaking his stride as he made it to Sherlock's bedroom door. Sherlock was calling for him, his voice strained tight, each call louder than the last and John had to go in, he couldn't leave the man to face his nightmares alone.
“Well? Any ideas?” Lestrade asked from his perch on the chair at Sherlock’s elbow. A steady stream of cold cases courtesy of The Yard had given both of them something to do.
"It's all going to be different now. Our lives as we know them are over." Sherlock whispers into Johns ear, his chest rumbling against John's back.
When the lights had suddenly switched off in the middle of a fairly rapid getaway attempt, Sherlock had nearly leapt a metre at the arms that had shot out of the darkness and pulled him into an alcove, one finger placed cautiously over his lips. Once he had shown his understanding, John had slowly moved it away to rest with his other hand, which was to say that he wrapped it firmly around Sherlock's hips. In the dark, the distance between his back and John's chest seemed minute, buzzing like electrical currents ran in bridges between spine and sternum.
“No, no, everything’s great.. it’s just.. You remember the kid from the other day, Sherlock Holmes, the one who OD’ed?”
John swung their hands between them as they strolled back to the high street and chaos of familiar London. "For someone so old he seems very open minded. My grandparents disowned Harry the moment they found out she was gay."
"Do you think that means she doesn't expected you at the talent show tonight? Because if not I have a few plans about how my husband and I can put this generous gift to good use." John smirked as Sherlock attempted not to react to the hand on his thigh and the first official use of the word husband between them. In seconds he was up, suitcase in hand and moving out of the rec hall. John picked up the box and followed him, smiling to himself at the familiar sights that surrounded him and wondering how he'd been so lucky as to be sent to camp when he was 14, like fate somehow knew that this place would change his life. And later, when they were spent and sticky and incandescently happy, John too left his mark on Camp Firewood, carved carefully into the slats of the bed on the left hand side of cabin two was a notice for anyone that cared to look:
"First things first. Have any of you ever taken dance instruction before?" John was actually quite surprised when two other hands went up with his own. It seemed to please her at least a little bit. "Not total beginners, that will help. Name and style?" Tom spoke first with a blush. "Eh... Tom Daly, Ballroom?" She nodded and looked to Henry who was rubbing the back of his neck awkwardly. "Henry Knight, Jazz and swing." A small smile flitted across her face at that and then she rounded on John. "John Watson, Ballet." Triumph shone in her eyes and the team gasped in shock. "You were a ballerina?!" John rolled his eyes. "Yes Andy I was a ballerina. Then I took up football and now I'm your captain so I would stand down if I were you." Andy hastily muttered and apology which John graciously accepted and Ms Adler seemed almost gleeful. "Oh yes you'll do just fine. My grand plan to ensure you make the proper effort is to include each of you in our winter expo regardless of the progress you do or do not make. You'll make an effort or make a fool of yourself. Your choice. Those of you who have a style already go sit by the wall. As for the rest of you I will pick. Names quickly." In a state of utter shock they began to name themselves.
John straddled Sherlock, not unaware of the growing tents between them. He wanted this to be something Sherlock would remember, he would make him want to retain every second of this in his mind palace. Still entwined John began to unbutton Sherlock's shirt, his fingers lingering on the alabaster skin of his torso. He pulled it back over Sherlock's shoulders and tossed it to the side. He pushed him back until Sherlock's legs just barely touched the floor. He broke the kiss off and Sherlock opened his eyes, questioning the removal. John held his gaze as he slithered down, opening Sherlock's belt and sliding his trousers off. Sherlock's pupils almost eclipsed the grey of his iris, they both knew that was a first. It was exhilarating. John began to remove his own clothes and soon they were both entirely exposed. John wanted this to be special, an act of love rather than lust. He wanted Sherlock to know that he treasured every part of him, even the damaged ones. With that in mind he rolled Sherlock on his side and lay carefully behind him, wrapping his arms around his chest. His mouth found what it was looking for and he began to kiss every tiny scar that covered his back. Sherlock tensed at first but quickly gave in to the tender movement.
A soft knock at the door and he welcomed his first of the day, a small boy and his mother, no, nanny? Yes, she loved the boy, clearly, but she was impatient, not holding him but his hand though he was evidently ill, she looked more bothered than worried. Sherlock was rubbing off on him it seemed. "Hello there I'm , what seems to be the problem?" The nanny sat the boy down with a soothing pat on the head as he clutched his stomach and sniffled quietly into a worn bear. "He was fine when I arrived this morning to mind him" John silently congratulated himself "and then he threw up some bile. I think he has a fever but the family don't seem to keep anything of use around, no thermometer, no calpol... When he started to shake I decided to bring him here." John nodded and walked across to the boy who was indeed trembling a little in his tiny clothes. "Would you mind awfully if I asked you to sit up on the big bed over there and do a few things for me?" If John wasn't mistaken he could have sworn that the child looked terrified at the prospect. "What's your name, huh? You remind me of a friend of mine actually." and he did, with his dark curls and pale (greenish) skin, he was a dead ringer for a certain detective he was knew. "Callum" the boy called as he clambered awkwardly onto the examination table. "Well Callum, I'm just going to take your temperature, try and find out what's making you feel ill alright? This goes in your ear for a while so we can chat until it beeps ok?" Callum played with his sleeves and didn't reply, his nanny wasn't even paying attention, engrossed in her phone by the door.
Sherlock arrived at the diogenes club in under fifteen minutes, sprinting to the last. Mycroft's lackeys were waiting at the door for him and simply pointed to the farthest door down. Inside Mycroft was staring intently at the screen while Lucia (Anthea as John called her) sat in the corner, texting furiously. Sherlock sat in the chair across from Mycroft and made to turn the screen around but Mycroft's hands stopped his with a soft but firm movement. "Before you watch brother I have to implore you to see past the events and into the setting, the mind of the man behind the glass. It will not be easy, and it will not be pleasant." Sherlock's knuckles were white, his whole body screamed of tension and fear. He nodded mutely and Mycroft pressed a button, sending the projection onto a large screen against the wall. The room (building clearly old, not in disrepair yet, almost empty) was very dark, but the camera was perfectly positioned to catch the only are where light shone: John. He was covered in sweat and convulsing, his whole body spasming. His mouth remained shut however. Sherlock wanted to laugh at his stubbornness, always a soldier his John, even when he's being electrocuted repeatedly... Sherlock tore his eyes away from that and focused on the surroundings instead. The table John was on looked medical or prison grade, more likely medical judging by the height of it. No windows but the door was steel, locker of some sort? Convulsion could be attributed to cold temperature. Sherlock kept wandering back to John, wincing every time the taser hit his skin. Tears welled up in his eyes and his whole body felt hollow, like the whole of his organs had been scooped out. His hand reached instinctively to the screen and rested on John. Mycroft made no attempt to move him.
Cheers in the form of “Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!” and a few whistles erupted from the small group and before he could protest, John was nudged forwards by a helpful and impatient hand and he then found himself quite reluctantly pressing his lips to Mary’s. Her lips were soft, he could grant her that, but frankly John did not like getting interrupted and he was intent on keeping this kiss a short one. He broke it off and shooting an apologetic look at a very disappointed Mary, announced to the rest, “I’m sorry, I just, I have to go see someone--” and shoved open the lounge door to an empty corridor.
John gently placed the last camper on the ground and watched as they scattered out towards the main body of the campsite and well away from the rope obstacles. Which, he supposed, was fair enough given that they'd spent a night tangled in it. To be fair,it was a bit funny to think of them being stuck, and when he'd come to free them he'd had to take a second behind a tree to compose himself before stepping into view.
Strange, isn't it? How the mind is almost constantly at work without us ever realising? I for one do not recall saving the fifty seven various inflections you use when saying my name and their various meanings, nor do I remember inventing a subsequent twelve for how you might say my name if we were to allow what was growing between us to consummate, or was it just me staring at your mouth for hours on end, wondering if it could possibly be a soft as it looked. You have a habit of licking your lips, did you know? I doubt it for if you did you would surely stop and that would be a crime, I could never tear my eyes away from that tiny flicker of tongue pulling across your lips. A very welcome distraction. Some nights, after a very hard chase or a quiet dinner at Angelo's, there would be a moment, a pause so pregnant that even the slightest of movements would break the spell but in those moments, staring at each other in the dark, I could truly believe that you wanted me, in every possible sense of the word. If that is the case then I hope that some day you will forgive me for this, for leaving you so coldly.
"Yes love?" John replied while still managing to kiss his brain into buzzed submission. He was a marvel even still after all this time and Sherlock knew he always would be, that was just who John was.
Soon after that Mycroft and Greg arrived, Using their ID's to gain access as John had once back in Baskerville. "Well?" Sherlock asked Greg, knowing that the answer would be the right one. "Dead. I'll have to take your statement, and John's too. Bloody paperwork" This time Sherlock would bring John with him to do the paper work, even if he had to carry him asleep. "I have had some people update the security in your flat. Nothing major, no cameras but an incident like this will beverages happen again." Mycroft added, spinning his umbrella around in his hands. Nervous. "How is he?" Greg asked, openly concerned. He had seen the injuries briefly when Sherlock had picked John up but they had been unclear, covered by his army uniform. Sherlock hardened visibly, obvious detachment techniques.
He decided to start with number five, it being the simplest and undoubtedly the most useful at this point in time. Oh John, such a wonderful room to be in, even though there are shadows lurking in this room of light, times of fear and disappointment and mortal peril, nothing can cloud the wonder that is John Hamish Watson. Every moment they have spent together, from strangers to friends to lovers to now is rifled through for ideas, it would be fasted if he didn't keep lingering, memories of long nights entwined and heady kisses were very distracting. Still nothing very useful came of it. "Something important... Something symbolic... Something oh yes! That would work! Paired with the, I am a genius!" Sherlock yelled, startling several birds. Now all he had to do was find a way to get it done. It was time for a little chat with Mycroft.
By the time the meal was over Mycroft was feeling much better ( though he hadn't noticed he was feeling bad) and Greg's body hummed with an aura of contentment. "Thank you Gregory, that was impeccable" Greg knew he was being sincere, the brief relationship they had was already teaching him to spot lies at face value. "It's always a pleasure to cook for someone who enjoys it as much as you do" Lestrade smirked to himself and put his hand on Mycroft's. "Sherlock asked me to say hello to you from him and John." Mycroft's lips curled slightly upwards "I wonder how you offended him, he's kept very quiet about our relationship until now." Greg was shocked. "Oh come now Gregory, he solves the unsolvable for a living, tell me how you expected him to miss this?" Of course he knew. Greg thought back to the times he had caught the younger Holmes looking at him with a grimace on his face. Clearly Sherlock had gotten more information about the nature of their relationship than he had wanted. It made Greg smile, serves the git right for looking.
Sherlock pondered a while longer, ultimately coming to the conclusion that the data set he was clinging on to was still irritably
“Look. What are you still doing here? Don’t you have other patients to look after, do what you do best?”
He dreamt it as well as if he were really there, watching himself at 16. That Sherlock Holmes had no clue what was about to happen. Every time Sherlock had to watch himself, yet he could feel everything, see everything 16 year old him was seeing, hearing, thinking. He was standing outside the room he was to live in and there he was, Sebastian
Greg yawned blearily at his desk, attempting for the third time to focus on filling in the report he'd been working on all afternoon. He was exhausted, not that he was complaining about that at all. Magically, he'd been given over a week off this year, and today was his last before the holidays so he really did need to do the damned report but every minute that ticked by just made him want to do it less. There was a confident knock on his door and he jumped, scrambling to make it look like he had been working. "Calm down Lestrade it's only me." Sally chuckled as she swept into the office and dumped a coffee in front of him. "Come on, you need a break." Greg sighed and leaned back in his chair, propping his feet up on the desk. He'd gotten much closer to Sally since she'd told Anderson off and left him, it seemed that she was a much more confident and generally pleasant person without him, and he without her. Anderson was still an annoying, homophobic dick though. She was the only person he'd trusted enough at the Yard to tell about Mycroft, and while she'd been surprised, she fully supported anything that made him happy, and it was great to have somebody to chat to at work, or to help make excuses when Mycroft visited and he couldn't be reached because they were 'discussing top secret government matters that didn't concern you and please go away now'. Grinning, Sally settled cross-legged into her chair and pulled out a doughnut which she split in half "You get what, a whole week off?" she queried, licking sugar from her fingers. Greg smirked "Eight days actually, Nine if you count the fact that I'm leaving here in about an hour." Sally groaned "Lucky bastard! I need to get me a nice respectable government running boyfriend that wants to whisk me away to his family manor for the holidays." He nodded in understanding, the Mycroft effect was pretty astonishing, and he could remember a time not so long ago where that had pissed him off royally. Greg sipped his coffee gratefully and lost himself in thought, looking fondly back to when he'd first been kidnapped to meet the older brother of a drug addicted kid that had helped solve a few cases while high as a kite he'd convinced to get clean in exchange for access to crime scenes: Mycroft Holmes. "Oi! Lestrade! You in there? I said you'd better pack this stuff away now if you want to be ready in time for Mr. 'Take you to my country estate with a stable after I finish a quick game of croquet with the Queen'. Sally chuckled at Greg's blush (she didn't know just how accurate that statement was. Seriously. It happened. Thrice.) and wished him a merry Christmas before sneaking out of his office and back to her desk. He really should have finished those reports, but it was quite satisfying to just pop them in a drawer and know that he'd not have to look at them for a week.
John Watson had taken to a rather odd hobby. It was not like he had begun it with the intent to continue, but he found he couldn't really stop himself. John had taken to talking to Sherlock while Sherlock was asleep. There were two main reasons for it. The first being that Sherlock had an adorable little lisp that only presented itself when he was either drunk or asleep and the second being that Sherlock was at his most open while he was sleeping.
“John would gladly have me out of his hair.” It took a split second for Sherlock to realise what he had just said.
"Well Holmes Sherlock Holmes, what brings you to the workplace of Watson John Watson? Or rather, just John?"
There was a slowness to Sherlock's thoughts that pointed strongly at something like chloroform or maybe rohypnol, but how would he have ingested.... Sherlock's train of thought trailed off. If this was how it felt to be normal, Sherlock didn't wonder at the fact that the Yard was incapable of solving of crime: Their brains were like warm paste... Wait...The Yard! He should definitely text Lestrade, Sherlock reasoned, Or maybe Mycroft, rummaging in his pockets for his phone, that way someone would come and pick them up, probably with some of those ridiculous shock blankets. He  delved deeper into each pocket, his suit jacket, his trousers - Nothing, only some lint and the silk lining. He clearly had underestimated Henry Long, because without a phone, with no idea of where they were, pretty much no brain power to work it out,  and John still unconscious, Sherlock was in trouble.
“My car will drop you back to your hovel. Mind that you are properly dressed when I come to collect you on Tuesday - there are some sights that even I do not need to see.” Mycroft drawled as he led Sherlock to another one of his unmarked black cars and held the door open for him.
Sherlock wiped a hand across his brow as he sat surveying the equipment shed he had just finished organizing, leaving everything back where it could be found next summer without his help. The wooden shed had been like a sanctuary for him, away from the pressure of Irene and the theatre, dark but cozy with it's single lamp light and his own territory even though he wasn't exactly sporty, his organisation skills were second to none. An inventory sheet pinned to the wall next to a birds eye map he was drawing the only way he could think of to try and ensure the job was done properly in the future and that his mark was left on the camp in the form of his system. It wasn't a massive thing but it was something for the camp to remember him by, a return of the fact that he would never forget Camp Firewood. He was just about finished his map when the sound of the door closing gently made him turn with a smile.
“What a cruel place this is to find the one you’re meant to spend the rest of your life with, only to have him slip through your fingers, yeah?”
Sherlock cleared his throat. His voice still sounded gravelly and barely audible to the point that John had to shift closer to hear him. “You're addressing me as if I'm an acquaintance instead of your patient. Do I know you, doctor?”
"John!" Sherlock's unique baritone floated towards him and John knew he was being petty and ridiculous when he sped up because Sherlock would a) not even have to change his pace and b) had no idea why he would be so upset but he wanted to do something at least, put on a show of evasion even if he never could avoid the man even if he wanted to."John."
As soon as John had started walking in his direction, Mr Holmes’ eyes had locked on him, a piercing gaze that felt like it was looking to the very core of him. It was a bit disconcerting, but John soldiered on and came to a stop at the end of the bed.
It had never been harder to stop himself from reaching out to touch, from wondering in idle moments if, underneath the layers of armour and shoes, perhaps Sherlock was wearing his gift, enjoying something that John had given him.
While the landscape of the streets occasionally changed with old shops closing and new ones rising to take their place on the high street, for the most part there was nothing to amuse him en route except for the pedestrians.
"I think next time" John laughed when they were a secure distance from the building "we should probably try not to interact with the suspects in their own warehouse." Sherlock half bit back his answering smile as John looked up at him with a grin on his face.
'I trust everything went well. Goodnight Inspector. MH' Goodnight indeed, the cheeky git Greg smiled to himself as he rolled into bed and grabbed some duvet before John could hog it all.
John sighed and inwardly wondered if God truly hated him because only a sick minded bastard would do this, dangle Sherlock in front of him, but it wouldn't be real. None of what they did would be real, no matter how much he wished it was. He was fucked. "Okay. Right. Fine. Well then um. When are we...?" John was blushing too, great planes of crimson mapping his face. Sherlock gulped and thought about it for a few seconds "I guess tonight, we'll have to get a camera." John stayed put, eyes locked on the horizon. "Right. Will I go or do you want to?" Sherlock simply stood up and walked out, trying and failing not to think that in a few short hours he would finally be getting John, but that it was all fake.
“Look at this. Look at them all, lying there utterly placid. I can't-” He let out a frustrated groan and his hands migrated to his hair, pulling at it fiercely. John winced for him as he continued. “I can't take it! My mind is like an engine spinning out of control without anything to fuel it, I'm so bored I may actually resort to murdering someone
John rubbed his arm gently and moved away to make tea, a solution for every problem. "Well" he called back from the kitchen "You have time to think about it right? Whatever you want to do Lock I'll do, ignore it if you want, I'll happily go with you if that's what's worrying you" John popped his head back out the door "You know that right?" Sherlock smiled wryly at him. It had been worrying him. Their relationship had only been going on for two months and four days now, and they hadn't really been out in public as a couple yet. Cases didn't count and dates were spent inside the flat or at Angelo's so in reality most people didn't have a clue that they were any closer that they'd been two months ago.
to moan and whinge about how bored they were even if they were thoroughly enjoying themselves. It was tradition - first Mycroft would complain about the hours dragging on, then Sherlock would bemoan the lack of murders, Mycroft would threaten to murder
Sebastian had stormed in after a long night partying and crushed Sherlock against the wall. Sebastian's hands were down his jeans and loosening him and before long he was writhing against Sebastian. It was rough and terrifying and Sherlock's first time and yet it felt amazing and he was coming and Sebastian was coming inside him and in the dark of their dorm room Sebastian dumped Sherlock on the floor and clambered into bed, leaving him confused yet satisfied and yearning for more. It was always sudden, like an onslaught of sleet on a cold day. Sebastian would arrive in and Sherlock would be bent over couches, against walls, over the table. He never saw the anger in Sebastian's eyes as he took him from behind every time without fail. Sebastian did not caress Sherlock, or kiss him or touch any part of him except his hips or his hair. A part of Sherlock needed him to. His touch would mean his approval and Sherlock so desperately wanted his approval. The idea of himself being so blind made him furious. Approval was for idiots, and Sebastian was not the type of person who's approval he should have wanted. The scene changed yet again. Sherlock began to quiver. He was afraid, still, after all this time, of what came next.
"Where are we headed exactly Sherlock?" Sherlock gave John the how-on-earth-have-you-not-figured-it-out-yet stare before launching into a brief overview of why they were going to the West London Christian brothers church. John peppered the conversation with various brilliant and amazings. Sherlock made the executive decision to keep one small inkling to himself. He needed to see the man for himself to know for certain, and he wanted to be positive. The taxi pulled to a halt outside the modest stone building and John quickly payed, jogging to catch Sherlock as he made his way to the park bench across the way. A stake out would be perfect, plus it was almost sunny and would be warm for another few hours at least.
It acted as a reminder maybe that no matter how much he hated him, Mycroft had always been there, and would be again and again. The one person he could genuinely depend on to have his best interests at heart. Didn't stop him from being a meddlesome, interfering, know-it-all berk of the highest order, and Sherlock would be damned if he was going to stop antagonising his older brother now, but this he would acknowledge, here in the safety of a small dark room with only his thoughts to occupy him.
"Tea?" he called out to Sherlock who had picked himself up off the floor too and was currently strolling towards their room. "It's a hot beverage considered to be quintessential among English and Irish natives. What about tea John?" John rolled his eyes "Do you want some or not, cheeky git" he added as Sherlock appeared in the doorway laden down with some clothes for John. "You love me, what does that make you?" Sherlock smirked as he handed John the pile. "An idiot who loves a cheeky git?" John asked as he pulled a clean jumper on over his head. "Precisely" Sherlock laughed and opened the fridge. "Erm John? We appear to be out of milk." John sighed and tightened his belt around his waist. "Come on then we'll get some from Mrs Hudson, and no whining because I know you poured it all out to make space for the arms that you took home." Sherlock smiled guiltily and John took his hand, leading the way out the door."Seems like life wouldn't be complete without waking up to an assortment of limbs in the fridge." he quipped and the faint trace of guilt faded away as they stood waiting for Mrs Hudson to open her door.
sidled up to him, his eyes cold. Young Sherlock was enthralled by him. Understandable, Sebastian was a perfect specimen. Athletic build, sallow skin, short chestnut brown hair and those eyes. Ice blue, almost grey. He was a genius, Sherlock could tell right away and he was drawn to him. In his research late at night while Sebastian was away he figured out what it was. He had a crush. That was fine. He could deal with that, it was what happened after a solid week of not seeing Sebastian again that changed things.
Living alone again had been awful, constantly forgetting that he was alone and talking to a John that wasn't there had taken its toll each time it happened, but in his mind the punishment was one he deserved. He'd let John down time and again and this last betrayal had been two years long. He deserved to be alone.
, Sherlock would tell him to at least make it worth his while, and at that point Dad would threaten to murder both of them if they didn't stop bickering. He had missed it while he was away.
Late into the evening the family were sprawled in the study, reading (The Holmes' and Holly) and napping (Greg and John) when the seemingly thunderous noise of the door knocker split the silence, jolting all from their restful states. Orabelle perked up immediately but if anything Sherlock shuffled further into the corner he had chosen. "It'll be fine" John soothed, "I'll be here." It was a comforting thought to be sure, but clearly John didn't understand the Holmes family very well (with one very obvious exception) because the influx of snotty aristocratic types that were waiting outside the door for Sebastian to open it was immense and frankly quite horrid to be around with two notable group exceptions - the majority of the children, and Sherrinford and Aurora. He hadn't missed this at all. A horrendously nasal voice wafted in from the hallway "and then he said that he'd sold his stocks months ago for a fraction of what mine went for but of course they did because I have quite a gift for-" Ah. So Uncle Pierre was still alive then. "Wonderful" Sherlock ground out through gritted teeth. John's hand reached for his with a reassuring pat and then swiftly withdrew. The grateful smile he got in return for that was fleeting as the mask Sherlock had worn during the early days of their friendship shuttered across his face again.
"I- I am close, John! John, I'm about to, I'm about to, to, Oh!" White hot ecstasy flooded Sherlock's every sense until all was pleasure and John, crashing over him like waves. The sight of him, lips parted, eyes wide, back arched and skin flushed a dusky pink brought John to the brink, and the taste of him as he spilled on his tongue was all it took for John to join him. John swallowed all that he could, milking him until he began to soften and then finally releasing him before clambering into the chair and allowing him to rest against his chest. Neither man could speak for quite some time.
"Of course I do, I care about you over everyone else including myself,have done since that first case, and I can't envision a life for me that doesn't end exactly like this, the two of us together in some secluded place going grey - or in my case greyer."
When he realised it Greg wanted to kick himself. They'd only been talking about the solution to their problems this morning.
"Sherlock" Edgar whispered as he walked by. "What's going on?" Sherlock shook his head and made their signal for danger quickly with his hands. Edgar, ever calm, simply nodded and sat back in his seat to watch the group. Archie's childlike voice piped up. "What about the invisible man? The invisible man with the invisible knife?" With a thud that seemed like it should have been audible to everyone, Sherlock knew who was in danger, and why. "Vatican cameos." He coughed and watched as John tensed, bending to give Sholto a little piece of paper and whisper "Upstairs. "
John made his rounds once more before the party started, bidding staff who were going off duty a “goodnight and have a Merry Christmas!” and making sure each and every one of his patients were either asleep or comfortable in their beds before removing his doctor’s coat and joining in the merry atmosphere already flooding the staff lounge. Upon entering, at least two voices exclaimed “there he is!” before John was pulled into a group hug with an
When had it become so obvious to his subconscious that Sherlock was a connection he wanted to have? It would have been useful to know he'd already made up his mind a few days ago when he could still have done something about it. How was it that in a few days, the kaleidoscope of issues he had with Sherlock as a potential
"I don't know why we did, but it's pretty fucking fantastic." John beamed as their Holmes' climbed into a small jet.
Mycroft would be ecstatic, he'd have a whole new range of artillery to fire about Sherlock not being a man, and how could he be so quaint. Ugh. He'd tell mummy on top of everything else and subject both him and John to at least two night of intense irritation. They were having this conversation before Mycroft showed up again because the one thing Sherlock would not be able to endure was the smug look on his face. This was going to be very uncomfortable.
Sherlock shooed her away, planting a soft, sweet, apologetic kiss on John's lips. "I'm taking you for a walk in the gardens later and then we'll go home." He took John's hand and lead him back to the house. Lunch was a Thai dish and afterward everyone seemed to have their own plans. Mycroft and Anthea (who had appeared in the background out of nowhere) were discussing work in one corner, Greg was washing up and Mummy was reading. Sherlock was thankful that the others had no plans to tour the gardens, not only would it be a great distraction from reading his past trouble in Greg's puffy eyes and mis-buttoned shirt, it would be some more time with John aside from anything else.
"Tomorrow I thought we might explore for a bit, visit the hives, just the two of us. We can go into town at some point if you'd like, but I would prefer to spend this time alone with you, selfish as it sounds." John huffed a fond laugh into the dark room and Sherlock sighed against his chest and wriggled closer, his curls feathering lightly against John's chin.
This was the bit he had been dreading, because saying it out loud made it that bit more real, like sharing the words with the universe somehow made them into a reality rather than a theoretical he could wish away. He cleared his throat awkwardly, running a hand through the hairs at the back of his neck. No time like the present.
Sherlock cleared his throat, confidence back and looked at the floor, hoping secretly that John would continue after he'd had enough time to breathe. It didn't seem necessary at all, at least not as necessary as kissing him. Right on cue John chuckled and pushed Sherlock onto the couch, threading thick curls through his fingers before pulling his face closer. "This was definitely a better way to end a case than blogging" John whispered before kissing both their nerves away.
Not quite what he'd been hoping for but something nonetheless. "He cares. Not exactly why I'm sitting here at two in the morning though." Sherlock pointedly didn't meet his eye. "He knows I didn't mean that I don't need him." Greg shook his head. "Does he though? Because I happen to have spoken to him just a little while ago and he really believes you don't. Which is mad because if I loved someone the way he loves you I would think they'd need me. After all to earn that devotion from me it would take an awful lot on their part, it would be very difficult to feel that deeply and know that the other person was just indifferent to me." Sherlock snapped and faced him with a snarl "Of course he knows. What would you know about us?"

“Alright, Mycroft it is. Look, I am a doctor, alright, and it is my job - no, sod that - my passion, and drive to see these people leave my care healthy and whole that I am absolutely willing to do anything,
Taking deep breaths, John set to work, eyes ablaze with grim determination as he quickly sent his team every which way, handing him tools, taking charge of mechanical breathing, warming Sherlock's body up. The nurses and doctor assisting him knew what kind of doctor John was; he would not let a life slip through his fingers without first putting in his utmost best to save it. Even when the odds of survival were slim to none, no one questioned his efforts.
He was just finished when the door opened and Mycroft strolled in. Sherlock scowled into the sofa cushions. Not who he wanted to come through the door right now. "Sherlock I must admit I was rather surprised when I saw you on the tapes, running about by yourself after a mad man, but then of course I remembered it was you and the scenario seemed... Appropriate. I must say that I did wonder where had gotten to, I know he would not be pleased to learn of your current condition, especially when he's already a slave to his emotions where you're involved." Mycroft smirked, twirling his umbrella in a manner that made Sherlock want to punch him. "Don't talk to me" Mycroft laughed dryly as his phone buzzed in his pocket "It's not me that you should be worried about talking to" he said putting it to his ear.
"Oh." he says, although that doesn't quite convey what he is imaging. That Sherlock had a friend at all was a miracle, but to receive a letter like this would have been destroying for anyone. "Go ahead." Sherlock nudged him and he coughed. "6th September 2013. Dear Mr Holmes, It is with great displeasure that we must inform you of the fact that Captain John H. Watson has been wounded in action and is currently in critical condition, but has stabilized after surgery to remove a bullet and shrapnel from his shoulder. His wounding came as a direct result of his diligence in his work and his attempts to save the lives of his men. He has served his Queen and country with integrity and heart and for that we are eternally grateful. Therefore it is with regret we must also inform you that due to his injury it is unlikely he shall return to service after he recovers. Once the initial recovery is completed he will be sent back to England, on approximately the 14th of November. Kind regards, Marcella Price (Liaison officer). The 14th... That's today- Ohhhh. That's what this is all about? Well you could have said that you were meeting your friend to welcome him back from Afghanistan" he chided, but still looked rather serious. All the officers were silent, some teary eyed as they looked at the smiling faces John had drawn, other's at the cruel reality of his story: even heroes get left in the dirt.
Everything was suddenly softer, the light, the skin where they were connected, John's eyes, his voice. "Sherlock. Let me take care of it, after all I am your doctor." He huffed a laugh and Sherlock, suddenly incapable of speech, swallowed hard and nodded his assent, allowing John's hand to lead him back inside and onto the edge of the bath.
John awoke in a dark room, the sound of dripping water tethered him to reality once again. He tried to move, but he could only struggle slightly against the belts that held his limbs in place. The fabric against his skin was very much familiar. He tried to raise his head but found that was impossible. He could however just barely see himself in the mirrored ceiling. The army uniform. Of course. Tiny red lights pulsated from various points around the room and John could tell instantly that they were cameras. A door creaked open and he tensed, preparing for what was coming. The clack of steel wheels on stone flooring caught his attention. As Sebastian wheeled the trolley of implements around so he could see them John wondered if he'd be as susceptible to torture as everyone else was. They had been briefed on it in the army of course but that would mean Sebastian knew what he would expect, what he would be doing to cope and how to get around that. He had had this nightmare before.
He could say no to Mr Holmes’ request, buy himself time to get acquainted with Sherlock. Time to decide if he wanted to make the first move. However, something about the man’s demeanor screamed
"We know about what you two did today and we just want to let you know that we are outrage-" Sherlock and John braced themselves for it, the rant that would out them to the entire camp and ruin not only what should have been a perfect day but also two very good friendships. "-Eously happy for you guys! If you'd told us sooner Greg would have switched bunks with you ages ago! We figured that you should get to spend your last night here together so we gathered up all of your stuff for you Sherlock and you guys can have cabin two all to yourselves, Irene already agreed to him swapping in for you in her cabin, and Greg has plans with Molly anyway and I have them with Abbey so two'll be empty and we pushed the beds together so that it's bigger for you guys too. We'll go now, leave you to it and all that." Mike spat quickly, attempting to keep from drawing too much attention by moving away very fast. "Congratulations, seriously.We didn't see it before but you guys kind of just fit, as weird as it is to think about, you make a good couple." Greg added at a whisper as he walked away, leaving John and Sherlock astounded with a suitcase and a blessing as a gift they couldn't hope to return.
He was worried, a deep seeded root in his stomach about this whole situation. As he fell into the front seat of the patrol car he wondered if texting Mycroft would get him hit by the younger Holmes. John was evidently exhausted when they reached Baker street. His eyes drooped low and Sherlock could tell his shoulder ached. He shepherded him straight to their room and watched while John fell calmly into sleep in minutes. The episode had probably taken a lot out of him. His phone buzzed, Lestrade needed his deductions from today and a statement from last time plus an incident report for pushing Anderson down a flight of stairs. John would sleep the night and Sherlock was better off going where he wouldn't disturb the slumber. He planted a soft kiss on his head and turned on his heel. John didn't wake when he slammed the door, nor when the window creaked. He didn't wake when the door to the bedroom was swung open. He did wake to the feeling of cold steel against his neck and one blue,one brown eye peering into his own. "Hello captain."
The taxi ride was a short one by their standards, with the two of them sitting in amiable silence, each avoiding staring at the general chest area of the other. Before they even rounded the corner of the club John could feel the bass vibrating in his chest. It had been a long time since he'd felt that pulsating need to respond to the rhythm, to just go with it. He remembered now why he didn't go to clubs, because he really did not have any control over his actions when he was there. It had gotten him a lot of attention in the past and Harry was the one who suggested that maybe it wasn't the best idea. Which was true, John could see her point of view, after all anything that stemmed from those nights tended to be superficial. Now though he couldn't just back out, and yet his self control was seriously lacking when it came to a heavy bass line. Maybe that's why he liked Sherlock's voice so much...
When he could once again form a coherent thought Sherlock managed to let out a strangled sentence. "Bedroom now" He was in the air in an instant, legs wrapped around John who's mouth returned to his as he carried him to his room. They fell on the bed and John was taking off his shoes and then his shirt and Sherlock followed suit until both were stripped bare. John was staring at Sherlock open mouthed, admiring the alabaster perfection that was his body. Sherlock had quite a view himself, he wondered how he never noticed that John still did his army workout. "Do you want to do this or..." Sherlock untangled that sentence in a few very confused seconds. John meant was he ok with what they were doing and going to do or did he want penetration. "This is perfect" John smiled and pressed back against him, licking all the way up his neck from collar bone to ear lobe.
John felt his face go red and he gave a little “hmph” before setting about to finish the rest of the appendectomy on Mrs Collins. Later as the patient was wheeled into the post-surgery ward and John had disposed of his gown and was scrubbing his hands away, Paula sidled up to him, a soft look on her face.
"Andy Dwyer, James Matthews, Paul Simon, Russell Davies, Steve Mofatt, Mark Gatiss, Andrew Scott, Sam Smith, Bill Murray, Tony Garcia and Michael Flatley." Each boy got a once over before she made her decision. "Davies, Moffat and Gatiss you'll be joining Mr Knight over there for Jazz and swing in room 10. Flatley, Scott and Dwyer you three will be Irish dancing, room 25. Smith, Garcia, hip hop, 12. Murray, Matthews and Simon will dance contemporary with me in room 8. Daly ballroom is in room 3. As for Captain Watson I have a few things I have to sort out. The rest of you go, I trust Coach Lestrade will accompany you to ensure you don't get lost?" A quirk of one perfectly shaped eyebrow and they were off out of the room, with the coach who had been leaning against the wall chivvying them along.
An hour and a half or so later, most of the packages had been opened. A few they had left purposely to the end; gifts from Sherlock's family, the Yard, Clara and Mary. Cookware, scientific equipment, 'his and his' everything and gift cards for everything from Tesco to airlines had left them wanting for nothing of that nature for the foreseeable future. The stack of congratulatory cards was higher than the table was, coming from fans and friends alike they had at least a solid hundred, if not more. John was pretty sure the letter opening knife had never seen so much action.
There were three crucial details about which Sherlock was completely certain. The first: that the Yard were utterly useless when it came to catching criminals, even when you gave them all the necessary information to do so. He'd have to get on the case himself somehow before they let this smuggler slip away. The second: Nurse Mary was harbouring feelings of an amorous inclination towards John and hoped very much that his thoughts were in line with hers. This thought left him in a foul humour every time it crossed his mind for some reason, but possibly related to the third, and in his opinion at the moment, most important point: John Watson was avoiding him, and he had no idea why.
Uncomfortable though it had been while nursing monstrous hangovers, they had hashed out everything and anything they could think of, with Myc tentatively voicing his own self doubt and need for human affection (Greg gets the feeling the man might have still been a little drunk after the champagne breakfast)  and Greg admitting his fear that Mycroft was ashamed of his piece of rough sometimes. In the week that the newlyweds had been gone, a lot had changed between them. For the better,Greg thought as he caught Mycroft's eye in the rearview mirror and watched as they crinkled up in a smile.
to do…” Words flew out of his mouth faster than a steam train and John chuckled fondly at his vehemence.
"I can't believe he's hiding all that from the world, I mean, I'd give him a go and I don't swing that way!" Dimmock said in awe from his left and Sherlock felt his stomach clench. There was a chorus of agreements, "I mean I love my husband but... he's no Watson." "He was in the army too... dya think he likes to like, give orders in bed? because I am so up for that" "I wonder if he still has those pants? Maybe he wears them sometimes, underneath his clothes, and none of us would know!" Sherlock's head was buzzing with all of these new (intriguing) hypotheticals. He had never been in John's underwear drawer and John did their laundry so the pants could truly be in their flat, and as for any predilection for taking charge of a sexual partner... well didn't that just make his blood effervese.
He'd just finished up clearing his desk a bit when there was a sharp rap on the door that he'd gotten so familiar with he didn't even bother inviting them in he just hopped up and wrapped them in a hug. "How are you then…?" Lucia smirked "Holly this time Greg" he laughed "Festive." Ignoring the stares the two of them were getting, Greg held back the urge to skip along excitedly as they made their way out to the car that held Mycroft. Lucia had been busy, astoundingly so, the amount of work she had to do had meant she hadn't seen Greg at all since sending Mycroft home from Vienna. Even now she was tapping away at her blackberry, scheduling, checking the news, spying and hacking with ease. "Busy I take it then Hols?" Lucia laughed, a high tinkle that never failed to make Greg smile too. No matter what name she chose, Greg would abbreviate it, just to be contrary. "Quite. The more time he spends at home, the more time he doesn't spend on the phone with the government in Uzbekistan. Not that I begrudge him, anyone, that, just, piles the work up a bit more. It'll be fine again after the holidays, he always gets antsy for work during the holidays." Greg nodded along seriously. Mycroft was an important man, Sherlock hadn't been lying all those times he called him the British government, Secret Service and CIA on a freelance basis and his work was his life. No one else in the world could do what he does. The lift chimed and the pair stepped out talking of lighter things, and generally messing about as friends do. Stepping out into the open air was like a slap in the face. "Christ it's freezing!" Greg cursed and pushed forward through the snow to the idling car that awaited them. "Greg?" Lucia chirped. "Yeah Lu?" "Sherlock and John are in the car." He whipped round and to her credit he mused, she had the decency to look mildly ashamed that she'd kept that quiet until now. He loved both men obviously, but journey's with them were hellish enough when they were off to a crime scene, Which was why he was more than happy when the detective duo came along after him. Sighing, Greg tried to console himself with the knowledge that Mycroft was in there too. His eyes widened as the reality of that statement, Sherlock and Mycroft in a confined space, dawned on him. Dear God this was probably already a minefield. However, he wasn't made a DI for nothing, so Greg opened the side door of the 4x4 and his jaw nearly dropped at the sight of a sleeping Sherlock and a relaxed Mycroft. John grinned at him and gestured to the curly head in his lap. " Sleeping tabs" he whispered "he'll be out until we get there." "Dr Watson here endeavoured to make this trip a bearable one for us all." Mycroft added and pursed his lips in the way that Greg knew meant he was holding in a smile. Greg and Lucia clambered in and soon they were whizzing along the roads, somehow avoiding the worst of the traffic.
Convincing John to come to Angelo's for dinner was easy, and the new shirt and tie Mrs Hudson had chosen were put to immediate use (He'd called John a suck up, and John had laughed up at him, happy out.) and the three of them traipsed to their regular haunt in good spirits, with John completely unsuspecting.
Tonight was no exception. Sherlock looked around the world his mind had created. Everything was bathed in crimson light and Sherlock could feel the weight of something in his hands. His violin.
or if Sherlock really was his soulmate. Either way, he would not know for certain unless he let Sherlock see the numbers on John’s own arm.
He distinctly remembered a dinner party his parents had thrown at which he had, aged just four, announced that the Johnsons’ marriage was on the rocks, and rightly so seeing as Mrs Johnson was clearly a closeted homosexual drowning in the sham that was her life. (Despite the fracas that revelation had caused, Eugenia and her partner always sent him a Christmas card, he had one displayed on his bedside locker at that very moment.) At the time he hadn't understood why what he had said was causing such upset, after all the times he had heard that honesty was the best policy, new rules seemed to come into play.
It is... Harrowing. I love the mystery, the puzzle of a case, but these are generally brutal, no finesse or care taken, no genius behind the crimes. I'm sitting in one of the old hide outs I have... Cleared. If anyone were to see me (apart from expressing shock at the fact that I'm not dead) they would surely laugh at the sight. I do not look my self. By way of a disguise I am going unshaven, and wearing clothes that once would only have been good for sleeping in as my everyday attire. People avoid eye contact with a homeless man you see, and they can slip by unnoticed into the strangest places in the world. The real reason for their mirth would undoubtedly come from what I am writing in. It belonged to Molly not so long ago, but she gave the fluffy pink monstrosity to me as a parting gift and instructed me to use it as I am now. These thoughts are not going to cease simply because I have written them down, that would be ridiculous. No. But perhaps, in the future, if you see fit to forgive me for this, I will give them to you, my letters to you I suppose is what they are.
Standing in front of the full length mirror Mycroft put his arm around Sherlock's shoulders and smiled at their reflections. "I'm proud of you Sherlock, and I hope that being married to John makes you as happy as you could possibly be. Neither of us expected this day would come, but we've both found something, someone, worth changing everything we've ever known for. Perhaps being wrong isn't quite the catastrophe we believe it to be. Think on it anyway. They're on their way back, Try to stay calm. Oh, yes, John said to tell you he loves you or some other such sentiment. I'll see you down there." Sure enough Mycroft had barely rounded the corner before Mrs Hudson had swooped in, herself in a dark blue dress and cream cardiac that suited her as well as anything she'd have bought herself, but was just fitted a bit better, and moments later Mummy in something similar but the dress was lilac and the cardigan a shawl.
Greg yawned blearily at his desk, attempting for the third time to focus on filling in the report he'd been working on all afternoon. He was exhausted, not that he was complaining about that at all. Magically, he'd been given over a week off this year, and today was his last before the holidays so he really did need to do the damned report but every minute that ticked by just made him want to do it less. There was a confident knock on his door and he jumped, scrambling to make it look like he had been working. "Calm down Lestrade it's only me." Sally chuckled as she swept into the office and dumped a coffee in front of him. "Come on, you need a break." Greg sighed and leaned back in his chair, propping his feet up on the desk. He'd gotten much closer to Sally since she'd told Anderson off and left him, it seemed that she was a much more confident and generally pleasant person without him, and he without her. Anderson was still an annoying, homophobic dick though. She was the only person he'd trusted enough at the Yard to tell about Mycroft, and while she'd been surprised, she fully supported anything that made him happy, and it was great to have somebody to chat to at work, or to help make excuses when Mycroft visited and he couldn't be reached because they were 'discussing top secret government matters that didn't concern you and please go away now'. Grinning, Sally settled cross-legged into her chair and pulled out a doughnut which she split in half "You get what, a whole week off?" she queried, licking sugar from her fingers. Greg smirked "Eight days actually, Nine if you count the fact that I'm leaving here in about an hour." Sally groaned "Lucky bastard! I need to get me a nice respectable government running boyfriend that wants to whisk me away to his family manor for the holidays." He nodded in understanding, the Mycroft effect was pretty astonishing, and he could remember a time not so long ago where that had pissed him off royally. Greg sipped his coffee gratefully and lost himself in thought, looking fondly back to when he'd first been kidnapped to meet the older brother of a drug addicted kid that had helped solve a few cases while high as a kite he'd convinced to get clean in exchange for access to crime scenes: Mycroft Holmes. "Oi! Lestrade! You in there? I said you'd better pack this stuff away now if you want to be ready in time for Mr. 'Take you to my country estate with a stable after I finish a quick game of croquet with the Queen'. Sally chuckled at Greg's blush (she didn't know just how accurate that statement was. Seriously. It happened. Thrice.) and wished him a merry Christmas before sneaking out of his office and back to her desk. He really should have finished those reports, but it was quite satisfying to just pop them in a drawer and know that he'd not have to look at them for a week.
He does what he knows feels good to him, lavishing attention on the fraenulum, swirling his tongue again and again, sucking what he can and stroking what he can’t in as good a rhythm as he can create while he’s half blinded by desire. Sherlock’s balls are high and taut against his body, and he is moaning John’s name so profusely that he wonders if he has time to breathe at all between each one, and John cannot help but touch himself as he watches Sherlock’s iron control keeping his hips still so he doesn’t choke while the rest of him is falling to pieces and melting surely into the mattress. He is by far the most wondrously beautiful being to walk the earth, and John knows now
Sherlock gathered up the used utensils and was just leaving when John called out. "Yes John?" John smirked. "I saw the table on the way in. Apology accepted, although I'm sure Mrs Hudson will be adding to our rent for that. Sometimes I wonder how many ways you can find to melt our furniture... Don't even think about it." He added, seeing the glint of a new experiment in Sherlock's eyes. Sherlock pouted, mouth drooping. John sighed and shook his, head, a slight smile playing on his lips. "We have to buy a new table anyway... Just contain it to the table okay?" "Okay!" Sherlock scrambled out of the room. "And you're buying the new one Sherlock!" John yelled, still smiling. "Yes dear now go back to sleep!" Sherlock retorted from the kitchen, preparing for the second time in his life to melt furniture, the first time had been an accident and he hadn't got a chance to catalogue the results. This would be fun.
"Are you going to sit down or are you just practising for your next stint in the Louvre?" He asked, smirking from behind his laptop screen.
The sudden glow from the screen that had previously been an ocean of black lit only by the luminescence of John's skin attracted Sherlock's eye and in the milliseconds that he could see he gathered an abundance of information. It was a mental institution, John was in the shock therapy sector, which would explain the restraints better. That narrowed down a significant amount. "Move." Sherlock pushed Mycroft aside as he began typing furiously. "That will look fantastic on my browser history" Mycroft grumbled as Sherlock hit search. He knew only four of these hospitals had even existed in London but all of them had been decommissioned years ago. He needed to see inside them all. The first, Greater London hospital for the unsound mind, had been demolished. Unluckily that was the closest one. Sherlock was doing a great job of ignoring what was happening until he heard Greg gasp and turn away. He looked up to see the full extent of the burns John had received. Several blisters littered his skin, but it was the blackened areas that threatened to make him falter. His heart hurt, physically pained him. His symptoms were not conducive to any type of heart failure, and it was clear that this was that ordinary people felt when someone they loved was in trouble. Love... Did he love John? Sherlock put that thought away for later, he could not afford to think about it right now.
Oh don't worry, he feels the same, has done for years according to Sherlock, anyway we're going to help get you together- J
“Doctor Watson?” A timid but familiar voice called to him and he was instantly awake, fully alert in milliseconds. Mary, the newest addition to the on call nursing team, smiled at him from the doorway.
It was already dark by the time John locked the door of the surgery. Sarah had called hours earlier to ask if he would cover for her, and if he wanted to go out for drinks with her later. It was getting harder to pretend that he wasn't in love with his flatmate, but it was also getting harder to live with him knowing that nothing was going to happen. Sarah and John had been dating now for seven months, after she got used to Sherlock interrupting them every chance he got she decided to stay, try and make it work out. It really was working out. John would take her out and she'd take him out and they had a lot of fun together, he couldn't help but smile when she was around. There was a huge part of him that knew if he hadn't met Sherlock and had met Sarah, he would probably be married to her right now. But he had met Sherlock, and now what he was dying to have, he couldn't find in anyone else. No one had that spark, that fire in their eyes that was madly infuriating and yet so attractive that he was speechless, constantly speechless in the presence of his best friend. Most of the time he didn't know what was coming out of his mouth around Sherlock, but for an idiot he seemed to be doing pretty well just spewing words everywhere. Seemed to work.
