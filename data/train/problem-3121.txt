“There’s a plan?” That was Dean again, who was still king of popping back when he wasn’t anticipated.
“Hello, my darling,” said the woman with the long red hair. Castiel gave Jody a long suffering look, and a small, tiny nod of the head in greeting. Jody felt her heart sink and a wash of cold sweep over her. Oh.
“Yes, a brotherly bond apparently manifests in pies and so called friendly insults. Are you sure you’re feeling okay, Dean?”
“Yeah. Don’t worry, we have everything we need. Just might be a little unusual, that’s all.” Balthazar was in full persuasive mode, a little flirty smile at Cas and Dean suddenly felt a whole new type of anger build up in him. That was
“She is normally bribeable in some form,” Castiel replied solemnly. The pen tapped the desk thoughtfully.
“You want to-,” the voice was still deep and gravely but there was a slight hint of strangled to it. Okay, Cas was a fusser.
The please was a surprise. There had been a point where Castiel hadn’t been entirely certain that the word had passed both Winchester boys by in their youth. Dean was also supporting his argument by use of the most appealing gaze in his possession, wide, pleading, and still an element of naughtiness deep within him that spoke to the very core of Castiel’s being.
“You want to know the stupid thing? I was .. happy. No stress, no fears, everything just .. you know. Actually as they’re supposed to be. I had y-.,” Dean’s eyes flickered to Castiel for a moment, clearly debating on what the ending to that sentence, before looking away again. “... I had plans to become the community mechanic, car fixing, that sort of thing. No monsters under the bed. No troubles from heaven or hell. No freaky fuck ups, not that I could remember any of those. Just you, me, house and Sam popping in. How fucking stupid was I?”
The next day wasn’t as smooth as she’d been hoping for. Both boys seemed to be on a massive sugar high after their rest, which was promptly explained when she discovered Dean’s stash of ‘tasty things’. So that was why he was dusty the night before.
“What?” Dean looked down at himself. Okay, he was muddy, but who cared? “What’s wrong with my clothes?”
Sam seemed really determined about his damned symbols, but that was fine. Dean ran his hand through his hair and turned his attention back to Cas. His hand rested on his husband’s leg gently, hoping to soothe him as much as possible. Cas giving him a small fond smile in response made him ridiculously happy, enough so that Dean wasn’t too annoyed when Cas was forced to think about rogue wires again.
“I did.” Sam hesitated. “Okay, it might have been a little blunt, and there was drink involved, but it was discussed at a high level.”
Yeah, everything would have been peachy had it not been for the fact the Community as a whole were clearly interested in them. A little
“C’mon, Cas. Let’s get you home.” Dean pushed himself to his feet and then knelt, gathering up Cas in his arms to pick him up-
“A love spell,” Balthazar repeated, as patiently as he could manage. “So the fluid has to be ..ah, let’s say
“Fuck sake, I’m not suggesting anything. If you and Cas here want your darling brother up and running then the spell to break the other spell will require you and Cas here to have some type of physical loving session - or fuck, as it’s otherwise known - in the middle of this,” a quick stamp on the little circle decoration in the center of the room. “And your come - and it has to be
He should shout out. Tell him that he was here, half hidden in leaves, muddy as hell, just as blood stained as he usually was. And yet Dean couldn’t bring himself to do it, not quite yet. Not while he still had a few glimmers of memories from a point when he genuinely believed the fairy tale that the Community had woven around him, when peace wasn’t just a sound associated with the size of pie portions.
“Okay, okay, jesus Sam, untwist the panties.” Dean eyed him again before grumbling softly and then bringing the engine to life.
Only they didn’t look fine. They both looked stunned, concussed almost, as though they’d entered a Santa’s Grotto and found it full of blood and gore and reindeer parts hanging from hooks in the ceiling. She couldn’t even see Sam properly anymore due to him hugging her harder, and that was disturbing. She automatically made a soft comforting noise as she returned the hug, gently rubbing Sam’s back as he curled into her. If she didn’t know better she’d have said he was scared, but they were back, whole, large again. What the hell were they scared
“Shhh,” Dean held up a hand and returned the smile, carefully shuffling out the door and letting it close a little. Thank god for bushes that meant he wasn’t immediately visible to the road. “Sorry, he’s asleep-,”
“Good boy,” she gently scooped him up, and glanced down at the scared Dean. “Could you pick up the things and bring them in for me, Dean?”
“And you can’t do this in your orgies why, exactly?” Dean felt his throat going a little dry. The angel rolled his eyes.
“But we don’t know when we’d get attacked,” Dean had explained in his little boy voice, so earnest, so cute, so
The deception was beginning to weigh heavily on him. The original concept had been both a surprise and contained a little worry - perhaps his mannerisms would be off putting to Dean, or perhaps he would take these emotional touches too far and cause discomfort - but Sam had assured him privately that Dean was ‘so damned oblivious to the things in front of his nose that there was no risk of subtle behaviours having any effect’. Either way, Dean was aware of the intentional deception.
Dean took another look at the innocently sleeping Sam, gently moved a hair strand from his brother’s eyes and then pressed a light kiss to Sam’s forehead. Right. It would be okay. It had to be.
“Because you ask so politely?” the angel countered, his voice still low but clearly irritated. “Look. I don’t personally care whether your darling little brother dies, and I’m always upset if Cas is upset but I’m sure he’ll get over it. Essentially, if you want me to do something, make me happy or you can just swivel on it.”
“They didn’t say they found him at a bandstand,” Castiel said slowly. “But I believe they mentioned he was semi-conscious and moving by himself for a short time. There’s a possibility that he could have walked a short distance away.”
“Okay.” Castiel watched him re-enter the house before turning back to a desperately trying not to smile Sam. “Don’t.”
“Right!” Dean looked determined and then scuttled away as soon as Castiel released his hold. Jody could already hear him in the dining room poking around in what was probably a thorough but destructive job.
The feelings and sensations within him were undeniably strong, and almost impossible to ignore. Castiel could feel the heat in his lower quarters as though someone had set his underwear on fire, which would be both inaccurate and problematic, and an increasing desire to move, to do
“You can heal me up afterwards if something goes wrong.” Dean wriggled impatiently. The angel lifted his head incredulously.
There was another long silence from the other end of the phone. Jody smiled again. The drawings needed a lot of explanation from both the boys, but they had eagerly expanded on the images.
“Castiel, please, m’begging you.” And he really was, this wasn’t a game anymore. Dean opened his eyes and stared upward at Balthazar in front of him again, still dazed but with a growing need to do
“Hallelujah,” the witch muttered under her breath and ignored them for a moment as they undressed and re-dressed in the largest t-shirts Jody could find. Dean lifted his hand and inspected the fabric that draped over him like a very odd toga.
Dean took a long, confused mouthful of coffee. He was still wearing the trenchcoat, the fabric a little weird against his bare skin, and offered Cas a slightly nervous smile as the man came back bearing some clothes. Jeans, t-shirt, green light shirt. Stuff that made him feel a whole lot better.
Well, it wasn’t a speech, nor was it convincing, but at least it confirmed he understood them. Jody exchanged looks with Castiel and pulled Sam closer to her instinctively. He still seemed happy enough to stay there, silent, and she was more than happy to let him.
Ultimately happy ever afters had always been on short supply. This really shouldn’t have been a surprise.
At any other time he’d probably have raged a bit about that, but here and now he merely grinned and lifted his hips a little higher, an invitation that the angel was happy to take. Their gazes met again as Castiel lined up and Dean felt the broad tip of the angel’s cock against his hole, questioning, confirming, confident.
“For lights? Yeah, probably. It sounded like a zap.” Dean began to check over Cas’ hands and arms for any sign of injury, and was pleased to note they seemed to be as clear as they had been before. “You look okay, no entry wounds or anything. Any aches?”
“I do not. But I have brought us to someone who would.” Castiel glanced briefly at Sam, and then drew back toward the door. “This way. He will be safe here.”
Balthazar looked thoughtful as Dean looked away from him in embarrassment, and then looked up at Cas again in silent query. Dean let out a soft cry of pain-pleasure as Castiel’s next thrust was powerful enough to shove him forward, a beautiful and yet agonising thrust, and his bewildered eyes looked back at Balthazar in dazed confusion on what just happened.
Dean glanced over his shoulder again before carefully stepping over the chain and wandering onto the main stage. Yeah, still a gazebo. Still-
“Good boy,” Castiel was back to nuzzling his neck, breathing in the scents and the sensations as Dean trembled against him and feeling his own body respond just as violently. If storms could be powered by sexual need then they would have taken out mountains by now. Castiel paused to catch his own shaking breath before gently nipping Dean’s neck again gently. Dean groaned softly and let his head tip back onto the bed weakly.
Dean himself was half asleep, his exhaustion comforted by Castiel’s warmth and closeness. Through his daze he was conscious of Cas’ light kisses on his neck and shoulder, the way that his legs hooked over his own and Castiel’s own scent which seemed to lean more toward a light vanilla than the honey musk that Balthazar seemed to favour.
“Oh, pretty damned dumb, Sammy,” Dean snarled back, taking a little step closer. Castiel raised his head as he watched them, but was reluctant to intervene. To a certain extent this was not his place, and for another he was not entirely sure where the brothers would take this. They had been together for many years, it was reasonable to assume they would have found ways to mediate between themselves. Perhaps they might argue and then find a new path for a reconciliation.
“I have not checked whether the cat has taken a shit in the garden, Dean,” Castiel sounded almost concerned.
Panting, aching, Dean slowly lifted his head to see Sam jump from the bandstand and Castiel step forward, the angel’s eyes glowing as his hands rose-
Dean breathed out slowly, forehead still resting on the mud. For one of the first times in his life he hadn’t felt like he was separate to everyone else, that he was
A few hours later and the boys had gone as well. Dean had re-emerged from a long shower, and eaten whatever Jody put in front of him with silent determination. Sam was still quiet but offered her small smiles. And neither of them could look in her direction, not for very long, and the silent pain in their eyes made that just as well.
Sometimes he wondered whether Cas was on the same wavelength as him when it came to the community, but Dean reckoned he could change his mind easily enough. The little narrowed eyed expression that spoke of misgivings could be switched, he was sure. That was the good thing about people trying to do the right thing, it was so much fun to drag them into doing the
“Close enough. And you move around small groups rather than just stay with one.” Dean shrugged. “Usually the type of conversation that occurs between drinks. You know, weather, neighbours, the local cat has taken a shit in the garden-,”
“About something important, Cas. And then let’s head out the door looking like we’re off to do something vital, yeah?” Dean whispered. He was aware of blue eyes studying him for a moment before Castiel gave a little decisive nod, took hold of Dean’s hand like a mother scooping up a small child and gently but firmly tugged him toward the door.
But that was all almost immaterial. Right here, right now, Sam was his priority, and yet it still felt completely out of his hands.
“He is.” Castiel didn’t bother to mention that lack of breathing normally classified as a definite  ‘not okay’. He walked back to the house, conscious of the two women trotting behind him like very tall dogs and both still trying to engage him in conversation. It was not their fault but Castiel felt he had bigger things to worry about, and the biggest was currently safe in his arms with his head resting against the angel’s chest.
you could just act normally,” Sam sighed. “Little acts of affection, sure, but you don’t need to perform as though you’re in the middle of Desperate Housewives.”
Tears pricking his eyes, Dean pulled him into a hug as he tried to work out what to do. He could just feel Sam’s breathing, so very slow but at least he was still
There was a soft noise that indicated that yes, Sam was definitely interested in the bunny. A second later and the fuzzy green bunny was tucked in with him, Sam playing with its ears in fascination.
She looked down at the boy he had handed her. Long, dark eyelashes, soft floppy hair, little limbs that were curled up, and so many small, little things that felt both a long time ago and yet so familiar. Sam stirred slightly, making a soft sleepy noise, before he happily cuddled closer to Jody’s warmth and fell asleep again.
“Well, well. Aren’t you spunky.” Another half smile and Balthazar pressed a kiss to Castiel’s neck before withdrawing enough to allow his angel brother to move. Dean was about to respond when Castiel’s movements stole any words he was planning to make, slow at first but growing in strength and intensity as the angel gripped his hips harder.
Are you happy now? Does knowing that I’m not sleeping make you happy, Sam? Can you shut the fuck up yet?”
Tired, still furious eyes turned to him before there was a soft noise of either laughter or frustration.
Knowing Castiel’s anxiety about the boys’ welfare, Jody had decided to keep a very close track of what they were doing and had obtained a notebook for the task.
“Well, that’s something at least.” The angel moved to the centre and lit a few more candles, murmuring under his breath briefly before picking up a nearby bowl and studying it carefully. It was, essentially, a bowl. Wooden, probably hand carved based on the wobbliness of the surface, and with a few things carved on the outside. Pretty ordinary, as bowls went, but Dean didn’t quite trust the look that Balthazar gave Castiel afterward. Wasn’t a dangerous or scheming look but one that was a little wary, the type a friend would give if they were worried, and what the hell did this ritual need anyway?
It was several hours before Dean began to twitch; Castiel frowned, and became even more concerned when the curled Dean began to make a soft whimpering noise at the back of his throat and pressed even harder into Castiel’s side. Shifting to his side, Castiel gently pulled him into a hug, a movement that confirmed the shiver that was wracking Dean’s body.
“Dean.” Castiel’s voice was faintly chastising, but Dean was clearly past caring and with it had gone the heaviness of guilt. Mouths clashed again, the man’s hand stroking down Castiel’s chest and it felt so very good, a soft groan escaping the angel’s lips as Dean curiously explored with the expression of a small child witnessing something fantastic for the first time. Light fingers traced a line along Castiel’s hardened cock, sliding over an already slick head and then down again to play with his balls.
“Yeah. You definitely miss it when it’s gone,” Sam added. Dean looked from one to the other and then, suspiciously, at the little service box that Sam was threatening to repair.
“Well, yes. Love. Violent, messy, screaming, fixation, dark obsessions, you wouldn’t believe how many horrendous things are done due to love.. Wait.” Balthazar turned to Castiel in genuine delight. “Does your boy really believe in the sweet Disney version of love?”
“Probably better to watch the language until they’re taller,” she advised. “Not that the language should be colourful in here..,”
“Yeah, fine, whatever. Your excuses are bullshit, but I get the ‘no lake’ thing.” he eyed the metal box again. “Just fix the water soon, okay? It’s stopping a lot of things I want to get on with.”
“Oh.” Sam paused again. There were many pauses, and each of them valid. “Uh. Wow. Well, that does sound like he’s getting over his head injury if he’s feeling .. uh, energetic.”
“Ain’t that the truth.” Jody sipped her own drink. No point in asking whether Cas knew how to revert it; it was quite clear that he had been subjected to the baby Winchesters for at least a day by the sheer state of him. No one was going to do that if there was an easy ‘return to adult’ button to press. “How much do they remember? Dean sounded like he knew something.”
Instead Dean pushed himself away, fixed a carefully planned smile and shrugged carelessly, moving into the kitchen and grabbing an apple to bite into.
“Don’t wet yourself, I’m not going to touch you.” he advised. Dean bristled slightly but felt a little more relieved, slowly relaxing back against the floor and watching Cas as his hand slipped down to gently caress Dean’s balls with the same confident movements as before. Balthazar was still present, both hands now on Cas’ shoulders like a particularly dedicated massage, but oddly Dean couldn’t get himself too worked up over it. As long as the other angel was over there and he was down here, things would be okay.
“Perhaps ye olde style bandstands aren’t weird around here,” Dean stretched, completely unconcerned by the situation, before slipping his hand back into Castiel’s again. The angel felt his cheeks redden slightly before coughing and forcing himself to focus again. Sam hid a small, fond smile and looked down at the phone.
“Can we just get him out of here?” Dean was begging and he didn’t care, not now, not ever, and Castiel simply pressed a gentle hand on his shoulder as he focused on Sam’s prone body. Dean hugged Sam a little closer and looked around them just in case something worse was planning to fuck up their night further. Still couldn’t see shit in this space; it was night, any lights in this area being broken, shadows on top of shadows on top of darkness. Wasn’t even a decent surface to put him on, cold and concrete and damp, with the occasional grass growing in the cracks and the rustle of rats somewhere in the background.
“We have obligations,” he said softly, and there was a slightly sulky, rebellious look in Dean’s eyes.
Dean looked at the displaced forest again wistfully. The paths were neatly maintained and they even had some lamp posts that looked like something out of Narnia. Not that he watched those films, of course. At all.
“Balthazar. I would greatly appreciate your help in this. Sam is very important to me.” Cas spoke softly but with an intensity that Dean appreciated as the angel made a tiny step to put himself between Dean and Balthazer. The other angel eyed him carefully and clearly reluctantly before sighing softly and throwing up a hand.
This seemed an automatic situation with them, but Castiel was still coming to terms with the potential romantic relationship. He looked at Sam again, his confusion clear on his face.
And with that Castiel found himself lost for words yet again. Dean was still pressed against him, the warm familiar strength, and still so absent of fear or concern. It was not normal. And yet right at that point Castiel was not certain he cared.
Dean rubbed his forehead with the ball of his hand before allowing the hand to fall away tiredly. “No wonder they take your memory, anything like that is always a red flag that some bad shit is about.”
For one of the first times in his life Castiel could fill in the blanks. Unfortunately, it was also penis shaped.
Dean curled a little more, trying to find any scrap of strength left and finding his cupboards bare. He whimpered softly and was delighted to find that Cas was lying next to him, spooning up with an arm wrapped around his chest to hold him. Finding enough energy to squirm up closer to him, Dean sighed softly and closed his eyes. Fuck, he was exhausted, his whole body throbbing lightly and still so painfully sensitive to touch. He could taste Balthazar’s come in his mouth and feel the gentle trickle of Castiel’s seed from his ass, and still had no idea how to handle it. Used or satisfied? Or both? Fuck knew.
After five more minutes Castiel was more certain that nothing fundamentally large had happened and he closed his eyes wearily. So much for protection.
“I…,” Castiel decided against the lie and simply sighed. “We have not. But Dean would have spoken up-,”
“Come now, do you really want either of them to remain at this age? You’d be grey within a month.” her eyebrow twitched upwards idly. “Greyer, anyway. And the risks are
“Okay. Let’s do this.” The determination was back again, Dean’s voice deep, husky and clearly not planning to take no for an answer. Castiel was curious what ‘this’ would entail. From the look of challenge that was attempting to hide tension on Dean’s face, so was he.
Sam stared at her with the wide eyes of a puppy trying to work out reality, before obediently looking at Dean and then Castiel and then back again.
“You wish to object?” Surely not, the tone of Castiel’s voice suggested. Dean pouted a little more, but neither agreement nor objection emerged, and he remained still. Castiel smiled in pleasure. He was a very good boy, and it was clear from the lifting of the sulkiness that Dean basked in this pride.
Another little look of doubt. Dean shot a small, uncertain look at his brother, and then at Cas again worriedly.
“How is he?” Sam’s voice was a little urgent on the other end of the phone, which was definitely understandable. The situation was worrying and developing at what seemed to be a rapid pace; in fact, Castiel had literally just taken a very cold shower to remove some of the developments, but he wasn’t entirely sure his body had taken the hint. Dean had equally been disappointed to find that ‘bedroom activities’ were not immediately forthcoming, but thankfully he had also been distracted by the shower. Small blessings during hard times.
Dean seemed relieved by the name. Or at least, for a moment anyway. Worry faded to relief faded to faint annoyance, and that was another puzzle on top of a number of mysteries.
Sam was looking ruffled, dark circles under his eyes and his hair a mess, but the look on his face was a confused frown. Castiel had managed to get himself both dressed and stood up in the corner, an unreadable expression on his face as he folded his arms and leaned against the wall in what was probably an idle way.
close, and he could almost feel electricity crackle as he turned a little more to face him. The hand on his shoulder was still there, a warm, friendly touch that didn’t quite match the intense look in vivid blue eyes as Cas seemed to stare into his soul.  They were so close that Dean couldn’t really see the rest of Castiel’s body but the skin he could see was talking to him in ways that quite frankly confused the fuck out of him. Since when did seeing a guy’s upper body cause that type of physical reaction to burn through him? Cas was almost golden, especially in this light, the shadows and light playing prettily over his skin and sending new magical light in his eyes, and Dean found his throat growing drier again.
Castiel closed his eyes briefly, praying for strength, which doubled again as Dean began to gently but determinedly push him in the direction of the bedroom and the large and very welcoming bed.
“So you know how to fix him, right?” Dean tried to keep the aggression out of his voice, and thankfully - kinda - his anxiety was beginning to slip through. The angel lifted his head a little, eyed Dean again, and then gave a careless shrug.
He didn’t even know how that could be both arousing and revolting at the same time but apparently it achieved it. And worse? Right here, right now, the angel’s suggestion was embarrassingly accurate. Dean growled softly, still not letting the finger go, glaring at the angel as though dropping eye contact might in some way be a note of surrender.
“That’s an accurate statement of what Cas is currently doing, but not a particularly good assessment of
Okay. That was good. That was really good, and although this might be a gateway to god knows where, right now he didn’t really care. Dean leaned forward a little more, his lips meeting Cas’ again and felt a spark of insanely intense need as Castiel accepted the kiss and deepened it a little further. He was faintly conscious of Cas’ hands sliding over his waist and one creeping down to his ass, and he probably should have been doing the same back but his body seemed to be completely frozen in shock. Somehow it also felt right. Normally it was him taking the lead, pushing the boundaries, but right now Dean was happy for Cas to take over and that probably would be embarrassing if he bothered to think about it.
Dean began to storm off past his brother, only for Sam to perhaps unwisely take matters into his own hands by attempting to physically restrain him. However, the exhausted Dean wasn’t exhausted enough not to notice, practised and powered on extreme coffee; he caught hold of Sam’s hand that had shot out to bar his path, grabbing it by the wrist and twisting as Dean put his full strength into speedily pushing Sam back hard against a thankfully bare-ish wall behind him.
Speaking of the other angel, Balthazar wasn’t on pause either. Dean wasn’t sure what the fuck was going on, but every so often there were more whispers, more flashes in Castiel’s eyes, Balthazar’s arm wrapped around Cas’ chest to keep them together as he did so. Yeah, his money was definitely on some type of dirty talk, and whatever it was seemed to be pressing Cas’ buttons and probably pulling a few levers as well.
now. Pretty good at it. C’mon.” Dean’s hand brushed over Cas’ groin again with enough sensation that it stopped all rational thought for a good few seconds. So very,
“I’m sure you do.” The critical look aimed itself back at Dean. “I thought you said they’d had a hex problem. He looks just as healthy as he normally does, albeit filthier than the average 80s porno. Cas, you know I love you, but if this all turns out to be the spiritual version of a verruca then I’m going to be pissed.”
emotional stuff. I don’t know, I guess he thinks it makes him weak and vulnerable, or perhaps he’s just generally shit at serious things outside of a one night stand. He’d take it to his grave if you let him.” Sam stared at him steadily. “
Dean shifted again and was surprised to find no further evidence of the angel power in him. Balthazar chuckled softly.
Dean stumbled and pressed his hand to his forehead as he tried to clear his mind. It was just an avalanche of images, his mind overwhelmed as they came, over and over again, and that was before the
Dean began to laugh when Castiel’s gaze lifted again to fix him with a stern look. The laugh stopped mid-chuckle, a look of surprise crossing Dean’s face for a moment before being replaced by something distinctly hungry.
Not that this was surprising. Dean found he couldn’t turn his gaze away from the man dressed in what seemed to be dark blue robes, his hands raised and his gaze staring over the heads of the congregation surrounding him to an unknown spot in the trees. Any murmurings had died away to silence now, a few lights flickering in the woods as they watched and waited.
“I don’t know. How are we looking?” Castiel looked between them. Dean released his breath and let out a soft, shaky chuckle without looking back at him. Awkward questions. Awesome. This promised to be like giving the sex talk to small children on a constant basis, let alone an awkward sex talk to someone who was.. Well. Dean wasn’t entirely sure what Castiel was, but Dean’s body definitely had some suggestions. Holding hands, living together, 50s domestic sit-com..
“Kinda hoping neither of us are going to be good.” Dean retorted breathlessly, although his words caught in his throat as Castiel stroked him roughly, his face nuzzled in Dean’s neck as he felt the trembles of sensation work their way through his lover’s body. Dean squirmed, back arching on the bed as he panted for air, one hand clawing on the bed as though this might in some way make Castiel speed up.
“I’ll be back in a minute,” the angel murmured. Dean glanced at him, gave a small nod, and then looked across at Sam doubtfully. Castiel smiled gently and then walked back toward Rowena, eyes hardening with each step away from Dean.
If looks could kill, Dean was on his 3000th corpse. Eyes narrowed to almost slits as he glared back at his brother for a few moments before shaking his head in annoyance. Castiel could almost hear the teeth grinding.
Was that some sort of Angel thing, the mm? Dean looked from the angels to Sam and then back again incredulously. C’mon, what happened to
Dean was aware of soft chanting in the background, the occasional familiar latin word showing up every so often, but it was of no more concern to him than background diner music. The hand on Dean’s ass tightened a little as Castiel began to explore, Dean leaning forward into the embrace and still scanning Cas’ eyes as though searching for a fear that the whole thing was a joke. But no, Cas was all but radiating sincerity and Dean slowly allowed himself to respond in the manner his body was demanding.
Although his strength was good enough to stop rogue howls, it was having more difficulty when it came to his growing need, a painful throb throughout him that kept building at each hard thrust. Dean bit his lip hard and found it wanting as a technique to keep his body under control. But he couldn’t, had to keep going but man, it was hard, and looking up at Cas wasn’t helping matters either. He’d thought the man attractive before, albeit in the privacy of his own head and not to be repeated. Now, with a faint sheen of sweat on his brow and a vivid blue gaze that could give Superman’s lasers a run for their money, he was pretty much irresistible.
“Dean?” His name, but coming from the wrong man and the wrong direction. Dean gritted his teeth and focused on Cas, but Sam drew closer, wiping his dirty hands on some sort of cloth as he did so. Sam stared at Cas and then back at Dean. “What’s happened?”
of effort to get hold of. They only allowed it because I was able to suggest I could carry out maintenance tasks, which would mean no need for random tradesmen turning up.
He never thought he’d say he was suffering from this situation but Dean was rapidly coming to the conclusion that this was a whole new level of torture that was both glorious and desperate at the same time. His glare had devolved into a softer, pleading route, not sure why they’d stopped him from finding his release but knowing he was no longer in charge of it. Balthazar glanced carelessly at him again and began to stroke his fingers across Dean’s cheek and along his jawline again.
. His vision all but blacked out as he shook, only a soft strangled squeak emerging before his body gave out and sagged downward. The bowl was swiftly removed and Cas had already withdrawn, concerned eyes on him as his angel gently guided him onto his side to recover.
Dean chuckled and rested his arms around Castiel’s neck lazily. “Yeah, I bet. I’m sorry. I was probably just a bit clumsy, didn’t mean to worry you. Did you .. ah, did you want to go to the Great Hall and get some food? I think the lady said that’s what they did.”
do you know the yard really … no, no, it’s fine, I won’t ask.” Jody pinched the bridge of her nose with her free hand, and gently transferred Sam’s hand to Annie. “It’s just as well they’re cute.
“Oh, yes. Very good.” she looked between them and gave Dean another sly smile. “Well, I’d better leave you to it.”
The smile lifted in the corner of Castiel’s mouth. For all his outbursts and arguments, he had a growing suspicion that Dean just wanted to be a good boy. This was certainly something he could offer him.
Dean wasn’t sleeping. He wasn’t admitting it either, which was a typical Dean thing to do in the face of undeniable evidence to the contrary. However, after the third time he’d pinballed off one of the chairs, Sam felt it reasonable to make at least some noise of concern.
Castiel still had not located his target and therefore they had another phone catch up over their temporary children’s progress. She’d added in extra detail as it seemed to reassure the angel, their likes, their dislikes, their funny moments, whether they’d slept enough, whether the small little nightmares had returned.
“I see,” Castiel said gravely, and really, really hoped he did. Ordinarily Dean was better at translating Sam’s phrases and meanings, especially when they were small insults. Still, it seemed clear enough. The symbols were some type of occult marking, which were still live. They could be removed in some fashion - Castiel was already considering the most appropriate ways to break such a thing - but someone in the community had purposefully placed them there. To resolve the task would need the destruction of the symbols and the removal of whoever it was guarding them.
“Stay out of this, Cas.” Dean growled softly, his eyes never moving from his brother. Sam growled back, and then hissed in pain as Dean twisted his wrist a little more. Castiel frowned harder. No. This was not happening.
“I know where we need to take him.” Castiel replied, and the words were good but his tone wasn’t quite as relaxing, and Dean was about to ask prying questions when dark suddenly switched to light and he was kneeling on a rug that had so much shag that Austin Powers would be in heaven.
“Sam.” it was the warning voice he had used on Dean, and remarkably it seemed to have a similar effect on the younger Winchester as well. A little start, before Sam gave a small smile.
Dean really wasn’t feeling at ease or extremely confident right at this point. Sure, the investigation itself was pretty much bread and butter, and there were already several people who were clearly curious about them and already happy to talk about whatever it was they led with. That bit, the lies and the drama and the roleplay and the .. well, more lies, that was all fine.
“So you’re assuming something happened there because it’s .. old?” Dean looked at the photo critically before handing it back to Sam. “Based on what?”
“That is always a risk,” Castiel agreed, his gaze deliberately running across Dean’s firm chest and stomach before resting on the waistband of the pants he wore. “Perhaps you should remove the remainder of your clothing and we’ll consider what plans might be afoot.”
. It was a difficult time, made even more difficult as Dean shifted every so often with another little movement and the adorable squeaky noise that Castiel had never heard from him before.
Dean froze, which seemed like a good idea at the time. The figure appeared to be asleep, head resting on a pillow and turned slightly toward him with his eyes closed. The blankets covered his lower half, draped over his form, but his upper half was bare and available for scrutiny. Muscular, smooth, curves, with a golden skin that seemed to glow in the morning … was it morning? He didn’t know … probably morning light in a manner that heaven itself would be proud of.
How humans managed to live like this was a testament to their strength and stubborn determination. And, to a certain extent, to their faintly masochist nature. This was
“Research? That’s right, Sammy. Stories are just another way to give information,” she said, leaning back on her chair between the two camp beds in the guest bedroom. “It’s another part of training.”
The kiss moved from light to hard to desperate in a short space of time. Dean cupped Castiel’s face in his hands, controlling and guiding the embrace even as the angel moved to meet him. They were flushed and panting when the kiss broke, an intense look in Dean’s eye that was either frantic or starving as his hands moved from the gentle caress to an obvious attempt to rip off Castiel’s clothes.
“We...uh.” Castiel paused and thought about it. “I’m not quite sure, it was a strange set of circumstances. We received word of odd happenings around a storage locker, and research into the deceased owner suggested that they were a collector of unusual artefacts. On gaining access to the locker, we were able to find a few items and then we either set off a ward or a curse. I appear to be unaffected … or at least by the magic, anyway.” Another pause and a faintly pitiful expression. “Children are hard.”
” Cas’ voice was commanding, his blue eyes even more vivid as he stared at him in concern from inches away. Dean stared at him in confusion, then glanced over his shoulder where the crowds were already moving, some beginning to scream, the leader down with a dark pool slowly appearing near him and there was Sam coming up from the side with what appeared to be something metallic in his hand - a gun? - and the other leader was raising his hands and the bandstand was
a teddy bear; from what Bobby had said, John hadn’t really seemed the type for soft toys for kids he was trying to ‘toughen up’. Claire watched where his gaze went and calmly moved the cop car and the teddy next to him. She glanced back to baby no.2.
“We’re home.” Dean mumbled again, his head resting on Castiel’s chest and his eyes already closed. The angel could sense exactly when the man slipped into a light slumber, the way that his muscles relaxed even further and his head dropping against Castiel’s collarbone comfortably.
“Okay, cut it out. I’m fine. Really. Cross my heart and hope to die. Although it’s nice you’re worried,” he leaned up and pressed a little kiss to Castiel’s cheek fondly. “I’m gonna go get my coat. You finish up here, okay?”
“Well, at least you haven’t lost your memory.” Sam still kept a little distance back, and that .. well, that was appreciated. Sam too close to Cas definitely did bad things to Dean’s comfort level, and that was probably weird. Even weirder that it was only through logic that he had come to that conclusion rather than observation.
There weren’t many words, but equally there was little to say. Dean had always had an expressive face whenever he allowed himself to show his thoughts, and it was an act of simplicity to watch the desire and the nervousness and the fierceness and the tenderness cross his features. Their gaze never left each other when the time came for Castiel to shed his pants and position himself against the bed to allow Dean to straddle him, and the look of relief and nervousness and pleading contained in Dean’s eyes as he slowly lowered himself onto Castiel was beauty itself.
There might be cursing but at least Dean was asking permission for things, something that Castiel hadn’t realised would even be possible. He smiled again and gently ran his hand down Dean’s cheek with the lightest of touches, feeling him shiver against his hand and Dean’s eyes turn to a confused, boyish look. And to think he had assumed he would be the uncertain one in this situation.
you.” Dean pointed out slowly and deliberately, as though touch was synonymous with either rape, murder or mutilate.
Didn’t take him long before he realised that the thumb just wasn’t enough, and Dean felt a flush of embarrassment creep to his face at that thought. Thumb was good and it was clearly a turn on for the angel in front of him, but it was smaller and unable to fully appreciate the work he was doing. Still, the alternative was ..  well, it wasn’t something he wanted to admit wanting, and Cas would freak. Hell,
His hand gently drifted from chest, across the firm stomach and then slowly, carefully to brush against Dean’s groin. Dean’s pleasure was easy to discern. A soft gasp greeted him as Castiel’s hand stroked lovingly across a large, hard erection, hard and eager and twitching in sensation from the touch. Dean bit his lip and closed his eyes for a moment, before opening them again and fixing Castiel with a look so unholy that even Lucifer would be impressed.
“Dean. You will need to talk to me in order for me to do this,” he explained, just in case the tiredness had affected Dean’s logic processes. “Perhaps you could start by explaining what is happening? Are you having bad dreams?”
“Oh, thank the lord! It’s your husband. He’s … well, there’s been an accident. Please, could you come with me?”
“There. You use those.” she paused to help Sam hold it properly. “So when you want to battle to win you just boomph! Like that. See?”
the strategy we’re going with!” the stern voice was not quite so manufactured. A lazy, cocky grin met that, Dean’s eyes closed and his breath already laboured as he tried to encourage Castiel’s hand to speed up. It failed. The angel deliberately reduced his movements, resulting in a soft pleading whimper as Dean suddenly realised the impact of his protest.
“We’re not leaving until you tell us what’s wrong,” Sam was saying, half statement, half demand. “And don’t try lying to us.”
“We’re working on turning them back.” Jody added, although she hoped that was a given. Claire eased the trench-coat slightly to see Dean better. Wary green eyes studied her back and squeezed Castiel harder.
Castiel caught one of his hands and stared at him steadily. Wide green eyes looked back at the angel’s stern expression before Castiel offered him a twinkling smile and gently but firmly shoved Dean backward so he sprawled across the bed.
Still, there was definitely Dean still in there. A familiar cocky ‘don’t care’ grin answered that comment as Dean continued to rub his hair dry, arms up and offering the angel a view that could challenge many of God’s natural wonders. And this was definitely inappropriate. They were on a mission. Dean was both his friend and his non-romantic partner. There were rules of engagement to consider.
“Stop. I’ve got this handled.” Hard, angry, resolute. Sam stopped but his expression grew darker as he looked back at him.
“Cas… did I do something wrong before the accident?” Dean murmured finally, his hand falling away. “Cause you’re really fighting this.”
Standing wasn’t cutting it any more, but the circle didn’t have a damned bed in it so in the end they sank down to their knees, bodies still aligned and a new kiss deepening as they did so. One of Cas’ hands had made it to Dean’s head, running fingers through his short hair as Dean’s own hands had snuck around the angel’s back and pulled him as close as physically possible without possession getting involved.
Had there ever been a better sight than this? Dean hadn’t known what to expect with the celebration but everything had worked out easily. The households gathered, a soft excited murmur as they waited for the light to fade, before the leader of the community began to walk ahead into the wooded area and along the small paths. No words were needed. The community followed him without instruction, a long chain of willing people that wound their way through the trees like ants.
Dean growled softly in the back of his throat, but it was the helpless noise of one who was in a trap and couldn’t free himself even if he wanted to. Cas still hadn’t moved away from his intense look, a solid stare that cut straight through to fuel Dean’s need and ruined any form of communication he possessed as he stared back, the fly caught by the particularly seductive spider.
“It is still daylight,” Castiel seized on the first objection he could think of, a little desperately. Dean glanced at him in bewilderment and then laughed.
Pushing himself up from his chair, he made his way toward the kitchen area and the prospect of coffee. Stepping through the entrance confirmed the presence of Castiel, who was equally engaged in coffee related activities. Clear blue eyes turned to him with a worried expression.
Sam had to agree with that. He swallowed the rest of the coffee and put the cup down determinedly on the counter.
He didn’t need to look at the door to know that voice. Dean froze, eyes staring at Balthazar as he almost begged the angel to say it was one of his jokes and that his brother was still sleeping, but said angel was looking a little wary himself as he slowly lowered the paper.
“Cas.. c’mon..,” Dean was squirming on the bed again, his hand tightening on the muscle of Castiel’s arm although this seemed to be an instinctual movement as he panted out his demands. Castiel’s willpower, already battered and bruised, stood no chance. Pausing to steal one last hungry kiss, he moved to line himself up and paused to survey the dishevelled, flustered but defiant Winchester lying beneath him.
“If you were willing, I would recommend that I stay here with you for the evening in close proximity. This will allow me to feed you strength and to assess the current condition.” his voice was matter of fact.
“What’s going on?” she asked as yet another battle occurred in the lounge. There was a soft pft as the explanation of current wrongness was given to her. “You’re doing it wrong.”
He couldn’t remember this brother of his, but his timing sucked balls. Just to fix the water? Man, that was annoying. It was good of him to come he guessed, but still. Didn’t want to show that though, Cas was giving him another confused look over his shoulder at his reaction.
Castiel waited. He would wait for eternity if so wished, but he couldn’t deny a little ball of hope still burning in him.
“Wow.” Apparently the current situation was having an impact on Sam’s vocabulary. The younger Winchester coughed and managed to discover new words. This was extremely pleasing, as Castiel had already concluded that his own mind would be troubled for some time. “Perhaps he got hit on the head harder than we thought. You gonna be okay until I get over there? Probably half an hour, tops.”
Castiel sighed softly and gently pulled him closer, feeling Dean settle against his chest and all but purr in satisfaction. A natural position, indeed, although one that had an equal part between pleasure and guilt.
This was his taste? It couldn’t be his taste. Perhaps it was the guy in the bedroom’s house. Perhaps they’d been drinking and came back for .. Dean hesitated over that possibility, and rubbed his forehead again tiredly, before blinking around for any signs of clothes. And hell, at this point Dean didn’t care whether they were his clothes or whether they were his ‘friend’s’. Clothes were clothes and anything was better than just a single thin sheet of cotton that was all that shielded his vulnerable bits from the outside world.
“I don’t know. Probably the leftover chocolate mousse that was in the fridge,” Jody studied the two boys who stayed in one spot for all of a minute before Dean gave Sam a little shove, called ‘it’ and vanished off into the house followed closely by his brother. Okay. This was going to take more effort than she’d remembered.
- opened it with as few squeaks as he could humanly make. A blond woman stared at him in shock for a moment, her hand already outstretched as though to knock, her eyes automatically moving to study the nude-trenchcoat fashion before rising again and offering him a bright smile.
He was beautiful and yet definitely not his, despite Dean’s insistence and Castiel’s longing. The angel sighed wistfully. Yes, it would almost certainly prove to be a long evening.
“Oh.” Castiel fell silent again, still thinking hard. Was this a strange blessing? But then Dean had not spoken of it since. Perhaps he merely thought of it as another odd Sam suggestion, or perhaps he had drunk enough that the words had been lost in an alcoholic haze. Perhaps this was not agreeable to him, which was certainly a possibility. Castiel’s duty was to protect him; there had always been stern warnings against those who loved their charges too greatly. The consequences were often dire.
“We could go to bed early if you wanted,” Dean suggested, and the concern was so devoted that it was almost physically painful. “Get you tucked in, pillow behind your head, just let you rest up. We’ve got lots of time to settle in, yeah?”
“-he’s a fucking pain in the ass is what he is,” Dean snapped back. Cas continued as though he hadn’t heard.
“I was thinking of coming over, having a chat to people, see who knows who put in the system.” Sam said, a little too casual. Castiel understood this to mean that the younger Winchester was going to come fully armed with various witch or other supernatural entity killing items, which was also perfectly reasonable.
And the small flinches from Cas. The uneasy, slightly panicked look in his eye whenever Dean went further. The stiff, tense movement of his body that spoke against the hard erections that the angel had. The carefully chosen phrasing to avoid blowing their cover. The nerves around the community.
Dean was about to drop the clothes on the floor when Castiel’s eyebrow rose in silent question; there was another little pause before Dean delicately and deliberately folded them and placed them on a nearby chair.
“Well, I’ll go study the info tonight and get back to you if I think it’s something I can fix. In the meantime, get some rest, huh?” Sam glanced at Cas and then, carefully, back at Dean. “And that kinda goes for you too, Dean. You’ve had a rough couple of days. Don’t push things, okay?”
Finally the man began to speak, a low, solemn voice that still managed to drift clearly across the space. Dean didn’t understand the words - were they latin? He didn’t know - but there was a rhythm to it, a soft, warm chant that he couldn’t draw his attention away from. The rest of the audience and surroundings seemed to fade away, irrelevant in the face of the performance. At some point he’d lost hold of Cas’ hand but that was okay, that was fine, Cas would be nearby and it was all good, very good, and the community was there with him.
The day got worse when they followed the slim, windy paths through to the centre of the little woodland patch and found the structure in question. And yeah, it was still there, woody, painted cheerfully, with fiddly wooden bits carved into the structure and a well loved surface in the centre. Probably somewhere that people gathered to sing christmas carols or something, Dean could imagine the whole structure having mistletoe and holly hung around it in a festive manner.
Nothing. How was that even possible? She sighed again and returned to the kitchen, where Annie was still sitting with a perfectly behaved Sam. Highly suspicious. Jody moved into the room and then looked carefully at Sam, sitting on a high stool with his legs swinging and drinking what appeared to be milk. Her gaze turned to Annie in question.
Of course this had not been Sam’s opening gambit. The younger Winchester had started with a little more tact but it had rapidly vanished over a few grunts and a lot of scowling from a still dozy Dean. Dean hadn’t been fully asleep when they had arrived, battling his eyelids for dominance, but he certainly hadn’t been fully involved in the world, and an irritable Sam had gone down as well as the proverbial lead balloon.
That was an unusual place to start a conversation, but Castiel decided to ignore it as a potential creation from pain. He stepped forward and silently held out his hand for Sam’s injured wrist which, after a small short sulky hesitation, was finally given to him. Castiel frowned as he gently manipulated the joint. Definitely broken, and some damage to the tendons. Dean had been remarkably rough considering the small movement, but then Dean had received significant experience on how to gain the maximum amount of damage from each attack.
And things continued like that for another few days. She could see how the boys' confidence levels increased, the way that Sam now explored away from his brother, Dean’s slow movement away from constant monster hunting and into baseball or football or just running for the fun of it. She knew how to cut their sandwiches the way they liked it, Sam requesting little triangles and Dean preferring his squared and without crusts.
, on where he was. A pamphlet about something called The Glen sat on a bookshelf, although Dean noted the fact there weren’t many books in said bookshelf other than that. A trenchcoat was neatly hung on the back of a chair. A slightly battered green canvas coat that was less neatly thrown to one side, a small car oil stain on one sleeve and nothing in the pockets other than what appeared to be a spent bullet. Well, that was cheerful.
Dean frowned at the text message and then back at the bandstand, and then the surrounding area. Back to the trees again. Even the paths were pretty slim.
“I do not understand. Why are the housewives desperate?” Castiel squinted at the pamphlet as though it might explore this particular theme in more depth. Sam chuckled ruefully and waved a hand toward the road.
He had assumed that pleasurable adjustments would be welcomed, but then it almost certainly was not on a human list of possible things. Dean gently smacked him on the stomach.
She indicated to the small boy who had still not woken up, his dark brown hair flopped over his eyes and his body still curled up tightly like a small hibernating creature. She already knew where this was going. Dealing with Cas and the Winchesters seemed to operate on the opposite of Occam's Razor; whatever crazy situation she could think of was normally the right one, and there was no way that Cas would have travelled without either of the boys.
Dean snapped back to him, and despite everything Cas seemed clearer somehow. He licked his lips and gave a shaky nod.
Dean’s lip curled again angrily, although not knowing what the hell he was aiming that to. The situation, possibly. He was also aware of Cas slowing his thrusts down, waiting, allowing him more movement, and Dean found his mouth growing drier which really wasn’t going to help in the long run.
But Cas looked sweet and noble. Probably nothing. Better to apologise anyway, probably shoved his foot in it.
From that point on it was a mix of give and take. His steady rhythm merged with Dean’s as their mouths met, movement varying in strength and angle as his length plunged quicker into his lover’s willing body with Dean bucking against him in his own need to make things faster, harder. Dean’s hand had already strayed to his own dick and was stroking himself furiously in time, a look of concentration on his flushed face as he did so.
And, to a certain extent, Castiel wasn’t entirely sure that wasn’t the right position to take. Certainly, the fabric encasing their lower halves had not been removed, but this fact had not stopped the fact that he had liked the closeness of Dean’s body very much indeed. His erection was already rock hard and significantly more uncomfortable than it normally was, and Castiel had worried about this fact for several hours until he had decided that this was almost certainly fruitless. Dean would respond as he would respond, and he had never been particularly prudist surrounding sexual activity.
“Oh. The younger one with the mop of hair and aspirations of being a human giraffe. I did wonder why he wasn’t here.”
“Well, as long as Sam is saved, does it make much of a difference?” Castiel was surprised. “I will not let Sam die, Dean. He is important to you.”
Anger. Agony. Fear. Regrets. Worry. Uncertainty. So many emotions milling around, desperately trying to find outlets.
- dress himself. Castiel felt himself relax a little as Dean’s skin met up with a fabric cover, although it was clear that Dean was slowly recovering his confidence. This promised that Castiel’s hands would still be full in the near future.
He sighed and rubbed his face. Fuck, he was getting grumpy in his old age. Perhaps Sam really was here to help, Cas seemed to like him and he was happy to follow his husband’s lead when it came to people he couldn’t remember. Still, didn’t like the way that Castiel had moved away from him so damned quickly when he thought that Sam was watching them. That spoke of bad things in the past, and Sam was a big guy who probably packed a punch.
“Cas, he hasn’t even admitted there’s a problem. But he’s so tired. I left him in the library, pretty sure he’s going to be sprawled out on the desk asleep by the time I get back. For whatever reason, I think he doesn’t want to go to sleep rather than something stopping him.” Sam pulled a face and swilled the coffee around in the mug. “I assume you can’t see anything? Can’t go in his dreams and .. I don’t know, help him out?”
“C’mon, Sammy, wake up,” he pleaded softly, but his words clearly weren’t making any difference whatsoever and now he was feeling the edges of panic creep in. Trouble was, he didn’t even know that the standard medicine would do much better either. This wasn’t a stab wound or a gunshot or a strangulation or any other form of typical injury, this was part hex, part curse, part fucked up weird shit, and no doctor on Earth was going to understand the chaos that was currently his little brother’s body.
Castiel sighed and gazed toward the window. How to approach this subject with tact and decorum and .. well. In the background he could hear the sounds of the shower running and pieces of Dean singing happily. Currently Dean was crooning about not needing reason or rhyme, which was probably sensible.
Another few moments of silence from the elder Winchester, but Castiel was gladdened to see the wavering between the lines. Finally there was a soft growl and Dean gave a small, curt nod to indicate acceptance before turning to head out the doorway. Castiel followed behind him, a few steps away to avoid ‘being up his ass’ but equally close enough to catch him should gravity take him before he reached a bed.
Dean tried his voice, and thankfully found it still present. “No. And I don’t want anything, either.”
. And this was becoming ridiculous. Castiel’s jaw tightened, stepping forward as the brothers glared at each other from inches away in their own little territorial world of teeth and fury and pain.
” The last warning voice, allowing his irritation to emerge, and Castiel was about to physically remove Dean from his brother when there was the faintest of changes over Dean’s posture - the strength slowly ebbing out as though a small puncture in an inflatable toy -  and finally Dean released the wrist in his grasp and stepped back with a scowl. The older Winchester was breathless, a flush having risen to his cheeks, and Castiel narrowed his eyes again in uncertainty. That was not normal, in a world where not normal was generally .. well, normal.
Jody frowned at him, and then looked back at the still silent Sam as she worried about her initial assessment. They were alright, surely? They had to be alright.
“Cas?” Dean appealed to the other wild card, the card that hadn’t been seen in months, the constantly distracted card, and for weeks Dean had sworn he wouldn’t buckle and give in to Castiel’s little silences. But this was different, surely? This was Sam, and Cas probably had the power to do .. well, something.
“He’s okay, right? This whole thing, it’s not some ticking clock where his insides are slowly getting eaten up?” Dean spoke softly. The hand paused and then gave a little squeeze.
what I’m good at. No damned idea. Sam probably has a theory.” They remained in silence for some time, bonded in their shared bewilderment over the current situation. Of course, Dean’s complexities would be different. Castiel believed it likely that Dean did not fully understand his own answers. The angel, on the other hand, was very firmly certain of what he believed. What he would do after that point was another matter.
“I would imagine a favour of some type. Perhaps a difficult to obtain spell component,” Castiel said after a moment’s pause. “Either way, our options are limited.”
Swallowing, Dean allowed his head to rest back against the surface as Cas dipped his head to press a couple of light kisses across his chest, his tongue flickering over a nipple briefly before beginning to suckle on it. Dean made a soft helpless noise, his eyes closing as he desperately tried to cool his body off. The ache deep within him was so fierce that it was damned hard to specify whether it was pleasure or pain, and any gentle nudge or brush from Castiel against his groin merely added to the burden.
If only Castiel was quite so confident. The angel exchanged glances with Sam again. Still, it was the middle of the day and there were many people. If there was something supernatural then it would need to be either very brazen or the entire community was in on it.
“So… how does this work?” Dean glanced up at him, and there was the faint trace of hope in the other man’s eyes that seemed to do strange things to Castiel’s insides. The angel forced himself to focus. Now was not the time to consider how close Dean’s thigh was to his own, nor the line of Dean’s body now he was lying on his side, a beautiful curve from shoulder down to waist and back on the firm muscle of his hip.
Dean stared at him for a moment before moving his dazed and confused eyes onto the bowl that was sitting nearby. Oh. Right. Yeah. Stuff. Moving stiffly, he rolled over onto his stomach, and then pushed himself up onto hands and knees. He glanced over his shoulder only to discover that Balthazar was pressed up against Castiel’s back again, his mouth dangerously close to Cas’ ear as he whispered whatever scheme they had, and Dean bristled slightly at this.
Sam was lurking in his own room when Castiel finally located him, a mix of fury, concern and pain in his eyes and still cradling his wrist gently. He looked up as the angel stepped through the door, and almost immediately exploded. Thankfully this was only the verbal type.
“Well, no, but..,” Dean hesitated, snorted laughter again and cuddled up closer so that his voice was muffled. “The angel juice thing is awesome, trust me.”
“So if you don’t mind, get stripped, stand in the circle, I’ll set the cantrips and then you’ve got about half an hour to come.” Balthazar looked faintly impatient, looking between them.
Hand slid over the firmness of his stomach, Dean nuzzling into Castiel’s neck as he curled up closer. He could feel the heat of the man’s arousal press against his hip, conscious of his own body’s response that was equally, hard, hot and desperate. It was a hard situation to be in, and no amount of gentle cuddling would help.
“If I was an evil plotter in an evil cult community, I’d probably have cameras and microphones to record what the romantic couples get up … to.” Dean trailed off and winced. “They’re gonna have cameras and microphones in the bedroom, aren’t they?”
“It does feel like that sometimes,” Castiel agreed, although his viewpoint was less enthusiastic than his husband’s.
“Awesome.” Dean grinned at him and tossed the damp towel his way which Castiel caught automatically. Following to pick it up, Dean pressed a light kiss to the angel’s cheek and purred softly. “S’okay, Cas. You’re not going to get sent to hell for doing naughty things in the middle of the day, I promise.”
“I will be back in a moment,” Castiel addressed the sullen figure. “I need to check that Sam is okay before my return. Please do not attempt to leave, I will be .. unhappy.”
“Dean, you are well aware that I can move you there myself without any trouble at all. I am giving you an option to do this with some decorum.” Castiel’s voice was still firm, but there was an underlying quiet sympathy. “I do not wish to force you, but neither do I want you to collapse on the library rugs.”
“A minor accident.” Cas’ voice was still distant, but he was slowly coming back to life and Dean smiled in relief. “I probably touched something I shouldn’t. Perhaps an electrical wire.”
Castiel’s expression promised painful things in certain other people’s futures. He was about to argue some more when Jody gently rested her hand on his arm. Wouldn’t help. Might make Castiel feel a little better, but ultimately it was a very short term relief. She looked across at Dean who was still cross legged in the armchair, looking at his hands as though he’d never seen them before in his life. The bear sat next to him a little forlornly, a symbol of protective magic from another time.
Still, frogs be damned right about now. Castiel was still damned intense as well, a hunger in the angel’s eyes that Dean wasn’t sure whether to bow down to. He opened his mouth to speak but found no words to say, a silent plea transmitting instead which he was relieved to discover that Cas could decipher. A few moments later and Cas had guided him down to lie on the floor, the surface cool against the heat of his skin and the angel leaning over him like a lion over its prey.
He was aware of Dean’s scrutiny as he did so, and was again uncertain whether this was a positive or negative situation. Bare chested, Castiel paused to look back at Dean in question.
The hand on his shoulder was unexpected but welcome, a warmth against his skin and Dean found himself relaxing against it. Hated to admit it, but in the past it had always been these times when he felt the most alone, when Sam wasn’t there to talk to and a look around only found the emptiness looking back.
“C’mon, let’s go, let’s go.” It was feeling more natural. Dean was herding, getting people out of the local area, taking control. More and more things came to him, almost like suggestions. An image of salt, for some damned reason. The need to hunt. To go grab ..
Even more silence. Castiel could see the distance in Dean’s eyes as the man clearly struggled with his thoughts, and decided to sit next to him rather than standing over him like an avenging angel with a flaming sword. The dip of the mattress under his weight moved Dean’s leg next to his own, but that familiar warmth was good, still right, and he was comforted by Dean remaining where he was. From the fact that Dean did not remove his leg it seemed that the feeling was mutual.
“I was about to have a drink. You look like you could do with one,” Jody advised, making her way across to the couch. Carefully placing Sam down on one end, she covered him with a small blanket normally used for tv watching snuggle ups and surveyed him fondly. So small. Reminded her of another time, another baby. Jody gently stroked over his hair before moving back to her original spot and finding another glass for Castiel. It felt as though they’d both need it.
Sam forgot his fears for a moment in his hurry to sulk at being deemed ‘tiny’. Jody could live with that though. It was significantly better than the tears that she had worried over, not even sure what she’d feel if they’d both started crying. Probably the worse temporary mother on the planet, for a start. Both of the Winchesters had fought off multiple apocalypses, it couldn’t come to them being in tears in her lounge. She’d never live it down.
Whether it was good or not was soon to be tested; he was easing himself into the trenchcoat as the longer of two options when he suddenly noticed movement from the window and realised that someone was heading toward the door with a packet.
There was no other answer than yes. The woman ran ahead of him into the woodland, and Castiel had a brief acknowledgement of the potential trap before completely dismissing it as irrelevant if Dean was in trouble. He was his fake husband, his friend and his.. Well, that element was still under question, and Castiel still had little knowledge of how to tackle the thoughts and feelings that drifted through him when Dean was in question. He was a fascinating man. Perhaps sometimes too fascinating.
“We slept together. As in .. ,” Sam made a little gesture that was still unclear, and then sighed even heavier at Castiel’s expression. “As in romantically. Not quite intercourse but definitely not .. uh, well, you probably get the idea.”
“Yeah, well, to quote Bon Jovi, you live for the fight when that’s all that you got.” Another pause. “And you’re about to say I’ve got you and Sam, right?”
“Thank you, Sam. I confess myself to be particularly poor when it comes to…,” Castiel looked up to find that Dean had finished with his shower, wandering out naked and glistening whilst rubbing his hair with the towel. “...
“That’s adorable, but no.” Balthazar had the expression of an adult suddenly being offered some food by a three year old. “I can get most of it. There is one aspect that I can’t, though. It’s part of a ritual.”
“Does he ever stop asking annoying questions?” That was Balthazar, back from whatever fucked up shopping trip he’d been on, a cigarette in his mouth, another glass of some type of alcohol in his hand and his shirt already half unbuttoned. A lazy, half crooked grin aimed itself at Dean. “S’like some young kid suddenly finding out about the universe. Why, why, why.. ,”
The yard went better than expected. Balls and any other missile were confirmed as a bad idea, but the ‘training’ was popular, an activity that seemed to be a game of tag with very specialised rules to evade capture. Whoever was ‘it’ was either a vampire or werewolf, albeit much slower ones to allow them a chance to escape; neither of the boys was quite so fast without sharp corners to dodge around.
Castiel studied the ceiling with intensity. Sadly, as a distraction, it was not sufficient. There were several small cracks and a slightly uneven colour, but these minor defects had no chance of allowing his mind to stray from the very real fact that Dean’s wrist was brushing against the head of his cock every time that Castiel breathed, and breathing was an event that was certainly on the To Do pile.
“He’d never let me live it down.” Dean replied bitterly. Castiel turned his head to look at him curiously, uncertain why the man had such a poor view on his brother.
“Bit of a headache. To be honest, I can’t really remember much of it..,” he deliberately trailed off, and, as suspected, she was quick to jump into the details. Thank god for neighbour services.
“Dean!” Castiel warned in a strong voice, but the subject of his rebuke wasn’t listening. Dean had pressed himself up against Sam forcefully, the wrist still captured and clearly painful based on the look on Sam’s face, with Dean’s mouth so very close to Sam’s ear.
A basket was thrust upon him, with the smell of bacon in the air. Dean’s stomach growled. His arm was patted again, as though it was a small creature that wasn’t sure whether to flee.
Helplessly he looked back up at Balthazar only to find another small, warm smile coming the other way. The angel’s hand gently played through his hair.
“Although, on that note,” Dean added carefully. “We probably have to get going. You know, people to save, things to hunt… If you could possibly take us back to the car..?”
“This would not be a problem.” Castiel reassured him solemnly. And indeed it would not. In fact, very much far from it, but he doubted now was the time to discuss Sam’s suggestion. Still, the thought gave him more pleasure than he had anticipated, and he carefully shut the door behind him and moved toward the bed.
Castiel frowned at him, puzzled. There were many potential risks involved, but his own physical wellbeing was definitely low on the list short of an unexpected building explosion. Dean was looking at him in a mix of defiance and faint nervousness and Castiel slowly began to understand the stance. Ah, yes. The Convenient Excuse. Sam had mentioned something about that on another drunken evening, punctuated with a bit of arm flailing and some colourful language.
Gasping, licking his lips, still all but vibrating on the spot, Dean raised his head to shout something when Balthazar gave him a little wink.
“Yay.” Dean drummed his fingers on the top of the steering wheel. “And why can’t we just leave the community if we want to talk again?”
“You said he would not be harmed!” Cas hissed softly and angrily toward Balthazar as he gently tried to stroke over Dean’s body to calm his little shudders.
People were making their way through the paths, and he could see the glint of car lights on the main track leading to the entrance.
And that had a whole load of implications of what they’d be doing if Dean didn’t find his brother important, but Dean wasn’t sure he wanted to enter that rabbit hole. He sighed and crouched down again next to Sam’s side, checking his temperature for no other reason than he didn’t know what else to do, and taking solace in the simple way that Sam’s chest rose and fell with each breath. Keep breathing, Sammy. It would be fine. He’d make it fine, he promised.
This again caused a point of conflict. Cas wanted to explore. Dean was pretty damned certain they shouldn’t. There were
“Honestly, no one ever seems to pay attention to human nature. Stick around as long as I have and you
“You know he doesn’t normally go for full mouth kisses in the morning before breakfast.” Castiel emphasised the point. Small signs of affection were one thing. Kisses with hints of sexual behaviour were quite another.
“It’s kinda hard not to, Cas. You said he was acting differently but that’s … well, that’s kinda a big difference.”
“Is that behaviour or euphemism?” Castiel queried suspiciously. They had got him in the past on this before. Dean’s grin widened slightly and he deliberately and slowly tightened his laces before chuckling softly and taking hold of Castiel’s unresisting hand.
And troubled was certainly a milder version of the word he was planning to use. This was becoming harder by the moment, and certainly unethical. Castiel straightened his shoulders, a fine, soldier like movement that did absolutely nothing for his strength of mind, nor the persistent want that seemed to be a worm burying itself in his head, whispering possibilities. Inappropriate possibilities. Possibilities that would definitely not be what a friend would do for another, and yet the softness in Dean’s eyes and the tease in his smile were difficult invitations to ignore.
. No matter how long this went on for, no matter how much Dean said it, they were friends and friends only. In a way this polite, domestic setting was worse than the sexual exploration that Dean had so desperately wanted to try; physically intimate activities could find reasons to put them on hold. Little touches and gestures of affection were automatic and spoke to areas of Castiel’s mind that he hadn’t been aware even existed.
“I’m a witch, dear, not a fortune teller. Or a psychiatrist either, although I do love their little couches.” she chuckled softly and then looked back at their serious faces. “Oh, please. They’re
He was about to call out when he caught sight of the bedroom out of the corner of his eye, including a familiar figure sitting quietly on the bed with his hands clasped between his knees. Dean.
