“‘S awesome, man.” Dean gives him a small smile over the top of his comic. “And, uh, hey, I’m…” He trails off, searching for the right word. “I shouldn’t’ve shit on your idea in the first place. It’ll be cool, to learn more about him, y’know? I bet it’ll be huge.”
As they approach the house and stop in front of the fence, Cas notices that the garage door is open; there's a sleek, old-fashioned-looking car sitting inside.
Dean furrows his brows together as he tries to decipher what Cas is getting at; when he does, his face goes soft. “Yeah? Y’sure?”
a catch. As you all know, I have a son, but whoever I decide to spend the rest of my life with, I’d like to build a family with him, too. Obviously, it’s important to me that my future husband—and our children’s future dad—can, well, handle his [bleep]. Which is why you won’t be doing this alone.”
the damn thing, so he does—only to jerk back at the sight of a pair of blue eyes peering down at him.
, as if there were any in the first place—that Novak would see him as anything other than the loudmouthed, opinionated, complicated asshole he knows he is are nonexistent. It doesn’t bother him, though; it’s never bothered him, it never will, and maybe, if he believes hard enough, he can almost convince himself that’s true.
“Jessica goddamn Moore,” he says in disbelief, shaking his head as he takes a step back. “How the hell’d you manage this?”
They were only freshmen, but Charlie had sweet-talked a few members of the sound engineering department and managed to land them a late-night slot at Emerson’s radio station, Saturday nights at 1am. They had a grand total of three live listeners for their premiere, but once Charlie started archiving the episodes and turning them into podcasts, Rose-Colored Glasses started picking up steam. They’d gained a cult following, both in and out of Emerson, so much so that by the time the four friends had graduated, there had been no question that they’d continue the show.
“Well, I’ll be damned,” Dean mutters, watching as Cas and Sam struggle to keep the cash from flying out the car’s open windows. Suddenly, that parade of paper he’d seen trailing out of the car earlier makes a hell of a lot more sense.
Dean chuckles uneasily, not wanting to upset their host and accidentally end up on this wall himself. “They, uh…” He trails off uncertainly before finally finishing with, “Sure are something.”
The redhead smirks. “Doreen Green would kick his ass, Ed.” She turns to the other patron in the store, a scrawny guy with messy black hair. “What do you think, Harry?” she asks. “Lang or Green in a one-on-one fight? No squirrels or ants allowed.”
The Colt rears back once more and slams his fist into the mugger’s face, hurling him into unconsciousness. The Colt’s body sags after that and he takes a few seconds to catch his breath. He pulls the sleeve of his jacket up over his hand and digs into the mugger’s pockets until his covered hand reemerges with a cell phone. He punches in a few buttons and Cas can hear the phone ringing until a 911 operator picks up.
“Most of us rotate through it. You didn’t expect a professional photographer to be takin’ your cheesy future Christmas cards, didja?” he asks with a lopsided smile.
“Gotta pick up the pace, here, fellas!” he yells urgently, hopping over the beam while trying to avoid any soft spots in the loft’s floor.
Cas pauses, catching his bottom lip between his teeth before spreading his hands wide with an apologetic smile. “Surprise…?”
“Good, good.” He finally stops writing and looks at Castiel, who feels like a mess. His excavator’s uniform comprised of khaki everything is rumpled and probably has a bloodstain or two on the shirt, his hair is mussed, and he’s pretty sure his rapidly swelling nose isn’t doing him any favors in the professionalism department, either. “I’m sorry about this, Castiel,” he continues, chewing on his lower lip. “I know this wasn’t your fault, but we have to abide by policy. You used foul language in front of guests, and we’ve already gotten several complaints.”
“It’s just funny,” Alastair says, setting his glass down on the table between them. “That you think you have a shot with her.”
Novak doesn’t react to either of them, but Dean’s nothing if not persistent. “I stole. Too much, too soon.” He grins and waggles his fingers right up in Novak’s face. “Sticky fingers and all that.”
Cas was expecting something more dramatic, like sunsets on the beach down at the Cape, the way the sun glints off the Prudential on a summer day, snow lining the branches of trees in the Common, that kind of thing. Not comics.
A few others are scattered around the tent when Cas arrives, and he scans for any familiar faces before making a beeline toward Gabe, Raphael, and Balthazar. They’re not exactly friends to Cas, more like acquaintances if anything, but they all went through basic training together, and they’re part of the select few in the Station who aren’t constantly haranguing him about being more assertive and working on his shooting skills.
Sam nods, and Cas doesn’t miss the faint air of fondness in the younger Winchester’s eyes. “Tell me something I don’t know. Which is why he deserves someone just as good. He’ll never talk about this, says it’s too cheesy, but what it boils down to is him being happy. He spent so much of his life—still does—making sure everyone else is happy and taken care of. He deserves the same for himself, whether he believes it or not.”
Dean takes his time leaning in closer, his eyes flickering from Cas’ own to his lips and back. The warmth of Dean’s breath sends a chill down his spine, and he closes his eyes, his lips parting in anticipation of what’s coming. Something he quickly recognizes as the tip of Dean’s nose gently taps against his own, and then Dean drops a quick kiss there, as well, and Cas just about dies.
“I think we should try those next,” he says, finding the sweet potatoes and placing them on the countertop. “They’re very good, and a little healthier for you than regular fries. They could be a good alternative for you.”
“I'm guessing you can't tell me whether you've already driven Michael out here, huh?” he asks. It's common knowledge in the
Fast-forward ten years later, and his aspirations of one day writing a bestseller are gathering dust, but at least he’s using his degree. That’s what his parents always tell him, so that’s what he always tells himself.
The chime of his phone starts going off right when he bends down to start lacing up his sneakers. Not bothering to lift his head up, Castiel reaches up onto the coffee table and palms around until his hand lands on his phone. Distractedly, he unlocks it and tucks it between his ear and his shoulder, resuming tying his laces as he answers.
“Don’t test me,” Crowley says pleasantly. He blows away the smoke twirling out of the pistol’s barrel before aiming square for Dean’s knee. “This isn’t my first rodeo. Cash. Now.”
Cas spends a few moments unpacking his gear, tossing his dirty clothes into his hamper, before his curiosity over whatever Gabe’s watching finally gets the better of him. He tries to crane his neck to see better without looking too obvious.
Dean just stands there, rubbing soothing circles into her back, muttering something into her ear. He keeps her in his embrace, still talking and consoling, until the girl finally pulls away herself. Dean stands at arm’s length, holding her shoulders and still talking to her. She wipes her cheek messily with her entire palm and finally manages a shaky smile.
Lisa’s face gets paler and paler as Dean pulls off his hat and continues scrubbing away the makeup covering his bruises. She reaches up and touches the darkening bruise under his eye, and Dean forces himself not to back away.
He doesn’t have to wait long before Cas gives him a small but delighted smile. “In,” he says. “One hundred percent in.”
works. It’s an awkward angle and it hurts, but the stiff neck he’ll undoubtedly have in the morning’s gonna be worth it for a chance to watch Novak, all muscle and sweat and arms that’ll have Dean going weak in the knees if he’s not careful.
; Castiel has been here for nearly four years, he should know that by now—that’s closest to the museum is called Science Park, and is right near the end of the line, so whenever Castiel gets on, there usually aren’t many people in the car with him. Today is a different story, though; with the nice weather, people have taken advantage of the shopping center at the end of the line, and so the train is already packed with people on their way back into the city. Castiel briefly reconsiders the idea of walking home instead of cramming himself into a stuffy, already-full train car, but his decision is rushed as the conductor clangs a bell impatiently, signaling that the train is about to depart. Digging into his back pocket for his Charlie Card, Castiel taps the card against the turnstile to gain access to the station and climbs up into the train, searching desperately for a bit of free space.
“Please tell me you haven’t been going here since freshman year,” Dean says, “or else I really will feel like an asshole.”
Cas' stomach twists again, but for entirely different reasons this time. Before he can try to stop it, he feels his mouth curve up into a smile, and he lets his head loll back over the edge of his seat back as relief floods through him. Dean is feeling better. Dean wants to see him.
“Why lie to him?” one guy in a dark blue T-shirt asks, his deep southern drawl dripping slowly like maple syrup. He pops his bubble gum and taps the heels of his cleats against the cement dugout floor before looking lazily at Cas with a smirk. “He’ll figure it out soon enough.”
“Get it, brother,” Benny says, elbowing his friend in the ribs with a toothy grin. “Damn.” Dean waggles his eyebrows and purses his lips, pleased with himself. He gets to his feet and salutes the other contestants.
“Oh. Uh—” Dean rubs the back of his neck, then decides Sam wouldn’t care if Cas knew anyway. “Why does anyone do anything? Love.”
Gabe leans back, doing his best attempt at looking affronted; to Cas, he just looks constipated. He scoffs, “Christ, of course not. Come on, is it so ridiculous to think I might just want you to come out of the goodness of my heart? To spend my birthday
He’s left standing awkwardly as they catch up, and Cas can’t help but notice the ease and charm with which he interacts with the man. It doesn’t seem any different than how he’d acted with Cas on the ship, and Cas starts to wonder if he’d completely misread this from the beginning. It would make sense—Dean is too much of a lot of things: too handsome, too funny, too smooth, too good for Cas.
“For the record,” Cas, who had somehow snuck up beside him and is now pointing at his own likeness on the page, says quietly, “I think you captured my bone structure perfectly.”
His terrible attempt at flirting—if he could even call it that—hangs in the air as Cas refuses to make any kind of small talk, and Dean’s too embarrassed to try anything else, so he just focuses on grabbing as much as he can so Cas will leave and he can be alone to lick his wounds.
Cas nods. He understands Dean’s line of thinking, he really does, but a question still nags at the back of his mind. “If you want to help, why not join the police department?”
in casual conversation. “Come on, we’re supposed to be adventurers! Brothers in arms! The Three Muske
Everything—from the mismatched chairs, dusty ceiling fan moving at a glacial pace high above them, the one squeaky floorboard two steps to the right of the defendant’s desk—in the tiny main courtroom of Lawrence County Court is just as Dean remembers it nearly two years ago. That’s exactly when he’d sworn to himself that he’d never end up here again, and he closes his eyes as he, Sam, and Cas are led to the front of the room, just barely able to hide his wince when his foot lands on that exact squeaky floorboard.
Dean’s always been a completionist. Even though he’s calmed down considerably from this afternoon, he’s still got a half-inked, half-colored drawing that needs his attention, so after dinner, he holes himself up at his desk and gets to work.
“Olive oil?” Cas asks, already having spotted the salt and pepper sitting on top of the stove. Dean motions with his chin toward the cabinet next to his head. Cas reaches over his shoulder, rummages around for the bottle of olive oil, then heads back to his station in front of the cookie sheet. He doesn’t realize he’d be holding his breath until he lets out a sigh.
While he’s waiting, Cas thumbs through his phone and opens up Instagram. He hesitates for a second, then starts typing until he finds Dean’s profile.
The next beautiful day coincides with one that Cas has off from work, so instead of sticking to their early morning routine of running around Dean’s neighborhood, Cas suggests that they run along the Charles River in the city instead. A small section of the gigantic, picturesque river runs right past the Museum, and its paved trails have long been one of Cas’ favorite places to run, so he’s excited to share it with Dean.
“Novak!” Zachariah says, his voice lined with fake cheer and camaraderie. “Come in, come in. How’s that Colt article coming?”
“Two years, man,” he says with a sigh. “Two years, and it hasn’t gotten any easier. Sam says I bottle up my emotions too much, that I should try posting pictures or talking about her more, that it’d help, but I don’t know. That’s his thing. Not mine.”
He knows it’s impossible, but if he never had to think of his freshman year of college--and all the subsequent breakdowns, medication, and therapy sessions to go with it--again, it’d be too soon.
“Thanks,” he says, flashing the kid a quick, apologetic smile before throwing a punch that has him going limp and boneless in the grass. Tucking the keys into his back pocket, Dean kneels down next to the kid’s unconscious form, rubbing the fabric of his collar between his fingers, then looks back up at Sam. “What size are you?”
of his job duties are his least favorite. He can handle leading tours through the Butterfly Garden and taking tickets for the IMAX movies at the Omni Theater, but everything else makes him wonder why the hell he liked going here so much when he was young.
“Here’s an idea,” Cas says, snatching the book out of Dean’s hand. “You try things before dismissing them.”
Dean’s eyes dart up to Benny’s before moving over to Sam’s, then Charlie’s. None of them speak for a few seconds, until Charlie sets the phone down on the coffee table.
It’s an odd feeling, kissing so deeply in such a public place, but being in Dean’s arms makes Cas feel safe. He’s vaguely aware of Dean’s tongue edging into his mouth, his thumb running along his jawline as gingerly as if he were tracing a bruise, and he has to will himself to keep it together.
“And pie,” Dean adds, digging around in the fridge and reemerging with a bottle of orange juice. “And beer. And I’m not gonna say no to pasta.” He takes a long swig of the orange juice then grins at Cas.
Cas nods. “Yes. And on clear nights, you can see the lights from the buildings twinkling in the water. When it’s not crowded, sometimes it doesn’t even feel like you’re on the T. It’s just a scenic ride for a minute or so.”
He remembers being holed up in his apartment with Anna, sleeping for just an hour or two before focusing in on the news again as a shooting took place near MIT, followed by a manhunt in nearby Watertown. The sparks of panic, anger, and frustration that crackled in his gut when it seemed as though they weren’t going to be able to find the one remaining man responsible for rocking the city to its core.
Dean’s started drip-drying instead of toweling off after a shower, and as much as Cas appreciates the view, he hates the puddles Dean leaves behind even more.
Dean’s laugh rings out from the bar, and Cas smiles down at his feet, cheeks flushed, as he forces himself not to look back.
The likelihood of this whole scenario not happening would normally be good news, except for the fact that Castiel can’t get Dean out of his head.
Novak doesn’t shift his position at the contact, but he does look at Dean with a quirked brow that has Dean’s cheeks going a flush red that he hopes to god he can blame on the sun. Dean opens his mouth to say something—snarky, apologetic, embarrassed, he’s not sure—but before he can, Novak shifts his hand to make room for Dean’s, then turns his attention back to the cornfields around them.
“I...’m not sure,” Cas says hesitantly. He curls his legs up on the couch so he can turn all the way around toward their bedroom, where Dean had darted off to. “Dean?”
He furrows his brow in confusion, but before he can respond, Dean continues. “This is probably really weird, man,” he says, “but I’m kind of...I don’t have a date to my brother’s wedding, and please let me know if I’m off-base here, but, I mean, you made me a
Cas watches as Dean’s fingers trace over Cas’ circle--just a regular one--and then his own--a circle with a line going across it, near the top, to symbolize his sunglasses--before feeling the description at the bottom.
Cas looks up and his jaw nearly drops at the goddamn adonis leaning against the fence in front of him. He’s got his arms folded across his chest, legs crossed at the ankles, looking at Cas curiously. There’s so much of him to take in, but the first thing Cas is drawn to are his eyes. Cas can’t tell what color they are from the shade provided by the brim of his cap--maybe green--but they look friendly and warm. He smiles at Cas, and the skin around his eyes crinkles with the motion.
Cas tries to brush it off by giving Balthazar a look like he’s grown three heads, but Cas has never been a good actor. Balthazar raises his eyebrows and lets out a low whistle, leaning over to see if he can catch one more glimpse of Dean amidst the bustle of the restaurant.
“Uh, congratulations,” Dean says. “I’m Dean, that’s Cas, and the moron who was trying to give you wrong directions is Sam. So anyway, like I was saying, you’ll wanna—”
Cas can’t help but think that Sam’s hugs are just as warm as he’d imagined from the moment he saw him hug Lisa during hometowns.
Before Cas can respond, another waiter pops up behind Dean and claps a hand on his shoulder. “Seventeen’s still waiting for their appetizer,” he says, barely loud enough for Cas to overhear.
.” He quickly pulls it back and shakes the mitt off, letting it land on the dirt outside the dugout with a thunk before re-extending his free hand to Dean. Dean laughs and shakes it, his fingers warm and firm around Cas’ hand.
He asks her something, the question muffled against the fabric of her shirt, and she shakes her head. “Oh, hon, I’m almost done. I’m just home for a visit, and to introduce you to some new friends. I can’t do this without you, you know.”
Cas shrugs, leaning against Dean’s shoulder as he feels Dean’s arm wrap across him. “You know, you still haven’t told me.”
Dean grins, more than ready to take the challenge for what it is. “Is that right?” Mirroring Novak’s stance, Dean stays still for another moment before taking a step back and stretching his arm out wide toward the road in front of them. “Well, then lead the way, handsome.”
When he finally manages to pull himself away from Cas—still keeping his hands on him, though—he notices Sam looking at them.
Dean releases another few breaths, and Cas notices the smile that creeps onto his face, as well. “Fuck you, Heartbreak Hill.”
Hannah is quick to jump up and make a beeline for Dean, who grins widely at her. “I’m so glad you could make it, thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to talk with us,” she says, grabbing his hand with both of hers and shaking it vigorously.
As much as he tries, Cas can’t tell if Dean is fucking with him, and he finally just blurts out, “Why didn’t you come into the elevator with me?”
ineptitude, I’m assuming that’s not something you’d want Principal Turner finding out about. Am I right?”
“Sorry, friends!” Gabriel shouts from the ground, wavin’ up at them like some kid at a carnival. “I know we’re kin, Castiel, but they were offering good money!”
Cas sucks in a tight breath through his teeth, then says, “I’m fine. Move a little closer to me, there’s a cur--” He’s jerked backward a little and turns around to see Dean standing still, arms folded across his chest, staring accusingly at Cas.
She chuckles again and taps her temple. “No use denying it, Junior. It’s all up here. Call it a gift, call it sorcery, call it whatever the hell you want. Lord knows everyone else does, but it’s never steered me wrong before.”
Cas digs into his bag until he finds his water bottle, answers to Billie’s question racing through his head and fighting for attention.
Cas’ back arches and he lets out a startled, throaty gasp when he feels Dean drop kisses between his thighs, taking his time dragging his tongue along the skin until he feels his mouth back around his cock. Cas spreads his legs wider as Dean works. He pulls against the cuffs harder this time, wishing he could grab a fistful of Dean’s hair, and sucks in a breath through his teeth.
She squints at him. “I have no idea,” she says slowly. “That’s why I’m asking. When someone’s responsible for the most buzz-worthy story this dinky paper has seen in
Grabbing a fish of his own, he pulls himself to his feet and heads over to Cas. He nudges Cas’ arm when he’s close enough, holding the fish out on an oversized leaf like some bizarre olive branch. “What’s with the sourpuss?”
He turns back toward the road, waits until he feels Sam’s presence at his side before speaking. “So,” he says, using his hand to shade his eyes, “back to square one, Sammy. No money, no car.”
Cas waits until Michael has exited the tent before glancing at Winchester, who’s staring at him defiantly. He shifts a little in his seat, but doesn’t make any move to try and loosen his bonds, which, in a way, just makes Cas even more nervous.
. The camera loves us, baby!” Gabe says, herding a stunned Cas and slightly tipsy Balthazar toward the station, then looks at the photographer and nods eagerly for their next direction.
, my little Warhol,” Charlie says, bursting into the room with a flourish. She hops up onto the little free space his desk has left without preamble, arranging herself so she’s sitting cross-legged before taking a long sip of whatever’s in her travel mug today.
“How did they even convince you?” Her eyes narrow and she glances around conspiratorially. “Blackmail?”
“Well, yeah, because your fucking tie’s on backwards.” Dean pulls his hand out of his pocket and reaches for Cas’ tie. “C’mon, lemme just—”
Dean worries his bottom lip between his teeth. “Pump the brakes, kid,” he says, voice low and rough.
"What can you do," he says with a shrug, more to himself than to Cas. Cas decides it's probably best to switch topics.
Cas takes a deep breath. “Sometimes people say they’re icy,” he starts slowly, “but I don’t think that. To me, icy is negative, or, well, cold. My eyes are a very bright blue, like the bottom of a clean pool on a sunny day.” Cas hesitates, casts a quick look Dean’s way, then shares his favorite description. “My mother used to say that they looked like pieces of blue seaglass with the sun glinting off of them.”
“You’ve got this grin on your face,” Cas continues, zooming in on Dean’s face in the picture, even though he’s got the real thing right next to him. “You’re leaning against me, our heads are tilted together, almost touching. I don’t know. You look relaxed.”
“So, that’s them,” Dean says as they get back into the Impala after having concluded the family portion of the evening. “Hope they didn’t scare you off too much.”
. He’s about to resume his original plan of finding some food when he hears the guy’s voice next to him.
“Nope.” Dean sets the markers down on a nearby desk and hops up onto the long sketching table running along the length of the wall. He gestures at everything behind him with a wave of his hand. “Last year’s seniors started it, but a few kids have added their own touches over time.” He taps the latest addition, a Japanese spider crab. “You have Krissy Chambers in any of your classes?”
It had taken him three different tries to find his way to Miranda, and now that he’s finally here, he just wants to go home. The campus is abuzz with overeager freshmen and their parents unloading their cars, and Cas tightens his grip on his steering wheel.
Dean takes a deep breath when Anna’s hand ghosts around the collar of his T-shirt as she struts around him, hopping up onto the bench in one fluid motion and holding out her hands. Dean takes them—he can do this, he can
looking for stories to tell their kids like he’d mentioned around the fire, they won’t have to go far. They won’t need witchcraft and cursed pocket watches and blood pacts and knives with intricate protection sigils carved into the handles and whatever else Dean had cooked up in his original tale.
A couple more names are called, a couple more people are thrilled and join the line on the steps, and with every passing winner, Dean feels his hope diminishing more and more. He sighs and closes his eyes, trying to force himself to not be disappointed. The chances of him winning are miniscule at best, and it’s just another one of those days, maybe he’ll get lucky when he tries for the hundredth time as opposed to the fiftieth, maybe--
Anna huffs and hops up onto her desk, letting her legs dangle in front of it. “Fine,” she says. “Just busy.” Her face softens almost immediately though, and as the sunlight streams in from the window behind her, Castiel thinks her orange hair makes her look almost angelic.
Ben lets out an exaggerated groan and turns off the TV before dragging himself to his feet. Lisa gives Dean an apologetic glance, and he squeezes her hand again.
“You shouldn’t need to go to the hospital, if that’s any consolation.” He shrugs. “I had to once. That shit sucks.”
She laughs, “Don’t ruin the moment, you jerk,” and smacks him playfully on the shoulder, then looks down at the single rose in her hand.
“Good.” Dean’s face relaxes into a teasing grin. “Besides, I like the way you describe things; Sammy doesn’t bother with
,” Cas repeats, and Billie throws her hands up in frustration. Before anyone can say anything else, Cas repeats, “I’ve gotta go get ready. I’ll talk to you all later.”
?” Dean snaps, rubbing at the sore spot before bending down, scooping up a length of chain, and tossing it toward his brother’s calves in an effort to trip him up—or at the very least, piss him off.
Cas fumbles with the bags in his hands, struggling not to drop any as he shifts his weight. “One: don’t laugh at me.”
“Are you referring to Dean or romantic interest of Dean?” Hannah asks, and Cas tenses up at that. Billie doesn’t hesitate with her answer, though.
The car's doors creak as he and Dean pull them open, and Cas watches as Dean slides into the driver’s seat easily. The car isn’t anything special to Cas--as long as a car can get him from Point A to Point B, then that’s good enough for him--but he can tell the cracked leather, ancient tape player, and squeaky doors mean a lot to Dean. He almost feels like they’re sitting in a place of worship from how reverently Dean is treating everything inside the car, how his face had immediately brightened with pride when Cas asked if it was his. Dean reaches out and rubs his hand lovingly over the ridged steering wheel before grinning to himself.
Dean rolls his eyes and flops back exasperatedly on their ragged little couch. “That was before all this happened,” he says, motioning between the two of them.
Thanks to Hannah, Cas had finished his work with a good six hours to spare, and Wednesday arrives too soon. After a less-than-ideal subway ride involving overly enthusiastic tourists, a pack of drunk college students trying to find their way to the House of Blues, and Cas tripping over his own feet in his efforts to drag his overstuffed suitcase down the street behind him, he finally arrives at Gabe’s house.
Cas opens his mouth, but closes it again before he says anything. He presses his lips together, and Dean waits. It’s killing him, but he waits.
Dean laughs and gives Castiel a quick wink that makes the man smile embarrassedly, his cheeks going as pink as his sweater. “You’re the furthest thing from bothering me, man,” he says, trailing off slightly as his eyes wander back to the pastry cases, “but, I mean, I wouldn’t turn down one of those chocolate chip cannolis over there, as, uh, penance for your sins or whatever.”
Sam barks out a laugh and shakes his head. “If you’ve seen some of the people my brother’s brought home, you’d
He grins to himself as he unconsciously pulls out his phone and sneaks a quick glance at its screen. There’s a notification for an unread text, and Dean can feel his cheeks flush when he sees that it’s from Cas.
“Dean,” Chuck says, holding his arms out for a hug. Dean only pauses for a second; no matter how much he dislikes them, he’s finally gotten used to hugs as the default way of greeting on the show.
Charlie’s mouse circles frantically around Dean’s FOLLOWERS and FOLLOWING counts. “He follows literally ten people,” she says. “Ten.”
Instead, he’s crammed in with at least 300 other sweat-soaked people in a smelly music club that he’s almost 100% sure is breaking at least three different fire and capacity safety codes. The band’s set is in full swing, and the lead singer has already stripped down to just a pair of jeans, twirling the microphone and cord around like a lasso as he screams the lyrics into the crowd, and they scream right back at him.
Next to him, Dean looks happy. He’s laughing and joking and probably drinking a little too much, but whatever pain he’d been channeling to work on that drawing seems to be gone now. The whole team eats and laughs and shits on each other, until the end of the night, when Kevin shouts that they need to take their annual preseason photo. He herds them all into one side of their table, trying to get everyone looking in the same direction at the same time, and making sure no one looks particularly smashed.
Dean glares at him over his shoulder. “Mixed media,” he says, snapping the cover shut and making a beeline for his room to tuck the thing into the relative safety of his messenger bag.
being the key word there, thanks to the shitty wifi in the apartment--and he can’t go to bed until he knows they’re prepped and will be ready to post in the morning.
No, he’s really not, but he doesn’t want to tell Dean that. They’ve only been running for a few minutes today during a rare late afternoon run, and Cas’ shins are on fire. They started out at a dull throb, but the pain had escalated quickly, and Cas thought that he had it under control, but apparently not.
Cas doesn’t keep him waiting long; the second his palm hits Dean’s, he grins and curls his hand into a fist in an effort to hold onto the spark from Cas’ skin on his.
Dean can’t put his finger on how, but ever since that night at the fire, Cas has been...different. And it ain’t the different Dean usually gets when he tells folks about his preferences; this is almost the exact opposite, something Dean takes more comfort in than he’d readily admit.
After a few minutes and last-minute turns, the robotic voice of Anna’s GPS tells him that he’s reached his destination, and when Castiel peeks out the window, he can’t help but be impressed.
Cas gets to his feet (without any stumbling, he might add) and shakes Dean's proffered hand. "So," Cas says, "your roommate's already locked you out three times this week?"
Dean bolts awake, startled and panting and half-hard, to the sound of an owl’s screech echoing through the night. His gaze darts over to Sam and Cas, who are both still sleeping, none the wiser to Dean and his batshit crazy subconscious.
Word travels fast, and police even faster, so they make quick work of the store. Sam zeroes in on a stack of button-up shirts and grabs the first one that looks like it’ll fit Cas. Dean scoops up a pair of trousers and is heading to meet Sam at the counter when a tweed waistcoat catches his eye. Picturing the way Cas had wanted to look nice back at Bobby’s, how this would look against his eyes, makes the decision easy, and he tosses it on top of the trousers.
Cas looks up at his boyfriend’s question, and almost bursts out laughing at his stunned face, one hand now tangled in his hair while the other grabs for his beer. “She just—did you—did ya’ll hear that? Did you hear what she
“We’re not that bad,” Coach Shurley interjects before Dean or Lafitte can say anything else. He glances at Cas and spreads one arm wide, gesturing to Cas’ new teammates. “Gentlemen, meet our new catcher, Cas Novak. Cas Novak, meet the gentlemen.”
Normally, it’d take a lot for Dean to drag his gaze away from his brother when he’s pissed him off, but Novak cutting into the conversation twice in one morning will do it. The whole thing’s apparently got the same effect on Sam, too, who’s looking like a right moron holding the biscuit up in the air like it’s some kinda precious jewel while he looks at Novak.
“You don’t think they’d make him the villain, do you?” Cas asks, scrutinizing Dean’s answers more closely. A childhood of reading and watching gay characters become villains or victims has made him anxious for Dean’s fate in the hands of the
Fifteen minutes later, Castiel is sitting in Michael’s office, holding an ice pack gingerly against his nose. It’s not broken, thankfully, but it hurts like hell, and Castiel sighs as Michael pulls out a pad of paper.
Cas feels surprisingly calm, even with the tens of thousands of runners packed in around him and Dean, cheers and shouts already coming from the crowds of people lining the route.
“Fuck it,” he sighs, then grabs his phone, digs into his messenger bag for that stupid post-it note, and drafts a new text message before he can talk himself out of it.
“Warn a guy, huh?” Dean huffs out, glaring at Sam before turning his attention back to the guard he’s got pinned.
“How long you been playing?” Dean tries, only to be met with the same results. He rocks awkwardly on the balls of his feet, then tries again. “Don’t talk much, I take it.”
Dean pauses for a few seconds, letting the glow of his phone illuminate his face as he thinks about how to reply that he just saw the greatest show of his life--goddamn it, fuck Sammy for being right--and is now about to go out to eat with the best guy he’s met in a while. FInally, he decides to keep it short and sweet.
“Cas, you’ve seen him,” Gabe says, jerking Cas out of his reverie. “Has he woken up yet? Has he said anything?”
Dean’s getting more and more frustrated with every pitch, and finally, Cas gets to his feet and jogs out to the mound. Dean tries to wave him off, but Cas persists. He watches as Dean toes the rubber with his cleat.
“Relax, Dean,” Sam murmurs, looking off into the distance in that infuriatingly calm way of his as he tries to get a handle on the situation.
Dean chuckles at the reminder of just how big of a nerd his best friend is, but shakes his head. “I’m fine.”
“Is nobody going to comment on the fact that he raised his little brother?” Cas asks, stunned that he’s the first one to bring it up.
Creaking and shuffling echo through their tiny apartment, and Cas mentally checks off each thing Dean is doing: grabbing a snack out of the cabinet, brushing his teeth, probably tending to a goddamn wound or two, and finally, closing the door to his own bedroom to go to sleep. Nothing out of the ordinary, but now that Cas knows “ordinary” is the least effective descriptor for his best friend, everything is suspect.
“Good morning, Michael,” Cas says, getting to his feet and stretching a bit, trying to alleviate the awkward tension both in the air and in his muscles, and praying that Michael doesn’t call him out on anything.
Dean is standing outside the dining hall, and Cas approaches him slowly. He’s listening to music, not really paying attention to anyone or anything around him, which gives Cas a chance to check out his body language, to see if he’s still pissed off. He’s not doing anything out of the ordinary, his posture still relaxed and casual, and before Cas knows it, Dean’s spotted him.
His stomach grumbles loudly, a reminder that he’s skipping lunch to stand in the crowd, and Dean’s tempted to ditch the lottery for today and find a quick meal when he feels himself run into someone.
The camera catches his muttered profanity as the back of his head smacks against the ground, hand cupped protectively over the baby’s, legs tangled in the vacuum’s rogue power cord, and although he’s effectively eliminated himself from the competition, Lisa’s still looking at him with hearts in her eyes.
! Put that down!” She lunges forward and Cas turns around to see the little boy playing with Dean’s cane. Dean’s leaning back, pushing all his weight onto his palms, seemingly without a care in the world.
It’s not fun, but it’s not unbearable, either, and the more stations they approach, the less Cas finds himself giving a shit.
Cas scoots himself closer to Dean and uses his fingers to stretch the hat open so he can place it over Dean’s head himself. “Dean, you’re gonna get hypotherm—”
Cas gapes at that, trying and failing to find the right words to respond. Would Dean really want to do this again? Does
“You’re welcome, Dean.” The flush on Castiel’s face is a light pink now, and it, in combination with his eyes, makes Dean think of cotton candy.
For a brief second, Castiel entertains the idea of acting like everything’s fine, like he’s not on the verge of having a panic attack because he’s too nice to say no to his sister and her ridiculously outlandish requests, but Balthazar catches on quickly. He reaches across the table and pats Castiel’s hand. “How about a beer.” It’s not a question, and Castiel allows Balthazar to order for him.
Once he’s finished, Dean looks up at him with a satisfied smile, and wipes his hand clean before straddling Cas and undoing the cuffs. “Good?” he asks, sliding back down onto the bed with Cas in tow.
Cas is about to nod, but instead, he averts his eyes, trying to look pensive. “I might need some more convincing.”
“I see.” He gestures with the gun in his hands toward the irons around their ankles. “Suppose you boys want those chains knocked off.”
He’s never had a nickname before, but the more he thinks about it, the more he warms up to it. It’s such a simple word, just three little letters, but for some reason, it just works.
Jesus, what does he have to do to get these people to just watch the fucking movie? Maybe if he’s more direct... “Yeah, sure, okay, but for tonight, can we just watch the fucking movie, please?”
It should be an insult. It should be something that would make Cas wants to head for the bathroom and talk himself down from throwing up, insisting on a new rooming assignment, or both. But something about the way Gabe says it, Cas can tell that being a “weirdo” is a good thing.
Before he knows it, the song’s wrapping up, and instead of the relief he’d been planning to feel, his brain is repeating
fashion. “Gee, thanks, Cas,” he says with a grin.” He brings his right hand down to rest on the seat between them, and Cas freezes when he feels the weight of Dean’s hand on top of his. Dean’s hand jerks a little, as if he’s getting ready to pull it back, but after a second, his hand is still there.
“I was nervous.” He starts worrying his lower lip between his teeth—which just makes Dean want to throw himself out the window from lust—before adding, “I thought it might come across as me coming on too strong, especially after...visiting your classroom. I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“The three musketeers,” he says quietly, tapping the pickaxe in his free hand against his boots to knock loose a few clumps of dirt as he drops his arm and the three of them drift apart again.
“Dean’s just annoyed he can’t convince anyone else to switch to his choice of pomade,” Sam pipes up with a smirk.
"Orientation and Mobility. O and M. It's where I learned the basics of how to get around, pretty much. Helped me not to look like a total shit show all the time." Dean shrugs, then grins. "I know it's hard to believe, but I wasn't always this coordinated, Cas. Helped Sam out, too, showed him how to…" His voice trails off as he tries to think of the right word, "…Dean-proof the house, make sure I wouldn't accidentally kill myself by cracking my head open after tripping over something that got left out, or a door that's open or something."
"'Red Arrow Virgin,'" he reads off the sticker, and Dean bursts into laughter. Normally, Cas would be mortified to have all that attention on him, regardless of how short a time it was, and he'd be so pissed at whoever caused the situation, but in Dean's case, all he can do is grin and sit back in his seat.
The skin under Dean’s freckles is flushed now, and Cas smiles. “Thanks, Cas,” Dean says quietly, the beginnings of a smile playing on his lips.
With that, Hannah gestures for Dean to fill in the blanks, and he does. What he’d been thinking, if he thought he had a shot, when he first realized Cas might like him back. Cas contributes answers of his own, and the more they talk, the lighter Cas feels. He goes quiet for longer periods of time in favor of watching Dean laugh, the way his eyes sparkle when he recounts Cas accidentally liking his Instagram post, how he’s all too willing to throw him under the bus for not having been to Bova’s before.
“Well, then,” Cas says, chewing contemplatively on his lower lip. “Looks like we’ve got a lot of work to do.”
Dean holds his thumb and forefinger a few centimeters apart, squinting at Cas through the tiny space. “Just a bit.”
“Please tell me this is fake,” Anna says, looking up at him with wide eyes. “Tell me you have a doppelgänger, or some twin Mom and Dad never told me about,
Sure enough, they’re admitted onto the bus, and Cas sighs in relief at the small burst of warm air from the heater that hits his face as they enter.
Gabe looks genuinely disappointed for a second, and Cas uses the rare moment of silence to lay out on his back, hands resting against his chest. He closes his eyes, hoping to just relax and pass out until they have to catch their flight, but the few seconds of peacefulness don’t last long.
“Saw that, bitch,” he says, stretching further to rest his hand and forearm along Sam’s broad shoulders. He pulls them both closer, making it so Novak’s pressed right up against him, a hell of a bonus if Dean’s ever heard of one.
Dean feels like he’s about to evaporate into a puddle like that chick in that French movie Sam made him watch--Emily, or Amelia, or something--as he flashes Castiel a wide, relieved smile. “Yeah?” he asks.
No matter what, Bobby had always been there. When they’d had to bury their mom on a rainy, windy day in November; when Dean had needed help on a book report and John was nowhere to be found; when John being nowhere to be found for weeks at a time led to them needing two of their three squares. He’d always been there, and there’s not much for Dean to take comfort in lately, but the fact that Bobby still is? That’s more than enough.
comfortable than a backless picnic table bench. He tucks one foot under himself, then the other, adjusting his weight until he’s sitting cross-legged, balancing awkwardly on the bench. It’s somehow still better than the alternative, and, taking a long swig of his beer, he settles in for some reading.
“Who is that?” Cas whispers, and all Dean can do is shake his head, but not the awestruck look he’s sure is plastered on his face.
to think so after the stunt Dean just pulled, but he’s surprised at how good of a job Dean’s done cutting the first sweet potato. Somehow, Dean must be able to sense what he’s thinking, because Cas hears him chuckle a little, then he says, “Not bad for a blind guy, huh?”
“You should do it, Dean,” Sam says, handing the phone back over to Benny before elbowing his older brother with a grin and a waggle of his eyebrows. “No experience necessary.”
Andy scans what’s written on the card before looking up hesitantly, taking care to make eye contact with every man in the room. The only ones who haven’t been asked on a date yet—Dean, Alastair, and Max—are especially interested in what Andy has to say.
Grabbing a fancy dress shirt covered with swirls of flowers, he slides in socked feet in front of Bobby’s ancient full-length mirror and holds it in front of his chest, one sleeve pulled out wide. He purses his lips—as much as he likes it, he can’t be walking around in something so easily identifiable, not when they’re still technically on the lam, so he tosses it over his shoulder and back onto the bed with a sigh.
Dean grins back and sticks out his hand--or at least, sticks it out as far as it’ll go in their current cramped quarters. “Dean,” he says, “
“Like ‘em?” Gabriel asks, smacking Dean hard enough on the shoulder for him to take a stumbling step forward.
“Bullshit,” he says. “I know how you run when you’re feeling good, and this--” He lets out a harsh little laugh, “--
“I can’t believe you live in Boston and had never been to the Middle East,” Dean says, shaking his head disappointedly as they walk hand-in-hand through the night toward Cas’ apartment. “That’s a goddamn tragedy.”
Cas sighs defeatedly, sitting down across from his sister. “I didn’t think I would. He seemed so fake on TV. I practically hated him.”
“Don’t need to.” She fixes the three of them with a look—not a glare, exactly, but something stern enough that Dean knows it’s the furthest thing from their best interest to get on her bad side.
Cas shakes his head, angling his head up and planting a quick kiss on Dean’s cheek. “I believe ‘nerdiest’ went to your insistence for a Batman and Robin couples cosplay last year.”
With that, he reaches forward with his free hand and tugs the Colt’s hood down before bringing his hand to the Colt’s mask.
Castiel heads into his bedroom and digs through the drawers of his bureau--he’s particularly proud of this one, he found it on the curb of a fancy apartment complex in Brookline without a scratch on it--and fishes out a pair of shorts and a T-shirt, changing into them quickly and scooping up his sneakers before heading back to the living room.
Dean cringes at the shattering of glass and the sound of Garth’s whoop as he lines up another shot. Sam doesn’t need to hear anything else; he leans forward, resting both elbows on the front seats and hissing, “Dean, pull over!”
Screaming kids (and screaming parents), flowing booze, crowded dining rooms—it’s like an inescapable college orientation complete with icebreakers and forced laughter and awkward conversations.
Cas jerks at that, and rolls over to face Gabe. “I...what?” he asks, trying to keep his voice as unflustered as possible.
Cas unconsciously jerks against the cuffs, canting his hips up toward Dean, and he can hear Dean chuckle at the sound of the metal jangling against the wood of his headboard.
Dean hams up the surprise for Ben’s sake, but it’s clear that he’s also a little taken aback by the bluntness of the boy’s statement. “That so?”
Cas rolls his eyes and reaches down to scoop up Oliver, who’s made himself comfortable tangled in the blanket around Cas’ legs. “I can’t believe you’re making me do this.”
Cas leans back away from the screen and digs the heels of his hands into his eyes before scrutinizing the photo again. There’s no way--he’s just tired, he’s nervous, he’s going cross-eyed from editing photos,
“Jesus Christ,” he breathes, scuttling back away from Novak, who’s crouched down beside him, staring like he’s never seen a full-grown man having a breakdown before. Dean tries to slow his breathing as Novak continues to stare, then snaps, “Can I help you?”
Dean’s face stays completely serious for an agonizingly long few seconds before he smirks. “Nah, we don’t. They
He takes a deep breath, and his tense shoulders relax. “There aren’t a lot of perks that come with being a runner-up reality star,” he says quietly. “If somehow, some way making people feel better is one of ‘em, you bet your ass I’m going to take it.”
Charlie keeps her reaction simple, just miming a dick in her mouth and nodding toward Cas with a smirk.
And this time, Dean can’t ignore Sam’s look because he pairs it with a harsh smack to Dean’s shoulder. “No.”
Dean claps the driver on the shoulder and grins wryly. “Thanks, man. Hope your brewery gets off the ground soon.”
He doesn’t miss the way Dean’s cheeks go pink at the comment. “Yeah, well,” Dean says almost shyly, rubbing the back of his neck. “Sam’ll be happy to hear that.”
Cas knows he should feel touched, heartened by Sam’s clear love for his older brother, but there’s one particular aspect of Sam’s comment that sticks out, and he can’t help but latch onto it.
Dean’s expression doesn’t change, and Cas charges forward. “The other day, I was the only one in the elevator, and you were waiting, and then the door opened and you were going to get in—I
“Curb,” Castiel interrupts, “to your left.” He’d suddenly noticed that they’d swerved a little from their straightforward route, and Dean, walking on the inside of Castiel closest to the sidewalk, was about to trip over the edge of the curb. Dean stops and takes a few tentative steps to the right until Castiel gives him affirmation that he’s good, then grins to himself.
Cas snorts, a noise that he’s sure is among the least attractive sounds he’s ever emitted, but Dean doesn’t react. “That’s cute,” Cas says, circling Dean’s nipple slowly with his finger.
, not what product I modeled,” Cas says, slowly coming to terms with the fact that Dean thought about him outside of their conversation, even if it was just for a joke.
After a quick detour for Balthazar to refill his prosecco (“It’s mind-boggling to me that you two didn’t spring for the unlimited drink package.
Dean grabs a shirt and gives it the sniff test. “Guess we can’t all be as organized as you, Cas,” he says, smirking. He finds the shirt acceptable; Cas’ cheeks go pink as Dean pulls off his sweaty workout shirt and starts changing into the new one, a worn flannel.
“How about no?” Dean moves smoothly, holding the remote far out of Cas’ reach with the practiced ease of an older sibling who’s mastered the technique of annoying their younger sibling with the exact motion. He clicks on the
Dean sighs. "It kind of bums me out to talk about it, and I'm basically the furthest thing from bummed now, so do you mind if we talk about it later?"
. Why would he want Dean to see him like this, posed and forced and awkwardly taking photos like some kind of pageant star?
All three of them turn to stare at Charlie, who can’t keep a straight face for more than a second after being on the receiving end of their looks of disbelief. “Relax, guys, obviously a joke. Come on.” She rolls her eyes and pops a nacho into her mouth. “What’s his name, Cas?”
This is all riding on him; the music won’t start until he gets his ass in gear. He shakes his hands out, bounces on his toes for a few seconds, and, grinning in spite of himself, extends his arm and takes a step forward.
As he finishes up his shower and steps out onto the bathmat, he’s suddenly struck with another thought--if it hurts when Dean gets shampoo in his eyes. He figures it wouldn’t be a very polite conversation starter, so he files it away as something to ask Anna. She’ll probably laugh him straight out of her office, but now he’s curious.
He can’t think of anything to say, anything that can accurately describe his confusion, surprise, and just a little bit of hope, so in an attempt to hide his own uncertainty about how to handle this whole situation, he goes with, “Are you saying the food in The Restaurant isn’t made fresh to order?”
The man’s peppers-and-diaper scent follows Castiel all the way to his apartment, and at first, he just thinks the smell has burned itself into his nose, but once he unlocks his apartment door and takes a cautious sniff, his stomach clenches as he realizes that the smell has somehow attached itself to him.
Hannah is still sitting at the desk, her iPhone propped up against a stack of medication binders, the box of chocolates sitting conveniently next to her elbow. She’s absorbed in whatever show she’s watching, and doesn’t register Cas's presence until he starts drumming his palms against the desktop.
Dean turns his attention to Billie almost immediately. “That was some mighty fine guitar-playing,” he says with a grin. “Next thing they’ll tell me is you sold your soul to be able to play like that.” He grins at her, feeling an odd need to impress her—or at the very least, get her to
Cas looks up not too long after that, brows furrowed together at the goddamn doe-eyes Dean must be making. “What?”
About forty-five minutes into the episode, Cas is struck by something they’d all passed over earlier.
“There’s my girl.” He gets to his feet and welcomes Lisa back with yet another a dramatic dip, one hand holding hers, the other supporting the small of her back. He glances up at Ellen, who gives him a tiny nod, then at Sam, who flashes a thumbs up, and smiles before bringing Lisa back up and pressing his lips to hers.
Cas opens his mouth to respond, but then takes a moment to study Sam's face, the worry etched into his forehead and the pain in his eyes. It's hard for Cas to believe, but Sam Winchester, all six feet four inches of him, looks small and scared, and Cas realizes that Dean's diagnosis fucked Sam up, too.
When Dean finally looks up with a long exhale, his cheeks are flushed, eyes a little frantic, but when he notices Cas, it’s like a switch goes off. His face breaks into a smile that, if Cas had a bit more self-confidence, he would almost describe as excited. He snaps his fingers and shoots a single finger gun at him, then mouths “One second” before darting off into the back room.
Sam purses his lips, but Dean feels a tiny spark of victory alight when his brother’s got no response other than a stammered little, “I…”
Lisa pauses. “I thought we’d be getting dinner at your family’s place,” she says, trying—and not exactly succeeding—to look casual and not at all panicked as Dean puts the car into park.
Hannah’s got her cat, a fat little Persian named Bagel, in her arms, and waves one of his paws at the screen. “Hello, friends!”
, like he wishes he could just slink down out of his chair, under the table, and into a black hole of nothingness.
It shouldn’t be that hard. Thinking back, it’s a solid plan, yes, but it’s also a simpleton plan. Nothing like the escapes he’d seen in movies (when he’d been able to sneak in), or in the stories he’d stay up into the wee hours of the morning reading to Sammy. By all accounts, it’s fucking
After an obsessive morning in front of the mirror with Anna’s makeup and a baggie of ice, Cas is fairly certain that he’s ready for his first day at Truman High. His nose looks less than perfect, but after countless reassurances from his mother, he’s deemed it acceptable and starts his walk to school.
The walk to the Ansin Building is long and monotonous, just what Cas needs to clear his head. As he gets closer to Ansin, he can hear other music permeating through his headphones, and he pulls them off, draping them around his neck as he listens to the afternoon alternative show being pumped out of WERS. The college radio station always broadcasts their shows out to the public, and that’s part of how Cas had stumbled into the radio club his freshman year at Emerson.
,” he says, pressing the Colt harder against the wall and raising him up a few more inches. “I know you!
Dean lets out a low whistle. “Let me be the first to say that I, as an illustration and animation major, feel particularly useless hearing that.”
Cas shrugs, looping his arms around Dean’s neck and linking his hands together there. “I just...it was all so sudden. Almost immediately after you left, someone walked over, and I felt a gun against my back. They said something about a warrant, about knowing who I was, and I wasn’t going to fight them on it. I thought that if I went without a fight, they’d leave before finding you both.”
“Castiel.” Her voice is stern and unwavering, and Castiel is suddenly struck by how much Anna sounds like their mother in this moment. “It’ll be easier to explain in person, and I can answer every single question you might have, no matter how idiotic.”
Cas gives him, equal parts confusion and disappointment that he’d put the brakes on things, almost has Dean dismissing the entire thing in favor of, well, anything else involving Cas’ hands on him, but Cas stammers out an answer before he can.
“I would’ve been fine!” the other catcher, Garth, insists. He’s a skinny dude, and Cas can’t help but wonder how he doesn’t get bowled over by pitches.
Seeing that faraway look in Sam’s eyes for months on end, him gettin’ sadder and sadder with each passing day...Dean needed something else to focus on, something to distract him from the pain his brother was feeling, and the fact that there wasn’t a thing he could do to stop it.
Dean lays there, finally opening his eyes to stare up at the sky as his daze slowly morphs into frustration. He curls his hands into fists, slamming them down hard enough that circles of dirt puff up through the pebbles and into the air on impact.
“Y’know, crew gets access to all the pictures taken every night,” Dean says casually, and Cas’ stomach flips at the idea of Dean seeing the goddamn fool he’d made of himself just a few hours earlier. It’s almost worse than the fact that he’s already seen the stupid photo sitting on the countertop between them.
“I heard he killed his whole family,” Balthazar says, his spoon scraping against his bowl as he scoops up the last of his breakfast. “In the middle of the night, too. Just--
. He’s all subtle muscles and chiseled bone structures that make warmth blossom in Cas’ gut, and Cas can’t risk Winchester, or anyone else for that matter, noticing his reaction.
Dean chuckles. “Got that right.” Dean’s eyes catch on Sam’s abandoned beer and he grabs it. “He ain’t much of a drinker anyway. Doubt he’ll miss it.” He blinks one eye closed and peers down into the bottle to check for bugs—as if he could see ‘em, anyway—before draining half the thing in two long pulls. “So, hey,” he says suddenly, pressing a fist to his chest and letting out a soft burp. He glances over at Cas to gauge his reaction, and is secretly pleased to see that Cas doesn’t look anything but amused. “If you’d known all this time, why didn’t you pack up and leave?”
As they leave the theatre, Dean feels his phone buzz in his pocket. He pulls it out with his free hand and sees a new text from Sam:
The man laughs, nudging the dog further back into the house before closing the door behind him. “Yeah,” he says. “Yeah, this is it.” He sticks out his hand for Castiel to shake. “I’m Sam. Dean’s brother.”
It’s a typical college acceptance package, the sturdy folder plastered with photos of kids caught in forced laughter, faculty members pretending to teach, a soccer player in mid-kick, a look of intense determination and focus on her face. Cas opens the folder and pulls out the first piece of paper tucked inside.
Eventually, Cas perfects the art of sneaking down to the crew quarters. He figures out the best times to dodge as many people as possible in the hall, commits Dean’s—and Benny’s, can’t be too careful—schedule to memory, and finally starts to get comfortable carrying his fake ID with him.
“Then we’ll make it easy for you, pallie,” Balthazar says, tapping Dean’s elbow with his menu. “Three Moscow mules. And some lobster rangoons.”
“Can I borrow a shirt?” Cas asks later that night when they’re in Dean’s room, getting ready for bed.
Dean nods and points his socked foot toward the stove. “Under there. How many of these should I cut?”
The next day, Cas is sitting on a practically abandoned bus jerking along through Somerville, hoping that Dean didn’t notice his conversation with Sam after returning from their time in the city yesterday. He had made sure to make it quick, to speak in a low voice when he was sure Dean was out of earshot, but he’s still nervous that Dean overheard somehow.
Cas freezes, taken aback by the force in Dean’s voice. He watches as Dean runs a hand through his hair. The sand stuck to his palm ends up in his hair, and he swipes it out with a frustrated sigh, and Cas is supposed to be mad at him, goddamn it, so that’s absolutely
? He stares out blankly into the crowd that, over the past few minutes, has dissolved into chaos, folks clearing the way for more cops to arrest Crowley, scanning the room for more accomplices, escorting Omundson to safety.
Dean grins and takes a few steps out of their row of seats, holding his hand out for Cas to lead the way. Cas nods and starts leading them back out into the real world.
“They lost their luster after a while. Besides, we’ve got more important things to worry about,” Cas says, picking up his pace and hoping Dean would follow his lead. “I told everyone we’d be there five minutes ago, and—”
,” and Castiel can’t help but smirk. Despite the peace and quiet he gets from running while everyone else is asleep, getting up early is his least favorite part of this whole thing, too.
It takes more time than he’d like to admit, but after a few minutes of searching along the riverbank for supplies and tinkering with his boot laces, Dean’s got himself a makeshift fishing pole. He holds it out in front of him, turning it over in his hand to inspect his work. It’s nothing pretty, just a long, sturdy stick he’d chosen because of the stubs of branches he’d used to loop his laces around for stability, but he’s confident that it’ll get the job done.
, a better friend than Dean deserves. Nothing but pure coincidence, a fucked-up display of Dean’s conscience rearing its ugly head—why do
Alistair tuts disapprovingly, like someone might do to a misbehaving child. “Now, is that any way to talk to your hosts, boy?”
segments for weeks. It still makes Cas slightly queasy to think about, and although it’s a small comfort to know that Dean doesn’t think
look at this guy, he’s sure-footed and confident and everything he’d never expect of himself when it came to dancing.
Cas looks at the sketch once more, then places it back down on Dean’s bed. “No,” he finally says. “No, let’s go.”
Instead, Cas shifts his legs slightly so that the bags flop down onto the coffee table, curls his legs underneath himself, and gently rests his head on top of Dean’s, Dean’s arm still wrapped around his shoulders. As Dean shifts in his sleep, snuggling up further against him, Cas decides that he could handle having shin splints again, especially if this would be the end result.
“Mommy’s looking for someone to take a picture of us,” the boy says, pointing back toward his parents, who have just arrived.
“So what’d it feel like?” he challenges. “To have your heart broken on national TV in front of millions of people?”
he likes to run, but doing it with someone else, with someone he's never met, will turn his one activity of solace into a train wreck he already knows he won't be able to bear. As he thinks about this, his stomach clenching with panic at every passing second, Castiel notices the way his friend's eyes wander to follow a cute waitress delivering some burgers to a neighboring table, and realizes that Balthazar probably has other things on his mind than Castiel's dilemma. "Just think of it as a babysitting gig. A long...unpaid babysitting gig where you look after...a grown man." Balthazar pauses for a second, then wrinkles his nose. "Christ, that does sound awful."
one of the most mature books on the shelves these days, and it takes all of Dean’s self-control not to burst out laughing. Instead, he hurriedly shakes his head and puts the comic back on the rack. “That’s, uh, a little too mature for a kid her age,” he says, motioning for them to follow him to the all-ages books. He grabs the first volume of
“Good morning, Dean,” Cas says. Dean starts a little and reaches for his phone, then taps the home button three times. A small ding goes off, and then Cas watches as Dean taps at the screen.
“That doesn’t answer my question.” Gabe and Balthazar keep arguing as they continue forward toward the restaurant, and as Cas grapples with the fact that he’ll have to deal with another one of these things—
The flames flicker with the introduction of the alcohol, and Dean squints against the smoke that starts to burn his eyes.
Chuck pretends not to have heard him, lost in the excitement of competition, and grips Lisa’s arm when Gordon overshoots one of the table’s chairs and grabs its back, slowing himself down and swinging himself back into it. He quickly arranges the table into some semblance of a nice-looking dinner scene, and rests the ring against a small bouquet of flowers before raising his hand.
Jessica only spares them a passing glance and a quick nod, dropping a small stack of notepaper on the table next to Sam’s arm before moving to stand in front of the bench. “Good afternoon, gentlemen,” she says, smiling warmly at them. “Let’s get started, shall we?”
The world seems to move in slow motion as everyone--Vic included--watches the ball. Northeastern’s center fielder sprints after it, staring up at it until he gets to the fence. He reaches his glove up to try and grab it.
“Finish,” he says, voice rough and heady, pupils clearly blown even in the darkness on all sides, and Dean can’t move fast enough. His cock is still slick from spit and precome, and his eyes flutter closed as he thrusts into his own hand.
“I know it’s not one of your strong suits,” Sam calls from a few feet ahead of them, “but there’s this little thing called ‘patience.’ Think you might like it, if you give it a try.”
Cas grins and nods, all while hoping that Dean thinks the reason he’s flushed is because of the sun. He holds his arm out in invitation, and says, “After you, Bob Ross.”
Dean snaps his fingers and thumbs over to the safari icon, then quickly types in “bumblebee bakery lawrence.” It's the middle of the night, no one will answer, and Dean can just leave his message and Cas will hear it tomorrow. It'll be fine, great, problem solved.
“Rude,” Dean says simply. He gets to his feet and stretches a little, toeing around the couch until he pokes Jack, then taking care to step over the dog. “I’m not letting you cook for me while I just lay around. Dude, come on.”
It’s only a matter of seconds until Dean catches him doing so, peeking up over the top of his own menu. “I did some.”
“Whatever you’re salivating over will be there in a half hour,” Sam says. “Right now we gotta focus on getting Cas some new clothes.”
“This is a really good street for running,” Castiel finally says, and feels like an idiot the second the words leave his mouth.
It seems like the entire bar has gone silent around them, Cas’ heartbeat pounding in his ears as Dean purses his lips and considers the comment. He takes another drink and clears his throat.
person his sister should be considering for this job, when he lands on one that actually makes sense. “Don’t I need to qualify, too? Isn’t it against the rules for me to run if I’m not qualified?” He tries to keep the pride out of his voice and the triumphant smile off his face at finding this loophole in his sister’s logic, but his heart drops when Anna shakes her head.
Dean spends most of the next day helping Sam and Jess decorate their venue, a niche little refurbished barn that's
Sam maneuvers himself around so that he’s facing Dean and Jess, his face frozen in surprise. “Castiel?” he asks.
“Sorry, buddy,” Sam says, scratching behind one of Rudy’s ears. “Playtime later, okay?” Rudy drops back down onto all fours and when he does, Castiel hears a tinkling bell for the first time. He looks down and realizes that that’s exactly what it is: a small brass bell, the kind store owners use to announce the presence of entering customers, is threaded through Rudy’s collar and dangling at the base of his neck. Castiel is about to comment on it when a deep, rich voice shouts from the couch in the living room.
“Remind me again,” he says, motioning for Cas to lean in close, “which one of us has been in a fantasy suite?”
can do this. It feels like it’ll never end, but then Dean manages to catch a glimpse of the inside of the car—of Novak trying to get his bearings, of Sam on his feet, back to the door, talking to a couple of grifters who’ve apparently already staked out a claim on this particular car—and uses that to push himself even faster.
thing he thought he’d hear. “I’ve had worse,” he says. “Sammy ran me into a fuckin’ light post once when we were first starting with all this shit. Now
As it turns out, Castiel and his cousin hadn’t seen each other for going on three years, something about Castiel’s father making up some hogwash about him having thrown himself off a bridge or in front of a train, which, Jesus. Dean’s old man had done some shit, but nothing as drastic as
“I didn’t think you’d be that predictable, dude,” Sam says, casting Dean a look of feigned annoyance over his shoulder.
,” he mutters through gritted teeth, hunching in even further on himself and ignoring Cas’ question. “
Cas's head is resting in Dean’s lap and Dean is carding his fingers absently through Cas's hair. He looks up at Dean, who’s got his new scarf wrapped sloppily around his neck, and lets one of his arms drop down off the side of the couch, his fingers tracing along the cover of one of his new books. There’s wrapping paper strewn around in front of the tree from their opened gifts, but Cas leaves it be for now; Hannah won’t mind, especially when he gives her the container of truffles Dean had made just for her.
“I know it’ll be a great episode ratings-wise,” Cas says, “and our downloads will skyrocket, but he’s a dick. I don’t want to talk to him.” He stops making Oliver dance and looks seriously into the kitten’s eyes. “I’m part of this show, too, aren’t I? Shouldn’t
“I, uh, I’ll give you two some time then, huh?” He claps Cas solidly on the back as he walks past with a genuine, “Glad to have you back, man.” His smile’s reassuring, but the knowing look he gives Dean is almost enough for Dean to pull a hand away from Cas’ cheeks to flip him off.
On the train back to his apartment, Cas swipes absently through his Instagram feed. He’d been expecting to feel a lot of things after his dinner with Dean—annoyance, frustration, relief—but disappointment hadn’t been one of them.
“Calm down, guys, c’mon,” he says, waiting for the players to make themselves comfortable in the dugout. Some lean against the fence, others lounge on the bench, chewing sunflower seeds and spitting them at each other. “We've got a new recruit, don't want him thinking that all we do is fuck around, right?”
Novak shrugs. “If I knew, yes. We’ll find it, though.” With that, he pulls something out of his back pocket—a bandana, Dean realizes—and takes a few steps forward toward Dean, who takes just as many back.
Dean nods, desperately searching Cas’ face for some kind of reaction. Cas looks at him, then takes a few steps forward, glancing down at the cuffs still dangling from his finger. “Can we…” He trails off, pointing from himself to Dean and back.
From the way he catches his bottom lip in his teeth to the quick glance he casts in the camera’s general direction, it’s clear that Sam wants to say something else, but instead, he just asks, “Does she make you happy?”
“Where’s Alastair?” she asks, glancing up over Dean’s shoulder to see if the other man had been following him.
, is as good a time as any. He takes a breath and glances hesitantly at Dean, who chuckles as he takes a sip of his drink.
“Curiosity killed the cat, motherfucker,” the Colt hisses, and Cas doesn’t know if it’s from relief that they’re safe, or the fact that the comeback is cheesy, profane, and classic Dean, but he sags against the wall, grinning up at the sky in relief.
Dean feels for them, the poor bastards. It’s only been a few days since he was last in their shoes, but it’s already something he hopes never to have to repeat. The warden’s weaving between them, high up on a horse that looks damn near ready to buck him off. As much a force of habit it is to watch the goings-on, he only decides it’s safe for a quick look once they’ve passed, with Sam doing the same.
Cas gets an apologetic text from him saying that Sam needs help with something and that he’ll make it up to him with pizza the next night they’re both free, and that he’s proud of him for finally “graduating from reviewing hoity-toity movies that maybe three people total have seen.”
When he looks back up, Garth’s gone, and Dean can feel himself getting tense again. This shit just became a lot more real without him. He tightens his grip on the railing, listening for any kind of acknowledgement from the show’s host, a smarmy British chick named Bela Talbot who Dean finds equal parts hot and terrifying. They probably could’ve found a more personable host, but she’s some kind of ballroom superstar, so nabbing her was probably a Herculean effort in and of itself.
“Boy trouble,” Charlie repeats, words jumbled by the pen in her mouth. “Boy tr...you don’t have a b…” Her eyes go wide as she starts to put the pieces together, and she gasps, the pen dropping to the table and rolling onto the ground. “Are you saying you have a
Although Cas hasn't been directly affected by Winchester’s handiwork, he knows plenty of people who've lost parents, siblings, significant others, and friends to the pull of Winchester’s trigger, and would be more than willing to exact a bit of revenge. He’s been the equivalent of a ghost story throughout the Company for years, and now that he’s actually within their midst, people’s curiosity--and anger--is definitely getting the better of them.
Gabe tugs the flower out of his mouth and pretends to sniff it. “Do you have any idea how much I don’t care?”
“Ah, just stuff it on back down there, will you? And you—” Dean feels a smack on his shoulder, “—take over for a bit?”
Cas laughs, half at Dean’s comment, half at the idea of Dean meeting anyone in his family other than Anna. “You’ll be fine. Everyone at the podcast likes you, and they mean more to me than the majority of my family.”
Starting in on the next story, he makes a mental note to thank Benny for turning him onto Saunders in the first place. He’s a few pages in when he hears an insistent tapping coming from nearby. He tries to ignore it; they might be at a brewery, but he didn’t miss the families there as well, so he brushes it off as kids getting into shit. The tapping stops soon after it started, and Dean takes another sip of his beer in silent victory, taking care to make sure none of the condensation drips down onto the pages.
“You don’t need to make excuses for liking someone, Cas,” she says quietly. “I know you feel like you have to, but you don’t. Let him make you happy. He’s obviously good at it.” She gives him a small smile, and he can feel his face getting red.
that been the reason? Well, maybe, but not for the reason Dean thinks. But how does he explain that without sounding like a total idiot?
“I’m sure she wants to get to know everyone,” Victor says. “It’s just limited time. I’m sure she doesn’t mean anything by who she chooses.”
He’s got half a mind to head back to camp just to show Sam his handiwork, but he decides it’ll be even more impressive
The way Dean easily adjusts to the twists and turns of the train, his legs a few feet apart, just slightly bent at the knees as if he’s preparing to drop and field a grounder, it’s all entrancing. He sways his hips unconsciously in sync with the train as it curves around turns, and Cas just stares--at the way his jeans hug his hips, at his tanned, toned arms, at the way he lets his eyes wander aimlessly around the train, not afraid of accidentally making eye contact with someone; he’d already done it earlier in the ride, and just offered the stranger a grin and made small talk about the game. Casual, cool, the exact opposite of Cas while being exactly what Cas wants. Cas closes his eyes and tightens his grip on the bar.
Sam motions for Castiel to follow him to the front of the couch. He takes a seat next to Dean and points to the recliner. Castiel drops his bag to the floor and sits down as well. “I know you still have that acceptance letter from the Marathon, Dean,” Sam starts. “And you haven’t withdrawn yet. You want to do this, even if you won’t admit it, I know you do, and Castiel can help you.”
Cas breathes a sigh of relief when Dean doesn’t mention anything about Instagram. He must not have seen it; Cas must have undone it in time to beat the system.
Dean just stares at him for a few seconds, unable to do anything but grin. He picked him. This guy picked
tourist, huh? Gabe asks, clapping him on the shoulder. “Just go with the flow, baby bro.” He holds up a finger and grins. “Didja catch that? Regular Mark Twain over here.”
They’re close now; the corn’s almost down to nothing, replaced by a slight pebbled incline leading up to the train tracks. Their feet start kicking up rocks as they shift to run along the tracks, but a particularly big one wedges itself underneath Dean’s boot, and he stumbles.
The choreographer, Anna, looks down at him from her position atop the edge of a prop bench, designed to look like the backless slabs of concrete Dean and his partner will be using in just a few days. She’s trying to be patient with him, which makes her a saint in Dean’s book, but it’s hard. He knows it’s hard.
Castiel’s eyes go wide, and he gapes at his sister. “Excuse me?” He doesn’t know how to react to this; how can he be expected to guide someone when he can’t even guide his goddamn self? He also doesn’t run competitively, and he sure as shit doesn’t run with other people. His mind flies through every excuse in the book to try and get himself out of this, but none of them sound daunting enough to convince Anna that he’s the
Castiel swallows hard, trying to fight back the urge to throw up his lunch. He’s successful--relatively, at least--and manages to give his sister a forced smile.
That hurts more than Cas had been expecting it to, and he knows that Winchester can tell. He grins smugly at Cas, and almost on impulse, Cas leans back and stretches out, crossing his feet at the ankles and lacing his fingers together behind his head. “Sure is nice to be able to stretch out,” he says. He feels like an idiot the second he says it, but it’s something he has that Winchester doesn’t, something he can hold over him.
Cas swallows hard in an attempt to quell his anxiety, but he’s not sure how well it’s working, considering he’s on the verge of a panic attack. “I know,” he says slowly, as if he’s talking to himself more than Zachariah, “but I can’t. I’m sorry.”
a message? Dean stares at his phone until the screen goes dim, then shakes his head quickly. He’s overthinking this. He just needs to nut up and--
Naomi’s facial expression doesn’t change when she says, “Oh, that sounds lovely. I’m sure you’ll have a wonderful time.”
“Didn’t answer the question,” Dean says, taking a seat next to Cas while trying to ignore Sam glancing at them every so often out of the corner of his eye.
The music starts to play around him, a faint instrumental version of the song that’ll run until they’re both in position and ready to start. He can hear shoes click-clacking on the stone, getting louder and louder as they approach him, and swallows nervously. Maybe it’s not too late to bail. This railing isn’t too high; he could hop it and just hurl himself into the fountain until they’ve got no choice but to leave him alone to drown his sorrows. He could just—
like this, without being able to see anything. I would be a nervous wreck, and you don’t seem phased at all.”
Dean?The last blind date Anna had set him up on ended with him buzzed and crying in the back of a taxi, and Castiel is adamant that nothing like that happens again. “Anna, I don’t--”
“Oh, would you look who it is,” Dean says the moment Cas unlocks the apartment door, dropping to his knees almost immediately as Oliver trots forward and into his arms. “The cat, the myth, the legend!” He scoops Oliver up and straightens, nuzzling the kitten against his cheek. “You’re even cuter in person, you know that? Your daddy’s photos do you
Winchester licks his lips thoughtfully, and Cas finds himself zeroing in on them. He shakes his head quickly and waves his hand in front of his face, pretending to shoo away a bug. Dean shifts in his chair, giving another futile tug at the ropes binding his wrists.
--” he gestures vaguely at Dean, “--isn’t the Dean Winchester I know. So forgive me for being goddamn concerned for my first and closest friend at Wildwood.”
Cas is about to reach over and grab the fries, tell Dean that he’ll take it from here, but at the last second, his brain reminds him,
should be too, but Cas—Cas and his alcohol-flushed cheeks and gummy smile that shows up just a little more freely now—is what he’s really focused on, and he can’t bring himself to care about much else, including their plans for getting out of here.
Dean kisses exactly like Cas had pictured, slow and tender and deep, and Cas feels like the world has slowed down around them. He catches Dean’s bottom lip between his teeth and tugs gently, producing a pleased little sigh from Dean that has his dick twitching with interest.
Cas watches absently as Dean scrolls through the list, and his eyes dart down to where the remote is headed next. His eyes widen, then, and he tries to grab the remote from Dean. “Uh, how about I surprise you?”
He keeps going, brackets Dean’s wrists above his head, desperately kissing his neck and lips and face, revels in the way he can feel Dean smile against his own lips.
He plops down on the metal bench and extends one leg, then the other, hooking the straps into place. He pulls on his mitt and is about to get to his feet when a voice interrupts his thoughts.
Dean allows Cas to keep his wrists pinned, but he nudges his nose forward against Cas’ neck. Cas takes the hint and releases Dean’s wrists before pulling him forward, struggling to keep his balance as they stumble down the hall.
. The walls are dotted with slightly crooked framed photos and faded old movie posters, which plays a bit more into what Castiel was picturing, but nothing about the rest of the house seems to be out of place; no doors are ajar, nothing is left out in the hall, no random dog toys or treats rolling around.
Dean holds his hand out and Cas threads his fingers through Dean’s, smiling as Dean squeezes his hand before flinging his arm across Cas’ shoulders and pulling him close. He nuzzles his nose against Cas’ jaw before planting a kiss on his cheek.
Dean heads toward a free space and Cas follows him, trying to jog as smoothly as he can with the shin guards strapped to his legs. There’s no way not to move awkwardly in those things, though; he’s never been bothered by it before, but he’s also never been in the presence of Dean fucking Winchester before.
Cas can feel his cheeks go hot in a matter of seconds, and Dean grins and shakes his head. “Sellin’ yourself short, there, champ. And I’ll tell ya, you’re
Dean nods. “And the way you can hear its melody in the background of ‘Hurricane’? Fuck that shit, man, honestly. It’s insane.”
Dean smirks, and is about to tell his brother off again when Novak pokes his head up, and Jesus Christ, Dean’ll never be prepared for that hair, mussed five ways from Sunday and making him look like he’s just stepped out of an adult movie.
It’s a weird way to phrase an answer to that question, but Dean scoops it up all the same. They walk along for a few more moments in a silence that becomes more and more suffocating as they go. Dean’s finally had enough, and he decides to switch gears.
Half an hour later, Castiel is starting in on his third beer and is halfway through a basket of cheese fries, and he’s just reaching the conclusion of the saga that was his afternoon. “And now,” he says, running a hand through his hair and bringing the bottle to his lips once more, “I have to go meet him tomorrow.”
“Too bad, so sad,” Dean says, smacking the side of his brother’s head lightly as he drops down onto the couch next to him.
“Winchester, Winchester, Winchester,” he says, raising his sunglasses so they’re perched on top of his head. “If it ain’t my favorite fairy.” He raises the pickaxe higher, forcing Dean to tilt his chin up even more. “Such a smart mouth on you, though...reckon I could think of a few ways to shut it for you.” Dean closes his eyes, but Heyerdahl holds him in place. “You’d like that, wouldn’t you?”
Michael nods absently. “Why don’t you take the rest of the day off, try and recoup,” he suggests. Castiel glances at the clock on the wall; his shift is scheduled to end in forty-five minutes anyway.
“Weird?” Dean nods knowingly, turning back around and grabbing the second half of the potato to continue slicing. “Yeah, you’ll get used to it,” he says, and Cas feels glad, glad that Dean plans on keeping him around long enough for him to get used to it. He glances down at the jagged aluminum foil and smiles to himself before ripping a new piece and flattening it over the cookie sheet.
. Castiel’s eyes scan the road in front of them, desperately searching out even the smallest roadblock that could cause Dean trouble. When he spots a stick in the road, his eyes widen and he glances quickly at Dean, wondering if it’s big enough for him to accidentally trip over.
“You hurt me, Cas,” Dean says, voice deep and solemn as he presses his palm to his heart. “Right here.”
However, Gabe and Balthazar have no plans to explore that day’s port, and that’s how Cas finds himself deboarding the ship onto San Juan alone, trying to decide if 9:30 in the morning is too early for whiskey. Before he can come to a decision on that, though, he hears a far-too-familiar voice from behind him.
After reading over his words for what must have been the fifth time that night, Cas minimizes the document and clicks over to his browser, where Facebook is open. Photos for the article are slowly uploading--
“Gentlemen,” Chuck says, “the cocktail party has concluded. Now, Lisa will choose the recipient of the first impression rose, then decide who will be moving on to tomorrow, and who will be heading home tonight.”
Dean’s heart soars when he hears Cas belt out, “Perhaps he’ll die upon this train.” He can feel the rumble of his voice low in his chest, and he laughs, pulling Cas even closer before stumbling into the next verse. No one appears to mind the gaffe, though, and Dean revels in the way Cas leans into him, warm and heavy and familiar as they finish up the song together.
They sit there in a silence that’s become more companionable than awkward, for which Dean’s eternally grateful. He palms around behind him until he finds a sturdy stick, then pokes it into the flames to adjust the kindling. More sparks fly up, starkly bright against the inky sky above them, and Dean can’t hold back a cough as a curl of smoke floats in his face.
Cas takes a breath, tries to shove down the nauseous feeling churning in his stomach, and hits the FOLLOW button.
Dean grins, and for some reason, Cas assumes that he's winking behind his dark sunglasses. "Now you're talkin' my language, Cas."
“Well, well, well,” the voice says, smooth and crackling with energy. “If it ain’t the midwest’s newest golden boys.”
“I think they’re still looking for next season’s bachelor,” Cas says teasingly, reaching across the table for Dean’s hand. Dean glares at him and pulls both hands away.
Dean claps him on the shoulder. “Seriously, I’d have no idea that you just got your nose bashed in by some asshole at a concert.”
Alastair flips him off, a pixelated blur at the top of his hand. “Tell me that again once you’re sent home, [bleep]hole.”
"Exactly." He shakes his head affectionately, then looks at Cas again. "I'm sorry, man, I should've told you earlier."
“I’m working on it,” he finally says after a few seconds of silence (and Charlie looking like she’s on the verge of beating it out of him anyway). “Been working up to it, but now I just need to...I don’t know, talk to him.”
sense, considering it wasn’t at all time-sensitive and they knew you were waiting here and...I’m sorry.”
“I would be happy to write something else,” he says quickly. “I know there’s a new film playing at the Brat--”
Cas rolls his eyes. It’s no surprise that his brother would pounce on any chance he could get to break out even the tiniest piece of his eccentric wardrobe collection that’d fit in better at a costume party than in real life, but that doesn’t mean he has to be happy about it.
After a harried weekend filled with last-minute preparations and a trip to the John Hancock Sports and Fitness Expo to pick up their packets, which contain their bibs as well as at least a tree’s worth of paper with information about the race, Dean and Cas are crowded into one section of the Boston Common with thousands of other runners, waiting for the next available shuttle bus to get them to the starting line.
They’ve been drinking water and munching on energy bars for the last couple of hours when their starting corral is finally announced over the loudspeaker. Dean turns to Cas, stuffing the last of his energy bar into his mouth, and smiles, his cheeks puffing out.
It doesn’t take long for the scene to become a mirror of what Dean remembers as the good old days: he and Bobby talking cars and current events, Sam with his nose in a book, sipping his beer distractedly, and damn, had he missed this. The defenses he hadn’t even realized he’d built up at Joliet (and well before, if he’s being completely honest with himself) start to crumble as he sinks deeper into that ratty old couch, replaced by something familiar, something real, something home.
Dean darts forward and snatches the book away from Cas. He looks down at it in his hands, berating himself for being such a moron. He hadn’t noticed the thing was missing for the entire day; he’d even
“Like hell we’re leaving without him,” Dean snaps, trying to pull away from Sam’s grip. Heart hammering in his chest, he’s about to tap another one of the patrons on the shoulder to see if they’d noticed anything when Sam grips his bicep hard and spins him around to face him.
Cas considers this, then snaps his fingers. “You need to buy three tickets for some kind of special deal or something, then, don’t you?”
Dean wouldn’t have been able to forgive himself if he’d slept that night, so it’s almost a relief for him to still be awake, staring up into the slowly brightening sky as morning comes. It’s beautiful, he’s gotta admit: a streaking palette of pastel swirls and warmth that reminds him of the color in Cas’ cheeks. He can feel his heartbeat pick up under his hands folded over his chest, and he sighs, unfolding them and scrubbing them down his face.
Benny opens his mouth to answer, but before he can, Charlie interrupts as she returns to the living room from the kitchen. “What’re we talking about?” She heads over to the couch, nursing a fancy-looking green drink garnished with a cherry that looked way more tempting to Dean than it has any right to be. “Shove over, Winchester,” she says, dropping down between Dean and Benny without waiting for them to make room.
, obviously, and we’re going to get into that in a second, but first, it’s our civic duty to comment on the fact that our baby boy Dean Winchester seems to have moved on from Lisa!”
“Hello, dear,” she says, smiling sweetly at him. His mouth full of food, Dean tilts his chin up in acknowledgement as she sits down at another table. The—if he’s being honest, fucking disgusting—smell of whatever she’s brought for lunch saturates the entire room the second she cracks the lid off the Tupperware, and Dean takes a long swig of his seltzer to try and hide his gag.
“There’s a beach not far from here,” Dean says. “It’s real nice. A little off the beaten trail, so no one really bothers to go there. You in?”
Marathon? Yeah, I’d say he’s doing a little better than okay.” She looks down at the counter, which is etched with initials, and runs her finger across a couple of them. “I miss him, though. Wish he’d come back to hang out, he was always a lot of fun.”
The oven timer dings suddenly, interrupting Dean’s lecture to Cas on the merits of ice cream over frozen yogurt, and Dean raises his eyebrows.
Castiel nods slowly, then remembers that Dean can’t see that. “Sure.” In an effort to avoid some of the impending awkwardness, he bends down and starts re-tying his shoelaces. Dean stays silent, and when Castiel peeks up, he’s just standing there, running a hand through his hair and yawning.
“Shut up,” she chuckles, wrapping her arms around his neck and giving him a long, slow kiss. He rests his hands on her hips and grins before tilting her back to deepen the kiss.
“On nice days, I enjoy taking my lunch outside,” Cas starts. “And when I was out there today, I noticed this—” And the world just seems to drop down to slow-motion when Cas pulls a sketchbook out of his bag.
Sam gives him a knowing nod. "Oh, dude, trust me, I know. Think I haven't tried telling him that? He won't listen, though. He's too--"
Cas opens his mouth to respond, but by the time he manages to get his shit together enough to figure out what to say, Dean’s sidestepped him and is heading down the hall.
Dean raises his eyebrows. “Your ‘people skills’ seem ‘pretty damn good’ to me. You’re doing fine, Castiel,” he says, his voice going gentle on the last sentence.
Dean snaps his fingers. “Yeah, actually. Most people reach up and—” He mimes reaching up for one of the handles of the umbrellas and pops his foot. “Y’know, Mary Poppins shit.”
Cas sucks in a breath and nods, forcing a smile onto his face. “Can I assume you’ll be buying our hot dogs?” he asks.
, Cas pleads with himself, but no matter how hard he tries, he can’t bring his legs to move. His eyes scan the alley frantically, trying to locate the gun the Colt had knocked away, but it’s nowhere to be found.
The chair Alastair is in topples backward onto the floor as Dean starts punching, only to get slammed in the face by Alastair’s booted foot. Dean staggers backward, hands to his nose, and suddenly Alastair’s the one with the upper hand. He straddles Dean and starts throwing punches.
printed in raised cursive that Dean can’t help but run his thumb over. Dean’s got half a mind to tell him it’d make for good kindling, but he’s also still got
“Calm down, prettyboy. Nobody’s getting hurt tonight unless you give us a reason, got it?” With his free hand, the man holds up his middle finger in front of Dean’s face. “How many fingers?” The man holding Cas laughs, and Cas watches as Dean grits his teeth. “Let’s start with you, huh?” He runs his hand down Dean’s body, bending down until he locates Dean’s wallet in his back pocket. He fishes his hand inside, but before he can grab it, Dean lifts his knee and slams it up underneath the man’s chin.
account. All four of them have access to the account to respond to comments, clean out spam, and post their own photos. Cas thumbs over to their notifications tab, where someone has tagged them in a new post.
at first—endless free time with his insanely hot boyfriend to do whatever their hearts desired? Sign him the fuck up—but as the days wore on, the tides started to turn. As it turns out, spending 24 hours a day, seven days a week cooped up together in a cramped one-bedroom isn’t, well, particularly ideal. The prolonged time together unveiled quirks—and that’s putting it nicely; Cas probably would’ve gone with “inconsiderate habits no reasonable human would’ve carried into adulthood” while Dean preferred “stupid fucking things you’re doing on purpose to piss me off, Cas!”
It’s a picture of them kissing back in the studio, Dean leaning right up close and resting his hands over Cas’ headphones. Cas’ tongue runs over his lips as he thinks back to Dean’s pressed against his own, and he can’t help but grin at the idea of Hannah—it
Cas stops, equal parts warmth and dread growing low in his stomach at the sound. Sure enough, when he turns around, Dean’s walking toward him, sunglasses on and a towel slung over his shoulder, a small drawstring bag looped over his elbow.
“No one,” Cas says, shaking his head to rid himself of the image of the crown of Dean’s head moving slowly, methodically, of Dean glancing up at him through long eyelashes as his mouth moves around his dick. He tries to think of something different, but just ends up picturing Dean curled up on his couch, hands wrapped around a cup of coffee, imitating Dale Cooper discussing the finer points of the town’s pie to his assistant, Diane, through his tape recorder.
“C’mon,” Sam says, squeezing Dean’s arm once more as he starts to lead them out of the saloon. “We won’t go far, but we can’t be here.”
“In the drawer across from the fridge,” Dean says. Cas nods and makes his way over to the drawer when Dean suddenly lets out a pained yell that makes him stop in his tracks. Cas whirls around immediately and stares at Dean, who’s hunched over the counter, one hand clutching the other.
Jamming his hands into his pockets, Cas clears his throat and focuses on trying to look casual and relaxed with a close-lipped smile on his face. Dean snaps a couple of photos, taking steps to the left and right to find the best angle. “See?” he says. “You’re a natural.”
After a few seconds, Dean looks sadly at the car, pulled over on the side of another deserted dirt road that looks too much like the one they’d taken to get to Gabriel’s in the first place, and runs his hand along the driver’s side door. “Thought we had something special, baby.”
doesn’t get her attention. The girl gasps in delight and grabs the book from him, already flipping through it as she and her mom head to the register to pay.
Dean’s brows furrow together at that, and he can see Cas perk up from his seat. “Free mo...ten dollars?” He’d tried to hide the disbelief in his voice, but it’s impossible with something like this staring him in the face. “They’ll pay you
His legs dangling down off the edge of the truck bed, Dean stares down at the road moving slowly under his feet. It’s a whole lot of nothing around them, just fields and corn and wheat as far as the eye can see, the world looking just as blank as Dean feels. Sam’s talking about something, some part of their plans and what steps to take next, but Dean can’t comprehend any of it.
He can’t be much older than Sam, and Dean tries to ignore the wave of guilt in his heart at the fear in his eyes and the way he’s gone stiff under Dean’s hands. His eyes are wide and unblinking even as the rain continues to fall, his hands up near his head in surrender. “Please,” he stammers, eyes glancing just once over to his unconscious friend in Sam’s arms, “please d—”
“Dean!” Benny shouts, gripping his friend’s arm harder and pulling him out of the producer’s grip. “Relax, brother, relax. Come on. He’s not worth it.” It takes a lot of work, but eventually Benny manages to wrestle Dean out of the room, taking a second to flip off Alastair as they leave.
“Tell you what?” Novak asks, and hell, Dean hadn’t been expecting anything more’n a glare, so he almost forgets to answer.
He can hear the bustling of the office in the background of his sister’s phone call, and she sounds slightly flustered when she replies. “Listen, Castiel, can I ask you for the biggest favor? Like, ever?”
“Take a guess.” Dean shrugs and resumes looking over the menu. “Your cat’s cute,” he says. “Oliver, right?”
“Or guy’s,” Billie points out helpfully. Cas glares at her, and she shrugs. “Hey, just being accurate, man.”
Cas can’t help but laugh at that, and a warmth grows in his gut at Dean’s smile in response. It’s almost immediately extinguished, though, when Dean’s eyes go dark again. You should’ve told me once you figured it out, Cas.”
"But it wasn't bad at all for our first one. How about tomorrow we go for twelve miles, but do a hill a little earlier in the run?"
“I’m tellin’ ya, boy.” Taking a long pull of his beer, Bobby gestures toward the radio with his free hand. “Welles had folks so worked up and spooked, seemed like the whole town was heading for the hills by the first commercial break.”
Castiel can feel his cheeks burning with the bluntness of Balthazar’s statement, but instead of a rebuttal or dismissal, he says, “Dean Winchester.”
Cas looks around at the walls, which are plastered with memorabilia—photos of famous people who've eaten there, newspaper articles, awards, autographs, and what look like entries for a kids' coloring contest. Each one is a print of a smiling mug, presumably the Red Arrow mascot. Dean points at one of the entries and says, "That one's mine," with a smirk.
He squeezes his eyes shut as they make their way inside, the echoing halls and darkened cells sending an unconscious shiver up his spine. It’s too much like Joliet, too much like where he’d just been a few short days ago—
Sam looks at him flatly, and Dean raises his hands in surrender. “What? ‘S what it is, Sammy. Can we get back to the homicidal robot security guards, please?” he asks, gesturing toward the TV with his bottle.
. He stares at Charlie as she opens and closes her mouth a few times, as if trying to make sense of this latest development, but before she can say anything, a loud, sneering voice crackles through the air.
Cas shakes his head. “No running, it’s just food.” He glances down pointedly at the bags that feel like they’re getting heavier by the second, and Sam finally catches onto Cas’ silent request.
"Shit, right." Dean smiles apologetically. "I eat pretty much all the time, so I kinda lose track of when meals should actually be. Like a hobbit or something."
“Pleasure’s mine.” Dean winks at her and clicks his tongue. Draping an arm across Cas’ shoulders, he holds up his can of beer with his free hand and cracks it open singlehandedly, a move that's hot enough on its own, but that, if Dean ever figured out to use in combination with his stupid tongue-between-the-teeth smile, would absolutely spell the death of Cas.
Dean chuckles. “Well, I mean, you running me into mailboxes and recycling bins didn’t exactly work in your favor, but now, yeah. I do.” Another pause, then, “I like running with you, Cas.”
“Uh, no, I Googled it. Food is an important thing to consider if you’re planning on running a marathon, Dean.”
He had explained to Charlie Dean’s disappointment at not being able to read comics anymore, and asked if she had any ideas on how--or if it was even possible--to create a comic for a blind person to read. After some extensive googling, they had found an example of a comic called “Life,” created by Philipp Meyer, that told a simple story of two people falling in love and having a child. He had made each person represented by their own unique circle of braille dots, and even included panels, adding to the feeling of a comic book.
After a few moments, the kissing stops in favor of pressing their foreheads together, just breathing, taking each other in.
While trying and failing to avoid Cas’ gaze, Dean spends a few minutes pretending to read an old newspaper before he notices a torn flyer pinned under a cup on the coffee table. Recognizing an out when he sees one, he grabs for it and scrutinizes the fine print. “Charlie’s Radio Station,” he reads, looking up at Bobby. “Where every song’s always in tune...Bobby, what the hell is this?”
The effect is minimal, but Cas can see the way that, for a split second, Winchester looks longingly at the way Cas is stretched out and relaxed, and Cas’ chest bursts with pride as he flashes him a quick grin.
“This here’s Billie,” the woman says, gesturing toward a dark-skinned woman with sharp, corkscrew curls sitting on a bench in front of an old piano tucked into the corner of the studio. She’s tuning a guitar she’s got balanced on her thigh, and looks up when they approach, but doesn’t say a word. “She’ll be accompanying ya on your single.”
Dean furrows his brows together at the unexpected question, but answers anyway. “Uh, memes. Inspired by a project I gave one of my classes. Seriously, man, I’m—”
“I—well, we, would like to thank Dean for coming on the show again,” Cas says, smiling at Dean, “and for humoring us.”
“Get a room, huh?” Gabe says, smacking Balthazar on the shoulder before turning to Cas on the other side of the backseat. He smiles widely and hands him a bottle. “For you, my good man.”
Castiel’s eyes dart between the two brothers, Sam looking pleadingly at Dean, Dean’s brow furrowed, his eyes narrow and angry. He wonders if they’ve forgotten that he’s even here. Rudy’s yelps from the other room punctuate the silence, and Castiel wishes he had a stress ball to squeeze the life out of.
Spending the majority of each day with someone who hates him isn’t how Cas would choose to spend his time, and being forced to do so is a nightmare for his anxiety. He and Winchester spend the time awkwardly staring at nothing--and sometimes with passing glances at each other every so often, Cas has come to notice--and occasionally Winchester will throw some kind of barbed remark Cas’ way, but otherwise, things are only one word: boring.
Dean sighs. “Please don’t do this, man. I already have enough people pitying me, or feeling guilty about shit that’s not even their fault. Yeah, it’s weird, I get it, but I
As the race starts to kick into gear, other runners begin to stream past them, which Cas is grateful for; it cuts down on the noise, even if it's just slightly, and gives him and Dean a little extra room to move around.
Despite a few minutes of grumbling that Dean’s become surprisingly used to, his kids pull out their sketchpads or tablets and start toying around with different ideas. Dean grabs a record at random and turns the volume down low, making the mood a little more “indie art show” rather than “high school art class.”
When they finally cross the threshold from the inside of the pen to the yard, Cas’ breath hitches. It’s barely there—so small, Dean nearly misses it—but he’s had enough pretending, and he’s not letting Cas go on panicking like this for no good goddamn reason.
Dean may as well have asked him if he still believed in Santa Claus judging by the insulted look Bobby shoots him. “You think I’m about to be taken for a fool by some goddamn radio show?”
It’s the man’s gun. Crowley hadn’t thought to get it off him before making a run for it. Dean thought his little brother had just been paying his respects when he’d knelt down next to him, closing the man’s eyes, maybe wishing him well into the afterlife, but Sam—smart, quick, sharp as a tack Sam—had been miles ahead.
The idea of yet another person being pissed at him sends Castiel’s heartbeat into overdrive, and he chews on his lower lip for a second before taking his position next to Dean and clearing his throat. “Okay,” he says. “We need to turn around first, though.”
Looking around the scrapyard Bobby’s set up in the back of his house, Dean’s eyes land on an unopened bottle of whiskey. Desperate for something else to do with his hands, he grabs it, unscrews the top, and takes a long swig before passing it around to the rest of them. Once they’ve all had their fill, he takes a step toward the barrel and raises the bottle before pouring the few remaining drops over the clothes.
In retrospect, he should have kicked Gabriel right out of his room the second he suggested going to see a band who had the word “bordello” in their name, but like always, his brother had gotten to him.
“Touche.” Dean holds out his hand and Cas takes it, letting their fingers entwine together. He watches as Dean brings both their hands up and turns them around slowly, as if he’s observing them on a pedestal. “So you’re sure you’re good with this? Because I’m not shovin’ you into anything you don’t want, Cas, I’ll tell you that right now.”
Cas nods. “We’re studying the impact of art and culture on the 1960s, and I thought the students would enjoy something a bit more relaxed to end class before the weekend.”
Dean watches out of his periphery as Cas drops his sunglasses down over his eyes before fanning his own book out, running his thumb along the pages with a drumming
Dean grunts as he continues toward him. Castiel notices a flutter of movement and peeks over Dean’s shoulder to see Sam standing in the doorway, wearing just a pair of plaid pajama pants, and Castiel wonders how the hell
Dean gives him a side-eye that Cas would have to have been blind to miss, but his voice doesn’t betray his emotions when he answers. “I mean, what do you think?” he asks. “It fucking—can we swear on this show?—it fucking sucked. It was embarrassing, getting pity from random strangers on the street who thought I’d been given a raw deal, that I deserved better or some shit.
Finally, they’ve reached the end of the gauntlet of photos, and there’s nothing between Cas and an order of lobster and a slab of chocolate fudge cake.
Dean gapes at him. "Dude, are you telling me we've been at this school for a month and you haven't been to the Red Arrow yet?"
Cas pinches the bridge of his nose between two fingers, then closes his laptop without finishing the video and gets to his feet, digging in his pocket for his keys.
Anna pulls out a chair, taking a seat at Cas’ tiny dining room table. “You really like him, don’t you?” she asks softly.
Cas cringes at the sound of the Colt’s head smacking hard against the pavement, and wonders if he’s finally met his match when the mugger drags him to his feet and slams him up against the wall, as well, only a few feet from Cas, before wrapping his hand around the Colt’s neck.
Omundson’s team had pulled out all the stops for this one: the space is decorated with string lights and lavish streamers as far as the eye can see. Tables and chairs covered in fancy white lace are packed in tight, foods Dean’s never seen before being cut into with cutlery that’s surely worth more than the clothes on all their backs combined.
Cas bristles when Dean mentions the name of the season’s villain and Dean’s arch-nemesis, a cocky, homophobic plastic surgeon with an unbearable voice and even more unbearable social media presence.
Dean grumbles something in the affirmative; Bobby looks at him warily as he reads between the lines of Dean’s response. “You know what, less I know, the better. You boys thirsty?”
He keeps his back to the bench, trying hard not to shiver when he feels the guy’s hand ghost over his collar, from one shoulder to the other, before gently spinning him around and hopping effortlessly up onto the bench. Dean licks his lips, breathing in deep before taking the guy’s hands and looking up at him. When he does, the guy squeezes his hands—just a little, just enough—in reassurance, and Dean takes another breath.
Dean looks down at the cornbread in his hand, dry and mealy and already crumbling through his fingers.
“Those were like my eyes. I’d go into a room from being outside, and it took me a long time to get, like,
It looks like something straight out of a direct-to-video 80s movie: there’s a tacky marble pattern printed on the backdrop, with a large piano positioned in the middle, sparsely decorated with fake roses and martini glasses.
Cas shakes his head and pulls off the Red Sox hat he’d borrowed from Gabe before running a hand through his hair.
Dean tries to play it off, hoping that the flush in his cheeks isn’t as obvious as it feels to him. “Amazing what a good scrub’ll do for ya,” he says, dropping back down onto his seat on the couch.
“Come on,” he finally says, gesturing toward the fire with a nod of his head and getting to his feet. “Before it gets too cold. You
“Yeah.” Dean nods and rests his feet flat on the forest floor so his knees are sticking up. “Yeah. Okay. Tomorrow.” He pauses, squeezing his eyes shut for a second before forcing them open again and blinking a few times. “Night, Sammy.”
Dean lets out a low whistle, running a hand through his hair as he tries to narrow it down. “Ask me in five minutes,” he says, “because I’m just gonna say ‘all of it’ right now.”
The boy waves his words away. “Come on, man, the least I can do is make sure you’re okay after fucking up your face.” Cas can feel the boy’s eyes roaming over his face, and before he knows it, the boy’s gently picked up one of his wrists and is replacing his hand with Cas’ own to hold the napkin in place. He takes a few steps back and studies Cas, who straightens, pressing the ice a little harder against his throbbing nose.
“On three,” she says, and Cas sighs before forcing his mouth into a smile as he looks over at his brothers. “One, two…”
Balthazar throws up his hands in frustration. “Jesus, Castiel, I’ve apologized for that, haven’t I? More than once, if I recall correctly.”
It takes a few minutes, but eventually, Cas can feel Dean’s body go lax under him as he starts to doze off, and he grins up at Dean’s sleeping form. Dean’s head is tilted back over the top of the couch and he’s snoring softly, his mouth slightly ajar. He’s stopped carding his fingers through Cas's hair and is simply resting his hand on top of his head now, and Cas hasn’t felt this content in a long time. He’s only got a few minutes left of his break, but suddenly, he’s got the energy boost he needs to finish up his last few hours before he can go home with Dean and they can spread out on their own couch in front of their own tree.
“You...didn’t handle it well?” Castiel says hesitantly, trying to get the conversation back on track to Dean’s history instead of his own awkward blunders.
Dean cackles, smacking Sam’s shoulder—a little harder than he’d meant to, so sue him. “See? What’d I tell ya?”
“Listen, pal, if you’re gonna off us, I’d rather you skip the soapbox and just pull the trigger right fucking n—”
Cas rubs one eye and waves Dean off. “I wasn’t asleep yet. It’s fine.” He nods toward Dean’s gear. “Going somewhere?”
And there goes Cas trying to build up his minimal self-confidence again, because for a second, he swears Dean actually looks a little disappointed that he’s leaving. He covers it quickly, though, and waves Cas down. “Hey, hey, hey, you just gonna leave me hangin’ here?” he asks, gesturing down to the photo.
"Hi, buddy," Cas says, giving the dog a small smile as he bends down to scratch behind his ears. While he's scratching, Cas glances up at Sam. "Where's Jack?"
He keeps his eyes closed most of the time, peeking at Dean every so often--just out of curiosity, sue him--and seeing that his eyes are closed, too. He can feel Dean’s lips form a smile against his own, and he smiles back, catching Dean’s bottom lip in his teeth. It’s not long after that that Dean pulls back--though not before planting a few sloppy kisses on Cas’ neck--his lips shiny and full, and Cas’ stomach flips a little at the thought that he did something wrong to cause Dean to stop.
“I’m sure you can,” he says, “but we probably have to get back to the mansion now, huh? I know the other guys are dyin’ to spend some time with you.”
“Avaste ye, matey!” Regular Kid yells, jabbing at Frog Hat with his fossil. Frog Hat executes an unexpected parry to dodge the blow, and Castiel raises his eyebrows, momentarily impressed. However, not only is the fight ridiculously one-sided--the femur is much bigger than the triceratops horn--it also opens the Museum up to at least five different lawsuits, none of which Castiel wants to happen during his shift. One more quick glance Balthazar’s way shows that he has zero interest in trying to break up the sparring match, so Castiel gets to his feet and heads toward the boys.
He takes a breath as he turns around and prepares to reenter the sea of people who have taken over West 46th Street, all of whom are undoubtedly experiencing the same weird mix of emotions he is--equal parts anxious and excited and slightly nauseous. The show’s star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, will be out in the next few minutes for today’s HAM4HAM show, a little skit he puts together with the cast, crew, or random special guests as a thank-you to everyone for entering the lottery, and people aren’t budging, even though Dean is trying to get to the
Dean nods and presses the CALL button under the bakery’s Google listing. His phone connects almost immediately, and he waits, his heartbeat quickening with every ring until Cas’ recorded voice suddenly fills his ear.
“Uh, those look good.” He tilts his chin toward the cookies, and Castiel looks down at them as if he had forgotten they were in his hands.
And if Dean’s tried on more than one occasion to mix a color that matches the blue of Cas’ eyes ever since that first meeting, that’s no one’s business but his own.
Dean gives her a small smile before the camera pans down to catch the way he squeezes her hands reassuringly. “He’s in charge, far as I’m concerned.”
Cas shifts his weight from foot to foot, stroking his thumb absently along Dean’s wrist. “I’m not sure I’m comfortable—”
Winchester’s eyes are the first thing Cas sees, and he notices the subtle way they widen when he finally enters. Cas finds himself intrigued by the way they’re still bright and defiant, even after last night; if he were in Winchester’s position, he’d be on the verge of tears right about now.
He’s got a lesson to plan for tomorrow—he wasn’t bullshitting about that—and apparently 25 cards to draw.
Cas huffs out a quiet little laugh, breath hot against Dean’s skin. “Are you looking for a contest in one-upmanship, Dean Winchester?”
Cas feels a lump form in his throat and grips his phone tighter when he sees the photo, the selfie the girls had snapped with Dean earlier that night. They’d used every
Hell, even when he glances in the rearview mirror, he can’t help but grin when he sees Novak smiling at him. Before he can think twice, he extends his hand back, wrist flipped back to leave his palm exposed in a silent request for a high-five.
Dean swallows hard as they grip each other’s forearms, spinning for two counts before breaking the contact to lean back, arms wide, hands splayed.
Shaking his head, Cas clears his throat. “No,” he says. “Having children, though...that’s always been a bit of a sticking point between my family and I. It just caught me off guard.” He glances around at the mess of spilled and spit-up beer before looking up and Dean and Sam sheepishly. “I, uh, apologize for the mess.”
“The sky, dude. It’s already getting warmer, so is it sunny? Does it look like it’s gonna start raining? Is there a
“Old enough to appreciate a good game of B-I-N-G-O?” Gabe asks hopefully. When Cas shakes his head, Gabe pouts, but doesn’t try to argue anything further.
Cas ignores him, opting to start digging into his chicken wrap instead. He’s only a few bites in when Dean waves his hand vaguely at him in a half-assed attempt to get his attention.
Castiel’s cheeks redden furiously at Dean’s indignant tone; apparently everything pop culture had taught him about interacting with blind people had been a lie.
Dean doesn’t answer him, but his rapid breathing reminds Castiel that he hasn’t run in a while, so he decides to slow down the pace a little more, thinking Dean would appreciate it.
Back at the house, they’re greeted by an extremely enthusiastic Rudy, the bell around his collar chiming as he bounces around at their feet, panting excitedly and begging for them to pet him. Dean obliges for a few seconds before nudging the dog aside, running his hand along the hallway wall until they get to the living room.
All the other classrooms at Thompson High are right at home in the 21st century, whiteboards and smartboards and a shit-ton more boards than they generally need, but due to “aesthetics”—which, Dean’s not a fucking idiot, he knows that’s code for “budget cuts”—his room has been left in the dust, literally.
Lisa smiles back at him and leans across the seats in the Impala, resting her hand on Dean’s thigh. “I trust you,” she says, craning her neck up and pressing her lips to his. They kiss for a few seconds, Dean resting his hand on the back of Lisa’s neck, rubbing his thumb gently behind her ear. Dean exits the Impala and hustles around to the other side, opening Lisa’s door with an over-the-top bow, and she giggles, smacking his hand away.
“Ah, shit,” he breathes. He glances at his plate, then at Cas, before dropping the fry that was in his hand and heading over to the girls. Cas watches as he rests his hands on the arms of one of the girls who’s started tearing up, rubbing them comfortingly and talking quietly to her. She looks like she’s trying to pull herself together, but is failing miserably, so Dean envelops her in a hug and almost as if by instinct, she buries her face in his shoulder.
“I’m getting some actual snacks this time,” Jess announces as she straightens up. “You two, don’t kill each other while I’m gone.”
“Christ, I thought you were dead,” Gabriel says, taking a step back and resting his hand on Cas’ shoulder.
Seconds after he hits ENTER, he hears a chair roll backward across the creaky office floor and isn’t the least bit surprised to see his coworker Hannah standing expectantly at his cube.
Cas squints past all the runners in front of them, and after a few hundred yards, he can see the finish line. He wants to start smacking Dean with excitement, to draw his attention to the fact that they’re actually going to
“Let’s go, Vic!” Cas yells from the dugout, looping his fingers through the holes in the chain link fence. “You got this!”
Dean twists out of his brother’s range of motion and points a warning finger his way. “Watch it, Sammy.”
As Cas tries to reassure himself of the fact that his secret will stay that way, their waiter approaches the table and greets them. “Hi, welcome to The Restaurant,” the waiter says quickly, passing out menus without looking up, and Cas nearly falls out of his chair when he hears his voice. “My name’s Dean, I’ll be takin’ care of ya. What’ll you have for drinks?”
Part of him, a small, microscopic part way at the back of his brain that he shouldn’t even bother listening to because it’ll never fucking happen, also kind of hopes that he and Dean become close, close enough that he can ask Dean about it himself.
"Listen, Cas," Dean says, his voice tight, and Cas can tell he's trying hard not to snap, "wanna trust me on this? I know what I things I can and can’t do, and cutting shit is one of them." He remains silent for a moment, and Cas is about to apologize when Dean repeats, “So, like regular fries?"
Dean barks out a laugh and pushes himself away from the fridge. “Sam thought it’d be funny,” he says. “Hilarious. Obviously.”
She’d sent Bachelor Nation into a frenzy when she’d muttered, “I feel like I just met my future husband” at his retreating back; hell, Hannah had almost fallen out of her chair, and Billie had thrown popcorn at the TV screen. That opening half hour set the stage for an episode of sheer insanity, from a group date focused on love languages that got touchy-feely real fast to a one-on-one that could’ve doubled as a therapy session.
He looks down at the photo once more and grins before meticulously folding it and tucking it into an envelope. He seals it, flips it over, then addresses it to Zachariah Adler.
“You know what, Dean?” Jess says suddenly, getting up from her position next to Sam and walking toward him. “I'm sure we could all really use something to eat, some snacks to help us finish up everything for tonight. Could you grab us some? Your choice.” She gives him a hopeful smile and Dean grins.
, Billie had been the one to make it clear that she didn’t want their friendships and conversations to exist only to be recorded; if they were going to make a podcast, they needed to carve out time to just talk like regular friends, too.
"Dean Winchester," Castiel breathes, testing the name out on his tongue. It sounds rough, rough but warm--rustic, maybe--and as much as he doesn't want to, Castiel finds himself liking the sound of the name. He looks down at the paper again before closing the folder and resting his palm on it. Keeping it there, he glances out the train's window and notices that they've reached the stops that are above ground, and that the city is slowly tucking itself in for the night. Cars are becoming more scarce, a few straggling pedestrians are making their way home, everything seems to be slowing down around the train. Castiel's eyes catch the moon, half-shrouded in clouds and hanging high in the sky, then glances down at the folder once more. Castiel takes a deep breath and softly, hesitantly, mutters, "See you tomorrow, Dean Winchester."
“Just a little,” Cas says, and his heart swells as the boy grins again. “You really don’t have to do this, though, it’s--”
Before Dean can finish his sentence, he notices Crowley’s eyes dart over in Sam’s direction, and he gives someone a nearly imperceptible nod.
No camera angle or lighting shift can hide the way Lisa’s face falls at that. “Oh. Oh, of course. I just, are you sure I can’t help you to feel better?” She trails her finger along his jaw and down the buttons of his coat, but he doesn’t move.
Heyerdahl keeps him still for a few more agonizing seconds before pulling the pickaxe away and letting Dean’s head drop with it. He shoves the tool into Dean’s fumbling hands and spits close to Dean’s feet. “Get out there and do your goddamn job before I change my mind. Now.”
He glances over at Cas and grins, half apologetically and half expectantly, a silent question of breakfast plans, and suddenly, Cas knows where they’ll go.
the little asshole everyone’s been talking about on the news.” He studies the Colt slowly as he struggles against the grip, pulling desperately at the fingers around his throat. He lets out a pained gagging noise as he tries to suck in some air, his feet now dangling a couple inches off the ground.
“Yeah, that’s it. It’s the best,” he says indignantly, sitting up and turning toward Cas, his brow furrowed. At Cas’ silence, he asks, “Are you telling me you think a comic with that premise isn’t the fucking best?”
The rest of the night with Dean’s family passes in a blur, with games of pool, darts, and foosball bookended by more beer and food. Lisa slips into the family almost seamlessly, and with every passing minute, it becomes more and more evident how infatuated Dean is with her.
“Easy for you to say,” Alastair growls, “with that stupid rose on your stupid [bleeping] shirt already.”
“Good going, Winchester,” he says to himself, and for the first time in recent memory, it’s not said sarcastically. He likes the feeling.
He looks up quickly and finds Castiel staring right back at him, eyes wide, a tray of fresh cookies in his hands.
Dean’s gut twists in surprise as Sam whips around to look at her, wide-eyed. His gaze then darts over to Dean, who shakes his head and mouths,
“You heard her,” Billie says when Cas glances at her and Hannah for confirmation, and he takes a breath, watching as a few drops of condensation race down his glass.
Sam clears his throat, and Dean looks up. His brother’s got his hand loosely around one of Cas’ arms; Dean takes the hint and curls his fingers around Cas’ bicep. They start back toward the exit, and Dean lets his thumb brush against Cas’ arm in a gesture he hopes comes off as reassuring.
Cas wants to respond to that. He wants to say something snarky, something quick, something that Dean Winchester would say to him had the tables been turned. But he can’t. Instead, he focuses on his food and they eat in silence for a few minutes until Cas hears Dean drop his fork onto his now-empty plate. He looks at Cas.
Hannah, Billie, and Charlie let out one long collective gasp, then immediately start asking Dean new questions. Will he be on the beach from the start, or show up later? What’s his strategy? Is there anyone in particular he’s hoping to see there?
The next few days pass in a blur of nothing but work, art, and Sam, something he considers both a blessing and a curse. Sure, he doesn’t run the risk of coming across as a goddamn idiot to Cas, but he also doesn’t get to see or interact with Cas.
, and Dean can’t stop his mouth from falling open. He stares at the sign for a few more seconds, then turns back to Castiel and Anna. “That’s me?” he asks finally, pointing awkwardly to himself. “I’m that Dean?”
for this, wants to tackle Dean—or let Dean do the same to him—without another word, but he decides to play his cards carefully instead. He crooks a finger through one of the cuffs, letting them dangle from his hand, and turns around just as Dean says, “Is it really that hard to find a sh...it.”
But Garth doesn’t dignify him with a response, instead grabbing for a pistol tucked in the waistband of his pants. “Keep her steady, now, friend!” he shouts. Gripping the door even tighter with his free hand, he leans further out of the car, aims, and fires.
Dean grins, green eyes sparkling—from booze or the moonlight, it’s hard to tell. “You’re tearing me apart, Lisa.”
