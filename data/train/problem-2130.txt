John checked his phone – just gone five.
An hour later, they were well into a mock game, John trying his hardest to perfect the new strategy their coach had introduced, his progress slow as he tried to wrap his brain around it.
“What are you, five? Don’t be so close-minded.”
“I’m not going to doggypaddle, I refuse,” John replied. “Just teach me how to not look like an idiot.”
However, having a small ball of rage for a sister had taught John well. Being angry with an angry person was enjoyable in the short term, but it would leave him wracked with guilt into the small hours. Also, despite his temper wearing thin, his concern for Sherlock was growing. The boy was looking more and more emaciated by the day. So John hopped down from his bed and asked, “I’m going to make a cup of tea, d’you want one? Sherlock?”
“It was only a dream. Go back to sleep, now, John. It’s alright.” John clasped his eyes shut. His breathing slowed, and gradually, he fell into a dreamless sleep.
John was walking, and Sherlock’s breath hitched when he saw him limp. He shook his leg, bent down, stretched it, straightened up, shook it again. And when he put weight on it again, it seemed better, and Sherlock breathed out.
as Sherlock put it, with his friend’s experiments, but he crossed to him without a word. Sherlock pushed the instrument towards him a little, and John ducked his head and looked through the eyepiece.
“Fuck.” John said, turning around to face Sherlock. “I remember now. Like the one that killed Mr Bradstreet’s pets, right?”
“What?”
*plugs my
“Shh!” he hissed. He sniffed again and – to John’s horror – stuck out his tongue and licked the paint. “Zinc,” he muttered. He wiped his thumb along the body of the ‘i’ and rubbed his digits together. “Hardcore propellant…” he turned to John. “How good is your knowledge of brands of spray paint?”
A tiny ‘hello again, how were the hols’ text, nothing worth writing home about, but a text from Sarah all the same. John had thought all hopes of them meeting up again had been fried by Sherlock’s… well, by Sherlock, but maybe luck was on his side. John sent a message back, and was waiting for a reply when -
“We, gave away your old uniform, Sherlock,” his father said. “We’ll have to buy you some more tomorrow,”
Sherlock nodded.
“But when we first met him…” Mike laughed drily. “We were thirteen. He joined in year nine, two years later than most. First time in a big boarding house for all of us - the lower school's boarding house was tiny, modern. Homey. Eased us in. So when we got into Doyle, everyone was trying to be really grown up, acting older than we were… there were a lot of fights in the first few weeks. I think Sherlock was home-schooled before coming here, so I don’t think he really knew how to be around people, you know?” John hummed his acquiescence, brows furrowed in thought.
He sent the message and then watched John. He saw his eyes flick to the top of his screen and his frown vanish as his phone received it – but the frown quickly returned. He dropped his phone from in front of his face and opened his mouth to say something, but Sherlock put his finger to his lips and shook his head. John rolled his eyes and picked up his phone again.
He turned left out of the door, and walked down the path that ran alongside the library’s exterior and bordered on the rugby pitch. As he grew nearer to the cluster of boys, he realised he was clutching the books to his chest, and he forced himself to relax, holding them down by his side.
He held up a newspaper cutting, a tiny block of text headed by the words:
John heard the door of the shower next to him open and close and the water turn on.
John looked up as he noticed Sherlock in the doorway. Sherlock thought he must have looked like a lost child, with a bundle of clothes in his arms and bare feet.
“Hey, girls, John thinks I’m just about good-looking enough to let me stick my dick in you,” he said sarcastically. “Not exactly a killer pick-up line, is it?”
After a few deep breaths, he began to take in his surroundings. His duvet was scrunched up in a ball at the end of his mattress, his pillow askew. He looked to Sherlock’s bed – empty. The curtains were open, and the grey light of early morning filtered into the room. The room that felt too large, all of a sudden.
“Uh, at home, why?” No reply. “Is everything okay? Sherlock?”
“If this were a horror movie, we’d both be screwed,” John said.
A look at Sherlock told him his friend was feeling the same thing. The coloured lights from the stage danced over his pensive features, and John stifled a yawn as the song ended to copious applause.
John. John comes back. All the time. Even after he grits his teeth and shouts at him and purses his lips and walks out in that very careful way he does when he wants nothing more than to stamp. Even after his friends call him away to… to do whatever it is they do together. Even after that, John comes back.
“Everyone on the porch kept shouting ‘Go on the lane! Go on the lane!’ and dad asked me if I wanted to and I shouted ‘HELL FUCKING YEAH’ because I was really fucking excited and mum yelled at me from the porch because she heard. Dad laughed and said ‘All right then, John, when you’re ready, just ease out and the road is yours.’
It was always busy along the banks of the Thames, and that day was no different. He stood leaning on a railing, mesmerised by the murky water slapping against some rotted-looking pontoons and the stone that kept it where it was supposed to be.
“Out cold?” Lestrade mused, going to his fridge and bringing out a packet of what appeared to be ham. “That boy is rarely asleep at all, I don’t know how you put up with it.”
He had bought an armful of newspapers and was sitting on a bench in the park when he got a phone call from Mycroft. He ignored it.
“Someone will die if we tell anyone about tonight.”
name. Doesn’t teach me, though,” was what he said.
Bill threw up his hands. “Alright, alright. Why don’t you get your dyke of a sister to take you to a gay bar, cheer you up?”
Sherlock’s voice replied, and Harry was a little surprised at the acidity of his tone. “Tell Eddie – ”
Finished with the mop, John returned it to the supply cupboard as Jamie checked the pupil in. As he did so, his eye was caught by the cupboard Dr. Smith had shown them during their induction - the one full of chemicals which he had warned them not to touch.
“Nothing.”
Freckles – Charlie – turned to John and raised an eyebrow in challenge, and John realised he was cornered. He took the remote from Mike and sat down heavily next to his opponent in front of the telly, crossing his legs.
“I can’t, that’s the whole point,” John said. “We’re sharing it, or have you conveniently forgotten?”
Harry appeared at the top of the stairs.
posting something, but of someone mentioning his own username in a comment. John navigated to the post - the first one
“You thinking of doing that work experience thing?” John asked Sherlock that afternoon. Sherlock looked up from the eyepiece of his (stolen) microscope and fixed John with a look that could have caused entire armies to drop their weapons and scamper away in retreat.
“Why don’t we hear what you’ve got already?” Lestrade prompted.
“Oh, really? Anyway, Anderson and Sherlock were always somehow bumping into each other, and Anderson would beat him up if he got the chance, but only if his little pack of disciples was around to goad him on.”
Sherlock wanted to read over it again, and again, and take a cutting, and keep it, and he hadn’t felt this need to hoard since he was small and collecting interesting-looking stones to put on his bookshelves. It made him feel as if he was sitting on a table in the library in the dead of night again, reading by phone-light, but everything was different, in ways he couldn’t ever have imagined or explained, but in ways that made his blood feel a little hotter, his pulse a little faster. He was scared, for a moment, but it was alright. It was okay. Because there was someone else beside him, someone who had written about him so openly and unabashedly in a newspaper hundreds of other people would read, someone who didn’t care about those hundreds of other people at all, and who had waited to read it until they were together, and who was now asking his opinion, as if it was the only one that mattered.
The boys seemed to be surrounding something, and as they parted to let John through, Sherlock saw that it was Lestrade, a piece of paper and a pencil in his hand. The crowd began to close up again, but Sherlock felt a hand grasp his arm, and he was pulled through to the front.
“I’m undecided.” Sherlock replied. “Your tone implies you expect me to.”
“Percy,” John said, voice low. The boy’s eyes were wide. “You can go and take a minute if you like.”
) but in this chapter those drinking are 16-18 years old.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” John said. “How was Latin?”
“John!”
“Why did you – ”
“Go back to sleep, John.” Sherlock’s voice cut through the dark. He was standing by the window, a towel in his hands. “It was only a dream. Go back to sleep, now, John. It’s alright.”
“What lesson was your brother supposed to be in third period?" Sherlock asked.
“I think I know where they are.”
Planets coming back on their orbits – or stars or whatever it was – would imply, coming
By the time Sherlock and John returned home, the sky was beginning to darken, despite the afternoon having only just begun to slide into evening.
John watched in amazement as Sherlock smiled at their house master as if the whole situation was hilarious.
Time to get up.
They were roommates. John, so polite, so amicable, had to be friendly towards him. It was what roommates did.
“I agree,” said Sally. “People will be starting to come back into house and we can’t have people seeing
John began spraying again. “Well, you would think so, wouldn’t you,”
Sherlock smiled at him, and John flipped the switch of the lava lamp that was sitting on his desk. Sherlock turned off the ceiling lights and the room was lit up with a dreamy red glow.
John turned away, glad that Sherlock could no longer see his face. He was suddenly too tired to keep it neutral. He had one hand on the cool metal of the ladder when Sherlock spoke again.
“He teaches Italian, yes?” Sherlock asked, and Anderson affirmed it. “And does he have any friction with any particular boys in the house?”
“Fine,” John grumbled, and did as he was asked. He felt his shoulders bunch up and tried to make himself relax, despite that not knowing where or when Sherlock was going to touch him was making him a little uncomfortable. When the touch came, it was soft, and good thing, because John flinched a little from surprise as Sherlock smoothed the sponge beneath John’s eyes. A myriad of colours swirled across his vision as Sherlock swiped the cool pad firmly over John’s closed eyelids, then cheeks, and hummed.
“No, that’s okay, I have the index number. I’m really sorry, but I know you from somewhere and I just can’t place it.” John prompted.
“Wait, wait, wait,” John interrupted, amazed laughter pulling at his voice. “You’re saying you’ve been stalking that Instagram page? Barty’s bulletin?
“What did you imagine?” she seemed amused.
John grinned at Sherlock, but the gesture wasn’t returned – John wasn’t even sure if his friend had noticed.
Harry nodded. “I’ll see you tomorrow afternoon. Bye, Sherlock.”
John blinked. His eyes stung and there was a lump of words in his throat that had been tangling for months and something had triggered his verbal gag reflex and now there was only bile, yellow and sour, viscous, eating at the walls of his neck.
“What are those?” she asked, and Sherlock explained, finishing with by telling them about John’s involvement with that particular issue.
“So why couldn’t you talk earlier? Was I interrupting something private?” John asked, with an expression that Sherlock had sometimes seen other people use when they were being lewd or suggestive, and Sherlock suddenly realised that John was joking about something sexual, about Sherlock himself doing something sexual – but John knew that Sherlock had no sexual partners since Victor had been taken into the iron embrace of the law, so what was he-? Oh.
There was a pause that seemed to stretch on for eons.
now? Like, right this second?’
“John, I have already completed AS biology, last year, and I was finding the Upper Sixth work insufferably easy and I’d only been there half an hour. I will die of boredom, my brain will rot from lack of use…”
John thanked her and waited until she’d bustled out of the room again before crouching at Sherlock’s bedside.
John thought. “I guess not. I don’t blame her, to be honest.”
“Nice work, the stuff about me. Very inflammatory.”
“Can’t believe the government has the nerve to put those things around kids,” she muttered, stabbing a sausage. “And around kids who’ve seen their own families be torn apart by them. Disgusting.”
“Not a good thing, Sherlock,” John replied. “How was anthropology? Oh, wait, don’t tell me – boring?”
They went back to silence for a while. Sherlock watched John. His breathing rate had slowed right down, so much so that Sherlock wondered whether he was holding it. In fact, he was certain he was, at points – when he was drawing a particularly delicate or precise line, Sherlock imagined. His eyes were almost black in the night that was rapidly spilling through their window, the sun having disappeared below the horizon about half an hour ago.
“Now, finally, the overall winner. This year’s was perhaps the toughest competition I’ve had to judge and, honestly, you could present a very compelling argument for every house to win. However, after much deliberation, the other judges and I whittled the choices down to our top three. If we could have the three heads of houses come up after all the winners have been called, that would be most efficient. Right. So, in third place, for a surprising unearthing of trumpet prowess and genuinely making me want to dance, Collins, with
“Never have I ever got with anyone in more than three counties of this fine country.”
Resting on some kitchen roll in the centre of the table was a pumpkin, lumpy and a little earthy on one side.  Next to the microwave lay John’s sketchpad, tossed carelessly to the side as if John had been distracted by something. An open nearly-empty bottle of red wine sat on the countertop, the metal cap on its side on the floor –
He heard Mrs Hudson sigh and Tom cough uncomfortably.
“Right,” the head master said. “It’s not every day that you hear a young man trying to convince you that he was, in fact, committing a crime.”
“So you’re saying that Raj from down the shop
John twirled each nut once between his finger and thumb before putting it into his mouth.
“I mean,” Anderson went on, “How could she forget my literal fingers up her – ”
“Is that shirt…?” Sherlock prompted.
“Which one’s that?” John asked.
“But you spent – ”
“No, I’m not, I’m
“That was effective,” Sherlock was saying. “Léa looks as if she got the message.”
John sighed.
“Really?” she said absently.
“So, what? God is irrelevant?”

“Okay. But you have to promise that – ”
“You can say that again,” muttered Mike. Sherlock shot him a look out of the corner of his eye.
She led him into the teacher’s bedroom and sat him in the chair next to the bed. The bed that still contained the sleeping woman. Irene sat on the bed and crossed one leg over the other and folded her arms, for which Sherlock was grateful.
– having spotted the purple box in John’s hand.
“Night,” he said quietly.
As Venus, Bringer of Peace, began to soothe the scars left by Mars before her, John asked,
Sherlock watched her retreat, expression still unreadable.
Sherlock looked at him, and John tried to appear like he didn’t feel like an idiot.
“Like the down feathers of an angel,” Sherlock said.
He dragged the duvets into the living room. He had no further instruction, so he dumped them rather unceremoniously on the floor. There was the faint sound of a microwave purring coming from the kitchen, and Sherlock followed it.
Sherlock turned around. John looked at him steadily. Sherlock had said something to that effect only once before, and John had looked the term up online afterwards. He’d found that it hadn’t been used by psychiatrists in decades.
“There’s nothing to admit.”
Until, that is, John yawned, and Sherlock stifled an answering yawn in his pillow.
, John thought. “Hello, John. No, thank you.”
“I do apologise, John,” Sherlock said, voice dripping with sarcasm and not without enmity, “for all the inconvenience I cause you.”
“I’m going to get car sick in a minute,” Mrs Watson said.
“He thinks you’re fit!” Mike yelled from the other side of the bathroom. “Piff! Peng! Buff!” John leapt across the room, taking his toothbrush out of his mouth and flicking he bristles, spraying toothpaste and saliva all over Mike’s face. “Super se- ew, John, what the fuck!”
“Focus, focus, you’re going to be fine, John, I’m here, focus,” Sherlock said, quietly and quickly. “Do you want to go for a walk, can I do anything? John?”
A thump on John’s desk - Dr Smith slapping down a pile of papers - and John was brought soldily back to the san.
“You’re going to have to go and extract him,” Sherlock instructed John.
“Same thing,”
John swallowed that memory away.
“Get in the god damn car, Sherlock Holmes,” Viola’s voice came from the library.
“Could it be that you have put your trust in Sherlock Holmes, of all people?” The man mused, ignoring John’s question.
“I didn’t
“And where exactly will he be?”
“Yes, we do.”
Harry then proceeded to explain her plan, and as more and more texts came in, Sherlock had to fight a smile.
the government.”
“Yeah, you do.”
“Gradually, his things started disappearing from the dorm. First it was his school books, then his science equipment. So one night, the very last time I saw him in the dorm, I pretended to be asleep until I heard Sherlock come in. It was very late, and I was thinking that he wasn’t going to come in at all that night when the door opened ever so quietly, and he padded down to his bed.
John hummed. “So did you never hear of him getting in any kind of trouble?”
“Oh, yeah. Well…”
As Sherlock was making his way out of the hall, he heard his name being called. He turned around to see the Head Master and the head of Year Eleven standing expectantly, arms folded across their chests.
. Drum roll please.
“Which is borderline horrible anyway, but this is thin and too sugary and – and disgusting!” Sherlock replied, face twisting in repulsion, throwing the drink into the bin behind him.
“I know. So put it down for tonight and try to sleep. It’s the ceremony in the morning.”
“Most of the guests are in the drawing room and the library,” Sherlock explained, heaving a sigh. John could hear the bubble of voices and laughter coming from the rooms to the left of the staircase, and then some shrieking and the rumbling of a stampede of tiny footsteps before a band of children came running out of one of the doors. They seemed to be playing some form of tag, and chased each other around in the hall. John grinned and turned to Sherlock.
. John picked this up and screwed it back on the bottle. He faced away from Sherlock with the wine in his hand. His shoulders were hard beneath his woollen jumper. After a moment of pause, he opened the door that led into the tiny garden, opened the bottle, poured the liquid onto the damp grass and dumped the empty glass vessel in the bin.
“Oh, no, I have no idea what’s here. I just had a… tipoff, let’s say, from someone who, themselves, thought that something fun might be going on in this grungy old place. I am no more the wiser than you, for once.”
For the most part, John was quiet. Breathing steadily, sipping from his mug every now and then. He shifted, and Sherlock could feel the heat from his feet against his own. Not touching, but close.
As he watched his friend shake the Head Master’s hand and receive his certificate, Sherlock felt his chest warm with something he had never before felt for someone else – pride, overwhelming and undefined.
He opened his eyes and rubbed them. The credits were rolling, the buzz of voices was back, people getting up and stretching, others lounging around still. He’d missed the entire film.
“John, you didn’t
Once he was finished, Mrs Hudson opened her eyes, blinking as if she’d been asleep.
“What, now?” John shouted back, before remembering the time of night and wincing.
After they’d finished their lunch, John led Sherlock back down the escalator and they meandered to the other end of the building.
“I mean, he’s never said it and he never will but he really does.”
John found himself stepping onto the Tube and making his way to the river.
“The pistol is a little OTT, don’t you think?” John said, and Sherlock heard in his voice the fear that was reflected in his eyes. His words were stunted, his rhythm off, like he was repeating something - and the boy shifted and the dim moonlight caught on an earpiece in John’s right ear.
And then John realised.
He took out his earphones. “What?” he yelled back.
Sherlock drew his other leg up to his chest and rested his chin on his knee.
“And with all the stuff on Instagram…” Mike continued. “He seems…”
“He nodded and we went back inside and I told everyone because I was really excited and everyone wished me luck. So I slipped my shoes on without doing the laces and jumped in. He sat next to me, of course, and I strapped myself in and so did he and he smiled and said that I was a natural already and I told him to shut up and tell me what to do because I was really fucking excited.
“I barely have one. We’re roommates.”
“And you are no better.”
“Right. I just wanted to say thanks. For not letting my idiot brother… for looking after him.”
“Just one. My roommate. But he doesn’t know the circumstances.”
Mission accomplished, John fetched the tin of hot chocolate powder from the plastic bag from the supermarket, making a mental note to give it a new home under his socks when he was done – he didn’t trust Sherlock enough yet to leave something that precious just lying around. Then again, hot chocolate might have been a bit sweet for his roommate. He seemed to be more of a
Sherlock said nothing, but that seemed to satisfy Irene. She turned around and walked away down the alleyway. “Bye, sexy,” she called over her shoulder. “Bye, John,”
“There he is,” Lestrade said. “Our very own Doctor Watson, all in his finery.”
“How many more words?”
“No shit. What
Washing detergent and deodorant. John smelt plain. And Sherlock wanted to bury his face in his skin so he could smell nothing else.
The first time Sherlock sneezed in John’s presence, it was a few days later, and it took both of them by surprise.
John lifted out the blazer and, deaf to Sherlock’s protestations, admired the garment. It was black, simple, but the lapels had the same shininess as John’s. John grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders and maneuvered him so he was standing next to John in front of the mirror. “Put it on,” he instructed, holding out the blazer. Sherlock regarded the garment for a moment, before sighing quietly and taking it.
“I never said the last one!” Sherlock interjected.
“John.” She stepped into his space and rested her hands on his face. “Go.” The anger that was flaring in his stomach was doused. She pressed her lips to his, one point of warmth in all that cold, and he would have loved to have stayed, but she was right. He pulled back. Sarah smiled sadly. “He doesn’t have anyone else.”
“Right, sorry,”
Mycroft twitched an eyebrow. “No, Sherlock, unfortunately not. And being what you are now, it’s even more crucial that you – ”
Just beneath them, the network of roads appeared orange in the light of the streetlamps, becoming narrower and narrower until they weren’t visible as they carried cars further and further from John’s home. Rows of houses identical to John’s divided the land into stripes in front of and behind them. Distinct shapes of buildings became insignificant and merged into one mass. Orange and white and yellow and blue and red smudges and dots and squares and winks and pin-pricks of light shone in the dark. Skyscrapers grasped at clouds far away to their left, thimble-sized and hazy. The horizon faded from a smoky orange into a smoky grey into a smoky black into void.
When these swimmers were told to take their marks, they held onto the bars at the front of the blocks of plastic and braced their feet against the wall.
“What were you reading earlier? That old book.”
As the final scene cut to black and the credits began to roll, Sherlock had still not returned. John filed out with the rest of the movie-goers and upon wandering into the foyer, was more than a little surprised to see it crawling with policemen.
“Hi, John,” Lestrade said. “Find Sherlock?”
“What was that?”
When he had returned to room twenty one, Sherlock was still asleep, still curled like a child. His tie was wrapped around a bedpost, but he was still atop the duvet. John sighed.
“See, John’s a centre, which means he tackles, sets up space, and makes runs,” she said, pointing with a mittened hand. “Whereas Mike, the hooker, has a really crucial role in scrums and line-outs. Looking at him, I wouldn’t have expected him to be one, but you never know. Maybe he comes from a rugby family. You have to be quite skilled, you see.”
John huffed and pushed away from Sherlock, and was not in the least surprised to see the dark shape of Irene, standing there as if she had been sculpted, as usual.
When the meeting disbanded, John caught up with Sherlock as he ascended the stairs back to their room.
“Yes, okay,” John said, amused. “What kind of face shall we give it?”
John unlocked his phone – six sixteen in the morning, it told him. The darkness outside had not yet begun to lift, and the night felt endless. He settled back against the fridge and shut his eyes. His vigil was far from over.
“John?”
An elderly woman opened the door.
“What are you doing?”
Sherlock almost snorted. Victor Trevor was a slimy, wholly unpleasant creature, but was in a very strategic position as the head groundskeeper’s son. Therefore, somewhat regrettably, it was in Sherlock’s interests to keep his word and fulfil the transaction. And besides, the more data the better.
“Well, thanks for having me,” John said at last.
The light from his phone passed over a dark headstone and he froze.
But soon, they were turning. Even with their desk chairs blocking the door, there was little room between the furniture and more than once, John backed Sherlock into a piece of it, and the inches of space between them crushed into nothing between their bodies. And then winced, and laughed, and stepped back again, ignoring with all his might how warm Sherlock had been against him.
“Well?”
In fact, he didn’t hear Sherlock coming up fast behind him, so when Sherlock caught up, John was taken entirely by surprise and nearly tripped.
“No prob.” He said. “Never again, though, yeah? See you tomorrow.”
So he watched his friend and hoped.
They walked on a little more, until John spotted a stall selling tacky woollen accessories, Fair Isle patterns assaulting the eye and bobbles on practically everything.
“How many of them were there?” John got started on gently wiping away the blood.
John shook himself mentally. Adorable, maybe. Endearing, certainly. Not cute.
“Sherlock,” John said, squeezing between his sister and her friend. “This is a, uh, surprise.”
Sherlock’s house was a beautiful Tudor construction set back from a quiet birch-lined street. John wanted to admire the ornate knocker but forced himself to knock first.
Mrs Watson left the room, and John turned back to Sherlock.
’ (which included ‘
“It was…” Sherlock began.
John looked up from unpacking to check if Sherlock was pulling his leg. His expression was sincere. “How can you be so clever but so thick at the same time?” John muttered.
“Oh, don’t forget the bit where you start talking about the meaning of life at three in the morning,” added Clara.
“You seem to be able to tolerate him,” ventured John.
“No, not kind of cool,” John said, getting up again and out of sight to Harry’s right. He raised his voice so as to be heard by the computer’s microphone. “Not when you have to live with this kind of thing twenty-four-seven,”
“Yes, well done, John,” Sherlock laughed, and John elbowed him.
“And yet you insisted we do this anyway?”
The musicians in Doyle’s band looked at him with a mixture of surprise, hostility and confusion, and John was suddenly aware of how ridiculous he must have looked, standing there in his pyjamas, but he held eye contact with the Hulk.
“Killing time,” Claus replied.
Who else would it be.
He saw Mycroft shoot Viola a triumphant look –
Sherlock frowned, reaching a hand up to pat his hair. Except his fingers met wool and he turned immediately to John.
John frowned. “Dude, come on,”
John half-laughed as he entered the room. “He was just as awful as you said – patronising, and grumpy as fuck. And you got his lecture right almost word for word… Oh, I’ve got your timetable for you, by the way.”
“Answering the door."
John put his notifications on silent and rang Sherlock, but got his voicemail. “Where are you? There’s - we - look, just call me. Find me. Something.”
The librarian, a middle-aged woman with greying roots, put her head around the end of the bookshelf. “Time to pack up, boys.”
“Whoa, whoa, hang on,” John said. “Don’t be so hasty,” he drew his phone out of his pocket.
“Look at me, John.” John jerkily looked up, eyes flickering around the room, wide, the whites too white, pupils dark and unfocused. “John, look at me.”
“All sorts: You can do catering in the dining hall, behind the counter stuff in the tuck shop, in the library, in the san, at the sports hall, at the swimming pool, with the groundskeepers, help out with the theatre, laundry - though I don’t know why anyone’d want to do that... IT support, lab technicians, at Speedy’s – what’s Speedy’s?” he asked, glancing up and catching Sarah's eye.
So, much earlier than he would have liked, John was dressed and locking the front door behind him.
Sherlock gave him a condescending look that only infuriated John even more. “If you must know, I was recording and analysing the post-mortem effects of common household aerosols on various insects.”
“Go back to sleep, John.” It was Sherlock’s voice, calm and quiet. John opened his eyes to see him standing by the window again, in pyjamas and a dressing gown. He was looking out into the world beyond the window, bathed in argentate moonlight.
And then he remembered: John’s first love, which he really,
Their smiles were wiped away when John opened the door.
“A bit.”
“Of course,” John replied, and he could feel the air between them settle.
Sherlock, for once, couldn’t think of how to word a reply, but before he had to, another message came in.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock interrupted him, because it was – fine, it was fine.
“Harry,” she breathed, a weathered hand on her chest. “You scared the crap out of me.”
“No,” he said incredulously under his breath, the song finally registering.
Content warning for underage drinking. It comprises (pretty much) the entire second half of the chapter, from 'Sherlock had grinned and flicked the kitchen light off' to 'Sherlock said goodnight to John...'. Open this information in another tab
“I’m sorry for what I said earlier. About – you know. When I called them freaks. I know you want him back, I was just trying to get you to... sorry.”
John watched as Sherlock’s gaze dropped to his hands. John had never seen him so vulnerable-looking, that robust chainmail of his falling away despite his best efforts. Something tightened in his chest.
Sherlock glanced back to John, whose left hand was clenching and unclenching at his side.
Sherlock was curled up, his back to the door. John walked quietly into the room and peered at Sherlock’s face. His eyes were shut tight, his untidy curls thrown across the pillow. John smiled.
“Don’t forget how he uses people,” her friend added.
“God, no.”
“One, two, three, four, one, two, three – come
Eddie stood in the doorway, a little out of breath, The Hulk behind him. “Sherlock, for god’s – oh – hi, John.”
“I think I,” John said, but that was all he could manage. His voice cut out. He felt like he was going to be sick. All he could do was look Sherlock in the eye and hope his friend understood.
John walked up the pathway to his front door, a sense of unease growing with each step.
socks?” John joked.
“Okay,” John said to himself, nauseatingly aware of the two storey drop looming below him. The rain beat down on him, dripping into his eyes and making the tree even harder to see as his eyes struggled to adjust to the sudden darkness. He knew that the branch was only about two feet from the window, but it suddenly seemed as if the Grand Canyon lay between the bricks and wood.
me, I’m not a kid.”
From left to right, they made up the sentence –
,” Sherlock said, and John thought he might have been imitating him. “At least to you. It’s looking likely he didn’t feel the same.”
“He fell over,” one of the twins supplied.
“Mm,” Sherlock agreed, also disentangling himself from the bedclothes.
to check it out. Not much is popping over there yet, I’ve just been waiting for you guys to turn up(!), but you never know, I may post things like, oh, I don't know, snippets of upcoming chapters or something… ;)
He was beginning to feel a little embarrassed about his admission (
“Am I forgetting things, you mean? Am I losing my mind?”
There was a miniscule pause that Sherlock felt like an hour, like an hour under a desert sun, before John moved his knight and questioned, “Like that?”
“Stop grinning.”
“We promise,” the others interrupted, almost in unison.
Sherlock went into John’s contacts.
– Sherlock remembered, looking up at the whiteboard momentarily, where the date was scribbled in the top right-hand corner –
“Sherlock Holmes?” a girl with intensely curly hair asked from the other sofa.
The attic had replaced the library for many years, but every so often he returned when he was out of ideas.
Sherlock was watching as his friend jogged slowly up the pitch, following the action, his shoulders tense in concentration.
“Why do you want to know?” came a lilting accent, and John turned to Charlie. He was looking at John with a calm smile that made John want to punch it.
Sherlock stood.
Sherlock got up and went to the window. It was the darkest part of the night, and a light wind was making the tree outside shiver in the cold. He wanted to play his violin, and stood for a few moments considering whether John would care if it woke anyone up. He most likely would, but that was irrelevant.
They were silent for a couple of minutes, before Sherlock seemed to end his text conversation and put his phone away with an air of relief.
John closed his eyes. He wanted to bury himself under the covers like he was hiding from a monster. He wanted to keep all of it out, keep all of that darkness at bay.
“I do maths,” John said. “But I’ve never heard of a Mr Brook.”
Sherlock had found them both coats and more beer, and within three minutes they were sneaking out the back door of Mrs Hudson’s house.
Once all the boys had got into their pyjamas that evening and the sun had fallen under the horizon and all work for the day had been done (more or less), the sixth form migrated down to Lestrade’s kitchen.
Sherlock stood beneath Raz’s window, set into the second floor of Dickens, throwing pebbles at the aforementioned panes of glass in a rhythm just irregular enough to annoy the occupants into waking.
He didn’t hit him. He touched him, every now and again. A hand on his arm, a hand on his back, a hand on his face. Like it was natural, like he wasn’t thinking about it. Again, something Sherlock had only ever observed from afar. He had always wondered how a relationship progressed to the ease that two people could allow each other to touch and be touched without having to ask, without any particular purpose – not sexual, not romantic. Just touched. He had never understood the motivation behind such contact. He still didn’t understand completely, but he was beginning to. It was a non-verbal confirmation of something. Of their relationship, of its status and modus operandi? Simply of each other’s existence?
Sherlock sent a final text to Harry and put away his phone. The boy opposite him was engrossed in his dinner, hair still unruly from the rugby practise.
When he began to shiver, he began to search for a coffee house. On the way, he stumbled upon a small market, and got caught up for a few minutes browsing the various things on sale. There was an antique book stall, and John lifted volumes to his nose to smell the damp, cold, dustiness of them.
“Neurotriptyline,” Sherlock corrected.
Memories. So do they.
“Something like that.”
“You dream of his death?”
His mother and sister were due to arrive in just a few hours. By the end of the day, he would be back in London, in his own bed. It didn’t seem possible. The thought filled him with equal measures of excitement and dread.
John sighed. Sherlock was barely even looking at him, ticking names off on his fingers, ignoring John’s calls of his name. So he put his hands on Sherlock’s, making his friend’s voice trail off into silence and green eyes meet blue.
that would come after him saying he’d just been to the post office. No-one seemed to understand that going to a therapist was just a thing that John did, just like some people had to go to the orthodontists, or others the opticians, or others physiotherapy.
“I had a friend whose daughter went to the school in the next town. Started about the same age as you, I think…” the taxi driver proceeded to tell a rambling story to which John paid no attention. Something about hockey matches and A-Level results. He let his mind wander.
John clambered down from the bed and began his search for Sherlock’s stash.
John and Sherlock were deep in a discussion about the significance of the apparent grave-robbing on their way to the dining hall (John’s idea - neither of them had eaten lunch yet), when John’s phone rang. John had barely finished saying “Hello?” when Angelo’s voice choked out,
“Uh, I’m a bit lost, to be honest.” John whispered back, studying the boy’s features and racking his memory as to where he’d seen him before. He was pretty muscular for his age, with blond hair in a choppy cut and brown eyes, and was about three inches taller than John. “I’ve never actually been in the library before,” he admitted, coming a bit closer so that he didn’t have to whisper so loudly.
“We’ll see,” said John. “Speaking from experience?”
“Banished? It’s not
“He told me what was what and how to do everything and I kept saying, ‘Yeah, I know, dad,’ because I thought I did. And I kind of did – like, I knew what the gear stick was and what most of the dials on the dashboard did, but I was being arrogant because, as I may have mentioned, I was really,
They were standing on the stairs, watching the house slowly empty of people. They had already said goodbye to Louis and Henry, John hugging the youngest boy. Celine gave them both a kiss on the cheek. Henry, under his mother’s watchful gaze, said a very polite thank you. Léa avoided Sherlock’s eyes, and Sherlock hers.
“I know a dead dog when I see one.”
did you sleep, just
“Ah, you have compiled data on the subject of sleepovers, then?”
“Domestic abuse,” Sherlock said by way of greeting.
“And by that you mean…?” his friend interrupted.
“Get a haircut, John!” Sherlock shouted back over his shoulder. John laughed.
“Try and deduce why, Mycroft, it’s not terribly difficult,” Sherlock answered from across the room.
“I’ll fidget less if I faint,” Sherlock said, and John huffed a laugh.
His arm reached up out of the water, bent at the elbow, and John saw the water at his feet broil as he began to kick. And John realised he was the only silent one in the room of three hundred people.
we only came two points behind the winner, so we were a perfectly – ”
“Hmm,” Sherlock hummed, thinking.
As John and the secretary came back into the room, Sherlock returned his gaze to his work. He continued writing the essay he had been given to copy, and heard John continue writing as well.
“Five,” Sherlock murmured.
“It’s a fiddle, John. A sodding fiddle. Not a violin. I can’t work with that kind of ignorance.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock on any other day would have rolled his eyes, and John wished he did, but he just took the offered socks and began to put them on.
“No, no, it wasn’t an inconvenience at all. We’re walking to the train station now, he should be home in about an hour, I’m guessing.”
“Ah, he speaks!” John said teasingly. Sherlock rolled his eyes, making his friend chuckle. “For such a fidget, I’m surprised you’ve been able to keep still this long.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Don’t I?”
“Hanging under the goal post. By their necks. They were burning.”
John gave a despairing look to Jeannette, and a memory hit him, the same expression on his father’s face when he fell over at some important ceremony and started crying, and his father making that face at a diplomat,
“It’s hot chocolate,” John said, bemused.
“You’re good for him, you know that?”
Sherlock looked over his shoulder. John was walking towards him, looking concerned. Always so concerned, that boy. It was annoying.
John had straightened, fingers flying over his phone, a smile growing on his face.
“I am knackered,” John yawned as the police car drove away and they began to walk up to the front door of Doyle.
Her brother was sitting at a desk wearing his school uniform – a navy blue jumper with a light blue shirt underneath, collar undone and tie loose. It was the end of the school day for him, Harry guessed, whereas she had come home an hour ago. Behind him appeared to be another desk underneath a raised bed, both of which were covered in papers and what looked to be scientific equipment, and even –
“I would make up the rest?” Sherlock assumed, handing John the note in spite of his tone.
when someone asks you how you are, you say
John went through a doorway into where Mike must have found the mattress and the violin. It was bare now. There was a window to his left. It was open. John climbed through.
Sherlock looked back at him, and there was something about the rigidity of his features that was far from the normal impassivity he usually adopted.
Sherlock snorted. “I’m not going to die, John.”
Sherlock shrugged. “I meant the other one.”
Then John began talking about his late-night conversations with the boy, and Sherlock felt a strange twinge of something in his chest, something like jealousy for something that could never have been, and hatred for someone he didn’t know.
“I just found Sherlock in the bathroom, he’s unconscious, I don’t – ”
A slow smile spread over Sherlock’s face. “I was hoping you’d ask.”
He thought for a few moments, as the house came to life around him, about whether or not it would be necessary to tell Lestrade about the both of them bunking off, and came to the conclusion that angry emails from teachers about truant students would not make the house master particularly amenable to John’s watery excuses, so it would be wisest to pre-empt. He made his way downstairs.
John didn’t know what to say, but didn’t have to, as the sound of a motor outside could be heard, getting louder.
“It’s a matter of principle, John.”
“The things
John smiled. Sherlock was the one topic he could go on about for hours. He could share a little bit of Sherlock with this man, here in his home. So he began unsure of where he’d end.
“Mum, let him go,” she said, putting a hand on her mother’s arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Take your marks!”
“Thanks,” John replied, his voice still a little weak from breathlessness and a little hoarse from shouting.
John didn’t remember dropping off, but he woke the next morning with his phone underneath him digging uncomfortably into his back. He was a little disconcerted for a moment, not quite remembering when he’d made the decision to go to sleep. He pulled his phone out and saw that he had six unread texts. He opened his and Sherlock’s conversation from the night before.
“Oh, right.” A pause. "Why are you telling me all this?"
he thought to himself.
Sherlock nodded and turned his back on them both so he could see inside.
“Did you even hear what I said?”
He put his hood up and walked a little faster.
“That’s better!” John said. “Louder, louder!”
“I will not! Sherlock, you need to help me, I can’t do it by myself!”
“You know when you sent Nadia to check her brother’s emails, what did you think she was going to find?”
“He basically made me.”
and some lovely art that sort of fits with this chapter at
“Seatbelt, Holmes,” the teacher repeated, and Sherlock obeyed as the coach lurched and pulled away from the curb.
John paused the film he had been watching, took out his earphones and closed his laptop. Reluctantly, he fetched his sketchpad and pencils from his rucksack and settled back onto his bed.
“The mother is homophobic, hit the girl when she walked in on her and the girlfriend,” Sherlock elaborated sparingly, aware of Sarah behind John. “Let’s go.”
“Uh,” John began, “she left about ten this morning,”
Eddie stood up and made a very pointed speech about the looming house singing competition – recognising that not everyone was going to be happy with the decisions made, but emphasising that it was going to be a team effort and sometimes that would mean sacrificing one’s personal beliefs for the good of the house – before handing out lyric sheets.
“What are you planning on doing today, John?” his mother asked him over breakfast.
The door opened and Mike stuck his head through. “Come on, then,” he said.
Five mugs of the stuff later, the lower sixth meandered upstairs, trying with all their might not to spill anything on the carpet. John felt like he was eight again, sleeping over at his mate’s house, trying to laugh silently so as not to wake the grown-ups and struggling to make it to midnight.
“Harry,” John cautioned, kicking her under the table.
“That has to be rectified this instant,” Sherlock said, lifting a hand to point towards the heavens. “Orion. The easiest one to spot, typically.”
It was a little while later, when John had got into bed and was reading a book, when Sherlock continued. “My mother passed away when I was twelve. She had thyroid cancer. It was much unexpected.”
“Will you do another one?”
“Ew, gross,” she giggled, and John caught the strong scent of alcohol.
Asleep, Sherlock looked young. The features that were usually set in an indifferent mask were lax, open, peaceful. All the things one would never associate with him. The great mind that solved unsolvable problems and saw invisible things and drove John up the wall – resting. Dreaming. John wondered what Sherlock dreamed of. An unhappy childhood? His mother? Cases?
“I can’t put it down, John. I’ve never known how to put things down.”
, and pointed round a corner.
Sherlock was deducing the man who he suspected to be a spy, a short, unassuming, vitamin D deficient hermit of a man. There was nothing very interesting about him, which was why Sherlock suspected him of espionage, but he kept deducing because something about what he was saying was making John laugh. And laugh. And laugh. His eyes were watering, and he was trying to hide it because the spy kept looking in their direction, and in doing so he was trying to turn himself away from the man, but ended up just turning closer to Sherlock, and Sherlock could see each crinkle in his skin when he cracked into giggles, and his smile rivalled the sun.
“Yeah, I know.”
Sherlock didn’t reply to that for a moment, and John was worried the conversation had turned too serious, so he began typing out another text when another message came in from Sherlock.
God, he hated himself. It was almost unbearable.
, never that, although each knew the other did. But
“What’re you thinking about?” John’s voice was like candlelight. “You’re frowning.”
“Sir, if you’ll excuse my intrusion,” came a deep voice from John’s right. He turned to see Sherlock standing next to him as if he’d always been there, his marble face serious but patient. “Our attention was called to three dead pets and now there are people who believe that Angelo De Luca is the murderer.”
John fought a losing battle against a grin. He nodded.
“Why not? Everything’s been so boring for so long. This is getting fun.”
John described the book Sherlock had sent him for. The boy raised his eyebrows at the mention that the book in question was on the topic of the representation of male genitalia in sculpture throughout history.
Sherlock’s eyes flitted around for a moment before alighting on John’s. “Bradstreet’s pets.”
“Yes,” Nadia replied. “Emails?”
The small face, all but hidden under a dark fringe, looked up at John. “Hello?”
- but didn't send it. He erased it and tried,
Which he did. They went downstairs and John got to work putting stickers on the living room windows, skulls and ghouls and broomsticks that would be visible from the road. He hung two cardboard skeletons with adjustable limbs either side of the front door and Blu-tacked some tape that was printed with the words ‘
His roommate was lounging on the branch of the senile oak tree that wandered across their window, looking as if he was more relaxed there, two stories above a concrete road, than in his own bed. He gestured for John to open the window.
Comfortably exhausted after his second day of lessons, John was ambling back to house with Mike, since they had had maths together, when he remembered the jangling change in his trouser pocket.
“God, no,” Sherlock took it and put the strap over his wrist. “They remind me of my brother.”
Sherlock hummed, looking uncomfortable, and John wondered whether he should have brought up that time after such a positive day. However, they were saved from having to say anything more by a shout from below.
John took a sip of his beer, and only then did he realise that there was a distinct lack of grumpy sarcasm in the room.
Harry turned to her mother in confusion. “You do?”
His eye was caught by a security camera nestled in the corner of the ceiling, and his heart jolted. Even though he knew it was off – there was no red light blinking at him and Sherlock seemed relaxed enough – he was finding it hard to look away from the camera, as if, if he did, it would suddenly leap back to life and it would all be over.
John spun around to locate the voice.
John turned over. He heard Harry sigh.
“Sherlock, love! How are you?”
thingy!” John interrupted, and then began to sing, throwing his arms wide. “
Sherlock sighed. “Fine. Let me go and get my violin.”
He wanted to ask why. Was it mechanical? Psychological? How had he learnt to speak? What changed?
“Are you sure?” Sherlock pushed, eyes still on the screen.
He walked slowly through each room, mouth agape, surveying the damage. The kitchen was the worst, glasses everywhere, stacks of unwashed plates in the sink.
A dark hand reached into his field of vision. He tensed.
“Try it on,” urged Harry.
When he was little, the kitchen always smelled of warmth to John. Now it was cold.
“Goodbye, John,” Sherlock said. “Thank you.”
He was upon them in a rush, arms around both of them, and Harry inhaled. He smelt a bit different, like someone else’s laundry, but his skin smelt exactly the same. They were all saying things to each other, but later Harry wouldn’t be able to remember what.
“Him!” Sherlock pointed at The Hulk, who slapped his hand away and growled,
“Nope. I’m fine.”
“Not irrelevant. I have a hunch he was taken in the same way Muhammad was. But…”
, Sherlock thought, and considered joining in, but realised that his presence would alter the trusting atmosphere the boys inside had managed to build up. So he slid to the floor and pressed an ear against the thin wood of room nineteen.
’ had rolled off his friend’s tongue just a couple of hours previously. “Speaking of Nadia, would you like to talk to her?”
“Yeah, I could use something sugary.”
“No, but I don’t like this song,” Sherlock replied, and John laughed.
John grinned, but made sure Sherlock couldn’t hear it in his voice. “You are a truly awful person, Sherlock Holmes.”
There was something Sherlock wanted to say to John, wanted to clarify. It was pressing at the base of his skull but its blade was blunt and he couldn’t remember its form.
“Don’t lie to me, John. The letter says you missed November and January – that means you were supposed to go every month!”
about those things either,” John interrupted. “Why don’t
“But he’s not!”
And Sherlock realised that, once again, John couldn’t have cared less. He breathed.
Sherlock didn’t really have a reply to that. John let him go and the two boys made their way back to Doyle together.
“You sound like a careers advisor, John,” Sherlock commented, looking back over the rugby field. “And that’s not a good thing.”
Then it struck him; it was the first time John had seen his roommate asleep. At school, Sherlock invariably went to bed later and woke up earlier than John, and John hadn’t noticed that he had fallen asleep until the film had ended last night, at which point he’d woken him up.
John sat opposite Sherlock and opened up the garish green box. It was full to the brim with medical bounty; antiseptic, bandages, plasters, antihistamines, butterfly stitches… John got to work.
After a moment, Sherlock dimly wondered whether he should do something with his arms, which were still behind him, propping him up, but before he could work out what exactly, John pulled away.
“Oh, don’t worry, I’ve got something else in mind as well,” John dismissed.
“Oh,” John said, “hi. Thought you’d be with Janine.”
“Nope,” John laughed. “I guess that’s something they just don’t teach us city kids.”
John looked over and caught Sherlock’s eye, and it was only then that Sherlock thought to close his mouth.
[in which Eddie van Coon has a favour asked of him]
“Hello, John.” He said, the suddenness of his greeting making John jump. John couldn’t help laughing.
The Hulk erupted into a badly covered up fit of giggles.
Sherlock began busying himself on the right side of the room, moving the detritus that obviously belonged to him off John’s new bed and desk. He cleared his throat. "I regret that you saw all of this. You will come to realise very promptly that I am by no means what one might call a tidy person.”
“What’s up?” he prompted.
He took a breath and turned, heading for the door. Just as he stepped over the threshold into the corridor, however, a low buzz erupted from inside his room – the sound of his phone vibrating on his desk where he’d left it.
“Why aren’t they eating anything? The PDS kids?” John asked Mike quietly.
“Thank you, though,” he said after a moment.
“Yes, it’s a very lovely view, now let’s leave John to say goodbye to Sherlock,” Harry was saying, bundling their mother back towards the attic. John looked at Harry now to thank her with his eyes, and she looked back as if she wanted to die.
“Turn it down, John, Mycroft’s got hearing like a  - a bat!”
The bowl of popcorn lay on the floor – a food that would never be allowed in his house. Sherlock reached down and took a handful. It was salty and dry, and he ate the handful very quickly, chased down by a large gulp of hot chocolate. Not something he would want in his house, he concluded.
John closed his eyes. He could feel himself shaking. “No,” he was saying. “I don’t believe you. Stop it. Stop it, now. Come down.”
“Done?” Sherlock asked.
“This is the south wing,” he said, walking down the corridor which contained Sherlock’s bedroom. John took the chance to look around a little more. There was a long rug running the length of the corridor, rich in colour and pattern. The floorboards creaked underfoot like those at school. “My bedroom, spare bedroom, another spare bedroom, airing cupboard,” Sherlock listed, pointing at the relevant doors.
He was met with the sight of his roommate carefully holding the forceps and wearing an expression of mild astonishment. There was a long moment in which John nearly asked –
Sherlock watched him, saw the same concentration on his face, the same undivided focus as when he was studying, or healing, or untangling Sherlock’s headphones because Sherlock himself failed to see what the problem was.
“Sorry,” he muttered, and continued walking.
“If you’re quite finished…?”
“What does he do when you wake up? You said a few months ago that you are often screaming, or shouting…”
He sighed. “As nice as that title sounds, you might need proper stitches, I can’t do those. And you need to be looked over by a professional. Why don’t you want to go to the san?”
Mrs Hudson was waiting downstairs to drive John to the train station. Sherlock slipped on his great coat and slipped into the backseat.
“Why don’t they like you?”
, thought Eddie. “No matter what he does, do not let him back out of this. He will try, believe me, and prepare to have all your secrets spat in your face, but do not back down.”
“Yes,” Anderson said, sounding exasperated.
Sherlock followed his gaze to the other end of the pitch, where a Doyle boy – Sherlock couldn’t tell who from that distance, and he didn’t really care, either – was sprinting for what Sherlock had learnt was called the try line, ball gripped in his hands. Defenders adorned in deep green were throwing themselves at him, but it looked like the boy was simply a bar of soap in their hands, slipping between them effortlessly.
“Don’t exaggerate, Sherlock.” Mycroft scolded wearily. “Anyway. Go. Enjoy the party, both of you.”
“Yeah, we’re fine,” John replied. “By the way, do you happen to know if there’s been a stomach bug going around or anything?”
“But why would anyone want to…?” he asked quietly, and all traces of teacher-like sternness had been replaced by grief. John remembered what Anderson had said about Bradstreet loving his pets more than his kids and suddenly felt a wave of sympathy for the man.
“Sounds good. Who’s that talking to him?”
For some reason,
“John-!”
“I couldn’t care less about space,” Sherlock said. “But Holst has his reputation for a reason.”
John frowned at the sudden change of topic. “Your - ?”
The wind changed direction and brought a few fleeting notes on a violin through the falling darkness, and then it was gone. John stood as still as he could, willing it to come again, and what felt like an eternity later, it did, and he felt a smile tugging at his mouth – it was the opening bars of
“Hi Mrs Watson, hi Harry,” Mike said, waving. Now he was closer, Harry could see he had a friendly, open face and a pair of glasses with tortoiseshell rims that didn’t seem to fit with his stocky build. “What are you up to, John?”
Sherlock scowled. “Why didn’t you start it earlier?”
“Sherlock, I need to apologise again. For yesterday, for what I said about uni.”
Sherlock left the room to shower and returned smelling of his body wash, dressed only in a towel tied about his hips. Even though John didn’t take his eyes off his computer, Sherlock still felt proud of himself. It was the first time he’d walked all the way back from the bathroom topless.
“It’s your problem now, mate.” One of them – Dean, by his voice – shoved the few remaining bags at Sherlock, taking the one in Fitz’s hand and throwing that at him as well, before dragging his accomplice out of the cubicle, both of them pushing past Sherlock and running out of the bathroom, leaving the door to bang shut behind them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And every time I can do nothing to stop it.”
“No, he’s still got a file,” Smith said, “so run along and pop the papers in it.”
“Let’s do it,” John said. “Read me a recipe.”
Sherlock got changed, struggling a little with his trousers, finding his balance to not quite be what he had hoped, and falling over whilst trying to get them off. Luckily, he’d managed to get up and change into his pyjama bottoms before John had returned. However, he had just taken his shirt off as the door opened, and he froze.
drunk, Sherlock?”
“You don’t fucking sound it!”
“They already do,” Sarah said with a laugh, pulling out her phone. “Okay. Ready?”
“Go to bed, John,” his mother sighed. “And tell Sherlock to go to bed too.”
Sherlock didn’t answer except for turning the fine adjustment knob of the microscope ever so slightly. “Possibly,”
“Oh, you’re right, I’m sorry; it’s your ego in general that is sun-sized.”
“That’s enough,” Dr Hope said, and the class quietened. John could almost feel Sherlock bursting with some sort of retort and desperately wanted to give him a warning look, but he thought ignoring the boy would be a better idea at that particular moment. “Go and sit down – and get yourself a dissecting tray. It’s hearts today, but we’re short, so you’re going to have to share one.”
“All good things,” Mike replied, and John could have sworn his eyes flitted back to the doorway where Sherlock was silhouetted against the light coming from inside.
[in which there are pointy Italian shoes]
“Thank you, baby,” said John’s mum as he handed her the tea. She wrapped her hands around it. John tried not to think about how easily he could see the thin bones in her fingers.
“Thank you for my Christmas present,” Sherlock said.
“All right, mate – oh, by the way, Mary’s having a Halloween party at hers, you should come.”
“You always make things so difficult for yourself,” he mumbled. “It’s so frustrating.”
“Two hundred.”
“Wow,” Mrs Watson was saying, “what a view!”
John had been asking Sherlock horse-related questions the entire way, not being able to hide his awe of the creatures.
“Sherlock, are you doing rugby this term?” Mike said, changing the subject.
Sherlock stared at the battered object, at the thumb that ran over the chip in the casing next to the headphone jack. At the nail.
“Oh, no, I knew
She turned back to him, gaze hard and scrutinising. John kept smiling in what he hoped was a non-threatening way.
“What time do you call this, Watson?” came a voice from the reception desk, and John smiled, turning to Jamie Lancaster.
“I thought you two seemed more than acquaintances,” John said, hoping to pull at least a smile from his friend to ease the tension. Sherlock gave him a quick quirk of his mouth and a small snort, but that was enough.
John huffed and began to drag Sherlock towards the door.
“Okay, all right, all right.”
“What about them?”
“You want me to try?” John went to put Sherlock in a fireman’s lift, but at the last moment, Sherlock realised John wasn’t joking and conceded.
“Oh, I don’t know about that, sir,” Sherlock shouted back. “I might be a bad influence on him.”
“Please pick up, please,” John murmured.
“No, sir. That would be boring.”
“That was…” John began between heavy breaths and half-laughs. “The craziest thing… I’ve ever done,” he beamed, and Sherlock chuckled softly, almost cross at his own laughter that he recognised as a primitive social mechanism and yet could not, unfortunately, control.
“Yeah. I had just found out I had got into Bart’s, actually. I remember telling him.” John sighed. “Anyway, he invited me to this house his family had in the Essex countryside for a weekend. It was gorgeous, this tiny cottage and no other people for miles. Both his parents came and we had a lovely time. Barbeques, late mornings, walks in the fields.”
“You try!”
“Oh,” John said. “It sounded like you were implying about someone specific.”
Dave nodded and wandered back out.
Sherlock had never had to filter himself before – he realised, now, that he probably should have done a couple of times – and he wasn’t going to make a habit of it. But he thought that, just for the time being, it might be wiser to keep himself as amicable as possible – not too much, else John would suspect something, but maybe go to bed earlier, go to more meals, that sort of thing. Just make sure the concrete over their cracks had dried before he put his weight on them again.
“Yeah, Sherlock, what
“Do you have to sing, John?”
“Nothing,” said the Watson siblings.
“Of course. And you still want to be a doctor?”
John fetched a pair from the bottom of the wardrobe. “We don’t generally put the heating on up here, unless it’s really cold,” he explained, chucking Sherlock the socks and going back to the foot pump.
“In the best way, Sherlock,” John beamed.
John cut Claus off. “You believe all the shit they’re saying, then? On Instagram?” His words had come out a little harsher than he had been intending, but he couldn’t bring himself to feel bad about the way the boys around him suddenly avoided his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
“All I meant was, your other hobbies don’t always lend themselves to rhythmic sensitivity.”
They were searching Sherlock’s for a further explanation, but Sherlock made certain he would not find one.
As they loaded their plates, John couldn’t help but think of mornings at school. The familiarity of not being quite awake enough to talk, of their pyjamas, of their bed hair.
“It’s not ruined, John. That was an unnecessary hyperbole.” He tossed the pad back to John and sauntered over to the fridge. John gritted his teeth at the treatment of his sketchpad, but said nothing.
Sherlock read over the last sentence precisely fourteen times. He hoped John wasn’t looking at him, because he was sure his surprise was written all over his face, even if he didn’t have to worry about blushing.
John supposed he had been about right.
Sherlock walked up to it, silently, as if he didn’t want it to know he was coming. He knelt down.
