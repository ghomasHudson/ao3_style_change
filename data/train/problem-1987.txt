Mary suggested it; saying that Sherlock was going to need something to entertain him and that John needed to, ‘
“And you knew? For two years?”

"Sorry, unfortunately, only family members can visit him right now. You might have to wait a bit."
“Last night? Why are you still here?”
----------------------
"So, when did this happen?”
“She’s dying!” John hisses between his teeth, “you
"We need to share the blankets."
The kiss ended as soon as it began as Sherlock immediately pulled away, "S-sorry, oh god-"
John groaned and set upon his journey across London to Tesco.
“Wait, you know Mycroft?”
"No, he called about a possible case. Said you'd probably be interested."
In fact, to celebrate, she had texted everyone she knew that John and Sherlock were finally a couple. With a picture of them snogging on the floor no less.
John looked at Sherlock quizzically, "Why are you sorry?"
The voice was low, most likely a man, and it had been utterly relaxed. Despite that, it had been so sudden that John jumped and he fumbled with the glasses, catching them before they hit the floor.
my… name. You haven’t forgotten, have you?”
A feminine voice rang out behind them, sliding into their conversation, "I think this man is allowed to see John Watson." Their heads snapped around to see Anthea, standing there, perfectly calm.
"Where is the footage?"
"John?" he croaked. Where was John? Wasn't he with John just a few seconds ago?
(See the end of the chapter for
“Nice touch, this, the pool where little Carl died. I stopped him,” John's heart rate shoots through the roof, “I can stop John Watson, too.” He looks down as the next words are spoken, “Stop his heart.”

“But he didn’t attach it to anything. It was...it was comforting, to feel it in my mouth...it meant I didn’t have to say anything...but I
Fawnlock continued sitting at the edge of the glade long after Moosecroft took his leave, staring at the tent, telling himself he didn’t care.
Fawnlock just stared at Greg. He sighed. Well, the book cost only a few pounds. The kid was so eager, it seemed worth the risk. He threw some money on the table, adding a large tip since they’d taken up a table for an hour for a single cup of tea, and stood up. Fawnlock clumsily scraped his chair back loudly and stood up with him.
“Not stop!”
noted Sherlock.
Sherlock moved quickly around the bed, setting the glass back on the table, running his fingers gently through John’s wet hair.
Sherlock had been truly frightened that the video feed would be the last straw for John. While he had known he was going to have to get Mycroft involved if he wanted to follow John back to London, he had had no idea things would become so snarled and so dangerous so quickly. Mycroft’s ill-timed, presumptive call to John, that morning outside the hotel, when he revealed to John his usual patronizing list of suffocating solutions, had been worrying enough. But knowing John’s psychological issues, especially concerning his sexuality, and having honestly forgotten that Mycroft would be spying on them (the sick pervert)—he thought at that point he had lost John, that John would throw up his hands and have done with the both of the strange, and in Mycroft’s case, eerie, brothers.
“I think I’d rather talk about our
Immediately, John leaned down and took Sherlock fully into his mouth. He gagged slightly before he remembered how to manage—Sherlock was definitely as long in cock as in body. He sucked slowly and sumptuously as he pulled almost all the way off, holding the base steady in one hand, and slid back down equally slowly, tasting the sorbet this time and bothering to swallow. Melted watermelon juice dribbled all down his chin, onto his chest, and covered Sherlock’s balls. They would have to shower after this.
“I can’t—reach—the drawer—”
“None of that, now. You had a rough day yesterday; this is to be expected.”
Johnny looked back at the deer boy and smiled, and the deer boy glanced at him briefly with an answering smile.
. You would feel the illusion of being bound and held, safe,
“Never said you were.”
John’s smile, an appreciation of the personal revelation, was more than worth the vulnerability.
“That is some of the most amazing hair I’ve ever seen.”
“That won’t be necessary.”
Sherlock opened his eyes a tiny bit.
“Gah!”
His father looked down at his plate.
Sherlock pulled back at that and looked at John, startled. There was no artifice in John’s expression; no challenge, no attempt at provocation. He looked as calm as if he was telling Sherlock what he planned to have for dinner.
“Ah, is that what you were doing. Same thing with the steak?”
He’d never had one with PTSD.
“Molly!” John objected.
“See those lights, coming around the curve, about a mile back?”
“Okay. I trust you.”
Sherlock clambered up over John and fell half on him, trying to reach for the drawer with the lube.
When they stepped back out on the sidewalk, dusk had fallen. Sherlock linked John’s hand in his elbow and turned to the right. As they strolled, John’s head swivelled as he watched men in shorts and sleeveless vests parade by, with the occasional mullet-headed or crew-cut woman interspersed.
“I think that would be best, yes.”
“The scene would use a combination of simulated bondage and sensation play. I would put cuffs on your wrists and ankles but I would
“Sherlock, what just happened? That was horrible! Why are you being so casual?”
Sherlock watched him intently. John returned his stare when the windows were covered.
“You’ll see, John. Just wait.” Sherlock was practically vibrating with anticipation; he bounced a little on his toes, waiting for John to climb out of the cab. This was his favorite place in San Francisco, and he could not wait to share it with John. He had been thrilled when he had stumbled upon it himself and had spent many happy hours inside, revisiting his favorite niches or just revelling in the quiet and thinking.
“All done!” John said brightly, putting a plaster over the two neat stitches and wrapping the whole foot in a bandage. “Get your other shoe on now.”
“There. Was that so fucking hard to tell me? Jesus fuck, Sherlock. I am a soldier. I cannot protect you--and me--if I do
“Did that really bother you, John?”
“Cor, would you look at that. What is that, some kind of costume?”
“—and our own jobs; fly there on a regular plane?”
Sherlock slithered up off the couch, drawing John up with him into a standing embrace. “I think you’d better get undressed then, hadn’t you.”
John slid the driver’s seat forward without a word.
Molly handed over the water.
"There was some."
“Because we have no choice in the matter.”
“May I have this dance?”
John spun around on his barstool to find a young man standing near him, holding out a hand. Molly giggled. The lad was quite handsome: slim, with dark eyes and full lips. Black hair curled rakishly over his forehead and he was sporting a very “come hither” grin. A sleeveless black leather t-shirt, black jeans, and a kicky blue scarf completed the look.
John sat up and stretched, checking to see if he felt different now that he had had two orgasms in two hours after months of nothing. He supposed he felt more relaxed: a little tired, maybe.
Sherlock watched him, listening.
John couldn’t hold back a smile at Molly’s clumsy, well-meaning patter.
“John!”
“I like how optimistic you are,” John conceded. “I just think you should adjust your expectations.”
a hurry, aren’t you.”
; maybe it was a drawing of a girl human?
“It is quite settled, John.” Sherlock crossed the room and crowded up against John. “Quite settled.”
Sherlock’s hand was warm on his chest. His other hand was smoothing John’s hair back from his forehead.
“...”
“Tom, take the bags to suite 221-A.” The tall “companion” handed a keycard to the bellhop, who began rolling John’s small suitcase and garment bag towards the elevators.
“John. That was careless of me. I apologize.”
Since his 14th birthday, Johnny had slept in his tent more and more often; now he slept out almost every night unless there was a really terrible storm. His tent had become well-equipped, with a roll of toilet paper, a little box he used for trash, various snacks, and a canteen that he filled each night at dinner from the tap. He kept a few porn magazines hidden in a small stack of comics that he didn’t care about (wouldn’t do to get the good ones damp), but mainly he relied on his imagination for wank material. He also kept a heavy-duty camping flashlight in the tent.
“Okay?” Sherlock asked, turning to look at John while stroking his foot soothingly. John gazed down towards his foot. He couldn’t see the cuff—Sherlock was deliciously blocking his view—but the feeling was quite strange. He had just gotten used to the heaviness surrounding his wrists; the restriction around his ankle seemed to tip the balance for his brain into some kind of warning.
When his teeth began to chatter--my goodness, that happened in real life, he’d thought it was just something in books--he heard the deer boy move closer, and then he felt the boy’s hands all over his face. He tried to protest with a “Hey” but the shivering and chattering led to something a lot closer to “Brrrr.” The hands dropped from his face, and a few moments later he was abruptly pulled back across the dirt on his shorts-covered bum until his back was flat against a wiggly warmth. Arms wrapped around his stomach, and the deer boy made some noises that frankly sounded a little patronizing. Johnny’s shivering subsided from a constant quiver to little pulses of shudders as he warmed up, so he didn’t argue against the unusual position.
There was a pause where he saw neither Person and worried that perhaps he had actually lost the communication, when finally Halifa spoke up and appeared in the Pool.
When Johnny began staying in a tent on his own, Fawnlock was pleased to find that the youth talked more to himself than he had to his father. Listening to Johnny murmur to himself, night after night, Fawnlock learned various new words like “piss” (“Oh fuck, drank too much water after dinner, gotta take a piss. Goddamn it”) and “shit” (which evidently meant “Ow, I stood up much too fast and hit my head on the pole of my tent”), and he learned the moods that Johnny’s tones of voice indicated. He also became acquainted with deep moans that intrigued and disturbed him in equal measure.
, which may have been a bit different back when Johnny was training (this is from 2014, he was training in 1991). In 2014, at least, anyone who joined up under the age of 17 went to Harrogate regardless of what their ultimate occupation would be in the Army.
“California’s redwoods, John. Some of these trees are over a thousand years old and over 300 feet tall. These trees were mature when the Magna Carta was signed. They will be here long after we are gone.”
“This is such a sexist song, don’t you think?”
As he rubbed over the large scar on John’s shoulder, stimulating the odd combination of numb patches and overactive nerves that sent confusing, not-quite-pain signals, John realized this was the first person to touch the scar who was not a medical professional. In fact, Sherlock had seen him with his shirt off several times now, and John hadn’t thought twice about exposing his scar. He’d been self-conscious about it up until now, refusing to show Harry when she indelicately demanded to see it, and wearing a shirt when he went to the pool for therapeutic exercise. Why didn’t he mind if Sherlock saw it? He guessed it was because Sherlock was a stranger, someone he didn’t care about; he had nothing to lose if this man found the scar hideous, as he’d never see this guy again after this week. He shrugged a little to himself, and Sherlock immediately ceased the movement of his hands, though he didn’t lift them from John’s skin.
John could not figure out how Sherlock thought he would get them out of the rooms unseen. Their doors opened onto a hallway with elevators at one end and a stairway at each end. There were five agents in the hall; there was no way to leave the floor without being instantly spotted.
This file was created using Audacity and Steve Daulton's Noise Gate.
“Would you like me to hold you?”
More screams, but John couldn’t look back to see if another civilian was hit. Sirens were getting close now, and the shots stopped. John’s chest was covering Sherlock’s head, his pelvis covering Sherlock’s back; bone structures positioned to protect Sherlock’s brain and heart. He could feel that his own heartbeat was slow and steady, as it always was in a firefight. Time felt molasses-slow. He could taste the concrete dust and the copper of adrenaline. He smelled the stale urine underneath the planters and Sherlock’s sour sweat. His breathing was deep and even; Sherlock was panting a little, far less than he would expect from someone new to this. He could hear police officers pouring out of their sedans, an ambulance arriving, official helpers asking questions, panicked people yelling answers unnecessarily loudly in their fear. It had been three minutes since the last shot. Sherlock was not asking questions nor demanding that John get off of him.
He’d never had one as tormented by inner demons.
“Get out of the car,” John said in a very commanding voice. Sherlock raised his eyebrows and got out. John came around and hustled him, not very gently, to the passenger side of the car. The grass was damp with dew under their shoes.
“Now you help me. Ready? A, B, C, D…” He had to start it several times, gesturing at Fawnlock encouragingly, before Fawnlock figured it out and began singing with him. The first time through, he was a half-beat behind on each letter.
“Yeah, hey, who are you and what are you doing?” Johnny forgot for a moment about the horrible storm and being lost as he stared at the being in front of him. Its antlers weren’t nearly as huge as they had seemed when he saw them in that first flash of lightning. It wasn’t even as tall as Johnny, though it was certainly stronger; he was going to have bruises from that grip. It had dark curls of hair all around its antler bases, and it seemed to have very short fur on a lot of its body, and the fur had unusual brown markings the likes of which Johnny had never seen.
John swallowed thickly, "Sher, Sherlock, what- hmph!"
He hears the doors of the chamber open, but he stays in his spot and doesn’t turn around.
And John laughs from the whiplash; the words are so different than the words he wished Sherlock would say. The words he knows Sherlock would never say- could never say, even if he meant it.
Sherlock turned to John and said in a matter-of-fact tone, "It's going to get colder in here John. By sharing a blanket, we'll be sharing body heat. Therefore making us all warmer."
The two of them left the dock at dusk to a little cafe on the sea-side. Chatting and giggling as Sherlock deduced the people around the two of them. And in one case; the couple that was sitting four tables away from them.
“Oh.” John furrowed his eyebrows, “your friend then?”
"What does he want? Tips on a new diet?"
They swam back to shore and lied, together, back on the sand. John's head resting under Sherlock's open arm. The sun seemed to set a lot quicker than it had the day before.
Sherlock cut him off with another kiss, ”Do you know what today is?“
John chuckled, and Sherlock cocked his head at him, “What? There are at least five inches of snow on the ground. There has got to be a reason you came. Did your car break down? Do you need help? Did something happen-”
“Is that what?” The other man pauses.
John didn’t reply.
, hasn't there?”
John chuckles and Rosie giggles, “Oh, that was awful.”
Knowing Irene's habits, it wasn't a surprise to Sherlock when that next day, Mary had come up and congratulated the two of them,
“I doubt Mycroft would be willing to if there are any pictures, to begin with. It was an undercover,
“Oooh, ooh, can I do it, Daddy?”
Before Sherlock could look back up at John, his phone was yanked out of his hand and he was being pressed against the arm of the couch, John's lips pressed hard against his. It was a sloppy kiss, their noses collided and their teeth clashed together, but it took Sherlock's breath away nonetheless.
Sherlock rolls his eyes and John pushes Sherlock playfully, “Hey! I can gloat!”
Sherlock shook his head, “The Tube will close in five minutes, and no cabbie would take you anywhere in this weather. You’re going to have to stay over.”
“My what?” Cold blue eyes met his, a John felt a prickle at the back of his neck, and a bit more confusion.
He looks back at Mrs. Hudson and nods, “Yeah,” his voice is raspy, “yeah.”
“Then I’ll give him a Christmas cracker!”
"The glassware has already been stocked behind the bar, and the ice has been transported to the ice wells so you don't have to worry about that..." Mary trailed off for a second and cleared her throat, "anything else?"
John smiled one last time at William and tried to embed his face into his memory. He slipped the scarf over his mouth again, “Goodbye, William. If all goes well, I’ll see you next year.”
, where Lestrade was standing there and waiting, "Why are you here?"
But as he felt the other man’s eyes boring into his head, he realized that he should respond.
“Ok, William,” John nodded, “I’m right to assume that isn’t actually your name?”
“Of course,” John’s face morphed into something akin to concern, “is there anything you need to tell me?”
room. Right here, right now, what is she?”
“No.”
Slipping out of bed, he rinsed his mouth and made his way to the living room. (Which Sherlock noted, was wrapping paper free) Rosie and John were reading an interactive children's book, that had undoubtedly been left there from one of the many visits he had from the two of them. Rosie randomly pushing one of the many buttons, each button producing a random animal sound.
John gazes at the door and then at Mike, silently questioning what the hell had just happened.
The other man stops and studies John, his eyes running up and down John, “I know you’re an Army doctor and you’ve been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help because you don’t approve of him, possibly because he’s an alcoholic. More likely because he recently walked out on his soulmate, and you’re bitter because you lost your own soulmate. And last but not least, I know that your therapist thinks your limp’s psychosomatic, quite correctly, I’m afraid.”
Sherlock scoffed, "Then you've clearly haven't heard everything about me. If you had, you would’ve known that I am known for being an unpredictable psychopath. Now, I’ll say it again. Shut up or you're going to regret it.”
Mary places a hand on John’s arm, who’s sitting on the couch, clenching his fist, “Look, there could’ve been a reason.”
Greg shook his head, "Mycroft called."
Maybe he should've woken Sherlock up. They were only friends and all, and friends definitely didn’t sleep in the same bed. But John’s bed had felt so cold last night and Sherlock was so warm and John was so comfortable; five more minutes couldn’t hurt…
He looks up at Sherlock again and sees Sherlock’s eyes wide, and his shoulders seem tense,
He walked out of the A&E as a long, black, slick car pulled up. Sherlock huffed and the window slid down, revealing Mycroft, and surprisingly, a disheveled Lestrade. An everyday civilian would've been surprised how Mycroft could bring Lestrade into a car and then track down Sherlock was in such a small period of time. But Sherlock, being used to Mycroft's tendency to stalk people, found this only an annoyance and not anything special,
“I don’t know, but there has to be something.”
“Wha- how-?”
"Oh shut up," John snapped, leaning on the counter, "warn a man next time before you speak to them, would you?" He grabbed his cane and stood up straight.
The funeral’s over, and everyone has left. Except for John.
"Hello, Mycroft. I see you kidnapped Lestrade. Is he another one of your minions?"
Check me out at
Flipping John over, Sherlock brought his fingers to John’s mouth, “Suck.”
Thank you to my friend who beta'd this chapter!

Sherlock took a sip of his coffee, “I might, I might not. Though I have the sneaking suspicion you wouldn’t want me to.”
Sherlock turned to Mycroft, "What?"
John laughs, “Oh my gosh. Do you have pictures? Mycroft has got to have pictures! I need to ask him for those!”
Sherlock’s head snapped to Mrs. Hudson and  John cocked his head in confusion, “What do you mean you didn’t come here last night? When I woke up this morning, all the wrapping paper and the dirty mugs were gone,” he turned to Sherlock, “did you do it, Sherlock?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John smiled nervously as he watched William think about it. His plan made sense, but, was he being too forward?
Note: I just realized that I had many typos... My iPhone typing skills aren't the best, so I've moved to my laptop!
John looked up at him, disbelievingly, "Do I like it? I love it, Sherlock! This is wonderful!" He continued studied the watch from the box, "How did you know I wanted a new watch?"
He slowly ate his way through his plate of salty chips, a sip of his tea every now and then. He was nearing the end of his plate when a man -with ginger hair John noticed- sat right next to him.
Sherlock blindly reached for a condom and lube that had been placed on the bedside drawer from only last week; only now unbuttoning his own trousers and pants, sighing as he felt his erection freed. Tearing open the condom, he rolled it in one smooth motion onto the head of his cock with his hands and slicked it with lube.
That day was great at the surgery for John. Well, there were still some difficult patients who had been protesting that they were fine. (Which was, in his opinion, was idiotic. It was their choice to come to the surgery. They came to the surgery, meaning that they weren’t feeling 'fine.')
“Fuckfuckfuck -there, oh- fuckfuckfuck,
He had been fresh out of the war, living in a tiny bedsit right outside of London when Mike Stamford introduced him to this job. "Ignis et Aurum," the place was called. He was sure the name meant something; probably in some ancient language from someplace or somewhere, but he himself didn't know. He tried to do some internet searches, but he got little to none information about its name, or its history. Just the website for the hotel itself, and the surprising amount of recommendations it had.
The lady looked up, "Are you related to him?"
“Sorry, I completely lost track of time,” John shook his head while laughing softly, “I have to go, now.” He slipped his gloves back on and stood up. Looking back down at the table, he realized he hadn't paid yet.
“Stop it!” Sherlock sounds angry and a bit desperate as he searches the area behind John. John’s left-hand throbs.
“Oi!” John frowned, “I liked that title!”
He sees the spark of wood before he feels it. John’s eyes widen in horror as he watches the fire spread up the wood.
"No."
He collapses onto the ground again and tries to think. The ceiling is thinner than the bottom, it’s made up of wood, and he can hear the chatter of people. They all sound relaxed, or even excited, even though there’s a man being captured right next to them.
are you doing, John?!”
“I have an international reputation,” he hears Sherlock slur, “Do you have an international reputation?”
Sherlock snapped around and slammed the door. Lestrade sat down on the floor, his head in his hands, "'It can wait?' People's lives can wait? God, Sherlock can't think without John."
“Sher’rock, you know how to pop a Christmas cracker, right?”
“William Sherlock Scott Holmes.”
“What if we try?” John suggests, and Sherlock peers up at John, “I… I want to try, Sherlock. Do you?”
"I have to show you in the car, Sherlock. Believe it or not, some things are meant to be confidential."
John raises his eyebrows, “Nice.”
And with that statement, John’s left in a perplexed state of mind. He’s always like what? Dramatic? An arsehole? Strange? Brilliant?
, his arms and legs shaking with the force of his orgasm.
He sighed.
"Um, yes. What time is last call?"
Sherlock grinned, and before John knew it, both of their shirts had been carelessly ripped off and thrown across the room. Sherlock kept sucking at John’s hard, pink nipples and palming John’s straining erection through his trousers with his right hand; John’s hips bucked and he peered at Sherlock through his eyelids. Reaching down, John tried desperately to undo Sherlock’s trousers, but Sherlock wasn't having it. He pinned John’s arms above his head and ground his hips against John’s. John’s mind slipped offline, not able to make a coherent thought other than
“If I spoke to you something that could never escape from the two of us, could I confide in you?”
All in all, it had been a rare series of small unexpected events, nothing that would surprise him the slightest bit. Interest him? Maybe for a few seconds, yes.
"To the A&E of course. Don't ask stupid questions."
”Did you do all these things just when I was gone?“ John asked curiously.
”Today was the day we met. Do you remember that?“
“Oh my god.”
“Sh-Sherlock
And in what must be his final moments, he hopes that, maybe, he’ll see
Molly paused and gave him a short glance, before picking up her pace again, "The owners prefer privacy. I used to wonder about it too; how they kept the place so successful. The word of mouth is really powerful, I imagine. I don't really know much. After all, I'm just a tour guide here."
John nodded, “And you’ll tell me yours?”
Sherlock frowns from his cup of coffee, “Yes?”
He immediately wants to smack himself in the face.
“Have you ever thought about going ginger?”
"Oh god yes."
course
John stares at the hand. Should he take it? Or should he hug him? Or would that be too much?
"Thank you so much, Sherlock."
to come.
Nevertheless, the world had other plans for him. Because within two hours, his good mood was crushed; by a thirty-one-year-old male with black slicked hair cradling a broken arm and a severely injured ankle. When John had asked him how he had broken his arm, all he got as an answer of, “I tripped,” and when John asked how he tripped, he got a, “None of your fucking business.” Which John had huffed at and distracted himself with the medical history of the man.
Mary smiled, it was rather uncomfortable in John's opinion "I will be joining you so it would be less work for you. Would that be ok with you?"
Sherlock doesn’t say anything. John takes it as a cue to continue.
“No.” John grips the door handle tighter and he can feel his left ring finger throb, “Friends protect people.”
"Sorry?"
? “Is that it?”
But no matter how long he wondered, he never got an answer.
“I thought that you’d like it. With your interest in honey bees and in English literature.”
“But it was creative! I couldn’t have called it, ‘Naive Red-Headed Baseball Players’ could I? You have to give me some creativity credit!”
But it can’t be, right? There’s no way,
Before John could object, Sherlock had left to stumble in the dark to find torches and blankets, leaving John to just shrug his shoulders in defeat and hold Rosie tighter.
Sherlock muttered thanks, (which surprised Lestrade greatly. Since when did Sherlock say thank you? Especially to his brother?) and exited the car.
He watched John nod, "Y-yeah. You're right," John opened his mouth, and Sherlock thought he was going to say something, but instead, John pulled out his phone and typed something. Sherlock felt his phone buzzed just a few seconds later and he opened the text.
to be.” The man he can’t be.
Sherlock nodded and turned swiftly away to put the kettle on, carefully selecting two mugs from the shelve. The rest was a simple process, and within ten minutes they were both sitting in their armchairs, sipping mugs of tea; Rosie cuddled on John’s lap, sleeping peacefully. The two of them sitting in comfortable silence. John didn’t seem to mind the wrapping paper, and if he did, he didn’t mention it. Sherlock supposed it was because after living with Sherlock for nearly four years, he got used to perpetual mess.
Her name’s Mary Morstan.
“No,” Sherlock rolls onto his side, “...’ssumed you didn’t wanna talk about it.”
John laughed while Sherlock nodded, ”Git.“
--------------------------------------
John shook his head wordlessly, not wanting to admit that he had probably come in a half hour early.
William frowned, “A full year. That works. Where would you like to meet?”
Disclaimer: I do not work at a bar, but I have tried my hardest to research as much as I can. If you find any mistakes or things I should add, don't hesitate to tell me in the comments!
Sorry I didn't finish this earlier! I had to visit my family and then I got smacked in the face with a headache...
“Alone is what I have. Alone protects me.”
They shake one last time, and he looks down at Sherlock's left hand, where his soulmate mark is still visible. John doesn’t think about why that mark is so special to him. Even after all these years of knowing it was there.
Sherlock threw open the door where Lestrade was standing.
John smiled at him with kind eyes and a broad smile that Sherlock adored. He opened his mouth to speak, "I love-"
The next day, he and John were back on the dock. Sherlock turned his head to John and felt a swell of happiness and love in his chest.
”Molly came last night? But I was here last night, why didn’t I hear her?“
He presses Sherlock closer to him and kisses him again.
He had had a feeling that the man was the murderer. But after getting kicked out by Elise, he hadn’t thought of it as a possibility, “How did you arrest him?”
“So do I.” John waved goodbye one last time and he speed-walked out the door and into the hot winter air. He felt a stupid smile grow on his face.
He climbed into Sherlock’s lap to get better leverage, grounding his hips onto Sherlock’s, taking advantage of the gasp that escaped Sherlock to enter his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, their tongues’ dancing around each other; both men groaning when their tongues touched.
The music from the little MP3 player had become bleak and eerie. John thought about turning it off, but it fit their situation so well that he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He simply rode quietly, watching the woody behemoths looming over them as they wound through what a sign had called “The Avenue of the Giants.”
But then you shall forget!
on the road. I’m going to need you to get in my car.”
“John. Are you on vacation?”
"I think I'll stay out here and guard the entrance."
“Meet next Saturday, yes, tee-shawp.” Fawnlock clutched the black audio book box to his chest.
“Yes. It contracts about 60-70 times a minute, pushing blood to the lungs and, once it’s oxygenated, to the rest of the body through the arteries. The blood returns to the heart through the veins.” She pointed out an artery and a vein as she spoke.
“OH OH SHERLOCK YES FUCK RIGHT THERE, SHOVE IT IN ME SHERLOCK”
cold water dumped through the towel onto Sherlock, who carefully did not make any movement with his mouth, remembering the delicate material within, and John laughed in surprise and covered Sherlock to protect him, pulling his cock from Sherlock’s mouth by accident and receiving the benefit of the whole bundle of ice, as the towel knot gave way, to the back of his neck in recompense.
They started tasting each other, not dipping inside. Their bodies pressed close. Sherlock held John tenderly, feeling the warmth of the person in his arms.
“Ah, that must be what I’m doing.” And John went back to tickling, just a little, on Sherlock’s sides with his fingers.
“John! Stop it!” Sherlock snapped at him.
“Nothing wrong with country music.” John turned on the radio and started pushing the scan button. It started from the top of the dial.
“We were trying out a
“We shouldn’t linger.” He turned his head as he replied, and Sherlock leaned in to capture his lips in a salt-tinged kiss. Arms wrapped around him as Sherlock’s tongue plunged into his mouth, and the kiss turned hungry.
“Yes, but—”
distracted
"With some help."
"Should be sufficient."
“Got it,” Sherlock crowed as his somewhat deflated penis dragged over John’s chest. John took the opportunity to spank Sherlock’s conveniently positioned arse.
, John!” Sherlock shouted suddenly. John jumped up from the bed to cover his alarm and sat down on the couch, glaring.
“For God’s sake, it’s room service! I called them myself! It’s
“Yes, when the sun is directly above us, noon. I think I need to get you a watch and teach you about time-keeping.”
“When he played it for the Union of Composers, they deemed the cycle too discordant and Western-styled to be proper Soviet music. Like many of the Soviet artists of that era, he was censored. I think perhaps he was a bit sad when he composed this.”
Sherlock lifted back up off of John, leaned down, gave his neck a light bite, and began to fuck him in earnest. John started grunting in time with each thrust. The bed, which was built
Once he was out of sight of his hated brother, he found a berry bush and fell upon it, stuffing berries into his mouth, well aware that he had let himself get into a state where he almost hadn’t been able to refuse the order to return home.
He let out a whimper as the tip of John’s tongue circled around his furl. Then broad strokes were being applied across his entrance, and he looked down to see a pulse of pre-cum ooze out of his still-leather-bound cock. And then John was pushing in, just a little, and Sherlock wailed. It was too intimate, he couldn’t process it, he needed to come so very badly…

“Do you feel this is too much of a chance?” Sherlock sounded like he honestly wanted John’s opinion.
“Eucalyptus. An imported, invasive species; grows all around the Bay Area but is particularly pungent, for some reason, in the Presidio.”
“Now here I have something for you to take home. This is the alphabet. Let’s go through it, and then you can practice it at home.” Greg pulled out a colorful sheet of laminated paper with letters and corresponding objects on it. He looked around the tea shop; it was empty, aside from the hostess, who was very busy polishing spoons and pretending not to watch them. Well, in for a penny, Greg thought.
“Good boy. The scratching is good, is it? The scratching is giving you lovely layers of sensation; the cuffs are keeping you grounded. The way you are moving, you actually think you are bound to the bed now. That’s fascinating; that’s really good, John. You are doing so beautifully. You are making me so hard. You are so incredibly sexy right now. Keep following my voice. Now we’re going to do some pinching.”
John put his head down on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock could feel his t-shirt getting wet, but John made no sound.
“No worries, luv. That was your first time, yeah? First time is always fast. Besides, you’ll be ready to go again in a few minutes, right? While we’re waiting, let me show you something you can do to me…”
“Fifty minutes.”
John was careful to keep the horror Mycroft’s words had struck within him off his face, hidden in his heart. What had happened to this precious man?
Sherlock blinked slowly and realized he was breathing shallowly. Stress breathing. He took a slow, deep breath, and tried to let his mind drift clean.
“You’d better start moving mister, or we’re going to have words.”
Sherlock stroked his hands over the deliciously round arsecheeks, drew them apart again, let his tongue settle in the crease just below John’s anus, and—
“And there’s no one around!” John added, a bit too loudly, waving his hands around at the empty highway.
John snorted and pressed the scan button on the radio again. Sherlock noted that it ended on 90.3, the classical station.
“Where?”
“Hm?”
They left the hardware store and meandered to the other side of the street. John bought a pair of rainbow cufflinks in a novelty shop; then they purchased fragrant cookies at a hole-in-the-wall cookie stand.
“I think you will find it a pleasant improvement on ordinary hotel amenities.”
“Oo, Johnny, that’s lovely, that is.”
He reached up to squeeze John’s arsecheeks, needing to feel the soft flesh, and John released his hold on his own buttocks with a sigh. Sherlock vaguely thought that John’s shoulder must have been bothering him, and for a moment he felt bad that he hadn’t anticipated that, but then his tongue slipped in more deeply as John’s anus unexpectedly relaxed, and thought fled again. Now he could push further in.
“What did I do.”
Sherlock moved on to the food aisle, seeing as John was in a useless strop, and picked up a case of bottled water.
, a way of living. We try really hard
“That’s how you’d describe this? ‘An exciting road trip?’”
John reached down and gently rolled one of Sherlock’s balls in his fingers. This was always tricky; some guys loved it, and some guys reacted very, very negatively to any touch in that region.
“With mine own two hands, my darling.” Sherlock lifted said hands from the wheel, making John huff. He took the wheel again. “And my violin.”
“For a little while, we had an ice maker on base, but it broke down so much we just gave up. Of course, we had one in hospital, but we needed that for the patients.”
“Come on, come to the bar, let me buy you a drink! What would you like?”
Apologies to Yeats’ “The Second Coming” and Thomas’ “Do not go gentle into that good night”, whose words were twisted for Sherlock’s snark.
“Not a chance.”
Hundreds of kilometres away, Fawnlock gazed at the moon through the open window in his new bedroom. He rubbed thoughtfully at the hated nubs of new antlers. He really would have to come up with some formula to keep them from growing anew each year. A breeze swept in, bringing with it the scent of primroses. Fawnlock found himself thinking about last spring, about sitting at the edge of a clearing and watching a certain boy gaze up at the moon. Then he thought about that same boy doing things behind the canvas of what he now knew was called a tent, noisy things with other humans that made Fawnlock feel more alone than he’d ever felt. He looked down from the window and went back to studying the acid solutions outlined in the most recent issue of the Royal Society of Chemistry’s “Analyst” that the Lyndhurst Public Library had (several years old; he really needed a university connection), and he stopped thinking about primroses and human boys’ backyards.
“Three!” John bent down and gave Sherlock’s cock a long, leisurely pull with lots of tongue, getting a couple of icy drips on his own head for his trouble.
“It sounds sad.”
“Dr Watson. I wanted to apologize to you personally. There have been some inexcusable problems that have now been handled. If anything else goes wrong, you or Sherlock are to call me immediately. I am appalled at the performance over the past few hours and I am very, very sorry for the danger in which you have been placed.
John pressed his palm against it, warm, firm, and could feel Sherlock’s pulse pounding beneath the skin, his chest rising and falling quickly with his breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Indeed you are,” Sherlock said calmly as he wiped his fingers on the grass. He unzipped his flies and pulled out his hard cock, which was indeed leaking, and drizzled cold lube on it, coating it perfunctorily as he was rather close to coming from John’s enthusiasm. He rubbed the head up and down John’s greasy crease once, then pushed slowly, slowly in, not stopping until he had his pubis pressed against John’s soft, fleshy behind.
, and that sweet, sweet nectar poured into my body and once again I was cumming with every atom of my bee-ness…after five or six more flower-orgasms, I was so full, it was like having a very full bladder, and I knew I had to fly back to the hive and spew everything into the communal pot, but before I could get there-–I was back here.”
Sherlock thought.
“Martha, we did the best we could with the girl.”
“‘Cut it out,’ or words to that effect. I always try a deduction once with a new client; not sure why, because no one wants to hear it, so I keep my observations to myself for the most part and simply act on them. I’ve consequently been accused of having psychic abilities. Always in an admiring tone, of course. Clients love to have their needs anticipated; they just don’t want to know how it’s done.”
Death in the family. On hiatus.
And then he caught a glint of streetlight off the eyes that lifted to stare directly at his window.
Fawnlock didn’t show up for his reading lesson the week after he got the book. He watched from the edge of the village as the book man went into the building and then exited a good while later. He watched the next Saturday and the next, too, and then the book man didn’t come to the building any more.
John took a moment to breathe. Yes, there was no doubt that these two were related.

“Something changed, after I got shot. I’ve tried going on dates, the last six months. Never got past a dinner and a walk home. I don’t know. I just...being shot at, having that, I guess, violation of my body, as they say in physical therapy—it makes me feel a bit different about having somebody touch me.”
“Thanks, man.” The boy grinned and did some complicated hand shake/bump maneuver with Sherlock, who mirrored it perfectly, and then left the room. Sherlock rolled the cart in and began to pour the tea. John grabbed a cream puff.
“That’s only for HIV. And I trust that you have followed your insanely careful safer sex practices the entire time you’ve been a Companion. Were there any mistakes?”

“Huh.”
“What do you want from me, Sherlock? There’s no reason for me not to go in there. None at all. I’ll prove it to you. Let’s just go back in and get it
why people have dessert,” but he thought it might be a touch too snarky, so he just held Sherlock, who, surprisingly, fell into a rather deep sleep. Through some awkward maneuvering, John was able to pull the duvet half over Sherlock from the other side of the bed, and John watched him fondly as he breathed deeply, wondering just how much sleep he usually got.
He really had fallen quite hard for this little soldier.
Sherlock made a face.
The forest started to thin out, and then as the sun reluctantly set and the light grew dimmer, Johnny glimpsed his home through the trees.
“I think so? I don’t remember a lot of it...but I remember feeling really nice, kind of, above my body? And...well...this is really embarrassing. But Molly...I felt

Seriously, let me say it again: please play safe! I want all you lovely readers to live long and prosper and not have to deal with disease or have to tell potential partners about disease and, if it’s your thing, get to play with lots of other people without having to worry. As a sex worker, Sherlock knows the deal and knows how to take care of himself! Okay, end of lecture
After a pause, he added, “But I’m not sure I can be called an ‘art lover’. Maybe an ‘art liker’?”
Fawnlock looked up at her, surprised, and she glared back at him. Immediately she wanted to back down—
"Yes?"
“Maybe I don’t feel like
“You know, like this cream in a tiny pitcher instead of little plastic cups. Or the sugar in a covered bowl instead of paper sachets. This lovely little dish, full of butter, instead of foil packets that get all greasy and stick to everything.”
“Do I need to find you some clean pants, John?”
He realized his hips were moving again, just slightly, but he tried to do as Sherlock said and trust him to stop John from choking him if necessary. Then he felt Sherlock’s fingers on his right nipple and again, he looked down his body. Sherlock was pinching and rolling and oh

John almost felt disappointed.
work.”
He hadn't ever indulged in something like this, but the thought of spending his third Christmas on base while most of his comrades were back with their families, wasn't appealing in the slightest.
John reluctantly unpinned Howard and turned to Elise,“But he’s not innocent! This man has murdered three people already, and can murder more-”
Every few sentences, John would interject, “Brilliant,” or “Amazing,” and Sherlock would smile and continue. That’s how their conversation went. It was as if nothing had ever changed. That he had ever faked his death, John had never gotten married, and that John had never moved out.
John laughs, “What is it?”
"What?"
“Oh.”
His other hand felt right next to him. A needle.
Or was it?
“Well, we’re soulmates, we’re both only here temporarily, and we both have to leave soon. It would be nice if we could meet again, you know?”
He stepped inside and set his coat in his old armchair while Sherlock closed the door behind him. He cleared his throat, “Tea?”
John clenches his eyes shut and squeezes his hand into fists. Sherlock's death hurts more than William’s death does. Which, in a way, makes sense. He hisses a shaky breath between his teeth and feels a sharp pain in his left hand and he looks down at it. His soulmate mark seems to be brighter.
It was a silver watch. Sherlock fidgeted in anticipation as John observed it. Sherlock must've spent hours and hours trying to pick it out. He had gone to every shop he could think of, trying to find the perfect gift. "Do you like it?"
“Yes, John?”
"Little before 1 AM," Mary answered and her eyebrows furrowed, "did Molly not tell you that?"
John glanced at Sherlock, his eyebrows raised and a smile on his face, “Oh did he?” Sherlock averted his attention to the fireplace, ignoring John’s gaze,
John patted Lestrade on the back, “Thanks for telling me mate. And good luck with him.”
Mary looks up from her food from across the table, “Ok with that?”
William smiled shyly back and nodded, “Yes, I-I suppose it is.”
But after one week passed, and John had not returned; after the countless calls and texts to John he had made, all ignored, he felt less irritated and more of, well, more of worry. And no matter how many times the phrase:
Sherlock groaned, “Fine, yes. I concede. It was creative. It was hardly scientific, nor did it illuminate the actual process, but yes, it was
Rosie jumps up, “Why?”
Lestrade sighed, “Howard Mossle had reacted," he paused, "
“Ohhh,” John nodded. He was beginning to understand, “your partner then?”
Mary hugs John from the side, “I’m sorry, John. I really am.”
He stood back up, wincing, and raced out the door of the flat, passing by the dinner table to see his alarm clock crushed into little pieces with Sherlock sitting above it, studying it with scrutiny under a microscope.
Molly's lips pressed into a thin line, "Well I was supposed to be, Ms. Morstan, but something urgent came up here so I agreed to stay," Molly replied, a strained smile on her face as she bit out her reply. The blonde lady, most likely deciding to ignore Molly's obvious dislike, turned her attention to John.
, (Even if it really was a Christmas film, it was still a good romance film) was playing on the telly, which was now plugged in.
She shrugged, "The AC must've gone out. I'll talk to the manager about it now."
John leans back, “Of course, I couldn’t figure it out on my own; Lestrade had to help me. I was a bit slow, I admit. But, I did get it, eventually.”
John stared at the other man in disbelief and broke into a giggle, albeit a little delirious, “Honestly, I guessed the second one.”
“What the-” he takes a deep shuddering breath, “Sherlock that’s not a solution to this. You can't-
"I assure you that now is a more desirable time. I have a case for you and I be under the impression that my brother would like to hear this as soon as possible."
John stands in front of Sherlock on the tarmac, as the plane stands behind Sherlock. The wind tussles his hair.
"Then I won't."
“As it turns out, he was the one who had committed the three murders.”
He blearily blinked a few times. There was tan cracked surface above him. He blinked a few more times and found it was a ceiling.
“What’s the point of me lying? I already told you I’m not from America.”
John laughed, but Sherlock could tell it was fond, "Oh, you're adorable."
Sherlock's panic must've shown on his face because in seconds John was calling his name,
William Smith snarled, “Look here you fu-”
Sherlock hummed in agreement, “But, I daresay it’s the most beautiful thing I see.”
“I look forward to it.”
“What are you smiling about?” John couldn’t help asking. Sherlock didn’t smile unless something extremely exciting happened. Like a triple homicide with the doors locked from the inside and no correlation between the victims.
He let it go.
Sherlock huffed, turned away from Lestrade and entered the room, slamming the door behind him.
. William Scott was
Looking around, he saw a large black L-shaped couch in the middle of the room on top of a dark red carpet. There was a glass table in front of it which had a vase of flowers and available ashtrays.
___________________________
John scrunches his eyebrows, “Then who said anything about flatmates?”
“It was all just simple deduction; quite elementary.”
“You’re properly insane if you think I’ll spend one more second with Mycroft then I have to.”
The realization dawned on John, “...they didn’t show up.”
An hour later than he should’ve.
Sherlock felt his heartbeat skyrocket. Where was this going? "Yes?"
Mary smiles sweetly and reaches her left arm across the table to grab his left hand; revealing her own soulmate mark on her left hand, “Oh John. Of course, I don’t mind. If I did, it would be rather hypocritical of me, wouldn’t it?”
Sherlock bites his lip and looks away, “Your stag night. You told me how you met your soulmate.”
No offense but I’m glad you didn’t come to parents day. It was just like Bill said, some of the lads lost their balance after seeing their folks.
“This is Michael Charing. He had an accident with his bicycle yesterday and was brought in last night from the hospital.”
“Careful, sloths have vicious claws.”
“A requirement for a Holmes child,” Sherlock said softly, watching John, and resumed the wordless melody.
When they returned to the room, John flopped down on the couch.
Mycroft be delighted. And
“Yes, I know who Harvey Milk was.”
“What did it feel like?”
“That’s unlikely.”
“You can choose what we eat,” Sherlock finished lamely, biting his lower lip.
“Don’t worry about my brother. I will contact him myself in a moment. Thank you for your inquiries into our well-being; we are, as you can see, both fine.” Sherlock slammed the door, found his trousers, and dragged out his phone. A few angry stabs and he was connected.
It’s probably unusual for someone to be
And then the buzzing started. This was why Sherlock generally kept his eyes open; if he closed them, he often simply fell asleep. The buzzing was very similar to the state just before hallucinatory thought or lucid dreaming began. There were no actual thoughts; just a pleasant static that felt as though it was located in the upper third of his cranium. Over the past year, he had been able to extend this state to 30 minutes and longer, and he let out a sigh that no one heard and fell into emptiness.
“The Adder is at Lake Baikal; I am in Cypress. Easy enough to hit
“Where, you mean across from here?”
Johnny felt a calm wash over him. It was obvious what he’d have to do.
“Yes, but…”
“Ah, the younger brother.
“Would you
“So, what’s good to eat around here?”
“There was nothing simple about it, John, but yes, anyone with a strong mind could do it. With the right motivation and a little mental elbow grease, there’s nothing to it.”
John looked at Sherlock.
By now, Fiona had gotten very close to Brandi and was speaking very softly. Brandi’s pyjamas began to feel too warm under the covers, but she was suddenly shy about pushing the covers off. Fiona wasn’t looking at Brandi’s eyes any more; she seemed to be whispering directly at Brandi’s mouth. Brandi licked her lips without noticing.
“What next?” asked John, stuffing his jeans pocket with a handful of vintage candy that he’d purchased as they settled the bill at the counter.
“Sherlock oh fuck oh fuck I need to come please god let me come I can’t take it any more this is the most incredible thing I’ve ever felt, get this thing off me I’m going to burst let me come now please please I beg you I love you I love you you’re amazing I need you fuck me now Sherlock get your cock inside me I need you fuck me I love you…”
“We’re going to try some touch now, John. Focus on my fingertips, let yourself feel my fingers touching your skin, connecting to you.” Sherlock began to stroke his fingertips along John’s chest and belly. It felt like ten pinpoints of St Elmo’s Fire—brilliant light without searing heat. John felt his torso arch to meet Sherlock’s hands.
“I didn’t do it to
Lestrade sighed. He still wasn’t used to how Fawnlock did this sort of mind-reading, fortune-telling thing he did, but he had been doing it for a month now and had read Lestrade’s own life to him backwards and forwards. Fawnlock said it was entirely from “deduction” and explained several, sometimes embarrassing, deductions with threads on his pants or crumbs in his scarf or other ridiculously small “clues,” and Lestrade had made his peace with it.
The man rested furred hands on Johnny’s shin and began to sing softly. Johnny couldn’t understand the words, but he felt as though his chest was filled with warmth, almost as if his heart was glowing, and he sensed that somehow everything was going to be all right. The pain began to ebb in his leg and he watched as the strange angle of his shin straightened, and then there was no pain any more, just his good old leg the way it should be. The man rubbed his hands gently up and down Johnny’s shin a few times and finished his song.
it. Yes, I fucked up in London. And yes, you will never,
“Huh?” John blinked at Sherlock.
Because he could not yet read, he did not see the headline of
“Uh, butter?”
“Of course you are.”
“Okay. Good to know.” John was gripping the wheel tightly again.
That call brought cheering from multiple levels of the stairwell, and the crisis was quickly turning into a party atmosphere. John looked back at Sherlock, who was making him stay in front, with a grin. Sherlock flashed a smile at him, but John saw he was texting as they jogged down.
“Your brother called me your significant other,” John murmured against Sherlock’s mouth.
The song changed again.
John looked up at him, glaring, when details were not forthcoming.

The only people who have never been to a Denny’s are my mother and my brother; if they ever set foot in one, the falcon will not hear the falconer, the centre will not hold, and the light will surely die.”
glued to it. He thought he could make out some dolls, a teapot, and were those...mannequin legs?
“God, yes.”
“Excuse me, I’m going to have to ask you to get dressed and show me some identification. You too, ma’am.”
“Yes,” he said softly, kissing the downy neck he was nuzzled against. “God, yes.”
“Sherlock! Did you take anything?”
Now he had to think of another way to bring Sherlock close to orgasm. He looked back down at Sherlock’s weeping, angry cock, which looked about one mild breeze away from coming all over Sherlock’s chest. He leaned over Sherlock and peered at the floor.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, "An attack? Why did he call about that? He, his minions, or even the Yard could probably solve the case. There are plenty more things already consuming my mind. The last thing I want clogging up my brain more is a pointless case right now."
John raised his eyebrows and stared at him in disbelief, “What’s the point of lying about your appearance?”
Abruptly, Sherlock was thrust off the dock face-first into the suddenly cold water.
She clapped her hands and giggled, “Santa! Santa!”
“You said it was.”
“Well, then who did? Did someone sneak into our flat?”
He tries to recall what happened.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Yes! Baseball? League?”
“John, we have to go. The cab is waiting for us.”
“What happened?”
A few minutes later, John had found a new place on the couch, and Sherlock had come back with two blankets, and two torches that were lit that he had procured from his bedroom.
“She was wrong about me.”
“Somewhere in  London, maybe? How about St. Barts? Do you live near there?”
Greg winced at Sherlock's messy state. His wrinkled robe was hanging loose on his gaunt frame and there were dark circles under his eyes, contrasting against his too pale skin. He had forgotten how poorly Sherlock took care of himself before John came along.
“Now Rosie,” John started, “Now that's Sherlock’s awake, let's see what Santa gave you!”
Into battle.
"I'm tired of this! I'm tired of what you do and how you act every single bloody day! I am done, Sherlock! Done!"
Sherlock’s looking around frantically, “Who are you?”
Number one, Sherlock Holmes is the most annoying man he has ever met.
“Since when was that box under our Christmas tree?”
John clicked on the search bar and started typing:
“Well there's you, but you're not exactly going to be here, are you?”
"I need to see him!"
“Last night.”
In other words, this was not your traditional loud-yelling-and-dancing bar. Which made sense, as this hotel was not only sophisticated but would also set you back at least 160 pounds. If John turned his head to the left, he could see people in long dresses and prim suits sitting at tables, making quiet conversation. The couch in the middle of the room was rather empty, save for a few people spread out on it.
But then, it hit him. Sherlock hadn’t ever changed, had he? John had been living for the past few months, assuming that Sherlock was changing. Just a little by little, even. But this; this showed he really hadn’t, “Sod this. Sod this. You stay here if you want; on your
Sherlock laughed and they sat on other sides of the table, eating the pasta with pleasant conversation.
Twenty-five minutes later, John found himself at the bar as Mary gave him a gist of how things worked. He tried to memorize the things as she went.
Grabbing the thin, paper menu with his gloved hands, John debated whether or not to order any drinks or food. On one hand, someone might notice him. On the other hand, wasn't eating and drinking something warm the point of his excursion?
The other man thought about it for a season, “William Scott. But you may call me, William.”
“How many did you spot?” Sherlock murmured into John’s neck.
. I am ashamed and appalled at what already happened. I knew within two days what was going on and it took me
“Still under a 6?”
Eight-year-old Johnny is certain that Pan must be real, and he sets out to find him.
“For like, ten seconds…”
“Impossible. I cannot meditate.”
Sherlock was staring at John. He knew his pupils were huge because he couldn’t focus very well. “I would like to know what that feels like,” he whispered.
“Do you have a library card? Of course you don’t. And you’re too shy for reading group. I tell you what.” The librarian stood up and, keeping his hands palms-up, walked slowly past Fawnlock to the library doors.

“I doubt that.”
They made out for a while. Christine helped Johnny find a comfortable position where one leg was sort of wrapped around her hip, the other tucked under her knees. The rhythm of kissing calmed him, and he stopped being quite so nervous.
“It would be my pleasure. Give me a moment.” Sherlock stepped back in his room, turned off the lights, and came back to John wearing soft cotton sweatpants, tied with a drawstring. He closed the door and followed John to the bed.
John kissed Sherlock on the cheek and privately noted that Sherlock seemed genuinely distressed by the tickling; he wouldn’t try that again. He lay on his back on the carpet, catching his breath.

John smirked. A weak-ass plea like that would not lead to anything. He used some suction around the outside of Sherlock’s belly button and sucked up all the lemon-ginger at once, giving the watermelon-coated nipple a particularly sharp, stinging hit with the spoon.
“No, stop, we don’t want to get our scent on it, not good for the mother,” Johnny scolded.
Suddenly, Sherlock found himself on the floor. John was on the other side of the coffee table, breathing hard. Sherlock looked up to see the face of Combat John, the same face John had worn outside the Columbarium. John’s hands were in fists, but he was utterly still; he looked deceptively calm.
“Perhaps. But let’s give it a try, shall we?”
“Wait, which kind of feeding?”
“She said it was an utter disaster. It was impossible for them to maintain the solemn atmosphere past the soup course.”
John twisted around again to stare at him. Sherlock was stunned by how wrecked John looked now. A red flush had crept up his chest and neck and painted his cheeks; his lips looked swollen from where he had been biting them. His eyes were wide and dark; his expression was dazed.
“I’ve got to get you two out of here. C’mon.”
“Sherlock, I’m trying to ask you something here.”
“Uggh!”
The lieutenant overseeing his company never questioned whether it was in Private Watson’s best interests to be pushing himself so hard. The one time John’s situation came to his attention was when he was asked to sign off on Watson’s continued orderly service after six months, and a faint thought went through his head about the Army getting their money’s worth out of the boy. The lieutenant had over 100 souls in his company and had bigger problems than worrying about overachievers who kept their noses clean and did everything that was asked of them.
“Sherrrrrrrlock…”
“You are familiar with the practice of BDSM?”
John watched Sherlock carefully, seeing his face go blank.
“John. John, you’re all right. Come on, let’s get you to the room.”
, and I don’t have to spell it out. But he just looks at me, y’know, nice-like, but like he’s not gonna say it for me. So it starts to get weird, so I say ‘She said you got her sorted, right?’
It looked so much like his mother griping at Harry that he began to laugh.
Tracklist:
“Oi!”
“Tell me,” John said through gritted teeth and a clenched jaw.
John raised his head from where he’d been staring at his nearly clear semen. He looked into Sherlock’s eyes, which were more green than blue in this light and had sparkles of gold.
“Now now, I’m sure you’ve used these before. Can I take off this wrap, or is it some kind of religious thing?”
“Luckily, it’s the right sort of tail.” Sherlock leaned in and spoke directly into John’s ear to counteract the wind and the crash of the waves. His lips were hot against cold skin, and John shivered.
So he decided to take charge of his jack-off fantasies. He didn’t know of any visual materials other than his comic books, so he turned to his beloved friends, the Silver Surfer and Wonder Woman and Spiderman. Their sculpted bodies, bulging in their colourful outfits, provided ample material to keep his brain occupied with more acceptable images.
"Where are we going?" John yelled, his voice tense with adrenaline, as he struggled to untangle himself from Sherlock. The response was silence until they were on the highway.
For a few moments, he was able to focus on the sensation of his own scalp. As he concentrated on it, he could feel individual sections of his head almost tingling with awareness. He could feel that he had hair above his forehead, behind his ears, at the crown of his head, marching down to the back of his neck. It was pleasant and reassuring. He started breathing more deeply without realizing it.
“Do you know when, how, and to where we are escaping?”
“Let me put the table down for you. You may be a bit wobbly for a few minutes; perfectly normal.”
“I’m frightened for you, Fawnlock.”
, just
“John, then. The question is, did mentioning the placebo effect, just now, eliminate its efficacy?”
“Fuck, fuck, I’m sorry, shit…”
“We were really hoping you could find some way around that, you see.”
“Ah, Japan. That’s the band name. I’d heard of them, but never bothered listening. Interesting. Delightfully eclectic. Note how minimalist the instrumentation is, John. Not what you would expect from a band that has name recognition.”
“John? What can I do for you?”
. The Force was a real thing to him, and he dreamed at night that he was living in Cloud City or that he had been chosen as the Kwisatz Haderach. He and his mother read L’Engle’s Time Trilogy to each other, discussing the philosophy and science therein. Soundtracks by John Williams and Bernard Hermann filled his ears from a Walkman cassette player he’d received for his twelfth birthday. He did his homework earnestly and thoroughly and spent a great deal of time staring out the window at the forest, daydreaming about what the future might be like.

“Fuck off!”
He gasped as his eyes opened to a darkened room, city lights reflected on the ceiling he was staring at. He was panting; his heart was pounding. For a few moments he could feel the piercing, unbelievable pain of the fresh shoulder wound; then it faded into the exaggerated ache that always came after these nightmares. He curled over on his side and tried to calm his breathing. He pounded his fist into the mattress, once. Not a single night...he couldn’t have even
For years he had lived away from the treehouse now, bedding down in grassy hollows or fallen trees when he absolutely had to sleep. (Sleep was tedious in the extreme).
Sherlock couldn’t hold back. John was so hot inside, and so slippery from all the preparation. Sherlock had never fucked anyone bare. The sensation was far more intimate. He slid until he was fully engulfed in John, and then he pressed his chest against John’s back, and wrapped his arms around John’s arms, and buried his face in John’s shoulder.
Dreadful Boy giggled nervously.
But cocaine it was, so cocaine Sherlock had to have, the first day he arrived at Cambridge.
He’d never had one as delightfully naïve. Really, that display in Good Vibrations had been precious.

“I think that’s the first time I’ve seen you sleep.”
“I didn’t—”
“Please,” he tried to whimper around John’s tongue.
“As long as it’s not avoidance.”
John smiles. “Of course you can, Rosie.” He’s pleased that Rosie’s been avidly learning her numbers; and that Sherlock has been just as avidly teaching her.
“No,” Sherlock slurs approvingly, “And I can’t even remember what for. Sss.. crime… something or... other.”
Sherlock looked away bashfully, mumbling, "No I don't."
They don't stop. And yeah, Sergeant Donovan looks at them with an offended expression, and yeah, Sherlock is a bit of a prat who doesn't take mistakes very well, and has many enemies, and ok, yeah, Mycroft, (
It wasn't until his shift was close to ending, that John fully appreciated the lack of people at the bar. It wasn't like he disliked having conversations with people, (he could do that exceptionally, thank-you-very-much) it was sheer physical discomfort.
TUESDAY AFTERNOON- “The City at Night” has crumbled due to the combustion of multiple bombs. There have been five injured, and three known deaths. Their reported names were William Scott, Taimar Nabi, and Mahvash Abboud. As of now, not much is known on how or what happened, but city officials are looking into the bombing.
. You’re not getting it.
Light footsteps echo through the large room and off the wooden columns. The footsteps stop right behind him. A soft hand lands on his shoulder.
John can feel the sharp edges of the stairs, as Sherlock and he collapses on top of them.
He pulls his eyelids apart and peers his head up. It's Sherlock. Sleeping next to him.
Sherlock scowled, “Oh shut up.” But John’s shit-eating grin didn’t fade.
John giggles and watches Sherlock take off his left glove and lifts out his hand. (It's odd, as the proper handshake etiquette is with your right hand, but John doesn't mind.)
“The woman who’s carrying my child who has lied to me since the day I met her?”
“Interesting…”
The other man nods as if to say, ‘that’s right,’ “I’ve got my eye on a nice little place in Central London. Together, we ought to be able to afford it. We’ll meet there tomorrow evening, at 7 o’clock. Sorry, got to dash, I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
Sherlock cut him off, "I think it is certainly my 'damn business'. Now, you better shut up before I break a few promises and punch you in the face right now."
John looks up at Sherlock, “Sorry?”
John had been reluctant at first,
"Ms. Morstan can be quite an excited person, yes." he could see her grit her teeth, "But that's not important now." Molly walked over to the bulletin board on the wall, "These are all your shifts. You will only be switching shifts with Ms. Morstan as she is the barmaid here. There are only about one hundred guests in the hotel at one time, so you should only need the two of you. But if more guests show up, or one of you need to take a day off, we can get another bartender to help out."
“Yeah,” Mike smiles smugly, “he’s always like that.”
“Oh!” John said, “I got you something too Sherlock!”
John cut him off by the rise of his hand, “I came here on the Tube. And the reason I came was to visit you, you dolt. It’s Christmas Eve, people visit people they love and care about around this time of year, remember? It’s-”
Sherlock nodded in faux seriousness, “I see. Is it a good story?”
That seems to be an explanation enough for Rosie and she grabs one of the tissue paper crowns and hands it to Sherlock. Sherlock puts it on his head, “Is Daddy going to put on his tissue paper hat too?”
Sherlock
Sherlock’s head snaps up, and he looks surprised.
Lestrade held up a hand, "Wait, how was he not found along with Blythe Evans? If they worked together, wouldn't they be committing the crimes, together?"
He shook his head. When was he ever going to get over this paranoia of his? He couldn't flip out every time someone said, 'good luck’ to him. He let out a deep breathe.
“I-I don’t know, mate. Sorry about that.”

John feels a little bit flattered, but he groans in exasperation, “Someone else!”
A few days before the party, he was experimenting on his shampoo bottle, when it had exploded. Since John had gone to extra classes that day, Sherlock had to go to the nearest store and had gotten a new bottle. Which he made sure not to poison, explode, or accidentally drop some eyeballs into.
"Hello, Lestrade. I find it a necessity that I inform you of something."
“You said this was a holiday.” Sherlock paused, “This was your idea, wasn’t it? I can’t imagine anyone else convincing me to go on holiday.”
Sherlock shook himself and began to draw the shampoo out through the strands of John’s hair. John turned around and nestled up against Sherlock with a sigh, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock was shocked at how a body so much shorter than his could fit against him so perfectly.
“But, you don’t know where I live!”
Sherlock was curled in a ball on the floor, shaking. John knelt at his side and felt for the pulse at his neck.
is about as real as it gets.  The ale John drinks is from 21st Amendment, where I used to eat lunch when I worked in Silicon Valley North (SOMA).
This was the type of massage John was used to; Sherlock found a pinpoint of pain in his upper-left thigh and leaned into it, hard, with his thumbs. John yelped.
Sherlock looked horrified.
“Which part are you confused about?”

“He’s a medical doctor, he was a client but now he’s not, and he’s both magnificent and fragile, so you can stop terrifying him now, Molly.”
John was different; that was for certain. Educated, highly ethical, and handsome in an unexpected way that John himself clearly did not realize. All of Sherlock’s other clients had been good-looking, or at least had been very sure that they were, even if all evidence was otherwise.
“Orderly on the sixth floor, yeah?”
“Yes?”

John realized he didn’t like hearing this. He hadn’t had any time to process what had happened this afternoon, and as Molly was saying this, part of him rebelled. He totally wanted to do all that again! He’d never felt anything like it...he’d never felt as close to anyone as he’d felt to Sherlock. He’d never felt so
“What?”
“I’m not giving up my phone, Sherlock. I can’t afford another.”
“One of the things we bonded over, originally. I gave her a lot of this music.”
John looked away, processing this.
“Seb, go get the room ready. We will have business to conduct. Make sure there is a plentiful supply,” he directed sharply to the minion Sherlock had seen and mentally dismissed. Then he turned back to Sherlock and leaned over to speak softly, directly into his ear.
, John. Humans are so incredibly
They had agreed that the atmosphere was had gotten a little intense, and they had dressed and headed out for coffee. Sherlock had steered them to a Peet’s coffee shop—”Ordinary, but at least it’s not Starbucks”—where John had gotten a medium drip and a chocolate croissant, and Sherlock had ordered some complicated chai concoction. They strolled to Market Street, where Sherlock stepped into the back of a sudden cab as though it had been waiting for him to appear.
Sherlock set about doing exactly that.
Sherlock tried to slide further under the table in his booth seat, but his knees hit John’s booth seat and prevented his escape.
“I know I should be grateful,” she said, as if challenging him to argue. “But it is not as if they are even trying to provide remotely healthy options. I get a better meal eating MREs in the field, for Christ’s sake. This is

Molly pulled John into a hug, which startled him. It was awkward, the both of them balancing on bar stools, but Molly’s arms were warm and supportive around him, and after a moment he relaxed into it. He could feel her soft breasts against his chest; her hair smelled like apple shampoo. She rubbed her hands softly in circles on his back, and he closed his eyes and let himself be held. He really was rather tired out.
“Very clever, that Sherlock,” Molly said. “I wouldn’t have thought of that. The illusion of being bound—the freedom of feeling held, combined with the freedom of movement. Fantastic! You liked it, right?”
“Coming right up.”
“End of the chapter, lovey. You know what that means.”
John stared out the window at the city lights, half-obscured by the ever-present night fog. “When you touch me, it’s different.”
“Yes.”
“Mycroft.”
This made Johnny laugh harder.
“Good thing I didn’t lose our tail then, wasn’t it. Good thing I didn’t go running around trying to ditch our protection.”
, John! And almost immediately I saw another beautiful flower, practically pulsing in its neon intensity of colour, and I could tell that it would be even tastier than the last, and I unfurled my long black tongue into the pistil…oh, I shivered, John, it was completely an act of penetration…and I
. It’s as though we were having delightful, raunchy sex, and yet from afar, Mycroft was watching and silently judging. He’s not actually interfering, yet it’s still unnerving and patronizing.” Sherlock’s eyes got wide; he stopped talking, walked over to the sink and started fiddling with the coffee maker.
“Good morning, John,” a ridiculously sexy voice murmured behind him. Oh yeah! Sherlock!
John blinked.
Sherlock gave John a very unimpressed glare. It really seemed that they were going down the “save the prostitute” path again.
John’s face took on a sort of defensive cast, and he stood up straight.
Sherlock drew back and thrust in, hard, in response. John groaned.
Sherlock tilted his face towards John. He looked quite unconcerned.
Eureka appeared suddenly out of the dark, a blast of civilization after hours of darkness. Security night lights and neon business signs made it clear they were back amongst people.
“John, I’m sorry. I did not know it would affect you that way.”
“How do you feel?”
“Respectfully, yes we did. Sherlock has hinted at the circumstances in which he had to...leave...London. In fact, those...circumstances...seem to be why he has not been able to come up with a plan for his safe return, and also why he has asked that I be the one to talk to you, even though we do not know each other. When he started thinking about what transpired, he was thrown into a panic attack.”
“Ah, very nice. What is it?”
“—is this whole ‘swooping in and taking over’ thing. I mean, it’s great that he’s trying to keep the bad guys away—”
Johnny looked down at where his cock was straining proudly against its cotton prison.
"Great. Great folks. Well, not all great. Some were right arseholes, but that's life, right? More officers were dicks than enlisted. There was this one woman…" John trailed off.
Fawnlock moved to look at the boy’s face, then examined—without touching—every inch of the boy’s body, his face very close to the skin.
“Be happy for me, Molly.” Sherlock’s tone was intense as he grabbed both her hands in his, leaning over the table. John watched, blowing on his steaming, noxious brew.
"Why not?"
Sherlock hesitated, "I'm the reason this happened to you. The assailant, William Smith, had connections to Blythe Evans -the man we arrested last month- and William wanted revenge. He had figured out that you and I had a hand in arresting him, and when he saw you, well, he was drunk and he set upon attacking you."
"Gin Martini please."
Sherlock sighed, "Yes. He somehow found out that John and I were the reason Blythe was in prison, most likely from the news, and William wanted revenge. So one night, after William had gotten considerably drunk, he had seen John and attacked him."
Mycroft cleared his throat, "I'm presuming you want to know about Dr. Watson's attacker."
“Don’t play-” he grunted as the man manage to knee him in the gut, “-don’t play innocent with me. You have murdered three people already and have injured plenty more.”
John shifted the scarf that was covering his mouth and peered left, right, and made a mad dash into the entrance; making sure his hood covered most of his hair.
With new fervor, Sherlock started to brush the sensitive bundle of nerves more and more, relishing in John’s moan as John helplessly gripped the bed sheets, his eyes screwed shut,
”My room?“
That next evening, Sherlock took a cab to
”She came at 7 PM.“
Sherlock opens the door to their flat and-
Instead, he listens.
They settled into a comfortable silence, watching the film until he felt Sherlock’s fingers massage at John’s left shoulder. John turned his neck around, questioning.

John gave out his wrist and Sherlock adeptly put the new silver watch on John's wrist. He let go of John's wrist and watched with delight as John admired the watch.
"I see you stirred it."
Oh. Mary.
“Elise, if you would only listen-”
There was John. He was shivering and his teeth chattered; his green winter coat was covered in dusty snow, and he was holding a pink coat clad Rosie in his arms. Even so, a huge grin was plastered on his face, “Can I come in?”
“Then why are you suggesting it?”
Sherlock stood up and peered out the window,“It seems we and numerous others have just become victim to a blackout. Most likely due to the snow and the frigid temperature outside.” John put down his mug and strained his neck, gazing out the window too. True to his word, across the street, the windows that were bright just moments ago, were now dark.
“The ocean’s beautiful, isn’t it?” Sherlock watched as John sat down next to him, pushing his sunglasses up off his eyes.
Of course, John wouldn't be there, he got married to Mary.
Yeah, she wasn’t William. She wasn’t Sherlock either. But they both loved each other for who they were, and who they were alone. Didn't that mean more?
Sherlock shrugs, and John can feel his fury intensify, “She’s just my landlady.”
Sherlock takes the piece of paper from Rosie and groans.
“We could... ignore it...?”
It's a thought that has been plaguing him for the last two days when he found Sherlock bleeding out on the ground of Magnussen's office. Only a millimeter away from death, and, oh god, what would happen if Sherlock had died? What would John do? What would-
Lestrade let out a laugh, "Thanks, I think we're going to need it. I've a feeling he's not going to be that cooperative.” Lestrade waved goodbye and got in his police car while John turned to the surgery, a smile spreading across his face.
