Sherlock pushes his chair back from the microscope. He stretches, stands up. Considers sending a text to Lestrade. Decides it would be far more enjoyable to deliver his deductions in person.
He wondered if he could get a new computer. He'd need to have the messaging program reinstalled. There had been a licensing issue, he recalled. Back when he'd started at the surgery. Something about privacy concerns. But maybe he could—maybe they could put a rush on it. The IT department. The
He stood up, brushing bits of grass and dirt off his trousers, then stooped to retrieve a backpack that one of the teens had discarded in the mad scramble to clear the area. He held it out.
John startled at the mention of his daughter. He stepped back, heart thudding wildly. "What time is it?"
As he approaches, the shaggy grey dog he'd seen earlier emerges from the open doors. It growls at the sight of him, then begins to bark.
Harry is at the desk, hunched over her aging laptop, typing. Based on the tense set of her shoulders and the force with which she strikes the keyboard, he finds it likely that she is, yet again, attempting conversation with the Abominable Brother.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment. Thought of Mycroft, calmly awaiting a bullet in the heart. There had never been any question. There had never been any choice to make. He had known it. Mycroft had known it. Had accepted it. Tried to make it easier, in his own way.
It had been uncomfortable, really. Embarrassing. No one—no one ever really wanted to know those kinds of details about their best mate.
The hotel room had been uncomfortably warm. Something wrong with the forced air. He had begun to sweat, standing there, listening to Sherlock lay it all out.
The vicar was speaking. He had a soft voice. It was difficult to hear him over the roar of the heater.
"Take your pick," he barked, lifting his drink and throwing it back, a too-big mouthful that burned terribly on its way down. "You'd left, and I went after you. I went after you and brought you back just to die."
Sherlock shuts the tailgate on his truck, looks towards John. His expression is difficult to read, and for a moment John thinks he might say something. But instead he turns and climbs into the front seat, starts his engine.
"Good," Sherlock said. He clapped his hands together. "Excellent. There's no need for additional detail."
Rosie's way. Always Rosie's way. Did he really dare attribute her indomitable will to Mycroft, of all people?
He went into the bathroom, turned on the shower, stepped in for a hasty wash. The water that pelted against his face and shoulders was cold, and he thought of Lazarus and his interrogation, the dark streak of drying blood that had oozed from beneath his tousled hair. He wondered what other injuries might have been hidden by the shadows.
He did not particularly want to continue the conversation. Bad enough he had to put up with—whatever it was that Sherlock and Janine were playing at. He had only just reconciled with Harry, after all, and he wasn't keen on lying to her more than he had to in order to keep Sherlock's secrets.
His voice was overloud in the heavy vacant quiet of the flat. He swallowed, suddenly conscious of the sound of his own breathing, his heartbeat in his chest.
John cleared his throat. "So you—?" He paused, looked down at his hands. The conversation he'd had with Mycroft in Baker Street felt surreal, distant. "Do you even
"Nothing's permanent, you know," John said, years later, as he stood regarding their boxed belongings. There was a tinge of melancholy in his voice.
He presses his lips together in something that might approximate a smile, looks up at the sky through the windshield. There are dark clouds on the horizon.
She would not go to Mycroft. It was the only thing he was certain of. Rosie took a certain pride in her independence, and asking him to house her would be a direct affront to her sensibilities. Nor would she simply return to university, not with so much unresolved.
He returned his attention to the window, studied the smears on the glass where countless travelers had pressed fingers and shoulders and heads.
"Then what do you want, John?" Sherlock asked again. He tried to smile, but thought it might have been a weak effort. "If not Mary. If not your life in Chelmsford. And if not this life, here."
"Can't you just—" John shrugged, looked helplessly at Sherlock, "—teach Janine here?" Even as he spoke, he regretted his words. He did not want to imagine Sherlock and Janine swaying together in the warm privacy of 221B. He knew the rapturous expression Sherlock wore on his face while dancing, and it would be all to easy to imagine it directed at her.
Except his door creaks open, and there is John's face in the moonlight, looking small and pale and unhappy.
"Look," John said, his mouth dry. He could not quite bring himself to meet Sherlock's eye. "If you don't actually want—"
Sherlock smiled again, an almost involuntary pull at the corner of his mouth. He liked John like this, sharp-tongued yet indulgent.
It was Moriarty's plans that were frightening, the certainty that his next great game would come with a cost Sherlock was unwilling to pay.
"Sherlock's always going on about—" he dropped his voice in a halfhearted impression "—'seeing but not observing' but. But I think. Yeah. I think sometimes you don't see anything at all because you just don't want to look."
"I know a thing or two about hasty decisions, you know," she said. She set a teacup down on the table with a bit more force than necessary. "And I'll admit that I'd hoped—well—"
He saw the moment she believed him, saw the way her expression shifted. Resignation, maybe. Regret. He thought about the way she'd smiled at him back at the surgery, that charming flirtatious demeanor. Her sparkling eyes, her good humour. Her interest. Wondered why it hadn't even occurred to him that it might be too good to be true.
"It wouldn't just be me," he'd said, and nodded towards Rosie, who was playing with a set of wooden blocks on the floor between them.
"Sorry," John said. "This isn't—I don't mean to just—look, the point is that she died, Harry. She died and I was fucking
He stood for a moment, struggling to tuck Rosie against his hip. She was growing fast, and the strain on his bad shoulder was enormous.
There was some of Mycroft in the way she read a room and then sat back, waiting for the people around her to trip over their words and reveal themselves.
John startled awake at the sound of loud voices in the hallway, jerking up from the scratched wooden surface of his desk. He blinked in the morning light, disoriented, his neck a stiff mess of knotted agony. The laptop he'd taken from work was open next to him, the screen dark.
John sat stunned for a moment, still shivering in spite of the heat pouring out of the vents. Then he opened his own door.
She set the papers down, looked over at John, caught his expression. She gave him a worried smile. He smiled back, and the motion pulled strangely at his face.
"I love you, you bastard," he said against Sherlock's lips. He did not know if Sherlock could hear him, could feel the words his mouth was forming. There were fine tremors running through Sherlock's body, an adrenaline spike, most likely. His hands were very cold. "I love you, and I'm sick of hating you for it."
"Ragwort," he'd announced, his expression at once bored and smug "It's a weed. Not common to bouquets. A bane to those who suffer from seasonal allergies—and I'd wager that the unfortunate Mr Teller did, indeed, have a severe reaction to the plant's pollen." He'd made a wide, sweeping gesture towards the corpse on the ground. "John?"
"Nice," John said, joining Sherlock at the mirror. He breathed out through his teeth. "The suit. It's nice."
He closed his eyes and was back in the Thames, sinking, gasping, his limbs leaden and frozen. John was behind him, harsh pants of breath against his ear as he swam, as he pulled them both backwards.
He rubbed at his face again, stood up. Groaned as his stomach took a moment to resettle itself. He went to the door and opened it.
"Very excited to get to know you," Evie said, taking his arm, tilting her head to look down at him. There was a bit of a predatory glint in her eye. "Sherlock was telling us about some of your cases over brunch."
"Never mind," Sherlock said. He reached out, hooked his fingers in John's belt loops, pulled him back in close. "You heard it."
He'd have to find a new sitter. It would be a bit of a struggle getting Rosie acclimated—she tended to be wary around strangers. And he'd have to find someone flexible, someone who understood the occasionally unpredictable nature of his work schedule.
"Good," he said, not quite sure how to respond. "That's—that must be something you're looking forward to, yeah? Put all of this behind you?"
The sitting room was dark, the only light coming from the corner lamp. Sherlock and Janine were sat on opposite ends of the sofa. They were both in pyjamas.
"I despise legwork, Sherlock. And since you insist on drawing parallels that do not necessarily exist, may I remind you that Rosamund's mother was never under my employ? She was a freelancer, a mercenary, someone our government—and others—contracted with to carry out specific tasks. She was tremendously talented, but for God's sake, any common buffoon can be trained up as an assassin. I've no need to conscript my niece for the task."
"Sherlock," John said, drawing to a halt. His voice emerged lower than he would have liked and he cleared his throat, squared his shoulders. It was hot, too hot. He should have taken off his coat. He should have thought this through. He should have left when he had the chance.
But now, there are furtive sounds coming from the other side of the gate. A scraping of keys, a muffled curse. And then the gate is lifting up, metal squealing against metal.
"It's possible the killer isn't someone who's been personally offended by the groom at all," Sherlock said. He stared at the wall over John's shoulder, his face at once thoughtful and closed off. "Maybe he's not taking revenge for ill treatment. Maybe thinks he's helping."
He thought about decomposition and microorganisms and gas, irregularities in the onset of rigor mortis, all of the common explanations for movement of a corpse after death. None of it fit. This was—
Of course this was tedious for Sherlock. He enjoyed acting, and he and Janine had clearly amused themselves playing their parts, but . . . in essence, they were doing the same things over and over and over again. And if John had been bored, then Sherlock—
Sherlock blinks, brings his hand up to his mouth. John follows the motion with his eyes, suddenly unable to think of anything but the way those lips had felt, soft against his own. The taste of Sherlock's mouth, the brush of his chilled nose, the puff of his warm breaths.
He carried her out of the room and back down the hall, paused to glance in at a small bathroom. It was unoccupied, undamaged. The bathtub and sink were dry. Rosie glimpsed herself in the mirror and gave a hiccuping sob.
He smiles as the letters appear. It is absurd, really, this desire to see Sherlock's odd half-finished invention working (at least partially) in the way he'd intended.
Sherlock cleared his throat, looked away. He seemed suddenly uncertain, regretful of hasty words in a way that he never used to be.
"That's what we're trying to avoid," John said. He let his hand fall away from Sherlock's neck. "In spite of your best efforts to the contrary."
The jutting, razor-sharp teeth affect a ferocious appearance, but they are considered a docile species.
So he'd brought it to the cottage. Had left it propped in a dusty corner of a forgotten bedroom, in the bolt-hole he'd never needed to use.
He threw back the blanket, sat up. His skin prickled. He reached for his cane, grimaced at the cold metal against his palm.
She turns her head to look at him. "My sister's dog. They've found a buyer for the farm—taking all of the sheep. But no one wants the dog. It's not his fault, the poor dear, but I can't blame anyone for not wanting to take him on. He's absolute rubbish at herding sheep."
Judging by John's preoccupation with the menus, he thought perhaps he may have agreed to dinner plans. Except, if that was all, then what was he meant to
They were both white metal. Platinum, he supposed. Simple designs, nothing ornate or fussy. One had rounded edges, much like his own wedding ring had been. The other was a flatter design with squared edges, more streamlined, modern.
"Um," John half-smiles, the expression bleeding into a wince. "Now, I apparently play a role for a while. There will be an accident? Or something. They were working through the details last night. I have some practice planning fake funerals, so—"
Sherlock passes a mildly entertaining afternoon at the morgue whipping a corpse in order to check for bruising patterns.
"Christ," John said, as they came to a rather violent stop at the side of the road. His heart was pounding. He looked at Sherlock, noted his white-knuckle grip on the steering wheel.
"No," John said, flashing a tight smile in her direction. He gestured towards the table. "Looks like the fun's just beginning."
And yet the air between them had curdled, slowly, in the days that followed. John was on edge but hiding it well, and seemed to resent Sherlock even intimating that he'd noticed something amiss.
Bluebell, he thought. Turned into a fairy and flew away into the night. A lie to cover up a painful truth.
"Oh?" the woman on his right (Gemma? He was fairly sure Lucy had called her Gemma) said, offering him a wide smile. "What a coincidence. I'm a single mum."
Though he knew that it was scientifically impossible, the thought warmed him. There had been a fire, that last Christmas at Baker Street, crackling and glowing in the fireplace. There had been green garland and fairy lights, and though he'd eschewed the reindeer antlers (Mrs Hudson occasionally had the most appalling ideas) he had allowed himself to be coaxed into playing Christmas songs on his violin.
He shut the door, turned back. Looked at the small bookshelf by the door. There were no photographs. He could not remember if John had ever kept photographs, before.
John staggered in his wake, feeling like all the air had been punched out of him. He put his hands on his knees, waited until his breathing had steadied.
They went out to look at crime scenes ("Your coat," he'd said, wonderingly, watching Sherlock slip into it at the foot of the stairs, and Sherlock had rolled his eyes and grumbled something about meddling siblings, but there had been no real venom in his voice), they ate dinner and argued about television choices. It was almost normal.
"All right," John said. There was a smile tugging at the edge of his mouth. He could not, for the life of him, quite say why. "I'll make it tonight."
"Well—a visit from Dr Love, to be specific." He tugged on the lapels of his lab coat, gave a little wiggle of his hips, raised his brows.
John opened his eyes to weak morning light filtered through the window glass, and could not recall when he'd fallen asleep.
He sat for a moment, drumming his fingers against his leg. Then he reached forward, turned on his computer.
"Just verifying the details," he says, and aims a smile in her direction. Perhaps a bit too many teeth; he sees John flinch in his periphery.
It had been almost a full year since he'd seen him, since he'd spoken to him, even, and still he was unable to banish Sherlock from his mind.
The cab stopped. Sherlock paid, then slipped out into the bitter cold. He burrowed his neck into the scratchy collar of his coat, shivered. Leaned against the nearest building and watched.
They come through the door into the sitting room, and Sherlock watches them. John is preoccupied with Rosie—she is telling him something in her sweet, charmingly garbled way. Whatever it is she is trying to convey is clearly important to her as she repeats it four times, her voice growing louder and more insistent each time. On the fifth, John laughs and lifts her up into the air, distracts her with an offer of breakfast.
He'd expected a miracle. He'd insisted on seeing Sherlock's body at the funeral. A part of him had been so certain, so sure that he would lift the lid and gaze down into unoccupied space. But Sherlock had been there. Dead. Dead and gone and far beyond the reach of any miracles.
"And then she died. She died thinking I was some kind of saint, and all of that—everything I'd been carrying around—it just—" John lifted his hands, let them fall helplessly to his sides. "I keep wondering how I got here. Yeah? I never wanted to be this person. But here I am."
"Mm," Sherlock said, stepping into the room, the steam warm against his skin. "It's been a terrible year. I think I deserve something sweet."
"He was grabbed from behind. First instinct would have been to lurch forward. John is strong, capable of holding his own in hand-to-hand combat. He'd have brought his attacker with him, over the back of the sofa. Shins hit the coffee table, flipping it onto its side. There will be bruising."
"I thought—" John stopped, shook his head. His mouth was curving up in a semblance of a smile, but it was not a happy expression. "Um. I talked to Lestrade. He said you'd gone back to London."
Molly turned away, sniffed hard, wiped the last of the tears from her eyes. She went out of the room into the hallway, crouched to check on the slumped attendant. He tipped his head up and blinked at her, dazed. John had blackened his eye.
Sherlock shakes his head. A lightning flash lights up the barn, briefly making him look ghost pale and washed out. Haunted.
"This was in your neck," Sherlock said. His voice was very quiet. He lifted something from the floor, pinched between his fingers. A dart.
gesture that might have been charming under different circumstances. "I don't want to see you in pain. I like you. I want—I
Most things usually were, of course. But this—three days of silence. The kind of silence that felt like the end of something that he'd had no idea carried an expiration date.
"Hen party tonight," she said unnecessarily. She sat down on the sofa next to John and he scooted over to give her room. She bent to fiddle with the strap on her shoes.
"Redbeard," Sherlock gasps, his face tipped up, his mouth close to John's ear. His pale eyes are wide open, unblinking, fixed on the storm. "I need to—"
Sherlock drew up short, surprised by the sight of her. He disliked feeling surprised. It had become all too common in recent years.
"—and so am I," John said. "You think you're a bad judge of character because you didn't see Mary for what she was. Well, neither did I. Neither did Sherlock-bloody-Holmes, the most observant man in the world."
Sherlock fumbled with something in his pocket. There was a soft snicking sound, and then a pressure at John's wrist. The plastic tie fell away. He freed John's other hand, then bent to work on his ankles.
"John," Sherlock says. It hurts to speak, for some reason. His throat feels closed up and raw. "No one would blame you for avoiding this place for the rest of your life. You have nothing to prove."
John did not seem relieved or unburdened by the news he had delivered. He did not look away from the fireplace. His hand clenched and relaxed at his side, rhythmic.
Sherlock paused the video, leaned back in his chair. His heartrate had accelerated. He folded his hands, pressed them against his lips.
He had not heard back from John since he'd sent the picture of Rosie in her ill-fated Christmas dress. Perhaps the skull had been a poor choice for set dressing. More likely, John had been pulled in to his interview and had not had a chance to respond.
He climbed into the bed anyway, pulled the blankets around himself. He was cold. His head ached. There would be an investigation. He would need to answer questions. They should not have let him leave the scene. Why had they let him leave the scene?
"Second date. Obvious. The first didn't exactly light your fire, but as it clearly wasn't an absolute disaster you felt obliged to try again. Not
He kept his right hand on the handle to Rosie's little pushchair, rocked it back and forth in a gentle motion. For the time being, Rosie seemed content, occasionally humming a little tune to herself. She smiled at the patients and staff that passed by. Most smiled back.
"He's lucky I'm the only one who got close enough to hit him. Pretty sure Sally's still nursing a grudge. And Anderson. And Molly, Christ, after the way he—" John stops, shakes his head. The memories are old, and unpleasant, but he cannot help himself. "We almost lost our grant that year."
Sherlock leaned forward, entirely focused on Hopkins. "The oyster card sticking out of your pocket."
He turned towards Sherlock, finally, dared to meet his gaze. Sherlock looked struck, eyes wide and damp and fixed on John.
) and though he'd secured rooms in central London at a deep discount from a grateful former client, he'd still come up a few hundred quid short on his first month's rent.  A flatshare would do quite nicely.
He thought about the last time he'd seen John, there at his grave. He'd almost spoken, then. Had almost given in to the strange twisting temptation to let himself be known.
"Yet you say you grew up in Chelmsford?" Edward asked. He took off his glasses, massaged the bridge of his nose.
After you fell. Jumped. Whatever. The papers called it a scandal. NSY cleaned house. Sacked a lot of people."
Mary puts her hand on John's arm again. This time her grip is quite firm. The little crowd around them is grumbling, clearly on Moriarty's side.
"Things often do." Sherlock had paused, studied him. "Oh—did you mean this Christmas in particular? A woman is dead. I imagine it can't get much worse than that. For her, at least."
Sherlock stared at him for a moment. He was unsure what he saw in Mycroft's face. It was unsettling, not to be able to read him.
"No, you're supposed to be on your way out of the country with a stolen horse," John grinds out against Sherlock's hand. He jerks his head out of Sherlock's grip.
They'd sat up well into the night, faces cast blue in the glow from Sherlock's screen as the texts rolled in. In his mind, Sherlock plotted a map of London, vivid rose-coloured dots wherever she had been spotted.
He dreamed in fits and starts, tangled threads that wrapped around him and held fast as he struggled. Moriarty with his gun and his smile. The spider between his lips. Molly on the sofa, her face pinched, her words ignored. Spiders, far too many of them, churning in the loose soil atop his own grave.
"Hanging on to it, just in case?" John continued. "Never know when you might need to get fake engaged again. Third time's the charm, right?"
"I know," he murmured, pressed a kiss to the side of her head. "Just going to make sure everything's all right. Then we'll go home."
"Her name is April," Mary said. "And she's not timid, she's just nervous around you because you shouted at her last week."
Lazarus had not told him where he could find the phone. He was at a bit of a loss as to where to even begin looking.
"What the hell do you think I'm trying to do?" John is nearly shouting. He catches himself, shuts his eyes, takes a deep breath. "The whole time, Sherlock. The whole time. You were there. It wasn't just grief. It was—it was just that, even gone, even
He wondered where Sherlock was—if he'd been brought back to London to recover, or if he was being treated elsewhere.
"No," John said, and the twist of Sherlock's stricken face had him shaking his head. "No, I mean don't apologise—yes. I'm trying to say yes. Of course, yes. Of course."
"Ah," Mycroft said. His tone was smug, but there was an undercurrent of weariness. "I should have known this would be about Dr Watson. And how
"—will be expected to use a portion of her allowance to procure a replacement," Sherlock said. She had hurled it against the wall. There had been an impressive strength in that throw. She had already proven herself an above-average talent in sport. Among other things.
" Sherlock snarled into the phone, and then his legs gave out and he fell backwards into his chair, still struggling for breath.
The woman gives a gentle tug on the leash, and she and the dog step into the crosswalk. John and Rosie watch them go.
He had gone to see Musgrave Hall only once, less than a year after the incident with Eurus and Sherrinford. He'd stood in the tall grass and looked at the burnt husk that had cast its shadow over him for years of his life.
"You could have had exactly what you wanted," Mycroft continued, and his voice had pitched up high, knowing,
There had been no response. John could not help but picture Sherlock's bewildered face, his furrowed brow, his thunderous frown.
Sherlock's gaze flicked down to John's lips, then back up. It was quick, fleeting. "John," he said, his voice pained.
And he'd hung up and breathed out hard, suddenly relieved that he wouldn't need to go through the motions of decorating his quiet little house, putting up a tree, making a fuss about it for Rosie's sake. Christmas had rather lost its lustre, over the years.
Their laughter trails off slowly, leaving him warm and flushed and entirely uncertain what comes next.
Allie shrugged. "Who the hell knows? I was—around—a lot. My parents have been fighting. A lot. Lately. So I've been spending a lot of time there. We're close, Jimmy and I. Maybe he just thought—"
"I’m sorry," Molly said. Her voice was grave, as if someone had died. She looked as if she wanted to cry.
"Mary was my friend," Janine said, breaking the silence that had fallen. "Actually my friend. I want you to know that."
"I don't—" John swallowed again, shook his head. "I haven't seen Evan Bell in years. He. He died. He—" he cut himself off, forced himself to look at the man in front of him.
It was a nice party. He was having a nice time. It was surprising. He had not expected to have a good time. He'd been—worried. About things.
John's lips, soft and firm and damp against his. He could taste John's breath, wanted to inhale him, to draw him in and never release another breath of his own.
"She wanted to make sure I was—" John said, and stopped. "Um. I believe her exact words, both times, were
Sherlock cuts him off with a wave of his hand. "It doesn't matter. Everything you did after that point is entirely irrelevant. All that matters is that
It was a startled sound, but genuine. And his grip tightened again on Sherlock's shoulders and he leaned up to kiss the sneer from his face.
It was an idiotic thing to say. It hadn't been luck, it had been John. John, who he hadn't so much as glimpsed through the ambulance doors, who had not been there as the EMTs fussed over him and rubbed him down and tried to bring his body temperature back up.
"You drove her off," John said. "Haven't you deduced that much? You know I had a ring with me the night that you—that night. At the Landmark. You ruined it, you made her leave."
"Mm," Sherlock agreed. "You have your uses." His voice was casual. Dismissive. He stood up from the bench. His coat flared out behind him.
There was a warm surge of fondness in his chest. He smiled, shut his eyes, thought about Janine saying
"Sherlock," John hissed. He tipped his head back, looked up at the grey sky as if seeking guidance from some higher power. Pinched his nose. Looked back at the woman. "Sorry," he said. "Sorry. He—he does that."
that had come after, things he might not have forgiven (certainly would not have forgiven) under different circumstances had it not been for the fact that Mary had once looked at him under streetlamps—blood on his face and red-rimmed heartbreak in his eyes—and had offered him a kind smile, had said
He was alone. He shifted in place, reached out to rest a hand on the empty space beside him. The sheets were still warm to the touch. He'd not been alone for long.
It was as if all of the air had gone out of her. Her face went white, her shoulders slumped, her eyes slipped shut.
"Yeah, I'm going," he says, and opens the door. There is an earthen smell hanging in the air—damp soil and corn, a distant whiff of cows. He breathes it in, closes his eyes.
The most likely scenario was that John, having concluded his successful interview by mid-afternoon, had looked at the weather forecast and had elected to remain safely in Bristol for another night. A prudent course of action, especially considering he had a child in tow.
"The little one looks so lovely in her dress," she said, and her voice was tremulous enough to make John wonder if she'd started in on the refreshments before he'd joined her.
Sherlock stared at him, at his eyes, gleaming bright in the television glow. At his face, expressive and endearing and so very dear to him.
"I give you all the Storm Spider," Moriarty says, and his gaze slides towards John, his smile widening into something uncomfortably knowing. "It may not look like much, but believe me, it's the first of its kind. Inside are hundreds of tiny sensors that are designed to be released up into the tornado. From there, they'll transmit back invaluable data on wind speed, air flow, rotation; spinning a beautiful web of information for us to study—"
Sherlock studied him for a long moment, then shifted his attention back to the book in front of him.
Sherlock looked at him, his face strange and searching. He followed John down the hall to his room, let out a heavy huff of breath that almost sounded like a laugh when John stopped at the door.
And for a time, Sherlock had seemed so terribly ordinary, and that had only made him more vulnerable in Mycroft’s eyes. He’d found himself happy to step up to the task, to keep his vow. He took his oath seriously. He would not break his word.
It was ultimately too lighthearted, and totally didn’t fit the tone of the scene, so I cut it and reworked the conversation. John still mentions the Borgia pearl, but it goes no further than that. At this point in the story, John and Sherlock are still failing to communicate properly, and pushing those heavier issues aside to have them banter over a fun case wouldn't have worked out (as much as I enjoyed the banter.)
John looked at him, at the tension in his shoulders, the careful blankness of his expression. At his hands, still clenched on the wheel, crisscrossed with thin lines of dried blood.
"Utterly bladdered, yeah," she said. She laughed a little, shook her head. "It was fecking perfect—he came stumbling in and made a scene, accusing me of wanting to cheat on him before the wedding. It couldn't have gone any better if we'd planned it."
Other papers and internet sites were quick to catch on, speculating that one woman would never be enough to satisfy the voracious appetite of London's favourite consulting detective.
A new employee. Someone working behind a desk—ticket sales or gift shop? Or perhaps even someone on the maintenance or janitorial staff. That might allow for off-hours access.
"Christ, I'm tired," John says, breaking the silence that has stretched between them. He moves towards the sofa.
John sat at the edge of his bed, looked at Rosie in her cot. Listened to Sherlock's footsteps thud down the stairs. Waited for the slam of the front door.
The window on the far wall was wide open, curtains billowing in an icy breeze. Sherlock went towards it, glanced out at the fire escape. It was empty. He peered down into the shadows at the ground below. Nothing stirred.
Water in his nose, his eyes. He sputtered, forced his eyes open. His legs kicked stiffly, much too slowly to do any good. He could not feel his fingers. His arms felt distant and heavy.
Sherlock goes into his room, changes his shirt. Then he hesitates, listening through the thin door. Splashing. Giggling. It makes him ache, that sound. He does not quite know why.
John shook his head, but there was a smile curling at the corner of his mouth. An exasperated smile, at once disapproving and terribly fond.
And now John was gone. Really gone, this time. Not coming back. No more cases, no more takeaway and crap telly, no more
If Mrs Hudson looked out her window, she would not be able to miss him. Or if John came around back with rubbish for the bins, like he did sometimes—
Moriarty had smiled at her, a smitten, sappy little smile, and the back of John's neck had prickled in alarm because his eyes—his
He plugged in the phone to charge, sat down on the aging leather sofa, looked down at his own hands. Hands that had once served a purpose. Hands that had healed people, hurt people, offered comfort and strength.
Blood roared in his ears as he looked at the photograph, the unmistakable face, those unforgettable eyes.
been trying to get Sherlock to be more cooperative with others, he should be happy that it finally took. It shouldn't matter that something about Moriarty made his skin crawl, that there was something off about him that Sherlock—Sherlock, who saw everything—simply refused to see.
"I, um. Should go," John said. His voice was reluctant, a little regretful. "Only. I promised Molly I'd be there by two."
"Selfish, you said," Sherlock presses on. "For telling me you don't want to leave. You felt it was selfish of you to express that, when we were in agreement that you'd have to go."
"Oh, Sherlock," she said. She petted at his hair in a way clearly meant to be soothing. It was not particularly soothing to him, but it seemed to comfort her, so he allowed it to continue.
John crushed the lapels of Sherlock's suit jacket in his hand, tugged him forward. Their mouths bumped together, Sherlock slightly off-balance. He quickly regained his footing and groaned, melting against John.
Sherlock watched John watching her as she walked across the stage in her regalia. John's eyes were damp, red-rimmed.
He looked over towards Sherlock. He'd shifted so that Rosie was facing away from the wall, was bouncing her absently on his hip. Mollified, John returned his attention to the photographs.
After Sherlock had stepped off the roof at Barts, Mrs Hudson had cleaned the kitchen, had thrown away stray bits of human remains, had cleared off the flasks and beakers, had boxed up the microscope and assorted paraphernalia.
His eyes burned. He braced himself against the counter, pressed his hand to his face. Breathed. He could not recall the last time he had felt so utterly, miserably alone.
"It can't continue," Sherlock says quietly. He looks down at the ground. There are so many things that he wants. Things he should not want. Things he cannot have. It is best to put an end to this now, before it gets worse. Before he finds himself unable to let go.
"And loads of people photographed them making up," John said. He'd seen the pictures. And the headlines, which were both lurid and startlingly creative. None of it had really captured the full experience.
"I didn't want you to come back," he said through his teeth. "Is that what you wanted to hear me say?"
It strikes him that he has wanted to do this for a very long time—simply to hold Sherlock for the sake of holding him. To love Sherlock for the sake of loving him.
Silence fell, heavy and grim. The air was very cold. John was overly aware of his own heartbeat, the throb of his pulse in his veins, the rasp of his own breath in his throat. He was not wearing a coat. He could not feel his fingers.
"Just, I always thought you were making a mistake. Marrying her. That you were rushing into something without really thinking it through. And I—we just—we weren't close enough for me to want to be the one to tell you that." She breathed out, a wet sound, and he realised with a pang that she was crying. "And then she died, and it felt weird to show up at the funeral when I hadn't—it just—it was easier not to mention it. Yeah?"
He'd rolled his eyes. "If it's any consolation, you lasted far longer than I expected. I assumed you'd be clamouring to return to London life within a year. Early retirement doesn't suit you."
He startled. John was craning his neck to look over his shoulder. He had asked a question. About the funeral. Wiggins. Right.
"Molly was lucky," John said. "That's what you're thinking about, isn't it? The tissue damage was extensive, but it could have been a lot worse. She caught it in time."
John frowns at him. Swallows. "It's just. We—we both agree. We're both in agreement. That I'll have to go. That this isn't working, that trying to live the way that we do here with a toddler underfoot isn't—isn't good. For any of us. And for me to acknowledge that, all of the things you've been trying to tell me, and in the next breath tell you that I don't want to go is—erm—well, selfish. Of me."
and left this terrible quiet place behind. There is no real reason for him to be here. He is only here because he did not want to go home, because he did not want to face John, did not want to share the flat with John's sadness and poisoned memories of this place, and yet—
"Because the thought of watching you marry someone else makes me sick," John said. He dug his fingernails into the meat of his palm. Anger bubbled hot and violent in his chest, threatening to rip free, to spill out into the quiet darkness of the kitchen where he could no longer take it back. "And I don't care that it's fake, I don't care that Janine was the perfect choice for this—and she was, I
"I know," John says, and then he is not so much sagging as crumpling, his keys dangling useless from his left hand. He puts his head against the cracked black paint of their front door and takes a deep breath, the proud, rigid line of his shoulders rising and falling. "All right? I know. I know that it can't continue. I knew it even before you said it last night."
"Well. You already knew that, I guess. But I—I'm glad you're not dead. You, um. Always made me feel alive. So."
John looked at the door, back at Sherlock. His breath steamed in the cold afternoon air. He looked a bit amused and a bit irritated, all at once.
A controlled fall, he'd told her. Perfectly safe. All she had to do was provide the decoy, forge a few papers. She could do that, yeah?
He supposed he did look rather ghastly. A living corpse, still bloodstained and damp from the rain-soaked pavement. Startlingly out of place even amidst the refrigerated bodies and chilled surgical steel of the morgue.
He wonders if Sherlock knew. And then he thinks of Sherlock's face, that night, the shocked frozen devastation in his expression. Thinks of all that came after.
"Sherlock," John says. His shoulders are hunched against the wind. "Mary and I talked last night. After."
"That is what they're for," John agreed. He stood at the kitchen sink, rinsing dishes in hot, soapy water, phone pinched awkwardly between his shoulder and ear. Behind him, Rosie was sat comfortably in the sitting room, babbling streams of semi-intelligible nonsense to a line of stuffed animals.
Sherlock turned to look at him, narrowed his eyes. John offered up a shrug and a small smirking twist of his lips.
"Yes," John said. He cleared his throat, looked at his daughter, smiled at her furrowed brow. "This is Rosamund. Well. Rosie."
A rustle and a thump from Rosie's room, a muted whimper that escalated into a guttural wail, a choking sobbing scream for
The dog does not follow him inside. Instead it sits down on its haunches just outside the door. It barks once more, a sharp, almost offended sound.
He shook his head again, went to the door. Let himself out. The evening air was cool against his flushed cheeks.
"You stole the body," Sherlock says, eyeing Todd. There is always some guesswork involved, regardless of what he admits to anyone else, but the man in front of him is an open book. He reeks of failure and a sort of flailing, desperately entitled confidence. "While inebriated. You'd not have thought to do it on your own, so it was likely at the urging of someone else—" he pauses as the pieces click into place, aims an irritated look in John's direction. "A lover. You'd been using the laboratory for your liaisons—did it give you a bit of a thrill, the fear of being caught? You were intoxicated, certainly, and possibly under the influence of something stronger—been experimenting a bit with class A substances, yes?—and you both thought it would be
"The suspect," John said. "Allie Turner's friend." He made a little frustrated noise, crushed the napkin he was holding in his hand. "For God's sake—the person whose name we're trying to clear."
Sherlock convulsing on an operating table hadn't done it. The unfamiliar, chilling expression on Mary's face as she'd hollowed out a coin with terrifying accuracy hadn't done it.
John and Mary are standing together. They are looking at the plane, and neither turns at Sherlock's approach. There is a man in a black suit with them, a CIA agent, no doubt. Sherlock is irrationally glad it is not the man he remembers from the Adler case.
John picked up the phone and looked at it. There were photographs, old text messages. He scrolled through them, bemused.
They left the police in charge of the scene, drove back to Baker Street in Mrs Hudson's incredible, improbable car.
The dog eyed him. He looked away, back up at Vivian. She was eyeing him too. Perhaps he hadn't done the best job keeping the dismay out of his voice.
A memorial of sorts, four days too late. It would, he'd thought while purchasing the train ticket, feel like turning a corner.
"Don't be sorry," she said, and she looked at him. Her face was earnest, a little flushed from the wine. Her eyes were quite sad. "Don't be sorry."
"Christ," John said, staring up at the ceiling. "You came back from the bloody dead. What's an hour on the train?"
John was sitting cross-legged on the floor next to Rosie, who was carefully and determinedly inspecting several brightly wrapped boxes. He glanced up and smiled, an awkward, crooked grin.
It had been enough to send Sherlock careening to his feet, craning his neck to see over John’s shoulder.
"You are here," Sherlock says. He lets his hand drop, his palm warm through the fabric of John's shirt.
and he'd stumbled from his barstool and back out into the night. He'd walked home with his hands in his pockets, his gaze firmly fixed on the ground in front of him.
Sherlock had looked up at that, frowning. Under the laboratory's fluorescent lights, his eyes had looked almost colorless. "What?"
"You know I prefer to text," Sherlock said, absent, looking around at the trees, the overlong grass.
He thought of the way things had been between them since Mary died. The months of angry silence, culminating in something John still did not like to think about. Something ugly, something monstrous. The pair of them, battered and broken in different ways—John lashing out, Sherlock taking on.
Sherlock brought his left hand up to cup Janine's face as they kissed. The band stood out starkly against his pale skin. John could not take his eyes off of it.
"He doesn't do parties," John said. He was unable to stop staring. If he'd known there'd been even a
"I spent this morning selling you out to the highest bidder," Mycroft had said. He'd given a thin smile, had taken another pull on his cigarette.
John clenched his fist at his side, pressed it hard against his thigh. Stared at Sherlock's back. His dark hair had dried in unruly tangles. It was quiet outside the car. He could not remember the last time he'd heard the wind.
"Dance lessons," Janine said. She grinned, leaned forward with her elbows on her knees, her eyes sparkling.
"Shit," Harry said. She looked like she wanted to laugh. She restrained herself. He could not quite bring himself to feel grateful.
"The first time I pulled a needle out of your arm?" Mycroft's voice shook with barely restrained anger.
There was a distinct possibility that Lazarus could die, alone and injured and frightened, trembling with fever, far from home and without a friend by his side.
"Body odour," Sherlock said. He rolled his eyes. "Oh, don't be dull. It's not yours. The scent's mingled with a fading cologne, masculine scent, clearly a poor attempt to disguise the problem. Concentrated here—" he tapped her left shoulder. "Indicating you were pressed against someone with an arm raised for an extended period of time. You've a strand of blonde hair here—" he lifted a gossamer coil of hair from her right shoulder, held it up to the light. His speech sped up, interest caught seemingly in spite of himself. "Clearly not yours. Snagged on your coat collar. A dusting of bronze powder here on your right sleeve—not your shade. You spent an extended time in close quarters with a smelly man on your left and a blonde woman rather sloppily applying makeup on your right. There are arguably very few circumstances under which those conditions would be acceptable. The fact that you did not simply stand up and move to a new location indicates confinement. You didn't leave because you
" John's voice flips from irritated to concerned. He approaches, and his right hand (cool and steady) presses against Sherlock's face, searching, prodding. "What happened to you? Is this your blood?"
He hesitated over a photo of Janine and Pete, leaning against the bar, clinking glasses in a toast. They were both drinking something violently pink, and the neon sign behind them cast their skin in a pink glow. Janine's smile seemed a shade more genuine than it had in the earlier shots.
John does not have it in him to respond to that. He focuses on the horse, on the case, because that he knows how to do, there is a rhythm to that, a comfortable give-and-take that he's had disturbingly little trouble falling back into. "He was going to keep Silver Blaze in the Wexell Cup. He was going to run him lame."
"It wasn't," John gasped, and the words sounded like they were being torn from his chest. "I wanted it to be fine. We all
"Pink roses," Sherlock said, looking crisp and haughty and far too posh for his own good. "Long-stemmed. Thorns removed please, I'll not have the day ruined by an unexpected prick." He clicked the 'k' and folded his hands primly in front of him.
"Ooh, I'd love to," Janine said, preening a bit under the attention. As she went towards Pete, she glanced over her shoulder and raised her eyebrow at Sherlock. He responded with an exaggerated eye roll.
Sherlock shook his head, waved the memory away. A poor example. His own error. It was true that he generally wasn't bothered about names, but he
Christ, he was reaching. The comment was not particularly warm, but she wasn't exactly celebrating the bloke's death, either.
"Something like that," John says. He clears his throat, looks down at the laptop. His face is lit by a faint blue glow as he begins to read. "'My big brother Eddie told me that they feed bad children to the sharks at the London Aquarium.'"
The overhead light in the showers was on the verge of burning out. It flickered and buzzed, cast uneven shadows on the stained tile.
She started to speak. He ignored her, struggled into his coat as he hurried down the hallway towards the front door.
Sherlock has not moved. He is holding himself very still, staring intently at the radar dish. It seems unreasonable to think that he has not heard the commotion. He is almost certainly aware of John, now, though he does not appear inclined to do anything about it.
If left to his own devices, he is likely to choose Mary's polar opposite. Someone safe and predictable and dull. Someone with no interesting secrets to uncover. Someone doting and sweet and so entirely devoid of personality that he'll be able to slide into a relationship without needing to
And then it was ringing, echoing somewhere in the hallway, and she could have cried with relief as the attendant bustled through the doors with a stretcher, the one with the squeaky wheel. There was a corpse on it, covered with a white sheet, phone trilling persistently in its pocket.
He looked towards the street, intending to flag down a taxi. It was cold, and Rosie was tired. He needed to get her home to bed.
He dropped the soiled nappy into the bin, went over to the window. It was open, just slightly, enough to let in an icy breeze.
After she has fled back towards the main house, John stands with Sherlock in the cramped little barn, listening to the rain batter the roof.
"Everything's fine," John said, and he was laughing now, a slightly hysterical high-pitched giggle that he was sure sounded a bit insane. "I've just been—well—I've been very stupid. Best of luck finding someone to fill the position. And—well. Happy New Year."
John looked down, his face hot. He cleared his throat. Nodded. He wanted to know all of it. What Sherlock had done while he was away. What had happened to Sherlock over the course of the last year that had turned him into someone who accepted invitations to pub nights, who went on dates.
"Saw you on the telly this morning," he said. He dropped the unopened newspaper down onto the coffee table. "And you've made the papers, apparently."
"Let's—" John said, leaning back, shutting his eyes as Sherlock chased his mouth. He put a gentle hand on Sherlock's chest, pushed lightly. "We should—"
"No need to resort to violence," John said. He went into the kitchen, rummaged around for the menus. "Chinese all right?"
John spares a glance at the bed of the truck, at Redbeard, but there is no time, no chance to do anything now except hold on as the funnel bears down.
Stumbling home late, hair hanging in her face, voice slurred: "Always liked Clara more than me, the bastard."
John blinked, lifted his head and stared across the room at the unruly mob of children. He sniffed, looked back down at the phone.
"Oh, right. That makes sense. Because, yeah, you know. Scotland Yard is quite well-known for consulting amateurs."
"Talked to your mum last night," he told her quietly as he fetched eggs out of the fridge, a frying pan out of the cabinet.
But it needn't be muffled or quiet, would it? They had no reason to think that he was just outside. No reason to think they weren't alone.
He left the sitting room, went out into the hallway. Paused by the stairs and looked up, imagined he could hear the familiar creaking of John's footsteps overhead.
He cannot make his feet move so he settles for turning away, his back to the plane. He hears the engines begin to whine and his breath stutters in his chest. His eyes are stinging. It must be the wind. He shuts them, takes a breath, then another.
"Sorry, just looking for the groom," John said, plastering a smile on his face. "Think he's got cold feet. Trying to talk him down, you know how it is. He's—erm—tall. Dark hair. Shockingly unfriendly. Have you seen him?"
There was a little newsstand between the Tube station and the surgery where John occasionally worked, and he stopped to pick himself up a paper and a cup of coffee.
The ground was cold, damp. The brick was wet and uncomfortable against his back, the chilled metal of the skip sharp against his shoulder. Sherlock was startlingly heavy and warm against him. Hot, humid breath puffed against John's hand, slowing, calming.
"West!" She calls back. "Near Billings. NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up to 30 miles on the dryline!"
Lestrade paused. "It's—" his face fell. "None of this was real, was it? You're not actually married."
He stared down at his phone, his fingers growing numb, icy rain slipping down the neck of his coat. He shivered. He could not recall ever missing a person so much it felt like a physical ache. Only ever Sherlock. Now and—before.
There was nothing left to be done but tune her out. He leaned his head back against his chair and dropped the bag of frozen peas back onto his face. Shut his eyes.
"Lynn Straker," she says. She has a firm handshake and her cheeks are ruddy and wind burnt. She has a warm smile, and something in him thaws at the sight of it. "You can have your pick of rooms. We've only got one other guest tonight."
"Fantastic," John said. He rubbed at his wrists. His fingers had started to tingle as the blood rushed back.
Her friends. It had to be one of her friends. An ex, perhaps. Or someone with a crush. Someone who felt the man she'd chosen to spend her life with was undeserving of her affections.
"I don't think she likes me much," Janine said. "Mrs Hudson. Seemed a bit scandalised this morning. Probably hasn't forgiven me for last time, with the papers."
He pressed his lips together, breathed through his nose. Sherlock looked back at him, wide-eyed, innocent. The champagne bottle had begun to sweat in his hand, condensation running down the neck and beading up against his long fingers.
"It'll be more than just the shops, you know," John said when they drew, reluctantly, apart. "You might have caught a killer, and Janine might be getting rich—again—off this whole scheme, but your public image is bound to take a hit. The press is going to paint you as an absolute bastard"
He pulled back before he could lose himself in analyzing the sensation, before his clumsy motions could betray his woeful lack of experience. His entire body shook, a fine tremble that he could not seem to stifle. John's breath puffed warm against his lips, mildly stale.
It made him feel terribly old, that regret. He had not always been so at the mercy of his transport. Now it was always there, clamouring for attention despite his best efforts to ignore it.
"Look, something’s come up," he said, cutting her off. "I'm not going to be able to make it tonight. Sorry. For the short notice. I hope it's not too inconvenient."
It had been a simple ring. Gold. Rounded edges. Nothing flashy or particularly eye-catching. He'd liked the design. It had suited him.
The man inclined his head, indicating that John should climb in beside him. John folded his arms across his chest, stood his ground.
"I'm sorry!" Sarah lifted her hand, pinched the bridge of her nose with her index finger and thumb. She looked very unhappy, now, and more than a bit embarrassed. "I thought you felt the same way. We didn't get on at all! It was—well, it was all a bit of a slog, wasn't it?"
"It never occurred to me," he said, speaking slowly, looking down into his mug as he spoke, "that I might be happy here."
John walked. He re-familiarized himself with London streets he'd been navigating on autopilot for years. He marveled at his legs, steady and strong beneath him.
His thoughts derailed as he caught sight of a familiar figure with his back against the bar, standing amidst the crowd and yet still somehow apart from it.
He is tired, and hungry, and aching in a way that is not really physical, in a way that never seems to ease. He regrets leaving Grimpen Village and the Cross Keys Inn behind. He regrets having left London at all.
my family. All right? I'm sorry that I've made you doubt that. I'm so fucking sorry. I wish I could take that back. There are so many things I wish I could do differently. So many things. I'm so—"
There was a woman sitting in Sherlock's chair, watching his entrance with an amused expression. She was striking—pale skin and upswept dark hair and red lips. And she was entirely naked.
He'd had no sentimental attachment whatsoever to his old Montague Street flat, would have sneered at anyone who so much as suggested that one could feel
"Right," John says again. "That would be due to the, erm, substance abuse and poor impulse control."
"Of course it was," Sherlock says. He pauses, and takes a sip from his glass. John watches his Adam's apple bob up and down. "Doesn't mean it was wrong."
The voice startled him. It was deep and sounded surprisingly close, as if the man were right on top of the microphone. "Wait."
He’d felt foolish, shamed by his own childish confidence, the unwavering certainty he’d carried that John would be happy to see him. He’d never doubted it, not once, he’d observed John in his grief and had accepted his loyalty as a simple, unassailable fact.
Sherlock should leave, he knew. He should stand up and get his coat and save them both the embarrassment, should go out into the London night and walk off his own selfish regret. He could return when it became obvious that no such conversation would be necessary, message sent and received, case closed.
On the floor, Rosie was sprawled amidst the detritus of Christmas. She'd exhausted herself amongst the paper and toys, and had fallen asleep in a shaft of sunlight without ever settling on any one thing to play with.
He was lying, of course, there was plenty of time for boredom, there were hours and days and weeks of desperate, mind-numbing boredom, stretches of time where nothing much happened at all; there were miles and miles of cornfields and blue skies and nights passed in cheap motels where the television signal was patchy and the Wi-Fi nonexistent. There were times when John feared Sherlock might combust from the boredom of it all, that he might burn up and fly apart like ashes on the wind.
John shook his head, kissed him again. Shivered as Sherlock's hands skated up under his shirt, ghosted across his skin.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, made sure John saw him doing it. Took off his coat with an exaggeratedly slow motion, hung it on the peg by the door. Rosie's peg was still empty.
Sherlock was silent for a long moment. He stared out towards the rubble that had once been his childhood home. One stone wall remained, defiant.
"Oh, don't worry. I'm in the habit of collecting secrets, not divulging them. It was a bit of a shock, you know, hearing he'd gone out like that," she said. Her voice softened into something contemplative. "It's my experience that men like Sherlock Holmes don't tend to live very long—far too reckless, if you know what I mean. But something never quite felt right about the way he did it. I
"Dog," Rosie says, and tugs on his hand, and then, when he doesn't immediately react, she tugs and twists with increasing desperation. "Dog, dog, Daddy,
He had other contacts. Others who could help him. But none as reliable as Wiggins. None who would prioritize Rosie above all else the way Wiggins had.
She had not seemed particularly bothered by Sherlock's behaviour all day, shrugging it off easily between each dramatically staged and rapidly escalating argument. Of course, she'd have known it was coming. Yet John doubted there was really any way one could ever truly prepare for such a thing. He'd seen Sherlock in action before, had seen him slip into and out of roles like changing costumes, and even he had been a bit surprised by the . . . vehemence of it all.
He wished he'd sent that message to Sherlock. He wished he'd written it down, all of it, everything he'd ever wanted to say. He'd chickened out, he'd fucked it up, all of it, and he regretted all of the chances he'd failed to take to make things right.
"I think we're past the point of polite lies, John. Don't you?" Sherlock said, not unkindly, that sad smile still on his lips. "You can't even bear to be in the same room as me. Unsurprising. I
John stepped back slightly, tilted his head so that he was looking straight into Sherlock's eyes. His face was flushed, his lips swollen, his eyes dark and damp. He smiled, a small thing, but genuine. Shut his eyes. Nodded once, a short, sharp little movement.
It broke over him like a wave of icy riverwater and he lurched back to his feet, bolted into the kitchen. Snatched his phone up from the table.
Sherlock shut his eyes, then forced them open. He kept his face blank, impassive. He stared at the back of John's head and thought about sliding his fingers through the short coarse hairs there.
He sat down on his bed, put his head in his hands. Did not answer. He could seek out all the drugs he wanted, but there would be no escape from this.
She moved towards him, but he waved her off, gripping the edge of a table to keep himself upright. He closed his eyes, sucked in air through clenched teeth.
Christ, if he could only go back in time. If he could only go back to that day, that terrible day that hadn't felt momentous at all at the time, if he could only go back to that moment in the sitting room at Baker Street, if he could only—
"No," John said. He huffed out a little laugh, looked as if he were about to say more but thought better of it.
you don't need confirmation," Sherlock said. He flashed a tight, insincere smile, looked towards the door.
He thinks he might be sick with it, this terrible muddle of anger and want. He has wanted for so very long.
"Why aren't you surprised?" Sherlock demanded, shocked that he could have missed this, that it could have possibly slipped under his radar. How had John seen it, when he hadn't? And why hadn't John stopped it?
There had never been any fear in Mary's eyes. She'd been surprised, certainly. But not afraid. And she hadn't been afraid, hadn't had any
"You never said such sweet things about me," Moriarty said, his face crumpling into a pout. His eyes were fathomless pits, dark and impossible to read.
"What kind of person steals a cadaver as a prank?" John asks. He takes the flannel from Sherlock's hand.
It stuns him, from time to time, just how much he misses Sherlock. The shock of his death has faded. John has a life, he has a relationship, and he is settled. And yet, every once in a while, something comes along and cuts his legs right out from under him. It takes his breath away.
"Private theatre," John said. He shook his head, scoffed. "Of course he'd have a bloody private theatre."
The photographer had not yet begun to edit or cull out the best shots, and there were hundreds to sort through. It was almost as good as video.
He carried her closer so she could see, careful to keep far enough away that she could not reach the delicate strands of lights with her straining hands.
Lestrade! She'd never let him see her before getting it touched up. The killer was someone she felt comfortable with, someone she wasn't afraid to let see the unsavoury bits."
He moved to set the painting back down on the floor. John settled a warm hand on his wrist, stopped him. Gingerly took the canvas from his hands, held it up. Frowned.
He had to stop. He had to stop doing that. It had been—it had been months. The better part of a year, at this point. He was Sherlock Holmes and he worked alone, and if he sometimes made too much noise late at night to lure his landlady upstairs because without her there the silence was far too loud and he couldn't seem to stay settled (he took no joy in being alone anymore, he simply paced and paced and drifted about the place like a bewildered ghost, ping-ponging off the furniture), then that was his business and his alone.
"Grown tired of pestering the nurses and have instead elected to inflict yourself on me?" Mycroft's voice was bored, drawling. "I'm delighted, truly, but—"
He could text. Later. Just to check in. Or perhaps email. Less intrusive, email. Not as urgent. John could ignore it, if he wanted. Well, he could ignore a text, too. But there was a certain intimacy to texts. They'd texted quite a lot, back when—back when they'd been friends. Best to tread carefully.
"You didn't regret that," Sherlock says, his voice low and wondering. "The last time I—the time we—" he shakes his head, blinks. "You didn't regret it."
"The last few years have instilled a sort of natural caution," Sherlock said. Then he smiled, a small, crooked thing. "I had to be sure you weren't a complete idiot."
Silence fell between them. He wondered why she was still there, why she hadn't decided he was horribly rude and unreceptive to her charms.
Sherlock said, his face close, so close that John would have been able to taste his breath if he'd really been there.
Sherlock's eyes had gone quite wide, his face pale. He looked stricken, horror-struck, terrified in a way that made John's skin crawl, made him want to look over his shoulder to verify that there was nothing lurking just there in the shadows, ready to pounce.
Sherlock crept closer, eased himself down into his own chair. It was solid and familiar beneath him.
Perhaps the sigh had been overly theatric. Well. He was entitled to a bit of drama now and again, was he not?
As they reached the landing, Sherlock bumped their shoulders together, a tentative hand snaking out to capture John's own.
Sarah's door was closed, thank God for small favours. He slipped by without making too much noise, went down the hallway to his little office. He hung up his coat, propped his cane against the corner of his desk, sat down. The aging wheeled chair creaked and he leaned back, stared at the bland painting of trees that Sarah had insisted on hanging up.
The one John has pinned against the wall is clearly the medical student. A quick glance tells Sherlock everything he needs to know (deeply in debt, borderline alcoholic, poor academic performance, flirtation with class A substances, string of meaningless lovers), and so he directs further attention to the nervous one by the door, the one answering to Alan.
He went to the door. Rosie toddled after him, reaching for him with grasping fingers. He bent to pick her up and she reversed direction, evading his hands and darting off towards the sofa with a giggle.
Lestrade sighed, put his hands up. Went out of the room muttering to himself, but there did not seem to be any real heat to it.
And John had hated him. He'd hated him for telling the truth and shattering the peaceful domestic fiction that John had let himself believe in. He'd hated him for forgiving Mary, for befriending her even after she'd put a bullet in his chest. He'd hated him for not seeing through John, for not reading the signs of John's confused miserable unhappiness though surely it must have been obvious. He'd hated him for making a vow and then proving himself to be human after all—fragile, fallible, capable of failure. He'd hated him because he could not possibly hate Mary, because Mary was dead.
"You think I don't know that this—that it won't last? Can't last?" John says, softer now. "It's already not working."
Janine's hand was still at Sherlock's hip, fingertips dangerously close to the waistband of his pyjama bottoms.
"My battery is running low," Sherlock said. "I should save it. I'll need to make contact with Mycroft."
The staff were close. Closer than the staff at the surgery he'd worked at in London. Happy hours and birthday parties and all that rot. He'd finally allowed himself to be talked into going along. It was, he'd thought, what normal people did.
John crosses the room to him with stumbling steps, still laughing, and then his hands are on Sherlock's arms and Sherlock's hands are on John's face and Sherlock is brimming with love, he is
John did not have to deduce. He knew who was at the door, and why. He suspected he knew her state of mind, as well.
Sherlock frowned, pressed the tips of his gloved fingers against his mouth. Ghosts. Why ghosts? John was neither superstitious nor particularly fanciful.
John shut his eyes. A miserable sound escaped his throat. Wetness had pooled on his cheeks and he swiped angrily at it.
"The Wexell Cup is next week. We'll have more people trickling in when it gets closer to race day. Seems like everyone wants to get a good look at him."
Sherlock frowned. "You're not generally the most observant of people, John, but I assumed that much was obvious."
He brushes a finger over the power button. There is no way that there is still life in the battery, not after so much time has passed. He doesn't even see a place on the back where a battery could possibly be detached, or a power cable plugged in.
"Going to appointments. Cake tastings, flowers. That sort of thing. Thought you were rubbish at it?"
"Shh," he said, but he could not stop a smile from spreading across his face. He went to her, picked her up, cradled her against his chest. She was warm and solid. "How long have you been keeping that little trick a secret, hm?"
John walked back to his desk, dropped heavily into his chair. He put the safety back on his gun, left it lying warm and heavy in his lap like a favoured pet.
His body felt strangely numb, slow to respond, useless. His brain was an engine hooked to a dying battery, sparking, gasping, unable to fully ignite.
"Didn't think you'd actually show up tonight," Greg continued, confirming John's suspicion that he'd been invited out of courtesy, nothing more and nothing less.
John kept his grip light, his fingertips sliding up to dance at the edge of the faded t-shirt sleeve. He could not quite bring himself to meet Sherlock's eye.
So instead he lounged in a half-doze on the sofa and let her carry on about a variety of inane subjects: Mr Chatterjee's fickle affections, the truly appalling price of petrol these days, the state of her bins, Mrs Turner's dubious taste in clothing.
He supposed that was only natural. Some of them were there for Janine, and Sherlock had almost certainly padded the head count with members of his homeless network.
he thinks, and the small flare of anger surprises him. He wants to shout at her, wants to demand an explanation for why she's here now, two months after Sherlock's death, stirring up old hurts and, for what? To hand off a piece of rubbish in a cardboard box?
Sherlock's mouth twitched, and he struggled to arrange his face into something a little less obviously, devastatingly fond.
Airport security had arrived. They hauled the man up off of the ground, began dragging him towards the exit. Some of the passengers clapped.
"No," Sherlock said. He followed Mycroft into the hall anyway, put on his new-old coat. It draped across his shoulders like an old friend.
"I—yes. Amenable. That's the word." John nodded, swallowed. He could not look away from Sherlock's eyes.
And now, almost a year on, John found himself facing the troubling realisation that he simply might never see Sherlock again. That the stilted, uncomfortable words they'd shared were the last, the final nail in the coffin of a friendship (and oh, Christ, it had been more than a friendship, he'd never had a friendship like that) that had finally collapsed under the weight of every terrible thing they had done to one another.
"I am in the public eye, John," Sherlock said quietly. He did not look up from his scrutiny of the cakes. "The only way this ruse will work is if I make it into a spectacle."
He'd thought the coat too formal for daily wear when she'd first spotted it on the rack. A double-breasted greatcoat, light pink, with a wide collar. But she'd seemed so in love with it, and when he let her try it on, she'd stood in front of the mirror and done a clumsy little spin, clapping her hands in front of her like Sherlock receiving news of a gruesome murder, the coat fanning out behind her, and he had been
The waiting room was empty, and John hesitated as he walked through the door. He chanced a glance at the reception desk, but there was no one occupying Mary's chair.
"Don't apologize," John said. He could have laughed from the relief of it all. "I thought that—well. Never mind. You just—you just—lost phone signal."
That was—that was more likely, was it not? More likely than Rosie, at four years old, deciding on her own to reach out?
The legs of John's trousers were soaked up to the knee, the fabric dragging limp and heavy against the ground. Snow and ice crusted the shoulders of his coat. Damp tendrils of his rumpled hair clung to his forehead. There was a bead of moisture at the end of his nose.
He's been nervous since the first envelope he sent to Sherlock came back stamped RETURN TO SENDER. The second—and third—had simply disappeared into a void: unacknowledged, unreturned. The fourth he'd sent care of the laboratory, and he'd paid extra for delivery confirmation.
position yourself in my brother's good graces. The disgraced assassin, returning to foil a dastardly inside scheme, earning both forgiveness and gratitude. Has rather a nice ring to it, don't you think?"
Sherlock opened his eyes and met John's gaze, shivered at the emotion there. He hadn't seen. Somehow, he'd never seen it.
"Most are harmless to us," Sherlock said. He swallowed, fought against the urge to sweep his gaze along the ceiling.
And—if he were honest with himself—a little melancholy. Faintly mourning those lost years, what might have been.
Sherlock's eyes had been very wide, there in the wreckage of the therapist's office. His hands had been trembling and bloodied.
It was not large, an 8x8 square. Wrapped canvas, unframed. Acrylic paint, medium quality. The skill of the artist: masterful. The subject: devastating.
She could have stood up, she supposed. She could have made her excuses and left. She had not. Instead she'd shifted in her seat and listened.
The silence had grown heavy, strange. Sherlock's face was pinched in a way that John could not recall ever haven seen before. He was not wearing his coat, nor his suit jacket. He did not typically go out in just his shirtsleeves, even in warm weather.
The bartender had been young and lovely. Cream-pale skin, long dark hair. Light eyes. She'd had a quick wit and a generous smile and she'd teased him a bit, maybe flirted, and he'd made a halfhearted effort to flirt back. Christ, she'd been pretty. It had felt good, noticing another person again.
"Do you really want to know?" Sherlock asked, irritated now. "Because I'll tell you." He glanced over at John, daring him to say something.
"Counting on you being distracted, I suppose," John said. "Too busy terrorising the staff. Or—" he stopped.
"I didn't want to be with her, the first time I came back here," John says. He speaks in a quiet voice, his inflection oddly flat. The skin between his brows is pinched. "And I thought if I put it off for too long, that it might end up being—that I might build it up in my head so much that it—that I might—"
"DO YOU LIKE HIM? DO YOU?!" Rosie bellows, unable to take the quiet any longer. She grabs onto Sherlock's arm and lets her feet kick off the ground, dangling for a moment before letting go.
Sherlock was—he was Sherlock. John loved him. Needed him, though that was not the most comfortable thing to examine head-on. Sherlock had called him family and had
He thought of Mary on the floor of the aquarium, blood spreading dark and hot across the front of her shirt. Thought of Sherlock sprawled on grey pavement, a wet crimson halo crowning his shattered head. There had been things he'd wanted to say. To Mary, to Sherlock. He'd never got the chance.
Sherlock breathes out, all in a rush. There is a painful twist behind his ribs, accompanied by the odd swoop of elation that only ever seems to happen when John does something unexpected. It makes him want to grin again, propriety be damned. He manages to control himself, but only just.
"Unlikely, but not impossible. You know my methods, John. It would be a mistake to theorise without all of the facts."
"I apologise if that makes you uncomfortable," Sherlock said, in that same awful flat voice. "I never intended for you to know."
"No need," Sherlock says. He does not quite know why he is being thanked. He is quite certain that, on balance, he'd made for a terrible flatmate. "She paid her share of the rent."
Victoria emerged from the dressing room, and Sherlock swiveled away from Evie to focus on her instead. His voice dropped even lower. He was nearly purring, now. "No, no, no. When one is working with such beautiful art—" he gestured vaguely towards her and she dropped her head, smiled coyly, "—the frame needs to enhance that beauty, not cover it up."
"Come on!" John says. The truck below them is wobbling, trembling, being sucked backwards by the force of the wind.
Surely that was a good thing. Surely that meant Lazarus had got wherever it was that he needed to go, that he'd been rescued or extracted or whatever the preferred terminology was for stranded spies.
He had arrived home from Belarus. John was in the kitchen, dressed. Grumpy. John was looking at the kettle. Making tea. There had been two mugs on the counter.
Matter decided, Sherlock reached for his laptop, dragged it off the desk towards him. He booked himself a one-way ticket on an evening train from Liverpool Street Station. Then he closed his laptop, sat drumming nervous fingers on the lid.
As if sensing John's eyes on him, Sherlock lifted his head. A little furrow appeared in his brow, and then he grinned.
He looks to his left, in the direction that Mary had gone. Stands for a long moment just watching the people as they hurry along the pavement.
he typed, and then sent the email without allowing himself to hesitate. Shut his laptop. Stared at the wall. After a moment, he stood.
She looks startled, but recovers with admirable speed. "Um. Well—yes, actually. Signed the papers three months ago, but we were separated for a bit before that. Sorry, but, is that relevant?"
John stirred, lifted his hands to his face, made a grumbling sound in the back of his throat. Sat up.
Sherlock shifted where he stood. "I'd already caused you a great deal of difficulty. I hadn't intended—it was not my intention to upset you." His voice was stiff, defensive.
He cleared his throat, offered a bland smile. Mary looked at him with something wickedly mirthful dancing in her eyes, as if she found the stifling awkwardness in the room more amusing than uncomfortable.
He did not look back at the street, at the mangled remains of his bag, the shattered shards of his laptop.
John was standing next to his bed, tucking his few belongings back into the suitcase. He looked up at Sherlock's approach, held his gaze for a long moment.
"I don't have friends, John," Sherlock said. His heart skittered in his chest and he feared, for a moment, that he might be sick. He forced his mouth into a hard smile. "I don't care about other people. Moriarty was right, in that sense. People die. It's what they do. They die, and I delete them. Because it's more
"I'm not—" John frowned, looked down at the table again. His fingers traced over the faint scars in the wood. "It's just an interview. I've not made any decisions."
with a sly little smile. But Mary is not in the room. Mary is gone, because John deleted their relationship, and now she is a stranger.
"You know, we waited her out that time when she was thirteen," John said. His voice was mild, conversational. "When she ran away. That was your call, and it was the right one."
"Oh," Janine said, recoiling slightly. She smiled, shook her head, let out a halting little laugh. "No, I'm not—I find children a bit scary, to be honest."
"Bristol," Sherlock said. His voice was devoid of inflection. "Hm. You've chosen well. Frequently named one of the best places to live in the UK, but surely you already knew that."
The sofa is comfortable. He has worn a groove in the faded cushions. He will pass the night here without complaint. He may even sleep—the long night has taken its toll on his body. He is only human, as much as he'd sometimes like to deny it. He has needs. He has . . . wants.
Sherlock blinked at him, a furrow briefly appearing between his eyes before smoothing away again like it had never been there. "One never knows. Would be a shame to be unprepared."
dead, with his dark matted curls flopping wetly against his skull and the sodden collar of his coat sticking to the skin at the back of his neck.
John smiled, went through the door and up the stairs. Sherlock listened to the creak of his footsteps, the sounds he made as he settled Rosie in her cot. The steady tread on the stairs as he came back down.
John thought of the news articles he'd pulled up while in the flat on Baker Street, the research he'd done on Sherlock Holmes. His heart sank.
Sherlock made a strangled sound, lunged for him again. He shoved at John, manhandling him down the hallway towards the bedroom.
He felt curiously light, giddy. He caught himself staring at Sherlock's closed bedroom door and grinning.
"Fine," Sherlock says. He glances at John, looks away. The pressure on his chest is still there. It feels as though he has been holding his breath for a very long time.
Spike in blood pressure, increased respiration. Panic. Muscles slowing, becoming less responsive. He could not maneuver his arms enough to shrug out of the heavy wet wool of his coat.
It was a bit cramped, he thought, but it would do. The walls were white and smelled of fresh paint. There was not a scrap of wallpaper in sight.
"Jesus," John said again. His knees buckled and he stumbled, putting out a hand to catch himself against the wall. "Jesus."
He stands up reluctantly, scratches at the back of his neck. He had not expected to find anything of note, so he does not know why he feels vaguely disappointed.
"Sherlock," she said, when she saw his eyes had opened. She sat forward, the stress dropping from her shoulders.
And at the same time, he wanted to fall to his knees in front of his friend and beg forgiveness, wanted to wipe away the whole of the last terrible year, wanted Sherlock close, wanted his inappropriate comments and sly little jokes, his cleverness and audacity and entirely misplaced devotion.
"So now you come home and just—" John hesitated, glanced at Sherlock and then away. "Pick up where you left off, then?"
"There's a high probability that there are several spiders in the flat at this very moment. They are, in fact, everywhere. There's no avoiding them."
The bubble burst and it was loose, it was on his face, suffocating and quivering and reaching for his screaming mouth.
He hadn't slept. He'd lain awake next to John, just barely touching, not wanting to disturb. He'd filled his lungs with the warm clean scent of John's soap on his skin, studied the microexpressions that flitted across John's face as he dreamed. Examined the pores on John's face, traced the tips of his fingers along the hairs on John's arms, his legs. Cupped his palm over the puckered skin of John's ruined shoulder, ghosted his nose along John's hairline.
And then he wasn't breathing. He was no longer idly browsing in a dingy basement somewhere in London—a dingy basement he'd paid five quid to enter—he was in Afghanistan, squinting in the sunlight and laughing at something one of his mates had said.
He looked back. The man was still watching him, but his face was guarded. The open warmth from a moment ago was gone.
"It was the brother," he told Lestrade, tossing the first file onto the sofa cushion next to him. "The girlfriend," he said, adding the second to the pile. He held up the third folder, waggled it in the air. "Not a murder at all. Accidental choking. Broken ribs were posthumous, a failed attempt at resuscitation. The witness was afraid of being wrongly accused—correctly, it seems—and fled the scene."
The music hit a sour note. The singer's voice cut out, and John whirled, instinctively shoving Jeanette behind him just as Sherlock threw his bass aside and leapt out into the crowd.
Sherlock rolled his shoulders in a small shrug, a helpless little gesture that did not belong on the man who had been rampaging around London all day, terrorising bakers and checkout clerks alike.
She does not exist. She has never existed. Mary, who used to smile at him when a patient did or said something particularly egregious. Mary, with her sharp humour and sly comments. Mary, who he'd wanted to build a life with. Deleted. Gone.
He looks to his left as the truck pulls even, ready to give the driver a piece of his mind, and the ground drops out beneath him.
There had been none of this forced politeness. Sherlock had been relaxed and happy and John—John had been relaxed and happy too.
"What was that?" John asks him as he comes back through the door. Rosie is still on his hip. She seems to be in good spirits. He has given her his notebook and she clutches it in small hands.
Well, Sherlock was a lot of things. He was brilliant, of course, and a bit insane, often prickly but just as often awkward (and John thought that the people around him had trouble differentiating between the two, which led to most of the misunderstandings); he could be warm and unexpectedly funny and—
John had made him tea. He had not been home. John would have had no idea when he was expected to return from Belarus, as he hadn't bothered to text details. But John had made him tea.
The ghost of a smile had flickered across Sherlock's face. And then the smile had been gone, and his gaze had sharpened. "Oh," he'd breathed. "That's it."
The cocktail hour was in full swing, guests milling about with glasses of champagne and little plates piled high with expensive cheeses. There was a bloody string quartet set up in the corner, filling the air with sweet, delicate music (and John supposed he ought to be grateful that it wasn't Sherlock himself serenading Janine with his violin).
"Life outside the city is rarely boring, John," Sherlock said. He scooted to the edge of his chair. "Oh, rural locations may
but perhaps that had only come about because of his conversation with Sarah Sawyer. A crime of opportunity, so to speak.
"What are you doing?" John asks from the doorway, hours later. His voice is hesitant, as if he is unsure of his welcome.
"You knew that would happen," John said, later, as they left the shop. Police lights bathed the street in red and blue.
Spiders in the alley. The two men, grabbing at him, laughing as they dragged him from his hiding place.
Others had begun to arrive. Down the hall, he could hear the quiet spaces beginning to fill with the rustle of clothing, muffled laughter and muted conversation.
Lestrade made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a laugh. "I thought you said you told him," he said, the comment clearly meant just for Molly but in a voice loud enough to be heard clear across the room.
John shrugs. Sighs. He does not know, not really, but he knows Sherlock. And he supposes that will have to be enough. "I'm glad you're not dead."
"Door has been breached," Moriarty said. His expression flickered, attention pulled briefly from John, though he was still smiling. "Leave no one alive."
The nurse who wasn't a nurse. Hard eyes, coiled competence, surprising candor. Swiping the spider down from the ceiling, crushing it under her heel.
Sherlock considers. John's offer to bring back food, while polite on the surface, belies his true intentions. He has deliberately not invited Sherlock along.
At some point in the night, Sherlock had gone into the kitchen. Rummaged around in the cabinets until he came up with a bottle of good—whatever, irrelevant, didn't matter, it was the alcohol content he was after, not the taste—and poured himself a glass. He'd drunk it down without tasting it, poured another. Then he'd carried both glass and bottle to his chair to await the sunrise.
Sherlock scowled, looked away. He was half-tempted to leave. But—well—John had made it quite clear (on several separate occasions, no less) that solving a crime and failing to tell anyone the solution was frowned upon.
With some effort, he dragged himself over the center console, settled into the back seat. Set to work untying his shoes.
It shouldn't matter. Sherlock was alive. Smith was dead, some kind of prison accident. It had been in all the papers. The news had stopped John cold when he'd first heard it.
He tuned her out, glanced into the sitting room. It was golden with morning sun. Molly and Lestrade had gone.
"Tea," John says, and his hand is still worrying at the back of his neck. He looks diminished, somehow, in the dim hall light. His face is pale, his eyes shadowed. The skin on the back of his knuckles is red and scraped raw, and it hurts her heart, that sight, even though Sherlock had told her weeks ago what might happen.
"Ah, look, right on time," Lestrade said, turning in his chair. He waved an arm. "Hopkins! Over here!"
He picks her up, bounces her a bit. The air is crisp, and her cheeks are red. He kisses the side of her head, her tousled blonde hair.
"Is with Mrs Hudson," John says. "Who is neither a housekeeper nor a babysitter, but who is—fortunately for me—perfectly happy to play the role of the doting grandmother once in a while."
John was not particularly keen on being deduced. "Monday, then?" he asked, hoping to forestall whatever it was that Sherlock intended to say.
There is a screen (dark) and a keyboard (mostly ordinary) and a little round button that certainly appears to be the power switch.
"In there," he said unnecessarily. There was a piece of paper taped to the front of the door and John ignored it as he steered Sherlock through, kicking away the little doorstop and letting the door slam shut behind them.
There are hands on him again. He is turned, and lifted. The hard press of a gurney beneath his back. He lets his limbs flop limply to his sides.
His eyes drifted closed, opened again. He had no way to contact John. His phone was dead. Surely he—
"You don't think he's just—I don't know, using the lab as a—" John pauses, looks at him. His expression is odd, a little embarrassed. "Well, you know. Quiet place for a late night rendezvous?"
without encountering a single creative murder. Months! And half the time when the Yard calls me in on other matters, it's because they've placed wagers on how long it will take me to sort it out."
He grinned, let his hands play across his shirt, toying with the buttons but not actually undoing them. There was a spot of dried blood stiffening the fabric next to one button, and he tried not to wince as his hand slid over it. "And I'm your birthday present."
"Okay," John said. His breath ghosted over Sherlock's lips. Sherlock shivered. "Okay. Um. What are we—what, exactly, do you want to do about that?"
Sometimes Sherlock is sitting in his chair in 221B when John arrives with Mrs Hudson for one last look around. He stands up with a wince and a quiet beseeching
The draft was only a few hours old. John had returned home, had put his daughter to bed, poured himself a drink, and drafted an email he had not sent.
After Irene had put on her coat and gone out into the rain, John sat down heavily on the battered leather sofa, put his head in his hands.
He is meant to let him go. He just did not expect to be doing it so soon. Being inside the aquarium has addled him, has muddled his mind like silt stirred up at the bottom of an unsettled sea.
A smile, hooking up the corner of John's mouth. Faint but genuine. He'd not been upset that Sherlock had lingered. This was something else.
John lifted his hand away from his eyes, watched as Sherlock attempted to extricate himself from the embrace with a polite little pat on Anderson's shoulder.
He caught a knife to the ribs, narrowly avoided a kidnapping attempt. Dodged sniper fire on a crowded street, caught the faint almond odour of cyanide wafting up from his food.
In the fourth shop, they seemed to get along splendidly. They held hands and stared at sample bouquets, Sherlock complimented Janine's perfume and she favoured him with a long, lingering kiss amongst beautiful arrangements of long-stemmed flowers. The result was so startlingly convincing that John stared for a moment too long, then looked away, his cheeks hot and his stomach churning.
"Dad's right, you know," she said, after a long moment. "It's good to have someplace waiting for me. This is home. Always will be. So—um. Thank you. I know you'd have made a small fortune off of this place if you really wanted to sell it."
"You've seen how fond they are of their sharks here," Sherlock says lightly. "Would hate for one of them to accidentally choke on a femur."
He thinks about going inside, about seeing the innkeeper who had made a good-natured (but mistaken) assumption about him and Sherlock. He thinks about staying in the room they'd shared, the one with the two tiny creaking beds against opposite walls. He thinks about cracking open that bottle of scotch and drinking until the sun comes up.
Sherlock had paused in the midst of his conversation with Lily and Evie. Janine was nowhere to be seen.
He wants to ask her why, or how she can possibly be sure of such a thing. No one could ever be sure of anything with Sherlock. He was simply Sherlock, and John had thought him amazing (and also infuriating, but mostly amazing), and now he was dead. He had not left instructions behind. He'd not left a note.
He'd got them kicked out of the first shop after pointing out the florist's wife was cheating on him with the delivery driver. (
"Sherlock," John said. "Whatever you think—just—just hold on, all right? Help is on the way. By this time tomorrow you're going to be in hospital, feeling incredibly embarrassed over all of this—all of this politeness. So stop it. Just stop it."
He shook his head, because that was something he was not ready to think about. Something he doubted he'd ever be ready to think about. Not anymore, not after everything that had happened.
Not enough. He'd known it, of course. He'd always known it wouldn't be enough. He'd known quite well, and he'd tried anyway, because—because—
John smiled, feeling self-conscious and caught out. "Just happy," he said. He placed his palm flat against Sherlock's cheek, traced his thumb across one sharp cheekbone.
He opened his eyes, cotton-mouthed and gasping on the floor. His limbs were leaden, slow to respond.
Fantastic. Brilliant. Not exactly what he'd had in mind for the evening, but things with Sherlock rarely ever went to plan.
"Here," Sherlock said, his voice swallowed by the wind. He'd stopped at a partially snow-covered lump.
So I suppose you've all seen the news already. He's gone and done it. Sherlock Holmes is engaged and officially off the market.
"A word of advice," Sherlock said, his voice loud enough to carry clear across the room. "If you are seeking to sell off valuable records stolen from your ex-wife's collection, you might want to consider using a middleman. You were shockingly easy to track down."
"Mrs Hudson is happy to do it," Sherlock said. "It's all been arranged." He stopped, looked down at Rosie and then up at John. Something in John's expression seemed to unsettle him. When he spoke again, his voice was hesitant, uncertain. "Unless—unless you would rather—"
"Hm," Sherlock says. He tucks his chin in, considers. His chest feels warm and tight. "That's not what people usually say."
"No. I don't want to watch—" John breathed out, clenched his hand. "I don't want to see some poor bastard get his head kicked in on what's supposed to be the happiest day of his life."
Well. He shouldn't have expected anything different. John was—John had made it quite clear that he wasn't interested in—in anything. At all.
Mary lets out a slow breath. When she speaks, her voice is slow, thoughtful. "When you described your marriage, you made it seem like an impulsive decision. A spur-of-the-moment thing that you immediately regretted."
"Sorry, Dr Watson?" she says. Whatever she see is in his face causes her to take a step back. She holds the chart in her hand out in front of her, almost like a shield. "Next patient's ready for you."
"Sherlock," he said, although Sherlock couldn't help him, Sherlock had no idea what he was thinking or seeing or doing, he had no idea what had happened—what had
John tips his head back and laughs again, and the sound is not mocking but genuine, genuine and unexpected and altogether wonderful.
"That's what they're saying. But they—" Allie paused, her voice wavering, near tears again. "But I know it can't be true. Please help. Please. Whoever did this is still out there."
He looked back at Sherlock. Really looked at him. Remembered the haggard, bloodied face he'd first glimpsed in the shadows through their initial tenuous connection. The tangled, matted hair. Fever-bright eyes.
He is fairly sure that Sherlock would say yes to him because Sherlock is lonely. That Sherlock would consent to the messiness and unpredictability of integrating his vastly unsuitable life with a child just gone three years old in exchange for having someone to pass him his phone from time to time and listen to him ramble about cigarette ash.
Blood roared in his ears. He turned, scanned the room for Janine, could not find her. The attendant had retreated back to her desk, was staring at her computer. She looked ill.
"Oh, use your eyes," Sherlock snapped, because anger was easier. He did not need to dig very far to find it. "It's sugar. Clearly Mrs Hudson's been in my pants drawer."
"Molly has your daughter," Sherlock said, his voice slightly muffled. He was struggling with something, breathing hard with the effort. He did not lift his head.
Christ, he was attractive. The skin around his mouth had flushed up red where he'd wiped away the moustache, making him look as if he'd been recently and thoroughly snogged, like stubble had dragged rough against that pale skin and—
He'd spent his life seeking out professions, relationships, situations where his faults would be seen as strengths.
"Jesus," he said, and then he was running, his chest burning and the taste of copper at the back of his throat.
"Doesn't he?" Sherlock smiles, the pleased incandescent smile that only comes when he's been proven right. He approaches the horse cautiously, hand out, strokes the creature's velvety muzzle. Then he dips his fingers in the water bucket, rubs his damp hand across the animal's forehead.
He looked at the bookcases against the wall, piled high with dusty volumes and curiosities. Looked at the tall windows overlooking Baker Street. Thought of all the times he'd nearly blown the place up but hadn't, thought of the two times someone else had.
Eventually, John had reached over and turned off the tap. He'd given a little self-conscious laugh and stepped out onto the tile. He'd towelled himself briskly, dressed. His hair stuck up in appealing damp silver spikes and Sherlock had wanted to
Sherlock did not stumble on the carpet as he and Janine made their way back up the aisle. Nothing fell on him, and no one leapt from the crowd of jubilant guests with a sharpened blade. The tail of his suit jacket did not ignite as it trailed past a poorly-placed candle.
He wanted to splash cold water on his face. He wanted to look himself in the eye in a bathroom mirror and tell himself to get a grip. The bathroom was—the bathroom was adjacent to Sherlock's room. He couldn't do that. No way.
Still, he thinks, it could be worse. Mary is lovely. They get on well. He couldn't exactly invite her to live in the cramped little space he'd retreated to after Baker Street, and so getting a place together made sense. They have a future. He supposes he'll get around to proposing, eventually.
Sherlock looked down at the ground. He was conscious, suddenly, of the warmth in the room, of the play of fading sunlight against the walls, of the fact that they should be on their way home, on their way back to London, leaving the tall grass and the rambling manor houses and the family secrets behind them.
"Yeah, just like the others—" Molly must have seen something on his face, because her voice trailed off. "What is it?"
"I thought you were unhappy here," Sherlock says, speaking quickly, drowning out whatever it is that John intended to say. There is a sense of elation, blooming hot behind his ribs, that makes his words emerge fast and sharp. "But I didn't have all the facts. You
"Right," John says. He is not terribly surprised that Sherlock is thinking about storms. Sherlock is always thinking about storms. Nothing, and no one, could ever hope to compete with that. "Well, look, I—I don't want to hold you up. If you could just sign the papers, I'll get out of your way."
The violin gleamed. It was well cared for, clearly a prized possession. The man cradled it, caressed it, coaxed music from its strings like a lover. Christmas songs. One after another after another, blending seamlessly together, old and new, jaunty and sad, cloying and melancholy. The man's eyes were closed, his mouth unsmiling. Every note rang out clear, haunting. Beautiful.
He'd always hated being passive. It got under his skin, the knowledge that there was something that needed
he bit back the words at the last minute, pressed the back of his hand against his mouth. His hand was trembling.
They should have wheeled Sherlock down to her by now. But they hadn't. That wasn't part of the plan. That wasn't part of the plan, and neither was the gunshot that had been reported up on the roof. No one had told her anything and she thought she might chew through her lip while she stood waiting, frozen, half-panicked and unsure.
"Brilliant," John said. "I was going to say brilliant. Everything you—all of it. It was spot-on. Yeah? I was. I was regretting it. Regretting that I hadn't, that I couldn't—" he stopped, let out a rueful laugh. "I put Rosie to bed and poured myself a drink. I was going to write to you. I wanted—well—clearly that didn't happen. But. If you'd knocked on the door, it would have been. Good. Yeah."
"Going to need more to go on than that, but it's a start," Lestrade said. He shook his head, looked from Sherlock to John. "For God's sake, this is the second murderer I've had to arrest at one of your weddings. What are the odds?"
That didn't bear thinking about. John had elected not to accompany him. Something had upset John, something had shaken him, something had taken the warmth from his voice and the joy from his face.
"John," he said, and his voice emerged trembling, urgent. He ploughed on. "It has occurred to me that—perhaps—" he stopped, breathed out. Tried again. "You're interviewing for a positon in Bristol. If that's what you truly want, then—um. Disregard this. But if it's not—on the off chance that you're there because you think that there are certain—things. Things that I should have said a long time ago and never did, then—well. That's my failing. And you should know. Well, there are a lot of things you should know. But most importantly, you should know that. That I—would like you to stay. Here. With me." He cleared his throat, looked up at the ceiling. "Forever, in case that wasn't clear."
John smiles a little at that, keeps his eyes on the ground. "I thought the worst. Initially. Well. Can't blame me, really. What was I supposed to think, when my sister calls in the middle of the night to tell me she's moving in with some bloke she met while drunk in a holding cell at Scotland Yard?"
Rosie had been uncharacteristically fussy over breakfast, had spilled juice down her front and necessitated a quick bath and a change of clothes. Then she'd spit up on her second shirt, necessitating another hasty cleaning and change.
He slipped his phone out of his pocket, considered the pros and cons of texting John. It would be less invasive than pursuing and cornering him on public transit. Without the pressure of immediate confrontation, John might be more inclined to open up. On the other hand, texts were far too easy to ignore. John, on the retreat, considering his entire endeavor a
The door was shut. He opened it, perhaps a bit vigorously—it rebounded against the wall and swung back, almost striking him in the face.
"Sherlock's in Serbia," she said. Her voice was clipped, matter-of-fact. "Got himself embroiled in a rather colossal scheme, if I do say so myself. Things went badly, as they often do, and then he dropped off the radar. He was—well, you get the idea."
"London is my home." She pauses, because how can she explain, how can she make John understand the strange pull the city has over her? The way she loves it? Sherlock understands. She thinks he feels much the same about their lovely city, that he feels the quiver of London's heartbeat in his veins the same way that she does in hers.
But Sherlock's gaze was not directed over his shoulder. Sherlock's gaze was fixed on him, rigid and frozen like a man awaiting sentencing for a terrible crime.
He opened his eyes. Lestrade was in the sitting room next to the smashed television, one hand on the back of his head. He was looking down at John's mobile on the floor.
conversation, really, and John should have left, should have turned and walked out the door as soon as he'd spotted him by the bar. Because now they were only inches apart, and the anger and hurt and regret and longing that had been threatening to spill over for the last year was once more bubbling dangerously to the surface.
It should not have surprised him. When he'd initially decided to go after Smith, he'd considered the variables very carefully. He'd planned for John. He'd planted the recorder in his cane.
He did not answer. The air quality was poor, thick with the smell of old mud and stale water and mould. He looked up at the ring of grey sky, at the faint outlines of the stones all around. His teeth chattered.
John stifled a tired smile, sat down in his chair. Rosie struggled for a moment, but she was clearly exhausted from her long day and eventually relaxed against him, dozing against his shoulder. He should not get too comfortable, he knew. It was getting late, and Baker Street was not his home any more.
He pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes, hard. When he lifted them away, the room was empty.
"The actual anniversary was five days ago," Sherlock looks unsettled. There is a crease between his furrowed brows. "If you. Um. Intended to . . . memorialise the event in some way. Why not then?"
"Great," Sarah said, and offered him a sardonic little smile. "Well. I suppose that will give us plenty of time to analyse where our relationship went wrong."
A spider pushed out from between Moriarty's lips, scuttled across his chin, down his neck. A strand of saliva clung to its back, stretched, snapped.
The door eased open. Molly in the hallway, Lestrade behind her. Two for one. Delightful. He must have looked worse than he'd thought.
"Yeah," John says, and he seems to sag a bit. He turns, puts his hand on the door, reaches into his pocket for his keys.
He had stood up in front of a room full of people and had pledged to protect John and Mary and the baby. Whatever it took. Whatever the cost. He had vowed it, and he had
"Nice of you to be so concerned for his well being. I'll pass along the sentiment. I'm sure he'll be touched."
He went out into the hall, stood on the landing. Looked down the worn stairs at the door. Took a steadying breath.
Sherlock had leaned forward in his chair, was pinning John with a particularly sharp gaze. "I assume you've utilised Alice's dubious charms and made contact with the rest of them? Any leads?"
He stopped, pressed his knuckles against his mouth. Even now, he couldn't seem to say it. Even now, he couldn't do it properly.
Sherlock made a strangled sound, his hands sliding up John's back, fingers splaying wide. His skin was warm. His chest was heaving. He opened his eyes. His expression was wild.
"It's no bother," she touched his forehead, tipped his head back to look at the bandage. A sly smile lifted the corner of her mouth. "Got me out of the office a bit early."
"Right," John says. He sighs, looks down at the ground, at the dirt and straw and trampled cornstalks. "Well. Look, Sherlock, I don't—"
And just like that he is adrift again, lost, bewildered and floundering. John does not look angry. John looks—John looks thoughtful, a little sad.
She'd had a point, he knew. They were not close. He did not willingly seek out her company. Never had.
John had turned away without a word, went down the hallway into the bathroom. Sherlock listened as the water turned on. He tipped his head back against the couch cushions, closed his eyes. Thought about John's inexplicable smile. Allowed himself a moment, just a moment, to relive John's hands on his body, John's breath in his lungs.
When Rosie was thirteen, Sherlock had stood at the top of the stairs and looked at her empty room and had told John
at the way that Sherlock reared back like a spooked animal. He relaxed his grip on Sherlock's coat sleeve, let his hand slip down along the slim wrist, tangled their fingers together.
It reminded him, sharply, of Irene Adler, her red fingernails, and he pressed his lips together, forced himself not to look away.
Sherlock sighed again, shifted his feet. Looked up at the sky. Tried to remember. "Tall grass," he said.
John laughs, again, because isn't that just perfect? Christ, what had Sherlock been thinking? He may have been a genius, but he'd certainly not been an engineer.
Faint predawn light crept through the windows. The chair across from him was empty, Mrs Hudson long gone.
Sherlock pressed his hand against his mouth, crouched down. Swept his other hand through the murky water. There were rocks at the bottom, jagged and broken. Rocks and snarled weeds and—
"I believe," she said, speaking quietly, carefully, "I should be arranging to place you under arrest."
There was Rosie to consider. Rosie who would, eventually, need her own room. Her privacy. Who might benefit from a garden to play in, or sleep that was not periodically interrupted by explosions or masked intruders or a father who ran off to play hero. His lifestyle had already cost her a mother, after all.
He wondered what his therapist would say. And then he laughed out loud at the thought, a sharp miserable sound, because he'd said more to Sherlock over the phone in one night than he'd said to his therapist in three years.
"Yeah, he'll be home soon," John said. He looked down at the eggs, sizzling and popping. Took the pan off of the heat.
John's face was serious, earnest, worried and sad and conflicted, and Sherlock absolutely did not want to hear what he had to say in that voice, with that face.
"Victoria. She made it her mission to systematically seduce every single man I ever dated in uni. Thought it was funny."
Sherlock turns back to the twisted, melted lump on the desk. He pokes at it, frowns. "Electronics. Really not my area," he says.
There was a smell in the air: takeaway. Chinese. A few hours cold, now. Empty cartons strewn about on the floor.
He thinks he has, likely, always wanted some variation of this. He's learned to live with his inaction.
Evidently Sherlock felt the same, because he made a frustrated sound and let the fridge door swing shut.
"Oh," John said. He looked up. Pete's face was very close and he ducked his head again, feeling oddly uncomfortable. "My—Sherlock. My friend. Sherlock Holmes. He's getting married."
"Bisexual," he said to her, speaking out of the corner of his mouth, his voice just loud enough for John to hear. "No pets. Currently single. He's recently out of a relationship and quite torn up about it—no!—not a relationship. Unrequited feelings for someone unattainable."
Sherlock eschewed his planned accommodations and instead took a room in a cramped boardinghouse. There were brown water stains on the ceiling, cobwebs in the corners. The bedsheets were starchy and scratchy against his skin.
Sherlock was still Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective. Older, wiser, and perhaps a bit kinder, but still the same person. Still brilliant and slightly mad and intoxicating to be around. But John—
"You gave Rosie a gift," John said, later, when he'd stood up from the ground with his knees popping and a grimace on his face. He came over to the sofa, dropped down next to Sherlock with an exhausted little huff of breath.
"Oh," John said. He frowned, looked at the bag. Stooped to set it on the ground. Straightened up again with a groan.
He was rapidly growing overwarm in his coat. A trickle of sweat made its way down his neck, sliced an uncomfortable path between his shoulder blades. He glanced over Greg's shoulder again, just to make sure.
He had walked a good distance from the house. He was conscious of John behind him, of his tense quick breaths, the way he was coiled and ready for action.
Lestrade had downed three pints in rapid succession and vanished off to the gents. And Anderson had not stopped talking.
He looked at her. She was looking back with a mild, detached interest. Her face was drawn, weary. He regretted his earlier uncharitable thoughts towards her. She was bored and restless and uncomfortable, just like everyone else on the train.
John scrubbed his hands through his still-damp hair, took one last look around the room. He went to the mantel, lifted up the grinning skull. Underneath was a small silver key. He picked it up, slipped it into his pocket. Did not allow himself to think about it.
He wondered when he'd be found, and what would be left of him. Unless Arthur Bell tipped someone off as to what had happened, it might be a very long time.
Janine had cleared a space on the coffee table, and he set the bag down. Sherlock leaned forward and snatched one of the cartons.
How he'd regretted that anger, all of it, every single miserable thought he'd ever had, when she was gone.
He scrolled up through the other posts. Photos of Christine with her new coworkers, her friends. Pete was not in any of the photographs.
Sherlock has set off at a brisk pace into the fields. It is only a matter of moments before John catches up. They walk in silence for a time, the barn and the inn and the rambling main house falling away behind them. The sky, once bright with morning sun, slowly begins to darken with rolling clouds. John is terribly conscious of Sherlock—the little puffs of breath and sounds of exertion he makes, the scrape of his shoes against the uneven ground. More than once he spies Sherlock eyeing him, but he does not speak.
The brown recluse spider, with the violin curving gracefully over its back, delivering its devastating bite. It was poetic, in a way. Meaningful.
"John?" Sherlock asked, still warm and cold and trembling, and suddenly quite certain that he'd done something wrong, somehow he'd poisoned the moment.
And so he drank. Because there was no point in searching elsewhere. He knew what he wanted, now, and he knew what Sherlock's mouth tasted like, and he knew what his body felt like pressed against his own, and everything else would surely pale in comparison.
There was no consultation room this time, only a small seating area in the back of the shop. They were greeted by the chef himself, who carefully laid out six slices of cake on the table. The individual slices were meticulously decorated with delicate swirls of buttercream.
"I need to get ready for work," he said, turning, retreating. He could feel Sherlock's eyes on him, tracking as he left the room.
"What do you want?" John whispers. He is close, so very close. His nose brushes against Sherlock's, a hesitant nudge that could almost be an accident.
She smiled. It was a faint, fleeting expression that did not reach her eyes. "Someone very interested in hearing the details of this message intended for a nonexistent department." She looked pointedly at John. "Lady Elizabeth Smallwood. And you are…?"
John pressed his lips together, looked down at the ground. It was still there, still solid, even though the room seemed to have abruptly tilted around him. "Honeymoon?" He swallowed, lifted his head, looked briefly at Sherlock. "Sex holiday, he calls it."
"Great," John said, and clapped his hands together. "That's very helpful—er—I'll be sure to give you a call if anything comes up."
Clearly she did yoga or some other form of intense exercise that required a good deal of stretching, John thought absently. He spared a thought for Alice, whose profile he'd been neglecting amidst the recent excitement.
"Why would I be wondering?" Sherlock asked, too quickly. His hands had come up to fidget with the edge of the duvet.
Sherlock's head snapped up. John stood in the doorway. He was gripping the doorframe with both hands, shoulders squared, breathing hard.
"Right," John says, and blows out a puff of air through his teeth. He does not look particularly pleased. "Well. Prompting accomplished, then. She's asked me to dinner."
"Clearly, in his mind, implicating Jimmy McCarthy in the murder of his father would remove all of McCarthy's influence from his daughter's life," Sherlock said. "Two birds, one stone. Isn't that the saying?"
"Did I ever tell you?" John asked. He laughed, looked down at his hands. "About what it was like after your—well. After your miraculous return from the dead?"
He laughed, looked down at the ground. It was still early in the day. It only felt like years had passed.
John huffed a laugh. He was very aware of the sound of approaching sirens, growing ever louder. "Might have saved you some trouble. Would have created some for me."
"Yes, all right, you've clearly made up your mind," Sherlock told Rosie when her footsteps creaked on the landing just outside the sitting room. "You were right, I was wrong, blah blah blah. Now. Your father is under the impression that the appropriate next step is to engage in some sort of lengthy
John looked down and watched Sherlock's deft fingers at work. The sight was overwhelming and he shut his eyes, took a shuddering breath.
He opened his mouth to say so, and was shocked by the crash of warm lips against his own, by Sherlock's large hands coming up to cup his face with surprisingly gentle fingers.
"Your readers seem to like them," Sherlock says. He tips his head forward, squints through the fading light. "Those kinds of titles."
John did not much care for fruitcake. He reached for it anyway, cut himself a small slice, stood with his back against the counter and ate it with his fingers, the texture slightly sticky, slightly chewy. He barely tasted it.
He thinks of Mary, gasping out her last breaths in his arm under the rippling blue aquarium lights. He thinks of the way she'd smiled at him on their wedding day, their first dance to the plaintive sounds of Sherlock's violin. He thinks of the way her face could shift from warm to cold in an instant, the way he'd loved her, the way he'd loathed her, the way he'd tried his very best to push it all aside and start over. The way it had almost,
The hinges squealed as he pushed out through the dented door. Rain pelted down against his face. He grabbed for his laptop bag, dragging it along with him.
He'd quite liked spiders, once. Was fascinated by their habits, mesmerized by the meticulous construction of their intricate webs.
Sherlock looks up at him, his skin painted golden in the setting sun, beneath the spray of vivid leaves. He smiles, a small smile, but a genuine one.
Sherlock was crouched over him, warm palm cupping his cheek, the tips of his long fingers just barely brushing against the hair at his temple. His other hand was up against John's neck, a light pressure, measuring his pulse.
"He's going to ruin you, Sherlock," Mycroft had said. "It's inevitable, at this point. But he's not going to kill you. We'll take care of that ourselves."
"The Bluebell Railway," she said, still smiling, though dimmed under his scrutiny. "Steam locomotive, beautifully preserved. Runs from East Grinstead to Sheffield Park. It's a lovely trip." She paused, and then
"I am—sorry," Sherlock said. His voice was strange, stilted, as if he were uncertain of his words. He did not step away, his breath puffing warm and intimate against John's face as he spoke. "I had no idea this would be so. Difficult. For you. I'd anticipated a degree of professional jealousy, of course, but—"
Sherlock blinked as he looked around. The room was largely empty. The walls had been painted a stark white, stood bright and naked and waiting for something to adorn them.
His dreary little flat would not suffice long-term. He'd need something nicer, larger, with room for Rosie to grow. The only question was whether he wanted to find that flat in Chelmsford, or back in London.
Sherlock, aloof and untouchable Sherlock, his hand casually outstretched to the side to scratch at a velvety ear, to accept a sniff from a curious muzzle.
Rosie stopped halfway down the stairs, turned around. Her face was blank. She was quite good at hiding her emotions.
And oh, Christ, but that must be him, standing there at Sherlock's shoulder, looking down at something on the screen of Sherlock's phone. Tall and bespectacled and far too good-looking to be a research scientist (and John had not been aware that he maintained an attractiveness standard for research scientists, but it appeared he certainly did).
Their route made no sense. He would have thought it entirely idle, simply a way for Sherlock to keep his legs moving while he worked through the mysteries in his mind, but he guided them through very deliberate turns, down streets heavy with foot traffic, past vendors and pubs and cafes and car parks and rows of parked motorbikes, occasionally stopping short and turning back the way they'd come.
"Sarah Sawyer," John said. "Well. Not Sawyer any more, but that's not—" he looked up, caught Sherlock's eye, shook his head. "Never mind. Not important."
There is joy in John's laughter. It is wild, unrestrained, almost painful—the sound of something tethered for far too long finally tearing itself free.
The man's voice had faded, he'd relaxed so thoroughly once John had told him he'd delivered the message. He could not quite imagine the sheer force of will the man must have exerted to remain conscious, to secure his own safety.
The telly was on, some meaningless talk show. John had it muted, sat on the sofa with his phone tucked against his ear.
"Christ," John said, and his mouth quirked into a smile. He shook his head, looked away, still smiling. "You really need to brush your teeth."
In the morning there were photographs in the papers. And, of course, a simple internet search promised more.
John shook his head, suddenly quite determined that Sherlock understand. "No, look. You want to know why I helped you? I was—I was alone. I'd been useful once, but not—ah—not for a long time. I was just going through the motions, yeah? Rubbish flat. Boring job. Limp."
The man's brows lifted, and this time John had the impression the expression was not calculated or cultivated, but represented a true flicker of surprise.
moves something in Sherlock, though he cannot say quite why. It is foolish to attempt to ascribe tone of voice to a text message from someone he does not know. But that
He didn't know if Jim could access Lazarus's location some other way. But he wanted the laptop, wanted it badly enough to hunt John down across London for it. Badly enough to kill for it.
He'd rocked forward ever so slightly on the balls of his feet, closed the narrow distance between them. He pressed his lips to John's, hesitant, wary. Brought his hands up to cradle John's face, a faint rasp of evening stubble beneath his palms.
John opened and shut his mouth without making a sound. His hand clenched, relaxed, clenched again. He looked as though he regretted removing his coat.
John had said. He'd regretted those words for two years. Had spent the next one thinking them remarkably apt.
Now that John had accepted him as real, the pull towards confrontation was almost too strong to ignore. He could taste it, hot copper in the back of his throat. His fingers itched to curl into fists, to strike and drive the truth out of unsuspecting flesh.
Those other emotions had been there, of course they had, but above all John had been afraid. John had been afraid, and Sherlock had let him run.
Still, John's brain helpfully offered up visuals. Sherlock, his cheeks pink with drink, his eyes closed. Someone else's hands buried in those curls.
"NO!" he shouted, and then lowered his voice with a quick glance around the shop. "No, I don't want to talk about Mary. That's the last bloody thing in the world I want to talk about."
"Yeah, well, I can only assume if you knew I was about to be kidnapped you'd have caught an earlier train."
John's eyes flick to his, and then away. He clenches his fist, clears his throat. "Um. When I got there, everything happened fast. I didn't see her get shot, Sherlock. Only the aftermath. Only the—" his voice breaks and he stops, pulls in a ragged breath. "I know we were at the aquarium, but I couldn't tell you a thing about the room we were in. I didn't take any of it in. It was just Mary, dying, and I was so
Mrs Hudson smiled sweetly. "Oh, no dear, what ever gave you that impression? It's working just fine."
Earlier they had tangled on the sofa, sweat-slick and drunk on bittersweet kisses. The honeyed afternoon light seemed impossibly distant, now.
They stopped at the door to the inn. Sherlock put his hand out, grasped the door handle. Thought about the cramped room upstairs with its two small beds.
"Not me," John said. "I mean. You already said—well—obviously—that wouldn't have worked. But. I mean, maybe Molly could have—"
John could not blame her. He was wasting her time, and they both knew it. He found reason after reason to dismiss the flats she showed him.
He reached out, intending to knock firmly on the tinted glass window, when the door swung open, startling him.
"I don't know," Sherlock admitted. He looked down at the ground, then rallied. "Would you like me to find her?"
"As is often the case, the truth runs contrary to portrayals in popular media. Most shark attacks are a case of mistaken identity, so to speak." Sherlock looks down at his hands, swallows. "Wrong place, wrong time. Surfers, for instance, resemble seals from below."
He opened his eyes. He was indoors, in a room crawling with decay. The air was cold, and faint morning light glowed through dirty, cracked windows. His breath misted in front of him.
Sherlock recoiled, once more feeling the faint echo of spider legs against his own skin. He scratched at his face.
had John jerking back in a rush, swiping a hand over his hair to tame it back down, turning back towards Rosie's room without a word, except—
"Of course they have rooms, John," Sherlock said, stepping up close behind John and dropping his voice just slightly, conspiratorial but still audible. He winked at the clerk, who flushed and looked down. "This is an inn."
He had run through this grass, as a child. These grounds had been his domain, and he'd roamed far and wide, left no rock unturned. He'd thought the land held no secrets from him.
John straightened up, gripped Sherlock's upper arms. He could not quite seem to bring himself to look Sherlock in the eye. "Do you. Do you have any idea? Do you—do you have any idea how much I—?"
Inexplicably, unthinkably, improbably—at some point during the day, while John was preoccupied with the dysfunctional bit of scrap metal his dead flatmate had left behind, Mary Morstan had packed up her half of their home and walked out without a word.
They have stopped beneath the imposing skeleton of a sunken ship. Bits of aged wood jut out overhead. Wide wooden boards creak underfoot.
There is no room for smiling, here. Not here, in the building where Mary died. Which is why John should not be here at all.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment, his face unreadable. He looked down at his arm, at the space John's hand had just vacated. Blinked.
"Had it in my flat for the last fifteen years," John shrugged, looking around, looking anywhere but at Sherlock. There was a small, self-deprecating smile working at the edges of his mouth. "Doesn't really go with the décor, but—"
"Hm?" he started, looked away from the telly. The phone had grown uncomfortably warm against his ear. "Erm. Yeah, sounds great. That'd be—yeah. Great."
There was a furtive movement in the corner of the room and John snapped his head up, squinted through the gloom. Moonlight glinted off of unkempt sandy hair and he winced, looked away. When he looked back, Evan Bell was still there.
When he has finished his shift, John takes a taxi to Barts Hospital. He stands on the pavement looking up at the empty roof. He chases the ghost of the sensation, the swooping, shocking horror of it all as Sherlock stepped forward and rushed to meet the ground.
John reached down to cup him through his pyjama bottoms and Sherlock hissed, throwing his head back against the pillow.
Sherlock's door creaked open. He emerged, rumpled and sleepy-eyed, in his pyjamas and dressing gown.
"Is everything—" John breathed, and then laughed. It was not a happy sound. "No. Everything is not bloody
dogs are—they're supposed to be the smartest breed of dog in the world, which—well. Seemed like something that might appeal to you. And they're energetic and need lots of stimulation and get destructive when bored, and, ah, it just—it just seemed—"
This is a reworked piece of a never-to-be-finished fic that I'd begun writing between S3 and TAB. Another ficlet,
It should bother him. It was the sort of thing he resented, after all. Being managed, being handled. What had Mycroft called them? His
John smiles tightly, shrugs. "So. Care to explain why I just spent the last several hours hiding in the gents?"
"Sure," John says. He steps away from the door, sets Rosie down. She grabs his hand and bounces in place, lifting up onto her tiptoes.
It had come from Sherlock, he knew. Sherlock's nose. His mouth. The split skin over his eye. It had run down and pooled there on the ground while John went on kicking him.
A distant ache in the back of his legs pulls him from his thoughts. It is getting late. He takes out his phone, fires off a text to three key members of his homeless network. Then he ducks into the women's bathroom—quiet, dark, and long empty—and settles in to wait.
And just like that his spine had snapped to attention, his heart had sped up even as his thoughts had settled and he'd fallen into line and everything from that point had been easy.
"Jealous, Sherl? I didn't think you had it in you," Janine said. She laughed, then shook her head. "I'm not pursuing anyone. I made it quite clear to dear, sweet Pete that I'm off the market."
He had the strange urge to laugh again. Instead he tucked the cane away under his seat, leaned his head back against the cushion. Closed his eyes.
She and the bridesmaids were posed in front of a stone fountain, the photographer crouched in front of them. She waved, beckoning him over.
Sherlock did not stray far from the sofa as the hours melted away. He marveled at himself, a bit, for that. On balance, it was not terribly interesting to watch a human in the early stages of childhood development discover the confounding joys of pressing adhesive tape against its skin and then peeling it away, and yet—
Sherlock did not answer. He'd stooped slightly to examine the cakes that had been laid out for them.
"They're breaching the door now," Moriarty said. He kept his eyes fixed on John, unblinking. His smile did not waver.
John dropped his hand away from his face, his heart galloping. He stepped towards Sherlock and Sherlock flinched, a tiny motion, barely even perceptible.
There was a breeze. The sound of birds, of light traffic. John turned his head, slowly, and looked at the sliding glass door.
He took his first bite directly from the container. Stood hunched over the counter, chewing mechanically until his fork scraped against plastic. He tried not to think about Sherlock. It seemed like he was always, always trying not to think about Sherlock.
He watched the door swing shut behind her. Shook his head, bemused. Then he took his wallet out of his pocket, slipped her little note inside.
He hits EXECUTE before he can think too much about it. The fan kicks up, whining in distress. Smoke curls up from the keyboard.
"Yeah, but—" John shook his head. He looked utterly bewildered. Not entirely an uncommon expression for him, but an unwelcome one in this case.
I've fallen a bit behind on comment responses, but please know that I deeply appreciate each and every one. I am going to try to catch up this week.
Sherlock shook his head, bewildered. His neck had felt strangely warm, his chest cold. His hands trembled.
He was human. His morning breath, puffing out between parted lips, was sour. His pale neck was dotted red where John had kissed him, where his stubble had dragged over smooth soft skin.
"We need to get home," she says, shaking her head. "The studio is furious. I've spoken to legal, and there's a chance we might be able to salvage this, but—"
"Sherlock," John says, finally. He opens his eyes, turns to look at Mary. "I need to talk to Sherlock."
He could not help but think about how quickly Janine had settled in at 221B. Case or no case, ruse or no ruse, she'd made herself comfortable in a way he would have thought impossible had he not seen it with his own two eyes.
"Shut up," he says, without rancor. "Just—look, when you died, Sherlock, when you jumped off of that roof, I was in a bad way."
So he and Mrs Hudson had stood in the kitchen and tittered to themselves while he drew a little face on the balloon, and they'd giggled quietly behind their hands as John had tied the balloon to his chair, not making any particular attempt to hide what he was doing, while Sherlock stared up at the ceiling and droned on about soil composition and various species of jellyfish.
The train chugged along. He watched the scenery fly by with a sort of halfhearted attention, pointing out things of interest to Rosie whenever she seemed on the verge of fussing.
Then he dropped the box, spun around, dropping half into a defensive crouch even as he saw a flash of dark fabric disappear around the corner.
All chapters stand alone unless otherwise indicated. The (Never) Turn Your Back to the Sea outtakes will likely not make much sense unless you've read
"Yes," Sherlock said. His voice was quite serious, earnest. He came around so that he was standing in front of John, his chin tucked in, his mouth pressed tight. "I know." His voice dropped a bit, he dipped his head forward, so that John could see his eyes. Could see that he was not deducing, he was
Three days after Rosie's first birthday, he'd booked an appointment with a new therapist. She'd sat and listened patiently as he'd summarised the events of the past year. Occasionally she wrote something down on her notepad. She held it at such an angle that he could not quite read her writing.
"There's nothing for it," Sherlock said, finally. "I'll need to ask Mycroft. A direct approach, I think."
the punchline," Sherlock says. "Or, rather, whatever inconvenient place it's been stashed in. It'll turn up soon. If nothing else, the smell should give it away."
about this," John said. "I've held men together on the battlefield, did you know that? I've saved lives. This is—this is soothing nervous mothers while I remove a splinter from a screaming toddler's index finger. It's a lot of things, but difficult is not one of them."
Something silvery glints in the morning sun. He reaches for it, then hesitates. It could be evidence. Instead of picking it up, he stoops low to examine it where it lies in the mud.
Sherlock said nothing, moved past the fridge to scan the gleaming stainless steel countertops, bending to peer into one of the ovens.
Mycroft had said. No hesitation, no calculation. He'd woven it into his conversation as if it were natural to call her such.
The scuffed black door of their flat, ordinarily a comforting and welcoming sight (foolishly sentimental, to be so attached to a place, but he has despairingly accepted it) does not draw him in the way it normally does. He swallows, hard, dread pooling in his stomach.
"Hello Molly," he said cautiously, eyeing her, searching for some explanation. "Have you—come to examine the body?"
"I've given him the means to ruin you," Mycroft had said, his tone clipped. "He won't do it right away. He'll want to be
that I brought back bad memories, after everything with Mary. And I wouldn't have blamed you if—but—but it wasn't that. Not really. Was it?"
An ungodly wail from Sherlock's violin had jolted him out of bed earlier than he'd have liked, and he'd come downstairs to find Mycroft in the sitting room, perched on the end of John's chair, umbrella clasped loosely between his palms. Sherlock was at the window, his back to the room, sawing away like a madman.
"Thanks for that," John flashed a quick, sharp smile, turned away. "Any more special requests, or am I allowed to finish shopping in peace?"
"Routine check on all the computers in the building," Jim said. His smile seemed oddly fixed on his face. He was chewing gum, and snapped it loudly with his back teeth. "We received reports that there's a nasty virus going around."
"No promises," Pete said with a cheeky little wink. Bold of him, John thought, given the circumstances.
"Known each other a long time," he echoed. All at once, the air in the room felt too thin. He struggled for breath, a knot twisting in his chest. His hand shook and he flattened it against the table, held Molly's gaze, kept his face arranged in what he hoped still resembled a pleasant, neutral expression.
It was a hard kiss, bruising and clumsy, John's shaking hands clutching at the sides of Sherlock's face.
Upon waking the memory of the night before had lingered, so perfect and surreal it could have been a dream.
"Shut up," John said. He held up his hand, shut his eyes. Breathed. Now that he'd got here, he realised he had no idea what he wanted to say. "Just give me a minute."
"They'd overstayed their welcome," Sherlock said. The corner of his mouth tried to twitch up into a tentative smile and did not quite make it. "It's past midnight. Really, John, think of the neighbors."
He pulls back, just enough to take a breath. John looks at him, his eyes bright and confused. He does not look displeased.
Sherlock makes a dismissive noise, shakes his head. "Anything but. One of her students is failing. Falling behind."
Mary said, and the happiness had bled all out of her face, leaving her looking tired and sad and haunted.
The room was not neat the way that Sherlock typically kept his bedroom. It more resembled the mild chaos that occurred when they'd been forced to travel outside of London, to spend the night on unfamiliar ground. Sherlock had a tendency to begin unpacking with some zeal, only to be distracted by his own thoughts midway through his task and leave his suitcase open, belongings strewn about.
She looked back at him, raised her brows. Her cheeks shifted, and he thought she might be smiling behind the white mask she wore.
One of John's neighbors was a stay at home mum with a daughter about Rosie's age. He paid her to take Rosie off his hands a few hours each week. Until recently, he'd been in the habit of spending many of those hours with Sherlock.
"I wouldn't have," John said. He spoke slowly, his voice flat. "When you found me, I'd—I wasn't trying. I was just going to. I was just going to let it stop."
"Case," Sherlock says. He smiles, a bright, false thing. "Haunted morgue, missing cadaver. Weren't you paying attention?"
A message alert chimed almost immediately. John's heart thudded against his ribs as he hastily clicked to open it.
He laughed, a genuine sound, because for God's sake, what else was there to do? She was clearly embarrassed and seeking to break the ice. And he—he wasn't as upset as he should be. Wasn't upset at all, really. He sat down again, rubbed his hand across his face.
"Yeah. Yes. That seems like the—yes. Let's do that." John reached for the doorknob, gave it a desperate twist. It remained stuck. "Only—"
after all, it had been working a shift. An obligation. He'd been dreading it. He'd been dreading it and so he'd changed his mind.
She smirked, pressed a champagne flute into his hand as she walked past. Her heels clicked on the wood floor.
He shifted on the sofa. A blanket tickled under his chin, and he frowned down at it. Someone had covered him in the night.
He was already making plans, Sherlock knew. The idea of the cottage had taken hold. He might offer up a token protest, but he had already decided which of the upstairs bedrooms would function as a little office, and which one they would claim as their own.
John fiddles with the kettle. He is in good spirits, his fingers tapping against the countertop, the beat to a pop song that Sherlock pretends not to know.
He picked it up cautiously (one could never be too careful in his line of work), and lifted it for closer examination. For a moment he frowned, the lines on the page failing to make sense, and then it came together:
"All right," Gregory says. "I'm going to ask that you stick around for a bit, in case we have more questions."
