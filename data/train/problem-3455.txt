“-It wasn’t hard to figure out,” Michael stated as Sam laughed and took them to their bedroom. Castiel and Dean softly moved to hug each other just holding each other for a long time before they went back into the room to retire.
“...Okay. Then I’ll talk to Sam.” Dean spoke as he noticed the dogs coming back from the woods. “Cas, can you take Gabriel and get the meat ready. I will be back.” Dean leaned down kissing Cas before he whistled for Sam to come to follow him away.
“Oh, it for SURE Is the milk man’s baby.” Dean snorted annoyed as Castiel continued to laugh.
“W-We should go before we get in trouble.” Benny took his hand pulling him along as they went back to the servant quarters where Jo stood on the stairs up to the second floor.
“A little. It’s tender.” Sam explained as Gabriel continued to tend to it. Sam laid on his free paw watching Castiel and Dean eating. “...Any progress with Castiel?”
“You think you can not eat the human queen or prince?” Crowley asked.
“Sounds like him.” She spoke before adding. “I’m Joanna. Most people call me Jo. Any friend of Sam and Dean is a friend of mine.” He wanted to correct her on the friendship comment with Dean but decided to keep his mouth shut.
“It’s all the light we have,” Lucifer spoke as Michael made a light with his powers, even with the lights the room seemed dark. Castiel weakly screaming as the baby came whether he wanted him to or not. Castiel felt this delivery was so hard, Dean weakly reaching up to hold his hand as Castiel held him back. It wasn’t till the sound of a baby crying made Castiel look down. Michael holding a small pale baby.
“The baby is coming.” Dean breathed as Sam nodded laying Dean on the grass and flowers before Sam took off his gloves moving to check Dean. Dean sat up slightly as Sam noticed how close Dean was.
“Sam, no! It’s dangerous!” Gabriel ran out.
.” The boys rolled their eyes as Dean waved his hand closing their homework books.
“I know.” Castiel breathed running his fingers through his hair. “I...I just wanted to find someone…”
“The idiot was talking to himself-” Adam spoke.
________________________________________________________________________
“Wow, this is amazing,” Castiel stated astonished. “This is so cool.”
___________________________________________________________________________
“Why, worried they will see you?” Dean mocked as Castiel gave him a look before he pulled off his top, kicking off his shoes. Dean turned away out of respect as Castiel grabbed a nearby top that looked like it fit before he put it on. Castiel then slid on the jeans, before moving to check out the shoes. He had to admit, it was nice being in regular clothes again. Finding a pair of shoes, he slid them on. “Ready?” Dean asked as Castiel nodded.
“No, it’s too dangerous-” Gabriel stood stopping Sam from going.
“W-What are you saying?” Dean asked as Castiel pulled out a ring.
“He is an ass.” Castiel chuckled.
“Come on. I want to show you something.” John spoke as Sarah got up tiredly moving to follow him. They walked higher and higher up the mountainside which, Sarah would have given up on if it wasn’t for John telling her they were almost there.
“Yes.” Castiel nodded, turning to look at the drawing, still tracing the drawing. “We call them
“We can go to the office.” Castiel started as Dean tensed with worry. “And I’ll relax while you try to do my job. I’ll judge this more then.”
“Won?” Dean sat up and turned to him, he looked so hollow at those words. “I won? This is what winning looks like?!” Castiel said nothing as Dean stood grabbing some pills by his counter but Castiel reached over to snag them away. Dean was faster popping whatever random pills were in the bottle. “Get out.”
“Sorry, dude, you woke up,” Castiel spoke as the man closed his eyes grunting in annoyance putting a hand up to shield his face from the water. Dean blinked a couple of times before Castiel stood walking out. “...Take a shower, you stink.”
“I know people talked about how BEAUTIFUL they are, and he really is! Horse is very very Beautiful.” Castiel stated excited to go back out to the horse, he was eating quickly. When he finished he grabbed Dean’s hand and pulled him towards the door.
_____________________________________________________________________
“Some of us need a day job.” The man chuckled before he turned to her. “When they get back in contact with you, let them know I will reserve a table for them every night at my restaurant under the name Dérobé. They can come at any time and they will be safe with us.” Rowena nodded as Gabriel tipped his hat to her politely before he turned to shove his hands into his pocket walking away. Rowena wondered if she could trust him, but...he had more to lose by trusting her.
” Dean whispered back leaning in to nuzzle against him. Castiel closed his eyes enjoying the affection, Castiel let out a shaky breath. “...Don’t you get it yet?.... I’m in love with you.”
“It is going to be forever,” Dean spoke but Castiel didn’t correct him. They didn’t look at each other as Castiel continued to eat. He wasn’t sure if Dean was lying to him or...lying to himself about the truth. No matter if Dean could swing it, Castiel would have to mate the pirate king.
with you?” Mary hissed moving to Gordon and shoved him back against the wall. “Leave them alone, or else you will have to deal with me.”
“I know. But...They’ll figure it out.” Dean stated. Castiel rubbed his face.
“Not... that book,” John spoke as Dean put it down quickly grabbed another. When Amber fell asleep Dean got up. Wiping his lip again as he walked out of the room, closing the door behind him. “Cute seeing you read your mother’s book to kids. Funny because you killed your own mother.”
“I’m sorry,” Castiel stated.
“Colonel!” Dean called as well, Mary let go of the dogs who ran up to them happily wanting attention and love. Castiel and Dean pulled the rings attached to their collars. Mary called them back as Lucifer ran to her.
Gabriel’s eyes opened weakly seeing Castiel and Dean standing in front of the cabin window. Taking in the darkness outside, how long was he asleep. Dean looked upset and Castiel was trying to comfort him.
“You look tired, you didn’t sleep well last night?” Chuck asked as Dean eyed him.
Castiel put on the tv, deciding on something educational. Maybe he can learn while Castiel was at work. Castiel led Dean to the couch and had him sit.
Castiel thought he felt Dean’s lips against his neck, his skin but he wasn’t sure. Dean could have him, take him, touch him, taste him. Castiel wouldn’t object. Part of him hoped Dean ravaged him. Took him right here, right now. Claimed him and made him his. Then he would have no choice but to deny the pirate king.
Gabriel was talking to him about the tv show Sam and him were watching, Dean’s mating mark was now healed and his arm was able to be used completely. Castiel and Crowley have been doing an attempt of damage control and though Castiel said he didn’t need to.
“I sold them to my ride for a lift here, Amigo,” Ash stated as he showed off. “Borrowed your apron to cover my nips hope you don’t mind. They are sensitive to changes in the weather.”
“Wow!” The kids gasped looking Dean up and down, Ben moved to circle him.
“...Sorry.” Castiel hesitantly breathed as Dean shied away from the apology.
Dean stood brushing the slightly damp dirt from his clothes before he offered Castiel a hand. Castiel accepted it with a nod of a thank you. Castiel standing, his slightly damp clothes also brushed off the dirt that clung to them. Sam sent a disapproving annoyed look to his brother who smiled awkwardly knowing he was going to get words.
“Do...you want to be my husband?” Sam asked as Gabriel sniffed.
“I can’t believe you’re mine.” Sam breathed so softly Gabriel almost believed Sam hadn’t meant for the words to be heard, that...those words were meant for Sam alone. Gabriel turned softly staring at the Alpha as Sam cupped the side of his face. Eyeing him with love and care. “...I want to ask Castiel’s permission to mate you.”
“Just felt right.” Gabriel shrugged innocently. “I don’t know. I just...when my father asked me, I just said yes. There’s not really much more to it. I said yes because it felt right. I don’t know why you expect more than that answer.” Gabriel chuckled innocently. He wasn’t annoyed or anything, just curious why Castiel expected more. “Mating should happen because they feel right.”
“It’s cold out here,” Dean stated. “Yet, I can always find you out here.”
“Everyone, out of the limo!” Castiel grabbed for the door handle getting out of the car, Benny and Crowley got out as a rocket launcher shot towards the limo, making it explode on impact. Crowley blew back by the blast being knocked out.
Castiel poured some hot water into some cups for them, making some tea as they waited for the dogs to come back with the meat they needed. Castiel walked over to the porch offering Dean his cup as Castiel moved to snuggle next to him by the outdoor fire they made to relax at night. Dean held the blankets open for him as Castiel moved to hold Dean as they warmed by the fire.
“W-... We can’t. Fuck.” Dean panted squeezing his eyes shut as he held their foreheads together.
…” Dean whispered so softly that Castiel’s rage ceased being snapped out of it by those words. Dean looked down ashamed, Castiel eyed him. He didn’t think...Demons would care about things like this. Dean’s instinct is to make deals. But Dean hesitated… He hesitated because Castiel asked him to.
Would Dean be able to restrain himself from mating when he wanted nothing more than to tend to the skin that should be his?
“...Joshua.” Castiel breathed as they looked over his being.
“What are you doing?” Dean asked.
Dean kneeled placing the flowers at their feet. Castiel kneeled next to him doing the same. Dean pulling out some berries and other remnants of their breakfast into a small bowl at their feet. Dean bowed his head and began to speak. Castiel lowered his head with care respecting Dean and his religion.
“Might want to get your watch checked, dude.” The man chuckled. “...It’s Friday, October eighteenth.” Castiel was taken back confused turning to look at him for a second. The man, however, had turned and was already running the way he came as Castiel went back to his run.
“Sam should have been back by now.” Dean panicked. Gabriel blinking his headache away.
“I-I don’t feel well, Mommy,” Gabriel spoke as Dean sucked in air. “M-Maybe we should cancel?”
“Even with the slight smell?” Dean joked.
“MY TURN, FUCKERS!” Lucifer the dog called as the couple broke apart, Lucifer jumped into Dean’s arms holding him. Dean grunted as Lucifer licked his face. “My dance! My dance!”
___________________________________________________________________________
“Then why are you bothering me?” Stevie asked.
“How is homework going?” Dean asked as the boys nodded watching their brother still healing from a breakup. He was still going through it, but he was healing...he was getting better.
“Your brother was in school to be a doctor right?” Michael stated.
“Gabriel!” Castiel turned towards the direction they went as Gabriel cursed turning to get off the freeway.
“Show some respect to your queen,” Crowley stated as Eve blinked in surprise.
“Demons aren’t supposed to interact with humans. For any reason.” Chuck stated. “During the night to capture and eat are different. Even though Castiel is Castiel, he wasn’t allowed to break the rules either. By his choice when he signed the treaty. Things changed when he met you.”
“I’ll get the horse, you can take a bath,” Castiel stated moving to throw on his pants.
“So...human tradition is we normally celebrate birthdays,” Dean stated moving his hands away from Sam to touch Gabriel’s hair. “I thought it would be nice to invite kids over and celebrate Gabriel’s birthday preferably in three days.” Dean lovingly pet Gabriel’s hair.
“I-I won’t let that happen! I never would!” Castiel sniffed. “...I-I permit you to mate Sam. W-We both know Balthazar couldn’t have survived...Once Sam claims you, we just have to wait twenty-four hours.”  Castiel rocked him as Gabriel whimpered tears in his eyes. His master nuzzling him with love. “I-I’m sorry, you know I never had a choice but to accept.”
“Thank you,” Castiel stated moving past him, but Roman stopped him.
“Sam, help him,” Dean spoke as the ten-year-old looked in the bathroom again.
“Some demon kids?” Castiel asked and then paused. “...Why preferably in three days?”
“A-About what you saw-” Dean choked as the fae grabbed the glass with his fingers.
______________________________________________________________________
“Humans. I smell some. A Group a bit down the road.” Castiel stated lazily.
“I-It’s okay, your body is asking more energy from me…” Gabriel swallowed Gabriel’s hand moving to Sam’s hardened cock experimentally touching it. Sam let out a low groan as Gabriel blushed. “It’s okay, Sam. Let your body take what it needs from me.”
“R-Right.” Dean choked realizing how serious this is. “Got it, staying inside.” Castiel nodded.
Castiel woke in the white room once again seeing Jack smiling at him. Jack laid in the bed looking down at his mommy as if he was waiting for mommy to wake up. Castiel smiled softly touching his soft cheeks.
.” Castiel spoke. “We can start small with just one branch and work up. I’m just a bit worried since you are so young.”
“I can’t speak to the trees,” Castiel spoke seriously as Dean chuckled loudly.
Dean eyed him as Castiel ushered him to follow him. Dean followed him into the bedroom, moving to his drawer. The one Castiel had cleaned out for him, grabbing his ‘pajamas’ as Castiel called them. Castiel changed in the bathroom only coming out when Dean said he was dressed.
“It gets better,” Dean commented. “I have a whole list of things I want to show you. The world is ours, Cas. There’s so much out there for us.”
“Cas...Are you saying you would marry me if I asked?” Dean asked as Castiel nodded.
“Good morning, Can we get a small black coffee and a large mocha frap?” Dean asked paying before he stood waiting next to the counter for their drink. Castiel eyes Dean with love as Dean pulled him close. Ever since they came out, their whole world changed forever. Castiel never felt freer. Castiel didn’t have a huge speech or anything. He and Dean just went on a date holding hands in public. They went to the city, they had fun. Castiel even kissed him in front of the public.
Castiel straddled Dean once they were naked, not waiting for a moment more he sat up holding Dean’s dick under him. Dean cursed under his breath as Castiel lowered himself down on his hardened cock. The sex was hard. There were so many desperate touches and kisses. That Castiel wasn’t sure when he began or where he ended. Dean’s grunts in his ear were heavy, Dean holding him close as he pounded the omegas hole like his whole mission in life was to make him cum.
_________________________________________________________________________
“Sam no! It’s too dangerous-!” Gabriel called but Sam was already gone. “You BOTH are going to give me an aneurysm.” Gabriel sped through the stoplight to get back onto the freeway to get back on the right path.
“That’s because we are their masters. Besides. Gabriel is already promised to another sacred…” Castiel stated.
“Mommy rabbit said to the baby rabbit, Leo you better leave before you wake up your siblings, for if you don’t, you will have to put them asleep all by yourself.,” Dean stated in a reading voice, as the girls lightly breathed almost completely asleep.
“Firm handshake,” Ellen commented.
“I mean, if given all the brain you need, will you be able to not try to snack on the humans in the castle?” Crowley asked
Michael slept peacefully against his bed, Lucifer held him close as Balthazar raised his head from the bed. Balthazar whimpered in pain as he held his head like it burned. Michael awoke with a hiss, the scars lighting upon his body.
blame you.”
“I am so glad you like it!” Anna looked around. “I saw your vision the second I walked in here.”
“Could we get the burger with extra pickles? Two?” Castiel smiled up to the flight attendant who smiled going to get the pre-made food. Castiel leaned in to kiss Dean’s neck kissing his mating mark. “Thanks for putting my mind at ease, I was starting to think it was the milk man’s baby.” Castiel teased as Dean snorted.
“Why do you think?” Dean asked.
Castiel should have taken the news maturely, but he didn’t. He was childish, he turned to look at Dean who looked just as shocked. They...both knew this was coming. Maybe Castiel hoped this...never came. Maybe he hoped they would never find anyone worthy of him. Maybe...he hoped it somehow could have been Dean...like he always imagined. Dean has been by his side since he was six, Dean was eight.
“Dean, you don’t have to-” Castiel tried but Dean was already calling for Michael’s help with groceries, Castiel sighed with love hanging up when the office door opened with a knock. Castiel glanced up seeing the pieces of Dean in a man he never met before.
“I’m okay,” Benny stated as Crowley moved to sit up more. “Hey, be careful-”
a good boy.”
“...Your hunting got in the way,” Castiel spoke as Dean shrugged.
“Wow...In four months we could have a child?” Dean asked as Castiel hesitated and nodded. He couldn’t help but touch his stomach at his soft innocent pure happiness.
__________________________________________________________________________
“He sounds like an ass,” Dean commented.
“You might not want a witch, but there is fae that will give you the world for me,” Dean stated. “I have siblings, I can’t risk it. That’s why I tried to hide it.”
“Ah, yes. I forget you guys are nature freaks.” Dean breathed seeing his breath. Castiel gave him a loving smile. “You guys can speak to the trees.”
“See you in a bit!” Mary spoke before she eyed Ash. “Get in the car, Ash.”
Castiel let out a small moan before Dean slid the condom on his own cock. Dean kissed him once again, taking the time to enjoy him. Dean’s lube covered fingers moved to Castiel’s hole. “It’s going to be a bit uncomfortable till you adjust.” Castiel nodded desperately as Dean slid his first finger slowly in. Taking him time to adjust him to his fingers and soon his cock.
“You know what they say, another man’s trash and all-” Dean smirked as Castiel tossed his drink in his face.
“You’re knitting again?” Sam asked. “You haven’t done it since…” Sam paused...since mom and dad abandoned them…
“Should have woken me up.” Dean breathed. “I could have kept you entertained.” Dean pressed kisses against Castiel’s skin before Castiel stopped him.
“Nice to see you, Master Castiel.” Rowena smiled. “I’m glad to see you well.”
“Mom...did you mean what you told me earlier?” Dean asked as Mary looked into the rearview mirror and smiled at him.
_________________________________________________________________________
“Okay…I think.” The Fae sat up holding his head in slight pain. Dean felt guilty for the pain he caused him. “…I must have hit my head hard because I have no idea who you are…do I know you?” Dean gave a sad soft smile.
“I don’t care about that,” Gabriel whispered kindly, Sam paused at the words. “You’re my friend, Sam...I could care less.”
“What we did...we did because we love each other,” Castiel whispered back in tears. “...I think I’m in love with you, Dean.”
“I WON’T LET YOU HAVE MY BABY!” Dean screamed in an uncontrollable rage as he continued to slam his fist against the wall. “ YOU HEAR ME! YOU CAN’T HAVE HIM!” Dean screamed as loudly as he could when his whole body shuddered against a nauseating amount of pain. The sound of something dispensing made Dean look up towards the wall.
“Nothing, I was just curious why a human needs to be awake waiting for his parties to end.” Chuck blinked with suspicion. “Aren’t they all night?” Dean turned when his order was called.
“Jessica?” Sam choked as Gabriel hung up.
the likes of you.” John snapped. “I wanted you gone because of what you are?”
“And the storm? Did you notice how bad it is out there?” Castiel continued to hit it.
Castiel wasn’t sure who kissed who but Dean let out this little moan the second their lips connected. The kiss was sloppy and hard, to the point Castiel was sure they smashed teeth at first impact. However, it took a second for the kiss to calm as they kissed each other. Allowing their lips to linger, pulling back slightly as they panted. Dean hesitantly let go as they turned away panting, catching their breath.
Castiel beamed happily at that as Dean moved the phone. Castiel watched Dean raising his shirt exposing his baby bump. Castiel watched curiously as watched Dean place a small little cup of water on his belly. Castiel watched as the cup moved to tilt and wiggling, Dean barely caught the cup when the baby pushed it over with a jolt.
“ME MOMMY! I DO!” Leo laughed.
agenda.” Dean stated seriously getting in his face. “...Why should I allow either of you to have me?”
“What are you looking for?” Castiel whispered.
“So girls might seem complicated, but it’s all in the eyes and body language,” Dean stated. “You can totally read if a woman is into you or what their intentions are.”
“M-Michael.” Lucifer sat up as Michael cradled his chest as he might bust in pieces. Panting in pain as Lucifer cradled him.
__________________________________________________________________________
“Nice to meet you,” Castiel spoke as he reached out to shake his hand.
Dean sat eating dinner while Castiel worked next to him, he seemed to be writing a letter to someone. Dean watched him curiously scribble words with his pen, Castiel mumbling to himself as he checked over his notes. Once the letter was complete and signed, Castiel turned to him innocently enough.
though.”
“...You can pretend you didn’t see it.” Castiel breathed softly. “But I can’t.” Castiel closed his eyes remembering the blood.
“Every meal. I will come. I won’t leave till you eat. We don’t have to talk but you will eat and when we eat, you will not drink liquor.” Castiel grabbed Dean’s beer bottle taking it to the window and tossing it out. Dean complained but stopped when root beer was shoved into his hand. Castiel sat next to him staring to dig into his burger saying nothing. Dean choked out a few syllables not sure what to say, and frankly too exhausted to think of a comeback. “You want me gone. Eat it quickly. Once your plate is clear, I will leave. Got it?”
“I-I couldn’t find him,” Sam spoke looking back at the stairs, he had volunteered to find him...so his father didn’t have to find him. But they all feared the worst... Lucifer walked up the stairs and sat next to Sam panting.
“Anything with you Dean...is my happy ever after…” Castiel breathed as he softly pulled Dean into an easy soft kiss. Dean kissed back hungrily, pushing him back into the bed. Castiel panted when Dean broke the kiss to yank and tug Castiel’s underwear free from his body. Castiel choked when Dean ripped them off him without care. Gabriel was going to wonder why he was one underwear short. “
“It doesn’t smell like it will rain,” Castiel commented but Dean continued, he pulled the Donkey towards a large tree where he helped Castiel off the donkey. The second Castiel’s feet touched the ground, it started to rain. Castiel glanced up in surprise watching water pour around them.
Castiel felt Dean’s abs, felt the little scars against his fingertips. Castiel broke the kiss to take in the number of scars on Dean. There were so many...so many...Dean seemed to shy from his eyes but when Castiel moved to open Dean’s pants, Dean seemed to grow confident from Castiel. Moaning as Castiel slid a hand inside to cup Dean’s hardened member. Castiel pulled the remainder of Dean’s clothes off, moving to his knees. He didn’t know what he was doing but...he couldn’t help but want to touch him. Castiel slid his fingers against Dean’s hardened cock, cupping his cock with soft shy touches.
“I can bend down.” Dean chuckled as Castiel raised an eyebrow.
Dean backed the car out of the house before he sped out of the apartment. Castiel’s whole body was in shock as Dean sped down the street, both hands clenching the wheel. Castiel pulled down the passenger mirror, looking at the bleeding injuries on his face. He has never been hurt before. Castiel tasted his blood in his mouth, his eyebrow was pouring blood, and most likely needed stitches.
“Of course,” Castiel called as Dean came back with bacon which Castiel snagged one. Castiel pulled Dean close kissing his forehead. “The biggest baby, and we have toddlers.”
“I asked for yours, but you didn’t give it.” Crowley raised an eyebrow.
“You won’t need him on my ship,” Alastair spoke unimpressed. “My men will not touch you. You are mine.”
“Help you...breed?” Castiel asked.
“Sam! SAM!” Lucifer’s collar went off as he begged for scrap. Sam turned to him as he sighed offering the bread he was eating. Lucifer munched on it happily. Castiel looked around the table before noticing the twins had excused themselves sometime during the dinner. Castiel didn’t even notice them leave, Castiel jumped when he noticed the twins standing right behind him.
“...After seeing Joshua.” Michael reassured.
“Shit. Ouch.” Dean moved to hold his foot, slipping on the tea water, and almost slammed back into the glass and counter when arms scooped him up catching him. Dean blinked taken back glanced up at the fae who held him.
, Dean!” Castiel cursed. Dean was in a fit of laughter once again as Castiel yelled at him how stupid that was and that he could have gotten hurt.
“Dean just lives upstairs. He doesn’t know your coming.” Joanna went to a to-go bag she had beside her. “Take this up to him, will you? Might smooth things over with food.” Castiel hesitantly took the food, still comprehending that…Dean hadn’t known he was coming. “First door to the left, pass the employees only and up the stairs.”
Dean could tell Castiel and the man were brothers just by looking at them. Or at the very least closely related. He was too young to be Castiel’s father. The woman, however, must have been their mom. Right age. The door opened to the bathroom when Dean heard a weird swirling sound which Castiel paused seeing the photo in Dean’s hand.
“You can leave, I’ll tell my brother you tried your best,” Dean started putting his feet up on the coffee table.
“What are the heels?” Jess asked as Charlie took her hand walking her back in the van.
Sam sat defeated in the water as Dean washed his fur, Sam pouted in his wolf form just letting Dean do what he wanted since he was already wet.
“No! I just woke up! I don’t want to go back!” Dean slammed back against the wall trying to get away from him as Dean slid down the wall holding his head cradling himself. “P-Please! I’ll be good! Don’t make me sleep!”
“I’m so proud of you, pup!” Castiel laughed as he put him down ruffling his hair.
“GO AWAY! ” Eve slapped his hand away and turned pulling the covers over her head. “...I’ll tell the king myself what I did. Maybe if Lilith has nothing left, he can find her a good home where she doesn’t have to suffer anymore...Now go away.” Crowley sighed with sadness as he eyed her before he got up turning off the light to let her rest.
“John.” The dog huffed. “My name is John and
“Alright, you are done,” Sam spoke transforming back into a wolf, Dean got out of the water drying himself off before getting dressed in the new clothes he bought. Dean came out with Sam, Castiel smiled at them before moving to him to offer him some breakfast.
“Prince Castiel.” The queen greeted as everyone bowed, when Metatron, her son, was too busy picking his nose to notice didn’t. The queen slapped him on the back of his head and he got the hint. “Welcome to our kingdom, we were sent word of your arrival once your carriage had the misfortune of being damaged. Please come this way, we have a room prepared and a ball in your honor planned for tonight. We also have fresh clothes for you and your companions. My maid will show you the way.”
Dean looked forward again as Castiel eyed his head before picking out the hairs carefully making sure they had the root. Dean frowned at the slight pinch of pain but was fine. Castiel sealed it into an envelope and wrote on it in concentration before licking a stamp and slapping it on the envelope. Dean watched him curiously.
“Shit.” Lucifer stood quickly as Lucifer grabbed for Michael scooping him up trying to use his power to keep the beast and Michael from ripping apart. “BENNY!” Lucifer screamed as the large hell hound walked in, watching the poodle start to seize. The hell hound moved to the poodle in worry as Lucifer’s command brought him to a stop. “Bring the corgi here. The Sacred Gabriel. Kill anyone but the angels if they get in your way.”
“You said was?” Michael asked.
you, baby.”
“Did another man pop in here?” Dean asked. “Tall, long hair, looking like a kid in a candy store being in history?”
“The ‘Oh shit, I might pregnant’ run.” The woman laughed. “Sorry, I should introduce myself, I’m Charlie.”
“No, you will not be going to the office,” Dean commented as Castiel shut up. Sam’s eyes drifted to Dean and Castiel. The awkwardness filled the room. Were they fighting?
____________________________________________________________________________
“We came looking for you,” Alastair spoke coldly putting it away. “You were due to go through here. So we just...waited. Noticed the fire. Now that you’re here, we can return the high prince and queen.” Castiel watched him whistle as his mother and brother were dragged off the ship.
Dean opened his eyes as he slowly took in the empty bed beside him. Dean pulled the sheets to his body sitting up when he noticed the armor was gone. Dean’s breath was stuck in before moving to the secret compartment on the floor. He pulled off the floorboards hoping to find the armor but it was gone. Dean cursed and moved out of the bedroom holding the sheets to his body as he walked into the living room. The boys sat at the table eating breakfast seeing Dean’s pale face.
“Do you have any friends in mind we could interview that might know anything more, Gabriel said you had a better handle on his friends?” Michael stated. Joanna nodded going through her phone grabbing some numbers.
“I hope so.” Dean breathed. “I wanted him to let go of me, not of life.”
“This should help as a lubricant.” Dean breathed as Castiel took it from his shaking hands.
“Ten years from now, at this very second...you will be mine.” Dean breathed his voice was soothing. Even now Castiel felt the pull to the words that snagged him at the crossroads. “Agreed?”
“You don’t have to.” Sam choked out blushing.
“I feel like I don’t even know you anymore, Crowley,” Benny started blowing out smoke.
Blue eyes slid over the blue skies, watching the white fluffy clouds slowly move across the sky. The meadow was slightly damp but he didn’t care. Coming out here was his favorite part of the day. When it wasn’t unbearably hot, and the wind blew just right.
Gordon’s eyes widened as he yelped in fear, bolting towards the closest way to get out of harm's way. Lucifer bolted towards the Winchester house and slammed the door behind him. The dog barked and growled, losing his shit at the door to the man.
She was the one that saw the match.
“They don’t mind me caring for Sam with their child,” Dean stated. “So it gives me more time with my brother.”
“No catch me, fuck face.” Lucifer barked before Dean could. Dean sighed, turning to look at Sam.
“Well, it isn’t how I wanted our...reunion to be, but...I am willing to accept your mate-” Bobby spoke.
“I guess we will make camp for the night,” Sam called to the carriage man, the carriage man nodded. Gabriel poked his head out of the carriage as Sam moved to his horse to the window. Sam’s fingers brushing Gabriel’s that held onto the window opening. With a soft brush of the knuckles, Gabriel took the foreign touch with care, sliding his finger up to softly cup his pinky finger keeping it there for a moment more. “We are setting up for tonight. Go with them if you need to use the facilities, otherwise, just come to me when you need to go. I will escort you.” Gabriel nodded his head as Sam moved his horse away from the carriage before he climbed off.
However, Lucifer moved through him. Like...completely through him. Like Castiel...wasn’t there. Castiel shivered in surprise at the feel, watching the officers in shock move up the stairs. Castiel panting as he tried to wrap his head around this. How did they
“...Is that normal? To sleep for eighteen years?” Castiel asked as Dean shrugged.
“Wow.” Castiel breathed as he examined the snowflake.
bitch. Act like it.”
“But...you just might with him.” Dean beamed as Gabriel blushed. “...Gabriel I think you are both good for each other. Sam smiles now…and so do you.”
“N-No.” Dean tried sobbing but Castiel cupped his face forcing him to look.
“Yum, fox.” The second man pointed the gun at the hole as the first man laid down on his stomach pointing his gun into a hole.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Castiel asked as Dean sighed.
“You’d know what I tell them?...
“Why Sam Winchester? Didn’t you used to say he’s such a stick in the mud?” Castiel asked turning to him, this time earning a face in response.
“No.” They both spoke at the same time as Sam leaned back into the chair. He watched them as the awkwardness continued.
mercy?” Sarah spoked in tears.

“It rains every day now,” Adam commented sadly. “It’s hard to play outside unless we leave the property and we can’t do that unless we are going to town.”
Azazel, contently laid in John’s arms, reached out grabbing his ‘costar’ nearby him, and started to eat the sunflower seed.
“Lilith.” Eve moved to touch her but she was sound asleep with a brand new sippy cup.
“...Are you going to kill us?” Eve spoke trying to be strong. “...The king is going to be mad.”
“You promised-” Castiel choked out hurt but Dean chuckled at the lustful wanting omega.
“If you encouraged me I would have given up by now.” Dean shrugged as Castiel shook his head. Dean always made his accomplishment a ‘we’ thing.
“There’s no need,” Dean reassured moving to get food for him. “You getting well is all we care about.”
“If you guys are going to be in town for a bit, I have a restaurant. Come have a meal on me.” Gabriel handed over his business card as Charlie beamed taking it.
“In the future...That’s normal for people.” Dean ran his fingers through his hair. “I’ve...never done it but...I know others do.” Dean blushed not wanting to say he got off on gay porn every so often because straight porn was boring him.
“Could you not sleep?” Castiel smiled at him.
“What
“W-What...What does it matter?” Gabriel choked out as Castiel cursed in worry.
“If you can tell me the last time you ate and what it was, I’ll leave,” Castiel spoke chewing as Dean frowned at that. Too tired for a lie.
Dean worked the frosting on the cake he baked after putting the kids to bed. The party was the next night where the boys were going to have a sleepover. Castiel invited some kids over to have a sleepover with the boys. Castiel made sure it would be some that...
“Then...let’s go home,” Castiel spoke nuzzling him before he helped the boys into the carriage. Castiel helped Dean onto the front where he climbed up to lead the horses. Dean closed his eyes laying his head on Castiel’s shoulder. “Let’s go men, protect your royal family.”
“John.” Sarah spoke as John looked at her as she walked with him. “I...I left my family because they wanted me to mate someone I didn’t love.” John glanced at her. “That’s why I’m out here...alone.”
“Stop.” Castiel snapped.
happiness to them not to scare Jack showing the Shug saying he wanted toes.” Jack giggled as he looked down at the drawing. “They eat toes?!”
It was only a week ago the match was decided. Sure, Castiel understood Sam was destined to take over Benny’s position as captain of the guard. He would have control of the entire army of the twelve kingdoms. But...Gabriel wouldn’t have agreed because of the power or wealth Sam would have. It was something else. Though he didn’t mention what that was that made him say yes.
“Damn, I’m going to be careful. He’s going to steal my mate.” Dean coughed roughly as Castiel went to get him some more water when he dropped the cup touching his belly.
“...I can think of a couple of things you can do.” Crowley whispered as he cupped the side of Benny’s face leaning down.
“Ready?” Sam whispered as Gabriel nodded. “...go!” Gabriel bolted after the rabbit, the rabbit barely had time to react as he turned to run from the dog. Gabriel opened his mouth to bite him grabbing the rabbit by the leg, Gabriel clamped down as the rabbit tried to continue to getaway. Kept trying to repel himself forward but they both knew it was pointless. The rabbit collapsed simply, it’s chest heaving as it accepted it wasn’t going anywhere.
Don’t get too close, Dean.

“And now, for the couple's first dance as Husbands.” The DJ spoke once dinner was done, the cake had been cut and now...it was just their moment...their first dance. Dean and Castiel moved to hold each other as they spun slowly in each other’s arms. Castiel smiled into Dean’s eyes as ‘If you love her’ by Forest Blakk played.
“Get up, I’m not making dinner, I am too tired after working all day. Get dressed and get in the car, we are going to the Mexican place downtown.” John got up with a grumble moving to get dressed as Mary walked back to the car and climbed into the driver’s seat. She faked a happy smile to Dean as Dean smiled back. John got into the car after a few minutes, putting on his seatbelt.
“You steal it?” Claire asked as Dean shook his head no.
“I got more supplies and some other stuff we might need,” Dean stated as cleaned Castiel’s other wounds making sure they were okay before he pulled his hands back taking off his gloves.  “We need to ditch the car.”
“No,” Castiel started looking at the girls with hesitation.
“Yeah, I just feel up to it. Especially since there aren’t really clothes for wings that can keep them warm.” Dean stated. “I also got you guys some new clothes for winter since it’s coming up.” Dean wrote down the measurements on his hand before he sat down pulling out the yarn. Gabriel paused noticing a small fluffy thing sticking out of one of the bags. “G-Gabriel don’t!” Dean blushed roughly as Gabriel pulled our a medium-size dog plush, it was black and fluffy...just like Castiel.
“Yeah, just okay.” Dean shrugged.
“You can have it,” Dean commented annoyed as Castiel tasted his food.
“W...Wayward.” Dean coughed out blood pouring from his lips. He could feel the blood in his lungs, breathing was hard. His eyes kept threatening to close as he kept repeating his final plea. “Wayward.” Claire sobbed touching him with love and care as she nodded promising him to go.
“Yeah, up in the mountains,” Gabriel spoke as Charlie smiled.
“Yes,” Charlie stated.
"That should be enough for now, I will have to monitor him to-" Alastair paused as Dean hit him hard. Alastair said nothing as Dean ripped the Iv out of his arm and stormed to the door. Dean paused but turned to look at him.
“The redhead?” Dean whispered as Castiel nodded. “She’s not bad.”
“Dean...Can I ask you a question?” Castiel took a seat on his desk. “What do you mean you slept for a long time when I asked about what you did in hell?”
“Bless you,” Meg started her heels clicking as she went to sit at the bus bench to eat. Dean eyed her for a moment before he turned to Claire who happily took her own munching on her favorite fries.
__________________________________________________________________________
“I have others checking the nearby villages as I punished you.” Lucifer started with an annoyed sigh. “...Find the boy and bring him to me. Alive. I need him to be found before they can produce...now go.”
Castiel softly stirred when the door opened next to him, Dean eyed him as Castiel sat up. Dean was holding a bag as he tapped Castiel’s leg.
“Is everything okay?” Lucifer spoke holding firewood as they were about to set up camp.
“W-What does he look like?” Joanna asked as Crowley started to tell her happily about his true love.
Dean moved to pour some hot water into two cups for tea before walking over to Castiel. Castiel took the tea blowing on it softly as Dean sat beside him on the couch blowing on his own.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked as Castiel turned to look at him.
“Are you okay?” Dean breathed with worry as Castiel nodded.
“We can switch when we get to a different town. I need to make sure Uncle Sam is far back in our rearview.” Dean started rubbing his belly as he eyed Castiel’s eyebrow wound. “...you are going to need stitches.”
“You matter, my job doesn’t,” Charlie stated. “Honestly, I would be upset if I didn’t see you again but I won’t...I won’t mistreat you because I’m just expected to.”
“My wife and I are here to help if you need anything else. My wife is usually home but if she’s not here, we are normally at the church.” Benny stated. “She’s not religious but...she is willing to pray to anything at this point for him. I am too, to be honest.”
“It’s so beautiful,” Castiel spoke into the void of the ocean as Dean chuckled looking at Castiel’s awe instead of the ocean.
“It worked. We even are making the cake to not draw suspicion. Are you guys okay?” Rowena asked as Castiel nodded.
“Fine, but can you blame me?” Gabriel blushed.
They heard screaming and gunshots from the village and woods. Mary softly ushering Dean and Adam to duck down. Quickly hoping to take the boat and escape unnoticed through the rapids. They had to be careful. One wrong turn and they could be pulled into the deadly rapids. It was a passage they all took and knew like the back of their hand. However, it took delicate practice to maneuver. It was the fastest way to get away from the village.
“...” Crowley said nothing.
“No!” The little boy broke down.
“Thank you,” Chuck spoke drinking his drink till Claire walked away. “Of course I did. A human playing house with a being that could literally kill us all with a snap of his finger? It’s important to know what company he keeps.”
“Thanks, Castiel,” Dean admitted as Castiel gave him one big smile.
“It means you have a connection to the weather. Like when you made the snow glow. You’re more connected to the sky then me who is connected to one day.” Castiel stated. “I’m connected to Thursday.”
“Thanks…” Dean breathed sincerely as Castiel turned. “...For protecting me…”
“That is a shit idea,” Dean commented, taking his hand away from Castiel’s to get a sip of coffee. “I demand a divorce after the wedding.”
“I never hit a woman but-” Gordon threatened but John moved to grab his collar.
“HOLY SHIT!” Castiel looked at Dean so happily as he looked down into the ocean as Dean started to walk him away from the shore. “Wait, where are we going?”
“Careful, a wish is something that should be taken seriously.” Dean slowly walked to him. “...What if I told you I could make one wish come true? Just one.”
“His poor brother,” Benny spoke comfortingly covering his wife in a blanket. “He came to the church so upset...He told me you guys might change this to a murder inquiry.”
“Just being with him...I don’t think of anything else.” Gabriel explained shyly.
“It hurts,” Crowley admitted holding his head before noticing they were alone. “Where’s Cas?”
“I’m so glad we ended up in Japan.” Dean looked around. “Last time I ended up in the middle of the ocean in the middle of nowhere. Not fun when you get lost on accident. It’s a lie, you know. When people say you dig down and end up in China. They aren’t on opposite sides of the earth. It’s all a show.” Castiel scoffed at the comment.
“...I have an uncle,” Castiel started looking at his food. “He wants to take my estate. He is technically the legal owner of my estate. In order to keep my land and home, I must marry.”
Castiel wondered what type of family Dean had. Dean always mentioned his brothers and his parents. However, it was more ‘They are ordinary’ when it came to more info. Castiel’s family was super mungo religious and only even talked to him because he paid their bills, but other than that...he liked the idea of ordinary...whatever ordinary was.
“No no no, it’s because I don’t celebrate.” Dean waved them off. “I don’t want anyone to make a big deal. If we can keep it to ourselves. This will be Gabriel’s big day.” Dean laughed nervously.
“Can I...um...help you?” Joanna cleared her throat as the baby cooed.
“Honestly, Castiel.” Sam breathed. “I don’t think you have a choice…I think the only way you both could heal…is together.” Castiel stood angrily giving him a look.
“Be back soon,” Castiel spoke as they left out the door, Dean happily starting on the cake.
“Yes, I can be back up.” Gabriel started.
“I know. I’m just teasing you.” Dean smiled back at him before he looked up at the sky. He raised a hand softly raised towards the firefly. Fireflies moved to his hand landing on it, Castiel watched curiously staring at the fireflies.
“Anyways, so adam thinks we had a sleepover and Sam got a week off chores,” Castiel stated beaming innocently. Dean laughed harder as Castiel chuckled with him. Castiel eyed him before he pulled Dean back into a soft loving kiss. Dean slowly kissed back wrapping his arms around him. The kiss was soft and loving before Dean pulled back moving to reach for a healing potion.
“As your queen…” Castiel paused seeing Dean opening his mouth mouthing something to him.
“...Fear.” Dean commented moving to the door easily pulling the wood from the door with his angelic strength. “...We can give them a proper burial,”
Castiel moved Sam’s but...there were no other pages under Children. Castiel grabbed Mary’s papers. Mary’s photo was a security camera still as were Johns. Castiel read the basic info on the first page, starting with her name, age, birthday, husband...and children. Castiel’s finger stopped on the names of children listed.
“You want love...not just a business arrangement.” Rowena touched his face. “It is why I agreed to help you, my dear.” Rowena smiled softly as she wiped a tear falling down his face giving him a soft kiss on the forehead.
Castiel chuckled when the water got to their knees. Castiel felt the waves crashing into him as a wave pulled him close to Dean. Castiel held onto Dean as Dean held him close.
“This is my brother’s house! I haven’t heard from him in a couple of days.” Gabriel choked out the words, seeing the cops all around and in the home.
“...Sorry I punched you.” Dean whispered softly as Castiel nodded.
“Once we get this right, right before I leave, we will throw a party,” Dean spoke helping himself to a cookie on the table. “That way I know you are on the right path when I go.”
“Dean it is then.” Castiel stood as he moved to the fridge to pull something out when his phone beeped. “Shoot, I’m late,” Castiel stated as he grabbed for his keys. “Are you hungry? Do you eat?” Dean nodded slowly. “I’ll order food to the door. Just open this door and take it when someone rings. Okay?” Dean nodded. “Stay here and don’t touch anything.”
“No problem,” Gabriel admitted, with his gifts it was easy. Jess happily chewed on the chocolate holding the bear in her arms tightly.
“Have you been locked out?” Castiel teased.
Sarah breathed in relief as she collapsed into the Den tiredly, her paw hurt like no tomorrow. She laid on the cold dirt icing it that way. Sarah glanced up at the dugout large hole under a tree, it was large for being under a tree but to be fair it was a large trunked tree. Sarah could make out the roots above her that surrounded them in a dome. The dog sat down panting after Sarah was helped in.
“...The king mated a human?” Eve asked as Crowley raised an eyebrow.
“...What about Castiel?” Joanna stated.
“Benny. Crowley.” Castiel spoke making them rip away pretending that just didn’t happen. Castiel came in with his suit jacket over his shoulder, a little dirty from the blast and covered in human blood. “I called another car here. I handled the humans. Let’s go.” Crowley spoke as he walked away. Benny and Crowley exchanged looks before Crowley quickly got up following after Castiel. Benny frowned noticeably before kicking dirt onto the fire before following after them.
Castiel moaned as he shoveled a burger into his mouth, the burger was juicy and god Castiel would never have eaten this fat inducing heart attack on the stick before. He could feel the juices spilling through his fingers as he moaned eating the burger. Dean was contently eating some fries.
“T-Thank you.” Gabriel sniffed.
“We lost track of each other after the explosion,” Benny stated. “You were bleeding after the hit. I’m sure when it was safe, he will follow your scent.” Crowley nodded as Benny moved to the fire he had made giving him some rabbit. “Eat, you need your strength.”
“...Good going,” Sam mumbled as Dean shot him a look moving towards the fae only to step on some glass completely forgetting himself.
Dean mouthing at his lover’s cock as he took his time to pleasure Misha, as Dean’s fingers prepped Misha’s hole. Misha’s glasses were skewed on his face as Misha closed his eyes biting at his fingers in pleasure. Gordon took out his camera from the holder strap on his side. Making sure his camera settings had turned off the flash. Gordon pulled the Camera up, snapping a photo of the sexual act.
“They weren’t close but that’s because my husband was married to his work. They got along great.” Joanna started with a sniff. “Besides churches are more open about gays.”
He collapsed into Castiel’s bed, missing him more than he thought he could. Just looking up at the ceiling listening to the silence of the night before getting up. Dean walked over to Castiel’s closet grabbing one of Castiel’s sweaters putting it on. He took in Castiel’s comforting scent. If you told him a year ago that he would be married to the king of all demons...completely in love...he would have said you were crazy...but now?
Sam was older than Dean by a couple of years, so he was immediately placed in guard training. When Dean became Sam’s age, and Castiel’s sister was old enough to run around with him, Dean also was placed in guard training. Despite this, even then they were inseparable.
“No, Get in the car.” John and Mary spoke as Ash got the hint sliding into the car before they headed to the wedding.
Sam heard gunshots from the front door. He leaned back into the hallway to see his father slouched against the door. Sweating and covered in blood, he reloaded his weapon.
__________________________________________________________________________
“I-I think I broke my wrist.” Claire breathed as Dean took off his jacket to tie it to keep her arm in a sling. “Ouch.”
“Look, Dean said he would watch them in the day while we are working and-” Crowley started. Benny pulled him into a deep kiss which Crowley slowly melted into but Crowley broke the kiss. “I am confused why are you kissing me?”
“How many deals do you normally make a day?” Castiel asked.
“The best.” Mary kissed him as they went to the living room to eat.
“I think he wants nuzzles,” Bobby spoke nuzzling into Booker who nuzzled back falling back onto his butt with his happy nuzzling.
“I don’t mind. You are my best friend.” Dean stated with a beam as Castiel smiled at him blushing. “Come on, come on, we have to get to the city by bus. It’s going to be a bit.” Castiel nodded quickly eating faster as Dean moved to get his pants and shirt on.
“She peed herself.” The kids whispered laughing as Dean noticed the pee puddle on the wooden floor. Dean sighed seeing her cry sadly, trying to comfort her.
“I never would have seen this in the living world,” Castiel spoke. “I never had enough time during the day to eat right let alone travel.”
“We fight it out,” Roman explained. “For more serious crimes like this. We fight to the death.”
“It happens a lot. With animals.” Dean explained pulling his hand back. “Mostly cats.”
“Sam, have you ever seen a hummingbird?” Castiel asked. Sam nodded. “Know how they never stop moving their wings and they move
“Sarah.” Bobby breathed relieved as he moved to her. Sarah closed her eyes as her father nuzzled into her. She didn’t nuzzle back knowing he would smell...her pregnancy. Bobby took a step back in surprise. “Sarah, you’re expecting?”
she thought he would match with. She kept boosting Dean up, talking about how he was a singer who loved to keep his private life private. Was looking for a down-low relationship for the time being and...maybe they could see where it would go.
“They got caught on some branches,” Sam spoke up his lie. They had ditched Sam’s and Gabriel’s bloody ones in the cave.
“Do you have your phone on you?” Dean asked as Castiel shook his head no. “Good, I ditched my phone with the neighbor after calling your mom. We need burner phones, Let’s drive out of the city before hitting a store to get some and food.”
“NO, YOU WILL BE MY DINNER!” Castiel boomed like a giant as Leo snorted and laughed being pulled back upright before Dean handed him the ice cream. Leo laughing loudly as Castiel kissed Leo’s cheek and set him down. “Go eat it at the counter since mommy can’t bend down like he used to.”
“Where are we?” Castiel breathed.
“You don’t deserve that! My siblings don’t even deserve this!” Dean sobbed as Castiel held him tightly.
“I...I didn’t mean-” Castiel spoke realizing what he was just doing. “I’m sorry, kids.” The kids nodded now feeling a lot better the king wasn’t raging. They nodded saying it was okay.
_____________________________________________________________________
“Actually this is our old house.” Dean beamed sniffing, he sounded stuff up.
Castiel groaned at his alarm the next morning, he did eventually have to go to work but for now…he had a breakfast meeting. Castiel got up rubbing his face when he noticed a text on his phone. Castiel frowned taking in the message from Sam.
“Thanks, I appreciate it.” Gabriel took the tests as a blonde woman wearing a baseball cap slightly hiding her face walked up to Charlie. She seemed awkward, holding herself tensely like she might break something if she got too close. Charlie turned not noticing how awkward she was, or not caring.
“What um...are you?” Sam asked innocently.
“I mean I slept…” Dean looked down.
“Oh, it for sure is the milk man’s baby,” Dean commented. “I just wanted to make you feel better.”
“Can I help you?” A voice called out making Castiel turn to see a younger adult leaning against the bar facing him, resting her head in her hands lazily. Castiel took in the blonde ponytail draped over her shoulder as she eyed him nicely. It was obvious by her glance at him she wasn’t sure he was welcomed here. Most likely why she didn’t greet him, didn’t expect him to stay long besides asking for the bathroom or something along those lines.
“...What’s the fun in that?” Dean mumbled as he leaned in pressing his lips to Castiel’s. Castiel smiled into the kiss as he pulled Dean closer. Castiel moaned softly into the kiss as Dean pulled back. “...Do you wanna go home? I want to go home.”
Castiel got, maybe, halfway through his count before the medicine had finally made Dean sleep. Castiel relaxed next to Dean, releasing his tight grip on him, and just stared at him for a bit. Watching Dean’s pouty lips move in-breath, Castiel let himself drift off with him counting the freckles on Dean’s face as he did.
Taking his time to slide up Misha’s tanned body to his face. He had to be careful he didn’t take too many at once or risked being caught, at one point putting on video while he also snapped photos. He took a picture of Dean’s plump lips mouthing Castiel’s cock. So sure, magazines wouldn’t take them, but he could still sell them. He had plenty of clients who would pay to see Dean sucking cock online. Though it wasn’t Gordon’s cup of tea...
“I can’t be your mate.” Dean stood moving away from him, Castiel opened his mouth to apologize. For ruining this whole thing. Was he going to lose Dean? “Do you understand how people hunt me?! How my brothers and I are on the run over and over again because of me?!”
“You reak of booze.” Dean hissed back. “I kept away because of you, I missed watching my brother grow up because of you!”
“And they just left?” Castiel looked at him with such heartbreak as Dean finished the last bites of his meal before getting up.
“I’ll put her down,” Dean stated trying to be as sweet as he could. In fear. “I’ll be back.” John moved to follow him, Dean figured as he walked her up to her bedroom. The other little girls still fast asleep, Dean slid her back into the covers. Snuggling the blanket tight around her as he touched her face. “Snug as a bug in a rug.”
“I object to this. If I am to be traveling I expect to be comfy and well bathed.” Castiel spoke using his prince’s authority. “Besides, I would rather not have us all smell like horses the entire trip.”
“....Dean-” Castiel whispered.
“What did you do?” Castiel asked with a laugh.
Castiel walked with Dean as Dean held his wrist helping him along. Castiel laughed when Dean stopped in front of a clothing store. Dean walked him in as Castiel looked at him confused.
“I’m so sorry,” Castiel whispered but everyone waved him off refusing to even comment on the apology more than you are fine, It wasn’t your fault, etc.
“Why are you telling me this?” Rowena spoke as the man eyed her.
“...The first crossroads demon I tried to make a deal with,” Castiel whispered. “I asked for the info.”
“...You need a name,” Dean spoke as the fae glance up. “At least till you remember yours, we can’t just call you mister.”
“P-Put me down!” Dean choked blushing as Castiel tossed him onto the bed. Dean frowned once free from his grasp holding himself.
“I found the boat.” A pirate spoke.
“You’re hurt,” Crowley mentioned as Benny glanced down at his bloody chest.
“I-I’m sorry.” Gabriel breathed moving to wipe his eyes. “I’m sorry.”
He continued to quickly pat himself down, it must have been on him.
“Thank you, Dean!” Sam beamed as Gabriel beamed.
Sam breathed in relief collapsing next to Gabriel as they laid in their cave,
“What the hell am I-?!” Gordon choked. “I came here for the scoop and instead I got a fucking horror movie with a fucking monster in the garage, a talking dog, and the fucking kids from The Shining who knew my fucking name!” Gordon forced himself to stand in fear. “I know your dirty little secret! I know your dating Castiel Novak and all the proof is right here!” Gordon laughed like he had the upper hand clutching his camera. “So stay back.”
“What about me?” Dean asked.
“What is your name?” Castiel turned to the first pirate who spoke.
“Aye.” The men cheered as they surrounded them following them back to the kingdom. Dean and Castiel holding each other’s hands the whole way home, where they would live happily ever after.
“W-What’s going on?” Castiel asked worriedly but he listened getting dressed.
“R-Right away.” The maid stated, Gabriel moved to walk into Castiel’s room to help him with the bath.
“We will keep you up to date,” Lucifer reassured as they left the house heading back to their door. Heading to their car to meet the next person to interview, Cain Abel.
“I don’t know. But that’s where he is.” Jack beamed touching Castiel’s face before he nuzzled back into his mother. “Mommy, can you tell me a story?”
“Aren’t you going to say something?” Castiel asked leaning against the kitchen sink.
Castiel was still slightly bothered by the man he met in his jog. Something about him rubbed him the wrong way. He breathed out a sign as he entered his out. Moving to place his house keys by the door before he went to do his daily chores.
Castiel tensed.
Castiel giggled softly before he turned his body to reach over Dean to take the flower, Castiel’s body leaning over Dean’s chest to take it before Castiel put it to his nose. Castiel half laid on Dean’s chest looking down at him.
Castiel moved to open the door but as Ellen said, Dean had managed to lock it. Castiel knocked politely but no one answered. Castiel sighed softly pulled out the key, opening the door. Castiel glanced around to see Dean managed to have made it into the bedroom, judging by the lump he could see into the doorway. Castiel put down his briefcase and took off his coat leaving it at the door before walking to the bedroom.
“-Don’t,” Dean whispered as Castiel didn’t continue. They sat in silence for a long time before Castiel spoke again.
“I can’t.” Dean whimpered in tears as Sam took his hand.
“...Vomit on your side,” Sam stated tiredly watching the corgi lay on it’s back. Sam curling into himself in his bed.
“...Did you research.” Rowena breathed trying to look casual. “To know who I am.”
“Don’t look at me like you want to kiss me.” Dean hissed as Castiel tensed at that. “Because if you do...I won’t be able to stop myself from kissing you back.”
“How did your husband feel having him around, being a priest?” Lucifer asked.
“Cas.” Dean moaned as Castiel felt confident by his moans. Touching his base with his hands. Dean cursed, gripping Castiel’s hair while Castiel sucked at his flesh. Dean pushed him back to press him against the bed in a desperate kiss. Castiel happily kissed back moving to pull down his own pants. Dean ripping Castiel free of his shirt. Laying naked against each other roughly groping each other.
He paused realizing the sound wasn’t coming from his person. His eyes fell onto a faint glowing path farther past him, under some leaves at the base of the thick trees near the ravine. He walked over to it, pushing a bunch of wet mushy leaves from on top of it.
“Stop,” Dean commented but the Limo didn’t stop fast enough. “Stop. Stop!” Dean got out of the car before it completely stopped moving to the old historical house in the park across the street. A couple of cars honked at him for just shooting across. Dean walked up to the house reading the historical plaque.
It was true, Dean as his guard would sleep in the connected room beside his. Though Castiel would never allow him in that bed now that they were close. Even Sam wouldn’t object to them in the room. It would be improper Sam to remain in here, even if he wanted to keep Dean from Cas. Sam was to be mated. It would be scandalous. But Sam cared about Castiel’s safety overall, even if Dean refused. Sam would have ordered Dean to stay. Lucky for them...
“I know what that means.” The first hissed annoyed. “It means that he calls the shots, He’s the pirate king’s mate. Even in his death.”
“Gender doesn’t matter to Angels...it’s our status,” Castiel explained eyeing Dean’s face. “...You’re an Angel, you should be able to smell the difference. Notice Sam and Gabriel’s smells. Gabriel is what I am...an Omega. Sam...Sam is what you are, an Alpha.”
“Yes, he almost finished.” Gabriel nodded. “He was working on his last assignment before the final.”
“W-What if I try to heal it?” Castiel’s hands started to glow but Dean waved him off.
Gordon blinked in surprise zooming in as he tried to get a good angle on Castiel.
Benny bolted out the door towards the Corgi, able to feel the pull making Balthazar and Michael suffer.
“I-I don’t know when that was,” Gabriel admitted. “We...don’t care about this stuff.”
“I just...was curious why we breathe?” Castiel snorted blushing. “Like you never tried.”
“It was an experience. They were so tall!” Gabriel beamed as Sam eyed him. How sheltered they were.
“I...I wanted you safe.” Sam breathed weakly. Gabriel looked at the bruises all over his body, wounds where he couldn’t tell where they began or ended.
“That makes sense,” Claire commented as she handed him the donut which Dean bit into contently. “How are you liking it?”
“Dean...Does your brother have any reason to see a neurologist?” Castiel asked as Dean shrugged.
“Come, let’s get you a warm meal.” Castiel ushered as Dean picked up the shotgun. “You don’t need your weapon.”
“No, I am just trying out your...things,” The Demon commented rubbing his chin watching Castiel move to fan the smoke alarm.
Dean sucked in air as he felt Castiel’s cock press against his hole, he shivered to wonder when Castiel lost the last of his clothes. Castiel held his waist with tender hands sliding his hands to cup the flesh on his hips. Dean held his breath as Castiel slowly started to slide into him. Dean gripping the headboard arching his back. Dean was so glad for the potion, he wasn’t sure how this thick being was fitting it inside. Castiel grunted when he pushed the last bit in. Dean could feel him so deep, Castiel let go of his hip with one hand to hold Dean’s throat gripping it enough to tilt Dean’s head back. Dean moaned at the grip on his neck as Castiel nipping at his ear.
“Lay off, twerp. He’s just trying to be a good boy, all logic of distance aside...he just wants to make Benny proud.” Dean teased back, Castiel knew he was right. Sam felt like he owed their uncle for taking them in all those years ago. This is the first big responsibility he had, he was just trying to do his job.
“He’s just being active,” Dean reassured. “He sat on my bladder all night.” Dean placed the bacon plate on his belly which the plate moved and rocked. “He’s very active right now. He’s too much like you.” Castiel beamed innocently. “All our children have your energy.”
Castiel pet Dean’s head softly, Dean was a very good test subject, he pretty much let Castiel do what he would like. Taking a few hairs? Dean didn’t mind. Dean was also...pleasant company, though Castiel hated to admit it.
“D...Daddy?” Castiel asked.
“Yes,” Castiel spoke swallowing. “You said we were getting close to the next crystal clue. How far?”
He was a secretly gay man, he wasn’t even out to his parents…

“It’s true, though he never celebrated a birthday before, I’m sure he’d be up to spoiling Dean-” Benny commented, Dean blushed harder.
________________________________________________________________________
“Not to do all I want to do to you.” Dean breathed nuzzling his face against him. “...I will take you as you want but when it is, is on my terms..
“Mention what to Cas?” Castiel’s voice made Dean sigh and turn around. Sam lit up moving to run to Castiel which Castiel picked him up without a second thought.
“I-It worked.” Castiel joked as Dean swallowed and nodded.
“A surprise.” Castiel smiled softly. “You and the kids will come with me to the private plane somewhere...nice.” Dean eyed him curiously.
“Figure you need a key if he somehow managed to lock the door,” Ellen spoke.
“You guys should go rest if you want to be up when your friends get up. We can have the ceremony tomorrow after you’ve all rested.” Bobby stated.
“I felt my spell break during this time.” Rowena turned. “I knew you must be here. This was the end of the line. Going home, you severed the connection to the past. I just wanted to make sure all was well.”
“I understand, father.” Castiel stood bowing his head and turning to leave the room. But a few steps turned into a sprint. Bolting from the room, Dean didn’t hesitate to go after him. Sam moved to accompany them as well but Castiel’s father stopped him.
“C-Cas, the party-.” Dean moaned into the kiss.
“Thanks for buying me the pepper spray.” Dean beamed as Castiel’s hand moved to Dean’s belly.
“Alpha’s don’t get sick.” Dean pouted shoving his handoff. “I gotta worry about you and baby.”
“They should have come by now,” Sam spoke. Cursing in his language that Gabriel couldn’t make out. “I should go get them.”
“O-Oh, okay.” Castiel nodded nervously pushing his glasses up on his face, Mary walked him to the living room. Castiel took in the tons of Macaroni art on the walls in picture frames. The whole house seemed full of this kind of art. “Ah, did the kids make these?” Castiel asked curiously. “They are beautiful.”
“It’s such an honor you asked me,” Charlie spoke. “Don’t worry, I got it all memorized.” Charlie beamed as Castiel hugged her again.
“Why do you always make it rain when they leave?” Castiel asked curiously.
____________________________________________________________________________
“Sit down. Please.” Castiel begged but Dean kept pacing.
“Absolutely not.” Castiel frowned.
“Come on, it’s easy. I’ll show you.” Sam lit up as Gabriel hesitated, he watched Sam’s tail wagging happily.
“Nonsense, you need to heal from the birth and your injuries,” Castiel stated. “Once you finish, I’m going to pamper you with a bath.”
“Okay,” Dean stated with a nod. Castiel moved to brush his teeth, looking at Dean as he did.
Castiel crouched down to him eyeing the sleeping man with worry as he took the beer bottle from his grasp. Placing it on the table when he noticed the pill bottles on the counter. Castiel took those into his hands reading the bottles that did not belong to him. Castiel glanced down at the man covered in vomit before he checked his pulse.
Dean took another bite trying to get some more down, managing to finish the french fry without the need to gag again. They ate in silence. Castiel managing to finish his meal, Dean getting a few bites into his burger and a majority of his fries before he came to a gradual stop to his eating.
The weather felt exceptionally better today than yesterday, Castiel didn’t have to wear his winter gloves, or his tracksuit jacket zipped up. Castiel said his normal good mornings to his neighbors in the neighborhood. Most about to start their day, Castiel moved through to his door.
“Good idea, love.” Dean took his hand softly.
“Nose?” Booker tilted his head for more nuzzling. Sam lit up gasping as Booker looked up at his father. “Nose?” Sam leaned down trying to nuzzle him, Booker nuzzling him back before falling over.
“I love you. I think you love me too.” Castiel snapped as Dean looked up at you. “You aren’t a burden to people who love you.”
“Well, we hope to see you again.” Charlie beamed.
Castiel sighed all dressed up for the first time in a while, Castiel wearing a beautiful black and white suit ready for a ball. He was to wine and dine for a party in his honor and Castiel wanted nothing more than to curl up in bed. Gabriel placed a masquerade mask on Castiel’s face smiling at how cute he looked.
“It’s a surprise.” Dean winked at him before he stood to get up offering Castiel a hand. “We have lifetimes to learn.” Castiel eyed his face before he took his hand getting up. “I got a place we can crash at.”
“Dean?” Castiel spoke before he pulled his hand back. “You okay? You zoned out on me as you did at the store. It’s...It’s scary.” Castiel eyed him, it was like Dean was a completely different person when he zoned out. Like the vibes were off. Like Dean had… darkness to him.
Dean tried to hide his shaking as he drank water sitting in the passenger seat as Castiel loaded back up the camping equipment, Castiel said he had a plan. Dean trusted him so he didn’t ask too much about it. Especially since the baby was on his bladder since he woke up and he was in so much pain from his hip. He was trying to ignore it, but just sitting hurt. Castiel got into the car noticed Dean finished his water. He did this when he was in pain.
“You deserve to know,” Dean stated. “...I just like to pretend it didn’t happen. It’s just easier to think they died and weren’t just deadbeats…”
“You said a window broke?” The man asked holding a panel of glass as Castiel slowly opened the door wider for him. Castiel pointed to the window Dean had broke when he tried to burn the house down. Castiel walked back towards the kitchen noticing Dean was watching the man. He tilted his head watching the man like a lion stalking his prey. Castiel eyed Dean slowly taking a seat next to him. Castiel slowly grabbed for his notebook writing down what he was observing.
“How do you feel?” Gabriel’s voice startled Sam’s thoughts.
“Cas-” Dean tried but Castiel held out the paper.
“It smells good in here,” Dean confessed coming in.
“M-Mudslides?” Castiel asked but Dean reassured him.
“Are they not together?” Castiel asked.
“You buried the father and child together?” Gabriel asked as Dean glanced up.
“Order for Dean.” The girl spoke before Dean turned to grab their drinks.
“Good teeth. Eyes dilate perfectly, wow. Gorgeous normal eyes when you aren’t making them glow!” Castiel beamed pushing his glasses upon his face. “How old are you? How many deals have you had-”
“...Castiel...Can you catch human illnesses?” Dean turned to Castiel who shook his head no. “...and I’ve never been sick...okay.” Dean breathed nervously as Castiel looked confused.
“It’s a hole in the wall in a shady neighborhood,” Dean stated. “You wouldn’t have known about it, Mr. Doctor.”
Starting first as playmates, Dean and Sam’s guardian was their Uncle Benny. The head of the guard. Who took them in when their parents died from a pirate raid along with their whole village. The two children only escaping the carnage by hiding in an overturned boat in the water.
“I’m okay. More than okay.” Castiel reassured as Dean smiled at him before they walked to the house to have dinner. Castiel was the last through the door which Dean stopped him from closing.
Castiel walked around to the free side seeing Dean was just laying there. His eyes slightly open in restless sleep, he made eye contact with Castiel who only kicked off his shoes and climbed in bed with him. Castiel opened the donut box he set between them and started to eat without much comment. Dean didn’t comment either softly reaching for a chocolate donut as Castiel stared at the ceiling.
“No. You’re the first.” The man shrugged.
“I’ve been practicing.” Sam beamed as Dean moved to eat giving Sam a thumbs up as he carefully ate with his stitches.
“I used to break up these underground parties all the time,” Dean admitted. “They have one every night, so since I’m dead might as well have fun right?”
“Do you remember when we were kids?” Dean spoke making Castiel pay attention. “We used to have mud baths and it drove Gabriel crazy.”
Trying to get Dean to focus on him again, but Dean moved to walk towards Castiel when Dean’s wrist was yanked back toward the maintenance man. The maintenance man slammed his lips against Dean’s as Dean’s eyes widened in surprise not knowing what to do. Dean slightly tried to push back from his chest with fear in his eyes. Seeing that fear...Castiel bolted to Dean to save him.
“-Wait, he’s got the mark.” Another spoke as their eyes fell to the mating mark on Castiel’s shoulder. Castiel looked down at the bloody mess on his shoulder. They...thought Alastair had mated him. Despite the bite, Castiel was mated to Dean. This mark meant nothing. Though they didn’t need to know that. Castiel exposed more of the mark by ripping his shirt more. “...You know what that means?”
Dean brushed out Sam’s hair which for the first time since he came...the house was dead quiet. The demons were faster than humans, the construction being completed faster than he expected. The rest of the house was able to be lived in, Castiel’s true form didn’t do much to the rest of the house. Which was lucky for them.
“Have you ever-?” Castiel asked as Dean shook his head no.
Castiel hesitated rubbing his lips together in thought, Sam expected Dean to chime in but he didn’t. Dean quietly chewing on bacon as he hummed to himself. Dean had an opinion on everything. Sam understood that Dean may have been letting Castiel decide.
“H-Hey…” Charlie choked getting Castiel’s attention again as Charlie pepper-sprayed him in the face making Castiel drop her. Charlie fell to the ground coughing as Castiel growled in pain. Charlie moving to grab the stun gun from her thigh holder she shot Castiel with an electric current which only made them pass out.
Mary placed Adam into the boat, just as Sam placed Dean in as well. Mary and Sam went behind the small boat quickly pushing the boat into the water. Mary and Sam climbed on when the boat was in the water. Mary grabbing for the paddles, she scrambled to paddle. Sam grabbed the other slowly pushing the water.
How...could he really believe Crowley could have been the one who brought out this smile?
“My family isn’t too much are they?” Dean asked as Castiel turned to him. “They...haven’t scared you away right?”
“Good idea, Master,” Gabriel spoke as he watched Castiel put the firewood in the fireplace.
Ah. It was a mistake.
“Yes.” Castiel breathed. “Like any time I see you. How did you get in anyways?”
Castiel was at first not interesting in the matchmaking experience, she insisted they would make a good match. Though she wouldn’t tell him
Castiel glanced up at Dean as Dean stared out the window of his hometown, Castiel eyed his face. Dean mentioned his family a lot but never really mentioned his life here. He said that school was uneventful and eventually he dropped out to form a band. Which ended up being the best choice he ever made...which led Dean to him.
“Are you in love with Sam?” Castiel asked without thinking as Gabriel who choked on the water he was drinking from his dog bowl. Gabriel coughed and choked as Castiel stared at him. Gabriel went deep red, the corgi just looking at Castiel in fear.
“Yes, but he beat us because he’s married first,” Charlie stated opening the door seeing a woman getting the cameras all set up. “Cas! This is my girlfriend Stevie! The one I told you about!”
“Tired?” Dean asked as Castiel nodded slightly. Dean kissed his forehead before he pulled his shirt over his head to change as Castiel eyed him with a bit more energy. Dean raised an eyebrow noticing the look. “Not as tired as you thought?”
NOVAK?!
Michael breathed as Lucifer held out a crime scene bag that Michael slid it in.
“Y-You came with me?” Dean asked.
“The hormones…” Castiel knew of these. These would fuck Dean up if he took them. These were for desperate measures. Whoever took them would kick start their mating cycle till it wore off. His body would be exhausted. Dean would be moodier, his alpha in him would be hyper-aware and all out of sorts. It would even make him sick at times.
“...We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to…” Castiel stated concerned. “It just helps to feel better sometimes to talk about it.” Dean slowly turned to him.
“She saw Gabriel.” Sam panted. “Castiel was supposed to make her pass out so she didn’t see Gabriel but if she lives now, she will tell them who we are with. They will take your baby and they will kill it. They will take OUR baby and kill it.” Sam hissed. “She needs to die-”
“Well, I have some clothes for your new world boys, you can change in the impala.” Rowena handed Gabriel and Castiel a shopping bag to change into. “And some reservations to catch.” Rowena wiggled her eyebrows before she walked towards her car. “Coming?”
“I...I don’t want to.” Dean lied as Sam made a face as Dean went back to his potions.
“D-Did that dog just talk?!” Gordon cursed in surprise before realizing where he was. He watched the dog try to find another way in leaving the back door. The house remained quiet.
“Doesn’t work?” Dean cut him off. “He can take back the baby room, come on...you already agreed to share a room and it’s not to just to get bunk beds. Why not try.” Gabriel blushed at this as Sam came in with a plate of food. Dean gasped as Sam placed the food next to him on the nightstand. “Wow! Sam! This is looking so good!”
In honor of the Destiel wedding.
“Why? He’s already alive.” Castiel patted Gabriel’s head. “Did you die without telling me? Kinda rude, I was out of town.”
“I can’t believe we can eat,” Castiel spoke with his mouth full.
“Hi, Atlas,” Dean whispered taking in his child’s large curly waves of light brown hair. He had freckles coming in, that Dean hadn’t noticed when he first saw him. Little moles covered his body as much as Dean’s did. If it wasn’t for the blue eyes, Dean would have thought the baby was his mini-me. “He...is so little.” Dean smiled looking into his eyes.
Was it Dean…?
“...We should save what we can,” Dean started taking it.
“Come on, Sam. Let’s leave them alone. I’m sure they want some time alone.” Gabriel smiled getting up before walking out with Sam. Dean watched them go as Castiel took the plate to help Dean eat which Dean moaned happily at the bite.
“Get out.” Bobby snapped as Sarah glanced up in anger. “I will not have that abomination live among my people.” Bobby shifted back moving away from her as Sarah swallowed.
“So strange,” Dean commented putting Horse in one of the stalls. “It was like this place was frozen in time, except for the spider webs. I would have thought this was in use.”
Waiting till Castiel had relaxed, Dean moved inside him. Dean moved at first slowly and easily, Castiel so lost in his moans and touches. When they got into the swing of things, Dean was pounding him on the bed. Castiel biting into his shoulder to keep from screaming in pleasure. Dean pounding him right, both seeming to know what the other needed.
“Yeah, but I got a secret power,” Dean whispered. “Something no one has.”
“Okay…” Dean pierced his lips nodding accepting the knowledge he was getting.
“Okay.” Charlie beamed as the woman moved to walk out of the store, charlie’s smile fell before running after her in panic. “Jess! Jess! W-We need to pay for that-Excuse us. Jess! Leave the security guard alone!” Gabriel watched Charlie running after this ‘Jess’, Gabriel shook his head before moving to pay for his stuff.
“What about Cas?” Adam asked.
“They sure are taking their time out there this time.” Castiel teased as Dean chuckled sipping his tea.
“I know this place,” Rowena mumbled. “Gabriel Montoya. I recognize your name too, you are a famous chef.”
Castiel came hard, not only as Dean once again hit that delicate spot inside him but… Dean’s teeth ripped and tore at his flesh claiming his unmarked body as his. Castiel arched his back in a cry as he came onto him and Dean’s stomachs. Coming harder than he had ever. Dean’s teeth bit to the bone, He felt the scraping at his bone as he clamped down. Castiel collapsed against him at his rough and satisfying orgasm as Dean growled at his claimed prize.
“Because I’m proud of you,” Benny spoke.
“MASTER CASTIEL! NO!” Crowley screamed in worry moving to follow after them dropping the blanket in the panic bolting outside. Castiel punched Benny hard, his strength making Benny see stars at the first hit. “STOP IT, CASTIEL!”
“Sorry.” Dean blinked, seeming out of it after thinking about it.
“No, I love them,” Castiel stated.
“I promise.” Dean heard her last words as everything started to grow dark.
“No...My baby will have to deal with humans and demons wanting it dead.” Castiel breathed holding himself.
“...I don’t have to worry about him...seeing he’s dead.” Chuck stated as Benny seemed shaken by the words.
” Sam snapped. “
“Just rest here till you feel better.” The dog yawned and stretched. “I brought you a couple rabbits to keep up your strength."
“Let them go. Please go see to you and your brother’s packing.” The king spoke as Sam bowed and went to do what was asked.
“I-I had an upset stomach as a pup,” Gabriel confessed blowing it off and wiping his mouth. “I-I barely kept food down. I-It must just be sensitive again.”
“You already experienced it...You’ll die again.” The man stated. “That’s why you kept dying every night. You’ll get that deadly blow every time.”
“...I don’t belong here.” Dean choked as Rowena tilted her head. “I’m from twenty twenty. I need to go back. I like burgers and shit!”
“Don’t look now, but I think Sam and Gabriel are starting to become friends,” Castiel whispered as Dean turned but Castiel lightly kicked him. “Don’t make it obvious.” Castiel snorted as Dean laughed turning back.
“Why?” Castiel snorted. “What’s so fancy at the beach now we couldn’t do while we were alive?” Dean just smiled.
“Are you expecting the prince to sit in filthy clothing?” Gabriel looked appalled.

“You did what you thought was best-” Castiel started getting annoyed.
“I’m sorry for your loss.” Michael comment.
“He’s so perfect...I hope I can mate him one day.” Crowley blushed harder. Benny felt tears in his eyes, he moved to leave. “Benny?”
“We should go see if he’s home.” Castiel offered. “It’s Saturday, he should be. I doubt lawyers work weekends.” Dean hesitated not wanting to bother Castiel with his family problems but Castiel took his hand pulling him towards the town.
“M-Maybe I can pick it up?” Rowena tried but she knew it wouldn’t work. She sighed before taking out the business card. “I have an idea. You know that restaurant
Gordon studied this house’s layout before when it was posted online after Dean bought it and knew which room was the guest room by the amount of time he studied the place. Gordon eyed the tree near the window before he climbed up it. Gordon got to the top as he eyed the room. Blessed to all the lights being on as Dean engaged in a sexual act with his lover.
_______________________________________________________________________
“Mama Novak, There’s a man here saying he’s with the AC company?” Lucifer spoke as Dean frowned not remembering Castiel mentioning the AC.
“I knew it.” Castiel laughed loudly.
“It’s Hershey.” Charlie tilted her head with a smile. “Did you want anything else?” The amazon turned to look at a small stuffed bear on a small display and grabbed it.
"Thanks, Anna." Gabriel smiled happily as Anna blinked in surprise.
“We need to find some sign of that kid,” Michael stated as they looked around. “Something I can inform his brother about or I won’t sleep.”
“How is he?” Michael asked he noticed Castiel was focusing on Dean as they rested. “Eat, I can put the paste on his wound.” Castiel hesitantly handing him over the paste as Castiel moved to eat his food. Michael tending to the wound with care. Placing paste to the wound, he noticed how sweaty Dean was. Michael touched his forehead. “He’s a little warm.”
“I’m human?” Dean chuckled. “I guess that’s what Shug bites do. I’m human till this heals.”
“Why?” Dean asked as Gabriel made a face.
“Trust me. Lucifer and Michael are so glad you were there to save them.” Castiel kissed him in a peck.
“I know this feels weird but I promise it’s going to be worth it.” Dean cooed to Sam before he got it on. “There.” Sam glanced down at the sweater as Gabriel’s tail wagged happily. Gabriel kept dodging through Sam’s legs happily bolting around.
Crowley and his assistant never stood a chance as the front caved in as though slammed into a brick wall. The front becoming an unrecognizable smashed pancake. Blood spilling from the smushed compacted front as Sam pulled himself from the van. That hurt, Sam wheezed in pain but he would live.
“You okay?” Dean breathed pulling back to look into his eyes.
“So...we are okay to stay here?” Dean asked worriedly. “They won’t come-?”
“Really?” Charlie stated as Gabriel nodded.
“I was told not to tell you, Mr. Novak.” The driver spoke as Castiel cackled. Dean rolled his eyes amused as he got into the limo.
_____________________________________________________________________________
“Lively as ever,” Castiel stated. “He wants out.”
Charlie couldn’t take her eyes off her companion, wearing a white button-up shirt and form-fitting slacks. Charlie breathed just making out the suit she wanted to rip her out of-I mean, what?
“Come on, let’s go check on dinner.” Dean hinted as he led Castiel away who watched with love. Sam pulled back wiping the blood and tears from his face as Gabriel sniffed.
“I smell blood. Demon blood. A lot of it.” Benny stated as Castiel rolled down his window enough to bring in some air.
, princess?”
“It’s because-” Gabriel moved to explain but Dean covered his mouth. Gabriel giggled just as mischievously as Sam did.
Gordon moved up the stairs in a panic, panting as he tried to think of a way out of this hell hole. A window. All he needed to do was find a window.
Sam pushed through the front door of the mansion, tossing his bag onto the coat rack coming into the living room. Dean was on the couch balancing a cake slice on his rounded belly. Sam smiled at his...wow. It was weird to have a brother.
“It’s just a precaution,” Dean reassured packing what they needed, for the time being, he moved quickly packing mostly Castiel’s stuff. Castiel moved to pack up their stuff, grabbing his brushes and other small things. “Leave it. Grab only what we need.”
“You know, you’re going to give Sam a stroke.” Dean’s voice made Castiel smile turning to look over his shoulder to see the knight leaning against a tree. “If you prolong his day anymore.”
“Thank you,” Castiel stated as Sam met back up with them.
“I know you are both into ice cream. But my mate and child need a real meal.” Castiel patted his belly.
“How are you feeling?” Dean soothed softly as the Fae blinked his beautiful eyelashes towards Dean trying to blink the sleep from his eyes.
“G-Gabe...S-Sam th-...they-” Castiel shook as Dean swallowed and nodded.
“Thanks for coming,” Castiel called as he was handed a drink. “Now you know guys know how to vibe.” Castiel comment. “Maybe not all bands here rocked tonight, but we sure ended with a bang-”
Dean kissed back just as hard, his hands moving to Castiel’s pants, Castiel wiggled out of them unable to wait till they were home. Dean wanted to mate him. Dean asked his hand to the goddess. Dean loved him so strongly, he asked the goddess for his hand. That was serious. Asking a goddess to mate was...so fucking serious. Dean believed Castiel was meant to be his. That they were soulmates. That their lives were meant to be together for this life, for the next, forever. Dean wanted forever and always with him. Though Castiel would have been happy with this life with him. Castiel at those words was happy with the blessing of forever with him.
“No, but...Come spend Christmas with me,” Dean stated.
“Dean’s at his bachelor pad with his cousin, dad, and mom,” Castiel explained. “His mom is superstitious. We aren’t allowed to see each other till I walk down the aisle.”
Now he was receiving a proper kiss, like the ones in those romantic movies you see. Castiel never thought these stupid kisses did happen. He always thought these were fictional kisses. However, as he moved his lips with Dean’s, he realized how real all those stupid kisses feel. The kiss grew deeper, the kiss grew harder, more desperate holding each other in the rain.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t-” Castiel seemed taken back but Dean just smiled softly at him.
“Ready for me to walk you down the aisle?” Mary stated.
“Who else.” Castiel hummed as Dean cursed. “Come on out, you been there a while.”
“Wait, be careful, you slam the door too hard we won’t be able to get it open,” Dean commented showing him how to close the door.
“Best serve Castiel? Hmm.” Chuck stated.
“Nose? Did you say Nose?!” Sam whimpered and whined as Booker got up himself before falling over.
“Ah, a compliment from Dean the cop?” Castiel teased back.
“Have?” Dean asked as Castiel nodded.
“...I’m sorry,” Gabriel admitted. “I just...worry.”
“Sarah’s back.” The wolves whispered as Sarah walked into the Den, no one greeted her. She knew they wouldn’t unless she was welcomed back by the alpha of the pack. Her father. Bobby turned from where he stood deep in the cave, noticing his dirty and exhausted daughter standing in the middle of the cave. She transformed as did Bobby.
“You’re a Super,” Rowena whispered.
“We stick to the plan,” Dean stated.
Dean smiled softly at that perking up. Castiel closed the door as Dean looked around. Dean stared at a picture frame with Castiel and two others in it. Dean picked up the picture frame studying the two people on it. Castiel, a blonde woman, and another young adult.
“Alright.” John tossed him the keys as Dean gave him a soft smile. “Remember. Six o'clock is when the ceremony starts. You better be there.”
“I don’t believe in that.” Gabriel shied to the word.
Gordon took a couple more photos till the couple reached over and turned off their bedroom lights to go back to sleep. Gordon thanked God for this wonderful information as he put his camera. This was going to be such an amazing stack of bills. Gordon climbed down not noticing someone had opened the back door to the house, leading from the house to the backyard. Gordon hopped down from the tree just so high on life, he was going to be so fucking-
“Yes, but it’s a bit more complicated for us than just sex...for angels to produce life...we need to be in love,” Castiel spoke as Dean eyed him. Castiel stood in front of Dean trying to make out his thoughts, any sort of sign about how he feels about this knowledge. Though Castiel wasn’t going to come out and just tell him about how
“Like always.” Castiel breathed. “Is Dean and your parents here?”
“...In the captain’s quarters, Of course. Up on deck. Can’t miss it.” Alastair spoke as Castiel stood but paused at the next words. “...Asmodeus. Follow them and lock the door once the bodyguard is out.”
Dean’s eyes glowed as Dean teleported them to the bed, Castiel blinked surprised as Dean straddled him. His eyes were glowing.
“But Dean and Castiel are mated,” Sam commented not understanding. “Why can’t we be mated too. I want to be mated to you.” Gabriel shook his head knowing he wasn’t going to win this fight. Gabriel cupped his face giving him a soft kiss before nuzzling him.
“...Feel what?” Dean whispered but he knew. They both knew.
“Why don’t we go home and rest? I’m exhausted and hungry.” Castiel stated as Dean stood up straight.
“You’re a witch?” Dean eyed her, she was surprised he knew what they were but nodded. “What exactly
The second was the bone of a black cat, ethically sourced from a cat that had died from being hit by a car. It laid there, lifeless, slowly rotting when he came across it driving for roadkill. He had done the right thing. Taking a bone before he buried it. The cat would have been in a better place and now could rest easier given a proper burial. Ashes to Ashes and all.
“Come on guys, bed.” The boys crawled into bed. Dean taking time to tuck them in.
Gabriel couldn’t believe he was being his intimate with anyone. There were so many rules sacreds were supposed to follow. Remain pure. Be unselfish. Mating only with your master’s permission and it was normally only to ensure ties within business arrangements. If...the sacreds were around, he would never had been able to have sex in the first place without Castiel’s say...but he never would have been able to meet Sam. Sacreds and wilds...never were allowed to even make contact with each other. In another life, if Gabriel and Sam met...they most likely would have fought for a wild even coming close to his Master.
“Because I was worried you would say no.” Dean choked. “You are just
“Oh shit.” Dean breathed sitting up weakly.
“John, what is so-” Sarah stopped when she noticed the beautiful wildflowers and the river that flowed through the flowers. “John, this is beautiful.”
“Rules? Says who?” Dean stated.
“Shrug Mankeys?” Jack repeated not used to the words being told to him as Castiel laughed.
The weather felt exceptionally better today than yesterday, Castiel didn’t have to wear his winter gloves, or his tracksuit jacket zipped up. Castiel said his normal good mornings to his neighbors in the neighborhood. Most about to start their day, Castiel moved through to his door.
Gabriel entered the cave, listening to the sound of the rain booming in the cave, the blood was more noticeable now...the smell...it was Sam’s.
“Why are you trying to hide it?” Dean asked as Gabriel shrugged.
The bedroom door opened as Dean waved the mirror away blushing that he was examining his marks. Castiel stood in the doorway holding a plate of food for him.
“Maybe I
“I just think it’s weird,” Dean commented as the baby was happily suckling himself to sleep, He glanced up looking for the bassinet when he noticed the bassinet wasn’t in there. “Where’s the baby crib?”
Gabriel swallowed looking down lost in thought as Dean took the baby from him to put him down, his cane taking the weight of them. Gabriel watched Dean walk into the other room, his mind swimming at the thoughts. Dean came out with the baby monitor.
“Alright. Let’s go see my father.” Castiel spoke as he walked past Sam, Sam waited however for Dean to follow after the prince before he started to walk with them. Making sure they were close to whisper his annoyance in soft voices.
“Oh shit.” Dean blinked.
“Is that all the gifts?” Mary asked looking around as she cleaned Christmas wrapping. Castiel glanced around getting up to help her clean up, turning his back to Dean.
“Well, I know I have imposed already but would it be too much to get your name?” The Fae asked as Dean paused in the doorway.
____________________________________________________________________
“...Well what if I told you, I know of someone who wants to help you,” Rowena asked as Castiel questioned that.
“John, I love this so much.” Sarah whimpered with love licking his fur, her tail wagging happily as John nuzzled against her. Sarah laughed with love as John playfully pinned her on the ground with love.
“So he didn’t shapeshift and he could only bark!” Sarah snapped. “But he had the ability to think! And even though he only barked he could speak with such heart-!” Bobby smacked her in the face as she held her cheek saying nothing.
“N-...Nice doggy.” Gordon put his hands out hesitantly but the dog growled harder. “Good puppy...I’ll just...go.”
“That...was so much fun,” Castiel admitted. “I never had that much fun before.”
“Stop, I am way too sore for that kind of talk.” Dean laughed lightly shoving him away with his foot. “Fuck off.” Castiel chuckled as Dean downed some of the potions before helping himself to food. Castiel eyed him before standing and kissing his forehead.
“Gabriel! Run!” Sam yelled as Gabriel took off past them towards the hut. A couple of wolves tried to follow but Sam quickly knocked them off their feet. Gabriel ran till he could no longer hear the sounds of Growls and whimpers. Running till the lodge doors were in front of him, Gabriel bolted inside instantly slamming hard into the broom Castiel was sweeping with. Gabriel hit it hard as the room went dark.
Dean kneeled holding out the lion to Adam who ran overtaking the lion into his arms. Dean ruffled his hair affectionately when the front door was kicked in with inhuman strength splintering the door into pieces. The three jumped as Dean forced Adam behind him in panic as a tall, muscular man walked through the opening door. His pointed ears gave him away instantly if it wasn’t apparent what he was. However, the beautifully detailed silver and gold armor he wore also spoke volumes to who he was and why he had come.
“No, actually, I haven’t talked to my dad in forever,” Dean admitted. “We stopped talking when I turned eighteen and moved out.”
“Do you trust me?” Dean leaned in breathing the words against his skin.
“Bobby!” Jody skidded to a stop as Bobby glanced up from his meeting.
“You need me too,” Dean spoke.
“It’s not all ducks, it’s one,” Ash stated seriously. “There is one who stalks me.”
“...So, will you be staying here…?” Gabriel asked as Castiel looked at him. “As Queen of the pirates?” Castiel was quiet as he rubbed his slight pouch of his baby, he...hadn’t thought past tomorrow and the fight. Saving Dean was his priority.
“Heading home so soon?” Dean called siding his hand into Castiel’s back pockets as Castiel looked at Benny.
“Yep.” Dean beamed. “It might have gotten past my husband but that hasn’t gotten past me.” Dean poked his own nose. “Omega’s know all.”
“I’ll get you food...your
“So…” Dean leaned back into the chair crossing his legs amused chomping a fry. “Which one of our rugrats told you?”
“It’s...hard to explain,” Castiel spoke as he kissed Dean’s shoulder. “You don’t need to worry about it. It never happens. Honestly, I think it’s like a story for your kids, you know?”
“No no. He has something he wants to do. He should be back any minute.” Mary breathed.
“Maybe my mom?” Dean stated. “It’s possible she’s seen him.”
“Sausage? I did ring! Now fuckhead.” Lucifer called to Mary as Mary shushed the dog with love taking their leashes and walking them back to sit where she was.
“I am getting closer,” Jess started taking the conversation from Charlie. “She is only human, I am the only one who can find him. I know him better than anyone and if we want to find him, us being here isn’t helping.”
“...How long have you been dead?” Castiel questioned surprise.
Dean walked passed Castiel eyeing his body with a smirk as Castiel blinked confused slowly moving to go back to his shower.
“Three.” Castiel breathed moving to sit down on the couch next to Dean. “Two.” Castiel cupped his face. “One.” Castiel leaned in kissing him as the ball dropped.
“Okay…” Dean breathed as Castiel took a second to just look at him before he spoke again.
“We can play for a moment, I’m done anyway.” Castiel stood. “Thank you for dinner, Mrs-... I mean, mom.” Mary beamed at the title. “Come on, Adam and Michael. Let’s go play.” The twins moved towards the connected living room. Castiel sat on the floor as the twins handed him some toys. Dean watched him with love as Castiel played with him.
“Mom, can we get a snack?” The twins said in unison and a very creep horror movie child way as Mary nodded.
“Are you okay?!” Castiel sniffed in tears.
“I should have been home! Healing our wounds together! As a family!” Dean snapped. “If mom was here-” Dean hit the ground hard as he was pistol-whipped. Dean’s lip busted open as blood oozed onto the floor.
“I’m Castiel. A pleasure to meet you.” Castiel held out a hand which she shook politely.
“Oh...you were trying to get past the ‘no love spells’ rule,” Dean spoke, using his hands to eat the rabbit meat which Castiel seemed taken back by his table edicate. “Those never work as you see, you got me.”
And Dean closed his eyes to the promise, never wanting him to let go.
“Wait,
Castiel kept refusing but one time Charlie took him to a party he was throwing. Castiel was surprised when Charlie told him to dress comfortably. This wasn’t going to be a big, celebrity get together? A chance to show off their wealth and privilege in a bullshit extravaganza with paparazzi...but it wasn’t.
“The whole trays?” Dean laughed. “
“Called us the little three pigs,” Dean recalled. “Remember what he would say when we asked what happened to the third?”
“I do.” Dean breathed as Castiel smiled at him.
“I don’t.” The demon stated when the smoke alarm stopped. Castiel took a second to register what he was told. Castiel turned to him, Castiel eyed him pausing at that.
“A tomb?” Castiel asked confused as Dean glanced at him.
“As you know, we have pirates who destroy, hurt, and kill all they touch.” The king spoke. Castiel knew of the pirates. They have been working their way up and down the coast doing unspeakable things and leaving a trail of dead. Never staying in one place enough for the kingdom to fight them head-on, they ruled the seas, and they always win sea battles. There were too many ships, too many men, they controlled the seas. The twelve kingdoms were...losing against them and people suffered.
He couldn’t! He had to tend for his brothers! He couldn’t leave them! No! Panic swelled in his chest. NO! NO! NO!
“I know, but it makes me feel better,” Dean mumbled, still unsure about this place.
Dean eyed his face, moving to apologize but...lips silenced him.
“I’m saying I want you to come home with me, as my equal. My queen. Where you’ll never have to run again.” Castiel confessed in tears as well. “What do you say, my little witch?”
“Good.” Castiel laughed at that. “Do you listen to my music?” Gabriel blushed looking away as Sam mouthed he was a big fan.
“Did it work?” Dean asked.
“-You asked me to do this and I’m doing it. Fuck off.” Stevie hung up as she returned inside smiling softly at Charlie. Stevie came holding Charlie close as they waited for the groom and his groomsmen to be ready for their first photo shoot.
___________________________________________________________________________
Castiel searched his eyes, Dean knew what he was going to do. To spare him from punishment. Dean’s mouth moved again.
“If we steal a car someone will report it,” Castiel spoke before he moved to the back of the van. He pulled out a screwdriver. “Just stay there and rest, leave it to me.”
“I’ll get some food for you.” Sam pushed off the wall as Gabriel watched him go eyeing his body as Dean eyed him.
Sam walked up the stairs sadly as John continued to cry on the ground. Mary attempted to care for his nose but John just kept sobbing like a mess.
“It’s okay, I deserved it,” Castiel commented as Dean leaned in, he softly kissing Castiel’s bruised nose. Castiel smiled softly before he kissed him again with meaning. “...I want to explain myself. The reason...The reason I brought you back here is I want you to meet your brother.”
“Castiel-!” Crowley choked trying to get up despite the pain when soft bare feet walked down the stairs next to him. Crowley turned in surprise when the feet stopped on the stairs.
“You don’t know how to quickie,” Dean stated about to move off the desk but Castiel stopped him..
“I’m up.” John breathed rubbing his face.
He moved to the back of the van that seemed pretty messed up from the accident water spilling from the back, Sam moved to the doors pulling them open with his strength. The back looked pretty messed up, the toilet near the front of the van was pouring water and really damaged.
Sam slowly turned to see the tear-filled green eyes looking back at him. Sam cupped his face looking at the freckles he wanted to kiss in happiness.
“You being back, opening old wounds. You should have never come back.” John snapped, Dean turned angry.
“I’m alive, thanks to you.” Gabriel insisted with soft caring words.
“Crowley said she fell outside then brought her and her sister in,” The Queen spoke. Eve eyed them...So this Crowley lied for them.
“Because.” Castiel playfully threatened.
“Yes-” The maintenance man snapped.
“I was
“Sleep?” Dean breathed in worry, something about it really set him off. Castiel saw the fear in Dean’s eyes. “N-No, I don’t want to!”
The weather felt exceptionally better today than yesterday, Castiel didn’t have to wear his winter gloves, or his tracksuit jacket zipped up. Castiel said his normal good mornings to his neighbors in the neighborhood. Most about to start their day, Castiel moved through to his door.
After what she did?
“I’m starving,” Dean admitted as Castiel stood grabbing his stuff.
“Come meet him!” Castiel laughed as he pulled him outside, Dean paused when they got outside. Looking for the horse...he didn’t see a horse.
“I would like Sam Winchester to be my new personal assistant,” Castiel spoke getting started on his work.
“His dad used to take him so he thought he needed to take me. My dad was an IT guy for a big shot company. He was
Closer to the front door were the oldest regular photos, one he recognized as Sam in his early preteens sitting with two others. Castiel took in the oldest man between them, must have been their father. Judging by the stubble jaw and his arms wrapped lazily around the two for the photo. The teen on the right of them also sporting a beer along with his father was sipping at a drink he was not anywhere near old enough to have. He may have been only three or so years older than Sam. He seemed shy on camera, giving an awkward grimace of a smile as he brought the beer to drink. Was that Dean?
“It’s time,” Rowena stated as Castiel got off his horse handing the reins to a servant before helping Dean off the horse.
“Dean,” Castiel whispered touching his lower back. Dean raised his eyes turning to look at him, the look gone, just looking up at him with his big doe eyes...what those did to Castiel... Fuck. “Come with me.”
“This is Horse. He’s really sweet. His owner said he was the best Horse.” Castiel spoke in pride about him. Castiel was just so excited, Dean didn’t know if he should laugh or just explain the truth that Castiel got swindled by most likely a con man trying to make a buck. But...Castiel was just so happy. “Don’t you just love him?”
“I-I think so.” Charlie breathed she had some ash on her face and dirt on her dress. She held her head running her fingers through her hair in shock pacing back and forth. “What WAS that?!”
“What do you want to do? Keep riding?” Michael laughed like it was silly but Castiel nodded.
“No.” Benny’s voice spoke as he offered him some water. Crowley took some of the water sucking it down weakly. “How is your head?”
“Not well, I still don’t remember who I am,” Castiel confessed.
“SHOOT IT!” The first man yanked his hand up in reaction as the gun fired into the sky. Sarah pushed through the dug tight hole she made sliding out from the Den running as she took off. She ran and ran till the sound of a gun echoing made her choke out. Tears filled her eyes as she sobbed, laying down near the bushes waiting for John to come after her.
“We don’t care if they die, Either way, that baby is dead and so is the human. I doubt it would be kept alive along. It dying might save someone the trouble-” Crowley stated. The assistant eyed him before turning back to the road just in time to see Sam land in front of it.
“I’m Ben! I’m a fairy!” The boy beamed so happily, he seemed like a kid with a sugar rush. His hair in a bowl cut, big brown eyes that seemed to sparkle. He was four, and most likely the youngest. That’s why he couldn’t sit still.
“You’re just a person with a soul who deserves to be loved.” Charlie cupped her face with a soft touch. Jess seemed taken back eyeing Charlie’s dark blue and green dress that only made her hair pop more from the colors. “I will treat you the way you deserve to be treated.”
“A human?!” Eve choked hissing at him when Crowley put some water on his hand and splashed her with it. “Hey!”
.” Sam grumbled of his displeasures. “
“S-Sam, I need to heal you or you’ll die.” Gabriel breathed as he took off his sweater pressing it against the wounds causing Sam to whimper. “I-I’m sorry. I know. I just need to figure out how much you need.” Gabriel touched the wounds with his sweater, cleaning them the best he could...but there was so much blood. It didn’t help. “Okay.”
“Whatcha doing, Mama?” Gabriel asked. Gabriel had started slowly calling Dean mama, which Dean didn’t mind in the slightest. Dean started to notice how shyly Gabriel introduced it. First when he said goodnight to Dean.
“I thought humans smelled like bananas.” One of the humans spoke as Anna followed behind them. She paused for a moment before turning to Castiel and Dean.
“Man, you must be strong.” The man chuckled. “...You know, I was excited to be called to fix a window.” The man worked. “Honestly, I’ve had enough of my wife and was looking for a reason to leave the house.”
“Let’s get you back in the bath, your dripping everywhere,” Gabriel spoke as he walked into the bathroom with Gabriel closing the door behind him. Dean in nothing but his underwear snuck to grab his pants before returning to his room quietly closing the door behind him.
“Gabriel said they got you at the hospital, they don’t know who took you there.” Castiel kissed Atlas’ head. “We are safe. I promise you.” Dean relaxed slightly before he paused.
“...We didn’t plan this very well. Dean’s pregnant and almost out of his pain meds.” Castiel explained. “I need to think of something.”
“There’s nothing on his calendar. I have no idea why he isn’t home.” Dean stated.
“I’m sure,” Dean stated leaning against the wall next to her stealing her fries.
help.” She commented like she was disgusted. “Go play fetch with your owner.”
“You’re his brother?” Michael asked. “Gabriel Novak?” Gabriel nodded crossing his arms. “When did you last speak to him?”
“...Because he could be me. Right now. Trying to keep himself and his family safe.” The man stated before moving closer. “...His mate is pretty pregnant, we have doctors, we have people who can shelter him. We want to help them.” The man held out a card which Rowena took it.
“We normally talk every day,” Gabriel stated. “That’s why I reported him missing when he hadn’t gotten back to me and asked for a welfare check.”
“I don’t think Gabriel would be involved,” Michael stated. “He’s very helpful. He cares about his brother...and he’s not overly helpful.” Michael commented. “I’m not getting a helpful murderer vibe from him.”
“How much blood do you think he lost?” Michael asked.
“Shouldn’t have tried to eat my mate,” Castiel commented as Michael chuckled.
“A couple of days,” Castiel explained. “You needed it and don’t worry. He was well taken care of while you were sleeping.” Dean nodded softly knowing they would have loved to tend to him.
“I’ll be okay,” Dean reassured. “I took care of my mother and never got it.” Castiel nodded watching Dean open the door. Dean covered his nose at the smell of death, using his arm to recoil from the smell. “Stay out here, all of you. Sam, can you dig a grave for me? ” Sam nodded, moving to start digging a good distance away.
“What the fuck is WRONG with you?” John snapped. “My son is NOT A fag!”
Dean spoke surprised as Sam mumbled back.
“Dean won’t let you take him,” Benny stated.
“...Not about the kiss.” Castiel held him, Dean tensed as Castiel’s thumb softly caressed his arm. Dean turned his head to look at him in surprise. Castiel eyed him as Dean turned to him.
“You guys are like married at ten, what makes you think you have any right to comment.” Dean frowned as Castiel put his hands up showing he meant no harm on the touchy subject.
“We are twenty-four hours, so let us know if you need anything.” Jo beamed before moving to clean the bar. Castiel glanced around not sure why this place of all places would be twenty-four hours but left without another word, happy to get home and rest.
“It’s because I’m so sweet.” Castiel hummed before biting into his lollipop finishing it to focus on his drink.
“Come on, we are going home...and we are holding hands. I don’t trust you not to run off.” Castiel joked as Dean slowly raised his hand placing it into Castiel’s. Castiel helped him up before walking home together.
Dean touched Castiel’s lip slightly opening them with his thumb. Castiel looked up at him innocently as he opened his mouth for Dean. Dean shuddered as he moved forward a bit sliding his tip into Castiel’s mouth. Castiel made the most innocent noise as he got the hint moving his mouth over Dean’s cock.
“Go in. Rest.” Dean stated softly. “I will be in, in a moment.” Castiel nodded scooping up Gabriel as they entered the cabin, the air was thick of the stiffness of the locked-up house. The smell of death leaving with the bodies. Castiel's eyes moved over the crib touching it with care.
“I-I won’t let you fall! Please!” Sam begged as Gabriel looked at him up in fear. They were running out of options, his eyes moved to the rope.
“I’m debating if I want to throw up a meal or not,” Dean commented chewing on some pretzels.
“Shame,” Sam stated. “...It’s really good seeing you.” Castiel looked down saying nothing, conflicted.
“I need to divorce you,” Michael commented as he stole Lucifer’s coffee for a sip. “No one should know me that well.”
“I-I would look down at her lips.” Dean breathed as he stared at them for a good second. “Then look back at her eyes-”
“So you and your brother hunt things?” Castiel asked. “Sounds terrifying. I only know about witches and devils. How do you do it?”
“Yeah.” Sam shrugged. He wasn’t a dessert in the morning kind of guy but...Dean mostly wanted more. Dean tried to get up but Sam got up snagging the plate. “I’ll get you some more.”
Dean’s eyes fluttered open softly as he rubbed his face tiredly. He wondered how long he was asleep as he sat up. He groaned at his soreness seeing he was cleaned up and dressed in some pajamas. He blushed instantly realizing it was Castiel who tended to him. Dean moaned realizing he was for sure sore, he waved his hand as a mirror floated to be in front of him.
“Okay.” Castiel nodded once again, promising himself to keep an eye on Dean anyways.
“Hmm?” Castiel whispered.
“Every time.” Castiel breathed, The twins blinked at him.
“Anna, What do we have?” Michael asked as a woman taking photography glanced up.
“It’s not bad.” Sam agreed.
“...Are you just associating with me because I am the only one you can produce with?” Dean took a step forward to him, but Castiel stepped back refusing him the closed space. “As you said on the mountain, I’m the last chance to bring back angels...with
“Not even a small need to try to grope me?” Jess stated. “Or paddle me?”
“Your highness, we have a deadline.” Sam reminded him.
“What?” The man asked as Castiel looked at him.
“Of course, and I got some for you too, Meg.” Dean offered the older woman who happily took the warm meal.
“You took my virginity.” Castiel teased and kissed his chest.
Dean’s eyes moved to Castiel taking him in, Castiel wore a loose tank top that seemed to be stretched too much, most likely during sex. Castiel always seemed to have one of these on, he never seemed to wear it before they started being this intimate together. He remembers waking up and seeing shirtless Castiel on the makeshift bed in the living room. He wondered why the change in clothing.
“A good place to grab someone.” Lucifer’s voice as Michael hum in agreement. “Think this could just be an adult who wanted to leave town and start a new life?”
“What about me?” Dean questioned.
“Attention, Novak family, now that you’re all buckled up and ready. I have announced we will be taking off to our destination of....” The speakers called as Dean glanced up hoping they would reveal where. “...A surprise!” Castiel busted up laughing as Dean frowned.
The girls loved this book, the book Dean had since he was a child. Dean closed the book worn and torn through the years. Dean eyed the kid drawing on the cover by Sam when he was little. His mother read it to him as a child. Dean read it to Sam and all his children. Dean affectionately touched the book leaving it on the rocking chair as he walked out of the room. Dean walked down to the kitchen as the intercom went off, Dean turned seeing Lucifer.
“Oh,” Castiel spoke confused but supportive as John beamed happily.
____________________________________________________________________
“...What can I possibly do to help him?” Castiel asked.
“H-How did you know they are safe?” Castiel asked.
Every little cell in his body pulsed with his own.
“Damn, what hit me? A rock?” The dog spoke, she could tell by the way he barked he wasn’t a shapeshifter like her. The dog blinked up at her surprised at the beautiful white wolf above him. “A hot rock.”
“Sounds unfortunate,” Castiel said, eating with a knife and fork.
“Did you guys sneak a kiss?” Castiel teased as Gabriel blushed harder.
“He needs to try,” John stated. “You look gorgeous…” John kissed Mary’s forehead with love holding her close.
Dean walked down the street going to his favorite coffee shop. Dean pushed through the door as he received the warm welcome from the teen chewing gum as she worked.
Eve whimpered as she tried to sit up but flinched holding her head sitting up as Crowley touched her back giving her support.
Dean panted watching his cock twitching with little squirts of remaining cum in his shaft till his body stilled. Castiel smirked in victory as Dean pulled him into a loving kiss. Castiel laughed with love as he pulled himself off of Dean’s cock as Dean held him in his arms snuggling into each other's arms just holding each other.
“Cas?” Gabriel’s voice called to him, as Castiel watched them screaming and running. “Ca-”
” Castiel could only make out a bit of that. The first sentence and here.
“No, I was roman times, like 350 A.D.,” Sam stated, Dean didn’t understand. “You know the gladiator movie?”
After all, Money is money.
“What’s a Shrug Mankeys look like?” Jack asked so curiously. Castiel grabbed a chalkboard by the bed drawing the beast in more
Castiel just cried holding Dean to his body as Benny bloody and beaten to a pulp collapsed next to Castiel. Castiel glanced up in tears as Benny reached over taking Dean’s hand. Crowley watched as Benny put a finger to his lips. If Dean was Dead...this could kill him.
“Wasn’t informed.” Sam laughed.
“Y-Yes, sir.” Both women spoke as they disappeared.
“I just...know it’s important to you guys to go all this way…” Dean confessed softly closing his eyes again.
THE LEAD SINGER IN THE ANGELS?!
“MOM!” Castiel called as she looked up at him.
“Can you blame me?” Castiel smirked as Dean slowly lowered himself onto his cock. Dean moaned as Castiel watched Dean slowly completely sitting on him. Dean bit his lip closing his eyes as Castiel’s hands cupped Dean’s ass in his hands. “I see you wearing my sweater in nothing more than boxers and I knew I had to unwrap you.”
“Hungry or thirsty?” Castiel asked as Leo poked his chin.
“I eat meat,” Eve stated.
“What do you mean Dean’s not here?” Castiel panicked as the twins blinked. “...Is...Is he not here by choice?”
“What do you mean?” Castiel spoke pausing his hand.
“I-I’m sorry, I wasn’t thinking-” Crowley stated.
“Enjoy your room.” Benny moved to take his leave as Castiel looked to Dean, Dean got the hint and nodded.
___________________________________________________________________________
“Maybe find some kids in the neighborhood to come to the party?” Dean stated. He knew human kids were out of the question...but Demon kids. That wasn’t his expertise.
“Well, maybe I can because I’m a half breed,” Gabriel stated.
“Okay.” Dean nodded. “Leo’s on a break. The girls love your pilot. I love the billionaire.  Sounds like fun...but are you up to it?” Dean reached out touching his arm with love as Castiel nodded. Dean didn’t want him too stressed out or worried, which Castiel made sure to HIDE from Dean, he always was stressed out and worried.
“Oh, that was nothing.” Stevie blushed.
“Nice home,” Lucifer commented. “I like the crown molding.”
“Ten, Those kids are going to take forever making the toys!” Castiel stated as Dean made a face moving to get up. “Fine, but I need at least seven.” Dean paused at this before he nodded. Castiel cheered in victory moving to hold his mate as Dean turned away from him, Castiel cupped his chin from behind exposing his neck as Castiel’s other hand forced to open his pants, Dean moaning in pleasure.
Crowley watched on the live feed of Dean screaming in pain, he couldn’t hear through the soundproofing but this omega was giving birth and most likely would finish before the end of the trip.
Castiel thought that was so weird...it showed how weak humans were. Castiel tended to him each night. Making sure Dean’s wound was cleaned and made sure he woke Dean to feed him and give him drinks of water. Everyone was supportive of helping making Dean’s healing as easy as possible on all of them. Michael explained that he better get used to it because babies were just like Dean was right now but only louder.
Putting the dishwasher on, Dean tiredly looked down at his messy shirt, covered in different caking material. Dean started to clean his shirt with a napkin, trying to get it out before getting to bed. Dean didn’t want it to stain. He walked out of the kitchen before pausing noticing it was pretty lit up for the lights being off. Dean glanced up confused seeing Castiel standing next to a setup table with candles and plates. Dean looked at him confused as Dean slowly walked over to him eyeing everything.
“Good idea,” Castiel stated as Dean rubbed his belly with care. “Want me to drive?”
___________________________________________________________________________
Dean never thought he would be like this with anyone…
that one.” Anna mouthed off as Sam moved to help Gabriel up.
“Think you can sleep?” Castiel asked as Dean pulled the blanket he bought towards him snuggling into it.
Dean jolted up in bed panting from his nightmare, Dean held his stomach as Castiel moved to him. Startled out of sleep by Dean’s screams, Castiel held him tightly. Dean shook panting as he slowly relaxed into Castiel’s grip.
was there sun pouring in? “Jack said Joshua would be the light in the darkest of rooms, I thought it was a metaphor! No! He meant it LITERALLY! I should have known! He’s a fucking kid! He doesn’t know what a metaphor is!” Castiel backed away as the wall gave way. Inside the wall, Joshua slept in a ball of light, his body circled around the tablets in his hands protectively, his wings wrapped around him.
“If...you really want this one, I can give it to you.” Gabriel held out the black dog plush but Anna looked up at him with shame shaking her head no.
“We didn’t either,” Mary commented. “Where have you guys been and how did you get here?”
“Rain check?” Charlie beamed innocently as she left with a mention of Dean taking Castiel home. Neither admitted to Charlie the sex they ended up having that night, and how Castiel stayed there for a week straight of sex and cuddling. Neither would admit to Charlie she was right, especially now a couple of years into this thing neither expected to happen nor last.
Dean was shoved onto the bed, barely having time to sit up when he realized Castiel had forced him to his knees. Castiel’s long delicate fingers slid up his inner thigh as Dean panted. He barely realized how much he was shaking as Castiel leaned down biting into the flesh of his ass. Dean let out a squeak as the Fae smirked. Castiel’s fingers moved to his hole, eyeing Dean like his prize.
“I’m sorry to hear about that.” Dean chewed. Castiel slowly wrote down what he observed. This man was very open and honest with Dean. Starting to complain about all his problems, things he hated about his life. Private stuff. Stuff you wouldn’t normally tell strangers.
Spilling his cum out of him with his calloused hands rocking down his cock. It seemed like Dean knew when each orgasm would hit him and would spoil his cock with all the attention it deserved. His cock would soften with its last couple of pumps of cum, softened and used. Dean who hadn’t even cum once would continue to fuck him. Pounding him back into another orgasm.
“We will wagon him. The wolves will escort us out of the forest. It won’t be a big deal.” Michael reassured.
His parents were super-religious, they named him after an angel for christ's sake. If he came out to his parents, he knew he would lose his family forever. Tears filled his eyes as Castiel held himself looking away.
“Right,” Dean stated moving to clean up, Castiel moved towards the bedroom. Listening to Dean washing the dishes of food, as Castiel climbed into bed. Dean came in after a couple of minutes, climbing in behind him. “...Goodnight, Cas.”
“Yep,” Stevie commented kneeling to snap a good photo. “Dumbass thinks I would actually fuck them over for him. At least it kept him out of your hair. I would have hated if he ruined this.”
_________________________________________________________________________
He...almost despite logic expected Dean to kiss him. But he didn’t. His hand softly sliding away.
“Had,” Dean stated. “...He was my older brother. His name was Adam...He...one day didn’t make it home before curfew. We never saw him again after that.” Castiel looked sadly at that.
“Oh, he’s going to happen to it.” John kissed his wife’s head before he poked his front pocket. The pocket moved as though annoyed at being touched when a small hamster poked his head out of his pocket. “This is the star of the show, Azazel.” Castiel smiled confusedly as he moved to pet the hamster.
Cellphone, dirty with wet mud, broken glass and...What Castiel realized...wasn’t red paint.
“Are you
“...I’m in a dark room, but god, it feels like a small cell more than a room” Dean mumbled holding himself. “I’m giving birth and I’m alone but I don’t know. I just don’t feel alone.” Dean shrugged running his fingers through his hair. “You aren’t there. Just, I don’t know... You just aren’t there and I am so scared-”
“Your
“To the tallest building.” Dean beamed innocently.
“You would think.” Dean snorted as Castiel took a seat at the table. “I’m glad they are okay though.”
“Thanks.” Castiel waved off the praise as Dean smiled at him with love.
Dean sat down, sliding on his seat belt as Castiel watched the strap going over his large belly. Castiel helped the toddlers into their seats, the toddlers were used to planes so it wasn’t odd to be strapped in for one. The girls happily playing on the kids’ tablets where the girls were playing a variety of games, including but not limited to learning games, dress up games and a dinosaur matching game. Topaz happily watching Moana instead of playing.
“But you didn’t,” Benny spoke. “And you learned and grew from it.” He nuzzled him as Crowley felt tears filling his eyes. “...I am so honored to be your mate, I am honored for you to love me. I am honored...we now have a family now.” Crowley wiped his tears as Benny cupped his face kissing him once again. Crowley wrapped his arms around, Benny’s neck pulling him close roughly. Benny moaned at the touch as they fell back into the bed.
“You think?” Sam asked shyly as Gabriel lit up nodded.
“Where’s Dean?” Sam spoke upset as Castiel glanced up. Speaking in Talu, where they can discuss privately the best he could.
“Nice to meet you, Dean.” Castiel smiled moving to shake Dean’s outstretched hand.
“I enjoyed watching you splash around like the little mermaid.” Castiel pushed himself up laughing as Dean beamed. “Now, what was that big surprise you wanted to surprise me with?”
“Well, she married my uncle so…” Castiel stated as Dean made a disgusted face.
“My older brother,” Sam spoke. Castiel opened it, taking in the notes Sam had left inside. This Dean Winchester was a patient of his brother?
“Absolutely not, I just want to be home too,” Castiel admitted pulling away from Dean to take a seat on the desk and helping himself to the snacks.
“Cas?” Dean mumbled against his lips.
“Go away.” Dean waved them off, as Castiel threw Leo over his shoulder walking away with him. Leo snorting as he was carried away. Dean held the baby monitor to his chest as he followed after him, one hand on his belly as he followed after the happy two.
“How...How do you go about making a deal with him?” Castiel asked. “How did that even come up?”
“I agree. This is why I want you to be.” Sam explained. “Those notes are just observations I have noticed as of late, he’s not my patient but I just wrote down what you would need to know to help him.” Castiel gave him a suspicious look before he stopped closing the folder.
“He’s unloading the car,” Mary explained. “Since we will be house-sitting while you guys are on your honeymoon, he wanted to bring the whole house..”
“Dean, you’re...a good guy...you were with my mom when...she died.” Claire swallowed sadly. “I’m...glad she didn’t die alone. Others wouldn’t have held a bleeding prostitutes’ hand while she died. You are a saint...but Dean, you can’t keep coming back here, they’ll start thinking I’m a snitch.”
“I love you.” Charlie moved and kissed Stevie as Stevie kissed back in a quick peck.
Castiel slid his fingers over Dolphin’s skin as Dean and him floated in the dark deep sea, he never seen a dolphin in real life. Now he was there swimming without a care in the world. Dean touched his shoulder, making Castiel turned to see a large whale moving past them.
“You’ll think he cares?” Jody asked honestly.
Castiel smiled amused as Dean pulled him into a house party, the house was full of people. Smoking, drinking and hanging out. Castiel looked up at the rave lights and music. Dean grabbed two cups from the table as Castiel laughed.
“So, you and your brother close?” Michael asked.
“I would,” Castiel stated with a soft smile. “...That’s sweet of you to care about what I would like.”
“...Should we trust them?” Castiel asked concerned.

“Okay…” Dean moved to sit, freeing a hand from his cane and pick up one of the tests with his free hand reading the results before putting it down and picking up the other. Dean stared intensely at the tests as Gabriel stopped pacing.
Castiel blinked taken back standing to move to him as Dean cried. Castiel moved to hold him pulling him to his chest.
“Sam and I have switched over to nights to better serve Castiel-” Dean stated.
“Yeah, sadly, that’s...exactly how I fell in love with Castiel.” Dean sighed softly with a kind smile. “I remember the second I realized I did.”
“-And you never will!” John hissed. Gordon punched John sending him to the ground.
“Dean.” Castiel moved to him as Dean curled away, Castiel touched his arms with care moving to hug his mate holding him close. Dean cried into his chest. Castiel held him rocking him with care till Dean calmed enough to be sat down. Dean gave a small sniff as he pulled back noticing Castiel was handing him some chocolate. Which he took and started to eat. Castiel took his hand and tended to it, which Dean sniffed watching Castiel ice his hand.
“I love you,” Amber stated.
“What’s destined mating?” Dean asked.
“Why not. Dean and Castiel had sex. We saw it with our own eyes. Naked in bed together, the room smelling of sex. Our work is more than halfway done.” Sam reassured.
“Ah, straight people.” Charlie chuckled. “Us gays are immune to straight superstitions.” Sam snorted at that. “Whatcha say, baby gay? You didn’t know that?”
Castiel repeated Dean’s words in his language, speaking them like a spell. Speaking them as they held the weight of the world on his promise. “Just trust me.”
She eyed the card for LOKKIS, a famous restaurant she knew of a couple of towns over. To even eat there, you had to reserve a table for months in advance.
Castiel slid on a shirt as he walked to the door. Peering through the peephole, seeing a man floating slightly above the doormat. Taking in the white and silver suit. The man had longer brown shaggy hair, and even without floating, he was super tall. Castiel...recognized his man.
“So you know who shot you?” Castiel stated as Dean nodded.
“Yes?!” Dean lit up as Castiel nodded again. “Really, you’ll marry me?!”
“It might be nothing,” Sam shrugged. “...but you guys kinda smell off.. is it possible you guys can like share scents?”
“You made me miss my meal,” Sarah mumbled as the dog chuckled getting up.
“W...Was he wearing his armor?” Dean asked as Sam nodded.
“Then FIND them!” Crowley hissed as Sam nodded holding his neck trying to breathe.”Do not disappoint me.” Crowley moved towards his car as Sam slowly pulled himself off the floor, he held his metal collar. Closing his eyes as the pain subsided, his eyes glowed red before he shot up into the air, flying away.
“Sam did this. We had the video before the crash destroyed the camera.” Lucifer growled. “I want him found and I want him found now.” He moved into her face, causing her to take a step back. Her back lightly smacking into someone behind her. Charlie turned to look up seeing Jess standing strongly and intimidating behind her like a silent batman.
“...So he’s safe.” Dean breathed in relief taking a seat on the bed.
“Sarah.” She frowned at the nickname.
“Alright, you guys pick out which one you guys want,” Jo explained as they looked at all the options they had.
“This is really good.” Dean moaned as Castiel came in after putting the baby down holding one of the baby monitors placing it next to Dean. Castiel grabbed his medication and handed it to Dean to take which Dean popped into his mouth.
Dean turned to leave grabbing a couple of tools in the doorway as he walked towards the field. Castiel didn’t move till he heard the door close, Castiel’s heart pounding rapidly as he held his hand to his lips still feeling Dean’s lips on his own. He didn’t move for a long time before he decided the house needed to be cleaned of dust. Castiel breathed moving to grab a broom starting to sweep, his mind lost to the feeling of Dean’s lips.
“...I thought they were dreams. I somehow had finished all my chores for the month, somehow dreamed of losing my phone. Dreamed of finding it…” Castiel paused remembering.
“Wait!” Dean called before he bolted after him. Following the kid in turns after turns. “Wait, Kid!” Dean bolted around and around the maze. He didn’t know where he was coming from, where he was going. He was so lost and confused. It was so hot. Lost and turned around he called for the child again. Though what escaped his lips surprised even him. “SAM!” Dean felt a hand yank him back roughly.
“My sets are for him to destroy. I made Hamster monster shorts.” John explained. “Once I am done, Azazel goes to find the food pieces and eats them. He’s going to be King Kong this short. I even dressed a sunflower seed as Anna Darrow.” John held up the small seed with cheese whipped hair and a white chocolate hair.
Castiel put Sam down slapping his butt towards the food playfully. Sam laughed loudly as Castiel moved to hold Dean close before noticing a stuffed black dog on the counter picking it up. Castiel blinked at it confused but when he smelled his mate’s embarrassment he raised an eyebrow at him.
“Hm. Maybe.” Castiel commented waving the card around as he looked away at the room to see if there was something they were missing. Dean cleared his throat and started to cough. Weakly holding the couch, as Riot whined. “Maybe we can just pay my brother a visit to be sure.” Castiel turned seeing Dean collapsing onto his knees. “Dean?!”
“...I like when you call me your little omega.” Gabriel confessed shyly as Sam smiled.
isn’t my grandchild.” Bobby breathed laying on the large rock platform in the cave. “...I have no daughter.” Sarah wiped her tear.
_____________________________________________________________________
Castiel watched the video message Dean and the kids had sent him, Crowley listening to Dean and the kids but wasn’t watching when he listening to Dean and the kiss talking to Castiel. There was a lot of random conversations and laughter when Crowley reached over with his good hand ending the video.
“Is Castiel going to be home later tonight?” Gabriel asked as Dean nodded softly petting his hair.
“There’s something not right with you. Something not right with people like you. You are sick.” John stated. “There is no fixing people.”
“...This house is a sick house. People who...died from the same illness that killed my mom.” Dean swallowed. “...When people get sick from it...sometimes humans would nail it shut to prevent the sick ones from getting out and keep the healthy ones from getting in. This is where they died. Inside.”
“I-I should get back to the crops.” Dean slammed back into the barn shyly, Castiel winced at the harsh hit, Dean blushed red.
“Nose?” Booker asked as Gabriel sighed softly nuzzling the puppy half his height.
“I-I didn’t get that much done.” Dean blushed at Castiel’s smile.
“...Does he know?” Dean asked as Castiel shrugged.
“...Thanks for stopping when I asked.” Castiel gave him a soft smile before going back to his cooking. Dean eyed the back of his head softly continuing to eat.
“Sam! You didn’t!” Castiel gasped happily before Sam couldn’t speak, Castiel hugged him in a mess of tears.
“That’s good though, he will be a clean slate.” Dean comments. “You can teach him.” Ah, so Dean
“Yeah, guess you're right,” Dean commented back, eyeing him softly. Castiel shied from his glance. “How are you holding up?”
Dean said nothing as security walked beside them protectively keeping the reporters away as they led Dean and Castiel to a Towncar out front. Security opened the door for them which Dean allowed Castiel to slide in before himself. Security took the passenger seat before they drove away. Castiel pulled his hood back when they were driving moving to hold Dean as he snuggled close. It was funny how hard these paparazzi tried to get Castiel’s photo. They did get a good side profile of him a couple of times, but...no one ever realized Castiel was the singer. They thought he was just a nobody Dean was dating, even got his fake name Misha Collins published on a bunch of ‘who is dating who’ websites.
“I’ll have another five hundred put into your account,” Gabriel spoke as Castiel nodded. His brother took care of him, despite thinking he was crazy. Never once got fed up with him. Just helped him. Gabriel made good money and was able to support him. Castiel was grateful, it allowed him to focus on his work. “You were late today, did you oversleep?”
“Besides the fact they teach us to blend in, teach us of human life to better our deals and help us breed.” The demon spoke.
“You are just pregnant and upset.” Castiel nuzzled him holding him close. “I would have done the same thing if you brought up my Tom Selleck days.”
“...I know you risk a lot taking care of me,” Castiel stated. “I appreciate it. No telling what would have happened if you didn’t it. I don’t know how to thank you.”
“They believe with a royal heir, things will solidify their kingdom. And they aren’t wrong.” His father explained.
,” Castiel growled as he pulled his hips back, Dean almost whined missing the feeling of Castiel but Castiel slid it back in roughly. Dean gasped in pleasure as Castiel rocked his hips roughly. Sharp, deep thrusts Dean couldn’t help but whine in pleasure too, only able to hold on.
Blue eyes lazily stared at the fire in front of him, watching the flames swallowing the fire. He sat in his long chair swirling around the liquor in his glass cup. He watched the flames dance around the glass before a noise to his right made him turn. His maid stood looking at him.
“Don’t you FUCKING dare mention her.” John snapped. “She would have been DISGUSTED by you! You’re not our son. She hated perverts like you!” Dean spat blood onto the floor. John pointed the gun at Dean in anger
“B-Benny-” Crowley forced himself to stand to stop him but Benny pulled back his eyes glowing gold…
“Hi, baby!” Mary cooed as Dean moved to kiss her cheek. “How was school?”
“No! It’s just their control of you! You don’t have to do anything! I’m going to protect you!” Jess tried to scream and thrash but Sam cursed before punching his sister in the face. Her head bounced off the cement knocking her out.
“I think I’m madly, truly, and deeply in love with you, Novak.” Dean touched his bottom lip with love before he kissed him. Castiel lovingly kissed back just holding his lover as Gordon snapped photos galore.
“Okay,” Leo whispered before tiptoeing out of the room, before being scooped up with a squeal of giggles by his father. Castiel tickled him as Dean quickly came out of the door shushing them loudly which both winced.
Castiel moved to him as Dean coughed and turned red, blood spilling from his lips as he coughed, pouring into the floor. He collapsed onto the floor as Castiel moved to scoop him up into his lap in worry.
Dean pulled back looking down at the smaller man in his arms eyeing his face softly, Dean reached up caressing his cheek sliding his hand till he cupped Castiel’s face. Dean’s thumb touched near the skin of his bottom lip.
“I’m just going to make myself more bacon.” Dean tried to get up but couldn’t. Sam got up helping Dean get up, as Dean gratefully went to make more bacon.
“My lord, where are you going?” Sam called as Dean climbed off his horse.
“If...If we came with them to the present.” Castiel spoke. “H-Have we changed anything?”
“I smiled before,” Gabriel mumbled with a shrug.
“Who the FUCK do you think you are just barging in like you OWN the place!” Dean snapped. “This is OUR home, not yours!”
“...Bitch.” Dean chuckled realizing before sighed. “Cas, we need to save-”
“Come look at my newest creation.” John ushered as Castiel walked over to take a good look at the New york city made out of a mixture of food and plastic. It was beautifully done.
Dean looked down what seemed to be a hedge maze. Dean turned to look back from where he came from but he found nothing but more maze. Dean looked up seeing the piercing sun shining down on him.
“I need to stop. Castiel’s going to realize sooner or later he’s not miscounting the hides he skinning.” Gabriel sat up turning to look at him. “But...I don’t know...I just...can’t help but make it a little nice.” Gabriel breathed moving to lay against him rubbing circles on Sam’s chest as Sam relaxed down.
“Bed.” Dean snapped as the boys got off the chairs and moved towards their bedroom when Adam glanced out the front windows.
Castiel guessed they were about seventeen or eighteen. Castiel could guess right away that the tallest one was a family member. Simply because of the fact he looked so much like John. The other boy who was wearing a sweater way too big for him, which Castiel guessed was the taller one.
“Normally to get pregnant, you need to be mated right?” Sam asked as Gabriel hesitantly nodded.
“You can’t suck me off that good and not fuck the daylights out of me.” Castiel whimpered needing as Dean eyed his face with a chuckle before he moved to press into him.
Dean eyed the back seat to take in Castiel’s body covered in his love marks with a smirk before he noticed Sam had done the same with Gabriel. Sam and Dean exchanged a blushing nervous smile before they realized...they had a
“Castiel, I give you this ring as a symbol of my love with the pledge: to love you today, tomorrow, always, and forever.” Dean breathed as he slid on the ring.
“I’d like that.” Castiel smiled as Dean chewed, continuing to explain stuff. Castiel eyed him watching his mannerism with curiosity.
“Th...That’s a wonderful thing father.” Castiel spoke still not getting what this has to do with him.
“...I was thinking after this is all over...maybe you and I can settle here. Maybe, bring back the village. Start a colony here.” Dean spoke as Castiel eyed him with love. “Sam and I have always talked of coming back here and bringing it back to the way it once was.”
“T-That’s um.” Dean hesitated. He wanted to say good as in ‘I’m glad you aren’t feeling sick and like crap’ but not in good as in ‘No baby? Yay!’. Castiel smiled that Dean didn’t finish his sentence unable to find the right words. Their...growing love was so new. Even though Castiel felt so shy to it, to Dean’s affection, especially with Castiel’s hatred of humanity...he knew Dean broke down all his fears and hesitations with just a smile. “You’ll...tell me if that changes?”
