"Hm?"
"John ... are you sure? You don't have to..."
Sherlock stares at him, feeling rather like he got doused by an unexpected bucket full of warm water. He's left dripping wet and mildly confused as to why.
John sighed and drank his tea.
Just a couple more minutes, that was all he wanted.
"What do you think about that?" he finally asked. He wasn't stupid enough to ask how Sherlock
Weddings were not supposed to be silent. There was the organ, a priest droning on, bridesmaids whispering and giggling, people talking and laughing, a bride and groom exchanging their vows, applause and cheers.
Wordlessly, John caressed his arm before leaning forward and pressing another kiss to the corner of Sherlock's mouth. "I'm so sorry."
Sweat trickled down his back. Time for a shower, then.
And of course you couldn't be disappointed if you didn't expect anything in the first place.
Molly shook her head. "I will do it myself, thanks."
He was running away again, leaving John behind again, and feeling every fibre of his being cry out against it.
"Oh, for heaven's sake!" With a huff, Sherlock moved forward and grabbed a hold of John's head, making sure to keep his grip gentle. "Now be a good boy and don't move," he ordered.
She gestured to the door. "I know you two are shamming at being in a relationship but you're making a right meal out of it. I've never seen anyone as besotted as he is."
He didn't know how long he walked, aimless and thoughtless, through London's dark streets. John's flat was far out in the suburbs and Sherlock was reasonably certain he hadn't gotten into any vehicles but he somehow found himself back at Baker Street just as the sky turned pale blue and pink on the horizon. Sunrise. His feet hurt and he concluded he had walked the entire way back. He had no recollection of most of it, his transport moving on autopilot. He still had his keys, phone and wallet, so it seemed the walk had been uneventful.
"Don't mind them, John," Sherlock murmured. "We'll have a nice long talk with Mycroft and Major Barrymore and until then they can natter on as much as they like. As long as they manage to return you to your own body, all of this will be worth the trouble."
They both turned to glare at him but Sherlock let go, rose and stepped back. "Quite. See you in a bit, John. How about we get some dinner from Angelo's on our way back to celebrate?"
That gave Sherlock pause. "What?"
They try a couple of different positions but nothing works.
He picks up Rosie and carries her into the kitchen. "Come on, sweetheart. Let's let Sherlock sleep for a bit. You can play with him later."
"Of course not," John grumbled. "So what was the point of getting drunk in the first place? Experiment?"
Doubtfully, Sally stared down at the dog. He was looking at her again. "Johnny, heel."
Sherlock has shoved the kitchen table into the middle of the sitting room and even switched on the fairy lights Sally knows Mrs Hudson put up while he wasn't at home.
“I highly doubt you’re anywhere near a toilet, or able to walk towards it at present,” Mycroft said, unbearably smug. “I merely wished to inform you that the Yard seems to have finished their deep-dive into your and John’s financial situation. I’m sure you will be happy to hear that they haven’t found a single thing that would suggest you and John have paid anyone off in order to facilitate the death of his bride, though it was not for lack of searching. They even looked into the money left to you by grandmother Valerie.”
"Well, playing the violin in King's Cross was a hint," the soldier said, nodding at Sherlock's open violin case. "And you seem to have been at it for quite some time to get that much money - unless you were stripping at the same time."
Identity theft. Multiple counts of murder and murder for hire. Identity fraud. Money laundering. Illegal possession of firearms. Illegal possession of illegal firearms, where both the owning and the weapon itself are prohibited by law.
all the time, knowing I had fucked it all up."
Sherlock scowled at her and proceeded to flash one of Lestrade's pilfered police badges, just quickly enough for her to see the word 'Police' but not long enough to get a look at the name and face on the ID. "I am investigating the murder of Mr Forsythe and his son."
To have Mycroft Holmes point her to this specific case, there must be a connection there. If there isn't, he at least suspects there is and Sally doesn't need anyone to tell her that if Mycroft Holmes suspects something, it is likely to be true.
They played tug of war for a while, until her arms hurt and she felt she couldn't possibly hold the rope for another moment.
"Can we see the suspect now or are we going to spend some more time chatting about inanities?" Sherlock asked, acerbic as always when he was impatient.
Sherlock wrangled the key into the lock and stumbled up the stairs to the flat, using the kitchen entrance and barely managing to take off his coat and shoes before falling into bed.
He combined his words with another firm squeeze and a twist of his wrist that made John's hips jerk. Sherlock decided right then and there that he could spend a lifetime in bed with John, doing nothing but this, and never tire of it.
He left the bedroom and trotted into the kitchen to lap a bit of water from his bowl. It was getting stale; he would have to make Sherlock give him fresh water once he got up. God, he missed tea.
"Yes," Sherlock confirmed, feeling an entire mountain range lift from his chest. "You say you love me. All evidence seems to indicate this is the truth. Therefore, yes, I will come home."
Instead, he resolves to try harder not to do it again. It shouldn't be that difficult. He's gone for years and years without kissing Sherlock, after all.
Despite this, they do end up going to the event, of course. John spends half the evening fidgeting with his suit and tie. God, he hates these clothes. They make him think of his wedding. Next to him, Sherlock is in a tuxedo and looking like he was born into it.
The memory was slightly hazy but he remembered it clearly enough to know it hadn't been a dream. Drifting along on the fuzzy edge between sleep and consciousness, he had felt a warm body stretched out by his side, solid heat from his shoulder all the way down to his feet. He had felt Sherlock lean in, his face merely inches away from John's ear so he could whisper the words he had clearly been gearing up to say all week.
? What do you think they'll think of
Mycroft’s expression softened a little. “Oh, Sherlock. To put your mind at rest: No, I did not kill Mary Morstan.” He saw the look on Sherlock’s face and added: “Or ordered, asked, suggested to or even failed to stop someone else’s plan to kill her.”
John watched him go before returning his attention to Sherlock. "That was the politest exchange I've ever seen between the two of you."
That earned him a snort. "Ha. No, Mycroft would hate all the dirty work and the brute force. He uses those, too, don't get me wrong, but he prefers finding ways to elegantly and subtly make the law play into his hands rather than breaking it. It lacks elegance."
The papers were blank.
"When we visited the Yard after I was turned back. He got really hung up on that," John said, nodding at the picture. "Said I shouldn't lead you on." He grinned. "Looking at the picture now, I can see why he thought I might have been sending mixed signals."
And now there was John, telling him exactly what he wanted to hear.
He opened his mouth to say as much to John before remembering that John wasn't there to hear him. Well, hear him he probably did, but a reply would not be forthcoming.
*****
She lunged at him. Sherlock, faster than even John had seen him move, evaded her grip and caught her upper arms to prevent her from smashing face-first against the door.
Sherlock barked a rather wet laugh, lifting one hand to wipe at his eyes. It didn't help much.
John shook his head. No, surely Sherlock didn't ... it was
"You were all these things to me," John protested. If they were going to have it out, he wouldn't do it sitting down. "My best man. My best friend." He heard his voice break on that last word and hated himself for it.
She smiled bravely. "Well, we tend to run here on the regular, if you ever find yourself wishing for some company."
They did as they were told, the hierarchy of their little group established with no trouble.
He wondered if perhaps Mrs Hudson had taken one look at Sherlock and instantly decided that he was someone worth looking after - a sentiment that he certainly understood and related to, though for slightly different reasons.
"Are you waiting for Sherlock to give you your breakfast?" she asked as he followed her into the kitchen. "You must be so hungry, you're usually up earlier than this. This past week you were both already out and about by the time I got out of bed!"
"Does he look like a threat?" Sherlock asked in return.
John laughed. “God, me too! It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.”
But then John's tongue swipes against his lips and Sherlock opens his mouth with a moan, his whole body pressing closer, seeking more of this, more of John.
Sherlock closed his eyes, knowing that John could have every last minute he had to offer. It was a bit pathetic to admit, even to himself. Three years away, and he hadn't gotten anywhere at all.
"Dr Watson," he said, looking like he was about to rise before thinking better of it. "I ... I wasn't sure you would come."
Sherlock tilted his head at him. "Do you know, sometimes I think I don't give you enough credit, John."
Perhaps they could have their very own Christmas miracle tonight. After all, it had been years in the making.
Sherlock didn't bother to respond, merely said "Johnny, stay." and marched towards the body ahead of Lestrade, who had to hurry to keep up.
What would she do?
John nodded.
He sat and waited, painfully aware that Sherlock was standing on the other side, unable to interfere or even see what was happening.
s and whatever other pointless wisdom he might feel inclined to impart.
Bleary eyes zeroed in on his face once more and John nodded to himself. "Yep. Definitely getting you home now. Come on, up you get." He turned to the barkeeper. "How much does he owe you?"
He shook his head, forehead still pressed to Sherlock’s chest. “I don’t understand how I could ... it
"Like this?" John asked.
"Of course you are," John agreed, not wanting to get into an argument. And it was true - Sherlock was more than capable of noticing if one of the candles accidentally set the tree on fire. As long as he didn't get distracted by something else, that was.
This was a novelty in itself, as Sherlock usually went from being asleep to fully alert in a manner of seconds. Not today, apparently. He found himself drifting in a pleasantly warm haze between sleeping and waking, in that quiet warm corner of sleep where you are dreaming but aware of it. It was peaceful and quiet and he felt he could stay there forever.
“Perhaps we should go there sometime soon,” John suggested. “Next month or so. A little holiday would be nice.”
"Only if you take off your trousers," Sherlock said, voice muffled against the rough skin of the scar on John's shoulder.
The sound of a car door being opened made him raise his head and he spotted the black car parked next to the jeep they had arrived in.
"Don't be," John murmured. "It wasn't your fault. Not really. You did what you had to do and though it was a complete nightmare at the time, I think we are both better for it."
Sherlock made a choked noise. "John..."
"You should see yourself," Sherlock said, snickering. "You look like an exploded poodle."
John nodded. "So whoever is doing this couldn't ... he wouldn't be able to harm you?"
"I know you're a changeling loner, one of the Felidae, subfamily Pantherinea, genus Panthera, also known as the big cats, you've recently been invalided home from Afghanistan under traumatic circumstances and your therapist thinks your limp is psychosomatic. Quite correctly, I'm afraid."
Sherlock recognised John the moment he came into view.
John attempted to look as adorable and harmless as he could when Lyons glanced at him. "No, sir. But this is Baskerville. If I judged anything here by the way it looked, we would all be in a world of trouble."
"Something has come up."
She examined the dead body in front of her dispassionately, then reached for the scalpel and began on the Y-incision.
"Is he begging to be petted again?" Sherlock asked, sounding like the very image of a fond, exasperated dog owner. "Just give his ears a scratch. He doesn't bite."
Sherlock shook his head. "He never much minded that. No he ... he wants to marry someone else." He turned his head to the wall, blinking rapidly. Lestrade felt a sudden, intense need to find that husband of his and shake some sense into him.
John thinks Sherlock will never stop surprising him.
He didn't have a good excuse, he knew that, but he dared anyone to passionately kiss John Watson and then walk away unaffected. And to think he had believed himself capable of staying aloof, of keeping his wits about him. Laughable. He could count himself lucky he had managed to escape before John had noticed his deplorable state. He didn't even want to imagine how John would have reacted ...
John Watson, 11:52
"Oh, thank God," John muttered.
"Sherlock, that's enough. You need a tissue."
John knew he was an anomaly in that particular equation. Whereas Lestrade and the occasional other Yarder was reluctantly allowed in Sherlock's presence, it was a mere necessity for the sake of the Work. Access to the cases had to come first, of course.
"Only if you give me the keys so I can actually wait in the car. I'm not going to stand in the rain just so you can have a chat."
"Is this your way of reminding me that I am fully capable of experiencing sentiment?" Sherlock inquired. "That may be so, but few people are worth my doing so, don't you think?"
Sherlock blinked at him, surprised. "So you'd actually want to stay here the full week even if I solved the case tonight?"
"Does it catch mice, too?" Arthur quipped.
John breathed out. "Okay. Good."
"No," he said softly. "Just you."
Sherlock paced their sitting room like a caged animal, moving from the window past the sofa towards the door and back again, occasionally glaring at the wall or the people outside on the street before abruptly turning away and continuing his restless prowling.
John made a complicated sound.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. "I'm not an idiot, Lestrade. Can we go now?"
To make matters worse, Sherlock blinked rapidly and finally found his voice. "What is there to say? It doesn't matter. My feelings are not important and never have been. All I ever wanted was for you to be alive and happy."
His friend shrugged. "Lestrade labours under the belief that being able to express yourself through touch may help your mental stability and make you feel less stressed about your situation. Do you concur?"
He sighed again. "There has got to be something, something I'm missing. If they wanted to talk in private, they could have done so at home or in Bingfield Park which is located right next to their home. So what where they doing in Regent's Park?"
What John decided to say was: "Yeah, you're right, that might be a bit weird. Even by our standards."
Sherlock carefully stepped back and pulled the door closed without a sound.
They grinned at each other and Sherlock felt some of the tension ease off his spine. Perhaps it would all be fine, if only John would stop being so obtuse all the time. Surely no one could be
Next to him, John was silent and that was worst of all.
He closed his eyes, a sinking feeling in his chest. Of course something had to go wrong at the last moment. In all their preparations, it hadn't for a moment occured to him that Sherlock would not be with him every step of the way.
John blinked. “A what now?”
Sometimes, he thought, John was not only incredibly perceptive but also impressively solution-oriented.
Instead, he had woken to the knowledge that Mary was dead and John was heartbroken. It wasn’t a trade-off Sherlock would have chosen. In his mind, it was quite obvious that the only person who should suffer was him.
"Here, let me," Sherlock said and a gloved hand gently pushed John aside as Sherlock stuck his arm down the back of the sofa and started probing around for the thing he wanted.
"Did you?" he replies calmly. "I gave you one name. You've turned that one name into an entire list in just a couple of weeks."
All around the hotel, there was nothing but grassy hills, trees and, a couple of miles to the east, a small-ish loch.
Sherlock hums but doesn't say anything. It appears that even he can't escape the lure of Mrs Hudson's cooking.
But he had no drugs now and the sentiment was back. This time, he had no desire to push it back down. This time, he would hold on to it, and hang Mycroft and the Council if they didn't like it.
He didn’t dare go so far as to say ‘someone’, worried that it would either be too obvious or - worse - be misunderstood. For now, this was the best they were going to get. A calm, quiet time to relax and adjust to this new life of theirs, to draw a line underneath everything that had happened in the past and start anew.
John's face goes soft in unexpected ways, the laugh still hidden in the twinkle of his eyes, but there's something else there now, too, something Sherlock doesn't dare look at for too long or think about too hard.
"By allowing prolonged physical contact, I will be going directly against the Protocol and the measures meant to keep it in place. I may suffer a migraine or brain haemorrhage as a result," Sherlock said blithely.
This time it was the latter and John was more than happy to sit and listen und watch as Sherlock walzed around the room, his eyes closed as he played. He managed to avoid hitting any of the furniture or stacks of books as he did so and John soon relaxed his watchful guard a little. Of course Sherlock wouldn't smack into the desk or the tree by accident. He had the layout of the whole flat memorized after all.
“Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?”
John shrugs. "Just because. I'm ready now. Tell me."
Sherlock snorted. "John, you are part of a very small minority of people who would rather go off and chase a murderer than prepare for their wedding. I am not sure how that matches up with your aspiration of leading a completely and utterly average life in the suburbs."
"You can't, can you?" Sherlock said, then immediately contradicted himself. "No, that's not right. You can, but you won't. That's why you are so certain I will not get to see your other form. You refuse to shift. Why is that?"
It was a very disturbing thought, in its way, and Sherlock raised his head and glanced towards the edge of the crime scene where he had left John with Sergeant Donovan. The sight that greeted him made something in his stomach clench tight and he fought to keep his breathing pattern normal as he watched John all but leaning into Donovan's hand.
There were noises and a crack that sounded like breaking bone, the heavy clang of metal on the floor tiles and then someone started screaming.
Sherlock could see his hands shake out of the corner of his eye. When he spoke, his voice wavered.
"Oh, John!" Mrs Hudson exclaimed, visibly pulling herself together to override her natural flight response. "I'm so sorry for reacting like that, I really didn't expect ... but you finally shifted again! And look how gorgeous you are!"
“And I assume it’s not the British Museum either,” John murmured as they took their seats in a secluded corner. “Too many tourists.”
"This is getting annoying," he muttered into his pillow. "How come my transport keeps getting its wires crossed in this unacceptable manner?"
"Now," John says.
sorry I ever made you doubt that."
It was warm in there, too, and they gratefully shed their thick winter jackets and snow suits. John took a minute to spread out their snow-wet blankets in front of the (artificial, for reasons of health and safety) fireplace. It did its job of heating the room rather too well and Sherlock could see drops of sweat forming on John's forehead. He wanted to reach out and wipe them away. Perhaps sensing his gaze, John turned towards him, tilting his head in question.
He had just been contemplating the relative merits of staying in and watching telly all day over going out and doing something that wouldn't make his day off feel like a complete waste when Sherlock's text had come in and sent him racing across the city.
Sherlock rocked back on his heels with the air of someone who had just been asked for directions in a city he had spent his entire life in and who was currently trying to recall the name of the place. John could hear his steady heartbeat and even breathing and relaxed a little. Clearly Sherlock wasn't overly worried. Then again, they regularly dealt with murderers; a couple of wannabe robbers were hardly worth getting excited over.
"Now, John, may we approach this other guy you have dispatched? I'm assuming we're looking at the bastard responsible for all these murders?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Fine," comes the muffled reply and it takes him a moment or two to realize that both his question and Sherlock's reply could be interpreted in two rather distinct ways. Of course by then it's already too late to not think about it and if something doesn't happen really soon ...
"Thank you," Lestrade said gravely. "Your offer is appreciated."
“Tell me if something doesn’t feel good,” John instructed and finally put his slick hands on Sherlock’s bare back.
For now. If the dissonance continued at this rate, it would eventually cause permanent brain damage. He saw no reason to tell John that, however. He did not intend to let it get that far out of hand. There had to be other options available. He just needed to find them.
Nevertheless, that was exactly what happened and he suddenly found himself on his back on the floor, his wrists pinned on either side of his head and Sherlock's knees bracketing his hips.
It was too much. These words, everything he had ever wanted to hear, four years and a wedding too late. It couldn't be true, all evidence to the contrary aside.
Sally snorts a disbelieving laugh. "My what now?"
Emily eyed the Psy seated diagonally across from her with open curiosity. This was John's Psy, then. Sherlock Holmes. An unconventional name for an unconventional Psy.
As tradition would have it, Donovan's Wing was stationed at the Tower of London, where they had apartments in areas inaccessible to tourists and where they could come and go as they pleased, for no one would dare to try and clip their wings. And still there were always ravens at the Tower.
"I need to look impressive," Sherlock said. "And I mean ... what do the kids call it? Drop-dead gorgeous. Absolutely stunning, is what I'm getting at, John."
*****
I have some more Johnlock stories in the pipeline and am working on all of them for NaNoWriMo right now. You can expect a new long multi-chapter fic in the spring and until then there will be some one-shots or shorter multi-chapter works. Be on the look-out for a Dog Days Take-Out!
He closed his eyes, hoping he would fall asleep quickly, but of course now that there were no distractions in the form of Sherlock's movements, his brain started focusing on all the other sounds his ears could pick up.
"I never meant to. I'm sorry. I keep ruining everything. Just ... forget it."
*****
She thinks about how thin Holmes has gotten recently and merely nods. "Let's feed him up, then."
They left the flat and hailed a cab, making sure to sit as far apart from one another as the back seat of the cab would allow.
The world crashes down, the sun falls out of the sky, the universe explodes, Sherlock is-
happen unless he agrees to take the job. He insisted I make you aware of my intentions. I am sorry for the inconvenient timing but this really cannot be put off."
No, this had to be observed carefully. They both needed to be absolutely certain that this wasn’t some bizarre sort of rebound. They deserved better than that, both of them.
"He interrupted the proposal," Mrs Hudson reminds her.
John thought that to Sherlock, this was probably quite normal. After all, here was a man who shot the walls when he was bored, who had faked his own death and hunted killers for a living. Restarting his own heart probably didn't even rank high on the difficulty scale for him.
"I remember now," he said.
John turned his head to give him a look that clearly said
He got used to Sherlock's hand leaving his neck in favour of reaching for the popcorn and contended himself with a happy calculation of all the calories they had gotten the detective to consume that day. If this continued, they might eventually steer Sherlock towards something akin to normal eating habits.
Dressed in their lightest, most comfortable clothes, they sneaked out the back door, took the back alleys and hailed a cab on Marylebone.
Two minutes later, Sherlock's phone buzzed. He turned the screen around for John to see.
"To get it back," Sherlock corrected. "I think whoever stashed the money here - if it was money instead of something of similar worth - realised he had found it and killed him either for revenge or to get it back. Probably both, once they realised he had already spent most of it."
It took a minute or two for Mrs Forsythe to be able to hold back her tears, but after blowing her nose once more, she straightened her spine and faced the issue head on.
John, caught off-guard by the pain in his voice, had to take a moment to breathe. "I ... of course. You're mine. I'm yours. We've more than earned this, Sherlock. I don't care who knows. I
Give it a couple of days and I’ll accidentally do that without any grand speech.”
He didn't even bother with the shoe laces and simply pulled them tight and stuffed them into the shafts of his boots after pulling them on. It would do for the walk to the car.
“We can’t find out anything,” Lestrade said. “We’ve got records of employment going back around five years. Before that, nothing. No address, no occupation, we don’t even know if she was in the country or not. There are no records of a Mary Morstan ever having been in any orphanage in the United Kingdom. There are no records of Mary Morstan existing at all. The only one we found was a stillborn girl who died some five and a half years ago.”
John woke to the scent of fresh green tea and the quiet clink of porcelain on porcelain.
He couldn't hear anything specific above the usual noise of people in their vicinity yet.
Finally, John let go and stood upright, carefully stepping back from the bed. Sherlock's hands fell limply to the bed, as if all the energy had been sucked from them.
John rolled his eyes back to give him an incredulous look. Sherlock wondered if he was being fanciful if he interpreted it to mean '
*****
"So that was interesting," John commented mildly as they stepped back into the temporary sanctuary of their room.
"Ah, there you are," Lestrade greeted them, yawning into his coffee as they entered his office. "I was wondering when you'd come to haunt me. Hullo John."
"Yesss," Sherlock hissed, raising his head to glare at John. "You are."
He would have grinned if he had the ability to do so. Instead, he shuffled closer and carefully ate out of her hand.
******
"Fair enough. Do we have other footage from the rest of the station?" John asked. "Perhaps we get a glimpse of his face on the way to the exit."
"What?"
Sherlock woke to an empty room, his back aching from having been sprawled uncomfortably in his chair. He had managed to doze a bit. Something was going to break sooner rather than later and when it did, sleep deprivation wasn't going to help. He needed his wits about him, needed to be sharp and alert. It had been too long since he had last worked a proper case and he had fallen into the habit of a regular sleep schedule. It was coming back to bite him in the arse now if he let it.
John decided to back off. "All right. Fine. I'm not saying you have to. I'm just saying, if you wanted, you could."
Finally, Sherlock spoke again, his voice very quiet. "John ... is this real?"
"Good morning," she replied, smiling back. "You're up early."
He therefore refused to comment and simply nudged Sherlock's hand with his nose, offering him the tennis ball.
"How tragic. I'll be sure to pencil in some time to feel sorry for you all next Wednesday," he growls back at her.
An hour later they returned home, John panting and Sherlock wondering how far scientists had come in the development of robotic limbs. He thought he might like to invest in an arm to throw tennis balls.
John laughed and kissed him again. "Don't worry, love. She'll be just fine. She's got Mrs Hudson and Molly as female role models and, dare I say it, even Sally Donovan, on the rare occasions that we see her. And if that isn't enough, she's also got your parents, right? Your mum must be over the moon."
Instead of responding, Sherlock pulled him down into a rather sloppy kiss, wishing he could make it as fierce as the emotion running through him but lacking the energy just now. Luckily, John seemed to get the message anyway.
So simple, then. After all these years, all the pain and confusion and fear, it was so easy.
"Me looking at you like this?" Sherlock allowed some of it to show on his face, let it bleed into his gaze as he stared at John. It was quite difficult to overcome years of instinct telling him not to let John see.
Sherlock shrugged. "Sentiment. I shoved everything I felt for you against his shields until I managed to break through and overwhelm his mind. The dissonance bought enough time for me to catch my breath and patch up some holes in my shields where he almost got through. And I believe it gave you enough time to come find me. He was ... quite out of it for a long while. So I did it to him again but I didn't have enough power left to really use it to my advantage. By the time you arrived, I was too close to a flame-out to manage any sort of attack."
"Yes, yes, thank you, dear. You'll forgive me for missing my dog. I'd tell you to come visit but we've got workmen in the house all day and I know how busy you always are. But I expect you to come over once we're done renovating. And remember to bring your John along so-"
John blinked. "What are you doing?"
"I didn't even know you have a brother," Sally said.
Sherlock snorted. “Please, when have you ever been any of that? Forty-one isn’t old and you have never failed at anything you put your head to. You even turned
While he waited for his toast to be done and the kettle to boil, he turned to Sherlock. "Anything on today?"
"Believe me, I noticed," the other man said. "There's not too many people here so of course new guests get noticed immediately."
She got up to make a fresh cup of tea and Sherlock distinctly heard her mutter “Men!” under her breath. Judging by the rough way she handled the kettle, he had made her angry somehow.
A handful of quiet seconds later, yet another clap of thunder made him flinch.
"The sooner this day is over, the better," Sherlock muttered. "Even this type of rain can't make it through a day and a night and then continue on. It will have to ease up sooner rather than later."
"Yes," Sherlock gasped. "God, yes."
"There was no wedding," John repeated, sounding slightly out of breath.
But he did, he
But clearly John was not having any of it. Not today, for some reason. It didn't really matter what the reason was because today was not the day Sherlock had wanted to do this.
His first reaction was surprise - had he really slept through the night? It appeared so, and he was honestly amazed. That hadn't happened to him in ages.
Finally, they reached their destination and the doors opened, allowing them to enter the glaringly white laboratory.
Sherlock didn't turn to check but he heard John follow him.
The word echoed around in his head.
Sally opens her mouth to tell him that she has already been helping all day, thank you very much, but something about his expression makes the words die in her throat. Perhaps it's the obvious tenderness in his eyes when he looks at his landlady.
The entire world seemed to jerk to a sudden stop.
"Yes, but this is different, for heaven's sake. This is your own brain apparently spiked with death traps to stop you from feeling things! Good lord, I thought you were simply taught not to feel and that was that. But this is ... I don't know. Mind control. Your bloody Silence Protocol has enslaved an entire race to forcibly prevent them from experiencing emotion - how can you think any of that is normal?!"
He stood up straight, took off his coat and hung it on the hook on his door. Next was his jacket. He hadn't bothered changing his clothes once since he had left Baker Street five days ago. He would take them off, have a shower and a shave, scrub his wrist until every last trace of John's touch was well and truly gone, put on some new clothes and then ...
John wasn't interested and never had been, he had made that quite clear enough already. He may know for sure now that Sherlock was gay - he wouldn't go so far as to say 'liked men' since most of the time he didn't
"It came up in our recent conversations, yes," John said blithely, trying to keep a straight face. "It was quite a surprise to me, too."
Instead, John pulled him out of his chair, turned him around and hugged him tight, pressing them together from head to toe, his fingers on Sherlock's lower back and the back of his neck.
There was hurt there, a hurt John couldn't fully grasp. "I ... what?"
"Because I talked to them about you," Sherlock said. "They know. They smelled you on me. And I didn't know how else to get you help. So they're coming over tomorrow. And they might bring a gift basket or something equally ridiculous."
John tries to reason that she has antibodies now but Sherlock won't hear a word. "She and I might have caught different strains of the virus, John! I will not have her suffer so."
"Hm, fuck this goat in particular," Sherlock said.
“Blimey, Sherlock. Apologies, John. This never gets any easier.” The DI sighed. “I’m here for two reasons. First, we got the DNA results back.”
Sherlock promptly jumped up and helped her off the sofa and then even escorted her to the stairs.
"Mycroft doesn't want me to attend because it's for charity. If anything, that would be a reason for him to keep me away. The last time I went to one of these things, I exposed the entire thing as a money-laundering scheme of the Irish mafia."
“You didn’t go to the loo at any point?” the officer asked.
As it turned out, there was exactly one situation he had not been prepared for at all and that was to find Sherlock Holmes, brilliant consulting detective and massive pain in the ass, slouched on a stool at the bar, clutching an empty glass that might at some time have contained an alcoholic beverage for dear life, and being accosted by a woman who was of the monetary persuasion. As in: if you had enough money, she was prepared to do anything to ensure you had a good time.
"Not really. I just want to know why, really."
Vaguely, he was aware of another gasp somewhere behind him and a muttered apology before the trolley rattled on, much faster than before. Sherlock could only hope that Harold had gotten the message but the interruption was at least enough to make him remember where and with whom he was and why.
John hopped off the bed, headed into the sitting room and retrieved his lead. He pointedly dropped it on Sherlock's face.
"It was a secret mission, John. Telling you would have defeated the purpose of-"
John kept his ears pricked, his tiger tense with anticipation as he looked around the lawn.
He wagged his tail and gave an enthusiastic bark.
"Everything," Moriarty said. "Everything about you. 9.9 on the gradient, brother of a Councillor, and yet here you are, working with the police, with changelings, to hunt killers. And you didn't stop there. You moved in with a changeling, let some ordinary beast share your presence, wasted your intellect on its amusement."
This time, he got a reaction.
"Oi, mate."
“Mrs Hudson.”
Sherlock hesitated. “I’m not sure we’re wearing the right shoes for any sort of hiking,” he said. “But we can definitely walk to the Crags.”
“Yes, why?”
"What on earth did I do to you last night?"
"They must have snuck up on it while we were ... distracted," Sherlock said. His breathing hadn't yet returned to normal and he had to clear his throat twice before speaking. John found this very gratifying.
"I could help you with that," Sherlock suggested rather breathlessly. "I wouldn't mind."
John groaned. It was not as reassuring as he had hoped it would be.
"Didn't know you were one of those men," Sherlock muttered.
"Mr Holmes, if I understand your earlier words correctly, you believe my husband was going to consult you on some matter?"
It took some effort but Sherlock managed a smile that didn't look like he had a tooth ache.
*****
He followed him there and was surprised to find Sherlock kneeling on the floor, holding a brush.
They looked at each other and John found himself wishing Sherlock would smile. Not the fake smile he sometimes put on in an attempt to make clients feel at ease - that one always looked a bit shark-like and didn't put anyone at ease unless they were lucky enough not to see it. He wanted to see a real smile. He thought he might have seen a glimpse of it once and it was stuck in his brain. The full-blown version might bring him to his knees, he thought.
"John? What is it? Did something happen? Are you hurt?" As he spoke, Sherlock sat up, eyes wide and alert already.
Sherlock tried again and John listened to his fingers brush along the fabric and scrabble in the narrow space. He noticed the precise moment Sherlock found what John had smelled because he froze the moment his fingers touched it.
He looked genuinely sorry about it, too, which was even more worrying. Sherlock rarely allowed anyone to glimpse his emotions at all and for him to act like this, something must be terribly amiss. John only wished he knew what it was.
I use "dog days ff" as a tag there.
Sherlock sat up straight and tried to pretend he wasn't worried. But then John barged into the room, a little out of breath and smiling and Sherlock relaxed.
John smiled at him. "Weren't you listening? I'm not leaving you. But you need sleep, love."
Actually, he hadn't, but obviously that was what he had meant by saying that it wouldn't happen again. John rolled his eyes at him and picked up the second bowl to give to him as well.
"It was while I was ... gone," Sherlock said carefully, clearly reluctant, pausing in front of the door. "I was pretending to be homeless at the time to gather information."
John frowned, never having heard that term in this context before. "And that means?"
John thought.
Sighing, he followed his friend's lead and allowed himself to be steered out of the sitting room, through the kitchen and towards his bedroom.
"And yet you bring the tea," he noted.
Thank you for clicking on this story, for reading it and for (hopefully) leaving kudos and/or (a) comment(s).
and he would not share him with anyone else.
"Vaguely," John said. "It was all a bit of a haze, to be honest."
But for now they had a potential killer to catch.
In the meantime, he would make himself a cup of tea and Sherlock a cup of hot water with a hint of flavour and wait until his Psy came around.
Accordingly, Sherlock was gloomily staring at the ceiling, clearly determined to demonstrate that he was not at all tired and found the very suggestion preposterous.
She shook her head sadly. “Oh John. All of this must have been such a shock.”
John's head whips around. "What?"
Sherlock grinned, deciding to go with the joke. "Yes, well, Christmas and Easter are the only times of the year where I do seem to gain weight."
Sherlock managed to look both pleased and embarrassed at the same time. John thought he looked adorable. "It was nothing," the detective muttered. "I went into the shop and asked for the most hideous jumper they had in your size. This was it. Knew you'd like it."
"Perhaps you need to have your nose examined," he said, crossing his arms and eyeing Tyson in mock challenge. "I happen to know someone who'd be only too happy to help you out."
It was a bit annoying to be so transparent, and he wondered if this was what people felt like all the time around him. Then again, it was also sometimes a bit overwhelming to know everything, whether he wanted to or not.
Donovan glared at him. "And do you think a crime scene is a good place to bring it?"
"Yes, John. We've been over this. No one can see, my shields are secure, I am used to you touching me by now. What do you want to wait for?"
Sherlock hung his head. "I'm afraid it's quite hopeless, Mrs H. He wants it so he can marry that ridiculous girlfriend of his." He sniffed. "He didn't even ... didn't even remember we were married at all."
Oh god, this was the worst thing that could have happened - well, apart from Sherlock pushing him away immediately and demanding he leave. But surely that was only a matter of time. Give it a few seconds for the full meaning of all this to sink in and Sherlock would surely kick him out, disgusted by the useless sentiment directed at him.
"Anyway," Sally continued, "I've never seen him so ... accommodating, I suppose. Do you know he kept lugging a bag around that was filled to the brim with dog treats and toys and whatnot? Not a single thing that belonged to Holmes for his own use."
John grinned and reached out to switch off the light. "If you say so. Now go to sleep, yeah? Good night, Sherlock."
Sherlock sneered at him. "If you actually made use of the eyes in your head, you would not only have noticed that dog far sooner but would also realise that it is very much a groomed, well-cared for, thoroughbred dog, Anderson. The specific breed in this case being a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever."
The desire to remain a person he himself could respect was currently being undermined by Sherlock Holmes taking off his trousers while lying half-naked on his bed.
"Okay, time to stand up so I can do your stomach and legs," he said, mostly to distract himself from his confusing thoughts.
"Anything."
"Thank you, Sally."
"So the tablecloths will be purple?"
"John ..."
"Don't worry," Sherlock said to him. "I also collected some fur samples."
John was a loner, which made him a bit less dependent on companionship, but even he could not go for months without touching another person, be they human or changeling - or Psy.
Mary and her lover almost fell out of the bed.
He turned and walked away, leaving John with no other option but to follow in his wake.
The men merely nodded and began unloading.
"There wasn't too much damage done," Lestrade assured John when he asked about the chaos his appearance had likely caused in the city. "Two people walked into lamp posts and a tourist twisted his ankle when he tried to run away before he realised you didn't give a shit about him. Some minor car accidents when people were too busy staring at you to notice the car in front of them had stopped but there were no injuries. None of it is your fault, John. This is a city full of changelings and there is no law preventing you from walking around in your animal form. It is not your fault it is such a rare one."
"No matter what?" Sherlock asked dubiously.
Well, that was an invitation if John had ever heard one, wasn't it?
London greeted them with the same blazing heat they had hoped to escape with their little trip. Thirty degrees for well over a week was not something British houses were built for with their lack of insulation or air conditioning. The city - and the people in it - was still sweltering.
"Bonjour. Comment puis-je vous aider?" = "Hello. How can I help you?"
... the same way. And that was all it took."
John lunged and hit her in the back, just enough to make her stumble and fall. He managed to avoid crashing into her and performed a 1-80 almost on the spot, giving her a dangerous growl that made her think twice about getting up from where she lay on the ground, panting.
He would spoil John this morning. He would let him sleep in and in the meantime Sherlock was going to organise food and surprise John with breakfast in bed. This, he knew, was another thing people did for those they cared about. Sooner or later, even John would no longer be able to remain oblivious in the face of all the evidence Sherlock was piling up in front of him without actually saying a word that might betray him. Until then, deniability was key.
Once inside her office, which appeared to be right next to the one Mr Forsythe had occupied, Mrs Munkeld offered Sherlock a seat and a cup of tea.
Finally, Mycroft nodded and both brothers relaxed a bit. "Very well."
John smirked. "You have a sister-in-law now. Harry's going to lose it when she hears that."
Holmes seems more relaxed after that, and a lot happier. Sally can only hope that John has confirmed his intention to stay indefinitely. She comes home from work one evening to find a van idling outside while a couple of very serious looking muscular men carry boxes into the flat. They are wearing wires that curl from behind their ears into their collars and Sally surmises that Mycroft Holmes must have decided to expedite John's move by having his own people bring the rest of John's stuff to 221b.
"Sorry," Sherlock muttered. "It's ... difficult to keep my TK in check when ..."
Sally sighs and sinks into a chair. "I reopened some cold cases because something-” (
In a seemingly unconscious move, Sherlock reached out and ruffled John's head. "Very well done, indeed. Good boy!"
LizandArt, 12:13
John sucked in a breath. "You never said."
When Sally is making dinner the next day after work, the door to her flat opens and in sweeps one consulting detective, sans coat this time.
"I woke them and sent them upstairs," Molly says. "Sherlock called me an angel."
"It won't," Sherlock told him confidently. "I'm not going to say anything and neither are you. What reason would we have? It was a means to an end which has hopefully been achieved. I really don't see why you should have anything to worry about."
*****
They were an elderly couple, clearly retired and rather well-off. No, they had been, he deduced, eyes flicking to the woman's jewelry. A bad investment, perhaps? They certainly had less money now than they used to but were still trying to give the impression of being far from broke. He judged them both to be in their mid-to-late sixties and of Eastern European origin, perhaps Poland or Bulgaria. They were also, he noted, very much in love.
She shook her head. "You need to understand that it was not simple and a lot of it was luck. What you also need to understand is that a changeling pack works a lot like its own PsyNet, except on an emotional level. All pack members are connected to their alpha and that bond is a strong link we can perceive on the mental plane. I was mated to Lucas, so I got pulled into his pack. As the alpha, he all but dragged me out of the PsyNet because his mind had a greater hold on mine than the PsyNet did. I just ... severed the link to the PsyNet and fell straight into the pack structure. They cannot use it consciously but it connects them all the same and it provided me with enough biofeedback to survive. Changelings are very emotional, which made the transition easier for me. As an E-Psy, this is where I belong."
“John.”
Happy with himself and the world in general, John entered the kitchen just in time to catch Sherlock with his hand in the cookie jar. Literally.
"I wasn't eating them," Sherlock immediately defended himself, which would have been more convincing if the cookies in his mouth hadn't made it sound like "I wafn' eat'n 'em".
"What a cute dog!"
"What?"
The very next day, Sally comes home just in time to see Sherlock and John getting into a cab with that particular look on their faces that screams 'case'. She smiles and walks right into 221a, lifting her phone to her ear as she does.
"What are you doing to me?" The words escaped him in barely a whisper, a question he had been stuck with for longer than he cared to admit finally breaking free.
"Is everything all right?"
She spends the entire day gathering and re-reading the files they have on the murder of Kathleen Jones - her first cold case.
Sherlock grinned and bent down to ruffle his head. "Just as I said."
Granted, he wouldn't claim to have all that much experience in that area and what he had dated from his university days and was therefore a little rusty. The cocaine and the cases had soon driven everything else from his mind and he had found that the effort required to 'get a leg over', as John had phrased it, was not worth the outcome of an hour or so of pleasure, never mind the resulting mess. He had considered that door in his mind palace firmly closed until John Watson had walked into his life and by now it seemed far too late to do anything about it. Best to let sleeping dogs lie.
Before he knew what he was doing, John had reached out and caught hold of Sherlock's elbow, pulling him back. Sherlock hit his head on the light bulb again, sending the circle of light spinning wildly.
He barely managed to lower his crazy Psy to the kitchen floor without him hitting his head on the edge of the kitchen table. A thin trickle of blood had already begun to flow from Sherlock's nose and his eyes had fluttered shut, head lolling.
Sherlock flinched and John grimaced. "I'm sorry. That's not what I meant. I meant ... I meant I wanted someone whom it was
John follows at a more sedate pace, not at all keen on catching up with him. He still has no idea what to say. Luckily, he doesn't have to, because Sherlock is already shut up in his bedroom, no doubt taking off that beautiful tuxedo.
Sherlock only realised he was weeping when Redbeard tried to lick the tears from his face and he pulled himself together, hugging the dog to his chest for a moment before releasing him to go play. Naturally, the dog didn't budge, sticking close to his side. It was reassuring - at least he hadn't lost one friend's loyalty yet.
Corporal Lyons, the same man who had met them on their last visit, was already waiting for them and John huffed a laugh at the way the young soldier eyed Sherlock like a child would a piece of candy. Sherlock, on the other hand, seemed to have remembered himself and John's senses and was noticeably reigning himself in as the Corporal saluted.
"Oh."
With his long legs and determined stride, Sherlock had already reached the top of the hill and was surveying the surrounding countryside when John came struggling up to the crest and moved to stand next to him. He didn't bother trying to hide that he had become a little winded - there was no point trying to hide anything when in the company of Sherlock Holmes.
John found he really didn't like public pools. Seeing as his recent experience with them was limited to being covered in Semtex, having snipers aiming at him and Sherlock, and fearing for both of their lives, he decided that no one could really blame him for being reluctant when it came to entering such buildings after hours.
him - not quite around him, for it was impossible to tell which one of them was doing the curling - and that was John's leg between his, clad in nothing but thin pyjama trousers and ...
*****
"What?"
It was John's turn to glare.
John nodded, put on a pair of disposable gloves, and went to work.
*****
There were some more photographs of the church door and the pews as the guests trickled in and then some more shots of the rented, decorated car Mary had arrived in, followed by some pictures of the Church's lovely gardens. It had been a beautiful day, John recalled. Sunshine and a slight breeze, just enough to keep people from overheating but not strong enough to mess with anyone's clothes or hair. He clicked forward and found himself back at the beginning.
"Well, he better hurry up before Holmes dies on him all over again," Sally says, sighing.
Before she reaches it, there's the sound of the front door opening and closing and steps going up the stairs.
"When?" John asked, throwing his head back and groaning loudly as Sherlock twisted his hand on the upwards stroke. "Tell me when."
"You said..." Sherlock swallowed. The memory of this hurt. "You said you wanted to be married to someone you loved."
They moved on to other topics then, with Arthur and Eliza talking about their first holiday as a couple.
John winced. He hadn't thought Sherlock would notice his changed behaviour. Stupid. Sherlock noticed everything. John had hoped he wouldn't understand what he was seeing, though. Clearly he was shit out of luck.
"I didn't mean it like that," he sighed. "You've seen yourself in a mirror, I'm sure you already know you could have your pick out of a crowd if you wanted."
Sherlock opened his eyes.
His conditioning had made alarm bells ring in his head at the initial contact but once he had pushed past that and accepted the touch for what it was (an experiment, not a threat), he had been temporarily overwhelmed by a frisson of warmth that seemed to originate from John's hand and had raced all the way up Sherlock's arm and down his spine. He had managed not to react to it then, but when John had swiped his thumb over Sherlock's skin, the resulting sensation had been much like an electrical shock, causing him to jerk back in surprise.
Well played, mate.
The cab ride only took half an hour and soon enough they reached their destination. Sherlock blinked back into awareness just as the cab rolled to a stop.
Sherlock flagged down a cab with his usual poise. John had never once seen an unoccupied cabbie ignore Sherlock when he held out his arm. In fact, he was reasonably sure that sometimes even drivers of occupied cabs had to forcibly stop themselves from pulling over.
John kept his expression calm and stony, trying not to show what he was feeling. He barely remembered the photographer, had been too wrapped up in the actual last-minute preparations to pay much attention to the man running around with a huge camera. He wasn't sure he had ever actually seen his face. If he had, he had forgotten it almost immediately.
Sherlock reached them half a minute later, the Yarders following at varying distances. It was Sally who arrived first, grinning at the sight of John and Sherlock standing over the heavily breathing suspect.
“Ungh,” Sherlock said, shifting his hips and arching against John, making him grunt.
John had spent the morning tidying the flat, for lack of anything else to do. The sheets needed a washing, so he had put on a machine of laundry and tried not to think too hard about how that had become necessary. He remade the bed, accidentally caught sight of the massage oil and had to sit down for a good ten minutes once he realised that he had dug his own grave with that one. They’d be doing this again tonight. And ... whatever else they might end up doing, too.
"Bye," she mumbled and John knew she was half asleep already.
"Now that that's done," Sherlock said, impatience clear in his voice, "would you care to tell me everything you've got about our double murder?"
But not tonight, he decided. They could have this dinner together and be just another couple, just two men out for dinner. Nothing more, nothing less.
And there it is, black on white.
John laughed. "Yeah, it is a bit, isn't it? But I'm quite happy with the fiancée I've got, thank you very much."
"Want a cup of tea, Sherlock?"
"I was looking for you," Sherlock said, averting his gaze. "I heard you well enough."
"Well said," Arthur complimented her, apparently ignorant to the fact that he was hardly the person to comment on other people's settling down. Sherlock had to bite his lip to refrain from pointing that out.
"Oh, stuff it, you git," John replied good-naturedly, clearly not at all put off. "Those are my lucky pants, if you must know."
Sherlock was reasonably sure of that, but found he didn't care in the slightest. So what if waking up from this dream, this halluciantion, was going to kill him? Perhaps he had lost his mind sometime around the time when John had gotten married, and all of this was a perfect fantasy world his mind had sought refuge in.
The entire night had been slightly surreal. It had all seemed very logical last night when he had decided to simply invite himself into Sherlock's bed and Sherlock had latched on to the idea as if it was perfectly normal. And then it had made complete sense to curl up together as if the bed wasn't large enough for two adults to lie in it with a respectable distance between them.
John seemed to take his silence for a request to continue. "In the end, I chickened out. I thought about what I had written and became afraid you would read it right there in front of me and I would have to watch your face while you read it, while you finally learnt ... and I couldn't stand it. It was too much, on that day of all days. So I asked Molly to give you the letter and she, of course, took the one that had your name on it, like any sane person would have done. She put each in an envelope and gave you that one." He nodded down at the letter on the counter. "This one ... well, it was in its envelope, so I never realised it wasn't the right one. I considered burning it or throwing it into Mary's grave after her, but I wanted to keep it nearby. Like keeping a tooth of the shark that tried to eat you, I guess. I put it in a folder full of paperwork and forgot all about it until two weeks ago, when I realised you had never gotten the right letter. So I found it for you."
Sherlock shrugged. "I'd like to get some more information about the other guests, see if there is something about them we don't know yet."
"Fine." There was only so much arguing over food that Sherlock could take. And so far it wasn't a very taxing case, so he wouldn't be drawing off indispensable energy used for brainwork.
had hit his head.
He buried his face in his hands. "You ... Sherlock, we've been over that, too. You can't just make your own drugs. Or take someone else's, for that matter! How often have we had this discussion?"
He leaned forward a little more and started nuzzling at John's neck, peppering tiny nips and bites along the soft skin under his jaw.
"Well, let's make the most of it and go join our fellow holidaymakers, then," John suggested. "We wouldn't want anyone to get suspicious and leave early."
"How long have you been wanting to do that?" he asked, smirking even as his tiger gloried in the feeling of being petted by his mate.
They left the Yard hours later. Darkness had already fallen and John saw Sherlock blink as they stepped outside, clearly surprised by the lateness.
Sherlock nodded. “Then I’m sure I won’t have to explain how it is possible for me to remember the precise time I spend anywhere. Just as I can tell that you’d really rather be with your heavily pregnant wife and are trying to quit smoking for the sake of your child - without much success.”
Sally forgets about her tea.
John raised his head at that, looked at Mrs Hudson, shook his head, and promptly returned to his previous position.
That got him a nod and a smile. “The hothouse, then.”
They entered St. Bart's hospital through the back door, the one closest to the morgue.
And Sherlock looked up at him with eyes that were too big for his face. He looked lost and painfully young with it. "The- the divorce papers. I signed the divorce papers."
"That speech would have sounded so much better if your teeth weren't threatening to fall out of your mouth," he told his flatmate, trying hard to hide his smile as he followed Sherlock out of the pool area and across the parking lot to Mycroft's car.
He had written his vows weeks ago. They had already been on his mind for years, all he had needed to do was put them to paper. They strongly resembled a Best Man speech he had once written and then burned before anyone but Lestrade had gotten to see it.
John grinned. "You'll survive. Look how you just charmed poor Mrs Hendriksen into telling you anything you wanted to know." He paused thoughtfully. "You know, she did remind me a bit of Mrs Hudson, character-wise. What is it with you and older women wanting to force-feed and mother you?"
Pain kept pulsing along the bond, however, the echo of a terrible stabbing sensation in his head that could only mean that Sherlock was fighting off a vicious attack on his own mind. John didn't need to guess who was responsible for that.
Lestrade sighed. "Could you two at least try to get along for once?"
He knew John would find him sooner or later - he always did. But for now, Sherlock wanted a bit of quiet, some time to really think about the case instead of John. If he hadn't been so incredibly distracted ever since their arrival here, he probably would have solved this murder days ago.
Sherlock hummed, staring dazedly upwards. Clouds of steam seemed to rise from the two of them.
"But then why-" he began and trailed off.
He pulled out his phone, held it up to John and snapped a picture, then turned the device around and showed it to him. "There, does that help?"
Well, not quite as thankless as usually, she thought, eyeing the dog beside Holmes. The freak hadn't bothered with a lead and Johnny didn't seem to require one, simply walking beside him as if it didn't occur to him to be anywhere else.
The mere idea of shifting here, in London, in the flat, made cold sweat break out across his body. He hadn't shifted in so long and he missed it with an intensity that ached but he just couldn't dare. Sherlock was in the flat and Mrs Hudson was just downstairs and there were so many people on the streets and he was lethal.
Five weeks have passed since John last kissed him. Clearly it won't happen again.
Since nothing about their lives or their relationship has ever been normal, they make it a habit.
He marched through the automatic doors, straight to the front desk, and snapped: "I need an immediate appointment. My dog has suffered an injury."
"Don't worry about that," Sherlock said, giving John a wink. "My landlady spoils him so much, I've been thinking about putting him on a diet."
own home.
John was amused to note that his friend had to clear his throat before the words would come out right.
"I'm glad you listened to him," John murmured, stroking Sherlock's curls. "We both needed that."
Knowing that Sherlock was only several feet away and being able to hear and smell him all the time soothed something inside of him and he did not dare to question it too deeply.
New flat, new wife, new life. There wouldn't be time for crime-solving in between marital bliss and all those stereotypically normal things people did when they settled down.
"Ah." Mycroft shifted in his chair. "I have to admit, I did not wish to have to break the news to you, John. I saw what my brother's death was doing to you. I did not wish to make it any worse."
"That's why I said it," John pointed out and stood to get his laptop. He plopped down on the sofa with it and powered it up. It took him a couple of moments to realise Sherlock hadn't followed him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sherlock?"
There was surprisingly little clutter in Sherlock's bedroom. Despite the way he frequently turned the sitting room and kitchen into hurricane disaster areas, he kept his own room rather neat. John found a stray sock half wedged under the dresser and a half-empty packet of tissues under a chair. There were no further cigarettes to be smelled anywhere, much to his relief. Perhaps he could find a way to open the night stand drawer and spirit them away without Sherlock noticing until it was too late.
*****
His voice broke on her name and he hated it.
Still, Sherlock missed him and found himself hating the extra time they would be separated. Logically, he knew it was necessary, but he couldn't help but chafe against it anyway.
Unable to talk as he was, John had no other option than to accept this and keep pace as Sherlock turned back the way they had come.
Well, that was enough then. Whatever point Lestrade was trying to make, he had had his chance.
Sherlock didn't know and he hated not knowing.
John's hands in his hair again. John's mouth on his throat. John's mouth on his mouth.
“What was your impression of her?”
"John, please, be serious. I need you to be serious. You told her you loved her only last night. If you are playing with me here, I won't ever forgive you."
Sherlock looked at him and John wondered if he could see it on his face.
Sherlock reached down and scratched his ear. "Sit."
you."
John gave a contented hum and relaxed.
"Fuck." John hauled himself out of bed and all but fled to the bathroom before he ended up derailing their plan of waiting at the last minute.
"You know," John wagged his eyebrows, "get a leg over, let off some steam ..."
Standing there, in the endless seconds of uncertainty, of not knowing, Sherlock allowed himself to admit the reason for his fear, the answer to the question of why even breathing without John there seemed preposterous, why he would rather have John the dog than no John at all. At least here, in the privacy of his mind, he was free to admit the truth.
But now he couldn’t. He couldn’t because his bride was dead and he didn’t know why.
But then John sank into him and the world swam back into focus and Sherlock cried out, again and again, all traces of composure lost to the roaring in his ears and the thrum of his heart and the sound of John's voice and the sensation of them being together at last.
"The wedding."
There was something ... something he needed to know. He looked around. It was just him and the officer. Someone was missing.
Perhaps he should have reached out, should have made an effort to contact Sherlock, to talk to him, see what he was doing,
John blinked. Did he? Well, not two hours ago he had been worried about the power imbalance of their relationship, and now here was Sherlock, telling him the exact same thing. And John absolutely agreed with him, so he nodded again and nudged Sherlock's hand with his nose.
Taken aback by the forcefulness of that final statement, John merely nodded. "All right. Fine."
John, of course, caught on immediately. “Right. How’s that?”
Mrs Hudson was right, at least in part. Things
John grinned at him. "So you can. But it's much more satisfying when you know I'm there of my own free will, isn't it?"
"She is texting me," Sherlock says. "Nothing much I can do to stop her except change my number and I've build up too many valuable contacts for that."
John raised his head and laughed. "Ha! You wish. But you're not getting out of this. I am going to do it right this time. But you're right." He nodded, waving a hand at the table. "Forget about the flowers and the tablecloths and the bloody napkins. There will be you and me and the people we care about and our vows."
It only takes Sherlock two minutes to join him at the table, by which time John has managed to talk himself into and out of a sudden onset of
John decided in that precise moment that if Sherlock did not have a pack that wanted him, then John would be all the pack he could possibly need.
"I want you to take the names and statements of the four Psy over there. Remember to thank them for their cooperation and so on and so forth. And try to keep the animosity to a minimum."
"The fire went out sometime in the night," Sherlock explained helpfully. He looked slightly flushed, which seemed unlikely since the only discernible reason for him to blush would be letting the fire go out and that was not something Sherlock Holmes would be embarrassed about. John ignored the phenomenon.
The day they chose to attempt a hug, John locked both doors to the flat and closed all the curtains to be absolutely certain that no one would be able to see them.
Then: "You're going to be abducted within the next two days. There's no need to panic."
"Which is why I have just activated my homeless network," Sherlock said calmly. "People on the street see and hear things even the Foxes never learn about, and they notice if some of their own go missing. Most of the time they just relocate, but it wouldn't be the first time a serial killer starts out by practising on those members of the population that won't be missed before moving on to victims with a higher profile. If that is the case, there will be other suspicious deaths out there."
His phone lights up and a breathy moan fills the room.
Startled, Sally whips her head back around and looks at him. "On whom?"
He had gotten to investigate eight crime scenes, made three people burst into tears and John had already stepped in twice to prevent anyone from punching Sherlock in the face. The case could hardly get any better.
"Yeah, I'm here. I've got you." His voice wavered and he didn't seem able to tear his eyes away from her.
"No?" John echoed. "What do you mean, no?"
"There is no fairytale where anyone is kissed to death," John said. "Do you mean Sleeping Beauty? She's kissed awake, not into a coma."
"Maybe there was a second attacker?"
"Sorry, left it in my coat," Mike said, patting his suit jacket with a grimace.
When he returned to the bedroom a couple of minutes later for a fresh pair of socks, Sherlock had rolled over and was sleeping with his face buried in John’s pillow. He tried not to read anything into that.
He dove back down, hands bracketing Sherlock’s hips now, guiding him until he was thrusting into John’s mouth. Sherlock moaned and gasped, trying to parse the sensation of a hot, wet mouth around his cock and John’s blue eyes staring up at him, dark with desire.
Instead, with a groan, he dived back in, breathing in deeply while he still could and taking in as much of John as possible before swallowing around him.
"Oh god, someone was murdered on the train?" John asked. "On the Piccadilly line?"
want and what you
Sherlock followed him, pausing momentarily beside Small before straightening his jacket and joining John and Lestrade in the hallway.
"I'm not going anywhere," John told him firmly. "I think there's something you need to tell me, something I need to hear, and I'm not going anywhere until you've said it."
Sally spends Christmas Eve with her family, exchanging gifts as an afterthought to a dinner that leaves her so stuffed she thinks she won't ever want to eat again, and a lot of shared laughter.
John sat up to make room for him and then waited expectantly in case Sherlock might be willing to share. After a couple of minutes, he gave up and flopped back down on the sofa. Clearly tonight was one of those rare times where Sherlock was actually hungry enough to finish his meal.

"Hey Johnny," she said when she noticed he had decided to join her. "Trying to get away from His Highness for a bit? Can't blame you."
John looked at him, really looked at him for the first time in far too long, wishing it wasn't quite so dark out here. He took in the dark circles under Sherlock's eyes, the carefully constructed neutral facade, the fact that Sherlock's hands were barely shaking at all and no one who wasn't looking for it would have noticed.
