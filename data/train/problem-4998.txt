After a moment more of undignified wheezing, Cas lifted his head.
He groaned into the back of Cas' neck.
Cas nodded. "I agree. And they were all brought back from The Empty. Some were made human when they wouldn't follow orders, but most are just up in Heaven twiddling their thumbs due to the 'no interfering' rule. They could be doing so much good."
Jack could do that. He didn’t have a vindictive bone in his body.”
be feeling this too. There was electricity crackling between them, and a feeling that was so very like falling even though Cas' feet were still on the ground. He had never felt more alive than he did in this moment.
"I know what he said! Look, where I come from, the upbringing I had-" Dean covered his face with his hands, dropping the phone to his pillow to take several deep, calming breaths. After a moment he picked the phone back up, and put it back to his ear to find Cas patiently waiting for him.
"Okay," Cas said, clearing his throat. "There have been a few times, but the time that Dean is referring to was when I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that it threw me out and sent me back to Earth."
the man he loved.
"Dean, it was fine. Good enough to make me let my guard down enough to end up tied to a chair and stabbed with my own Angel blade. I'm finding this an awkward topic of conversation."
"Do you really think you can? Go ahead. Try. Kill me," Chuck challenged, his choked gargle slightly spoiling the defiant tone.
"I was transporting them to safety."
"Why are you so obsessed with coupling us up?" Dean growled. If Sam hadn't made him this pretty delicious burger, Dean would have opened a can of whoopass by now.
The grass turned to stones, grinding with a satisfying crunching sound under the wheels of the car as Dean pulled up in the space next to the house. At the limit of how long he could spend in close proximity to Dean right now, Cas was reaching for the handle of the door before Dean had even switched the engine off.
Cas moved them so that Dean was facing him and he slid his arms around his neck and up into his hair. His fingers tightened, pulling Dean's head down to meet his mouth. The kiss was perfect and sweet, with the promise of something far more, but it was too short and Dean was left whimpering in disappointment when Cas stepped back.
Bess was picking toys off the floor near them and she shook her head at Dean, an amused smile on her face. "The best bit was that when they told him to giddy-up, he actually did."
The moment the door that led up the stairs to Cas' apartment closed, everything that Dean had been holding back burst to the surface and Dean broke down. His sobs were so big, so painful, so loud that part of him was worried that Cas would somehow hear through the car, through the walls of his apartment. If he heard him he would appear and comfort Dean, and Dean didn't deserve any of it.
Dean was watching him through narrowed eyes, the entirety of his beautiful face screwed up in absolute confusion.
and leave Cas fighting down a blush of embarrassment.
Silence stretched on and Cas leaned against the window with his eyes closed, pretending to sleep. He knew he was fooling no-one, but he'd had enough of talking. What did Doctor Graham know anyway? Cas would bet a considerable amount of money that
"What's so hilarious?"
Cas watched Dean as he slowly and deliberately raked his eyes down Cas' body. His eyes widened in question and Cas shook his head almost imperceptibly, unsure if he'd read Dean's question right. On the off chance he had, it really wasn’t the time to debate the drawbacks and merits of becoming sexually intimate.
"You're fucking not. Don't even try that with me, Cas. You're worth more than just your mojo. And yeah, there are reasons to give you up. So you can move on and have babies for one."
Chuck stepped closer to Cas, and Dean tensed, moving threateningly between them, protectiveness for the former Angel in his stance and in every tensed muscle.
"Go away. Just go away. I'm done with you."
"Dean."
Dean had vowed to himself that the moment his dad started on about Kate's child-bearing hips, he was out—permanently out—he was just gonna walk away, change his number and never see either of his parents again. There was only so much he could take from his dad without punching him in the face and whatever he'd said to Cas, he wasn't feeling particularly risk averse at the moment.
“This is fucking insane.”
“I think you were scared," Dean intoned softly.
Dean was on his feet almost instantly, reaching into his discarded pile of clothes for the ever present angel blade, caring far more about his defence than his nudity,
He threw Cas a helpless look.
"It's been a few years," Dean replied, glancing at Kate, before putting all of his attention back on Cas. Being the subject of all that attention, of that searching gaze that could always see far more than Cas wished it to, it made him flush, the apartment feeling suddenly far too warm.
Even Cas, who was often very reluctant to read into anything Dean did, was getting a pretty undeniable feeling that Dean wanted to kiss him, and he knew that if Dean actually did, he'd be lost. There was no way he would stop Dean now, not when he'd held him all night, not when he was standing in front of him and looking at him like he was temptation itself. Not when—Cas took a deep breath, savouring the mouth-watering smell—Dean had cooked him bacon. Sometimes Cas loved being human, and a
"There aren't elves in Heaven, Dean," came Cas' confused voice. "They aren’t the most accommodating of creatures - you’d certainly never find one who was willing to perform any sort of clerical work."
"As you wish."
Dean's jaw was set with a determined grimace. He was getting ready to end this, whatever that meant. Cas scanned the room for who was left, for who didn't need to be there to see this if it all went wrong.
Spitting out mouthfuls of the white snow that had fallen in on his face, he laughed. No amount of cold could bother him when Dean's body was pressing him into the ground like this.
“When I’m hunting or drinking, I’m not thinking. But the rest of the time, I just… I can’t stand it. I don’t want to be here anymore, Cas.”
Dean raised his eyebrows in the darkness of his bedroom.
change because my parents are back, but do you know what I got lost imagining when I was standing up there next to my brother today…?"
"I like being with you too," Dean said so softly that he half wondered if he'd even said it out loud.
be with me." Cas' words were unemotional, steady, his control instantly back in place. Dean couldn't read him now and for some reason it made his heart clench in his chest.
Cas glanced at Dean, but Dean was still steadfastly refusing to look at him.
There was a long silence where Cas just watched Dean staring at his own feet. He should go. He needed to go. What was he waiting for?
“Jack!” Sam exclaimed warmly, a massive, welcoming smile on his face. “I can’t believe it’s you!”
"I have absolutely no idea. But wouldn't you like to help me find out?"
"Seriously though, you know where I am,” James said, stepping up behind him.
"This is awkward, isn't it?" Cas asked with a sigh. "Do you think it's because it's so manufactured?"
"You don't have to hang up." His voice was calm, without a hint of hesitancy. As angry with himself as Dean was, he couldn't quite bring himself to hurt Cas by snapping at or hanging up on him just so he could escape his own embarrassment.
Pulling his cock from his jeans with one hand, and cupping Dean's jaw with his other, Cas slid himself over Dean's soft, perfect lips, leaving them shining with his precome, watching as Dean's tongue snaked out to taste him.
"I'm flattered James, but you'll have to make do with your right hand tonight."
“I think I’ll sit here,” a deep, familiar voice drawled.
Dean cleared his throat. “I mean, you did experience some of the best ones, but we probably shouldn’t go there after that Reaper kebabed you.”
you. Do you remember that? I was inside you and you were moaning my name like what we were doing mattered to you. Like it mattered that it was
Cas jumped as Dean's hand closed around his wrist, roughly turning it palm upwards and pulling it to him to copy the coordinates into his phone. His touch couldn't have been more indifferent or impersonal. Even before they'd kissed, Dean had touched him with care, almost reverence on occasion. This was deliberately brief, and Dean almost threw Cas' hand back into his lap.
"He went home when you went to bed," Sam said with a shrug. "He said to say goodnight."
Maybe they could just agree to put it all behind them, agree to meet up for a quick drink every second Wednesday and forget any of the rest of it ever happened? What uncomfortable confession of love? What leaving him for dead in an infinite mystical void?
"Of course dear. Kate and I have a
Their eyes met as Dean sat back down and turned his chair to face Cas, his knees brushing against the outside of his thigh.
“... Is that a request?”
"I'm going to see if I can gather together some friends - remind him he's got people who give a damn."
decided he was being stupid. Rubbing his eyes, he got up and went in search of a towel.
Cas felt like he couldn't breathe, holding his breath, waiting for Dean to say it. Because he hadn't known. Cas
“Yes! And you ignored every single one.”
I'm begging you here. I know you're better than this. I know you have a good heart. You're not like Chuck."
"Do we warn Sam and Eileen?" Cas asked.
okay?" Cas asked quietly, not daring to reach out to touch Dean, but suddenly desperately needing the reassurance.
It took them an extra fifteen minutes to wash the shower and themselves, then another ten minutes for them to get dressed. Cas, having no other clothes but the pyjamas he'd turned up in, had helped himself to a T-shirt, jeans and hoodie of Dean's. It was distractingly sexy to see Cas in his clothes, but Dean couldn't let himself
Not seeing Cas at least meant that at no point would he be able to give into temptation, throw himself at his feet and beg him for forgiveness, which Dean had to admit was a distinct possibility. The constant distraction was working, although Sam had put off moving out until after Christmas, claiming it was too stressful. Dean knew without Sam saying anything that it was entirely because he felt Dean might implode at any moment and he didn't trust him living alone at the Bunker. And living at the Bunker was what Dean would be doing for a long while yet, because even with all the work he was doing to make the lake house habitable, Dean was damned if he was going to share a home full time with Gabriel, Balthazar and various other Angels who flitted in and out as they were recruited. They would end up coming to blows. He and Amara agreed on one thing - Angels in general had been given too much power, and too little conscience. There were notable exceptions, but Dean was trying not to think about those in his attempt to stay sane.
what Cas was now picturing that same beautiful mouth doing.
"I love you too, Cas. So fucking much."
“Isn’t that a good thing?” Sam asked. “Once it’s gone, you’ll not be in limbo anymore. Right now you’re not quite one or the other; neither human nor Angel. It can’t be easy.”
Cas glared, turning his back to Dean, pretending not to hear as Dean chuckled.
Cas shot her a look. "Shouldn't you be molesting Sam's ass in the kitchen while he cooks, like usual?"
"Christ, Dean. Can you stop perving over the guy for five minutes? I thought you were finally getting some now? Or are you spending all your time at his apartment holding hands and showering each other with poetry instead?"
Dean had picked up Sam around twenty minutes earlier by his count, but he had worked out by now that time wasn't linear or consistent here. They could have been driving for twenty minutes or twenty years and they wouldn't know, and Dean wasn't sure he liked it. He'd tried to explain it to Sam, but Sam had been so excited to see him and tell him about his wife and kid that he had barely taken a breath since he'd sat down. Sam hadn't had verbal diarrhoea this bad since he was a little kid, and Dean was made up to hear him so happy.
Sam was such a good kid. Not that he was a kid anymore, but Dean sometimes struggled to let go of the image of that lanky, headstrong, desperate-to-please kid he'd dragged up in motel rooms. He was supportive and kind, and Dean was so fucking proud of the man he'd become.
Sam rolled his eyes at his brother's amusement and chose to ignore him to gaze wide eyed and worriedly at the world around them instead. The Impala was being pelted with rain so hard that he wondered briefly if it would dent the roof. He definitely didn’t want to try stepping out of the car right now - he’d either drown or have his scalp bruised by the massive raindrops that were landing more like hail on every surface around them. This certainly wasn’t the Heaven he had been expecting and dreaming about.
"Mmhmm," he made a noncommittal noise and Dean finally turned to look at him.
"Strong." Kiss. "Brave." Kiss. "Beautiful."
Cas couldn't quite quash the urge to roll his eyes.
“Cas had one single beer—one," he continued. "And he got that beer from
"I hope so. Neither of us have had the best examples to work with."
Dean flinched away, refusing to let Cas touch him at all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Kate smiled at him over her wine glass.
"But he absolutely has an advantage," Dean said, those eyebrows raised in what Cas could interpret as judgement. Dean's eyebrows were definitely judging him.
"You're not a very good judge of what you deserve," Cas informed him, trailing fingers down his arm absently.
Cas laughed and put his arm around Eileen, giving her shoulders a squeeze.
An hour later, his cock half hard in his hand, he felt like he'd scrolled through all the porn that the Internet held. Nothing had jumped out at him and piqued his interest, and he'd looked at some pretty kinky things. The level of taboo alone should have got him close but he was left decidedly disinterested. Maybe he'd finally done it? Maybe he'd finally finished all the porn? Was there some sort of award? A certificate maybe? A gold-plated tissue box?
Would it really be such an awful thing if they disappeared for ten minutes? Twenty at most? Would anyone even notice? Dean needed this, needed something to ground him, reassure him.
"That's debatable."
"I'm very glad you and Sam found each other," he told her, meaning it wholeheartedly. Epic revelations about his childhood notwithstanding, Sam had an innate inner peace about him since he and Eileen had fallen in love, and aside from how good she was for Sam, Cas found Eileen to be one of the very few people he actually enjoyed spending time with.
Sam looked like he was going to be sick, and Eileen, who usually never had a problem with facing any sort of danger head on, was practically cowering behind him. She shifted nervously as if ready to attack or run at any second. Cas could only spare a glance for her because right now Dean was his absolute priority, but he remembered how difficult it had been for her to deal with what Chuck had forced her to do to Sam that night. He wished he'd had the forethought to somehow warn her.
Dean was entirely sure he'd never been this hard before, never been this turned on. It was like every cell of his body thrummed with pleasure as Cas' beautiful, perfect hands explored the shifting muscles of Dean's back. They slid into his hair, nails scraping across his neck and scalp.
"She's protective," he observed when she'd left, looking at Cas, gauging his reaction.
"I can't guarantee I'll answer, but go ahead," Dean said, against his better judgment.
"Cas!"
His body was covering Cas', pinning him to the bed with his hips. Dean had replaced his hands with his mouth, exploring the shivering, shuddering body underneath him with his tongue instead. He was feverish with it, moving from neck to chest, to hip, leaving hot, wet trails of open mouthed kisses in his wake. Cas was moaning and writhing underneath him in an sinfully uninhibited way, not seeming to care who heard him, not holding a single thought for shyness or shame. Fuck, it was glorious.
he didn’t trust her—as he kept saying to Cas, something just wasn’t right. “You were with Cas the entire time you were at the club, right? You didn’t leave his side, until he turned into fucking Tigger and bounced off in a drug induced haze. So what the hell happened to him?"
It was what Dean needed and Cas knew that. He shouldn't be jealous—that was selfish of him and he desperately needed to stop. Just because they were talking and Dean was opening up, it didn’t mean anything. It didn’t mean that he and Kate were going to get together, however nice Kate was, however much Dean’s type she was, and she
"Just let me wipe away my tears of relief and joy first."
"We couldn't tell you, Sammy. We weren't sure, and we couldn't tip off Amara before we confirmed it. She's an all-seeing Goddess. We couldn't do anything she might see, and Cas really strongly suspected that she was closely watching me. We needed to push her into revealing herself."
"If you guys ever wanted to… you know, announce something similar… you do realise that you'd get the same reaction, right? Just a whole bunch of support and love?"
"Does that mean that as an Angel, you couldn't feel anything? Any sort of touch?"
"I know," Cas whispered back. "I feel safe when you hold me like this."
Cas felt a small rueful smile break the straight line of his mouth. "No, I suppose not."
"Thanks, man," Dean said when he finally looked up, ducking his head again shyly. Like Cas, Dean wasn’t used to receiving gifts, and ten days into what Cas was fairly sure was Dean’s first relationship in almost a decade, he was very much unused to gestures like this. Cas reached over and squeezed his knee reassuringly.
“I should flip the toast before it burns,” Dean told him, his perfect white teeth biting down on his bottom lip, not breaking the skin, but instead creating these little indents that Cas couldn't tear his eyes from. Dean still hadn't stepped away.
“I’ve missed you,” Cas whispered, as if saying it any louder would make it too real, too much like he was saying more.
Cas took a step forward. Reaching between them, he pulled at Dean's tightly folded arms. Dean hadn’t even been aware that he’d folded them defensively in front of himself, and he looked down in surprise as Cas pried them apart, before taking his numb, awkward hands in his.
"But today has alrrady been all about Eileen and I, and more than anything, I wanted to thank the person who raised me, the person who dragged me up and made me the sort of man who Eileen could fall in love with."
“That’s because Sam's a dick.”
Dean walked across the room to the drawer that he knew Cas kept an emergency stash of cash in. Pulling a few bills from the pile, he handed them to Kate.
His hands on Cas' face, partly so he wouldn't be tempted to put them anywhere else, he covered Cas' body with his, revelling in the way he squirmed and shuddered underneath him as Dean pressed him into his bed and kissed him fiercely. Cas hands clawed at Dean's sides, moaning into his mouth, and fuck, he was the sexiest thing Dean had ever seen. He'd never wanted anyone this much in his life.
“I’m getting you naked,” he informed Cas, tugging purposefully at his clothes. “Right now.”
"Oh, give me a break! You staked your claim on him the day you pieced him back together and left your mark on him. The way you look at him, you'd have
"No, but what's an evening without me being maimed?" Dean flicked Cas with water. "Let's go with sleep deprivation."
Cas hesitated and Dean sighed quietly.
"Flirting is it?" Kate looked straight into Rowena’s eyes in mock innocence. "I thought your pointed comments about my cleavage were entirely innocent. What was it you were saying, you could see yourself getting lost down there and not even caring how long it took to find your way back... out?’ She trailed off. Rowena was staring back into her eyes with a thoughtful frown.
Dean snorted. "What the fuck did you take, man?"
"I don't think that's a good-"
"They won't be at the wedding," Cas replied, taking another mouthful of his drink and feeling the warmth rising from his stomach to fill his whole body. "But a trip to the Lake House would be fun. We haven't been in weeks."
A second later two arms were wrapped around his neck, and the big lug that was his brother was clinging to him and sobbing into his shoulder like he was five years old again.
Cas let out a panicked puff of air. He pulled his hands from his pockets and placed them on Dean's shoulders instead. He had been so sure that he was going to try to push Dean away from him again. He was strong - not Angel strong now, but he could give Dean a run for his money if he tried. Instead, his treacherous, disobedient body just held tightly onto Dean instead, steadying himself, clinging to him.
"I don't want there to be any awkwardness between us," Cas finished lamely. "It's been a few months for you, but I've been away for much longer. It was all a long time ago."
"You're throwing all this at me like it's a weapon," Cas pointed out with infuriating calm. "Do you think I don't know you, Dean? Do you think anything you can say will change how I see you?"
"You've done this before though," Cas said, sitting to roll Dean's clean socks onto his feet.
“An accident?” Cas asked, finally glancing for a moment at Sam, disbelief and sarcasm dripping from his voice. “I watched you, Dean. Watched you for weeks hoping I was wrong -
Cas caught his hand, wanting to say something, but not daring now. Dean nodded in understanding.
he'd ever been in love with. He was standing almost close enough to touch.
"Shit, Cas."
Dean believed her. He knew he probably shouldn't, but he did.
of his legs," Cas fantasised out loud.
"I'm not gonna hurt you again," Dean whispered—vowed. "I swear to you. I'm not."
"Cas!"
“I was kidding,” Dean said, ignoring the twitch his cock had given just at the thought of Cas talking dirty to him in that already practically pornographic voice of his. “Mostly.”
"I'm sorry," Dean murmured against Cas' mouth.
“I’m sorry,” Dean apologised, speaking through his fingers, his voice muffled. “I’m so fucking sorry. For everything. For you having to sacrifice yourself again, for not being able to get you out, for not wanting to go on when you’d given your life so I could. I’m sorry, Cas. I’ll always be sorry."
I mean, what were you thinking? Oh, that's right, you weren't. Because you're
He swallowed, sucking every drop from him until Cas pulled back with a whimper, his grip loosening on Dean's shoulders. Dean wiped the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand, his eyes still on Cas, who was staring dazedly back at him.
Panic was overtaking him now, seeping through his body, the drumming in his ears deafening him to anything else, although he registered in the back of his mind that Dean was saying
"I despair of both of you!" Kate flounced out of the door, stopping to give Cas an exaggerated wink, before she danced back out to everyone else.
“Then talk,” Dean shrugged, gesturing to his lapful of Cas, who was already pretty close to being asleep. It wasn’t like he could wander out into the hallway to talk to her.
"What?" Dean blinked.
“I should let you sleep,” Cas said, softly. “I’m keeping you up and aren’t you going with Sam and Eileen to have another look at what's needed for the house?”
"Are you going to go after him?" Eileen asked, prompting Cas, who seemed to be hesitating. He felt both moved and stupid at the same time, and he had no idea what to do or say to make any of this better.
As she held it closer Dean shook his head, recoiling from the package as if it might contain something as horrifying as Cas' remains. He scrambled backwards, away from both Amara and the cloth wrapped bundle she held.
"Not unless he was dying," Dean answered dryly.
Then they were smiling at each other in a way that made Dean so very grateful that Sam wasn't in the room anymore, because there wasn't enough money in the world to bribe Sam to not make fun of the sappiness of that moment. Dean cleared his throat.
him."
"I need you. I need…" Cas was babbling, whimpering.
"And don't be sorry. The friend I lost? He came back to me, and that's all that matters."
"I suspected it when my wings were burned off," Cas replied, looking anywhere but at Dean. "Jack made a lot of mistakes, but he was never cruel. Never vindictive. Then when I realised how much I'd been pushed away from going to Dean, it made a lot of sense. I wasn't sure though, but some friends dropped in one night while I was here and they confirmed some theories - Dean only knew after that."
"That would be nice." Cas noticed how the coating on the wood of the railing was peeling. It needed sanding and treating, and Cas wished it was his home so he could do that, fix the place up.
Dean had underestimated Cas, but it didn't matter anymore. He needed him however he could get him.
"Since then I've laid in my bed night after night and I've tried everything—everything! Do you have any idea how it feels to know that the only thing that has ever made you feel truly cared for and safe was a lie you had to tell yourself?"
Dean nodded. “I’ll show you where I put all the alcohol. You’ll have to help me identify which bottle it is.”
"I'm tired."
"You're so fucking beautiful," Dean told him, every emotion he was feeling in his voice. He loved the sharp pull of Cas' fingers, tangled in his hair. Then finally, he slid his hands under Cas' ass, tipping his hips up towards him.
Bound together by ancient magic, their vows made, their matching smiles were beatific as Rowena prompted them to seal their bond with a kiss. The old barn echoed with the sound of heartfelt applause, which seemed to reverberate off the walls and high ceiling. Finally allowed to step down off of the wooden/stone platform, Dean immediately headed straight for Cas.
"Don't look at me,” Dean shrugged. “This is your show, buddy. I've done 'the talk' with plenty of people, but never someone who could potentially get me chucked in the loony bin—not to give you any ideas, Kate."
"The grip you’ve got on those sticks, I can see why she might be faking that headache.”
. Please will you just—"
"I brought bandages and this," he offered, holding the bottle of Tennessee Whiskey up for Dean to see.
"I don't want to leave you. I don't want to!" Dean tightened his hold on the tops of Cas' arms, holding him with a painfully tight grip. Cas stared back up at him, not jerking away, not wincing in pain or reacting at all, but gazing up at him with such understanding, such empathy that it made Dean's heart break all over again.
“Are you okay?” he mouthed at him when Kate turned her back to wash the sugar from her fingers.
Dean leaned in far too close for Cas to feel in any kind of control anymore.
Dean frowned. Cas was burrowing like some sort of needy kitten or maybe a demented ferret, trying to get into its burrow. He was wriggling and snuggling, digging his way under Dean's chin, into his arms, as close as he could possibly fit, arms wrapping around his body in a way that now made him think of an octopus, or a boa constrictor instead.
"Really?" Cas' eyes danced with amusement. "How fascinating."
Cas sighed into the speaker. “Are you sure there isn’t another cowboy film you’d like to watch instead?”
Dean blindly reached out for the bottle on his bedside and took a long drink, letting the burning liquid quell the urge to scream and scream and never stop.
“You thought you were expendable,” he finally continues, his voice still harsh but no longer the livid shout it was when he started. “You thought that the only thing you were good for was one last sacrifice. Which is such
Dean gets into the car, his plastic bag crinkling loudly in his hand. He rummages around for a second, then pulls out one of those god awful bears and twists around in his seat to hand it to Cas.
“Hell yeah he did,” Charlie says as she walks up, grinning. “You should see him on the way here. Getting to come drown you in slobber is the highlight of his week.”
Dean sucks in a shaky breath, loud in the silence of the night. Slowly, he starts to descend the steps, his movements reminding Sam of a sleepwalker’s: jerky and uncoordinated, his boots scuffing against the wood.
Then Dean blinks, and that guy disappears. It’s his Cas sitting here, and the world hasn’t gone to shit, and he’s not that Dean. He’s never gonna let himself be that Dean.
Sometimes he’s fine. Cas will stay the night, and Dean will wake in the morning to another body wrapped around his. And on good days, when casual intimacy isn’t a minefield he's stumbling blindly through, he’ll do nothing more than snuggle closer and brush his lips over the closest patch of skin.
He’s here.
Slowly, Dean walks closer. He seems almost— almost
Dean stands there, looking at Cas like there is nothing he would like more than to take him by both shoulders and
Cas runs a hand through his hair, trailing down to rub at the back of his neck. “It will take as long as it needs to. And I’ll be here the whole time, Dean. You aren’t doing this alone.”
It’s him. It’s
And he kisses Cas with all the wild, relieved, desperate love he has to give.
We’re
Dean breathes. His body is loose with relief; his unsaid words linger sourly in the back of his mouth. He’s happy, he’s so fucking happy he thinks he might just explode from it, and he wants to crawl into a hole and die because he’s such a yellow coward.
That it was
Dean has him wrapped up in his arms before either of them can say a goddamn word. Cas lets out a small, pained wheeze, but Dean can’t hold on less tightly. He can’t let go. He has to try three times before anything resembling a word passes his lips.
The smallest, bitterest smirk Sam’s ever seen pulls at Dean’s lips. “Look at you, figured it out all on your own. He made it almost all the way through his speech before I got it.”
Thankfully, Cas can be one hell of a distracting guy when he feels like it. And judging by the way he backs Dean against a bookshelf, dragging his teeth over Dean’s lower lip, he
And then he stalls. What… what the hell does he say? ‘I’m gonna take the drag, and then you just inhale it outta my mouth. No biggie.’ He can’t— fuck. He shakes his head. “Y’know what, just… when I tap your wrist, open your mouth and breathe in.
unless
“Dean—”
And now Dean gets to stare down at Cas’ lifeless body.
Camera.
Dean sits in a chair across from the rusalka— kinda losing his mind, kinda really goddamn frustrated, kinda wanting either a coffee mug or a weapon in his hand like an alcoholic wants a drink— and tries to listen to her rambling. He’s pretty sure she’s trying to apologize to him, but she’s so worked up that she keeps slipping into Russian or something, and he can’t understand most of the resulting distressed franken-language for the life of him.
Jack’s eyes are wide and bright, consumed by gold. There’s a wind starting to kick up out of nowhere, and Jack can’t seem to hear a thing they’re saying.
Dean gets a flat, sour glare directed his way for a response. “She wished strength and virility on us both for many years to come, that we might fulfill each other’s needs and have a happy marriage bed.”
Cas, holy
But Sam’s a bitch, edging dangerously close to ‘motherfucker’ territory at this point, and Dean just keeps gathering more and more evidence of that the longer this fucking staycation drags on. “Got any suggestions?” he asks neutrally. ”I mean, we could go back to that meadow. The one with the brook and the windmill?” He keeps talking like every word isn’t another twist of the knife. “It seemed like he liked that. It was a nice place.”
— and raises an eyebrow. “No, m’not. You made sure of that. Which, uh, thanks, I guess. Saved me again. But you heard the doc, I’ll be outta here in a week or so. And recovery’s gonna be a bitch an’ a half, but I can handle it.”
“It’s just Valentine’s Day stuff, Cas. Gift bears are pretty popular.”
(He does, uh. He does pray about other stuff, though. Sometimes.)
him, he
“Rusalki are fertility spirits,” Cas says as he walks out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around his waist. “These couples were all unable to have children, for various reasons. A confused rusalka might be attempting to fix the issues she perceived for them. Hello, Sam. How is your ankle?”
Those words sit heavy in the air between them, weighted down by fate. Dean shivers, the phantom-limb sensation of wings arching over his shoulders mingling with the memory of another Michael’s Grace scorching through him, turning him into a nuclear reactor. An atom bomb caught at the point of explosion.
going to let that happen again. Not now that they’ve won. They’ve fought too long and too hard, lost too much, not to get to live their lives. And if Sam leaves Dean to his own devices, sooner rather than later he won’t have a life to live. He isn’t sure what it’ll be next time: maybe a werewolf who got a lucky swipe, a djinn who managed to get the drop on him. Or, the way Dean’s been since he got out of the hospital, maybe just a bullet and a red splatter on some peeling motel wall.
Then he digs the joint and his lighter out of his pocket, and takes a breath.
He looks back, though.
He’s resourceful, though. And recently-impaled or not, he’s still a hot piece of ass. It only takes a little bit of eyelash batting to get his nurse to find him some sleeping meds, and from there on out it’s smooth sailing. In addition to being stupidly effective at knocking him the fuck out, the pills also have the added benefit of not leaving him hungover the next morning. He’ll have to find out what brand they are, stay on ‘em once he’s home again. Jack Daniels doesn’t really work that well beyond actually getting him to sleep.
Then Cas, without breaking the conversation, switches Dean’s empty dessert plate out for his own half-full one, and Dean almost spills the beans right then and there even if it is a weird custard thing.
way. There’s a difference, genius.” His eyes are wide, desperate and pleading. “Just— just
The rain has stopped. Morning sun spills through the kitchen window, lighting up the room. Lighting up Cas. And nature must be getting into irony, because in the warm glow he looks even more like an angel than he usually does.
Alone in his hospital bed, Dean runs a hand over his face.
This? This isn’t trying, Dean. This is that ‘fuck you’ you said you wanted to avoid.”
“So,” he starts. “Sam told you where I was?”
— - —
Dean lets out a harsh laugh and stands, turning to face Sam. “Well, that’s a one-eighty from earlier. Did your conscience finally kick in?”
The silver four door has long since disappeared down the lane towards the road, but Dean’s still just… standing here. There’s so
So. Maybe that’s enough.
Then someone slaps him.

One of them makes dinner. Dean tries to do it more often than not; it takes up a couple hours where all he has to think about are temperatures and ingredients and seasoning. Then there are the dishes to be washed, and maybe a movie if they didn’t watch one in the afternoon, and then they’re usually both in bed by ten.
Sam doesn’t look up, just goes noticeably still. There’s an awkward pause. Then he clears his throat. “Got your phone?”
“It’s not,” Cas says. It’s still more gentle than Dean deserves, for all it’s bluntness. And it also stings, a little, because Dean is fucked up like that. “I’ve been a paradox for far too long. I needed to make a choice, and I can’t go back to Heaven— that hasn’t been an option for years. Earth has been more welcoming, historically.”
Dean can’t
“Cas. You can let go of my hand, now.”
put that there.
there’s gonna be a next time. Don’t try to tell me there won’t be.”
“I’m,” Dean starts, shying away from the implications of that. He swallows and tries again. “You hungry?”
and yet more concerned!Sam.
“Already have,” Dean slurs with a faint, sad grin, ignoring the stricken look on Sam’s face. “This is it, man. Was… was gonna tell you how great you are. But you’re too busy talkin’ on the
The next couple days pass. They’re boring as hell.
After an agonizing stretch of silence, Cas turns back to the bag and puts the cord away. “Just as I thought,” he says, smug but kinda melancholy about it. “Who’s the avoider now?”
“You don’t
Dean’s already scrambling to his feet, his beer forgotten.
Dean starts walking. “Why would I need it?”
April 20th. But that shit’s funny, okay? Don’t judge.) He hasn’t smoked anything since… shit, the last time he can remember must’ve been… before the first apocalypse? Yeah, he thinks… yeah.
He doesn’t try.
Cas’ fingers find a hole in the hem of his shirt, plucking at the worn fabric. “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
“Right.”
He reaches out and takes it. Drinks.
Cas smiles, bleak, and stays where he is.
Dean’s mouth snaps shut.
“So he’s— he is in there.”
Dean’s feeling kinda floaty. Like his head is three sizes too big, attached to his body by a looooong string. That’s probably the shock. And the piece of rebar he’s got rearranging his insides? It doesn’t even
“Okay!” Dean shouts over a snarled curse from Sam. “Take a walk! Get some demon warding up outside, okay? It can’t hurt to be thorough.”
He turns around.
Well, there we go. Chapter one, done.
“Yes,” Cas replies, peering at the menu. “Like I said, the rusalka must be one of the hotel staff. Simply being seen interacting around the hotel in a way that suggests we are a couple should be enough to garner her sympathies.” Greasy Homophobe across the room is looking at them again. Dean glares at him harder and grips his steak knife in a decidedly threatening way.
Cas swallows audibly and shifts, his knee knocking into Dean’s under the blankets. “No,  I was… unprepared. I think— I think we should try again.”
Needless to say, adding mind-altering substances to that equation sounds like a shitty idea, and Dean’s not ready for that. So he’s gonna be smoking alone tonight.
act like you were a
But alas, nothing gold can stay.
that stuff, they—
“Oh.” Dean deflates a little and turns his head towards Cas in the dark. “Uh. Sorry.”
Dean swallows, his mouth going dry.
He doesn’t do that. “Then don’t,” he whispers instead. It still feels like a confession. Of what, Dean isn’t sure.
And yeah, he might be broken. But Cas knows that, and he…
Uncaring of what it’ll do to him if he’s wrong, Dean rips the door of Sam’s room open and stumbles inside, Cas’ name rising up in his throat.
And again… whoops. This took a month and a half, lol. I have no idea how long the next chapter will take, so. Pls hang in there, we might be getting somewhere interesting next chap 👀
“Don’t think I won’t hotwire my own goddamn car. I’m gonna be
Dean just lets out a small scoff and goes back to his sandwich.
He thinks it’d probably kill him to say all that, though.
Dean shakes his head, baffled. What a weirdo. He left his paper here, though, and Dean takes a sip of his whiskey as he stops next to the table, looking down at it. It’s open to the Valentine’s page, and he snorts at the ridiculous things people’ve written, everything from bad poetry to what looks like a spoof of
“That would be preferable,” Cas says meaningfully, poking Dean’s shoulder. “Rusalki are rare, and for the most part they are peaceful, helpful spirits.”
Slowly, Jack turns to him.
Sam’s just taken the last bite of his pancakes when Cas lays his paper flat on the table and points at an ad. “Do people still use these advertisements?”
Dean hopes his flush isn’t too obvious in the twilight. “Thanks, man.” He cracks open his water bottle and uses the cap as an impromptu ashtray so he can set the joint down.
Florence + The Machine.
Still got it.

wine, and how can Dean argue with that when wine-drunk Cas is so soft and affectionate and rosy-cheeked? He’s weak; Cas is more likely to sling an unselfconscious arm around his shoulders when he’s like this, to lean into Dean’s side and look at him even more than he usually does. So you can bet that Dean’s never gonna say a goddamned word about it.) He does that very thing as they walk out of the restaurant, actually, except it’s an arm around Dean’s waist instead of his shoulders and he’s—
“Good point,” Dean says as he points the nose of the car towards Kansas. “I think you’re right.”
Sam doesn’t answer right away. “What, uh. What do you mean?”
his brain screams at him. He doesn’t say anything.
“He would,” Dean snorts. “Don’t let the bright-eyed puppy act fool you. He’s told me some
Today wasn’t a good day. It was easier to hide it when they were at the Bunker: Dean would just find a deep corner of the archives, or he’d wrap his hands and hole up in the gym with a punching bag, or he’d take a drive to nowhere with the music blasting so loud it made the speakers futz and crackle in protest. Here, though, he’s got nothing to do, nowhere to go when the howling, cavernous void inside him gets too raw and all-consuming to ignore. So he withdraws. Snaps at Sam, gets pissy. Is miserable, basically, while doing his goddamn best to pretend he isn’t.
“Then let it go!” Dean shouts, grabbing Sam’s arm. The wind has whipped up to gale-force levels, and Dean’s seriously starting to get worried that he and Sam’ll just… blow away. “Don’t give up your life for the world, kid! It’s not worth it!”
By the end of the week, he’s got all of them except Sam laughing at George Weasley ear-humour level jokes about getting nailed real good and being hole-y after all. He counts that as a win.
The command cracks through the air like a whip, leaving the kitchen utterly silent in its wake.
— - —
He cuts himself off, taking a short, sharp breath. “To me. You matter to me. So stow that crap
The bleariness of sleep clears from his face all too quickly when he meets Dean’s gaze and realizes where his limbs have migrated during the night. Dean’s eyes drop helplessly to the bob of his throat when he swallows. “Uh,” he says, his voice sleep-rough in a way that makes Dean’s heart lurch in his chest. “Good morning.”
“Yeah,” Dean says after a long pause. He sounds so very, very tired, and his eyes shift restlessly around the room: the floor. The wall. Bobby, for a short second. (Anywhere but at Cas.) “Yeah, I’ve got this. Go.”
Royally fucked up in more ways than one, decidedly ambivalent about whether or not he continues to exist in this world he fought so hard to save. There’s a price, there’s always a price; and if you weigh the alternative against the billions of people that are out there today, getting to live lives that are fully their own, then Dean guesses that a single guy’s happiness is a small one to pay. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one.
Fuck. He’s so gone it’s

“Gay?” Dean finishes, only a little weakly. He tries for a grin. “Nah. If someone’s got a problem with it, that’s on them. Not my fault they can’t wrap their tiny brains around it.”

Lucifer laughs. “That’s not why I think you won’t punch me.
is what the look Sam gives him says. (Eh. It was worth a try.) “I’ll call her. She said she wanted to see you, anyways. And just so you know, Charlie, Jody, Donna, Claire and Kaia, and Garth have already said they’re gonna be coming down to see you as soon as they start letting visitors in. Which is tomorrow. So, get ready for that.”
- Castiel
But the words catch on the way out. Because however much Dean wants Cas to know, to
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” Dean mutters, and pulls him into a kiss.
Sam leans across the table and Dean spares the paper a sideways glance, both of them reading the swirly red script. Dean rolls his eyes. “Nah, man,” he drawls, nudging Cas with his elbow. “People barely even read newspapers anymore. That kind of sentimental shit only goes down in rom-coms.”
And Dean… Dean deserves something good. God knows he’s given enough, sacrificed enough.
this.”
They sit there for a moment in silence, looking into each other’s eyes. Then one of Cas’ hands slides across the tiny space between them and comes to rest on Dean’s thigh. “Again,” he rumbles. Dean lets out a shuddery breath.
Dean hastily slaps one of his own atop it, pinning it in place.
Love and hugs,
He doesn’t think he could stand after that if he tried. He considers it once or twice, but he’s so
He closes the bathroom door behind him; wouldn’t do to have Sam popping up like an overgrown daisy while he’s trying to flush his drugs down the can. He opens the bottle with a violent twist and dumps the pill into his palm, then extends his hand over the toilet. He’s going to do this.
he reminds himself, his stomach flip-flopping nervously.
The first joint Dean rolls is just. So bad.
He won’t weaponize this.
Dean lets out a slightly delirious laugh. “Okay, first of all, you could ask me whatever the hell you wanted right now and my answer would be ‘fuck yes’. So, fuck yes. But you must be crazy if you think shotgunning is the only time I’m gonna put my mouth on you from now on.”
Dean crosses his arms and leans against the counter. “Yeah. Got some weed, too.”
Dean barks, “get the
“Well, go ahead,” he mumbles, nodding at the plates. “Eat up.”
Castiel has been looking for a sign, for something to guide him. He’s been praying to his Father: countless questions that have all, so far, gone unanswered.
I—” His mouth flattens into a line. “Don’t keep hammering this wedge in,” he finishes, his voice stretched thin. “I don’t wanna lose you, Cas.”
As the silence strings itself out, becoming more and more painful, Cas’ expression closes off. “Apologies,” he says woodenly, his eyes shuttered and dull. “I shouldn’t have said that.”
There’s a slight pause. “Plus,” he continues, running a finger over the rim of his mug. His eyes are piercing. “I’ve always been… partial, to humanity.”
“Hey, you were the one who said you wanted to do it. If we’re gonna do this, we’re gonna friggin’ do this. Capisce?”
It’s surprisingly good, though. And it turns out that shoving a spoonful of it into his mouth is a great way to prevent any ill-timed confessions from slipping out.
you will.”
Florence + The Machine.
“Yeah, well, you weren’t actually
Sam spits, his knuckles white where he grips his gun. “Why not just go after Chuck now?”
“Wow. That’s a better comeback than when the Cubs finally won the series again. You sure do have a way with words.”
Jack nods delightedly. “I asked if I could call her that and she said yes. I think she likes it. We’re friends now.”
Maybe… maybe
Several worrying details pile up in his subsequent survey:
“Nah,” he drawls. “I’ve got better things to do with my mouth. And,” he says with a smirk as he tips his head to show off one of his many (many, many) hickeys, “so does he. So I’d make myself scarce, if I were you. I wouldn’t want us to scar your delicate sensibilities.”
He just has to go sit in the kitchen and call Sam, let him know what’s up. Then… maybe he can drink. Or go sit outside or something.
“Ah,” he says, “thank you. That’s very… yes. Much appreciated.”
and Sam lets out an incredulous, mildly hysterical bark of laughter.
— - —
“You and Jack are going back to the Bunker,” he chokes in Sam’s direction, his voice shredded raw. He doesn’t look away from Cas for a second.
Dean gapes for a long second.
Cas’ bundle, it turns out, is a blanket wrapped around two bottles of water. Wordlessly, he takes the spot Dean’s left open and gets under the layers of blankets, his shoulder pressing warmly against Dean’s as he holds one of the bottles out. “You’re supposed to stay hydrated when you smoke.”
— F. Scott Fitzgerald
The stealth part of their plan went off without a hitch, at least. Michael isn’t paying attention, but Dean saw the way Jack stiffened every time one of the heavy hitters threw a fireball. He was sucking up their power. Maybe… maybe this will work.
Good.
“Right,” Dean says, swallowing down the disappointment that sweeps through him. Of course. It’s— it’s for the case. That’s all. “Yeah, definitely. Good idea.”
He repeats the process, tapping the centre of Cas’ chest when it’s time for him to breathe in. Cas inhales, but doesn’t move away; he stays close, his lips pressed to Dean’s as he holds the smoke in his lungs. He’s stroking his thumb along the outside seam of Dean’s jeans, and Dean. Dean is doing everything in his power to stop himself from crawling into Cas’ lap right here and now.
“He’s worried,” she says simply. “You can’t blame him for that.”
Cas is sitting facing him, both hands cupped around his mug as he stares down into it. A second mug sits at the empty place laid out just around the corner of the table from him, steaming gently.
Fuck it. Dean finally allows himself a look at Cas, just for a second. They’re both grinning like idiots when he turns back to the road. “Good. Me, uh. Me too.” Dean lets his foot lay a little more heavily on the gas pedal as they reach the edge of town, and… man. He doesn’t remember the last time he was this utterly, completely happy. “Let’s go home, Cas.”
He takes an even, regulated breath. Then he grabs a plate in each hand and turns towards the table.
The unseen birds singing their little hearts out, the distant hum of cars passing on the road, that squirrel scampering around the base of the tree over there. Life. The greater good, if you want to get sappy about it.
Chuck — pathetic, human Chuck — has just gone skidding off towards the road after Dean refused to kill him, yelling about how they’ve doomed the universe. Sam and Dean let him go, because they’ve… they’ve got bigger fish to fry.
Waking up next to Cas would’ve been better, though.
Dean is trying to stay awake.
“Hello,” Cas says. He looks anxious. He looks terrified. He looks
Dean sighs, then scowls. “That weed is no longer on the table. Go get your own. I’m not sharing anymore because you’re a traitor.”
he thinks.
He clears his throat, looking determinedly at the road now. “Hey, uh, you never told me. What did that blessing mean that got you so flustered?”
about it, talked about it when Dean told him not to as clearly as he’s ever said anything in this sorry life of his, and then Sam

Then they were
Just before they walk back inside, Charlie tugs him to a stop. Dean looks down at her, and he’s just… so tired. “What?”
Dean slams the door of his room behind him when he goes.
“Please,” he rasps. “Please, Cas. Don’t do this.”
“It’s fine,” Cas says eventually. Then, slowly: “You apologized.”
Cas makes a strange, strangled little noise under Dean’s hands, but at the first brush of their lips, he—
Dean hangs up on Sam’s obnoxious laughter and leans back in his chair, rubbing his eyes. “Hey, Cas,” he calls. “Wanna get room service?”
Dean is.
familiar, now. It never fails to paralyze him.
The room is silent as the grave. Cas doesn’t blink, still staring at Dean. “Yes,” he whispers hoarsely. “I… I understand.”
“Where are you going to put him?” Sam asks carefully. His voice sounds strange.
Sam frowns. “What?”
Michael sighs. “What I can help you do is kill my Father. Lucifer’s contribution will allow the book to be opened and read, and we can finish this. But Castiel’s fate is out of my hands.” Then he looks up again, and his gaze pins Dean to the spot. “Though you should know: if I have to fight Lucifer, I will kill him. I don’t care who he looks like, Dean. He will die.”
He stumbles to his feet, ignoring the protest of his back, and does the bare minimum to keep it down as he gets out into the main room. Where the hell is the whiskey? Sam’s probably squirrelled it away somewhere, that sanctimonious asshole. Whatever. Dean knows him, he should be able to find it without too much trouble.
He might regret this tomorrow, but for now he’s just feeling nice and floaty. So he gives Cas a small smile, tinged with only the slightest hint of wariness, and he picks the joint back up. “Well, if you’re sure, I’ll show you how.”
and Dean can—
Sam turns away from the sad selection of fruit the convenience store has to offer, a splotchy banana still in hand. Cas is holding a polyester teddy bear with a satiny red heart clamped between its fluffy pink paws, staring at it in consternation. Sam grins.
He’s…
Dean makes a noise of assent, pulling the map of the hotel out from under a pile of printouts. “Why the couples, though?”
or some bullshit. But there’s nothing wrong. I just want to get better and get back to hunting. Is that really so bad?”
“If you don’t kiss me again right now I’m gonna freak the fuck out.”
It’s just… y’know, there hasn’t been a case in weeks. They weren’t prepared for how much things calmed down, with Hell locked up and Heaven under Hannah and Gadreel. Cases have been sporadic in the months since it happened, a lot more in tune with the seasons and the phases of the moon than they’ve ever been before, so the three of them — Sam, Dean, and Cas — have found themselves with a hell of a lot of free time on their hands.
Magda either doesn’t notice his sarcasm or doesn’t care, because she bustles closer and reaches up to rest a palm on each of their foreheads. She says a short phrase in that language of hers, then steps back and smiles. “There. Eet is done.”
Something in Cas’ expression cracks wide open, and he says five of the most incomprehensible words Dean’s ever heard.
Except the Cas behind this door… Dean doesn’t dare hope. Not after last time. The Cas behind this door was still and unmoving when Dean laid him down on his bed, when he peeled his shirt off and dressed the wound in his side where Michael stabbed Lucifer. (Because if he woke up, he couldn’t have an open wound. Michael told him it didn’t matter, that Cas would probably be able to heal it if he did wake up, but—)
“If you’d like,” Lucifer rumbles, reaching out to brush his fingers against Dean’s. “I’m more than amenable.”
(He and Sam got some shitty weed that was probably cut with oregano and drove out to a field outside town, lounging on Baby’s hood side by side while they smoked and talked, watching as the sun sunk below the horizon and the stars slowly started to appear. They’d woken up the next morning squashed into Baby’s backseat, freezing cold and with one of Sam’s knees digging into Dean’s ribcage. It was awesome.)
the other part of him shoots back.
He gets with the program.
Sam continues to stew in sullen, scruffy-cheeked silence as the nurse helps Dean put on a nasal cannula and then takes him through some breathing exercises, to make sure he’s not gonna forget how to work his lungs now that there’s no machine doing it for him. Dean obeys, grudgingly. But he’s fine.
“Dean, wait—”
“But why are you
“Later, Sammy!” Dean crows as he strides out of the kitchen. He has coffee to drink, a weird weed hangover to work through, and Cas waiting for him back in his room.
He slowly sits back in his seat, and he’s suddenly
want to mess with the Empty, man. Total bitch, especially after Jack blew up all over her.”
The three hour drive back to Lebanon passes in near silence, but Dean starts to feel himself relax a little as they get closer to the turn off for the Bunker. It’ll be nice to be home. Just a little bit longer, now, and then—
suicidal.
Dean stands and picks up his cereal bowl when he’s done. “I’m goin’ on my walk alone this morning.”
Here and now, the hot ache of frustrated tears throbs under Dean’s cheekbones.
There’s a familiar sort of
Finally, Dean manages to swallow and takes a deep, shuddery breath. “Cas?”
They’re stuck there for a moment, mired in an awkward silence that neither of them knows how to break. Because Cas only ever sleeps when he’s low on mojo.
That’s another cut to the bone. Dean goes pale with anger, with despair, with another wave of betrayal.
Cas blinks.
Barns Courtney.
(See the end of the chapter for
I love you. I love you, I love you, I love you,
Sam lets out a shout and surges forward as Cas catches Dean’s wrists in his hands, but Dean’s already ripping himself out of Cas’ grip and stumbling away before Sam can reach them. His cheeks are wet, his breathing hitched and irregular.
He sets the bottle back down and gets dressed. That can be a problem for later.
but before he can say a thing the crunch of gravel echoes from outside and a pair of headlights spear through the window, sweeping across the room. Dean whips around, betrayal curdling in his stomach.
He’s hyper-aware of every sound that comes from the direction of Sam’s room as he stands at the counter mixing up pancake batter. He slops some flour over the side of the bowl when he hears footsteps, forcing himself not to turn and look when there’s a slight pause before they retreat down the hall towards the bathroom. He almost drops the package of bacon when he hears the door open back up again. He nearly botches a flip when one of the chairs scrapes against the floor.
Sam just looks at him. Dean drinks again, looking at Sam in return. “You should go home. Shower, try and sleep. Eat something.” Then he frowns. “Wait, did someone pick Miracle up from the daycare? You didn’t forget my dog, did you?”
And maybe he should have some regrets about last night.
“Hey, you assholes, I’m—” Sam tries to protest over Dean’s surprised laughter. “You’re unbelievable, Dean. You’re not stupid, but you are
He stares at the opposite wall, eyes unfocused.
Sam’s at the stove making oatmeal for himself when Dean shuffles out into the kitchen the next morning. He just spent a good twenty minutes in his room, psyching himself up for whatever he’d have to deal with when he walked out here, but hallelujah for small mercies: Sam seems to have decided to give him some space. They exchange the bare minimum of words in greeting
don’t go
Dean stares down at his and Cas’ joined hands where they rest on his thigh, feeling like he’s stepped into the fucking Twilight Zone.
“What did he do?”
There are voices; one— no, two he recognizes, more that he doesn’t. There’s crying at one point, muffled, choked-off sobs that trigger something innate and instinctive in Dean’s brain.
His pale excuse for a prayer ends there. He hasn’t stopped praying in the interminable months, not really; doesn’t think he could even if he wanted to. It’s instinct at this point. Even though he knows… even though he knows no one’s listening, and even though he can’t bear to address any of his broken-down whisperings directly. So this is what he has left: sad, disjointed mumbles that dissipate into the air, into the stale emptiness of whatever room they find themselves in. They go nowhere, do nothing. Help no one.
Not openly. Never openly.
He stalls for a second in front of the door, hoping against hope that this isn’t just another one of Chuck’s sick jokes. But the doubt is already being swamped by a warm, buoyant feeling rising in his chest like helium; he pulls the door open, and—
But Sam grabs his arm. “This is about Cas, isn’t it.”
Sam releases Dean’s arm.
“Fuck you.”
Dean’ll get back to playing his part eventually, and when he does, Sam’s just gonna have to deal. It’s worked for the past six months, and it’ll work again.
jeans, not these stiff, slim-fit things they bought at the mall two days ago.
Eventually, he thinks he gets the picture. He’s reasonably certain she’s saying she was trying to turn one of them into a chick.
Sam shakes his head. “Uh, I guess that carbonara you made a couple weeks ago was good. What about that?”
“Well,” Lucifer drawls with a razor-sharp smile, “I was thinking. If you’ve got some unfinished business with
He also looks like he’s trying to pretend he’s not feeling every single positive emotion there is as he regards Sam and Dean. (Mostly Dean.)
He curls one hand into the folds of denim near Dean’s ankle, and goes all but limp in his grasp.
Sam laughs, then looks up at Dean. He stops laughing. “Wait. Really?”
When he looks back on it later, the connection between that astute fucking observation and the call itself is blindingly obvious. In the moment, the significance is blown straight out of the water as soon as he sees the name on the screen.
Sam opens his mouth, but Dean interrupts him. “Gimme that water, huh?” He croaks. “Throat feels like sandpaper.”
Cas watches him. “I missed you,” he admits softly.
jobs, and let
“Jesus, Dean.” Sam sighs. “No, I’m not happy. I just want you to, y’know. Get somewhat better, eventually. And I’m sorry, but I’m at the end of my rope. I don’t know how to help you.”
You don’t— you don’t know what that
They aren’t dressed anywhere near as nice as most of the other people here, but no one looks at them twice as they walk into the room. Well, a couple people do, but Dean’s pretty sure that’s because Cas is a dude and Dean is also a dude. Not because they think the two of them shouldn’t be here.
Dinner, if Dean says so, was a success.
He has a revolving door of visitors. Everyone Sam said, plus Eileen, and Patience and Alex (who both wanted to come too, for some unfathomable reason). It doesn’t look like Sam’s shared his fears with any of them, at least: no one tearfully asks if he’s okay or if he’s feeling depressed. Well, Garth
Then his fingers connect with Cas’ shoulder.
So he answers honestly, tonelessly. “Where’s it leave us? Screwed. I’m sure Chuck’s ready to make a move.”
“This isn’t working, I should just— fuck it. I’m sleeping on the couch.”
Cas.”
And he puts his hands on the program’s hips, walking him backwards until they hit a wall. He kisses the program so stupid it feels like his brain got whisked up with an electric beater and leaked out of his ears.
He doesn’t remember getting out of bed; one moment he’s there, the sheets pooled around his waist, and the next he’s at the door, yanking it open with his back practically
That’s another sacrifice he makes for Dean’s benefit. It’s always another sacrifice.
drinking in every tiny, imperfect, impossible-to-fabricate detail about him: the way his hair curls just behind his ears. The lines at the corners of his eyes. The shadow of stubble on his jaw. The faint little mole just above the arch of his right eyebrow.
I’d be happy to let you work it out. You’re distracted, big boy, and we can’t have that. Gotta have your eyes on the prize.”
And he opens the door.
He’s got a less intense version of that shell-shocked look from the end of last night plastered across his face, and Dean’s stomach drops right past rock bottom to some new subterranean low.
Wait.
Dean growls. “And because I’m a fucking coward I didn’t tell you anywhere near as much I should’ve. I saved it for, for when one of us was
Dean picks up the joint and turns a little so he’s kind of facing Cas. Then before he can think himself out of it he takes a drag, hooks a hand around the back of Cas’ neck, and seals their mouths together.
The Cas behind this door was dead when Dean last saw him. And if he’s still dead when Dean sees him again…
Dean crosses his arms, quietly mourning the loss of Cas’ hand when he withdraws it. “You don’t know that.”
His mouth moves, but he’s not exactly talking. The sound he makes actually hurts to hear, like, a

Dean,” Cas says harshly, desperately ignoring Dean’s last words. “None of you can. Do you know where to find a store of power large enough to let me beat Raphael? Do you have a weapon stashed away that I can use? No. I didn’t think so.”
“No one has ever called me beautiful before,” Cas said finally, his hands twisting in the table cloth, making Dean worry that he was going to pull it and his desserts onto the floor.
“The last time I died, I didn’t think I would be coming back at all. The Empty had prepared for my arrival and put me straight into a sort of padded cell of nothingness. It was like being restrained and suffocated, by inexistence itself.”
Cas was more than flagging, his body was swaying as he struggled to keep himself upright in the hard-backed chair. His argument with Kate instantly dismissed, Dean rushed over to Cas and grabbed his wrist to check his pulse, feeling his forehead with the back of his hand.
“Dean… don’t,” Cas whispered. He didn’t even know what Dean was going to say, but the potential of what he
"No they won't. And if they do, let them. If I can't be here for you when you need me, what's the point of me?"
"Not just you. Anyone." Dean needed Cas to know that it wasn't
That was the day Dean had finally given in and gone on a hunt. He knew hunting alone wasn't ideal, but he'd been trying to distract himself, idly flicking through news stories and this one was close by, so close that if he snuck out when Sam and Eileen were asleep, he could be back before anyone even noticed he was missing.
Yeah, that didn't help. At all. Because what felt right to Dean was pinning Cas to this exquisitely soft mattress of his and kissing him until he forgot how much Dean had screwed up, until it was like it had never happened. And he knew that wasn't what Cas wanted or needed from him.
Dean looks like he’s been slapped.
“Fuck.” The curse punches out of him as he drops his forehead into his hand. “I’m such a jackass.”
He chews on that for a second. “Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. I’ll keep that in mind.”
Sam’s on a video call with Eileen when Dean finally emerges; he raises a hand towards the camera in greeting before shouldering past Sam to get his coffee, and then slips out onto the porch when Sam’s back is turned. He just… he just wants a little more time to himself. Just a little bit more before he has to deal with Sam’s staring and judgment all day.
“No, no silver or anything. I’ll just…” He takes a breath and looks at Jack. “What did I tell you after you flew the first time?”

“Bitch,” Dean grunts. “Y’re a
he is. He has to be.
in the universe I would rather be than by your side.
“Cas, you almost ready? We’ve gotta check out before eleven, and I don’t think this is the kinda place I can bribe the front desk at, man—”
Cas’ thumb bumps over his vertebrae again. “But you’re telling me.”
So, uh… sorry about that one? That nightmare physically hurt me to write, so like… I am legitimately sorry. But Cas is back! So! That’s good!
Dean and Cas are just standing there. Staring at each other.
“In here,” comes Cas’ voice. “I couldn’t sleep, so I got coffee.”
He doesn’t stick around to see if Sam agrees. So Sam is left sitting alone in the main room of the cabin, with a half-empty bottle of whiskey in front of him, telling himself he did this to make things better.
as loud as he can stand.
Dean doesn’t know whether that’s supposed to be offensive or complimentary. He doesn’t find out, though. Michael’s gone before he can figure out if he wants to ask.
The coffee tastes weird. Dean makes a face, giving it a disappointed look as he sets it aside.
"When's the last time you hooked up with a woman?" Kate asked Dean casually, neat white teeth biting into the soft, sugary dough. Kate was capable of putting away more junk food than anyone Cas had ever met, except for Dean. A lot of the women Cas had met seemed to pick at their food, graze more than eat, but Kate relished every single morsel of food that was put in front of her.
"You don't get a choice in this," Cas said harshly, closing the cuts too. Then, still straddling Dean's waist, Cas looked at him expectantly.
"You," Cas said between kissing his cheek and the corner of his mouth, "are so fucking," he placed a kiss
"Maybe she just doesn't like you?"
"Jesus Christ."
"We've got work to do," Jack had reminded him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"When
"Someone's in a bad mood," Gabriel observed. "Last time I saw you, you were practically walking on air. Trouble in paradise, children?"
Cas downed his drink. There wasn't enough alcohol in this bar to get him through this.
"I'm willing to agree to that." Dean could hear Cas smiling again. "They sound like very happy memories."
Dean pulled back to look at Cas, shaking his head incredulously. "Yeah, well whatever her name was, she had a fucking excellent right hook."
Cas nodded, looking down at his feet instead of torturing himself by letting him look at Dean's beautiful face. Chuck
“It turned him into a fucking toddler,” Dean hissed, hoping that Cas was too engrossed in his food to be listening. He watched Cas trying to get all the noodles from his soup onto his spoon in one go. “Trusting, naive, unsafe! Anything could have happened to him!”
"Boyfriend, then?" he asked, when Dean looked back down at his phone again without answering.
Sam and Cas were back shortly after, both of them with plates full of food that Dean would rather starve to death than attempt to eat.
"Stop," Dean demanded, his voice hoarse. "Stop looking at me like I'm something I'm not. I've done things to people, with people."
Dean shook his head, as if trying to clear water from his ears, and only then did he tear his eyes away from Cas who was steadfastly trying not to look straight at Dean. He had decided to focus on an antique looking dresser in the corner.
"The bar. It’s a joke, you’re lawyers." He looked for support from Sam, who just shook his head in despair.
supposed to be doing that. You can do that any time you feel like it."
"Do you have pie?"
Eileen appeared at the bottom of the stairs, splodges of paint on her chin and forehead.
“I made Pizza!”
"Tell me I'm seeing things," Dean shouted to Kate, his eyes now fixed on the sight of Castiel, Angel of the Lord, dancing topless in the centre of a large rotating cage.
Dean downed the rest of his beer and started to try to down his glass of champagne, but the bubbles must have gone up his nose and he pulled a face like he was an Alsation who had just had a wasp fly up his nose. Cas burst into fits of laughter.
"Then who would walk you back again?" Cas looked genuinely confused.
Never a man who was outwardly sentimental, Dean could still admit to himself that Sam and Eileen's wedding was just beautiful. Eileen, in a way that was just so perfectly
The loud ringing that came from his pocket made him wince. It wasn’t as if being directly outside Dean’s door was a particularly clever hiding place, but there had been a tiny, minuscule chance that Dean hadn’t been aware that he was out there until his ringtone had given him away.
think it would be funny, or wanted to take him home? It only takes a second to drop something in someone's drink."
"I've been talking to Claire," Cas confessed. "I can't get her to be any more careful though."
Dean blinked. "No? Pizza. A Meat Feast pizza, to be exact."
"You know what? I've had enough. I don't want to know. You've never left me out of the loop like this before, and I don't know if it's resentment because I'm happy with Eileen, or if it's some secret boyfriend bond you guys have going on, but for the record, being left out feels really, really shit."
"Please don't hate me," Cas pleaded. He reached out one hand to touch Dean's cheek, but Dean caught his wrist before Cas' hand could reach him, holding it in a bruising grip.
grimace and shrug combo had left Dean feeling both annoyed and guilty. When he went to bed he was decidedly fucked off. He was a hunter. Hunting was what he did. They were as well asking him to stop eating pie and driving Baby as they were trying to stop him hunting. It was his entire identity - what was he without it?
There was a loud knock at the door.
"Coffee," he offered with a look in his eyes that made Cas feel like he was being offered something much more forbidden.
"She's not your type," Cas lied. Kate was exactly his type. Dark, pretty, intelligent and not afraid to stand up for herself. But she was the only thing Cas currently had that was unconnected to Dean, and Cas didn't want to be able to picture them together when Dean undoubtedly got her into bed. Very few women could resist when he put all his charm to the job of getting someone naked. Cas had a startling thought that if Dean had ever turned that sort of attention on him he would have turned into a mess with embarrassing speed. Maybe it was a good thing that he hadn't.
"And what's with all the sexual tension here? You were bad enough before, but now you two look like you'll combust if you touch each other. Cross the wires, see what happens. You might like it." Balthazar winked at Dean suggestively.
“Why? Did you want her to kiss you?”
“I was told…” Cas stopped, feeling suddenly horribly disloyal.
"Alright, buddy," Dean tried to soothe in his best calming voice. "The whole point of me being here right now is to help you sleep, so we do kinda need a bed. As much as you look terrified at the prospect."
Dean shoved Cas again, hard enough to hurt.
"What I said to you before the Empty took me…" Cas started, the churning in his stomach increasing tenfold at the mere mention of it.
"Tell me you're lying," he demanded. "Bring him to me now, or I'm going to stay here and make this place feel like Times fucking Square every day for the rest of my life. There will be no peace for any of you. I will bring people here again; dogs, witches, hunters. I will call for Amara and I will help her hunt down every last one of you. I will make it my life's mission to destroy you… unless you give him back to me."
"Careful Kate. Let your guard down and she’ll have you away. I know that look." He glanced behind and spotted Cas, who had just appeared at the bar alongside Claire and Kaia. Cas' eyes found his and he smiled, and Dean almost missed what Rowena was saying for the second time that day.
"Please, Cas."
"Yeah. Good plan."
Cas looked away again. He shouldn't have felt sorry for Chuck, but he did. The former deity was being used, a means to an end, and whatever reason he'd had for coming here, he didn't actually deserve this. It wasn't up to them to punish him, this was just horrific and cruel.
"Cas, can I turn the light on? I need… I want to watch you. Can I?"
"I need you to understand before we get to that point, because it's not fair on you if we do this and you think-"
"I can't do this again. Nothing has changed."
He was so close now that Cas' eyes couldn't focus and Dean's face was blurring in front of him. He closed his eyes and took a steadying breath.
of our people?” Sam asked hopefully, fixating on one single part of the dialogue with a hopeful look on his face.
Blissfully unaware of the very vivid pictures going through Dean’s mind, Cas was looking thoughtful.
Dean had played out every scenario, every attempt at making him understand, and each time Dean would see nothing but that same cold, hard, immovable look, that disgust and judgement that had followed him for years—that oh so familiar absence of all empathy. No matter how hard Dean tried, he could never force his imagination to get what he needed from the man—contrition, acceptance, those words—
"Oh, I'm great. Never better."
"You know, I actually really like cuddling," Cas said thoughtfully from behind Dean. "I've not really done it before, but it makes going to bed a much more pleasant experience."
"I would give you almost anything you asked for," Cas ground out as Dean violently thrashed in an effort to get his hands back, suspecting strongly that Cas was using his Grace to add to his strength. "But I will never, ever treat you like a monster, because you're not one, Dean."
How difficult was it to get a little time alone together? Now that his mind had finally caught up with his body and figured out what was going on, it felt like they’d been apart for decades already, and these extra hours felt like years.
He shifted uncomfortably, surreptitiously adjusting his jeans as the fingers on his skin started to do their job. He was wound too tightly to be this close to Dean right now. He was steeled, ready to attack, and if Dean didn't stop breathing into his ear like that, he wasn't going to hold back - he was going to drag Dean's frustrating, perfect backside into his bedroom and plan or not, they wouldn't be coming out of there for a week.
The gap remained open, seemingly forgotten, and Cas moved to the far side of the shower, just as uncaring about this as he had been about stripping off in front of Dean moments earlier. Through the gap, Dean could see much more of Cas now, his head bowed, hands braced against the tiled shower wall as water cascaded down over his head and in constant rivulets down his back, washing the shampoo down the drain. Cas' eyes were closed, his body relaxing more and more with every slow, deep, steamy breath of air that he drew into his lungs. This wasn't a shower—it was porn, and Dean was already unbearably hard.
"I very much appreciate that."
"Yeah, because that's not fucking sinister at all!"
Next Sam had tried the 'Cas lost his eternal life to give you this, you ungrateful bastard' tack, and that had actually worked considerably better, even if it had ratcheted up Dean's internal guilt. When Dean had reluctantly admitted that something had to give, they'd talked about what was important to Dean. This turned out to be essentially his friends and family, Cas (and Dean didn't want to try to work out why Cas had his own category), Miracle, and making the lake house a home. Those were almost all things he could work on and throw himself into, so he did.
"Cas, are you naked?" They could switch to a video call…
Dean tried to hide his amusement as he picked up the remote. Occasionally Cas was completely ridiculous.
"See how you tremble at my touch?" Cas asked, his voice quiet, his eyes serious. His thumb brushed over Dean's mouth.
"As much as I'd like to continue with the ruination of our friendship - Sam's waiting for us with, um, meat."
silence Dean liked far less.
mean something, Cas."
“She’s only got six months left, and then she'll be working with the children full time,” Cas said conversationally.

it made him hard.
Why was he crying?
Dean's heart seemed to stutter.
"My dad actually apologised for beating Josh. He's good at apologising afterwards.
"No, don't come here!" Sam hissed.
"I should have mentioned that it works a lot like an aphrodisiac," Cas said, not answering Dean's proposal. "It will fade in a few minutes, I only gave you a tiny amount."

unless that was the plan all along!”
How fucked up is that, huh?
And lmao I’ve already gone off schedule. I knew this was gonna happen, but whatever. Them’s the breaks, right? Don’t worry, I fully intend to finish this story, it just might get a lil choppy from here on out. Love you guys, and thanks so much for the support <3
Dean gets up at a reasonable time. He sits at the table and reads the newspaper on his phone while Sam makes breakfast, takes his meds with his coffee and eats what gets set in front of him, sprinkling in some annoyance about Sam’s health nut shit whenever the situation demands it. Then they get dressed and go on a walk; doctor’s orders. “Mild physical activity” until he doesn’t feel like an octogenarian, and then slowly working back up to normal levels. Well, normal for normal people. It’ll probably take him a little longer than the upper estimate of eight weeks until he can take out a werewolf or a vampire again. Which he fully plans on doing. But that depends on whether he’s able to convince Sam he’s not about to eat a bullet or walk into a knife.
He’s considering placing bets on how long it’ll take him to break.
Or, they almost trigger something. Dean’s so smothered in gauzy, cotton-wool haziness that the impulse fizzles out before it does anything more than catch his attention for a fleeting second, a tug in his gut that fades almost before he registers it.
can’t.
Cas doesn’t say anything back, so the conversation dies again. They just sit in silence, drinking their coffee and eating Dean’s pancakes. Well, Cas does most of the eating, actually, and isn’t that a fucking weird way for their usual dynamic to flip on its head. Dean’s pretty sure his appetite left the building somewhere between thinking Cas coming back was a dream and realizing he was probably dangerously short on Grace, and it hasn’t come back. There are too many things swirling around in his head for him to be hungry right now.
Sam narrows his eyes. “You say that like I’ve got a limit.”
He’s torn, now, between craving Cas’ touch like a dying man craves water and having the very thought of him — curled up behind Dean, or idly playing with his hair, or pressing a kiss to his cheek — make his skin prickle with discomfort and uncertainty.
Well. Maybe on this case.
Then he takes a drink of coffee, and halfway through the motion Dean’s breath whooshes out of his lungs. Because there’s a faint red mark on Cas’ jaw.
Cas winces slightly. “‘Sam Winchester, the boy with the demon blood.’ I never apologized for that, Sam. I’m sorry. I truly didn’t mean it the way it sounded.”
and deliberately puts his book down on the table. He doesn’t seem embarrassed, but he isn’t looking at Dean, either. “It’s a Valentine’s Day message board. You pay a small fee to have a message of your choosing appear in the February 14th issue of the Lebanon Herald.”
Dean can’t help but pray, his stomach turning miserably.
“Don’t mock me,” Cas says, a defensive bite to his voice. “Do what you need to to come to terms with this, but don’t attempt to shame me for it. It’s
He’s upright in half a second flat, cold, clammy fear swamping him like a tidal wave. Cas is— oh god, did he— did he
He sets the glasses down as he sits in the sagging armchair across from Dean, cracking the bottle open and pouring a measure into each one. Dean picks his up and waits for Sam to set the bottle aside before clinking their glasses together. He grins and it’s flinty, bladelike. “I don’t know about you, but this is gonna be a shot for me. No questions until I’m on my third one, got it?”
That’s what couples do, isn’t it? Go on dinner dates and hold hands and look into each other’s eyes?
“Less than ten minutes?” He asks, phone still cradled against his ear. “Okay. Okay, I can keep him awake until then. I’ve got him.”
Dean doesn’t think he’s ever honestly been pitied by an archangel until now. Turns out he hates it just as much as he hates being pitied by anyone else. “Castiel is an enigma,” Michael explains. “There has never been a being like him, and there will never be another one. He has Grace, but it hasn’t been fitting right for quite some time. You must have noticed. He’s not an angel, and he’s not human. He is… something else.”
Dean points a shaking finger at him, guilt crawling up his throat like bile. “Say you understand me. Or I could go on, if that wasn’t clear enough for you.”
Dean points a pancake-laden fork at Sam. “Damn right. But I’m not gonna lie,” he says as he takes a bite, “th’ chocl’t s’les aft’r r’ gread.”
“Well,” Dean says.
“Fuck!” Dean shouts as he scrambles upright, Cas doing the same next to him. A tiny old woman with steel grey hair pulled back into a bun stands in the doorway to their bedroom, smoothing down the front of her cleaning lady’s uniform with nervous hands.
God, he hates that.
Absently, Dean tugs Cas’ hand a little closer. “I mean, it— it could. Eventually.”
“It was gonna be a surprise. So. Surprise, I guess.”
He sits back abruptly. “Shit, sorry. I shoulda… I should’ve told you what… fuck. M’sorry, Cas.”
and Sam opens his laptop next to him once he’s sat down. The silence as they eat isn’t
“What, on your bed? You won’t… need it?”
Dean’s only reaction, he’s a little proud to say, is to blink. And maybe to stiffen slightly, like he’s turning to stone.
— right here, right now — feels more right than anything else he has done in the interminable, lonely months since he watched Dean rake leaves in Lisa Braeden’s yard. Right or wrong, blessing or blasphemy— he doesn’t care. Dean could punch him, could beat him bloody, and Cas wouldn’t raise a finger against him. He would deserve it. He— he wants to make things right. He’ll do whatever penance Dean asks of him. Anything.
“Nah,” he says with a tight grin. “I’m good.”
comes the whispered assurance.
The four-door parked in front of the cabin glints dully in a faint patch of moonlight, mist shifting through the strong yellow beams of the headlights. The passenger door opens as Dean spills out onto the porch, Sam scrambling to follow him and grab at his sleeve. He doesn’t need to bother trying to drag Dean to a halt, though. Dean’s already standing stock still.
He has a beer in his hands, but he’s not drinking it. Funny, how they’ve all been doing that lately. Occupying their hands with beers they won’t finish.
rolling out from him in impossible waves. Dean holds onto Sam, squinting, crying, feeling like he’s coming apart at the atoms, and—
Behind them, someone lays on their horn. Dean jumps a little and looks up. Fuck.
For a moment, Dean considers protesting. He doesn’t want to go to some
His phone buzzes, pulling him back out of his head some, but he doesn’t take it out to check it. He just focuses on getting himself into a mindset better suited for social interaction before Charlie gets here. Depressed doom and gloom doesn’t go over well with other people, and he’s… he’s supposed to be trying. Trying to be happy, to make the most of the sacrifice that was dumped in his lap.
Dammit, Sam must’ve spilled the beans. Dean’s rescinding his offer. No weed for traitors.
The Lumineers.
feels like it.
That’s bullshit. Next to Cas, Dean has the highest alcohol tolerance Sam’s ever seen.
“Cas.”
“Why?”
Because it’s obvious why Jack sent him back here. This is where Cas is, and Cas makes Dean happy. You don’t have to be a genius to figure that one out.
Cas looks over at him, and their faces are way too close for Dean to be able to breathe properly. He can see every smile line at the corners of Cas’ eyes. “It’s a public area. It’s a good place to be seen, if you’re amenable to it.”
“Then… could we do it again?”
Then after the walk they separate, do their own thing. Dean puts on music, or pulls a paperback off the bookshelf, or watches Netflix. Sam… Dean doesn’t know what Sam does. He doesn’t really care. Most days someone’ll come by: Eileen or Charlie, usually, and that’s fine. Eileen wipes the floor with him at cards, and Charlie brings Miracle and her Nintendo.
