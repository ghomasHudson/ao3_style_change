"They're sitting in the cellar of this very building as we speak," Lestrade confirmed. "Now what is this all about, Mr Holmes?"
Out of the corner of his eye Holmes was watching Lyndale and Garner, who had drawn ahead of us. Garner was murmuring something to Lyndale, who looked taken aback.
"Well, you're certainly doing a bloody good job of driving me away." I said it gently, taking his hand in mine and kissing it.
Holmes leant forward, his voice and posture urgent. "It's not just a matter of insurance fraud, you know. Three innocent men were seriously injured in those warehouse fires. Livelihoods were ruined."
"I suppose this is the other room that was occupied last night?" he said, indicating the adjoining drawing room visible through an open pair of double doors. It struck me that with the doors open, the cabinet was visible from a good part of the drawing room, as well as from the entirety of the salon in which it stood.
. Inside, the smell of food permeated everything, over-boiled but hot and filling. A collection of handbills pasted on the wall by the door advertised everything from an under-eighteens boxing tournament to a lecture on the principles of vaccination against rabies by the Limehouse Philosophical Society.  An open door on the left of the hallway led to a large dim room filled with long wooden trestle tables. It was early yet, and the room was almost empty. Only a few men sat at the tables closest to the windows, reading old newspapers or talking quietly. On the wall hung a large crucifix, and dotted about the room were effigies of the Virgin Mary, the saints and so on.
He rose to his feet, and we followed suit. After Lyndale had taken his leave of us, I sat back down by the fire, shaking my head in dismay.
Holmes tutted his tongue at me. "Our barber is a Roman Catholic, Watson. Surely you have noticed this?"
"I suppose it was when you realised your father was a criminal and a fraudster," Holmes said gently.
Father Garner gave us a small, superior smile. "It has occurred to me how peculiar it is that the theft should occur on the very night that someone was present who could instantly detect it. Were I in your shoes, Mr Holmes, I would have a particular interest in Monsignor Pinet."
"They're building a railway bridge," I explained. "It will be the longest in the world, apparently."
"We haven't even finished with the furnishings," Mrs. Mackay put in. "That empty corner there will hold a cabinet, for example - although the thieves took everything I intended to display in it," she added in a disconsolate voice.
We emerged from the passageway into a small, dingy courtyard, lit only by the small amount of moonlight that managed to filter down through the gap between the rooftops far above. Our mark was nowhere to be seen. I came to a sudden stop, snatching Holmes by the arm and pulling him back into the passageway.
We crossed a wide paved yard, the sound of organ music growing stronger all the while. We stepped through the church door, and were greeted by the booming thunder of one of Bach's cantatas. Holmes' face brightened. He can be rather Baroque himself at times.
Our visitor Gregory Lyndale arrived within the hour, accompanied by a gentleman in a cassock, who was introduced as Monsignor Pinet, recently arrived from Rome. Lyndale was a large, portly man. He had a face made to be jovial, but this morning it was cast in lines of worry. His companion appeared a great deal more sanguine, and after shaking our hands he quietly took a seat, allowing Mr Lyndale to do all the talking.
We had done very little talking last night; indeed, we had communicated extraordinarily well without needing any words at all. Now, however, Holmes was at the far side of the breakfast table, and looking his most inapproachable.
Holmes had risen and started reading long before I had, and I was still on the Times' Letters to the Editor when he laid aside his final newspaper and glanced at his watch.
His hand twitched, as though he longed to reach out and take mine. "You are one in a million, Watson, and I am a fool. And yet I cannot change the way I am." His hand clenched convulsively on the table, in a fierce though restrained display of anger such as I rarely saw from him.
Holmes placed the jug on his dresser. "I'll just leave this here for you, shall I?" he said with brisk efficiency, and I realised that he was as nervous and uncertain as I was.
"You may all come out into the yard now, if you like," Holmes told us. He waved me over to the kitchen window.
I followed him down the stairs and out onto the street, the excitement of the journey already mounting in me, and my nightmares of earlier in the evening entirely forgotten. I could not think of anything better at that moment than returning to my native city with the man who loved me by my side.
He sat back, looking smug. "It's quite simple, Watson. We are confronted with an impossible crimeâ€”therefore the crime did not occur."
"Inspector, I shall need you to send a constable to Baker Street at seven o'clock this evening. Let it be a stout, hearty man, who isn't afraid of a little rough and tumble. He is likely to be set upon with physical violence."
However, I had not forgotten his hint that afternoon that the night could hold an interesting development in the case. Excusing myself, I stepped outside, and had the good fortune to glimpse the back of Holmes' tall figure, disappearing down the steps to the kitchen. I raced after him, and finally caught up with him in the dark stable lane behind the house.
I wished that he would come over and seat himself on the bed, so that I could put my arms around him, so miserable and angry he looked. "Please don't torture yourself so, my dear man! I assure you, I would have reacted in exactly the same manner."
Holmes remained upright in the middle of the floor. Although he must have been ruminating on what he would say throughout our walk, it nevertheless took him a few moments to begin hesitantly to speak.
Fortunately, Lestrade was there when I arrived. I passed on Holmes' request, and saw him carry it out, then waited with him in his office for Holmes' arrival.
"Indeed. And it's an odd coincidence that a person with such knowledge as his should have been there precisely on the night of the theft." After a reflective pause, he added, "Still, for the moment there's no particular reason to suspect him of anything but an overestimation of his own worth."
He was still standing much too far away from me, his face whiter and more haggard than could be accounted for simply by the sleepless night he had most likely passed.
We followed the stream of people in the opposite direction, back to its source, through the door and along a corridor, and came to a small chapel attached to the soup kitchen, invisible from the outside. It looked like a service had just ended.
After some time I opened my eyes to find Holmes looking at me the same way he had ten minutes earlier, warm and appreciative, almost wondering. I raised my eyebrows, posing a silent question.
We arrived back at Baker Street about an hour before dinnertime. I closed the sitting room door behind me, and hung my outer clothing on the coatstand, then stepped aside to allow Holmes to do the same.
I presumed she did not want Mrs Spencer or her father to have her new address. I had not seen enough of Lyndale's true face to know how he would treat her, but I could well imagine Mrs Spencer's icy tirade.
"Precisely. Lyndale's plan was not a bad one. I'll admit the business with the cameos could have held a certain intellectual interest, had it been a true crime. But it was all in vain, since his men didn't manage to break into Baker Street, even with a whole afternoon in which to do so at their leisure."
"In that case, my dear fellow, our task is simple. All we have to do is be present in the house at the time of that next burglary, along with the police. I shall show myself, he will recognise me and most likely panic and attempt to shoot me, the way I suppose he did when he startled the man in the Gordons' hallway - though what he was doing there I still don't understand. Then we shall have him for attempted murder, which will see him hang."
Holmes, naturally, was looking out the other window, absorbed in the bustle of shops and people: office clerks and bankers on their way to work, street-hawkers already at their pitches, and sundry other ruffians and gentlefolk.
Her interlocutor had raised his voice now too. "Don't you cross me, my girl. Remember, you have another life to protect. Remember your dear - "
Less than a minute later, we saw a shadow slip through the gate, and come to stand by the side door of the kirk. I felt from the slight change in Holmes' stance that he had seen it too. There was little to distinguish, only that the man was small and slight, and muffled against the cold.
"No," said Holmes. "Your brother did. However, I am here on my own account, not his. You need have no fear, Mrs Smith."
It was very astute of him, and I could not help feeling admirative, despite the obnoxious manner with which he had delivered the observation. It seemed almost purposefully designed to awake irritation and opposition in the heart of all listeners.
"And London's Catholics are not particularly numerous, and surely as gossip-prone as any other group. I'm sure I can learn something from him about a family as prominent in society as the Lyndales."
Holmes was already pulling on his overcoat. "I intend to get a haircut, Watson. I suggest you do the same."
"I have my own reasons for wanting to speak to her. But I'm certainly not going to set her family on her tail." He reached for his hat and coat. "Come, Watson. If you are ready let us leave at once."
He stood by the fireplace, lit only by the faint red glow of the embers. I could feel his gaze on me. I stepped forward to stand before him, and he reached out to cup my cheek in one hand.
"Wait a moment," I murmured before stepping forward cautiously, my revolver in my hand, and all my senses on alert.
Holmes nodded in acknowledgement. "If you ever want to communicate with some member of your family, please know you may do so under cover of our address. 221b Baker Street."
Holmes' lips and cheeks were still cold to the touch, but his tongue was warm as it reached for mine, and his hands on my waist pulled me closer to him.
Suddenly I understood what I had already sensed to be wrong, when the shadow that should not have been there moved. I dived back towards Holmes, but not quickly enough. Pain seared through my shoulder, and the world spun around me as I sank to the ground.
Holmes smiled. "It's quite simple. I have let it be known, through certain channels, that the papers from our Limehouse arson case will no longer be held at Baker Street. A constable will pick them up this evening and take them to be held securely at Scotland Yard."
Two members of the Franciscan congregation had been present at Lyndale's dinner, but one of them was absent from the friary when we arrived.
He surged up to meet me, and we rolled together, so that he lay above me, one hand entwined in mine, propping himself up on the bed. The look of focus on his face was exquisite, a small line of concentration between his brows as he studied me.
"All arising from one foolish mistake which ruined her life, and which has already punished her a thousand times over. I think you and I can readily comprehend the mental suffering of someone who lives in constant fear of drawing the harsh condemnation of our so moral society. I didn't put it to the police in quite those terms, of course."
I eyed Holmes warily. "The doctor's been, I suppose? Another doctor, that is to say." The answer was already obvious from my professionally bandaged shoulder, but I was merely producing sound, any utterance serving to break this odd, tense silence.
I was surpised to hear Miss Lyndale had been visiting Father Briggs' soup kitchen. It was not something that ladies of her class, of any religion, generally did. They preferred to do their charity work at a distance. Visiting the poor on their country estates was fine, but they preferred to keep the urban paupers at a distance. Every fashionable lady in London had organised a bazaar or held a dinner party for charitable works, but few of them had ever ventured into the vast sprawling slums of the East End.
I was relieved to see him still there when I arrived, standing on the Cathedral steps. He came down the steps towards me, his face unfathomable, but there was no mistaking the sincerity in his voice when he said:
I blinked, surprised. I had not expected Father Briggs to be sympathetic to her, much less for him to imply that he knew where she was, and had perhaps even aided her in her flight.
I knew what the word 'recusant' meant, but I also knew better than to interrupt Holmes when he was in full flow.
"It seems the dead do not object to us," Holmes said dryly, his hands still holding me close. "They're keeping their silence, at any rate."
I scarcely had time to doff my coat and sit down before Mrs Hudson announced Mr Nicholas Lyndale, accompanied by Mr Huntington.
He rang the bell, and the maid who had served us our tea reappeared. She was short and portly, and I thought she would have appeared quite amiable, were her eyes not red-rimmed from crying. I wondered what had happened to upset her so.
Darkness had fallen, and he was only a dim shadow now. I rose to draw the curtains and light the gas lamp. As I moved about the room, I turned over the details of the case in my mind.
When I turned again to face him, he was standing by the door to his room, watching me. I wanted nothing more than to go to him and curl up beside him in bed.
"Let us hope, nonetheless, that you will yet manage to find some measure of the usual thrill in hearing the facts recounted now, before they are quite confirmed or the story complete." He leant back in the coach-seat, his sharp chin resting on the tips of his joined fingers. "It's a tangled web, no doubt, but I was first put on the right trail by the spate of burglaries in the neighbourhood, all evidently committed by someone possessing a key to each house - "
"We're looking for a Mr Smith who once gave a lecture here on the thermodynamics of steam engines," Holmes said after we'd exchanged greetings.
After a few minutes, the mattress shifted beneath me. I heard the click of Holmes' cigarette case, and then the sound of a match being struck. I opened my eyes. Holmes was sitting up in the bed, looking down at me with an affectionate half-smile. His hair stood up in disheveled tufts, his cheeks still flushed, his collar askew. He held out his cigarette case to me, but I shook my head. I simply wanted to drink in the sight of him like that.
The son, Nicholas Lyndale, was already in the room with a young man who turned out to be one of the people featured in our list of reception guests, namely Mr William Huntington. The two young men were sitting in armchairs by the window, deep in conversation, forgotten novels lying open in their laps.
He grinned at me. Gone was the aloof, unapproachable marble sculpture of this morning, and in its place this high-spirited, keen-edged fellow, eyes sparkling with enthusiasm.
"Your brother is concerned about you," Holmes said as we stood on the doorstep. "Your family wonders where you are."
Holmes clucked his tongue in irritation upon seeing the well-scrubbed hallway floor and the thoroughly beaten-out rug. He spent scarcely a minute looking around, before demanding to see where all the keys in the house were kept. One set lay in a drawer in the hallway, and Gordon indicated the key to the back door, which had been found open on the morning after the murder. Holmes examined the key closely, and to my mind it seemed that he relied far more on the sense of touch than his eyes in his examination, but whatever he was seeking he did not seem to find it.
Now we could finally look into the face of the burglar, extortioner and murderer. He was a mild-faced, middle-aged man, slightly overweight, and it was easy to see how he passed in daytime for a respectable cabinet-maker and guildhall member. Only his cold hard eyes spoke of the depths of depravity which lay behind that innocuous mask.
I knew from my guidebook that this crescent of houses was the latest addition to Edinburgh's magnificent New Town, but I left it to Mr. Mackay to answer Holmes' question.
I already knew all that before we arrived, and I did not feel particularly further enlightened by the time we climbed into the carriage back to Baker Street. The Winstons and Armstrongs had not been able to tell us anything of interest, except to reassure us that it seemed entirely impossible anyone should have touched the cameos, given the crowd of people who had been present in the salon the entire evening.
I myself was not ready to dismiss the trauma of family estrangements so easily. I had seen my fair share of it, culminating when my brother was expelled from the University of Edinburgh for drunkenness beyond the usual limits, quarrelling and theft. Our father had not spoken to him until the day of his own death, and my only consolation had been that my mother had not lived to see the scandal.
"Ha!" he exclaimed. "Here's a thing, Watson. Mr Gregory Lyndale will call on me at 11 o'clock this morning, if it be convenient to me." He glanced at the clock on the mantlepiece. "Well, it's ten past ten now, and I am at home and have already finished all my newspapers, so I suppose we may say it is convenient to me. Quick, Watson, hand me Who's Who."
Everything slowed down. I watched in shock as he fell from the building his coat flying behind him. It was all a blur. Then time sped up and before I could react he was already on the ground
"Yes, I'm fine." I said this in a tone which clearly told him I was not up for discussing if I was alright or not, with him. "Just get on with the case already, I'm growing impatient."
"You'll be hearing from me Sherlock" Moriarty said while walking away. Sherlock kept his gun pointed at him.
I walked over to my chair and plopped in it. A flashback came to me of the first time I sat in that chair, when Sherlock dragged me to a crime scene.
"Thank you" I stated, trying to decide what to ask. Great, I went through all of that and I don't even know what to ask.
"We would have starved with honour. Not as kidnappers. Go. get. the victims." He spoke with the confidence of a thousand men, Not breaking eye contact for a second.
I couldn't help but agree with Sherlock-er, his voice. There was more. Raz said that she has never done anything like this before, or so he knew of. She didn't just kidnap two random people. There had to be a reason, but what?
"Probably my answer has crossed yours." Sherlock raised his gun and pointed it at Moriarty. If I hadn't been living with him for the past while, I would have never known that he was scared. And that meant something, Sherlock Holmes doesn't get scared. He slowly lowered his gun to point at the bomb-jacket, not breaking eye contact with Moriarty. His eyes were watery. Jim Moriarty tilted his head to the side, giving him a "What are you going to do" look. I probably looked terrified. I felt it, anyways. A smile played across Moriarty's lips. How could he possibly be smiling, he was about to die.
There it was. The symbol that Lestrade has described. It was spray painted on the wall. The woman on the tele continued talking but I didn't hear any of it. I was lost in thought. Another person. Another person was kidnapped by this...whoever it was. That was the last straw for me. This couldn't continue. I grabbed my phone from my jean pocket, and dialed a number.
I opened my eyes. This nightmare was different. I wasn't frightened, just depressed. I ran my hand through my hair, then rubbed my eyes. I realized that I had been crying in my sleep. That's a new one. I sighed and turned my head to look at the time. 6 o'clock. I groaned and thought to myself, how could it only be 6 o'clock? Savoring one last minute in bed, I decided to get up, knowing that I probably wouldn't fall back asleep anyways.
Stepping away from me, he said "Don't mention it. I should probably show you to Mrs. Morstan now, yea?"
"Happy?" I snapped at her. I didn't mean for it to come out rude. I remember the last time someone other than Sherlock was rude to her. He probably would have attacked me.
I was about to tell her she didn't have to make conversation with me, but luckily, my phone saved me. I reached for the phone to answer, but Mrs. Hudson pushed it out of my reach.
That's better. You'll be here all day if you keep this up! Now, ask her if she has her friends over every Friday.
"Yes he does, hello!" She bit sarcastically. "And if I ever hear you call me Tereassa it will be the last thing you say. It's Tess."
"It's how I make a living." Raz and I both had a look of utter shock on our faces. "People come to me, pay me to kidnap someone who pissed them off, give them a good fright."
"No. But I won't let and innocent suffer. Now, sit back down, and tell me about the case." This came out in a commanding tone, reminding me of my days in the army. I haven't had to use that tone since, well, the army. We both walked back over to the table and took a seat. The next thing Lestrade has to say would have even made Sherlock gasp.
I decided against eavesdropping and turned the cold water on. I tried to wash away my feelings, if that was even possible.
"Ask her if she sold the spray paint to someone or if she put the mark there herself. That will force her to give you a straight answer" Sherlock instructed. I turned my attention over to him for a moment. I didn't reply, just nodded.
He was the last person I wanted to see. If he was expecting a happy reunion this morning, he would leave here disappointed.
I let out a grunt of frustration. He was right. Of course he was right! The amazing Sherlock Holmes is always right! Gulping, I thought, I could never go back there, not after what happened.
The next thing that happened not even Sherlock Holmes could predict. "Staying Alive" by the Bee Gees started to play. Sherlock's eyes looked around to swimming pool, but his head remained still. He gave a quick glance at me but quickly returned his eyes to Moriarty. Moriarty closed his eyes and sighed, giving a look that would say this has happened before.
"Yes, it's a little tradition of ours. Janine, my best friend, and two other girls, I was asked not to reveal their names, sorry, and myself, watch our favourite movies every every Friday." She spoke with a tone of authority, like you would want to obey her every order. This must have meant she had an authoritative job in her past. I would think she still had this job, but her haircut says she had to maintain a sort of personal grooming, but has recently stopped doing that, because she let her hair grow messy. That means she recently lost her job.
"My employer asked me to put it there" she stated. I was afraid I knew what was coming next, but I had to ask.
Sherlock's voice was clear as day in my head. And as much as I hate to admit it, he was right. Or...his voice was right. I'm here on a case. Nothing more. Mary took a few steps closer to me and before I could react, she was right next to me, whispering in my ear. "John. I know this is your first case alone." I was about to ask her how she knew that, but she cut me off. "Don't ask, Lestrade told me. Anyways, I understand you're a little nervous, but there's no reason to be." She backed away from my ear, and locked her eyes with mine. "I believe in you. You can solve this case."
"John Watson I am ashamed of you. Sherlock would not want you to treat one of his good friends in this way."
"John. John are you listening? Can you hear me?" Mrs. Hudson leaned forward and touched my arm. I looked up, but didn't fully reach her eyes. "Yes, I can hear you" I said slowly. "I'm not hungry, you can have the rest of these" I said, motioning towards the pancakes. I teared my eyes away from her concerned eyes. "I'm going to go grab a shower" I said softly. As I was leaving the room, I could have sworn I heard a feint whisper of "Oh John."
"What does he want?" I replied angerly, scratching the back of my head. There was a bump there from when I hit my head. I winced at the touch of it.
"Ah, John! You're feeling much better today, aren't you?" She was grinning from ear to ear. What had gotten her so happy?
When I reached the kitchen, I quickly discovered I had a newfound motivation. I wasn't sure where it was from, but none the less, I'm glad it's there. Smiling to myself, I decided to make pancakes. I wasn't sure why pancakes, but today just felt like a pancake day. It didn't take long to notice that I was out of milk.
"Mind sharing these thoughts with me?" She replied, her sweet smile returning. This woman really was a mystery to me. She had so many different sides I couldn't keep track of them all.
"Uhm...thank you. I should probably get on with those questions, yes?" There, I just had to keep my focus on the case, and all will go well.
My eyes flickered from the red dot on Sherlock to Jim Moriarty, standiing only 10 feet away from me. We were so close, so close to escaping. I should have known better, it's never that simple with him.
"Does this mean you've forgiven me?" I thought about the question for a moment. Had I forgiven him? I thought back to the events that led up to Sherlock's death. The one person Sherlock thought would never doubt him, doubted him. Everyone thought it was a fake. He destroyed him.
As much as I hate to say it, coming here was completely worth it. "Find the can, find the kidnapper." I whisper, more to myself than Raz.
I sat down in my chair. Sighing, I thought to myself, "Is everything going to remind me of him?" I had considered moving out many times over the past week, but I couldn't bear leave 221B Baker Street. Good memories or not.
"GET OUT!" I shouted at him. All the anger I had concealed behind my sadness came out all at once. Everything I had been holding back at the funeral when I saw him, everything I couldn't say there, came out in those two words.
"Well, who was it" I asked Mrs. Hudson when I got out of the shower. Although I would never admit it out loud, I felt much better after getting a shower. Perhaps if I started taking proper care of myself, the grief would slowly wash away.
I heard his voice in my head, telling me mourning won't do me any good, just as it had every morning. But something about this morning was different. It was like there was an invisible force pulling me out of bed. I untangled myself from the sheets and stood up. It was like every movement drained the energy out of me. I took a deep breath, grabbed the doorknob, and opened the door.
"You...You do?" He looked more relived then I'd ever seen him in his life. I stretched my arms out, wrapping him into a hug. "Of course I do." I whispered. "I...I'm sorry for shouting at you yesterday."
"I'm a doctor let me come through." I said as I push my way through the crowd. "Please, he's my friend, he's my friend." I pushed through the people holding me back and leaned down to take his pulse. There was a look of disbelief on my face. He couldn't be dead, he just couldn't. They pulled me away from him when I felt no pulse, and I fell to the ground as they put his body on a stretcher. "Oh Jesus no. Oh god no." I couldn't tear my eyes away from his body. The paramedics pulled him into the hospital on the stretcher, whilst I was left standing in the street, in utter bewilderment.
I was furious. I have never hated someone more in my life. I would have shouted at him, but experience taught me that keeping the same tone and a straight face had the same effect, if not better. I took a deep breath and a few steps away so I wouldn't do anything I would regret.
"Are you even listing to me?" Lestrade snapped. The look on his face told me that he regretted snapping at me immediately. He knew that if he even came off a bit to strong, I would kick him out in an instant.
Sherlock threw his phone on the ground, without breaking his eyes away from me. He lifted his arm and reached for me. I returned the gesture. I had to stop him. He can't jump off this roof, I...I need him. If only I had the guts to say that aloud. Maybe he wouldn't jump if I did say it. By the time I had decided what to do, it was already too late. He spread his arms out, and let gravity do the rest.
"John, you're back! I was worried. How did it go with that uhm, Raz guy?" Mary was the first to see me arrive back at her friends house. Surprisingly, they were all still there. But what she didn't see, was who came out of the car after me.
"You asked him out to dinner?!" Layla asked, hitting Mary in the arm. She threw her a "Get-lost" look. Laughing, Layla threw us one more mischievous grin before walking away. I could tell they were close, probably known each other for their whole lives. Mary just smiled. They reminded me of Sherlock and I. No matter how much of an annoying jerk he was, I could never stop lov-...er, I could never hate him. That's just who he was...my best friend.
When I got to , it was worse than I could ever imagine. I had taken time off of work because I hadn't been able to even go near a hospital, let alone work at one everyday! I stood just on the edge of the road, eyes fixed on the hospital. Before I even realized what I was doing, I looked up at the rooftop. It was a living nightmare. I could almost see him, standing up there, prepared to jump. A single tear rolled down my cheek. Why? Why did you have to jump?
"Screw it" I cursed to myself. I ran towards Mary, calling out her name. When I caught up to her, she looked surprised to see me.
Tess was shocked with her brother. "I was just trying to make us money Raz! We would have starved!" Raz was having none of it. For the first, and last time, I was actually on his side.
"Are you alright John?" He has a genuine look of concern on his face. Like him or not, he was one of Sherlock's only friends before me, and I knew he cared for Sherlock's, and my well being.
I turned around to face Lestrade, and called out "I'm going to see Raz." As I turned to leave, I could have sworn I heard the words "Who the bloody hell is Raz?"
"Say that again and know that if your lying to me, I will find you, and I will skiiiiiiinnn you." He used his hand for effect, most likely trying to frighten Sherlock and I. "Away" was his final word before hanging up. He furrowed his eyebrows. "Sorry, wrong day to die."
"I know. I know your not Sherlock. But you knew him better then any of us. You knew how he worked better then anyone. And if all else fails, we could really use your doctor skills." He was staring down at his hands, refusing to look up and make eye contact. If he did look up, he would see all the hatred in my eyes, looking right at him.
When we got to the crime scene, I had about a hundred flashbacks of solving crimes with Sherlock, but I may have been underestimating it. There wasn't many officers there. At least not many I could recognize. Doing a quick scan of the exterior of the house, I walked towards the police tape, hands in my pockets. It wasn't until I reached the police tape, that I had to take my hands out of my pockets to lift it up. Such an old habit of mine, keeping my hands in my pockets at police lines. I always knew Sherlock would be there to lift up the police tape for me, it was his equivalent of holding a door open for me. I looked to the side to see that Lestrade had fallen into pace with me. "Is here?"
Oh I really missed this! As much as I hated this Raz guy, I couldn't help but admit I had missed solving cases. Somehow. through the rush of it all, I managed to forget about Sherlock for the time being.
She gave me a disappointed look. "I was worried!" She exclaimed. "I didn't know if you were coming back or not."
"So this man, you're about to introduce me to, what's his deal?" I asked. "Does he just kidnap people as a pastime?" A small smile spread across my face, but quickly faded when I noticed the lack of a smirk or chuckle from Sherlock at my sarcastic remark.
A voice sounded from the doorway. I turned around to see who the new voice had came from. Lestrade. He was standing in my doorway.
He turned to me, forcing eye contact. "We have a code, and my sister is not going to be the one to break it. I'm sorry for all the trouble she caused you." And those were the last words spoken until we got back to Mary.
"His name..." she started to say slowly, "is Moriarty." I stood there, frozen with shock. He's dead. How could it be him. He can't be back. He just can't. I saw his body, he blew his own brains out. So how could he be back? If you looked at me now you would have never guessed I was in the army. I was panicking...I was scared. I can't face Moriarty, not without Sherlock. He was always the clever one. Who was I to think I could take his place, solve this case. It was a bigger game, it always was. It was a bigger game I wasn't ready to play.
It was the morning after Lestrade came to our-my flat. I had told him that I need some time to think. On one hand, if I didn't help, people could die. But on the other hand, I'm not Sherlock Holmes. I doubt I would be any help to them. Well at least that's what I was telling myself. The truth is, I don't want to solve crimes without Sherlock. If I went back to solving crimes, like the good old days, I would most likely have an emotional breakdown on the crime scene. I was getting no further in making a decision, so I did what one does when they have nothing let to do. Make a pros and cons list.
"Are you up there Sherlock...?" No answer. He barley ever answered me when he was alive, I don't know why I expected things to change now that he was dead. A tear rolled down my cheek. It felt as if a ball of darkness had swallowed up my heart. "I miss you." No response. I choked on a sob. "Dammit Sherlock! You didn't have jump. Why did you jump..." I could barely get out words that sounded relatively like English. Now that no one was around, I didn't have to stop the tears that were flowing down my face. "You didn't have to jump" I sobbed. I was about to tear my eyes away from the sky, when I shooting star flew by. Strange, they weren't normally around this time of the year. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and made my wish.
Raz lead me through so many back alleyways, I wouldn't be able to find my way back even if I wanted to.
"Any day now" I growled at him. I just wanted to do my part with this case, and be done with it. "What this little deal you're so afraid to tell me about?"
"Why" I asked. She looked confused, but I continued anyways. "Why "M"? You could have put any letter, why M?"
"The "M". Where is it?" I had to see the spray paint. I had to know if it was the same as the paint the looters used.
I sighed and dragged myself into the bathroom. As annoying as it was, I needed someone like Mrs. Hudson now more than ever. While I stepped into the shower, I heard her voice from the sitting room. I had a short flashback of my therapy sessions.
"Well get on with it then" she demanded. I looked around the area and tried to see if anyone was in hearing range. Tess gave me an annoyed look, clearly growing impatient. I suddenly felt bad for how I treated Lestrade earlier. I took out Lestrade's phone and showed her the picture of the spray paint.
"What...oh yea I'm listening. Um, tell me more about the case." I tried to play it off as if nothing had happened.
"So, Mary, uhm..." I didn't know what to ask. I spent all this time dancing around the problem and now I don't even know what to ask.
The pros were simple, I could potentially save a life. I could keep myself distracted from my grief, and I would have something to live for again. But then there was the cons, Sherlock Holmes. I only solve crimes with Sherlock. If I did something like this, continuing the business, well it just reminds me too much of him.
"Oh! Uhm, no, not at all. I was just, uhm, lost in thought, sorry." I replied almost too enthusiastically. My nerves were jumping around inside me. Why I am so nervous?
"Yea, 'pose you could do it like that. Or I could just introduce you." A look of utter amazement spread across my face. Him? Help me?!
"Listen, John, I should probably just leave." I had never seen Lestrade so utterly hopeless before. As much as I hated the man, I couldn't let an innocent suffer. When I didn't respond, he stood up to leave.
I shuddered at the thought of saying something Moriarty had used against Sherlock as a threat. Removing the hand clasped over my mouth, I took a deep breath, and counted to ten, momentarily forgetting Lestrade was across the table from me. I was so lost in thought that I was completely oblivious to Lestrade calling my name.
"Cause you're a friend of Sherlock's. Any friends of Sherlock's, which isn't many, get my help. We both know if he trusts you, you're trustworthy." We locked eyes. I might have been wrong about him being stuck up. I suppose even street rats like him have a code.
She had made me my favourite breakfast, beans, sausage, a fried egg, toast, and tomatoes. Never had I been so tempted to eat something over the past week, but the temptation still wasn't strong enough.
"That uhm, what you did, that was very responsible of you" I stated, trying to show my appreciation.
"I would love to have dinner some other time" Mary responded. She pulled out a piece of paper and wrote her phone number on it. I tentatively took the paper from her, and stuck it in my back pocket. We stood there for a moment or two longer, just looking at each other, smiling at each other. Last time I felt this content was with...Sherlock. I pushed that thought away from my head. I would not have Sherlock ruin another one of my relationships. God knows he's already done that enough times. Lost in thought, I almost didn't hear what Mary said next. "I better get going. Layla's demanding that we spend the entire night together, finishing the movie we were watching when she got kidnapped."
I remained still in bed, trying to decide what to do. It was the same thoughts as every morning. Stay in bed, or get up and eat. Staying in bed always won, because getting up meant facing people and facing people meant hearing their poor attempts on making me feel better.
I took a quick glance at the photo. No, it wasn't the same paint, but it was worth looking in to. "Right, thanks Greg!" I exclaimed. I began jogging away from the crime scene when Lestrade shouted "Wait! You still have my phone!"
"Oh yea, sure go ahead." We sat and ate in comfortable silence, and I couldn't help but wonder where Sherlock was. He's normally back from, well whatever he does in the morning by now. I was about to go and grab another pancake, but I was interrupted by a text. I picked up my phone and checked to see who it was. Lestrade. The text read, "Meet me at the police station at 8." And right then I remembered why I was in such a great mood. We have a case. Finally after a whole week without a case, we have a case.
"He must have been hiding behind this bush, and knocked the pot over! That must have been the sound you heard!" I was waving my arms all over the place, trying to make a point. I had failed to notice that Lestrade had followed us out to the backyard. He looked impressed with what I had managed to deduce.
The list of people present in the house the previous night had been drawn up as requested. It began with Lyndale himself, his daughters, son and son-in-law, and two guests of the family, a Mr William Huntington and a Mrs Catherine Tyndrum. Also invited had been two Franciscans and Monsignor Pinet, four members of the Winston family, and a couple, Mr and Mrs Armstrong. The household's complement of servants consisted of a butler, a footman, a cook, a parlourmaid, two maids-of-all-work, and additionally the cook's niece, who apparently came in to lend a hand on such occasions. The Lyndale townhouse was on the large side: they were clearly extremely wealthy.
Holmes seemed unperturbed by our lack of success with Mrs Spencer. He hailed a cab and directed the cabbie to Limehouse.
Now, he met Garner's coolness with coolness. "And when precisely did you and your fellow friars first learn of the monsignor's interest in cameos?"
He took a deep breath. "He does not make for such a pleasant topic either. Indeed, I find it unbearable to know that we are sitting here helplessly, and all the while that villain is making his preparations for tonight."
"Precisely," I said aloud. "No one knows what the future holds. Why, one of us could be run over by a runaway horse tomorrow, God forbid. Afghanistan taught me to live in the present, and I want to spend every possible second of that present with you."
"I will look for your sister," Holmes said, "but if she does not wish to see you, I won't pass on any information on her whereabouts."
"It was on the recommendation of Mr Lyndale, through his man of business." He gave us both a puzzled look. "Father Garner told me to answer all of your questions, but I'd assumed you'd be asking me about that evening at the Lyndales when their cameos were stolen."
"There were several other men," she said slowly. "My father's man of business employed them, but I know they were up to no goodâ€”I didn't know what exactly. They never came to the house, but I saw them at the soup kitchen, and I saw them with Joshua Wilcott. They didn't only speak of arson, but also of burglary. House-breaking. One was called Ozbitt, I believe. Another was called Parker."
We sat in comfortable silence for a long time, wrapped in each other's arms. Notwithstanding the lack of resolution, I felt the better for our talk, although my contentment was tinged with trepidation when my thoughts turned to the deadly risk I intended to take later that night.
I hid a smile. Holmes himself could be quite conceited at times, and it was only the fact that his conceit was well-founded that separated him from the pompous fools of the world.
Sherlock Holmes' hand rested on my knee, but I did not feel in the least bit slighted that his head was turned away from me and he was paying me no attention at all, for after all, it was my own city of Edinburgh which he was drinking in through the hansom cab window.
On the way out of the friary, along a cool stone corridor, Holmes caught my arm, pulling me to a halt and drawing my attention to a large, dark painting hanging on the wall.
"In fact, the blackest piece of evidence we have against Lyndale is that I'm quite convinced this cameo theft is a complete fabrication," Holmes said. "But wasting a consulting detective's time is not a crime, sadly."
Lyndale raised a hand in a gesture of greeting, and I realised that the organist mustâ€”perhaps through some complex set of mirrorsâ€”be able to see us from his lofty perch.
Huntington entered first, followed by Lyndale, who looked as awkward and embarrassed as his father had the previous evening.
Father Briggs stood in the central aisle in a cassock and Mass vestments, speaking to two ragged old men. He looked up and caught sight of us in the doorway. He frowned, but once he'd finished his conversation, he came to join us in the corridor outside the chapel.
I sat down at my desk to sort through some papers relating to the case Holmes had solved just two days before, concerning the peculiar goings-on in a series of riverfront warehouses. The task of tying up the loose ends usually fell to me, especially when one case rapidly succeeded another. When Holmes was in the middle of a new case it had his undivided attention.
"I know," he said shortly. "It's merely a flesh wound. The doctor will certainly authorise you to leave your bed already this afternoon."
Fortunately for the state of all our nerves, Brodie soon made an appearance. He recognised me the moment I stepped out of the shadows into the beam of his lantern, but he did not seem in the slightest bit ruffled. Instead he aimed coldly with the pistol which was already in his hand, and it was all I could do to dive out of the way in time, the bullet missing me by a hair's breadth. Holmes and the police then leapt on him from behind, and all was confusion and noise for a minute, a chaos of grotesque shadows cast by the lantern which was tossed from side to side in the fight.
Holmes murmured good night without raising his head, and I quietly left the room. Under other circumstances, I might have wondered whether the possibility of sharing a bed that night was something that had crossed Holmes' mind as it crossed mine, and what that meant if it did or if it didn't. I was spared from such doubts, however, by the knowledge that Holmes would certainly stay up late into the night, deep in thought about the case.
Sherlock Holmes stood in the doorway, the most peculiar expression on his face as he looked down at me. He came forward to stand at the foot of the bed, still in silence, while the maid excused herself and slipped out.
Indeed, the idea of anyone actually managing to break into our building was absurd. Holmes, expert lockpick that he himself was, had seen to that.
I noticed the fire had burned down, and reached for the tongs to put another log on the fire, but was interrupted by a yawn again.
I hastened to reassure him. "It is true that Gordon did always insist on planning carefully for every eventuality, however remote and unlikely. I don't know that I would medically class him as a neurotic, however. In any case, he is an old friend from my Edinburgh school days, now a barrister, and quite rich, as you say - I suppose you got that from the stationery? I was his best man, as a matter of fact, when he married the Mildred he refers to. They were childhood sweethearts."
My father had seemed pleased, after his own fashion, to see me take an interest in zoology and botany. I was sorry he had not lived to see me become a doctor. I did not do it for him, of course, but he would have taken a great deal of vicarious pride in it nonetheless.
"Most of the buildings along this wharf belong to the Lyndale family, I believe?" Holmes commented. This was news to me.
I waited, knowing better than to address Holmes while he was deep in thought. Sometimes he would fall into a brown study and not emerge for hours. This time, however, he stirred after only a few minutes, and shook his head impatiently.
"The friar who runs the place allows a philosophical society the use of an upstairs room in the building. They give talks on various secular subjects, I believe. I accompanied Georgiana there once... something about steam engines. I only went once, but I believe she went often while I was up at Oxford. She mentioned a man she had met there, by the name of Smith, or something similar. He gave a talk about railway engineering, if I remember correctly."
We had not had a great deal of opportunity to speak alone since the night of Brodie's final burglary, what with the business of the trial, and all the social events the Gordons had wanted to hold or drag us to, in the euphoria of having the origin of the corpse in their hallway explained. I had enjoyed seeing old friends and acquaintances, of course, but I felt all the while the tension of a long-overdue conversation with Holmes ahead.
Without design, we found ourselves standing in almost exactly the same configuration as we had been yesterday evening, just before I kissed Holmes for the first time.
This did not enlighten me any further. After all, the man in the Gordons' hallway had not been stabbed with a wood-chisel or any such instrument, but shot through the heart.
"My head hurts," I complained as we climbed the steps to our front door, Lyndale's carriage pulling away behind us. "There are too many witnesses in this case."
His tone made me long even more than ever to take him in my arms, but I remained where I was, gazing at him helplessly.
Holmes looked at his watch. "Now, I hope you don't mind, Watson, but we shall have to vacate our rooms for a few hours this morning. I have offered Mrs Georgiana Smith the use of our sitting room. A neutral ground, if you will, where she can receive her brother.
"I don't disagree, Georgiana," Lyndale said awkwardly, holding up both hands as though to ward her off. "And I will never tell you toâ€”to repent or anything like that. Butâ€”" He paused. "No, nothing. I've nothing to say."
"My business with Miss Lyndale is not about the cameos," Holmes said. "I believe that if she knew why I wanted to see her, she would wish to speak to me."
Before I could dwell too much on the matter, however, he appeared in the doorway, already shaved and half-dressed, and carrying a water jug.
"I've never worried much about my immortal soul," he said slowly, "but I find myself strangely reluctant to risk yours."
"This is from Monsignor Pinet, in answer to a note I sent him to request he clarify one small detail."
"The originals were carved in sardonyx shell," Pinet explained. "These are in the much more inexpensive carnelian shell, treated to make the colour resemble that of the sardonyx."
"But if he doesn't have what he wanted, why stop the charade? Orâ€”" I cast my mind back over this afternoon. "Did he feel you were getting too close to the truth?"
I did not voice the thought aloud, however, because I wanted to do nothing but sleep, and I didn't know how to convey that without risk of misinterpretation.
I had been brought up in a very plain way myself. "My father would have called them the trappings of Popery."
"So I've heard," Briggs agreed readily. "Indirectly, in many cases, perhaps." He moved some crates off two wooden chairs and gestured to us to sit down. He himself leant up against the desk. "Now how can I help you, gentlemen?"
I spent a pleasant day talking of old times, and returned to the Gordons' in time for dinner, arriving not long before Holmes. Our hosts seemed much happier now that Holmes was attending to their case, although if he had made any progress during the afternoon he had not shared it with the rest of us.
Upon my return, Holmes greeted me with a note in his hand. "You're just in time, Watson. I'm expecting Mr Nicholas Lyndale at any moment."
I expected Holmes to refuse. He rarely took on cases of this nature. Missing persons affairs were usually mere gruntwork. Moreover, I had formed the impression that he felt Georgiana had good riddance of her family. But to my surprise he said, "Perhaps. What can you tell me about this man she is marrying? Have you ever met him?"
Holmes passed it to me across the breakfast table. I stared at the heavy cream-coloured envelope in surprise. I cannot deny that it also gave me a certain ridiculous feeling of pleasure to see our names written thus side-by-side: Dr. J. H. Watson and Mr. S. Holmes.
Marching Lyndale between us, we returned to where we had left his accomplice at the far end of the mews. Boyle was sitting on the man, while Lestrade handcuffed his hands.
For a moment, his face softened, and he made a move as if to come to me, although he stopped himself. "I flatter myself that that is true," he said softly.
Holmes walked to the window and stood looking out, his back to me. "Thus, as I stated, I have come to apologise. Firstly, to apologise for my reckless behaviour, even though I know you already understand and forgive it. Secondly, to apologise in advance for something I fear you will neither understand nor forgive."
I could not help but be hurt. Instead of pointing out my status as a qualified and experienced doctor, I said in a cold voice: "Nobody was forcing you to read it."
Since we embarked on this affair a month earlier I had been holding back, unsure what Holmes wanted, and unwilling to speak unless he did. But now I saw he had been doing the same thing. One of us had to take a leap of faith. "Perhaps I've already found what I was looking for."
"Miss Lyndale is a twenty-four-year-old woman who can make her own decisions," Briggs said instead of answering.
I wondered whether Holmes would say he wished to interview each member of the family in private, as he sometimes did, but after a few minutes' conversation with young Lyndale and Huntington, he turned to the cabinet and bent to examine the lock.
I put a hand to my head, frowning. It was still at least two weeks until I was next due a haircut, and his suggestion left me perplexed.
He stared at me in amazement. "You make this incredibly courageous offer, without knowing any of the details, any of the reasons that make it worthwhile - "
Over lunch we both poured over the day's newspapers, which we had not had time to finish that morning. The lunch things had scarcely been cleared away when a boy called with a note from Father Briggs. Holmes unfolded and read it, then held it out so I could see the text.
"What should I have said? She is twenty-three years old. In fact 'elope' was a poor choice of word on my part. She simply intends to marry without her family's approval, which is surely no one's business but her own. At least, it's certainly not mine." He took the spoon from where I'd dropped it by the butter dish, and began to spread marmalade on another slice of toast. "However, I would find it convenient were she to wait to disrupt the whole household until
Lyndale, Armstrong and Winston were under investigation for insurance fraud. They were not currently in gaol, because people of their class generally did not suffer imprisonment, at least not while under suspicion for that type of crime. But I had faith that justice would eventually be done. Besides that, we had not received any news of the case in recent days.
"You must believe me, Watson, when I say that I do not mean to repulse you heartlessly, nor provoke unfounded judgements in you regarding my nature, which you have in the past described as unfeeling. But I do nonetheless urge you to imagine the look on the face of your upright friend, were he to witness the scene you attempted to enact."
"But you did foresee her elopement. Not that it's really accurate to call it an elopement. Her marriage, I should say."
Having placed the pile of linens at the foot of the stairs, she took a sheet of paper from the hall table, and wrote something in a slow, careful hand. She folded up the note, and gave it to me. "Thank you sir," she said and hurried away, as if she were afraid she would change her mind.
When I descended to the sitting room a few hours later, Holmes was curled up in his armchair, a book lying abandoned in his lap. He had obviously intended to read, but been overcome by sleep.
Holmes took my arm and drew me with him. We trailed the man out of the graveyard, then down into the dark, dangerous hell which was the neighbourhood in the shadow of the Castle. We followed him down a narrow flight of steps, along a grimy, unlit, stinking close, and into a passageway which led under the floors of the buildings above. All around us we could hear the teeming sounds of life: voices raised in anger, babies wailing, dishes and glasses clattering, but the back streets were deserted, and we saw no-one but the shadowy figure of the man ahead.
He glanced up briefly. "Really, Watson, I hope you are merely humouring me. Aside from the obvious fact that your name is listed first, although Mr Holmes and Dr Watson sounds so much better..." I let that pass without comment. "... there is the Edinburgh postmark, and the fact that you received a Christmas card addressed in the same handwriting."
"Mr Lyndale's son?" We had not seen him since Holmes interviewed him at his father's house, the day after the business with the cameos.
"I don't know the Lyndales at all, besides seeing them in the congregation at Mass at the friary. With the exception of the younger daughter Miss Georgiana, that is. She takes an interest in our work here and has occasionally spoken with me about it."
"Tomorrow, however," he added brightly, "we shall have the opportunity to speak to what I hope will be most informative witnesses yet, in Limehouse."
I wondered if Lyndale knew who Mr Smith was and where his daughter had met the man. No doubt Lyndale could easily bring pressure to bear on Briggs if he wished. I did not know how the Catholic Church hierarchy worked, but I imagined Briggs could get into hot water with his bishop or with the Franciscan prior if Lyndale lodged a complaint against him. I doubted he'd been authorised to allow people like Smith to give secular talks on the premises here, for instance.
On the one hand, we had the breath-taking expanse which was the south side of Edinburgh's main thoroughfare, where the ground all along that side of the road fell away sharply to lush green pleasure gardens and then rose steeply to the lofty spires and towers of the university's New College, the Bank of Scotland and the imposing mass of the Castle, all posed high on the sheer volcanic cliffs which rose from the valley separating us from them.
"The younger sister's not married yet either, but the older one is." He moved around to the other side of Holmes' head. "She married a convert, and I expect you know what they say about converts, Mr Holmes."
"Well, the son's not married yet, but he's the only son, so he won't be too long about it, I expect." Mr Willis chuckled to himself. "He's not much of a lady's man, poor chap. Always seems to be blushing and stammering, whenever I've seen him. But the whole family is very well-heeled indeed, so I don't suppose he'll have too much trouble getting hitched."
Three times already. My goodness. After four years teetering on the brink, it had finally come to this.
"You don't wish to recover the cameos? I expect I could track down the jeweller or dealer Miss Georgiana will have sold them to."
He smiled fondly. "I see things are beginning to become clear to you, my dear. I presume you now understand why I said that the profession of the man from Windmyre Close was the key to the matter?"
"You think they're conspiring together?" Were they on Holmes' list of suspects? A man of the cloth, and the very gentleman who had hired us?
As I climbed the stairs to my own bedroom, my heart lay heavy in my chest. My little room seemed cold and quiet when I reached it, and as I set my candle down on the chest beside my bed, I could not suppress a sigh.
"For Mr Nicolas Lyndale, however, it will be otherwise, I fear," Holmes added thoughtfully. "He will not escape marriage."
At this point someone lit the gas-lamps in the room, plunging us into light, and Holmes let go of my arm.
I would have reassured him immediately, had I known just how to put it. Gushings of undying devotion seemed a little inopportune, not to mention potentially embarrassing for both of us. Nor did I wish to appear completely dissolute or licentious by announcing that I'd be quite willing to repeat the encounter, no strings attached.
His head was tilted back, his thin lips open. I could hear his breathing, soft and urgent in the quiet room. My own heart raced at the same galloping rhythm.
"How horrible! But I don't quite understand. She knows who killed her young man, and kept her silence - and even went on helping his murderer?"
I stood at the foot of the stairs, savouring the sight of him. His long gaunt face was relaxed in sleep as it never was in waking, his ever-active hands still, his body at peace. I was simply glad that we were both here together in Baker Street.
We were interruptedâ€”fortunately or unfortunatelyâ€”by a knock at the door: the return of Mrs Hudson's new girl, who'd forgotten to ask whether we'd be in for lunch and dinner. By the time I'd dealt with her, Holmes wasâ€”or appeared to beâ€”deep in a newspaper he'd already read.
While I was regaining my breath after this statement, Holmes went on in a more business-like tone, although I could see that he was smiling fondly at the flush in my cheeks.
"That will be for the Financial Fraud Division to say. But I believe it's safe to say that it's insurance fraud on a large scale."
The address in Briggs' note led us to a respectable middle-class house in a row of other similarly respectable middle-class houses in Camden Town, just off the High Street.
The Gordons had also invited some acquaintances around, and we had a pleasant after-dinner conversation. After some time I looked about me and noticed that Holmes was nowhere to be seen. Most likely he had simply tired of making polite conversation with the bourgeoisie of the Lowlands and slipped discreetly away.
"There's a soup kitchen in Limehouse, run by a Franciscan friar. Georgiana used to spend some time there, and I believe that's where she met the fellow."
Huntington flushed. I have rarely been in the position of being directly challenged about my relationship with another man, but I'm sure my reaction had never been so revealing.
"Never fear, Mrs Hudson," Holmes reassured her. "That's all under control. They won't be returning to Baker Street again."
Holmes said mildly, "I thought you would appreciate an update on my search for your valuable cameos."
He still had his back to me as he went on: "I love you, Watson, so much so that it renders me egoistical. I can no longer justify risking your liberty and good name thus, simply to gratify my own irrepressible desires. Such a scene as I enacted last night can never have the opportunity to occur again."
"Indeed," Lyndale said. "A man several decades older than her. A railway engineer of some kind, I believe."
Later, we lay in rumpled sheets, warm and sated. After some time, Holmes sat up to light a cigarette. It seemed this was a habit of his, afterwardsâ€”or so I had observed on the previous occasions we had indulged.
Lyndale called for us at nine precisely. If his daughter were indeed in the middle of running away to be married, he did not seem to be aware of it.
"I know we will never be free from fear, Holmes," I added. "But I am quite determined not to give you up, so it is a damned good thing you don't intend to try."
I knew that was not true, for human nature in all its manifestations fascinated him, whether or not crime was involved. But he often affected disdain for family ties, which sometimes made me wonder whether the life of his own family had been chequered by drama in his youth.
Her brother blinked, taken aback. "I'm not. I mean, I won't. I meanâ€”But you must see this from Father and Sarah's point of view."
I leant forward to take a closer look. "I suppose you are reading about Burke and Hare, the grave-robbers, and their ilk?"
"Certainly not. She is guilty of no crime worse than wanting to marry a divorced man, and outside her church."
He led us through the room to a small office-like space that seemed to double as a storage room, filled with wooden crates and canvas sacks, the few pieces of furniture groaning under stacks of religious pamphlets and sacks of potatoes.
Neither of us alluded to the events of the previous evening. The only words we exchanged were about the cameos, and I was just as reluctant as he seemed to be to change that state of affairs. It was cowardly of us, perhaps, but I was rather grateful that a case should have intervened at just this time.
He closed his own book, and placed one hand over mine. "I want to be as close to you as humanly possible," he said simply, "and how can I be any closer than if we are reading the same page, our minds thinking the same thoughts?"
"Excellent," he said, replacing the bunch. "I think that will be all for the moment, Mr. Gordon. Now I must have time to reflect."
He resumed his pacing. "You know perfectly well what the problem is, Watson. On this occasion we were fortunate. The only witnesses to my shocking indiscretion were more interested in the sourcing of their next meal than in the antics of two complete strangers. Next time we shall be under the eyes of your friends the Gordons, or a Scotland Yard inspector."
Holmes murmured something noncommittal. "Your son mentioned he was just down from Oxford," he added. "I suppose you'll be involving him more and more in your affairs."
In the afternoon we called on the Winstons and Armstrongs, two almost indistinguishable wealthy, middle-aged couples. The Winstons had land in Somerset, as I'd learnt by consulting Who's Who before we set out, and the Armstrongs had land in Cumbria. The Winstons were related to the late Mrs Lyndale. The Armstrongs had come over with William the Conqueror, more or less, but their wealth came via Mrs Armstrong, whose father had been in the tobacco trade.
Briggs gave him a hard look. "You don't know what you're talking about. Why don't you stick to what you know, Mr Holmes?"
I noticed he did not mention what the rest of the family thought. I wondered what they made of Huntington. Nothing in particular, perhaps. There was nothing unusual in a young man having one close male friend, especially in the school and university years.
"Were they indeed?" Holmes murmured, still studying the cameos closely. After a moment he looked up. "Well, gentlemen, I must say your case intrigues me. I will call on you at home at three o'clock this afternoon. I suppose the police have already been through your salon with a fine toothcomb?"
"I quite agree that what you describe is hogwash," I said mildly. "But mustn't each man find his own way of surviving in this world?"
"No, the burglary at the Gordons' was a little different - and it was that fact which led to the death of the unfortunate young man in their hallway. The difference at the Gordons, you see, was that they have in their employ Margaret Donnelly, who was already being used by Brodie, the cabinet-maker, as an intermediate between himself and the locksmith who cast the keys - we saw her take the wax impression of a key at the end of that meeting in the kirkyard, in fact. Now for some unknown reason - perhaps business was a little slack - Brodie decided that Margaret Donnelly's employers would also prove a profitable target, and ordered her to procure for him a copy of their house-key."
"Thank you, Mr Holmes, for all the efforts you had undertaken so far. I'm only sorry it was all in vain, and that things should have turned out like this."
That afternoon, when I returned to Baker Street with two second-class sleeper tickets in my pocket, I found Holmes pouring over an Ordnance Survey map of Edinburgh. A cheap guidebook to the city lay open on the desk beside him. I was surprised, for I had never seen my friend prepare with such thoroughness for a case whose interest he had not yet even determined, and I said as much.
He started, but did not deny it. "And perfectly dreadful it is too. No wonder you cannot manage to master any skills of any use, when you are cluttering your head with such rubbish."
"I see," said Holmes, in a voice that sounded sincere to Lyndale, but that told me he didn't believe a word the man was saying. "But that doesn't explain how she committed this impossible act, the cameo theft, under the eyes of so many witnesses."
I thought for a moment. "In fact, now that I think about it, the whole idea is ridiculous," I pronounced. "There are many other items of value in that household, more easily disposed of, not least many less distinctive pieces of jewellery, I'm sure."
"I only arrived in England two days ago. I'm here professionally, you understand, on official businessâ€”auditing Church accounts. Since my arrival, I've been staying with the Franciscans in Wembley, several of whom are regular visitors to the Lyndales' home, hence my invitation. Although I knew Mr Lyndale by reputationâ€”" Again, he bowed obsequiously towards Lyndale. "â€”I was not acquainted with him before last night, nor with any of the other guests, besides those Franciscans I came with."
Mrs Smith shook her head. "No, that's all right, Mr Holmes. Perhaps..." She paused, looking at her brother, then took a deep breath. "Nicholas, perhaps you could come with me to meet your brother-in-law?"
"On the contrary! He has a strong hold over her, forcing her to cooperate. Up until this point she had acquiesced to all his orders, but this time she was unwilling to, out of a sense of loyalty to her employers. She hoped, somewhat naively, to scare Brodie off by having someone lie in wait for him on the night he broke into the Gordons. That someone was her young gentleman, a respectable if not very successful plumber by the name of Lochie. Brodie was spooked, indeed, but he did not run away. He shot Lochie."
Holmes asked a few more questions about the evening, and the other guests who had been present, but I could tell he was merely providing misdirection. He had already got what he wanted from the conversation, though what that might be, I could not tell.
Holmes shot me a pleased smile. "Precisely, Watson. Tonight will be Lyndale's last chance to get hold of those papers, and I've made sure he knows it."
Holmes never seemed to notice when he had said something earth-shattering. On this occasion, he slid himself out from behind me, and stretched languidly, treating me to an excellent view of his long lean back. Still overwhelmed by his words, I reflected with regret that that night we would be sharing our second-class carriage with four others.
Margaret was still staring at me, clearly on the verge of tears again. I was beginning to wonder whether that were her habitual expression. She was saved from answering by the sound of the door opening.
The conversation had suddenly taken a much more profound turn than I had expected. I had simply wanted to know whether he might be inclined to carry on sharing the pleasures of the bed for the foreseeable future.
Holmes threw aside the sheets and sprang from the bed. "Come along. It's already almost seven, and I want to be in Limehouse by eight.
All of this was noted with the part of my brain which Holmes tried continually, with some small success, to render as observant as his, but they were mere incidentals. The central part of my attention was concentrated on the man beside me, and I knew without needing to look that the same could be said of him.
I was quite sure that was not the only explanation for her red-rimmed eyes, but there was possibly some truth in the statement. It was indeed the season for such an affliction.
Father Briggs shook his head in apology. "You're out of luck, I'm afraid, gentlemen. I do know Joshua Wilcottâ€”he'd been working here as an odd-jobman one or two days a weekâ€”but he was arrested just ten days ago."
Holmes stood in the middle of the large living room, and span round once on his heel, taking in everything from the thick new carpet to the glistening white plaster-moulding on the high ceiling.
, I thought suddenly, an oft-suppressed fear coming unbidden into my head. I told myself that if this were a night for revelations, then now was the time to speak up, and did so in a rush, before I could lose my nerve. "However, sometimes - sometimes I fear that this cannot last forever - that you will tire of me. After all, I am a very ordinary man, and you - why, my dear fellow, you are Sherlock Holmes!"
I considered this. Had my parents been happily married? I did not think so, but as a child I had never been able to tell, and it was no clearer to me now in hindsight as I looked back with the wisdom of adulthood.
After a while I noticed that Holmes was reading along with me, upsidedown. He raised his head when I laid down my pen.
"Well, yes," I said, suddenly feeling shy. I had never distinguished between men and women, both different but equally fascinating. Holmes' gaze was on me, and I felt rather as though I were pinned under his microscope.
"Indeed I do know them," said Mr Willis as he set to work on Holmes' hair. "Not that I ever exchanged a word with any of them, o'course, but I sometimes see them at charity fetes and the like. The father's a widower, but he has two daughters and a son, all grown up."
He was a big burly man, and I could easily imagine him holding his own in the boxing ring against the East End toughs. He was not wearing friar's robes, but there was a dogcollar at his neck.
He turned away to swap the scrapbook he held for another from the pile balanced precariously on his bedside table.
"My goodness," I said, my head spinning. Now that I had overcome my initial shock, I quite agreed it was none of our business, and wished the lady well, but I could not help wishing some solution were possible with a happy ending for all parties involved. Every party suffers in family estrangements.
This earned me another smile. "I'm glad you noticed that, Watson. Not that it was very easy to miss, but nevertheless your Alistair Gordon seemed completely oblivious. Either that, or he simply does not care." He tapped out his pipe into an ashtray on the dresser and went back to frowning out the window. "As usual, Watson, I am reduced to trying to pick up the start of a trail that has already long since been washed away, dried out and tidied up. Sometimes it seems to me that my clients deliberately wait to call me, in order to make the life of a consulting detective as difficult as possible."
Holmes was gone from the bed when I awoke. For a second or two, I wondered whether I ought to take that as a bad sign, an indication of regret or embarrassment on his part.
"Lyndale should be here at nine. I just hope he leaves the house before his daughter's elopement is discovered."
Lyndale looked embarrassed. "I'd like to keep that private, Mr Holmes. It contains details best kept within the family... the ragings of a poor upset child against her family. I'm sure you understand."
He dropped into his favourite armchair, and reached for his pipe. He did not seem quite as concerned about the matter as it would surely have warranted.
I rose from the breakfast table, trying to shake off the sudden oppression that had overcome my spirit. Holmes' gaze followed the movement, and I realised I had moved more abruptly and betrayed more of my feelings than I had intended.
I appeared in the drawing room half an hour later, dressed for going out. Mildred Gordon was inclined to protest, reiterating that Mr Holmes had instructed her to oversee my well-being. Fortunately for me, my fellow practitioner appeared at this juncture, he who had treated me in the early hours of that morning, and pronounced me entirely fit.
I tidied the papers on my desk, and put my latest unfinished manuscript into a paper folder along with some blank sheets to write on in the train. Then I sat down in my armchair, idly flicking through an old edition of The Lancet, my mind on other things.
I had been through the papers before when I filed them, and as far as I remembered Lyndale's name did not appear anywhere in them. Even if he were the owner of some of the warehouses, and a beneficiary of the insurance payouts, that information did not appear in the documents I had. And yet there must be something incriminating in there. Perhaps something that the trained financial experts in the Fraud Division would find.
confidence," Nicholas Lyndale said stoutly. "Georgiana knows William, and she knows I trust him as well as I would my own... my own brother."
Father Garner was a man of medium height and build, with a detached, self-contained manner that somehow made his presence more imposing than it otherwise would have been. He brought us to a small room lined with books, a cross between a library and a study, and had one of his fellow friars bring us tea and biscuits. I got the impression he occupied a senior position among his brothers.
He would never have said so, however. I don't believe I had a single word of praise from his lips in all the time we were both alive. My brother felt the lack more than I did, I knew.
He exclaimed, and turned back to quickly twist the burette's tap, before the receptacle below it could overflow any further.
As we arrived at the door that led to the soup kitchen, a crowd of people were streaming out into the street. There were all sorts: dockers, lightermen and bargemen, a handful of clerks from the nearby shipping offices, a pair of nuns, and vagabonds from the streets.
Holmes asked a few more questions about exact times and locations during the previous evening, and then announced that he would like to interview the servants. I ended up with a notebook full of scribbled answers, and no very clear idea of the conclusions Holmes might have reached from all of it.
Having won my freedom, I was not certain what use to make of it. I stood for a moment in the hallway in my hat and coat, attempting to think of some agreeable pursuit with which I could while away a long afternoon, whilst my mind returned continually to Holmes, his cold words of dismissal and his heartfelt expression of misery. I heard a door open behind me, and turned to see Margaret Donnelly crossing the hallway, her arms full of clean linen. She stopped, seeming to hesitate as if she wished to broach some subject with me, and I summoned up the will to give her an encouraging smile, despite it being at odds with everything I felt inside.
Holmes filled and lit his pipe, his gaze returning often to my face as his nimble fingers went about their work. I met it each time with a smile.
In the cab on the way home I perused my notes, eager to complete them while the details were still fresh in my mind. I could hardly keep everyone straight in my head, so many people had we seen or heard about today. I made out a careful list of those we still had to interview tomorrow: the Winston family, the Armstrongs, and the Franciscans friars.
"I have no doubt that were the police to raid his shop, they would find evidence enough to at least convict him of dealing in stolen goods. But that is not enough of a punishment to satisfy me, or to free his victims from their living hell. Only a murder charge will be enough to take him out of their lives for good, but I cannot see my way to proving his guilt in that matter, without ruining innocent lives."
"Now a quick trip to see Lyndale," he said as we climbed in. "After that I suggest a quiet afternoon in."
The light of gas-lamps from the street only reached the area near the kirk, and our hiding place was steeped in darkness. The night air was more reminiscent of January than July, and the graveyard was cold and damp. I shifted uncomfortably, feeling a twinge in my leg.
Mrs Spencer had told us in no uncertain terms that she did not know where her sister Georgiana was, and did not wish to discover it.
"It's, ah, it's about my sister." Lyndale hesitated. Fortified by an encouraging glance from Huntington, he continued, "You may have heard that she, she has left the family home."
"It's over now, and we can't do anything about it. I don't believe Garner was blackmailing Lyndale for money, by the way. Men like Garner are usually beholden to rich donors like Lyndale. I expect Garner liked having things the other way round for once."
"I have the fakes with me," said Lyndale. "And here is a page clipped from a collector's pamphlet depicting the originals."
Although I kept my attention concentrated on my plate, my mind still distinctly unsettled, I could feel his intense gaze on me throughout my meal.
Holmes fell silent. So did I, wondering what else he might have noticed that I had not. Maybe someone had secret gambling debts, or some other reason for desperately needing a large sum of money?
I was not foolish enough to let my surprise show on my face, but surprised I was. Joshua Wilcott was one of the key figures in our last case.
After Lyndale and Huntington's departure, I turned to Holmes. "Are you really going to track down Miss Lyndale? Can't we leave her in peace?"
Willis beamed. "Glad to be of assistance, Mr Holmes. I suppose this is for one of your cases, then?"
After, I closed my eyes and stretched out luxuriously, enjoying the warmth of the bed and Holmes' favourite past-time of running his fingernails gently over my chest. After some time his fingers descended to my stomach, and their movement became slower and more exploratory. Indeed, he almost seemed to be poking and prodding me in a thoughtful, clinical fashion, reminding me that my stomach was already showing the signs of a year of peacetime living and abundant London fare.
I myself had once been involved with a fellowâ€”another medical studentâ€”of the noble and wholesome school of thought. We were friends, and something more, for six months. Every mutually satisfactory night we spent together was followed on his part by remorse and a resolution never to succumb to temptation again. He had been dismayed when I suggested we should part amicably, but I found it difficult to go on as we were. Noble self-sacrifice and self-denial had never appealed to me. He was a very pleasant fellow to spend time with, and my heart had gone out to him, unable as he was to accept and be reconciled with his own nature.
I watched through half-closed eyes as he settled himself back against the pillows and began to blow smoke up towards the ceiling. His gaze grew softer, and a thin line appeared between his brows. It was clear to me that his mind was back on the case again.
Could it always go on being this simple between us? I feared not. The world was a complicated place, with rocky currents to navigate. But Holmes seemed to want this as much as I did, and I clung to that thought like a lifebelt.
I had been thinking we might just go on like this without ever discussing the matter, but this seemed like a good opening for a conversation.
As Garner spoke, my attention was caught by a tiny movement in the corner of my eye: Lyndale shifting in his seat. He looked uncomfortable, and I could not help but wonder why. Was Garner lying? His own face and manner were impenetrable, but Lyndale was more transparent.
The three of us ate together at the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus. Over lunch, Holmes refused to speak of the case at all. He engaged Lyndale in a conversation about the organ music of Pachelbel, and then, when Lyndale proved to have little to say on the subject, moved on to recent events in the Sudan.
I turned to face him. He was draining some sort of nasty brown liquid from a burette into a basin, and continued to speak without looking at me:
"Thank you, sir. It's very kind of you, but I'm fine." She looked down at the pile of sheets, biting her lip. "Your friend, Mr Holmes - he offered to help me too. Not with hay-fever, of course, but with - " She came to a confused halt. "He seems a good man too. Is he - can I - ?"
I smiled back, not in the least offended. He would have found it difficult to offend me, at that moment. He disappeared into his bedroom, and I tried to return to the adventures of the plucky midshipman abandoned on a South Sea island. After a while Holmes reappeared, went to his suitcase and opened it, probably checking that I had remembered to include his lockpick's set.
I woke the following morning to the sound of Holmes humming to himself. He was sitting up in bed, leafing through one of the scrapbooks he kept in a pile on his dresser. He had twitched open the curtains on the window by his bed, to let in just enough light for him to read by. Through the gap I could see blue sky, and the upper branches of the plane tree out in the yard.
"Why not? Many people are." Holmes closed the book he had been reading and looked up. His gaze was directed into the distance. "My own parents' marriage was a very happy one, I believe. Not that a young child can truly understand such things, but in my memories it is so."
He paused, still frowning. "There must be a solution to this conundrum, but I cannot for the life of me think of it."
I lay sprawled out across the bed with my eyes closed. Holmes was a warm presence beside me, his shoulder rubbing mine. I could hear his breath slowly evening out, and feel the warm brush of it on my cheek. I too felt pleasurably exhausted, my limbs and eyelids heavy.
"There are rather a lot of them, aren't there?" Holmes said mildly. "One might almost think the case had been specially designed to make your head ache, my poor Watson."
Holmes rose from his chair and went to the safe. He drew from it the green folder in which I had filed the documents pertaining to our previous case, the Cable Street robberies and arson attacks. He spread out the papers on the table, and we both bent our heads over them.
I leant across the table to him and said in a low voice: "If you think I am going to give you up that easily, and for such feeble reasons, you are gravely mistaken. I have not spoken my last word on the subject, but I shan't do so here. Let us talk about this cabinet maker - Brodie is his name, if we can believe the sign above his shop."
"Stay inside, all of you, if you please," Holmes instructed us when we reached the back door. "Watson, hold the lantern for me, will you?"
"Yes. I had already guessed as much when Brodie referred to the child in the kirkyard. It is apparently almost a year old now. With her stout figure it was not difficult to conceal her condition from her employers, and when the child was born her sister came up from their village to take care of it. Donnelly supports her and the child in abject poverty on her wages. You can readily comprehend what a disaster it would be for all three of them, were her employers to learn of her supposedly immoral behaviour; they would dismiss her instantly from her position. I expect you can see why her mother's instinct is taking precedence over her desire for revenge on the man who killed her young suitor, although she has shed a great number of tears over him."
He brought his mouth to the level of my ear to murmur them. "It is not without some sacrifice on my part, I must point out, for the expression on your face upon hearing a carefully constructed string of my deductions is almost as dear to me as that which you wear in the heights of passion - and the latter, you know, is dearer to me than sight itself."
After a quick examination of the front doorâ€”"Nothing of interest," Holmes announcedâ€”and a half crown for Doris, Holmes and I returned upstairs. I hadn't wanted to speak in front of Mrs Hudson and alarm her unnecessarily, but as soon as the sitting room door closed behind us I said with a frown:
Holmes was scowling, his dark brows drawn together in frustration. "I know everything now, and yet still the monster eludes me. It is absolutely imperative that I find some way of trapping that fiend. I cannot bear to see him walk free a day longer."
"It's not a particularly happy family, is it?" Holmes said instead of answering. "No love lost between the two sisters, for a start."
For a moment he did not reply, but went on stroking my bare forearm lightly with the tips of his fingers.
"Father Briggs looked like he often took a turn in the ring himself," I said thoughtfully. "Boxing club, soup kitchen, tournaments, lectures... it seemed like a busy place. Though I wonder if all those statues are really necessary."
For a moment we regarded each other across the space which separated us, myself still not quite sure what was going through his mind, until he spoke again, choosing his words with deliberation:
Then he bent down to kiss me, and we came together, hips pounding, striving for climax, until we both spent in one glorious moment.
I had no idea what to make of this, but was nonetheless determined to investigate. Fortunately I was already familiar with the location of the street, and lost no time in directing my way thither.
Lyndale seemed distracted as we left, but he pulled himself together long enough to suggest lunch before we called on the Winstons and the Armstrongs.
I was not sure how much she knew about the events the previous night had dealt us after her departure from the kirkyard, but she certainly seemed to have taken something to heart. A host of questions flooded into my head regarding her covert meeting the previous evening with the man who subsequently shot me. I did not quite yet feel up to giving her a coherent quizzing, however, so I instead raised myself up in bed and took in my surroundings.
It was almost exactly the same response he had given me two days earlier, when I asked him if he suspected any of Lyndale's other guests. I was beginning to feel Holmes thought there was a lot more to this case than the theft of two cameos.
Sherlock Holmes was far from being modest, but he spoke the exact truth, of course, in describing my relations with him as the most important part of my life.
We were just finishing dinner when Mrs Hudson came into the room, accompanied by the new maid, who was blushing and hiding behind her mistress.
"You see an attempt to loosen the bars, Watson, which Doris noticed. No attempt to saw through the bars, though, which suggests they hoped they could accomplish their purpose in as unobtrusive a manner as possible, removing the bars and replacing them on their departure, when they found they couldn't get through the door."
In the event, we spent the evening curled up in my armchair, which was the broader of the two. With Holmes' arms around me, I read through a significant portion of my latest sea novel, while he devoured a densely written German text illustrated with rather gruesome pictures.
He said in a cold, even voice which was entirely at odds with his anguished eyes: "I rather think we should begin as we mean to go on, don't you?" Saying these word, he walked out.
A few moments later a man in a brown habit appeared at a small door towards the back of the church and directed his steps towards us.
"Very well," he said. "Perhaps you could prepare a list of guests and servants present yesterday evening, in advance of my arrival?"
One did not need to be a detective or a medical doctor to deduce why the two ladies had chosen to spend the evening in such a sedentary fashion: Mrs Spencer was clearly in a condition which must have prompted her family doctor to advise her to exert herself as little as possible. I judged her confinement to be due in less than two months.
"Thank you, Watson," he murmured, still studying the paper. Surely he could not already know the map of Edinburgh well enough to be aware of that fact! On the other hand, I would not put any feat past that great brain.
"The mainstay of his trade, if we can put it in such terms, is burglary. But he is doing something far more cruel and horrible than merely depriving the rich of their wealth. He is at the centre of a web filled with poor trapped flies like Margaret Donnelly, who must jump at his every command, their lives no longer their own.
"You evidently have something on your mind, some matter which is related to your preference regarding this evening's plans. It's not the first time you have made such a request, with that particular tone of voice and that particular look on your face."
We had only spent ten minutes or so in the company of Mrs Spencer and her sister, Georgiana Lyndale, but even I had had no trouble detecting that the cordiality with which they addressed each other was a very thin veneer indeed.
As he entered the room, Georgiana rose to her feet and looked at him warily. Before he could say a word, she burst out, "I'll tell you now, Nicholas, I shan't listen to anyone telling me to repent, or insulting my husband."
To my inexperienced eye the fakes seemed entirely convincing. I should never have suspected anything amiss, had I not had the picture of the originals to compare them to. Admittedly, the work was rather less precise, and the details a little blurred.
Holmes interrupted. "Who is this fellow, Watson? Besides the obvious: that he is Scottish, fairly well off, and neurotic."
The Lyndales kept a townhouse on West Eaton Place. At three o'clock that afternoon we were shown into a magnificent, marble-floored entrance hall, and thence to the library, where Mr Lyndale awaited us.
"Quite," said Holmes, while his gaze flickered around the room, absorbing every detail. I devoutly hoped that if he did consider my two friends as members of his list of suspects, something which was perfectly likely, then he would make no awkward comment to betray this fact to them, until such time as he had finally seen fit to clear them of suspicion.
"No, please - " He stopped. "That is, as you wish. I perfectly understand it if you would rather not be in my company at the moment."
His glorious body was spread before me, long and pale in the soft glow of the gas lamp. I ran a hand lightly down his flank, feeling him shiver under my touch.
When the maid came to clear away the breakfast things, she also brought the post. Along with the letters was a telegram, which Holmes opened first.
She did not answer immediately. Mr Smith's hand was tight on her shoulder. She put her own hand up to cover it.
He laid aside Who's Who, and I rose to put the book away, for I had learnt from experience that Holmes would leave it lying there untidily for days. When I turned away from the bookshelves, it was to find him watching me closely.
He relaxed, and sat back in his chair, stretching out his long, lean legs. "Sometimes I dream that we could be free, one day," he said in a lighter tone. "When we have grown so old and frail that we can no longer run around after the dregs of the underworld, perhaps we shall retire to the depths of the countryside, and live quite alone, without even a housekeeper - no one at all to disturb us. You will write, and I shall - watch birds or grow prize marrows or some such thing, and we shall spend days and nights on end together, without the slightest fear of discovery."
In the drawing room, we met the owners of some of the other names on the list. Mrs Catherine Tyndrum, a widow almost out of mourning, was clearly a particular friend of Mrs Spencer, the married daughter of the family. Mrs Spencer, her husband and her friend were sitting with Georgiana Lyndale, the unmarried daughter of the house.
Taking a deep breath, I said slowly: "You must promise not to laugh when I manage to write thrilling and romanticised adventure stories of your trials and tribulations with your marrows."
"I am afraid you must think my depth of feeling is less than your own, when that is far from being the case. Indeed it could not be deeper." He had begun to pace back and forth, but now he came to a halt, and stood looking down at me, one hand pressed to his temple.
We were in the living room of the Mackays, a couple who featured among the acquaintances of the Gordons. Upon hearing that they had recently suffered a burglary, Holmes had insisted on being taken to visit them. I did not quite see the connection with our case, as the burglary here appeared to be perfectly straightforward. No mysterious bodies had been found the following morning, and many items of value taken. The only connection was that the door used as a point of entry in this case had also not been forced, but this did not seem very conclusive to me, as there was certainly no shortage of lock-picks in Edinburgh.
For once, I could read his thoughts in his face: he was plainly thinking that no one can say what the future will bring.
He stiffened. "I'm sorry, I should not have assumed - how presumptuous of me. Do forgive me, Watson."
We were obliged to remain in Scotland in order to testify at the trial, and by the time we finally set foot in Baker Street, it was over a week since we had first left.
Constable Boyle, as requested by Holmes, was a stout fellow with broad shoulders, taller even than Holmes himself. He set off from our rooms carrying a cardboard file folder under one arm. Holmes, Lestrade and I followed him at a discreet distance.
He shrugged. "It is impossible to say anything at present. It may well be that the police are correct in their assumptions, be they ever so dense as their London colleagues. Your friend does give the impression in his letter of being slightly high-strung, and burglars can be dressed as respectably as any man. Nevertheless, it would ungallant in the extreme of us to ignore the sufferings of poor Mrs. Gordon." He stood up from the breakfast table. "You will wire your friend to say we are coming, and buy two tickets on the sleeper to Edinburgh tonight. I have one or two other purchases I wish to make."
"No?" I wondered if he felt they were above suspicion because they were men of God, but that did not seem likely.
Holmes had clearly been thinking something similar, for he said slowly: "One day, Watson, I shall be rich, and we shall travel alone together in first class, and hire whole suites of rooms at Le Meurice, and visit all the opera houses of Europe, and I shall take you out to dinner every evening."
"Well, perhaps I should allow Monsignor Pinet to tell the story, since it's thanks to him that we even know there is a story to tell."
"You will never develop your eye if you persist in cheating thus," Holmes said, but mildly, since he was clearly awaiting with curiosity my exposition of the contents of the letter.
That seemed rather harsh to me. I wondered whether some particular experience in Holmes' past made him speak like that, or whether it was just a general opinion. I could not tell. Indeed, it was only a few days since I had even been certain he
I tugged him into his room, where we shed our clothes as quickly as possible. I pushed him down onto the bed, and he pulled me with him, laughing softly as our limbs tangled and twisted in a clumsy dance. I laughed too, leaning down to kiss the smile from his lips.
"I have nothing further to say to you, Mr Holmes, and I believe my father has requested you to discontinue your investigation. We can only pray that Georgiana will one day repent." She rose to her feet. "Thank you for calling."
A few minutes later we stepped out onto the pavement, several ounces of hair lighter than when we had arrived at the barber's.
"I have no interest in learning which architect designed which particular hideous building, or how many times Her Majesty has visited," he said absently, underlining a paragraph in red ink.
"Well, we cannot speculate any further until this Lyndale provides us with the facts of the matter," said Holmes.
I was in the next chair across, having my hair cut by Mr Willis' assistant, and in the mirror I saw Holmes raise an eyebrow.
I smiled to myself at this high-handedness, hoping I would indeed find Lestrade to be available at the Yard.
Once she had left, I sat down in my chair. It was silent, and I was left to my own thoughts. I looked across from me, at the empty chair that was once Sherlock's. When I closed my eyes, I could see him, looking right back at me. He looked concerned, and that's how I knew he wasn't real. The real Sherlock never hadn't that look on his face, at least not very often.
"Please Tess, this doesn't have to be difficult. Just tell me what you know and we'll be done in no time at all" I spoke, trying not say anything that might trigger her temper.
"John. Never thought I'd being seeing you again." He spoke without taking his eyes off his work. "Heard bout' what happened to Sherlock. Bloody awful that is. Makin' my newest masterpiece here in honour o' him." Ah, just as stuck up as I remembered him.
"SAY THAT AGAIN." Moriarty shouted. I had to resist the urge not to jump out of my skin. Somehow it had not frightened Sherlock. The only sign that he gave of being frightened was a little twitch of his hand holding the gun.
"They all drive..." She trailed off, a confused look spreading across her face. But it was quickly replaced by an amazed look, as she started to realize what I was going on about. "Except for the woman who got kidnapped! She lives not too far away so she walks here!"
Right, the woman. That's why I was here. To help Mary's friend, whoever she is. Regaining my focus, I headed towards the alleyway behind Barts. Every step I took on this ground, every breath I took of this air, reminded me of him. Hopefully I wouldn't have to spend much more time here than I already have. Looking down the alleyway, I saw just who I was looking for, Raz. I was about to call out to him, but he spoke first.
"Take the Main Street? No bloody way!" He replied, an annoyed look on his face. "There's cops up there, and I ain't gunna get caught. Now keep quiet, I didn't bring you 'ere to make a new friend"
"My court case. You didn't show up. I got fined for that." I'm not sure why I brought that up, it just felt right.
"The "M"! The symbol! The one the kidnapper left!" Compassion for Sherlock washed over me. I never knew how gut wrenching it was to explain things to people who are slower than you. A sudden realization hit me, when had I become the quick thinking one?
"Tell her that if she answers your questions, she won't have to go anywhere" Sherlock suggested. Well, more like instructed.
I couldn't find him. I looked everywhere Sherlock and I had spent time with Raz, but he was nowhere to be found.
"Come on Greg, it's so simple even you could figure it out!" What I said had been a little rude, but I was too thrilled to notice.
"I was thinking.." she started to say. "Maybe we could go out to dinner, you know, to celebrate!" Dinner. She was asking me to dinner. Wait...was she asking me on a date?! A date...with Mary. Normally, I wouldn't hesitate to say yes, but this time, something was different.
I took a deep breath as I looked at the shape of Sherlock with wide eyes. He couldn't...he wouldn't...would he?
"Fibbing, Mrs. Hudson." I sometimes wonder if my super power was one of the only reasons Sherlock kept me around.
She had a surprised look on her face. Did people really believe I was going to stay in bed forever? To be fair, that's what I was planning.
"I forgive you." The look of shock on Lestrade's face when I said those three words, was worth it all.
"Yes hello. Very nice to meet you Mrs. Morstan." She was quite a good looking woman. She had short blond hair, eyes as blue as the ocean, and a smile you just couldn't help but smile back at. She seemed surprisingly calm, considering her friend had just been kidnapped.
"Yes...It was Lestrade" She whispered, not making eye contact. I just barley made out what she had said.
"Damn" I cursed under my breath. Although I don't know what I was expecting, you can never rely on Sherlock to get milk. However, I continued making my pancakes. How hard could it possibly be?
I nodded at her with appreciation. Mrs. Hudson was most likely the only person I could stand right now.
"John! You're back! Where did you go anyways? Was that Raz guy helpful? Well obviously he was." Lestrade rambled on. It took me a moment to finally get his attention.
"No clue. But if we want to find the missing girl, we need your help." He was practically begging me to help him. "What do you say John," Lestrade said folding his hands on the table. "Are you up for a new case?"
"Wait, you actually kidnapped someone" asked Raz. I turned to face him. He has been so quiet I had forgotten he was there.
"Right. The client's name is Mary Morstan. She was at home on a Friday night watching a movie with three of her friends. She told us that one of her friends heard a sound coming from the back door, and decided to investigate." Lestrade paused and scratched behind his ear. He was nervous. Why was he nervous? I gave him a look as if to say "Hurry up".
"I don't want to bring you to the police station, but I will if I have to." I told her, trying to give my words a commanding tone.
"Not hungry" I replied. "Now answer the question." Who was she to think that she couldn't tell me who called me on my own phone!?
"You can't be aloud to continue. You just can't." Moriarty shook his head. "I would try to convince you but, everything I have to say has already crossed your mind." His voice changed from many different tones whilst saying this. He spread his arms out and gave a little smirk. He was enjoying himself.
"Yes, just a little shaken up" she said, with a soft smile. We stood for what felt like hours, but must have only been a couple of minutes. I felt the need to say something, but I had no idea what. I was always the one the break the silence with Sherlock, and now I can't even hold a decent conversation. After a little while longer,, Mary spoke.
Hearing his voice in my head, I remembered the Buckingham Palace. That had been a strange day. The day we met Irene Adler. The Woman. Although Sherlock never admitted it, he had feelings for her. I just know it.
"No. It's his sister, Teresa" I commented. Funny, how everyone always assumes it's the man who's the one to blame. I couldn't help but smile. I solved a case. Not only did I solve the case, I solved it in one day.
"John, calm down. Breath. Fear is just wisdom in the face of danger, nothing to be ashamed of!" Sherlock was trying to calm me down, which was quite out of character of him. Never the less, it worked, so I was grateful for it. I can't let Moriarty distract me, not now. I took a deep breath, regained my wits, and turned my focus back on Tess. I was about to ask where the victims were, but Raz beat me to it. "The victims, where are they?" I was surprised with him, I've never seen his responsible side. "Ya'know what? I don't care. Just go get em' and bring em' to John."
"Why would you do that?" I asked. I knew I was most likely throwing my chances of catching the kidnapper away, but I had to ask.
"No-wait." He turned around and looked at me with a surprised face. I stood up."Let me hear the rest of the case, then I'll decide if I'll help for not." A bit of hope flashed in his eyes.
"I'm not going nowhere with you" she sneered at me. I probably would have exploded at her if it wasn't for Sherlock standing beside her.
"Soo...I'm just going to say this straight out. I can't help you with your case. I'm not Sherlock."After I had calmed down, I managed to have a civil conversation with Lestrade. He was sitting across the table from me.
The answer to that question is: pretty damn hard. Replacing milk with water is harder than it sounds. But when I finally finished cooking, it was 100% worth it. Just as I was sitting down in my chair, Mrs. Hudson burst into our flat.
"Well, 'ere she is John." She? I followed his eyes to see who he was looking at. A girl. The kidnapper is a girl. A pretty cute girl.
"Teresa, you're under arrest for the abduction of Layla Smalls and Jared Gray" Lestrade spoke these words he's probably spoken so many times before. He snapped his handcuffs on her, and brought her over to his car, where he placed her in the back seat. I watched him drive off, and realized I still had his phone. I didn't realize that Mary had took a place beside me.
"Right. Mrs-er, Mary..." I threw a shy smile at her. What was I doing?! I'm here to solve a case, not get a date! Maybe if I keep repeating that in my head it might stick. "I'm just going to start out and ask some simple questions, okay?" I was trying to be gentle with her. Why was I trying to be gentle? If I'm too gentle she'll think I think she can't handle what's going on, which she can, of course. I mean, I think she can.
"Right. Tess. I don't want to cause any trouble, I just want to ask some questions" I stated calmly.
"You see, um..." Lestrade trailed off. If Sherlock was here, he probably would have scared it out of him by now. I threw him an annoyed look, which will hopefully speed the process up. And then he came out with it, all at once. " is helping with the case."
"Hey! Old man! Turn up your hearing aid! We're 'ere." He explained snarkily. Still fighting the urge to punch him, I brought my attention back to the case.
"I was just going to make your morning tea" she said, looking me over. I probably looked awful. I had been in bed for a week, only getting up to drink and use the loo.
Now his stupid voice in my head was just pointing out the obvious. Of course I had to go there sometime! I'm not ready yet.
"Ah! You smell much better now" she replied, avoiding the question. Why would she avoid the question?
"Eat some food and I'll tell you who it was" She said, handing me my plate. Was she bribing me? If she was, it was working. I took a bite of toast. It was all I could stomach.
"John, I understand this is hard for you, but this case is very important. We're at our wits end. We need your help." He threw me a desperate look. He clearly had no hope on solving this case.
"If you answer my questions, you won't have to go anywhere" I insisted. I took a step closer, trying to intimate her. "And besides, if you're innocent, you should be able to answer my questions with nothing to hide."
"Nothing" I replied, almost to quickly. They seemed suspicious, but let me keep talking. "Anyways, uhm, Tess, did you sell that spray paint to someone, or did you put the mark there yourself?" She let out a frustrated sigh before answering.
From the looks of it, it seemed that Sherlock threw his phone on the ground. He gave me one last look, a look that told me everything we were never quite able to say to one another. Those three words that would have changed everything. He knew if he said them, he wouldn't be able to go through with it, so he kept quiet.
I had to resist the temptation to punch him. If he wasn't vital in my case, I probably would. "Right." I pulled out my-Lestrade's phone and showed him the picture of the "M". "Do you know the author?"
"Well, Mary and her two friends ran outside to see what had happened. When they got outside, they saw, well the girl was missing and all that was left was a symbol, on the ground." Lestrade grabbed a pen and paper and started drawing something. After about 15 seconds, he turned the paper around and showed me what he had drawn. It was the letter M with two diagonal slashes, going downwards to the bottom right, through the M.
"Is there a problem, Dr. Watson?" Mary bit at me. I was confused at first, but then, too late I realized that I had scoffed out loud.
"Fibbing." He may have been the world's best-and only consulting detective, but I could always tell if someone was lying.
"Well I don't know nothing. And you should stay out of other people's business. One day it'll get you killed." She stated, like it was a completely normal thing to say. I should have known this wouldn't be as easy as coming here, getting the victims, and leaving. It's never that easy. Sherlock always made this look so easy. I'll never know how he did that. Always knowing what to ask, what to do, what to say. I knew none of that! I was about ready to break down. I don't know what to do, I thought.
"For once, I actually agree with him" Raz stated. "If you've got nothin' to hide, you should be able to answer his questions." Tess looked shocked. From what I can make out, Raz and Tess are very close. It must have come as a shock to her that her brother was taking someone else's side.
"Oh no, please. You've got the rest of your life" Sherlock replied. He waved his gun at him for dramatics.
"NOW" he shouted, drawing the attention of passerbys. She walked away, tears in her eyes. Raz and I stood in silence, until I dared to speak.
Mrs. Hudson scolding you was like a mother scolding her child. You couldn't un-see the look she gave you. She crossed the room and slammed the door behind her as she left the room. I had never seen her this ferocious before.
"I didn't want you to think I was trying to replace Sherlock." I understood. Understood why Lestrade had been treading so carefully around me. He didn't want me to think he was replacing the person whom I cared for the most. As much as I hate to admit it, I think the reason I was angry with Lestrade, was because I did think he was trying to replace Sherlock. And in doing this, he would be saying that he never truly cared for Sherlock, only used him for his brains. A sudden wave of guilt washed over me. All this time he was just trying to watch out for me.
Coming back to reality, Mary was still standing across from me, waiting for me to reply. Jesus, I haven't been this in shock since Irene Adler flirted with Sherlock.
Ah of course. I could always count on Sherlock to have something to say, even when he's not here. He's the King of Comebacks. He would outlive God trying to get the last word.
The worst part, was that the longer I took to decide, the more danger this woman, whoever she is, was in. I was sitting in my chair in the sitting room, eating some dry cereal for breakfast, (I was out of milk, but I refused to leave the flat until I absolutely had to.) when something on the tele caught my attention. The woman speaking said something that made my jaw drop.
Mary laughed. "You don't have to look so scared." I didn't respond, just smiled. When Mary realized I wasn't going to respond, she spoke. "Goodbye John. I hope we'll meet some other time, on better circumstances." I watched her catch up to Layla, linking arms with her. Was I missing out? Declining her date offer. She's an amazing woman really, but my gut told me to run away from her and never turn back. I have to make a decision now, I thought. Trust my gut, or my heart.
"Even if I could help on the case, my answer is still no.. It reminds me too much of...him. In fact, everything reminds me of him. I can't go anywhere without thinking of him!" If my conscience was trying to guilt Lestrade, the look on his face told me it was working. I titled my head up, trying to hold back my tears. I would not cry in front of him.
"Oh nothing" she said, giving me a look that clearly said it wasn't nothing. "Mind if I have one of those?" Mrs. Hudson asked cheerfully, eyes drifting towards my small pile of pancakes.
"It had been about ten minutes after she left, that Mary grew concerned. She was about to check to see what she was doing, when she heard a scream. Her friend's scream." He looked around the room. "Listen, John, What I'm about to tell you is top secret. You have to swear on life you won't tell anyone." I did I quick look over of Lestrade. He was fidgeting with his hands and now that I think of it, he's been constantly looking over his shoulder, as if someone was about to show up. What was he so afraid of?
That...actually isn't a half bad idea. If I have to deal with his voice in my head, I might as well put it to good use. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and then opened them again. I was facing Tess, but this time, I saw Sherlock beside her. He gave me an encouraging nod.
"Right, uh, the deal I made with her was that if you couldn't help with the case, which I doubt, of course, then I have to let her try to solve it." He looked ashamed of himself, which I didn't understand. He's getting extra help, what's the big deal about that?
He fell gracefully, his coat whipping behind him. I was frozen on the spot. Before I could react, before I could even move, he was already on the ground. I stared wide-eyed. As soon as I snapped out of it, I began to jog over to him. My blood was rushing and my fists were clenched. I almost reached him, but then I got knocked over by some idoit bike rider who wasn't watching where he was going. I fell to the ground, having the air knocked out of me. I stayed on the ground for a moment or two, but quickly regained my strength and made it over to Sherlock. There was a crowd surrounding him.
