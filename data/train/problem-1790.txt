"Then you reunite with her and continue to live out a life of domestic bliss, I imagine," Sherlock replies softly. He’s shirtless, naked save for pyjama bottoms, his wound dressed in clean, white bandages, leaning up against the pillows on his bed. He has never looked so vulnerable and John's chest aches in something akin to sympathy but more like longing.
This isn't their first meeting, so Sherlock is surprised, even somewhat disgusted at himself for how much he is fretting over this. It's pathetic really, and he scoffs and rolls his eyes at his smartened up appearance in the mirror; at the note he leaves for his parents with detailed instructions including
"Thanks." John rolled his eyes. "Where were you? Why have you got your coat on?" He gestured to Sherlock's long, expensive looking coat and the blue scarf wrapped around his neck. Sherlock had worn this signature outfit as long as John could remember, even in first year.
19:31 It’s Valentine’s day. SH
"Merlin, no." John laughed. "I thought you weren't into relationships and...feelings and all that
"Oh. Bad luck." As John bit into his own chocolate, he heard gentle, tired footsteps approaching. Looking up, he saw Greg standing at the other side of the bed. If Molly had looked tired and emotionally drained, Greg was grey with exhaustion. The bags under his eyes were defined and dark, his eyes lacking the teasing, cheerful glint it usually had. His hair was dishevelled, unbrushed, sticking up at awkward angled like he had just woken up (which, John contemplated, he probably had). He wasn't wearing his uniform - rather, a loose fitting t-shirt and crumpled jeans. When John's gaze fell back on Greg's face, he saw that he wasn't smiling. Not even remotely. Instead, he nodded at John and stated simply, "McGonagall said you were awake."
“Fuck you.”
"Is it?" Now he was really, really confused.
Sherlock sighed loudly. “Look, she has all her jewellery cleaned except for her ring, which is around ten years old, state of her marriage right there. The inside of the ring is cleaned, polished from being removed regularly, so she has a string of lovers. Not just one, there’ no way she’d be able to keep up the persona of being single for so long, so there are multiple. Her collar is wet, so she had it turned up against the wind and rain, but it was too windy for her umbrella. There are mud splatters on her leg from dragging the suitcase – “ he gestured at the body – “ and it shows the size of the suitcase there. She was staying overnight somewhere. And where in the last twenty four hours has it been raining? Cardiff.” He showed the screen of his phone to the room, hearing John cry out some form of praise, then started talking again.
Is horrifying.
Gavin paused, probably contemplating what the hell a friend of Sherlock's would even look like. The image not being anything worthy of respect no doubt.
He ended up half dragging John and half contemplating the consequences of carrying him down the hall. Sherlock didn't really fancy the idea of a broken back at the moment. So, upon reaching the bedroom door Sherlock realized he couldn't use his hands. Keeping his grip firm on John's bicep, he reared his dress-shoed heel back and kicked the door open. John winced at the noise and peered up at him through squinted eyes. The sound clearly paining him. "Did you just break your door?"
“Shut up and listen—“
John gritted his teeth, his face still pressed against the now slick surface beneath his head. It was either blood or sweat, and he couldn't care less if he tried.  "What the fuck do you bastards think you're doing?!"
But it isn’t that, Sherlock wields a contrition balky in the face of the prosaic enjoyments of an everyday walker. A pure yearn to simply know for the sake of it. A distraction in a drive. His perspective and approach may speak of a brazen regard for academics which may... say in the future, pave way for a yearn to evaluate and reckon social sciences, but he would appear clueless to what makes a friend a friend. His blatant disregard for social cues under the guise of them restricting genius, but what he deems trivialities allotted an implication of what wouldn’t be. It was an innocence that failed to be noticed past an initially unprecedented precocity.
John chuckled, a little surprised at the crack the drone made, and silently glad that there wasn't going to be a dramatic scene resembling some romantic comedy drama. One thing he didn't fancy was getting a suitcase to the face...or in this case, a baton. Right, no suitcases, didn't live here. He truly would be upset if he left without a farewell, it was the least he could do- oh god had he even said thank you?
It was like watching a movie in a way. The characters misfortune or glee elicited ghosted sympathy or understanding in Sherlock. If only because it was starring him himself. He found the chest constrictions and raging, desperate flares that burned at the memories captivating. Second-handed.
John emerged from the cabinet grumbling and rubbing the top of his head. Did he do that on purpose? Sherlock merely blinked at him. The prick.
"Coming?" John called down from the 12 foot high peak.
Sherlock frowns in confusion for a moment—oh.
not even John’s
John's eyebrow twitched. "I am calm-"
"Get back here you fucking fag!" The voice had gotten alarmingly closer since its last insult.
John blinks down at him, a little peeved at the outburst. Watching the vehement bean-pole slouch in defeat and slide a hand down his face. Pinching the bridge of his nose, Sherlock then mutters. “My apologies John. This must be terribly ironic to your rugby alienation.”
What a surprise. Sherlock growled at the unresponsive form in his arms, a sick feeling beginning to grip his insides. "You're going to
“If you can truly manage to believe such fallacious logic, then surely even you can see that you’re just a few sandwiches shy of a picnic.”
Sherlock looked down at John and nodded to the shrub-clad male. "Bullet, Anderson? And I take it you've kept the mayors head in its exact position since its unfortunate leister?"
"Colleague." It was Sherlock who answered, still and meditative on the project before him.
Today really isn’t his day.
His socially-acceptable and concerned-citizens call remained unanswered.
Then Sherlock was punched in the face, the right hook looking absolutely vicious, accompanied by a feral snarl muffled by the first mans mask-looking every bit the muzzle it was. Effectively slamming Sherlock to the right and into the hard counter, his lithe torso crashing into the edge.
” Two thick, dark brows wiggle on the exaggeratedly French intonation. “Isn’t that right? You want
That seems fair. Sherlock offers his hand. John rolls his eyes in a gold-metal worthy show of I’m-fond(insane)-and-annoyed, but hands Sherlock his flip-phone. Sherlock rolls it along the line of his palm as the engraved metal casing glimmers up at him.
"Do you recognize the bullet?"
Oh, it was a joy to be Captain again, he must’ve gotten lost in the cross-fire.
They stay there for a while. And John doesn't think about how Sherlock's body and warmth held so closely to his felt  better than the blanket his mother made for him after Sherlock used it.

After a few tense minutes passed Sherlock turned towards the kitchen with a dramatic sigh and looked down at the area he was hidden behind. "You can come out now." John remained crouched and uncertain. "I'm not going to kill you, I would have done so earlier." The baritone voice drawled. After a few tense minutes he reluctantly rose from behind the counter. The man could easily just hold him at gun point and make him come out. And John supposed he had a point. "How did you know I was there?" He asked a little miffed at being found so quickly, he had been so careful, but mostly trying to take attention off the weapon. He felt a little more relaxed now that he could see the gun had been set on a cluttered coffee table, but not by much.
He groaned as his head lolled onto the soft fabric of a coat. When the unsettling sensation passed he cocked his head back gently and tried to comprehend what was happening. "John, are you alright?"
Too far gone to notice the odd use of his name from a complete stranger he opened his eyes to look at his savior and answered. "You have pretty eyes," John told him earnestly. The stranger stuttered in stride but quickly continued walking again. They shook their head. "I'll take that as a 'no'." The stranger muttered. John just kept staring at him and after a few more moments of staring he asked: "What?" At least he was still conscious. "You're really beautiful," John repeated, although his vision was still quite blurry, he could discern the figure in warm lighting that shone over a head of curly brown locks, giving it a halo-like effect, as well as the two keen eyes observing him from underneath curled bangs.
Upon finishing, and nearly weeping, he subsequently found himself pacing the small room in nerve.
The amplification of unconscious necessity (no—desire. Controllable.) evoked by what he subconsciously 'wouldn’t mind’ or ‘could tolerate’ that he would find frequently bubbling into rational everyday thought or musings in a not dissimilar manner. Which was out of his control, his bloody character, and his previously thought utterly insubstantial expectation for said ‘affection’.
"Was that mommy?" He grinned down at Sarah and stooped down to her level. "Yep!" He replied and clutching her shoulders. "Hey, how old are you again?" He asked with an exaggerated curious frown. Sarah smiled excitedly. "Seven and a half!" Moriarty's face went dumbfounded. "Woah, really? That's pretty cool." He nodded his head and pursed his lips in thought as he looked to the side in impressment. Then he snapped his head back to her. "Do you think you can go in the elevator and press the button that says number twelve and when it opens you go to the door that says the number on your key?"
But he understood. Sherlock may not be aware-- even think he’s above it all—but it adds up. Subconsciously even. And the revelation is going to hurt when it becomes too hard to ignore. John refuses to let that happen to him. Not while he’s here.
Becoming a pawn or a page six headline. Going willingly would never be an option, and neither was participating in such nauseating territory. Should the opportunity ever present itself, he'd be caught dead before joining the damned organization, if you could even call it that. Spider's acts were nothing short of monstrous. And he expected nothing less from his own institution. His boys would remain loyal, as he had done so for them many a time...well.
"Tell me, John. Do you enjoy romantic comedies?" And so startlingly cliché by norm. He found he quite liked it.
"Watch it punk." Anderson's occluding breath washes over his face, he wants to gag. Waking him from his initial surprise, as Anderson had never touched him before. But he brings up his hands to push at Anderson's all the same, they were wrinkling his shirt too. Damn it, if Anderson ripped it he might just bite him. At least he didn't link Sherlock to his Twix bar exploding in his face at lunch yesterday.
“Aye aye, Captain!” Salutes Dante with a sardonic lift of his brow before swiveling back to the others, his hand raised like an enthused kindergartener. “I call blindside flanker!”
? He was merely catching a quick shag, as was John. They were only upholding false fronts in effort to attract one another and obtain what they wanted. The feeling increased for reasons he refused to look into, and so he ignored it.
“Orally, right?”
Sherlock had been a buggering fool.
Mrs. Hudson hummed and picked up a dented can of soup. "I'm afraid it's already too late for that, dear." She beckoned him over to the counter, tapping a leather barstool that had seen better days.
Sherlock seemed a little shocked, more of a dulled reaction though. Like a 'courageous' teen excitedly clicking a rumored and rather disturbing video on YouTube, then remaining still for a good few minutes afterwards, suddenly afraid to cross the room to turn their lamp light on.
Symphony in C Minor, for he was feeling particularly bold, and slips his arms through the hoodie that had previously been hanging off the peeling door’s hinge. It must have fallen when John entered. Normally, he’d wear his beloved woolen trench-coat over one of his suits, but he held no ill-conceived notion of the surrounding area. In short, he isn’t daft enough to prance around a lions den in a meat suit.
Soon enough, the sound of fists striking flesh and bone filled the air. But, Sherlock was surprisingly silent. Despite having his head repeatedly whacked to and fro, his face undoubtedly decimating beneath the force by now.
"Hello~" A voice on the other line cooed. "I've successfully made it to the lift without so much as a second glance. So far we're in the clear. I'll notify you once I've reached the 12th floor." She informed them curtly."
Having his entire life declared to him from his wallet wasn't something John thought he'd ever experience. But he was in awe. "That was brilliant. Absolutely brilliant." He said after a pause, eyes narrowed at the figure incredulously. He may have sounded a little too reverent, but Sherlock deserved to know. Telling from Sherlock's expression, he had been expecting something rather different. Which was strange.
“Users, users, Sherlock.” With a beseeching coo, Jim’s hands come up to clasp his shoulders in a consoling manner befitting a belligerent toddler that is, ironically, Jim himself. Sherlock remains still at the intrusion, settling to regard him with a sarcastic tilt of his head to beckon Jim to resume rambling about what he clearly deemed clear as day on his own.
John felt himself be clutched close, a cold, painfully tight grip on his forearms. He jerked his head upwards in alarm, and heard Sherlock begin speaking. Voice harsh and calm and uncomfortably close. "Oh, how could I forget?" The sentence bordered closely on a growl. " I can be harassed, discriminated, reviled, but god forbid I do anything in retaliation." His baritone gradually deepening in rage, eyes boring into his own.
"What's wrong mommy?" Sarah asked in confusion, brushing a stray hair away from Carol's rapidly wetting face. Carol shook her inclined head and let out a wet laugh. She turned to look at her safe, alive, happy, and unharmed daughter and attempted to smile comfortingly, but her lips started quivering.
Sherlock huffs a sudden laugh and flips to page 402. The Sanctuary of Hercules housed another hideous, unknown Roman General, marvelous. Was he nicknamed toothless in his day? “And London’s falling. Why are you here?”
"Ah!" An alerting vowel sounded from the backseat. "Take a left at the prostitute on the corner, yes, right there." The cabbie smirked upon catching sight of his destination. He chuckled lowly and glanced up at his customer through the rearview mirror. His mysterious customer, hunched over and leafing through his wallet, returned his lewd, reflected gaze with a confused one of his own.
"'Invite me into the house of Christ'." He finished and regarded her impassively; rendering her silent. "I'm not particularly interested in subjecting myself to such bigoted adherents." John frowned at him but said nothing; long before leaving the kitchen to observe the spectacle that was Sherlock. It was interesting to see. Two types of people, both so contrast. So disproportionate.  What people were willing to do to others, their effort to change one another due to their ideals. Their ideals being regarded as completely and utterly fallacious to the other. Constantly clashing, this was humanity after all, it was an everyday war. Quiet at times and loud at others. But Sherlock... someone as contrastive as him had yet to find anyone to share likeness. Let alone at all. John felt his chest spike with something familiar and gelid; he swallowed it.
"Wet," came the honest reply.
"Fine," he said. "In what position do you want me?"
I was."
She shakes her head. "I'd rather you didn't. You've got to go home."
to act tonight."
"Of course not, John. I remember everything about your numerous girlfriends."
"Stop. Stop right there. You said you wouldn't let Moriarty's stupid little mindgames get to you, that yes, you desired me in the basement, but did even before that."
"Grateful?" John echoed, disbelieving. "You tortured my best friend!"
Turned out they
A shot ripped the air and the man holding the gun fell dead on the riverbank. Moriarty looked up to the bridge and grinned widely at the invisible silhouette he knew was standing there.
"Great! Let's go away for the weekend."

"He would have reacted like a kid, surely."
Sherlock watched the woman read the card with a slight regal frown, then put it down on the table next to her glass of wine and
"What are you so embarrassed about? You have seen me undress many times before."
"I didn't say that!" she cried, outraged. "Don't tell me
"Well... You should probably answer anyway."
"... because I'm funny?"
"Excuse me?"
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"Yeah, well stop thinking if it puts you in such a mood. It's scary, man."
"Because it doesn't
"What about him?"
John stopped wriggling and lay still. Soon his expression of surprise was replaced with one of indignation.
"Sherlock?"
!" John snarled — and he could almost hear Sherlock's tone in his voice. He closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. "What did you call me here for?"
The manul bristled. He knew he couldn’t act up now, for many reasons. There was no telling what that nutcase would do if he did — somehow, being reported to the staff didn’t seem like such a bad thing now that he was faced with Ferdinand’s sheer insanity.
"The barman's an old friend," she replied. Then, as if she suddenly thought of something: "Look, actually I'm married, and I'm not here to..."
For instance, to understand what in the world prompted Sherlock to give him a bloody
"I see. Well, we might come by tomorrow to see him."
"But Sherlock, you've never–"
want?"
"Look at you, Sherlock. Just look at you!"
"So what if your henchman noticed me? It's not as if he didn't already know you were staying just across the street from his target."
But John, who had understood his reluctance, had kissed him and murmured that it would definitely hurt the both of them much more if they were to stay like this all night. This argument, which was in fact a good one, and John's caresses, had finally convinced Sherlock. He'd let his friend slide out of him. But he'd refused to let him go any farther.
Seb. I think I'll miss him. Some part of him. But honestly, can you picture him as a devoted bodyguard and henchman? I can't.
You smile. "Then what are you doing in bed?"
at you. He mentioned the riding crop."
"Maggie!" John exclaimed in outrage.
Mycroft's tone was quite dispassionate, and he appeared to be completely indifferent to John's fury. Of course, it only unnerved the doctor even more.
Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,

How late is it?
She gives you a look.

"I had gathered as much."
"I mean gone, gone!"
Something in John's gaze wavered, and he sat back down silently. Sherlock took another bit of toast and ate it, more slowly this time. He didn't glance once at John, not wanting to see his expression. John's pained expression was actually painful to see – it didn't express any complaint or plea; just tension and steel features, the expression of a man used to being confronted with terrible things. Sherlock hated to see it.
"I cleaned Sherlock's room," she said darkly.
John blinked upon realizing what he had just thought. He massaged his temples, trying hard not to start laughing like a madman in his office.
The room was full of light. The sun was coming in through the bright green foliage of the trees just out the windows and was reflected a thousand times on the various mirrors inside. This was the reception room in the house from his childhood, Sherlock remembered. They never used it unless they received guests. It was a pity, because it was one of the brightest rooms of the mansion.
He stares at you, lost, struggling against his turmoil. You swallow with difficulty. Your throat is too tight.
‘I called 995,’ Victor’s voice came, weak, and obviously in pain, but alive. ‘…catch him?’
"Why don't
"Yes of course," you reply quickly.
Sherlock wailed resoundingly but complied. He was so scared and it felt just so
Sebastian's face split into an amused smile.
"She wanted to off Mary Morstan! Y'know, John's wife… Or perhaps I should've let her? Should I have let her, Sherlock? Do you want her dead? Is that what you want?"
. Strange, isn't it?
John couldn't repress a chuckle.
He gives you a look.
John started the water and waited until it was warm to test it on Sherlock's right palm.

"You want to sleep already? Dull."
John was surprised. He too had been observing Sherlock, and at first he thought that what his friend had read on his face had hurt or disappointed him. He fumbled, and tried to finish his sentence one way or the other.
"Did you find anything at all?" John asked him once they were having a beer at the pub. Greg sighed.
, Sebastian typed.
"I thought we could... have coffee."
began.
"Of some sort, yes."
Sherlock wandered a little to familiarize himself with the layout of the hotel. But there was not much more to be done tonight and soon, he headed back to the room. Victor was nowhere to be seen. Sherlock found himself strangely thankful for his unobtrusiveness. If one could apply such a term to Victor Trevor.
In fact, all of Sherlock's reactions were endearing to John. He was so sensitive it was a pleasure to touch him in the simplest ways. Gradually, the several ejaculations helping, Sherlock relaxed. Each time he came, John felt him tighten around his fingers – two, now – and in the afterglow he could feel Sherlock's sphincter muscle slacken around them. Each time, he spread more lube all over the area and on his fingers before penetrating Sherlock again.
Sherlock stared at the empty chair in which John had been sitting just a moment ago and shivered. It hurt. Had he really 'hurt' Lestrade? Did 'hurt' feel like this? He hadn't done anything wrong, he'd just deduced and...
"Ah, thank you! Well, uhm... goodbye?"
"I wanted to go to China."
wasn't a good time.
"Yes, note on her fridge. Did she say she would bring it to the Met?"
"What?"
They do. They look very happy together. Mary Morstan was Godsend for John. Or maybe it was the other way around.
Really? What was it, then?"
, John remembers writing on his blog a bit after the Pool incident,
He does not stiffen in your arms, but you can feel him shift a bit. "This is awkward."
"We don't have anything to do with a murder," the man said.
"Nothing. You're imagining things."
She knew he was watching her closely, relishing any sign of acrimony and revulsion that would escape her. She kept her face in check, impassive. But she felt a tremor in her right hand, itching. She clutched the stereo system. Jim's smile broadened.
John hoped it had been that. The way Sherlock had recoiled when he had touched him was still fresh in his mind. He knew it was because of the nightmare, or rather, because of the bloody
"You can do whatever you want."
"You don't want me here then! You don't see me as a friend. I understand, I'll leave, and never come back!"
side of the balance.
‘I shall show you my treasures! You’ll understand, won’t you, since you are one of them. Look. This is tiger bone wine. It’s a wonderful tonic! I have a few bones themselves, too, to avoid spirits. Not that I believe in spirits, but you never know!’
In the end Sherlock had waited and waited, petting John, focusing on his every reaction to see what kind of caress, and where, was the most effective on him. But John had not fallen asleep; Sherlock hadn't either, for that matter. And so after an hour of silence in the peaceful darkness of Sherlock's bedroom, both of them were as awake as ever, and, John feared, just as edgy.
"Come on, don't sulk."
"Yes, mother hen."
"Well maybe Greg said it, can't remember. You take sugar in your coffee now because Sherlock used to. And you stopped putting milk in it."
"Come here. Sit down on the rim of the bathtub, will you?"
The gentleman arched an eyebrow.
For the first time, you think about Sherlock's mother, who from what you know is still alive, somewhere. Alive while her son is dead. It never crossed your mind. You thought about Mycroft, and reckoned he must have suffered, but felt like putting a bullet in his head nonetheless. Now you're calmer, and even though you won't admit it out loud, almost ready to forgive him. Which means you've probably forgiven him already.
But he did not.
Sherlock's breath caught in his throat, but John went on before he could say a thing.
"Indeed. It is, thankfully, just morning. We still have time to get to Brixton."
"Mr. Holmes! I am so glad you could make it so fast!" Hilton Cubitt exclaimed, walking up to them briskly, his complexion more sanguine than ever. He did indeed seem overly glad.
They had a staring contest and Sherlock won. Distressed, the manul fidgeted. Sherlock arched an eyebrow and waited. He wasn't a very patient man, but he could wait when he knew he'd get what he wanted in the end. Reluctantly, the fluffy cat emitted an imperceptible meow.
"What-"
"It's dangerous."
He came closer as the tiger gave him a look.
They had another staring contest, but Irene no longer knew who was searching who.
"Hey, something wrong with your doctor?"
"You mean... her husband rapes her?" He nods. "And hits her?" He nods. "Can we kill him?" He smiles shakily.
The little men were still dancing madly before his eyes, spinning, spinning...
Perhaps Sherlock's active dislike of beds began because of the stupid nannies who told him he had to be in bed even when he wasn't sleepy. You won't fall asleep if you are not in bed in the first place! they'd say. Good little boys are in bed and sleep at this hour! Sherlock could only deduce he was not a good little boy.
He shivered and paused in his explanation. Lestrade arched an eyebrow.
"You have to go with Hilton to the Broads today."
Edit: This chapter was kindly betaed by MusicWritesMyLife. All oddities that remain are my responsibility - it means I did not listen to her advice when I should have ;)
But John didn't seem to be doing much thinking at all, and appeared to be lost in his eyes. In a tiger's eyes, for goodness' sake!
"Just don't make too much noise, will you?"
. John scowled, but didn't complain and complied, dialling Molly's number.
just because Sherlock had asked him if they were on a date? Well. Thing was, Sherlock wasn't just Sherlock. He was a man.
considering fighting back.
The consulting detective just shrugged as John retrieved the file Lestrade had left with Mrs. Hudson. There was a note with it – Lestrade saying he sincerely hoped Sherlock would help, having once stood him up even though he'd taken the time to come himself. Also they should not keep the file once they had read the contents, he was breaking enough rules as it was, he shouldn't even be telling them any of this, etc. John felt a pang of guilt and made a note to thank the D.I. next time he saw him. Sherlock was very lucky to have him as a friend.
"Because I'm doing better," Sherlock declared decidedly.
"I know you would, dear. That's why you're so precious to me."
John wasn't always a romantic, and he certainly had commitment issues (although he would argue that this was beyond the realm of his own responsibility). But still, he always relied on codes.

. He had to fight down a new surge of panic. Who knew what the drug would do to his system in this form? Would there be any lasting effects after he transformed back? And if he needed medical attention, how would he even begin to explain the issue at hand? He shook his head. He had more pressing worries for the time being.
His whole body twitched and he went along with it, continuing the involuntary reaction and bringing it to a full movement. He couldn't properly undulate because he wasn't supple enough, but he could transform the spasm into a vibration, let the quiver in his hand spread to his whole body and turn it into a dance move. He started tapping his left foot on the floor and shaking his head imperceptibly, beating time, as if to react to the overwhelming feelings of self-hatred and self-pity: a wish to stay alive and make something out of this wreck he had become.
Sherlock simply held him, and did not make any comment.
"Is Sherlock with her now?"
"Well, if you're rather...uneasy with horses, why don't we go for a car ride through the countryside?" Elsie offered amiably.
You tilt your head to the side perplexedly and arch an eyebrow.
"Hello Mycroft. I'm happy you could make it today."
13:52
"John!"
"This summer. You'll be there, won't you?"
Running his fingers over his chest, he revelled in the warmth he thought he'd never feel again.
"I know. But you don't
"Of course not. Why should I need to use threats against you?"
I do. Otherwise I..."
"John, I–"
"John. I think we should go on dates more often."
, he admits to himself. However it isn't. Bitter, maybe, and even a little sardonic, but not really painful. As he walks down the street he ponders the thought for a while, wondering why being alone at 40 without a wife or kids when that's what he always thought he'd have for a life does not hurt as much as it should. Perhaps because the fault lies with him, and him alone: after all, he is too twisted and
John looked up and fixed his gaze on him.
"Yes. Sorry. Lost in thoughts."
"Us!" she exclaims.
And so John had come. He'd seen the empty flat and he couldn't bear it. The silence. The cold that had settled in even though it was only mid-September. The tidiness.
"A shot, then a cry? When you shoot someone, it's usually the other way around."
He glanced at his phone. Sherlock hadn't answered. Had John misunderstood?
A graveyard in the Czech Republic.
was sincere. This was perfect. Sherlock wasn't an Angel after all. He wasn't ordinary. He was just like him. He'd take his place in the centre of the web, and that would be his trial.
She laughs. "Oh well."
"Say that again."
"I can't tell you much, but the head of the Baker Street irregulars is called Wiggins. Don't see him much around these days, so I don't really know where you can find him, but I guess he'd know more about him than any of us... otherwise he wouldn't be the head, would he?"
As she pours herself some coffee she thinks of John because they bought matching mugs – weird ones with cartoon chicks goggling. Mary can't remember how they ended up buying them. Well. The chicks were yellow.
, he had written on his blog. You stood a chance. But you still cursed your bloody addictive personality.
"Enough," she cut in sharply, the dominatrix back all of a sudden. "Have you turned stupid? What about John? That landlady of yours? And the cute D.I.?"
"Listen, John, I... You don't have to go anywhere."
But before he fell into a deep slumber, he added in a drowsy whisper:
Great. Now the doctor's state is even worse. If he had been in shock previously, now...
The only woman in his life. As if that held any significance. Her gaze drifted to the vase where she had put the one red rose he had brought her today. One and only one magnificent crimson rose, like he often did.
"Sherlock. Let's sit down. Come here," he said firmly, bringing him to the couch. He didn't dare be too gentle, seeing how Sherlock had reacted just before turning mute.
He fell silent. Stopped fumbling, shut his mouth.
They keep talking as if you weren't even there. They act like they've always known each other. Their gestures are coordinated like those of people who spend most of their time together. You open your mouth, try to utter something coherent. Something that makes sense.
Sherlock. And apparently sent him into a state of shock. John groaned as he pocketed the change and got out of the cab. Sherlock was waiting for him by the front door, still looking floored. Still looking handsome and irrationally eatable. They climbed the creaking stairs in silence. When they got into the flat, Sherlock was still in a daze. John closed the door behind them, and coughed a little.
hair, of course) the last time there had been a transformation, but had found nothing peculiar. It was just like any other manul's hair on earth. Except that this manul was host to a human being – in this case, John.
"Can't I enjoy a good drink once in a while?"
"Are you sure you didn't get concussed?" he asked half-jokingly, wondering how in the world Sherlock could've thought for one moment that John of all people would ask him to turn away from danger.
Your head is spinning.
The pain and hopelessness he'd been trapped in during the following weeks had somewhat protected Greg from the chaos that ensued, making him numb and indifferent to everything that happened to him. Everything was getting out of control. They said he was in shock and tried to put him away, and next they were calling him back to interrogate him and ask him about Sherlock's involvement in the affairs of the police, and Greg would go mad and shout and scream Sherlock's innocence as if it mattered now. Then they'd put him away again. And call him back. It was a mess. The Met was a mess and the newspapers were spouting nonsense and Greg was craving justice so bad it was painful: why couldn't anyone see the only murderer around was him? He'd wondered why he hadn't heard of Mycroft. The elder Holmes was his last hope. Surely he wouldn't allow this.
It was bloody unfair. It was unfair that Sherlock got to be a genius
"Of course not. You didn't say it to the D.I., but to the friend, right?"
John was so shocked to hear Sherlock say "I'm going to bed" that he let him push him back gently and escape the embrace.
Harry sighs, and shakes her head.
"Nothing," he replied.
"Let's go to your place, Ron, we'll talk there. I'll tell you everything but we cannot stay here. Please. You've got to trust me." He looked him in the eye as he said this, and grabbing his arm, squeezed lightly. Ron took a deep breath.
The flash of hurt in Sherlock's eyes, very similar to the one John had seen when they were in Sebastian Wilkes's office, made the guilt unbearable.
At this, John stared at Sherlock.
But she has already hung up. You groan. This is going to be awkward.
Sherlock wanted to shout back. That meant, however, that John would keep playing with his face, while he was engraving the concerto in his skin and soul all over again. Sherlock was at a complete loss as to what to do. A flash of confusion traversed his gaze and he simply said:
"You seem very angry to me."
was surprised by the offer. It was the first time Sherlock had asked him what he felt like doing. Even before they'd started having sex, never had the consulting detective shown any interest in such things. During the past week, he had initiated boldly, had complied, had let himself be touched, had deduced John's kinks – but he had never asked, before they started any of their activites, what John had felt like doing. It gave the doctor a strange feeling in his chest.
For now, he just enjoys the cold season. He finds he likes it all the more so as the days are getting shorter – not that he prefers the nights. But he is glad his evenings do not drag on so much as before, because he can reduce the number of newspapers he buys.
"What are you apologising for?"
"John..."
"Why, I told you to meet me in this restaurant. Wouldn't it be rude for me not to show up?"
Moran had to repress a chuckle. He blew some smoke instead, before replying off-handedly:
(in fact, Molly didn't, because she couldn't read Latin and didn't care much for regimental mottoes)
Sherlock shrugged.
Sherlock's eyes widened, and he chuckled, giving John a peck on the cheek. The smaller man frowned.
"I wrote it in their code, of course. The dancing smileys."
You ignore him and rip your shirt. "Here. We've got to stop the bleeding."
"I don't need to hear him say it," John rephrased coldly.
"Let's go to your sitting-room then."
You shake your head, taking your jacket off.
Sherlock scoffed.
"No... please... stop this... please... AAAAAAAAAAAH!"
, he mused in all seriousness,
of your fantasies, John."
Hearing the doorbell, she paused abruptly and went to open the door.
The ride to the family farm was quiet and a bit awkward. Sherlock had sat in front next to the driver and John felt a little shunted aside.
John obeyed happily. He'd learned to always have candles in the house, especially in one where a torch would most likely end up in pieces for Sherlock to play with. John liked candles better anyway, in the event of a power cut. That was something he got from his childhood. Whenever there was a power cut that could not be fixed within the house and when it lasted more than a few minutes, his mother would get the candles and tell them stories. Or they would just end up chatting in the dining-room. Absentmindedly, John wondered whether Harry had taken up the same habit.
"Did you see Gus?" a male voice asked.
They exchanged an amused, knowing look.
"You wouldn't leave," Sherlock repeated in a barely audible whisper.
No, I–"
He walked to get his phone but suddenly the tiger was on him and he fell onto his back. On edge, John ignored the paws digging into his shoulders and held the tiger at gunpoint. Their eyes locked, and John wavered: the feline's were filled with fear and
"What a bore," Sherlock complained as he joined Moran in the car.
"I might ask you the same thing."
"That is not what I was going to say! Will you let me finish? My past experiences were... yes, well, numerous if you want, but I think I've given enough proof that Sherlock always comes first."
‘What? But…’
"Henry's therapist is related to Ms. Whittaker's new companion?"
"I feed upon it and extinguish it"
Molly laughed softly as she tightened the sulking man's tie.
Speechless, John fell back into a chair.
"Well I can show you the mortuary," Molly offered. There was an awkward silence. Shinwell chuckled and kissed her.
"Sherlock–"
"John... please touch me too."
"Please. It's classy, John."
"I feed upon it and extinguish it"
John goggled.
"Tossed by the waves but not sinking" (random fact: this is the motto of the city of Paris in France)
"It is your dream after all."
After that, things progressed quickly. Soon the news – and definite evidence – of Sherlock's innocence was out in the papers. Greg gave interviews, contacted the 'I believe in Sherlock Holmes' movement, and invited former clients of Sherlock's to speak up.
doing here?"
And hens took snuff to make them tough,
"Sherlock? Are you all right?"
"Sherlock."
"You kept the mug I used."
"What is this?" she asked, sitting back in her chair and giving an inquisitive look at the man across from her.
But there were still so many ways things could go wrong! Sherlock could suddenly feel vulnerable and exposed and throw John out – oh, she knew he wasn't above that 'I-love-him-so-I-can't-see-him-anymore' crap (even if the Sherlockian version would probably be something like 'Your-mere-presence-hinders-the-Work-and-only-brings-trouble-so-get-out'). John could do something ridiculous too if he didn't get over his sexuality issues before he entered his midlife crisis and ran away to marry some woman and have two kids and a dog in a cottage. But all in all, Molly trusted the pair to figure something out on their own. She wasn't close enough to them to give her thoughts on the subject anyway – she didn't matter. If worse came to worst, though, she would certainly try her best to patch things up. Who knew what Sherlock would do to cope if they ever had a row and John left for good? He hadn't touched cocaine once since the doctor had entered his life, of that she was certain, and he was even trying to stop smoking. Admittedly he had decided that before he even met John – Lestrade had made sure of it – but Molly knew the detective would've eventually got bored, and then he wouldn't have had a reason to not give into temptation. With John by his side, he had a good enough one. She smiled.
"You're wrong, Sherlock. I'm sure he would've rather known the truth, and was grateful that you proved his father was murdered."
"I know you find it ugly, John, but I wouldn't want to soil it."
"Please have a seat," Sherlock told her, since John appeared to be petrified. "I just ordered Chinese, I hope that'll suit your taste."
Mrs. Watson wasn't exactly how he expected her to be. But she sure is lively. Too lively. There's a sadness in her eyes which makes Sherlock awkward.
"Yes... Yes. You're right. I'm being an asshole. But then again you're being stupid! Just release me now!"
At first, guess what, he hadn't wanted to believe it. That Sherlock was dead. It just wasn't an option. It didn't make sense and it was unfair and... Then he'd seen Molly. She'd shaken her head. Greg had felt his legs give out. He'd sat there in the mortuary, dumbstruck. He'd asked to see him. She'd said he was gone already. His brother had taken him to be buried. Lestrade had thought he would throw up then and there.
"Who cares?"
‘Those black circles around your eyes, that fluffy tail! Such a divine creature! And so tame, too!’
"I wanted to take Moriarty out of my grave."
"The pleasure is mine, Mr... ?"
"What are you... John!"
She frowned.
"Let me finish. When I asked you if we could... Well, if I could experiment a bit with you, I..." He took a deep breath. "I hadn't realized you were..." He stopped.
No duplicate whatsoever.
"No, listen! I was talking as your doctor, not as your..."
"Oh dear God what's a tiger doing roaming around in your flat!?"
. "We", he'd said, not "You".
have a jam kink by the way... far from it xD But I think anything could be turned into a kink with those boys. Hope you enjoy reading ;)
the next morning.
"Daniel, eat your vegetables."
"John is alive, Sherlock. You are alive. I'll let you draw the conclusion yourself."
Jim admires Sherlock's acting for a while – his heavy breathing, the horror dawning on his face. The distress.
"Gay?" the detective finished for her, smiling a little too perfunctorily.
"You really need to be given a spanking."
‘I have to trust you,’ Sherlock said quietly.
Sherlock blinked, trying but failing to make sense of this non sequitur. He arched an eyebrow, and John felt very silly.
But it is. I've always been able to keep my distance."
That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done. - And you invaded Afghanistan. - That wasn't just me. - Why aren't we back at the restaurant? - They can keep an eye out. It was a long shot anyway; - So what were we doing there? - Oh, just passing the time. And proving a point. - What point? - You. Mrs Hudson! Dr. Watson will take the room upstairs. - Says who? - Says the man at the door.
"Yes?"
have this kind of relationship with him?"
"Yes."
"And you must be Mr. Stamford!"
"Why does it matter? He's dead." You loath the quiver in your voice.
He winked, not so discreetly, and John had to stop himself from rolling his eyes. Sherlock on the other hand seemed suddenly rather nervous – to the doctor, at least. He wondered if that was part of the act, but wasn't so sure... In any case, John was pretty enthusiastic and nodded.
It was such a blatant lie he would've laughed, had he not felt so queasy. He wondered briefly what a laughing manul would sound like. They both knew he hadn't eaten today and his stomach was certainly empty now, so he obviously wouldn't be sick again. John allowed himself to relax in the embrace, a smile on his feline face. Maybe Sherlock too had been wanting to cuddle all along. Somehow they always managed to end up like this, exhausted and snuggling until they both fell asleep.
Those were the fallen angels who
Suddenly, he realized he'd been silent for
"He wasn't moving!"
"Don't... you don't have to do this..."
"I thought you'd never ask."
He was stuck on a train with a tiger, and supposed to get off at Victoria station in less than ten minutes.
"Did you think I needed you to do something like that to know that I was a man and not a dog?" he tried to ask playfully, failing miserably. Then, since his friend was not responding: "Sherlock, please talk to me."
"I did not," Sherlock retorted, as if the thought were absurd. John could think of many occurrences when he had lacked at least as much tact, but kept quiet. He was enjoying listening to his friend, and was starting to feel cozier than before. Less aroused, more comfortable.
He can feel a hand on his right one, holding it, and he presses back into thin air.
"Would it help if I talked to you?"
here," he answered mockingly, a tinge of scorn in his voice. Sherlock smiled sweetly.
"Which one? What do you mean?"
"I am not 'in need'."
Sherlock rolled onto the side and sighed in annoyance. This strangely felt like the days he had spent in Molly's flat at the beginning of all this trial. He was lying motionless on the sofa bed in the flat across 221B Baker Street, staring at the ceiling and thinking. But he wasn't bored. He couldn't figure out what Moran had in store, and it was driving him crazy.
As he walks away briskly, he forgets all about the paper he intended to buy, and doesn't notice the front page displayed on the kiosk:
John was too far gone to even register the affectionately mocking tone.
Her flat is lovely. Small, but very bright, oriented south. The decoration is cheerful and homely, pleasant in its simplicity, but you have time to catch a glimpse of the mess in her room before she closes the door hurriedly. You smile.
Right. Only 18 months.
"So... Here is the information you asked," she said, sliding a phone on the table – the same model Sherlock had kept years ago, although it was empty. This one wasn't. "I suppose it'll come in handy to blackmail him."
Growing more breathless with each note stroked on his spine, John was now swaying his body frenetically, wriggling his pelvis, legs clenched around the chair so the rocking wouldn't make it fall and send them to the ground (because regardless of his overwhelming fear, beyond a certain point he knew he just couldn't be accountable for his actions). He let himself move to the music that was being ingrained on his very skin, setting him on fire. They were dancing like flames on oil.
he was probably too busy with his silly blog and whatever other hopelessly mindless entertainment he had at hand. Sherlock wondered absent-mindedly what title he'd give that case. The Poisoned Slipper, perhaps?
Now, that wasn't something John felt very inclined to do. At all. He groped for something to grab and stroke and possibly kiss, hoping to convince Sherlock that getting up wasn't necessary. Not just yet. His hand met silky curls and he smiled. He brought Sherlock's head closer to his and caressed his hair down to his ear, massaging the soft skin behind it, continuing down to the nape of his neck – and pressed a kiss to what was probably his chin. John heard a groan.
"You were complaining about being bored just this morning!"
She starts stroking the back of your hand soothingly.
"Ooh, touchy," Moran said with a grin. "Still scared of sex, are we?"
"You won't shoot, Sherlock, because you have no idea what will happen to John Watson if you do."
"What does my scarf–"
"Are you anything else to him?"
"I guess we're just a bit weird, my husband and I," she explained with a smile.
"Mary, we're officially married. We haven't even asked for a divorce yet. Do you think it'd be good for us, for Blake, if some journalist wrote something about my undying love for Sherlock Holmes?"
"Yes."
Gun? "What? No!" Did you just say that out loud? Yes, apparently. "Don't," you babble, panic rising in your chest again, because you don't know what's happening, you have no idea what's happening, it doesn't make any sense, doesn't make any sense at all, but something
"But–"
?" Seb arched an eyebrow. "
"Indeed! A novelist, how interesting! My wife loves detective novels. Perhaps she has even read some of yours! At any rate, I am sure she would be delighted to talk with you. If you have time, of course," he added quickly, seeing the icy look Sherlock was giving him. "She is resting at the moment, anyway. It was very good to meet you, gentlemen, but I must go. I am sure I will see you around. Mr. Trevor."
"Mr. Ambassador!"
"I'm really glad you could recommend something! Harry'll be very happy. You're free on Thrusday night of course?"
"No.  What I'm saying is that in the span of just one year or so, he changed  his mind and now deems you're worth the trouble. And that's the only  love confession you can expect from him, I'm afraid."
"I have my mobile, if you need anything."
Are you poison?
"Hey. You all right? Would you like some water?"
"Seb, please, just drop the gun."
John froze.
Sherlock did not ask why; but he stopped complaining about the cold. After a while, John started worrying about the silence. He washed and dried his face with a towel before coming to sit on the rim of the bathtub.
John writhes under the whip. Sherlock retches. Sebastian keeps smoking, aloof. Moriarty grins.
[1] Actually, this is a quote from Arthur Conan Doyle, in Sherlock Holmes, 'The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter'
Mycroft was right too when he'd said that John must have enjoyed feeling needed and in charge. He'd enjoyed it. Even worse, he

In a flash you close the door in his face, swoop down on the bed, take the shirt out, push the crib into the corner, open the door.
theory. Naturally, John didn't even want to contemplate that he might have fallen already.
"Sherlock is dead. There's no reason anyone would want to target us. Maybe I'm just imagining things and panicking for nothing, but... You know. Old habits die hard."
If he hadn't known better, John would have said the giant cat glared at him – but it was a
"All right. Close you eyes. I don't want you to open them until we're done."
John blinked.
"You're talking about Mycroft's DVDs. What did you see?"
"He's dead."
"Whose side exactly are you on, Moran?"
"What?! That's so mean, Sherlock!"
"Don't you want to know, Sherlock? Or is it that you just refuse to acknowledge it?"
"Mm? What, no, of course not, dear."
"By the way, John, I'm finally done reading all of your blog," Seb said. "It's brilliant stuff!"
"You weren't where I wanted you to be when I wanted you to be there."
"Mary–"
"I'll give you some friendly piece of advice, Miss Hooper," Mycroft said, walking to the door and thus showing the conversation was over, "Do not worry yourself so much over my little brother. You are a beautiful young woman, and I'm sure you have better things to do than..."
Then in a graver tone:
"Don't want to."
"What is
"But I never said anything about Sherlock!"
"To the Hotel Cosmopolitan," he announced.
The words spoken by the clergyman are from Roman 6:3-9. I haven't had time to reply individually to your reviews yet, but now that I am done with this chapter, I will! Many thanks to all of you, you know how much I appreciate it :) Only 8 more chapters to go...
"John. I said
Yet again: silence.
. - All right, I'll find you. Keep talking. - I can't. It'll hear me. -
John bends and shakes his extended hand. He's surprised to see how strong the man truly is – he certainly doesn't look it, but it is quite obvious from his grip that he is very well-build.
Sherlock didn't flinch at the words, and John knew he'd been right to be straightforward. No word should become taboo.
You rub your thumb against Sherlock's palm. He shivers. Mrs. Hudson comes back with a glass and hands it to him.
He sighs dramatically and aims your gun at you. Your own gun. You look at it, then at Seb, then at the gun again.
"What are you doing?" John asks quietly. He steps back to look at you.
"Well, that is for us to find out, isn't it?"
letters and numbers?"
'That's another story,' said he; 'jump up and ride with me.'
You're glad when finally the cab stops in front of the door and you can get out – too many cabs for one day, too many things to deal with all at once. You look up and see the lights aren't on in the flat. Mary must already be sleeping. You turn to Sherlock to tell him you'll have to be quiet, but can't say anything when you see him. Sherlock. He's alive. Sherlock is alive. Your right hand starts trembling and you turn abruptly to the door, open it for him, wait until he goes in. You cannot take your eyes off him for more than three seconds. You counted.
"Poor bloke. He got completely framed."
"Did you forget why Moriarty wanted you to be present? Did you forget what he said when I..." he gulped, closed his eyes, and reopened them with determination as he finished: "... as I came?"
árka took a paper out of her bag, and passed it on to you. Even in the dim-lit theatre, you could see it was a picture of your gravestone painted red.
Take my hand. - Now people will
Sherlock blinked.
"You just stiffened. What's troubling you?"
This was in Moriarty's handwriting.
Sherlock glared. He hadn't forgiven the doctor for abandoning him yet, especially for a woman he'd met not even a month before. John petted him between the ears in an attempt to assuage him, but Sherlock turned away sullenly. John shrugged briefly, regretting the loss of contact, before continuing:
"That's stupid," Sherlock grumbles. Mary scowls at him. "Just play with your teddy bears and leave the stars alone."
You start to count in your mind.
He sounds rather comatose, but shifts a little restlessly on the bed. Yes. Definitely heroin.
"Do you have any idea how hard it was for all of us? Did you even think about what we would go through? About what
"And I like the power it gives me over you. Of course you have the same over me, but it's not a problem. I like touching you, and I like you touching me. Reducing you to a writhing mess and seeing that
"... What?"
"Is there something you'd like to tell me?"
"You're skipping notes."
Sherlock could not longer take it and leant in for a sensuous kiss. He wished everything wasn't so complicated; wished he could just touch John without having to worry about him leaving or his own body being disgusting, wished John could touch him without wondering if he was not a monster taking advantage of the detective's weakness. For once, Sherlock wished they could just both stop thinking, because it did not lead anywhere: he wasn't used to thinking not leading anywhere. So he simply deepened the kiss gradually until he felt John melt under him, and melted himself.
"That's why we're kinda similar, you and I. We both get off on murders."
Sherlock does not answer. You turn to him again. "So?"
"Only in certain rooms. The games parlor and casino, the dining room, the main hall... We do not have any in the rooms or the floors, if that's what you are asking."
"Who did you write to?" Sherlock asked in a small voice.
"Can't you just be quiet, for once?
"Well, sorry for not being a genius who can tell the whole past of someone from their tan and wristwatch! I have other interests, you see? Interests that imply an actual interaction with people, and not just analysing them as if they were things."
John realized. "I don't know, do you eat there when you go?"
"Where are you going? You haven't even had breakfast! You always want breakfast."
John had resumed rolling his hips and then moved them from side to side, holding the cane horizontally in front of him, arms stretched. He knew that Sherlock wasn't confident about this at all, because he saw 'sentiments' as something messy and risky, always leading to much trouble (such as murder, but that could be fun – usually, it was just both painful and boring, the worst combination ever). Hence the running away behind the handy mask of 'sociopath' and psychopath and so on. John shook his head imperceptibly and put his hands up in the air, crossing his wrists, all the while holding on to the cane, then spun it above his head.
His deep voice made John shiver and his pelvis bucked of its own accord, pressing his crotch to the other man's thigh. Sherlock chuckled in his hair, kissing the top of his head and nuzzling as he caressed his back and buttocks, eliciting very effective moans from the ex-soldier. Sherlock leant in until his mouth was but an inch away from his friend's ear and whispered:
«(o.o)»
"It's a blue gem she was particularly fond of," Lestrade went on. "We've been looking for it for two days – to no avail. I was hoping Sherlock would help, even if there hasn't been a murder."
And the betrayal.
"Ah. Don't feel much."
"John..."
"No it
"Consulting criminal."
"You can't live with me anymore. It doesn't make sense. You don't need to live with me anymore."
Fortunately, Sherlock was not as foolish as he sometimes sounded lately. Irene smiled as her eyes fell on the figure of the small, crooked man who was scurrying about the room, paying little attention to her presence and rubbing his white beard nervously.
. Picking all the crumpled balls, he goes to the kitchen, burns them with the matches he uses for the gas, and throws away the ashes.
Mycroft arched an eyebrow. "Why not?"
"I heard him scream! I thought something had happened, but-"
"You... would never have sex with me," you let out, breathless.

His flatmate froze, so shocked he didn't even have the reaction to jump back. At this very instant, the door was slid open, and the noise snapped John back to reality. He jolted, turned crimson, and looked up to the silhouette of the man who had just entered.
, it wasn't. And that was the problem. John wasn't logical at all. He wanted the thrill and needed Sherlock for that, fine. But he was also a very,
"Oh, you're being so difficult, I should just take you here and now."
"It may startle people, and someone could steal you," Sherlock went on.
John blinked.
Ygnar spoke as if he owned the place. He almost did, after all - he put so much money into it. The barman smiled back knowingly and complied.
She shrugs and sips her cocktail with a pout (for some absurd reason you're pleased to see she isn't as pretty when she pulls a face – when you realize
"What is it?"
"No, it's a crystal ball you're holding."
"Obvious to anyone who knows him," Sherlock countered.
They were both so intensely focused on the other that they didn't hear the staircase steps creak until the very last moment. John's eyes widened in panic and he jumped to his feet, ushering Sherlock into the corridor towards his room, hissing: "
John had in fact no idea what the man would've wanted or not, but right now, it didn't matter. He kept his hand on Sherlock's arm a while longer, then retreated. A more peaceful silence settled, and eventually, John fell asleep.
"Broken? What do you mean broken?"
She nuzzles up closer and you can feel her smile against the crook of your neck.
"What do you mean?"
For the better or for the worse, they were going to Singapore.
Other than that, there wasn't much in the sniper's flat. Maps of London, and then a series of decorative books or magazines, just there to give a semblance of life to the rooms. To give the impression that it was inhabited. There was always food in the fridge. Name cards – mostly women's – scattered around for everyone to see, or inside a slightly open drawer. Train or plane tickets to Paris, where his latest girlfriend was supposed to be. Some DVDs. A lot of CDs. Some music he only played on his laptop, and apparently he was keen on leaving no trace of them there either.
"You're such a tosser."
Sherlock frowned.
"You'll never need to take anything ever again."
The detective smiled as he let his hand fall to John's erection. John gasped.
"I wanted to send her a message."
; the desirable middle between two extremes, one of excess and the other of deficiency.
"I'm here, Sherlock. I'm right here."
"Oh shut up, I know you're not even attracted to men."
"Have you now?" she replied, uncertainty in her voice.
"You...!
"And the police believes Henry is the culprit because it all seemed so 'crazy', right? The way it was done. The notes. The bomb."
You'll have to keep looking at me. Here."
"Look, John. I know you can't properly
"Sherlock. Please come out."
"I am quite amazed with the way you are handling this."
'Cause we're birds of a feather
Consequently, it was stark naked that Sherlock stepped out of the room and down the hall. The day was still young but the grey lights of morning were already casting shadows in the kitchen when Sherlock walked through it and into the living-room.
You roll your eyes, fairly amused.
John just gave him a look. Victor laughed.
Irene wondered.
"Time?"
"What–"
"Yes, I did have one. In university."
Sherlock panicked and before he could think twice about it he jumped on John and made him fall onto his back.
They fell silent. Sherlock was hoping it would remain like this for the rest of the ride, but unfortunately Sebastian just couldn't shut up for more than ten minutes. And that was his record.
She wished she'd met the man, wished she'd seen them together. She'd only pictured him through John's blog, seen him in newspapers, on his website, too... God, she hadn't grasped
...some willing participants.
Which came out as... well, a hiss. He moaned in despair.
"Well, that's quite an answer," Sherlock commented gloomily.
"A coffee, please. Black, two sugars."
"The thing you really wanted from Mycroft!"
Sherlock was completely unfazed. "Sure. If you want to."
"It smells very good here. Have you baked something?"
Except with drugs. Drugs had been salutary. At an age when any healthy young man chases after girls and drinks on bad days (and even on good ones), Sherlock could find nothing to ease the boredom. Nothing to fascinate him, nothing to attract him and stir life in his body. People were boring and stupid. The world was dull and absurd. Even when there was something interesting going on, nobody listened to him. So he started telling what he knew would trigger a reaction from people. He started deducing them and spouting it into their faces. Everyone was so selfish. He thought they'd be interested in what he said, since it was about themselves.
He hangs up before you can add anything.
to lie: to concentrate on the facts (yes the body she'd examined was definitely dead, yes its DNA matched Sherlock's, etc.), which were all true according to the records, and find excuses for any lack of data. Of course Mycroft would find out eventually – because Sherlock didn't intend to remain hidden forever. But it was crucial that he'd notice something was wrong only after his younger brother had left the country for good. Well, that was what Sherlock had told her any way, and Molly didn't want to question him any further. She said she'd help, and she would. It didn't matter if for some reason the detective had to lie to her too.
purple shirt."
The elder Holmes' face darkened. As always, Sherlock had reacted excessively. He'd faked his own death, and he probably didn't have much choice for that matter. But then he'd disappeared from the surface of the earth for months, to the point where even Mycroft wondered if he wasn't truly dead. Retrospectively, of course he'd been doing it on purpose. Sherlock knew Mycroft cared, but he hated the perversion of it all.
“Oh, come on, please?”
“Should I come? I mean, if I can take Rosie…” The girl in question is currently happily sucking on her fist - not exactly suited for a high end, all male, silence only club.
"That is the most ridiculous plan I have ever heard."
He opens his eyes.
"I had a hunch. Besides, portraits are very useful assets when dealing with reckless young students."
Sherlock scoffs. “Unimportant.”
They eventually arrived at the tower and looked over the lake. Sure enough, flying above them and due to land soon, was a carriage, silhouetted by the orange sunset, flown by multiple flying horses. Because, what other way is there to travel an entire school to another country?
(Also, helping detective? I'm disappointed that could even cross your mind. I had much higher expectations of your intelligence, John Watson.)
When John comes to he’s in bed, the blankets pulled up to his shoulders and there is someone sitting beside him, running long fingers through his hair, in the time that Sherlock had been gone it had grown another few centimeters. John keeps his eyes closed but takes a deep breath in through his nose. It smells of Sherlock, slightly duller with other scents overlaying; a bit of antiseptic and the iron tang of blood mixed in, but Sherlock none the less. John lets his eyes flutter open, his vision is slightly blurry for a moment but then his gaze zeroes in on the face to the right of him and his stomach swoops despite him knowing very well who was sitting next to him. He’s still very angry he realizes, but for the sake of making sure he’s not dreaming or dead or under some type of spell, he puts it on the back burner and just decides to be relieved.
Ah, yes right, now John remembered. “Yes, sorry, yes, Mike, hello.” John shook Mike’s hand, looking around briefly as he did so, his light paranoia had him checking his surroundings constantly. But his pause must have been longer than was polite because Mike let out a chuckle.
When she gets home she finds him crumpled on the ground, blood caked to his face and looking deathly pale. She sees the hair on the ground that must be his, but his hair is as long as it had been when she had seen him off to school earlier. She realizes that he must have tried to cut it, but doesn't understand because it can't be cut, she has tried, it didn't work, but the evidence is spread out around her son like a golden corona. John's mother resolves to ask him about it later, right now she needs to get him up and clean and make sure he's still okay. When John finally comes around two hours later, his mum and dad are sitting at the end of his bed speaking in quiet tones to one another. He shifts feeling like he got hit by a truck then stills.
“Ah, Molly! Coffee, thank you.” He glances at her as he takes the cup, and frowns slightly. “What happened to the lipstick?”
When John enlists, he had not expected to actually ever see the battlefield, sure he had enlisted as a soldier and not a medic, but he never imagined he would be shipped off to the front lines, though maybe he should have. He sees more of it than he ever wanted to if he was being honest with himself. But this was his calling, and being Fae like he was meant that he was slightly more resilient than the average human. And for all those that doubted his capabilities because he was short, well he shut them right up by excelling in everything he applied himself to and thus quickly rising through the ranks. Life was as good as he could get it while in a warzone. That all changed however when he got shot.
Long day indeed.
But John, it was like nothing had happened, he was not in shock, nor was he angry anymore, nor was he still grieving. It was the same, the exact same way it had been before Sherlock had gone. Not forced casualness which he had almost suspected from John. No, it would have been better had Sherlock thought the calm John had was forced, but it was as easy and natural as ever. But Sherlock felt like there was something beneath the surface of this peace and normalcy, something dark that would bite and claw and maim if Sherlock looked too closely at it. However, Sherlock had the sneaking suspicion that whatever was hiding would soon be thrust into the light of day, that it would tear whatever fragile reality he was living in to shreds.
Things weren’t supposed to be this easy right? Sherlock had expected the anger that had come after John had first seen him, even the sadness and grief while he was gone, but it felt like the last two years hadn’t happened between them.
Something obviously had to be wrong, but what Sherlock didn’t know.
Mike shakes his head, “Not a word.” John shifts nervously then. So Mike didn’t say anything, but this person knows about him regardless and all his alarm bells are starting to go off one by one.  John assumes that Mike wouldn’t introduce him to someone who’s crazy, or a killer, or anything of that sort, but honestly he doesn’t like this at all.
“Got my eye on a nice little place in Central London. Together we ought to be able to afford it.” Curly starts heading towards the door as he continues. “We’ll meet there tomorrow at seven o’clock. Sorry, got to dash. I think I forgot my riding crop in the mortuary.” His hand is on the door when John speaks.
Too late.
The stranger looked surprised for a moment, “Oh, thank you.”
Sherlock was never known for bouts of sentimentality or poeticism, but it was at that moment Sherlock decided John would be his, though this was a subconscious thought and it wouldn’t be until the Hound that Sherlock acknowledged his love for John as what it is, and it wouldn’t be until the Fall that Sherlock would prove his love for John, but he knew deep down that he couldn’t, wouldn’t let John go.
One last quick note, I obviously wasn't paying attention when I decided on the schedule for this, so I'm moving the day for updates from Friday to Monday.
The mattress John could feel on the back of his legs seemed like a blessing at that moment, so he decided to make this a little more comfortable for the both of them and sat down, pulling Sherlock with him. Sherlock knelt down between John’s legs, arms still around the shorter man’s waist and buried his face in John’s chest instead, rubbing into him not unlike a cat. They stayed like that, both losing track of time as they breathed one another in.
John rolled his eyes again, huffing as the stranger almost seemed to deflate in disappointment, even if just a little. “Uh, here, use mine.”
“I got shot.” John deadpanned and watched as Mike’s smile fell in realization, and possible horror. John decided it was going to be a long day.
his paranoia whispers.
Hello all, I hope you've enjoyed this chapter, and I'll see you guys again after the new year!
It was the biggest mistake he had ever made in his short twelve years of life, but even after he was older he still thinks it ranks in the top five.
He continued on in this process for almost another week before Lestrade came by. John had spoken to the man briefly, apparently Sarah had been concerned and called the police to make sure John was okay. But he wasn’t, and he wouldn’t ever be now. Lestrade gave his very heartfelt condolences, before saying that he would talk to John later and leaving.
“Of course I do. Keep going, though. It’s not going to blow itself, you know.”
"To be fair, the last guy who died was a Hufflepuff."
Madam Maxime laughed, a high pitched "ha!" which John swore made the lake ripple slightly. "Indeed. Are ze Durmstrags 'ere?"
“Yeah. That bullet did a lot of damage to your respiratory system. Incapacitated you for months.” John swallows down his guilt rising in him like nausea, taking a steadying breath as he avoids Sherlock’s gaze. “God, the more I think about it, the more I think… how could I have ever gone back? Even for a little while?”
He's distinctly aware of two gunshots that go off, and the fact that there are three guns in the room.
“I’m fine. I just wanted to see your face. That’s all.”
The cab stops and they quickly jump out. Before they enter the door to the Diogenes Club, Sherlock pauses and says, averting his eyes to the pavement, “by the way, John. I think, with you moved back in and Rosie there, Baker Street will feel more like home than it has done in months.”
"You're due a job at the ministry soon, aren't you? A good one at that. Powerful."
Dinner is anything but dull.
Don't worry about not getting back to me quickly. I'm glad you're home safe.
“Sherlock!”
She continues, determined, “Yeah, no one there ever really… socialised. I love going out for drinks.”
Mrs Hudson ignores his protests and opens the door wider. "Oh, come in, you must be freezing! Don't mind my chatter. Come in, come in." She gently ushers John in as he wearily smiles in greeting at Sherlock, who immediately turned around and rushed up the stairs dismissively. Trying not to feel offended, John follows behind, conscious of the heavy fall of his limp on each step. Sherlock opens the door for him at the top.
"Like Voldemort?"
“Good.”
Sherlock blinked for a moment or two, processing the request. “What?”
Sherlock reaches into his coat pocket and brings out an opened brown envelope. He hands it over to Mary, who removes the contents, flipping through them quickly, eyes scanning, a line between her eyebrows in concentration. “Photographs?” John asks.
Sherlock grinds his teeth. “Impossible. We can't - she can't know we're here. This is our only advantage against her. It doesn't make sense. Why? Why would she know he’d come to us?”
“SPEAK!”
"I can do that without some cult-like ritual with candles and chanting and singing or whatever."
A moment of silence, Sherlock blinking owlishly as he comprehends what John had said. "What?"
Sherlock freezes, blinking in surprise at John’s casual admission. John himself stares back, defiant, challenging, chin up, still smiling.
“Hello, John.”
John knew that Sherlock’s mother had an important job at the ministry, one that had earned the Holmes’ lots of money. But whenever he asked about it Sherlock shrugged and gave a vague answer. “She says it’s a minor position, but in essence she is the Ministry of Magic. She has access to all files, all information. People go to her for help. She’s a polymath.” After a few years of asking, John gave up.
John and Sherlock leant back against the wall, breathless and laughing and full of adrenaline after running from Angelo’s through London to chase after a cab that had turned out to be the wrong one, the passenger being a confused American tourist as opposed to a cunning serial killer.
“You have anything?”
“On the contrary, I can’t think of a better way to celebrate our reunion.”
They walk over to the table, away from John's friends. As John gets out the plastic cups and fills them with drinks, Sherlock asks quietly, his eyes fixed on the vast array of drink options. "how did I do?"
The next second is a blur that John will struggle to remember correctly later, as he recounts the events to doctors, to Salzburg police, then to Scotland Yard.
"Besides, he did tell you."
At that point, a large case embellished in gold and silver was placed next to Mcgonagall. Dull theatrics.
"Yeah, I guessed it wouldn't. Well, what normally helps? When you're upset."
"Perfect."
'John, you truly spoil me.'
"A case?"
“Like what?”
"What a shame."
"Hey. What are you making?" Mary nodded towards the cauldron
John opened his mouth to respond honestly, but then stops himself and exhaled softly through his nose. "It's complicated. I'll think about it. Get some sleep alright?"
"It's fine. Your friend is a doctor too, isn't he? He'll use the necessary amount of protection. At least I'd hope so. Otherwise, I'd be very concerned about the state of the NHS."
He ends up asking her out the month afterwards, when he sees her flirting with one of the male nurses and decides to break the pattern of letting second chances of happiness slip away.
And then he’d speak. All traces of femininity were officially vanquished beneath a fluent baritone. Shameless in its own right in more ways than one…
“So you want me to accompany you so I can guess the trajectory of the bullet by looking through the hole in our poor mayor’s head?”
His optimistic mind supplied helpfully.
“Be quiet! You’ll attract attention!” Hissed John, only performing a quick scan of the area after glaring at Mike in warning. They were alone as far as he could tell. Decaying brick wall, rough pavement, overflowing garbage cans and the stars acting as their only company for tonight’s peddling. “They should be here any minute now. Quit your whining.”
Sherlock’s breath hitches strangely, making John think he was going to start laughing again. Oh no--
Sherlock hissed a breath through his teeth and rose, clattering stray dishes on the table. "Fine. Just stop making that face." He stepped around John and briefly looked him over before reaching the door and debating growling at it. He resigned and swung it open in one calm, graceful motion. Although the look on his face intimated otherwise. Two young women were revealed: one startled and one resolved. The startled young woman, Sarah according to her necklace, lowered her hand slowly and suddenly became transfixed by his century old flooring. Sherlock blinked tiredly.
. John shouldn’t be so surprised, he shouldn’t be. But he still has no idea what the fuck managed to distress this clinical
—hey, mate.”
Irene just grins, ruby lips revealing sharp canines. Looking every bit the bitch she is. “How come I always find you hiding away like a little hermit?“
He just needed to clarify that he could politely return the coat and retrieve his belongings without being slaughtered. "The morgue…oh dear! Take a seat! You look like you’ve seen a ghost!" She steered his pale form to a stool before he collapsed.
He wasn't wearing any pants. John furrowed his brows. "Huh."
This was dangerous. Mycroft had told him so.
needed to stop labelling this boy as poor because he’s had a moment of weakness, John may get murdered. Sherlock would
“So, just to clarify for the sake of my delicate sensibilities,”
“Sugar-bombing?” He couldn’t have been able to suppress the tetchy indignation if he attempted. To hell with it. “You can’t just create words to fit your grammatical needs like some—some ornate deviant—“
“Hungry? It’s almost lunch in the cafeteria.” John questions, waving his wallet for emphasis. Still forcing casual just a bit. “My treat.”
It was laughable. “I’m an athlete. I eat, like, four trays. What’s the shame in one more?” John defends, amused and re-lacing up his shoe. If there was one thing he wasn’t ashamed of, it was his appetite. He needed his nutrients, lest he faint before a touchdown. Scary.
Blood splattered across the protective-glass of the soldiers mask. The soldiers wide eyes stared down at his victim in shock, arm frozen mid-air. John realized then, with dread gripping his chest in a steadily-tightening fist, that Sherlock had just spat on the feral animal above him.
Sherlock looked away from the kettle he was filling in the sink and lifted it so John could view it properly, although what he was doing was fairly obvious before and said. "Guess." John twitched while Sherlock set the kettle on the cluttered stove and walked over, having lowered the gun earlier.  "And do you normally walk away when you're being held at gun point?" John asked, cocking his head and throwing the question back at him.
Keeping his pace brisk, John made a sharp turn out of the café and towards the apartment’s front door.
Instead he hums and carefully slots the tip of his shoe through both of the bag’s handles and lifts it high enough to grab it. Somehow balancing Sherlock’s slightly slumped form and himself on a foot to avoid bending over and risking bashing Sherlock’s head into the lockers again. John had lost his appetite a while ago but the kind gesture wasn’t lost on him, if a bit unexpected. He was inordinately touched nonetheless. Sherlock exhales at the movement and grips a shoulder in turn, stands straighter, and squints before blinking. Attempting to clear his blurry gaze. John waits. Sherlock gives him an awaited nudge, and they amble.
And he had at first, quietly, as to not disturb their tolerant set-up. He read it in the way John went wary, then stiff at a strong, brazen tone that reeked of testosterone, superiority, and age as it called out with little regard to disturbing what they thought lesser folk.
Sherlock frowned at the door as the incessant knocking continued. "I have a few people in mind." He muttered through grounded teeth. "Maybe
“Obviously!” John back-peddles for the door with an awkward little jog, mind simultaneously set and a race.
He wants to drone to no one, it may have been rude but it was honest. Perhaps Sherlock was beginning to have a bit of an influence on his behavior as well. Perhaps. Point is, Sherlock absolutely loathes the cold, loathes any exercise of the sort, and has no friends. If the way Sherlock reacted to his friendship like a virgin being proposed to was anything to go by. Ergo, something’s probably wrong and John’s gonna find out what. If there isn’t and Sherlock just frowns at him, asking why he’s bothering him? Well, he’s just another hen.
"Don't."
Mycroft looked out the window of his living-room. The curtains hadn't been drawn. Tonight the moon wasn't visible.
"Be..."
John blinked.
John opened his eyes. Yes, he thought, perhaps he could understand. The feeling that you should not be wasting your time here, that you were much more needed somewhere else; that your true place was elsewhere. A very small smile graced his face, and he tried not to think how ridiculous he must have looked, being a cat. Slowly, he raised his paw and put it on Sherlock's chest.
So to keep him by your side just a little longer, you must provide him with that necessary thrill without actually endangering him. You must tolerate a certain amount of
"And? You can eat and listen to me just fine."
"Yes, I do."
They stared at each other for a moment, but the sniper's face was absolutely unreadable. Quietly ironic and derisive, this man's countenance was that of the unattached adventurer – the jaded, cynical, yet profoundly
"Well," Seb answered, ignoring the second part of Ron's words, "it was your birthday."
"You're back earlier than expected," he said with a charming smile. John was fuming.
"I don't want to."
"Of course, Harry. I'll be honoured."
, and Sherlock realized he could indeed look quite intimidating. In fact, he was more likely to beat John in a fight in this form than in his human body – well, maybe not, because John was stupid after all. But still. He held back a smirk at the thought. Actually, John had been
"Sherlock..." John groaned weakly.
But when he saw Sherlock's shattered gaze, John knew he couldn't ask this of him. Not that Sherlock wouldn't do it: he would, and then he'd be forced to watch as Sebastian put a bullet in John's head in return. John wasn't sure whether Sherlock would take less badly his flatmate being raped – this time, quite concretely – before his eyes. But if by any chance they could both make it alive out of here, John would be there to do everything in his power to convince Sherlock that he wasn't responsible, and that it was all fine.
Sherlock was dozing off already when John suddenly stretched and said.
Lestrade was sorting documents in his office, wondering when the sword of Damocles that was hanging over him would fall and cut right through him. He was expecting a call every five minutes, telling him that he was to be transferred to some God-forsaken place. So when Sergeant Donovan entered his office with a puzzled look and gave him a kraft envelope addressed to him specifically, he thought his time had come.
"You know why."
"I feed upon it and extinguish it"
"I'm sorry I shot you. What were you thinking jumping onto my bed like that?"
"You kept the mug I used."
Focusing on the clouds so as not to think too much on the tightness of his throat, Sherlock murmured:
There are so many things you never asked him. But you don't want to go there.
"But you already know that."
"Right," Mary answers most seriously.
"Wouldn't that be a problem?"
"After you died I often woke up to the sound of a violin at night," John goes on, and through your sleepiness you can still tell that now he is mostly babbling, blurting out everything that comes to mind. He too must be exhausted. Slowly, you pull him closer to you, trying to make him settle down against your body for the night. "I caught a glimpse of you in the street every day. Every time it rained, I could smell your scent – I don't know why, you never particularly smelled like rain, and it wasn't raining when you jumped. Every time I opened the door, I would expect you to rush in and act as if nothing had ever happened, as if it had all been a dream. I hated that Christmas carol you played the only time we spent Christmas together – the only Christmas we got to spend together."
"John, I'm sor-"
John smiles.
"You can picture my brother keeping an object in memory of a dead person?" he asked.
John glared. He could've punched him. Or kissed him.
"Pregnant. And getting a divorce."
, Sherlock didn’t say, and he held on tighter. He should’ve predicted that his target would escape him because he knew the city better. You didn’t need to be a genius to deduce that. But he hadn’t thought, had he? Apparently, his brain was a lot more efficient when it knew John’s whereabouts.
"Then what did you lose your time for getting kidnapped and tortured? I know you're crazy, but–"
Their gazes locked. The Woman took her time before answering:
"Indeed," Mycroft confirmed, handing John a file. He went through it quickly, his eyes widening.
Salome glared at Jude.
"Sherlock..." he warned.
"And now you miss animals."
. You curl up close to your joined hands, pressing your brow against them with a fervour you did not think yourself capable of. You must be hurting him, squeezing so tightly.
"That's not the issue."
of Moriarty's torture. He had managed to subjugate him, using John as an incentive, and had everything set in advance so that by saving the doctor's life Sherlock would actually lose him. He had done everything to save his heart, only to realize that the very process had torn it away from him. It was fine, though. It was all fine. Because really he had brought this upon himself.
The key. What did you think it was? People, Sherlock. People.
thought John.
When they finally broke away they were both panting. Sherlock's features were still stricken with fear. He rested his brow on John's. They closed their eyes as they tried to regulate their breathing. "I need a case," Sherlock murmured. "One I can... do."
You look back and meet Mycroft's gaze. The glimmer is still there. Or the glint. His expression is grave again.
"Brad and Helena moved from California eight years ago. Apparently, Brad had a hard time adapting to his new lifestyle, and started seeing a therapist."
He'd done it. He'd finally gone and done it. The first option on the 'How-can-I-cope-with-this' list.
"Right. Lovely," John comments as he turns on his laptop. "What are you even trying to make? Socks?"
"No, it wasn't."
"What?"
"Yes.
John wasn't sure whether the tiger scoffed or pouted disdainfully, but either way, it looked so silly it was actually cute.
"Is it that unpleasant?"
"I'm fine standing."
"Do you intend to never go back to London?"
having to deal with them so much, and having Sherlock acting stupid
"Are you all right, Sherlock?"
Molly gave him a pained, angry look.
"A relationship," Sherlock dead-panned.
But she was, and she was enjoying it a hell of a lot too.
"The manacles are real ones, by the way. Got them from Lestrade. There's no way you can take them off by yourself."
‘Of course, darling. I’ll make sure he stays on my side of the bed.’
Sherlock winced like a kicked puppy and fell back on the couch with a thump. John resisted the urge to smother him with kisses and drop the phone and the whole plan just to spend the rest of the day snogging him. He pressed the SEND button.
"I mean of course you weren't."
"John?"
"Why in the world?"
This time, Sherlock shook his head.
"Fine," he said, letting go of his friend's hand and standing up. Sherlock caught his wrist as he turned.
Mary snorts but cannot hide her knowing smirk.
You ignore him and walk towards the building.
Sebastian laughed.
"It's not me! I didn't steal it..."
Slowly, John moved towards the door and listened. He could hear people talk in another room, probably the kitchen as he heard the clatter of knives and forks. But they were too far away for him to make out what they were saying. He looked up to the door handle and searched the darkness of the room for some kind of furniture – a chest of drawer, a bed,
"Then what's the problem?" John asked, half-delirious already, and exhausted by the teasing.
"Meoooow!"
"I meant in London."
"Yes, Charlie, it's me. Keep looking at me, don't fall asleep. No, Charlie, look at me! Don't take your eyes off me! Will you do that for me?"
Unsurprisingly, Lestrade goggled.
John suddenly moved back and Sherlock was so puzzled he let go of him, turning a disoriented and inquisitive look towards him. John saw the panic and the fear in the fair irises, and pressed himself closer to his friend in an attempt to assuage him.
You turn to John. There's a canyon. Now it looks like a good thing. Yes, it's good. This canyon separating him from you. Makes him safe. He can't cross but that means the armed men can't cross either.
Victor grabbed his arm. Sherlock's entire body stiffened, his embrace becoming almost painful. John could've sworn that his heart skipped a beat, too. And then the blood came rushing back, crashing into John's ears as if it were his own. He was disoriented for a second, unable to conceive that this was Sherlock's
"221B Baker Street."
?" you ask before you can stop yourself.
John shook his head.
John averts his gaze and they fall silent. He's at a loss as to what he should answer. It's true he'd love to be a father, but...
"Are you all right?"
"I gave you a hand there!" Seb protested, vehement. Theatrical as ever. "Do you know she tried to off Mary Morstan? Y'know, John's wife! …Or perhaps I should've let her?"
"I just don't want to be the only one getting off on this."
"The neighbours? But they don't have a cat. Mrs. Turner's allergic."
ve been the one drinking?"
Of course he had no such luck.
"Well..."
Taking a deep breath, John crosses the threshold. Upon seeing the familiar staircase, dozens of memories hit him. He can almost see Sherlock's ghost running down the steps and dashing right through him. He closes his eyes, but then the smell overwhelms his senses – even just the staircase already smells like home. John finds his chest is filled as much with pain as with something like... love.
"Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry..."
...Are you really sleeping? Not faking it?
"Okay. Good."
Sherlock looked away. The last time Victor had said that, he had ended up throwing the money at his face and cursing him.
He heard Sherlock swallow but still didn't open his eyes, concentrating on his own body instead– the phantom pain in his leg, the burning ache in his shoulder from the scar and the injury he had suffered in the morning, his hips bucking, beating time along with his left foot still tapping on the floor, fingers running through his hair none too gently, gripping his scalp and jerking his head backward.
Walking to the kitchen, Sherlock retrieved a lighter before joining Victor by the window and lighting his cigarette for him, his timing perfect. Their movements had always been well coordinated, but Sherlock hadn't thought that even after fifteen years, it would come back to them so naturally.
"The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind."
"Meow?"
"Yes. So tell me, what do the letters look like? Ink, stationery..."
Victor and himself were seated at a table in a corner, the candles thankfully removed. Once they had ordered, Trevor noticed John's bandaged hand, and frowned.
John panicked. ‘See? I wear a belt of them! They have to be worn on the body, you know.’
He is in the sauna with Lizzie."
"Do you want to go home?" Greg asked.
John blinked.
… which was in fact the case presently.
"No," he said at last.
But people weren't interested. They got mad. At one point, he stopped counting the number of "Piss off!" Boring, boring, boring... Drugs weren't boring. They opened a whole new world of sensations and cleared his mind. He felt that his intellect could thrive that way.
This time, Sherlock realized that perhaps he was the one who really did not want to talk about this. He got the message all right, and did not need to hear John tell him that this had all been a mistake and they should stop being so intimate with each other. Sherlock did not want to hear any apology.
"So it
The ordinary people. Got to go back to playing with the ordinary people. Sherlock paled.
"It does feel like home, and I love it here. I love him. But sometimes I feel like I'm playing gooseberry."
"Don't be stupid, we both knew you would do
"Yes?"
IOU again then.
"Mm?"
At this point Sandra Barnicot simply looked exhausted. "Yes?"
"I am
"I'm not..."
"Please, won't you tell me? You know I'm stupid. I can't guess."
"To Heathrow! Drive, now!"
Sherlock swallowed, furrowing his brow in frustration at being so awkward.
John blinked and tried to make sense of what he was saying. Then it hit him, and he burst out laughing.
John blinked.
Sherlock heard a glass shatter and his nostrils filled with the smell of red wine mingled with blood.
"It's fine, now. If you want to look for another job. Maybe Mycroft can help you."
"I look like a rat when my hair is wet, it's ridiculous. You're never seeing it."
But such a job implied a lot of stress too, which made some means to relieve it necessary. Yngvar presently needed such means very much, and so he'd decided to go to the usual place. Namely, a bar. Nothing fancy, nothing bad either of course – just a nice bar in a rather infamous neighborhood, where many people went to... meet, just meet, and talk. Yngvar liked making new friends.
"There. Wait until the bathtub is filled to its 2/3 and then step in."
"Nope."
Sherlock's tone was final. John looked at him closely, and the detective felt his scrutiny like lasers roaming over his skin and burning it from the inside. It got worse when John sat at the kitchen table and did not seem ready to leave any time soon.
"You didn't let me do anything for you," he murmured. Sherlock's lips quivered, but his eyebrow twitched in annoyance.
Sherlock was enjoying every second of it, his mind never so free and quick to process information and figure things out – this was better than cocaine, more efficient than the Woman's taunting. The pleasure John gave him was so blinding it freed him from all his chains, and Sherlock could almost
Then he pushed him away.
Sherlock pouted. This was stupid. And so the two of them went to Tesco and spent an hour and a half there because Sherlock kept shaking his head at everything John showed him. He thought his friend would snap at one point and just give it up, picking whatever
... he thought.
He was just bored. And depressed, too. Although he didn't even seem to realize this, he was moping around the flat like a lost puppy. The first two days, he hadn't uttered a word and had lain motionless on the sofa, staring at the ceiling and
"You got me a client, John!" Sherlock answered gleefully as they walked up the stairs. What enthusiasm, John thought, remembering how sulky he'd been in the pub. "A client! Brilliant."
"Of course I do! I didn't show it to you so you could... Give it back. Now. We're going back."
"You said you sent him on an errand."
if you can't picture exactly what a manul is, just google it... Really, it's worth it xD
"I never thought I'd receive a phone call from you," you declare by way of greeting. Then you realize you might have sounded a little harsh, and amend: "Good morning, Mycroft."
Unwittingly, the manul sighed and snuggled up closer to Sherlock's chest. He only became aware of it when his nose collided with his friend's shirt... and scent. John closed his eyes.
Eliska did not make any comment on the ambiguity of the compliment.
, and his
"Why would you need to be roundabout?"
"Do you really think so?"
Sherlock shivered and pressed John closer to him, unintentionally rubbing their erections against each other. They gasped in unison.
Mycroft laughed.
"Oh dear."
"No, I told you, I was just walking by and–"
"A dangerous game, you say. Right, it is a dangerous game. But I'm curious Sherlock, just a teensy bit curious, so won't you tell me? In this game,
Sherlock stiffened at first, than squirmed a bit, but John remained wrapped around him and it didn't seem he felt like moving.
"What about babies?"
"You're right," John resumed, "I haven't been handling things properly. In fact, I haven't been handling them at all. But Sherlock, you've got to understand, this..." John waved his hand uncertainly. "...this is so far from anything I've known. It doesn't fall under any of the usual relationship parameters."
"God I have no idea what you're saying... aaah!"
"Yes, well, he did try to kill me. Kind of. But that's not the point."
"Don't make me laugh," Sherlock spat.
"Are you thinking of moving back in?"
Expectedly, he gets the
"All thanks to the cheesecake," Sherlock replied with a wink in Elsie's direction, and John had to slap himself mentally to prevent himself snapping at her. Instead, he rolled his eyes. Dinner was good and Sherlock had the excuse of the nausea and then the cheesecake to declare that he was full. John noted grimly that he'd only eaten a piece of cake today, and was glad he'd made him swallow the egg and bacon the previous night.
"John..."
"Where are you going? Wait!"
You check you've shaved properly this morning – although you know Mary doesn't care much about that – and, content with your appearance, leave Baker Street without turning your laptop off. You'll probably have time to work on another case tonight, after your date.
"No!" That came out louder than intended. "Don't," you say more quietly. You clench your fist on the mattress, trying to avoid trembling again. You feel very cold suddenly.
"For whom?"
"Surely you must have realized John was about to
"Right. Well, cherry is nice anyway."
can tell you. He's not forgotten you. He hasn't erased you at all. That's what
The door beeped as a card was inserted, and then it burst open. John froze. There was no time to hide. What would Irene Adler think? What—
"Hello,
"It's not sudden. I've been thinking about it for a while."
He grins up at you boyishly. "That I'm free, and interested."
"Why did you come?" he asked quietly.
"Had fun watching?"
John turned, and, seeing the falsely innocent look on Sherlock's face, exploded.
"Don't be stupid. I'm more concerned about you being seen than me."
"Anyone would be with–"
What should he do with his hair? If John met him on the street he was capable of recognizing him just from his hair. Sherlock had been told by the Irregulars on several occasions that during the past three years, it had repeatedly happened. John had run after some stranger thinking it was him. As if he had a radar.
She realizes too late that she's used the present tense, but it doesn't seem to bother John – in fact, he doesn't even seem to notice. Molly feels a pang in her chest. John is learning to live with a ghost, even though Sherlock is still alive somewhere.
. James Harvest. What a stupid name.
"Me, of course!"
She sticks her tongue at you and spreads her arms so you'll come and give her a hug. You roll your eyes, but comply nonetheless.
John sighs and groans and starts panting.
"She said she'd be waiting. I've already been foolish enough, I don't want to be a twat to boot."
As she turned a corner, Yi Ling in her hurry did not see the tall man coming her way and ran into him so forcefully she stumbled and thought she'd end up flat on her face, her packages scattered all over the place. She cried out in surprise and her eyes widened in panic at the idea of messing her mistress's belongings, but the stranger caught her in time and everything was saved. Breathless and still in shock, she let herself be brought back on her feet, stuttering apologies in Chinese before she remembered where she was, and resuming in incomprehensible Italian. The man smiled, and she found him so handsome she froze on the spot and blushed furiously. Her confusion turned into bafflement when he replied in fluent mandarin:
"Right now. You stiffened. What did I do that you didn't like?"
They enter the living-room and John takes in the warmth of their home. He doesn't even feel a twinge of sadness or envy, thinking this is something he'll never have.
"He wants me to pay £500,000 in exchange for his silence. If I don't pay him, he will make the letters public, and that would cause a terrible scandal for me – one that would lead to..." Her voice broke and she had to collect herself before finishing: "...to the cancellation of my engagement, undoubtedly." Stifling a sob, she buried her face in her hands.
. Sherlock should have been able to predict his behaviour. Worse than that, he had acted completely irrationally in the Cubitts' room – closing the door behind him, getting
you thought, only half paying attention to your hitman.
"I just need–"
"Hi!" Seb says as he comes back to the living-room and drops back onto the sofa with a thump. The old man stares.
When Sherlock heard John chuckle, he knew he'd just pictured him actually purring
naked. I regularly walk around the flat only covered with a sheet or a dressing gown, because I know John couldn't care less, as he would never be attracted to a man; I just do as I wish because I am here at home. You must see nothing more to this than my personal shameless habits, because really, there is nothing to be ashamed of between two men, one of whom is straight and in love with a woman, and the other asexual and obsessed with his job."
"Are you sure you want to divorce her?" he asks bluntly.
With a sudden, forceful jolt, Sherlock spun them around, completely ignoring his injured arm, knocked John over, and pinned him to the floor with a violence that completely staggered the doctor. He didn't have time to ask what in the world Sherlock thought he was doing, for the taller man abruptly impaled himself on John, up to the hilt.
John kissed him again, silencing him effectively. He wouldn't be able to stop if Sherlock kept being so damned adorable and oblivious about it.
"Yes but why would there be an envelope for
"John? Are you all right dear?"
Sherlock knew he shouldn't laugh. He'd come up to butter John up, and if he laughed now, he'd definitely spoil everything. But he couldn't help it. His laughter was bubbling and candid, so much like that of a child, full of wonder and mirth, that John couldn't feel offended. He stared, fascinated, as his flatmate came up to sit on the bed and gave him a peck on the forehead.
"Sherlock, what–"
"So you decided to send a basket of poisoned apples to his wife. Very effective."
John stared, befuddled. What was Sherlock on about? He'd been dying to cuddle with him the previous night. Scratch that, he'd been dying to do much more... The manul stiffened at once. Was this the reason, then? Because he'd been nursing secret desires and hadn't acted upon them? But this was crazy! He couldn't possibly burst into Sherlock's room, jump into his bed and snog him senseless. And if Sherlock's theory was correct... Did that mean he would have to snog Sherlock
although I'm sure she would've loved it," Seb went on.
"It's true I never met him, so I can't be sure. I wish I had, by the way."
John frowned, tired of the attitude already, and coming to a decision stood up and straddled Sherlock out of the blue, wrapping his arms around him, hugging him and snuggling up to him like a koala to its tree.
"Where in the world did you find it?"
"How was it?"
He still felt like John was putting things in too romantic a way, not focusing enough on the logic, but he guessed that's what "people" were more interested in.
"...And what's the other?"
"What? But... What did you say?"
Almost a week. Had it really taken so long for Sherlock's words to sink in? Greg took a deep breath, and got up.
With a nod, he was gone. Sherlock waited until the lift doors had closed behind him and turned to Victor.
"Thank you, Dr. Watson.
sake, ready to dry your hair, ready to help you in the shower, ready to hold a towel for you and help you dry yourself while he is still dripping. All day you've been trying to find what it was that made you apologize for what these three years had done to him. Now you have the word. Selfless. Those three years have made him selfless.
The moment he'd uttered the words, he saw the hurt in John's look, and instantly felt the biting remorse gnawing in his chest.
"No, I know you're for real."
You wavered a moment. What if you just burnt it?
Sherlock felt his hand become colder and colder the more John pressed it. This was not getting anywhere.
The man did not flinch once, nor did he frown at the last words, added in darker ink. He simply took out a lighter from his inner left pocket, and holding the letter before him, set it alight.
"Have you been following me?" Eliska inquired, her tone conversational.
"They're not numer–"
"What does he say?"
or anything as ridiculous as that – he had interrupted him and said "I know. Experiment all you want." Then he had set the two rules: 1) You must tell what you intend to do beforehand, whether to yourself or to me. 2) We do not run away; if we want to stop, we just say so.
"Fine. And stop looking so stupidly happy. It's just a shower."
"But... You haven't even put on lipstick yet!" he said with mock despair, obviously trying to find something – anything – to hold her back a little.
"Harry!" Chris exclaims.
"Is this all right?" Sherlock asks.
Meanwhile, the Woman kept on talking.
Eliska smiled mockingly. "It's December, Mr. Moran. And we're in the Czech Republic. I don't live in the lowlands; it's been snowing for days, and the snow will stay at least another month; most likely two."
Sherlock observed him for a second before standing up and disappearing down the corridor. John heard him put water to boil in the kitchen, but he was so engrossed in his own brooding that he didn't realize how peculiar it was to have Sherlock prepare breakfast when they were both in human form.
far from the truth. His going back and forth between tentativeness and domineering boldness was so endearing John thought he'd never get enough.
Mycroft's goal obviously was to get rid of Moriarty's network, of the Angels, the Devils, whatever those crazy humans wanted to be called as long as they stood between hell and heaven. Or at least control them. That was just the general idea. Even more generally speaking, he had vowed allegiance to the crown – Queen and country and all that. He had chosen a side, period. And he played the game from there. His position was the best to never be bored – at least for him.
"Sherlock told me about it. Can't remember why, though. Oh yes, it was when our neighbour Mrs. Turner found a cat in the street and didn't know what to do with it, so she came to ask me – I mean, I'm not a vet or anything, but... and then Sherlock just said we should call you, since you had one."
"Then I'm afraid it wasn't him, Mrs. Watson."
He didn't realize cats did in fact lie on their backs too, when they wanted to play. John just goggled.
I WANT YOU TO.
"Mm?"
"Ha! Well we can't be surprised."
"Well, you've come all the way here even though you have a flight tomorrow morning for Washington, and you've invited me to a restaurant, so I imagine you have another request."
"Be quiet, young man!" An older male passenger suddenly protested, and many others joined in. As he became aware that everyone was against him, Jérémie felt his hatred for the stranger increase tenfold. He turned to glare impetuously at the stranger one last time, and froze on the spot, feeling very much like a bucket of cold water had just hit him. All the eyes were fixed on him, and so all missed the feral, icy stare the teenaged boy was greeted with. Jérémie's blood ran cold in his veins, and he stood transfixed by the violence, suddenly sharp and clear in the deep, engorging pupils. Terrified, reduced to a trembling prey before its predator, the boy obediently let himself be led to the back of the plane – away from the paralysing gaze of the psychopath. Jérémie suddenly felt sick. He'd seen it – and he alone had seen it. The eyes of a killer.
Since John wasn't giving him the explanation he was obviously demanding, Sherlock thought it good to hiss and swing his tail to show his displeasure.
"What? Like, during a mass?"
Sherlock shook his head,
The lullaby John and Mary sing to Blake is
"Not proper food. Not enough, anyway. Here. Or do you want me to feed you?"
"Oh, don't be cynical."
You felt sick and it didn't make sense because you
"It's true. You must believe me."
"Right, so memories about my dead flatmate. Yeah, everybody writes about that on their blog."
"I'm not bored," he went on, pacing the room with agitation. He couldn't follow Sebastian. Not to London. He couldn't go back there. Couldn't risk being seen by John, or Lestrade, or Mrs. Hudson, or...
"Sherlock, is that true? Say something!"
Don't like the menu?"
"Nevermind! That's too gloomy for me, don't want to hear about it."
"Of course," John grumbled. "What about?"
It was amazing how smooth a tiger's fur was – it gave John this peculiar feeling of cosiness he thought was only possible with a fellow human being. He'd never been one for animals – he had nothing against them of course, but he wouldn't want to have a pet. He much preferred fellow human company.
"Shut up, Seb."
"Okay, now please calm down," John said in what Sherlock construed to be an appeasing tone. Eva took another sip of her drink.
John was running down the street, dialling Sherlock's number over and over again, before remembering he'd
Rising again.
She looked up at John sharply. "I saw you kissing in the park. But I wasn't trying to imply anything. I wasn't... judging you or anything. It's just that on your blog you're so... Never mind. I'm sorry. I should really mind my own business, it was a stupid comment for me to make."
"It is the first time I have been kissed," Sherlock mused, as if thinking out loud. "You could've waited until I was really awake."
already took a shower after all."
Besides, he never liked riddles. His field was logic. He cared for John more than anything, and so it was only logical that he'd stop at nothing to protect him. The same went for Mrs. Hudson if he'd decided she came next in the priority list. And who could be the third person? Mycroft snorted. Certainly not him. No one could target him without his noticing. Who, then? Oh. Of course. The D.I. Well, let's say he came third on the list. And by that Mycroft meant their lives – again, Sherlock wasn't one to actually put
You'd found that rolling in your bed until you fell from it was a good way to get away from the dreams, but sometimes your sleeping conditions didn't make it possible – and sometimes, you didn't even realize you were dreaming. Mostly during nightmares. You wouldn't be aware of it until you were abruptly shocked out of it – by John screaming, John being shot, John drowning, John falling off from a rooftop, or John walking away from you hand in hand with someone else.
"It is."
"John?"
"Stop. Don't do this."
"He was found earlier this morning in the Epping Forest. He shot himself with the same gun that killed Brad."
The manul hissed and was making such a racket that Sherlock thought it wiser to open the door – but not before testing his authority on the frenzied feline.
He takes them absently and starts putting them on.
The plane is full and the alleys are crowded when you get on. Stupid, stupid James Harvest. He'd never fly in business class – not to mention first class – and so you had to book a ticket in economy class. You forget it's actually Molly who had to pay the bill, since you're (kind of) dead.
He squealed as Sherlock's body brushed against his erection and moaned at the loss of contact. It was such an unnerving experience, not to know where he would be touched next. He was certain Sherlock would tease, and obviously wouldn't touch him where he most wanted to be touched right now, but he wondered if he'd be merciful enough not to delay it too much.
By now, you are used to it. You close your eyes in resignation as your hands start to feel the sheet again. You're not drowsy enough to transmute it into another, dearer sheet, into another dream...
"Love affair?" the cabbie asks.
"Yeah, well, you know what he's like: CSI Baker Street."
"So Elsie would inherit all the money from her late husband."
"Why?"
"Sherlock. It's all right. Everything's all right. You're here. Just you. Nobody else is in you. Moriarty is dead. And you're alive, Sherlock. You're alive."
“Oh. Uh... bit old-fashioned?" Harry answers truthfully, still oblivious as to good manners.
‘We?’
"Mycroft. What are you trying to say?"
"But Sherlock, if it's a trap, why don't we just tell Hilton and get the hell out of here?"
"I was looking for your bloody brother, Mycroft! And you
he thought.
As always, reviews are very appreciated :)
"Sherlock. When you stopped doing drugs, surely they took blood samples. If you'd had any kind of hepatitis, you would know."
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Holmes! Thank you! I knew you'd understand..."
, a little voice murmured in the back of his mind.
"Sherlock?"
Jim had been a psychopath, or so they said. Many had said the same about Sherlock, and Molly highly doubted
of all people to make the first move? Or was he not expecting him to do anything? The one thing that unnerved Sherlock the most was the lack of data on this issue. Was John restraining himself for his own sake or for Sherlock's? What had been his line of reasoning? Had there been a line of reasoning or had it all been about
"Of course not! I have no right to be..."
"Rule the world."
"Why? Why did it happen?"
A glint of suspicion traversed John's gaze, but it did not linger.
"Jerks, too."
"I can be wrong."
And to stress his point, he kissed John's pouting mouth. It was so weird, that such silly and brutish contact with another person could feel so good. From an outer perspective, Sherlock could make no sense of it – it was like kicking a ball. He'd never understood the point, and had always refused to indulge in such boorish behaviour. Seriously, what was rational about kicking a ball
"I didn't order a Bloody Mary, Jerry."
"Why are you apologizing?" you inquire, just to be sure you got this right.
The air whistled in his ears as he felt his body fall, and fall, and fall... Jumping hadn't been easy, but falling came naturally. You didn't have to do anything, you could just let go - let go of everything.
flatmate, period. And as he'd told Mike himself, who would want him as a flatmate? Well... he saw John and he knew
Then there was also the fact that he wasn't so sure of himself anymore. What if he went too far? What if he truly hurt Sherlock?
, you mused.
"I'm Eva Blackwell," the woman said after they had ordered drinks.
come into the picture? John had no time to dwell on it. He now saw what his friend had been pointing at: armed men in the distance between the flames and the corpses, walking towards him. He looked back at the detective and saw him moving his long arms around, making signs that he should come over to hisside of the canyon, come to
"Why not?" Seb retorted coldly, quite serious.
"Do you remember why your therapist couldn't help, John?" Sherlock asked quietly, reaffirming his grip on John's hand.
Newport cemetery is even quieter in the morning than Clapham.
John, I need some.
He flinched. No, technically he had been satisfied. But his body hadn't. His body had thought it was a marvelous idea to find Sherlock's warmth arousing, his trust intoxicating.
"Hello, sunshine," he said with a grin before kissing the waking man gently on the mouth. Sherlock's lips parted in surprise and John swallowed the expected protest, his hand running up the scalp swiftly, relishing the curls and the beloved head, teasing the ear. They parted and stared at each other – John, beguiled by the very light blush spreading on the pale cheekbones, Sherlock, noticing his friend's reaction, and already giving the hint of a smirk.
John noticed the bullet had pierced through the flesh and was not in the wound, which was good news – for the tiger, anyway. It was still bleeding quite abundantly, and as a doctor, John knew he had to stop the hemorrhage before it was too late. A wild tiger probably would recover from this rather easily, but this one had most likely been held in captivity somewhere. Still, John couldn't fathom how it got to his room in the first place. Would he be in trouble if it died? It had been self-defence, though. Anyone with a gun in hand and a tiger jumping on their bed would have fired.
"You heard me. Stay."
"Sherlock. Do you remember rule number two?"
John looks at his phone, then groans. "Sorry about that. She probably thought I didn't want to come to her flat."
John's eyes fill with panic.
What Caro had said was true. Greg would trust Sherlock's word against hers. He would believe what Sherlock said, even if he himself didn't deduce anything, and, in this case, could not verify his claims. Sherlock wasn't exactly a friend, but... He was the closest to a friend that Greg had had in a long time. As a D.I. he had colleagues, whom he appreciated more or less. Then there were his wife's friends, or old friends they had in common, but he didn't see them very often. His job occupied most of his time. And Sherlock... Greg didn't know what Sherlock was to him. He was a bit too old and a bit too out of control to be a son to him, and Greg did not feel responsible for him to such an extent; he did want to protect him, help him change for the better and adapt to society, but beside providing him with cases, there wasn't much he could do, surely. He couldn't possibly ask him out to the pub and invite him to watch football. As for lunch or dinner? That was just preposterous. And Greg had sworn he would never let Sherlock see his flat: imagining what he might deduce from the simplest elements there was enough to make Greg's head spin.
John let out a sigh, but didn't answer. What was there to say anyway? He'd got himself into a fine mess.
"Seriously."
A flash of anger traversed Sherlock's darkened pupils and he gritted his teeth as he pressed the gun closer to his enemy's forehead. Jim grinned.
A divorce. That's true. When? Would they really?
literally, 'O thou who art both my protection and my scherished pride' ; from Horatio's Odes.
"You're just so damn selfish!"
"Shut up."
As he nosed around the victim's room, Sherlock's eyes fell on a notepad next to the phone. He stopped in his tracks.
"So, you actually met John because of that Sherlock guy, right?"
Sherlock did not know the city, but he still had enough wits to memorise the way he had come. He retraced his steps, running as fast as he had on the way. It was stupid. He shouldn’t be worried, because he’d told Victor that he would trust him, so if Victor had lied, if he wasn’t fine, then it was his own fault for lying to him again, and surely—
John's hands move a little on your wrists, stroking the thin skin of your inner forearm. Then they stop moving and rest there, warmth radiating from their palms and penetrating you slowly.
about the list, Sherlock!"
"Fine. Just stay here and brood, then. I'm off."
"The beginning and the end," he said, quite satisfied with how quickly he'd found such a simple, easy to understand explanation.
"You didn't cry out his name, this time. What happened?"
The discovery makes her ridiculously happy.
"Already?" Hilton echoed, distress in his voice, and a question in his eyes.
Never had he felt so exposed. He was only in underpants while Sherlock was still fully dressed, and he was rubbing himself against him. The mental image sent shivers down his spine and made his cheeks burn.
"I wasn't aware you were trained to be a therapist, John."
are the father, John!" she explodes. Then her voice breaks. "Who else?!"
At this Sherlock shivered. He had never imagined John would be so... perceptive. Moving back round to the front, the doctor chuckled lightly, if a little bitterly.
The manul did, however, crave the touch, so after a few minutes of Sherlock's staring he got tired of it and moved imperceptibly closer. And closer. And closer, until his fur was almost brushing the detective's face. Sherlock might be quite oblivious sometimes, but he wasn't stupid, and a candid smile spread across his face. John had never been so glad cats could see so well in the dark.
"...Right. Well, I was coming to talk to Sherlock about a case, but... he's out?"
He should press the button.
, too. When he was dead, sleeping with one of his shirts made you pathetic, but unimpeachable because you were a man grieving. There was something almost tragic in this image of a bereft man clinging onto a smell, and tragedy had a sublime dimension. But now you've fallen to the rank of a mere pervert. Yep, that's it. If you sleep with the shirt of a dead guy, you are a broken man, a tragic hero; but if the guy is alive, you're just a weirdo.
"It was in the file."
"Clearly he was, Inspector," she answered rather disdainfully. Sherlock turned to her and rested his palms against her desk, leaning in.
"But we don't even know if it's the doing of only one person, do we?"
The poor cat jumped back in horror, as if he actually understood what Sherlock was saying. Or maybe it was just the Cheshire cat's grin on his face that scared it. As it tried to get away, Sherlock pulled it closer by the paw, and it fell from the chair with a loud yelp. This surprised the detective, who hadn't truly meant to hurt it.
"The dog?" John repeated dumbly. "There is no dog."
"To Ca... What? When?" John stutters.
"What points are you pressing?" John wondered.
"I know! I know. Still... Why would anyone do that?"
a lot when I was moved away from London and in a terrible situation financially and morally and.../Good for you. Still hate him.), Sherlock, and women (basically 'Mine is horrible but you have to get one').
"No. I just meant that there is no need to use threats against old friends." He gave her a shark smile of his own, and wasn't entirely surprised to see hunger in her eyes, instead of fear. He snorted. Trust the Woman to be aroused by something feral.
They talk for hours. Mrs. Hudson does most of the talking, because John hasn't much to say – he tells her he got a job again and works part-time at a clinic, and that he now lives with his sister and her new girlfriend. Mrs. Hudson gives him news of her sister, of Mrs. Turner who's a darling and the only one in the street who believed Sherlock wasn't a fake even before it was proved and came out in the press, of Lestrade who is back in town – probably thanks to Mycroft, she adds, and John cannot help but wince at the name. He doesn't have the heart to tell her that the man was responsible for the death of his own brother.
I don't know. I think not. He won't come back."
Moran locked eyes with her. "We both know Sherlock must handle this alone."
"I already saw it, you know," Sherlock told him quietly. "Your scar."
"I think I know why she blew up the house."
"You know they're doing well. Why are you trying to make small talk? You already have the answers to all of your questions."
So they had spent the evening in silence – not their usual, comfortable silence, but one that was off, like a false note – and finally John had retired for the night, saying he was tired. As if he needed to explain himself. As if Sherlock would question his decision to go to bed.
"Sherlock..."
"Can I sit here?"
The void.
"I know it's a game. One I have to play in order to finish this."

"Oh, really?"
would have tricked you."
"Stop saying my name," he moaned back, wiggling under him in a – failed – attempt at cutting short the teasing.
about not spending Christmas with his flatmate – his bloody
"This," he said abruptly, making John start. "I think this is fine." John blinked. "Better than fine. It's... good. It is completely irrelevant to consider it from an objective point of view, because there is nothing objective to it. From an outer perspective, you have been imposing yourself on me and I have been manipulating you. Now, even you must realize how illogical this statement is."
"No. He... He lent it to me," John lied with a very unconvincing smile. Mycroft looked at him pointedly. "Shall we go?" John added with a nervous little cough.
You hung up. If he really did manage to track your call (which you highly doubted), by the time he arrived you'd be long gone. As you walked away smirking, you relished the warm weather, finally starting to feel your limbs again after a winter spent in Russia.
Moriarty had given him one of his manic grins. But Sebastian liked them. He always saw the edge of irony and the glint of sheer genius in it. Which didn't mean Jim wasn't mad.
"Mmmh... Doing some kind of remembrance trip, I guess."
of your partners," he muttered.
"Mrs. Hudson, this isn't actually Sherlock's pet."
"I thought I had just stated that quite clearly."
! Not immorality, no... something worse, something we share, because there's no such thing as good and evil in the face of boredom. Amorality, they say. They who crowd their little heads with nonsense... I say reality. Why do people always overcomplexify everything when they don't understand even the basics? Polluting their already anorexic brains with useless concepts. Such a waste of mental space. Minds like ours clarify things, they don't complicate them unnecessarily. But you lost that strength, Sherlock.
Lilies. Yellow waterlilies. They don't even look strange in the living-room now – you've become so used to yellow flowers lighting up Baker Street that you barely take notice of them. You bought these waterlilies to cheer Mary up a bit. Even if she keeps saying she's fine, you wonder if she truly is. She doesn't sleep well at night and she looks overly tired. She laughed gaily when you picked her up at school with a bunch of waterlilies. Her state worried you while you were at the clinic today and you texted her often. You offered to take a full-time job at the clinic so she could rest a bit if she was tired of her job, but she was horrified at the thought of leaving her pupils and repeated heatedly: "I'm fine!"
He pursed his lips and briefly reconsidered his decision to shelter the criminal, feeling John’s stare burning two fine holes into his cotton suit the entirety of the motion. He turned back in time to see John snap his head forward and make an effort to raise himself.
Maybe the basement wasn’t such a terribly inconsiderable option.
"Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Mommy's just happy to see you." Carol's voice cracked out.
Sure, in the short span he’d spent with Sherlock, he could tell how seriously he took his job- consultancy. “Then why do you need
Upon catching sight of him her vaguely troubling expression subsided. Her face positively lighting up. Much like that smaller Christmas tree had been  but a moment ago. John frowned at her warily, where had the small, raging ball of condensed demonic vengeance gone?
"What's wrong mommy?" Sarah asked in confusion, brushing a stray hair away from Carol's rapidly wetting face. Carol shook her inclined head and let out a wet laugh. She turned to look at her safe, alive, happy, and unharmed daughter and attempted to smile comfortingly but her lips started quivering.  "Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Mommy's just happy to see you." Carol's voice cracked out. "I'm happy to see you too, mummy. Please stop crying?" She sniffled and burrowed herself into Sarah's chest and muffled her sobs as the elevator doors slid closed.
“With police officers?” He couldn’t help the bite in his words.
"Philip, that's enough." Sally finally says, sounding a bit off. Sherlock doesn't turn to her. And then—for reasons relating to the utter imbecility of his infantile months—he says, "I can still write, you moron."
John has officially snapped.
"Don't forget, Karim. My shoe is worth more than your very fucking existence. I can decide if you eat out of garbage cans for the rest of your life with a snap of fingers. I can-and will- ruin you. Nobody wants assisted murder on their record, now do they?"
“Indigo and violet, your mother has lovely taste.” Sherlock observes, worrying the material between his thumb and forefinger with care.
“They could’ve witnessed a peddling.”
Sherlock twitched at that, and turned around, looking a lot less accommodating than before. "I'm quite sure that I do-"
“The hell if I know,” John remarks, tone snark but sounding a fond kind of resigned one would aim at a disobedient pet. But lightens at Sherlock’s look. “So, why are you giving me the silent treatment?” John asks, his honest curiosity bracketing two small lines between his eyebrows.
He ignored it. The hotels name rang a bell, it rang a few. Except they were all located in the deepest and most embarrassingly disused crevices of his mind. Seeming as though he could turn down a corridor and see its tail just whip around the corner before it scurried down another hall. Leaving nothing but alarm in its wake. He just couldn't
“Except dying. Heart surgery and all.”
user. It helps me focus." His eyes flicked up to see John frown at him.
John nods his thanks and smiles before taking a couple rough sips in between his coughs. Inhales deeply through his nose, and sets a tired stare on Sherlock through tear-rimmed eyes. The emotion such an expression was usually meant to express makes Sherlock shift in his seat restlessly. At least he finally received his much-needed distraction.
"John, Captain John H. Watson. Army Doctor. Nice to meet you." He paused and glanced at Sherlock, before finally relenting at the nervous lip purse John aimed his way. Taking the offered hand and shaking it stiffly.
“What? The cephalexin has evaporated into nothingness, so sorry to say. And why do you need it, have you contracted mastitis, mother hen?”
Looking at it with a mix of relief and excitement he began to open the packet until John cleared his throat again. "Pay up first. And you can't do this out here."
And before John knew it, he was laughing too.
"Anyone new?" He asked distractedly as he squeezed the lime above the chilled glass.
He has some concerns. The lilting lightbulb flickers its dullish yellow hue down at him once in agreement.
Nevertheless, he would look far too soft in the eyes for a boy who studied like he expected to bear the weight of the world on his shoulders by next week. (The boy must have extremely strict parents.)
They refrained from putting up a white tent over the scene. Must have been a pain for Lestrade to convince them not to cover Charles. He seemed to know Sherlock quite well to be able to forsee such a detail. Maybe even similar in his investigating skills. Instead of just allowing people close to Charles to stifle their progress for reasons relating to dignity. Easily allowing them a decent view of the surrounding area. Buildings. Buildings in which their assassin had not long before hid just beyond. Everywhere. Joyous.
well known. Sherlock hardly came out, never attended an event, joined a club. Submerged, just under the radar. A muted dot signaling an abandoned submarine. Mmm, too far. He vocalizes a polite "That's none of your concern." And it wasn't, nor would it ever would be.
“192 months.”
Or Sherlock just didn't have time for his shenanigans and wanted to get back to work.
"God, you machine."
Sherlock sniffed and resumed cutting. "Classified."
John just looked back at the pants clad cow skull with a sigh. Then back at Sherlock and cleared his throat. "Can I?" Sherlock just inclined his chin forward and hummed in question. "May I receive my pants from your cow skull?" Sherlock nodded in assent. "Everything else is in the washer below my floor." Sherlock added after he finished.
Sherlock doesn’t, just stays sitting before the poster, criss-cross-apple-sauce like the
Sherlock flopped back dramatically an turned his head to him with bored eyes. "You catch on quick do you?" He watched as John began to pull up his pants. "Just answer the question!" He snapped and tried to ignore Sherlock's staring. Sherlock rolled his eyes and looked at the ceiling. "Your wallet. You're also a veteran, army doctor, discharged due to injury to your left shoulder. You still suffer from PTSD, mild superiority complex your therapist had blown off as being calloused from the war, perhaps she was right. More tests are needed. Anyways, you were discharged 2 years ago and sported a psychosomatic limp for quite some time but you've managed to overcome it, mostly. No wife, no children, no family, just you and your blokes. Though I must admit I am curious about what induced such a drastic change in career." Sherlock turned to him. "What happened?" Sherlock looked at John in mock bewilderment while shaking his head.
The boys recede, trading macho-word and shove one another in rough companionship.
“For his experiments. He does the craziest things all for some case or something or other.”
A sigh of resignation. "No, you'd be dead-"
“Seeing as the main attendee couldn’t make it past the halfway line this morning’s practice, I thought I’d fill in.”
. It’s not like it’s reciprocated. And if it were, would it really save you from bleeding out after getting shot by some trigger-happy fellow?”
“Is...is that so?” Sherlock inquires, a voice sounding small. An utter opposition to the infuriatingly aloof and intimidatingly intelligent boy he’s come to know.
"A paper bag, thugs, violence, a van." Sherlock listed off dully as he looked away and stared at a spot on the wall. "How quaint." He gestured for John to take a seat. "What are you doing?" John asked, looking at his gesturing hand. "Asking you to sit down, it's a commonly used hand gesture, I'm surprised you don't recognize it." He replied doing it again. "I'd like to resume my actions prior to you running to the bathroom and nearly hyperventilating once you caught sight of your wounds." He supplied insensitively but it wasn't mocking. John was too sore and disoriented to care and complied. "I can do this myself, you know." Sherlock watched as John took a seat on the low bathroom counter. Thank god it was low. "Yes, clearly. Now look away." Sherlock proceeded quickly yet with finesse. While John hardly managed to keep himself upright, he felt the occasional warm hand grip his hip or thigh to keep him steady as he worked.
The rock also seemed to be perched above a body of water, telling from the large abutment to their right. Winds rippled the waters surface. The recycled light bending to the smooth surface’s ever flow and swish. The soft sound of waves hit the shore, tree’s leaves rustled faintly, easily heard from their close proximity to their treetops. He took a deep breath, allowing the fresh, dewy aroma to invade his senses. He shivered pleasantly when a bracing breeze rushed by, tousling his curls and icy winds whistling past his ears.
Faux-concern or adamant, self-inflicted conditioning into the good little doctor he’s going to be. Must be hard. John would probably attempt to condescend him for their age difference (it wasn’t his fault he ranked at AP, not completely), under the guise of him still being his elder—maybe out of jealously--making the reality of his situation all that much worse. Telling from the classes listed for his roommate’s in the Birkbeck’s online records, John was above average but painfully average all the same. Blond, bright-eyed and cookie-eating, dream-shitting grin. He wondered for a moment, as his eyes phantom-stung at the memory of the pearly whites glaring back at him. Would John’s smile remain vivid when he received his diploma on stage, in spite of a bullet to the leg or knife to the shoulder? How ecstatic would he be? Ecstatic enough to be numb, that happened right? Going into shock? Like fainting girlfriends at proposals.
His outburst causes Sherlock to frown at him, crinkle of his brow looking a little too alarmed for John’s liking.
of all people. Just so he can find them and shove a cacti-trophy up their tight arse for managing the seemingly-impossible task of distressing this sophisticated egghead of a hellion.
“This,” Sherlock says, poking at his instant ramen cup with a plastic spork. “is why I can’t go to jail.”
And still doesn’t move. Sherlock sighs and lays his forehead against the cool metal, suddenly not wanting to move, maybe catch hypothermia, he’ll pose as an example of corrupted school systems. His undoubtedly forever-frozen statue will act as a memoir for academic struggle everywhere—even if it doesn’t apply to him at a laughable degree.
“Mind if I borrow your phone?” John asks tersely, a set determination singeing away any of the previous fatigue caused by his inability to not choke on his own saliva.

Almost immediately, her face took on a sweet appearance, as if she hadn't just compared a mans life to her red heel.
." He shouldn't have been surprised when he was suddenly caught in a headlock by a very pissed off John Watson. "Shut up, you bloody megalomaniac!" Sherlock started at that. "Megalo-

He received a light chuckle in response. "Yeah, wish I could say the same. I owe him though." He looked up from the notepad he was scribbling on with a sly grin, the short and often-sharpened-looking pencil going limp between his slim fingers.
"Or you can bid your father's dream job good day." Anderson, your typical dream achieving sloth, leaping to bounds off his father's fortune. An heir was necessary and Sherlock pities their company. "Surely Greg wouldn't mind catching wind of your hobby." And Sherlock hardly remembers the headmaster's name, but he does now. This was not good.
John struggled to cover his face with his arms: afraid of worsening his head injury. The only thing running through his mind was to protect his head. Anything else was a lost cause, he could only hope they didn't have a knife. So they continued kicking the helpless man until their taunting shouts and John grunts and cries of pain were the only thing echoing off the walls.
Sherlock briefly looked at him before adding the tea to the pot. "Only when said gun lacks ammunition."
He heard paper rustle. A chair scrape the floor. And continued searching. "What are you doing?"
The rustling papers in Sherlock’s hands involuntarily lower for the second time that morning. “…I do?”
“Ah! While we’re on that subject, let me ask. I’ve caught rather gusty wind of your imminent sugar-bombing. So, I thought I would drop in and ensure you were officially pathetic!” Jim kindly polishes off with a chirp and a little bounce on his Salvatore Ferragamo’s. It was a wonder Jim hadn’t gotten mugged yet. Else he had, and that was a viscous image Sherlock would much rather not prompt.
