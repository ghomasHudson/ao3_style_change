There's a beat. "Sorry, what's fascinating?" John asks.
"I thought it wasn't a proposal," Sherlock says, against his mouth, and John bites down lightly on his lower lip for a moment in retaliation.
He sits back on his heels and shoves the right cheek of Sherlock's arse up with the palm of his hand, just to watch the way it jiggles when he lets go, and makes a noise like he's in pain.

He pushes John back onto the living room floor, legs unfolding from beneath him as he stretches out his abused thighs. Sherlock all but rips the condom off John, flinging it aside, blindly, and John's groan - part laughter, anyway - breaks off when Sherlock leans down to swallow his prick (pausing only briefly to grimace at the faint taste of latex).
"When?" Sherlock asks, flatly.
(one bedroom, this time).
"Oh," John says, then, "
Mmn, not really. I've managed to acquire some fingers that should aid my work in documenting the skin damage ants can inflict post mortem.

He glances up at John. "Like I said. Murder-y."
"Of course I know that," Sherlock snaps, but,
"It has been. A

"Hey," John says, and Sherlock lifts his head to accept a quick kiss - and when he pulls back, there's a tiny smile playing at the corners of his lips that he no longer tries to fight, and John brushes a thumb over his cheek affectionately as he props a hip against the table.

"I don't know what you want me to say," Sherlock says, sliding down in his chair a little, and John leans back in his, reaching over for his drink.
21 July
Sherlock reaches out and touches the wedding band again, and John - even if he doesn't completely understand, so perfect and patient in this moment - silently presses a kiss to the top of his head.
"Cock," he says, affectionately, relaxing his grip again for a moment. "You got one more in you?" and Sherlock's watching him, fascinated. He gives John another tiny nod. "Right," John says, getting to his feet, "I need you up on the kitchen table for this one."
I think they may have solved it.

"Can I-" he breathes, "inside-" and Sherlock cups his face and kisses him back, orgasm-soft and sweet, before reaching for the waistband of John's pants. He peels them carefully down, over John's rather insistent erection, and John kneels on the bed.
John peers into his tea for a moment, collects his thoughts, before glancing up again.
. He folds the memory up carefully, precise, crisp creases; and while there's not a moment of intimacy with John he'll ever forget, he files this with his other favourite moments of sexual congress with John (the first time John touched him, eyes darting over Sherlock's face, licking his lips nervously, breath stuttering as badly as Sherlock's; the first time John had penetrated him, slow and careful, as he pressed Sherlock into the mattress; the first time he'd climaxed twice, his eyes wide and shocked, John's dark, impressed and so,

John kisses him back, lightly at first, quietly smacking kisses, and when he sucks on Sherlock's top lip, Sherlock presses against him.

Sherlock's jaw drops open as he gets closer, eyes closing as it builds at the base of his spine. John presses their cheeks together and Sherlock grabs at the bedsheet as he comes with a low groan. John strokes him through it, thumb swiping over the head of his cock, until Sherlock collapses to the side, still half-sprawled on John, one leg thrown over John's.
He touches Sherlock's rim with his slick fingers, dipping just inside with one fingertip, before replacing them with his cock. He presses in again, and when the head pops in, John lets out a shaky breath.
Sherlock pushes himself up again, straightening his arms. "You're aroused," he says, with a slight frown.
He pulls him through it, rubs him through the aftershocks with his own come, harder than he'd personally enjoy, but Sherlock shivers, his expression blissful.

He delicately peels John's pants down, and wraps a hand around the base of his cock.

Sherlock turns properly into the kiss, abruptly, and John's mouth moves against his, slow and deliberate, until Sherlock's toes are curling helplessly in the carpet.
Sherlock lets out a breath and John kisses the trail of hair beneath his belly button, mouthing at his lower abdomen, gently scraping his teeth against the soft skin.
"Eurus," Sherlock murmurs, brow furrowing, eyes still closed, and John jolts upright in his chair.
"I've never written you poetry."

John jerks beneath him, tugging at the tips of their cocks as he comes, one heel bouncing on the bed, and he slows his hand as he wrings out the last of it. He lets his cock slip from his grip, and before he's caught his breath, he wraps his hand around Sherlock (the addition of John's ejaculate on his hand changing the texture of the slick in a minute way he files away to examine later).
Sherlock pulls back, wipes the corner of his mouth with his thumb-pad. He pauses, thinking (and John, John knows better than to ask what about. Bowel movements, probably).

Mycroft said nothing.
‘If there were to be one, I’d probably have to invent it.’
Mrs Hudson went back to her own flat a few hours later, after tea. Sherlock had gone and bought another loaf of bread and they’d had some of it with the jam Mrs Hudson had made in Kent and brought with her rather than open one of the scant few tins in the cupboard. John had gathered the crockery off the table and was now standing at the sink, washing up, as Sherlock fiddled with the gramophone. The needle scratched gently against the record as Sherlock placed it at the edge, static crackling for a couple of seconds before
Sherlock’s shoulders began to shake and soon both of them were laughing quietly together on the bench. ‘What’s the time?’ John asked as his giggles died down. Sherlock got his torch out of his pocket and turned it on for a second, looking out of his watch before clicking it off again.
John stood rooted in place. His brain was unable to process the notion of running after so much time spent marching blindly forwards, always forwards. He took a gasping breath, his mind’s eye flashing to an image of Sherlock, twenty and haughty and perfect, waist-deep in the fountain of the big house. He closed his eyes and stood still. Sherlock, in ecstasy against the bookshelf; hands pressed to the back window of a police car, scared and shaken; awkward and bumbling in a hospital café; sleeping peacefully in his private, cosy flat; His Sherlock.
,’ John said, pausing a moment before his next slap to Sherlock’s arse, his fingers curling round the gentle curve and slope of Sherlock’s buttocks. ‘That’s it, you want it, don’t you? You want this
It must have been the jeans. The wine, too, of course, but it was the tight jeans Sherlock was wearing that had made John's eyes blow wide and black, that had made his tongue flick out of his mouth ever so slightly, just wetting his bottom lip before Sherlock saw his jaw tighten as he bit down on it. Sherlock had smirked then, pleasure and desire flaring low in his stomach as he bent to pick his phone up from the coffee table, giving John a view of his arse. He certainly wasn't smirking now.
‘How was your leave?’ Moriarty asked, putting his hands in his pockets as he caught up to Sherlock.
. ‘John!’ he cried.
‘Oh, shut up, you sod.’ John sighed and fixed Sherlock with a look that turned into a smile.
‘What exactly are you going to do with this axe, should we get one?’ John asked, hand curled around his stick.
John tapped his calf with the bottom of his walking stick. ‘I’ll do my best.’
‘Penny for them, then.’
‘Skirting the edges of blackmail, Sherlock Holmes,’ John muttered, rolling his eyes and shaking his head before he pulled the window shut and made his way downstairs as quietly as possible. He slid the bolt across on the door and turned the key near silently, opening it just enough for Sherlock to come in. ‘Upstairs,’ John muttered, pushing Sherlock by the small of his back towards the first floor, where John’s flat was. Once they were both in the dingy hallway, John locked his front door and held his hand out for Sherlock’s coat, which Sherlock was unbuttoning, back turned. ‘What was it that couldn’t wait until morning, then?’ John asked, hanging the coat once it was handed to him.
‘Don’t be sorry.’ John smiled against Sherlock’s temple. ‘It’s not natural on you.’
‘John may not see it that way--’
Sherlock scoffed.
Set in the
‘They look perfectly happy,’ John said, his eyes following a boy of about eight, who stood atop the bomb rubble, brandishing a stick towards the blue sky as though it was a sword.
‘Nice little tune.’
‘He is an odd one,’ Mrs Watson said, her eyes closed. ‘Even odder since he went up to Oxford. I’m surprised you don’t see more of each other there--’
‘Half past six,’ John agreed, turning his back on Mycroft and walking out of the house, back down the path that led to the far more humble cottage he and his mother shared.
‘No, you’re right, he’s probably telling the prime minister what to do on the telephone every night, secretly running the country.’
There was a pause, and Victor sniffed. ‘May I come in?’
‘Fine.’ Sherlock waved his hand. ‘I got up awkwardly. Are you alright?’
‘Of all the bars in all the towns in all the world...’
‘Not at present, Sir, I’m sorry.’
A slow smile spread across the man’s face and he leered knowingly. Moriarty stared him out until he turned and walked away.
‘Stunning deduction,’ John said with a smile, kissing the top of Sherlock’s head. ‘They had none at the shop, something about a sunken boat.’
Would it have been worth while,
Humming, Sherlock flexed his fingers slowly in the bowl of water.
Outside, it began to rain.

‘Oh yes, so it was.’ Sherlock pulled a face. ‘Bugger. Are you going to make me join in with the cricket?’
‘Wouldn’t you like to know?’ Sherlock winked and tapped his nose with his forefinger, his movements big and clumsy, before he hauled John out of his seat.
‘Not quite,’ John said, meeting Gilchrist’s simpering blue eyes.
The Tiffany lamp bathed their bedroom at 221b in its soft light as John ran his hand slowly through Sherlock’s curls that night, after a restless afternoon had been spent in the car and around the flat. Finally calm, Sherlock was curled up on John’s chest, his hand spread over John’s heart, his eyes closed.
John waited until Sherlock had dropped it beside them before going back for more kisses, this time letting his legs drop either side of Sherlock’s body, opening his pelvis up so Sherlock’s touches, though still dry, stroked down over the tight, soft skin of his entrance, and the twists of hair of his perineum. John let out a shaky breath at the promise of what was to come.
“Me neither,” John said as they walked in. “Can we… carry on talking about this? I don’t want to be that dick who never texts.”
“I was thinking of getting a flat, once I’ve graduated,” Sherlock said. “Somewhere central. I want to do a post-grad, but I wouldn’t have to go in every day for that.” The train pulled into a station, braking sharply, making John stumble into Sherlock. “Oof. You ok?”
John had a shallow cut to his face, and Sherlock a bloodied set of knuckles on his right hand. They’d raced all over London, so it seemed, on foot and in cabs, and even on bikes, for a short while. But they’d got him. Not without a fight, but they’d got him.
The new omega climbed gingerly onto the sheets, slick dampening his arse and the backs of his thighs.
“Did you get sorted with a room, Gregory?” Julian asked.
John looked up at Mycroft, then at the skull. Something cold settled in his stomach.
“It’d be difficult to feel worse,” Sherlock said. “John helped.”
John’s feet were cold in his damp trainers, and he walked slightly hunched over to try and keep the cold out. Football practice might be in the school barn in winter but it was still freezing, and the encrusted mud on his trainers didn’t help. He was starving hungry, as well. He rounded the corner onto the main road, and kept his eyes ahead as he walked quickly, hands stuffed into the front pocket of his hoodie.
…he felt like kissing when he was close to John.
“Oh my god,” Sherlock breathed.
‘I mean, you’ve decided what you want to do with your life, and he’s decided his own. People make different choices, Sherlock. You can’t judge them for that.’
John frowned, not getting it.
John stared at him.
“I know that, but –”
“Yes,” Sherlock bit his cookie. “I know I don’t exactly stay out of fights, but… if they all came at me, and I was having… I don’t want to end up with them. I don’t want it to
“I know,” John grinned, leaning back down to kiss him, parting his legs and keeping his arse as accessible as possible, feeling positively lewd, though the dark kept him modest. “Slow, ok?”
John looked up, his mouth open in surprise. “What… now?”
John came over an hour after Sherlock was home, having been summoned by text. He was more than a little relieved to get out of the house – in summer, the place grew damp and smelled weird, and John was certain things were breeding in the carpets, so he tried to stay out of the house as much as possible. He’d done all his homework in the week Sherlock was in hospital, some beside Sherlock’s bed, and some in the library, but he’d missed being able to see his friend properly. Thank goodness they still had four weeks or so of the summer holidays.
“Yeah,” John eased onto Sherlock’s front, settling so they were nose to nose. “Coach doesn’t want to search for a new fly-half. And the lads don’t fancy lifting anyone heavier.”
Sherlock huffed out a laugh. “You think so?”
Greg raised a tentative hand. “Can… can I..?”
“You are, I just… I was just asking,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, and went to the tack wall. “You’ve been crying.”
Sherlock gave her a tiny smile, and sat beside her on the couch as his father examined the books set into the walls.
John took his gloves off. “Do you wish you didn’t know?”
“Er…” Sherlock stroked a hand over his dark curls, “he doesn’t think you will. Ever.”
‘Sherlock, you’re carrying her around in a sling. You never stop talking about her. You – you’re being a dad. And that’s not a bad thing!’ Lestrade held his hands up. ‘It’s not! It’s admirable. Not every alpha would do what you’re doing. I’m… in awe.’
The horse looked at him, and went back to chewing on something. Animals didn’t mind omegas, and some omegas became veterinarians, if they were allowed to.
“No, I just… lost my confidence, a bit,” Sherlock picked a blade of grass, and split it with his thumbnail.
"I'll begin questioning, today," he announced.
Violet sat up, slightly. “Th-the garden?”
"Of course. Without the inappropriately named aunts and uncles."
He didn't
The Head snorted, and picked up a paper on his desk. ‘I’ve had a letter come through today, looking for lads who are smart enough to go to the training college over at Cheltenham. I was going to recommend you.’
“I saw you put in the code, once,” Sherlock’s muffled voice replied.
John and Sherlock swam in the pool, Sherlock taught John how to play chess properly, and John showed Sherlock how to do a handstand at the bottom of the swimming pool. At night, when they ate out, Sherlock would read the menu to John and John would slip Sherlock extra bits of bacon when his mother reminded him to think about his waistline.
He had had on visitor, in hospital. And it hadn’t been who he either expected, or wanted.
John’s pre-heat lasted an entire day.
John rubbed the back of his head. “Actually, it’s… kind of about that time… that week… that I need to speak to you both.”
John nodded. He turned his head, just a fraction, and kissed Sherlock on the lips. Soft, like a teenager asking permission, or giving it. With the same fierce tension gripping them both. Unsure what was allowed. Desperate to find out.
John helped Sherlock up the stairs, and made him change his stinking clothes whilst he made them both coffee. He set the mugs down as Sherlock came in, smelling strongly of generic deodorant, and his own sharp citrus and vanilla scent mixed together. It wasn’t entirely unappealing.
Slowly… things began to feel normal, again.
“Despite, then?”
Except then John is talking to a woman he knows isn’t there. He’s tell her about the crime that’s been eating him alive over these past few weeks and months. The one he never got to own up to before she was stolen from him.
Whether it was his pregnancy, or the labours of the day, John didn’t know, but he was suddenly exhausted. He pulled the duvet over himself, not bothering to undress as he wrapped his arms around his chest, hunching, the way he used to in the army, rocking himself into warmth and sleep, and pretending he was not alone.
It wasn’t that, at all. John loved Sherlock the man, not Sherlock the alpha. John loved the Sherlock who had bought him Easter eggs. The man who had taken him to the museums, and done his homework with him, and cuddled him on the sofa as they half-watched films together. The one who had waited months and years for John to be ready for him.
“Jesus, Sherlock.”
John stared at him. “But if I do that, then…”
“Professionally. You wouldn’t be?”
“I was going to get the bus,” John said. “You coming.”
Warnings: Sexual content, including vaginal penetration. Misgendering, self injury, and transphobic slurs. As always, be mindful of your own triggers.
“No,” John went bright red. “No, it’s just… somewhere.”
“No, I don’t blame you,” Quinn looked up. “They are a bit full-on.”
Violet made an uncertain noise. “An alpha boy?”
It’s the only word, hanging in the air.
“He’s going to be mad,” John said, finding some chopsticks in the cutlery drawer.
John stroked a hand down Sherlock’s leg. “Sherlock… What do you –”
“I will.”
The two of them went out onto the patio, where people were drinking and smoking. Sherlock managed to cadge a cigarette off an alpha man who looked extremely surprised, and John clicked his tongue in distaste.
Knowing that John actively didn't like him, though, caused Sherlock some distress, though he would deny it if anyone should ask. He didn't quite know why, yet. He found nothing special about John. Certainly, he had enjoyed holding him, fucking him. He liked the smell of him. He liked how proud John was, but not proud enough to deny that he was afraid of Sherlock, or that Sherlock was clever, though that was obvious.
“You said a doctor fabricated the files,” the Major-General looked from Sherlock to John. “This one?”
Sherlock put a hand to his damp, newly washed face. “John, look at me. In the eyes, John. Come on.”
“And I’ll be there. If you want me,” John added.
The look on Sherlocks face said that far from being ridiculous, this was the sexiest thing Sherlock had ever heard. He moaned, lunging forward to kiss John’s mouth, scent his neck, lick and taste him as much as he could, even as he released his grip of their cocks, and let his hand drift lower, squeezing the muscle of John’s thigh, sparse blond hairs twisting under his palm as he reached down, finger-tips skimming soft, virgin skin.
“Mm-hm,” Sherlock keyed it in and held the phone to his ear.
“Unlikely,” John panted. “She’s… I don’t live with my mum.”
John caught him by the shoulders. “Deep breath, Sherlock, in through your nose. Try not to tense…” he pressed a hand to Sherlock’s concave stomach. “Breathe out slowly, breathe in with your belly, really push it out if you can.” He kept his warm hand under Sherlock’s sweatshirt but above his t-shirt as Sherlock slowly untensed, and his limbs began to tremble slightly. “Ok?”
“See you soon, Sherlock.”
“Tony Davidson didn’t. I barrelled him straight in the bollocks. He won’t be able to stand for a week.”
Sherlock stared. “What are you saying?”
Lucy used her Daddy’s deckchair to pull herself upright, wobbling on her fat little bow-legs, before letting go with one hand, and guiding herself around to the front of the chair, and then around the long legs held still as her pudgy hand gripped the trouser fabric tight.
No one else knew what it was like to carve out your own heart for the sake of selfish want.
Sherlock let out a broken sigh, then. “I don’t know what to
The abruptness of Sherlock’s words jolted him back awake.
“Don’t see as I have much choice in the matter,” John shrugged, “but I’d choose to come with you anyway.”
John pushed the thought away.
Sherlock moaned. ‘John, for god’s sake!’
John shook his head. “Countless wars have begun, and been lost. Terrorist attacks, stolen documents and secrets… There was never a chance for Mycroft Holmes to stop any of it, because he didn’t live long enough. Mycroft hasn’t been able to save Britain, because you weren’t there to save Mycroft.”
Sherlock paused, then nodded. “Not for falling. If they knew I’d let you hold…” he stopped, suddenly going as red as John knew his own face must be.
The curtain was pulled back.
John… John wanted to wait, too. But him wanting to wait felt different.
“Yes?” Victor got to his feet.
“Sherlock has a fiancé.” It wasn’t a question.
“I excused myself, and climbed out of the toilet window,” Sherlock started pulling his shoes back on. “I’ve had better nights.”
And it all started with that parcel…
John felt a throb of guilt.
It was a freezing cold Bonfire Night; the sort where you need hats and scarves and gloves and a big coat to go with your hot chocolate and baked potatoes. As London firework displays left a great deal to be desired, Sherlock and John had accepted Mycroft’s invitation to go out to the country with people he worked with, for a weekend of autumnal fun.
“NOW!”
“I hope to see you again soon. And your birthday’s coming up, isn’t it?” Cam asked.
Alphas usually respected the presence of another alpha’s pregnant mate.
John was suddenly wide-awake, sweat frosting his back. ‘Sherlock?’
“No, wait until we get home,” Sherlock said. “It’ll do me good to learn patience, for once.”
“You might not be an omega –”
John didn’t ask. He waited.
Mycroft had shown himself out, and silently handed John a box of same-day delivered clothes a few hours later. John had thanked him, and hung up the new things in his new wardrobe, where they hung like dead things.
“That’s possible,” John said, “isn’t it?”
him… And god, John wanted him back. He didn’t need the soft feeling between his arse cheeks to tell him that.
*****
“It’s Christmas Eve. He’s not back yet.”
Mycroft sat forward, and Sherlock could just make him out in his peripheral vision. “How long have you been taking drugs, Sherlock?”
“Oh, fuck!” a high-pitched cry came from across the room as Toby, the only other omega in the class, stood in horror, looking as though he’d wet his pants. But… that wasn’t piss. That was…
“John,” Sherlock stroked over his knuckles, “if you want to go to uni, you’ll go.”
John smiled into the young man’s skin. “If it helps… I love you too.”
“Jesus, you always were a clever sod,” James shook his head, but kept smiling. “I thought you’d vanished for good, like. You just… disappeared.”
“Let’s start with the face.”
John looked levelly at him. ‘You told me, in the woods that time, that you kissed someone else first,’ he said. ‘Is that true?’
John let out a sob. "Fuck! Major-General David Patterson. Nice guy. Got Oliver transferred here. I can't see him being -" John's words dissolved into a blur of swear-filled moans as Sherlock finally rubbed against his prostate, and simultaneously sucked at his throbbing erection.
“Any time you want chasing, Lestrade, you just let me know,” Sherlock smirked back, his red eyes flashing.
Like a flash of lightning, anger shot through Sherlock, and he took the few meters above him like a rocket. He spun on the landing and propelled himself through the door in a rush of dark clothes and flashing red eyes.
Cam had looked up in surprise from his laptop. “Sherlock. Are you… alone?”
Sherlock felt horribly sick.
“So... you’re his... friend?”
“If you were an omega, would that make a difference?”
“I’m being serious. I know that me coming here isn’t helping. But the last thing I wanted was for Sherlock or you to see me eight months in and then realise. I… I’m not here for Sherlock. I’m here to tell you both I’m expecting. That’s it. I don’t expect anything else.” John looked at Sherlock, who still wasn’t moving. “Are – are you going to react, at all, Sherlock?”
“It’s very nice,” Sherlock’s voice interrupted his thoughts. He’d taken off his suit jacket and tie, and rolled his sleeves up to his elbows. “Thank you.”
John opened the card first.
“I don’t know,” John said through gritted teeth. “You’re supposed to count in the gaps between pains, but it doesn’t feel like there
John’s hands froze, halfway through doing up his shirt buttons. ‘He had a cold,’ he said. ‘I – I saw him. Today. Yesterday, I mean. I checked him over, his chest was clear, he…’ John staggered and caught himself on the desk. Panic was flooding his vision, making him dizzy and sick. ‘Oh my god. Oh my god, what did I miss?’
John blinked. “Agreed?”
“I’m sorry,” he said. “Don’t you kiss?”
“And you’re mine,” John kissed him, smiling as something kicked his hand where it lay on Sherlock’s stomach. “Well, I might as well soak you up. I’m going to have to share you, soon enough.”
He ended up in the library, looking up at the books, and the framed certificates on the walls.
"It certainly is if it influenced the crime in any way," Sherlock smirked. He sat back and steepled his fingers. "It really bothers you? What’s wrong - you don't like it? You don’t like what he does to you?”
Sherlock could only nod.
Sherlock squeezed John’s hand, but didn’t answer.
John caught himself on the edge of the bed, the mattress tearing under his grip, the bedframe squeaking as he held it tight.
Mycroft bit his lip. ‘The
“John,” Sherlock sat up, taking John with him, holding him close. “John, it’s ok. It’s ok, I’ve got you.”
“It’s really not.”
. He’s… clean. You don’t need to worry.”
A sigh. “Fine. But you sit in the lounge, and you do not leave your chair, and you do not try to touch him, is that clear?”
Sherlock reached out, and touched John’s cheek. “I am sorry. I’ll try harder. Victor never minded when –”
Another blank stare.
Sherlock followed closely as John stepped into the living area, which was cluttered, but not messy. Mrs Hudson must have tidied up, which Sherlock was somewhat grateful for.
“Please.”
“What happened?” the man bent to look Sherlock in the eye, and a vague scent of halitosis joined the ammonia smell. “You hit it too hard?”
“I didn’t get it, at first,” John said. “Even with the books. It didn’t seem possible – what happens in heats. I think I just sort of ignored it, and assumed it wouldn’t actually happen?”
He blinked, slowly, at the screen.
, John silently begged.
“No one apologised to me.”
Sherlock looked stricken. “Cam, I… I never told anyone what I did. I promise, I’ve changed. But…”
“She was like me… well, not like me… but she was…” Sherlock made a gesture at himself that John couldn’t quite interpret. “She died, and her parents buried her in a suit, and they cut her long hair off. Her brother told me. And… and I…” he went very red, and John saw his hands clench. “I don’t want that to be me. I don’t want – don’t want to die, Mycroft, not really. I…”
“I can sort it.”
“I mean hormone delay therapy,” Mycroft leaned down, under the guise of picking a hair off John’s polo shirt.
? He lifted them out.
Sherlock gave a dry sob. ‘That sounds like you, John.’ He leaned against the fence. ‘I’ve missed you.’
“John treated me,” Sherlock added. “Without him… It could have been worse.”
Sherlock traced the illustrated coils of his arms with a finger, taking in how John had captured his body, the shape of him, the dark curls of his hair. It was… it made him feel very strange, inside. “How did you do this?” he asked.
“I understand your concerns,” Mycroft sighed, as Sherlock spilled out his worries in a mess of talk and tears. “I have spoken to John on the phone several times, and he seems incredibly contrite. Would you at least consider visiting?”
“No,” Sherlock shook his head, trying not to notice the wet tracks on his face. “I have scar tissue. It snags. Pulls. Can’t do anything. Side-effect.”
"A brief reply would have done. And anyway, I seem to have gained access to the files," Sherlock spun the monitor around. "Colonel Mathers is rather more invested in keeping this conflict going than she ought to be."
‘You winked.’
‘I know the feeling,’ Sherlock said. John smiled at him.
Throwing his cigarette out of the window after one last inhale, Sherlock pulled his trousers on and tucked his shirt in, tying the emerald green bow tie that had been a present from John’s mother around his neck, fastening his cuffs with the mother of pearl cufflinks John himself had bought him for his last birthday. He breathed out and shrugged his dinner jacket on.
‘You’re hurt,’ John stated, cupping Sherlock’s jaw.
John moaned, the sound broken, brushing his lips against Sherlock’s before wrapping his fingers around Sherlock’s length once again. He looked exactly as John had imagined just a few hours ago; flushed and wanton and so desperately
A fly buzzed around the vase of daisies on the windowsill.
Before he could think better of it, before he could think at all, he scratched out a two-sentence letter to John on a thin piece of paper with his ink pen, folding it and shoving it inside his jacket pocket before it had had time to dry. He bent down to put on his shoes and socks and placed his lighter and cigarettes in his trouser pocket before making his way downstairs, towards where Mycroft’s drawling voice could be heard.
‘Turn around,’ Moriarty growled, scratching his nails down the back of Freddie’s thigh. Freddie straightened up and turned around, leaning against the cubicle wall. He panted for breath, tugging Moriarty closer by his belt. ‘Out of your trousers,’ Moriarty said, unbuttoning his own slacks and pulling his cock out, biting at Freddie’s long, pale neck. Whimpering, Freddie obeyed, yelping in surprise and delight when Moriarty lifted him up and pinned him against the wooden wall.
John didn’t say anything for a moment. ‘I am,’ he said quietly, certainly. ‘So were you.’ He straightened up. ‘Don’t... don’t hurt him again. Please.’
‘Yes,’ John said shortly. Victor nodded. ‘Come on, take your coat off, you’ll catch your death.’
Sherlock smiled. ‘A pirate,’ he said. He let John’s hand go and placed the passionflower in the flask, where it rested on top of the flask’s rounded lip.
They passed another farm. The sun was just going down behind the roof of the farm, where a middle-aged man stood in the broken doorway of his home. Bricks crumbled at his feet, the gate to the field lying in splintered ruin on the soil that had not been ploughed or tilled or had anything sown into it. John lifted his tired gaze to the man’s eyes, turning away with a sigh when the man spat on the ground.
believe it was him--’
‘Incredible what a bombing can do for one’s health and wellbeing,’ Sherlock said, smirking from his chair, blowing a lungful of smoke up towards the ceiling.
‘Oh, likewise, likewise,’ Moriarty said, motioning the girl behind the counter over. ‘Mind if I join you?’ He grabbed a chair from the next table and sat down, moving John and Sherlock’s teapot to make room for his own. ‘I must say, this is quite a revelation,’ he said, smirking across at John as he poured milk into his teacup, his ankle brushing against Sherlock’s thigh when he crossed his legs.
Sherlock stood with a groan, holding the damp cloth to his eye still. John untucked Sherlock’s shirt from his trousers and lifted it, examining the bruises on Sherlock’s pale skin.
Sherlock twitched his lips at John’s rambling and yawned, his mind dazed and empty. He sighed and smiled into his pillow as John continued to talk under his breath as he checked Sherlock for injuries as he always did and rubbed soothing lotion into his arse to stop it from being too sore.
Arching away from the bookshelf, Sherlock spread his legs wider and gasped, eyes wide open.
‘I’m always quiet.’
‘Sherlock, what are you doing?’ John murmured as Sherlock’s pale chest slowly revealed itself, his small, dark nipples a pleasing juxtaposition to his English rose skin. Sherlock threw his shirt to the ground and began to fumble with the buttons on his trousers, which he shoved down his legs. Straightening up, he stared at John, daring him to say something. John swallowed and remained silent, keeping his gaze locked with Sherlock’s.
‘Friend?’ the man’s eyebrows lifted as he looked between Sherlock and John. ‘My my, I was under the impression you didn’t concern yourself with
‘Still just as sharp, then.’ Victor sighed and then smiled at Sherlock again.
‘It’ll have to be without the sour, I’m afraid,’ John replied, smiling back. ‘There’s been a war on, you know.’
‘Oh, I could so easily make your life
Despite John’s best efforts, frustration and ennui set in and Sherlock left London the following morning, a day early. The rest of the day, after his bath, was spent sitting in the living room window, smoking his way through a pack of cigarettes. He would have caught a train back to Bletchley save for the fact it was Easter Monday and there weren't any passenger trains running at all. Sherlock packed quickly on the Tuesday morning, kissed John's troubled face, and arrived back at the Park at one pm, just in time to eat whatever slop was being served in the dining hall.
Sherlock and John were seated side by side at dinner, Mycroft at Mrs Holmes’s right at the head of the table. Sherlock used his little finger to brush against John’s right hand in the lull between the starter and main course, trying to conceal a pleased smile when John hooked his index finger around Sherlock’s. The two of them were largely ignored, the conversation dominated by Gilchrist and his stories about his South African gold mine adventures. Mycroft shot them the occasional look and Sherlock glared back, defiant, his hair falling over one eye.
Sherlock released a shuddering breath and flexed his wrists against John’s hands where they’d settled, wrapped tightly around the thin, wiry joint. ‘Do you want me to spank you, Sherlock?’ he asked as though he was enquiring as to whether Sherlock fancied toast for breakfast, though in a low whisper and with a firm squeeze to his wrists that drove Sherlock to sink his teeth into his bottom lip, and whimper slightly. ‘Hm?’ John said, his nose brushing just behind Sherlock’s ear, his breath ghosting over Sherlock’s skin. Oh, yes. John knew
‘Good. East Gate, do hurry.’ He let himself out, the door slamming behind him. John waited until Lestrade’s heavy, clumping footsteps had gone down the stairs before speaking.
‘Mm. Glad to hear it,’ John murmured, leaning in close and kissing Sherlock as gently as he could. Sherlock lifted one hand out of the bowl of saltwater and gripped John’s bicep through the thick towelling of John’s dressing gown. He sighed, stroking his hand up and down John’s arm as he deepened the kiss. He paid his injuries no mind as he brushed his tongue against John’s, tipping his head backwards when one of John’s hands fisted in his hair.
‘Well, forgive my concern--’
‘Sherlock,’ John said in a warning tone, raising his eyebrows. Sherlock fell silent, his lips pursing.
‘Oh, you’re exactly like your brother described, it’s utterly hilarious. He talks about you so much I feel as if I’ve known you all my life and heard sullenness like that from you thousands of times already. You’re a real character.’
‘There’s an envelope addressed to you on top of the body,’ Lestrade said, direct as always. ‘And this isn’t what you’re thinking.’ Lestrade paused before he continued, his face somewhere between disgust and an expression that looked to be a morbid fascination. ‘It’s a rent boy – full face of makeup, back passage full of… Well.’ Lestrade trailed off, both him and John blushing horribly.
It was late November. For the first time in somewhere near four years, Sherlock and John had a case, one that Sherlock had taken leave specifically for. There’d been a rather gruesome murder that hadn’t been the direct result of the war, and, at a loss, Lestrade had called in on John, who’d got in touch with Sherlock, who, after hearing the details of the case, had caught a train down to London the very next day.
‘Say it, Sherlock,’ John ordered.
‘Hardly as difficult as I could make yours,’ Mycroft said smoothly, glancing behind Sherlock at John.
It was almost too easy. Sherlock pushed one of his tools into the lock on the door of the hospital’s dispensary, checked over his shoulders once, twice again, shifted the pick until he heard a click, and slipped in, closing the door behind him. He flipped the light switch to his left, bathing the narrow room in a yellowy glow. Helpfully, the medicines at Barts were stored alphabetically, and it took a matter of seconds for Sherlock to slip three vials of morphine into his coat pocket, turn the light off and exit the little room.
Nodding, Victor fiddled with his hat. Some rain dripped off him onto the carpet, next to a burnt patch where Sherlock had had a mishap with some toenails and a bunsen burner and some sort of noxious gas. ‘I didn’t realise I had done. Not until... not until Sunday.’
‘You sound rather confident about that.’ John began to limp slowly towards the cloakroom.
‘Yes, mum,’ John replied, closing the butter yellow back door behind himself, stepping into the kitchen. A jar of dark red jam was open on the wooden table, a spoon sticking out of it. John spread the jam thickly on a slice of bread that was under a cloth on the kitchen side with the back of the spoon and walked into the living room, where his mother lay on the chintz sofa, fanning herself. ‘Hello,’ John said around a mouthful of bread and jam.
‘Whyever not?’ Someone’s being delightfully interesting for a change.’
Mrs Holmes talked in hushed tones on the telephone.
Mycroft regarded Sherlock for a moment, sadness pulling at the lines around his eyes and mouth.
‘I’m missing, presumed dead, technically,’ John replied. ‘I was wounded, left behind, somehow managed to drag myself to this place.’ He nodded at the bartender after being handed his usual. ‘Now I’m stuck here, like everyone else.’ He knocked his drink back. ‘You?’
John continued to march forwards, face hard. He pulled his cigarettes out of his pocket and lit one with shaking fingers, inhaling the smoke quickly.
‘I fucking saw that,’ Nettle hissed. ‘Frog cunt. He won’t be fucking laughing when Hitler and his mates bomb the shit out of his fucking farm again.’
Sherlock blew his smoke over his shoulder and grinned.
‘Ah, yes.’ John rolled the paper tightly and licked the edge, folding it down to seal it. He lit the cigarette with the lighter in his own pocket before handing it to Sherlock. ‘I heard about your run-in with the dog.’
Sherlock froze, his fingers wrapped around the handle of the kettle. ‘Of course you are,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry.’ He walked back into the living room and sat on the edge of a chair, clutching his forehead with his hands. ‘I’m sorry, I’m not...’ he waved a hand. ‘I’m not quite right these days.’ He lifted his eyes to Nettle. ‘Did it hurt?’
‘Sherlock finds you interesting.’
‘No. No, I don’t imagine they are.’ Sherlock smiled at John and began to tap his knee in time with the beat of the song being played.
Harry squeezed his hand tightly and nodded. ‘Should auld acquaintance be forgot...’ she sang softly. John smiled and joined in, mimicking their mother’s accent.
‘I can help.’ Sherlock pushed his lips against John’s. ‘Let me help.’
‘Sir, I’m sorry, but this is information you specifically requested to receive if and when it became available.’
‘No, not...’ John laughed and let Sherlock’s shirt fall, the cotton hanging over his wrist. ‘Not for that. Just.. come and sleep.’
‘Hello, love. How’s everyone up at the big house?’ She held out her hand and John took it, sitting down on the stool next to her.
, the warm sensation of John’s come falling in thin ropes onto Sherlock’s very red arse.
‘Where have you been?’ Mycroft hissed, appearing from nowhere and grabbing Sherlock’s arm, which was quickly shaken off.
‘Jackson?’ Mycroft said as he sidestepped down the damp stone stairs of the boathouse a few minutes after Sherlock had been, holding his torch aloft. ‘Pierrot, are you down here?’ He sighed through his nose, dragon-like, when the light revealed only a cantankerous goose. He walked through the boathouse and began to pick his way up the rocky path on its opposite side.
‘What gave it away, my crooked bottom tooth?’
‘Nothing,’ Sherlock said. ‘You can do nothing.’
‘Hello,’ John said quietly to Sherlock whilst her back was turned, squeezing his arm.
And walk John did. He felt that his life had become a never-ending march towards some unspecified goal he was always kept in the dark about. He knew the story, though. A tactical retreat. France was beyond help and they were running away. Back over the channel. Back home.
Back in London, John had just finished seeing to the blackout precautions when there was a knock at the front door. Mrs Hudson was still in Kent until tomorrow so John made his way clumsily down the stairs with his stick, flipping the lamp on in the hallway to better see who it was. He pulled the door open, raising his eyebrows in surprise at the sight of Victor Trevor on the doorstep in civilian clothes, drenched through from the rain that had started to pour an hour ago.
‘Go on, then!’
Chopin’s Nocturne No. 5 drifted downstairs from Sherlock’s flat.
‘I don’t care if it was a gift from President Roosevelt, it is not suitable for dinner.’
‘Where’s my hat?’ Sherlock mumbled, resting his right hand over the worst of his injuries.
‘I know you don’t like it.’
‘verse: everyone on earth has a limit of 167 words they can say, per day.
‘No missing teeth?’
The rain started to come down hard, pelting at the windows
‘Kiss me,’ Sherlock demanded, eyes half-lidded as he gazed up at John, lust-drunk and pink-cheeked and beatific. ‘Kiss me.’
Sherlock sighed and winked, making a clicking noise with his mouth.
‘Yes, yes, I’m coming,’ John muttered, unlocking the door and opening it a crack. ‘Harry?’ he whispered when he saw who was on the other side, letting the door fall open wider.
‘You did very well to get off so lightly, let’s put it that way,’ John said softly, turning his head so he could look at the paper as well.
‘How are... how are your family?’
‘Sherlock!’ Mycroft exclaimed, smiling again as his brother entered the room.
The bushes rustled as the one disturbed made his escape.
John tucked the blankets tight around her and kissed her forehead. ‘We’ll talk in the morning. Go to sleep, hm?’
‘Shh,’ John murmured, tilting Sherlock’s chin up, kissing him sweetly. ‘Pay them no mind. They can’t hurt you, not here, not whilst you have me.’
He parted his hair on the side as he always did, sighing as it curled and flicked out. It was utterly hopeless. He combed the rest of it quickly and left it to do whatever it would undoubtedly do anyway, with or without his input. Peering into the mirror, Sherlock growled in the back of his neck at the sight of a small cluster of white-headed pimples on his forehead, just slightly to the left of where his hair usually fell. He looked young, far too young, with his razor nicks and scattered spots and his awkward, overlarge limbs.
“I do,” John pointed out.
Sherlock didn’t frot against the man for long. He soon pulled away, making John look up in need, before quickly, with the speed of his kind, discarding John’s belt, trouser buttons and zip and pulling off his jeans without any preamble.
He walked the rest of the way home, ignoring his stomach, which complained in hunger, and his legs, which were aching. He didn’t really think of anything until he’d locked his room door, and was sitting on his bed in silence.
“Yes, well, I dislike having unfinished tasks.”
The smell of death was on the air, indeed. But it was mixed with life, and the living scent of John Watson’s blood. Though it was weak. They had hurt John. Perhaps very badly, if the death-scent was anything to go by. Broken his limbs, perhaps. Dead tissue had a distinct stink, and Sherlock realised that was what was gathering on his tongue.
“He gets cold,” he explained. “Even though he’s dressed, he… struggles to stay a good temperature.”
‘He’s just taken her for a walk. We didn’t want to wake you, you’ve had quite an ordeal.’
“Why are you still here? John’s –”
“No,” Sherlock said firmly. “I don’t.”
Sherlock heard the taxi pull up in front of the flats. He stood up from the little table in the living room, and watched through the net curtain as John clambered out, and shut the cab door behind himself. The cab drove off, but John stood on the pavement for a moment, looking straight ahead, presumably at the front door.
he thought as the wind caught under his coat.
“A bit,” Sherlock licked his lower lip as John de-robed, dropping his jumper and undoing his jeans, kicking off his socks in the same motion, as Sherlock toed his own off. They both kept their underwear on, and Sherlock welcomed John back with open arms, and lay happily, accepting soft kisses as John pressed their bare limbs and chests together.
“I’m not leaving you here on your own.”
,” John snapped. “You should realise something is wrong, and do something about it. God, you should smell the tension in the air, at least.”
Humans moved the bodies of their dead. Had ceremony over them. Disposed of them in various ways. John would have wanted to have a – a funeral. He would have been furious to know Sherlock had abandoned his body in a derelict building.
He spun around, to find himself face to face with Sherlock, who looked less tired and thin, but warier than he had in January. ‘Sherlock! I didn’t think you’d come.’ John grinned. ‘Shit. I mean, I am glad you’re here, but…’
“I’m not doing anything!”
John’s dad suddenly looked uncomfortable. “Look… you know about alphas and omegas, yeah? Have you done that at school?”
Rid of everything.
John gave a lop-sided smile. “She is yours.”
. And you will do the work to make up.” She roared at Sherlock all the way to her office, making him wince and want to cry. Surely this was the drug making him sad? He didn’t normally feel this…
“Captain Watson,” the alpha desk corporal saluted, before indicating the chair. “I’ve got your address down as the hostel on Haliday Street, correct, sir?”
The car was gone before he could even process it.
Greg’s face softened a little. “It depends. Sometimes victims can give their testimony via video call… but if Siger and his lawyers wanted to question your story –”
"I can't imagine you in 1600's fashion, Sherlock."
“Oh. No, there’s no postmark from the Yard…” Sherlock tore the plastic off, and looked at the cardboard box inside. “Strange,” he said. “Why would they wrap it in plastic as well?” He tore through the cardboard edge with his fingers, and popped the lid.
John raised his hand, then panicked, and let it drop, knowing he was going stupidly red.
The vampire heard John enter, stopping halfway in the room. He didn't open his eyes as John took quiet steps towards him. John’s heartbeat was close as the soldier loomed over.
this person.
John went out, and let the door rest slightly open in the catch as he moved to the wall to lean, and gather himself.
John darted forward, and pulled Sherlock down by his t-shirt, into a proper kiss, on the lips.
“Ha.” John looked at him. “So, what happened to you?”
Sherlock pressed his lips together. His hands moved from John’s, up the omega’s arms, moving over to his waist, to his back, loosely holding his back and waist. All the while, his face stayed still.
“Good team in the field, too,” Greg raised his wine glass. “Don’t tell anyone I said that.”
“I know that,” An irritable voice snapped back. It was a voice much deeper than a year ago. Sherlock had stormed into puberty, coming out the other side with a deep baritone voice, a very masculine jaw, and a trail of hair from his navel that any hedge-grower would be proud of.
“No.”
Finding that fine line between clingy and comforting was not John’s strong point. Having lived alone for so long, and now being so in love, it was difficult to know how much to leave Sherlock alone. The young omega’s mood-swings were still going, and sometimes he’d come to John for a cuddle, only to push him away and sulk in his room for hours. Sometimes he’d sit working quietly at the table, and then act offended that John hadn’t come over to kiss him. On the flipside, John welcomed every touch Sherlock chose to give him with open arms. But Sherlock was his own person, and if he wasn’t naturally a hugger, then John couldn’t force him to be.
John wondered if he should have come at all. But, maybe if he hadn’t, Sherlock would have gone to Victor, to comfort him. But the man didn’t deserve to be ignored… John was tearing his life in half. None of this was Victor’s fault.
Everyone shuddered.
Sherlock didn’t hesitate before offering to take care of him.
“How tall are you now?” he asked.
They stared at each other again, the music from the house like a horrible backdrop.
John pinched himself. "Not a dream, then... It happened." He took several deep breaths, willing away the start of the erection he was sporting, which didn’t take too much effort. It was probably a good thing he didn’t feel too well. The last thing he wanted was for Sherlock to come back and see him like that, again. The mer-man might take it as a sign that John wanted another… examination. Not that he
“Oh, fuck,” John’s arm gave way, and he dropped the weight, stepping back quickly to save his toes. “Sorry.”
“…months ago.”
Sherlock took his brother outside to speak to him, and he came back in alone.
“I’m so deep inside you,” Sherlock moaned. “Oh god, John….” He thrust up harder.
Sherlock raised his head as the door to the lounge opened. He breathed in sharply, the familiar scent hitting the back of his throat.
Victor shrugged. “… in my eyes, it could have been worse. I was prepared to overlook it.”
“What’re you doing?” Sholto half-laughed.
It could never be Sherlock.
tutor.”
John had followed the case as much as he could from his hospital bed, but it seemed to him that Sherlock was being led on a wild goose chase as much as anything else. The vampire who sent the silver hadn’t made contact again, and there were no new clues.
Omega instincts grew stronger in pregnancy, he knew that, but that didn’t seem natural at all. It had felt… alright. And awful, at the same time.
“Not special, as such,” he said. “There’s a girl called Molly, and… and… I don’t have a best friend,” he lied.
“I don’t know. Some people say it’s better because it’s like a pure form of love, your bond? But then… omegas can be bonded without falling in love first. They don’t always get a choice.”
He pressed back with his own leg, and found the pressure returned.
Sherlock gave the newspaper sign another glance as the lights changed and he walked across. He needed to clear his head. Perhaps Molly was still at work. She tended to be, in case he needed her. Sentiment. And yet it worked to his advantage. It hadn’t always been the way. On the very rare occasional instances Sherlock had indulged in sentimentality, it had never worked out in his favour. Molly was both proof and denial of that. Perhaps that was why Sherlock kept her around.
John shut his eyes for a moment. “I can smell them,” he said. “They’re so close. I could just…”
John looked at him. “Loneliness, I think. I… I was tired and alone, and you were there, and I trusted  - still trust – you. Have you ever heard of skin hunger? It’s a desire for touch – people can go mad from it, from lack of touch. It was like being brought back from the brink, in a lot of ways. I know you… wanted more from it. But to me… it was like a massage, or something.”
