"What?" John asked.
"Sherlock, there's no case!" The Inspector called back to him as John limped out of the room to find Sherlock stopped on the stairs.
"Yes, when you said we were going to the bank..." John joked looking around the posh bank that Sebastian worked at. Hearing John joking again made a weight fall off Sherlock's shoulders. John was happy again. It would seem a case was the exact thing John needed. Sherlock smirked at him before looking around the bank as he lead John to the escalators. Multiple time zones. The Bank is open at all hours. Card swipes. Keeping tabs on who was coming and going. Elevators only went to the 42nd floor. Building is 42 stories. This was not some normal break in.
"So, the shooter. No sign?" Sherlock asked and John had to remind himself to keep breathing.
"Text, yes. The number on my desk." Sherlock said as a plan started to slowly form. John took his phone back from Sherlock as he took a deep breath, catching a faint yet very familiar scent on John. That scent sent Sherlock's mind into over drive. It couldn't be possible? Why was that scent there? It shouldn't be there! That scent should never be on John! Sherlock was barely able to fight the urge to jump up and replace that scent with his own.
"What did you think?" Sherlock asked running his eyes over John's face as he remembered what he had read the night before. And whatever Sherlock had seen on John face caused the Alpha's excitement to fade.
"The Jaria Diamond's gone missing. They want me to find it." Sherlock muttered. So John wasn't upset with him not being able to find a case interesting enough to leave the flat? Then what was bothering John? But John had left the flat before Sherlock had time to figure it out. Sherlock sighed and looked around the flat as his mind raced to figure out what was wrong with his John.
"Oh, Mrs Hudson, the landlady, she's given me a special deal. Owes me a favour." Sherlock said nonchalantly. "Few years back, her Mate got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out."
"Who is he?" John asked.
"There's a hole in our security. Find it and we'll pay you, five figures." Sebastian said and Sherlock notice John trying not to look interested. He balled his hands at that and shoved them into his coat pockets, they were not that desperate for money. Sebastian pulled out a check and held it out for Sherlock to take. "This is an advance. Tell me how he got in. There's a bigger one on its way."
"Yes, Mr. Wilkes has been expecting you." She said. "I'll have someone show you to his office." Before Sherlock could deny the offer, another Beta, this time male, appeared next to them.
"Mrs Hudson's got a phone." John pointed out.
"What are you doing?" Sherlock growled releasing John's hand and storming over to Lestrade who was lounging in Sherlock's chair as if he owned it.
"But the police don't go to private detectives." That caused the Alpha to smile at him.
"No, she never got to the hotel. Look at her hair. She colour-coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She'd never have left any hotel with her hair still looking..." Sherlock had figured something else out. "Oh... Oh!"
"Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection, tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man's phone, never see a drunks' without them." He said finally handing John his phone back. "There you go. See you were right."
"How was it?" Sherlock asked.
John finally shook himself out of his stupor and moved to sit down. His leg was suddenly bothering him and he needed to sit and rest it. "I looked you up on the Internet last night." John informed Sherlock who spun around to look at him with barely hidden excitement.
"I've got the cab number." John informed Sherlock when he stopped after the taxi had vanished from sight.
"Thanks." John told him before looking at the menu. After John placed an order of pasta they sat in silence for a couple minutes with half of Sherlock's brain focused on watching the street and the other half wondering what John was thinking about. "People don't have arch-enemies." John suddenly said catching Sherlock off guard after he had gotten his food.
"I'd rather stand, thank you." John told him in mock politeness.
"He won't hurt you, John." Sherlock told him firmly.
"Partner? Really?" He challenged.
"I'd say private detective."
"It's obvious, isn't it?" Sherlock asked.
"Most people blunder round this city, and all they see are streets and shops and cars. When you walk with Sherlock Holmes, you see the battlefield. You've seen it already. Haven't you?" The man asked.
"Means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me." Sherlock told him.
"He just took off. He does that." The Beta told him.
"She's dead." Lestrade told him.
"Couldn't Harry help?" Mike asked.
"I've absolutely no idea."
"She flirted with you." Sherlock growled.
"Why would she think of her daughter in her last moments? Yup, sociopath, I'm seeing it now." Anderson said.
"No, I..." Sherlock started glancing at John when his hand began to tremble. John wanted to hurt Sebastian.
"So, bad day was it?" Molly asked with an awkward chuckle to hide the fear watching him whip the body had given her. Sherlock ignored her and took out his trusty notebook and began to write his observations about the body and the whipping down.
"Upstairs." The Inspector told him. After both Alpha's waited for John to finish putting on the suit, they began to walk away. John followed after them as quick as he could limp and nearly screamed in annoyance when they began heading up three flights of stairs. "I can give you two minutes."
John looked up at Sherlock when his phone alerted him that he had a text message. He read it and got a strange look in his eyes as he looked out the door. The cabbie that had come to get him turned and walked back down the stairs.
"What do real people have, then, in their real lives?" He asked.
"That's brilliant." John breathed out not even realizing he has said something until Sherlock was looking at him shocked. "Sorry." He muttered in embarrassment.
"It's a drug's bust, Mrs Hudson." John told her.
"This is an old friend of mine, John Watson." Mike introduced. Sherlock carefully took the phone from John instantly noticing the tan did not go past his wrist and began to send his text.
"Yes, that's the woman's number. Yes, that's her suitcase. Can we please move on." Sherlock said.
"Yes." John said never taking his eyes off the Alpha that stalked closer to him.
"So why are you talking to me?" John asked. Why wouldn't Sherlock want to talk to him? John was interesting and found his deductions amazing rather than annoying. But he couldn't let John know that, he might get the wrong idea.
"We're obviously looking at a suicide." Dimmok informed his team who were documenting any evidence in the rest of the apartment.
"Why not?" Sherlock asked.
"Size eight feet. Small, but athletic." The killer had been in the house. John rang the doorbell once more as Sherlock took note of a smudge on the glass of a picture frame. "Small, strong hands. Our acrobat. Why didn't he close the window when he left..." He was still in the house. "Oh, stupid, stupid! Obvious. He's still here." Where was he hiding? Behind the changing screen? Sherlock carefully walked over to the changing screen and looked behind it only to have something thrown around his throat.
"Brilliant! Yes! Ah! Four serial suicides, and now a note." Sherlock said excitedly as he danced around the room. Who was this Alpha and why was he so excited over this news? "Oh, it's Christmas. Mrs Hudson, I'll be late. Might need some food." He told Mrs Hudson as began to put his jacket on.
"Yeah, Sergeant Donovan." John said and Sherlock growled. What had that stupid Beta woman told his John? If she scared John away from him, he would make her life a living hell.
"Interesting." Sherlock drawled as he released John's hand to reach into his pocket to pull out a his phone.
"Look at you, all happy. It's not decent." Mrs Hudson told him with a small smirk.
"What do you think, then, Dr. Watson?" Mrs Hudson asked. "There's another bedroom upstairs, if you'll be needing two bedrooms." She mentioned as Sherlock took off his coat and scarf.
"I understand, dear, I've got a hip." Mrs Hudson told him sympathetically.
"You gave him the Hong Kong accounts." John stated the obvious receiving a look from the Alpha that was silently telling him to 'keep his Omega mouth shut' causing both John and Sherlock to growl at him.
"I'll explain later." Sherlock whispered soothingly before turning his attention back to Lestrade. "I'm not your sniffer dog."
"It was harmless." John tried to defend.
"What do they say?" John asked.
"An ex-" John started before he closed his eyes in slight annoyance, it would seem that he would have to get used to finding random body parts around the house if he were to stay here with Sherlock. "Sherlock, if I designate a certain place in the fridge for your experiments, would you actually use it?" His answer was a sigh and John gave his own sigh before he spun on the balls of his feet. "If you don't, then I
"Hello." Sherlock called as he paid the taxi.
"But the evidence." John stated weakly. "You said that the bedroom door was locked form the inside, and you had to clime down the balcony just to get in." He said watching Sherlock open a suitcase and began rummage through it.
." The woman muttered.
"Oh, dear. They're making such a mess. What are they looking for?" Mrs Hudson asked.
"Right, how about we get some coffee and catch up?" Mike asked unsure. John was torn, part of him wanted to be alone and mope about what had happened to him while the other half was afraid of what he would do to himself if he were alone.
Once he had his breath again, Sherlock stumbled his way to the front door."The milk's gone off and the washing started to smell. Somebody left here in a hurry three days ago." Sherlock croaked out the second he opened the door. At hearing the state his voice was in, John's anger immediately faded only to be replaced with concern.
"It's an experiment!" He growled out and John made a mental note to bleach the microwave once the experiment was done.
"Sherlock!" Lestrage growled.
"But it's all computer-generated, " Sherlock finished leading John up the stairs to the National Gallery, "electronic codes, electronic ciphering methods. This is different. It's an ancient device. Modern code-breaking methods won't unravel it." Instead of going into the National Gallery like John expected, Sherlock began to lead him to the side of the building.
"Well, it had to be pink, obviously." Sherlock said.
"This is what you wanted, isn't it?" Dimmok bit out. "The journalist's diary?" John took the diary from the Alpha and flipped through it until he found the page he needed, which also happened to be bookmarked by plane ticket for Dalian.
"New Breitling. Only came out this February." Sherlock said and smirked when John breathed out his amazement.
"Just met a friend of yours." John informed him. Friend? He was calling himself Sherlock's friend now?
"Sorry, I've got a gap." The PA told him causing Sherlock to bite back a growl. "I have all his receipts." She told him quickly, obviously having seen his annoyance, before leading him back to her desk where she showed him the box with all of Van Coon's receipt.
"So what were we doing there?" John asked.
"I'm not his date." John muttered awkwardly. It hurt to hear John say that, did John not want to be his date?
"He's not just going to ring the doorbell. He'd need to be mad." John told him.
"Ignore all that. It's just the, er, the shock talking." Sherlock said before heading towards John.
"So, you're doing well. You've been abroad a lot." Sherlock stated causing Sebastian to smirk proudly.
"Well, I doubt it, since she's been dead for 14 years. Technically she was never alive." Lestrade said and John sucked in a breath at that causing Sherlock to tighten his hold for a second. "Rachel was Jennifer Wilson's stillborn daughter, 14 years ago."
"Yes." Sherlock agreed proudly. "Yes, I think so, my thoughts precisely."
"Mrs Hudson took my skull." Sherlock said nodding towards the mantel where his skull had once been before Mrs Hudson had cleaned and straightened up. Sherlock opened the coat closet and took his and John's coats out.
"Guys, we're also looking for a mobile somewhere here, belonged to the victim..." Lestrade said obviously ignoring what John had told him. John groaned and sat back in the desk chair running his hands through his hair going over everything that night. Sherlock had asked some questions earlier that night, questions neither of them had the answer to. Maybe if John could figure out that answers then they could solve the case.
"I'm amazed you didn't notice, all you have to do is look around this flat." Sherlock said with a mocking smirk. "Coffee table on the left-hand side, coffee mug handle pointing to the left. Power sockets, habitually used the ones on the left. Pen and paper on the left hand side of the phone because he picked it up with his right and took down messages with his left. Need I go on?"
upset her?" Sherlock asked. "It wasn't me that upset her, Mycroft."
"What if one of them was light-fingered?" Sherlock asked.
"No." Sherlock said.
"No." John said through clenched teeth. John did not
"They were in the microwave." Sally said.
"It's a 15." John said as they stopped at a vendor along the road. "What we thought was the artist's tag, it's a number 15."
"Who, Sherlock Holmes? Yeah, I can see that." John told her.
"This is my partner, John Watson." Sherlock introduced laying a possessive hand on John's shoulder, happy that the Omega didn't say anything about it. Sebastian gave him an unbelieving look.
"There is a security camera on the building to your left." A man said over the phone. "Do you see it?"
"Where are you going?" John asked.
"Well, we've got two away on holiday this week and one's left to have a baby." She squeaked out tucking a piece of hair behind her ear. John looked at her wondering what she was meaning by that. "It might be a bit mundane for you." That caused John to chuckle. Having something mundane to ground you every now and then was good when you were with Sherlock.
"Why, because you don't like him?" John snapped, this woman was asking to get punched. He might not have known Sherlock very long, but he could tell that the Alpha was a decent guy, a bit eccentric and probably slightly childish, but still a decent guy.
"Should I be? You don't seem very frightening." John challenged causing the man to give a small laugh.
"It's an experiment." Sherlock told him calmly as his body relaxed.
"Upstairs." She told them. Sherlock gripped John's hand and quickly lead them up the stairs to find Lestrade and his team tearing up the place.
"It's a three-patch problem." Sherlock told the Omega stapling his hands under his chin to try and come up with a plan to show John he could walk without letting John know that was what he was doing. Proving to John that he could walk without a limp wouldn't work if John figured out that was what Sherlock was doing.
"You know why he's here?" Donovan asked with a condescending look. "He's not paid or anything. He
"Well, obviously I can, um," Sherlock awkwardly cleared his throat, "straighten things up a bit."
"Crime scene. Next?" Sherlock said.
The night quickly flew by with John up half the night reading Sherlock's blog that he found. And was shocked when he woke up and left the apartment without contemplating taking his life or not. One meeting with Sherlock and he wanted to live. This made John want to meet the Alpha and get to know him, and not in the 'I want to mate with you' kind of way. He respected Sherlock's wish to not want a Mate, he wanted to be friends with the guy.
"Yes, of course." Mycroft said honestly.
"Her case..." Sherlock told him.
"Sister!" The Alpha hissed out storming past John and over to the tape. "There's always something." He pouted as a young, black Beta glared at Sherlock when they got close enough.
"You blacked out?" John asked in concern.
"Oh." John muttered as Sherlock shot from his place beside him and began to try and rearrange some things. "So this is all...?" John stuttered out.
"I never guess." Sherlock bragged.
"I need to know what bruises form in the next 20 minutes. A man's alibi depends on it. Text me." Sherlock told her barely looking at her.
"No, that's... That's not right. How? Why would she do that? Why?" Sherlock asked.
"How do you mean?" John asked.
"Your deodorant told me that." Sherlock said.
"Yes." John growled out.
"Dam my leg!" John growled out loudly scaring Mrs Hudson and causing guilt to take the place of his annoyance. "Sorry, I'm so sorry." He told her honestly. "It's just sometimes this bloody thing..."
"I hope I'm not distracting you." The man said.
"This symbol, I still can't place it." Sherlock glared at the wall of clues before spinning on the balls of his feet. "You had your fill?" He asked. "Good." He continued not giving John time to answer verbally. "I need you to go to the police station and ask about the journalist," He said pulling John from his seat, a surge of annoyance flew through John for a second before leaving, "his personal effects would've been impounded." Sherlock informed him as he slipped John coat onto him. "Get hold of his diary or something that will tell us his movements."
"But you're staring." John pointed out.
"He was waiting for the killer." Sherlock interrupted him with annoyance clear in his voice. "He'd been threatened."
"You know how they never leave notes?" The Alpha asked.
"Actually, we've just locked our keys in the flat." Sherlock told her.
"But they take the poison themselves. They chew, swallow the pills themselves. There are clear signs, even you lot can't miss them." Sherlock said before continuing down the stairs.
"The engraving?" John asked.
"There was no hurry." But as Sherlock said this, he realized it was only partially true. It was true there was no hurry regarding the case, but once Sherlock had realized John wasn't with him, he had wanted John with him as soon as possible. John sighed and pulled out his phone.
"Good shot." Sherlock whispered as he pulled away from the kiss.
"It happened last night." Sherlock informed him. "Journalist shot dead in his flat. Doors locked, windows bolted from the inside. Exactly the same as Van Coon."
"I didn't say anything." Lestrade said.
"Sorry?" Lestrade asked.
"What point?" John asked.
"What?" The Detective asked as Sherlock stormed over to his coat and scarf.
Sherlock kicked the swordsman in the side, just knowing John was going to see the scratch and become even more upset. After a few hard kick's to the side, the swordsman stumbled back. "That is oak!" Sherlock growled before punching him again, this time knocking him out. Sherlock angrily fixed his suit once again before going to check the table. The scratch was clear as day, there would be no hiding that. And there was no time to order another table to get here before John got back from shopping.
"And?" The Detective questioned.
"Oh, hold on!" Dimmok hissed back.
"Two men, travel back from China, both head straight for the Lucky Cat emporium." John said sipping on his drink as Sherlock began to try to figure out what the numbers stood for, but the close quarters in which their table sat in caused John's scent to quickly surround him bringing that strange tingling sensation in around his groin to back stronger. "What did they see?"
By the time John had made it down the stairs and had taken the suit off, it was clear the Sherlock was long gone when he looked for him as he limped out of the house. John shook his head and gave a small laugh, Sherlock was just like an over excited boy forgetting everything else besides his new toy. It was adorable. John began to limp towards the tape intending to find a taxi and get home to wait for Sherlock to get back.
"We're dealing with a killer who can climb." Sherlock told him as he opened the skylight.
"I thought bankers were all supposed to be heartless bastards." John joked angrily before they, too, left the bathroom, only they didn't go back to the table like Sebastian, they left the restaurant completely.
"Okay. Give me." Lestrade ordered.
"Doesn't it?" Sherlock asked going back to watching the street. "Sounds a bit dull." He wanted John to drop this subject.
"So what do we do now? Sit here and wait for him to come back?" John asked starting to lightly shiver from the cold. Sherlock, who was looking around them, gently pulled John to him causing him to blush. John didn't think he would ever get used to Sherlock showing him affection, it just didn't seem to go with him. He hadn't known Sherlock very long, but in his mind the words 'Sherlock' and 'affection' just did not mesh. And yet, Sherlock was constantly showing John some kind of affection, be it by holding his hand, wrapping an arm around him, or hugging him close.
"Uh... Anthea." She said, obviously a fake name.
"May need longer." Sherlock told him, and was John imagining things or had Sherlock just slowed down when he had begun struggling?
Sherlock quickly made his way to the door so he could leave before John could tell him to piss off like all the others did. He opened the door and was half way out of the room before he remembered John had initially wanted his name and the address. "The name's Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street." And with a wink, Sherlock flew out of the room and back towards the morgue.
After lunch, Sherlock would finally emerge from his mind palace before checking his e-mails for cases. He would spend the next few hours sitting in his chair solving boring cases that he didn't need to be there to solve as John sat across from him in his chair looking for work. Around dinner time Sherlock would have John order whatever he wanted and they would eat, well, John would eat and Sherlock would nibble to keep John from gripping at him. And then at night after John had showered and changed, Sherlock would lead him to their room and hold him all night.
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock demanded.
"Wrong country, good alibi." John said.
"No, she was leaving an angry note in German." Sherlock snapped out causing John to bite back a laugh. "Of course she was writing Rachel, no other word it can be. Question is, why did she wait until she was dying to write it?"
"Look across the street. Taxi. It's stopped. Nobody getting in, and nobody getting out." John turned to look. "Why a taxi? Oh, that's clever. Is it clever? Why is it clever?"
"Right." Sebastian scoffed. "You're doing that thing." He was checking John out again with a condensing smile. "We were at Uni together, and this guy here had a trick he used to do." He was trying to put John off of him. To bad it would work. John
"No. No, he wasn't, really, was he?" Sherlock said thoughtfully.
"No." John whispered and Sherlock's eyes suddenly became guarded.
"Hello. Thank you." John said stepping in as Sherlock followed him.
"What is it?" John asked.
"Keep your voice down." John giggled out receiving a disgusted look, either from laughing to Sherlock's arm around him. "Sorry, it's just, erm, nerves, I think."
"SooLin Yao." Sherlock told him with a cough.
"I don't know." Sherlock growled out, the thought of John with someone else angered him for reasons he did not want to admit to. Something about John made Sherlock want to be with him. He knew he should hate that, knew he should push John away like he did everyone else that tried to get too close, yet, he couldn't. He wanted John to be close to him. "I just... I don't know. I've never wanted a Mate. Never wanted to get close to anyone. This is new."
"Mrs Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?" He asked. "Get vehicles, get a helicopter. We're gonna have to move fast. This phone battery won't last forever."
"Not to me." John said shaking his head.
"And what's that?" John asked.
"He was a smuggler, now why does that not surprise me?" John bit out with and eye roll.
"Sherlock?" John called again. Something wasn't right, he was positive that the phone had not been in the flat before. He had texted it and whoever had the phone called back. So why was the phone now in the flat?
?" A woman asked cautiously as Sherlock smiled into the little Camera attached to her the buzzer.
"Did you see his watch?" Sherlock asked taking John by the hand as they got off the first escalator and began to walk towards the second one.
"There wasn't a case." The Inspector told Sherlock who had knelt down to examine the woman again. This news caused Sherlock to shoot back up with an excited look in his eyes.
"There wasn't a case. There was never any suitcase." The Inspector told him and Sherlock was out the door.
Mike had been one of the few students that didn't seem to mind that he was an Omega, the only Omega, in their class. Had even stood up for him a few times when some of the other Betas and even a few Alphas had tried to bully him into quitting.
"Not your housekeeper!" She told him sternly as he saw the picture of the Alpha that had just been in their flat. A Detective Inspector Lestrade.
"I'm just going to get us some food, Sherlock. I'll be back." John told him before peeking him on the lips. "What's this case you've been offered."
"Where?" Sherlock asked the Alpha before he could catch his breath and say anything.
"Yes, John." Anthea said with a smirk, proving him right.
"I know exactly who that is." Sherlock growled before leading John over to the man.
"Do you think maybe you could let me in this time?" John called out to him, having realized by now that the change in John's scent was too distracting right now and the fact that he really needed to focus at the moment, Sherlock chose to ignore John. "Can you not keep doing this, please?" John growled out. Sherlock checked the milk in the fridge, it had spoiled.
John went into Doctor mode. He took a deep breath and noticed that she was not actually an Omega, but a Beta hiding her scent and using Omega based products to smell like one. But other than that there was no other smells. He glanced up at Sherlock who was watching him. Was this a test? It was obvious that this woman had taken poison, she was the fourth suicide victim. John checked her skin and noticed no discolorization. If this was a test, what was he supposed to find that hadn't already been mention in the papers? After checking everything he could think of, John looked over at Sherlock.
"Where is it? Quickly, where?" Sherlock asked running over to him.
"What are you doing?" Dimmok asked.
"Yes, because you need me." Sherlock said in a tone that stated this was then end of that discussion. The Inspector sighed in resigned annoyance before leaving the room. John sighed and hobbled over to the body before using his cane to ease down to the floor. Once he was safely on the floor, Sherlock, who had been hovering slightly, knelt beside him.
"I'm your landlady, dear, not your housekeeper." Mrs Hudson told Sherlock who just seemed to ignore her.
"What are you doing?" John asked, and normally Sherlock wouldn't answer a question like that, but seeing as John had asked, it wouldn't hurt to answer him.
"Van Coon. The police are at his flat." John growled out, he wanted this conversation to be done and over with so that they could leave and return home.
"Are these human eyes?" Sally asked holding a jar of eyes.
"I am clean!" Sherlock roared.
"Sebastian." Sherlock greeted back.
"Dinner?" Sherlock asked.
"Oh, I wouldn't say that." Sherlock said and John's heart jumped, would Sherlock really tell the police it was him?
"Huh?" John asked.
"Password!" Sherlock looked at him. "It's her password. Rachel is her password." Sherlock's face lit up.
"Ah, Mr. Holmes." John said hoping he didn't sound too happy to see the man.
"In his mind, certainly. If you were to ask him, he'd probably say his arch-enemy. He does love to be dramatic." The man said getting a far off look to his eyes. John looked around the room dramatically.
"She's German." Anderson announced from the door way as Sherlock began to dig in the inside pocket of his jacket before pulling out his phone. "
"Nicotine patch." He said showing the patches to the Omega. "Helps me think. Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work."
Sherlock prided himself on being able to control his baser instincts. He knew he could be in the presents of an Omega in heat and not succumb to the desire to mount them and mate them. He knew this because he had tested this. Sherlock had willingly entered a room with an Omega in heat, alone, and had absolutely no desire to mate with them. He had only done so to prove a point to his brother that he, in no way, desired a Mate.
"Stole something. Something form the hoard." Sherlock said.
"What?" John asked.
"Well, you're the one who shot him." Sherlock said.
"He has killed four people." Sherlock reminded John.
"Yeah, I see it." John said.
"Nothing." Sebastian growled out hating talking to an Omega about this. "Just left a little message." They came to the office door and Sebastian had to use his keycard, that he already had out, to unlock it. Always kept locked. In the office two spray painted symbols were noticeable. One symbol was on the wall next to the portrait of the formal chairman, and the other symbol was across the eyes of the portrait.
"I'm guessing he won't be back." John said in understanding.
"I-" John started before stopping to gather his thoughts, Sherlock let him as he continued to stare out the window. "You don't want a Mate." At that Sherlock looked at John. So John knew about that. "Mike informed me of that. And well, I'm... I'm-"
"Put the wind up everybody, we hated him." Sebastian growled out, trying to get John to pay attention to him. Sherlock's smirk widen and he sat up a little straighter. John didn't want any other Alpha, and Sherlock was going to make damn sure it staid like that. "We'd come down to breakfast in the formal hall and this freak-"
"I said could you pass me a pen?" Sherlock growled the second he had stepped into the flat causing John to pause.
"Hungry?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock went to the back of the taxi to were the passenger was sitting and threw the door open. After taking one look at the passenger he groaned in annoyance. "No..." He said shaking his head. "Teeth, tan. What, Californian?" He asked before checking the man's luggage that was at his feet. "LA, Santa Monica. Just arrived."
"You're the second person to say that to me today." Mike said still chuckling. That shocked John. There was someone else out there who was having trouble finding someone to live with? Were they just as broken as him? His curiosity had peeked enough that he couldn't stop himself from asking who it was. At that Mike smiled mischievously. "He's an unusual Alpha that claims to not want a mate, Omega or otherwise."
"I've been offered a case." Sherlock told him, had them not having a case to work on upset John? Would he leave because of this? That got Sherlock up off the couch and over to John before he could even comprehend what he was doing. John looked at him in annoyance before understanding flashed through his eyes.
"Two men have been murdered, Raz. Deciphering this is the key to finding out who killed them." Sherlock told him. Raz looked from the phone to at both Sherlock and John in disbelief.
"So's Sergeant Donovan." Sherlock pointed out causing Donovan to look scandalized while Anderson whipped around to look at her in shock and, was that fear? "Ooh... I think it just vaporized." Sherlock said while taking a deep breath. "May we go in?"
"Not the murderer." John said.
"All of it?" Lestrade asked.
"So where are we?" Sherlock asked looking away from John once he was sure he would not ask anymore stupid question.
"Impossible suicides? Four of them?" Sherlock asked making his way towards her. "There's no point sitting at home when there's finally something fun going on!" He told her excitedly before kissing her cheek.
"When one is avoiding the attention of Sherlock Holmes, one learns to be discreet, hence this place." The man said and John scoffed. Right, very discreet. "Your leg must be hurting you. Sit down." The man ordered.
"It's good news for breathing." John muttered and Sherlocke rolled his eyes while groaning at that cliche answer, he knew John could do better than that.
"No." She said.
"Bit not good, yeah." John told him. And suddenly Sherlock had John in his arms again.
Outside Sherlock quickly hailed a cab and ordered the cabbie to take them to the National Gallery. John slid into the back of the cab ignoring the pain in his lower abdomen when it flared once more. The ride to the gallery was quick, as soon Sherlock was gently leading him by the hand through the crowd of both Londoners and tourists. "Once we're through here, we'll get you something to eat." Sherlock told him with a sigh as the pain flared once more causing John to squeeze Sherlock's hand.
"Could it be that you've decided to trust Sherlock Holmes of all people?" The man asked as he casually flipped through the pages of his notebook while keeping it at an angle so that John couldn't read it.
"Right, yeah, thanks. And?" The Inspector asked impatiently causing Sherlock to stop again.
"Neither do I." Lestrade said also rolling up his sleeve to show a nicotine patch. "So let's work together." Sherlock stormed over to John and pulled him to him again, and buried his nose in John hair. John didn't know how to act. They had just gone on their first date and now Sherlock was using John's scent to try and calm himself down. "We've found Rachel."
"He cleared my name." Angelo bragged.
"It's murder, all of them. I don't know how. But they're not suicides. They're killings, serial killings." Sherlock said before looking like a little boy about to open his presents on Christmas day and continued down the stairs. "We've got a serial killer. Love those. There's always something to look forward to."
"We all make enemies." Sebastian told him through clenched teeth.
That somewhere, it turned out, was the Scotland Yard. Sherlock led John into the building as if he owned it, ignoring all the dirty looks he was receiving. At first John was sure Sherlock was going to go to Lestrade and demand he take the case over from Dimmok. However, when they passed Lestrade's office and just went straight to Dimmok, John wondered what Sherlock was going to do. Sherlock placed the computer on Dimmok's desk and quickly logged into it.
"The police don't consult amateurs." Sherlock said looking away sadly.
"And why would he do that?" John asked quietly.
"Get into the car, Dr Watson." The man said before hanging up as a black car with tented windows pulled up in front of him and a man got out and opened the door. John sighed and limped out of the phone booth and into the car where a woman with shoulder length curly brown hair sat typing away on a blackberry. John took a deep breath to get her scent, but she was smart enough to be using scent blockers and odorless products to cover her scent. John couldn't even tell if she was an Alpha, Beta, or an Omega. Once he was in the car, the man shut the door before taking off.
"No." Dimmok said.
After having found the pink suitcase not far from the house, Sherlock had raced home and searched the contents not finding the woman's phone or her planner. That meant that the woman had somehow left it on the murderer. Once he had realized that, it didn't take Sherlock very long to find her number. Now all he needed was John to hurry up and get there so that he could continue with his plan to catch the killer.
"Who's on Forensics?" Sherlock asked.
"I don't know? Who?" John asked.
"That's nice of you." John said, voice dripping with sarcasm.
"Then why did they die?" John asked. "It doesn't make sense, if the both turn up at the shop and deliver the goods why would someone threaten them and kill them after the event, after they'd finished the job?"
It was John's daily routine to wake up, use the loo, dress, and then pull out his gun and decide if he would be using it on himself today or not. With another sigh, John picked up his gun and began to dismantle and clean it. It wasn't his wound that had caused a trimmer in his hand that ruined his surgery career, nor was it the fact that he was no longer a soldier that caused him to decide every morning wither to eat a bullet or not. It was the fact that some how during the time between the snipper's bullet entered his shoulder to waking up after surgery his womb had been damaged to the point that the chances of him being able to conceive were next to none.
"You took your time." Sherlock muttered as John began to look around the room. John knew something was off in the flat. Sherlock stopped himself from tensing up.
"Hello." John said, nodding to the elderly woman at the register. Sherlock's eyes ran over everything trying to find any clue to why the package would have been dropped off here.
"Could have gone on holiday." A very annoyed John stated.
"I did." Sherlock said as he gathered his jacket. "I told Mike this morning that I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for." He said slipping on his jacket. "Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan. Wasn't a difficult leap." He told John while putting on his scarf.
"Sent. Now, tell me why you have the pink lady's- why you have Jennifer Wilson's case." John demanded.
"Floor above, new label." Sherlock pointed out and John looked at the label. Sherlock was right, it was a new label, but what about it made Sherlock so sure it was new, it could have just been replaced, and he told Sherlock that who shook his head and buzzed the person. "No one ever does that."
"Friend of mine." Sherlock stated and John didn't know if he was joking or not. He really hope he was, but from the look in the Alpha's eyes John could see he wasn't. "When I say friend..."
"Her case! Come on, where is her case? Did she eat it? Someone else was here, and they took her case." Sherlock said before looking as if he figured something out. "So the killer must have driven her here. Forgot the case was in the car."
"Sherlock." John growled out from the kitchen, his tone of voice instantly snapping Sherlock out of his mind palace. Had he not put a body part in his designated spot in the fridge again? He shot up into a sitting position, intending to rush into the kitchen to save whatever body part John was fixing to throw out, when John stormed into living room. "There's no food in this flat!" John told him angrily. "Why isn't there any food?"
"John is right. Suicide is one possible explanation of some of the facts." Sherlock stated and John had to bite his lip to stop the smile that threatened to appear on his face. They were at a crime scene, it was not proper to smile at a crime scene, no matter how amazing Sherlock's deduction skills were. "You've got a solution that you like, but you're choosing to ignore anything you see that doesn't comply with it." Sherlock growled at Dimmok who growled back.
"Everybody quiet and still. Anderson, turn your back." Lestrade said.
"An interested party." The man told him.
"I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at. What happened?" Mike asked. Annoyance flew through John, it was painfully obvious what had happened!
"That's because you're an idiot." Sherlock said automatically. "But you're already miles a head of Lestrade and his team of idiots. They haven't even figured out the color of the case." He added quickly.
"Yeah." Sherlock said before moving around John and out the door.
"Both of you?" Mrs Hudson asked in concern causing Sherlock to pause at the door before swiftly spinning on the balls of his feet to look at her with excitement in his eyes.
"Great." John said hoping Sherlock didn't deduce anything that had happened during the interview.
"Nothing." Angelo told him before going back to John. "But for this man, I'd have gone to prison."
"Just in." Molly told him eager to please him. "67, natural causes. Used to work here. I knew him, he was nice." Sherlock zipped the body bag back up before straightening up. This body would do.
"Of course it was. It was extraordinary. It was quite extraordinary." John told him earnestly while looking him in the eye to let Sherlock see for himself that he was telling the truth. After reading him like a book, Sherlock smiled warmly at him.
"No, I think you've covered it." Dimmok growled out.
"Well, maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it fell out somewhere." Lestrade suggested. That would have made sense had they not received a call from the phone.
." Sherlock looked away nodding before looking back at the camera with a sheepish look.
"Useless!" John hissed before storming over to the coat closet and grabbing his coat from it. "I guess I'll have to do the shopping. You just lay there and do nothing but mope."
"Unusual how?" John asked.
"Narrows it down from just anyone on London. It's the first proper lead that we've had." Sherlock continued speaking with Lestrade.
"It's not a trick." Sherlock growled out causing Sebastian to roll his eyes. Why had he accepted this case again?
"I need an assistant." Sherlock half whined half growled out.
"Please follow me." He said before turning and walking away. Sherlock sighed, took John's wrist and followed the Beta. They were lead up another escalator to the elevator. In the elevator, the Beta pressed the button for the top floor. Whatever had happened happened on the top floor, not easy to get in and out unnoticed. Once at the top floor they were lead through a large room where most of the employees of the trading portion of the bank worked. There were only a handle full of offices lining the walls. "Mr. Wilkes will be with you in a moment." The Beta informed them as he ushered them into Sebastian's office before leaving. Sherlock lead John to a chair and gently pushed him into it.
It had taken him having to ask John three times for his phone and not receiving an answer from the Omega for him to realize that John wasn't even there with him. He had left him at that crime scene. With a sigh, Sherlock had pulled out his phone and texted the Omega. When he didn't receive a reply after a couple of minutes, he sent another text. Only to repeat the process a third and final time.
"What's wrong with my hand?" John demanded.
"You don't seem very afraid." The man pointed out with a smirk.
"Um, no. That's not a word I'd use." She told him nervously as she pulled out every receipt for the day Van Coon had died. "The only things Eddie appreciated had a big price tag."
"And of course that's how he got into the bank. He'd run along within the ledge and onto the terrace." Sherlock told him before shoving past the Detective and began to search the room once more. "I have to find out what connects these two men." Sherlock suddenly bent down and picked up a book that had been thrown on the stairs. "John, let's go." Was his only warning before Sherlock ran out of the house.
." She said slowly before buzzing them in. Sherlock took John by the hand and whisked them into the building before John could even thank her. They quickly located the elevators and called one, thankfully they didn't have to wait long. On Van Coon's floor John exited the elevator and quickly located the right door. He stood there for what felt like an eternity waiting for Sherlock to let him in. Had he fallen? Was he having to pick the lock? Did Sherlock even know how to pick a lock.
"Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi's here, Sherlock." Mrs Hudson said.
Sherlock was in the middle of testing some blood when a knock sounded on the door of the lab he had commandeered. He ignored it knowing that the person on the other side would get the message and leave. He knew it wasn't Molly with his coffee, she wouldn't have knocked. He nearly growled when a Beta and Omega walked into his lab as if they owned it.
"Just this once, dear, I'm not your housekeeper." She reminded him.
"Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?" The man asked in a tone that had John looking at him.
"I don't like him." John told him causing Sherlock to chuckle as the elevator got to the ground floor.
"You're, um..." She stuttered glancing back at his resume. "Well, you're a bit over-qualified." John refused to believe that her tone had taken a more flirtatious vibe.
"Inspector, do you seriously believe that Eddie Van Coon was just another city suicide?" Sherlock asked and Dimmok looked away causing Sherlock to growl out a sigh of annoyance. "You have seen the ballistics' reports, I suppose?" Dimmok nodded. "And the shot that killed him, was it fired form his own gun?"
"Where are you going?" Lestrade demanded.
"Oh, I volunteered." Anderson said darkly. Sherlock growled again and let go of John to run his hands through his hair while pacing yet again.
"Flying all the way around the world twice in a month." Sherlock said. John looked at him ready and eager to hear the deductions.
"Sherlock, two minutes, I said, I need anything you got." The Inspector demanded shocking John who hadn't realized he had come back in.
"Got anything?" The Inspector asked as Sherlock began to take off his gloves.
"I'm starting to see that." John muttered with a smile.
"What do you call this?!" Sherlock roared motioning to the team tearing up the flat.
"I could be wrong, but I think that's none of your business." John snapped out receiving an amused look from the man.
"I'm taking that's a complement coming from you?" John asked with a laugh.
Sherlock checked the time and saw that John should be back any minute. He grabbed the swordsman and carried him outside before dumping him in an alley his comrades would be sure to find him. He then rushed back to the flat and quickly put everything back where it was suppose to be, hiding the sword as best as he could under his chair. Once he was satisfied, Sherlock hopped into his chair, grabbed a book, and began to skim over it while waiting for John to return.
"In real life. There are no arch-enemies in real life. Doesn't happen." John said with an amused smile.
"As ever, I'm concerned about you." The man told Sherlock.
"I know you're an Army doctor. And you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you've got a brother who's worried about you but you won't go to him for help 'cause you don't approve of him, possibly because he's an alcoholic and more likely because he recently walked out on his Mate." John's eyes widen slightly at that. "And I know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic, quite correctly, I'm afraid." John shifted uncomfortably as if just remembering his bad leg. "That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?" Sherlock asked stopping himself from mentioning the damaged womb having a feeling his flatmate wouldn't like that. It kind of shocked him that the thought of John being upset with him actually caused him to stop deducing John, usually how people felt about his deductions didn't matter to him.
"Sherlock!" The Omega said before hugging the Alpha in a motherly way.
"Sorry, it's in my coat." Mike told him and Sherlock bit the urge to snarl at him and roll his eyes. Useless.
"Alright." John muttered.
"Hi." She said looking up from her blackberry to glance at him before going back to her blackberry.
"Do you want me to come with you?" John asked. Something was wrong. He could feel it.
"Today at the bank, sort of a warning." John told the Detective carefully, not knowing if the duel was over or not as Sherlock began to put his scarf on.
"And the blindfold, that horizontal line. That was a number as well." Sherlock told him showing him a tag with the same horizontal line on it. "The Chinese number one, John."
"No, you didn't." John said laughing. "That's how you get your kicks, isn't it? You risk your life to prove you're clever."
Sherlock quickly located John patiently waiting for him by the elevators. "Let's go, John." He said taking him gently by the wrist and lead him into the elevators. The ride down was silent as Sherlock began to try and figure out the puzzle. When the door opened him and John exited and began heading for the first set of escalators.
"Sixty second apart." Sebastian pointed out switching between the frame without graffiti and the frame with graffiti. "So, someone came up here in the middle of the night, splashed paint around and left within a minute."
the British government, when he's not too busy being the British secret service or the CIA on a freelance basis." Sherlock growled out proving a point. "Good evening, Mycroft. Try not to start a war before I get home, you know what it does for the traffic." Sherlock said before beginning to lead John away only to have John stop him so he could look back at Mycroft.
"I was wondering if you'd like to have coffee?" Molly asked.
"You've brought me here to send a text?" John asked bringing him back to the case.
"Fire her." The man ordered. "She's got it the wrong way round. You're under stress right now and your hand is perfectly steady. You're not haunted by the war, Dr Watson... You miss it." The man moved so that his mouth was right next to John's ear. "Welcome back." He whispered before be backed up and walked away as John's phone chimed one last time. "Time to choose a side, Dr Watson."
"Right, so she's not an actual Omega. She's taking suppressants to hide her Beta scent and using Omega based products to make herself smell like an Omega. Why I am unsure of. It's obvious she's taken poison, but anyone who's read the news papers could tell that. She died of Asphyxiation, due to the poison, again obvious. There is no scent of Alcohol or anything other than rain and her false Omega scent that is fading to allow her natural Beta scent to come out. It's clearly been 24 hours since she has last taken her suppressants." John trailed off at the intense look he was receiving from Sherlock, had he said something wrong?
"Who the hell are you?" John growled out tightening his grip on his cane. "How do you know that?"
"I didn't order a taxi. Go away." Sherlock told her before beginning to pace again.
"Who is she?" Sherlock asked, his voice muffled by John's hair.
"But they're just for my hip. They're herbal soothers." Mrs Hudson said worried.
"Those symbols at the bank, the graffiti, why were they put there?" Sherlock asked as he began to examine the body.
"Ah, Anderson. Here we are again." Sherlock growled out. So this was the man that wouldn't work with Sherlock as his assistant?
"An enemy." John corrected "Well, according to him, your arch-enemy." John corrected. "Do people have arch-enemies?" Sherlock growled out checking John over, needing to see that John was alright. Tight lipped. He was stressed. Gipping his cane so hard that his knuckles are white. He was distressed, upset, or both. At seeing that, Sherlock couldn't fight the urge to be next to John and shot off the couch. He gently grabbed John by the shoulders and turned him so that the Omega was now looking at him.
"Maybe to you." John said with a playful smirk.
"He's gone." Donovan told him with pity in her voice.
"You'll need to wear one of these." He ordered motioning to a forensic suit laying on a table next to Detective Inspector Lestrade.
"It stops being pretend if they find anything." Lestrade told him seriously.
"Um, no, mundane is good, sometimes." He told her, smiling warmly as he thought of Sherlock sitting back at home trying to figure out what those symbols meant. "Mundane works."
"Any time you want to include me!" John called.
"Uh, here, use mine." The Omega offered before digging his phone out of his pocket.
"Only the cipher can tell us." Sherlock told him with a sigh. They stood there, both silent and eyes running over every clue they had. Out of nowhere, a stabbing pain in his lower abdomen caused John to suck in a sharp breath causing Sherlock to look at him. "John?"
"So he got a Tube back to the office?" She asked. "Why would he get a taxi into town and then the Tube back?"
"Uh, any problems, just let us know." John said after he had stopped laughing. He shut the taxi door before walking over to Sherlock who was waiting for him. "Basically just a cab that happened to slow down."
"How?" John asked.
"And the bullet?" Dimmok asked, his tone clearly stating he didn't believe Sherlock.
"Stay there." Sherlock ordered. Once John had heard the door shut, he flew over to the window and watched as Sherlock and the cabbie began to have a conversation as he tried calling the phone. And then, Sherlock got into the taxi.
"Damn it!" A familiar voice growled out as Sherlock, who was busy looking around, bumped into them. John's scent filled his nose when he breathed it, but something was wrong, John's scent was slightly off. It wasn't wrong, just very distracting. The fact that John's scent had changed even the slightest made Sherlock want to bury his nose in John's hair and... well he didn't know. "Right, I know how into your Work you can get, but can you a least
"You want to pay me to spy on Sherlock?" John demanded angrily.
"I'll go and see Van Coon's PA." Sherlock told him. "If we retrace their steps, somewhere they'll coincide." They had made it outside, Sherlock pulled John close to peck him on the lips before he turned and walked away without a word. The annoyance returned as John tried to get a taxi and three open taxis passed him by before he was finally able to get one to stop, all the while feeling as if someone was watching him.
"I don't need an incentive, Sebastian." Sherlock growled out before storming away, he had a mystery to solve, and it wasn't how the person broke in. What Sherlock was more interested in was why? What were those symbols? Who were they for? And what did they mean?
John did not expect their 'one more stop' to be a high class restaurant in the middle of London. And had Sherlock not just told him that they would be going home to eat he would have thought Sherlock had brought him here to eat. Just the very thought of eating at a place like this had John itching to leave the restaurant. He knew that most Omega's loved to be pampered by their Alpha's and going to fancy restaurants like this, but not John. John would rather be in their dingy, yet still very homey, flat eating take-out and watching crap telly.
"Hi, um, we live in the flat just below you." Sherlock lied sounding slightly embarrassed. "I don't think we've met."
"Why?" The Beta question defensively as Sherlock slowly turned to glare at her.
"Okay. We'll pull you in tomorrow, off you go." Lestrade said and Sherlock rushed over to John, ducking under the tape, and pulled John into a hug after removing the blanket.
"These words exactly. 'What happened at Lauriston Gardens? I must have blacked out. 22 Northumberland St. Please come.'" Sherlock recited.
"I don't know. Criminal mastermind?" John suggested.
"You're not serious? Like Spider-Man?" The Detective scoffed.
"Suitcase, yes. She's been Bonded at least 10 years, but not happily. She's had a string of lover but none of them knew she was both Bonded and a Beta." Sherlock said still looking around the room making John wonder what he was looking for or at.
his deductions.
"Because he's a psychopath." Donovan told him. "Psychopaths get bored."
"How can you tell?" Sherlock asked confused.
"We can't just wait!" The Inspector yelled.
"Sherlock. That's him, that's the man I was talking to you about." John whispered to Sherlock.
"I can't afford London on an Army pension." John informed him trying to keep his eyes from drifting over to a young family walking in the park with their children. Something he would never get to do.
"I'm not the first!" Sherlock informed him.
"Because you're an idiot." John told him and Sherlock smiled down at him as he held John closer to him.
"Northumberland St's a five minute walk from here." Sherlock said.
"Who said anything about flatmates?" John said trying to wrap his mind around what was happening. Everyone who met Sherlock for the first time went through this stage. The next stage would be anger. And the third and final stage was calling him a 'freak' and storming out of the flat. Sherlock did hope that John lasted longer than a couple of days, he seemed quite interesting.
"Suitcase?" The Inspector asked.
Sebastian had been the one to drive him to cocaine. Had been the reason he had almost overdosed.
"Not much." He said standing up.
"I'm calling the phone, it's ringing out." John told Lestrade.
"Couple of biscuits too, if you got 'em." He called back with a small smirk wanting to see how far he could push it as he began to read the paper.
"Oddly enough, no." Sherlock growled.
"How do you know she had a suitcase?" The Inspector demanded.
"Well?" Sherlock asked.
"Will you come?" The Alpha asked again.
"Sherlock." John called once he had relieved the very same graffiti that had been in the bank.
"Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything." Sherlock said.
"Right. Down to business." Sebastian growled out. He wanted them both out of his office. "I'm glad you could make it over, we've had a break-in." He stood up and began leaving the room with out pausing to wait for them. "Sir William's office, the bank's former chairman. The room's been left here like a sort of memorial." He explained while quickly leading them out of his office and through the main room to the biggest office on that floor. "Someone broke in late last night."
"I'm here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade." Sherlock told her.
"We know he didn't." John told him.
"It's exactly the same as the cipher." John told him under his breath before clearing his throat. The cipher wasn't letters, it was numbers!
John sighed looking at his military issued gun that sat on his desk. His hand twitched and he didn't know if it was from his wound or from the urge to use the gun on himself. John had been back in London for less than two months, and after being active in the war for years it was strange, almost unnatural. He would still have been at war if he hadn't been shot and been made invalid and sent home.
"Flew back from Dalian Friday. Looks like he had back-to-back meetings with the sales team." Van Coon's PA read off the Van Coon's schedule.
"Well, you have just killed a man." Sherlock said.
"Donovan!" The Inspector called her.
"It's an ancient number system, Hangzhou. These days only street traders use it. Those were numbers written on the wall at the bank and at the library. Numbers written in an ancient Chinese dialect." Sherlock explained.
"Left-handed?" The Detective asked confused.
On the door of the office Sherlock found the nameplate 'Edward Van Coon' (worked the Hong Kong trade) and took it. He needed to speak with this Van Coon as soon as possible. He had all that he needed here. It was time to leave and find Van Coon.
"How long did it take you to notice I'd gone out?" John asked with a small smile as he found a pin and tossed it to Sherlock who caught it and went back to staring at the pictures of the symbols that he had printed out and pinned to the wall. Sherlock not answering him alerted John that it was longer than the Alpha wanted to admit. "I went to see about a job at that surgery." John informed him, even though he had told this to Sherlock before he left. However, the Alpha obviously didn't remember him telling him, nor did he remember responding with a grunt.
"Anderson, don't talk out loud. You lower the IQ of the whole street." Sherlock growled. "We can do much more than just read her e-mails. It's a Smartphone, it's got GPS. Which means if you lose it you can locate it online. She's leading up directly to the man who killed her."
"What? No... No!" Sherlock sighed and stood up from the couch once more and quickly made his way over to John, stepping on the coffee table to do so. "Type and send it. Quickly."
"Why did they die, Sherlock?" John asked, hoping that Sherlock had figured it out already. Sherlock shook his head before tapping his finger on the picture of the first cipher.
"It wasn't working for me." Molly said awkwardly after glancing at John and taking a half step away from him sensing his 'wrongness'. His womb then.
"And what's wrong with the landline?" Mike asked in annoyance.
"Eddie Van Coon brought a package here the day he died. Whatever was hidden inside that case... I've managed to piece together a picture using scraps of information. Credit card bills, receipts. He flew back from China then he came here." Sherlock noticed as he continued talking the more annoyed John seemed to be getting.
"I'm not in shock." Sherlock said.
"Harry and me don't get on, never have." John informed Sherlock as they made their way to the crime scene. Him and Harry had never seen eye to eye, even before she presented as an Alpha and him as an Omega. And it didn't help when John presented as an Omega and Harry tried to dominate him like the Alpha she was and he put her on her ass. "Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce, and Harry is a drinker." He confirmed and didn't have to look at the Alpha to know he was smirking.
"Maybe he wasn't answering." John suggested.
"Yeah, but some of the guys want to take photographs." Lestrade said.
"Ready when you are." John said before they both took off.
"Serial killers, always hard. You have to wait for them to make a mistake." Sherlock said with a smirk.
"My what?" John growled out threateningly as he turned to glare at the man.
"What's wrong?" Sherlock asked.
"On painting. Yes, I need to talk to an expert." Sherlock informed him as they made it to the back of the building where and young Omega male was spray painting the back door. Sherlock stopped beside the young man and John couldn't help admiring the painting. It was a very detailed painting of a cop holding a rifle.
"Because I had a row in the shop with a chip and PIN machine." John snapped out.
"I was right?" John asked slightly out of breath. "Right about what?"
"Oh, God, yes." John breathed out.
"I'm his friend." John growled at her causing her to roll her eyes.
"Harry's your sister." The Alpha stated.
"Jennifer Wilson's only daughter." Lestrade informed.
"She was writing Rachel?" The Inspector asked and even John was shocked that he hadn't figured that one out.
Suddenly the four walls of his small one room apartment began to close in on him, and John needed to leave his apartment right then. As quickly as he could, John stood up and grabbed his cane before he limped out of his apartment, locked the door, and took a walk. As he walked he forced everything from his mind.
"Listen, I was wondering. Maybe later, when you're finished..." Molly started and Sherlock had to bite back a growl at her. She wanted to go on a date to try and start the bonding that would lead to mating, he needed to put a stop to this. He glanced at her to deduce anything he could that would stop her from wanting to be with him.
"Well, what?" John asked staring curiously at his coat in Sherlock's hand.
"I never said you did." John told him honestly sending another wave of that strange, warm feeling through Sherlock again.
"And this is all you've to to go on? It's hardly much now, is it?" Raz said tossing the phone back at Sherlock who easily caught it just as John had to bite back a pain filled groan as the pain flared once more.
"Who?" John asked.
"Of course, yeah, but what mistake?" The Inspector demanded.
"Yes, where is it?" Sherlock demanded and began to look around the room once more. "She must have had a phone or an organizer. Find out who Rachel is."
"But the police don't consult amateurs." John said causing Sherlock to smirk at him, and with a jolt he realized that Sherlock was telling him with that one smirk that he was no amateur.
"John! John Watson!" Someone called out to him snapping him out of his thoughts, John looked around quickly noticing that he had somehow made his way to a park, before turning around to find a slightly over weight Beta walking up to him excitedly. The Beta looked familiar but John couldn't really put a name to the face. "Stamford, Mike Stamford." The Beta introduced. "We were at Barts together." It was then that John finally remembered the Beta.
Sherlock quickly made his way back up to the trading floor and into the chairman's office and took pictures of the symbols. As he was taking the pictures, he took note of the balcony. He didn't recall seeing that as one of the many doors being monitored. Sherlock opened the balcony door and stepped out onto it. They were on the top floor. It would be difficult to climb up to the balcony. Difficult, but not impossible. Especially if they climbed from another balcony.
"Mike, can I borrow your phone? There's no signal on mine." Sherlock said after getting the results from his test.
"The most dangerous man you've ever met, and not my problem right now." Sherlock growled out. "On my desk, the number!" He ordered walking back over to the couch.
John was quickly becoming used to the idea that Sherlock was rarely wrong, if ever. It had taken Sherlock less than a minute to look up the correct Van Coon and where he lived. Five minutes after Sherlock found the address they were standing in front of a very posh apartment building in the middle of London. But, after Sherlock had buzzed Van Coon twice with no answer, John feared they had reached a dead end. They couldn't enter the building without either a key or being buzzed in.
"Yet, since yesterday you've moved in with him and now you're solving crimes together." The man said giving him a hard look as he checked him up and down. "Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?" John grip on his cane tightened as he fought the urge to hit the man with it. How dare the man insinuate that John was trying to force Sherlock into mating him! He was broken and useless, and Sherlock was not looking for a Mate!
"Getting you something to eat." Sherlock said. "And proving a point."
"Coming!" She called back. "Stay away from Sherlock Holmes." She told him before jogging into the house. John staid standing there trying to wrap his mind around what the Beta had just told him. Should he believe her or not? It was clear that the Beta hated Sherlock with a passion, as did Anderson. But the Detective Inspector really wouldn't have allowed Sherlock into the crime scene if he wasn't a decent person. He would stay by Sherlock and decide for himself if he wanted to stay with him or not.
"It's been here since Monday." Sherlock muttered before standing up and ringing the doorbell, taking note of the name on the label: Soo Lin Yao. When no one answered Sherlock started down the alley to the back of the apartment with John following him. "No one's been in that flat for at least three days."
"I'll try the search again." John said refreshing the page.
"Appreciation! Applause! At long last the spotlight. That's the frailty of genius, John, it need and audience." Sherlock said.
"Do you want to eat?" Sherlock asked just before John could go into shock.
"Bit of trouble too, I bet?" Sherlock asked still coming closer.
"Enlighten me, Sherlock, 'two trips a month, flying all the way around the world.'" Sebastian growled out ignoring John. That pissed John off.
"To somewhere near Piccadilly Station. Dropped the package, delivered it, and then . . ." A receipt for Piazza Espresso Bar Italiano. "Stopped on his way. He got peckish."
"Shut up." He growled out at Lestrade.
"Well, you could just sit there and watch telly." Sherlock said growling out the last word.
"Don't stare." Sherlock told him.
"I can see why he's interested in you." Anthea said making John wonder who was interested in him. The mysterious phone caller?
"I got shot." John said through clenched teeth and his response was Mike awkwardly looking away, and that eased the annoyance in John a little.
"Because he was delivering something heavy." Sherlock muttered. "You wouldn't lug a package up the escalator."
"Seen a lot of injuries, then. Violent deaths." Sherlock stated walking closer to John as a sort of tension began to fill the air. John couldn't identify what sort of tension it was, almost like it was a multitude of them strung together. And it was exciting.
"Yes." Sherlock said suddenly sounding defensive. "And I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother's drinking habits on your mobile phone."
"Who cares about decent?" Sherlock playfully growled out. "The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!" He said walking outside with John right on his heels and hailed a taxi, getting one instantly, before getting in with John sliding in after him. Sherlock quickly raddled off the address and they were off.
"Mother.
"Did you take it?" Sherlock asked quietly and once again John's distress and anger rose.
"We don't know that it was suicide." Sherlock told him, annoyed. John looked at him in shock, what did he mean by that. The evidence clearly pointed to suicide. What was it that Sherlock was seeing that stated other wise?
"Okay." John said taking a bite of his food. Sherlock tore his eyes off John eating and looked out the window to notice a taxi idling in front of the address he had given the murderer.
John sighed and chased after him to find he already had a taxi waiting, how the Alpha always managed to get a taxi amazed him. Sherlock had obviously already told the cabbie where to go, because the second John shut the door behind him, they were off. John was curious as to where they were going, but kept that question to himself after seeing Sherlock deep in thought. John's question was answered when they pulled up to the West Kensington Library. John followed Sherlock into the building and to the second floor.
"Victim is in her late 30's, and as John just clearly stated, is pretending to be an Omega. Professional person, going by her clothes." Sherlock said gently grabbing John's upper arm and helped him stand up as he stood up. "I'm guessing something in the media, going by the frankly alarming shade of pink. Traveled from Cardiff today intending to stay in London one night." Sherlock began to look around the room for something. "It's obvious from the size of her suitcase."
"Who's this?" The Inspector asked as John picked up the suit.
"Sorry, are you guys the police?" The man asked.
"Yes, I've been hearing about your
"No, Anderson's my sniffer dog." Lestrade informed.
boring. But that didn't mean the Sherlock didn't want it to stay like that. He was beginning to long for an interesting case that couldn't be solved from their flat.
"I didn't kill her." Sherlock informed him angrily as he moved to crouch on his chair while looking at the suitcase sitting on a kitchen chair he had dragged in there earlier that evening.
Sherlock swept through the halls of Barts, ignoring all the looks he was receiving from everyone, and threw the doors to the morgue open. He smiled darkly when he saw the black body bag waiting on the examining table where Molly, a Beta, had left it for him. Molly, who had heard him come in, came running into the room. She meet him at the table, him on one side and her on the other.
"Well, so?" He asked.
"Sorry, I'll shut up." He told the Alpha quietly.
"The luggage." Sherlock said. "Ah, probably your first trip to London, right? Going by your final destination and the route the cabbie was taking you."
"And, what, you couldn't be bothered to walk farther than my chair?" John asked half amused half annoyed. "It's password protected."
"Like that hand cream. He bought that for you, didn't he?" Sherlock asked as he began to go through the receipts she had laid out. Taxi Receipt for 18.50 at 10:35. "Look at this one." He handed the taxi receipt to her, and she took it nervously. "Got a taxi from home on the day he died, £18.50."
"Want to see some more?" Sherlock asked.
Sherlock pay for everything and wanted to help, he was just that kind of Omega.
"What? Sorry?" John asked. Sherlock needed advice? His Sherlock was unsure of something that he needed advice? John felt Sherlock's grip on his hand tighten.
"It must not be very often that you need advice." John told him with a soft smile when the Alpha glanced at him. His smile widened when Sherlock relaxed.
"Where are we going?" John asked.
"Lost five million." John said nodding.
"Scotland Yard." John told the cabby before slipping into the back, catching a woman in black recording him, however, when he tried to get a better look at her before the taxi took off, she vanished.
"Oh, come on." The Detective scoffed as Sherlock returned to John's side ready to venture out once more. "What are the chances of that?"
"This is his hunting ground. Right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go. Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?" Sherlock asked.
"Sherlock, please." The Alpha said holding out his hand for John to shake, which he did.
"I'm sorry?" He asked looking at him.
"No, actually, I followed him home." John snapped harshly causing Donovan to flinch back, obviously not expecting a broken Omega like him to snap like that. Omegas were usually docile creatures that 'needed to be taken care of'. And though John did want an Alpha, he didn't want to be tucked away at home and 'taken care of'. The proud smirk he received from Sherlock made the shocked and slightly pissed look on Donovan's face so much sweeter.
Once at the top of the escalators Sherlock lead John to the reception desk. The Beta woman there looked up, "Sherlock Holmes." He told her before she could question them. His eyes narrowed challengingly when her eyes drifted from him to John and stayed there just a second too long. The woman, at seeing his glare, quickly looked him up.
"Come on, think. Quick!" Sherlock began to mutter.
"Sherlock, you okay?" John asked standing up from the desk.
"Within a month? How did you get that part?" John asked.
"Does it matter? Does any of it? He's just a lunatic, and he'll always let you down. And you're wasting your time. All our time." Sally told them and John moved to punch her in the face, only being stopped by Lestrade.
"What's Moriarty?" John asked.
Sherlock mentally grabbed the memories that had bubbled up at Sebastian's name and shoved them back into their cage. He would be professional about this. He would not let his hatred for the man keep him from taking the case, should it prove to be interesting. As he read over the case (a break in at the bank with nothing stolen) John came back home loaded with bags. After assessing that John didn't need help, Sherlock went back to reading the e-mail. There was something that Sebastian wasn't telling him, because something about this case that wasn't making sense.
"What's new about this one? You wouldn't have come to get me if there wasn't something different." Sherlock demanded.
"For goodness' sake. I occupy a minor position in the British government." Mycroft scoffed.
"We have more in common than you'd like to believe. This petty feud between us is simply childish. People will suffer. And you know how it always upset Mummy." The man said confusing John. Mummy?
"Where are we going?"
"Oh, I might as well, I'm almost at the bottom of the list." Sherlock purred out, eyes never leaving John's as he pointed to the kitchen. "There's a knife on the bread board with butter on the right side of the blade because he used it with his left." Sherlock turned to glare at Dimmok. "It's highly unlikely that a left-handed man would shoot himself in the right side of his head. Conclusion, someone broke in here and murdered him, only explanation of all the facts."
"No, I think he's brilliant enough. I love the brilliant ones. They're all so desperate to get caught." Sherlock informed him.
"Well?" John asked and for a split second Sherlock feared that John had already caught on. "You asked me to come, I'm assuming it's important." The case! John was talking about the case!
"We've only just met and we're going to look at a flat?" John asked.
"Yeah, I know who you are and I'd prefer it if you didn't tamper with any of the evidence." The Alpha growled out, staking his claim of the area. John saw Sherlock's eyes narrow at the challenge. The two Alpha's staid glaring at each other for a minute before Sherlock slowly handed the evidence bag to the other Alpha. Yet, even though he had handed the bag over, John could tell that Sherlock was not giving in nor bowing out, he was just bidding his time before he struck back.
"That would get him to the office." Amanda said, confused.
"Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains, it must be so boring." Sherlock muttered. "Her coat. It's slightly damp. She's been in heavy rain the last few hours. No rain anywhere in London in that time. Under her coat collar is damp too. She's turned it up against the wind. She's got an umbrella in her left hand pocket but it's dry and unused. Not just wind, strong wind, too strong to use her umbrella. We know from her suitcase that she was intending to stay overnight so she must have come a decent distance, but she can't have traveled more than two or three hours because her coat still hasn't dried." Sherlock reached into the inside pocket of his jacket once more and pulled out his phone. "So, where has there been heavy rain and strong wind within the radius of that travel time?" He unlocked his phone and held it up for the Inspector to see whatever was on the screen. "Cardiff."
"Lukis' Diary. He was here too. He wrote down the address." John told him before walking across the street.
"Uh, Baker Street. 221B Baker Street. But I need to stop off somewhere first." John told Anthea as he limped back to the car.
"This man got me off a murder charge." Angelo informed John as he shakily began to look at the menu, face blank yet mind running. What was he thinking? Had Sherlock made him mad? Had he messed up?
"Flour floors up." Sherlock muttered looking out the window after glancing around the room. "That's why they think they're safe." He went back to examining the room. "Put a chain across the door, bolt it shut, think your impregnable. They don't reckon for one second that there's another way in." He said before walking out of the room and over to to the skylight in the hall.
"The world runs on codes and ciphers." Sherlock began and John smiled. "From the million pound security system at the bank to the pin machine you took exception too. Cryptography inhabits our every waking moment."
"Not rush hour. Check the time." He informed her as he continued to look through the receipts looking for the one the would put him at that time for that amount. "Mid-morning. Eighteen would get him as far as..."
Soon, they had managed to drop back down to street level where they ran down alley after alley. At the end of one alley, John saw the taxi drive by them. "Oh! This way!" Sherlock ordered and John followed. After more alleys, Sherlock ran out of an alley and into the street right in front of the taxi causing it to slam on it's breaks. "Police! Open her up." Sherlock growled pulling out a badge from his coat pocket.
"Pillars." Sherlock told him as they reached the bottom of the last escalator. "Very few places you can see that graffiti from. That narrows the field considerably. And of course, the message was left at 11:34 last night. That tells us a lot." He explained as they exited the bank.
"Starving." John said.
"Yeah." John said distractedly before he realized what he had said. "Wait, what? But we just... we're..."
20 minutes later, 15 minutes longer than it should have taken John to get back, the Omega stormed up the stairs and into their flat without groceries. Something had happened. Had John been attacked? Sherlock peeked over his book discreetly and checked John over. There were no signs of an attack any where on John.
to take care of.
"Hold on, we have a whole team right outside." The Inspector said sounding slightly offended.
John glared at Detective Dimmok as he slowly searched through the evidence box that contained the Journalist's stuff. He was on edge, every little thing was pissing him off. The cabby's voice as he drove him to the Yard. The sunlight whenever it decided to peek around the clouds. The Scotland Yard building itself pissed John off. The scents of everyone in the building mingling together pissed John off, and even gave him a headache. The fact that everyone decided to speak loudly (not exactly yelling but not exactly using their inside voices either) pissed John off and made his headache worse.
"That wasn't just me." John said as Sherlock rested his cheek on top of his head. "Why aren't we back at the restaurant?"
"Shall we?" He asked carefully manoeuvering around John to head up the stairs with John slowly limping after him. Part of him was shocked to find Sherlock waiting for him at the top instead of already in the flat. It was almost as if the Alpha was making sure John could actually make it up the stairs. Once he was at the top, Sherlock nodded and opened the door to allow John to see a cluttered mess.
"Very good." John said having the sudden need to impress Sherlock so that he would bring John with him to the Crime scene, and once at the Crime scene he could prove his usefulness to the Alpha.
"As some sort of code?" John asked.
"I'm sorry, what?" John asked after he realized Sherlock was speaking to him once more.
"Yeah, but that was ages ago. Why would she still be upset?" Sherlock asked. There was a tense silence in the room as Sherlock realized what he said and who he said it to. "Not good?"
"Lucky guess." John laughed out.
"Friends. People they know, people they like, people they don't like." John trailed off.
"Hello?"
"Well, thank God you're above all that." John snapped out. The man gave him a hard, reprimanding look a second before John's phone signaled he had a message. Without thought, John pulled the phone out and checked the message, sending his own silent message to the man that John didn't see him as much of a threat.
"Black, two sugars, please." Sherlock snapping his notebook closed to look at Molly dejected face and knew he had stopped her silly little idea of a date. "I'll be upstairs."
"I'm not a psychopath, Anderson." Sherlock growled. "I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do you research." He then turned his attention to Lestrade. "You need to bring Rachel in, you need to question her. I need to question her."
"Fantastic." John breathed out, once again not realizing he has said anything, causing a light dusting of pink to appear on Sherlock's face when he turned to look at him before moving over to him.
"What does that mean?" John asked.
"I'm not married, mated, or bonded." John snapped out as he, too, looked around. "Sherlock." Sherlock quickly made his way over to John, and wasn't able to stop himself from taking another deep sniff of John's scent. A strange sort of tingle began to form around his groin. "The label there."
"But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern go unmentioned." The man told him. "We have what you might call a... Difficult relationship." John's phone chimed once more and John looked at the message.
"Well, you'd know." Sherlock told him with a smirk. "Need to get the powder burns out of your fingers. I don't suppose you'd serve time for this, but let's avoid the court case." Sherlock pecked him once more on the lips. "Are you all right?"
"This is Angelo." Sherlock introduced. "Three years ago I proved to Lestrade at the time of particularly vicious triple murder that Angelo was in a completely different part of town, house-breaking." He informed forcing his mind away from John to watch the street.
"They'll lead us to the person who sent it." John finished.
"You're friend..." Detective Dimmok started.
"Interested in Sherlock? Why?" John demanded. "You clearly aren't his friend."
"Sort of. It sat there and I shouted abuse." John said with a sigh rubbing his forehead. He was getting a headache. "Have you got cash?"
"Found your website. The Science of Deduction." John said and saw a smile flash onto Sherlock's face before the Alpha began to fight it. He couldn't help smiling at how cute Sherlock was, almost like a small child showing his parents a project he had work hard on all by himself.
"Unless he got rid of it." Lestrade said.
"When I met you for the first time yesterday I said Afghanistan or Iraq. You looked surprised."
"Catchy." John growled out receiving an eye roll from the young man before the Omega went back to spray painting.
I left the balcony unlocked. If my mate could just drop from your balcony onto ours, then he could let me in."
Everything from realizing it was the cabbie, to using the GPS to track down Sherlock, to shooting the cabbie, to now standing outside the taped off zone near where they had Sherlock was a blur of adrenaline. Part of John wondered if it even happened or if he had just made it up.
"Oh, I've been too slow. She didn't have a laptop, which means she did her business on her phone. So it's a Smartphone, it's e-mail enabled. So those are website for her account. The username is her e-mail address, and all together now, the password is?"
"Who are you?" John growled out.
"'Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes and I always work alone because no-one else can compete with my massive intellect!'" John yelled angrily from outside. Ignoring him had definitely been a bad idea. Never ignore John. Ignoring John gets you strangled. Sherlock was starting to loose consciousness as the killer loosed his hold, put something in Sherlock's coat pocket, and left. Sherlock took a deep breath and coughed while forcing himself to get up. He checked his pocket to find the same black origami lotus flower that had been in Van Coon's mouth.
"He's busy. I'm in charge." The Alpha growled out at him while baring his teeth. Though John wanted to cut into the duel between the two Alpha's, John knew that he shouldn't. When two Alpha's fought over territory it was unwise to interfere, you could be seriously hurt or mounted and publicly mated if you were an Omega like John. "And it's not Sergeant, it's Detective Inspector Dimmok." And then Dimmok's eyes were on John causing Sherlock to growl and pull him close. Dimmok gave his own growl before he turned and left the room. Sherlock seemed to take a few seconds to collect himself before he lead John after Dimmok.
"Oh." Sherlock said before following John into the building.
"Underground, printed at one in Piccadilly." Sherlock told her showing her the receipt.
"Er, thank you. Thank you." John told Angelo taking the cane. Sherlock backed up and let John back into the house and shut the door. John turned to face Sherlock who tilted his head down towards John's, he was going to kiss him! Sherlock was going to kiss him!
"We'll follow you." John told him as Sherlock gently pushed him into the taxi. However, they didn't follow Dimmok, they led him to the crime scene. And Sherlock wasted no time in slipping under the tape and up the stairs with John and Dimmok close behind him.
"Did you figure something out?" John asked moving to stand in front of him.
"Five minutes." The Detective growled out before leading them back out of the building. Dimmok turned and headed to the car park while Sherlock hailed a taxi. "Are you not coming?"
"I don't believe we're here for you to try and bully Sherlock, Mr Wilkes." John growled out shocking Sebastian. It was the first time an Omega dared to speak to him like that.
"Well, I knew you'd find the case, I'm not stupid." Lestrade said as Sherlock began to pace in anger reminding John of a caged tiger.
"Dr Watson, what do you think?" Sherlock asked softly.
"Problem?" Sherlock asked causing John to lightly laugh, and from the shock in his eyes, he could tell that it had been quite a while since he had actually laughed. Sherlock usually found laughter to be annoying, that was probably because it was directed at him, but Sherlock found John's laughter to be pleasant. It was airy and light, almost like his scent.
"Oi!" Someone yelled, alerting everyone that their two minutes were up Sherlock tightened his grip on John's hand before taking off away form the officer, taking John with him.
"Her Bonding ring." Sherlock growled at the challenge the Inspector had issued. "Ten years old at least." He made his way back to the body and knelt in front of her head. "The rest of her jewelry has been regularly cleaned, but not her Bonding ring. State of her bond right there." He pointed out before standing back up. "The inside is shinier than the outside. That means it's regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. It's not her work, look at her nails." John did. "She doesn't work with her hands so what or rather who does she remove her rings for?" John looked at Sherlock in amazement that he got all that from her Bonding ring. "Clearly not one lover, she'd never sustain the fiction of being single and an Omega over that amount of time, so more likely a sting of them. Simple."
"Harrow, Oxford. Very bright guy." Sebastian started. "Worked in Asia for a while, so..."
After getting his schedule for his shifts, John quickly left the small clinic and high tailed it back home wondering if he should tell Sherlock about the Beta or not. The Alpha was already busy trying to solve this case, the most interesting case they've had since the 'Study in Pink' as he had dubbed their first case together, and John didn't want to distract Sherlock from The Work, as Sherlock dubbed it. With that decided, John spent the rest of the journey home trying to erase every trace of his distress over being flirted with from his mind and body. It wouldn't do for Sherlock to deduce it and throw a fit.
"So he's not..." John started.
"I'll take your word for it." John muttered weakly causing concern to flash through Sherlock's eyes.
"I'm to take you home." Anthea said stepping out of the car. John sighed and pulled out his phone to read his message that was no doubt from Sherlock.
"Oh, dull." Sherlock told him. Sherlock made plenty of money to afford whatever John wanted, John only needed to ask. But he knew that John would never just
"He's killed another one." Sherlock confirmed with a sigh as he stared at the pictures. John wondered what Sherlock was seeing, but figured when Sherlock was this far into his thoughts that the Alpha wouldn't want to be bothered by John asking him what he was seeing. With a sigh, John turned and started walking into the kitchen to make them both a cuppa only to freeze when Sherlock jumped from his seat and grabbed the computer. "Come John, we have somewhere to be."
"How fresh?" He asked never looking away from the body.
"What about the day he died? Can you tell me where he was?" Sherlock asked pointed at the empty space on the calendar that happened to the very day he needed.
"He's always been so resentful." Mycroft said and Sherlock scoffed. "You can imagine the Christmas dinner. I'm sure you'll experience one soon."
"Killed?" Sebastian asked.
"Lost five million in a single morning, made it all back a week later." Sebastian growled out. "Nerves of steel, Eddie had."
"Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive." John noted worried about how much Sherlock expected him to pay.
"Not the murderer, no." Sherlock agreed again.
"Seriously? This guy, a junkie?" John asked in disbelief and Sherlock tensed up before quickly making his way over to John and pulling him protectively and possessively against him, effectively cutting off anymore of John's arguments.
