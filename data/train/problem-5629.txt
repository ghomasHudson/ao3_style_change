“I wanted everyone out of my house, is a bit closer to the truth,” Stark said.  For a moment, he was silent, the toe of one boot bouncing against the top of the billiard table.  Finally, he nodded.  “Fine.  Poke around to your heart's content, Officer.  Any locked doors, I expect you to respect, but other than that-” He waved a hand through the air.  “Just stay out of the way.”
The word was sharp, hard, and Tony’s head swung around.  Obie was sitting in one of his leather arm chairs, his hands folded in his lap, his head tipped forward over the tip of his cigar.  The glowing tip cut through the soft cloud of white smoke that wreathed his face.  Tony gave him a smile.  It wasn’t returned.  “Yes?”
"And doing this, making this public, that changes the perception again, doesn't it?" Morrison asked. "You've altered your legacy here, Captain. Your war record is going to take a backseat to your personal life."
On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose,
The redhead in the neat black maid's outfit seemed to consider that.  “That is what Mr. Stark says,” she said, her eyebrows arching.  “And Mr. Stark is never wrong.”
For a long, still moment, Steve just studied him, his face unreadable.  Then his lips twitched up in a lopsided smile.  “Tony, if we were to break up, I don't know how much of  a life I'd have left.”
“Oh.  Oh!” Some of the tension went out of Steve’s shoulders.  “Yes.  I mean, yes, I kind of upped the number of guests, because a lot of our guys are, well, they’re pretty big eaters, and even if it’s just dessert, you know, I didn’t want to run out?”
“Aren't you supposed to be doing science?” Tony asked Bruce.  “I seem to recall some science on the schedule.”
She took a breath.  “He cannot accept who he is, until you do.  And at some point, he will lose that battle with himself.”  Her fingers whispered through the armor, and it fell apart, shattering to electronic fragments.  It rained down, whispering away into nothing, and whatever rage was sustaining him disappeared with it.
“I’d lay money that he’s been making the trip regularly, if not every night,” Steve said.  He turned to the room.  “Because he wasn’t here when our intruder arrived.”
He felt Steve laughing behind him, as much as he heard it.  “Oh, really?  What do you think is going to get the trend setters hot and bothered?  Is it my mismatched kitchen chairs?” His fingers smoothed over Tony's hair, playing with the strands.  “The chipped egg cups?  The novelty coffee cup full of kitchen utensils?”
Tony glanced over his shoulder at the elevator doors, nonplussed for a second. “You know we're on the twelfth floor, right?” he asked.
“Right,” he said, wobbling his way over to an armchair.  “What, exactly, did I do?”  Peter sat up.  He blinked owlishly at Tony.  Tony tried for a reassuring smile.  Peter smiled back.  Tony waited.  “Parker.”
"It's-  It's a joke," Tony said. Steve stared at him.  He sighed.  "Look, it's late, I'm tired, I'm banned from helping with the repairs-”
There was a second of pause, and then Greer emerged from under the table, her eyes squeezed into narrow slits.  She blinked at Bruce, then reached up and pushed her hair out of her face.  “Where am I?” she asked, her voice gritty.
“Well, that was your first mistake,” Darcy said, sliding her tray up the counter to the register.  “Never listen to Coulson.  At best it’s boring and at worst it’s terrifying.”
“I'm going to interpret that to mean 'a lot,'” Tony said.  “'A lot of books.'”  Tony held up a well-worn paperback.  “'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'?” he asked with a grin.
“Yes.”  In the silence that followed, Tony looked up.  Rogers was staring at him, his face unreadable.  Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “Was that a trick question?  Because you asked, and I answered, and you're doing something with your face there.”  He gestured at Rogers with his screwdriver, rotating the tip in his direction.  “I'm not sure what it is, but I suspect that it's disrespectful, so...”
“That’s our boy,” Bobbi said.  “I can swear in six languages, how about you?”  DJ thought about that, then held up four fingers.  Bobbi grinned at him, her legs thrown out in front of her, her cheek braced on one hand.  “This kid’s the best.”
“For Steve to discuss it with him?” Steve repeated.  But he was smiling, just a little.  Enough.  It was enough of a smile.
“All of my cooking falls under the category of 'stupid kitchen tricks,'” Tony said, and Steve laughed.  “Did you get drunk?  Are you hungover right now?  I've never seen you hungover.  I want pictures.  Send me a selfie.”
His Captain.  He smiled, and there was no humor in it.  At least Steve had made the right choice, when it came down to it.  When he came down to it, Steve always made the right choice.  “Yeah, that mortal thing, annoying,” Tony agreed.  He kicked a cabinet shut.  “So why didn’t you put him back where he belongs?”  He swept a tablet off of the workbench, savoring the way it smashed against the ground.  “Or is it too-”
“There’s a tree over there-” Sam started, and Steve gave him a look.  Sam’s lips twitched.  “Or not.”
“Spent it,” DJ said, leaning his chin on the table.  He poked the detergent again.  “And need Christmas presents.”
Walking across the lobby actually helped.  He had a destination, a clear goal.  Something to think about other than the confusing mix of things in his head.  He could boil everything down to crossing the lobby and avoiding being knocked over by a courier in a rush or an executive hurrying back from a late lunch.  He concentrated on keeping the cup still between his hands, on slipping through narrow gaps between people who looked right past him.
Tony gestured at the seat.  “Well, if I can’t stop you,” he mumbled into his coffee cup.  “Why ask?”
“I do apologize, but SHIELD reports that the repairs on the quinjet are nearly complete, and your presence is requested.”  The familiar voice, he now realized, was coming from the phone on the bedside table.  Tony's phone.  Steve picked it up.
She chuckled, glancing in his direction.  “They’ll get it done,” she said, her voice serene.  Her hands never stopped moving, the peel falling away from the blade of her knife and into the waiting bowl.  She paused, cutting away a chunk of bruised flesh.  “And God Almighty knows, they both have time for a bit of play.”
Val heaved an audible sigh, propping her hands on her hips.  “You're both going to be in such trouble,” she said.
“Tell me this isn't the first time a bad guy's tried to needle you about your sex life, Cap,” Tony said.  Steve glared in his general direction, and Tony flipped up the faceplate of the helmet, shock taking away whatever tact he might've possessed.  “Oh my God, it is.”
“No,” Steve said, and before Happy could grab him, he plowed forward, putting the full weight of his rage behind the force of his rush.  The shield slammed into someone, lifting a mobster off of his feet, and with a flick of his arm, Steve sent the body crashing into the side of a warehouse.  He spun on his heel, meeting another rush head on, his feet digging into the wood of the pier.
Tony gave the mylar bag a disdainful look.  “No, I refuse to be seen with you if you’re wearing a cheap Halloween Iron Man costume.”
The door opened up behind him, and something went over his head, settling around his neck.  Tony looked down.  Steve's dogtags gleamed, silver and rough, against the black fabric of the undersuit.  And there, tucked between the tags, was the platinum ring.  Tony's head snapped up, and Steve was smiling at him.  “There,” he said.  He held up his hand.  “I've got mine.  And you've got yours.”  He headed up the street. “Get the armor and let's go.  Your late for the debrief.”
“Looking forward to hitting the streets again.  Back then, I was a radical with a spatula and a knife, and I did more damage with the spatula,” Isaiah said.  He sounded gleeful, and considering the way he was handling the pastry brush, Tony was inclined to believe him.  “Now I'm just old.”
“Done,” Steve said, and he looked at the priest, giving him a smile and a nod.  The old man adjusted his glasses, nodding back.  Steve fished his phone out of his pocket.  “One second.”  He turned, grabbing Tony's arm to pull him in next to him. “Smile.”
Tony caught his hand and pressed a kiss against his palm.  “Promise,” he said, and gave Steve a brisk shove.  “On your back.  And I’ll show you just how fine I feel.”
He nodded.  “That's fair.”  He looked up at her.  “StarkIndustries doesn't make weapons any longer, does it?”
Happy leaned on the steering wheel while the gates were pulled open.  Beyond it, there was half a dozen men, big men with broad shoulders and stiff faces.  “Mr. Stane’s over ruled the boss.  He’s pulled a bunch of the guards off the factories, sent ‘em here.”
She bit her lower lip.  “If I did,” she said at last, “He wouldn’t still be in his house, Tony.  But…”
Steve took a breath, and then another.  “Right.  I-”  He shook his head.  “Sorry.  I didn't even think, I-”
He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  "Just Jarvis will do, please, sir.  I don't mean to interrupt your meal, but I require your assistance, if you don't mind."
Steve didn't reply.  He just leaned forward, his body pushing into the wind.  Tony leaned into his back, and settled in for the ride.
“Punch it,” Steve said, and Tony could hear the slight smile in his voice even over the comm.  “I'll let you know if I'm losing my grip.”
Once upon a time, there was a kingdom, that had stretched beyond its own reach, a kingdom that pressed against its own borders, even as its borders began to push back.  Once upon a time, there was a kingdom that stretched so high, it risked falling into its own shadow.
"Fine, I'm nine," Val said, her head swinging back and forth with enough force to send her bun bouncing on the back of her head.  “And I'm still more useful than you.”  She grinned at DJ, her freckled nose crinkling up.  “Right?”
"I'm considering it," she admitted, as Jan tucked a yellow and red rose into his pocket.  "She's very good at nudging you in the right direction."
Peter took a hopping step backwards towards his room.  “I can help, I can-  Just let me get my shoes-”
“It was the right choice for me.  I wasn't happy, I wasn't-”  His head dipped in a slight nod.  “I could've stayed there, Tony, in a five star restaurant, being a head chef.  As a rising star of a cuisine I barely liked.  Maybe even operating my own place someday.  I could've had, I don't know, a cooking show or a cookbook or a line of fancy pans that are absolutely over priced and sold to people who don't know any better.”
Steve wanted to pick him up.  To shake him.  To toss him, resisting or not, over his shoulder, and make him do exactly what Steve wanted him to do.  His fingers tightened, and it might’ve hurt.  It must’ve hurt.  But Tony just stared at him, defiance sharp in his face.  “So?” Tony bit out.  “What will you do?”
He didn’t, but mostly he didn’t want Harris to get up.  “No.”  But he struggled to his feet anyway, clumsy and awkward.  “I’ll.   Water.”  He stopped, glancing up at Harris, and then away.  “Want?”
"We could trade.  She could pull of my outfit," Steve said, and despite everything, this was easy, this was right.  Or wrong.  He didn't know any more.  He knew what he wanted, but that was one sided, that was just him.  That was his problem.
Clint gave them a thumbs up.  “Nat is good at distraction.  Things get rough, she'll make sure no one's looking at you.”
She studied him.  “Clint is very enthusiastic about getting you an annulment,” she said, and Tony groaned, his head falling back.  Natasha's lips twitched.  “I'll try to rein him in.”
Steve nodded. “Right,” he said, giving his shoelaces a quick tug.  “Maybe a long sleeve shirt, then.”
DJ turned the juice box around in his hands, his fingers tracing along the edges, measuring the length and height and depth of it.  “Seemed fair,” he said, at last.  He glanced up, his lips twitching in a slight smile.  “You needed to know.”
“You're a bad influence,” Steve said, even as he stripped his shirt over his head.  With a flick of his hand, he sent it tumbling down to the main floor of his apartment.
He was soaked now, his shirt was plastered to every inch of his body.  It was a torment and a tease, simultaneously hiding and calling attention to the breadth of his shoulders, the flex of his muscles, the hollow of his flat stomach.   He shifted, and his shorts, sodden and heavy, slipped down the angle of his hipbones.  Steve grabbed them with one hand, dragging them back up.
Jan pressed her fingertips to her chest.  "Oh, darling, it was nooooooothing," she said, before turning huge eyes on Steve.  "Steve?  Do you like it?"  She wrapped her arms around his bicep, hugging his arm.  "Tell me you like it."
“Cherries, or you’ve gone on a killing spree,” Tony said, smiling down at him.  “How many did you eat, my little scullery rat?”
"Did I say trouble?" Stark drawled, tugging the jacket into place and smoothing the fabric down with a flick of his hands.  "I meant an absolute nightmare of a dinner guest."
“Can we not?” Steve said, his head falling back.  He gripped the bench, wishing he was in the gym with the punching bag already.  Wishing that he could stop thinking, even for a few minutes.
Steve’s fingers touched his pocket, feeling the solid shape of his watch through the fabric.  “Yes.  You are.”
Jarvis paused.  “Yes,” he said at last.  “I suspect that might be the case.”  He lifted the domed lid from the tray.  “It will happen in circumstances like this.”
Steve looked up, caught off guard.  Rhodes was smiling at him, his broad face friendly and relaxed.  Still, Steve took a step back, his hand falling back to his side.  “Sorry,” he said.  “I wasn't thinking, it's-”  He glanced back at the car, caught by the look of it.  There was something beautiful about the flow of the metal, about the compact, clean lines, about the way the paint flowed over the surface, gleaming as if it was still wet.  “It's beautiful.”
“I'm going to put my laundry away,” he said, hefting the basket up onto his hip.  “I'm going to go upstairs and put this on my bureau.”  He arched his eyebrows.  “Can I trust you to stay still for the three minutes that will take?”
Tony took a breath, and another, and Jarvis was right there, right next to him, and he turned, burying his face in Jarvis’ side.  He’d half expected Jarvis to step away, to put distance between them, but instead, Jarvis wrapped his arms around Tony’s head, hugging him close.
“I know you are,” she said.  “I know you are.  Tell Tony that he keeps using the word ‘dying’ and that’s not helping, it’s…  Women don’t like to hear ‘dying.’  Even if it’s prefaced by ‘not,’ we have this panic response to the word dying and Pepper does not like to panic, so...”
Steve’s fingers brushed across the bandage, and the skin above, and Tony sucked in a breath.  Steve snatched his hand back.  “Sorry, I-”
Jarvis pushed the door open, waving Steve in.  "Based on what you said, I thought perhaps this room might be a better match for our young guest."
She took a deep breath.  “So.  I have a crush.”  She held up a hand, finger and thumb an inch away from each other.  “Just…  A little one.  But I was thinking of-” Another shrug, her hand falling back to her lap. “Doing something about it?”
There was music playing, a jazz piece with a driving bass line and a bright, brassy horn section, and it echoed through the penthouse.  Tony found himself moving in that direction, chasing the warmth and light, cajoled by the smell of tomatoes and garlic, and the swirl of someone else's music.
“Man of all work,” Peter said, with a wide, proud grin.  He set the basket down, revealing the piles of multicolored apples and pears inside.  “Bruce said he'll be in when he's finished with the weeding.”
“It's a proportional response,” Gyrich said.  “Something that I specialize in.  Which is why I'm not having you all detained for damage to government property.”
“I'm going to hang up on you,” he said, because really, Rhodey should know that this friendship was hanging by a thread.
The word was small and soft, barely audible in the echoes of noise from the other apartments.  Steve glanced over at the chair, where DJ still hadn't moved.  He took a deep breath.  "You know you can't," he said, setting his shoes aside.  "No one's going to let a single Irish cop take a kid."
Tony glanced at the stacks of boxes piled near the fireplace.  He refused to acknowledge just how many were scattered around the room. “And how is it that we have suddenly manifested quite this…  Volume of decorations?” he asked.
“They offered him a large sum to set the fire at the boat house, as a distraction, and using the surrounding chaos as cover, to make sure that the gate was open.  Likely he was offered a partial payment up front, with the rest to be handed over when he accomplished his tasks.  Maybe he was going to get paid that night, maybe he was supposed to meet up with the fixer later for his payout.  There are risks to both.  You don’t want to be caught by the police that sort of money if you’re searched, but if you agree to a payment later, there’s a chance it’ll never happen.
Something moved, just behind him, the scrape of something against the stone, and Steve moved before he’d even fully registered what he was doing.  In an instant, he’d spun to face the threat, angling his body in front of Tony’s, pushing him back against the side of the staircase with one arm.  Tony, caught off guard, stumbled backwards, and Steve was in front of him, free arm up and ready to strike.
Tony looked at Peter.  Peter shook his head.  “I can’t….  I think I’ll throw up if you make me answer the phone, chef,” he said.
“I’m too tired to get turned on,” Tony said, which was absolutely, totally, 100% a lie, and judging by the way that Steve’s eyes danced, he knew it  “Okay, so I’m rather painfully aroused, I’m too tired to do anything about it.”
“So that someone can get a kiss, if they want a kiss,” Carol said with a smile.  She threw her hands out.  “We’re here for kisses!”
“Or, if you insist on being difficult, I’ll take my time on our way out of this house.  I have plenty of bullets, Tony.  I’m just curious where I should start.  The pathetic Parker child?  He idolizes you, it’ll be a pleasure to tell him that it’s your fault he’s about to die.  His aunt?  Or that disrespectful old relic you insist upon keeping upon your payroll?”
“Oh, thank you, always so sweet, you are,” Mrs. Parker said.  She paused, letting DJ drop the last few Marbles into the jar.  “Thank you, dear.”  She straightened up. “Peter, are you going down to the garden?  Why don't you take DJ with you.”
“Right, that's...   That's not going to slow him down,” Rogers said.  Tony stared at him, and for the first time, Rogers smiled, just a little, that wide, beautiful mouth curling up.  “But he wouldn't leave without his things, so he's still here, somewhere.”
“Adults don't think kids know about things,” Val said.  She tossed her head from side to side, the movement sudden and almost violent, her hair tumbling around her shoulders, around her face.  “I think they tell themselves we don't, because it makes them uncomfortable if they have to think about us thinking about things.”
Once on the elevator, he slumped against the wall.  He fumbled the bag with the scone into the curve of his elbow, and let his eyes fall shut.  “Jarvis?”
Steve’s fingers flexed, and the metal handle on the trashcan lid twisted in his grip.  “They won’t,” he said, and turned back towards the alley where the second man had been hiding.
“I think she’s mad,” Tony said, and he was laughing, halting little bursts of something close to giggles.
“Good.  Let’s try for dry.  Something to aim for.  Goals.” Tony headed towards the office  “It’s good to have goals.”
DJ was nodding before he even finished asking the question, and Steve bit back a sigh.  “Okay,” he said.  “You didn't eat much this morning.”
Understanding dawned.  “Ah.  That’s why you went into the lobby.”  Clea nodded, and Tony huffed out a breath.  “Okay, that was, that was nice of you, I appreciate it, I do, but next time, can you just-” He flexed his fingers in a ‘popping’ gesture.  “Aim for the elevator, and Jay can tell you if it’s a good time, and also let me know you’re on your way up?  Because I don’t pay the security staff enough to try to get me on the phone.”
“Yeah, I’m a delight,” Sam agreed, and against his will, Steve smiled.  Sam rubbed a hand over his mouth.  “Seriously, though-”
“Here, I've got him,” Rogers said, stepping around Tony.  He crossed to the loveseat, and leaned over to scoop the boy up against his chest.  DJ settled into his arms, letting out a massive yawn before he buried his face in Rogers' shoulder.  “Brat,” Rogers said, but the look on his face was soft and affectionate, so full of warmth that Tony's stomach rolled over.
"Yes, yes, you're a funny guy, and I'm very easy when it comes to you, which you should know, after all the years we've been friends," Tony said.  He gestured at the room at large with his lousy paper cup of coffee.  "So you should know, I never make things harder than they have to be."
“Better you than me,” Tony said.  He looked like he had a headache.  “Deej, do you really trust this clown car’s worth of wizards to handle this?”’
Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “I can work anywhere,” he said.  “You can drive.  I can curse out my latest design in the back.”
“And I’m standing there, not having any clue what the hell is going on, but I don’t have any bullet holes in me, I’m not in handcuffs, and Nat isn’t trying to bludgeon me, so…  I mean, all things considered, that’s about the best I could hope for.  So I look at Nat, and she shrugs, and says, ‘he wants you to make breakfast.’”
“The Virgin Mary will do her best for us, I’m sure, but Hearst prevers his tithing in cold, hard cash,” Pepper pointed out.
He glanced up just in time to see DJ's face twist into an expression of frustration.  "Jarvis, you rat," he mumbled into his folded arms.
“Don't even joke about that,” Rhodey said.  He stabbed a finger in Tony's direction.  “You try it, and I'm going to prop you up in a congressional hearing and let them have at you.”
Tony paused, halfway to the bedroom door.  “Right,” he said, scraping a hand over his jaw.  He needed a shave.  And a shower.  And a change of clothes.  He huffed out a breath.  “Fuck it.  He's seen me looking worse.  And I need coffee.”
Steve looked down at the bowl, surprised to find it empty.  “No, I’m full.”  He picked it up both bowls and carried them to the sink.  “It was good, though.”  He glanced at Clint.  “What was it?”
“Well, you'll just have to wait for him to wake up and then ask him, then,” Sam said.  His eyebrows arched.  “And in the meantime, you have anything else to say?”
Obie was already shaking his head.  “Anthony, nothing would make me happier, you know that.  You’re such a clever boy, so-”  He paused, a faint smile creasing his cheeks.  “You know, when your father died, I thought we would lose you, too.”
T’Challa’s eyes slid shut, and Steve hid a smile behind his hand.  “I’m sure the next few weeks will just fly by,” he said.
Both of them looked up to find Rhodes standing in the door of the kitchen.  He was dressed casually, in pants and  long sleeve shirt rolled up to his elbows.  He glanced at Steve, giving him a polite smile and nod, but his attention was clearly on Miss Potts.  “It's late, Miss Potts.”
Steve's spoon hit the bottom of the bowl, and he stood, collecting the empty china.  “Well, I understand wanting to keep your secrets.  I just wanted to say, I was raised to properly mind my business.”   He gave them a slight smile.  “And protect people I like.”
The boys ran past, Peter’s feet sliding on the wet floor.  Steve rubbed a hand over his mouth, trying to hide his smile.  “And more than enough energy,” he said.
“Merry Christmas, small one,” Thor said, scooping him up.  “Are you eager for your gifts?  I have one for you, straight from my mother’s hands to yours.”
Tony nodded.  “Were they dicks about not having reservations, when we were fully booked for tonight roughly eighteen months ago?”
This story was always going to end this way.  Steve was too stubborn to let himself be charmed into staying.
DJ watched as her fingers went white as the braid tightened on her skin.  “I don't...  He doesn't... Think about it,” he said, the words halting.  “They forget.  That I am, I am still me.”  That wasn't right, and he had to stop and think about it, think about the syntax, the rhythm, the way that words worked, what it meant.  “That I have always been me.”
“IS IT HORRIBLE?” Jan said, already scrambling to her feet, hitting the ground running.  “Please tell me it's horrible!”
Hammer's shoulders slumped, and Steve set the proverbial hook with a smile. “But if I'm here, maybe Happy...” He let the words trail away, leaving the rest to Tony.
“Yes, but we’ll be judging your conversation, so, feel free to have phone sex,”  Carol said cheerfully.
Tony watched him go.  “Just out of curiosity,” he said, and his throat ached on the words.  “If I hadn't gotten sick, would you ever have had me over?”
“Looking for crimes?” Natasha said, one shoulder rising and falling in a shrug.  She hopped up, one hip braced on the top of the wall, her legs crossed at the ankles.  “I mean, there's no shortage of those around.”
"All right, all right," Steve said, and Stark was laughing now, a hand over his head, trying to fend off the petals.  Without thinking, Steve brought up the kite, holding it above their heads like an umbrella, like the shield he'd pretended it to be.  "I think we've killed enough flowers for the day, don't you?"
“Sorry, Jarvis,” he said, as Tony flopped back against his chest.  Laughing, Steve looped his arms around Tony’s waist.  Tony grumbled under his breath, but settled back into the comfort of Steve’s embrace.  “I didn’t think you’d be back for a while.”
He took a deep breath, slipping through the door and pulling it shut behind him.  “Excuse me,” he said, “I think you’re in my seat.”
“I’m aware.”  Tony’s head tipped up, his mouth nuzzling at the side of Steve’s neck.  “But the bots are in diagnostic for the rest of the day, Dummy included, the terror triplets are at SHIELD, overthrowing something or someone just to keep their skills sharp, Bruce is at a holiday party down at Empire University and Thor’s fanclub’s in Asgard until Christmas eve.”
"I don't see any reason to get up," Tony said, his eyes sliding closed.  "The floor is my-" He waved a hand through the air.  "This is a good floor.  It's cool here.  Comfortable."
“The fate of entire countries hang on the two of you,” Bucky said, leaning his shoulder against the kitchen doorway.  “May the Goddess have mercy on all of us.”  He straightened up.  “Let’s go, Princess.  I’ll walk you back to the palace.”
Tony glanced at the screen, where the leading lady, who had traded in her flannel and jeans for a filmy white dress cup up to her hip, was wandering aimlessly on a beach.  On the other side of the beach, her soon-to-be beau was wandering, just as aimless, just as pointless.  "About twelve more songs, three chase sequences, and a pie fight," Tony said, before taking a sip of his beer.
Tony tucked his cheek against her hair. “Me, too,” he whispered back. “But I don't regret it, Pep. I'll never regret you and me.” He tipped his head to the side, brushing a gentle kiss against her copper locks. He took a step back, tugging her along with him. “I don't regret much.”
Before he could step away, Tony cupped a hand on the back of his neck, his fingertips rubbing against the skin there.  “We’re not doing the apology thing,” he said, his voice warm.  “Because if we start down that road, I’m going to be on the losing end, and I refuse.”
Tony paused, his coffee cup halfway to his mouth.  “Not…  What?” he asked, and Obie pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Right.  Where it’s a little quieter,” Tony said.  He held out a twenty dollar bill to her.  “If he has a reply, will you bring it to me?”
“DJ, tell him to let me have fun,” Jan said.  She ducked her head behind his.  “Tony, you should let Jan plan our movie night!” she said, mimicking a little boy’s voice.
“He’s way more annoying than you,” Clint said to Tony.  “Which, you know, I wouldn’t have believed, but here we are.”  He slapped the side of the car.  “C’mon, kid, it’s a long drive back into the city, and you might be able to fly, but I can’t, and I’m not getting stuck with this much tension in the back seat.”
“I'll follow you anywhere,” Tony said, and to his shock, he meant it.  He honestly meant it.  He grinned up at Steve.  “Name it.”
She stepped back, and Jesse stepped up next to her.  “Okay,” she said, her voice quiet.  “What am I missing?”
Steve took a step forward, and another, staring down into the passage that had opened up in front of his feet.  He couldn’t see the bottom, he couldn’t see anything beyond the first five or six steps, but he could feel the movement of air, hinting at a massive, monstrous space beyond the reach of his eyes.  A faint, soft swirl of music, melancholy and soft, came with it, a siren’s call that made his breath still in his chest.
“Jarvis said that you haven’t been sleeping well,” Steve said, and when Tony looked up at him, he smiled.  “To be honest, neither have I.”
But he was hungry.  He was always hungry.  He swallowed his pride, and followed her down the winding staircase to the kitchens.
“Of course.”  She looked at Steve, a faint, amused smile curling her lips.  “If you'll just follow me, Officer, I'll show you the way to the dining room.”
Tony smiled.  “Okay.”  His finger tapped against the angle of his knee.  He thought about how DJ had folded in on himself, his arms wrapped around his head, his eyes squeezed shut.  “Was it too loud?”
“In your general direction, yes.”  She reached out, catching his hand in hers.  “Tony.  Let him try.”
“I wanted a dress shirt,” Tony said.  His head fell forward, coming to rest in the center of Steve’s chest..  “A tie.  Is a tie really too much to ask?”
“And I'll still love you.”  Steve hung up, grinning at Sam as he wobbled his way across the parking lot.  “Wow.  You're looking...”  He shook his head.  “Rough.”
“Miss Potts gave the staff a tip,” Tony said.  He caught her hand, and pressed the bill into it.  “Because Miss Potts is better at these things than Mr. Stark is.”  He gave her a quick smile.  “I don’t want to take him back in there, so I’m trusting you’ll deliver the message.”
Steve chuckled.“What, the four shirts I own?  No, thank you, Jarvis, I think I’ve got this under control.  I’ll be out of your way, soon enough.” Steve tossed the clothes onto the bed next to his rucksack.
“You’ve been time travelling again,” Clea said.  She was pacing across the ceiling, paging through the book in her hand.  “Good afternoon, DJ.”
"Really."  Pepper braced her elbow on the arm of the chair and propped her chin on her hand.  "And how will I know?"
“Best I’ve had, but you’re the expert.”  Tony pulled a glass bottle from the fridge and tossed it to Steve.  “Pure cane sugar, real vanilla.”
"This was my idea for other people, not me.  I was not involved in these plans,” Stark pointed out.  “All of my best ideas involve things for other people and not me.”
“That’s fine, it’s-” was as far as Tony got; the boy was already off and running, his long legs eating up the length of the massive corridor.  Tony shook his head.  “Want to wait here?” he asked DJ.  DJ shook his head, and Tony smiled down at him.  “Me, neither.  Let’s go follow him.”
He’d fallen, amid the wreckage of his entire life, with the flaming fragments of his best intentions chasing him the entire way, he’d fallen and fallen and fallen, and he knew what it was like, when the armor failed, when he failed, when there was nothing between him and the welcoming cradle of the ground than whatever he could conjure up, blood on his fingers, in his mouth, blood like water in his eyes.
“I knew he was going to cheat on you, I just gave him the opportunity, and he took it with both hands and a tongue,” Bucky yelled from down below.  “Asshole's lucky I didn't toss him out the nearest window.”
“Look, Coulson made it clear that I could be charged as an accessory after the fact, and I am, as we all know, a law-abiding citizen with a vested interest in avoiding scandal at all cost-” He gave Harris an innocent look.  “I was forced to comply with his demands.”
"But otherwise, spot on," Tony agreed.  He tried to roll over, batting ineffectively at Bucky's leg.  "God, stay on your own side, you-"
Tony was silent for a long moment.  "Come on out," he said.  "I'll meet you back at the tower, we'll get a pizza and put on 'It's a Wonderful Life' and-"
“Not on purpose,” Bruce said.  He adjusted his glasses on his nose.  “This could be a problem.  We, we know that right?”
DJ's head popped up on the other side of the desk, and Tony's breath left him in something like a sob.  “It's okay,” he said, “it's okay, I'm sorry, it's going to be fine, don't be afraid.  It's going to be fine, I promise, just-”
"The cat spent the night with our young guest, and he seems quite healthy," Jarvis said, striding out of the closet, a neatly pressed suit draped over his arms.  He spread it over the end of the bed, his hands careful.  "What do you think?" Jarvis asked DJ.  DJ clambered up to his knees, considering the suit.  He looked up and gave Jarvis a firm nod.  Jarvis's face relaxed into a slight, gentle smile.  "I agree.  It is one of my favorites."
Steve kissed him, and Tony’s arms dropped, looping around Steve’s waist, his fingers digging into the fabric of his shirt.  For a long, infinitely long moment, Steve just sank into the kiss, savoring the pressure of Tony’s grip, the weight of Tony’s body against his.  The loud, sharp blast of a car horn cut made them both jump, and Tony pulled away, his lips parted, his shoulders heaving with the force of his breathing.
“Cute that I’m going to let you fly around impersonating me,’ Tony said.  His jaw hurt, his shoulders hurt, and his chest hurt.  He soldiered on despite all of that, or maybe because of it.  “You’re absolutely going to get in the car.”
“I loved your father like a brother,” Obie said.  “You know I did.  And I admired what he did, how he moved mountains, how he made entire industries from next to nothing.”
As one, everyone looked at Tony.  Tony just took a long sip of his milkshake, the straw rattling against the bottom of his cup as he drained it, his eyes locked on his phone.  He set the cup down on what remained of Mjolnir’s bar, and then the phone next to it.  “Honestly,” he said, “that wasn’t nearly as bad as I was expecting.”
“My life has been really fucking weird,” Clint said, slapping a ‘THIS World’s Greatest Archer’ nametag on his chest.  It was his sixth one, including ‘I’m the hot one.’.  He went to work on what was going to be his seventh.
Tony turned in his seat to face Harris, oblivious to the horns blaring all around them. “He has WHAT?”
"Good."  Wiping her eyes, Pepper straightened up.  "Oh, I haven't laughed like that in so long."  She looked up, letting the sunlight warm her cheeks.  "In forever."  She sat down at the table, pulling a chair out for DJ.  “Bruce, sit down, I'll split my strudel with you.”
Steve’s nose wrinkled.  “It’s not really an egg cream unless you order it at a grimy corner store with a bunch of bookies in the back room and a bunch of old men taking up every stool at the counter,” he said.  “There’s a tradition here that needs to be respected.”
“Nope,” Tony said.  Harris opened his mouth, and Tony held up a hand.  “Steve is a mother duck at heart.  He knows where his ducklings are.”
He gave her a half bow, inclining his head.  “Then, please.  Do not let me interrupt.”  He tossed his reins over a nearby branch, and took the water flask from Steve with a nod of thanks.
"It doesn't matter." The rage sat in the pit of her stomach, hot and caustic, and she focused on that. It was easier to handle than the shame, the self-hatred. She sucked in a breath. "There's no excuse. There's nothing that makes that right. That was not-" She squeezed her eyes shut, ignoring how they burned. "It wasn't my story to tell, and I did it anyway, and that's-" She shook her head. "I outed you. And there's no excuse for that. Ever." She chewed her lip, telling herself that she didn't taste copper, didn't taste iron. "Not ever."
By the flickering light of the lantern, he crossed the fields, keeping the sound of the running water on his right.  Down in a hollow of the land, next to a bend in the river, the old weeping willow bent low over the water.  Its long, trailing branches swung in the breeze, the leaves rattling with every move.  Tony ducked down, following the path under the sheltering branches.
Tony’s mouth worked for a moment.  “He’s gone, Steve.”  Too late, Steve realized that he was shaking, his hands in fists at his sides.  “I-”  Tony’s voice broke, and his head went down, and then back up, his chin a hard line.  “He’s gone, and it’s...”
“He has a special talent for that, and you, you get away from my horse,” she said.  Bucky looked at her over the horse’s back, his eyes slits behind the shaggy weight of his hair.  She scowled at him. “I can put on a saddle, you fool, I don’t need your-”
“A careful magic user can slip past, without even being noticed.”  She tapped the skeleton of the armor, right in the middle of its chest, and Tony’s arm twitched, the urge to cover the arc reactor almost irresistable.  “Usually, an apprentice will gain confidence and skill, rather than power.  They will learn.  They will grow.”
“Surprise,” Tony said, and she looked up, meeting his eyes.  For a moment, she just stared at Tony, expressions flickering over her face, one after another.  Steve waited, amused, for the other shoe to drop.
"Got it," Natasha said, coming through the door, towing Clint behind her.  He appeared to be half-asleep, still wearing a pair of faded purple pajama pants with a massive hole in one knee and a t-shirt that had been white once upon a time.  Now, it was an indistinct sort of gray.
“You know they've got stairs, right?” Steve shot back. He was breathing hard, and Tony grinned at his back, loving him so much it hurt.
Steve arched up, stealing one more kiss.  “I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure we can figure it out on the way.”
“Knowing Thor, they’ll be on the roof in twenty minutes,” Jan said.  She closed the file and offered it to Pepper.  “Want a closer look?”
The thought sustained him, and he was humming to himself as he wrestled the front door open.  Snow swirled around the damp cuffs of his pants, dusting the polished marble.  The wind kicked up, and he slammed the door behind him, trying to trap whatever warmth the house had left.
Steve tried to smile back.  "You've got more faith in me than I do."  He let his head fall back, staring up at the clean, white ceiling until it blurred. “I...”  His eyes closed.  “I think about it.  Sometimes.  About-”  He rubbed the back of his neck, trying to massage away the tension there.  “About not being me.  About being someone who can just-”
“The Frenchest,” Tony said, grinning down at his paperwork.  He crossed off a clause in a contract with a heavy hand.
“Except I’m not,” Steve said.  “I’m-” He shook his head.  “I am a soldier, sir.  Your Majesty.  I’m not equipped for court or nobility.”
“How do I make you stop?” Tony said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out his credit card.  “How do I make all of this stop?”
“Your girlfriend lives in SPACE,” Steve pointed out.  “She moved to SPACE to get away from you, what do you think-”
“Yes, ma’am,” Steve said, and when May turned towards the door, Tony wiggled his fingers in Steve’s direction in a little good-bye wave.  DJ, peeking at him over May’s shoulder, giggled.  Steve arched an eyebrow, but before he could retaliate, May nudged him towards the door.  Steve threw his hands in the air, a clear gesture of surrender.  “I’m going!”
“No,” DJ said.  He was sitting on the hood of the car, letting Darcy adjust his flower crown.  “You’re fine.” Without moving his head, he glared at them out of the corner of his eyes.  “You’re both fine.”
“I’d encourage you to try, ‘cause I’m pretty sure even you would have trouble doing any lasting damage with a shirt box, but hey.” Sam stepped into Steve’s apartment, heading for the kitchen.  “You do you.”
“Don't worry, he keeps the truly outrageous things for himself,” Pepper called.  “There's plenty of more staid selections in the closet to the right of the entrance.”  She held out a hand to DJ, who allowed himself to be coaxed off the stairs.  “Pick whatever fits, and that you're comfortable with.”
Laughing, Tony pushed his way out the front door and onto the sidewalk, slipping his sunglasses on before the camera flashes could blind him.  “Evening,” he called.  “What are you all doing here?  Slow news cycle?”
“That sounds likely,” Miss Potts said, breaking a scone apart with her fingers.  She gave Steve a gamine smile.  “There are bowls there to the right of the stove.”
Harris stood there, his tray balanced between this hands.  “How…  Does talking about it make it worse?” he asked at last.
Ty lunged forward, grabbing the journal, and Tony grabbed his wrist, holding on with a death grip.  “Don’t you dare,” he said, his chest burning as he met Ty’s eyes. “Unless you’d like to explain to your father what happened to it.”
“My-”  Tony’s stomach dropped, a sickening twist of nausea.  Jan tried to smile, but it died, half formed on her lips.  Tony shoved a hand through his hair.  “Jan.  Everything hinges on that-”
When they finally broke apart, Steve was breathing hard, and Tony was cursing under his breath.  “Oh, fuck this,” he said, bracing his hands on the back of the couch and vaulting over it.  Laughing, Steve caught him, both of them tumbling awkwardly back onto the couch.
His breath left him in a sound like a sob, and he was out of his seat in an instant, throwing himself forward.  And Steve met him halfway, clumsy with the force of it, catching DJ in a hug that was too tight, and too much, and just what he needed.  DJ buried his face in Steve’s shoulder and held on, his fingers digging into Steve’s shirt.
“Yes, well, some of them are very thick, and you misplace your stepstool often enough,” Pepper pointed out.  With a faint sigh, she settled back in her chair, reaching for her tea cup. “You are a master of re-purposing things.”
“We'll try to keep the party to a dull roar,” Rhodey said with a yawn.  He braced his chin on his folded arms.  “For a while at least.  Out of respect.”
Steve didn't say anything.  Tony wasn't even sure that he heard him.  But then, in a sudden, almost frightening rush, he rolled over, pressing his face into Tony's stomach.  Tony's breath left him in a rush, the shock of the contact rolling over his skin in a wave of heat.  “Don't-” he choked out, but Steve had already gone still again, his body curled forward, one hand in a fist next to Tony's hip.
“I suspect it would take a great deal more effort than I’m willing to dedicate to the task,” Agatha admitted.  She went back to her soup.  “And the only one likely to be able to control the situation is our young friend here.”
"In," Tony breathed, and Peter scrambled up over the railing, all awkward long legs and skinny arms.  Tony got his legs under him, pushing himself upright.  "Are you all right?"
“Yes?” he said, because Rogers seemed to be waiting for a response.  Rogers stared at him, his face incredulous.  Tony huffed out a breath.  “Do you have a problem with the room?” he asked, maintaining a polite tone with a force of will.  “It's the best guest room we have.”
Steve smiled at him, and it didn't feel as fake as he'd thought it would.  "Still here," he said.  They were alone in the conference room, and he didn't know when that had happened, exactly.  When the others had left.
“Yeah, that can happen,” he said, his fingers closing around an emergency glowstick.  “Close your eyes, I want to see what we're working with here.”
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Tony told him.  “My ego can always use a good stroking, sir, and I’ve no objection to you doing just that.” His hands went still, and his expression softened into a slight, easy smile.  “I like this one.”
Bruce took it from him, a very tired look on his face.  “Really,” he said, and there was a pleading note to the single word.  “Really, we’re telling the nice police officer, uh, how you-” His eyes flicked towards Steve, his expression wary.   “How you got your job?”
“Rogers,” Phil said, and Clint had known that was coming and yet, he wasn’t prepared for it, not at all.
“Yep.”  Steve boosted Tony over the threshold.  “I don't need much room.”  It was true, really.  The kitchen was all that mattered, and he'd made the kitchen into exactly what he wanted it to be.  Everything else had been secondary, to the point where he'd spent years sleeping on a couch or a broken futon rather than waste money on a proper bed.
Clint ducked past Carol, dragging a fishing net behind him.  “He’s in the quinjet,” he said, readjusting his grip on the ropes.  “Bruce was worried about hypothermia.”
What an odd word choice 'Need'. The word crept up his spine rendering him silent as it reached his brain, settling deep within its crevices. Sinking.
"C'mon let me help you." He spoke, his tone caring more worry in this one moment than all the worry Howard ever had for Tony in his entire life. He reached down to help up Tony, but Tony couldn't help but panic. It was a deranged paranoid thought, but he was convinced that if Steve touched him, he'd figure everything out.
Jesus Christ. Pepper. His love, his life, his one and only. He looked down at the ring on his finger and never more badly had he wanted to curl up in a ball and die. It was a symbol of faith to the woman who did everything for him. Who he'd've died without, either at the hands of a villain, booze, or himself. He loved her more than himself, though that wasn't a measure of much really, and more than the world.
He was sitting on the bed before he even knew it, obediently." The desire had sunk so deep into his soul it was apart of him.
"Jeez Tony, from the amount you talk about Steve, sometimes it feels like you need him far more than you hate the guy." Hawkeye had remarked from across the Avengers Facility lounge room as Tony seemed to be venting about the Blonde Captain for the second time that day to Banner.
Tony couldn't get him to shut up,  no matter how he begged so he silenced him the only way he could think of in his sleep-deprived brain. He screamed, loud and horrific, it sounded like murder.
"You sure? You know if you ever wanna talk I'm here for you alright Tony?" He remarked, voice pitying as he put a hand on Tony's shoulder. He hated it, he didn't deserve it. He brought this upon himself.
Tony was a rapidly deteriorating engine, fueled by nothing but black coffee and extra strength 5-hour energy drinks.
It was skin more weathered than his own, smile lines from years of schmoozing but with empty calculating eyes, and to top it all off slicked back white hair adorned his head.
Tony's body was mere molasses, the world a slow amber haze of warmth and sound. It was like molten lava was pumped into his veins, and his brain, for all it was worth, was sinking.
His conscious it chimed to remind him exactly who he was. In a dead man's voice all too familiar to the brunette. Nagging at all his flaws, his imperfections, how he was useless in every way. A good for nothing runt, a failure of a stark constantly overshadowed by a man who hated him in life and probably still was disgusted by him now in his grave. However, even this seemed not enough as in came the final blow.
Tony saved him. Tony, who's spent the evening obviously feeling like dirt and to all appearances has been unable to function, saved his life. Tony foiled Ghost's plan, knocked him out, and saved Steve's life.
"Now, then," Tiberius began. "You've said that you believe I owe Mr. Stark an apology for... defaming him?" He raised his eyebrows, inviting Steve to quibble with his word choice.
The door swings open and Tony's on the other side, smiling at him as the morning sunshine from the huge banks of windows behind him outlines his tousled hair and edges him in light.
Mordo was pretty much exactly as Tony had expected, which was a feat when Tony considered the fact that he didn't think he'd ever met the man in person before. He was dressed as if Hydra had raided a magician's costume shop, although Tony figured the preference for green and yellow was probably just a coincidence. He had a patterned, high-collared green cape, and a green and yellow outfit covered in symbols that probably meant something to his fellow magicians. Tony thought he looked ridiculous, but Tony was also fully aware that most people probably wouldn't consider him, Iron Man, in a good position to judge anyone else for looking ridiculous. People still teased him about the goddamn nose armor, and he'd gotten rid of that years ago.
"Well, then," Tony said, gently sliding two fingers over Steve's opening, "here's a bit of the real Iron Man inside you first, just to get you ready, okay?"
No time like the present. Steve took a deep breath. He started at Tony's hip, pressing a kiss there, because even though he knew he wasn't going to be great at this, he knew he could at least do his best by heightening the anticipation as much as possible. He kissed his way over Tony's hipbone, his destination obvious, as beneath him Tony shivered and trembled, breathing noisily, like he had to remind himself every few seconds to keep breathing.
Well, he definitely looked like one of Tony's fellow billionaires. His smile was blinding white, his skin perfectly tanned and even. His hair was artfully highlighted and cut fashionably long, his beard neatly trimmed; he'd probably spent more on his last haircut than Steve had spent in a lifetime. He was muscular, well-built, and rather astonishingly good-looking; his was the kind of sculpted beauty that suggested that it, too, had been more expensive than anyone else could afford.
Then Tiberius lifted his head again. "And, as I'm sure you know, Captain, I made a statement taking full responsibility for Mr. Stark's visit to Donahue Development. Mr. Stark was there on business, on my behalf." He looked at the camera, beseeching. "I don't know what else you want from me, Captain. I've already apologized."
Abruptly, Steve remembered Tony and Tiberius kissing. He remembered every detail vividly; his memory was never going to let him forget. Tiberius' hand had been at Tony's waist, starting to slide up under his shirt. Tony's hand had been around Tiberius' wrist. Steve had assumed Tony had been encouraging him, welcoming his touch. Steve had, in fact, been jealous of everything Tony had let Tiberius do to him.
Then several things happened in quick succession, so fast that Tony's mind gave up on making sense of them after the first one.
"You're going to think I--" Steve began, and he started chuckling, and he couldn't finish his sentence. He took another breath and tried again. "In my defense, I'd completely forgotten everything other than how much I liked the ending when I recommended it to you. I'd just like you to know that."
Shuddering, Tony audibly catches his breath, the sound fuzzing in Steve's earpiece, but he's trying -- by the third or fourth breath, he's matched Steve. Contrary to what the rest of the world believes about Tony Stark, he's actually very good at following orders. And while Steve would much rather have continued to make use of that trait in more pleasant and more private circumstances, they're here now, and this is what's going to keep Tony alive. Tony's going to do exactly what Steve tells him to do, because his life depends on it. And he's good enough that he's going to get it right. He has to. There's no other choice.
Tony gave a soft chuckle, and when Steve turned to look at him, he was smiling -- smiling in a way Steve might have even called
"But if we can wake him up, I think we'd better," Steve added. "Speaking as the fella who's probably going to be held for questioning if they find me next to his body."
"It's not, though." The words were slurred frantically against Steve's shoulder. "It's really not okay."
That's another new word. One of the things he likes about Iron Man is that he's careful with his words, trying not to use too many words Steve doesn't know. He always tells Steve what they mean if he asks, and he never makes fun of him for not knowing.
"Great," Carol said, and promptly lifted him up in a bridal carry. "Let me know if I bang your arm. Or leg."
Steve took a deep breath. He was going to speak slowly and calmly. If he raised his voice, he lost this. Being right wasn't enough. He also had to have the right tone. And maybe that wasn't fair either, but that was how it was. This was what he needed to do to fight for Tony.
It was going to be a couple minutes for the water to boil. Steve walked back around the kitchen counter, then boosted himself up to sit on the other edge of it, facing Tony and the position he'd staked out several feet away on the couch. Tony regarded him with a certain amount of wary interest.
Tony stands up and Steve tries to follow him, only to find that he can't quite balance right. He leans against the desk. His legs are shaking and his thoughts are slow like honey. He knows what's supposed to happen now. This is when the game ends.
"I've always been glad about that," Tony says. His voice is shaking. "Even if you don't remember that now. Maybe-- maybe you'll still remember that, when you wake up."
Tony's hand tightened just a little more, his thumb slipping over the head of Steve's cock with a little more confidence -- Steve was going to bet that he was Tony's first experience with an uncut guy -- but, God, he was so good. Steve couldn't help but rock his hips up, and, wow, that was taking him way too close. If Tony wanted to do anything else with him, it needed to be soon.
His thoughts were very slow to come together, cushioned in a dreamy medicated haze. He was aware, distantly, that he had a body and that his body was most likely in some amount of discomfort, but he found he didn't really care to contemplate that.
He's not exactly in the mood to let Steve go, so he's reduced to rolling his hips against him in illustration.
Tony's contributions to the discussion so far had included recounting his father's physical abuse, two heart attacks, his previous drinking binge, and impromptu heart surgery without anesthesia. Steve didn't think he wanted to hear the thing that Tony thought could top that.
Wrapped around Steve's side, Iron Man's fingers tighten for a second, and then his grip relaxes as he gently strokes up and down Steve's ribs. It would be easy to fall asleep like this. But he shouldn't.
Tony was probably worrying he was getting cold feet. After all, Steve hadn't done this before, and it wasn't like he wasn't nervous, a little. Every step took him farther and farther into new territory. But he wanted this. He did. It was just a little hard to say, because it was new, because it was okay now when it hadn't been okay before.
Curious, Ghost cocks his head, evaluating Tony's unusual behavior. Then he shrugs. "No, huh? You really didn't like it when I phased my hand through your heart last year, did you?" he asks, and Steve thinks maybe that got left out of Tony's mission report. Dear God. Ghost pauses. His head tips up. Steve thinks he's probably smiling. "Must be my lucky day."
Steve finds he can't look away from Tony's lips. He thinks maybe now he doesn't have to. "Would you-- would you mind if I kissed you?"
There was scattered applause; Tiberius basked in it for a few seconds, grinning a dazzlingly-white grin, and then held up his hand for silence.
. He didn't know if that was the right word. Maybe there weren't words for it. They'd tangled themselves up together, and God knew it hadn't always been good, but he couldn't have gotten free of Tony even if he'd wanted to. And he'd never wanted to. Tony had always been there.
"Well," Jan said, finally. "I think this calls for the big guns. Do you want to do it, or should I?"
," Tiberius murmured, and hearing his own name on Tiberius' lips made Steve's skin crawl. "I think you'll find that Tony doesn't share it." He didn't move, but his gaze slid to meet Steve's, piercing him where he sat. "Because, speaking of things we both know, we both know which of us he's going to believe, don't we?"
"Besides," Tony added. "You did say you liked my hands. So I thought you might like the opportunity to appreciate them."
Oh, geez. Yeah, Tony could see how a nude revue wouldn't have been Steve's kind of thing at all. But the thing was, it wasn't really Tony's kind of thing either, although certainly it was the sort of thing someone with his reputation would have been expected to enjoy. The mask and the man beneath weren't the same at all.
It's all right. Iron Man always has things to do. Heck, sometimes he doesn't even make team meetings. Steve's not going to pry.
"Of course I did," Tony said. "I mean, that's just obvious." And now Steve had definitely stumped him; he couldn't figure out why Steve was happy about that. "I-- what-- how does that even mean--?"
"Ah-ah!" Tony says, jerking his hand away, and Steve goes hot, shame and lust twined together. "That's not what I have for you. You know what I have for you."
When Tony passes him the packet, Steve blinks and stares at it like he doesn't quite know what to do with this mysterious thing, even though he was the one who asked for it. Steve's not really thinking straight. He's distracted. Tony doesn't blame him.
Steve knew it was ridiculous, laughably pathetic, but that didn't stop him from thinking it. Of course it wasn't fair. The world wasn't fair. He didn't get everything he wanted just because he wanted it. He knew that. He wasn't entitled to Tony's affections. The world didn't owe him Tony Stark.
Steve scrubbed at his face with his hand, with the vague notion that he should at least try to keep himself as composed as he could until he was in his bedroom. Head down, eyes half-shut, he crossed the room to the main staircase. He started to climb the stairs.
"Now you have a great deal to think about, hmm?" Mordo's voice sounded like he was a very long way away. "I believe it is time for me to make my exit, Avengers. Farewell. Or perhaps... fare poorly."
"That was only the beginning," Tony continued, and, wow, that was a terrible sentence. "After that he started pulling from my memories. Making me relive a lot of the worst things that had ever happened to me. He took me back to when my parents died, and he made me
Steve tips his head to the side and nudges the pauldron of Iron Man's armor with his cheekbone. "Yeah, see, that's exactly what I'm offering. If-- if you want that."
It doesn't seem soon to him. He used to know plenty of fellas who'd proposed pretty damn fast, right before they'd shipped out, to have someone to come home to, and none of them ever seemed to have any complaints. Hell, Bucky'd always nagged him about how he'd never gotten down on one knee for Betsy. Steve supposes he'd just been waiting for the right person to come along.
"Yeah." Steve nods. "He told me about the armor." He pauses. "I don't think he wanted to, honestly, but I'm really glad he did."
Shark-like, Mordo smiled, and, yeah, he was going for it. "Naturally you are unfamiliar with the guiding principles of certain schools of black magic. Practitioners require a certain amount of... turmoil. Distress. Negative emotions. Pain." His mouth twisted, a dissatisfied moue. "At certain times of the year, it is difficult to access a sufficient quantity of disorder without... mmm... producing one's own. I've decided to be proactive."
Steve jogged down the sidewalk to the main entrance. The door was unlocked, and the lobby was empty except for two men behind the security desk. One man looked like a garden-variety security guard, but the fella sitting next to him was a fairly large man in an expensive-looking suit and-- oh.
He'd seen the people Tony dated. A hell of a lot of them had been rich. And they hadn't all been nightmares like Tiberius. Rumiko had been good for Tony, he'd thought. And he liked Jan, of course. Everybody liked Jan.
"Yeah," Steve said. "Much better." He smiled back. "Tiberius makes you that happy, huh? How's he doing?"
Steve swallows hard. His eyes fall shut in misery. He doesn't want to watch this. There's nothing he can do. There's nothing anyone can do. He should have told Jan the truth. And maybe that would have meant neither he nor Tony could look her in the eye again, but she could have pulled someone from the reserves. It's not like the active team are the only Avengers in the world. It would have been embarrassing, but no one would have died. People are probably going to die once Ghost gets those plans.
. But he could do it, practically speaking. In every other respect, he couldn't. He pictured Tony holding him tight, Tony's body wrapped around his, the paradox of having Tony exactly where he wanted and never close enough at the very same time.
But he was wrong. He was wrong, because Tony hadn't. He hadn't lost at all. This was the last gasp of Tiberius' final argument, and it wasn't going to work.
Tony was pushing Tiberius off of him, was flushing red and doing up his fly in a hurry. He didn't take his eyes off Steve. Steve tried not to look at Tony's hands, or -- oh God -- Tony's lacy red underwear, but that just meant he was staring at the strip of skin revealed by Tony's rucked-up shirt, at the trail of little bruises on Tony's neck, at Tony's kiss-darkened lips. Steve didn't know where it was safe to look. Maybe nowhere.
was drunk. I was definitely very drunk. But I'm not sure he was. I don't think he'd drunk anywhere near as much as I had. Or as much as I thought he had."
"Okay. I get that. But," he added, "I think there are other people who would be good to you, too, you know. There are a lot of people who care about you and want to help you. You're not alone." God, now he just sounded like he wanted to get rid of Tony. "I don't mean-- I really am glad you're here, though."
Steve doesn't look around to watch the drive tumble through the air. He knows it's going to smash onto the sidewalk, far below. Ghost will never get those plans now.
"I don't want it to be true either," Steve said, as gently as he could. "But you have to admit that it looks like a real possibility. If he were anyone else, if he had any other relationship to you, you'd be suspecting him already. You know you'd be."
Next to Steve, Tony was wide-eyed, curious, drinking it all in. Steve decided not to interrupt him. They could talk after it was over.
Iron Man's hum is a low, almost sad sound. "He won't," Iron Man says, and Steve wonders how Iron Man can say that with such confidence. "Mr. Stark's not going to bother you again, okay? I'll make sure you never have to see him." There's an odd sort of bitterness in his voice, and Steve wonders why. Iron Man pauses. "I'll wake you up before morning, if it would make you feel better?"
Steve reminded himself that he could touch Tony now. His touch was welcome. He didn't want to let go of Tony's hand, but with his free hand he reached up and brushed Tony's cheekbone, feeling the heat blossom in his skin.
about Tiberius. Not aloud. Tony hadn't either, and Steve hadn't been about to take the initiative. Steve had thought Tony didn't want to hear it, didn't want to apply it to any relationship he had ever been in, maybe didn't even think he could be a victim of abuse. But it looked like Tony had no problems using it to describe a
"He's a worrywart," Steve told Carol, as she flew over the four-foot drop where the Quinjet ramp had once been able to extend. "I'm fine."
It took an obscene amount of alcohol to get Steve properly drunk, a good solid can't-feel-my-face level of inebriation, and if not for the fact that the mansion was currently dry for Tony and Carol's sake, he'd actually have considered shutting himself in his room with high-proof liquor and attempting it. It wasn't like Tony was going to be around to be hurt by it. But they'd all agreed not to drink at home, and going out to a bar would also have meant actually talking to people. That was a no. Just being alone would have to be enough.
It shouldn't have been anything to worry about; after all, Tony had been the victim of kidnapping attempts since approximately age fifteen, and after becoming Iron Man, it had all basically become an exercise in futility for the kidnappers. Sure, maybe it took him an hour or two to work loose from whatever Midas or the Controller or the Mandarin had him tied up in, but after that he was, more or less, home free.
Tony couldn't even trust this, Steve thought, sickened. Steve had wanted to do something to please Tony, and Tony had already been trained to look for the hidden catch.
Steve clears his throat. "I, um," he says, suddenly and surprisingly reticent. "I thought maybe a back massage."
He hasn't fallen, because Ghost is sitting on his chest, on the other side of the window, pinning him to the floor so he can't tip out. He's not exactly sure how they haven't fallen through the floor, but Ghost has clearly worked out all the possible problems with this technology.
"Or you could vote for people who represent your beliefs. There's still a socialist party, you know," Steve says, cheerfully. "A lot of 'em, actually. I bet you're not even registered to vote." He clicks his tongue. "People these days, honestly."
owe you breakfast. Lunch. Whatever meal this is. Several meals. Dinner. Might even call them dates." Tony said this a little too casually as well. Neither of them had used words like that, last night. They hadn't really talked about their future together, even though it had been clear they'd both been planning one. Tony lay back down and nestled up against Steve once more. "Or we could stay in bed a little longer."
The next thing Steve was aware of was pain. Everything was still dark. His head was throbbing, and something felt very wrong with one of his legs and one of his arms. It was hard to think. He was draped uncomfortably over a surface that he was certain he wasn't supposed to be lying on. Was it night already?
Then Tony's twisting under him, rolling Steve off him, a move Steve's pretty sure he taught Tony on the practice mats a few years back. Tony's eyes are bright, his smile irrepressible. He flips Steve onto his back and crowds up against him, halfway atop him. Tony's shoulder bumps Steve's jaw and Steve gets a face full of warm, slippery muscle and the scent of lavender and metal.
Steve still can't actually move without pain, but if he only has to shift over an inch or two to stop making contact, he can do that. He's got to.
Tony takes a breath. "It's Wednesday, December 5," he says. Another breath. "The year is 2012." Another breath. "And you have a severe case of amnesia."
All the apartments he'd rented for himself over the years had kicked him out when he'd fallen off the wagon, but when he'd gotten out of St. Vincent's he'd found himself another place before heading to California, just in case he needed it. Penthouse apartment, swanky views, all the usual amenities. And it seemed like he needed it these days, now that he unexpectedly no longer had the mansion. It was lonely without the Avengers around here, though. He'd never really liked to live alone. But it was what it was.
simple. He loves Iron Man. Iron Man loves him. He can't imagine wanting to be with anyone else in his entire life. And now he just has to find out if Iron Man feels the same way. That's all.
Steve still couldn't think of a single thing to say, but he supposed there was no getting away now. He stepped inside, and that was when Tony actually saw all of him. Including the splint.
Steve steps back. He tugs his mail shirt down, just to give himself something to do with his hands that's not
He can hear the hope in Mr. Stark's voice, even as Mr. Stark starts to stutter in what sounds a lot like actual fear. And then Steve realizes why Mr. Stark might be nervous.
It made sense. Tony had been gaslit so much, hurt so much, that it was hard for him to trust Steve right now. Of course it was going to be difficult for him to see what Steve saw in him. Maybe it always would be.
, but Steve knew. Of course he knew. He was clearly it for Tony, the way Tony was it for him. Somehow Steve couldn't quite believe that this moment had been ten years coming, because they'd always, always been gone for each other. Right from the start.
"Tony didn't tell you?" Stephen asks. "I can cure you with magic. Fix the amnesia. Give you everything back."
"Nope," Steve said, as cheerfully as he could. "The gay porn DVDs are in a box under the bed. You're welcome to borrow them if you want. I definitely keep them around for their artistic value."
"You could. Um." Steve's throat is desert-dry. "You could get a little more comfortable, if you wanted. I wouldn't mind."
It wasn't like Steve's love of classic musical theater had ever been all that subtle, and it had probably been way back in the Kooky Quartet days that Steve had actually been introduced to the film version of
Tony went pleasantly tingly all over, from head to toe and including several important parts in between. It was nice to get to pay attention to his body for reasons that weren't him needing to catalog the symptoms of an impending heart attack.
And he wouldn't have said anything about it, ordinarily, but it was past four in the morning, which seemed like the kind of time for this conversation, and also it was Tony. If anyone was going to be able to see past the flag and the uniform, it was Tony.
Steve waited five seconds, then ten, making sure there was no one else in earshot. Then he took his lapel mic off and muted himself on the Avengers comm line.
"Don't stop," Iron Man says, instantly. There's something low and content in his voice, a note Steve has never heard before. "Please don't stop. You're amazing."
All of Steve's worries dissipated when he glanced down and realized that Tony was very obviously hard. The shape of his cock, pleasantly on the large side, was outlined against the soft fabric of his pants. They were Steve's sleep pants, actually, he realized, and something about that knowledge, the idea that Tony was getting off while wearing Steve's own clothing -- it was like he was touching Tony all over, in the most intimate of ways, a thought that undid him with its sheer eroticism.
Yeah, that was the name, all right. Steve squints right back, because isn't the answer obvious? "Don't you get messages about it too? I get messages about it all the time! From strangers! They want me to buy it. And they want to sell me things to, uh, make me bigger. And none of them can spell."
. Steve couldn't think of a time he'd ever seen Tony overreact to anything, and he trusted Tony's judgment every day on a professional level.
Steve could feel rage beginning to spark within him, burning hot. Had Tiberius done this to him? Had Tiberius
He still has no idea what the problem was, but at least Iron Man is nodding now. There's a flash of a smile through the mouth-slit. "Yes," Iron Man says. "I-- I don't think I can ever say no to you, really." He sounds oddly contemplative.
He heads in the direction of the row of elevators. Five seconds later, he realizes Tony isn't following him. He turns back. Tony's just standing there staring.
"There you go," Steve says, softly. His fingers linger on the armor an instant longer than they perhaps should have. "One Captain America, all yours."
Nodding slowly, thoughtfully, Tony looked a little less sickened as he took in Steve's words. But only a little.
Another car honked in the background. "I'm pretty sure I've never told you this, but both of Ty's parents are also dead. They died a few months after my parents died." Grief thickened Tony's voice. "It was also a car accident, actually. Life's just full of coincidences, I suppose." His breath was shaky now. "I'd always thought it was an accident, just like my parents' accident. That was how the coroner ruled it. But Donahue-- he seemed pretty damn sure that it was a suicide. He told me that Ty's father had killed himself -- himself and his wife -- because my father had destroyed his business. But, y'know, when you flip your car over a guard rail and off a cliff at ninety miles an hour on a rainy night, who even knows, right? It could have been suicide. I know you never met my father, but trust me when I say that it's pretty believable that he could have driven someone to suicide." The words were bitter.
He lifts one gauntleted hand, makes a fist, knocks it against the side of his helmet. Metal resounds, and Iron Man shakes his head and starts to lower his arm.
Tony doesn't say anything right away. He just leans in and kisses Steve, gently. There's still blood on his face. Steve can't say as he's ever pictured this moment happening like this, but he's not about to complain.
"You're smart," Steve began, and Tony started at that, like he hadn't expected, of all things, a compliment. "You're the smartest man I've ever met. For my money, you're the smartest man in the world."
Steve bit his lip again, as if he was about to say something he hated to own up to, and, yeah, here it came.
," Steve said, startled into obscenity, and he just barely stopped himself from thrusting all the way into Tony's perfect mouth. His hips quivered and he shuddered. Tony was setting the pace. Tony got to pick. Tony could do whatever he wanted and Steve would say yes. "Yeah, just like that," Steve groaned. "Yeah, right there, that's the spot."
He supposes that if you're dating a fella who lives his life in armor, you can't exactly expect any of it to be normal. It doesn't bother Steve, anyhow. It isn't like a lot of things about him are normal either.
Steve stared. He hadn't expected that. Maybe he should have. Tony had had that synthetic heart put in, a long time ago, but Steve had thought that he'd been better when they'd all gotten back to Earth, after Onslaught. He thought that Tony had been healed. All the scars had definitely disappeared, then. So what in the world had happened?
is a thought, all right. Steve is immaculate, shining, alien, fascinating, and then he pulls back to thrust into Tony again and Tony catches a glimpse of bare skin in the open vee of Steve's pants: angular hipbone; tensed, trembling muscles; golden, dewy skin; a light trail of golden hair down to where their bodies are joined. And all at once, Steve is perfectly, messily human again, just a man who wants him. Tony can't hold it all in his head. He's not going to try.
Wanda stuck her head in, and Pietro wasn't far behind her. She was breathing heavily, like she'd been running. Pietro, of course, looked like he hadn't been. But he probably had.
Oh, geez. If Tony was refusing coffee, it had to be bad. It was a ridiculous thought, because it had been quite clear already just how badly off he was right now. But somehow this, this thing that was comparatively so small, just underscored it. An aching sympathy welled up in Steve.
Tony just kept staring at Steve. He looked like he couldn't believe that Steve would be willing to do any of this for him.
It's very convenient of Tony to set out his limits here; Steve has a history of not finding Tony's limits in other contexts until they've both tripped over the line. Tony hasn't talked about his past experience much, but it's clear that he's done more kink with Steve than he has with anyone else he's been with. Oh, he's definitely been eager, with Steve; Steve suspects most of Tony's past partners just haven't indulged him, or he never told them. So there have been several safewords called, this past year, because Tony doesn't always know his own limits. But Tony's clearly done this enough that he knows where he stands. And that's nice to hear.
It'll work, if he bites Tony. Tony doesn't have the serum. His body can't fight it off. He'll be a vampire for sure. No second chances. He's not like Steve.
"I'm sorry," Steve says, dejected, ashamed. "I know it's-- it's probably too soon to ask about something like that. I just figured we'd been together this long, and, well, I thought we should... find out if our goals align."
Tony glanced around the basement, his view of the chaos now unimpaired by his helmet. It was a hot day, and it wasn't like everyone here didn't already know who he was.
He has the feeling that Iron Man likes him. He sure likes Iron Man a lot, anyway, and it seems like it might be mutual. They work together amazingly well on the field, and Iron Man spends a heck of a lot of time around him even when they're not fighting supervillains, so much so that Steve wonders if Mr. Stark is really safe without his bodyguard. Iron Man's smart, too. Maybe not as smart as they all say Mr. Stark is -- Steve wouldn't really know -- but almost any time he's had a question about the future, Iron Man's been happy to explain it, however long it takes. He cracks jokes, terrible jokes, like he just wants to make Steve smile, and when Steve's around him sometimes he feels like Iron Man's presence is the one thing that makes being in this century all worth it.
There's a humming noise over where Iron Man is standing, and then popping noises. Iron Man is... making popcorn in a microwave oven? Steve didn't know Mr. Stark had one. There's already one in the kitchen upstairs. Steve's not sure whether having one's own microwave is extravagant or commonplace; he hasn't the faintest idea how much they cost. He suspects that, whatever the amount is, Mr. Stark can afford it.
Steve's stomach was in knots. Had he made a mistake? He jerked his hand away from Tony, where he'd still been resting his hand on the back of Tony's neck.
"Not really," Tony said. "Plus, Ty doesn't have any involvement in the news programming. He doesn't tell his people what to report. He stays out of the process. That's what he told me."
Time to pack the box back up. Then he could attempt to get some sleep and not think about any of this ever again.
"Of course I know him!" Steve retorts. "I know everything I need to know about him. And I care about him."
They let each other go, but as Tony drew back, he kept his hands on Stone's shoulders, staring at him for long seconds. Then he blinked and shook himself, glancing around like he was waking up, like he hadn't quite realized there were still other people in the room.
Steve's whole body was curled protectively over Tony, his head bent, and hot tears dripped down onto Tony's face.
," Tony said, his voice breaking in anger, in pain, a terrible rasp of self-hatred. "And I trust you, I do, but I trusted him too. But he was hurting me. He'd been hurting me for years and I didn't even realize it. So what if I'm wrong now? How would I know? How the hell would I know?" Oh, God. Of course Tony couldn't trust his own judgment, could he? Tony gave an awful sob. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that, I'm sorry, I didn't--"
Tony turned his head back to look at him; there was real fear in his eyes now. "Brace yourself! Impact in three, two--"
Steve found himself smiling. "Now if you could do something to help the part where I have to type up all my reports one-handed, that'd
The sudden light was blinding, and his vision smeared into an aching blur of tears, brightness, and something bluish that was probably Steve's cowl. He blinked and squinted.
Tony's starting to smile. "Oh?" he asks, his mouth rounding to shape the sound, curving upward at the corners. That's a good sign. He raises a quizzical eyebrow. "What were you thinking about?"
have a secret identity. It doesn't bother me that you do too. And whoever you are under the mask, whatever name you answer to that isn't
Iron Man will say yes, won't he? Sure, he could think it's too soon -- Mr. Stark had certainly thought it was -- but Iron Man knows him better than Mr. Stark does, and Steve hopes that means Iron Man will understand if he's asking sooner than folks these days do. Surely Iron Man will understand that it's a sign of Steve's love. He'll understand how much Steve loves him. Steve just wants to do right by him. He just wants to make them both happy.
Steve nodded, tossed the gag in the box, set the box on the floor next to the bed, and stepped back. He was done vetoing toys for the night, apparently. Tony considered what was left on his bed: the crop that had started it all, the two floggers, the cuffs and chains, that delectable harness, and of course the Iron Man plug.
"No, of course you couldn't have known," Tony said, soothing, placating. "I understand. I wasn't thinking. I'm so, so sorry. I overreacted." He half-smiled, a rueful expression. "Yeah, I know, bad habit. You know me."
Oh, God. Steve didn't know what Tiberius had shown him in DreamVision, but it must have been awful. He knew Tony's nightmares were bad enough on their own. He certainly didn't need any additional help.
"I wish it had been that simple." There was an awful, hollow despair in Tony's eyes. "There's-- there's something
"I know that," Steve said. Something had gone tight in his chest. "I know it's not-- it's--" But he found he couldn't exactly say what it was. "I don't know. I don't know what it is. I'm sorry."
Steve wants to ask. Iron Man's words sound so much like what Mr. Stark told him this morning that Steve wonders if Mr. Stark told him about their conversation. But it was a private conversation, and he can't imagine why Mr. Stark would have repeated it, because the only thing it would have accomplished would have been to insult Iron Man with Mr. Stark's apparently very low opinion of him.
Tony was rubbing at his chest again, his hand splayed under where that strange metal port was. He was-- he was
And maybe that was too much, because Iron Man does step back at that, and Steve can see him blinking in wonder. "And you're too kind," he says, finally, like he's discarded several possible responses before settling on that one.
It was early evening now; the team had finished sorting as much of the second floor as they were going to be able to do, probably, and then they'd all gone their separate ways. Tony didn't know where anyone else was staying; he knew the team had rented temporary HQ space from the Fantastic Four, but he didn't know if that covered room and board. Steve had hightailed it out of there before Tony could ask him over for dinner, otherwise he would have.
"I absolutely meant it." Mr. Stark's voice is gentle but fierce. He could practically give the Avengers lessons in how to comfort scared civilians. Steve's starting to feel like he personally could use some comfort. "So what's the matter, Captain? What's wrong?" He frowns. "Don't tell me that you and Iron Man are fighting. That would be terrible. I have a lot invested in the two of you."
"Here's the plan," Steve said. "Iron Man, you're with me; we'll confront Mordo directly on the eighth floor. Thor and Tigra, I want you two to split up and cover the likeliest exits, in case he tries to make a run for it. Tigra, seventh floor. Thor, ninth floor."
"I can't," Tony breathed. His eyes were hot again. He was letting Captain America down. Hell of a way to die. He supposed he was always a disappointment. "I can't, I can't, I'm so sorry--"
Steve knows that people usually think of Captain America as sexless, and he's fine with that. Captain America is a symbol. An ideal. Unsullied by messy human desire. Chaste. Pure. But, underneath the cowl, Steve Rogers is only a man, and he's far from innocent. He wants Iron Man. He
Tony's head snapped up, jaw gone slack, shock followed by the tiniest embers of hope coming to life in his eyes, and the fact that Tony plainly didn't expect anyone, even Steve, to be
Tony tipped his head up, wordlessly asking for a kiss, and Steve leaned in and kissed him, lightly. Tony hummed in pleasure. "Have I told you recently that I love you?"
"He knows I'm Iron Man now, by the way." Tony's voice was very carefully devoid of emotion. "I didn't tell him. It turns out there's a fair amount of telepathy, of a sort, involved in DreamVision." His words were halting. "And it's not exactly... consensual."
Maybe Steve was just seeing things. Tiberius was Tony's friend, after all. If there were something wrong with him, surely Tony would have noticed. It had to be okay.
The sound Mr. Stark makes now isn't a laugh; in fact, it sounds more like a groan. Of actual, physical pain.
And now Steve is actually, truly touched, because on top of everything, Iron Man remembered that Steve used to be an artist. Steve likes art. Iron Man thought about exactly what he might like to do and picked something just for him.
All he had to do was... not think about Tony. It seemed so simple, when Steve framed it like that. A test of willpower. A test of his determination. Steve knew he had enough stubbornness for several people. He just needed to be stubborn about this, too.
. His face was an ugly red, his brow furrowed, and he was trembling now in pure rage rather than feigned sorrow.
It's their anniversary. All Steve wanted was to make Tony happy tonight. This is what he gets instead. Despair runs through him. But he stands tall and hefts the shield again, because he's the only one who can do this. Steve looks over at Tony. He wishes he could comfort Tony. But he can't. Not like this. His eyes meet the eye-slits of Tony's mask, and he desperately wills Tony to understand, to know that he's with him. He's here.
And what with the way Tony's life usually went, Steve was definitely going to need that information at some point.
He wanted to hold Tony, but Tony didn't seem inclined to move from where he was sprawled on Steve's bed, and right now Steve didn't trust himself enough to know why he wanted to hold Tony, and he couldn't figure out if holding Tony while they were both in his bed was something that he would have done before or something he absolutely wouldn't have. He was tired too. Not as tired as Tony, though.
He had to say something. "It's not you, Tony. I swear it's not. It's them. You've done nothing wrong."
," Steve gasped. Oh, yeah, Tony had it. "That right there. So good. Just like that, Tony, that'll do me just fine, just keep doing that. And you could, if you wanted--?"
Tony's shadowed shape disappeared into the bedroom, and Steve flopped over on the couch and flung one arm over his eyes.
Steve slammed the mute button and turned back to see Tony scraping his hands over his face in misery.
The allegations were false, anyway. Steve knew that. And even if he hadn't known it for sure, it was quite a leap from
Tony grimaced. "I mean, yeah," he said, pained, "I'm not going to pretend that I have no idea why you'd worry about that, but he-- you-- you're nothing alike. Believe me."
There's a burst of static as Tony clears his throat. Sniffs. Tries to compose himself. "I don't need to call anyone," Tony says, slowly, brokenly, a terrible confession. "That won't be necessary. The plans are-- they're-- they're on a networked account. Private. But I happen to know the password."
Steve hadn't heard of Tiberius Stone until that morning at breakfast. Maybe that ought to have been a warning sign.
He finds the shears exactly where he thought they'd be. Tony tenses a little when Steve slides them against his skin, under the edge of one of the ropes of the harness.
Tony pressed his face against Steve's palm and kissed Steve's fingers before Steve's hand dropped away. Did Steve not really want--
Tony laughed and then wished he hadn't. His gut spasmed in agony and he bit back a scream. More tears trickled down his face. He was a mess. This wasn't exactly the way he'd ever dreamed Steve would find out the truth.
That was Tony. He still cared. Of course he did. And Tony was still smiling that ever-present smile as he got up, but there was a shadow darkening it now. A shadow Tiberius had put there.
If Tony watched this, Tony probably wasn't ever going to speak to him again. This went well beyond the ordinary problem of disliking a friend's boyfriend. But if there was anything Steve could do to stop Tony from being hurt again, he had to try.
Was he serious? Steve studied Tony's face. He looked... nervous. Like he actually wasn't sure if Steve had liked it. Was there something Steve had been meant to do differently? Had he somehow not been
At Tony's urging, he repeats the process on Tony's other arm, and then moves to Tony's leg, where the same thing happens with the boots. The soles of the boots are thick, separate pieces, but the boots themselves detach from them and retract into the cuffs, and then the same thing happens with the metal covering Tony's legs. Steve hadn't quite realized until this moment that Tony has
The relief in Tiberius' eyes was unmistakable. It lasted for a fraction of a second, and then it was gone. But they both knew. Tiberius knew exactly what Steve had just done.
Iron Man makes him so very happy. Being with him is just so... easy. Steve knows that wouldn't be a lot of people's first thought when it comes to dating a fella in a metal suit, but it's not about that. Iron Man makes him laugh. Iron Man makes him smile. Iron Man is the best partner he's ever had; on the battlefield, they move like they're two halves of one person. Iron Man always knows where he is, and he's there to catch Steve if he falls -- and that's not even metaphorical.
"I thought what I was doing was pretty clear, actually." Steve kept his voice as level as he could, and he rose to his feet.
"We talked about trust, before," Steve said, finally. "I trust you. Without question. I'm positive that my trust in you isn't misplaced. And I'm positive that you trust me. And you know I don't lie to you. I'm not lying when I say that I want you more than anyone else in the world. I'm not naive, and I'm not blind. I know there are other people in the world. But I don't want them, not like I want you. I want it to be you. I love you. I just want to make you happy. I'm not going to regret it. I promise."
Because Steve knew a secret. He knew that Tony and Tiberius were lovers. And if he opened his mouth, he could ruin Tiberius' entire life. In an instant.
Steve gave him another heartbreaking smile and pressed a damp kiss into Tony's palm. "I'd love it. You-- this-- this is everything I've ever wanted, all at once."
He used to tell himself that, before the serum, every time he struggled to his feet in the middle of a fight. Or, more likely, right after one.
The scent of lavender wafts through the room as Steve opens the oil. He carefully pours some out into his palm, caps the bottle, and rubs his hands together, hoping it will smooth over the worst of the calluses. He doesn't want this to be bad for Tony. He doesn't think it'll be bad -- no one's ever said he was bad -- but, well, he's never done this for Tony before, and, selfishly, he'd like Tony to keep being impressed.
"I know it's not everything," Tony said, a little apologetically. "Not yet. But... maybe it's more than just good enough?"
Mr. Stark's gaze falters, and he blinks up at Steve several times, confused, like the chips are down and he'd never in a million years expected Steve to want to call his bluff.
But Carol rallied and hit back, a flurry of blows. Blocking took a lot out of him, especially at Carol's power level -- all his muscle memory was telling him to block with the shield he wasn't carrying. At least he was getting in the unarmed practice.
"Not at all." Steve licks his lips and tries again. "I just meant that, because you're the one who designs his armor, you must know a lot about how the armor fits him. You know his measurements."
Tony's gaze sought out Steve again, as if he were searching for Steve's approval, as if he didn't know he'd always had it.
"It's me," Steve murmured, and his eyes were stinging too. "It's real. I'm really here. I swear to God." Tony the atheist probably wasn't going to find that much of a comfort. "I swear on my shield. I've got you, Tony. I've got you. You're all right."
And maybe this isn't the reaction Steve ought to have to that, but he's glad to hear it. Tony's right here. Steve's in Tony's bed, because Tony wants him there, and Tony kissed him, and Tony's happy to still be with him. Tony wants another year. Tony loves him. The raw, twisted, guilty wound within Steve starts to lessen. The burden weighing him down starts to lighten. Tony really doesn't blame him for everything that happened with Ghost. Tony's not at all upset with him for believing that Tony didn't have it together. Tony's forgiven him, and doesn't that mean he should forgive himself too?
If Tony had an explanation he was comfortable with, Steve was more than happy to let him explain it all to Jan.
There's a noise behind him. The covers are rustling again. The bed creaks. That would be Steve, sitting up. He hears Steve take one hoarse breath, then another.
Steve was out of his depth here. He didn't know how to deal with anyone who was like this. The kind of villains Steve fought on a regular basis were the kind of villains who were explicit and open about their love for fascism, and all he had to do was punch them. It was clear-cut. It was black and white. There was no subtlety. There were no mind games. That was who Steve had learned how to fight. And he was good at it. But Tiberius was so clever and so quick that he had Tony, the smartest man Steve had ever met, believing his every word. Steve didn't think he'd ever met anyone who could manipulate the truth this much. He didn't know where to go from here.
"Shh," Tony said, stepping back and admiring Steve's bruised, reddened mouth. "I get to decide what you get, don't I? You'll get more."
"Not as far as I know," Tony had to admit, and the light in Steve's eyes dimmed just a little. "Not recently, anyway. But he's-- he's looking into getting help for Hank. The best doctors. He told me he talked to Don Blake a few days back, and Don said he thought Hank had a good chance of getting better, with the right treatment. Mr. Stark says he'll pay for the doctors, of course. Nothing but the best for the Avengers, right?" He couldn't help but smile, even though Steve couldn't see it. "And he said he was going to offer him a job at Stark International, when he's ready to get back on his feet." Tony shrugged -- or tried to. It was always difficult in armor. "I mean, who knows if Hank will take it, but I know if he can find him Mr. Stark is at least prepared to make the offer."
Steve turned to face him. His fingertips skimmed Tony's jaw. "I didn't come here for the fella from the headlines, Tony," Steve said, softly.
"Oh, Tony," Steve breathes. "You're so good. Beautiful. So good for me. No one's as good as you, you know that? No one."
Steve didn't even feel bad about his unexpected clumsiness, both because Tony was laughing joyously, smiling down at him, and because the motion had caused Tony to reposition his weight in a way that Steve liked a hell of a lot. Tony was solid; he probably weighed twice as much as anyone Steve had ever taken to bed. It was an interesting feeling, not being so much bigger than the person he was with. It was new. He found he liked it.
Maybe he was insecure. Maybe that was it. Steve considered himself a reasonably smart guy -- but there was
"There we go," Tony said, his voice rich with satisfaction, as Steve melted into his touch. "You like that, huh? Me too." Of course Tony did. Tony liked getting to touch people.
"I know." Steve's heart ached in sympathy. "I know. But it's going to get better. I promise. It is. You've got me."
with you tonight, Rust Bucket?" Ghost snorts in derision. "It's temporary paralysis. Absolutely reversible. You can have him back, unharmed, if you just do one thing for me."
He'd never thought it would really happen, of course. Which was how he'd ended up here, with zero experience with men and with Tony in his bed.
Rationally, he knew he was being ridiculous. It wasn't like there weren't people who knew his secret identity, after all, and mostly they were still his friends. Happy knew. Pepper knew. Marianne, of course, had read it in his mind. Beth had figured it out. Whitney knew too, but that was one of those things he tried to avoid thinking about. Hell, even Thor knew, and Thor had been fine with it -- and Tony knew who Thor was, too. And for the most part, everyone had taken it well, although Tony knew Pepper wasn't a fan of the whole superhero thing. But that obviously wouldn't be an issue with Steve.
Fabric tangled in front of his eyes, and for a few seconds he couldn't see anything; the bed creaked as Tony sat up next to him, getting enough clearance to pull the whole undershirt over Steve's head and off entirely.
It was tempting, but-- Tony shook his head. "Still no. Not without a condom." His last test had come back clean, but he couldn't guarantee Steve six months of monogamy, and they were in a shared profession that did involve being routinely covered in other people's blood. And even if they'd had condoms... well, obviously they couldn't have used the Vaseline anyway.
That's not the case for Tony. Tony's sex life is, unfortunately, perpetual gossip fodder. People ask him.
"I don't honestly know everything that's in it anymore," he admitted, with a laugh. He definitely had not prepared this answer. "And even if I did know, I don't think Tony would want me to say so on national television. I have a feeling that some of the materials are proprietary." He took another breath and stared the camera down. "Every time I face off against a villain, every time someone raises a gun or aims a laser rifle or breathes acidic dragon breath, or whatever it is today, I'm trusting Tony to keep me alive. Sure, he keeps Iron Man armored. We all know that. But he keeps me armored, too." He could have brought up the shield that Tony had made him, once, but he knew better than to invite discussion about the Armor Wars. "So, yes. He may not fight with us."
He'd tried so hard, but in the end, it was like the drinking, wasn't it? He could help Tony, but Tony had to want to be helped. And Tony had saved himself just in time, back then. He'd beaten the odds. He'd survived. But no more miracles were coming.
He might have been able to control his voice, but he can't control the rest of his reaction; heat starts to gather, low in his belly, and he knows he's at least half-hard from just this one touch. It was an understandable reaction when Iron Man kissed him -- and it was certainly understandable that Iron Man could politely ignore it -- but just
Over the years, the Avengers have evolved the concept of shift work -- Steve's pulled more nights on monitor duty than even he can count -- and they've definitely figured out how to be on-call, but the one thing they've never really developed is being off-duty. If that alert sounds, they go. No matter what they're doing, no matter where they are, no matter if they're seven hours into a night shift and haven't slept for the past twenty-four hours -- they go. It's the nature of the job. It's never someone else's problem. Steve doesn't resent that. He can't.
Steve's gaze darted to the door leading to the master bathroom. "Do you want me to, uh, change elsewhere? Getting out of this getup isn't very... dignified."
It was just the four of them all gathered in the briefing room -- him, Steve, Thor, and Tigra. It was quite possibly the smallest team Tony had been on since they'd founded the Avengers. Smaller, actually. Still, they'd been fine with five people then, and they'd been fine with four before they'd found Steve, and they were going to be fine with four now -- and these days, they had the reserves to draw on if they needed them. It was going to be all right.
He hated telling Tony no. And it was only one night. Maybe Tiberius Stone would be nice. Tony certainly seemed to like him a lot. Tony did generally have good taste in friends; Steve got along well enough with Happy and Pepper and Jim. And even if Tiberius turned out to be someone Steve couldn't warm up to, the worst Steve would have to do was make polite small talk for the span of an evening. He'd certainly done more difficult things in his life. It wasn't as if Tony was asking him to invade Normandy again.
"Because it's the truth," Steve said. He didn't know that there was another answer. "And because I know you. Because I love you, and I want you to be happy more than anything."
Steve unclenched his fists and inclined his head. He could be pleasant. He could do this. "I've never made any secret of my friendship with Tony Stark, ma'am," he said. His voice was tighter than he wanted it to be. "As I've said, he's one of the best men I've ever known. Since the day I woke up decades in the future, Tony has been immensely kind to me. Just as he is to everyone. He's done so much good in the world, and I'm honored to be his friend. And the same, actually, is true of my friendship with Iron Man."
They could just go on with their kinky sex life, enjoying their Iron Man butt plug, and they were never going to know that Tony knew about it. That was how it was going to be. It didn't matter how he felt about it; they should get to keep their fantasy life as private as possible. This was the closest he could get to making that happen for them. He had a secret identity. He was good at keeping his mouth shut.
"I'm not," Steve said. "I don't put any stock in those. You know that. I meant our friends. You've slept with a few people we both know." Tony stared at him like that had never occurred to him. "And I know you don't like to go to the kind of team parties where the liquor's flowing freely, but I've been to some of them. And you should know that a whole lot of Avengers are happy to kiss and tell, when they're tipsy enough. Especially about you. And I'm sure Natasha and Jan thought I wasn't paying attention. But I was."
And then there were the so-called Armor Wars. Steve scrolled through a news article that gleefully explained how Iron Man had attacked anyone using Stark technology, how he'd broken into the Vault to attack the Guardsmen, how he obviously couldn't be trusted. But only two people knew exactly what Tony had done that day at the Vault. Tony was one of them, and Steve himself was the other one. Steve was never going to forget the way Tony had sucker-punched him, temporarily paralyzed him, and then stared him down, nearly in tears behind the mask, like it had been killing him to do this. And Steve knew it had been. It had been killing both of them.
Tony takes a few wobbling steps forward and shuts the door behind himself. Concerned, Steve watches as Tony wobbles his way further into the room. If Tony falls, there's no way Steve can catch him, being as he's still strapped to the bed.
He had no idea what he was looking at. The room was some kind of cross between an office and a laboratory, with two narrow beds placed head-to-head, on a waist-height metal platform, with a messy pile of electronic equipment between them. Tony and Tiberius were lying on the beds, seemingly unconscious. Oddly, they were both in their underwear. When Steve had been trying to come up with reasons why Tony's clothing had been in a pile on the floor, this definitely hadn't occurred to him.
Reality felt simultaneously unreal and more real than anything that had happened to Steve in his entire life. Blood pounded through Steve's head, his mouth was dry, and he was distantly aware that he was achingly hard as he rolled to the side, slipped his hand inside the waistband of Tony's pajamas, and started to ease them down.
. Of course he did. He must have discovered it in the future as well, given that it too had premiered in the fifties; Tony just hadn't known he'd seen that one in particular. He wondered if there were any Steve hadn't seen yet. He could watch them with him. Steve was always great company. In any context, really.
Tony's mouth works like he wants to apologize but doesn't know where to begin. "I didn't want you to. I made sure you only got to know one of me." He half-smiles. "So you see, I wasn't jealous of Iron Man. Except I was, I suppose." He sighs. "Iron Man was the one you loved."
Steve reached up and idly ran two fingers over the lapel of Tony's shirt. "And do I get to see you out of this?"
They stay like this for a little longer, silently, and Steve lets Tony just soak it in. Then he figures out he doesn't have to push that far up, or adjust his weight all that much, to be able to get his hands back to Tony's shoulders.
The gesture Tony makes in response is probably meant to be a nod, but it's actually more like Tony nuzzling his palm again.
Steve lifted him higher, sliding him out of the backplate of his armor and into Steve's lap, and, oh, yes, that was good, that was really good. Tony smiled, and Steve leaned in close.
And then Iron Man puts out a hand, palm up, the repulsor glassy and dim. "You could," Iron Man begins, and he sounds as nervous as Steve feels, now. "You could touch, if you wanted."
Oh, God. Steve held Tony closer. The pain in Tony's voice was agonizing. His whole life later, and it hadn't stopped hurting.
Iron Man laughs like a radio between stations. "All right, all right. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Take me out, Cap. I'm all yours. Where are we going?"
Metal scraped and crunched. The armor made a terrible groaning noise, and then somehow Steve was balancing half a twisted chestplate in one hand. It had flexed up and bent backwards as Steve had literally peeled it off him at the shoulders. The golden mesh on Tony's arms sagged and depolarized.
"It's a little ironic," Tony continued, "that the thing that actually solved it, for me, was getting sober. I'd figured out I wanted to be alive. And then I figured out that there was really no point hating myself for all my deep dark fantasies. It was going to make me happy, and unlike the drinking it wasn't going to kill me while it made me happy, and it wasn't going to hurt anyone else if they starred in my fantasies. So I figured, why not treat myself right for a change? Give myself a little happiness." He was smiling again now, looking a little embarrassed. But just a little. "You've been... a pretty frequent star."
Steve took a deep breath and stepped out onto the stage, offering a smile to the closest camera, the one tracking his movement as he strode across the set. His chair was the closest one to him, on the opposite side of the little low table from where Walders was already sitting. There was a third chair in the middle, which Steve hadn't expected, but he supposed that after his appearance was over they must be bringing on a pair of guests to discuss the situation.
Carol stepped inside, her mouth half open; her jaw dropped more as she looked around the room. It looked like she'd come in preparing to say something in particular but had been derailed by seeing what Steve was up to. Seemed reasonable. Steve was betting that everyone who wasn't Tony hadn't been expecting this -- and it wasn't as if Tony had been expecting it, when Steve had told him.
Tony has already said yes. Steve just wants him to say yes again, because, well, this is another one of those new things. He'd like to be sure he has permission.
Steve takes a few stumbling steps forward, trying to follow Tony, and then his legs give out and he crashes to his knees. He crawls, just like Tony wanted. He realizes he's crying again.
"I know that." Tony's dark-eyed gaze searched his face, and Steve knew that expression: an engineer, looking for something he could fix. "But are you okay?" He gestured at himself with his free hand. "I mean. Christ.
"No, I want you to," Steve said. "Absolutely." He still looked a little wobbly, maybe still a bit uncertain, but Tony couldn't exactly offer him the bed to sit down on right now.
Tony leaned in and kissed him again. This kiss, too, was different from the rest. This kiss was deep, heavy, passionate. This was Tony just taking everything he wanted, everything Steve could give him. This was Tony daring to finally, finally have what he wanted, what he'd dreamed of, what had always been his.
Tony's location resolved again. He was a little further south than he'd been, but still in the park. Life signs were holding steady. Tony was okay. His heart rate was a little elevated.
"Don't mind me," Mr. Stark pants. "I'm just gonna -- oh God -- I'm just gonna sit here for a few minutes and chew an aspirin or two. I'll be fine." He bares his teeth. It's probably supposed to be a smile.
"Well," Steve said, his throat so tight that the words hurt to say. "For the record, I'd like to do all of
"Okay," Steve says, confused. Honestly, he's game for anything Iron Man wants to do with him. "I'll look forward to it."
"Captain," Pietro said. In five more seconds he was in front of Wanda, well inside the room, twenty feet forward in a blur of motion. He jerked his head at the darkened television.
Then they started to imply that Tony had started drinking again, and that was when Steve nearly punched the television. They'd found a photo of Tony at a Maria Stark Foundation gala last year, fundraising for the Avengers, holding a champagne flute. It was a champagne flute that Steve knew for a fact had been filled with non-alcoholic sparkling apple juice. He knew that because he, personally, had gone to the bartender, tipped a whole lot extra, watched him pour two glasses from a brand-new bottle of Martinelli's Sparkling Cider that Steve had watched him open in front of him and never take out of his sight, and then Steve had tasted one of them himself. Just to make sure. And then he'd taken it anyway, too, because what did it matter if he had real champagne or not? He didn't mind not drinking around Tony. He'd put the other glass into Tony's hands himself. A lot of people would have liked Tony to slip up, and Tony had known that he could always, always trust Steve.
. I'm glad that when you realized you loved men, it wasn't him. I'm glad that you had a love that made you feel brave and strong and-- and happy." He remembered how Tony has stood up to Tiberius last night. "A love that taught you that
"Him?" Tony snorts. "What do you think? He took a long vacation and decided to hire a bodyguard when he got home. Coincidentally, he met a very nice guy named Iron Man who happened to be looking for a job."
"Okay," Steve said, slowly, warily. "You're going to start with the part where he said he was sorry and he promised he wasn't ever going to do it again, right?" Steve hoped that was what Tiberius had started with. It was what Steve would have started with. He liked to think he wouldn't have done any of this in the first place, though.
Steve held Tony's gaze and reached out, slowly. Tony's breath caught and held, and then Steve's fingertips brushed gently over the fabric-covered length of Tony's cock. Tony exhaled, his breathing gone shaky, and he made a soft noise of pure need that Steve thought was the best sound he'd ever heard.
It's not the most awkward thing that's happening right now. Steve was unconsciously beginning to reach for Mr. Stark and push him back down into his seat -- dear God -- and Mr. Stark, clearly appalled, has been twisting away to avoid Steve's touch. Horrified at his own boldness, Steve stops where he is, and then Mr. Stark does too, and now they're here, a frozen, unbalanced tableau.
And since he's going out as Captain America, side by side with his teammate Iron Man, he doesn't even get to dress up.
Steve watches as Tony struggles into his underwear. He's gone soft now; there are still lines pressed into his hips and thighs from the pressure of the rope harness. Steve's trying not to think about sex. Tony stands up for the half-second necessary to get his briefs on, then wobbles and sits down heavily.
He pulled back his cowl, unfastened the mail of his uniform shirt, and hung it up. He was at home; he might as well get comfortable, and he was certainly more comfortable in just the undershirt. The rest of the uniform wasn't as heavy. He didn't mind keeping it on.
"Nothing relevant to this meeting," Steve said, and then because Jan was still glaring, he knew he had to admit it. At least some of it. "I'm really worried about Tony, Jan." He sighed. "It's just-- all the lies, all the
This was what they had been trying to set up, Steve realized. This was why they had tracked the fight to Central Park. This was what they'd needed the footage for. Radioactive Man had been meant to explode. And Tiberius had intended to blame it on Tony.
The word sticks in Steve's brain, snagging the edge of a very painful memory, a fingernail catching in a rough thread. The Vault. The Guardsmen. Tony knocked him out with a negator. That was what he'd called it. Left him paralyzed but conscious. Just like this.
impressed that that wasn't a sex joke," Clint, who had not even been in this conversation, called from the couch.
Unsurprisingly, Tony definitely needs to. He's shaking, off-balance. He's clad only in the underwear that Steve gave him earlier in the evening, and Steve can't actually feel him through his heavy uniform, but he can tell from the goosebumps stippling Tony's shoulders that Tony's definitely not wearing enough clothing.
He kissed Steve's nipple, and Steve made an extremely undignified noise. He didn't really care about dignity right now. The pleasure was a straight line to his aching cock, and he was desperate for more. "Oh, Tony," Steve breathed. "Tony, you're definitely a genius. Oh, so that's good." He cradled Tony's head, running his fingers through Tony's hair, careful to avoid the bruised spot. Tony deserved all the encouragement in the world.
"I don't know about that, Shellhead," Steve says, in as kindly a manner as he can. "I happen to like all your feelings a lot. And it's just me here. You can like whatever you want and I'm not going to judge you for it. You can like this. I'm glad you like this." He smiles. "After all, I like holding you. I'm glad there's something I can do for you that makes you happy."
That was-- well, it was awfully sweet. Tony had done all this because he loved him, had loved him so quietly all along, and Steve had never known. Tony hadn't done it for him to know about, and somehow that made it even more real.
Makeup had fussed over Steve for a good half-hour -- apparently the cowl got in the way of their work -- and now Steve was standing just off-stage, watching and waiting for his cue. Carol was leaning against a wall, a few feet away, in full Warbird uniform, and she smiled tightly and gave him a black-gloved thumbs-up, which he returned. She'd offered to come along for moral support. Steve still wasn't sure if it was because she felt guilty about his hand getting broken last week -- which hadn't even been her fault -- but he was happy to have a friendly face around. Plus, Carol had had a fair amount of journalism experience herself, even if that mostly wasn't in television.
Steve brought his hands up, took a deep breath, and let everything else slide out of his mind. There was only the battle.
Her expression turned even more grave, and she breathed out heavily. She was silent for a few seconds before she spoke. "I know this is a hell of a thing to ask you right now, like this, but you're Tony's closest friend--"
Tony rolls Steve over like he's arranging a toy and pulls the covers up over him, ready to head out the door and think about his own life choices. This was necessary. All of it. Steve can't be allowed to interfere with the rest of the Illuminati. They had to wipe his memory of the relevant events. There was nothing else they could do. There was nothing else he could have done.
The cheaper option would have been to borrow some SHIELD power-dampening cuffs. Those, Tony knew from hearing various agents grouse about it, were always going missing. But they wouldn't have been half as nice as these were. Tony ran a finger inside the cuffs. They were soft. Lined. Comfortable. Once again, quality. He told himself not to linger, and he put the cuffs down. He wasn't just going to pet all the leather this person owned. That would have been... a transgression.
, Tony," he said, softly, his voice brimming with a wretched sadness. He looked like he might cry. "Please don't do this to me."
Tony pets his hair for another minute or two, saying nothing, before he takes his hand away and goes back to work. Steve hears the keyboard again, the scrawling of pen on paper. Tony's arranged his schedule very carefully so no one will need to come in, and they stop if anyone calls; that's not what either of them want.
After that, of course, was the dinner-and-philanthropy portion of the evening, as Tony went from table to table and made nice with the glitterati. The Avengers, of course, were expected to do the same, on a smaller scale. Steve found himself seated next to an older couple who had an interest in art, so they spent a companionable ten minutes discussing Mark Rothko before the woman leaned in avidly and put a hand on his arm.
"I absolutely wouldn't care," Steve assured him. "But if you'd rather have, uh, what I offered, I'd also really like to do that. Really. I just want to make you happy."
He wasn't that far from the mansion, either. Steve could be there fast. But Tony hadn't asked for help. Not from Steve, not from anyone. That meant that he had this. He'd fought Radioactive Man dozens of times, surely, over the years. He was going to be okay.
It did; Tony chuckled. There was a little color in his face. "There's a thought to keep me warm on a cold night, huh?"
He looked like he'd honestly convinced himself that Steve wasn't ever going to want to touch him again now that Steve knew he was queer, and that was so terrible that Steve couldn't bear thinking about it.
The noise was thunderous in the quiet room, echoing, unbelievably loud. The door rattled in the frame, and Steve heard the vase next to the door wobble on its plinth.
When he woke up he was on a steel table, shackled, spread-eagled. Someone had pulled off his tie and undone his shirt, but left the rest of his clothes intact. His shirt gaped all the way down. The walls were metal, too; the RT reflected off them, endless mirrors of blue-white light, dazzling him.
And if anyone else walked in on them right now, they were definitely going to know he and Tony were an item. Steve was sitting on one end of the couch, laptop balanced on the arm of the couch, paging through reports one-handed. Tony was stretched out on the couch, with his head in Steve's lap. Steve was absently stroking Tony's hair with his other hand. Tony's eyes were half-closed in bliss.
He wrapped his arm around Tony and tugged him closer, backwards and over until there was enough room for them to both fit comfortably on the mattress. Tony curled up next to Steve, draping himself over him, warm and solid and real. Then Tony leaned up and kissed him, lightly, and, oh, that was nice. Everything seemed a little less urgent right now; Steve could just enjoy the sensation.
Steve nervously runs his bare hands down his uniform, unnecessarily adjusting the gloves tucked into his waistband.
"Yeah, that." Tony's voice was calm. "I saw you trying not to look at it when I was dressing earlier. And I know you're curious. Of course you're curious. I know I never told you about it, either."
Tony made a low, raw sound somewhere between a laugh and a cough. "Terrible. Thanks for asking." His voice was flat.
Steve's room looked the way he'd last seen it, though the sheets were in more disarray and Tony's shoes were lined up at the edge of his bed.
"I haven't had the chance," Tony says, his secrets spilling out of him like another spray of flowers. "I, uh. I only just met him five minutes ago."
"Not a problem," Steve says, because, after all, he has fought Baron Blood. "That's why my uniform's got neck armor." Not that he's wearing the uniform right now. His pajamas do have little stars on them, though.
He smacked Steve's ass again, barehanded, and Steve sobbed again. "Tony. Please," he said, and he left it hanging, like he didn't know what he was asking for anymore. Maybe he didn't.
On the other hand, this is definitely not the mental state that someone who needs to be armored-up and ready for battle in the next five minutes needs to be in.
Steve knows that Tony's still dropping; he knows, too, that the events of the past few hours haven't shaken Tony free of subspace. When he's down in it, when he's really into a scene he's so very eager to please. Tony still wants to give him the right answer and is more than a little distressed that he can't. Tony in a normal state of mind has absolutely no problem disagreeing with him. Several bitter incidents over the years have demonstrated that. Steve remembers the look on Tony's face when he said he knew how to use a negator.
He knows that even if Tony had thought of it, Tony never would have said it first. He wouldn't have presumed that Steve wanted to. This has to be Steve's choice. Steve's offer.
The coffeemaker is ready, then, and he holds up one finger, then turns around and pours himself a cup. He raises his eyebrows and tips his head in the direction of the coffee. The question is obvious.
Tony had found anger again, somewhere within him. "I don't know what your problem is," he said. He laughed, a short bark. "I mean, I do know what your problem is, actually." He looked Steve up and down. "You're jealous."
Iron Man shoves the door shut behind himself and then leans back on it for a second or two, before he pulls himself up to his full armored height, and that seems to take all the energy he's got. He's really not well, is he?
Eventually, after wrestling with Steve's body and giving silent thanks to Stephen Strange for making such a good spell, a spell that is keeping Steve unconscious long enough for this, he has Steve down to his boxers. Steve probably sleeps in his boxers.
