“What the hell did you take?”  John’s voice boomed in the tiny bathroom.
“Too much.”
Sherlock felt the knot catch in his rim and then stop the next thrust short.  The stretch was already tremendous.  He could not imagine more.  John’s shallower thrusts let him catch his breath and he felt light-headed from oxygen.  “So good.  Feels so, so good.”
They lay in silence for long minutes, the only sound their hollow desperate panting as they tried to regain their breath.
John’s palm moved over the nodule and this finger found another above it.  John considered how unusual this was, as Sherlock moaned even louder and pressed his hands over his face.  John wanted with equal intensity, to take him to a medical facility and inspect every inch of him, and to fuck him senseless.
“It’s just the hormones talking.”  Sherlock said.
Sherlock sighed at the feeling of the cock rotating deep within his body.  John sympathised.  It felt uniquely incredible.  His cock throbbed with a weak effort to produce more come.  John kept rolling Sherlock until he was on his chest.  His legs hanging from the bed and John was pressed tight against his bum.
John woke alone and cold.  His back ached and the dried crust of lust itched ever where that it lingered.  He looked around desperately for Sherlock.  The room was silent.  The cover on the bed were a mess, dried opaque splodges spread between smears of blood.  Jesus, he really had let his Alpha side get away from him.
“How long since your last heat?”  John asked.
“Knot me, John.”  Sherlock wailed.
“I can do this myself, you know?”  Sherlock trapped John’s hands and the cup and pulled both back towards his lips.
The bathroom was locked.
“I’ll shatter if you don’t.”
“Tie my hands.  Tie them to the bed.  Then I know you will be ok.  I won’t be able to let go unless I know you’re safe.”
“I want you,” Sherlock snapped, then more softly, “only you.”
“So good.  Very.  Never so good.”
John fumbled to undo his clothing as he slowly worked Sherlock open, twisting and separating his fingers.  Once he had his pants shoved down, he hissed with relief.  His cock leaping up to slap him on his belly.  He was thankful that Sherlock had his head tipped back so he could not see his intimidating size.
John has a suggestion that might help Sherlock stay ready to take his cock while they rest and talk.
As they cooled, John dragged the duvet down over them and they slept on the hard floor amongst their sticky mess.
“You don’t, you know, use assisted devices?”
“I’m fine, but you could have hurt yourself.”
“So stretched.  Can hardly breathe.”  Sherlock moved to touch his flat stomach, now so full of John’s cock that he could not take a full breath.  He could feel John’s hardness beneath his hand.  John placed his hand over Sherlock’s, their fingers intertwining and pressing down.
Panting and embarrassed by his needs, Sherlock turned his head away.  “I’m cramping again.  I’ll need you inside me again soon.”
“It’s a double zero.”
Sherlock keened long and high pitched as he slid his forearm deeper still.  The noise of that deep eloquent voice turned into incomprehensible bliss did things to John’s cock.  He had never seen Sherlock like this.  He suspected that very few had.  Maybe no one.  Then he realised, he was the first.  Not to fuck him, he had said as much and he did not act like a virgin Omega, but to see him in the throes of helpless bliss.  “No one has ever tried to make it good for you.  Have they?”
“Can’t eat.”  Sherlock mumbled.  “Stuffed full.”
“You don’t have to.  Just take it.  That’s all you have to do.”  John growled as he sunk his fingers into Sherlock’s hips.
“Feel good?”  He asked.
“An alpha did these.  I’ve seen ones like this before, while I was deployed.”  It was never a good thing to see.  Omegas taken by force, the unwanted Alphas asserting dominance through violence.  The victims traumatised.  Sherlock didn’t say anything, didn’t deny it. Just turned his face away.  John read so much in that movement.  “You weren’t in heat when these happened were you?”
“About two inches.”
“I’m going to break this door down if you don’t tell me you’re ok.”  John said with rising fear that he would find Sherlock collapsed on the floor.  How long had he slept?  Had Sherlock collapsed through neglect, through injury, had he really been far too rough?
There is a NSFW link embedder in this chapter, seriously don't open this on your work computer or in front of your nan.
Ok, here is the boring but important bit. This is not a non-con story, but some chapters might push those boundaries a little bit, and remember real life is more complicated than fiction. This is all fun in fiction land, but in real life make sure you negotiate what you and your partner find enjoyable, sex is not the time for surprises.  Rough sex is great if everyone is having a well negotiated wonderful time.  Painful sex is not so much fun.  If you are hurting your partner it is time to stop.  Look after each other and read all the signals, not just the words. And remember consent can be complicated and can be withdrawn at any time so always check, check and double check that your partner is totally into it.
“I came to completion,” Sherlock said, his voice hoarse, but his words more formal and ridged than they should have been when two men were in so intimate a position.  Then as an afterthought he added, “more than once.”
“Without the piercing, it feels less rigid.”  Sherlock observed.
“It’s too late in your heat for that.”  John shouted.  Sherlock looked so saddened that John softened.  “You really hate this, don’t you?”
“You did so well to take it all, you even took my knot.”
“If you’ve gone that far, there is only one way to put a stop to it and it does not involve anything I learned at medical school.  Well, not in class anyway.”
John could not deny him.  He already felt like he would burst, and Sherlock had been aroused longer than he had.  John adjusted himself within his pants.  Pants that were rapidly becoming cripplingly uncomfortable.
Sherlock’s breath hitched and he threw his head back as John’s cock rubbed against his own.  His own moisture making the slide smooth.  A large drop of warmth spilled onto the place where his ribs met in the centre of his torso.  He looked down to see that it was a dollop from the slit of John’s cock.  “You’ll be so deep.”
Sherlock flinched.
Back by popular demand (about three of you asked for it and that is all my ego needs to write more). Here is another chapter of smutty smut.  A bit of plot peeks in, but it is mostly just raunchy sex worthy of the Alpha/Omega trope.
He wanted a shower.  He wanted to run and never return.  He considered this, even with the clarity that he would be raped by another Alpha the moment he slipped through the front door.  At least he did not expect anything better from them.  Still, it was not John he wanted to run from, it was his body, his hormones and his past.  John’s rough treatment was not a surprise, that was just how Alphas acted.
“No.  Do you?”  John said.  His heart spiking in his chest.
When it finished, they were both still hard.  Satisfied, but unsated.  .
“Just let me lie here, just for a while.  It’s not so bad right now.”
John nodded, he had seen Omegas like this before, so needy for cock that everything else was a nuisance.
“Some people who aren’t geniuses have an amazing ability to stimulate others.  Are you ready for more?”
John grumbled.  Scratched himself, rolled onto his back and snored louder.
John obliged.  He had to lift his foot off the ground to press his thigh against Sherlock’s groin, but Sherlock held him steady even as his hips twitched.  John could not have cared if they had both fallen to the ground.  He could feel the Sherlock throb through his jeans.  He licked deeper into Sherlock’s mouth, God, he tasted like bliss.
John waited a beat, heard nothing more.  He braced his shoulder and ran at the door.  Wood splintered as he crashed into the bathroom.  Sherlock was curled up naked on the floor.  Leaning against the side of the bathtub.  He was pale and shaking.  John went to him, knelt before him.  Felt his feverish forehead, even as he tried to pull away.  Smelt his scent, something was off.  He asked gently, “what happened?”
“Fine.”
Over time he felt John’s dick soften.  The giant is sleeping, he thought, just like its master.  He played with the idea of ripping free.  Was it worth it to wake John?  Would he be angry?  An angry Alpha was not much fun to deal with, and he knew, all too well, how John struggled with his anger.
“Yes.  And yes.  I did try to tell you, but…”
The Fake Slick was thick and silky, smoother than what his own body had ever provided.  Soon John was slipping in two fingers easily.  Sherlock undulated his hips in time with John’s strokes.
John turned back to him and gently guided him to sit on the edge of the bed.  Stepping forwards between his thighs, he bent and kissed him again.  It was slow and smouldering this time, but an undercurrent of nervousness tainted it.  The reality of this was suddenly apparent to both of them.  John nuzzled into Sherlock’s neck, breathing in the smell of him.  “Did you prepare yourself while you were in the shower?”
“I’m not made of glass, John.  I won’t shatter.”  Yet, felt like a lie on his lips.
Still fingering the edge of his opening, John rocked the toy ever so slightly.  Sherlock’s cock bobbed and his hole shuddered and clenched.  Again, John repeated the movement, feeling the changes in Sherlock’s opening as the toy moved within him.
“Let’s make this one all about you, yeah?”  John said, as his fingers tickled along Sherlock’s side.
John knew.  He could see the signs: the flushed look in Sherlock’s face, the heat from his body.  He could smell them too: the increased scent.  The things it did to him.  “I want you Sherlock.  I want you so bad.”
Sherlock felt every quivering agonising millimetre led by the heavy ring that still felt cold within him.
John smiled at the uninhibited way Sherlock moaned as he closed his fist and rocked back against the inside of his opening.
John relinquished the cup and left Sherlock to consume the steaming drink.  John finished up his toast and nursed his tea as it cooled.  He wondered how Sherlock could be drinking his own so quickly while it was still so hot.  He ran his eyes along the beautiful naked body beside him.  He couldn’t believe the turn this day had taken.  Describing it as a rollercoaster barely went far enough.  His cock gave a twitch in his pants as the thought of the three, or was it, four rounds of great sex that they had already had.  Better yet, there was surely more to come.  Maybe with the help of the toy, he’d be able to sink in in one thrust.
Eyes wide, Sherlock gulped.  How had he not noticed that metallic purple and blue monstrosity on the bed?  He must have brought it in when he fetched the lube.  “Where did you get that?”
John nodded.  He wanted nothing else.  He stepped forwards between Sherlock’s parted thighs.  Holding himself he ran the tip of his cock and the piercing along Sherlock’s cleft collecting a generous coating of silky moisture.
Delayed arousal made John feel much the same way, but he was still worried about hurting Sherlock.  His cock was long, and it would penetrate much further than he had opened Sherlock up.
“Yes, true.  There are new tests available.  I know a good specialist.  When your heat is over, they can look into what is going on.”
“Sherlock.”
“You don’t want to?”  Sherlock said with a feeling of disappointment that threatened to dampen even the strongest drive within him.  If John declined, he was in for a hell of a heat.  If John declined, what did that mean for them?  Would things be forever awkward; now that Sherlock had put him in this position?
“Shit.  I’m sorry.  I made it worse, didn’t I?  I was too rough.”
“I can take it.  Just fuck me.”
John scrambled to hold Sherlock’s hips down.  Fear for his friend mixing with a primal urge to not let the Omega escape.
“I left my wallet in there.  I need to grab it before I go.”
The sight before him, pale skin, taught muscles, all ending in those captive wrists.  Knowing the Omega could not run.  Could not escape.  That was all that held him back from fucking savagely.  Knowing that he was in full control.  It was control that he revelled in.  His Alpha fed off it like it was an elixir.  “Enough if this.  Brace your hands against the headboard.”
“Do you regret it?” Sherlock asked now that John was too busy to look at him as he asked.  John looked up as soon as he spoke though.  A string of saliva connecting them, mouth to nipple.
“It’s ok.  I’m in now.  It’s done.”  John said as his hips pressed against Sherlock’s plush arse.
“Where the hell would I go?”  Sherlock muttered towards the empty doorway.
John smiled down at him as he lifted Sherlock’s legs up onto his shoulders, pressed himself forwards.  Bending Sherlock in half.  Sinking deeper into his tight heat.  God, he felt good.  John’s hips moved more, pulling at Sherlock’s rim with his bulging cock.  Pulling as hard as he dared.
Sherlock blushed lightly.  “That’s not what people usually say.”
“Where the hell would I go?  I have a rod the size of the bloody Gherkin up my arse.”
Sherlock got up slowly.  Holding the towel, that was discarded earlier, against himself to keep from dripping sperm and mucous down his legs and across the floor.  Every movement hurt and he his knees felt weak as he wobbled in staggering steps towards the bathroom.  The click of the bathroom door sounded like a gunshot, but once it was closed and locked, he felt free.  His mind was clearer now that he was away from the scent of the Alpha.
“That explains a lot.  I thought you just took suppressants.”
“I needed my body to stop this, I couldn’t take anymore.”
John instantly stilled all movement.  “Sorry, sorry, we can stop.”
No answer came.  He pulled on his Alpha Support Shorts as he raced from the room.  He ran through their home.  The kitchen was empty.  The sitting room was empty.  Upstairs was empty.
“Just there.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  There.  That...”  Sherlock blurted out suddenly.
Sherlock squirmed as another dribble of slick ran from his centre.  John watched it run over Sherlock’s sack and when it was about to drip to the bed, he directed his cock to scoop it up.
“Easy now.  Let’s lay down.” John soothed him as he pulled him down.  John tangled their legs together so Sherlock could not pull away and held him tight against his chest.  Slowly, their breathing evened out and synchronised.  John rubbed his hand over Sherlock’s belly to sooth the cramps.  His cock could feel his hand moving and he shuddered with blissful pleasure.
Sherlock’s voice was impassive when he replied.  “No, you don’t.”
John let the bitterness he felt roll over him, then flush away.  “They look like they were pretty serious.”
Sherlock winced.  His body needed relief again.  It ached with a deep want that nothing could deny.  Not his mind palace, not a puzzle, not a chemical experiment, not even a case, nothing but deep penetration and the scent of an Alpha.
Any special requests?   (No promises, but I'll try.)
They lay together in silence, the only sound that of the traffic outside.  Over time, Sherlock could feel the heat building, the ache inside, dulled slightly by the huge toy, increased.  John’s scent wrapped around him made him light-headed and numb to the past.  He needed to be friction.  Movement.  “Are you awake?”
“Bare down.”  John commanded.
“I guess.”  Sherlock agreed; still evasive.
“I need to come.”  Sherlock gasped out.
Sherlock slurped down the last of his tea with an exaggerated noise.  “Drink your tea, John.  It will go cold if you leave it much longer.”
John stole any argument Sherlock might have had with a deep kiss.  He knew that Sherlock would not believe him, for some time, perhaps ever, but he would show him, in any way he could that he deserved to be treated better than he had in the past.  John kissed him, held his hand tightly.
“We can use some toys.  I can help you without actually going through the motions of intercourse.”
“What’s wrong?” John asked, concerned by Sherlock reaction.
“No, you’re not.  You’re just going through a hormonal episode.  Don’t be so dramatic.  It happens to Omegas every day.”
He pressed back deep, withdrew far enough that the toy curved and threatened to bulge free from Sherlock’s body as he pressed back in.  A moan was drawn from Sherlock’s lips.  The head of the huge toy renting him open as John forced it deep again.  Sherlock left his breath hitch as the depth rearranged his insides.  It felt so different to John, big, nearly as huge as he was, but not hot, not as demandingly hard.  The head wide, but without the uniqueness of John’s pierced cock.  Cataloguing the differences Sherlock had not noticed he was breathing out soft deep noises of pleasure.  He stopped himself, only to begin again as John sunk his mouth over Sherlock’s cock as he continued to rock the toy in and out of his body.  Sherlock buckled at the unexpected bliss.
John was floored by the admission.  He had been so forceful; he let his Alpha take over.  He had hardly though about Sherlock as he had driven into him.  The assumption that the Omega was loving it just because he was in heat had blinded him to the truth.
Blinding pain consumed Sherlock.  He could not speak.  Could not move.  Could not breathe.  A spike of fear rose in him even as he was ejaculating hard enough that it hit him on the chin.
“I’ve got you now,” John promised, as he ran a hand down Sherlock’s flank, over shuddering skin, and firm muscle, “I’ll look after you.”
“There is no warning sufficient for that,” Sherlock gestured to John’s cock as he laid back on the bed, “it should come with a siren and flashing lights.”
John ran his hands down Sherlock’s long thighs, from his knee to his crotch.  Then he tentatively rubbed the pads of his fingers over Sherlock’s opening.  Sherlock choked on his breath.  John was worried; despite how wet he was, despite the scent indicating that he was well into his cycle, he was still completely closed up.
“So big.”
“You’re so big, John.”  Sherlock gritted out.  The feeling was all consuming and overwhelming.  He could think of nothing but the stretch.  He was sure it was only his imagination, but he thought he could feel the hard steel tracking up high into his abdomen.
The hand tightened, the toy jabbed deep and stayed there.  And Sherlock tipped.  Flooded with spreading pleasure, coming, writhing.  Aware of curious wet impossible heat spreading inside him as if the toy was coming too.  John whispering, “fuck.”  More heat pumping into him.  Sherlock still gasping as the toy rocked and the hand, feather light, stroked him as he orgasmed hard, grunting, every muscle tight.
“Not yet, let me get you ready first.”  John knew that if Sherlock saw him before he was delirious with heat and desire, he would get more nervous about what was to come.  John needed him relaxed.
When his hand cramped, he told Sherlock he was going to pull out for a moment.  John attached the deep applicator, a tool that was designed to be used when Alphas had intercourse with betas or other Alphas.  John had bought it as there was no way he could penetrate any of his beta girlfriends without flooding them with lube.  He had never imagined he might get to use it on Sherlock’s deep tight channel.  He slid the long smooth metal applicator as deep into Sherlock’s body was it would go and then pumped lube into him.  Sherlock’s mouth fell open at the sensation.  John kept pumping.  Sherlock’s eyes went wide.
“What do you mean?  Of course, it will work.  It’s all just hormones and instincts.”
“Is it me?  Is it because I said about claiming you?”
“There is nothing wrong with you.” John breathed.  “God.  You’re perfect.  So tight.  Fuck.”
Oh fuck.
“I did try to warn you,” John said, kindly.
When Sherlock relaxed enough that a gush of sweet-smelling slick streamed from him, John went back to stroking and thrusting.  His hand was cramping so much that he had to removed it completely to shake out the ache.  He used his right hand for a few moments before swapping between his left and right hand with every thrust.  Using four fingers and going in all the way to the base of his thumb.  Sherlock’s body opening like a flower in the wake of his orgasm.
“I don’t think you’ll be able to take me.  You’re so thin.  I’ll break you if I try.”
“Come on.  Let’s get you more comfortable.”  John said gently.  He helped Sherlock up.  Sherlock clung to him as they staggered towards the bedroom.
John nodded, unsure whether he should, but unable to think of another way.
“Oh.  Do I just?”  John asked.  Sherlock could hear the cheeky smile in his voice.
“When did these happen?” He asked, his voice reverent and serious.
Ok now go and enjoy some dirty rotten smut.
Sherlock was surprised to hear those words.  Alphas did not care, they just took.  Took from his body the pleasure they sought.  Took what they needed.  If he got anything from it, it was purely a happy accident.  He shivered with the faint hope that John was not lying.
Towelling off he felt fresher and freer than he had all day.  He resolved that he would ride out the rest of his heat alone.  He would not be driven by his own biological drive or anyone else’s.
Sherlock gripped hard; his knuckles white.  John released his cock.  Grabbed both hips, pulled back until just the ring was inside Sherlock, paused for a breath.  Then he drove forwards as hard as he could.  Sherlock’s insides having no choice but to part for John’s cock.
John pulled back, letting his cock slide the full length of Sherlock’s belly.  This was madness.
Cheers for all the love so far.  Watching that hit counter is addictive.  Thanks for being my drug of choice.
No.  Almost.  John’s mouth had been right there on his neck.  Sherlock pressed his face back into the floor in dismay.  More moisture ran from him.  Sherlock tried to clench down again.  His bloody body would not cooperate; it would never cooperate.
“I can assure you, that I most certainly do.  I want it more than anything in the world.”  John took a deep inhale of the scent, hints of expensive leather and wool filling his nose.
John pressed forward with his index finger into a heat so fiercely tight that they both gasped.  “You’re so tight.”
Their chest pressed together, and Sherlock wined at the rough feeling of John’s shirt against his sensitive skin.  He pulled back just enough to get one hands between them to flick the buttons open and shove the shirt back from John’s broad shoulders.  Sherlock pressed forwards again.  Skin against skin for the first time.  Sherlock moaned into John’s mouth.  The taste and smell of him was enhanced by the proximity and his lust.  It was sending Sherlock half mad with desire.  He needed more.  Slotting a knee between John’s thighs he hoped that John would return the favour.  He needed friction.
“I can get someone else.”  John said, even as his Alpha churned at the thought.
“John.”
None were like John though.  None had his size or his determination.  He cleaved his way in.  Slow.  Relentless.  Endless, deep thrusts.  Deep, yet later when he was fully seated, this would seem shallow by comparison.
John was still there wrapped around him.  Still deep inside him.
Sherlock had napped earlier.  He did not need to sleep again.  Even if he had, discomfort would have prevented it.  His body still stretched to the point of cramping around John’s thick cock.  The sticky heat of his cycle.  The mental disquiet in the wake of the earlier flashback.  He hated all of this.  He hated being controlled by his body or worse yet by the body of a controlling Alpha.  He hated the rough way they all handled him, as if he was a thing.  The way he was stripped of his personality both by hormones and by the hormones of the others around him.  He hated that they took pleasure from him and what he got in return was little more than a biologically driven reward loop.  He hated the empty feeling of being with someone yet not a part of something.  He felt more alone with a cock up his arse than he ever did.  He knew, now more than ever, that he was destined to remain unbonded.  John asking him had been a stupid impulse driven by his stupid dysfunctional hormonal brain.  He knew that John would regret it as soon as his rut was over.  Enjoying his body was one thing.  Being connected to him for life was quite another.  John of all people should understand why that was something to avoid.
Every thrust pushed air from Sherlock’s lungs.  He was breathless after four.  Unable to take a full breath as his inside struggled to accommodate John’s formidable Alpha endowment.  He should have been struggling against it.  Breathless and in pain, yet an ecstasy that he had never experienced overwhelmed everything else.  The smooth heavy ring slid along his channel lighting up every pleasure centre in his body and brain.  The burning itch of desire was satisfied and the ache deep within was soothed by pounding.  John retched deeper inside him than anything ever had before.
“Hurts.  Can’t breathe.” Sherlock’s said in a pained whisper.  His brow creased and he continued his efforts to pull away.
“I won’t hurt you,” John said with a shake of his head, but even as he spoke, he pushed forward, driven by primal drives to take.  To fuck.  To plunder.
He helped Sherlock to prop up his hips with a pillow and shuffled forwards to line up his cock.  He had to stroke himself up to hardness, the lack of scent, making him strangely slow to get excited.  He pushed the tip inside.  Something was wrong, John registered.  Sherlock’s hole was not only tight but dry too.  Sherlock whimpered, pressed his eyes shut.  John pulled out.  “Shh, take it easy.  Sorry.  I thought you’d be stretched enough.”
“My cycles are inconsistent, always have been.  I didn’t know yesterday.”
“She also told me to look after you.”  John said, “see, even she knows you’d be refusing to eat.”
Silence sat between them.  Long.  The shadows shifter as the clouds passed over the weak sunshine.  John finished his tea.  Nursed the mug.  Held his hand.
Sherlock smelled a smooth rich scent, similar to his own.  He lifted his head to give John a questioning look.  He was holding a dark bottle with a rich golden label.
John paused.  “Do you want me to stop?”  God, he hoped not.  He was so on edge.  He wanted to keep going forever.
Sherlock stared at the ceiling as he felt the stretch increase as John added another finger.  It felt good even through the pain.  His body and mind rebelling and they fought over what was too much and what was not enough.  His instincts won.  The heat deep inside was worse than the stretch at his opening.  Everything primal within him shouted that he needed more.  Deeper.  Larger.  Fuller.
“They are just allowing me to finally say what I’ve wished I could for a long time.”
The air huffed out of Sherlock as John thrust his knot inside.  The orgasm it triggered in Sherlock was intense and instantaneous.  He shook and quivered and shouted as his body clamped down on the intrusion as John thrust, shallow and fast, chasing his own release.  Sherlock was at the point of over sensitivity and oxygen depletion, his body in shock as John’s knot expanded further as John came.
“Yes, Sherlock?”  John teased, with a smile in his voice.  He could not believe the sight before him.  Sherlock with his head thrown back.  His long neck stretched and his chest heaving.
“I hate being ruled by my body,” Sherlock said, and then gesturing at John’s huge erect cock, precome glistening from the place where the ring went into his urethra, “and that’s freaking intimidating.”
“Not to me.”  Sherlock sulked, finally moving to get up from the floor.  He got to his knees, but he could hardly stand.  John caught him when he faltered and moved him towards the bed.  “Jesus, John, you’ve torn me apart.  My insides are ruined.”
“Maybe.”  John was not sure if he was asking or agreeing.  This had all been a lot to take in.  He wanted to lie down.  His legs were shaking.  The angles were all wrong.  There was no way without crushing Sherlock.  And either way, their legs would be hanging off the mattress.  He should have thought this through better.  They would be locked together for ages.
“Here, turn over.”  John said.  Helping Sherlock to roll towards him.  Sherlock groaned, his body unwilling to move.  The toy pressing into clenching depths.  John having to lift his heavy limbs.  Sherlock settled onto his back; his face twisted in discomfort.  John cupped his cheek, “look at me, you deserve better.”
“It will help take the edge off.”  John wished he could come too.  He was aching with hardness.
John’s nose was buried against Sherlock’s neck.  The scent of him was incredible.  The pain and fear tinging the scent with something vulnerable that was not there earlier.  The desire to sink his teeth in was strong.  He wanted to own this beautiful struggling Omega.
John drank down the last of his tea, enjoying the perfect temperature, the rich flavours, and the warm feeling it left in his belly.
John didn’t say that people fuck outside of heats, because he knew that was not the way Sherlock thought about things.  He even seemed somewhat reluctant now that he was in heat.  “Jesus.  I’m sorry. I would have taken it slower if I knew.”
“Are you ok, Sherlock?”
“You’re still not ready.  You are still so tight around my fist.”  John was torn between the desire to watch his forearm disappear into Sherlock’s tight wet heat and the desire to fuck him senseless.
John gave a little laugh; it wasn’t like Sherlock to be so wrong.  “She gives us her congratulations and says she is off to stay with her sister.  She said we could make a much noise as we like.  I might take her up on it.  I might give a good howl next time I fill you up.”
“Too cool, but the texture is similar.”
“Yes, like you.”  John said with embarrassment.  “You can get it made to order.”
John pressed it forward, cutting off anything more Sherlock might have had to say.  Sherlock felt every bit of the huge dildo entering his body.  Cold.  Firm.  Unrealistic.  The wobbling of the artificial cock translating into ripples of odd sensation.
Sherlock nodded his head quickly.
John’s hips juddered as he tried to bury himself and his release deeper.  His vision splinted.  Pleasure rolled through his body.  His orgasm intense as the heavy ring both slowed and prolonged his release.  Sherlock’s body tight as a snare around him as the ripple of muscle spasms milked him.
“Don’t you dare.”  Sherlock said, but he was laughing too.
John lowed the pants a little more, just allowing Sherlock’s cock tip to poke free.  Then he swiped his thumb over the tip to collect the pre come that beaded there before sucking his cock into the wet confines of his mouth.  Just the tip.  Leaving Sherlock desperate for more.  Sherlock realised that his hands had gravitated to John’s head.  Not pressing, but shifting in his hair, feeling it tickle in between his spread fingers.  John hummed, tongued the slit.  Sherlock held back a groan of pleasure.
“Sherlock?”
John groaned in animal pleasure as Sherlock’s body fought him.  He hated himself for feeling so good as he knew that Sherlock was coming undone beneath him, but his cock loved it.  Milked by the rippling panic he spurted again and again into the tight, wet, gripping heat.
“Hurts, yeah?”
“Hmmm.”
“It did, well, sort of,” he explained, “it has a hollow centre, it is possible to inject lube through it via a syringe.”
“Preparing you is going to take a while.  Try to relax.”
“There is rope in the bottom draw.”
He only made it to the doorway though.  He turned back when he heard the soft sound of the towel dropping to the floor.
“What gauge is that ring?”  Sherlock’s arousal suddenly replaced by fascination.
“No.  This is my first heat in ten years.”
Sherlock just continued to struggle beneath him.
“Bored.”  He muttered, not loud enough to wake John.
John grunted as he fought the tinny abortive thrusts his body wanted to make.  Tried to make it a slow even slide in and his body fought him to drive home.  Sherlock’s body was opening up to him, but slowly.  Too slowly.
John hummed and Sherlock thought he would come.  He wanted this to last though.  He panted through the moment, knuckled down on his body’s desire to come.  John bobbed his head, rocked the toy.  Then let it go while it was still inside him as he moved down to suck his balls into his mouth.  Rolled them over his tongue and pulled off, leaving a wet string of saliva between them.
Sherlock thought of the note that Mrs. Hudson had left.  Knew that no one other than John could hear him, yet he still felt too embarrassed to let the little noises escape him.  A life time of holding back was hard to overcome.  He tried though, for John.  He let out a little keening noise as John lowered his pants further.  The cool air of the room startling on his cock.  He lifted his hips so that John could lower his pants properly, the toy making all it’s length and girth be known as he shifted.  Sherlock froze, clenched to try to keep the phallic toy inside.  John was kissing back up his legs, hands exploring the curves and lines of his legs.
“Oh, that’s unconventional, I’ll need...”
“I can’t wait any longer.  I’m going to die if you don’t do it now.”
“Stop playing and get on with it.”
“Yes, John.  I’m not a blushing virgin.”  Sherlock said but he blushed anyway.
John stepped tentatively forward until he could feel the fierce heat radiating of Sherlock’s naked body.  Their eyes met.  Pent up emotions fluttered between them for a long moment before their mouths met and their hands intertwined.  Neither was sure who made the first move.  Neither cared.
When it stopped, he felt drained.  Empty.  Weak.
“Define stop,”  John said carefully.  His eyes flicking away.  He licked his lips.  Wished he hadn’t.  Both because he did not want to give the wrong idea and because with the taste of the air, all the wrong ideas came to him.
“It’s never been like that before, John!”
John sensed it and proceeded to twist his hand, opening Sherlock in all directions.
“You haven’t been with anyone else; since?”
“Right, okay.  Perhaps more than I needed to know.”
They had fucked.
It was an easy resolution until the cramps started up again.
“Only.”  Sherlock said dryly, shifting as the huge toy sunk deeper inside.  “Have you ever used it before?”
“Are you ok?”  John asked into the soft skin of Sherlock’s delicious neck.  “My Alpha took over.”
“I need that in me now.”
“Hungry?”  John asked, certain that even Sherlock must be peckish after half a day of shagging.
“Yeah.”
“No.”  Sherlock said and he meant it.  “Do you think we will?  Afterwards?  Do you think it will be weird?”
John ran his thumb down Sherlock’s cheek, collecting the perspiration that had collected there.  “You’re gorgeous when you’re in heat.  Your skin nearly glows.”
“It smells like…”
“No, never.  If I avoid all Alphas and refrain from all stimulation, especially penetration, I can avoid it without extending my heat.  If I start though, I find I must continue throughout.”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.  If you might feel trapped, it might make it worse.”
“Tell me Sherlock, I need to know whether to call an ambulance.”
“And have me wanting to puke as soon as you want to stick your unjustifiably large cock back in, I don’t think so.”  Sherlock rolled his eyes, even with his back turned, John could tell.  He knew it was an argument he wouldn’t win though.  He sat on the bed in the sliver of space beside Sherlock’s sprawled body.
“No, you were fine, just like any Alpha, but I can’t handle it.”  Sherlock hated his useless body just a bit more.  He shivered again.  “I can never handle it.  My body wants to have sex.  Demands it and then hates it all the same.”
The words compelled John, but the sight before him rendered them unnecessary.  His cock throbbed as he took in the bare-naked sight before him.  Long thin legs, all lean defined muscle, led up to a perfect erection.  John noted that Sherlock was, for an Omega, well endowed.  He was already stiff enough that his cock was hanging off to the side slightly.  Precome was drizzling from the tip.  John wanted to drop to his knees and take a taste.  If the aroma in the room was anything to go by, it should be delicious.  Sherlock’s pail chest heaved breathlessly making his ribs appear and disappear.  His nipples were tight and peaked.  John barely had the strength to ask, “are you absolutely sure?”
“No, you want a warm hole to fuck.  That’s all an Alpha ever wants.  I  am not that.  Not more than once every ten years or so.  I will not make you happy.  I am not designed to spend the rest of my life tied to another person.”  Sherlock growled in frustration, but the growl became a pained whimper as he tried to sit up.  He faltered at the pain it caused deep inside him.  Not just the pain of the tie that held them, but the pain of denying the tie that could hold John with him forever.
Sherlock moaned.  He grabbed John’s wrist tightly in his sweating hands.  Holding him close, pushing him away?  He was shaking so hard it was impossible to tell.
Sherlock did as the Alpha asked and John forced his way a little further inside.  Sherlock pushed back.  His body taking what his mind rebelled against.  They both struggled to maintain composure as John dug in another inch.  John grabbed his hips more tightly.  The need to control was hard wired into his Alpha brain.  “Don’t move.  Just let me in.”
“I, too much, can’t, I can’t move.”  Sherlock said through hiccupping breaths.
John gently pressed Sherlock’s knees open further and promised, “I’m going to look after you so well.”
“You can take it.”  John said with confidence.  Pushed more.  Shoved a little.  “There you go.  Just a touch more.  Does it feel real?”
Where his hand now reached felt dryer and the membrane tacky to touch.  He withdrew his hand slowly, snaking his way free from Sherlock’s body.  His hand wrinkled with the prolonged dampness.  He pumped lube into his palm until it threatened to overflow, then he pressed the full squelching handful into Sherlock.  John pressed deeper, the lube flooding from his hand into the passage, making moving easier and more fluid.  He wanted Sherlock to be soaking though.  He pressed the thin applicator in alongside his wrist and pumped another dose of the warming lubricant in.  The warming lube had a muscle relaxant in it, and he could tell that it was helping to widen Sherlock’s channel.
Sherlock looked at him, questions written in his eyes.  John groped over the bed.  Sherlock’s eyes following his movements, until John held up the most obscenely large dildo Sherlock had ever seen.  It was ludicrous even by the standards of the Omega satisfying tools sold at Deep and Wide.
“I’ll be here for you when you’re ready, if you want me.”  John said, with a hint of doubt in his voice.
He tried to think of boring things.  Unappealing things.  Things that were a total turn off but, he still felt his knot growing as Sherlock rippled and whimpered around him.  John’s Alpha took over.  He could not have stopped it if he had wanted to.  His hip twitched and punched into the man tied in front of him.  Chasing the gripping slide on his endless cock.  Feeling the ring move back and forth in the tip.  Feeling his growing knot catch and pop on the rim of Sherlock’s body until it was too large.  Sherlock’s body denied it once again.  He would not have it though.  He needed to be inside.
“Unless you’ve got better things to do?”  Sherlock’s Omega needs feared that he would say yes; feared he would get up, have a shower, and go to work, leaving him here gaging for more.
John grinned a stupid goofy grin.
“Tell me if this hurts.”  John said.
“Where?  Show me.”
“Make this burning itching hollow feeling go away.”
“But you might not have been.  Alphas get hurt all the time when Omegas freak out.  We have both seen what can happen.  Remember the Schiffer case.”
“Toys?”
John ran his knuckles over the curved mound of Sherlock’s arse.  Fingers ghosting across his lower back.  Skin shivering at his touch.  He traced the little nubs of spine, up then down.  The long muscles his spine.  The shorter ones across his shoulders.  The sliver scars.  The thickness of the skin changing beneath his fingertips where the damage had been inflicted.
“Please, John, deeper.  Something.  More.  Anything.”  Sherlock said, his voice coming in tinny bursts.
“John!  You are amazing, you are fantastic.”
, apparently.”  John said as he worked the flared head of the monster cock inside Sherlock’s stretched channel.  It pushed in with a squelching pop.  Sherlock shook with surprise.  “It’s made by one of those boutique sex toy manufacturers.”
Sherlock panted.  He was barely able to get the words out, “always been like that.  Just part of what’s wrong with me.”
“I’m fine,” Sherlock called back, “go away.”
He needed a moment.  Needed to be alone.  John’s knot and his Omega body were betraying him by locking them together.  He could feel every inch of John.  Could feel the weight of his cock.  The piercing heavy and solid within him.  He willed the knot to shrink.  Willed his body to relax its hold.  Nothing happened.  He huffed and sighed.  He couldn’t reach his phone.  He definitely couldn’t reach John’s, discarded on the floor on the other side of the bed.
John just stroked over Sherlock’s hip and slowly pumped his fingers in and out.  He would need to get his whole fist in if there was to be any chance that he could get his cock wet.
Eventually he swam up to the surface of awareness, John still kneeling between his open knees.  His cock hard within his pants.  His face an image of wonder and curiosity.
Sherlock growled.  His eyes falling shut in defeat.  “I thought as much.”
“Keep that up and I’ll be desperate again in no time.”
John held Sherlock tightly.  Throwing himself forwards to wrap his arms around his chest.  Knowing he would fight and struggle again.  Knowing that the stretch was too much for his body.  He could feel it.  Near painful around his knot.
Sherlock rolled away, happy to be hiding his face.  John helped him tuck a pillow under his hips and then he slicked up the monster cock.
“I can’t.  I’ll tear you open.”
“Hmmm,” John agreed, in between kisses, “your body is amazing.  God, you feel good around me.”
“Too much?”  John asked.
He showered under water hot enough to scald.  Washing away everything either dried or damp.  Washing away memories.  Using the handheld shower head to force water deep into places that needed cleansing.  He washed three times in neutralising body wash.
He couldn’t have just passed it out the door like anyone else would have, John thought as he stepped inside the steamy room.  His eyes raked over the counter for his wallet.  The heady pungent scent arrested him and sent him into an instant fizzing arousal.  His eyes snapped up to see Sherlock standing sheepishly naked with his towel clutched in front of his groin.  The wallet was forgotten in the wake of the sights and smells of the room.
Then everything loosened all at once.  Strings cut; he fell back to the bed.  Still, panting, John still.  The air still.  Silence.
“I don’t think anyone is ever completely ‘ready’ for something like that to be stuck up their arse.”  Sherlock snipped.
“How much more?”  Sherlock mumbled into the pillow.
“Let’s put a pillow under you hips,” John suggested.  Helping Sherlock to get awkwardly into position, then nestling between his thighs, pressing them further apart; knees high.  Gazing at the intrusion that split Sherlock wide open.  He ran a finger around the rim.  Tight and firm and twitching.  He knew what that felt like around his cock and he wanted that again soon, but he wanted to give Sherlock alone pleasure this time.  Despite his own throbbing erection, he wanted to worship him in ways he had never experienced.  He wanted to remove any of this own need from the equation.
John smiled as he rubbed the slick along his cock with both hands.  He directed his cock towards Sherlock’s opening and watched as he sunk the adorned head into the searing vice of bliss.
“I know, but I want it to be good for you.”
Bathroom!
“No, like, huge-big.  Like unnaturally big.”  John pushed another finger inside to drive the message home.  “Not just a bit bigger, like you are.  I’m not bragging, I have had Omegas who cannot handle it.  Most can’t.”
“Omegas are designed to stretch.”
“You don’t want anyone though, do you?”
The bed was a mess, so John pulled the covers back so that Sherlock could lay on the fresh sheets.  Sherlock tuned his back on John and curled into the foetal position.
“I tried to run.”
“No one did.  Not even my stupid brother and he got me out.  Just the doctors who stitched me up afterwards.  No one else.”
Sherlock found John’s hands and weaving their fingers together they shook through the aftershocks.  Locked together they watched Sherlock’s belly in wonder as John’s pulsing cock twitched beneath the skin.
Sherlock moaned long and low as a way of agreeing.  There was no way he could speak now.
“I need it, John.”
“Pushy.”  John chuckled as he pecked Sherlock on the lips and then twisted to retrieve the tea from the bedside table.  He held it to Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock drank a deep gulp.
“A lot.”  Sherlock said at almost the same time.
John took his legs and gently straightened them until they were together and pointing to the roof.
John went back to his tea.  Sipped it.  Traced a long line down Sherlocks arm to his wrist with his free hand.  Sherlock moved his hand, grasped John’s gave it a single squeeze and then release him, but he didn’t pull away.  John didn’t either.  He blew on his tea, sipped a little and held on.
“It’s too much.  Take it out.”  Sherlock cried in panicked breathless gasps.
“Did you come again?”  John asked as his vision started to clear, his breath slow.
“Oh God.  You’re huge and... pierced.”  Sherlock said, eyes wide at the sight before him.
“He won’t be in all week.  Please don’t call again.”  Sherlock hung up before the annoying voice could speak again.
“Good.  Great.  Get on with it.”
Sherlock is torn between what his body needs and what his mind wants.
“I’ll have to get you a great big plug to keep you open for me.” John teased as he tried to thrust.
John grunted.  He doubted it would fit.  He gave a heavy nudge forward.  Sherlock stretched around him, but he could not fit all the way in.
“That’s unusual.  I can write you a referral to a specialist if you like?”
John pushed in.  Just the bulbuls ring entered Sherlock.  Sherlock whimpered as the ridged coolness of the piercing popped inside.
“Have you ever...?”
The scent was gone, John realised.  It was as if Sherlock was only half in heat.  He did not know what to do.  He sat and watched over him, as Sherlock shivered and sweated into the mattress.  His own libido was still high; an Omega was before him in distress, but the confusion of Sherlock’s lack of scent kept him in check.
John heart broke, not at the words but at the vulnerability that was confessed with saying them.  It was clear that Sherlock wanted more; wanted better.  It was clear that he had been treated very badly by Alphas in the past, worse even than John had done earlier.  He deserved better; he deserved to be worshiped.
“I’m going to come again.”  Sherlock said in a voice that was a feathery whispered that held a hint of embarrassment.  He did not want to come so soon, like a horny teenager.  John was doing things to him that he had never experienced, not to this intensity.  The stretch.  The depth.  That sinful piece of jewellery.
“You alright in there, Sherlock?”  John called through the bathroom door.  He had put off asking as long as he could, but he really needed to leave for work.
John had to be more forceful now.  Taking Sherlock’s hips to support his quivering body.  Rubbing the bruises he had put there with his thumb as he pressed in.
AKA a tiny bit of angst before some great shagging.
“I can’t bloody relax.  My body is raging against me.  I’m burning up.  I’m melting from the inside out.”
Sherlock lay staring at the far wall.  John had fallen asleep almost immediately after Sherlock had denied him.  A few late nights, long days and two thorough orgasms was clearly all it took to put an Alpha to sleep.
Only when Sherlock was pushing back; demanding more did he speed up; press harder.  He chased his own pleasure then.  Telling Sherlock how amazing he felt.  His knot catching three, four times then holding just outside his body  Rocking back and forth he went deeper and deeper into Sherlock’s tight channel until his knot was held against Sherlock’s rim.
“Oh.  That’s…”  Sherlock’s thoughts were short circuited when John started working him open with a single slick finger.  The lubricant was both cold and warm.  The cold came from its temperature, but the warmth was clearly an additive.  Sherlock moaned with pure pleasure, “it’s warm.”
“Sherlock.  Do you trust me?”  John said loudly, his face right by Sherlock’s ear.
“We will see if we can change that.”  John withdrew his hand slowly pressing over the little nodules inside Sherlock’s strange body as he left.  Sherlock shudder through an unexpected and sudden orgasm.  His release was weak, just the twitch of muscles and a satisfied sigh.  Working to improve the orgasm, John made a fist against his opening and pumped his cock with his free hand.   Sherlock clenched, startled by the increased pleasure.  He was still coming as John withdrew his hand completely and replaced it with the head of his cock.
He put his tea down.  Stroked a fingertip down Sherlocks ribs; traced along the lowest one to the centre of his body.  “Can you feel it?  Where the toy ends?”
“Feels good doesn’t it?”
“Don’t John.”  Sherlock’s voice was nearly a sob.
“Did you just bond me?”  He asked in an empty calm voice as John relaxed both his mouth and his hold of Sherlock.
“It has just a hint of ginger in it.  Feels good, yeah?”
“Yes.  I can’t do this alone.”
Sherlock strained and groaned.  John continued to push forwards.  His cock throbbed and twitched as he watched his thumb slip inside along with the rest of his fingers.  Sherlock’s body sucking him in all the way to his wrist.
Sherlock whined and clenched involuntarily.  “Just keep going.”
He knew he could not lift Sherlock onto the bed so instead he dragged him backwards gently until they were both on the floor.  Sherlock sitting in John’s lap.
Sherlock sighed; he didn’t want John’s pity.  Then, distracted, he gasped as Fake Slick and come ran from him.  John’s knot had quickly gone soft.  Too spent to remain hard.  They separated slowly.  Untangling.  Stretching over used limbs.  Sherlock moved to get up, but John took his hand, pulled him back down.
“I had you.  That won’t happen to us,” but John shuddered at the memory anyway.
His voice was barely a whisper when he admitted, “I don’t want to panic again.”
Sherlock hissed as the stretch as John moaned, “so tight, I was just in you a moment ago.  How are you so tight again?”
“Drink some tea then, she will never forgive me if I let you succumb to heat fever.”
Sherlock groaned as he folded in on himself.  Bereft at the loss.  Come and mucous dribbled down the crease of his arse cheek towards the floor.  “So empty.  I feel hollowed out.”
“Take them off,” Sherlock encouraged.
“Oh god.”
The bulging median ring slipped inside making Sherlock groan.
John paused when he was half-way in.  He let out a breath he had been holding.  Sherlock’s hole throbbed hot around him and his hips twitched.  John stroked Sherlock’s cock as he sunk in deeper.  He needed to be inside.  The cool air of the room around the base of his cock was like splinters of ice.  It hurt to be outside of him, yet he knew he would break Sherlock if he thrust in.
“Stay here.  Let me look after you.”
John’s desire was back stronger than ever.  Every debauched fantasy he had ever had while surrounded by the smell of this Fake Slick was combined with the sight of Sherlock writhing before him.  When John dared to slip in the third finger Sherlock was still tight.  It was unusual.  Omegas were never this tight after penetration.  Especially after two hard goes on John’s monster cock.  Not even the drugs Sherlock had taken could explain this.  John worked and scissored his fingers until he could feel the muscles start to soften.  He took is time despite his own raging desire.  From time to time his used his slick fingers to rub the head of his own cock for relief.  The warming lube a tingling contrast to the cool room.  When Sherlock had opened up a little more, he used both his thumbs to stretch him apart in all directions and then two fingers from each hand to do the same.
Then, just to see what would happen he let his cock bob up past Sherlock’s balls and holding himself down against Sherlock’s belly he pushed his hips foreword to see how deep his cock would penetrate.  His mouth went dry at the sight.
“No, I’ve never had the chance.  God, it looks good disappearing into you though.”
“Too right they are.  I’m crazy about you.”
“He won’t be in today.  He is attending a private client.”
John hummed.  Roused himself from his meditative relaxation.  “Are your Omega urges ready for another round?”
John pumped his fingers with more intent.  Sherlock’s hand fell into rhythm with John’s movements.  It was only the work of moments.  Sherlock’s back arched off the bed and with the first spurt of come.  John pressed in harder.  Slipping his knuckles and palm into Sherlock’s body.  Watching in fascination as Sherlock spent over his concave stomach.
“I’m not most Omegas, I’m not even a normal Omega.”  Sherlock snapped.
Sherlock nodded.  Gulped with his eyes shut.
“Faster John.” Sherlock requested in desperate little gasps.  His eyes scrunched shut.  Head tipped back.  Hands moving to grip John’s arse and pull him deeper.  He needed more.  He was teetering on the edge.  His body moulded around John’s cock.  His toes scrunched.  A twist of John’s hand made him shudder.  Gasp.
“Nope.  My body just does as it pleases, without my permission.”  Sherlock said with an angry sigh.  “Thankfully, I don’t get too many heats.  They disrupt the work, and it is hard to find a partner.  People find me… off putting.  I usually just lock myself in my room and try to ignore it.”
“I don’t think my body is going to allow for that.”  Sherlock was already looking flushed, and his cock was semihard.
“It’s called
“Oh, I’m, hello.  I was just wondering; is everything was ok?  John is rather late to work this morning.  He was meant to be here two hours ago.  I’ve been trying to call but...”
Sherlock held the mug in one hand and directed John’s fingers to the point on his belly where he could feel the toy.  Higher than his bellybutton and to the left.  John massaged the spot, fancied he could feel the head of the dildo through Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock nodded into the pillow.  Tried to move; to lift himself up on his arms.  Failed as the deep intrusion shifted his mind, and all his energy to the centre of his being.  John sensing his difficulties, helped him to move, rolling him over, moving one limb at a time.  Sherlock muttered complaints as he tired overheated body fought the movement.  Every muscle resisting; burning.  On his back he panted as the mattress pressed the toy deeper into him.  John helped him to shuffle back against a pillow he had propped up and helped him to raise his knees to reduce the pressure.  “Oh, Jesus that’s…”
“It hurts, doesn’t it?” John asked as he rubbed his hands over Sherlock’s hips.
“I know.”  John said softly as he continued to stroke Sherlock through the over sensitivity.  Loving the way his body was writhing and whimpering with the stimulation.  John thrust harder.  His own climax close.  Barrelling down on him.  He held Sherlock still with a free hand upon his hip and pulled back hard, his knot stretching his own cock all the way from the root, stretching Sherlock’s body until it pulled half out.  John growled as he plunged back in.  Three.  Four.  Five times.  Sherlock wailing into a bitten fist to stop the noise.  John coming.  Hard.  Filling him.  Shuddering.  Seeing stars. Breathless and in ecstasy.
Sherlock nodded unsure but curious.  Maybe it would help.  It was about the same size as John.  But more intimidating somehow, maybe because of the colour, maybe because of the large, flared head.
John pulled back a little, reached up and stroked over Sherlock’s cheek with his knuckles.  “My poor Omega.”
John's body and mind want the same thing.
“John!”
There was no answer.
John put a hand on Sherlock’s hip to keep him there.  “Easy now, don’t struggle.  I won’t force it on you.  I thought it might be something you want.  Most Omegas do.”
John laughed, unable to contain himself.  A moment later Sherlock joined in, his sides aching with the effort.  Then they were kissing again; furiously.  John leaning over him, bracketing him possessively with his arms and legs.  Then the kiss slowed became more passionate; their tongues exploring, touching, before the kiss slowed to a deep warmth that stoked the fire in both of them.
“My cycle with last twice as long.  We will both be in agony.  Just fuck me already.”
“Nauseous, can’t eat when I’m cycling.”
John chuckle.
“Oh, oh.”  Sherlock paused; his breath held.  “You tried it yourself?”
Johns moaned at the pressure.  He waited.  Felt for the moment Sherlock relaxed then slid, rocking back and forth.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.  Keeping the movements slow and gentle, gliding withing him.  Feeling every nodule as his cock flicked over them.  It was sending him wild.  Testing his restraint.  He never fucked this slowly.  Never felt it this intensely.  It was a wonderful torture of restraint.
The change in position from their last round caused the ring in the head of John’s cock to press into new places within him.  Triggering new tingling pleasure amongst the pain of penetration.  The ring was startlingly cold as it rolled over all the pleasure centres inside him in a new way.  He was so on edge.  Only John’s firm hand around his cock was stopping him from exploding.
Sherlock was silent so long John thought that he hadn’t heard him, or that he wasn’t going to answer.  “While I was away.”
Sherlock whimpered, unable to accommodate John’s size.  He was shaking with the effort to support himself.  Struggling with the pain and the arousal that intertwined until he could barely tell which was which.
There was a note on the floor on the landing.  A single piece of folded paper.  On the front it said,
“I just need to get some things.  Wait here a minute.”  John said as he raced from the room.
John needs to take care of Sherlock in away that he has never been taken care of before.
Sherlock just hummed.
Frustration built as he was denied the warmth by Sherlock’s defective Omega body.  Sherlock was whimpering in pain, in pleasure, he did not know which one anymore.  He did not have room inside his lizard brain to much care beyond that he could feel that Sherlock was still as hard as a rock in his hand.
“Bare down,” John told him.
“Did you take something?”
“Fuck.”  Sherlock said.  Eyes wide, pupils huge as he reached out and ran his thumb along the ring to where it entered John’s slit.  “That’s what, 10 millimetres diameter?”
“I’m not sure this is going to work.”  John said doubtfully.  “After years of not being used your body will have lost some elasticity.”
“Sherlock, I’m big,” John said carefully.
Sherlock got into position; gripping the headboard as John tied his hands to it.  Sherlock parted his knees already desperate for John to be inside him.
John grabbed the base of Sherlock’s cock, stopping the orgasm.  “I’ll never get in if you tense up more, you’ll have to wait.”
“Scented lube.”  John said with a smile, then read the label, “Fake Slick – for Alphas without an Omega.”
“Feels like a knot.”  Sherlock gasped.  “But not as deep.  Oh.  God.  I need you in me.”
Sherlock nodded weakly.
John smiled.  Sped up.  Sped up his hand.  His hips.  Brought Sherlock to a clenching shuddering climax that filled his hand with creamy white release.  John used it to keep stroking.  Smiling wickedly as he saw Sherlock’s eyes go wide with the realisation that John was going to work him up to another orgasm.
“What do they usually say?”
John didn’t believe him.  “They were deep wounds.”
His cock finally got to the nub that had caused Sherlock so much bliss when he had rubbed his fingers over it.  He felt his cock flick it; the ring catching and releasing.  He could feel the change in Sherlock all around him.  It relaxed him and he opened like a summer flower.  John could finally press in further.  Far enough to get to the next node.  Then the one after, until his budding knot was at Sherlock’s twitching rim.
Sherlock choked a cough as John sunk even deeper with the new position.  His body quivered, his eyes wide, his inside rippled and cramped.  It was too much.
“You should have asked me yesterday or the day before.”
“It felt... satisfying.  It was just a lot.  Afterwards, it was too much.”
With great difficulty, Sherlock managed to roll away from John and wrap himself around a pillow, nearly face down, relieving the pressure from the toy slightly.
He stroked along Sherlock’s flank.  Upwards towards his chest.  Cupped his peck as if it were a breast.  Tweaked his nipple between his thumb and forefinger.  John smiled as Sherlock hissed in a breath.  John rolled the tight nipple between his fingers watching the areola wrinkle and tighten.  He pushed Sherlock down on his back so he could press his mouth down over the tight nipple in a wet worship.
John stretched his fingers as far into his body as he could and repeated the movement.  Felt the nodule, rubbed around it.  Making Sherlock moan and buck against his hand.
John grinned wickedly as he replaced his four fingers.  “Can you take a bit more?”
“That bastard.”  John swore.  “You deserve so much better than that.”
Sherlock didn’t know why John stopped, but he used the moment to regain some composure.  His eyes still tight shut under his elbow.  If he looked a John now, that those bright intelligent eyes, lit up by arousal, be would surely lose his battle and come.
Sherlock groaned with the delay in his orgasm.  He knew John was not even all the way in yet.  His body fighting a conflict between keeping him out and to suck him in deeper.  John had the power to push in;  his cock ridged as steel.  Not every Alpha could.  Sherlock’s body had denied more than one weaker Alpha in the past.  They simply had not had the strength to push into him.  Leaving both of them frustrated and unfulfilled.  Some flew into a rage, others just left him alone to deal with this heat alone.  Only the strongest ones had had the strength and rigidity to push into his fickle body.  Unfortunately, these Alphas were usually the cruellest too, not caring a but for his own pleasure.
“I can’t.  I’m not like you.”
He took his time.  Enjoyed the ripples along the tip of his shaft.  He massaged the Fake Slick along his own length, the warmth providing a glow for him too.  John pressed forward only when Sherlock opened up to him.  It was the slowest he had ever gone with anybody, yet he could tell it was still as fast as Sherlock could take him.  They walked the tightrope of pleasure, pressure, and pain.  John massaged Sherlock’s stomach, trying to get the muscles to relax enough to let him in.  It helped, but it was slow work.
John turned Sherlocks face back towards him, pressed a chase kiss against his lips and brushed the curls back from Sherlock’s face.  He could see the sweat already beading on his forehead.  “I can’t wait.”
They fell silent.  John still running his fingers along Sherlock’s smooth back.  Up and down.  Bump, bump, bump, bump over the scars.  Sherlock still.  His breathing shallow but even.
Sherlock shook his head and said, “never, they just take what they want.”
“No.  No.  Keep going.  It’s just...”  Sherlock stammered as he tried to bring his knees together.
“I’m going to move us so we can rest.”
“Clearly,” Sherlock muttered, clearly embarrassed, then after a pause, “you’re a doctor, can you stop it?”
“I could have hurt you.”
“Don’t you dare.”  Sherlock released one of the hands he had clasped in the bedding to rub over his cock.  He needed a distraction from the stretch.  Three quick pulls and he forgot about the strain within him.
Head thrown back in bliss and anticipation Sherlock didn’t bother to reply.  He thought he probably tasted like day old sweat and come, but he couldn’t articulate it as John mouthed along the waistband of his pants.  Lowering them slowly, kissing more.  Lowering more.  Sherlock was hard and wanting.  His erection pushing up against the constrictive fabric.
“It’s too late now.”  They said in unison.
“The heads bigger than mine though, I bet you’re feeling that go in.”
“Oh, right.  Maybe next time.”  Sherlock’s eyes sunk shut.  Relief and spent exhaustion rolled over him.
“Are you ok Sherlock?”
“Are you sure?  I was really rough.”
It was all John’s Alpha needed to hear.  He thrust a few times without even pulling back.  Nudging Sherlock along the bed.  The damp towel bunching beneath his hips.  Then John pulled back, almost all the way out of the vice-like channel and thrust his whole length home.  The squelch and suck of their lubricated bodies reverberated around the room, louder even than their aroused vocalisations.
Eventually John slowed his rapid thrusts and tucked his thumb close.  He pressed forward with is hand, waiting for Sherlock’s body to give the way it was supposed to.  Sherlock moaned deeply.  John’s hand did not advance.
“Oh, I definitely want to, I just never thought you’d want me to.  You’ve never...”
“It was a joke gift from my army mates.  They said my cock needed a friend.  I’ve been the butt of endless jokes since the first time they saw me in the shower block.  I was going to chuck it out, but it must have cost a fortune, and every time I go digging for something in the back of the wardrobe, I get a laugh out of finding it again.”
John held up the tool, still attached to the base of the enormous toy.  Sherlock lifted his head to inspect the item.
John rolled Sherlock onto his back, leaned in to kiss him.  Sherlock turned his face away.  “Just get on with it.”
“You were asleep too.”  John said, with mock indignation.
He tested the grip between them.  It had loosened.  John did not stir, just continued to snore softly against his neck.  He pulled away further.  The wet slurp of their bodies coming apart sounded too loud in the quiet room.  Sherlock froze.
“Stay here.  I’ll get us a drink. Something to eat.  I’m starving.”
“Perhaps, but you did just sleep through part of your shift, so you have to take some responsibility.”
Only a whimper came.
Sherlock groaned as he woke up with his face pressed against the hard floor.  He rotated his jaw to stretch out the tightness.  What was that buzzing noise?  He felt disgusting.  Slick ran from his hole and he clenched to try to keep it inside.  His face heated with embarrassment, knowing it was already too late and that it was oozing out of him.  John’s knot must have receded if slick could run freely.
“It’s so deep,” John said with reverent amazement.  He shouldn’t have been surprised but his mind still failed to comprehend Sherlock’s thin lithe body wrapped around something so large and long.  John continued to massage the spot, his own arousal growing.
“No one is.”  Sherlock said, his voice sounding sad.
John slowly released Sherlock.  His post orgasmic haze making him move and think slowly.  Holding Sherlock’s hip, he slowly twisted so that they both fell to the side.  Sherlock whimpered as John’s enormous cock shifted with a twitch inside him, making them both pulse and clench.  John moaned in Sherlock’s ear, holding him to his chest.  Sherlock shuddered but remained silent and still.  His hands still secured to the headboard.
“It’s going to be ok.  Just let me look after you.”  John muttered.  It was pleasure he wanted to take charge of now.  He wanted to do this for Sherlock.  He wanted it to be the best fuck he had ever had.  So good that it erased all the others.
“Yeah,” Sherlock said, slightly breathless into his mug of tea.
“You don’t have to.  Just take it.  That’s all you have to do.”  John growled as he sunk his fingers into Sherlock’s hips.  He was in.  He twitched his hips, milking Sherlock’s orgasm.  The orgasm that only made him tighter.  Yet wetter.  The moisture spread now all the way to the base of John’s cock.  It triggered his knot to grow.  John wanted this to last.  He had only been inside a moment.  He did not want to come yet.
“Mrs Hudson left us a note.”  John said around a mouthful of toast with Jam.
He kissed Sherlock deeply as he looped it around his wrists.  “Up on your knees, I think it will be easier on you this way, plus, I want to look at this tight arse as I have my way with you.”
“John, this is nice, but I’m I need you to carry on, quite urgently.”
“I’ll make it good for you this time, that is my promise.”
Sherlock tried to speak, his voice clicking in his throat.  He cleared it.  Tried again, “very much.”
Sherlock looked away.  John took it as admission.
“Did you just get me fired?”  John mumbled warm breath against his neck.
“Can’t move.  I’m dying.”
“I’m trying.”  John promised as he pulled Sherlock’s legs apart further.  He used both thumbs to pull his cheeks apart and he thrust as hard as he dared.
Of course, there is, John thought, reaching for it.
“Are you going to put that...?”
“Are you close?”  John asked.  He was.  It was miraculous to him that he had not come already.
“Good, hu?”
“Oh, god yes!”
“I can get someone else, if you prefer?”
Still hard, despite the orgasm, John fucked as much as his locked knot would allow.  Feeling his huge knot pull on Sherlock’s rim as he stretched it to its limit.  John chased another release into the limp body beneath him.  Chased it until he heard Sherlock keening from the stimulation, chased it until he felt Sherlock go ridged and orgasm without ejaculate under him, chased it until he heard Sherlock whimpering with over sensitivity.  Chased it until he came hard into Sherlock’s Omega body and then collapsed on top of him, pressing them both into a mess of slick and come and sweat.
“I’m an unbonded Omega, I can’t expect any better that that.”
“I’ve got an idea.  Something to keep you open while we rest.”
“He wanted it to hurt.”  Sherlock whispered in a voice so quiet that John could barely hear him.  “He made sure it did.  I think that is why I panicked earlier; brought back some… difficult memories.”
“A very long time.  Years”
“Ready?”
Angled across each shoulder blade four raised scars ran parallel with each other.  John ran his fingers along the length of them.  If he stretched his fingers wide apart, he could followed the lines.
John admired the muscular definition of Sherlock’s back as he got between his spread knees.  The scared lines were more obvious now, but his mind was ruled by other things.  The sight of Sherlock bound and helpless before him fed his Alpha instincts to take.  The simmering lust was gone, replaced with a raging fire.  He was rock hard again, the ring in his cock shifting and as he thickened and throbbed, making the ring feeling tight and obvious as he thought of the tight heat of Sherlock’s body.  The way it had gripped and rippled around him, God, he wanted more.
“This isn’t just going to slide in, Sherlock.”  John stood up, giving Sherlock his first look at his fully naked body.  His cock was jutted straight up.  It was thicker than a wrist and can up past his navel.  The flared head almost purple with desire was adorned with a shining silver ring that threaded through his slit and out the top of the head.  The ring was large enough to drag most men to limp, but John’s sturdy size held it up proudly.
The toy started to move again.  More insistent now.  Sucking and squelching at his opening.  John’s free hand stroking his cock in slow motion as the toy sped up.  Sherlock’s legs were shaking, he couldn’t take a full breath, whether from the toy’s depth or his clenched tight muscles, he did not know.  Coiled tight, right on the edge of orgasm.  The hand moved slower, the toy faster.  If a single braincell had been functioning on any level about animal driven bliss, he would have admired John’s coordination.
“Yep.  Jesus.  I think you have rung me dry.”  Sherlock said in a voice that sounded more even than it should have been.  Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s.  “Felt good.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You did ask.”
“Do you need anything?”  John asked cautiously.
“Hold it in.”  John said, and Sherlock froze; clenched.   He was still all over.  John grabbed Sherlock’s little shorts from the floor.  Pulled them up his long, long legs.  Over his hips and the bulging base of the toy.  Up around Sherlock’s waist.  Sherlock whimpering as he lifted his hips to get his cock inside.  The shorts holding the toy deep, deep inside.
“Up you get.” John encouraged gently as he patted Sherlock’s hip.  As he moved to offer Sherlock a hand up, he noticed for the first time, highlighted in the morning light, a pattern of pale lines crisscrossing Sherlock’s back.  They were so becoming that it took him a moment to realise that they were scars.  Well healed silver lines, but scars, nonetheless.  He was going to mention them when Sherlock interrupted with more urgent demands.
He pushed forwards relentlessly.  His back and arse and thighs taught with effort.  Halfway in, he pulled back.  Thrust in again.  Repeated the movement twice more.  Sherlock was making the most delicious breathless keening noises.
Sherlock tried again to move again.  Bucking against John’s grip in panic, nearly tossing him lose.  The movement and the carnal fight triggered another spurt of ejaculate to throb out of John.  He moaned deeply even as Sherlock shouted in pain.  Even in his bliss, John grabbed him then, pinned him down hard.  Holding his arms against his sides in a crushing hug.  “You have to just take this.  You have no choice now.”
The moment Sherlock’s orgasm finished panic overcame him.  It was too much.  It hurt beyond belief.  His body tried to recoil away from where they were locked together.
Luxuriating in the velvet soft skin that lay over the ridged heat of Sherlock’s long thin cock, John stroked loose fisted in time with his grinding thrusts.  John wished his knot would go down so he could fuck properly.  The sight of Sherlock writhing and whimpering beneath him triggered a desire to pound into him.  He kept stroking languid and long.  Slow.  He pressed forward, deep.  Leaning in.  Kissing, nipping.  Breathing in Sherlock’s gasping little breaths as he thrust harder.  Barely pulling back.  Just driving, driving, driving forward.  Trying to climb inside.
“They are making you crazy.”  Sherlock felt as if his heart stopped.  He turned his face into the pillows.  He wished John had not asked.  It hurt to reject him, but he knew that John was just consumed by his rut.
“Do you trust me?”  Johns asked.
“I’m not working today.  I’m allowed to sleep.  Don’t worry; your job was dull anyway, plus, you have other responsibilities right now.”
“Doctor John Watson’s phone.”  Sherlock answered, his voice hoarse.
“Bare down.  Last bit.”
Sherlock looked away.  Nodded once.
“Not really.”  Sherlock’s voice hollow and far away.
Had they bonded?
Sherlock muttered sounds of pleasure that John could not understand.  John pressed deeper so he could massage the bump.  He loved seeing Sherlock like this.  Sherlock’s cock jumped against his belly making a wet slapping sound.  John pressed in further.  His forearm sinking into Sherlock’s body.
“How does it feel?”  John asked, knowing the answer but wanting to hear Sherlock say it.
“What?  Why?  Sherlock, that’s really dangerous.”
Cupping a hand behind Sherlock’s neck to support him, he laid him back against the mattress.  John stroked over his body.  His rough hands making Sherlock squirm and sigh.
John thrust a bit deeper feeling Sherlock’s body fight it every moment.  His cock ached to be inside.  John palmed Sherlock’s stomach, just so that he could feel himself, just so he could wrap himself possessively closer, just so he could take a drag of that intoxicating scent.  It felt spectacular.  He tried to thrust, but Sherlock’s body continued to deny him.
John was nearly mad with the Alpha drive to claim his Omega.  The constricting warmth of Sherlock’s body drove him on.  He could not believe he was inside him.  Him of all people.  And that body.  Tight and lith.  It was like fucking a virgin.  He could see the muscle ripple with every thrust and when he placed a hand on Sherlock’s belly he could feel as his cock passed under the slim layers of muscle and skin.  The ring in his cockhead tugged as he pulled out supplying a stimulation only possible by being deep within someone.  He tried to set a steady pace but as he got to the base of his cock each time his hips snapped forward without his permission.  He could hear it as his dick punched the breath out of Sherlock’s lungs.  On every inward thrust the ring sunk deeper into his cock.  It was like Sherlock was fucking his cock with his insides.  That thought triggered his knot and on the next thrust he could not sink in as deep.  He growled with frustration as Sherlock’s body held him at bay.
Sherlock whimpered at the stretched-out feeling; not sure he could take much more of the wound tight pleasure he was receiving.  His thighs shook, his hands gripped at his own hair as John took his throbbing cock in hand.
“Yes, alright.  You don’t have to overdo it.”
“Good.  Keep going.  More.”
What was the bloody noise?
Sherlock gasped with the last of his breath as John bottomed out.  The intensity was overwhelming.  No pain, just slick pressure in all the right places.  His body glowing with warmth from the inside out as John came hard.  The twitches inside him could be felt all the way to their tangled fingers.  The flood of warmth triggered Sherlock’s second orgasm making his body constrict around the knot inside him.  John’s knot grew more.  Animal instinct making them both lose composure to thrust and grind through their shared climax.  It was an ecstasy that would not have been believed if it had not been collective.
