“I’ll catch you later Cas.” He started to walk back to Benny.
He was ready for whatever Gordon to going to throw at him. He needed to get away from this drowning feeling, this cold numbness he found himself slipping into. Ripping Gordon’s face in half would help with that. Anger would put a fire in Dean he needed. Gordon was in on drug charges, wasn’t like killing people was part of his job, unlike Dean.
“I don’t let people in Cas, and I let you in and when you broke the kiss, I freaked that you didn’t…anyway I guess it doesn’t matter because you do. That’s that you’re saying right?”
The Russian pulled his finger out and Dean followed. A hand appeared under his chin, palm up and Dean raised a brow at what Cas was insinuating till it clicked. Spit, right. A trip to commissary was going to be needed, spit would have to do for now. Dean pulled his inner cheeks between his teeth and gathered what he could in his mouth dropping into Cas’ hand. The Russian did the same then smoothed it over his erection.
“No shit,” Dean said, a yawn came out of him. “Now hush and let me nap till dinner.”
“Snachala ya avtoritet, potom tvoy drug. Ne zabud' etogo.”
He watched Dean grip the bedsheets beside him. “Shut your mouth Novak.” He huffed weakly, there was no fight in that response.
“You stole my phone,” Castiel shrugs. He needs to not look at Dean’s mouth for a moment, he’s too fixated on it for his own good, a moment of weakness on their date when he swiped ice cream off of it not really thinking, just acting. Dean’s face went as red as the stop sign, they were standing under.
Cas moved his mouth back up to Dean’s mouth, planting kisses as he went because Cas apparently liked to be cute in the heat of the moment. “Hmm, I had my doubts, but this…” Cas pushed in further making Dean whine when he found that sweet spot. “…this is better than anything I could have imagined. So needy, so eager…” he stroked it again and again watching Dean fall apart at the seams on the desk.
Sam and Jess come to visit him when he’s about to go on his lunch break. He’s still under the same car trying to figure out what the problem with it is. Sam kicks him in his ankle to tell him he’s there. Dean curses, hits his head on the under carriage.
“Tomorrow? What’s happening tomorrow?” he asked. Cas looked up at Dean. Face not giving anything away. “C’mon
(See the end of the chapter for
“What the hell was that back there?” he asked, hands firm on his hips.
“It aint over yet,” he bounced his brows suggestively. “Three more days and we are making the most of it.”
The following night felt a little like déjà vu. He fiddled with his laptop, setting it up, making sure the angles were right for their next keepsake. The money was a mere added bonus at this stage for Cas when it came to their porn account. He hadn’t expected Dean to be the one to ask for this moment to be broadcasted to their viewers.
Cas is beside him, turning on the tap to let the cold water run. Dean pulls away the cloth revealing his hand. There is too much blood to see the damage. Cas takes Dean’s wrist lightly and guides it under the water. The impact makes Dean wince in pain. He inhales sharp through his teeth. “Is it bad?” he asks not wanting to look.
“I had a bad dream.” She mumbled.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was boneless, unable to move from what happened apart from reaching across to put his hand on Cas’ chest to have some kind of contact with the man who fucked him five ways from Sunday. Cas put his hand over Dean’s equally unable to move or comprehend what went on. The only sound in the room was gasping breathes.
He pleaded with Cas, coaxing the man to put his hand back under his top, to touch his skin and take Gordon away from him. He stripped his coat and top, showing Cas his wounds.
“Word on the street is Dean’s protected, got himself a Russian Daddy.” He said. That got Dean’s attention. He snapped his head over to Rufus. The others were looking at Dean confused. He hadn’t told them what happened yesterday, the less people knew the better. He didn’t need Sam worrying, didn’t need Charlie giving him sympathy. He wanted to forget it ever happened. The AB clearly had other motives, spreading around that Cas saved Dean from a gang bang.
“It takes a lot to piss off Dean, what did you do key his baby?”
When Cas answered Dean felt a bit of stage fright. He wasn’t as drunk as he had been last time, partly because he had to drive to and from the date and dropping off Charlie, so he didn’t have any whiskey. Whiskey usually helped him feel freer and more relaxed.
Castiel returns to responding to emails, helping out the students seems less painful now.
Some Sam POV in this chapter too just fyi x
“What are you studying Sam?” Cas asks.
“Who’s going to stop me?”
Dean puts it upon himself to figure out a pet name for Cas because well, Cas isn’t entirely sure the reason why, but Dean tries none the less. They’re in bed, post orgasms and Cas is smearing Dean’s cum on his stomach, making patterns and enjoying his afterglow while Dean rambles on above him.
“Let’s see what you picked then.” he said. She pointed to the galaxy poster paint set, fully equipped with intergalactic paint brushes. Metallics paint, glitter paints, the whole nine yards for ages 5+. Claire was four, close enough. He took it off the shelf and handed it to his daughter to hold. She liked holding things. Dean didn’t.
Dean needed to make this count, needed to make a statement. He looked in the crowd searching. “Him,” Dean pointed to Cas who had joined the group. “He gave the order.”
“Will you kiss me?” Cas whispers, like he’s afraid Dean will say no. They’ve done so much to each other, with each other and yet this act has escaped them till now.
“I posted the video by the way.”
“Cas – I gotta go.” He said between kisses.
The yelp comes first then the phone drops into Castiel’s hand.
He broke. They knew he would, and he did, two and a half months he lasted.
Some memories are being pieced together in his mind, Dean carrying him to his car, a hand in his hair, something about burritos that he will make sure to eat at some point today if he gets the chance to. There is a Mexican place near his apartment, not as good as the truck at college but would suffice to fill his craving.
“What are you – oh fuck..”
“Hey Cas?” Dean whispered.
“Never been this close to another dude’s dick before.” Dean said with a slight chuckle. His breathe drifted to Cas’ cock, making it twitch on its own accord. Shit.
He went to the bathroom, soaking a cloth in hot water then went to get a cold glass of water, knowing he’d need these for later. His insides simmering with desire at the sounds of Dean undressing in his room, the bed springs compressing and the audibly heavy sigh of the man occupying it. He wouldn't have thought in a million years that this would be how things unfolded for them, how one simple need to pay the heating bill had sparked this between them. How they went from watching movie marathons to Dean waiting patiently for Cas on his bed, ready to receive a sexual punishment and
When the Russian came back, he was mid conversation with Balthazar.
Dean takes his hands, bringing them down. “Trust me.”
He mulls over Dean’s question. Yes, he’s asking for this. All he does is take from Dean and Dean allows it. His thumb moves to Dean’s mouth, runs the pad of it under his bottom lip. He can see it drying. He takes so much but for this he wants Dean to want it too. Not to want it after it happens, or during it, he wants Dean to want it before it even begins.
“You promised me you weren’t going anywhere.” He hears Cas mutter. He sighs, scratches the back of his neck debating this in his mind. Cas is drunk, really drunk but there is something else that seems to be going on with his neighbor too. That thousand-mile stare, that heaviness in his heart that’s exposed and he’s wearing on his sleeve since his friends left the bar.
“As long as you’re sure.”
“Spring rolls! I know!” he called back and closed the door.
And this is why Dean does not leave the bar. He plants the drinks down in front of the strangers debating what kind of response to give the leery eyed dick. The man takes the red wine and inhales it, eyes still on Dean.
“The dark,” she explained like it was obvious. “When I’m scared my Daddy holds my hand.”
The decision for mutual orgasms during lock in time was hands down one the best decisions Dean had made since landing himself in Purgatory. Cas had an insatiable appetite, one that Dean was more than willing to keep up with seeing as the Russian tore orgasms out of Dean like no one else could including out in the real world. It was like his celly was made for him, sent by some sex God with a sole mission on making Dean cum at least once a day.
“Right, yeah, see thing is I’m not really much of a baker and…”
Cas followed his brother and Dean followed in tow, walking into the kitchen/dining room that had more adults in it. Some from the pre-school, some Dean didn’t recognise before. For a short notice birthday party, there was a decent turn out. Seven or so kids were running around high on sugar and life. Dean spotted the table that had the sugar on it and like a magnet he was pulled, hand reaching a sugary donut and inhaling it in two bites. It was glorious. Dean noticed the birthday cake too, it was shimmering in gold glitter, explained why Cas had it on him yesterday.
Cas moved, moved with every muscle he possessed building up momentum till he was fucking Dean with enough force the bedhead started to hit the wall behind it. Dean held on tight as Cas drove himself into Dean, each thrust a new noise escaped him, noises he didn’t even know he could make, too fucked to care what he sounded like, whatever it was Cas seemed to appreciate them.
“You can ask. Doesn’t mean I will answer.” He attempts a joke, trying to lighten the mood. Dean thinks he’s serious for a moment then notices Castiel’s smile around his coffee mug.
“Thanks.” he wiped off the sugar that landed on his shirt.
“Apologies,” Castiel replies taking the pies from his hands. He opens them to check what kind of pies they are. Gabriel presses an indent of the fruit inside the pies onto the pastry crust. “Two cherry?” he checks. The customer nods.
“Winchester.” A guard called out. Sam stepped away. He ran his hand over his hair that had fallen from behind his ear. His brother looked worse for wear, about as bad as Dean looked if he was being honest and his brother hadn’t spent the guts of three months in the Empty. His eyes sunken into his head, bags as big as trash bags and bruises on his neck, not bruises, love bites.
Cas went into the hall, eyes glued to the back of Dean as he climbed the steps. He followed closely behind, careful not to be caught, not yet. They paused in front of one of the bedrooms, testing to see if it was open. It was. She reached up to kiss Dean again and that was quite enough for one night. Cas put his hand on the girl’s shoulder.
“Something about a history project, ringing any bells?”
“You’re asking me to jump off a cliff and trust you’ll catch me at the bottom.”
“Damn machines.” He mumbles. He shifts his head on Cas’ shoulder, needs to turn his body towards Cas more to get more comfortable, not too comfortable. The urge to just turn his whole body and bury his head in Cas’ neck is there simmering underneath his skin.
As the days passed Dean kept to himself, kept his head down. Charlie and Sam bought him a chocolate bar for being two months out of the Empty. They earned more than he did so a chocolate bar wasn’t much to them, but it was everything to Dean. He earned next to nothing in his work detail. The sacrifice he made so he could at least be outdoors more than the rest of them.
“Hello? Earth to Dean?” Charlie waved his hand in front of Dean’s face. He tore his eyes away. “You hearing me in there?”
“Appreciate it.”
“You serious?” he has to double check.
PSA - Way more dom/sub vibes happening in this chapter.
They got to the end this time.
And truly he was safe.
Christ, it was good, so good.
He wanted Cas loud tonight. He’d make him loud, make him feel good. It was all he wanted.
Dean didn’t stop shouting till his voice broke, till his throat burned and his chest heaved. He punched the wall till both his hands were covered in blood, the adrenaline coursed through him keeping the drowning away. He knew it would come, inevitably it could come, and he would drown in it.
“Yeah, why?”
Dean nodded. A sly smile made its way to his face. “Like you wouldn’t believe."
“Trust me, I aint that easily scared.” Dean smiled wickedly.
Admittedly the replaying of Dean’s sex filled moans were what got Cas through his days. He tended to stay at the back of the class, stare out of the window or doodle in the margins of the paper. Daydreams of pretty green eyes and how his mouth felt full of Dean were hard not to slip into. He wasn’t entirely sure where this newfound interest in Dean had come from, but it was there, and he couldn’t shake it away.
Dean didn’t know what to do about it because what Cas asked of him was too much and yet he knew they couldn’t go back to the way things were, not after those kinds of declarations. He really wished it never happened. That they could go back in time and live in denial till they were out of Purgatory.
So yeah, he’s in a good mood and screw Bobby for trying to ruin it on him.
Dean was back in the cell before Cas this time, rare enough thing to happen. Sitting at the desk they shared staring a piece of paper for the last ten minutes trying to figure out what to write on it. So far, he had,
Cas let him indulge for a few seconds more before swatting his hand away. He went for his buckle and jutted his chin towards Dean.
He took that as a yes.
“You wanna taste?”
His friend didn’t move for what felt like a year, kneeling between Dean’s knees, sitting on his calves with his hands and arms on Dean’s body. It was driving Dean up the wall, his aching cock lying on his stomach, pink and throbbing and dying to be touched, dying for the release that Cas wasn’t giving him.
Cas wakes Dean up.
“You’re tired.” Cas noted, sitting on the edge of the bed.
Dean opened the message back up again to study it. Only one thing came to his mind.
“That needy eh?
?” Sam punctuated the last three words insinuating something. Crap, the Angel Grace, he completely forgot to ask about it.
“Alright, here we go!” Gabriel came into view, salt, tequila and lime wedges in his hands. Cas moved in closer to see how this all unfolded. He watched Gabriel sprinkle a line of salt from the waist of her jeans to her bellybutton, then pour some tequila into her bellybutton which had her squirming a little so two guys took it upon themselves to hold her still and finally he placed a wedge of lime in her mouth. “Who’s going to be the first one to sample our beautiful Bella right here?”
“You good buddy?” Dean asked, hoping his friend wasn’t freaking out or maybe hoping he was freaking out because Dean kinda was.
He nods his head, brushing his face against the soft fabric of Cas’ shirt too embarrassed to say it out loud.
The Roadhouse is quiet for a Saturday night. There is a line of people at the bar but there tends to be two and three lines of people behind that line on a typical Saturday. Must be down to it being the weekend before mid-terms and every student in the area is actually taking their degrees serious for once. He might even be able to clock off early if Ellen’s in a good mood, they don’t need three of them behind here and Ellen on the floor till closing.
Dean nodded his head enthusiastically.
“Ehhh,” shit shit abort abort. “G’night Cas.”
to fuck you right?” Dean asked, grabbing a pillow and manhandling Cas again, getting his hips up to shove a pillow under him and Cas didn’t do anything to object, more stunned than anything at Dean’s newfound confidence.
“Yes Dean?”
A group had surrounded them, eager to watch the bloodshed. This was the plan, Cas’ big plan to fix Dean’s problem. He was setting up a fight for Dean to remind those in Purgatory who he was and with the baddest of the bad in here, the Russians.
“Yeah, we’ll see about that short stack.” Dean joked. Charlie dealt him and Sam the cards. They played a few hands of blackjack, some rummy and even a go fish to spice things up and it was good. Normal, almost.
It was harder this time to do that. The other times he managed fine, perhaps as this was the first time, he had come he was finding it more difficult to return. He wondered if Dean had this difficulty after he came. The difficulty not to grab his friend and bring him in close, bring him over the edge that he brought Cas.
As much as he instigated this frottage, he was slowly falling apart at the seams from it.
“Someone new.” He fastened his boot, pulled the jean over them and stood up to give himself a once over in the mirror. A shave wouldn’t have gone a miss, too late now though he didn’t wanna be late even if that tended to be how Cas and Dean operated as Dads, perpetually late to everything.
His precum wasn’t enough though, not enough to avoid a chaffed rub out. Cas knew that and licked his palm to help him. It was obscene and Dean saved it to his memory wank bank. Cas’ spit covered hand now back on Dean’s cock and jerking him off with a confident steady pace. All Dean could do was hold on for dear life and pray he kept his mouth shut. Cas did anything but kept his mouth shut. It’s like the silent, brooding Russian enjoyed not only ruining Dean with his hand and mouth, no, the sick fuck liked to use his words too.
“I aint your god damn boy either.” He snarled. Rufus’ chest puffed out. Behind him the Folk Nation were all watching, gearing up to come over here.
He actually thought Cas might have wanted that too or wanted
He got close to the end, right up to the point where Cas was slamming into the guy so hard that the bathroom stall wall had begun to move so he wrapped a hand around the guy’s chest to hold him back off it and that had Dean cumming harder than when he got a blowjob the other day and it was just by Cas’ voice alone. Just that image of Cas being strong enough to hold Dean up, still fuck him and jack him off while Dean melted in his chest, probably whispering sweet nothings in his ear the entire time.
Cas looked at his hand. Dean did too. The devil with the sharp teeth. A circle with a dot on the inside on one of his fingers.
– I want,
He managed to get to the end of the stairs when Cas pulled him back, pressing up against a wall and locking him in place with his forearm on his chest. “Don’t walk away from me Dean,” his voice angry and set. “You don’t get to walk away from me.”
Cas now.”
“You wanna chill with me and Sam?”
He stuffed the cloth back into his overalls. It was coming on 12:45. He needed to get going if he was going to make it to Cas’ work on time.
His jealousy was unwarranted. He didn’t own Dean. He didn’t have a claim on him. Dean was a freeman to do what he wished and that should include sucking tequila out of some girl’s belly button. Dean licked the strip of salt off her stomach, tongue darting out to lap at the tequila and when he went to take the lime from her mouth the girl spat it out and caught his face kissing him deeply in front of everyone.
He started to protest as Cas pulled his finger out, hips rising to chase it, not wanting to feel empty. Cas’ quiet groan spurred him on, rising up on all fours, presenting himself to Cas for more. It didn’t take long before Cas’ finger was back inside, and Dean preened at it.
“I gave him a bunch of quarters.” Cas replied, staring at how tight Dean had his wrist, almost white knuckling it, losing some circulation in it. He knew Dean was strong, but this level was unexpected. “You’re strong.”
Another nod.
He could lie to his brother, his brother who was a lawyer and would probably smell the lie a mile away or he could tell the truth to his brother, his brother who was a lawyer and would probably have a listen to a five minute argument on how much of a bad idea it was to sleep with your kid’s best friend’s Dad. His options weren’t great.
“I wasn’t born under a rock. I know about Stonewall, I just didn’t know
He shook his head again. He felt weak, pathetic. All he wanted was to be with Cas and yet his stupid brain stopped him, his anxiety holding him back from something great, something amazing. Cas deserved to be with someone who was brave like his Mom said, someone who cared enough to be with him no matter the judgements. He wasn’t that but he hoped he could be one day. If Cas waited a little longer for him. He would try.
The Fete was a decent enough gig actually much to Dean’s demise about going to it. There was knick-knack for sale, craft stuff, things for Thanksgiving and Christmas, stuff adults made, and stuff the kids made. Charlie’s class had the bake-sale. He spotted the brownies Cas made among them, selling quick. Ms. Oak even admired how the single Dads got together to do it. It was about as patronizing as it sounded. He didn’t attempt to mingle, just stuck to Cas’ side and Cas did the same, not attempting much conversation with people unless they came up to them. Some did to say how good the brownies were and how the M&M’s were a good addition.
Dean knew Shurley was talking to them. He looked at the warden, his thick beard hiding his lips that were moving, his red blazer contrasting with the painfully bright white walls behind him. He knew he was talking but he couldn’t hear him, like Dean was under water, the words were distant and muddled in his brain.
“They looked like wings?”
Charlie waved the present in her arms. Dean could see her through his rear-view mirror. He hopped out of the car and plucked Charlie from her seat, present still in hands, wrapped horribly but Charlie insisted on doing it herself. It was covered, that was a good enough base line to go off of. She wrote in the card too, again a four-year-old could only write so much, mainly Charlie worked in symbols and hieroglyphics.
He let go of Dean, heading towards the kitchen to do his job he was now late for.
“Good morning Dean.”
The bright white light flashed in again. Cas tensed. Dean brought him in closer.
He cast a suspicious look over to his friend. “You’re just talking out of your ass Benny, aren’t ya?”
cliffhanger? kinda? sorry!
Cas took Dean’s hand off of him so he could turn Dean around, pushing him over the back of the couch. He shoved Dean’s jeans and boxers down in one go, pooling them at his ankles.
“See you never Winchester.” The guard smiled.
“I could show you,” He reaches out to touch Dean’s chest, a flat palm resting over a slightly faded tattoo. He smirks at the bodily reaction Dean has. He worries when Dean’s eyes shut, unsure if it’s to revel in his touch or Dean working at the auto-shop then a shift at the Roadhouse. “If you’re not too tired that is.” He brushes his hand over Dean’s peck, catching his nipple with his movement.
“You take it black?” Cas took a mug from his cupboard, poured in some coffee from the machine and handed it to Dean. Dean took a sip. It was high quality coffee, none of that instant cheap stuff that Dean had stored away in his cupboard. This stuff was like cocaine, pure and Columbian. He hummed as his mouth filled with the smoothness of it. Dean took another sip and closed his eyes to let himself savour every aroma.
Dean grew restless, pulling at the label of his beer and channel hopping, not really taking anything in, just flashes of images. A thousand channels and nothing on, nothing that he wanted. He knew what he wanted. Unfortunately, what he wanted was late.
“You offering?” Dean asked, smirk plastered on his face.
Cas got down on his knees, hands moving up Dean’s legs as before sending shivers down his spine. He widened his legs, let his friend slot in between them. Hand moving away, to let Cas take over with that sure movement palming over his erection. Dean sighed, relaxing further into the cushions, knowing what was going to come, knowing Cas was going to take care of him.
Dean takes in their surroundings. It’s not private. He brings Cas back into the art room, closes the door behind him and then wraps his arms around Cas in a tight embrace.
Zachariah stepped in.  “You must have a guardian angel Winchester because I honestly have no idea how you’ve managed to wrangle your way out of this place,
Dean brought himself to the moment fully, forgetting fantasies and distractions. He let his arousal wash over him, feeling the tingles he had been forcing down to come up and scatter over his body. He sank further into the bed, feeling the sheets encase him. They smelled like Cas, that tea tree body wash he liked using. When Cas took his other hand to fondle Dean’s balls Dean’s stomach clenched again and his hands grabbed fists of the duvet beside him.
The revolving door to Cas’ building spun and out walked Cas in his suit and tie, trench coat billowing in the wind behind him. God could that man pull off a suit. His brain swarmed with what happened yesterday, how warm Cas’ mouth felt, how he held Dean’s thighs down to stop him from bucking up into it, that strength Dean wanted to see more of and hopefully he would if this was going to go the way he wanted it.
This close Dean could just about make out the scars on his stomach, noticed what looked like a bullet wound breaking up the ink in his tattoo.
Hands found their way to Dean’s waist, pushing him back into the countertop and Dean went, always would go where Cas wanted him to be. The man pressed himself close to Dean’s chest, hands grounding them in this stolen moment while their kids slept across the hall. His wet hand moved back, getting a grip of Cas’ hair to tilt his head, deepening the kiss some more, wanting more, wanting to taste Cas if he’d just…
“They’re going to kill each other Dean.” Sam gripped his shoulder to get his attention.
There might be an epilogue from Cas' POV but don't wait out for it.
“Not someone you give rules to Dean.” The guy had been sitting on his name the whole time and never mentioned it. Another power play, a damn good one too seeing as Dean knew next to none about this guy except, he thought Dean had a pretty mouth, whether objectively or subjectively was yet to be decided and most likely part of the Russian gang if not the head of it.
“Charlie! Dammit.” he ran up after her. He was too late. Cas had already opened the door and she swooped in under his arm.
Cas slipped his fingers into the waistband of Dean’s boxers. He lifted his hips on instinct, careful not to look down, keeping his eyes glued to the darkness above him. The fabric moved over his dick, causing another stir in him and then Cas discarded them leaving Dean naked on his bed.
,” Cas moved his hand up to Dean’s jaw to get a hold of it. “And put my cock in this pretty mouth.” He started to tug Dean’s head down. This wasn’t happening. This can’t be happening. Cas wouldn’t do this to Dean. He never does this to Dean. Cas never wanted Dean to do this kind of thing unless Dean wanted it to even though he technically
“Hey guys.” He beamed an actual smile at them. Dean hadn’t seen Sam smile that bright in over a year he wanted to say.
He shot a glare to his friend. Complying to the slight order and relaxed more into the covers, hands reaching down to free himself from his boxers. His semi-erect penis flopped to the side and for a moment he thought he could hear Dean gasp though it appeared to have just been a cough. He let his own gasp out as he stroked himself hard. Careful to not get too carried away with his arousal however enough for Dean to not have to work too hard to get Cas cumming.
Cas sipped his drink, eyes locked on Dean’s. “I can be if you want me to be.”
He seriously needed to talk to Sam.
“You have, it’s the place where I got the food from when it was my turn to apologies.”
Twenty minutes later and they’ve set up similar to before, dimly lit from the laptop screen though this time they’ve added the light from Dean’s room too, just slightly ajar. It added another dimension apparently, whatever the hell that meant. He let Cas do this thing and didn’t ask questions. All Dean had to do was be loud, oh and cum again, can’t forget the cumming. They had a couple of whiskeys as they went along too, wanting to keep their level of intoxication intact.
Charlie nudged him. “Oh? And how long have we been sitting on that nugget of information?”
Kevin hears what had happened through Gabriel because Gabriel doesn’t understand that when Castiel says it was “one of the most embarrassing moments of his life” it means he didn’t want other people to know. Kevin, a second-year student at the college but not in his classes (Kevin was in theology and math) took pity on him and accidently drops a tray of dark chocolate chip cookies. They just so happen to be Castiel’s favourite.
“Last night wasn’t about me.”
“What were you sniggering about?” Dean asked, voice hazy.
The thumb nail was Cas’ hand over Dean’s boxers. What a tease Mr. Novak, not even letting the good people get a look see at the goods. He settled himself back further onto his bed, sitting horizontal with his back against the wall, laptop in lap and beer between legs. Dean hovered his fingers over the mouse pad, to click or not to click. Fuck it, he wanted to see it.
He needed to play it cool for now though. “It’s nothing,” he untied his shirt to put it back on, not wanting the bruises to be on show. He’d see them later, probably touch them and jack off to them but right now the last thing he needed was people asking questions he didn’t want to answer in public.
If he could get one of those adjectives down, the one of hunger he hopes Dean will let him talk. Dean wipes his face with the napkin the diner supplied to Castiel and takes a swig of his beer. It’s hard not to notice the way his lips seal around the bottom, how his throat gulps tensing the muscles there. Castiel needs to stop being distracted.
When the sun comes down, he’s sitting with the box of cookies in his lap debating which one to try first and music starts playing from next door. Loud music, loud enough that Castiel can hear the lyrics through the walls.
The feeding him, letting him sleep in his apartment, on him, and relentless attention Cas gave him like he wants to slowly unravel Dean piece by piece each time Cas looks at him. Dean played into it all, hook, line and sinker. Is Dean supposed to interpret
I've added light angst to the tag because Cas is being a bit angsty in this chapter.
The look of pure joy on Cas’ face made Dean’s heart swell. If this was what he looked like from just being able to wear one of Dean’s tops in public, what would he look like when Dean held his hand?
“Hardly Dean,” Cas replied. “A couple of thousand views does not equate to…”
Cas perked up at that, the regret being placed by intrigue. His blue eyes squinted like he wasn’t buying what Dean was selling. He took his feet off the table, planted them on the ground in front of Cas and leaned over to really sell it. From this close Dean could see the depths of the blue in Cas’ eyes, like an abyss. He could easily fall into and never come out. If only they hadn’t known each other in here and Dean could show Cas who he really was.
Dean let his head drop to Cas’ thigh again, trying to get his breath back after yet another earth quaking encounter with his celly. His brain came back to his body slowly, slower than usual. Lines had been crossed, one being his mouth on Cas’ dick, the other being that Dean still hadn’t gotten up off of Cas’ body. Truth of it was that he didn’t want to, he hated the part after it when they separated, like he was just being used and not wanted.
“You know Castiel would...”
He was still hesitant leaving Cas, he wanted to stay, he wanted to talk about what just happened, where do they go from here, was this about to change everything. He dragged his feet towards the door to where Cas was with his hand on the handle ready to open it up.
“Whoa, you guys made quick work of that bottle.” A familiar voice approaches. He looks up and sees Dean. He’s got bright eyes, not as bright as they could be either. Castiel needs to know why. What happened to Dean for his eyes not to be as bright. He sees glimpses of it, when he’s around his brother or teasing Castiel. In those moments the green is lighter, letting the goodness in and embracing it.
Dean sighed. “That obvious huh?”
Those words echo for Castiel, words he has told himself over the years since leaving Heaven’s Little Angel’s. “I share that sentiment.” Castiel agrees. He gives Dean’s hand a light squeeze to show he hears him and lets it go.
Gabriel is in the flows of a conversation with two other people. A man, tall, lanky with fair hair. The woman, pale, thick red locks cascading down her back. They all look up as Dean approaches. Cas sits down on the spare seat, handing Gabriel the rum and orange.
His strength sent a rush through Cas. He’d be able to hold Cas down, keep him down, even if Cas put him a bit of a fight. That would be everything but for now he needed to just get his hands on him, make him cum, make whatever was going on in him go away. He pressed against Dean’s chest again and this time Dean went. There was no resistance which made Cas realise this was the right idea to have.
“Word is, he got jumped in the showers by the AB.”
Dean looked down at himself. He had showered, styled his hair a bit more than usual and was wearing a charcoal shirt with his least raggedy pair of jeans.
He doesn’t even know if Dean is attracted men. Castiel thinks probably not, Dean’s a mechanic then he feels guilty for having such stereotypical hetero thoughts considering he himself is gay. It wasn’t like people go around with it written on their lapels what they are into. It’s hard to gauge, especially for Castiel. He’s not good with people in real life. Books, stories, words he can relate to people there. Outside of those pages he seems far removed from them. His sheltered up bringing he attempted to blame for it. Gabriel ruined that hypothesis. He could understand people like he understood sugar.
Cas responded in an eye roll and made a point of telling everyone he made them, not Dean out of retaliation. It was fun enough with him around, most of the parenting things were if Dean admitted it. It kind of felt like they were the outcasts and content being them. They both left when they deemed it was an acceptable time, sneaking away before Ms. Oak roped them into something.
Dean kissed Cas, pressed his lips against Cas’ chapped ones and then Cas was kissing Dean back. Kissing him back hard. Hands that had been used to kill Gordon reached around Dean’s waist pulling him in closer till their chests hit and it hurt Dean, but he didn’t care about the pain because Cas was attacking Dean’s mouth with all he had, and it was everything. Frantic and chaotic but sure and smooth just like every contradiction the Russian was to Dean. His lips moistened against Dean’s and when his hand moved back to tug at Cas’ hair it made the Russian gasp and Dean took the opening to slide his tongue in. He was rewarded with a groan and the pure filth of it sent a shockwave through his body.
Cas didn’t argue with that.
Everyone's on board with the sexy times though, just alcohol and lack of verbal consent make it dubious IMO.
doubt that compadre of mine is being hipster, you have met the guy, right? Bout this tall, crow’s nest hair, bit emo? Ring any bells?”
“You’re going to have to act like mine if you want people out there to believe it.”
Dean returned to reality. “Huh?”
He chuckled at his phone, imagining Dean furiously typing that in the middle of the grocery store he stood in. The pepperoni pizza incident brought him endless humour, refusing to let it go merely due to the fact that it riled his friend up so much.
Memories of before last night are also roaming around in his mind, nights spent shivering under the thin blankets of the orphanage as the rain dripped in through the faulty window beside Castiel’s bed. A flashback of Balthazar mentioning Heaven’s Little Angels comes into his mind, Dean is in it. He must have heard. He wonders if Dean will bring it up. Wonder if he should be the one to bring it up. He is unsure if he wants to dredge up those memories, left them in a box buried in his mind for a reason.
“Any time today Mr. Novak.” Ms. Oak pressed. Cas rolled his eyes, sighing audibly.
“Dean.” Cas said with a slight surprise.
Cas went back to the page he had been reading. “Sort of.”
“Maybe I’m the dumbass.” He hears Dean say under his breath.
“Wasn’t what I was going for,” he licked his lips, enjoying what he was seeing. Cas was lean, the light from the en-suite casting shadows on his chest and stomach. “But this is, yeah…” Words escaped him as his hand reached out to touch the hair under his naval, dark and trailing down under his jeans. He noticed the bulge in his eye line, clearly, he wasn’t the only one in here getting hard from some frantic making out.
Dean had spent the first six months here establishing some sort of a reputation for not taking shit like that from anyone, the lewd looks, the comments, the casual groping, before, if any of them even tried it they’d get what was coming to them. Now all he could do was keep his head down, bury that rage inside of him and try not to lash out. There were cameras in the common areas if he did anything Shurley would know, he couldn’t hide.
This man was trying to kill Dean. He was totally trying to kill him.
He was nothing but a petty thieve to begin with, he had to work his way up the chain of command, prove himself and he did. The tattoos were symbols of his status, each one earned in blood or service. He met Gabriel along the way, the Pakhan’s youngest brother, they were of similar age and grew to be brothers. Eventually they were both sent to America to help out the Pakhan’s sister, Anna. She was head of the Bratva over here.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I could ask you the same thing,” he crowded into Dean’s space, hands reaching into Dean’s back pockets to tug him close. Dean gasped, his own hands reaching for Cas’ shirt to hold onto something. “What were you exactly planning on doing with her?"
Dean did what promised. He tried. From that morning at his parent’s house, letting Cas keep his t-shirt on all the way up to embracing him in a heated drunken kiss outside a jazz club in the French quarter in New Orleans. They cheer and shouts from onlookers seemed to only encourage Dean more and since then he’d been more open with his affections.
“I know that man. That doesn’t mean that others can’t say thank you for it. He was a murdering psychopath, probably a rapist too who fucked up a lot of people’s lives. They’re grateful you did something that our shitty justice system wouldn’t.” He tried to explain. He folded up the piece of paper, put it in his drawer for safe keeping.
When he got off the bed to turn out the light, he heard Dean call out his name, like he was scared Cas was going to go somewhere. He slid back in to wrap his arm around Dean, keeping him close, careful of sub-dropping. That had been a lot for Dean and he took it so well, Cas couldn't have asked for anything more.
“Fuck.” He curses dropping for the second time that shift another glass. Ash sees what happens and rushes to his side. The bar is heaving but Ash doesn’t care, one down, they’re all down.
“Everything ok lev?” Cas asked Dean pretending Gordon wasn’t even there. He ran his nose down the length of Dean’s neck, planted a kiss behind his ear. Admittedly it made Dean’s hair stand on edge from the gesture and it made his breath hitch when Cas slipped his hand up Dean’s shirt just an inch to get at his skin there.
Claire’s other parent was a Dad. Interesting. Suddenly Dean’s fantasies didn’t seem to unrealistic. Nope, he needed to avert back to general sex talk about other people. He couldn’t engage in these thoughts until safe inside the confines of the bedroom. Thoughts that Cas
"And neither of us could really deny it." Dean finished.
“What? This isn’t what you wanted?” Dean whispered in his ear. “An out and out boyfriend? Look, here I am, out in broad daylight about to get you off. Thought you wanted this Cas."
They parted ways, Cas taking Claire down the street and Dean taking Charlie into the playground to exert some energy. Dean needed to exert some too. His heart jumping too quick for his liking from just being within breathing space with Cas. What would happen if he actually hugged the guy? Have a heart attack and die at the ripe old age of 32? He needed to cool his jets before spending an entire afternoon at the guy’s house. Hopefully an hour or two in the park will knock Charlie out and she’ll be in bed by 8pm and Dean can hide himself in his room and bust a nut, or two just to be on the safe side.
Cas was still at Dean’s phone when he sat back down, looking like he was enjoying himself. The slight devious smirk letting Dean know he was up to no good.
Dean didn’t need to be told twice. The whiskey mixed with Cas’ voice was tearing down all his inhibitions. He reached in to touch himself, letting out a slow moan as he got his hand around his cock. Dean pressed his thumb into the slit, eliciting some pre-cum to help him out a bit. It made him shudder, made his skin flush knowing Cas was hearing him and was about to hear more of him.
him. An actual kiss filled with such beautiful desperation. Cas’ exams were torture since it. His mind kept hovering back to that moment and any theory or references he had stocked away were sidelined for a few seconds as he indulged in the memory of Dean’s pliant lips against his. He would be surprised if he got above a 70 in any of the last remaining exams he had.
Dean hadn’t planned on falling asleep on Cas’ couch. He had a tough day at work. He was tired. The pasta had been incredible and then when Cas started reading the story aloud Dean thought he’d close his eyes for just a minute then he wakes up around four in the morning with a creek in his neck, a blanket on him and the lights out in Cas’ apartment.
“I’m taking you out on a date, damn straight I’m being chivalrous.” It makes Castiel smile. He’s being taking out on a date. They walk towards the diner.
“Hello boys.” Crowley greeted them.
“I need to get to my post box. You’re in the way.” His eyes move behind Dean to the post boxes behind him. Well that response just makes Dean feel like an idiot. The guy just needed to get to his post, not intimidate Dean. He moves out of the way and lets the guy get to his mail. He clocks him opening 3C.
“Can’t believe Shurley told you not to step out of line again and then he drops you with the head of the Russian gang in your cell. It’s like he wants you to mess up.” Sam chimed in.
and it was just the beginning.
That perked his friend up, leaning back in his chair to scroll through Dean’s Bumble account.
“Dean?” Cas noticed he had yet to leave yet, trapped in his own thoughts.
Smutty feels coming up because I felt the last chapter was enough angst for everyone.
“Whatever they want.”
It appeared to have been a warning too late for Cas. His only hope was that once he got Dean how he wanted him, his appetite would diminish, and he could move on. One fuck and he’d get bored. He always got bored. People got boring, fucking the same people even more so and why would Dean be any different?
“You did say you wanted a burger,” He could hear the smile in Cas’ voice as he opened the door to the restaurant to let Dean go inside first. He stepped into the restaurant. A wave of heat hit him he was thankful for. He shivered as his body adjusted to the temperature, hands smacking together to warm them up.
“Go to Hell.” Dean growled.
Another truth.
A for effort on Cas’ part for trying to unravel Dean’s panic. C+ for the execution of it.
“Cas,” he whined, body starting to shake with frustration. Cas wasted no time, hearing the desperation in his voice, his hand reached in to take a hold of Dean’s aching cock. Dean shot his head back, arching into the touch. “Fuck –
He was still somewhat reeling from those days, especially the last one. Dean
“A superhero hiding in plain clothes.” Cas interjected, face full of pride in his get out clause. Dean chuckled. Well played, not having to dress up and yet dressing up enough for his daughter to think he was dressing up. A win win for everyone involved. Dean might need to steal that idea too though he wasn’t opposed to dressing up. He still had his costume from Halloween in the closest. He and Charlie went as Woody and Jess from Toy Story, even brought Sam and Amelia’s dog Riot along with them trick or treating pretending he was Bullseye.
“You say that now, but you’ll want to melt the chocolate,” he handed out the apron for Dean to take. “Everyone wants to melt the chocolate.”
Dean chuckled, swallowing his bite. He had the immediate thought to brush it off, make some subtle innuendo that was on the tip of his tongue or brush it off completely. They weren’t around the kids though, meaning Dean could take the opportunity to try out their new facet of their friendship, blatantly obvious flirting.
“Nothing, Uriel needs to remember his place,” Cas replied in English to Balthazar. Dean raised a brow at that, as did Balthazar. “Ostav’ nas.” He shooed Balthazar away with his other hand. Dean figured that meant go away now, the only Russian he knew. Balthazar obeyed, returning to his own cell down a bit. He shared with one of the other Russians. They all shared with each other except Cas actually that Dean came to think of it.
He and Benny worked together on the compound. The manager of grounds in Purgatory paired them together most of the time because they weren’t at each other’s throats every two minutes. Dean originally met Benny at intake, they shared a bunk for a month before going into gen pop. He was in on assault and battery, doing 9 years.
Dean nearly had to catch his breath seeing the Russian because the ink on his back was all kinds of mesmerizing. The wings spanning over his should blades, curving over his shoulders and down onto his upper arms. Each feather distinct and when he lifted his arms to run his hands through his hair it looked like he could take off right there.
They were having lunch on campus a couple of days later when Cas decided to announce something as Dean was chowing down on his burrito.
Scooting further down he leveled himself with Dean’s cock, filling his mouth with saliva as he sized up just how much of it he could take. His movements caught Dean’s attention. The boy looked down at Cas, cheeks flushed and eyes bright.
The smell of cigarette smoke suddenly rimmed his nose. He grimaced at it, shuffling over a bit. Dean sighed audibly, “Christ Cas, what now?”
“Fine, I’ll do it.” He agreed.
“Cas?”
Sam shrugged. “Chaos, carnage, take your pick.” Sam looked around the block. Dean followed, the place was already chaos, it was easy to drown out what was going on around them once they got used to the place. The constant noise, the constant turf wars, the only thing keeping them in line were the guards and even then, that wasn’t enough sometimes.
“No problem,” Dean pulled a smile, trying to play it cool. He surveyed the area, noting lots of healthy super food places to eat. “Where can a man get a burger around here?”
“Yeah Cas, kinda my job.” He reaches for two glasses.
“So tight, so beautiful…” Cas continued. Praise after praise surrounding Dean till, he was a crumbling mess not sure which way was up and which way was Cas.
The Russian nodded, picking up pace, making the desk shake underneath him, hitting the concrete wall behind them. Dean held on, hands in fists in Cas’ hair as his orgasm struck down. “Shit – fuck – shit I’m…” he stuttered as the bolt struck down upon him, cumming in between their bodies.
“Dean?” he recognised that voice.
“Yup.” Claire nodded. “Daddy is going as a…”
“Be quiet sweetheart, don’t wanna get caught.”
Cas gets a blowjob.
His name in his friend’s mouth, panting it like a sworn confession.
Dad. He dropped down beside Claire and Cas.
Dean did find out later. How long he had known Cas wasn't aware of. He just knew when they walked their way into the main campus and came to their usual crossroads Cas was about to turn right to the media building and Dean to turn left to the humanities one but before he had a chance to bid his friend a good first day Dean caught Cas by the front of his shirt and hauled him in for an unexpected kiss.
I love all your comments, you're the best :)
he seriously loved it.
“Go, before you’re late.” Amelia pointed to the hall, not taking her eyes off the pandas.
Friday Dean had made last minute plans to bring Charlie to Amelia’s work to see the animals. She had been ecstatic giving him good Dad points and he was again glad for the less time around Cas as he was still getting over the whole
“Suck my cock.”
He closed the chat window with Cas and opened up his emails. One from 7am, reminding parents that the pre-school was still open despite the weather. Education continues no matter the weather apparently.
“Nothing to tell,” Dean grabbed his wallet and keys. “It’s not a date, more a…” he bounced his brows at his brother. His brother grimaced at the thought and decided not to ask any more questions about it.  Success, not completely lying and not completely telling the truth. He followed his brother down the stairs to check in on Charlie before he headed off.
“Yeah man, think I got it.” Dean licked his lips again, eyes moving from Cas back to his cock. An eagerness in them that Cas hadn’t seen in Dean before. A fleeting thought that the eagerness was to please Cas, if only. “Lemme know when you’re close, k?”
“I live here dumbass.” Dean was close to shouting it. So, fucking close.
Two drinks and three songs later and his jealousy had quietened down. Meg had found him sulking and dragged him onto the dancefloor. With the sundown the sea of hot bodies became one and Cas moved his in time with the hypnotic beat that blared through the speakers. His hands holding onto Meg’s as they danced together.
“An actual kiss would be nice for starters.” Leaning down he slipped his mouth between Cas’ lips, unhurried, tongues passing and exploring. The faint taste of cigarette smoke between them from yard time. His hips dipped, grinding on Cas as sluggish and leisurely as his kisses. A delicate string of sighs and gasp from the Russian were creeping their way inside of Dean’s mind, making themselves at home in the space that Dean had given to all things Cas. They found themselves alongside everything else Dean loved about him.
.” He pleaded.
“Close.” Dean stuttered out.
And technically his turn.
Dean freaking loved playing though. Anytime Cas asked, Dean was game for it, even now in his childhood bedroom. The idea of Cas turning dark side was all kinds of arousing. It had his mind swimming at what Cas was thinking of doing to him.
“Yeah, it was real bad apparently. Someone I know who works janitor detail had to clean up the blood.” Benny told him.
“Angel Grace is turning these sons of bitches into super strength mutant lunatics?”
“You for real?” he sounded so elated that if Cas had a heart, he’d almost feel bad about the fact he just wanted to keep Sam busy for ten or so minutes while he went in search of his older brother.
“That was not my intention.” The guy replies calmly. Dean scoffs a laugh.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It could add an element to the video, me coaching you through it.” He suggested.
“Yeah, you wanna come see?” Charlie asked looking down at her best friend.
He finds him sitting on a fallen trunk, hunched over himself, arms wrapped around his knees. He looks small and broken. It aches Dean seeing him like that, seeing that he made Cas like that. The anger drains from him.
41, 42, 43, 44. Dean pushed through his second set of push-ups that morning. Being in the Empty meant he didn’t get enough space to be able to do this outside where he usually worked out. The cubic space he got to stand in for half an hour a day he could stretch out his arms and touch either side easily. No room in there to actually break a sweat. He refused to lose his strength in the Empty, especially as he was supposed to be going back into Purgatory, into gen pop today, if the warden kept his promise that was.
“Yeah.” Dean interrupted. He sped up, wanting to match the smacking sounds that was echoing in his ear. The whole idea of Cas getting off to Dean was making him feel more aroused than he felt the entire time he was with Benny.
“And he didn’t leave a mess on my leather seats either if you know what I mean, so I have no complaints really.” There was a crash on the other side of the line. “Cas?”
“Ignore it Dean. It’s not worth it.” His brother tried to be rational. Dean didn’t work in rational. That’s why he got more time than Sam in the end. He wasn’t thinking straight when it all went down. Five more years he got and for what?
He shot out of his chair so fast it fell to the floor behind him. Uncaring he left his room at pace to cross the space to Cas not even knocking as he entered. Cas sat at his computer desk, head turning to see Dean standing there in his pyjamas, glasses still perched on his nose and dick tenting in his pants.
“Yeah but would it hurt him to smile once in a while?” Sam drones.
“I’ve wanted to do this for so long Dean, get my hand on your cock, feel it like this.”
Dean’s car comes up to their apartment building at around one in the morning. He waits till he hears Dean in his own apartment before going over. The pit in his stomach won’t be going away any time soon till he deals with this. Dean and he were finally in a good space, no arguing, no miscommunications and one glitch in Castiel’s brain could potentially ruin it.
, a proper one, not one laced in sex. He brought her out to lunch then a walk in the park and they talked about being single parents and their kids because that’s what parents did. When he took her hand, she blushed, and it was cute. They were talking about their Thanksgiving plans when her phone started to ring.
“Yes, I think that would be wise.” Cas took his laptop with him, making a beeline for his room. He paused before going into it. “Then Jeopardy?”
“Yes. Why wouldn’t I have…” he turned to look at Dean who was silently chuckling. “Of course. You’re being sarcastic.”
.” Cas sounded disappointed in him, like this wasn’t what Cas wanted.
He walks over to his desk, still naked and grabs a stick of charcoal and his pad. He starts to draw the outline of Dean’s hand. It’s holding the cigarette delicately. Almost everything about Dean is delicate Cas realises, if anyone bothered to look hard enough.
Cas looked down, shaking his head in a smile. He enjoyed catching Cas out, keeping him on his toes especially as they both knew when push came to shove Cas could render Dean mute with just his voice. He was about to continue in this flirty fashion when the girls came clambering up the deck, noticeable shivering, teeth chattering.
“Can I help you with something or are you just gonna stare at me all evening?”
They walked into Gabriel’s house, met by swarms of bodies pushing their way through to get to where they need to be. Dean had to lean in closer to shout over the music playing in the sitting room. “Maybe we should have gotten into the gambling business instead of the porn.”
That made Dean’s stomach drop. If reasoning wasn’t going to get Dean to cave, then a good old-fashioned guilt trip might. He hated that his brother knew him that well. Dean already felt shitty enough for leaving his brother here alone without Sam having to tell him he missed him when he was gone. If Gordon had a hit out on Dean and this Purgatory was not the same as he left it then he was going to need all the help he could get to survive. As much as it pained him, he was going to have to ask Cas the one thing he’d been trying to avoid at all costs.
Kids ruined any emotionless façade Dean had.
.” He says again almost begging, begging for Cas to take already. He gets a response this time, Cas pressing his mouth against Deans and its anything but sunshine and rainbows.
“Dean,” Cas kissed the back of his neck. “Turn around, let me see you.”
“A trick in essence is to play someone for a fool…” Dean is asleep by the time he finishes it.
Dean couldn’t even look at Cas as he spoke, “Don’t leave me alone man.”
“Yes.” Castiel admits. Its’ not as if he can lie when his name is on the cover. The only book he published with his actual name. Jimmy Novak is what he usually refers to himself as when he has published other collections of stories. Dean comes across into the kitchen with it still in his hand flicking through the pages.
Bobby even managed to get himself another employee while he was away, Benny. Dean was surprised he had stuck around for coming on a year. People didn’t last in Singer’s Auto-shop, either fed up with Bobby being Bobby or Bobby sacking them just because he could. Benny was a smooth talker from Louisiana paid off the books. They got on like a house on fire, Dean might even dare to say they were close to being friends at this stage.
“About your tattoo.” Dean wrapped the bandage around his hand, covering the tattoo on his finger, half covering the skulls head. Dean made sure its teeth were still sticking out. They seemed important.
“C’mon didn’t your parents ever explain that to you when you were a kid?”
It didn’t however stop his eyes from landing on the Russian, like his brain was wired to search him out in a crowd, in the yard, in the showers, in the kitchen. That jet-black hair and cold blues were everywhere, all the time and Dean was a magnet unannounced to himself till someone hit him or Cas’ eyes landed on him too. 8/10 it was the latter. Sometimes he’d find Cas already staring at him, rather than holding the stare like he used to, he’d tear his eyes away and that only pained Dean even more.
Cas lifted his mouth into a sly smile. That was a yes if Dean ever saw one.
Dean stepped into his cell. He was hesitant, it had been his cell for almost a year and he suddenly felt like this wasn’t his space anymore. Not with what just happened. That little display had been for a reason. The guy outside the cell, waiting for Dean to come back a power display of what kind of person Dean was about to be sharing his cell with. Not that Dean needed any more convincing how terrifying this Russian could be. Even relaxing on his bunk, reading a novel he had a presence.
When they left, Sam collected his things, Dean called out his number, asked for body wash, cherry jam and a small first aid kit.
“You’re a hero.” He said.
“Tell me, you ever been fucked in the ass before?”
And if this guy came from Hell, max security down the road, he was some bad news, next level, do not fuck with me kind of dude. Not that anyone here was particularly good news, hell even Dean was a bad guy but max security? Serial killers, psychopaths, sociopaths, all the paths under the sun were kept down in Hell.
“Fine I’ll keep my hands to myself, for now.” Dean smirks. Castiel refuses to take that bait. He needs to remain focused at work. Being around Dean is making that difficult, especially the last time they spent a length of time together he was trying to memorize every noise Dean could make with his mouth on his neck.
Cas answered by shoving Dean back with force. His lower back met the desk behind him. Fuck yes this was happening. Dean stripped with a new sense of urgency and jumped up onto the desk once bare, legs parting for Cas to slot into them. The Russian started to undress too. His inked body on show for Dean, only Dean. He hadn’t seen Cas completely naked since that time in the shower when he couldn’t look for too long. This time Dean didn’t hold back admiring his glorious body. His hand went down to take hold of his growing erection.
.” She added, dragging the word out. Dean nodded hearing her and she took the red top from Claire’s hands to put it on once she took off her khaki coat. She left it on the chair far away, so she wasn’t a complete demon and didn’t just leave it on the floor, which she had done before. Content his daughter was going to be alright he followed Cas in through the kitchen arch on the right.
Cas wrapped a hand around Dean’s waist, lifted him up with strength Dean had never seen before to put him lying on the couch. The space between them he didn’t like. He scrambled to be close to Cas and Cas put his hand on Dean’s chest, holding him right there on the couch. Dean whined, hands going into his hair from the frustration of being put in his place, yet his cock leaked from the denial of what he wanted.
