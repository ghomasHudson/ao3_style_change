Steve moved back then, taking Tony’s length his mouth again, slower this time, hollowing out his cheeks and sucking at it in earnest now. He heard Tony sigh above him and looked up long enough to see Tony’s dark eyes watching him, alight with a savage sort of triumph that burned into Steve’s body, sending heat creeping down his back to pool low in his gut. It settled him somehow, seeing Tony look at him like that, a strange sort of calm flooding through him, releasing a tension he hadn’t known he was holding.
“Rhodey said urban legend, so he’s red-shirt tonight,” Tony said.
Steve let out a puff of air, then took his pack and bedroll in one hand and strode to a place by the fire thick with grass and dropped them there while Tony saw to the horses. He unbuckled his sword and unslung the shield from his back, setting both down next to his pack before he spread out the thick blanket and sat down on top of it.  Tony grunted as he sank down next to him, immediately laying down and pillowing his hands behind his head.
“Just want everything to be okay, you know?” Tony mumbled into Steve’s shoulder.
“Thanks, Phil,” Steve said, voice crackling through the oxygen mask as the doors slid shut on last of the doctors.  He tugged that off, and tossed it to the side, coughing a little as he struggled to sit up.
Tony sat up and shifted a bit, positioning himself between Steve’s spread knees.  Steve couldn’t help but stiffen slightly as he felt the blunt, rounded head of Tony’s cock press against his hole.  The familiar burning stretch fissioned through his body on waves that crested right before pleasure became pain.  He had that moment of feeling like it could never work.  Tony was pretty big, after all.
“Why am I instantly concerned?” Steve asked, giving Tony a speculative look that was so full of familiar tenderness and adoration that it momentarily took everything else out of Tony’s head, and, dear God, it was good to be looked at like that again, to remember what it felt like to be someone’s world.  Somewhere along the line, I’m supposed to take care of you, had become a question, how do I take care of you, and Tony got to be the one to answer it.  He still sometimes marveled at that.
“No,” Tony stated emphatically.  “We should probably get out of here and get to bed though.  For completely unrelated reasons, except that last time we did something that I’m definitely not thinking about in the bathtub, we swore we’d think that through a little more next time because getting out of a tub while knotted is, as it turns out, pretty much impossible, and I know we said we were never going to speak of that again, but, again, for reasons totally unrelated to what you are doing, I think I should remind you.”
“Home with you now, Steve,” the man instructed. Steve frowned harder at the man, and, if anything, the man’s grin grew wider.
. The fuzziness in his mind cleared for a moment, and he strained to crane his neck up, trying to see what was happening.  A thread of, not worry exactly, but not
“Okay,” Steve said after a beat of silence.  Tony could feel the corner of his eye twitching and a headache coming on from the base of his skull, and all he wanted to do was pull the emergency exit, but he sipped his water and waited.
“The concierge probably put some supplies in the bedside table,” Tony said.  “I
“You promised to tell me about the gala,” Maria reminded him, leaning in Tony’s direction and placing a gentle hand on his elbow to draw his attention.  Howard and Obie were attempting to regale Steve with tales of their exploits at some weapons convention they’d been to in Vegas last year.  It wasn’t working, but Tony doubted his father, at least, could tell, though Obie, to his credit, kept trying to steer the conversation to something that involved actual landmines instead of metaphorical ones.
“Yeah, fine, they’re trying, but I’d have...I mean. We just can’t count on that, and no way I’m going to ditch you, Snow White, so get used to it,” Tony replied. “You’re stuck with me until we find your people or figure something else out. And, look, like I said, excise out the near-death experience and the whole thing was...okay, unique, but not exactly without it’s merits,” Tony shrugged, feeling a warm tinge of embarrassment creep up his neck.
Tony looked down at him for a moment, searching Steve’s face, as if looking for confirmation.  He must have found whatever he sought, because he growled a long, low rumble that filled the room and bared his teeth, then lowered his head, eyes on Steve until his mouth met Steve’s neck.  Steve could feel his blood jump at the press of Tony’s mouth. It sang in his veins, a siren’s song, thumping and echoing as it passed through his heart.
“That, too,” Tony agreed, almost cheerfully, seemingly unconcerned by the revelation. “You have nothing to fear from me, Steve. I promise, I’m no threat to you.”
“Jarvis!” Rhodey called over his shoulder.  “How do you put up with these two all summer?”
“Seriously?” a voice demanded, drawing Steve from a dream that whisked away the moment he opened his eyes.  He looked up and saw a dark-skinned knight wearing the King’s crest on his breastplate standing at the end of the bed.  The man kicked the bed, making it shake.  Curled up against Steve’s side, Tony grunted, blew out a snort of air and burrowed his head into Steve’s chest.  Steve stared at the man, who raised his eyebrows and crossed his arms in front of him.  “I’m going to keep kicking until His Highness wakes up!” The last was nearly a shout.  Tony blinked awake, smiled a bleary, sleep-worn smile up at Steve and rolled onto his back, stretching his arms over his head.
of things, Steve.  Things you really should have told me!”
“Smart. Good. Subterfuge.  Plausible deniability of any discussion of feelings being had.  Foundation of a relationship,” Tony said, mouth tightening as he glanced over at Pepper.
“Fuck.  Fuck!  God-damn it, how did I miss this?” Tony demanded.
“Sure, that…that’d be great,” Tony replied, finding himself feeling strangely buoyant, almost weightless.  When he twisted his head, Jarvis was watching him with a soft, fond smile.
“Yes,” Cam said, not looking at him.  “The Lord Chamberlain attends the King regularly, same as the rest of his Council.”
“I know you said you were happy here, but…” Steve said after a while.  Anto frowned. That hadn’t been exactly a lie or exactly the truth. He didn’t know what the word for that was.  “That man back there—is he your Alpha?” Steve asked.
“I figured if you did, you’d just…you know,” Tony shrugged.  “That’s what happens in the movies and books and stuff.  Alphas. They get sort of, like, overcome or whatever when they really want someone.  But, you didn’t, so.”
!” Peggy said with a sharp, echoing vehemence that whip-cracked loudly through the room.
“Leave him alone, you two,” Whitney scolded.  “Look, he’s blushing!  How precious is that?  Now, stop.  You’ll chase him away.”
How much longer?  He stretched his neck up again, then dropped his head back down with a groan. Tony still had a stack of letters to answers.
“Still can’t believe you caught up to me.  How many classes did you test out of?  No. Don’t tell me.  I’ll just cry,” Rhodey sighed.  “Alright, alright, let’s go.”
Huh. Well.
“Probably,” Tony replied.  “Ah, finally,” Tony said as the elevator doors slid open and two attendants rolled a cart of dishes covered by silver domes into the room.  Steve felt his stomach rumble as the food was put on the table between them.  Tony’s hand darted out for the small cup of espresso as soon as it was poured, and he made a satisfied sound as he sipped it while signing for the room service bill.
“Do I seem like I have somewhere else to be?”
“Murdock does wills and basic legal stuff pro bono for service members,” Rhodey told him.  “Pepper looked him up.”
look was not surreptitious at all, Steve noted, but openly appraising.
“Captain Rogers was wondering where you’d gotten off to, Boss,” Happy told him.
Silly boys, honestly.
After a long moment, Howard nodded, a quick jerk of his head, but the pressure in the room seemed to release with the movement.
Stop, Tony told himself firmly.  He didn’t even want anything from the stupid catalog.  Definitely not that thing on page twenty-two.
“Wait for me in the tent. Go. Now,” Tony said, stone-faced.
“Right.  So, Army, huh?   How’d a nice guy like you end up in a military industrial complex like that?” Stark asked, taking another drink of wine and bite of bread.
Tony closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath.  “I know. Stay with me as long as you can, okay, J?”
“Alright, fine,” Steve said with a huff of a laugh, turning to follow Tony across the length of the balcony towards the far doors at the end.
“I stand corrected,” Steve agreed, canting his head to one side as he looked Tony up and down.  “You’re beautiful, Tony.”
“You’re not going to donate all your money.  Or, fine, do it, it’s your money, but not—not because of me—this,” Steve objected.
The limo ground to a halt, kicking up gravel and dry dirt beneath the tires, and Tony peered out the darkened window at the cabin. The light by the front door was on, probably zapping moths who couldn’t resist trying for something bright and beautiful.
“Did you tell him what you did?  How you got the money?  No, no, ‘course you didn’t.  Not your precious Bucky, oh, no, we’re not going to tell
“Deal was for a blow job.  You want something else, you need to bring some chicks a few more cosmos down at Applebee's or whatever, ‘cause I’m not getting fucked on a—a—God, is that a futon with a Ninja Turtles comforter? Seriously, that’s…depressing. And not a little disturbing, though, I’m oddly turned on.  Who knew?  To be fair, those reptiles are stacked.  Halfshell, nothing.  Anyway, like I said in the email, a hundred bucks gets you an over-the-condom blowie or a nice handjob without the raincoat, so what’s it going to be?” Kirk asked, clapping his hands together in front of him before spreading them wide in a sweeping gesture, awaiting Steve’s reply.
“The spectacle, as you put it, is what they want.  What they expect,” Tony said.  “Believe me, I have been doing this longer than you have been alive, my beautiful one.”
“We could all benefit from more of that, I would think,” Tony agreed, his voice soft and filled with something that Steve couldn’t quite name. “As difficult as it may be at times to hear.”
“Bela Lugosi?  Buck Rogers? Seriously?  Excuse him, Jarvis. Steve’s cultural upbringing is something of a work in progress,” Tony explained.  “He’d never even seen Star Wars before he met me.”
“Also,” Natasha began, with the air of a woman delivering an indisputable argument, “think of Steve.”
Tony raised his hands to the top button of Steve’s shirt, but before he could undo it Steve pulled his hands away again with a little smile.  He shook his head.
Pepper crossed her arms. “Maybe I have plans, Tony? Did you think of that?”
? Tony held in a snort. Sort of. Barely.
Various people asked him to say for dinner, but it always felt like an intrusion and he declined politely. Tony both loved and hated spending time at the Safehouse. The employees and volunteers swore up and down that he was
Tony glanced down at the test paper—clean. No drugs but alcohol. He raised his glass then hesitated—Belford worked for a pharmaceutical company after all . . .
“Even so,” Katie said, stern voice full of things unsaid.
It was obvious, of course, utterly transparent that
Tony shrugged. “The kind busy building world-saving technologies.”
Tony took his first cup of coffee into the shower.
Galadriel began.
(“. . .
And, oh man, there was so much there--  Rhodey’d just handed him a heaping pile of material to work with, but Tony couldn’t focus on a witty reply.
“It’s just, I thought that—“ Cap began, his tone an entreaty, but he cut himself off abruptly. He shook his head. “Sorry. I came to apologize, not make excuses.” He looked away. “And, I wanted to say: it won’t happen again.”
“I’ve been meaning to ask. After SHEILD found you, did you . . . talk to anyone? I mean, a professional? A therapist?”
“No, not at all!” He still sounded surprised, but pleased too. “That sounds lovely. I can meet you whenever it’s convenient.”
“Good!” Tony said with a grin. “Did a little fine tuning on your uniform and the Security Blanket’s done! Training robots are packed and ready to load on the Quinjet. All that’s left is packing my suitcase, so I was coming to the gym for a break—lift some weights, use the treadmill.” Tony placed a hand on Steve’s chest and tilted his head down as he added in a low voice, thick with innuendo, “But maybe you could give me a workout instead.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
?   Might Howard have proudly introduced Tony as his successor one day?)
His chest felt tight again, but in a good way.
“Sir, you have a call from Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes,” JARVIS interrupted.
Steve was making pancakes.  Blueberry pancakes, this time.  The sausages were in the oven to keep warm, nestled beside the hash browns. There wasn’t much Steve could do to help with Stark Industries (okay, fine—
(And that was so fucking unfair.  Tony never got full credit for his work in R&D until people were afraid he wasn’t at the top of his game; then the investors and partners ran for the hills.)
Tony rolled his eyes. “Calm down, Cap. I’m not—“ (“-- asking you to leave your boot prints all over my ass or anything.”) Tony held in the crude words and cleared his throat, hunching in on himself a little. “It’s no big deal.”
Fury was stony faced. Maria Hill’s eyes flicked back and forth from Tony to Steve to Fury, her face a vision of disapproving incredulity.
The mini-spectrometer was still safely stored in the quinjet, so The Avengers—and bonus War Machine—were ready to go in the time it took to change into their gear.
“At MIT,” Tony said with a shrug, hoping they’d drop it.
on Tony’s shoulder. Pain shot through Tony’s body, pushing him higher.  He whinned.
Tony frowned and set his screwdriver aside. Then picked it up. Then set it down.
And just like that, Steve seemed to go limp. The stiff, stern, terrible set of his jaw and posture--the thing that had sent Tony panicking--seemed to flow out of him.  He opened his arms again and Tony hurried to hug him.  Steve shuddered.
“Yeah, curry’s great Steve,” Barton said with his mouth full.
“What?”  Steve stopped abruptly as he looked at Tony in shock.
Tony set his tools down very carefully and stepped away from the workbench.
(No.)
“I love you, Tony Stark,” Steve said solemnly, like a vow. Tony blinked. Two tears rolled down his cheeks, and Steve brushed them away with his thumbs.  “I love you so much.”
Tony fisted Steve’s hair and pulled him away.  (No!  What--?)  Tony rose up on his knees, then pulled Steve back onto his dick.  (Oh, good. . .)  From this position, Tony could now thrust his hips, driving his cock into Steve’s eager mouth, holding his head in place with both hands.  It was a little awkward—Steve’s muscles were tensed to hold him at the strange angle and he might have lost his balance without Tony’s firm grip.  (Tony’s holding me up . . .)
“Sam Deetz!” Tony cried, grabbing the multi-millionaire’s arm as he walked by. “You naughty man, you haven’t said two words to me all night, but--” Tony dropped his head and looked up through his lashes— “when you look so dashing I can’t stay mad.”
Thanksgiving, but at the thought of having his favorite people together with him in his home. It had been far too long since he’d seen Mrs. Rhodes and he almost never got to spend time with Pepper and Rhodey at once. He wasn’t ecstatic about having some new person—
“Yeah,” Steve said. “Tony took me to the most amazing restaurant last night! Have you ever had Persian food?”
Tony shrugged. Whatever. Just as well. He was busy.
“Got it. It’s running Hypothetical 36. Do you think we can just add a patch to the current devices to close it?”
Tony’s guts clenched. He fixed the Dom with his coldest most contemptuous look, raked his eyes up and down the man’s body, then walked away without a word.
“Are you okay, Tony?” Steve asked with a frown.
“Let’s just say some talents have been reallocated.”
“Mmmmm,” Steve mumbled groggily, nestling back in Tony’s embrace and rubbing his cheek against Tony’s arm.
Tony let out a relieved breath. It wasn’t exactly a lie. They
side of the counter!”
“What’s the hold up?” Clint called from the elevator, already bundled up in his coat. “Fall out!”
“I’ll keep watch,” Natasha added, her tone soft. Tony wondered if he were dreaming.
(Older and wiser, not quite old and not quite wise.)
“You’re awful quiet,” Steve murmured softly after a few moments, leaning down to Tony as Clint rehashed his old critique of Legolas’s absurd technique.  “You ok?”
. (Bruce suggested it, saying he thought Steve would especially like the hobbits. Tony suspected that was a reference to Steve’s former stature, but he wasn’t sure if he should be amused or indignant on Steve’s behalf.)
“Oh. Okay. Some other time then?”
Steve started the timer on Photobooth. Tony leaned on his shoulder with a grin, reaching around to hold the drawing up in front of them both, while Steve gave two thumbs up.
And it was nice, in a way, having a quiet presence in the workshop. Tony sometimes let Pepper hang out in the workshop, but she found it too distracting there to focus on her own work so instead she liked to fill the quiet with conversation—which required his participation—or vague murmurings about whatever light reading she’d brought—which got on his nerves. Rhodey in the workshop was always clamoring for his attention or watching him so intensely he got self-conscious and had to insist they go out. Bruce worked well with him, but that was
Steve cupped his cheek in a large hand and tipped their foreheads together.
“Any time, Captain.” Tony smiled back at him.
Tony blinked in surprise as Steve stepped away.
Pepper gasped. “Is it your second date already?! Now? The day after?”
“How dare you,” Cap hissed. “How dare you talk about Tony like that?”
. . . to see you go up there and, you just—you wouldn’t
So sorry for the long delay and the short chapter!  I really wanted to post this scene together with the next one, but the second scene is giving me lots of trouble and I didn't want to delay this part any longer.  Thank you for your patience and constant support!  You are wonderful!
Rogers laughed. “Oh, I understand. Trust me, I know.”
Steve fled to his bedroom before Clint arrived.
“Do you know what that is?”
“Huh.” Tony almost followed up by asking what
Phillips' barb found its mark.  (Damn it.)
“Mr. Stark,” he said, body stiff, “What can I do for you?”
“Yeah.”
*Jay Wiseman’s SM101 is a very good book and I’ve tried to use quotations from it with respect.  I in no way wish to imply that his book is to blame for the emotional panic Steve is going through at the end of this chapter, though I do think it’s probably an even better beginner’s book for aspiring Dom(me)s than it is for subs. Not everything in SM101 is in accord with my personal BDSM philosophy, but that’s totally fine and there are, as Tony told Steve, lots of different and valid ways to practice safe, sane, and consensual SM.  (To a certain extent, everyone has to figure out what works for them as they go along.)  I met Mr. Wiseman in the SF scene a few times; he was welcoming and kind to me when I was a novice and I’m very grateful to him.
“Please,” Tony begged, his heart pounding and his cock impossibly hard as he rutted against Steve, desperate for every part of them to be together. “
Tony rolled his eyes. When he stepped out of the elevator on the common floor, Steve was sitting at the dining room table with his laptop (a sleek StarkPro, thank god), a tidy stack of papers, and a large glass of milk. (Seriously? He actually drinks milk?) Tony watched as Steve held up a piece of paper, tapped the computer, and smiled, making a thumbs up. Bing-bing-BING: snap.
Tony stopped short when he looked up.  Rogers’ expression had shuttered, brow a painful little crease; he turned to look at the spectrometer.  (Or just wanted to turn away.)  Tony frowned.  (Shit.)  Tony turned back to the diagnostic, checked the equation one last time, then hit ‘run.’  He picked up his coffee and came to stand closer to Rogers.  (But not too close, not close enough he’d have to look up at him. Not close enough their height difference would be more obvious.)
“Tony?”  he whispered, short of breath.  His whole body was hot and tingling, his heart pounding.  “Please?  More.  I’m—”  Steve shuddered. “More?”
“You know,” he said, “Einstein’s definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”
Tony wasn’t sure if he meant for asking about Bucky or something else, but looking at Steve he felt a wave of regret.
Tony laughed.  “Okay, fine.  I get it.  Teamwork! Social justice! Idealism! Right up your alley.”  Tony took a bite of breadstick.  “Guess I can’t argue with that.”
“Don’t go too far!” Tony called. “JARVIS ordered us pizza—should be here soon.”
“What’s the difference?” Steve bit out.
Steve went still and Tony held his breath.
The first light of dawn was peeking in through the floor-to-ceiling windows. Tony closed his eyes again, nestling down in Steve’s arms. Maybe he’d fall back asleep.
The top results were unanimous again: “hope.”
“Yeah?” Tony asked. But instead of answering when Tony looked up, Steve placed a tender kiss on his lips. (Oh!) Steve’s fingers clenched at his hip, pulling him closer. Tony stroked his hands across the broad expanse of Steve’s chest, as Steve’s tongue caressed his lips, soft and inquiring, and Tony met him eagerly.
smile.
So, Tony and I may have gotten a bit carried away by our love of TOS Star Trek and Nichelle Nichols.  Please forgive us.  :-)
,” Steve wined, face burning.  Suddenly, he couldn’t find words or get enough air.  He closed his eyes.
He waited a few more moments then added.
. You’re fine.) He shifted his stance.
“You’re fucking kidding me,” Tony said, flipping his sunglasses down and crossing his arms.
“—wave-particle duality?” Bruce finished from right behind him.
Bing-bing-BING: snap.
, “I’d like that.”
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
“Roger, Rogers,” Tony said, refocusing on his mental calculations. He was distantly aware of Steve’s voice issuing brisk orders, agents moving around them, and the eerie glow above, but he tried to shove it all away. (Focus.) Numbers flowed across the screen and Tony lost track of time.
“No need to be coy,” the Dom said, with a certain unctuous approximation of charm. “After all, the blushing virgin routine isn’t really your shtick.”
“Maybe,” Tony shrugged, “but I was a dick.”  Tony fidgeted.  “You were acting strange though.”
“Calling, sir.”
“Do you need cover?”
“But this isn’t the new normal!” Tony said urgently, already backpedalling and leaning back in his seat. “Still none of that stuff at home, day-in-day-out, and
** What Bruce and Tony were looking at. http://theoatmeal.com/comics/mantis_shrimp and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-LTWFnGmeg. Enjoy!
Tony gave him a blank look.  “That’s Shakespeare?”
** “force of nature” was the phrase Jaune_Chat used to describe Steve in chapter six of “Permission to Surrender.”  The phrase stuck with me, so part as plagiarism and part as a shout out, I’ve given her line to Tony.  :-)
“For a good reason,” Pepper cut in.
unjammed it!”
Steve pushed him firmly back against the wall. Tony’s blood surged; a wave of heat sweep over him, leaving him nearly lightheaded. (
“With all due respect,
Bruce laughed, loud and smiling.
(Really fucking eloquent, Stark.) The thought came unbidden and made his guts clench.  (God damn it, I don’t have to impress him. You’re fucking dead, Howard, so just fucking--)
Slick, gentle fingers caressed Tony’s entrance; it sent his heart pounding at breakneck speed, all eager anticipation. But even more than that it was the rapt look on Steve’s face—so beautiful, his eyes bright and that furrow of concentration pulling at his brow.
After a moment’s pause, the two Doms nodded.
Tony blinked.  Rogers clearly didn’t get the reference or what Tony meant by it.  Shit.  Rogers lived with
.  His eyes were such bright blue and the shirt brought it out all the more.  Tony wondered if Rogers knew that and did it on purpose.  Tony frowned and forced his eyes back down.
“Yes please!” Tony said with a grin, then made grabby hands at Steve. Looking puzzled, he stepped closer; Tony pulled him in for a kiss. “Thanks, babe.”
Tony looked at the formal dinning table again and took a deep breath.  It didn’t actually look like a scene from Stark Manor. Not really.  (Howard would never have served curry. And none of the furniture here was a priceless antique.)  Tony shook his head.
.  As if hearing his plea, Steve started mouthing at Tony’s hole in earnest, using his lips on the edges, sucking lightly, letting his tongue dart in, tracing the circle, then back out.  A gentle scrape of teeth catching on the bottom of Tony’s hole, and he howled, then tossed his head back in a silent scream as Steve worked his tongue deep into Tony’s warm, wet channel.  Slick leaked down his crack and pooled somewhere between his splayed thighs, not that it seemed to bother Steve, who kept up a steady rhythm of tongue and mouth, lips and breath.
Steve was leaning against the back of his chair, one arm slung over the railing, watching Tony with a strange, guarded expression that made Tony want to shift in his seat, though he willed himself to stay still.
If he closed his eyes, he could see it.  Jimmy’s Balloon Darts on the Bowery, Tony remembered.   Colorful balloons on a pegboard, with a big sign dangling from the front of the booth warning, No Leaning Over the Table.  The tang of salt and fried food in the air, his stomach still protesting from too much saltwater taffy and too much screaming on the Cyclone, feeling almost lightheaded because this, this moment, was so good, so perfect, full of promise and a future where he got to have this so often that he got used to it.
“I see it!  Her. Covi, whatever,” Rhodey shouted excitedly.  “Almost there!”
“How do you feel?” Tony asked, wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist and fitting himself against Steve’s side.
“You’re welcome,” Steve replied, biting at his bottom lip, then giving up and returning Tony’s smile.
“Easier to offer it than to have it forced on you,” Steve suggested softly, with a slow nod.  “That way, it feels more like a choice, even when it isn’t.”
Bright, hot pleasure burst to life inside Tony.  His back bowed. His neck arched, driving his head into the furs.  He screamed Steve’s name as he came in long, white spurts against Steve’s hand.  Steve rammed into him again, then again, and then Tony felt pulses of warmth fill him.  Steve pumped again, the cords in his neck standing out as he chased the last of the feeling.
“I bite,” Steve said by way of explanation.
Tony was rubbing his hands up and down Steve’s back, then lower, over the curve of his waist and lower still, to cup the globes of his ass, giving them a squeeze.  “God, you’re...I mean...Michelangelo would have been like, ‘move out of the fucking way, David’, is all I’m saying.”
Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.
“No, no, its fine.  We’re friends.  Better that way, really.  I think we tried too hard to make a great friendship into something else, like that wasn’t enough.  And all of this—after Killian and Extremis…it was too much, I think,” Tony said absently, then caught himself.  “Um, anyway, she splits her time between here and California running SI, so you’ll see her around. But we aren’t together.  I’m not actually with anyone.  Like that, I mean.  Just me, you know—just…just me,” Tony said, clamping his jaw together so hard he was surprised it didn’t crack.
“I’d forgotten that,” Tony said, though they both knew he was lying.  He felt a ripple of remembered guilt, stale and past due, though he wasn’t sure why.  He had only seen Jan a few times after that, but she had called him Sir Anthony until her father told her to stop.  He had liked that.
The air was cool against his skin.  He heard the thud of Steve’s pack hit the ground, then the crush of grass as Steve sank to his knees behind him.  He hadn’t thought that Steve would—he hadn’t thought at all, not really. Steve had given the signal, and he had complied, but now, with Steve behind him, Steve, who didn’t think he was big or ugly or stupid, Steve who made him laugh and taught him words and made beautiful things for him, who punched Tyber and said that was wrong, what Tyber did, who let Anto calm him, the way Omegas were supposed to, and there was something called Pleasures, and it could be good…he wouldn’t mind, if Steve wanted to.  Better than not mind. He wanted to know what it meant, this sharing Pleasures.
Turning away from the sink, Tony skirted the kitchen table and started down the hall.  He was halfway to his room when he heard Steve call his name.  He stopped and twisted around, cocking his head.  Steve had shifted on the sofa enough so he was facing Tony.  His face was shadowed by light from the flickering screen still gamely trying to get them to press play or select a special feature.
“I know,” Fury said, holding up his hands in front of him in a placating gesture.  “You have to understand, we were concerned—“
Tony just stared at her numbly, then his eyes went back to Steve laying on the table, not moving.  One hand hung limply over the side and there was blood dripping from it, a slow,  thin stream of red running onto the floor of the jet.
“I’m fine,” Steve countered through gritted teeth.  He had to resist the urge to shift in his seat, use his bulk, throw her off this nonsense.  He could do it.  A sharp word.  The right tone.  It would stop.
“I won’t, not after a little bit.  You know I won’t,” Steve insisted. “Just...stay.”
“You had to make it weird,” Rhodey sighed.  “Can I hold the shield?”
“Here,” Tony huffed out, holding out the quilt towards Steve when he was a few feet away. “It's cold out here.”
“I—what?  No,” Steve said.  “I don’t really…well, I haven’t.  Not recently.  Well, technically not—it’s been awhile.”
“No,” Steve corrected, catching Tony’s quick frown. “Together. We’ll do this together, Tony. I think…I think like you said. Before. In the woods when we were on the way to Lord Ellis’. I think we were meant to.” Tony opened his mouth to say something, then closed it again, lips flattening into a thin line as he studied Steve, looking for gods only knew what, though he appeared satisfied enough, face softening around the ghost of a smile.
“Ok, so I’m out of here,” Tony said tersely, turning to deposit his now-empty tumbler on the tray of a passing waiter.
“James filled me in,” Natasha said. She stepped inside, and Rhodey followed, shutting the door and leaving the tiny apartment entirely too crowded.  “You’re both idiots, by the way.  You
Tony rolled back over and sat up.  There was a loud thwumping noise getting progressively louder, and the whole room was shaking just enough for Tony to feel it.  Above him, a thud followed by a creaking sound, and the whole room seemed to almost jump.  Or, Tony did, he wasn’t sure.  His mind had already gotten past helicopter and run screaming into the arms of Thank Fucking God.  He scooted off the bed and walked carefully to the bedroom door as the noise and vibration continued from above.
“Did he say that?” Steve asked quietly.  He leaned forward and gripped his hand on the edge of the window, then dropped his chin to his chest, sucking in a deep breath.
“I already have this week’s assessment form ready to submit,” she assured him, swiping nonexistent stray hairs out of her face as she shook her head back.  “You know, Captain, I’ve never approved of this.  This arrangement with the Director.  It’s only been six months since you returned from your tour of duty.  I don’t know all the details, but I know enough.  The loss of your unit has to weigh incredibly heavily on you, Captain.  It would affect anyone.  It isn’t a weakness to need help.  I don’t care how valuable you are to SHIELD, it isn’t helping you or anyone else to put you there if you’re a risk.”
Steve tipped Tony’s chin up with his hand, then gently twisted Tony’s head up, forcing Tony’s gaze back to his face. “Bad men.  No Tony.” He shook his head, as if to emphasize his words.
“He thinks I’m having a go at him.  Or you’re full of it.  Or something.  It is…pretty impossible to believe, even for me sometimes.  Besides, he knows you, and you’re, well…
“Oh,” Steve managed.  His chest tightened and the food in his stomach soured.
anything.  I told you that,” Tony added, looking up at Steve for a long beat before turning his gaze to the fire.
, Tony Stark was gorgeous. Everyone knew that. But, one-on-one like this, Tony was striking, and sure, yeah, Steve knew he had a type and Tony fit the bill, but he thought it was a little more than that.  If he hadn’t been Tony Stark, if he had just been some guy Steve met in a bar or online or however people did that these days, Steve would still have noticed him, that was for sure.
Steve wasn’t sure if that was a distinction that mattered anymore.
“Pretty sure I don’t want to know,” Bruce agreed.
“So, ah.  Awkward. Hi,” Tony said by way of greeting.  “Thanks for the, ah, juice box and lembas bread.  And you know, the whole healing me thing. Have to admit, I did not expect, well...I don’t know what I expected, to be honest. Not this, though.  So, thanks. I guess. I don’t know,” he raked a hand through his hair. “Do you thank someone for this? What’s the etiquette for alien abduction? God, this is all so fucked up, I have to tell you, I’m still trying to just, like, process this, I don’t even...I don’t even know where to begin.”
Yinsen frowned at Tony for a moment, then said something to Steve that Tony was fairly sure was a much more conciliatory version of what he just said.  Steve’s eyes darted to Tony, once, then back to Yinsen, and he nodded, as if considering and said something in reply to Yinsen.  It was so frustrating not to be able to understand him, Tony thought, not for the first time.  He was trying to learn, but…with everything else, it was slow going.  Besides, by the time he did learn, he would probably be gone.  At least, if everything went according to plan.  He would be gone from this horrible life of captivity where he…got to fix things his Alpha broke for him because he once said he enjoyed doing that.  Shaking his head and grimacing, Tony looked back towards Yinsen in question as Steve finished whatever he was saying, which seemed to be taking a long time.
“It’s fine, Tony.  I think you put it on to, ah, protect me, I guess. From you trying something stupid, and from whatever it is that you think might happen,” Steve shrugged with a small smile.  “It’s sweet.”  It really was, Tony decided.  They could make it a thing.  He could wear the suit and keep Steve safe, and Steve could be safe.  This relationship was going so well.
The hearing room was a bit like a small courtroom, though it lacked a jury box. It was empty, except for Colonel Phillips, who was wearing a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses.  He looked over his shoulder at them, frowned and nudged his sunglasses down his nose a bit.
“See? Bruce is a doctor, and he knows doctor stuff,” Tony remarked, waving to Bruce.  “And also, he got the memo,” Tony said happily because Bruce, bless him, was respecting the—okay, he wasn’t actually allowed to call it a bubble anymore because there had been words, and Clint had gotten a bubble machine and like eight gallons of dish detergent and then Steve’s face had done that frowning thing that Tony
Tony moved lower, his mouth leaving a wet line as he kissed and sucked his way down Steve’s body, stopping at the base of Steve’s throat to lick the divot there, then lower, over his stomach, following the sparse trail of hair down to Steve’s cock.  Steve stilled, watching him, his hands bunching into the soft, red fabric beneath him.  Silk, he thought to himself.  Silk, like the petals of a rose, but softer, like water, running water between his hands, warm and liquid, like blood, like blood, the thought thumped through him as Tony licked a wide stripe down Steve’s cock.
“Sure,” Steve replied, pushing himself up off the sofa.
“What if I told you that I’m looking forward to that the most? Tony asked with a soft smile and a jaunty, teasing wink back at Steve as he left. Steve watched as Tony walked towards the group of soldiers that included Generals Rhodes and Ross and the man, T’Omash, who had been helping him with the Jerak’ho.
Steve looked over the small table at her, then glanced around the room at the couples with their heads together, the tables of friends watching the game on one of the screens above the bar, the group of women laughing and buying drinks for the young stock brokers in their smartly-tailored suits.  He wasn’t unhappy.  Not really.  But, the opposite of not unhappy wasn’t happy, and he knew it, and this thing lately where he had started to hope for an alien invasion so he had an excuse to call Iron Man away from Mr. Stark for a bit was, all in all, probably not the healthiest way to reach out.
The hand that had been on Tony’s cock was stroking his own huge member where it undulated with whatever was inside it.  Tony’s tongue darted out to wet his lips. He had the vague sense that he should be worried, but he pushed it away. This was fine. This was good.  He was safe.
Steve looked at him for a long moment before putting his forkful of pancakes down.  “You’re just going to buy all the seats on the plane, aren’t you?” Steve questioned resignedly.  All the seats on the plane, of course.  That made so much more sense than buying the airline.  Steve was so frugal.
“Well, I was trying to have sex with you. Seemed expedient,” Tony admitted. “Now, I still want to have sex with you, but with more of the talking and eating together and that holding hands thing we were kind of almost doing. Come on, think of the story we’ll have to tell our friends if this works out,” Tony teased, knocking his shoulder in Steve’s.
“That good, Tony?” Conference Room Steve asked, pumping his fingers a few more times.  Tony nodded, eyes squeezed shut, one hand twined in Skinny Steve’s hair, the other curled into the grip of Helicarrier Steve’s glove.  “See?” he said, stretching up to brace a hand on the side of Tony’s head.  “We worked it out,” he husked out, dipping his mouth to Tony’s.  Tony leaned up, mouth seeking. His hands left the other Steves to wrap around this Steve’s neck, holding him there while the kiss deepened.
, Steve thought, was also a lie.
“Let’s go back to the house and clean up,” Steve suggested, moving slightly against Tony, making it an invitation.
“Oh,” Tony said. “Wait, must? What happens if you don’t?”
He had seen that before, he remembered.  On a field so deep with bodies that his boot couldn’t find the ground, when his vision was painted red where it dripped down from his brow.  Not his. He didn’t know whose blood it was, not anymore. He could see it, as clearly as if he were standing there. His vision clouded with the haze of smoke.  He blinked down at his hands. They were covered in red. Dripping with it. It clung to his skin. He could smell it, a pungent, metallic scent that filled his nose and mouth.   He could feel the weight of the shield on his arm as he held it aloft. He could feel something else, too, quickening through his veins like fire through a field of dry brush. Something he hadn’t felt in a long time.
It was worse.  Way, way worse. Tony stared in paralyzed horror for a moment.  He must’ve scrolled right past Rhodey’s name and into the S’s by mistake, though at least it was Steve’s work number,
“Tony,” Steve called out, reaching out a hand.  “Wait.  Please.  Let me…”
They switched to cards the following evening, and Tony won the first round of poker fairly handily.  Steve did manage a straight and two flushes in a row after that, claiming he’d learned how to play in the Army.  Which was probably true, Tony acknowledged, considering that when Tony’s mental probability math finally turned on the Kill Bill sirens, and he grabbed the deck from a snickering Steve, it was obvious Steve had been dealing from the bottom.  Figured I’d even the odds, was all Steve said, then set about shuffling the deck for real, leaving Tony flummoxed and strangely warm at the teasing.
“Impressive, righ?  Sentry mode,” Tony ordered.  Steve rocked back on his bottom so far that he toppled over to one side, staring up at the suit.  He managed to right himself, and half-scooted, half-crawled in some weird sort of crablike maneuver over to the suit’s feet, grabbing onto one boot and trying to pull himself up while he looked back and forth between Tony and the suit.
His thirst momentarily sated, Steve looked out towards the sea from underneath the makeshift lean-to he had constructed out of what few materials to be found on the island and the bits of wreckage that the creature brought up from the deep.  Wind-swept waves were glancing over the shore under a clear, blue sky and empty horizon. He couldn’t spy the creature from here, but he knew it was there, likely waiting in its usual spot for Steve to come down for his morning swim, a habit he had gotten into after waking up itching from whatever it was in the sand that first night.  Since then, he had managed to make a bedding of some of the larger leaves he pulled from the trees packed over a soft, sandy clump of sand, but he still looked forward to the routine of rinsing off in the morning and talking to, or at least talking
“Ms. Potts,” Mitch said warmly in greeting. “Good to see you, as always. Colonel Rhodes, so nice to have you back in town.”
Steve made his way back to shore and put his clothes on.  They were in pretty bad shape by this point, but it wasn’t like he could exactly expect the creature to go shopping for him, as much as it seemed able to find just about anything one way or the other.   When he looked up, the creature was sunning itself again, though he had the strange feeling that it had been watching him just a moment before. Of course, it didn’t wear clothes, just that pendant it was so attached to, so Steve supposed it probably thought it strange to occasionally shed and then don a fabric skin.  Or, maybe it just liked looking at him, the way he sometimes caught himself admiring it. In a...more scientific curiosity kind of way, that is. Like something fanciful out of Marvels.
Steve made his way back to Brock’s apartment.  He spent the remainder of the afternoon sitting on the futon, looking up information on financial aid and work-study programs, which actually lifted his spirits a bit because it did seem like there might be some options, even without Tony’s money.  He’d have to give up the job at the warehouse, but maybe he could keep working nights and weekends at the bar, so at least he was able to pay for school and continue to contribute to the apartment expenses.
“...yes,” Steve said slowly, glancing down at his phone and then up at Stark in confusion.
Someone should clean that up.
“As you are,” Tony acknowledged, then smiled and clucked his tongue.  “You two, see that we are not disturbed,” Tony ordered the guards who had followed Rhodes and Steve to the training room. They bowed and left through the two large doors at the end of the room, which they closed behind them, leaving Steve, Tony, Rhodes and the two guards Steve recognized.
Steve wanted to show him.  Wanted it more than he had realized until this moment.  It had been so long.  So God-damned long since he’d felt this way.
“Don’t go,” Tony said, one hand snaking out to blindly grope for Steve.
It was good, Steve thought.  Hardly a punishment.  He liked Tony’s taste.  His smell.  The soft, supple feel of the skin of his cock, the way the vein on the underside rushed with blood, the way he could feel the slight stiffening and lengthening of the shaft in his mouth.  Above him, he heard the scratch of the stylus across the parchment, rhythmic and familiar.  He looked up at Tony under his lashes, watching as he occasionally chewed one end of the stylus before going back to whatever he was drawing. The star fort, Steve assumed.
“That it is, I daresay,” Lord Rand agreed, puffing out his chest a bit. He followed one of the overseers towards the mine with the air of a man who wanted to project a familiarity that he had not truly earned, leaving Steve with little doubt that the elder Lord Rand did not make many trips to the mines or quarries that filled his coffers.  The younger Rand appeared to be more at home here, Steve noticed, even greeting several of the overseers by name.
“Fights Cap’n America,” Tony replied, holding up the object in his other hand.
“No hold up.  Get on with it,” the guard shouted back.  He looked down at Steve again, then pulled the reins of his horse and rode back to the front of the caravan.
The jet slowed as they approached the Tower, shimmying a bit as the wind flaps went up.  Steve didn’t care for that very much, and started to make a long, nasally wailing sound.  “Hey, hey, you’re fine,” Tony murmured, patting a metal hand against Steve’s back.  “Just landing.  It’s fun, see?  Wheeee!”  The cry cut off abruptly at that, leaving Steve staring up at him, eyes wide.  “You like that, huh?  Wheeeee!” Tony repeated, garnering a smile from Steve that lasted until they hit the landing pad with a jolt, which Steve really didn’t like.  “Okay, okay, all done.  See?  Not so bad.  Steve thinks your landing skills need improvement,” Tony said to Clint as the other man unbuckled and got out of the pilot’s seat.  Steve’s hiccupping cry seemed to affirm that observation.
be your Omega,” Tony finally managed.  He nudged the bottle cap with his fingers, sending it rolling across the desk.  They both watched it tumble, neither of them moving.
“I think I’ll have that bath now,” Steve said, shaking his head at the absurdity of the conversation.  Cam let out a whoop and practically leapt off the ottoman on which he had been sitting.  He sprinted towards the bathing room in his eagerness to pull the cord that would bring servants bearing pitchers of water, clearly delighted by the prospect of someone else answering his call.  Steve shook his head as he watched the boy dash off, then frowned down at the nearly empty tray of food.
“Sam is The Falcon,” Steve admitted, looking weary.
Steve pulled Tony’s hand around behind him until it rested just below the small of his back.  Tony wasn’t an idiot, so took the obvious invitation and lowered that hand, bringing the other one around so he could cup Steve’s ass, massaging the globes in his hands as he parted him. Steve tore his lips away from Tony’s and started kissing a trail down Tony’s jaw, to that sensitive spot behind Tony’s ear.   He could feel Tony’s finger trace down to find his entrance, prodding lightly at the rim.
“I know you,” Steve interjected. He reached out and brushed the backs of his fingers across Tony’s temple and through his water-soaked hair. “You’re a good man, Tony. Sometimes, good men have to make choices they don’t like, hard choices, yes, but—but, doing nothing can be its own cruelty, can’t it? During the War, we had to make those choices, too. I know what it’s like to have to compromise.”
“What?” Tony asked in confusion, looking down at his boxers.  “You like?” he asked, waggling his eyebrows at Steve, who was determinedly not looking at Tony.  Apparently, Steve approved of Tony’s Captain America boxers. "Don't mock.  You know I still have my fan club member card."  Steve just shook his head and looked away, though Tony caught a bit of color on his cheeks before he hid it.  He grinned.  He always did enjoy making Steve blush.
“Yeah, we’re definitely going to need to do something about you,” Tony said, staring at the black screen in annoyance.  Honestly, the simple AI he’d designed to do his coursework for those online classes had been more sophisticated.   Might even be kind of fun to be able to asking J.A.R.V.I.S. things.  He could even give him a British accent instead of Siri’s vaguely-stoned California barista version of ‘Sure, Jan.’ Natural language user interface wasn’t that much of a step up from the learning algorithms his original version had been running.   Just needed a denser set of inquiries and responses.  He could even program him to respond to emotional cues.  Make him insist he wasn’t fretting. Things like that. Good times.
“Oh, good Lord, someone shoot me,” Clint snorted from behind the kitchen island.
But, it had been good, or he thought so, until Steve had come to see him in his office three days ago and told him they needed to stop, or, rather, he wanted to stop and got all Boy Scout about owning up to it.  Which, hey, fine.  Not like anyone had made any promises or, hell, actually used any real words, so fine.  Steve was done with this, whatever it was.  No problem.  Consenting adults and all that.  They’d both had fun, or some version of it.
“Sorry, Mrs. Stark,” the smaller of them with the short, cropped hair called out, then cast a look at her friend and jerked her head towards the floating platform a good ten meters out into the lake that had a diving board hanging off one end.
“I don’t want your money,” Steve said after a moment.
He’d spent his life looking at this as something that was missing, something that was wrong, but would he have found Steve if he’d been like everyone else? Would he have even seen what he had? If the mark was a map to your happiness, then it had led him to that end. Maybe that’s what all the mark really was, a promise of what could be, the knowledge that each of us, terrible, broken things that we are, can be loved by another. If so, that promise had been fulfilled many times over, Tony thought, watching the way the metal band gleamed in the fading light of the afternoon sun that was streaming in the windows. He loved Steve more than he would have thought possible, and he knew Steve loved him the same way, as hard as that was to understand sometimes.
The apartment was exactly as he remembered from yesterday, neat and weirdly homey, with its mismatched bookshelves full of photos, stacks of clothes and patchwork quilt-covered bed that managed to look both efficient and charming and so very Steve he almost didn’t want to go back in, like if he did, he’d become part of something he was desperately trying to forget.  Natasha, Barnes and new guy were already inside though, so there wasn’t really any choice.  He stepped through the threshold and squeezed between the coffee table and loveseat to give Rhodes room to stand next to him.
“Yes,” Thor, Bucky and Sam replied in unison.
“Not being a dick about it?”  Steve filled in, eyebrows raised in challenge for a moment before he shook his head and turned around to face Tony.  “Apologize to your assistant for me.  They didn’t mean—I’ll talk to them.”
A tremor ran through Steve at the realization that Tony suffered the same confusing feelings about the dreams that haunted him.  Flashes of memory stalked his mind, more clear now than they had ever been in the harsh light of day.  Tony’s hands on him. Strong, like steel bands, holding him down. Tony’s mouth. His teeth, sharp and hard, but almost painless. Tony slipping inside him in all the ways only he could.  The dizzying rush of blood leaving him, pulsing into the wet heat of Tony’s mouth. His cock spilling as Tony sucked the life out of him.
“It sounds beautiful,” Tony replied softly.  “Where is this place that you long for so much?”
“No.  Do you?” Steve drawled.
So, a dear friend over on tumblr drew some art in the Celestial Navigation 'verse, which featured Tony in lingerie.  I was...very inspired by this whole concept, let's say.  Here is 7500 words of CN lingerie/uniform fetish porn.
And then he couldn’t hold back—Steve fell on Tony, like he was a magnet drawing steel, sharp and inevitable. Steve pressed his face to Tony’s neck—not quite a kiss, not yet—as he folded Tony in his arms and held him tight. Tony’s body went stiff with surprise as Steve crushed them together.
After a few moments, Steve slid to his knees beside him. He took each of Tony’s wrists in a large hand. (Steve’s fingers easily circled his wrists with room to spare.)
Pepper smiled, then asked, “So any thoughts on the proposal I sent?”
Tony gave a little shrug and, pulling his hand back, started to turn away.

“Of course,” she said easily, “which is why I brought you
Spider Man? You’ve gotta be kidding— How did you even—? Oh wow!”
Tony blinked and nodded.

“Seriously, Steve?  You still won’t call him Tony?  What gives, man?”
“There are 7 bedrooms, so wherever you want except the Master suite—it’s already full of my stuff.”
Brue considered it.  He looked skeptical, but after a few moments gave a little shrug.  “Sure.  Can’t hurt, right?”

a sub,” Rogers said blankly. Tony laughed and Rogers looked even more confused.
(Seriously?  You’re running from that girl like she’s a fire-breathing demon.   Absurd.)
“This one’s actually addressed to both of us,” he said, handing an envelope to Tony. In it was a letter written in alternating hands of blue and orange colored pencil telling them that Thomas was seven-and-a-half and when he grew up he was either going to be a Captain or a veterinarian. Jamila was ten and would be a famous engineer—she’d won first prize at the county science fair TWICE. There was also a joint self-portrait of them as Captain America and Iron (WO)Man drawn in colored pencils, along with a photograph of them in their homemade Halloween costumes (big grins, missing teeth), enclosed by Mr. and Mrs. Mohammed.
Tony wanted to reach out and pat Steve’s knee, but he couldn’t with Steve all the way across the table.
“Oh God, come here,” Tony moaned, pulling at Steve’s hair.  Steve scrambled onto the bed, graceless in his haste.
She gestured down the hall.
Steve hadn’t hated it; he liked it.  Liked to be looked at, liked to be transformed into artwork.  It had made his blood sing and his body hum.  And his miserable, treacherous body (his goddamn traitor cock) responded for all to see.
“Tony?”
Clint landed an especially nasty blow to Steve’s sternum and Steve charged him like a bull. But there was something about it that was starting to leave Tony unsettled.  Something not just intense or fierce in their looks, but angry.  Just a little too much.
“Tony,” Steve said, shaking his head with a rueful smile. “You don’t want to hear about that.”
Steve slipped his hand free from Tony’s, now a little sweaty, and waved at the others.
because it was just him and JARVIS, and yet—
“Always so predictable,” Nat taunted with a grin, ducking under a Johnson punch.  “You shouldn’t recycle so many moves.”
Tony lifted his arms and offered Steve his upturned palms.
Steve nodded and let Tony lead him towards the dance floor, emerging from their little shelter.
(And actions spoke louder than words, so maybe Steve didn’t have anything to say, but he’d been thinking about what to
“I guess maybe a little?” Steve shook his head, then gave another shrug. “It’s not a big deal.”
Tony went silent.
“Right,” Steve said uneasily, then looked at the dinning table and whistled. “Golly, you’re sure putting on the Ritz. What’s the occasion?”
Tony winced. “That was a low blow.”
The dildo curved a bit at an angle and was on the small side. It was quite a bit smaller than Tony, which was probably to ease him into things, but also seemed like it would make it less useful for a proper . . . education. Steve gave it a gentle squeeze; it felt slightly springy, but not warm and yielding like real flesh. The texture was a little odd. The head was well-shaped and it had ropey veins standing up which made it look like it might have come from a mold of an actual penis. (And, yeah, that’s a weird thought.) It was very realistic in its shape, but it had an oddly uniform pinkish color to it that was nothing like a real cock.
*re: dyke.  This was probably clear from context, but just to clarify: in this AU dyke is slang for a female Domme.  Though historically used as a pejorative, the word has undergone a process of reappropriation and is now often (though not always) used as a term of self-identification or affectionately in re: Dommes who like to use the term themselves.
“Good boy,” Tony whispered as he shuffled up carefully, trying not to wake Steve.  He drank the water greedily, throat parched, and realized suddenly he hadn’t cleaned Steve up.  Hadn’t given him any water before he fell asleep.  Cup and washcloth were unused next to the cushions.  Tony frowned and tried not to worry about it.  He hadn’t exactly forgotten he just . . . hadn’t done  it right away.  He’d felt shaken apart after he came and Steve had pulled Tony into his arms as if he knew exactly what Tony needed.  (Sometimes, it’s like that man’s an empath.)  And then Steve had drifted off so quickly. . .
“So, I’m in charge,” Steve said, “but if you don’t like something—if it’s uncomfortable or no good for you, I want you to promise me that you’ll ‘yellow,’ even if it’s something small. Can you do that for me?”
“Gosh,” Steve said, stepping over to the workbench to run his fingers across it. “It looks amazing.”
Tony got Steve to watch an episode of
“5:23, sir,” JARVIS answered automatically.
For some reason this chapter was a ridiculous struggle, but here it is. Sorry for the delay getting this to you! (Still not really happy with this, but I don't think obsessing will help. :-)
"Do you still think about it?" Tony asked, leaning closer. Ms. Potts had bandaged his hands and he reeked of scotch and antiseptic, but under it was a faint hint of lavender and sandalwood. She must have bathed him.
sending it made something cold and painful twist in his belly.
Suddenly this didn't seem like such a good idea anymore, but he couldn’t seem to stop himself. (Those who listen at eaves, may not like what they hear...)
“Captain Rogers says it is no bother at all, but that he does not wish to intrude.”
“We’re only ten minutes in,” Bruce added. “If you’d rather we restart it.”
“I’ll consider it,” Pepper said very seriously.
Tony bristled and answered before Bruce could say anything: “I didn’t realize that was something you needed to know.”
, Tony wanted it. He wanted the thick, hard weight of Steve’s cock stretching his mouth open, the wet heat of it moving in and out, Steve’s fingers in his hair, hand on his neck holding him in place, as he took Tony’s mouth. . . Or maybe he’d hold back, just watch Tony suck him and make Tony work for it . . .
Steve grinned. “Nice to meet you, uh--?” He looked at Tony.
Tony’s chest felt tight.
“You bet.”
“Obviously.”
. Why I ought to--”
“Do you promise?”
Apparently my solution to massive, hideous writer's block about the Press Conference was to shove it into the next chapter... (But at least now I have a plan!  It's progress, friends.)
Tony nodded tightly and was surprised to find his eyes prickling. “The very best.”
as he said (perhaps a little more softly?), “Mr. Stark.”
“Uh, Captain—I really don’t think the . . . Other Guy should be joining in.”
(Wait, I know that look . . .)
kind.  Outspoken and uppity.”  Rogers was frowning again.  “Fury’s trying to make sure I’ll stay out of trouble, in my personal life and in the press.”
Steve’s voice blared over JARVIS’s speakers:
“I thought so,” Steve said, voice soft. “I feel very lucky that he’s giving me a chance.”
“I’m not going to do anything to jeopardize your recovery,” Rogers said solemnly. The atmosphere in Tony’s hospital room changed suddenly. Tony swallowed.
“Well, that’s the real selling point!” Sasha said with a laugh.  “So, does he have a sweet nerdy brother for me?”
showed the feisty beloved eventually submitting to the unflagging and frankly stalker-ish persistence of the Dom with a crush? The guy who asks her—(because, yeah, hardly any male subs or Dommes in the media)— out over and over and over again.  The guy who shows up unannounced with flowers (possibly breaking and entering to deliver them); eliminates her other suitors with unscrupulous, yet 'comic antics'; watches her with ‘protective’ ‘attentiveness’; and follows her around, thereby enabling him to rescue her from somebody even more creepy and rapey. “It’s not stalking! It’s
“Steve?” Pepper said stepping up to the counter. “Tony does this kind of thing, I’m afraid. He has a tendency to go a little overboard.”
“Don’t you fucking pull that shit again, man.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Steve just smiled and reached for Tony’s hand. (Not what I’d been hoping for, but I’ll take it.) Waiting for the elevator, he pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s forehead.
“You bet!” Tony checked his watch. “Give it another twenty minutes for politeness, then we can beat it.”
But there was nothing to apologize for and Tony wasn’t about to let Steve out of his sight in this mood. He pulled the door shut and approached Steve with the blanket. Steve’s exposed skin was bright pink with frostbite
Of course, everyone had heard the news about Captain America and Tony Stark; SHIELD Agents were bigger gossips than his grandmother’s bridge club. (Maria Hill asked Jason Nowicki to add a note to their personnel files; Jason Nowicki told Jenny Shaefer who told Andrea Chen who told Martin Gaydos who told
“Seriously though, these are the stupidest evil robots ever.”  Iron Man whined.  “I mean, why did they even call us in for this shit?  It’s so easy it’s like playing a video game with your eyes closed.”
“Are you going to hit me like a punching bag?” Tony asked, with one eyebrow raised.
“Yeah,” Steve said and it sounded breathless and a little surprised.  “That was . . .”
“Workshop, JARVIS.”
Tony was pretty sure that Fury chose the farthest conference room on purpose, though whether as an intimidation tactic (making them trail after him as long as possible, damn it) or to give Bruce time to calm down (sensibly enough), Tony wasn’t sure.
“Start serving yourselves, while Steve and I work on the turkey,” Mrs. Rhodes directed and they sprang into action. Tony started to eat a huge forkful of potatoes while Mrs. Rhodes’ back was turned, but when he caught sight of Natasha’s expression he set his fork back down as stealthily as possible.
Steve nodded and gave Tony a tentative smile.  He took a deep breath, then said, “I’m—I’m gonna go to the bathroom, but then . . . then maybe we could watch
“And you’re cooking,” Bruce said, glancing back and forth between them. “Together.”
Just a little teaser for the series here as epilogue.
He didn’t want to think about Tyrone. (Or Howard.)
Tony squeezed Steve’s waist tight and they stood, holding each other.
Tony slowly headed for the elevator, but couldn’t shake the feeling he’d still left something unfinished. He paused as the elevator arrived and opened almost silently, then he walked back to the coffee table again. Tony picked up one of Steve’s pencils and his notepad. (He nearly grabbed the sketchbook, but he couldn’t let himself touch it—if he did he’d cave to temptation and look at the whole thing. Whatever the press said, he wasn’t actually a total douchebag.) He flipped to the very back of the small spiral notebook for a blank page and wrote:
“No!” Tony swallowed. “I mean, uh, say, ‘thank you, but no need.’ Tell him I already ordered a pizza, so I’m all set, okay? Just working away.”
“Thanks. You too.”
“Uh,” Tony faltered.
“What,” Barton asked, still chuckling, “you don’t eat like this for every meal, man? All fancy and shit with your silver spoon?”
“I’m glad,” Steve said with a smile. “I’ll see you soon.”
Tony did not call out petulantly, “You’re going the wrong way! Come back and fuck me!” but it was a near thing.
“Here, allow me,” Tony said, stepping forward.
Steve glanced at the ceiling before he could catch himself.
Steve gave a rueful smile and shook his head. “Wasn’t a lot of time for art when I was in Europe,” Steve said softly.

Tony blinked and complied, surprised by her vehemence.

“Hey, J?” Tony called. “Send Pepper a magnum of Veuve Clicquot, would ya? And . . . and a dozen yellow roses! No, two dozen. Note to read: ‘You give the best advice.’”
“I was just thinking that I’d like to take you for a walk in Central Park, arm in arm or hand in hand,” Steve said and pressed a kiss to Tony’s hand. “And tomorrow, after we’re not keeping this a secret anymore, I can.”
“Come on, Rhodey! You’re smarter than that,” Tony said. “Of course she said no.”
“No, really—I want to know.  Who did you think I meant?”
As they approached the Brooklyn bridge, though, Tony couldn’t hold back an amused little snort and a wry, “Brooklyn, babe? Why am I not surprised?”
Tony scooted over and, after a moment’s hesitation, Steve put his arm around him. Tony curled closer and rested his cheek against Steve’s massive chest as Steve reached out to caress his hand.
Steve cleared his throat. “Better get back to work.”
“She can make her own decisions,” Tony said.
harassed him, if Rogers had “tried to pull something,” Rhodey would have believed him. Wouldn’t have made excuses for the guy or thought Tony was asking for it or made it up or was being hysterical or--
Tony smiled as he stumbled towards the bathroom. (

Tony rolled his eyes and stripped out of his workshop clothes.
Eventually, there was a gentle chime from Pepper’s phone.
“Mmm-hmm.”
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve was murmuring softly, running his fingers through Tony’s hair again. “So amazing.”
Rogers was still talking—something thanks, breakfast, coffee something something—but Tony wasn’t really listening and it must have showed because Rogers frowned and asked, with a hint of concern, “Mr. Stark?”
The knot in Tony’s stomach eased a little and Tony returned Rhodey’s smile.  “I know, right?”
“Good morning, sir. The time in Stark Tower is 9:53 am, current temperature outside fifty-seven degrees.”
,” and those words never boded well.
“Let’s eat!” Steve said, and together they started serving the food. And, now that the team knew, Tony had no trouble at all coming close. He laid a hand on Steve’s arm and tilted his head, demanding; Steve obliged, dropping a little kiss on his cheek. Tony felt a thrill. It was hardly high-level exhibitionism, but the team could see them and that made him feel good.
“Of course, Captain.”

with a little more pressure.
Tony tapped at his tablet, scowling.
“Oh, please, call me Steve,” he asked with a smile.
Tony waited.  Steve didn’t initiate anything else, but even Tony’s massive grab bag of insecurities couldn’t convince him that Steve was already bored with him, repelled by his appearance, or had changed his mind about banging such an infamous slut.  It was a little surprising for a Dom to be denying himself an orgasm, instead of somebody else, but Steve probably just needed some encouragement.  This was his first scene after all.
Tony held him tight.
decide to go to bed you might come join me.  To sleep.  You don’t have to . . . uh.”
Clint handed him a beer and Tony took a swig from the bottle.
“Won’t you excuse me?” Tony said.  “I need to go check on a few things.”
“Is this good?”
Your kudos and comments are cherished; they feed new chapters.  :-)

It was all right. It had been a good date. A
“Mmmmm-hhhm,” Tony murmured with a nod, sidling closer.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve said, looking up from his notes with a smile.  “You weren’t in the workshop when I dropped by.  Guess I know why now.”
Steve shook his head. “I think we’re ready to order. Tony?”
Tony laughed.  He couldn’t come up with a good quip to tease Cap about ‘heebie-jeebies,’ so he just said: “I don’t want to break your bones by flying in too fast.”  Tony watched with a certain wicked glee as Rogers took out the first row of zombies with a well-tossed shield then realized that he’d hardly made a dent.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Overwhelming?”
“Everybody done with dinner?” Bruce asked. They nodded. “Then I think it’s time.”
Steve drew back, focusing on the head once more, then eased forward again to let it touch his throat. He choked. (“Shhhh . . . easy, sweetheart . . . go on, try again, baby . . .”)
Thank you so much for reading!  I really appreciate it.  *collapses in a heap*
: Great! How are you?
The Captain took his cell phone from his belt. He tapped it a few times. Dom’s voice emerged:
There was a sudden blinding light, then everything went dark.
Steve bit his lip and for a second it seemed like he might leave it at that, but then words came spilling forth as if he couldn’t hold them in: “I was just looking at the pictures of us together from last night while the coffee brewed and--oh, you know those events always make me uncomfortable, being surrounded by all the swells and society! And--it’s dumb--just, in the pictures, all this--” he gestured down his body, “it
“Been a little busy.”
“Open it,” Tony urged as he climbed back into bed.
Steve shrugged. “I was angry.”
Another long pause.  Tony heard Rogers take a deep breath, then let it out a little too close to the mouthpiece.  Silence, then eventually, “All right, Mr. Stark.  Good luck.”
Steve bit his lip, hesitating.  Tony was sleeping and he
Tony let out a bitter laugh. “Yeah. Sure it could. Look, the Safehouse is still off limits.”

Tony’s glare was lost on the phone.
“Cool.”
“I think we should go through aerial evacuation lifts on our next module,” Natasha said. “We may need Iron Man to evacuate an incapacitated teammate, preferably without doing further injury.”

If you enjoy this, do consider letting me know...  Comments are cherished, adored, and feed the muse!
“Steve, I—“ Tony said.  “Look, I know I was a playboy and a manwhore, but I’ve *never* cheated on anyone.  I wouldn’t.  I—“  (And, yeah, maybe it sounds a little sharp or maybe a little defensive, and, shit, now Steve is pulling away and—)
(190.)
Rogers looked up at him from under his lashes and Tony was quick to deflect, “Though I doubt your poor StarkTab would agree. It’s not the tablet’s fault there’s crap on the internet.” Tony joked, “Don’t shoot the messenger, man!”
Fifty cups of coffee and forty-eight hours later, the bruises on Tony’s wrists were fading away and his plans for a 7:1 para-aramid body armor were shape up.  (Turns out knights thought chainmail was a pretty great invention for a reason.)
(Fuck. Had something happened to him?)
“Yeah?” Tony asked, grinning. “As a man who loves your roast chicken, I have no trouble imagining that. Oh my God, now I’m actually imagining it and it’s delicious! With pie. You make pie right? Apple pie? And, okay, now I’m hungry. You hungry? Of course you are, you’re always hungry and, look, it’s seven! How about burgers? Burgers and
Curious, Tony padded closer, coffee momentarily forgotten.
Steve sighed.  “You know sometimes, it would be really nice to eat at the table,” he said, handing a bowl to Natasha.  Steve looked at Bruce, who held his hands up in surrender and murmured, “I’m staying out of this.  Again.”
“Oh, and I’m doing a fundraiser for the Smithsonian in April.”
“I agree with Tony,” Natasha said softly.  Tony turned to her in surprise.  She quirked an eyebrow at him and continued, “Well, not in everything.  But the Hulk could be a powerful ally, almost infinitely powerful, if you can keep him on task.  On the other hand, if you lose control sometime, Bruce, and he
“Uh-huh,” Rogers said, unconvinced. “I’ll see what Bruce says.”
Tony said to come and he hadn’t yet.  A wave of anxiety washed through him and his breathing sped.  (He told you to!  Go on!)  Steve shivered and felt a hot rush of humiliation.  (Obey.  You want to!)  Steve closed his eyes tight and strained, still panting, but he couldn’t, he wasn’t—
“Well,” Steve said, smiling back, “Sam
“Pfft,” Tony scoffed, taking a step closer.  “You’d never hurt me.”
Steve let out a little sound that might be a whimper.  Tony cupped Steve’s chin and tilted his head to place a kiss, soft and delicate, on Steve’s lips. Clumsy and eager, Steve opened his mouth and chased Tony’s mouth as he pulled away.  Tony squeezed Steve’s jaw, a hard pressure just a notch below pain.
“I feel pretty fantastic.  And, well, it’s nice that you’re glad to see me.  After the way things ended at MIT, I wasn’t sure . . .”
“Now what?” an Agent asked, giving voice (whiny, irritating voice) to what Tony’d just been wondering.
“All right,” Steve said. “I’ll think it over and ask what Bruce might like.”
Steve nodded and turned to go with a soft smile and a quiet, “Looking forward to it.”
“Babe, it’s ok,” Tony said. “That’s not why I was frowning. I mean, I’m not excited about telling SHIELD because they’re assholes and I have a feeling they’re gonna give us shit, but—“ He took a deep breath. “Maybe we should just tell them. Today. Get it over with. Since they’ll find out eventually and if we

Tony smelled amazing.  Steve nearly groaned.  He closed his eyes and tried to think about something else.  Penguins.  Morgan Freeman.  Penguins.  Was Tony really dreaming about math and penguins?  Had he ever dreamed about sex with Steve?  About Steve sucking his cock?
cornered her; she’d almost certainly set it up so he thought he’d cornered her when in fact she’d been giving him an opening.  But whatever—he just wanted to say his piece without the rest of the team there.
“No worries. Maybe tomorrow?”
“We were a pair of brats, weren’t we?” Rhodey said, chuckling.
He gagged.
Steve frowned.
Cheer leading always appreciated--favorite detail? question? musings?-- but both kitty and I are actually doing pretty well right now, so it's not dire.  :)
Tony hurried forward and grabbed Steve’s arm. Steve shook him off.
“No rush, Tony.  I’m--”  Rhodey shifted and let out a little wince, then gave a wry little smile.  “Seriously, man.  No rush.”
The hostess’ eyes went wide for a split second, then her features smoothed out into a polite smile as she said, “Of course, sir. Please follow me.”
Rogers left Tony thoroughly baffled.
“Of course.  Perhaps vibrant colors mixed with yellow roses?  Yellow roses are traditionally associated with friendship.”
“I see why you’re frustrated,” Steve said. “But I also understand why Bruce is worried. The Hulk is really powerful. And I don’t think Bruce knows where he ends and The Hulk begins; that’s a scary thing. It’s not just about trusting himself. And even if it were, sometimes it’s harder to trust yourself than the people you care about.”
“—terly Report, ‘cause Steve’s coming down to the workshop soon and I—“
Rogers swallowed.  “And if a sub did--” Rogers took a deep breath.  “
Tony shook Silverstein’s hand, still trying to remember. He’d heard the name recently. (Oh! Right. Jackie. Jackie’s little birdies had commended him.)
“Sir,” JARVIS said, nearly making Tony jump. “The limo is ready when you are.  Agents Barton and Romanoff are in the elevator.”
Tony glared at Hypothetical 19, then sighed.
Pepper sighed.  “Well let me look at it, but assuming everything’s in order, when do you sign and when do they move in?”
“What do you mean, ‘mmmm?’” Tony asked indignantly, doing up the buttons on the white shirt a little more slowly.
“Fuck!” Tony jumped and flailed. “What the fucking fuck, Steve!?”
UPDATE: June 24th    I've been trying to post every 10 days or so, but it looks like chapter 26 is going to be a bit behind schedule.  Life has been pretty busy--mostly my job--and I need to make sure that I draft or outline at least four or five chapters ahead before posting 26 so I don't accidentally write myself into a corner.  Sorry for the delay!  Never fear--I'm not on the verge of hiatus or anything.  See you soon!
Originally, I planned to make Christmas one big long chapter, but it was starting to get too unwieldy so I decided to break it down.
Steve’s panic that Tony wasn’t getting anything out of their kinky sex (absurd!) had been the permission he’d needed. Tony had poured out more dirty talk, fucking Steve’s mouth hard and filthy, pushing him rougher, using his hard edges on Steve.  And, oh fuck, the way Steve had trembled under him when he’d gripped his jaw just a little too hard, or put a hint of steel in his voice.  The way Steve quivered when Tony scratched and bit at him, left a trail of red marks across his back, the way he’d bucked and moaned when Tony pinched his nipples . . . (Oh fuck!)  Steve took it so beautifully and wanted more, wanted it desperately, fiercely, urgently; the realization had left Tony just as desperate, half-dizzy and overwhelmed.
“Thanks, JARVIS.”
Little by little, Tony worked his way down Steve’s body, caressing his chest, his ribs, his stomach.  He paused, hovering over Steve’s cock, before lavishing attention on Steve’s hipbones, nipping and sucking first one then the other.  Steve tried to hold still, but his body shuddered and jerked eagerly under Tony’s attentions.  His movement pulled at the restraints—Steve moaned.
“Now Bruce and Tony. Step a little to the left.”
“Steve?”
“Fuck!  Steve!”
“Nah, I’m good,” Tony said, with a shrug. “But you go ahead.”
“Not just you,” Tony said.
“Litotes there,” Bruce muttered.
“It’s going to be hard to save room for pie!” Pepper told Natasha.
Tony smiled as he said, “They’re not tremendously sturdy.  Certainly not built for a super soldier.  Not yet anyway.”  Tony dropped his voice lower as he leaned in and said, “But you don’t really want to pull free, do you sweetheart?  You want to keep your hands right where I put them, don’t you?”
They stood, side by side, watching as the vibrant red-orange light streaked the clouds and bounced off the snow, then slowly deepened towards purple.
“You’re both looking very smart this evening,” Steve was saying to Katie.
“I’m not bad!” Tony protested.
“Mmmmm-hmmmm.”
Harris was lurking outside the conference room.  He gave a tentative smile and said, “Mr. Stark, sorry about earlier.”  He took a step like he might follow Tony down the hall.  “But I’d really--”
What should have been the second half of chapter 49.... at last!
“But you don’t have to,” Steve said softly.  “We can be together without . . . without all that.”
Trigger Warning: slut shaming, orientationism, sexism, mentions of psychological trauma, but if you've made it to chapter 29 none of that will probably surprise you by now...
glad Steve had joined them, drunken silliness and all.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Iron Man? Dr. Banner?” Rogers said over the comm. “What’s happening?”
(Yes, yes, yes . . .)
The pain eased and soon Tony drifted to sleep, curled in Pepper’s arms.
“Mom said we were good for each other,” Steve continued, “said that a little of my gentle rubbed off on him, and little of his tough rubbed off on me.” Steve smiled, adding, “And we were both already plenty stubborn to begin with.”
“Glad you’re here, Pep,” Tony said, resting his head on her knee.  “You’re the best.  It’ll all work out for you.  You’ll see.”
“I’m sorry I woke you,” Steve said, starting to fidget.
2) self-defense training (“Better,” Nat said with a slight nod. “You’ve got enough practice escaping a Tucson Hold. Back to basics: incapacitating a much bigger opponent. Clint?”)
grumbling. “I can feed myself without help, you know.”
(Damn.) He was
“ . . . and ransom captive Israel / That mourns in lonely exile here . . .”
“Tony?” he murmured. Tony's eyes fluttered open and he gave Steve an exhausted half-smile. There was a week's stubble-- almost a beard-- growing in the gaps of Tony's van dyke. But that could wait.
Okay, sure, a knee massage while Tony was completely naked, fucked out and leaking come, and three fantasy versions of Steve were waiting their turn to fuck him again, but still.  Definitely not erotic at all.
“Yes. Yes,” Tony nodded, his eyes sparking with understanding. “Disbursing weapons to the other tribal leaders under the auspices of protecting the borderlands would certainly make Ul-Tarn think twice about any kind of uprising.
But, obviously, things between him and Brock were nothing like
Steve sighed heavily and looked up from his newspaper.  “Fine, but just this once.”
“Okay.  Okay, so, I’ll see you in a bit then,” Tony said, brushing past Steve’s shoulder and heading for the glass door.
Honestly, it didn’t really matter if Tony saw it or not, did it?  It wasn’t like this gesture was really going to change anything, other than make Steve feel a bit better about the whole thing.  The point was,
“‘I’m not taking him back.  Promise.  And I’ll call, I swear.  As soon as I’m done.  He’s not even going to be home until after five, so don’t spend all your day worrying, okay?  It’s fine, really,” Steve reassured them again, glancing between Bucky’s dubious look and Nat’s inscrutable expression.
Tentatively, Steve darted his tongue into the wide channel before him, licking deep. He tasted a wild, wonderfully heady mix of his own spend, cherry, and the man’s sweaty, musky taste. He licked again, and felt the man’s ass quiver. He could hear more low, guttural moans coming from behind the wall, so he supposed this was good. Swirling his tongue, Steve caught some of the remains of his own cum and spread it around inside the man’s hole then caught his teeth just barely against the rim.
“My girlfriend, Jane Foster, you may have heard of her.  She has won many awards,” Thor said, smiling broadly.  “She hit me with her van when I was backpacking in the desert.  Complete accident, I don’t hold it against her.  She’s brilliant.  Very, very brilliant,” he added firmly.  “So, is this Rumlow fellow taken care of, then?  I was led to believe there might be a need for a good brawl, and I haven’t had a good bout for a long time, and James, here, he knows how much I love a brawl, and so here I am, but here you are, and you look good Steve, truly, you do.  It’s good to see you, my friend.  All my friends, really, though I don’t know you, but I’m sure we will get along just fine, if you’re a friend of Steve’s.”
“If you see Calvin, ask Victor to tell him I’ll be along shortly,” Whitney called out, receiving a sort of flat smile and nod of agreement in return.
“If it will help, I’m in, Tony.  I told you, I’m in this, too, now, so—I want to help,” Steve told him.  “The videos…is that going to be a problem? For you, I mean?”
Warning for lots of porn and improper use of biology and anatomy.  Enjoy!
“I thought it was a great angle, sue me,” Tony replied, pulling the phone back to his ear.
Steve’s room wasn’t what Tony would have expected, if he had really given much thought to it beyond the initial panic that he might end up there.  Once that subsided, it just sort of became little more than a vague notion of a bedroom.  On the other hand, if he
A king who commands no one.  A vain man who is only assured of his superiority by being alone.  A drunkard who drinks to forget the shame of being a drunkard.  A businessman who spends his days counting the stars instead of appreciating them.  A lamplighter who so blindly follows, he extinguishes the very light he creates.
Even the hard parts were easy.  He wasn’t sure it was supposed to be like that, but he had an answer if someone asked him what made him happy, and he couldn’t make himself pick it apart just because they weren’t broken when they were together and neither of them knew what to do with that.
, though he supposed that was likely a part of it, but it was more the absence of something.  Someone. Whatever it was, the emptiness was there because of Shellhead. Because of what they had done last night.  A shiver ran through him at the thought, and Steve stopped long enough to scan the tide again, but saw nothing that hinted that Shellhead was lurking around.
“How did you--JARVIS, that you, buddy?” Tony asked hesitantly.  The helmet’s eyes glowed the same strange, pinkish color as the not-gel instead of their usual ice blue.
He could feel the alien’s gaze on him, watching him with a careful, studious look.  Something warm and hard settled against Tony’s entrance. A slick, oily wetness followed, coating his rim and jetting inside of his hole.  Then, a blunt pressure stretching him with a burning pull that made him hiss out a harsh breath. He grunted at the intrusion, and, instinctively, Tony tried to shift against the tension, find some kind of better position, but he was held too tightly in place by the not-gel to do much of anything.  It didn’t hurt. Whatever it was. Not really. Just felt strange.
, so...so it was a stupid idea, really.
“I’m texting him,” Rhodey said.
“Dom, man, come on,” Malcolm hissed.  “Don’t make it worse,” he urged, then cleared his throat and looked at Steve, pulling himself up a bit straighter.  “It wasn’t his idea, Sir.  It was mine. I made him do it. It was all me.”
“I am sure it is very beautiful,” Steve agreed. Tony cocked his head to the side and regarded him, tapping lightly on the table as he did.
“Maybe there were a few things that needed correcting,” Steve said.
“It wouldn’t have changed anything, if you’d been there,” Steve said.
“No, you’re not,” Tony argued in a low, raw whisper.
“Your heart’s always been plenty big, Tony, I told you.  You only took into that cave the tools you already had,” Steve replied.
Maybe this whole pretending to be happy thing wasn’t going to be so hard after all, Tony thought dazedly.
A little to Tony’s surprise, the guy whirled around in one, smooth motion, grabbing a garbage can lid mid-whirl and looking like he was about to either duck behind it or take a swing with it when his face went from a fairly intense frown to surprised curiosity.  Nice reflexes, Tony noted admiringly as he slowly set Covi down a few feet in front of Hot Roof Guy.
“Come on,” Tony all but whined.
“Might throw up on you, but I think I can make it,” Steve answered as he stood up. Or, Tony assumed he did. Hard to tell, Tony thought with a huff of a laugh.
Tony shut the phone off and walked back out in the hallway.  He could hear Barnes’ voice before he even got to Steve’s door.
“Tony,” Steve said, drawing out the word.
What?
“My commander said much the same.  Except with the wonderful or brave parts,” Steve replied with a low chuckle.
…the things he did with it, things Tony had never dreamed someone would do to him, but Steve seemed to absolutely
“Thanks,” Tony replied.  He walked over to the counter by the stove and poured himself a cup of coffee, then took his seat opposite Steve.  “Looks good,” he observed.
Steve angled his aching cock, brushing the head up and down the seam of the ass, catching it against the hole. Even that friction felt amazing. He lined himself up, and slowly, started to push his cock inside the gaping hole. He was big, he knew that, and sometimes it was a problem, but not here. Not in this room. The hole stretched obscenely around his girth, the delicate skin of the rim reddening then paling as Steve pushed in. It was a beautiful sight. He held himself there, just for a moment, letting the hole stretch around him. He could imagine how that felt to whoever it was on the other side. That burn. That feeling of impossibility. That moment of question. The sense of being so incredibly full you could feel it in your throat. And then…
fine water,” Tony said with more than a little fondness in his voice, making Steve realize he must have spoken his thoughts out loud.  “Slowly now.  Not so fast.  There you go.”
“I…didn’t say that,” Steve corrected.
Ah, home sweet home.
They don’t know.  They can’t see it, he reminded himself.  It’s safe.  He was safe.  He was.  There was no reason to be reacting like this.  None, he told himself firmly, scrubbing his hand over his face and swallowing thickly past a suddenly dry mouth.  This was ridiculous.  They were just tourists, taking in the sight of him and Steve just as much as any other spectacle Vegas had to offer, exactly as they were supposed to do.  This was the whole point of the evening. Hell, everything was going right, God-damn it.  Better than right, thanks to Steve and his little stunt back there.  Not exactly sticking to the plan, but it had hardly been a catastrophe, and now, he was fucking losing it all over again because---because—
I said on tumblr that this smut thing needed 100K of backstory and then 100K of fix-it.  Basically, Steve rescued Tony from Schmidt when they were boys.  Tony and Steve have pretty much loved each other their whole lives.  Tony is marrying because of politics and Steve is dealing with that about as well as one would expect.  Since there are no planes to jump out of, he marries Pierce.  Tony is having NONE OF THAT, THANKS.
“This is entirely unrelated to…what you are suggesting,” Tony said.
“You’re bluffing,” Tony scoffed.
“God, Steve,” Tony moaned, his dark eyes finding Steve’s own.  He pulled back his hips, then thrust in again in a long, slow slide, then repeated the motion, harder this time, his eyes pinning Steve in place.
“Count,” Tony barked sharply.
Careful searches on the computer led to the discovery that he had full Internet access and his bank card worked just fine on anything he wanted to order.  He bought something called “How to Please Your Alpha:  An Omega’s Guide to Happiness,” and then, when that went off without a hitch, “Your Omega Body,” which said it was restricted and required an Alpha passcode to order, but the confirmation popped up on his screen as soon as he entered the bank card number.  Steve had apparently let the computer remember  his Alpha passcode for ease of ordering, bless his trusting soul.  The book arrived two days later in a manila envelope. Tony tossed that aside and promptly downloaded as many electrical and mechanical engineering texts as the computer could handle.
“Clea’s a cat,” the other man said helpfully, then turned to his friend and raised his eyebrows.  “You’re lucky Zola didn’t send you back to Etta on the first ship.”
, Steve replied.
“It’s fine, I got this,” Tony cut in, giving Steve a quick, reassuring glance.
“Stop,” Steve huffed.
“Tony,” Steve said, putting down the menu and walking over to grasp Tony’s shoulders in both hands.  “Hey.  Hey, it’s okay,” Steve soothed.
“This shouldn’t have worked, you know?  It’s crazy, right? If I think back on it, I mean, God, Steve, how’d this ever work out?” Tony asked, only half serious.  “Do you ever wonder? One thing different, and none of this would’ve happened. We’d never have made it here. But, here we are. How’d that happen?  Why us? Of all the people out there, with the insane way all this started, how’d we end up here?”
A strong profile, Steve thought.  Striking.  The beard wasn’t to hide gout or a second chin, but rather because it suited the face.  Full lips, a straight nose and eyes just slightly too wide set.  For the first time in months, Steve fingers itched for a stick of coal and a bit of parchment to see if he could capture the King’s features with any degree of skill.  He would need to convey motion, Steve thought to himself.  The King was almost always moving, gesturing, talking, expressive in everything he did.  He wondered if he could get the eyes right.  The fierce intelligence there, the constant calculation, coupled with a heady dose of interest and challenge, and an unexpected softness, almost brittle in how transient it sometimes seemed, like one wrong word or move could shatter it, and the occasional waspish hardness that seemed to drop over the King’s features like a portcullis.
Tony’s nerves seemed to be vibrating under his skin, his gaze darting around, bile souring his stomach.  He should have told Steve sooner. At the hotel before the press conference. Last night. Over breakfast. In the car.  So many chances. And of course, he hadn’t, because he had wanted to do it just the right way, at just the right time, when he had reinforcements and could walk Steve through it all, step by step.  The way Tony had trusted Obie since he was a kid, relied on Obie after the death of his parents, how easy it had been to believe the man he considered family when Obie said this was just a tax thing, how it made him feel like part of a team when Obie said the company needed him to build something, and why he never questioned the timing of those requests coming so quickly on heels of being asked to sign something he hadn’t actually read or given much thought to before doing it and getting back to the real work, the things he wanted to do, the things he thought were what mattered, not those pesky details like wondering why he never saw any of those transactions he was approving showing up in their corporate filings.   It was a tax thing. The accountants, the lawyers, they were handling it. Obie was
“Please,” Steve moaned, still unsure what he was asking, but the release of just asking for it was enough for now. “Please, Tony.” Tony surged hard up against him, mouth slamming onto Steve’s. Tony’s hands dropped from Steve’s face to run down his shoulders and clutch at the back of Steve’s tunic, digging in where the scar tissue had stiffened and bunched the muscles. Steve’s mind registered the sting of pain there, but it hardly seemed to matter with Tony pressing against him, his mouth opening over Steve’s, tongue pushing in to claim Steve’s mouth.
“Ah, this must be the famed Raj’Inama,” the man next to Tony said as he approached the opposite side of the table.
Steve watched the man with a strangely intense fascination.  His eyes weren’t what they used to be, too milky and translucent these days to catch everything the way they once had, but, as rude as it was, he couldn’t seem to tear his gaze away, and so he didn’t, indulging himself for the moment in something so utterly out of place as the man’s appearance on this night.  It had been a long time--a very long time--since something unexpected happened to him.  How long?  He tried to think back, but his thoughts from before the War were murky, as they always were--except for the ones from childhood, which were perhaps the clearest of them all. He thought maybe it was then that he last felt like this, all mystified and rattled, though he couldn’t recall why that would have been so.
The evening seemed . . .
Tony wasn’t sure how long he’d been working, when he heard Steve begining to stir. Steve’s eyes fluttered open and his gaze immediately fell on Tony. His lips curled up into a beautiful sleepy smile and he murmured, “Tony?”
Tony didn’t mind.
“So, how've you been, Steve?” Rhodey asked. “What's new?”
Steve’s ears went pink and he gazed down intensely and Tony started to hope that he’d—
Tony’s hands scrabbled at the uniform as he nipped and kissed, gasping out “I’m sorry” and “I love you” and “
But Steve had barely seen Stark. And it seemed like lately every time Bruce would ask JARVIS to please ask Tony to join them--for a meal or a picture or something--JARVIS answered that "Sir is unavailable" or "Sir is otherwise engaged" or (just once) "Sir regrets he is unable to join you." And Bruce would frown and mutter under his breath. And sometimes he'd go down to the workshop and come back sad and a little angry or he'd not come back at all.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “Not that I don’t appreciate it, just, it’s hardly going to feel more like a real
Tony shook himself. “I’m on it!” he yelled, and took off after the creatures, as a red, white, and blue blur leapt the perimeter and made chase.
Tony slid down the bed to kneel with alacrity as Steve hurried to stand beside him.  Steve fumbled urgently with his belt buckle, but Tony batted his unsteady hands away.  He made short work of Steve’s belt, trousers, and briefs, sliding them down Steve’s legs just enough to free his cock.  (Next time, Tony’d draw things out, show off, make it long and torturously good, but now he just wanted to see Steve shake apart.)
,” Bruce said, “You know we’re going to have to watch the next two movies.”
In the drawing, a muscular man was kneeling naked with his wrists bound behind his back in thick, heavy loops of rope.  His legs were spread wide, his back to the viewer, giving an enticing view of the glorious swell of his ass, the elegant curve of his spine, the impressive expanse of his broad shoulders.  The man was situated in front of a mirror, so that his bowed head, flushed cheeks, and bedroom eyes were still visible, his gaze lowered.
(Tony would
The fake cock was wet and heavy in his mouth. Steve focused on relaxing his throat and eased slowly forward, very carefully sliding it towards the back of his throat.
Steve laughed. “That sounds great,” he said, then added, “But should we maybe go up and see the others? They like Star Trek. And it’s been 36 hours— pretty soon they may think I’m holding you captive.”
“Sir?” JARVIS said, volume at minimum. He startled Tony anyway.   “Captain Rogers asks if you will be joining the team for dinner and, if not, whether he may bring a tray to the workshop.”
(Yeah. So, time to set up a third date!)
(And fuck, oh fuck, why the fuck don’t I shut up?)   It was like he was puking up words, couldn’t hold them in, and next thing he knew he’d blurted:  “Even
“It’s a line from a Renaissance poem by John Donne,” Steve explained. “He wakes up with his submissive and fantasizes about leaving the world because the whole world is contained in his beloved. I thought it was beautiful.” A pause, then Steve grinned. “And when I was thirteen Donne’s ‘To His Submissive Going to Bed’ was pretty racy reading material for me, you know.”
Before Tony could find a way to pick another fight, Steve blurted, “We should get pizza.”
“Probation? What’s to stop you taking over my home and then stamping me ‘not recommended’ again?”
“Tony,” he corrected, and Rogers’ eyes went wide. “My friends call me Tony. So, yeah. I mean, we’re teammates and friends, so, yeah, you should . . . you should call me Tony.”
Tony felt a swoop of familiar disappointment. He knew what came next.
Hope you enjoy the new chapter! Any favorite bits? Let me know? :)
Ms. Potts examined his face intently.  The silence stretched between them. Steve wondered how long they’d just stand there.  At last Ms. Potts spoke: “You might try letting Tony be Tony. And leaving him alone.”
that, but suddenly I just felt . . . it felt real.”  Steve squeezed his eyes shut and felt a tear roll slowly down his cheek.  He wouldn’t move to wipe it away.
“Well, it is—” a pause, “2 am.  I thought it was an emergency.”
Harry Silverstein hurried over to join them.
Bruce huffed.
Tony smiled.
“Good, fine,” Tony said, squinting at the video feed. “What’s up?”
When Tony got to his feet, Rogers looked up, startled.
“Hello,” the Captain says, entering to rapturous applause. He sits down, shaking Colbert’s hand. “It’s very nice to be here.”
“Tacky crap,” Natasha muttered.
“It’s a strange land I’ve come to,” Tony said wonderingly.
” and they were kissing again, long and lingering and tender. Finally freed, Tony wrapped Steve in his arms and savored the opportunity to caress his back, neck, hair.
(Shivering, curled in a little ball, muttering, “so stupid . . . I’m sorry, I’m sorry . . . stupid, stupid, stupid.”  “Sir?  Sir!?  SIR!?”)
Steve set his mug on the nightstand to look inside.
“All right, Mr. Stark,” he said, still looking a little baffled.  “Please keep me informed.”
And Steve tried hard to mean it.
“Pardon?” Steve said, cocking his head to the side. “You mean that he’d . . . paint on my body?”
Steve thought about some of the videos he’d seen on the internet, where the men had seemed by turns cruel and vindictive, their behavior degrading and humiliating.  He’d still been hard watching those videos, but they left him with a sick sort of churning in his stomach.  It looked more like abuse or rape than lovemaking.  (“You don’t deserve my cock, you stupid whore . . . I’m gonna fuck you ‘til you bleed whether you want it or not, you pathetic piece of shit . . .”)  Steve shuddered.  His research had assured him it was all pretend, all consensual, and nobody had been hurt (thank God!), but it had left him feeling gross and unwilling to touch his cock, a little ill to find he was still hard.  (He’d stopped exploring videos after that.)
Thank you for your patience!  And thanks to my magical betas without whom I'd be lost.
“Oh, let’s call it what it is--” Tony said with a grin, “a hostile takeover.”
And there had been a point not that long ago when Tony would have thought his whole “just a poor kid from Brooklyn” line was false modesty or a jab at Tony for his wealth and privilege. Now he knew Steve meant every word, neither proud nor ashamed, just stating a fact as he saw it.
. . . I need you . . . Take me!”)
Steve sat down on the floor next to Tony facing the door to the en suite bathroom and a chest of drawers with a huge mirror above it. It looked oddly blank from this angle, reflecting nothing but the dark, cloudy sky out the windows.
“Nice to meet you, Captain Rogers,” Mrs. Rhodes said politely.
“Phasers?” Rogers said with a little frown.
Rogers brightened. “Of course! Shall I bring it down when it’s ready?”
After a few moments, though, Tony shook his head. “I think I’d better head home.”
“Doctor,” Johnny said quietly.
“Honestly,” Steve continued, “I’d think less of Fury if he hadn’t talked to us.  But to . . . to try and meddle with what we have, in the absence of any wrongdoing, that’s not. . . that’s . . .”
(Mad. He’s trying to drive me mad with pleasure.)
“Yeah.” Steve grinned. “But you cut him instead. Cut him dead.”
“Hi, Tony,” Pepper said, face flickering up on a screen. “How are you?”
Tony didn’t know what to say to that, so he reached out to pinch off a piece of the piecrust and popped it into his mouth. (Mmm. Buttery.) Mrs. Rhodes scowled.
Rogers smiled. “That’s kind. But, no. No, thank you.” Rogers let out an uneasy little laugh and joked, “I mean, if I can fight aliens, I can mingle and make small talk, right?”
Steve approached slowly, expression that guilty-hesitant-earnest look Tony hadn’t seen in quite a while.
Tony threw back his head and laughed.
“Were you right?” Tony asked, leaning into her space. “Did you have a good read on your mark?”
“Wish I had some of our duets on video,” Pepper added, sounding amused. “For private consumption only, of course.”
“Mr. Stark, please allow me to introduce myself,” he said. “I’m Steve Rogers and I—”
“Thanks, J!”  Tony turned to Bruce, trying to hold in his relief.  He aimed for an apologetic expression. “Well, I’d better go start getting ready!  You can stay here and work a little longer if you like. I’ve just got some other stuff to wrap up.”
“Mmm-hmm,” Clint murmured and raised an eyebrow.  Tony narrowed his eyes, noticing the way that Steve fumbled to start serving chili, turning his back on the team so they couldn’t see his expression or, more likely, his blush.  (Damn.  Might need to lay some ground rules.  Like no teasing Steve about sex.  Or gay stuff.)
Would they tell the team they were going on a date? It was just a date—not like they needed to make a big announcement! It would be weird to tell them like it was a

None of the vintages were familiar to Tony—all far too modest—but he knew varietals and regions well enough to have a suggestion that Steve might like. (Nothing too acidic or complex…)
(Shit.)

“Oh, honestly, Tony,”  Steve said with affectionate exasperation.
“I’d like that,” Tony said, leaning over to give Steve a kiss. He glanced around, then exclaimed, “Ooh! We should hang the blue Picasso right there!”
“Good luck!” Pepper called. Tony waved as the hatch closed and Rhodey darted onboard.
Tony’s brow furrowed and he looked up at Steve with a slight frown. “Are you okay?”
“You talking to the coffee?” Steve teased.
Tony shrugged again. “I’ve never cared for the wet sciences.” He wrinkled his nose.
“Tony, I, uh,” Steve mumbled.  “I’m really tired.”
Tony dropped his face in his hands.
From across the ballroom, Tony saw Pepper was in deep conversation with two people. Pepper towered over the younger woman; the older man towered over Pepper. Tony might have passed them by, but he saw Pepper’s eyes were bright with the enthusiasm of exciting business deals or new friends. He approached.
up here?” Steve asked, head down still refusing eye-contact. He was shivering.
“Ok, sure,” Bruce shrugged. “It was just a thought.”
. Mind if I join you?”
Steve nodded frantically.
“I haven’t forgotten,” Cap said, the beginnings of his Stubborn Look creeping over his face, “but that’s no reason to always stick you with the bill. I have a job. I’m not some. . . some--”
“Some of it has been successfully returned,” Tony said tentatively after a moment of melancholy silence. “The Klimt portraits of Adele Bloch-Bauer were returned to her descendants.”
Plenty of girls had tried to give him their numbers before—sometimes
“No way.  Gonna be great.  And we’ve got the Security Blanket for extra back-up! Not that we’ll need it. At least, I hope not.”
He heard Tony uncap the bottle again.  Tony’s fingers returned slick and wet, to stroke his crack with long, slow touches.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Of course, sir.”
Tony was still gasping and heaving as Steve lifted his head, a dazed expression on his face and Tony’s cum leaking from the corner of his mouth.
“Mmm?”
“No!” Tony cried. He slapped Steve on the arm. “Don’t. Don’t let him.”
Tony inspected his goatee and plucked a few stray (grey) hairs, then decided to ditch the tie and unbutton the top two buttons of his dress shirt. He had a strong jaw line still (thank God), and a good neck, slim and long. He’d been told he had a delicate throat—the kind a Dom daydreamed about collaring—and he wasn’t above flaunting it. (Never mind that Steve had seen him in a messy, scoop-necked wife-beater plenty of times; it wasn’t the same. This was a
“He’s not a pet!” Tony said indignantly. “He’s a helper bot. And not a very helpful one.”
After Steve’s
Tony’s heart leapt.  (Steve!  I--)  Tony was still struggling, fumbling around for words, when Steve kissed his cheek again and pulled away.  He glanced around.
“Okay.  One, two,
“Huh?”
Steve pulled away and sat up with a sigh.
“Wow! Thanks, man.”
Tony laughed.  “Yeah, good luck with that!”
“Dr. Banner, your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. It's a pleasure to meet you.  At last.”  Tony dropped into the chair next to him and shook his hand.  “How the hell did these idiots get you?  Seriously, whatever they're offering I can give you triple.  Who'm I kidding?  I can give you whatever you want.  You, me, and twelve floors of R&D to play in!”
Clint nodded. “Asshole,” he repeated.
“Would you really?” Tony asked, tilting his head to look up through his lashes. (Things just might be looking up for the evening.)

“I’d say that’s understandable,” she said with a shrug, then added matter-of-factly, “He wants to impress you.”
“Coming!”  Tony laughed.  “Well,” he said to Steve.  “I guess that’s our cue. Unless you’ve changed your mind and want to stay in to ravish me instead.”
“Damn straight!” Tony cried.
“Sure, Clint,” Steve said. “Sounds like a good idea.”
When they reached Conference Room 22—Natasha got the door for the entire team—Fury, Hill, and an unknown Domme in a suit were already there waiting. Everyone exchanged bland greetings, then took their seats. (Tony pulled out his own chair, thank you very much.) Hill introduced the glossy looking Domme as “Melinda Alexis Carmichael, PR Consultant.”
“I said it's not okay.” Steve had that mulish look on his face, pinched at the corner of his mouth.
through our paces.”
Tony laughed.  But Steve looked terribly serious.
Steve smiled at Tony, then stroked his cheek.
Twenty minutes later, that itchy feeling hadn’t gone away.
“Tony, I said everything all out of order and I’m sorry.” Steve seemed to struggle for a moment before continuing, “I’ve been selfish and I’m so sorry.”  (Huh?)  “I had no idea what I was asking of you, and then I started thinking and I suddenly realized,” Steve looked away, shamefaced, and his voice dropped, “I never even asked you if you want this.”  Steve waved the book in his hand.  In almost a whisper, Steve repeated: “I never even asked.”
“You forgot your scotch.”
Tony stretched. “Morning, J,” he said around a yawn, trying to remember when he’d gone to bed. The three of them had binged on five—no, six—episodes of
“Good day, Captain.”
(Oh fuck.) Tony let out a helpless little noise against Steve's chest. (Shit. Don't say it. Not out loud. Don't--)

Rogers and Bob, Bob and Rogers.  Two frustrating puzzles for which he was clearly missing key data points.
Steve held his breath when he heard Tony’s soft footsteps in the hall.  (Had it even been ten minutes?)
California was good for him. It felt soothing to be helpful (even if he suspected Pepper was giving him harmless busywork).
He said nothing.
The elevator opened silently and the deep rumble of Rhodey’s laughter immediately greeted him. Tony padded quietly down the hall then froze in shock at the sight before him.
“Good morning,” Rogers said, looking up to smile at him.
Rhodey just rolled his eyes.
“I’m not gonna like this project, am I?” Tony said.
“Merry Christmas.”
“PR?” Tony asked, shooting Fury a dirty look. “Really? And you couldn’t give us a heads up? You know I have an entire PR department.”
“All right!” Tony said, settling in the middle of the couch and handing them each a bowl of salad. “Let’s boldly go! JARVIS, roll it!”
