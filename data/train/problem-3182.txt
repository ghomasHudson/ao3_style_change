Dean hasn't so much as twitched and Castiel takes a long moment to appreciate every detail of the way the omega looks. Thanks to Meg he's been cleaned from head to toe and still smells faintly of the soap she used. Castiel's grateful, and not just for the obvious reasons. Dean's been positioned onto his stomach and the sight of so much pale skin mottled by bruises of various colors makes Castiel's mouth water. He traces the pattern of them with his eyes, just barely tamping down on the urge to lean in and lick the path of them. Even the omega's cock, just barely visible between the slight spread of his thighs is a deep purplish color that has Castiel practically salivating. There's no doubt--he's going to enjoy this.
The diner was well-lit on the inside with plain beige walls and a scattering of small round tables and chairs that looked like they’d come straight out of a 90’s sitcom. That seemed to be the theme of the place, or something very close to it as Gabe opened the door only to be greeted by the sounds of Seal’s “Crazy” playing across the speakers. He blinked, a little startled, but ultimately pleased by the choice. Anyplace that played 90’s pop music couldn’t be bad in his opinion! Beyond that, there was something oddly comforting in the music that had him un-tensing for the first time since he’d woken from that horrible nightmare.
yourself?! You think you can just come down here and we can ‘take care’ of someone as powerful as Asmodeus?! Do you have any idea what that sick freak did to me?! He used me! He stripped me naked and--” He abruptly cut off, just noticing for the first time the way tremors had begun running along his extremities. It took several hard swallows before he went on, though his voice was noticeably quieter now. “He--he tortured me. For..for days! Until…” He trailed off, waving a hand weakly to indicate himself, unable to put it into words.
Watching Sam capitulate so easily made some of the tension ease in Dean’s shoulders. He didn’t want to fight with Sam--he wasn’t John, and therefore wasn’t the proverbial enemy. “I know,” He sighed, shoulders lowering a fraction. “It
This was...it was too much. Dean was beyond floored and he honestly didn’t know what to do about any of this. Bobby wasn’t wrong; becoming the leader of his own garrison of angels someday had been Dean’s dream for some time. But
Castiel thinks and gives in, letting his alpha side take control. He leans in and captures Dean’s lips in a heated kiss. The omega is unresistant, frozen underneath him and it makes Castiel hunger for him even more. “You’re mine.” He growls out, eyes ringed in red and full of possessiveness. “I’m going to make sure everyone who lays eyes upon you knows it.”
It took a little over a full day on Earth for Dean to transform the pile of bones and rotting flesh back into a fully functional human body, minus the soul. It had remained clung to him, seemingly oblivious to what Dean was doing. The angel hadn’t minded considering he didn’t know what the protocol was for taking care of souls. In the end he had decided to let it simply be beyond talking to it occasionally. By the time the body was ready for the soul Dean was grateful none of his brothers had shown up to witness this. Somewhere along the line he’d begun humming and had effectively rocked the soul in his wings like he was handling a human babe. Dean’s brethren would have something to say about the position for sure, and he did his best to shove it out of his mind as he slowly unfurled his wings from around the soul.
tired. A nap would probably do him good plus it got him out of answering questions he really didn’t want too…
Chapter warning: The first part of this chapter contains a disturbing and creepy nightmare. Non-con, some mentions of torture is mentioned later on in the chapter.
Dean’s still on the bathroom floor when Meg finds him sometime later. He’s still panting, sweating, and a miserable mess. The heat, and it’s most definitely a heat despite what Dean thinks, has grown worse. His body is begging for release and since he can’t move the way he needs to it’s translated into him humping the bathroom floor in a futile bid for relief. A small rational part of his mind knows he should be humiliated to have Meg see him this way but the bigger part of him doesn’t have the energy to care.
The sour sad scent of Meg intensified leaving Dean struggling not to sneeze but he still caught her quiet voice when she said: “Okay.” All the air in Dean’s lungs exhaled in a quiet rush of relief. Despite her being complacent in whatever game Castiel was playing Dean still wished her the best.
That isn’t to say it’s as easy said as done. He stiffened up quite a bit in the intervening hours between Castiel beating him down and now which makes even the smallest movement painful. Dean hisses and moans, bottom lip firmly caught between his teeth as he slowly shifts his way off the bed. God, but he
The club... just thinking about it made Gabriel shudder and he swore the temperature in the car dropped several degrees. Despite there being half a country between there and here and a year to dull the memories Gabriel still remembered it all in sharp clarity. The bulked up bouncer with sharp pointed teeth that screamed ‘vampire!’; the buxom dark haired woman who knew what she was doing as she led him down a dark hallway; the sinister smile of the man in the white suit who’d shown up just as Gabriel orgasmed… Shame burned hot and fast down his neck as he unwillingly remembered the way the man had screamed about him raping his best girl and the unorthodox deal that had followed. Bile rose up his throat as he remembered the things the man had made him do, had
“Great!” Meg beams at him and goes to stand, carefully pulling him up with her. It’s a bit awkward cause of all Dean’s hardware but they finally make it and Meg offers him another grin once they’re both up. “Okay, I’m going to start filling the tub and then go straighten the bed covers for afterwards.” She says, gaze pointedly looking at the way Dean’s squirming tellingly now that he’s back on his feet again. “Just give me a call when it’s ready!”  And with that she reaches down to turn on the taps before turning and heading back into the bedroom, tossing a wink over her shoulder as she goes.
Clarity kicks in sharp and crystal clear as glass and the horror of what’s about to happen sends Dean’s brain into a screaming panic. He freezes, heart jack-knifing behind his ribs even as bile creeps up his throat. No. Oh no.
Luckily for him the motel was located on the fringes of a small town and within minutes Gabriel found himself walking along a darkened street. At first glance the place seemed to be one of those everything-shuts-down-at-nine p.m. types of places considering everything he passed was closed. Not that there was much: an old-styled brick bank, a towering court house, and a smattering of small businesses ranging from a laundromat to one of those hipster cafes that seemed to be everywhere nowadays. Gabriel rolled his eyes at the kitschy name--Brew HA HA!--as he passed, though if given the choice he definitely could have gone for some coffee about now. Sadly, the place was as closed as the rest of them, dark and decidedly empty. Shrugging his shoulders in defeat, Gabriel continued on his way.
Dean frowned, obviously confused. Had he gotten something wrong? “My superior, Bobby, said you needed help with the demon Asmodeus.”
“No problem, friend-o!” Garth reassured, pleased. Maybe he wasn’t doing as bad as he thought he was.
thinking about hooking up with his little brother’s ex, he leaned forward towards the guy. “Oh yeah?” He narrowed his eyes as he gave the guy a blatant once-over. “I don’t recall seeing you before. What’s your name?”
“Oh hon, he’d be stupid not to want to keep you! Have you seen you? You’re way more adorable than he described to me!” Meg reached out and bopped him on the nose. “Bottom line: yes he wants to keep you and yes that’s why you’re here. As for the why, why not? Like I said you’re cute as a box of babies or whatever. He’d be stupid not to want to keep you!”
Also I'm not a medical expert by any means but I do not recommend trying to feed someone who hasn't eaten in quite a while chicken noodle soup like Meg does in this chapter.
Compared to the eternity it took to get to the crossroads the way back was accomplished in no time at all. Before Castiel was prepared for it he found himself pulling back into the familiar parking lot at the hotel. There he simply turned off the car and stared at his and Gabriel’s hotel door without truly seeing it. What if he’d somehow failed and Gabriel was still dead? Part of him was demanding to go see immediately but the bigger part of him hesitated. The only thing worse than selling his soul would be finding out it was all for naught; Castiel didn’t think he could bear it. If it turned out to be true he wouldn’t have to wait to find out first hand what Hell was like--he’d eat a bullet right there and get it over with. The demon he’d made acquaintances with would be thrilled, he thought idly as he continued staring into space.
The pungent scent of distressed omega is filling the room making it reek and the walls are closing in and Dean can’t breathe.
Yeah, no. It was bad enough that Dean felt like this, he didn’t need the anxiety of a possible rejection if he managed to explain it only to find out that Castiel didn’t feel the same. “Have you ever been before? To the Blue Parrot?”
He thought miserably as he stared out the window at the passing scenery. Since he'd ridden to the club with Castiel in the first place Hannah had arranged for a car to pick him up to take him home.
“If only Cassie could see me now!” Gabriel remarked to no one as he climbed over the front seat to settle in the driver’s seat. He’d all but ran out their pitiful stash of money in the first month, drinking it away like it’d be enough to free his brain of the memories. Unfortunately he’d found there wasn’t enough booze to bleach out the instant replay of Castiel being mauled to death by an invisible hound. Gabriel squirmed in the seat, barely repressing the shudder running up his spine. Four months on and still there mere thought made him want to pee his pants from sheer fear. “Jesus! Get ahold of yourself Gabe!” He muttered darkly as he brought a hand up to scrub through his hair. The strands were greasy and gross but that was what happened when you didn’t have access to things like bathrooms and showers.
More than anything else the fact that Gabriel used his full name shocked Castiel into listening. Gabriel was a man full of ridiculous nicknames and usually called Castiel everything except his actual name. The fact that he was willing to use his name now was both shocking and just proved the seriousness of his words. Silently, Castiel nodded. He was willing to let it drop...for now. Somewhere down the line he was sure he’d get to the truth of the matter.
Mind made up, he kept on going. There, just shy of a hundred feet of him was another alley jutting back between two older style brick buildings. The buildings weren’t what caught Dean’s eye though; no, it was the giant green metal dumpster situated midway down the alley. While it was hardly his first choice of accommodations it was looking better and better by the moment. Unconsciously Dean found himself drawn towards it like a moth to the flame.
They spent the next twenty minutes in companionable silence and comfort. It went a long way to easing some of Dean’s frayed nerves. In truth he knew he wasn’t ready to go back to work; even putting aside the paleness, the blood-shot eyes, and the lingering exhaustion, Dean felt like warned over crap. Everything in him begged for him to go burrow back under the blankets until he felt better. He wasn’t wrong when he told Benny he needed to go back today. Heat leave is a mandated requirement for all omegas, but it’s also only supposed to last four to five days…Not eight. Dean was messed up like that; had been since he presented, yet there wasn’t anything he could do about it. He couldn’t change his biology no matter how much he may have wanted to. The only thing he could do was live with it and try to make the most of it, no matter how much it may suck.
He hummed, not wanting to open his eyes. As long as he didn’t he could believe it was true whether or not it actually was. Sadly his peace was shattered when an unfamiliar female voice spoke up somewhere near his left side: “Rise and shine sunshine!”
“I will.” Dean promised, mustering up a smile. He didn’t see his brother’s cause for concern since he and Castiel had a great time last night, but he was willing to roll with it. Sam certainly wasn’t John and a supportive (and overbearing at times) brother was a hell of a lot better than a dad who screamed at him. “I know,” he smirked, “and I’ll be happy to provide you with all the sordid details!” He and Castiel hadn’t gotten that far though Dean wasn’t complaining. As much as the alpha turned his crank, he was okay with taking things slow, especially as Sam kept reminding him, it had been a while.
He squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to see. Finally he dared to peek...and immediately wished he hadn’t. Wrapped around the delicate skin of his ankle was a solid steel cuff attached to an equally solid looking chain. Dean swore, his voice barely audible as he slowly moved his leg in closer to the rest of his body. Up close the cuff was worse than he thought--it was roughly five inches wide and there was no keyhole or any way to remove it that Dean could see. He gulped, feeling the hot swell of tears building behind his eyes.
“Hey there handsome,” They say softly, one hand resuming the gentle stroking through Dean’s hair. “I bet you’re feeling uncomfortable, huh?” They ask and in another life Dean would have snorted because that’s an understatement if he’d ever heard one. Hannah must catch the meaning behind his look anyway for their face breaks into a big grin. “Right, stupid question, huh?” They say with a gentle laugh that’s music to Dean’s ears. He still doesn’t have a clue as to what’s going on--why they’re here in the first place--but he finds he doesn’t care. They’re here, and they’re touching him gently and really that’s all that matters in the moment.
Sleep must have claimed him for the next time Dean opened his eyes the sky was starting to lighten with the coming dawn. Feeling more than half frozen he slowly uncurls himself from the dumpster and makes to stand. To his profound relief he doesn’t feel as shaky as he did the night before as he slowly makes his way to the mouth of the alley. Dean stops before he reaches the opening, however, and stares, dumbstruck. The world had awoken while he was sleeping apparently for where there was no one around the night before the streets are now alive with people.
Glancing at the clock again, he winced, noting the time. Bobby was going to have his head if he was much later. “Dammit!” He swore, hitting a fist against the steering wheel. As much as he hated to admit it, he didn’t have time for this! Whatever was up with Dean was just going to have to wait until he was done with work. Mind made up, he pushed the weird thoughts to the back of his mind and pulled out of the lot. Surely Dean could take care of himself for another day?
Dean frowned as he stared down at the phone vibrating in his lap. The lit up display read 'CASTIEL' but he made no move to answer the phone. Just thinking of talking to the alpha made Dean's stomach roil and he had to swallow hard against the rising bile in his throat. He couldn't believe this was happening. It'd taken the better part of an hour for him to escape Hannah's well-meaning questions as well as the club and now that he was blinking in sunlight and clear skies Dean had to wonder if it had all been a dream. 'More like a nightmare' he though, grimly recalling what had happened in the bathroom mere hours ago. Part of him still didn't want to accept that it happened--that he'd been /raped/ by Castiel--though the rest of him simply felt ashamed.
running. It’d been almost three months since Dean had went missing and neither Sam nor the local police had any leads in finding him. It was like his brother had up and disappeared without a trace! The sheer idea that Dean had done that, up and run like that, pissed Sam off to no end. It was entirely plausible that Dean had done so, but Sam didn’t want to believe it. Why now? Why up and disappear without saying anything? To Sam? Or Bobby? Or Benny? And what about Castiel?! Sam didn’t like prying into his brother’s relationships, but it was clear to everyone that there was a deep connection between the alpha and the omega despite their short engagement. Castiel had even confided in Sam that he was thinking of asking Dean to be his mate!
He was here to help...him? That brought Gabriel up short, and caused his brow to furrow as he frowned. “Help me with what?” He asked, obviously confused. Surely the angel had the wrong person--Gabriel didn’t need any divine intervention!
The majority of the day is spent asleep. Unfortunately Dean can’t even call it an escape for nightmares plague him at every turn. From dreams of Castiel to dreams of the supernatural horrors they faced when filming the show, it all ran the gamut in Dean’s mind. Being awake wasn’t much better--he felt weak and shaky and he was hungry enough that he very nearly considered digging through the dumpster for something to put in his stomach. If it wasn’t for his arm, which was nearly transcendent from the pain, he probably would have.
“Mmmhmmm!” Dean moans, louder this time, though considering the noise is barely above a grunt it’s hardly impressive. He does try to open his eyes, however. It’s slow-going; he’s sure each eyelid is weighted down with a ten-ton weight. In the end he only manages a slit, and only gets a brief, blurry flash of too bright before slamming his eyes shut once more.
Dean stared, shocked to see the three of them not only together but with grim looks painted on their faces as well. He could feel his wings twitch from where they were so tightly bound to his back, and had to wonder yet again what he could have possibly done. It was one thing to be summoned by your garrison commander, but it was a whole different thing to find yourself in the presence of so many older angels at once.
The low lights in the vanity have bathed the room in a dim golden glow, but it’s not the light that makes him pause even if it does make his eyes water. No, that honor goes to the sight of himself in the giant mirror set above the sink. He’s a two-legged
“Dammit!” Meg cursed softly, her hands balling into fists on her thighs. It was in her nature to want to yank Dean back around to face her like a man instead of the broken thing he was. It’d be so easy to do and easier still to force that soup straight down his throat yet Meg doesn’t do either one. The thing is, she doesn’t want to hurt Dean. She already has by going along with things so far, Meg knows, but somewhere along the way she came down with a case of the feelings. It was a new thing--she’d never once gotten attached to any of the omegas Castiel had drug home and honestly it terrified her. Getting attached was dangerous, especially since she knew what Castiel was going to do to Dean in the end. To say it isn’t going to be pretty is an understatement.
“Sir!” A stern voice sharply cuts through his little daydream, bringing Sam back down to reality. He startles, cutting off mid-growl to find the head nurse for the unit standing a few feet away. The woman was dark skinned and older than most of the other nurses Sam had seen thus far though the way she was eyeing him made it clear she wasn’t one to mess around with. “Boy, if you can’t control yourself I’ll toss you out of here!” She warned, her tone brooking no argument.
Meg walks over to the bed and leans down beside Dean’s head. She reaches down and carefully brushes the hair back from his face, smiling softly at the way Dean nuzzles into her hand. She opens her mouth to say something but stops before the words can get out. She’s already gotten attached enough, there’s no need to make it worse on herself. With one last pet she steps away, a frown taking place of the smile. “I’ll see you tomorrow.” She says as she heads out of the room.
“Well now, what do we have here?” Benny called as he parked and got out of the SUV. It was another thing that Dean had no hope of ever changing—no matter how many times he’d insisted otherwise Benny always made the effort to usher him into the car properly. It usually set Dean scowling in mock fierceness (something Benny completely ignored) yet today he didn’t even lift his head when he heard the backseat door open.
Warnings: There's several paragraphs towards the end that have graphic descriptions of injury and illness that may be upsetting.
“It’s Sam.” The younger alpha growls, his whole body tensing like he’s prepared to pounce Castiel. It’d be a foolish move but he was beyond caring. Now that he knew without a doubt that Castiel was the one who hurt Dean Sam was gonna deal with it. He didn’t give a fuck what happened to him as long as Castiel’s reign of terror against his brother ended right here, right now.
He frowns and comes to a stop right there in the middle of the street. At first glance nothing seems amiss—it’s still on the early side and the neighborhood seems peaceful. In the distance Sam spots a large lump of fur on someone’s porch, probably someone’s pet dog, but it doesn’t appear to be in distress.
Still murmuring soft nothings, Dean carefully lowered the soul until it was laid out overtop it’s mortal body. “Sorry man, this is going to hurt..” He warned before he gave the soul a little shove. The light grew brighter in alarm as the soul sunk down into the body but Dean only smiled. The body jerked once, as if having a convulsion, and then began to breathe. “You’ll be okay,” Dean told it before turning away from the now living body. There was just one thing left to do.
Gabriel came back to the waking world in fits and starts, not truly conscious of anything beyond the ringing in his ears and the pounding headache blooming from his left temple. For a long time he simply languished there, unable to muster up the energy to push past the pain to see the outside world. What had happened? His memory seemed as foggy as his head and the memories lingered just on the edge of his awareness.
Warnings: This chapter includes non con drugging, violence and physical, emotional, verbal, and sexual abuse.
, He thought when his brain was more or less coherent again. His guts were still churning heavily despite the fact there was nothing left in his system to come up. Dean didn’t think that’d matter much . . . he was fairly sure once he got a good look at his arm, something he was carefully avoiding, he’d puke again.
Across from him Dean is in roughly the same condition. The scratch running down his cheek is bleeding and smeared halfway across his face but aside from that and a bump on his forehead he’s relatively unscathed. He blinks slowly at his brother, “Sam?” He asks, breaking the odd moment of silence that’s fallen between the two of them.
Castiel jumped, forcefully brought out of his thoughts by the upbeat 90’s ear rock music that was suddenly blaring from the speakers.
Sam had the grace to look sheepish but he didn’t back down from his brother’s rising fury. “I do like him!” He retorted, “But you gotta admit there’s something weird going on here! I mean, when’s the last time you went out with anyone? Especially a coworker?” Sam had a point and he knew it--he couldn’t even remember the last time Dean had went on a date, let alone out for a drink with a coworker.
He mentally begs though the words don’t make it out of his mouth. He struggles to even out his breathing, hoping she would take the hint and go along with him pretending to be asleep. Surprisingly it doesn’t take very long until he actually is.
Dean doesn’t move closer. His feet have taken on a mind of their own and feel rooted to the spot as he stares down the alpha. Part of him wanted to turn and run and never look back. The other part...didn’t know what it wanted. There were so many things Dean wanted to say, to yell, to scream, yet now that he had Castiel right where he wanted Dean just couldn’t. He couldn’t do it; his tongue felt three sizes too big in his mouth, rendering him mute. Instead he settles for shaking his head and remaining out of reaching distance. It’s not much but it’s a compromise of sorts.
He cries and trembles, mind cast adrift and refusing to connect with the rest of his body. The air in the room is stifling, the heady combination of aroused alpha and frightened omega a bitter tang against Dean’s tongue. Castiel is everywhere; on him,
All signs pointed to yes if someone could be missing for a month and nobody would even notice. Dean didn’t know if he should be surprised or appalled.
Meg, for her part, doesn’t disappoint. She crouches down within easy reach and spreads her arms like Dean’s one of her pups. “C’mere,” she cooed, her light melon scent settling over Dean like a light airy blanket. Dean wastes no time. He leans forward, ignoring his injuries, and practically melts into her warm embrace.
“Vessel? Unsportsmanlike?” Gabriel echoed, thoroughly confused. “I thought demons only had vessels?” He wondered out loud, half wondering if he was still asleep in the motel and this whole thing was some kind of elaborate fever dream or something. Though who was he kidding? Gabriel wasn’t that creative!
Dean watched the show with a look that clearly read as ‘dude, chill the fuck out’ before he shrugged carelessly. “I brought us back here.” He said, the ‘duh’ part of the statement hanging in the air between them like a lead balloon. If Gabriel was getting all fussed up over that he was really going to freak out when he found out what else Dean could do! “That is your room, isn’t it?” He asked as he pointed to one of the closed motel room doors. “It seemed simpler than walking back.”
A loud ringing started in Castiel’s ears, drowning out the world around him. How? How had this happened? Balthazar’s mouth was moving, his cousin possibly explaining, but Castiel was beyond hearing him. His whole world had tunnel-visioned down to the dead man in front of him; everything else was irrelevant. No matter what had happened his brother was dead and Castiel’s life was crumbling right there before his eyes.
. . . And speaking of brothers. . . Against his will Gabriel found his eyes sliding back to the edge of the road, and sure enough, standing there where his parents had been stood Gabriel and Castiel’s two eldest brothers. Fraternal twins, Michael and Lucifer made up for their lack of sameness with matching disproving scowls that would have made their mother proud. Gabriel froze, feeling very much like a rat caught in a trap by two overly eager cats. Michael and Lucifer had been competitive bastards in life with everything from the football field to battling one another for their parents affections. Gabriel supposed the correct term nowadays would be ‘fighting like cats and dogs’ but with twin looks of revolusion heading his way all he felt was fear. It was ridiculous, especially considering Gabriel was now older than the twins had been when they were killed, but still, some memories never died. The twisted barbs, the beatings that their parents never seemed to notice… Gabriel shuddered under the weight of the recall, and turned his head away. Of all the horrors he’d witnessed, all the things he’d seen during his years of hunting, seeing his brothers again was a sight he didn’t need. The thought made his chest pulse, though with sympathy or something else, he didn’t know.
He wasn’t going to let it! Gabriel, the brother who’d been there since before Castiel could talk, who’d been there through thick & thin, couldn’t be dead. He simply
For better or worse, between one blink and the next Chuck was gone. In his place, however, was someone far worse in Gabe’s opinion: his mother Naomi. Despite the dark, the fog, and the fact that Gabriel was sure he’d lost his mind somehow, Naomi looked as fierce as ever. The scowl on her perfectly painted lips as she eyed her middle child was something Gabriel still dreamed about, and not in the good way. He swallowed hard, torn between too many emotions to even begin fitting names to them. Naomi opened her mouth, possibly to utter a scathing retort that Gabriel remembered so well but before she could utter a sound she was gone. Vanished like she hadn’t even been there.
He thought glumly, watching the way his reflection frowned at him. Today, or yesterday rather since it was past midnight, made their third week anniversary. Dean had thought it was an accomplishment worth celebrating and had gone all out in making dinner for the two of them. It’d been perfect; butternut squash ravioli in a buttery herb sauce made from scratch paired with a Viognier wine.  Dean had even gone all out in decorating the table with the fancy plates and silverware Ruby had gotten him for Christmas one year. It’d been the most effort Dean had ever put into a dinner that wasn’t holiday-related and he’d thought everything had turned out well.
From the outside looking in, Dean Winchester was a male omega who had it all: moderate fame and fortune-- thanks to the kickass television show he starred in alongside his brother Sam. All in all, it was the apple pie life and Dean appeared to be eating it up with both hands.
Gabriel felt his jaw drop; he couldn’t help it. “W-what? Are you serious?!” He sputtered, shocked to the core. He and Castiel had a long discussion on what had happened after he’d woken up in that field, including Castiel meeting Dean. He leaned back, appraising Dean in a new light now that he knew what he was looking at. Now that he knew what to look for he was disappointed in himself for not seeing it earlier. Despite the casual gray band t-shirt and jeans Dean was wearing alongside a black leather jacket there was something about him that screamed “other!”. Perhaps it was the way he was sitting ramrod straight or perhaps it was the way his eyes seemed to glow under the fluorescent lights of the diner. Either way, once known there was no mistaking the creature sitting across him was definitely not a human. “You’re an angel.” He breathed out, shock winning out over the plethora of emotions bubbling up inside him. “You’re really real!”
Dean wanders like that for a while, until exhaustion finally catches up with him. It hits him all at once with the fineness of being hit in the head with a hammer and sends him stumbling. He makes it all of two steps before he trips over his own feet and goes down. It hurts but unlike last time nothing appears to be broken. Still, he can’t get back up. Exhaustion sinks its teeth into him and doesn’t let go. Too tired to fight it, Dean does what anyone would in his position--he pulls the tarp over him and curls up. He’s tired and hurting and just wants to rest. Surely a few minutes can’t hurt, right?
Shaking his head, and still chuckling to himself under his breath, Benny walked down the walkway and got into the driver’s seat. In the back Dean had melted into the plush leather seat, his head tilted back, and eyes closed, though the scowl remained firmly in place. It’s adorable—though that’s not something Benny would ever admit out loud—and he can’t help grinning at the sight. “Let’s go get some grub!” He calls out cheerfully as he starts the vehicle back up.
Slowly Sam turns his head to appraise his brother. His lip is bleeding and his right eye is well on its way to swelling shut but he’s unharmed. He blinks, unable to find words for what just happened.
Is Castiel here? Dean honestly doesn’t know. If not for Hannah and their name tag he wouldn’t have even known he was in the club, let alone there with Cas. Everything is a blur, and when he tries to think back his head throbs with a deep warning pain. He winces, an involuntary whimper leaving his lips. Outside his control he tenses, coiled and ready for a fight though he doesn’t understand why.
Just as predicted he’s right where she left him. His eyes have slipped closed and to her relief, he doesn’t seem to be dry humping the floor anymore. In fact the omega is laying there completely lax like he’s completely given up. Despite knowing what Castiel ultimately has planned for him Meg can’t help the surge of compassion she feels towards Dean. He’s been so different from all the other omega’s they’ve taken over the years. It’s been, well, nice, if Meg says so. Not for the first time she wishes that she could keep him forever. She frowns briefly--it’s there and gone again in a second as she shoves the conflicting feelings down. Like it or not she can’t keep Dean so there’s little point in hoping...besides Dean needs her help now.
He thought, terrified. His eyes didn’t move from the doorway as he watched the sleeping alpha with trepidation. He didn’t know what to do. Should he leave the bathroom and try to go back to bed? Should he just stay where he was? Should he go get a start on cleaning up the mess from last night? His heart thundered painfully in his chest as he worried. Every possible scenario could end with Castiel’s rage and for the life of him Dean didn’t know what the best course of action was. For a time he didn’t do anything beyond stare. He was frozen; a naked trembling statue that literally wavered under the weight of his decision.
There wasn’t much to see: two beds, one occupied by a deeply sleeping Castiel, the table and chair, two partially open duffel bags, and the general furnishings found in motel rooms everywhere. Dean took it all in as he headed to the chair as indicated and stiffly sat down. Now that he was here he didn’t know what to do with himself, Bobby had never covered what he was supposed to do if he found himself in the hunters motel room! From the adjoining room came the sound of running water before the door opened to reveal Gabriel. He’d taken off his jacket and changed into a simple t-shirt and plaid pajama pants. He looked tired and suddenly Dean knew what to do without being told.
For his part Dean just watched him placidly, letting Gabriel draw his only conclusions before he finally tossed the guy a bone and nodded his head. “Angels take vessels just like demons do.” He said, sounding just as matter of fact as if he was talking about the weather and not the fact he was possessing a living person. “The difference is angels require consent to take someone as a vessel; demons don’t.” He paused, obviously listening to something he alone could hear before he suddenly smiled. “My vessel--Matt--says to tell you he became a vessel willingly if that helps.”
Dean laughed, shaking his head as the rest of his mirth fades slowly away. “Are you sure man? We’re already pushing it…” They were, though it’s not like Dean overly cares. He just spent eight days miserable as fuck; he deserved a few minutes (or an hour, who’s he kidding?) of entertainment before dragging back into the grind once again.
Warning: Panic attack and brief mention of suicide. Please note it's a mention only and does not happen in the story itself.
“Okay.” The first voice said, sounding just as resigned as Meg did. “I’ll do it but only if you promise you’ll leave next. We get him safe and you’ll be gone. I want to hear you say it.”
Castiel tilted his head to the side before pretending to brush some lint off his shirt. “Believe whatever you want.” He told Dean, “But the proof is in the pudding, is it not? Why has no one come looking for you yet? Why does no one know you’re even missing in the first place? Hmm?” He paused, posing dramatically in a thinking position. “Let me think…” He snapped his fingers and pointed at Dean. “Oh wait! That’s right, the great Dean Winchester decided to take time off without mentioning how long he would be gone or when he’d return.”
Gabriel didn’t realize he was shaking when a warm hand came to rest upon his arm. The touch was fleeting but he was grateful for it as he followed the arm back up to find Castiel looking at him with a knowing look. It made his brother seem older than he was and for the first time Gabriel was grateful for it. “Thanks Cassie.” He whispered through a clogged voice before turning back to the window again.
Wait. What? Was he hearing that right? Dean simply blinked, dumbfounded and at a complete loss of words because, seriously? He was the right angel for some job? He found his head lifting on its own, his disbelieving stare swinging from one face to the other because surely this was a joke. Nobody, and he meant
Chuck had perished alongside most of his family nearly twenty years ago--something Gabriel still had nightmares about--so this was impossible! For his part Gabriel simply started, mouth agape and speechless. He'd dreamed of seeing his father again but this exact scenario had never even crossed his mind. How was this even happening?!
“Damn it!” Sam shouted, relishing the way his voice echoed in the empty stairway. It felt like being heard despite there being no one there to hear it. He sighed and shifted and scrubbed a hand harshly down his face. He was being childish—off crying alone because he was putting his needs before his brig brother’s…just like he always had. Ugh. Sam huffed, disgusted with himself. As appealing as it currently was, he couldn’t hide away in the stairs forever and Sam knew it.
Licking his lips, Castiel leaned over and repeated the bite on Dean’s right side, riding out his bucking this time. Oh yes, the alpha groaned. Obedience was excellent to have, but this? This little act of uncontrollable defiance? This was what Castiel wanted the most. When he finally pulled back he grinned down at his handiwork. The bite marks were nearly identical and were deep, even bleeding a lot. Dean would be feeling them for days, if not longer afterwards. “So perfect!” He cooed again, unable to resist as he stroked the small of Dean’s back, electing a shiver to follow in his wake.
It was like he’d asked the magic question--immediately the woman straightened up and fixed him with a gaze that would have made anyone’s flesh start to crawl. The shark-like smirk on her face grew larger, and was it just Castiel’s imagination or did she really look like she was ready to eat him alive?
Coming home again felt weird. Dean stood out in his driveway long after Garth’s taillights had disappeared around the corner yet makes no move to go inside.
“You’ve got to be kidding me.” Dean said when they pulled up outside of the club. From the outside the place wasn’t much to look at: the building was a wooden two storied place with faded, peeling blue paint with equally peeling white trim. Combined with the large unpainted privacy fence that surrounded the place and was tall enough it’d even surpass Dean’s moose of a brother’s 6’4” frame, and the whole place looked more like a rundown B&B than a popular hangout. “You’ve gotta be kidding me.” He repeated, eyes glued to the window, because, seriously? The fact that there was a clear line snaking out from behind the fence didn’t make him feel any better about it either.
He thought wearily as he carefully hunched down in the dumpster’s shadow. It was uncomfortable as hell--the cold rough ground soaked through the thin pajama pants sending shivers up and down Dean’s spine. Pulling his knees in towards his chest he curled up in as small a ball as possible. It wasn’t the Ritz (not by a long shot) but hopefully it would do to make it through the night. Dean squeezed his eyes shut and hoped for sleep to take him.
If nothing else being held captive had given Dean a lot of time to think about his life. He had spent a great deal of time contemplating all the time Sam had given him grief over not seriously looking for a mate. Dean had paid him no mind--plenty of folks didn’t have mates and went about their lives just fine, Dean included. He regretted not listening now, and not just for the obvious reasons. Dean missed his brother, worry about his dating life notwithstanding.
Dean closed his eyes and didn’t bother with a reply. There was probably a whole host of things he could say but he just didn’t feel like it. Whatever small ray of defiance that had flared up in him was gone as quick as it’d come.
The demon grinned like it’d been reading his damned mind, and who knew, it probably had been. Case in point: it pouted those dark painted lips at him before saying sadly “Unfortunately for you we need to get down to business. The clock’s ticking down on your dear brother the longer you stall here.”
The brothers blinked, both startled out of their own private thoughts. A quick glance revealed Balthazar was right; there were at least half a dozen eyes peering at them from behind the curtains of the surrounding rooms and Castiel couldn’t help let out a sigh. This certainly wasn’t what he had expected to come back to but he couldn’t complain. Gabriel was alive, and while he wasn’t alright now, he would be eventually. It was enough; it had to be. Squirming free of his brother’s hold, Castiel finally shoved his way out of the car. He stalked to the hotel door without looking back; he didn’t need to, he knew Gabriel would follow.
Before Dean’s eyes Castiel stood up from where he’d been crouched alongside the far wall. How Dean had missed noticing him he didn’t know but as the alpha rose to his full height he thought he would puke. “C-cas.” He choked out, terrified. How had he gotten into the house? How long had he been there watching Dean break down? What was he going to do to Dean now?
Welcome to the end! If you've read this far I'd just like to say thank you for reading! Please heed the tags!
Now that the excitement was over, or so it seemed to Dean, he tuned out the actual words and just let their tones wash over him. They were quieter now and Dean didn’t resist as they pulled him back under into the welcome arms of sleep.
Us? There was more than one of them? Dean blinks hard, thankful when the light finally moves out of his field of vision and is surprised to find a young woman with dark hair and wide eyes staring at him like they’ve seen a ghost. “Blahg?” Dean garbles unintelligibly, closer but not quite there yet to forcing actual words out.
“Ow! Son of a bitch!” Dean groaned as he was kicked in the ribs by one of Castiel’s feet. Certainly struggling on the ground wasn’t all that Hollywood made it out to be considering the way he was getting battered. He grunted and cursed and proceeded to bite and scratch back any part he could reach. “I’m trying!” He cried out as Castiel got in a particularly hard scratch down the side of his face. He could see it but reaching it wasn’t going to be easy.
Eventually the absolute need for a drink compels him to move. His throat and tongue feel thick and swollen, by-products of all the screaming he’d done. Would the misery ever end? He wondered as he slowly blinked up at the ceiling. Ever since Cas had taken him it’d been one torture after another and Dean truly didn’t know how much more he could take. It seemed an eternity passed before he finally found the will to  kick his body into gear, but once he does Dean keeps going.
Dean scoffed; he couldn’t help it; it was such a ridiculous question! “Course I’m up for it,” he drawled in his best imitation of a thick southern accent. “I’m Jensen Ackles; I’m ready for anything!” It was a convincing performance…or would have been if he hadn’t looked like day-old roadkill.
One year? Only one? Castiel felt the anger drain out of him along with most of the blood in his face, leaving him dizzy. Ten years had been doable but to only have one more before an eternity in the Pit? Fear thrummed in his bones and all he could think about in the moment was Gabriel. His older brother wouldn’t have wanted this for him, Castiel knew. He would give him such an ass reaming for even considering such a thing but...that was the point, right? One year wasn’t what he had planned but it’d be worth it, wouldn’t it? Gabriel would be alive and that was all that truly mattered to Castiel. “Fine.” He finally growled out, putting all his determination behind the one word.
Eventually he found the will to move once more. No matter the state of his brother, either alive or dead, Castiel couldn’t feasibly stand in the middle of a field all night long. So he continued on, his head feeling like it was stuffed full of cotton thanks to all the thoughts racing circles through it. As the sunlight gradually slipped away to night he thought he saw lights in the distance to which he breathed a sigh of relief. With any luck he wouldn’t have to spend the night in the field after all.
but the stabbing pain rose up before he could begin to figure it out. A moan slipped out of him as the throbbing started up again, moving upwards towards his eye.
Needless to say by the time Bobby called cut for the day Sam was more than ready to hit the road. He wasted no time in going back to his trailer to get out of his costume and back into his street clothes. From the time he got dressed to the time he reached his car he’d left two new messages on his brother’s phone and was very nearly ready to scream from sheer frustration. Channeling it into usefulness he put his foot down on the gas and sped off. It was nothing short of a miracle that Sam didn’t get stopped for a speeding ticket on his way to Dean’s for as fast as he drove. The house, when he arrived, was dark. There wasn’t a light to be seen anywhere and more than anything else that set the alarm bells ringing in Sam’s head as he parked and got out of the car.
He turned back to the bedroom, contemplating his options. There was no place to sit aside from the floor or the bed. The former was too cold against his naked skin for his preferences but he was getting tired of the bed. What I wouldn't give for a couch! He thought somewhat hysterically, shaking his head at himself. He was hilarious...in his own mind at any rate. He stopped just inside the doorway separating the two rooms when a strange hissing noise caught his attention. "What the?" He croaked, looking around with some alarm. Had a snake somehow gotten into the room? He didn't want to be anaconda bait!!
Sam frowned. He didn’t buy what Dean was selling but if past experience had taught him anything, it was that he wasn’t going to win against his brother. Dean could out-stubborn Sam, which was quite the feat, and so he had learned when to just drop things. “Fine.” He sighed grudgingly. “Do you need help getting back inside?”
What in the name of their Father had gone on here while Dean had been gone? Had everyone lost their minds? Dean floundered, feeling distinctly like a fish out of water as he squinted between Garth and Sam, trying to figure out what their game was here. “A hero.” He echoed flatly, eyes still flickering between the other two, “Why? I didn’t do anything!” Dean hadn’t realized his voice was growing louder by the end there but he certainly realized it when all the excited chatter from his garrison abruptly dropped off. It didn’t take a genius to feel all the eyes upon him and Dean found himself swallowing hard in response. Still he limited himself to focusing on Garth and Sam because out of everyone they were the two he trusted the most to have his back with whatever this was.
To say that Dean is scared is an understatement. He’s fucking terrified of Castiel and what he’s going to do. The shift in his personality is a complete 360 from the last time he was in to see Dean and the omega doesn’t know what to do with the information. He knows Castiel’s like this, how his mood swings from one direction to the other in a blink of an eye, and it terrifies him. Castiel’s capable of doing anything and Dean is helpless to defend himself from it. The sheer horror of the realization makes his heart squeezed painfully in his chest and another whimper slips free from him, completely against his will. He should say something, should resist in the small way that he can but . . . he can’t. The pleas are there on the tip of Dean’s tongue yet he can’t utter them. The memory of Dean screaming while Castiel manhandled his now black and blue cock is still standing out starkly in Dean’s mind, weighing his tongue down.
Feeling Dean’s eyes on him, Benny tilted his head down to find that he was right and met Dean’s inquiry with the patented smirk that he knew drove the omega crazy. “Impatient now, are we?” He chuckled as he rose to his feet. “You must be starving then!”
With the show shut down everyone had gone their separate ways for the time being. Even Castiel, who had another house somewhere out of state, had decided to go back home for now. While Sam couldn’t blame him, especially after the man went on about how his housekeeper had been having trouble with a new puppy, he had foolishly hoped the other alpha would stay. It was childish, but Sam didn’t like being alone. He never had—even as a pup Dean had always been there even when their father hadn’t been. It wasn’t like Sam had been completely abandoned, either. He still had his beautiful mate Ruby, and both Bobby and Benny lived close enough they were a short drive away, but it wasn’t the same. Dean was the glue that held everyone together, Sam included.
“Dean?” Sam called as he pushed his way inside. It was just as dark as the outside had appeared and Sam reached for the light switch near the door. Flipping it on, he blinked out at Dean’s living room. The place was as messy as ever but it looked exactly the same as the last time Sam had been over. “Dean?” He called again, not really expecting an answer. Already Sam was moving on, heading deeper into the house.
He thought, giving a shake of his head as he turned the gnome upside down, and just as he suspected there was a key carefully wedged into its hollow base. If you asked Sam it was the most obvious place in the world to stash a key, but who was he to argue his brother’s ideas? Besides, at the moment he was grateful considering it took two long strides to get back to the door with the key in hand.
He could feel the tell-tale burn of tears building behind his eyes and he blinked furiously, not wanting them to fall.
Everything had gone to hell in a hand basket and the worst thing of it all was Gabriel didn’t have anyone except himself to blame for it. If he hadn’t gone to that club with Balthazar in the first place none of this would have even happened!
Hannah nodded, matching Meg’s frown with one of their own. The whole situation sucked but Meg was right; it was all they had. “He’s been searching everywhere nearly every day. He showed up at the club a couple of weeks ago and was asking all kinds of questions. Poor guy, he seems like he’s at the end of his rope.” They moved their hand down, stroking carefully over Dean’s bruised face. “I’ll take him as far as I can, just like we discussed.”
Her words were weighted and ominous; Sam felt a shiver run up his spine as he listened. “I don’t plan on going anywhere.” And that was the truth—Sam was determined to be so far up his brother’s butt he’d be calling him a suppository. Whether it was the look in his eyes or the ringing truth in his words, the nurse seemed to be appeased. While she didn’t come out and smile there was a twinkling look in her eyes as she regarded him. Whatever else she was going to say, however, was lost as the door to Dean’s room opened behind Sam.
He knelt at the edge of the open grave that he had pulled the soul’s body from and examined it for a long moment. He didn’t like this part but it had to be done according to the plan he’d been told before they had set off for Hell. With a snap of his fingers the dismantled wooden coffin snapped back together, perfectly whole at the bottom of the grave. Dean frowned at it, not liking one bit of what he had to do. Wouldn’t it be simpler for the human to wake with the open sky above him? The field they were in was beautiful by any of his father’s standards; a bright blue sky, a shining sky, barely a cloud in the sky. There were the sounds of birdsong and insects in the air; all in all it was perfectly peaceful.
“Oh gross!” Sam recoiled, horror wrote into every line of his face. “I do not need to hear about your sex life dude!” In true little brother fashion he began making gagging noises. There were just some things that weren’t meant to be shared between brothers! “You’re such a jerk Dean!”
Just as predicted, Dean scowled in the face of Benny’s smirk, and instead of answering he got into the vehicle instead. It’s as good of a declaration without him coming out and saying anything, and Benny can’t help but chuckle at the display. Dean was many things, but subtle he was not.
Tightening his grip on the knife Gabriel reached out and slowly pulled the door open with the other hand.
Stuck behind the wheel and unable to reach over and punch his brother like he wanted to, Castiel simply glowered--and probably proving Gabe’s point--while he waited to see Dean’s reaction. If the angel started laughing at him Castiel didn’t know what he was going to do but it was going to be something!
Unfortunately for Dean there was no answer. There wasn’t even the barest hint of a sound coming from behind the door. He kicked it again only to crumple under the weight of the pain in his leg and in his soul. Pulling his injured leg in close, Dean curled up into a ball and wept bitter tears.
“Shit! Gabriel? Are you with us?” A panicked, but welcomingly familiar voice--Castiel--hovered close by and Gabriel felt something in his chest ease at the sound. He moaned again in response, the only one he seemed capable of doing and tried again to open his eyes. He was a little more successful this time, having managed a little slit that was instantly overtaken by worried blue eyes and a familiar head of dark tousled hair. “C-Cas.” Gabriel rasped out, glad to see his brother there. He still didn’t have the foggiest idea what the hell had happened but as long as his little brother was okay then everything else could wait.
! He thought as he stared stupidly at the dark wallpaper splashed across the wall a few short feet in front of him. Delicate white vines and gold leaves spread across the dark background in a calming pattern but it was lost on Dean as he continued to stare. That wasn’t his wallpaper. Dread curling in the pit of his stomach, he squirmed his way carefully onto his side only to find his panic ratchet up another notch as he stared at the rest of the room.
hurts so much it’s overwhelming. His legs, thighs, and ass are a deep throb amongst the other pain, and even without seeing it Dean’s sure he’s probably bruised down to the bone in places. Castiel hadn’t held back, that much was for damn sure. Next in line are his sides, ribs, and face which feels pretty much like he’s went several rounds at the wrong end of a pair of fists, and oh. Wait. He did, didn’t he? Remembrance hits him dead in the chest with all the weight of a freight train leaving Dean floundering and breathless.
from the Pit. Not human, at least… Castiel shook his head, stalling that line of thought right there.
Somehow, he manages to doze off. It’s a dangerous thing because Castiel could come back at any time but there’s no fighting biology no matter how uncomfortable he currently is. He’s exhausted and injured and so, so heartsick. It’s comparable to someone sticking a serrated knife in his heart and twisting round and ‘round. It hurts and is sickening, and Dean’s inner omega wails its eternal displeasure of it all.
the one who went off with Balthazar and didn’t even bother letting me know where you were or anything! I thought you’d found yourselves another hunt and then Balth came crashing in and led me to your corpse! How do you think that went!?” Castiel’s voice was rising in volume and he was fairly sure it was starting to echo since the car door was still wide open but he didn’t care. He was so furious he didn’t give a damn if the whole world heard him chew Gabriel out; his brother deserved it!
For just shy of eternity, Gabriel stared. What else was there to do? His heart beat a hard rhythm in his chest as he stared down the one person he didn't think he'd ever see again. Asmodeus, and make no mistake it was clearly him, stared back with hooded, dark eyes that made Gabriel shudder for a whole different reason. Just the weight of his gaze upon Gabe made him feel vulnerable, like the man was staring through him to his soul. The flush spreading up from his chest was humiliating along with the barely kept in check urge to look down to confirm he was still fully clothed.
Castiel shrugged again, seemingly unbothered by Dean’s mounting anger. “Aren’t you a joke?” He inquired, “That’s what I was led to believe at any rate by, well, everyone. Your co-workers, the crew members. Even that boy at the gas station that has an unhealthy obsession with you described as much! Tell me, Dean, what are you?” The alpha leaned forward, his eyes still locked to Dean’s. “You pretend you’re so high and mighty and act like everyone else is beneath you. Even your own kin agrees--Sam practically admitted as much the first day I met him!”
The alpha took several deep breaths, each one deeper than the last as he inhaled the amazing scent of scared omega. It was like liquid fire in his veins and he soaked it up for all that it was worth.
Sam was still shaking his head, partially amused at himself, when he turned on yet another back street. This wasn’t a direction he normally took, and for a moment he was caught off guard by the foreign landscape.
Sam explains it all in a rush: Dean’s disappearance, Sam finding him here in the street, the way he’s so still and thin and dirty…. By the time the operator says there’s help on the way Sam feels like he’s just barely hanging on to his sanity. He crosses the few steps back towards his brother and sinks down right there uncaring of the ugly blend of smells or the cold. The voice on the phone cautioned him against touching his brother so Sam won’t but he needs to be near him.
From his spot leaning up against the brick wall of the alleyway Gabriel shrugged. The rough brick scratched at his leather jacket, something that normally he’d get pissed over but tonight he didn’t care. “I did.” He said, looking away. “I do.” Why was it so difficult to put what he was feeling into words? He huffed out a laugh and shifted again, this time bringing his arms up to cross over his chest. It was a cool night, unseasonably so for it not being early summer, and Gabriel felt himself shudder a little. It was just the cold, he told himself, and not the brightly lit red neon sign two doors down that read ‘THE INFERNO’ that was tossing him off his game. No, it was definitely the cold. “Are you sure about this?” He’d already asked Balthazar the same question twice now but he couldn’t help it.
Was this really happening? Dean blinked slowly, still caught in the heavy fog of his tired brain as he stared at her. He was fairly sure he wasn’t imagining her--the bright red lounge pants and equally vibrant green tank top with the words ‘Better days are ahead’ was stand out even for a hallucination. Her hair was pulled up in a messy bun that left wisps of hair hanging down but it was the look on her face that truly caught his attention. Instead of the quiet scorn Dean had come to associate with her she was looking at him so hopeful and earnest that he felt something inside him clench. “S-soup?” He asked shakily, still half-wondering if she would disappear in the blink of an eye.
Somewhere during his sneaking around Cas had shifted, his face now facing towards the door. He looked tired, Gabriel noted with a frown. It was just like his little brother to take the weight of the world on his shoulders but it was disheartening to see the way he didn’t even seem to relax in sleep. “It’ll work out.” Gabriel whispered, though he wasn’t sure if the words were meant for himself or for Castiel. Either way he was sure they could work things out in the end, somehow. They didn’t really have a choice otherwise.
He supposed as he shrugged off his coat on autopilot. He moved towards the kitchen automatically, wishing he had thought about keeping the cup of ice Garth had gotten him, or at the very least the drink. He hadn’t managed more than a few sips of it but the icy coldness had felt wonderful against his raw throat.
“Oh you’re a feisty one, aren’t you?” The demon teased, clearly delighted at winding him up. “But that’s not the way this is going to work.” It declared, some of the amusement bleeding out of its voice. “You aren’t stupid, and neither am I Castiel Novak.” The demon paused there and hummed like it was considering something before all at once lighting up. “How about...One year. Take it or leave it.”
A good fifty minutes later Dean has been scrubbed, dried, and put back into bed amidst fresh sheets and a clean blanket. His temperature had come down some but he’d remained docile throughout everything. He whimpered and groaned throughout the scrubbing though he hadn’t truly woken from whatever state he’s trapped in. Now that he’s bad in bed Meg leans up against the doorway between the bathroom and bedroom and scrubs at her eyes tiredly. She’s wiped not only from the labor of cleaning, drying, and manhandling Dean but from scrubbing the bathroom down afterwards.
Sam collapsed against the thick metal rail and clung on for dear life, wishing the world would stop turning. He felt like the rug had been ripped out from under his feet, which in a way, had been. For a good deal of his life Sam had been dependent on Dean and never once had Sam considered the reverse happening. Now that it had, he was, at the lack of a better word at a loss. He wasn’t a caregiver—how was he supposed to make sure Dean received the care he’d undoubtedly need?
The words are like a blow to Dean’s already bruised and battered body. He whimpers in response, far past being able to communicate with actual words. He hasn’t stopped humping the floor, can’t stop. All he wants, one way or the other, is relief. Given the circumstances he wouldn’t care if Meg had decided to take a page from Castiel’s book and beat him unconscious. It wouldn’t have helped with the heat any but at least Dean wouldn’t have been awake and continuously stuck in this hell like he is now.
“Oooh so strong and determined!” The demon all but cooed, even going so far to bring a hand up to its borrowed chest. “I like that in a man!” Before Castiel could even begin thinking of a reply for that one he found himself hauled in impossibly closer to the demon by an invisible hand. He stiffened, only to be met with its face mere inches away from his own. “As fun as this is let’s talk turkey, shall we?”
Castiel hadn’t been able to contain his excitement long enough to get properly dressed to go in to see Dean. He had planned it already, what he would wear, but in the end the plan went right out the window. Boxers, socks, shoes, shirt, all of it had been left on a heap on his bedroom floor as he barely managed to shimmy his way into a pair of jeans. Castiel had zipped but forwent buttoning; Dean was too enticing to wait for.
Dean groaned again, louder. Leave it to Sam to keep hounding when all Dean wanted him to do was drop it. He fixed his brother with the best glare he could considering he was only working with one usable eye and growled: “Leave it Sam!” He loved his brother, he truly did, but damn if he couldn’t be annoying as hell sometimes! “I’m fine.” Or, well he would be once the painkillers he took a while back kicked in. Dean had been trying to get as comfortable as possible while he waited, or he had been until Sam had come knocking down his door. Now here he was at ass 'o'clock in the morning trying to calm down a raging giant! “I’m fine!” He repeated, louder, just in case Sam didn’t get it the first time around.
Dean’s eyes glaze over as he remembers Castiel cornering him at the urinal. It’s like he’s reliving the moment—he can feel Castiel’s hands on him, touching him without Dean’s consent and he’s powerless to make it stop. The alpha’s hot breath washes across his neck and face teasing in the face of Dean’s continued suffocation. He’s dying, he’s gotta be. Black spots dance in front of his eyes and distantly Dean thinks he hears someone yell but why would anyone be yelling? It ain’t nothing new for an alpha to use an omega in a restroom, public or not. Dean doesn’t want this. Not again. He just wants to breathe, dammit!
“Spitfire eh? Sounds like my kinda gal!” Dean chuckled as he followed along behind Castiel. He didn’t miss the fondness of Castiel’s tone and it made him curious about what this friend of his was like, aside from being obviously feisty. He wouldn’t classify himself as jealous but there was a twinge of something there. ”Where are we going?”
That was the whole thing right there, wasn’t it? The angel talked a good game, or well, he sounded good at the least, but how would he do when faced with Asmodeus himself? The better question was how would
There was a beat of silence. When no answer was forthcoming Dean listened to the crunch of gravel under the other man’s boots as he turned to look at him. “You okay there, brother?” Benny asked, worry edging into his normally calm scent. “You need me to call someone?”
? She wonders, not for the first time, as she gets him settled. It’s awkward; Dean’s curled up on his side with his upper half leaning heavily against the fogged glass of the shower partition part of the tub. His eyes are still closed and he looks even more washed out than he did when he was splayed out on the floor. Meg sighs as she surveys him, hands on her hips. “Castiel so owes me for this!” She declares to no one as she reaches for the hand sprayer.
“Castiel...wants to keep me?” Dean parroted back uncertainly. Surely he had heard her wrong, right? “Why? Why me? I didn’t do anything to him!” At least nothing the alpha hadn’t wanted done to him, right? The knowledge that Castiel wanted to keep him buzzed around unpleasantly in Dean’s head, making him review their interactions in a whole new light. “Can you get me out of here?” He wasn’t one to beg, but if it worked he was all for it. Summoning up the best version of puppy eyes he could muster, Dean aimed them at Meg.
He hadn’t realized he had drifted off to sleep again until Gabriel found himself rousing at sounds of quiet talking going on around him. “How is he doing?” He heard Dean ask, listening as the sounds of footsteps the angel came closer to the bed. He stopped beside what Gabriel assumed to be Castiel’s side. “He woke up for a few minutes.” Castiel replied, his voice tired. “I don’t think he’s aware of much, they have him pretty sedated.”
He wanted to groan or whine or even possibly yell but Dean didn’t dare. Cautiously he turned enough to see around the semi-open door that led into the bathroom and let out a nearly inaudible sigh of relief. Castiel was still sound asleep in his bed, right where Dean had left him a few moments prior. He was stupidly grateful he hadn’t woken the alpha. Considering he had him to thank for the way his face now looked Dean didn’t want to see what Castiel would do when angered.
Everything comes flooding back all at once: Castiel’s instance on ‘starting the weekend off right’ despite it only being Wednesday; coming here to the club; drinks, far too many drinks; his desperate trip to the restroom and then…
His lungs burned as he took in the cold air, each exhale coming out in a visible puff of white smoke. He’d been at it for a while now—the heaviness (and smell) of his sweat dampened clothes could attest—but he had no intention of stopping any time soon. Why would he? Right now all Sam had
enough he won’t be as appealing? It's a ridiculous notion, especially considering last time but Dean’s terrified into parallelization; all he’s got is ridiculous. What else can he do? There’s nothing and the lack of hope weighs heavily on his chest. The bed dips behind him and all at once Dean stiffens.
It's not an animal. That's the first thing that flashes through Sam’s mind as he stands there, paralyzed in shock at what he's seeing. He doesn't know what he's seeing. Hell, he can't
If anyone had asked Gabriel Novak where he planned to settle down one day he would have laughed that person in the face and declared he was never going to settle down. Boy, look at him now: it’d only been four months since Castiel had been killed to save his hide and yet Gabriel hadn’t moved on. Though truly, couldn’t move on was probably a better description. He’d never fancied himself a country man but four months of fresh air and sunlight and no hunting had done some wonders for him. Oh, Gabriel didn’t think it was going to last forever. He’d been in the hunting life for too long to know forever was a concept made up by people who didn’t live hand to mouth running credit card schemes just to keep themselves clothed and fed. It was also for those who weren’t currently living out of a Jubilee Gold 1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V.
That unusual spike of wrongness flooded through his being as he considered the long hallway before him. It was like any other hall in heaven: full of white light and multiple doors containing souls of the deceased except for the very end. There stood a massive white door that curved into a peak at the top and somehow managed to look imposing despite the fact it was simply a door. Had Dean been a lesser angel he would have turned and flown for it, risking whatever punishment would await him afterwards. Unfortunately Dean wasn’t the type to back down just because something seemed off to him. No, he was more of a keep going and punch his way through. Which is why, despite his reservations, he found himself heading towards that white door.
“You look like hammered crap, chief.” Benny rumbled, his naturally calming scent overshot with concern as he continued to watch Dean. “Hard to believe a night with an alpha caused all this.” He wasn’t judging but he was concerned. He had seen enough abusive alphas in his time to recognize the early warning signs.
hadn’t been the one who was stalling, but he closed it at the last second. Semantics hardly mattered when in the end it boiled down to the demon was correct: they needed to get a move on here. “What do I have to do?” He growled, straightening his back and looking every inch the deadly hunter that he was.
Please scroll to the end notes for a brief description of what happens in the chapter if you'd rather skip over it.
The next few minutes are lost to the scuffle as they struggle for the gun. Dean thinks he has it but he doesn’t; Sam does, and to his horror, so does Castiel. Both of them grab and pull on it at the same time. . . There’s a deafening bang as the gun goes off.
Dean bristled in response to Sam’s growing anger. The jab about not being able to stand up stung and what was worse, Sam was right. It’d been hell to get from his couch to here and now the only thing that was holding him up was the door frame. It was humiliating but Dean didn’t have a leg to stand on to counter the accusation with. “It looks worse than it is.” He placated, switching tracks. “It’s just some bruising…” And quite possibly a broken rib or two but Sam didn't really need to know that.
Dean winced, cowed. With everything that had happened afterwards Dean had completely forgotten about his call to Bobby. He’d only intended to take a day or so off not...however long it’d been now. Bobby had to be beyond pissed; Dean frowned as he pictured it. If he were anyone else, in any other kind of job his ass would have been fired for sure. “They don’t even miss me, do they.” It wasn’t a question--Dean already had a good idea of the answer.
Dean wished he had the answers, but he didn’t. He didn’t even have the time to ponder the questions; somehow when he wasn’t paying attention it was like a switch had been flicked to life around them. Demons were scaling the rocky terrain and Dean had little doubt that it was time to get out of here. Shoving his reservations aside, he didn’t even think: he grabbed the soul around what would have been the human’s waist, and hauled ass out of there.
Unfortunately, he wasn’t about to find out either. Two burning hot hands were on his hips, angling his ass upwards, and Dean only had time to think ‘holy shit’ before he felt it: the tip of Castiel’s dick pushing into his ass.
He thought, a smile involuntarily stretching across his face. It just seemed his luck; he’d come to check on the human but the human was clearly already gone. Shrugging his wings out behind him, Dean observed the field around him for a long moment. It didn’t take long to find what he’d been looking for; there, at the very edge of the field near a human settlement shone the bright blue soul Dean had raised from Hell. Pleased to find the human still so close the angel spread his wings and flew after him. Maybe spending some more time with the human would help things make sense; if nothing else it certainly couldn’t hurt, could it?
“I don’t like it.” Sam declared the next day before Dean even managed to get all the way out of the car. “I can’t believe you actually went out with him!” For someone who was so tall it was impressive how much he could act like a young pup but Sam was managing to pull it off nicely. He pouted, fixing Dean with his best puppy dog look. “Well? How’d it go?”
He wondered as he slashed and stabbed and clawed his way through demon after demon. There was no time to dwell on his brethren; as many demons Dean cut down that much more seemed to multiply before his eyes. All he could do was hope his garrison and the others were holding their own. As it was Dean was in danger of getting swarmed and he knew he couldn’t let that happen. Once it did he’d be as good as dead, and with nobody from his side anywhere in sight he knew he’d be truly on his own. The worst part of it was the demons wouldn’t kill him outright; oh no, Dean was certain there would be a considerable amount of torture done before they finally granted him the mercy of death. While the thought of being tortured made his very being quake, the upside was it kept Dean moving.
He tried a third time, jerking harder than before only to freeze when the sound of clinking metal reached his ears. What.in.the.fuck?
Dean snorted, the sound covered up by the swell of noise around them. "I'm good Cas. Just give me a minute to adjust, alright?" He hopes he doesn't come off as whiney, he really will be fine in a minute or two.
The burning is growing more and more and more. It radiates outwards like a burning forest fire out of control, unstoppable. He finally rips the last of the bandages off with a strangled cry, horrified to see the blood soaking into the white cloth. Dean clutches his neck, a howl building in his throat as the pain threatens to overwhelm him. The last thought he has before his eyes roll up in his head is the nurses at the hospital were right. The old wives tales really are true--Castiel’s dead and Dean will suffer despite not being the one who pulled the trigger.
Gabe tried to match her smile though it was wane at best. He briefly glanced at the menu before looking back to the girl again. “I’ll take the biggest cup of coffee you’ve got, black, and the fried egg platter with a side of toast.” It was a far cry from what Gabriel would normally order but he found he wasn’t all that hungry. Still, he managed to muster up a genuine smile as he looked up at the waitress, “Thank you.” He said as he handed back the menu.
Dean froze, his need for a drink suddenly forgotten. That had hurt, a lot. A whimper slipped past his lips and before he knew what was happening he found himself on the kitchen floor, his arms wrapped around his legs. He whimpered again, louder this time, and the echo of the sound in the empty kitchen just made him feel worse. Giant fat tears rolled down his face leaving burning trails as they collected in his shirt collar.
Dean stiffened at the thought, his heart suddenly leaping up into his throat. Suddenly terrified that he had done something wrong he turned to look back through the crack into the bedroom. Castiel was still in bed, thankfully, but Dean’s hackles were still raised. It hadn’t taken long for the alpha to go off last night and the last thing he needed was a repeat of that. Sam was already going to have his head as it was once he caught sight of Dean’s face, and so would his care team. The makeup artists were more used to putting fake bruises on him rather than trying to cover one's up. God, he hoped they had good concealer or whatever the hell it was called.
Decided, Gabe moved further into the place and considered his options. There was a long bar directly across from the door with high metal stools spanning the length. Two men in trucker caps and flannel shirts sat at opposite ends of it, both more focused on their food than Gabriel. Beyond the two people Gabriel could see moving about in the kitchen part of the place, the guys were the only people in the place aside from him. Something in him un-clenched even further at the realization he wouldn’t be dealing with a lot of people, and that more than anything, had Gabe slumping into the nearest seat at one of the tables.
Warning: Broken bones. Also this chapter may be a bit confusing to read. Don't worry, it's supposed to be that way as Dean is very disoriented/ill in this chapter.
She walks back over to Dean and crouches down beside him once more. Her hand goes out and comes to rest gently on his forehead. To her aggravation he’s burning up and not responding at all. “Dean?” She asks, loudly. “Open your eyes.” God, if he gets truly sick or something what are they going to do? The thought is like a douse of ice water on her previously warm feelings because it isn’t like they can just take him to the nearest ER.
Sweet heaven above! Dean was startled to find the light was not a light after all, but a soul. Up close the inside of the soul stood the ghostly outline of a young man with tousled hair and piercing eyes. It was a stark contrast to the twisted evil creature the soul was becoming on the outside. It was twisted into a shape no human could ever hope to achieve with burnt, black skin hanging loosely off it. The face was barely more than a twisted skull with pitch black eyes and matching horns protruding from above its temples. There was a bloody knife held tight in one of its clawed hands and Dean found himself horrified all over again. Against his will his eyes followed the path of the knife and he felt a sharp stab of something when it dangled above an equally bloody soul bound to a slab before the soul. Dean couldn’t help it; he backpedaled. This was the soul he was here for, there was no doubt about it, but he couldn’t help being scared of the creature in front of him. It wasn’t so much the demonic appearance of the soul; he’d expected that on some level, but nothing had prepared him for seeing just how far it’d become.
“Get the fuck off me!” Castiel screeched as he clawed at Sam’s face. The younger alpha had him outmatched in weight but not in wit. And unfortunately for Sam Castiel was willing to fight dirty. He bit and clawed and cursed as he struggled to overthrow Sam’s bulk. The gun was right there...all he had to do was be the first one to get it.
It took all the effort he had not to fight back, but in the end Gabriel let himself be dragged towards the club’s entrance. He still didn’t feel right but perhaps it was just performance anxiety rearing its head? Yeah, that had to be it. “I hope you’re right…” He muttered as they got closer. The Inferno’s sign looked down from above, casting an eerie red glow on their skins.
Out in the sunlight, away from all the horrors of Hell the soul still glowed like the brightest star Dean had seen. It was beyond beautiful, and something deep within him wanted nothing more than to protect it from harm. Not for the first time Dean had to wonder what the soul had done to entice him in so short of a time. It was mystifying but there would be time for reflection later, he was sure. Now it was time to put the soul back where it belonged.
That garnered another laugh out of the demon as it smirked widely at him. “If only we had the time!” It sighed dramatically as it sashayed closer to him.
The hard edge of the unfinished wooden box bit into his hands but Castiel barely cared as he fell to his knees in the dirt. There, silhouetted by the headlights from the car, and head bowed, he finally paused. There would be no coming back from this, he knew. No second chances. No take-backs. Once he did this Castiel would be completely, irredeemably, damned.
Still, there’s no time to wallow in thinking of ‘what if’s’. Getting to his feet is another small torture, and Dean can barely cough down the strangled noise that rises in his throat, but he makes it. By the time he crosses the bedroom to the attached bathroom he’s practically dragging himself, only to come to a dead stop when he reaches the threshold.
this. He climbed onto the bed and settled into place straddling the omega’s bound body. Dean was a long line of tense rigidness underneath him, and oh so beautiful. Castiel wanted to take the time to worship him like a fallen god cast asunder yet at the same time he wanted to rip Dean apart with his teeth. “You’re so, so good.” He told Dean as he draped himself over the tense form, enveloping him in a terrible parody of am embrace. Dean was hot under him, burning up, and the feel of his body against Castiel's, even without moving, made his cock twitch in interest.
“Sorry Gabe.” Castiel said as he edged his way closer to his brother and his food. He had healed up well in the intervening weeks and looked happier than Gabriel could remember seeing him. While Gabriel was fairly sure a lot of that had to do with the angel coming up behind him he was grateful to see it nonetheless. Castiel deserved to heal from all the trauma he’d been through--they all did--and now with Asmodeus gone it finally felt like they were on their way to making it a reality.
“You--are you fuckin’ kidding me right now?!” Sam yelped, clearly not buying it and edging towards being pissed. “You look like you’ve got broken ribs and an impressive shiner and you want me to believe you ‘fell down the stairs’?” His voice rose in his hysteria. He looked Dean over with eyes wide as dinner plates. “What really happened?”
Speaking of moving...what was it? There in the distance, partially obscured by the smoke shone a beautiful blue light. Even at a distance it was beyond stunning, so shining and pure, Dean barely felt able to witness it. What could possibly shine like that? He wondered as he continued through the fray. Surely it wasn’t...was it? Dean mulled over the possibility for a split second before he made up his mind; no matter what it was he had to check it out. He fought like an angel possessed, using his sword and wings to keep the vile bastards at bay as he struggled his way towards it.
“Drive safe, both of you.” Meg told them, barely holding back a wave of tears that were threatening to escape. “I’ll be waiting for your call.” Then, before Hannah could see her cry, Meg turned and fled back towards the house. Behind her she heard the car start and pull out.
There, leaning across the wall from the bed (and when did he get back in bed?) is none other than Castiel Novak himself. The alpha is a sight for tired, and watery eyes. He looks almost as tired as Dean feels--there’s dark smudges under his eyes and his perpetual messy dark hair looks like he’s been running his hand through it. He’s dressed normal in a pair of faded, ripped jeans and an equally faded green Mt. Dew t-shirt. He looks good and despite the situation he’s in Dean finds himself licking his lips in appreciation. “Hello Dean.” The alpha rumbles.
It took some searching but finally Dean found them--buried in a grave in the middle of a field in West Virginia. Between one blink and the next he and the soul had travelled there, the latter still cradled by his wings. It took little effort to exhume the pitiful grave, and Dean felt a stab of remorse that the beautiful soul hadn’t warranted something better. “I’m sorry, bud.” He told the soul, unsurprised for when it merely buried itself further into his wings. Hell aside, the poor thing seemed starved for affection and Dean was determined to do what he could while he still had the chance.
Gabriel blinked, obviously taken aback by the venom in his brother’s voice. He gaped wordlessly for a moment before deflating all at once like someone had let all the air out of him. “Cas…” He sighed, his gaze flitting away from the furious blue eyes staring at him. “It wasn’t supposed to be like that.” He said, the words so quiet they were practically a whisper. “Balth took me to a club, I didn’t expect what happened to happen.”
“Y-yeah?” Sam chokes out. He shakes his head, forcing himself to snap out of it. “You okay?” He asks as he moves in closer wanting to see for his own eyes that Dean’s safe.
Dean didn’t need to be told twice--between one blink and the next he was at the hunter’s back, half afraid he was going to get the door slammed on him after all. Thankfully the hunter not only let him in but waved him towards the small table and chair set in the corner before he continued on further into the room. Dean followed eagerly, looking around curiously as he went.
From their position in the front seat Hannah smiled sadly up at Meg. “I will.” They promised. “Keep yourself safe until then and get out as soon as you can. I’ll be waiting for you.” They glanced into the rearview mirror at Dean for a long moment before turning back to Meg. “We’d better get going.”
“There is a situation.” Sam said, his voice still oddly informal despite his exposure to the humans. “Bobby’s already briefed us and we’re going to need your help.” His hazel eyes travelled past Gabriel to lock onto Castiel and Dean. “We have work to do.”
“Dean? Are you okay?” A voice asked from behind his right shoulder, successfully snapping Dean back into the present. He glanced over his shoulder to see Sam, his (arguably) favorite brother giving him a knowing look. Though Dean was technically older than Sam he’d never been able to hide anything from the younger angel. Generally it was an annoying trait, because who actively enjoyed hanging around someone who could read you like a book?, but right now he was grateful for it. Though there was absolutely nothing okay about any of this, Dean or otherwise, he mustered up a shaky grin. It wouldn’t do any good to break down now, and since none of them were getting out of here, the only way to go was through. “I’m fine.” He reassured his second even as he was grasping for courage he didn’t necessarily feel. He’d heard a human phrase once about ‘faking it ‘til you made it’ and while he was fairly sure it wasn’t for something as serious as laying siege to Hell, Dean clung to it. Who knew, maybe if he believed it long enough they could actually pull this insane idea off.
Dirt poured in from a jagged hole the size of Castiel’s hand near his head, surprising him. He didn’t know what he had been expecting to find on the other side of this wooden box but dirt wasn’t it. Still, he wasn't about to give up. It was an awkward angle but he thrust both his hands into the hole, ignoring the way the sharp edges dug into his skin, and pulled.
Unlike the rest of them which had been painted deep red the final door was an ominous black and it led straight down to the basement. If there was one place Asmodeus would be, it’d be there. Sweat had broken out on Gabriel’s neck and forehead as he looked at the door, remembering the last time he’d been confronted with it. He’d been half delirious with pain and beat to hell but he vividly remembered the way the matte black paint seemed to be a void opening in front him, like a monster with its jaw unhinged ready to devour his soul. He shuddered and stuffed the fear back down with effort before he slowly reached out for the handle. Just like last time it opened on soundless hinges as it swung inward revealing nothing but more darkness beyond.
“You know,” Balthazar, Gabriel’s not long enough lost cousin, drawled as he eyed the shorter man. “Between the two of you I’d have pegged our dear Cassie as the reluctant one, not you.” His natural British accent made his words sound smug but the look he was giving Gabriel was anything but. If Gabriel didn’t know any better he’d say it was almost pity in those blue eyes staring at him. “I thought you wanted to have an  adventure?”
Finally the demon pushed him back, that smug shark-grin full on its face as it eyed him over. “Not bad for a hunter,” it all but purred, “not bad at all. Too bad you won’t need those skills where you’re going!”
“Don’t just stand here! Get in here, boy!” John’s thunderous voice boomed again, startling the younger angel out of his revelry. His tawny wings folded tightly against his back, a sure sign of submission, as he hastened to comply. To his surprise there was more than John in the room when he was in it far enough to properly see: there was also Bobby, an angel rumored to be older than John and possibly even an Eldest; and Mary, who was rumored to have been involved with John at some point before she came to her senses and was a fierce garrison commander in her own right.
He thinks as he turns, completing the small circuit he started outside the doorway, and comes to a stop just off to the right side. They had allowed him into the room earlier, but he’d been pushed out several minutes ago by some of the nurses so they could get Dean cleaned up. Sam didn’t really get it since Dean looked like he’d been cleaned thoroughly before being brought into the room, but who was he to argue? Besides, if he angled himself just right he could still see what was going on to an extent. He did so now, feeling smug as he caught a glimpse of Dean’s face. It wasn’t the best view since the nurses had closed the curtains surrounding the bed as well but there’s just enough of a gap that Sam could get a fleeting look inside.
“He killed you.” Dean said quietly, meeting Gabriel’s gaze head on, his borrowed face a careful mask. “That’s why Bobby sent me here to help you stop him, before he does something similar to someone else.” He paused, eyeing Gabriel for any indication of objection, and upon finding none, he went on. “I know I don’t seem like much and all but Bobby’s rarely wrong. I know you don’t believe me but if he says we can defeat Asmodeus together then I believe him.”
“It’s probably for the best.” Meg sighs as she fiddles with the cuffs binding Dean’s wrists. “I know we gotta get moving here but he needs all the rest he can get. He’s going to need it.”
At Castiel’s words Dean froze, the blood draining out of his face. He didn’t need anyone to spell it out for him--he knew what kind of ‘talk’ Castiel wanted to have and it wasn’t one that’d end well for Dean. He swallows hard, glancing between Castiel, the gun, and Sam. “No.” He says, and yeah, there’s a definite wobble in there this time. “I don’t want to have a ‘little talk’ with you.” Fuck, he didn’t want to talk to him in the first place! He was sure Castiel had to be picking up his scent--the sour smell of wilted flowers was making his own nose tickle. “Just put down the gun and let’s discuss this, okay?”
at them; he doesn’t want to know how bad it’d hurt to try touching them. He feels lightheaded and without conscious decision he finds himself sinking downwards. The cold hardness of the door frame and the coolness of the tiled floor against his bare butt register though to Dean though the sensations are distant. Muted.
“Hey.” Dean reached across the table, completely ignoring the plate of cold food that his sleeve was no doubt resting in the middle of, just to land a hand on Gabriel’s arm. “It doesn’t matter if you believe me or not now. You will.”
Dean staggered back at the force of Sam’s outburst, tearing his eyes away from Castiel. “I remember.” He replied quietly, hurt by the accusation that he’d somehow forgotten everything Castiel put him through after still recovering from it for the past few months. “I’m not asking you to care.” He finally says at length, unable to look at Sam in the eyes. “I’m just saying we should be better than he is.”
The guitar laden sounds of Whitesnake’s ‘In the Still of the Night’ vibrated through the car, trying its best to lift up Castiel’s mood along with the music. Any other time the familiar music combined with the otherwise stillness of the early morning would have been a balm upon his soul but this morning the effect was lost on him. It was a shame too: the sun had just barely crested the horizon leaving the world in a brightening darkness that Castiel loved to witness. Today, however, his hands tightened upon the steering wheel as he first glanced at the passenger seat where Gabriel was sound asleep before moving to glance at the backseat where Dean was sitting stock-still like a statue. Castiel shook his head as he turned his attention back to the road, his mouth settled into a tight line of frustration.
Sam doesn’t say anything but from the corner of his eye Dean sees him pull his phone from his pocket. Relief and some other nameless emotions bubble to the forefront as he watched Sam walk away, phone to his ear. Letting out a breath he turns back to find Castiel staring up at him.
It was time to go. Castiel found himself inching back, little by little towards the safety of his headlights and his car. In front of him the demon just cackled, a knowing look on its face. “Maybe we can hook up in another couple hundred years?” It jeered, clearly enjoying itself. “We could make a hot team, you and I!!!”
Both Hannah and Gadreel blinked at him wordlessly, shocked into speechlessness. Dean eyes first Gadreel then Hannah, his nervousness increasing. Whatever it was, it was bad, he thinks, and feels sick for it. He’s suddenly not sure he wants to know, and it shows in the way the scent of distressed omega begins filling the room.
...Then he remembered waking up in that hotel room with no memory of how he’d gotten there. Remembered the way Bathazar’s face had crumpled as he cried in a way Gabriel had never seen from his stoic cousin before. And then there was Castiel, returning to the hotel after he’d gone and done the stupid thing by selling his soul to save a worthless piece of shit like Gabriel. Fury raced up his spine, revitalizing him. How could he have been so stupid? Gabriel had always known he was a piece of shit, but to have it constantly rubbed in his face for a year as Castiel’s time ticked down? And been unable to do a damn thing about it? It’d been beyond infuriating and he clung to the feeling now, letting it chase away the cold chill. “You stupid son of a bitch!” He choked out, knowing his brother couldn’t hear him. A few more choked breathes followed but by then Gabriel was unsurprised to realize he was crying.
? Hell was..Hell! It was full of smoke and brimstone and souls getting tortured in ways Dean couldn’t even
A sudden knock at the motel room door broke through the companionable silence causing all three of them to look up. Gabriel raised his eyebrows at Castiel as he put his half-eaten burger down and rose. “Are you expecting company?” He asked, reaching for the silver knife in his belt at his brother’s shake of the head. Inwardly his nerves were aflutter, wondering who could possibly be on the other side of the door. Balthazar had still been in London the last they had spoken which left... any number of unsavory creatures out for revenge.
---”Stop!” John’s voice was like a crack of thunder in the otherwise still room, echoing through it with a level of authority that only he could command. “What Bobby didn’t make clear is you’re going. There is no one else so don’t even think about it. You’ve been chosen and you WILL do this or else.”
“How about another bath? Hmm?” She hummed as she focused her attention back onto Dean. The poor omega certainly needed one: he was still covered in blood and semen from Castiel’s earlier visit and had been sweating like a pig ever since. Not to mention he stunk to literal high hell from the distressed pheromones and slick that was coming off, and out of his body thanks to the heat. It had taken all of Meg’s faux acting skills just to keep from wrinkling her nose at the combined odor. “I’ll make it a cool bath this time, what do you say?”
Up in the front Garth eyed his charge with sympathy in his eyes. He could feel all the sadness and hurt emanating from his passenger and it broke his heart. He hated to see someone hurting, and after being informed by Hannah that Dean had refused to go to the hospital he had been determined to make things better. So far he didn’t think he was doing that great of job but he was going to continue to try anyway. At the very least his passenger deserved it.
“Look at you! So gorgeous!” A familiar gravelly voice purrs from the vicinity of the doorway causing goosebumps to rise and Dean’s heart to sink because he knows that voice: “Cas.” He chokes through a throat that’s suddenly gone bone-dry. While Dean never considered himself a prude, he’s mighty uncomfortable; his shoulders have come up around his ears and his back is a hard line of tension where he’s automatically curled forward.
be if he gets a say in it! Just thinking about Castiel wanting him makes him all hot and bothered to the point where Dean can hardly remember his own name let alone—
He makes it to standing . . . for all of two seconds before his legs collapse under him, sending him to the floor. All the air is punched out of his lungs in one fell swoop as pain flares through his body white-hot and sharp as lightning, short-circuiting his brain. Dean gasps like a fish stuck out of water and for several agonizing seconds he can’t breathe. He gasps and gapes and hopes like hell this won’t be the way he dies before finally, finally, he manages to suck down a single breathe. It goes down like hellfire and sets off a series of coughs that rattle his entire frame.
Dean moaned in response, dazed and dizzy from the sudden burst of pain. With his eyes closed, he hadn’t seen the hit coming and the surprise of it hurt nearly as much as the accompanying pain. He moved his jaw slowly, hissing through his teeth as the small movement sent aftershocks of pain spiking through his head. It was stupid but Dean couldn’t believe Castiel had actually hit him like this. Yeah, the alpha hadn’t held back on hitting him before, but he was practically defenseless now! Dean couldn’t fight back if he wanted to (and part of him did) so what the fuck? “F-fuck off C-Cas!” He slurred out, not giving a damn what the alpha had been spouting about disrespect. What kind of alpha went around harming incapacitated omegas in the first place?
That was a question Dean had not been expecting, and he blinked a few times as he considered it. “I suppose they could have sent in the garrison.” He finally said at last, his tone thoughtful. “It certainly would make things much easier from a logistical standpoint.”
It’s a lie, and no amount of wishful thinking can change that, yet Dean’s brain clings to it for all he’s worth. It’s an impossible dream for pain fills Dean senses straight down to his soul. He nearly drowns under the conflicting sensations: the sharp burning pain as Castiel rams into him over and over, the way his hands dig deeply into the bruises covering Dean’s body. . . Grunting sobs are being steadily pushed up out of Dean’s throat further erode the dream-like state leaving him clinging to the wisps of his broken dream.
Ten minutes later Sam’s on his way back with his music off and earbuds dangling, huffing along at a nice leisurely pace when he hears it: a low pitiful moaning that sounds like a wounded animal.
The rest of the ride was spent in silence although it was much more comfortable. But before they knew it the three of them found themselves staring up at the mouth of a familiar alleyway that had both Gabriel and Castiel frowning. Despite their lives changing so much since then the alley looked much the same--the same windswept and sun faded brick walls, the same grungy green dumpster overflowing with refuse, and the same bright red door that stood between the three of them and certain hell.
The fact that an angel needed consent to take a vessel was supposed to be reassuring, Gabriel figured, but frankly he felt pretty far from reassured at the moment. How could he not be when his life was effectively circling the toilet? He shuddered and shook his head, pushing the darker thoughts to the back of his head where they belonged. “As fascinating as that is--and we’re totally going to circle back around to that at some point--you aren’t here to tell me about vessels and shit, right?” Gabriel didn’t know where the sudden calmness was coming from to infuse his words but he went with it before he lost his nerve entirely. “You said your...boss? Bobby? Knew how to deal with A-Asmodeus?” His voice broke on the name and he dropped his head to eye his plate rather than see whatever look the angel surely had on his borrowed face over it.
Despite the fact he was trussed up like a Thanksgiving turkey awaiting dinner, Dean padded over to the door. Up close the door was steel and just as solid as Dean feared it would be. There was also no handle on the inside which meant Dean was well and truly trapped. “Fuck!” He shouted, and in a fit of desperation kicked the door. Pain shot up his leg so fast his head swam and tears sprang to his eyes. “Let me out!” He screamed uselessly. “Castiel you fucker! Get me out of here!”
It had seemed like a good idea earlier when Cas was rutting up against him in the shower as they got ready but now that he’s had a few hours of exposure, Dean’s over it. Now he just wants to piss, go home, and go to bed. The only problem with that is Cas doesn’t seem to share his sentiments…if the hand clamped down on his right thigh is any indication. Dean hadn’t known Cas was such a possessive bastard but once the guy got a few drinks in him, well. Dean would be lying if he said he didn’t get a bit of a thrill out of the way Castiel’s inner alpha seems to rear up wanting to keep the omega for himself. Now if he’d just listen to what Dean was saying….
, he thinks, bitter, as he heads back to the dumpster. He hadn’t planned on spending quality time there but there’s no other options. He curls back up into the same position he was the night before, pulling in tighter. The less that can be seen of him the better. Hopefully if anyone does see him they’ll just think he’s a street person rather than a semi-famous one who was kidnapped and tortured against their will. . .
“Oh good! You’re awake!” Meg brightens when she notices him watching her and she can’t help but outright grin at the hungry way he’s looking at the soup she’s holding. “I brought you something.” More like she snuck him something; Castiel will be less than pleased if he finds out. “They called Castiel into work today so it’s just me and you and I thought you could use it.” She told Dean as she carefully lowered herself to crouch beside the bed.
“You’re a fucking disappointment!” The ghost of John Winchester shouts in his head and Dean cringes under the weight of the phantom. Things are bad enough without adding his father into the mix, he thinks bitterly. John was another alpha who’d set out to hurt Dean, and much like Castiel he had succeeded in doing so. It just figured that he’d rear his opinions when Dean was being hurt yet again by another alpha he trusted. When Castiel kisses him, Dean lets him. What’s the point in trying to fight anymore?
Still it was a good minute or so before the two began to calm down and Gabriel was still chuckling when he finally turned back to look at Dean. “It’s the way Cassie’s face looks ninety percent of the time!” He crowed, obviously delighted at getting to tease his brother. “Haven’t you noticed? He used to look the same way when he was a baby and had a dirty diaper!”
Dean thinks as he stares up at his house. They’d gotten ready there and had left in Castiel’s ugly car. Now that he’s back and hurting and alone Dean doesn’t know what to think. In his mind's eye he can see himself and Castiel heading out to the club… They had paused on the porch and Dean could still feel the way the wooden banister had felt digging into his spine as Castiel dipped him over it for a searing kiss. He looked away with a frown, grateful when the image disappeared before him.
It’s not a surprise when Dean doesn’t answer her or make any moves towards getting up. Still Meg sighs anyway, resigned and heading towards exasperated. She doesn’t blame Dean--it isn’t his fault his body has gone completely haywire thanks to what her husband did but still. It’s a whole lot of unfair that she’s the one stuck cleaning up the mess (literally) while Castiel watches. “Okay.” She repeats, mostly to psych herself up as she moves in position. Dean doesn’t react when she grabs him, nor when she lifts him bodily off the floor.
To Dean’s profound relief Castiel didn’t seem put off by Dean’s stumbling and stammering and general stupidity. Glancing away from the road, he fixed Dean with a brief worried look before resuming watching where he was going. “It’s a bar…” He said slowly, and Dean didn’t need to be able to see it to hear the frown in the alpha’s words. “and it’s a rather popular nightclub as well which was why I proposed we leave so late. I’m not sure what else would be open this time of evening but we can go somewhere else if you’d like?”
It was almost comical the way he slithered out of bed and got dressed in the dark. A laugh bubbled up unexpectedly as he realized he was acting just like a teenager in a sitcom trying to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night. Better late than never, he figured, having never had the opportunity to try it out himself. When he finally deemed himself ready he slunk his way to the door, only to pause at the threshold to glance back at his brother.
Gabriel was curious as fuck, loath as he was to admit it. In addition to hunting and the wild shit he’d seen and done, the young hunter was no stranger when it came to sex. Though picking up women in the towns they visited on cases was a completely different thing from going to a specialized club, he was beginning to realize. The things one did at clubs like those were simply something he could only imagine and the possibilities were both arousing and terrifying in spades. It was one thing to love ‘em and leave ‘em the next day, but what if he screwed something up in the club? A place called The Inferno sounded ominous and the whole thing was very much fucking with Gabriel’s head in a way he didn’t like. “You’ve been in there before?” It was another question he’d already asked, but like the other he simply couldn’t help himself.
He didn’t think Sam or Bobby would have ever remembered him recounting the story but apparently someone did. Either way Dean was floored, and hurt, that his so-called family thought he could just up and leave like that. Like, seriously? Dean was a lot of things but he wasn’t one to just up and leave like his family was some ditchable prom date.
“Just watch.” Castiel told him without looking back. He wound his way through the crowd like an expert and didn’t seem to see, or possibly care about the looks he and Dean were getting from the people in line. He kept going until he reached the doors where a tall well-built man was standing in front of the doors. “Hello Gadreel.” He greeted the man even as he reached back to grab ahold of Dean. “I brought a friend with me tonight.”
him! Dean thought, dismayed, as he stared at his reflection in the mirror above the sink. He looked like he’d went through a prize fight and lost--his jaw was black and blue and his nose was definitely crooked from where he’d gotten clocked across the face. He closed his eyes, foolishly hoping the sight would go away. Alas, when he opened them the bruises were still there. It was going to be next to impossible to hide, and worse yet, Dean had no reasonable explanation on hand.
For a moment Benny simply gaped at him, mouth hanging open in shock before he tossed his head back and let loose with a bellowing laugh. It’s a jovial sound, and just like the silence from a few moments ago, it helped ease something deep within Dean. He grinned, caught up in the humor, and before he knew it, he’s laughing alongside Benny.
Leaving the town behind Dean found himself wandering alongside a back street lined with houses every few feet. It was quiet and quaint and felt like a balm to his frayed nerves. He wandered from there onto another nearly identical only to stop dead at the edge of someone’s yard. There, laying half forgotten in a tangle of bushes was the most beautiful thing Dean could ask for: a giant bright blue tarp. It was the closest thing to a blanket that the wild could offer and Dean wanted it. Taking the chance, he looked to see if there was anyone watching before he slipped into the yard. Staying hunched and ready to run at a moment’s notice, Dean carefully picked his way over to the tarp. It was tangled up good, which was probably why it’d just been left, but Dean hardly cared. It wasn’t easy moving with one arm but he carefully worked the tarp free.
Another turn brought him onto a residential street capped by a massive brick school that looked closer to being a castle than anything else. The sight paled in comparison to what was directly across from it, however, for located in the bottom of a three-story brick building was a lit neon sign declaring it was a 24-7 diner. “Bingo!” Gabe crowed, uncaring that he was talking to himself as he hurried down the street towards the diner. While it wasn’t a bar he was certain the place sold coffee considering the hour and that was good enough for him.
He got a wan smile in response from Gabriel but that was it. Fortunately for the both of them a third head popped up just over Gabriel’s shoulder, scowling at the both of them. “Are the two of you about done with this love fest?” Balthazar drawled, his thick accent making his words sound bored. “Because the neighbors are starting to stare and frankly that seems more trouble than either of you need right now.” Just like that he was gone again, disappearing back into the relative safety of the hotel room.
?! Horror flooded through him alongside embarrassment as he recalled all the things he and Castiel had done together. He eyed Meg nervously, suddenly fully aware of how vulnerable he was. Did she know what he and Castiel had done? She didn’t seem angry, which was good, but did that mean Dean needed to bring it up? Should he just ignore it and pretend everything was fine? “He...has a wife?” He finally squeaked out, still having a hard time believing it.
Castiel laughed--he couldn’t help it. He hunched over as far as he could in the chair, his shoulders shaking with obvious relief and the slightly hysterical sounds of someone who’d been sitting in the hospital for far too long. “We won.” He finally replied in a choked voice and lifted his head to grin at his brother through the tears streaming down his face. “Thanks to Dean and Sam and Garth we won. The women are safe, they’re being treated but they’re expected to live. Asmodeus is dead.”
Once he has it in his arm Dean doesn’t waste any time. He books it out of the yard and down the street as fast as his wobbling legs will carry him. It isn’t until he’s an entire street over that he finally gives in and wraps himself up in the tarp. While it doesn’t provide any warmth it stops the chill from biting through his clothes and it’s enough of a relief Dean nearly cries from it.
Given the early hour there isn’t a lot of people out but there’s enough that Dean finds himself drawing back into the alley before he realizes what he’s doing.
“Hush!” Castiel commands, his voice dropping into the deeper register of pure alpha dominance. It sends a shockwave shuddering through Dean’s still-struggling frame, but it does the trick—his words die on his tongue.
“C’mon Sam, get a grip!” He gripes out loud, rolling his eyes at himself. All this thinking of Dean has gotten him worked up, that’s all. There’s nothing wrong here! Disgusted with himself he’s about to walk away when the breeze picks up again. It’s just cold enough to make him shiver in his heavily sweat-damp clothes, and he’s more than ready to get out of there and into the nearest hot shower when he hears it again. A high-pitched whimper full of pain that makes Sam’s hair stand on end to hear. Whatever’s making it is obviously badly hurting and Sam turns instinctively towards it.
After a moment Gadreel nodded, apparently satisfied. “Looks good.” He said to Castiel, his voice giving nothing away with it’s quiet calmness. He turned back to the doors behind him and pushed the closest one open and ushered them inside. “Have a fun time.”
“Oh hey Sam!” The dark-haired beta gave a wave as he looked up from the comic he was reading. “It’s been pretty quiet around here.” He waved to indicate the empty store. “Though it’s still early I suppose. How’s your brother doing?”
Still, one couldn’t stall forever. With one last glance back Dean took in the reassuring looks of Sam and Garth before he turned back to the wasteland of the Pit before them. “Fake it ‘til you make it!” He muttered under his breath as he led the charge.
in every respect of the word. From this close the smell hits Sam with all the finesse of a freight train: sweat and dirt, vomit and piss, and something far more sinister that speaks of festering wounds waft up from Dean in a terrible bouquet. It’s beyond terrible and Sam suddenly realizes how out of his depth he is here. He may have portrayed a medical personal on screen during that one confusing episode, but he has no medical training at all to fall back on.
“I know it’s none of my business,” Garth piped up from the front just as Dean’s phone went still once again. “But let me guess--jealous ex? Whew! I’ve been there before. It ain’t fun, let me tell ya!” He took one hand off the wheel and waved it around to emphasize his point. “I know it sucks but you can’t let it get ya down, ya hear me?”
"Oh yes." Castiel remains standing at his side, his hand still holding onto Dean's arm. He pulled his arm closer and began rubbing careful calming circles over the back of Dean’s hand. "You're tense," he pointed out like Dean didn't know. "Do you want to go somewhere else?"
Castiel whirled, nearly face-planting back into the dirt from his stiff legs, shocked to find a woman standing not three feet away from him. How long had she been standing there? He hadn’t heard anyone come up behind him! Then her words sunk in and left him gaping in confusion, “About time?” He parroted, caught flat-foot about this whole ordeal thus far.
Dean opens his mouth only to shut it again without uttering a sound. It’s not that he doesn’t want to answer Sam but more that he feels . . . strange. Not quite right in a way he can’t explain. He lifts his head to look his brother in the eyes when he feels it--a sharp burning pain building on the left side of his neck. It’s directly over the spot where the mating bite is and Dean scrambles at the bandages that are covering the mark. It’s been healed for over a month now, yet he still keeps it covered so it can’t be seen. He’s regretting it now as he tears at the bandages with a frantic need for them to be off. The burning is getting worse, traveling up his neck. Distantly Dean can hear Sam calling his name and the sounds of sirens growing closer but he can’t care at the moment.
“You’re a pain in the ass.” She tells Dean, though there’s no real heat behind it. He doesn’t respond which she expected at this point, so she ignores him and rolls her eyes to the ceiling. There’s more cameras here than in the bathroom so she knows Castiel has a perfect view of her.  Glaring at the nearest one she flips it off with both hands. “Fuck you!” She mouths for good measure before she finally pushes off from the door frame.
He thought, barely repressing the urge to roll his eyes at Sam’s overly loud hysterics. “Will you tone it down some?” He gripped, shooting his brother a witheringly glare. “I tripped coming down the stairs, do you really need to broadcast it to the entire neighborhood?”
Then there’s no more time left. Not to think, nor plead, nor even breathe; between one breath Dean feels the tip of Castiel’s cock nudging at his hole and the next he’s ramming into him with what feels like all his might. It
The thought filtered through Dean’s head slowly, trickling in alongside consciousness. He shivered, still more asleep than awake as he wondered what had happened to his blankets. Even when he wasn’t nesting it was rare that he slept without a blanket or two on the bed. Shifting groggily, he went to reach for the blanket...only to realize he couldn’t. “What the?” He slurred, waking up just a fraction more as he tried moving his arms again. He wasn’t imagining it--his arms didn’t move. Dean blinked blurry eyes,  perplexed. This was certainly strange to say the least. Both of his arms had been tightly pinned behind him by...something...he didn’t know what.
He wondered, flabbergasted. He just couldn’t understand it. Unbidden tears began slipping down his cheeks. Dean hunched over, feeling a mix of embarrassed and ashamed, but he couldn’t stop if he wanted to.
“Know what?” Dean echoed, hackles raised. “Was there an invasion or something?” Surely that could be the only explanation for why the entire garrison was crowding around looking at Dean like he’d hung the moon.
For all that he tried to look suave and cool Balthazar puffed up like an excited cat at Gabriel’s acquiescence. “You won’t regret this!” He gushed, looking positively delighted that his cousin had finally come ‘round. Then, before Gabriel had a chance to overthink things again, Balthazar reached out and grabbed him by the wrist. “No time like the present!” The British man declared as he practically dragged Gabriel down the alley behind him. “You’re going to love it, just you wait!”
Everything felt like some kind of dream, he pondered as he continued to lay there and watch the clouds go by.
Dean had thought about it all day but he still couldn’t put into words the undeniable pull he felt towards Castiel. To him it felt like there was a rope, or even some kind of chain, linking them together, that Dean found impossible to ignore. He had wondered most of the day if Castiel felt it as well but he didn’t have the nerve to bring it up to the alpha.
about it hurt soul-deep and left Gabriel feeling like he was going to puke. The feeling only intensified as Asmodeus took several steps closer to the driver’s side door. “Holy shit! Holy fucking
A bar in a nightclub? Dean blinked, lifting his head slightly as he considered it. Neither one was really his type of thing—he was more of a cheap whiskey in a dive bar or a six pack at home kinda guy—but oh, he was tempted. How could he not be? Castiel wasn’t the full reason for it either, though Dean would be lying if he said the alpha wasn’t a big part of it.
"Well, if you're sure..." Garth trailed off, and Dean didn't need to see it to know the guy was up there pouting his disappointment. He seemed like a good guy, and had they met under different circumstances Dean could see him possibly becoming friends with him. The phone buzzed in his lap again but Dean barely glanced at it. From the time he'd woken until now Castiel had been calling practically non-stop. He'd filled up Dean's voice mail in under an hour and had simply kept going from there. The phone finally clicked off signaling that he'd hung up but Dean knew it wouldn't be long before he tried again.
Dean wasn't the only one Castiel had kidnapped? Horror bloomed hot and heavy in his chest at the knowledge. His chest felt constricted, a vice clamped around his heart. How many? Dean wanted to ask. How many omegas had Castiel done this to? How many had he pretended to date before kidnapping? And what had happened to them afterwards? Had they went back to their lives like nothing had happened? Or had Castiel harmed them in some way? Had he killed them? The possibilities flitted through his mind in rapid succession, each one worse than the last. Dean was beyond horrified; who wouldn't be? Before all this he never would have imagined Castiel--gentle, bumbling and awkward Castiel--could ever be tied to something like this. It didn't make a lick of sense, and had he not been right in the middle of it, Dean wouldn't have believed it. Faceless omegas slipped through his mind like pictures on a grainy reel as he tried to picture it.
For a time after the angel left nothing of import happened in that idyllic field. The breeze blew, gently swaying the grass in its wake as woodland creatures roamed to their content. Truly it was like any other day...right up until it wasn’t.
idea in his opinion. If nothing else it would hopefully go a long way towards making him chill the fuck out so he could relax and enjoy this. “And yeah. The meatballs sound awesome!”
When he came up for air the second time he stumbled away from the sink. His stomach sloshed on the full side of painful but Dean grinned, satisfied. He'd realized the faucets were touch activated by pure accident; he'd tripped on the bathroom rug on the second or possibly third day and had nearly brained himself off the sink. He had been sure he was hallucinating the water coming from the faucet at first but to his delight it had been real. Dean didn't know how long ago that was but he'd been sneaking drinks from the faucet every time he was in the bathroom since.
A rumble bubbled up from his chest, a sure sign of how pleased he was. “You know,” he said conversationally as he leaned in closer to Dean’s neck and the source of the intoxicating smell. He stopped just short of being in licking distance, a feat that wasn’t easy, and looked up to capture Dean’s terrified green gaze with his own. “You can run and hide all you want but you’ll never be free of me. One way or the other I will find you and I will have you. No. Matter. What.” Regretfully he pulled back though he brought a hand up to cup Dean’s cheek gently. “I’ll see you soon my sweet omega.” He told him before he turned, and as quietly as he’d came, he left.
Gabriel blinked, flummoxed. Distantly he heard the familiar tune of Ace of Base ‘I Saw the Sign’ start over the diner’s sound system but all his attention was on the stranger. “Have we met?” He muttered, wondering when his life had gotten so weird that strangers in diners seemed to know who he was. Gabriel was fairly sure he didn’t know the guy, at least he semi-hoped not because it’d have been a damn shame to forget that face.
“You know why I can’t!” He shouted across the room, his face turning red in his fury. “He’s nothing more than a hole to be used! Nothing more! Why should I help a whore out with its heat? It isn’t my problem!” Castiel had made a quick exit after that, slamming the door behind him in the process. He’s remained gone most of the night but he’d finally returned early in the morning and apologized. Meg had been having none of it. Unlike her husband she had remained up watching the camera feed as Dean slowly deteriorated before her eyes. Meg didn’t understand it since she didn’t have heats of her own but as night had turned into dawn she knew she needed to do something. If nothing else maybe providing some comfort would go towards helping Dean. If nothing else, Meg was sure it couldn’t hurt any.
Dropping his hand back to the railing he sighed and looked around the stairwell for inspiration. There wasn’t a whole lot to see—the walls were plain white painted concrete, and aside from small deep dark blue signs indicating that indicated the levels, they were bare. He turned to look at the door he’d come through, eyeing the ‘Level 5’ sign apathetically.
Until then, Sam was going to keep running. It wasn’t like there was anything else keeping him occupied: since they were down a leading man production on the show had ground to a halt until the writers could figure out how to explain “Jensen’s” sudden absence. Given the way the season had been going so far Sam wasn’t sure how they were going to pull something out of thin air, and frankly he didn’t envy them the job. Especially since it seemed like Dean’s Jensen character and Castiel’s Misha could possible have a love connection in the future considering the chemistry between the two on screen…
He watched the hunter settle down on the edge of the unoccupied bed and he took that as a cue to stand. “Our conversation can wait a few hours until morning.” Dean said, eyeing the way the hunter looked ready to fall over at the merest push. Before the hunter could open his mouth to agree, or more likely argue, Dean crossed the room to stand beside him. He reached out pressing two fingers gently to the middle of Gabriel’s forehead. The human’s eyes fluttered and closed as he slipped away into sleep. Dean smiled to himself, satisfied, as he carefully positioned Gabriel back on the bed. It was highly likely the man would be pissed in the morning but Dean had no regrets--things would look better once he’d gotten some sleep behind him. Until then he settled back into the chair alongside the table to wait for the hunters to wake.
“Skipping right past the pleasantries, I like that!” Meg grinned her approval, flashing her teeth at him. “To start you’re here because our dear Castiel has decided you’re worth keeping around. Me? I’m not sure about that yet since we just met ‘an all but I’ll let you know! Secondly, Castiel is out of the building!” She laughed at her own joke, leaning forward again. “He’s at work duffus, where else would he be? It’d be too suspicious if he up and disappeared at the same time as you, duh! So for now you’re stuck with lil ‘ole me!”
Dean blinked, drawn out of his stupor. He looked up, meeting Garth's eyes in the rearview and shook his head. "Just take me home please." He requested quietly. The thought of going anywhere else sounded like torture. It was bad enough that Hannah had kept insisting on calling an ambulance, or at the very least ensuring that Dean went to the hospital. They meant well, Dean knew, but going to the hospital was the absolute last thing he wanted to do. What good would come of it anyway? There wasn't anything the hospital could do except offer some overpriced generic painkillers before sending him on his way. For less than half the price Dean could grab a six pack and some Tylenol and wallow away in the privacy of his own home.
Gabriel froze, clearly recalling the brightly lit staircase that should have been there but he was too late--before he could turn to tell his companions it was a trap something hard and deadly fast swung out of the darkness and cracked him right in the head. Gabriel crumpled and went down hard to the sounds of his name being called from somewhere far away... Things devolved into confusion fast as Castiel and Dean went running and the lights clicked on somewhere down below revealing the brightly lit staircase and a bearded man with dark hair and a blood-splattered white suit standing there behind Gabriel’s collapsed body.
Somewhere along the line of his thoughts he’d picked a direction at random and began walking, oblivious to the world around him. How long had he been gone? Was the next thought to pop up and the realization that it could have been a decade or more made Castiel freeze in his tracks. What if too much time had passed and Gabriel was old and grey now, living out the rest of his life in a nursing home somewhere? Or, what if Gabriel had gotten jumped on a hunt since Castiel hadn’t been there to watch his back and he was dead now? The thought made Castiel run cold as he realized how very screwed he’d be if Gabriel was indeed dead. He currently had nothing in his name; no wallet, though the credit cards inside it were probably expired anyway, and no clothes beyond the ones currently on his back. That had him looking down at himself, frowning at the dirt covered jeans and white shirt he was wearing. There was no blood, he noted absently, which meant Gabriel had redressed him before planting him. The thought bothered him more than he thought it should’ve as he stood there shivering in the warm evening air.
With numb fingers, he managed to push the end button on the call, plunging the garage back into silence.
“Look.” Meg started, momentarily abandoning what she was doing to look over the bed at Hannah. “I know this is less than ideal and if I had any other ideas I’d absolutely wouldn’t turn him out into the cold but it’s all I got. Clarence will be back in two days, it’s going to have to be enough for Dean to get away otherwise. . .” She let the statement trail off as she frowned down at Dean. “The whole point of this is to save him. You said his brother has been looking for him?”
