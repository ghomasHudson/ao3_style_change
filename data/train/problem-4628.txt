! Castiel had never seen freckles before. He had spent a shameful amount of time looking at them, and then more time trying to count them, hovering over Dean’s sleeping head all night. When Dean had finally fallen into his deepest sleep, he had moved himself to sit on the dresser, so as to watching the window, door, and his new human.
“That’s because you talk all proper and stuff.” He chuckled, and kissed his angel lightly before escaping his arms and heading towards the bag. “Did you have any trouble?”
But then, like a switch had been flipped, the alpha looked angry and feral. A growl trickled out of his mouth. His gorgeous blue irises started bleeding alpha red, but Dean refused to heed his biological desire to stand down and present. He had fought too long to let any alpha show of aggression just make him submit. He growled back, baring his teeth and not backing down. At the dominating display, he felt more slick trickle out, and he choked down the moan that desperately wanted to escape his lips, as he clenched his fists at his sides. He was determined to stand his ground, no matter what.
“I don’t know,” he replied softly, uncomfortable with how nebulous that sounded. “My body is telling me one thing still, and my mind is yet insisting on another.”
Startled, the kid jumped a bit and cleared his throat anxiously, tucking the sign under his arm, and trying to take the bag from Castiel, only to be held off. “I can manage, thank you…?”
He hadn’t realized he had gripped Dean hard enough to hurt. Sometimes he forgot how very sharp his talons were. He shifted on Dean’s shoulder to ease his pain, and watched the shrine with narrowed eyes. There was that glow of power around the tiny shrine, and he flew off Dean’s shoulder (surprising him) and changed into his middle transformation.
The disapproval deepened, and Dean fought the urge to elbow Cas hard in the side. Instead, he smiled winningly. “Cas has said wonderful things about it, though. I am looking forward to trying it!”
Brushing his fingers over Dean’s cheeks, hand captured by Dean’s, he murmurs, “I was so shocked when Sam opened the door, looking like hell. I demanded to know who he was and where you were, and he said he was your brother and that you were in the hospital.” A tremor in his voice has Dean kissing his palm. “He… he said that you’d been shot and it wasn’t looking good. He said… that you couldn’t receive visitors because they were worried there was still a hit out on you.”
I'm testing out a few things. Please mouse over text to see translation. But, just in case, I put it at the bottom. There is a bigger "bulk" section but fewer words interspersed.
As he stretched out his shoulders, he was aware that the small spot of heat where he had been hit still vaguely humming there, and asked, “Hey Cas, did you… did you hit me on the back?”
The sulking intensified the second Dean tried to make a joke about the color being, “Blood orange,” and caused Bobby to give him a steady glare under which he folded like an old chair. He stomped off to find a broom and brush away any tiny crap on the ground, per Cas’s instructions. He left Cas doing something with white paper being folded into zigzag-shaped strips, and, when he came back, Cas already had an impressive array of strips, from about a foot long to tiny ones at three-inches. For some reason, Dean found him now twisting weeds together, and just shook his head. No fathoming the bird-demons, he figured.
Dean was summarily shoved off the pedestal and handed a white dress shirt that was very soft under his fingers, and pushed into a changing room.
“Yes, yes, okay, I’ll stop.” Dean tried for consoling, but Cas just gave him a bird-based bitchface. He smothered his chuckle because it reminded him of his little brother, and tried to look penitent.
Null-betas are practically human. Their eyes don't change at all. They have no special senses. They have no superior strength. They rarely mate with anything other than another null because other bloodlines don't want to dilute their genes. They are the majority.
Michael smiled indulgently, pleased with the efforts. “I do apologize, Vincenzo. My requests were rather unorthodox.”
He was just about to check the water situation when Cas finally returned with a brown paper bag filled with food.
Dean could tell Cas wanted a break from the real question, and snapped, “No, Cas. Why did you pin me down and lick me until I fucking came? What happened to not wanting me?”
All these things were constant quiet whispers in Castiel’s own head when he thought about Dean. For some reason, it surprised him that his brother was in the same emotional boat, feeling that pull to breed. Perhaps it was part of being an Alpha?
Dean looked up from where he was leaning against the counter. Bobby was wearing his usual clothing with the same ball cap on his head. Bobby had put down his cup and was now beadily staring at him.
Although, despite himself, he had managed to get the shy, blue-eyed dream man to hold his hand as they watched the ripples in the pond get stronger, noting there were fewer petals on the tree each time he looked. He didn’t know what that meant, but he suspected it wasn’t good.
Sighing, he smoothed a hand over the cover of his book, scratching idly at the pricing sticker with his fingernail, and said, “It’s fine, I suppose. I can stay here. I just can’t go back yet.”
A troll in a small gray apron stumbled drunkenly into the small clearing, swearing darkly at the dead gnome. “Gor! Shez gonna kill me fer certain now!” It bent to look at the baby and shot backwards, eyes darting around the trees, landing on Dean and Cas’s presence not too far away.
“I wouldn’t say that,” he muttered, viciously tearing it up and coming around the edge of the desk to drop the pieces in the trash.
But, to his surprise, Dean saw the Alpha peek at Sam, something desperate in his eyes, before standing straight up and glaring at the sky like it offended him. He was taking deep breaths, and he finally squeezed shut his eyes and bared his fangs at the sky, his body trembling like a plucked string on a violin, his hands balled into fists at his sides.
Dean started to snicker at their dumbfounded expressions (compounded by their shaggy mountain-men looks) and dragged at Cas. “C’mon. Let’s let them get some sleep.”
Gabriel started swearing floridly, and that was Castiel's cue to walk away quickly. Whatever they were fighting about, it was probably best to walk away from it. They rarely fought. It was just something else to make him nervous.
He knew that Japanese counting about spiritual things tended to be a bit sketchy, but, what the fuck, there were way more than a hundred yōkai! He groaned as the police scanner announced there had been an explosion at an apartment complex and several people had been found dead and apparently partially eaten.
Hell broke loose as Dean threw the engine-oil drenched cloth at Buzz-cut’s face, hitting him square and startling all three alphas. They were obviously not used to omegas fighting back, which made Dean even angrier.
“Cas!” he shouted and rushed towards him. Cas’s blue eyes met his and a smile flashed upon his lips that was quickly replaced with a frown as he took in Dean’s appearance.
“Yes, very,” Cas agreed with a nod and took a sip of the cold beer. “Anything exciting happen while I was gone?” he asked, glancing around the table. He’d been with Dean for eight years now, and the other man had helped tremendously with getting him to come out of his shell, and even though he’d worked with the men sitting at the table with him for the last three years, he still found himself wanting to go back to the way he was before; more quiet and observing than talkative and extraverted. He felt most comfortable around Dean, knew the man wouldn’t judge him as he feared most would. He knew deep down, they didn’t either but he still had a rough time of it every now and then.
Sam took in a breath, but still faltered for words. There were numerous excuses and explanations running through his head, but all that came out was, “We, um, we broke up.” He felt the car react to Dean’s sudden braking, but the smooth ride returned within a few seconds.
“Hey, Dean,” he said, and the words didn’t come out as brittle as he thought they would as he opened his arms to hug his brother.
They’d reached a stalemate the night before as Dean had finally given in and promised he’d at least talk to someone, but he hadn’t stated when that would take place. Just that he would.
“You…you of all people don’t get to say that,” Dean stated, voice even as he pointed a finger at his husband. “I did,” and he hesitated with his words, hating the fact that he was once again confessing something rather intimate in front of his brother. “I did exactly as you asked, and now you’re agreeing with him?” he asked, incredulously, gesturing towards Sam. “What the hell, Cas?”
He gripped the liter bottle tightly and downed half of its contents, filling back up the space that was previously occupied with calories with none.
“You okay?” he whispered in his ear, and Dean nodded in response, forcing his lips to turn upwards in some semblance of a smile.
“Alright, I’ll let you have a pass now, but we’re not done talking about this yet,” Dean warned. “So, aside from that situation, how’s school?”
Master Chief Shurley was a smaller man with short, wavy brown hair. He was older than Cas by at least ten years, gray starting to become noticeable at his temples. On good days, he was laughing and joking along with the rest of the men, but on bad days, Cas knew from experience that he could be a real asshole though he kept that thought to himself. The man was his superior and though Cas got along well with the other men he served with, he preferred not to gossip or complain about the Master Chief, much to his friends’ chagrin.
She frowned but more people were starting to filter in and ask questions, forcing her worries temporarily to the background. Before she knew it, it was a little after one thirty, and the store had finally quieted down enough that she decided Dean needed to break for lunch.
“I’ve heard it's quite a hoot!” she laughed, and took the book from him, making sure to brush her fingers along his in the process.
All he wanted to do was see Dean and make sure he was okay, but he and Sam’s disagreement had forced him back into the ER waiting room. Sam had stalked outside after they’d been thrown out of Dean’s makeshift room, leaving him to attempt to collect his thoughts all the while a trashy day time talk show blared in one of the waiting room’s corners.
He knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that if he’d never have spoken those words, they wouldn’t be where they were at now.
Placing what was left in the fridge, he turned off the lights and went back upstairs. Dean was now curled on his side, covers pulled tightly around him, so Cas slid in behind him and wrapped an arm around his thin waist, pulling him as close as he could to his chest.
After the table quieted down, Cas spoke up. “So not much longer before you tie the knot, right?,” he asked, looking over at Gad. “Only two weeks left until you join the club?”
“Fine, that’s good to hear,” she replied nonchalantly, obviously convinced otherwise. “How much do you weigh?”
Cas wasn’t sure how many beers later it was before he realized he was drunk, buzzed-thirty having passed hours before. He had walked to the bar but was thankful for the offer for a ride home from Gad. They said their good-byes to the other men, and climbed into Gad’s black Silverado.
Sam took one step back, trying desperately to keep his temperamental side at bay, but as the tension welled up, the harder it was becoming.
“You’re not on death’s door just yet, but you have one foot already crossing the threshold and I’m here to make sure both don’t make it over.”
“Bye,” the darker haired man said with a grin, and Dean rolled his eyes but returned the gesture before opening the door and heading down their front steps.
sign went off. He immediately stood up and stretched his legs, inwardly thankful that he’d managed to snag an aisle seat.
“Sam, look – I promise, I really am fine, alright? Let me know what date and time you plan on being here, and I’ll make sure I’ll be at the airport waiting for you, okay?”
It wasn’t long before they pulled up in front of their house, and Dean reluctantly got out of the jeep and followed Cas inside.
Dean began setting up the main register, brow lowering when he heard someone knocking on the glass door. He looked up to find Jody standing there, looking slightly annoyed and balancing her weight on a cane. He quickly stopped what he was doing, and walked over to the door, unlocking it so she could come in.
Dean collapsed onto him afterwards, grimacing only as his skin made contact with the cooling come that Cas was still covered in.
“Poor thing. I remember when my Thomas, God rest his soul,” she said, raising her hand up to her heart, “was deployed in Vietnam. I had anxiety through the roof so I can imagine what he's going through.”
“You’re going to make me burn the eggs,” Dean replied, trying to seem unfazed and Cas couldn’t help but laugh. “Oh fine, I missed you too. Happy now?” Dean asked and shut the burner off before turning around to face him.
Cas stared at him for a moment, observant eyes looking him over before seeming like he was satisfied with Dean’s answer, though not entirely.
“That would be a yes, Mr. Handsy,” Dean quipped, and Cas chuckled in response. “You really must’ve missed me, acting like a horny teenager and all,” and Cas laughed even more.
Castiel’s heart pounded in his chest as he gently pulled Dean back up to his full height, hating himself to the core as bone pressed against his fingertips and a current of satisfaction ran through his veins. Dean glared at him for a moment, green eyes suddenly aware and searching his, waiting for whatever words he could dare to utter so he could strike, like a match against its box.
“Here you go, sweetheart,” she said, setting down the plate and mug of coffee. “If you need anything else, just let me know.”
Ever since they’d been together, Dean had always been heavier than him. Not by much, roughly fifteen to twenty pounds or so, he also being an inch and a half taller.
Cas sighed, watching with worried eyes as Dean got another three-fingered refill of whiskey and returned to the table.
“You’re not acting like yourself, and I’m worried. Is that so wrong?” Cas countered, blue eyes searching Dean’s greens.
He made his way out of the kitchen and past the living room, throwing on his hoodie as he went out the door. It was surprisingly chilly and he probably should’ve grabbed his jacket instead, but he was almost positive that he had read somewhere that the body burned more calories when it was cold, so he would be fine.
He could tell Dean had lost even more weight, and though he had seen it with his eyes, feeling it was something else altogether. Through the haze of exhaustion, he felt a pang of barely contained excitement course through his veins as he went upstairs and into the bedroom. He gently laid Dean down on the bed, making sure to pull the covers back before he did so. He figured Dean would be more comfortable without sleeping in his hoodie and jeans so he gingerly lifted up his shirt and undid his belt (which he noticed was now on the tightest loop). He slid the jeans down, revealing hip bones that were peaking up through black batman boxer briefs and pale, slender legs. He felt his dick twitch with interest at the sight, and bit his bottom lip.
Donna lifted the lid a bit and inhaled the scent of the contents, her grin widening. “That smells delicious! Although, you shouldn’t have, but thank you, Castiel,” she said, her megawatt smile still firmly in place. She looked at Dean and winked, then chuckled when she saw the beer in his hand. “Jody’s gonna be happy to see you,” she joked, elbowing him in the ribs before leading them away from the foyer and into the living room.
Before you begin this chap, please accept my apologies for being gone for an entire year. Covid kind of a put a dent in my life outside of work, but I've finally managed to get back to a normal schedule. The first part of this chapter has been sitting on my laptop since last March, the rest of the chapter has been written in bits and pieces since then. So, if it seems a bit fractured or disjointed, please don't hesitate to let me know. Lastly, I can't thank you all enough for every single kudo or comment left. I truly, truly appreciate your feedback and you taking the time to read this story.
But as he made his sixth trip from the couch to the kitchen table, a thought crept into the edges of his mind.
Business did indeed start to pick up, and before Dean knew it, it was already noon. The shop finally quieted down a bit, and he was thankful that he had told Claire and Jack to both go on lunch fifteen minutes previous, leaving him to his own devices for a bit. He refilled the coffee and even grabbed himself a cup. The warm liquid eased down his throat and he gulped it down, not realizing how thirsty he actually was. He poured himself a refill, before heading back to the stock room to grab a few boxes of comics for Jack and Claire to put out when they got back. While he was back there, he heard the bells ring and called out, “Be out in a minute!”
“Peach cobbler,” the blue eyed man replied with a smile as he hung his coat on the rack by the door.
He’d never been caught up with how he’d looked before, had never really given it much thought. Food had always given him a sense of enjoyment, but that was long gone. Now all it did was make him feel lousy because he was always worried that he was eating too much.
Sam thought back, desperately trying to recall anything in their conversations from that time period, but the more he thought about it, the more he realized that they really hadn’t communicated all that much. He was in the full swing of his relationship with Jess then and school was as hectic as ever. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that he and Dean had barely even spoken then.
“I can finally take this hideous thing off,” he heard her speak under her breath, and he couldn’t help but laugh lightly at that. It eased some of the tension he was feeling, but not by much. He watched as she untied the apron, and tossed it aside. “Alright folks, before we dig into this food, Donna and I would just like to thank you all for coming, and especially for all the hard work you three have put in in the last few months. We can’t tell you enough how much we both appreciate it.”
The plastic bags crinkled as he took the meager contents out and loaded them into the fridge (with the exception of the remaining bananas)  –  two small bags of salad mix (60 calories each), the pint of strawberries, two bags of baby carrots (170 calories each), celery (50 calories), three yellow apples (80 calories each), and a couple of green peppers (33 calories each).
“Hey stranger, forgot my keys,” she said, greeting him with a smile and pulling him into a hug despite his hesitance. He returned the gesture though, humoring the shorter woman.
“So, I’m dying to know, how did you two kids meet? Because I’ve been trying to figure out for the longest time, if Claire can actually be —“
“Shut up, Sam!” Dean interjected, turning to face his brother. He could feel his own anger bubbling to the surface, but Castiel’s gentle squeeze on his waist grounded him momentarily.
“Just…give me a minute!” Dean returned, sounding frustrated. He’d been holed up in the bathroom for almost thirty minutes and Cas was simultaneously worried and just a few more minutes shy of being irritated.
“Oh, really. Why don’t you name a few then?” the darker-haired man challenged playfully with a raised brow and a smirk on his lips.
“Yeah, you’re only like what, teenage Sasquatch height?” Dean asked, bursting into a fit of laughter when Sam flashed him what Dean like to call his ‘bitch face’. “Oh, man, I sure missed seeing that,” Dean admitted, stopping at a door at the end of the hallway. He opened it and flipped the light on, backing away so Sam could go in first.
.” He’d whispered the last part into his husband’s ear, and grinned when Dean’s face turned the cutest mix of red and pink.
Panic began to spread over him like wildfire, wave after wave of fear sending tremors through his small frame, causing the keys to jingle faintly.
Dean cut him off, trying his best not be annoyed but he was fairly positive the emotion was starting to bleed onto his face. “Do you have your membership card? Pretty sure you’ve earned a free book.”
He returned to his station, but his mind was a million miles away. He knew this day would come, but he wasn’t expecting it to happen so soon. He was going to miss Dean’s birthday, their anniversary…
Sam looked around, not missing how the house was just as clean, if not more so, than the Impala. Everything seemed to have its place, though it was decorated sparsely, just a few pictures hanging on the walls here and there. “You comin’?” Dean called out from the top of the steps, and Sam rolled his eyes. “Might wanna watch your head, Sammy, might hit it on the ceiling or something,” Dean jabbed with his words, chuckling as Sam huffed at him.
“What happened, Dean? Huh?” Sam asked, closing the distance between them and getting right in his brother’s face. His years of schooling combined with his natural ability to not leave someone alone until they told him the truth was out in full force. “Tell me!” he shouted, and something in Dean’s expression gave, if only for a second. Sam leaned in impossibly close, eyes agleam with anger. “Tell me, Dean!”
“Take it easy, Mrs. Baker,” he said, and Jody watched his shoulders deflate in relief as she led Mrs. Baker to the beverage stand.
He’d experienced head rushes more times than he could count, but this – this was something altogether different.
Utter shock lit up Dean’s eyes before he quickly shook his head and replied, “What? No, of course he doesn’t! Why would you even ask that?”
“You sure? If you’re not feeling well, we can just skip the party tonight,” the darker haired man replied with a reassuring smile.
“Dean, what the hell is going on? Did he ask you to do this?” Sam could feel his anger building once more.
Without a word, he rushed out of the small diner and let his clammy limbs carry him a few blocks away to an alley where he quickly shoved his fingers down his throat as soon as he got the chance.
“You make it so hard to leave when you do stuff like that, you know that, right?” Dean asked, a hint of a blush on his cheeks.
Dean took in a deep breath before he got up, mentally trying to prepare himself for what was to come.
The resounding gasp of air that left Dean’s lungs sent Castiel into a panic. He was immediately on his knees beside Dean, one hand settling atop Dean’s ribcage, the other sliding beneath his neck. His glasses had managed to fall off and the image of his husband searching blindly for him scared him more than he’d ever admit.
“Oh, same old, same old. Claire just texted me to let me know that she won’t be able to close tonight.”
. It had been his first assignment, one he’d taken on with gusto. He’d done so well, in fact, that it had landed him the assignment in Kansas where he’d met Dean.
“And that’s because it’s not,” Dean confirmed in a matter of fact tone, sliding the books into their respective slots. “The only piece of advice I can really give you is, don’t just slam your tongue down whoever’s throat you’ll be playing Seven Minutes in Heaven with, okay? Cause that will only turn out one way, and that’s badly.”
The smell wafting in from the kitchen was heavenly, and he felt tears spring to his eyes as he stood in place, watching Dean as he sung along to Bob Seger’s
“Dean,” and her voice softened as she continued. “There’s no shame in admitting that you’re hurting. Anorexia is dangerous, and most often times in males, deadly. I’m not trying to scare you, but that’s the truth. This may be your first hospital visit, but if you keep going down the path that you are, it most certainly won’t be your last.”
Remnants of the dream lingered in the back of his thoughts as he waited, albeit a bit impatiently, to get up. The flight hadn’t been long, but a few screaming children and the confined space had frayed his nerves.
Dean cleared his throat and glanced up at her, forcing the best charming smile that he could onto his lips. “Coffee, please,” he answered.
“I’m great!,” he answered truthfully. “I’m going to my first high school party tonight, so I came in early so I could go.”
Thankfully, he was engrossed in the pages of a book, using one hand to hold down the page he was reading while the other had a fork in it.
He made quick work of slamming the bedroom door behind them, heart thumping in his chest as he tossed Dean onto the bed, fingers ready and willing to strip the man of any and all clothes on him. The noise that Dean made, however, when his body hit the bed stopped Castiel in his tracks.
Cas glanced down at the conveniently located tag that was by the zipper and paused. “Dean, these aren’t your pants. They’re a pair of my old dress ones from years ago.”
Sam glanced over at him, worry stirring his chest as he saw a bony wrist peak out of the long-sleeved flannel that had been covering the appendage up until then. The watch that decorated it slipped down and out of sight, back underneath the cotton that had been concealing it.
She glanced at him and caught the tail end of another shrug. “Just enjoying the weather, I guess,” he mumbled and looked like a teenager getting scolded by their mother.
He stopped by the dresser once more and grabbed a pair of Deadpool socks and sat down on the bed and quickly pulled them on. He went back into the bathroom, going through his usual routine of brushing his teeth and combing his hair. It had thinned a bit in recent months, but he did his best to ignore that fact and finished by adding a touch of gel to it. Once he was satisfied with the results, he went downstairs and over to the couch, sitting down long enough to slip his shoes on and slide his phone into his pocket, then he was off to the kitchen.
Dean sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose with his index finger and thumb. “I’m fine, Sammy. It’s just…”
Dean couldn’t help but let a grin pull up the corners of his lips. “You’re adorable,” he said and leaned over, planting a light kiss on Cas’s lips. His hardened expression eased at that into a more neutral one, a hand slipping to the small of Dean’s back as he pulled away.
“Aw, thank you, Castiel,” she gushed, and Cas didn’t miss Dean rolling his eyes behind her back. “I was worried they wouldn’t have the dress ready because I had to get it taken in because I lost so much weight. I never knew planning a wedding could be so stressful! At least you two didn’t have to worry about having to fit into a dress,” she joked, hand still lingering on Cas’s arm, much to Dean’s dismay.
“Figured we could both relax a little before…you know,” Cas explained, and Dean nodded in understanding.
It took a moment to register, as he made his way up the few stairs to the house, that there was a vehicle that he didn’t recognize parked in the driveway. He paused for a moment, keys dangling from his fingertips and stared at it.
“I’m not exactly looking forward to the opposite of it though either,” Cas replied as he pulled out of the driveway and out onto the street. “The average temperature there during the summer is over a hundred degrees.”
“Jack,” Dean stated with a tone of finality as he cut him off, “I know you mean well. Really, I do. But just stop, okay? There’s nothing wrong with me, I don’t have an eating disorder, and we should really get to work, alright? Case closed, let’s go.” He took a deep breath and steeled himself for another attempt at standing. This time, he stayed upright. “You coming?” he asked after taking a few steps without hearing any movement from behind.
Cas glanced at his watch, seeing that he still had a couple of hours before Dean would be back. “Yeah, sure. I’ll be there in thirty.”
“You’re in the ER at Memorial Hospital. You fainted and that’s why you’re not going anywhere until that bag is empty,” she explained.
“Thanks,” he mumbled, gaze falling on a loose hem at the edge of his t-shirt as Ellen exited the small room.
“No,” Dean interjected firmly. “You’re not quitting school, alright? Everything’s going to be alright.”
With the air knocked clear out of his lungs and his gaze scared and unsteady, he looked like a soldier that was about to say his final goodbye.
“No, because as I just said, it’s none of our business. Besides, Anna lost a bunch of weight like that before we got married. Maybe he’s just upset that Cas is being deployed.”
They’d argued nonstop for the past two weeks. It was nothing but back and forth, back and forth until Dean had finally given in and agreed to make an appointment, but he’d still given Cas the cold shoulder for the past two days, including the car ride there.
“I’m sorry, but what?” he asked, sounding ever defiant and incredulous. “I can see just fine, thanks. Just got a head rush is all.”
A hint of water glossed Sam’s eyes, and he immediately felt ridiculous. His plan was to come here to see his brother, not ball his eyes out within minutes of seeing him again because he’d been cheated on. He swallowed thickly and cleared his throat. “I’ve been dealing with it, Dean.”
“Sounds like I need to rectify that,” Cas stated huskily, and started to lift Dean’s shirt up. He watched Dean visibly tense, but he didn’t care. He leaned down and teased one of Dean’s nipples with his tongue, twirling it round and round as he undid the loose jeans. His dick got even harder when he saw just how loose they really were, and he was pretty sure luck was the only thing keeping them up before he had gotten to them.
“I thought that while the ending was sad, it was more true to life than if he had actually gotten a happy ending. Stories wrapped up in neat little bows are nice and practical from a financial standpoint, but who really gets that? No one leads a perfect life,” Dean countered and downed the rest of his glass. Cas tried his hardest not to stare at him, but it wasn’t easy when he spoke so passionately on a subject, especially when it came to Dean’s favorites — movies and books.
Bobby was half-asleep at the table, a first-aid kit out. It looked like he had been trying to read a book, but sleepiness had gotten the better of him, and his hand had fallen into his lap, the book spread out open in his palm. He had roused some when the door had creaked and popped open (an old fashioned alarm) and bleary eyes glared out at Dean from under the cap. “Boy, you ok?”
He chewed some more and took another bite with another toe-curling moan. “It’s like my two favorite things in one dish! Why did I not know about this? Holy shit, this is delicious!”
It wasn’t her fault Castiel didn’t want to be Pack-leader, as was his place as the only Pureblood Alpha of the head family. She blamed his stubbornness on Charles's genetics.
Nodding, Castiel pulled out his phone and turned it on. It buzzed lightly, indicating there was a message, and when he looked, there was a missed call from Gabriel.
His mother’s bright voice settled into her stern mom voice as she said, “You will be there, and you will support your brother. He’s nearly 40. It’s more than time for him to settle down.”
The man chuckled and it was like hearing birds in the early morning. “Nothing bad. She will be rehabilitated. She is, after all, only human.”
To Dean’s chagrin, the bird bowed politely to Bobby, who was frowning fiercely at the bird like he was afraid it was going to take a shit on his desk. It then hopped up and down, those blue eyes glowing even in the overhead light.
The moment she left, a large burly man with a huge dark beard sat down at the table next to them and asked with only a small accent, “Are you staying in Barsuki?”
Missouri petted the young man’s head with her plump fingers. “Honey, Dean is more stubborn than a stable full of donkeys, and he loves you more than anything. I don’t think there’s anything that would stop him from staying with you.”
Considering Bobby had sent a runner for them to come explain themselves the very same day as the report had landed on his desk, and considering that the Winchesters still hadn’t deigned to grace his office like quicksilver, the day was pissing Bobby off.
Dean shook the sword, and felt the fox tail inside his body vibrate with similar anger. It was white-hot and burned like napalm, and he
“He wasn’t jumping shit,” Dean grumbled under his breath, probably hoping the Beta’s hearing was not as good as it actually was. Joshua watched as Dean slid a half of his sandwich onto his little brother’s plate without a thought, the younger man beaming happily at his older brother. Their clothes indicated that they were not very well off, but getting by, and Sam, in particular, had a serious and studious air around him that boded well for his academic success.
him. He was having problems regulating himself: his fingers changing to claws, his teeth elongating without his knowing, his eyes—undoubtedly—burning a terrifying red.
The soft scent sunk into his senses, and Dean was carried away by the feelings of love and desire that swept through the bond. “Cas, I—”
Cas pulled back enough to smile up at Dean, who leaned in and kissed him gently. “I suppose we ought to get a move on,” he said after a moment of blissing out on Cas’s soft lips. “You remember what I told you to get, right? Like the bare essentials.”
Clearing his throat self-consciously, Dean waves a hand at the utilitarian place and says, “Uh, home sweet home.”
He watched Dean shuffle out with concern, yelling, “I made some coffee, so pack some in a thermos before you head out!”
attempted to start up again, it was interrupted by Gabriel’s sudden appearance, causing a flurry of awkward leaping up and bowing to the honorable kitsune by the Asian practitioners.
: Second-level and pureblood Betas can scent others better than a third-level anything, but it’s still about half the sniffer of any other designation second-level or above. Alphas and omegas have good sniffers because they need it to sense each other, for hunting, and for danger. That’s the reason why Beta-2s have the enhanced nose that’s just not as sensitive. The more diluted the bloodline, the weaker overall the genetics for this.
Dean chuckled, gripping his hand tightly for a moment. “That would be easier if you ate more often.”
“I didn't know how bad it had gotten, I swear!” Dean pleaded, tilting his head slightly to offer his neck.
“Y’know? Can’t see the forest for the trees?” He paused, one arm crossed behind his head as his other gripped his wrist and tugged. A small pop made Dean sigh with relief and he dropped his arms and rolled his head to more clicks and pops.
“I can see it’s a coat, smart ass,” he snapped, “but no one told me I was going to have to wear like a bear or something to this shindig!”
A tall, dark-skinned woman with striking golden eyes and a small man with ice-blue eyes and way too much blond hair stepped into the kitchen, both dressed impeccably in black beautician outfits that tied at their waists.
He pushed himself up to his feet, only swaying a bit, and looked around the room. “Cas! Where’s Cas?”
He was cursing, while trying to hold up his towel and get the drawer on the dresser open. It was an old, refurbished piece, like all of Bobby’s furniture, and it tended to get stuck.
Neither Alpha paid much attention to the “Oh, shit! BOBBY!!” nor “Oh, my God!! CAS, STOP!!” as they were in the midst of a growling, protective snarl-off at the front door.
(百鬼夜行 "Night Parade of One Hundred Demons"): [EVENT] The Night Parade is literally a parade when ALL the demons emerge and parade through town. Humans who are caught in their path are dealt with, and in Japan, people are supposed to hide until it is over. The leader of the parade is Nurarihyon.
his mind with pornography that he had been able to forget until now. The filthy poses of those film omegas haunted him, their blank anonymous faces replaced by Dean’s face. Presenting. Spreading himself. Begging for Castiel’s knot. Dean’s mouth on his, that beautiful man belonging to Castiel, and only Castiel.
be the last chapter with like... long descriptions of how the "world" works. You're pretty much home free from it. If you want to keep up with my progress (or read any drabbles I'm writing because my poetry class is dullsville)
Dean eyed it and also tried to touch it before Cas could stop him, swearing as he pulled back a finger with what looked like a second-degree burn. “Yeah. That’s not good,” he muttered.
But that kitsune… she wasn’t sure what to make of him, although she knew he was helping Dean Winchester somehow. Those who had confronted Dean themselves never returned, and she wasn’t sure how that one puny human was killing off her brethren, her children, so easily. But she suspected the kitsune was somehow involved.
Thankfully, Dean and Bobby were both handy sorts, and Bobby already had an idea of what needed to be done. To Dean, it looked sort of like a taller, but skinnier bird house with mini-doors on it and a sloping, over-sized roof. Bobby had smacked him upside the head for joking about it, and Dean ended up sulking as he finished off the main altar, while Bobby added some decorative red-orange paint to the house.
They spent Thanksgiving with Missouri, who had made an impressive spread, including a delicious sweet potato pie and banana pudding. Or Dean assumed they were delicious. He couldn’t taste anything, another annoying side-effect.
According to yokai.com: …[in] Buddhist lore, tengu are born when a person dies who is not wicked enough to go to Hell, but is too angry, vain, proud, or heretical to go to Heaven. The tengu is a personification of those excessive vices, magnified and empowered in a new, demonic form.
“Dean, we can take those home.” Cas was genuinely amused at his new-found love of pirozhki. “We can also come back later for some more.”
Although they had had… whatever that was? A fight? Cas had still been sitting quietly on Dean’s bed when he went to sleep. Apologies were not given. Excuses were not made. Dean had simply gone to bed with Cas sitting like a stuffed bear in the corner of his bed by his feet.
The limo soon crawled to a stop and the windows on the right-hand side immediately began to pop with flashes, bringing to harsh reality for Dean what he was walking into. Paparazzi. They
“I am nowhere near late,” he replied, slapping the big bear of an Alpha on the shoulder. “How’s tricks?”
(鬼女 "demon woman"): [CREATURE] These are human women who have been irrevocably twisted by hatred, jealousy, a curse, or a wicked crime that corrupted their souls and twisted their bodies into monstrous forms.
The man shook his extended hand and said, “Come on, now. I’m Gabriel. You can call me Gabe. My twin, Luci, doesn’t have time right now to come meet you, so I thought I’d do the honors.”
Castiel bent over and picked up an errant stone, tossing it with a flick of his wrist into the pond so it skidded across the calm surface and left tiny shockwaves in its wake.
Dean started laughing, hoping the slight hysterical edge would be ignored. Cas took his cue from him and also lightly laughed. Dean replied more sharply than he intended, “Why would we be here, on the run, if he were an angel?”
The murmuring got louder, and Akira shushed them by just putting out her hands and making a settling motion with them. “Okay, alright. That means we basically have two days to at least
The brothers, knowing what Cas was, exchanged looks. Nikolai continued to thrash, until Dean said, “Cas, knock him out.”
No, that was the issue with ‘Heat’: the chemically manipulated, higher concentration of pheromones were addictive and immediately forced the alpha into a false rut. The feeling was a wild and instant high that supposedly felt like the brink of an orgasm

, for fuck’s sake), with his dark-blue eyes and mussed hair that looked like he had recently just fucked someone in the pews instead of coming from conducting mid-day mass.
“It’s a spider wrapping,” Dean whispered into Cas’s ear, “They’re going to take it back and eat it.”
He squawked like a five-year old girl, and leaped out of bed, swearing. He heard the distinct sound of Cas’s purring laughter, and he turned on him, poking him in the fluffy feathered chest, and growled, “Oh, it’s on, Feathers.”
He strolled over to the cabinets and unlocked a smaller one with another cabinet lockbox inside, pulling out a small white bottle and tossing it to Dean. Dean caught it with one hand and frowned.
Three sets of eyes on him didn’t make Gabriel budge. He stood, turned around in a circle a few times, and then curled into a ball on the edge of the desk. They heard him say, “Who knows? As you know, the Divine has plans for us all and I’m not privy to all of them.”
“And you guys didn’t think this was a good time to seek out help? Like, find someone outside the village?” Dean swiftly picked the desk’s lock and grinned at his success.
When Bobby and Sammy finally came downstairs, bleary eyed and tired, he ignored them and their complaints about his running about. Bobby even made a snide remark how he was impressed Dean hadn’t died running around like a maniac.
Here, in this uncomfortably clean and open human habitation, even her short horns and long claws were not as out of place compared to the pure filth of her: the fouled and ragged kimono she had worn for centuries; the disheveled and blackened straw sandals on her muddy, clawed feet; her hair haggard and streaked with white from her anger and madness.
The door banged open, and the guy with dirty-blond hair and ridiculous goatee walked into the room, his baby-blue flannel pajamas stuffed ingloriously into his wellingtons, a brown fur cap pulled roughly over his head. “You,” he said, catching sight of Dean, his Russian accent more obvious than before in his sleepy agitation. “It is
“What the fuck ever,” Dean muttered under his breath, tugging his clothing off angrily. “Fuck this shit anyway.”
Her glare narrowed a touch more. “Lynn. You’d know that if you’ve known my brother long enough to house sit.”
Cas had just sat down when Dean returned with a plate of fresh pancakes and bacon. Cas knew that he’s already put a thin layer of butter between the pancakes and that the lavender honey he preferred to use is already warmed to pour over the stack. Suspiciously, he poured the honey over his pancakes and eyed Dean from across the table. “What’s the occasion,” he asked as he put a carefully carved bite into his mouth. The pancakes melted on his tongue, the soft flavor of the honey adding a lovely tang to Dean’s cooking.
For those who don't know, "pomme" means "apple." Dean is thinking of "pomme de terre" which is a "potato."
Dean frowned and tested his toes and fingers–his ankle giving a small throb that would likely finish healing in a couple of days–while his mind whirled wildly around all of yesterday’s happenings and failed to grip them.
Dean shifted again nervously, looking unsure of what Gabriel meant. Castiel coughed into the awkward silence and murmured, “Can’t you give us anything?”
It wasn’t horrible or as deeply painful as thinking about leaving the Church had been in his youth, or even while in college.
Considering he’s currently standing with his back pressed hard against his tiny desk and trying to stare his claws back into fingers, it was not an unfair assessment.
: [CREATURE/FIGURE] Technically, there are very few "daitengu" (great tengu), and King Sōjōbō is one of them. He rules a specific territory and the smaller/younger tengu around him bend to his will. He's familiar if you watch anime or read manga. He's one of the most powerful tengu, so he's mostly in human form.
With iron resolve to keep it together no matter what, Castiel started walking the ten feet to the garage just as a lot of yelling broke out.
Without thinking on it too much, he marched downstairs as was demanded of him, yawning, stretching, and scratching his head. He had not even paused to change out of his pajamas, which were just soft flannel pants and an old t-shirt. He stopped short on the fourth step down when he realized there were like thirty people in the office and spilling out into the hall and kitchen.
Dean yelped and dropped the bead in disgust, stepping away from it. The bead seemed to grow tiny spider legs and an eyeball, and, as it crawled closer to him, the drilled center apparently worked as a mouth.
He pushed through a shoulder-high pile of magical boxes he needed to pack and move to the new storage area Bobby had gotten set up off-site, and was about to sort through the pile of miscellaneous crap that was literally a small mountain of 'things humans should never get ahold of,' when his foot snagged on the curved talon of a clawed walking stick. He tried to catch himself, but gravity was being uncooperative today and made him his bitch: he had managed to avoid the mountain of 'very bad things,' only to fall sideways into a set of sealed glass cases. He felt his elbow smash into one, cutting into his arm, and, when he hit the ground, the case followed, its corner bouncing off his head, while he heard deafening crack somewhere to his left. He grunted in pain, trying to cover his ears, when he heard a definite, “I’m free!”
Groaning, Castiel scowled up at Gabriel, knowing he was the slightly easier-going one. “It’s none of your business,” he gritted out.
Offended, Dean snagged Sam — who yelped — off his seat, putting him in a half-hearted headlock. “This squirt ain’t taller than me. There’s
The Baku was standing there with some satisfaction, her claws bright red with blood, and she said, “So that’s where the tengu went.”
… it affects both of us. Because I was bound to the protections on the scroll and you freed the Baku. So, while the Baku may take your life energy and your luck, my spirit and energy will be trying to keep you alive because, without you, we cannot stop her.
Of course, there was Gabriel who was just hanging about with no real purpose. He had become addicted to caramel corn and lately he had just been loitering with Ichiren-Bozu, chowing down on the stuff and marathoning TV shows he had missed in the last decade or so. He had thoroughly enjoyed the Lord of the Rings movies and The Hobbit, and of course he fell in love with the Star Trek reboot. Or maybe it was just Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Dean wasn’t sure.
They cleaned up, something that was made easier when they realized Cas’s child-sized bird body was actually stronger than the two of them combined, as he easily hefted one of the pines they were taking home all by himself, something that made Bobby just mutter, “Friggin’ tengu.”
He leaned in so Castiel was eye to eye with him. “They’ll strip you down to just mindless feathers again. You must
Dean stops just inside the door, colors violently to tips of his ears, and says, “How did you know?”
: So I just found out that Deacons cannot say mass, but it's my AU so I'm sticking with transitional ones can. Layman ones cannot. That's what I thought when I was originally writing this. Oops. Well, there will be more Catholic "rule" breaking as we go on, although I will try my hardest to be (HA HA) faithful. Castiel will not be taking confession because Deacons cannot, which means a few things... but yeah. RULE BREAKING: Transitional deacons can say mass! Look at me rebel!
The blond hummed appreciatively at Dean’s scent and pressed a small kiss into his pulse point, winking up at him. “I think I could make do, but I’m sure my fellows would kill me.”
“Well, that’s true.” Dean wanted to whine about the showers and baths. It was cold and he liked getting warm with a long, super-hot shower with great water pressure. The hot water Cas heated in the water heater lasted maybe twenty minutes, tops. He knew he was being whiny, but…
Cas sat stock still, unsure he just heard Dean recite a poem. Dean colored and ran his fingers through Cas’s riot of hair, muttering, “It reminded me of your bed burrito...that’s all.”
The fact there was little mechanically wrong and most of it was cosmetic made her a dream job for Dean. He always wanted to fix a car by himself, without Bobby or his Dad hovering over his shoulder. The fact Joshua had already given up on the vehicle made it easy to relax and just throw himself into the job without worrying about ruining it.
Twenty minutes later, after Dean had messaged Sam the stunning photos from the penthouse’s view of the Arch, he had finally just helped himself to a sandwich. He was standing in front of the open door getting some more orange juice from the fridge, when the front door burst open with someone speaking nearly too quickly to be human and with way too much enthusiasm.
They didn’t speak as they parked across the way, easily breaking into the building, which was ominously quiet. They crossed the lobby nervously, and piled into the elevator. Gabe futzed with the mechanical lock that allowed the elevator to enter the off-limits 11
If possible, the bead shrugged and hopped onto Cas’s offered wing. It disappeared with a twist of Castiel’s wing, taking the short staff with it.
The voice shocked Dean and stopped Cas for a brief moment before he turned and growled at the voice. Dean’s Omega whined softly at the interruption, and Cas turned back to nuzzle him comfortingly, his protective rumblings rolling through them both.
Dean suddenly gripped Cas’s wrists and, with all seriousness, gruffly said,  “Cas, I love pie, but I tell you what, I wouldn't give you up for all he pie in the world. Same goes for girls. Sure I like them, but they’re not you.” He pulled him close and kissed him with all the love and desire had had within, leaving Cas gasping. “Now, are you going to finish what you started, or are you just going to tease me,” he grumbled against his lips, slotting their legs together and rutting against him.
Grimm, I sure as hell wouldn’t have been caught this easily. My dad sure as hell wouldn’t have been caught this easily.”
He stood and headed to the door, smiling when he heard from behind him a mumbled, “I’d make you wash the sheets!”
His thought process was interrupted by another wiggly-finger treatment along his sides, and his Alpha—already thoroughly pissed off and sulking over leaving behind his Omega—surged up inside him and caused Castiel to snap viciously at Gabriel, fangs and all.
desires running through his head!), watching Dean and Gabriel practice, and making Dean food occasionally.
Dean sat up, rubbing his eyes, and the raven scooted back, nearer to Bobby. Ah so the tengu has realized...
Without realizing it, slick was starting to pour out of Dean at the sight of his gorgeous mate and who was
Bobby said in his gruff old man voice, “It’s cursed. Whoever frees the Baku either has to reseal or kill the damned thing or they’ll die in one hundred and eight days.”
He threw himself petulantly onto a kitchen chair, taking care to bring his coffee with him, and said, “Well, and Cas told me some story about the Baku used to be a divine beast or something.”
omega he had ever met, and he had met quite a few in his life. He turned back to walk into the church to think and pray. He had a lot to ask forgiveness for today.
Dean heaved a new sigh and threw himself backwards onto the couch. Reluctantly, he flipped the phone open and turned it on. The phone was built for holding a long charge between power ups, and not to be fancy. He pressed the speed dial, and tried to hold onto his courage as the phone rang.
Dean seemed much more practically minded, although thinking that a pureblooded Alpha like Castiel couldn’t pin him down and make him submit was rather naive. It was in an omega’s nature to bend before a powerful alpha, and Joshua suspected Castiel was probably incredibly powerful, even for a pureblood. Still, the fact the lad still managed to stand in front of Castiel’s display—when most omegas would have immediately presented—was fascinating.
The red oni’s head flew off its shoulders with a juicy bounce, its arm falling off to the side, while its bulky body fell in slo-mo to the ground.
). The fun thing about this sect is that is so representative of Japan in that Enlightenment is sought through communion with the kami (神), which is the biggest aspect of
Michael smiled broadly and moved into his space, slipping his arms around Dean’s waist, slotting their legs together, and grinding his junk against Dean’s. Dean swallowed his disgust, and, while he was doing that, missed the cue where Michael decided to dip in and kiss him.
"Dean,” he breathed, “You smell like the original sin, the scent of the tart forbidden fruit that would explode on Adam's tongue and drive him insane. Your scent brings to mind the road to hell, paved with good intentions and the skulls of lost priests. You smell like everything I want to surrender myself to, all of myself! And now, having had a taste, taking the fatal bite and resting in God's wrath seems worth it for more."
She grinned at him, all serrated teeth and blank, black eyes. “You see yourself a hero? There are no heroes here amongst the filthy meat beasts. Might as well proclaim justice among the pigs you eat, stupid human!” She laughed. “Might as well think of a cow defending its brethren from the butchers!”
He chuckled. “He’s a good fellow, when he’s not bringing about the Night Parade. But he’s really hard to pick out of a crowd since he looks human.”
Benny groaned and dropped his head into his palms. “This is ridiculous. We must report this to the Cete.”
Cas’s wings wrapped around him. The cabin had cooled in the time they were away, and Dean was grateful for the warm feathers. The fragrance of wing oil comforted him, and he groaned. “Cas, you’re turning me in to a girl. I would never whine like that to Sam or Bobby.”
of the wheeled bastards. As a result, he’d almost been set on fire more than a few times, and he was absolutely
When she finished her little prayer, she scowled over at Dean and said, “Boy, the Good Lord didn’t make you like that to desert you in your time of need. You need to have faith. Thing’s’ll turn out. You’ll see.” She smiled secretly as she walked past him, smacking him on the arm. “You might even be surprised. Now, c’mon. Let’s pack you and Sam somethin’ to take home for tomorrow. One less worry on your shoulders.”
Dean backed off even more, unsure. He chanced a look to his right and Akira was standing there chanting and working mudras with her hands, but not alone. Another twelve onmyōji stood around the rooftop, surrounding them, and aiming their spellwork at the Baku.
Cas hopped off his shoulder onto the table, within breathing space of the cup. He hopped around it a tad and looked up at Dean expectantly.
Thursday afternoon, he wearily went to fetch Sam from school to walk him to the church, knowing the stench of his heat was still clinging to him a bit more strongly than it should have. He wanted to stay home, but Sam had been on his own all weekend, and Dean felt guilty. He had missed his li’l bro’s entrance into the church-going world, and he was damned if he was going to be stuck in bed while Sam walked to and from the church.
Dean’s head whipped around to glare at him, something unfathomable on his face, and he snapped, “How the hell should I know?”
When Dean came to, the world was still black. He figured that was more because he was planted in Bobby’s couch and it was nighttime than any head injuries.
But even as Dean set the drinks carefully onto the table, he realized the dark-haired alpha was watching him with hot eyes and a predatory gleam. He stifled his sigh, and, pulling a fancy red silk handkerchief from his pocket, he put down the tray and presented the tiny bottle of slick. “Alpha, I present to you the house special, O
She shook her hair, the thousands of tiny hooked ends jingling merrily, and it lifted up, so she could tie it with a sash, allowing her to bend and devour the boy’s innards, taking special care with the heart and liver. Satisfied for the moment, she again smiled down at the boy’s remains. He was a good start. In her gullet, she had picked at his soul, found out what ‘cosplay’ was, and discovered a newer, better outfit with which to lure young men.
What if he had made a mistake? What if Dean rejected him? How could he go back to Heaven? Would he then be alone for eternity?
Dean took in a deep breath and his stressed body relaxed because under the wet-dog smell was the smell of apple pie and linen: mate.
He made it to Gabriel’s grove before the pain of maintaining the transformation brought him down. He landed hard, forced into his true form, and curled on his knees, wrapping his wings around himself. If he sobbed into the soft earth, only the river heard him.
Cas flapped up and landed heavily on his shoulder, apparently being careful not to snag the fabric with his claws because Dean didn’t feel the little prick (Heh heh! The little prick!). “Because you are going to be the acolyte. I cannot do the motions. A human needs to do this part, and I can say the prayer.”
Castiel pulled open some cabinets, pulling out a few things, and gritting his beak when the shelves were just a smidgen out of reach. He was just about ready to start swearing when a hand reached over his head and handed him the tin of coffee.
Just as the big guy went down, tall and scrawny seemed to snap to the fact his friends were down for the count and he needed to pitch in. The dipshit snarled and ran at Dean, just a straight-up run, hands out to grab Dean, and Dean slipped a right hook between the guy’s outstretched arms and pegged him on the chin dead on.
Dean’s fingers wove into Cas’s hair as he tried not to come just from Cas’s deep throating him, praising Jesus for angels not having to breathe. The electric feeling of grace between them started to heat up, crackling like static, and Cas released his cock with a loud pop, pausing to make sure Dean was looking down to see why he stopped so he could smile wickedly, an expression that was positively obscene and debauched on the angel’s face before he licked a long stripe up to the tip and slide his tongue over the slit.
Castiel heard Sam, but it was as if he were speaking from far away. He heard himself say, “Yes, I’m fine thank you. And you?”
“So, you and Benny have got stake out duty. One of Gamboni’s men, Fergus McLeod, goes by Crowley? Yeah, he's suspected of putting the hit on the chinks, probably buncoed the poor bastards. The limey is good at making deals and stealing souls in his bargains.”
“I called them hakama,” Cas said, traces of indignation in his voice. “And I realize that your balance is off, so I have requested Ichiren-Bozu to help you at least make the right steps.”
Of course, because Dean was a charmer, many of the women in the park couldn’t help but want to mother the parentless omega and his little brother, so sometimes Dean even scored a lasagna or, if he was super lucky, pie.
Gabriel hummed and bit down viciously into his lollipop, shattering it. “But then he’ll know what he wants, bro. And that’s better than where he’s at right now.”

He had endured a haircut, a facial, a shave, an all-over body exfoliation, a shower (he managed that on his own, thank-you-
Uneasily, Dean swallowed hard and went back into his assigned room, closing the door behind him firmly. He sighed heavily and leaned against the door, trying to find his bearing.
Eve touched the kijo’s face fondly and pointed her towards the human’s hiding place. “Eat her,” she said mildly. “And then you may feast as you will. Only, I get the souls.”
The boys exchanged looks, and whatever Dean read in Sam’s eyes was undermined by the unearthly set of whines Sam’s belly gave off. Castiel smiled.
The neck had been snapped with one hand, the livid marks on the corpse’s neck nearly black. The victim’s left breast had been partly ripped off, the meat under it chewed through, while the rib cage had been snapped to reveal a hole where a heart should have been. She was missing a leg, which looked like it had been ripped from the socket. There were clean streaks through the blood splatter, as if it had been licked, and even a seasoned hunter like Dean felt ill looking at it.
After a week, with the imported help, the situation had improved somewhat. Pastor Jim had shown up with a few disciples, and they were using their skills as exorcists to at least banish the corpse-eating ghosts. That, at least, was a mild relief, but they couldn’t do much more. The yōkai just didn’t respond to their prayers or chants like they did their own homegrown ones.
Castiel quickly looked over at Sam, and wasn’t surprised to see doubt flash over his face before he controlled it, forcing his expression to become flat and unreadable. Definitely something going on, Castiel judged. He nodded to himself, and tapped the papers on his desk, putting them aside. He decided distancing himself from Dean was advisable, purely because he had never smelled anyone or anything so tempting. He gritted his teeth and girded his metaphorical loins.
Cas watched with concern but did nothing. Dean got more saliva going, coughed again and sighed. Rubbing his face, he said, “I'm sorry, Cas. I swear, it's not what it looked like.”
On Sunday, Castiel was feeling extremely nervous. He wasn’t certain why, but he was feeling it to his core.
The formal dinner party, primarily family, was going to take forever, and Castiel hoped he would be seated next to his sister, just so he could play catch up while his family fawned on the prospective mate.
What he hadn’t seen properly before was that there was indeed a peppermint stick. It stuck out the top of the whipped cream saucily, while a small Dove chocolate heart sat in the center of the whipped cream. But Dean hadn’t finished his “treat” and had broken a small candy cane so the hook formed a fine “U.”
Akira was, thankfully, task driven and, having scooped up the bead to consult with it, Sam was left with Bobby and the fake-napping Gabriel.
Benny and Abram shared a speaking look between brothers and Dean fought gritting his teeth. “So, you’re going to show me to the clinic?”
“Don’t worry about it.” He scanned the area a bit more and sighed again, ignoring the stench. “Okay, I’m thinking we can either follow the trail as it leads into the village, or we can go home.”
The Baku tried to mimic the clothing, thinking hard, and the illusion shimmered over her. She was still a bit weak from being constrained so long. She concentrated: the clothing shifted over her better, and then she decided to wait for the woman and her family to sink into sleep. After waiting almost eleven-hundred years, she could wait a few hours more.
Then there was a shift on the bed as someone sat on the edge and Castiel heard someone (Gabriel it seemed) say, “What’s up, little bro? God got you down? Jesus not take the wheel?”
“Dude, what is your deal? I mean, I’m a whore.” He made a ‘what the fuck’ motion with hands. “Your kind wants a fresh and virginal omega, don’t you?”
They answered correctly and concisely, and he asked, “Okay, then, why do you want to be altar boys?”
“Again?” Cas peered at the colony. It resembled a wasps’ nest in that the leaves and bones were set in the center, while the same sticky thread as the pixies used to carry off the gnome baby was obviously also used to create homes. Twigs and even skulls from various species decorated the colony, tiny pixie midges, still too young and minuscule to hunt, dangled from empty eye sockets and holes were noses once hung. It was the size of a small house and that meant for every pixie they saw, there were at least 100 they didn’t.
Dean nodded, as he had figured that was the problem, and he grimaced as the motion pulled lightly at his shoulder. He turned and dragged on a t-shirt—thankful the bite was healing somewhat and it wasn’t visible with his shirt on—and some boxers, and wandered back out into the kitchen.
Exhausted himself, Cas crouched next to him and gripped his shoulder. “We need to go to the end. Right now, all we can really see is trees.”
