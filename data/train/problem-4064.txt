He’s out of breath from running up the stairs by the time he reaches the door to the roof. It’s heavy, and for a moment he thinks it’s locked, but then he throws his hip into it and it groans open, and he looks across the roof and sees Dean.
cover as he fights for air; as his eyes slip closed. The hands around his neck, the knees pinning him down.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Charlie make a face at him — just a slight one, a widening of the eyes, but he stifles a laugh. It’s good to be reminded not to take his parents too seriously.
“You’re the — one who stepped — back, on the — hill —” Dean pants, and Castiel runs a hand through the short bristles of his hair and retorts, “Well that’s because I’m in the
it, sure — the M-word — but when they’re hanging out with Gina and Evan, or Thomas and Laura, it barely even feels like they don’t belong.
And there’s a sound from downstairs — a key in a lock, an opening door. Castiel tries to suppress his panic. If the neighbors heard something — if they find Jimmy like this —
“Same,” mumbles Dean — mumbles, because Castiel is kissing him, drawing their chests together, still slick under the slightly cooling spray. Their cocks, now limp, bump awkwardly with the nearness, but it doesn’t feel
Castiel stares at the photo for a moment after he takes it. Dean’s eyes look like there’s a light in them; like looking back at Cas might make him shine. Castiel has to remind himself to return Dean’s phone — to tear his eyes away.
Castiel blushes. But when Dean finishes stripping off the tape, when he gets to his feet and pads over to the bed shirtless, bare-footed on the linoleum floor, he stops there and pauses, taking in the way Castiel’s looking up at him with an unreadable face.
Castiel turns it over in his head. “I need to check something,” he says eventually. “My grace, it’s — not as strong as it used to be. It may be I’ve been basing my search radius off of flawed assumptions.”
When Dean finally straightens, he leans close again, propping one arm on the metal next to Castiel’s head, near enough for his voice to brush physically over Castiel’s skin. “Trust me, sweetheart,” he says, eyes still sparking with laughter, in a register so deep that it
It’s Cas’s first date in — maybe ever. Dean remembers getting him ready for that thing in Idaho, with Nora, but that fell through. He’s not sure if any of the other shit counts.
Castiel can’t look away. There’s Dean, in excruciating slow-motion high-definition, his head whipping back as he hits the rails. There he is lying in the dirt, through a gap under an EMT’s arm — you can see his eyes are open, lips are moving. There he is being loaded into an ambulance, invisible in a cervical collar, strapped to a backboard.
His voice comes out cold. It seems to catch Dean around the waist, startle him out of his sway, or into a new one; he says, “What?”
Then Dean clears his throat. His cheeks are flushing rapidly red. “Sam. Me and Cas are gonna, uh — go into town for a bit. Might not be back until late.”
And John Winchester is moving — throwing his door open, not bothering to close it behind him. There’s thunder on his face, a pistol in his hand, and he’s not moving toward Dean’s side of the Impala. He’s crossing in front of the hood; he’s pointing the gun through the glass. Right between Castiel’s eyes.
Castiel stiffens. He doesn’t quite understand the words, but they seem profane. “This is a vessel,” he counters. “My true form is approximately the size of your Chrysler Building.”
“No, we’re just — eating dinner —” Dean attempts, but at that moment Castiel thinks it might be funny to slide his hands around Dean’s belly, under his shirt, and so he does, and Dean startles. Then Cas slips a finger past the waistband of his jeans, teasing, and Dean makes a strangled noise, says, “You know what, yeah, you better call back another time,” and slams Cas’s laptop shut.
When they pop out above the water, the glass retracts, turning the submarine into an open boat. Jack likes to toss food to the pterosaurs so they swoop low to catch it; or really, he likes Dean or Cas to do it while he watches and claps his hands. The sky in Cretaceous World looks a little different, somehow; it doesn’t look quite real. But the sunsets are beautiful.
“Thank you,” Castiel says, dutifully. It causes an odd reaction in Dean; the teasing laughter in his grin fades. Castiel wonders if maybe he wasn’t supposed to say
“Both of you will answer each question,” Rachel’s saying. “At the end of our third and final session comes the most intimate experience of all — you will look into each other’s eyes without speaking for four minutes. Participants have reported that the intensity of feeling they experience from this step is among the most meaningful experiences of their lives.”
to, and then I’ll have to explain the whole angel thing, and then — he’ll probably think I’m crazy and hogtie me in the trunk.”
“Listen,” says Rachel, and she looks kind of sad. “I see a lot of couples come through. And there are some beautiful marriages out there — but there isn’t one in a thousand who look at each other like Castiel looks at you.”
Dean glances at him, wary. “Nothing permanent?” he asks, but he’s already rolling up his shirt sleeve, extending his arm across the table for Castiel.
He allows himself, just for a moment, to imagine acting on it. Scooting closer, stretching out a hand and slipping it under Cas’s shirt. He could pass it off as half-asleep instinct, he thinks. He could wait and see how Cas reacts — decide whether he’s gonna tilt his chin so their mouths come together or just burrow sleepily into Cas’s shoulder.
Dean forces a smile. The clerk stares another moment, then shakes her head. She shoves a pile of pamphlets and flyers and schedules across the desk at them and finishes checking them in.
The crowd erupts around them. Charlie claps enthusiastically, Castiel’s parents politely, and he knows his own hands are performing their duty, moderate, unremarkable. But Dean’s still down there grinning, his face a shining beacon, and everyone’s looking at him on the screen, which is good, because none of them notice that Dean’s smile is directed like a lighthouse beam directly at Castiel.
It’s nothing like Castiel’s first kiss with a man. That encounter was drunken and sloppy, leaving Castiel with swollen lips and a tang of stale beer on his tongue and the sensation that someone had just tried lick his mouth right out of his face. This is sudden and slow and urgent,
She doesn't answer. Instead she reaches out to pick up one of Dean’s photos, the one with his dad, and considers it for a moment; then she sets it back down, carefully, in the right spot. “That kid was a ghost of himself before you showed up.”
Castiel feels reality drop into his stomach like a stone. “Ellen said you’d be out of commission for a while.”
He’s about to open his mouth, to apologize for being ridiculous, when Dean says, softly, “Yeah, you got it, Cas.” Then, after a short pause: “Thanks for asking.”
hard to believe that I’d be here without —” He breaks off, shaking his head like there’s a sting in the unfinished thought. His mouth is tense and unhappy.
It turns Dean to putty in his hands. He smooths his thumbs in circles over Dean’s scalp, and Dean melts against him; Castiel spreads soap down the small of his back, the curves of his ass, his thighs. He thinks about fucking Dean, about spreading those thighs and thrusting between them, and he
It’s the best thing he’s ever felt. It’s white-hot bliss, shorting out his brain, and Dean convulses around him and says something that isn’t words at all, and his fingers find Castiel’s shoulder, dig in painfully. Castiel follows his touch down, folding Dean nearly in half beneath him. He draws himself out, trembling with the effort of restraint, and drives back in.
He doesn’t quit it, though. And Dean doesn’t object; he just swallows and drums two fingers on the steering wheel and says, “I asked my dad about demons, by the way. He hasn’t heard anything about recent activity.”
He can already imagine himself doing this again and again, over the years; touching his fingertips to Cas’s name. Sharing a story about Claire, or about Sam and Eileen. Complaining about a hunt that went shitty. Just saying thanks.
It doesn’t last long. The next rider puts up eighty-four, and two later, an eighty-six, but Castiel’s not really paying attention. Dean’s name still hasn’t been called, but he’s watching for blue chaps all the same, and with every jolt to a cowboy’s body, every undignified fall in the dirt, his gut twists still further. It’s stupid, he knows it is, Dean knows what he’s doing, but every beat of his heart feels like a question that wants to wrench its way out of his chest:
“I’m sorry,” he says, searching Dean’s face. He still looks dazed with lust, still helplessly hard, but Cas realizes with an abrupt surge of guilt that Dean checked in with him constantly; that he hasn’t asked how far Dean is willing to go, what Dean wants —
Dean was worried about him? That makes no sense. “You had no cause for concern. I am an angel. I’m very difficult to kill.”
“Well, it doesn’t have to be dancing. It could be just dinner. Or dinner and a movie, or — well, anyway. After that, you could just be done. Often if it’s a first date you are. The really traditional thing would be to drive the girl home, and then — well, I guess it’s conventional wisdom that if it’s a
“I don’t think so,” Cas says slowly. “It wouldn’t make sense — it’s happened at more than a dozen of these retreats now, right?”
He still feels guilty. He’s got nothing like Charlie’s history; no right to impose edicts for his own emotional well-being. But maybe, he thinks — maybe, that’s how Dean felt. And if it is, Castiel can’t say he’d take it back if he could.
“Okay,” echoes Dean. He sits down in the chair opposite Castiel. His limbs are all nervous energy; he looks right, then left. Then, abruptly, he stands up again and leaves the room.
“Because —” Dean takes a big bite of food, chews for a moment, then sighs, revealing half-masticated eggs. “Because he’ll kill you, that’s why. Or
“You’re a pal, Cas,” Dean tells him, but he’s thinking about how maybe they should have a table back here; some place to sit and drink coffee while the birds come. Cas might like that.
In the dream they’re back on the bluff by the river. Baby’s metal gleams faintly in the starlight; the air is chilly, but her engine is still warm.
Dean is in his morning bowl of cereal, and in the pattern of tail lights on his drive to work; in his cubicle, in his shower, in the line of nitrogen peaks coming off the mass spec. The Dean in his mind lingers over the weird fruit display at the grocery store and snarks back at Charlie’s chat-based insinuations and sinks down next to Castiel on the couch with a beer after a long day; he slides his legs around him so Castiel can lean back against his chest, and he dips his head to press a kiss to the skin behind his ear, and he lays him out on the sheets later, strips him down, puts his mouth all over him, and —
Then there are more birds surrounding them, black and white and brown and tern-like, calling in high voices. They have teeth, too. One of them swoops low to the water and catches a small fish. It gulps it down on the wing.
They still have a month. Late September. Castiel still doesn’t quite believe it: the impending separation, Dean’s apparent willingness to accept something that might feel two doors down from charity. Never mind the idea of Dean’s newly healed body, wrestling with — big metal things, in the middle of Atlantic storms —
Dean’s seen Cas get manipulated — a tool of Heaven. Brainwashed by angels; possessed by Lucifer. He’s seen Cas manipulate
Dean’s eyes widen. Ellen’s a notoriously angry shopper; Bobby usually drives into Claresholm for whatever they need from the supermarket and the UFA farm supply. Yesterday, though, Ellen’s last pair of her favorite work jeans bit the dust. That means
“You’ll be with me and Asa,” Bobby says, when he gets there. He lays a hand on Cas’s horse. “Ezzie here knows what she’s about. Your job is to hold your place in line, nothing fancy. Don’t go too fast; if in doubt, hang back. If a critter makes a break for it, wait for someone to help. Got that?”
They spend the night at a motel; this one is nautical-themed, anchors and buoys decorating the walls. Castiel sits at the table by the window and watches Dean sleep — watches the light of the semi truck headlights sweep through the blinds. He thinks,
Dean laughs horribly, not looking at him. “I mean, it makes sense. The way I been talking about him, you must’ve thought —”
“How can the world have four biggest balls of twine?” Castiel frowns. “And why are they all located in the American Midwest?”
it and how fucked he is by, by all of this, Cas holds up an enormous thermos in one hand. “I made coffee.”
Dean should tell Cas about the ghost girl, anyway. She didn’t seem very threatening. He searches his mental image for something to place her — a distinctive necklace, an identifying mark — and comes up with nothing.
“A best friend,” Dean adds, in case he’s not making himself perfectly fucking clear. “Only, I kind of want them to be more.”
They’re still lying like that when he wakes, Dean still and warm against his chest. There’s white sunlight slanting in through the hotel room blinds, and a stripe of it falls across Dean’s face: eyes closed, lips half-parted with sleep. Castiel kisses behind his ear, and Dean stirs, settles closer against him, making Castiel suddenly and intimately aware of his morning erection.
That night, Dean gives Castiel a blow job that makes his vision white out, long and slow and wicked, huffing breaths of laughter when Castiel arches against the bedspread and begs. His toes curl against Missouri’s bedspread when he finally comes, and Dean doesn’t pull off, just keeps hollowing his cheeks and sucking down until Castiel’s wrung out.
, a fat, squat tank of an animal shuddering with unimaginable power, and if they don’t buck as high as the broncos, they twist three times as hard, torquing their riders from their backs. Fewer riders make the eight seconds, and even those that do still get dumped in heaps on the dirt — at which point the bull turns on them, snorting and seeking, and it’s up to the bullfighters to keep them from getting gored.
“I guess.” Dean looks down at his Blizzard. “I mean, it’s just — you haven’t taken me out for ice cream in — ever.”
“I’m not Dean’s mom,” Ellen continues, “but I figure I’m the closest thing he’s got, and if you want my approval — well. You got it, okay?
“It’s beautiful,” he says. He means it. It’s brown and squat and enormous, and it holds generations of stories in it.
It’s nice, in a way, to feel less dependent; a little more like, with a good horse, he could get where he needed to go. As if he’s a mind reader, Asa says, “My mom never learned to ride. Hates horses. I always figured better to know than not, even if it isn’t your thing.”
In the center of it all, Michael is still and quiet — watching. John squares his shoulders. “I didn’t know,” he says, stronger now. “Until last year. I didn’t know. His mother called me, and I — I drove all night to get here, I —”
So he closes his eyes and conjures it: Dean, four years old, in a kitchen, wrapping a hug around his mother’s knees. Dean lighting off fireworks with his brother in an abandoned field. Dean with his eyes hard, hands easy, a weapon — elbow-deep in gore. Dean as a clock strikes midnight. Dean at the side of a bed in a darkened room. Dean, twenty-six, in a Palo Alto apartment; wide grin plastered over all his needs.
Castiel wants to reach out and touch him. He’s not sure where, or how. “I’m so sorry,” he says again.
Cas won’t vanish in the space of a month. Sam won’t turn the bunker totally upside down. It’s just — a trial. Some space to himself; Dean could use that. Maybe it’s what he’s been needing all along.
Castiel bites back a groan. He wishes he didn’t have to get through the rest of this day; wishes he could leave and take his fantasies of Dean back to somewhere private, somewhere he can have all the unholy thoughts he wants and no one to see them on his face, somewhere he can
He looks tired. There are shadows under his eyes, and his hair is sticking up, messy; there’s dirt in there. Maybe a twig. His trenchcoat is filthy, though none of the stains look like blood.
The disgust breaks through on the last word. It comes out like a snarl; it comes out like an accusation. Dean turns his head, jerky, to glare into Castiel’s eyes.
“Ellen,” a gruff male voice is saying, “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me Novak was sending some flunkie —”
It’s a surreal kind of torture, trying not to lose himself in the wet-hot perfection of Dean’s mouth, trying not to jostle him, trying to
They kiss for a while, more languid than urgent, there against the wall. Dean keeps running his hand over Castiel’s stomach, soothing, though Castiel knows he’s also soothing himself. Eventually, Dean pulls them apart for long enough to ask, lips puffy, “Can we get clean? Together, maybe?”
He gets a hold of himself. “My,” he says. His throat is dry. “My parents. Are we meeting them for breakfast?”
Dean laughs at that. “Yeah — yeah, me too. That was the day you called us. Same day. And then — after that, I felt like I could jump over the fucking moon.”
It’s a clear attempt at humor, bravado stretched thin to breaking, so Castiel smiles. “Sounds hard to sleep through.”
“A dick,” Castiel clarifies. “I mean — I can’t know for sure, but the way you describe that Castiel, and the other self I met in Apocalypse World — I can see myself in them. I know the pathways I could have gone down. I think things — things might have been very different for me, had I not raised you from Hell.”
he’d thought, and then of Plato’s cave, any words he could muster mere shadows on the wall; but overwrought analogies didn’t belong to Dean.
Dean finishes his burger. He eats a few bites of ice cream, then sets down his spoon, wipes his mouth with a paper napkin. “Dad? You’re kind of freaking me out, here.”
There’s plenty more he fantasized about, in last night’s shower. But they’ve got time. This’ll do for a start.
He calls his father on Monday morning to deliver his report. The one he gives is honest, if succinct: Ellen Harvelle is a valuable ally, and a shrewd one. Making her a favorable deal will pay off in the long run. Quality work will be paramount.
A phrase from his cultural lexicon presents itself in Castiel’s mind. “‘Wham, bam, thank you ma’am.’”
Dean’s mouth hangs open for a moment, and then he snaps it closed. A deeper flush stains his cheeks now, and underneath his anger, he looks dangerously close to tears. “Fine,” he says roughly, and then he’s rolling off the bed and jerking his jeans up over his hips, buckling his belt so quickly the leather slaps, angry, against his arm. He grabs a T-shirt and storms past Castiel before he has time to react.
Ellen sighs, setting the photo album down. “He kept trying to talk us out of giving it to you,” she tells Castiel. “He thinks it isn’t much.” She retrieves a small package from under the tree. “Here you go.”
Castiel tunes him out, glancing around. The cowboys have started to gather in the walkways around the chutes, talking and checking their gear, but from this angle, it’s impossible to identify them under their hats. Blue chaps, Dean said, but Cas can’t really make out their legs past the railings; he spends a good minute scanning for that bow-legged walk before giving it up as futile.
“No,” Castiel agrees, “you merely allowed her to cook holiday meals for you and slowly poison Jack until she decided to finally kill him. And you, once you tried to stop her.”
When he sets the pizza boxes — they ordered two — down on the table, he glances awkwardly between them and Castiel.
When they pass by the road that leads into town, there are cars parked there. Some DOT trucks, surveyors scratching their heads, but people are also spreading out blankets on the nearby grass, unfurling sun umbrellas. Someone’s in swim trunks. Somebody else is driving up with a boat on a trailer — getting it turned around, preparing to back it down into the lake.
When he knocks on the door, he’s answered by a rustle of beads, then a puff of incense when it swings open. Missouri Moseley looks at him for a moment with her hands on her hips, then says, “You must be Castiel,” and pulls him into a hug.
“Uh,” says Dean several hours later. The sun is setting; they’re sitting on the dock in front of the cabin. The water is orange and rippling, trees all hazed with gold, and it might be the most beautiful place Dean’s ever been. “About those fish guts.”
Finally, he catches the telltale prickle on the back of his neck, and when he turns she’s there — seated on a cottonwood root, skirts cascading around her knees. She’s watching him with something measured in her gaze.
They drive north after that, into the suburbs where Dean grew up. They drive past the garage where John used to work. They drive past the old house. There’s no trace of a fire Castiel can see; Dean says, “Yeah, it was — they did a good job, I guess. The insurance company or whatever.”
If he gets Cas back, he has to use whatever time he’s got. He has to use it well. He can’t push it away and pretend it never happened.
The cold kisses Castiel’s cheeks and nose, but his body is warm. With his arm immobilized, there’s no way he can read his watch; no way he can measure the passage of time except in the ebb and flow of this strange imagined battle in the sky. Or maybe, he thinks, not a battle but a dance — one performed by a celestial being so immense that only the occasional flare of the fabric of her skirt clips the earth’s atmosphere and transforms the familiar heavens with streaming light. As fanciful metaphors go, this, he knows, is closer to the truth — the sun his cosmic dancer, its garment the solar wind.
“Yeah, uh, same.” Dean hesitates — how does this work? Is he allowed to make small talk, or not? But he wants to know, so he asks: “How’ve you been getting on?”
Jack loves it. He likes to point up at the sky and down at the grass and make it shimmer, gold sparks of the cosmic force that lives in everything; that is, somehow, Jack. Castiel still isn’t sure what happened, why Jack didn’t vanish when he gave himself over to it; he’s not sure how Jack wrenched him out of the Empty, either. There are a lot of things he’d like to ask Jack, if he could, but — well.
He’s still avoiding Castiel’s eyes. Castiel leans in; on an impulse, he touches Dean’s chin with his fingers, forcing him to look up.
Sensing that he’s closing Dean off, Castiel swallows, his sense of himself rushing back. “I’m sorry. I — am not accustomed to the realities of your profession. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”
He has no new calls. No texts; but that doesn’t mean anything, surely. Dean wouldn’t have had his phone on him while he was riding. Its battery might be dead. It might still be in his locker at the Stampede grounds, if no one’s brought it to him yet.
Castiel doesn’t think that’s Dean’s intent when he manhandles him into the bed. But somewhere between unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt and starting on the fly of his jeans, Dean’s chin sags into his shoulder; his fingers flex unconsciously against Castiel’s bare skin.
“You’re back,” says Jack. And then, excitedly, “Did you try my cake? Dean made it. It’s really good.”
Dean hasn’t known many ghosts who can stop getting angry, once they start. But McKenzie’s been calm for a whole conversation, and they have Cas up their sleeve if things get hairy. It’s the best idea he’s got.
“I can sleep when I’m dead,” Dean mutters, but he doesn’t look convinced; Castiel loves him. He loves the dark circles under Dean’s eyes and the irritation at the corners of his mouth and his stupid obstinacy. He loves him, and he’s so angry at him he could throw him through a wall.
A lump of sadness forms in Castiel’s chest. “I was,” he says, as lightly as he can. “Eagle Scout, even. My dad told me when he signed me up as a Cub that it would look good on my resume if I ran for political office someday.”
The next morning means cooking brunch for his parents. It’s his own fault — he invited them, somehow eager to show off what Dean’s taught him even though the idea of uttering Dean’s name in their presence sends him into nervous shivers. He makes pancakes and bacon and slices the fruit, and Charlie takes charge of mimosas. She makes them stronger than any of the Novaks are prepared for, with the result that they’re all a little drunk and tittering and getting along better than they almost ever do by the time they make their way back to the arena.
Once Dean’s changed, he finds Cas and Laura and Thomas not on the croquet lawn but the bocce court. There’s a look of intense concentration on Cas’s face when he throws the jack, and Dean stands back for a moment to admire it. God, he’s — he’s fucking
Castiel lets the words sink in. He can picture it: a teenage Dean scolding a much smaller version of the floppy-haired Sam Winchester to put on his seatbelt.
Dean — it’s just that, from everything he knows of himself, he should be more likely to spend those eight seconds biting his fingernails with worry; the impulse he suppresses should be to squeeze his eyes tight shut, not to leap from his seat and whoop for the entire stadium to hear. And yet here he is, still flushed and triumphant, blood still buzzing with the exhilarating image of Dean whirling on the back of a wild bay mare, even after hours have passed, and the rest of the evening’s events, and Dean’s watching him with cool amusement from his seat in the hotel room’s only chair.
Those are questions of birthplaces and battlefields, and it isn’t about that, not really; it isn’t about God’s plan or God’s story. It isn’t even about Castiel’s.
“Of course there is.” Castiel parks and shifts his full attention to Dean; he can’t help but smile. “Tell me about — pool.”
Dean throws his head back, baring his throat. His hair brushes Castiel’s shoulder. Before Castiel can kiss his skin, though, lick a stripe down his Adam’s apple, bite his collarbone, Dean’s lifting his face again. He’s watching the mirror, hungry, as he slides off of Castiel’s cock again — as he rides back down.
“Yeah, but —” Dean runs a hand through his hair, huffing out a breath; he seems relieved at the change in topic. “Man, I had no way of getting in touch with you, nothing. Not like you carry one of these, right?” He lifts his cell phone.
This is a stupid train of thought. Dean digs a fist into his thigh, and closes out of the window, and slams his laptop closed.
His heart is hammering behind his ribs, his head roaring. He’s still turned on, horribly so, but his erection is fading fast.
“I liked the steer wrestling,” Naomi admits, swaying slightly and clutching Castiel’s bicep for balance as they make their way to their seats. “I think I would be good at it.”
“I was just looking at this menu,” Cas says, “and thinking about your cooking. You enjoy feeding your family, and sometimes you’re embarrassed by it, but you shouldn’t be. I like that you like cooking.”
“Listen to me,” Castiel tells him, urgent. “No angel can possess you without your consent. Do you understand? They have to ask, and you have to say yes. Don’t ever say yes, Dean. Promise me. If they find you —”
Slowly, disappointment starts to climb Dean’s spine; then embarrassment. He’s coming on way too fucking strong. Cas doesn’t want any part of this — this voyeurism shit, and Dean was dumb to suggest it. It’s just an awkward mistake, and Dean shouldn’t have pushed, shouldn’t have —
Dean opens his car door, then circles to Castiel’s. He grips his hand to help him out. His skin is warm.
He stops himself short. Rachel’s threading her way through the tables; she’s right there. He was about to say,
Dean lifts his own head slightly to look at Cas, out of focus; from this angle, he’s got almost the beginnings of a double chin. Castiel finds it kind of adorable, and wants to kiss it, so he does; a tiny spasm of tension passes through Dean’s hand where it’s splayed at the small of Castiel’s back, and he says, “I mean, I — I’ve only ever bottomed for guys before. Figured that was what I liked.”
They stop for dinner at a noisy roadhouse bar. There’s a neon sign out front of a cowboy on a bucking bronco; Castiel watches it for a moment as it flashes back and forth, the horse arching low and then rearing high, the cowboy waving his hat.
It’s a dinosaur. Long and armored and low to the ground — an ankylosaur; Dean remembers those from the movies. It’s more colorful than in the movies, though, pink and turquoise, and it lifts its head to watch them as they pass.
Castiel leaves the Walking L after a few more stolen kisses, Dean’s thumb brushing dangerously over the inseam of his jeans, and a very awkward wave to Bobby Singer and Ellen Harvelle. Dean walks him to his car and holds the door for him, and Castiel wants to kiss him goodbye all over again. Instead, he flips him off through the window glass, and Dean roars with laughter and pats the top of the car as Cas rolls down his window. “See you Friday.”
It’s not until halfway through the main course that he feels his phone buzz against his thigh. He covers it with his palm, instinctive, muffling the slight noise. If it’s from Jo —
“I’ve been wondering,” he says, voice low, not meeting anyone’s eye, “if that’s why — the cavities, and the lactose thing. When I — back when we were kids, I was never sure there’d be enough food for, for either of us, never mind both, but when there was — I never worried if I could
Before Castiel knows it, he’s up in Esmeralda’s saddle again, and Asa is patiently explaining neck reining and styles of saddles; how to safely carry a lariat and throw a basic loop. He’s more than a little embarrassed to realize just how much went over his head, two weekends ago with Dean — he really made no effort to direct Esmeralda, and she followed Dean without complaint, but he’d have done it entirely wrong if he tried.
That’s what gives Castiel the courage, somehow. They’re both still wearing their hats. Castiel reaches out, as gently as he can, to remove Dean’s from his head. Then he places two fingers against his jaw and turns his face and kisses him.
Dean’s eyes are fixed on his face, pupils blown wide. His parted lips, the set of his chin, make him look vulnerable. The ache of love tightens in Castiel’s chest.
Castiel blinks, in a haze. He barely remembers it, but it was, he knows it was; he felt the dance of it in his own blood, his own breath, every tingling inch of his skin. He
Her voice drops abruptly as she turns back away from the window. Castiel doesn’t need to hear Dean’s reply to know it’s dismissive, that he’s rolling whatever blame there is right back around to himself.
He thinks about his occasional searches of academic job boards. About the life he sometimes lets himself dream about. About having an office at the core storage lab, or down the hall from Rowena; about losing himself in the mysteries of deep time.
They hang up not long after that, but Castiel stands there for a time, holding his phone, bare skin growing increasingly chilled in his air-conditioned apartment. The reflected clouds have faded to a bruised blue and mauve, evening sky pale in the gaps between them. He hears distant honking from the street below, sirens.
“All right,” he says, “like we practiced.” Jack grips the net alongside his hand, inexpertly; his head turns as a bird flies by. “One, two,
sure fucking remembers. Remembers it being more difficult than it had any right to be; remembers Cas patiently positioning him, hands on his shoulders, his hips.
By the time Dean returns, Jo’s acting it out, attempting to play both parts before deputizing Asa to stand in for her role. As Rufus, she flops theatrically on the ground, clutching her ankles, and dissolves into peals of laughter.
He knows Cas has had his memories fucked with plenty of times, creeps like Naomi drilling into his goddamn
Even in the dim of the motel room, Castiel can see their color; the way they’re hazed with pleasure, the way Dean’s gaze is unmoored. His chest is bare and lovely, flushed pink, ribs arched; Castiel thumbs his nipple, then pulls it to make it sting. He sees Dean’s cock jerk in the mirror, sees his lips part, and he wants to see his own cock, too — wants to see Dean sinking down onto it, wants to watch his face as he does.
Castiel squints in the direction he’s pointing. He can see a sharply rising cliff face, hazy in the distance, sudden behind the pine-dappled foothills. There’s snow on its peak. The mountain front in Alberta is like that — abrupt and stupefying in its grandeur. Cas has gotten fond of it, in his time here. “The McConnell Thrust,” he says.
“You sent me here.” Castiel braces his hands on the wall, pushing himself to his feet. “Not — not God, or — just you.”
Castiel hasn’t heard a single static note of revelation since he got here. Heaven has been quiet, and that’s not unusual; that’s how it’s been for centuries. Right now, the angels should be waiting. Preparing, quietly, for their father to give the word.
The mare’s still wild, still bucking a little as she races a circle around the arena, but Cas gets the sense it’s mostly for the joy of it — almost, that she’s showing off for the crowd. The two other horsemen in the arena move to flank her as they did the first horse, and the rider falls sideways to wrap his arms around the other man’s waist. As his own mount gallops on, he lets go, dropping neatly to the dirt. He grins out at the crowd, waving, and jogs to retrieve his hat.
Dean’s still looking at him like he can’t quite believe Castiel is real. Like he needs to memorize him, sitting here in the Impala, before he vanishes again. After a moment, he swallows, then blurts, “I didn’t even know you guys
Castiel touches his thumb to the corner of Dean’s eye, the delicate skin there. He takes a careful breath of his own. “Are you sure?”
Castiel doesn’t need telling twice. His finger slides deeper as he pulls off and sinks down again, and maybe he doesn’t know what he’s doing, but it doesn’t really seem to matter when Dean’s writhing and cursing and then saying, “Cas, I’m —”
Every laugh exchanged balloons in his heart. Every time Dean takes a bite of pie — when Gabriel realized how enthusiastic Dean was about pie, he baked three more. Watching Dean and Anna talk animatedly about old movies — Anna has an abiding passion for the Golden Age of Hollywood; Dean’s seen a lot of her favorites, presumably in various motel rooms, and does a terrible Humphrey Bogart impression. Listening to Kali interrogate him about cowboy cuisine, and even pull out a pen and paper to start taking notes.
It gets worse with time, though, not better. On Tuesday, Dean says, “Cas — I gotta get back to the ranch.”
“Dean,” says Cas. He’s been holding something to himself, too — something he suddenly can’t anymore. He hates the words, more than a little, as they drop from his lips. “I talked to Gabriel. My brother. He runs HR for the firm. I didn’t say anything specific, just that — I have a friend who’s looking for work as a welder.”
Eileen shrugs. “I asked him what else he would change. If there’s any people he would bring back to life.”
“I’m going to make you some tea,” Castiel tells him, “okay?” He’s never seen Dean drink tea, but there’s some in the kitchen, presumably Asa’s. The tea doesn’t matter anyway. It’s the ritual of it, the implication that someone knows what to do. It’s what Charlie’s done for him, more times than he can count. “You can come with me if you want, or you can stay here. Either one’s fine."
And then the line of cowboys opens; someone shoulders through. The next moment, he’s leaping the rail, dodging a bullfighter, and he’s down in the dust at the fallen cowboy’s side. He’s got his head between his knees, stabilizing his spine, bending over him, murmuring low, and it’s Dean.
In the end, though, he doesn’t get his own hotel room. He gets the guest room at Gabriel’s apartment instead.
“The place I most want to be in the world is where you are. If you’d prefer I didn’t come, please tell me. But if you don’t object — I’ll go with you.”
attention to the stages of child development, not less. He hasn’t learned to tell fact from fiction yet.”
at kissing, way better than he has any right to be. He’s got a hand inside Dean’s shirt now, rucking his flannel and his t-shirt out of the way, and his palm on the bare skin of Dean’s hip is a shock — a revelation. Dean takes the instant of distraction to drop his mouth to Cas’s throat, and Cas gasps and squirms, baring it further.
Cas hums agreement. He turns partway to look at Dean, the light from the open kitchen door falling on his cheek, his jaw; “We have chairs now, you know.”
He shouldn’t be alive. Everything in him is broken. Still — Castiel reaches out, warily, to try and heal him.
you,” Castiel says, and pushes Dean back far enough to scramble out of the rest of his clothes in peace.
Dean’s actually pretty sure the only reason Sam hasn’t invited a bevy of hunters to come stay is that he remember show much it weirded Dean out, the first time he came home to find the bunker full of strangers. He’s letting Dean raise the idea first, which is nice of him, though he keeps dropping hints; about how much Claire and Kaia loved Dean’s cooking, the last time they came to visit. About how many spare bedrooms they have;
He peers outside the curtains once. If this is a trick, it’s a well constructed one; the parking lot is lit by halogen streetlights, their glow orange on the rain-shiny pavement. It’s about half full of cars, including a big black one that gleams outside the door. It’s mostly quiet, but there’s the occasional screech of tires on the highway, stoplights turning from green to yellow to red.
light, Dean’s hand skimming down Castiel’s bicep, Dean knocking his borrowed cowboy hat back on his head, Dean kissing Castiel like he’s water after a long drought, to be savored, sanctified, rationed.
Dean puts Zeppelin on the tape deck. The bass riff pounds through the speakers as he swings the Impala out of its parking space, as he turns onto the highway.
Castiel can feel eyes on him. The bartender’s linger for a moment every time she passes, but there are patrons watching him, too. Never for very long at a time, but they come back again and again.
How long they drive like that, Castiel doesn’t know. The tape runs out, and he replaces it with the next Zeppelin he can find. The wind swirls around him, plucks at the collar of his shirt. Outside, the night races past them. Baby’s headlight beams carve their path through the dark.
Castiel chances a sidelong look as he drives. Dean’s hands are twisting in his lap. “You don’t need to do anything differently,” he says, “you’re perfect,” but Dean only frowns and looks away.
Castiel yelps at the indignity, and manages to swat Dean’s bare ass as he dances away, laughing. He gets his revenge on his knees in the bathroom, hands on wet skin and mouth on Dean’s cock, and pulls off in time to force both of them right back into the shower to clean off. Dean returns the favor, and by the time breakfast and coffee are ready, they’re both still shirtless, trading open-mouthed kisses and heated touches every time they pass each other in the kitchen.
Castiel’s hand is trapped against Dean’s stomach, Castiel’s legs tangled with his legs. So Castiel goes with him, turning onto his side, too. Dean makes a pleased, sleepy sound and settles closer, his back pressed snug against Castiel’s chest.
“I said it’s fine,” Dean repeats. “Listen — Dale Newton was wondering if there’s a quiet place he could put that rope horse of his for a few hours, thinks she tweaked a muscle and doesn’t want her prancing on it with everything going on. I thought I could show him down to the old sheep yard if that’s okay.”
it’s the best thing he’s ever felt, and Dean is practically glowing beneath him, eyes hungry as he watches Castiel tremble apart at the seams, and then he’s coming, all over Dean’s shirt, and he’s shaking and cupping Dean’s head in his hand and kissing him so hard, so deeply, he’s surprised that neither of them runs out of air.
The gondola sways, and Castiel lets it lurch him across the seat toward Dean. He spreads his palm across Dean’s jaw and turns his face to bring their mouths together.
“Yeah,” says Dean, “but like — uh.” He runs his free hand through the hair at the back of his head, mussing it; then, self-consciously, smooths it back into place. “Man, I — I don’t think I’m ready for that, Cas.”
Castiel swallows, taking in her words. He understands, suddenly: Dean’s bull ride wasn’t about winning. Nor was Jo’s race, or even his bronc ride, not really. It’s about the pride they have in this ranch, in their work, in this little slice of the world and the animals and people that call it home. It’s about showing everyone — showing
And there are all sorts of forms inside it, catching the sun as they swell and grow. Magical, intricate forms, like snowflakes, or blown glass — they’re beautiful. Some look like little globes armored in ornamented plates. Others are long and spindly, bedecked in spines. And they’re all
“You drove all night.” Dean runs a hand over his face. “You drove all night. Great. Fucking great. I — what, Sam leaves, and voila, you’ve got a new youngest son?”
Castiel hesitates. He hates this. “Strong vessels, they — they run in families. Often attuned to the particular angel who intends to make use of them. Heaven will go to great lengths, sometimes, to — to prune and train those family trees.”
He flushes slightly on the words, and Castiel sees, in a lightning flash of clarity, an image of a younger Dean, joking with a faceless, mop-headed teenager; pretending not to remember the cases and names. Then Dean says, “He got into
The silence has grown so thick — even Floss decides to give them personal space, leaping from the bed when Dean slows to cross the cattle guard into the main yard — that Cas seizes on the first question he can think of to break it. “What’s it mean, anyway? The Walking L?”
he asks, flatly, but he shakes his head and reaches into the bag, rifling through fabric. He glances over at Castiel again before levering himself up in the seat to wriggle into his jeans, then pulls on a pair of socks and shoves his feet into the boots. He’s halfway out of the car before he stops and glances back. “Well? You coming?”
Dean freezes, hand still down his boxers. He’s thrown off the covers. There’s no way not to tell what he’s doing.
He keeps his eyes on John’s. Watches the challenge register there, then the anger; Dean lowers his spoon.
When he picks up his rental sedan at the airport, he tucks the hat into its trunk, out of sight. Then he drives to Gabe and Kali’s.
“It’s —” Dean huffs out a tense breath as the song fades. “Some of the guys, they got a place to come back to, right? Lot of ‘em are from old ranching families. They’ll take over when their dads age out. I don’t —”
He and Gabe and Kali all drive out to Michael’s together, Castiel in the back seat with a dish balanced in his lap and one snug against his hip. He cushions them whenever Gabe takes a turn.
It seems to take Dean a moment to process that logic. Then he shrugs. “Well, you know I never say no to pie.”
Rachel’s face folds into a sort of a frown. She gives him a dubious look, then says, “There was a — um. It wasn’t during the retreat, but a couple days later, one of our kids died. We were in — Chattanooga, that weekend. They stayed in the area to do some more rock-climbing afterward, and there was an accident. It hit the whole staff pretty hard.” She smiles again, a little bravely.
Then he turns brightly away from Sam, bends down to Jack. “Hey, kid. You still wanna help me make cookies? I think we’ve got just enough chocolate chips. Long as no one goes and
He hadn’t realized how far back he’s pulled from his family. Not just his parents, but Anna and Gabriel too. He’s pretty sure Gabriel made a trans flag out of marshmallow meringue in there, and that’s — not something he ever thought he’d see.
He’s bought white wine to use in the sauce, but Castiel goes to the fridge and finds the bottle his mother left on her last visit, almost five months ago now. He’s sure it cost an arm and a leg and is far too refined for either of their palates, but it tastes delicious all the same. They drink it with dinner, moving on to the remainder of the cheap bottle once they’re done, with the result that they’re both a little tipsy an hour or two later when Castiel’s laptop chimes with the sound of an incoming call from Charlie.
And he remembers his rush of relief, rounding that tree and seeing Cas, whole and alive and safe — the overwhelming relief that finally, finally, he gets to ask Cas to
Desire races itself down Castiel’s limbs. He squeezes, lightly, at the back of Dean’s neck; when his voice comes out it’s unsteady. “I’m not sure I see the problem.”
Let him think what he wants. Cas admitted on the ride down that his human senses are getting stronger and stronger; that taste is nearly intense now as it was when he first fell in love with peanut butter and jelly. He’s not sure what it means; he thinks he might be losing his grace again. Thinks he might be almost human.
There’s a long silence from Charlie’s end. Just when he’s started to worry that he’s actually caused her head to explode this time, she responds, almost soberly,
It didn’t take Rebecca Harrison, though. She turns up on the fourth day to ask them, exasperated, to stop kicking up a fuss; she owes some money to some dangerous people, she says, and wanted to disappear. Her neighbors all know, though, and one of them had the bright idea of blaming it on the local monster, and now she’s on national radio news — “That’s true,” Dean says, wry — and she’d just like it to stop so she can vanish in peace.
Dean rises to follow suit, and moves behind Castiel as he fumbles with the shower dial, fingertips brushing his hips. Castiel bends further to test the water temperature, and suddenly the erect length of Dean’s cock is brushing his bare ass, and they both startle, Castiel gasping, Dean lurching hastily back. “Shit, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean —”
Castiel looks around. Dean’s right — their precipitous ascent up the bluff has deposited them back on the wide gravel road that makes its more deliberate way down to the ranch. “I — didn’t appreciate it as much then,” he says stiffly.
If he isn’t supposed to ask personal questions, Mia doesn’t show it. “I’ve been well, thank you. I’ve relocated and started up a new practice, and it’s going well so far. Your brother has referred me a number of people, in fact, who wouldn’t be able to speak openly to a regular therapist — you understand if I don’t go into detail about their backgrounds, but there are many hunters and monsters alike whose mental health needs have never really been served.”
At dinner, Dean looks increasingly nervous. His foot is jittering on the floor; he casts an anxious glance at Castiel, once, almost pleading, as if to say,
Castiel shakes his head, keeps on shaking it despite the pressure of metal against his skin; if he’d been killed in this time, wouldn’t he —
“Make it top shelf,” Dean tells him, to whoops from the other cowboys. When it’s his turn, Castiel orders a beer for himself and lets the press of people carry him to a long wooden booth. By the time he’s settled himself, though, half of them have dispersed — most to the dance floor, where Jo and Cody Traister are now laughing as they struggle to keep up with an energetic fiddle tune, and a handful of others to the dart boards in a corner. Castiel finds himself across the table from Dean.
Dean shoots him a sidelong glance. “Cas,” he says, “you are so fucking weird,” but his voice sounds fond, so that’s all right.
When Jack moves into view, his eyes look anxious, but his chin is set. He stands there for a moment, letting Dean watch him for over the rim of his glass, and doesn’t speak.
Castiel moves to set them right. Dean always has them propped against his lamp, just so: Dean and his mother, Dean and John and Sam. They feel like a promise: that he’s coming back.
Dean’s drinking. His heart isn’t in it; he’s barely made a dent in the bottle. He feels tired, but he doesn’t feel drunk. The knock on his doorjamb is hesitant.
From the look on Dean’s face, he’s angrier than Castiel is. He sucks in a deep breath as John shuts the door — turning to unleash it in words.
Castiel frees his hand, punching a small bereft sound out of Dean’s chest; it cuts off quickly when Castiel squeezes the back of his neck instead. “On your knees.”
“Let’s go there,” Castiel says. His heart is swelling; Dean is grinning at him. Like he loves nothing more than taking Castiel to roadside attractions. Like he’d gladly spend forever observing giant fiberglass sculptures with an angel by his side. Like this is his twine ball, his life’s work; Castiel isn’t sure which of them is wrapped around the other’s fingers.
Castiel catalogues the sensations methodically, unhurried. There’s Dean’s palm splayed against his chest, his left pectoral, two fingertips on Castiel’s collarbone — his hand relaxes with time, curling, but Castiel can still feel his pulse where their skin touches. There’s Dean’s breath stirring the hair below Castiel’s ear, chin jutting into his shoulder; the way his breathing steadies with sleep. There’s the swell of his lungs against Castiel’s ribs, and Castiel is glad that he is in a form that breathes, too — that their chests can rise and fall in counterpoint, in sync.
Jesus,” Castiel takes that as his cue. He shepherds Dean into the bathroom and strips him of his clothes, lips chasing hands, as if he could exorcise anyone else’s touch; he runs soapy hands over the planes of Dean’s body and kneads shampoo into his hair, and Dean shudders, pliant under his touch.
Dean’s hand jerks on the steering wheel. And an enormous black pickup truck is passing them on the left — lurching back into the lane in front of them, hitting its brakes. A truck Castiel recognizes.
When they pull up to the hotel lobby, Castiel’s father is standing just inside the glass doors, ear to his phone. He gives them a smiling wave and turns away, nodding seriously at whatever the person on the other end is saying. When Castiel hesitates, he motions them on inside, pointing toward the hotel’s restaurant. It’s green-carpeted and half-hidden behind a massive rock-slab fountain, every table frothing with artfully folded napkins in the soft light that suffuses down from the domed ceiling many floors above.
The woman’s voice is low and dangerous. “The last thing Bill wanted,” she says, “was to lose this place. And you know as well as I do, Bobby, that we are
They listen to it for ten minutes more. It’s far off — it strains Dean’s hearing. He feels spell-bound, caught in stillness here in these magical woods, Cas’s hands rooting him where he stands.
They have a lot of time for other things, too, though. That’s the thing about laying a false trail, Dean tells Castiel — you can’t be too flashy about it. You’ve got to lay low, let things unfold. So they spend evenings on the beach, or at pool tables where Dean wins money, or at a casino where he manages to not quite lose it. They drive north along the shore one night to a town where Dean says Bruce Springsteen used to play and watch a very loud concert inside a building called the Stone Pony. Dean tells Castiel the music is shit, but he seems delighted anyway, and he sways warm against Castiel in the press of the crowd.
Dean isn’t conscious of having backed up, but Cas somehow has him almost against the door. The bare inches between them are charged, electric. Dean wants to close them; he wants to bask in the anticipation longer. To stay in this moment for hours. Days.
“It feels close,” Cas admits quietly. “It feels — closer than I thought it could get. But I have an idea.”
Dean hadn’t realized it was coming this fast. They’ve only got a few hours of retreat left — the final
The word cracks. Castiel blinks back into the haze of the streetlight, and Dean’s swaying in it. His harsh facade crumbles, has already crumbled; there’s something desperate in the glitter of his eyes. “Sam — is he — back in the life? Does he
“Novak, that’s right, yeah, Castiel Novak. He was — helping me on this case out in Jersey, and then you called and I figured, sounds like more backup the better, so —”
It begins in both of their chests at the same time. Exuberance bubbling to get out — Dean can feel his own grin widening, see Cas’s dimpling, and his ribs are shaking. He’s trembling all over with the effort of not snorting out loud — this is ridiculous. This is incredible, and ridiculous, and as soon as their four minutes are up Dean’s going to kiss this man, this man who’s an angel who loves him, this man Dean would die for but better yet
Castiel is a scientist. Most phenomena he observes, he has an explanation for, or a reasonable pathway to finding an explanation.
“I don’t like this.” A discordant hum is spreading through Castiel’s grace. It feels awful, muddy and cloying. It makes him feel like he can’t think.
John is waiting for them on the porch. He’s got the front door ajar; “Come on, come on.” His gestures are urgent, voice soft, eyes darting up and down the street. “It’s a safe house. Get inside.”
It feels like a cloud passing over the sun. The day brightens again. A bird is singing somewhere; another flits through the sycamore’s branches, dropping briefly into a beam of light. It’s lustrous black, with flashing white wings and a jewel-red chest. It sings again.
That startles a laugh out of Dean, and he turns his head, suddenly, to plant a fierce kiss on Castiel’s lips. “Yeah,” he says, and kisses him again, and three more times, and they do.
He ends up walking along the river. There’s a bike path that runs along it for miles, dipping through scattered parks and up onto residential streets. He leaves the shining skyscrapers of the city center behind, and watches the Bow roll on at his left, wide and powerful and blue. It’s chilly out, but he keeps moving, enough that he works up a sweat. He passes playing fields and weedy underpasses and big glass-fronted houses under construction, and thinks,
Getting Cas back would be worth that. Getting everyone back. Even if Dean wasn’t around to say — to say —
He wonders if they’ll dress up in costumes. He tries to imagine what Dean would pick; he has no idea. He can’t help picturing him shining out of sunflower petals, even now.
Cas looks as shocked as if Dean’s just announced Blåhaj is secretly his long-lost son. He shoves his chair back from the table, half-rises, then slumps back into his seat. He’s staring into the middle distance like he’s working out some very complicated math problem, like he wants to double check and make sure he’s got it right.
my doctor,” Dean grumbles, after she’s gone. “Or — I guess I have, but —” he stops, scowling. “Cas, concussions suck.”
“Are you all right?” Castiel asks after a long moment. It seems like a stupid question, but it also seems like the question humans ask at moments like these.
Dean tries to nip Castiel’s thumb as he withdraws it. Castiel drags it across Dean’s lower lip instead, watching the swell of it, the shine; then he bends close and kisses Dean on the mouth.
Castiel watches him fondly. Affection swells inside his ribs. “Time to return to the bunker, do you think?”
Dean’s not even planning to stop by the desk that day. Normally he would — to check in with Marta, make some noise about the weather — but he’s in kind of a hurry. The P.O. box is mostly empty. And Cas is waiting in the car.
“— yeah, well, it’s not like you did her much better, leaving her car and her phone sitting outside her apartment like that without a goddamn word!”
Castiel chews, making a show of considering. “Well,” he says, swallowing, “when a man offers another man sourdough pancakes —”
The table’s already set for two, cast in warm candlelight glow. They can hear the murmur of voices and clink of plates of the restaurant outside, but this place is all theirs.
There’s a twanging of wires, and a moment later, the calf springs to its feet, prancing away up the hill on the other side of the fence. Castiel can see it clearly for the first time now — there’s a thin line of blood on its right hind leg, but it doesn’t look too badly hurt. It shakes its head vigorously, eyeing Castiel and the horses.
Castiel feels Dean stiffen, then shift carefully out of Castiel’s space, cutting off the contact between them. “What did he say?”
Castiel senses bruises, stiff muscles that will be stiffer tomorrow. He has to close his eyes to muster the power to heal them. When he opens them again, he’s swaying, just a little.
Dean sighs. “I know you know, I just — some people can’t stomach it. Branding, I mean. We do it as quick and painless as we can, but we’re still sticking a hot iron in their flank. If it’s too much…”
Then he says: “She had Christmas records she would play every year. You were already singing along when you were three. ‘We Three Kings’ was your favorite.”
Dean’s eyes are prickling; his chest burns. “I — Cas,” he says. “Have you ever — been put under by a djinn? Like, did you see the world they made for you?”
Castiel has complicated feelings about his father’s God. Days like this make it hard to wholly reject him.
“Okay, says Claire loudly. She’s rising in her seat, leveling an accusing finger at Dean. “So what, you’re screwing some floozy? And you’re letting him?”
Some mask drops back into place. Dean snorts, lightly, and shoots Castiel a wry look. “All right, well. If I’m handcuffed to you anyway — what d’you say we get breakfast?”
So Dean’s been in love with the guy for like ten years, right. It’s not news. He knows nothing’s ever going to happen; Cas is an angel, it’s not like that; sometimes he even forgets it’s there. It’s just — part of him. How he’s built. Wanting Cas is like breathing; he doesn’t need it to be anything more.
He laughs and shakes his head; he hasn’t told the Harvelles about Dean’s change in plans. His thumb hovers over the button to delete the text, but he closes his phone instead.
Castiel catches his breath and takes a couple steps away, working out the stiffness in his legs. He’s aware of Dean’s eyes on him. He stretches carefully, propping one foot on a boulder and bending at the waist, and nearly groans at his body’s protest.
“All right,” says Rachel over the microphone, “as you can see on your program, this morning we’ll be embarking on our second session of the
He photographs the puppies. He photographs the horses, and the changing leaves, and the sky, at morning and mid-day and dusk. He photographs the bridle Asa’s been working on, with fine patterns stamped into the leather, and photographs Asa, too, quiet and intent on his task.
Calm the fuck down, it’s — he’s —” And he’s muscling between his father and the passenger side door, planting both hands on John’s chest to shove him backward. Castiel’s hand is on the door release; if the gun goes off — “Chill out, okay? He’s a friend.”
says the neon sign reflected in a puddle. A couple comes out of their room to smoke in the plastic chairs outside their door, then goes inside again. A pair of people across the parking lot have an angry, murmured conversation, and one gives the other money.
The highways out west are easier to drive; they weren’t as busy even in the best of times. Baby passes through wide wind-swept plains and dense spruce forests. Sunlit peaks, still snow-capped even in the depths of summer, tower over the road. Dean catches Jack gazing out the window, admiring, a soft look of joy in his eyes.
Still, he thinks of the northern lights, his first night with Dean, and he can’t help himself; he shakes his head, and he smiles.
Dean lets out a snort, then immediately winces. “Ellen’s trying to keep my useless ass on at full pay. But I’m looking at six weeks recovery, minimum, and by then I’ll be out of the rodeo standings for sure. Gotta find something where I can make bank for a few months, try and get my dad that money for Sammy. Oilpatch jobs pay pretty good, and I can weld, so that’s —” He breaks off coughing, face twisting with pain, and Castiel’s gut wrenches at his own helplessness. “That’s something,” Dean finishes weakly.
It’s a discovery, this process. What it’s like to have a human sleeping in bed with him — what it’s like for a human to
he wants to say. Fortunately, Dean seems to take his silence as an affirmative, because he continues, “I don’t actually
about walking down the hall and knocking on Cas’s door and walking him right back inside it. About what if Cas came to
He learns quickly that he can’t take the freeway. He tries to get on I-80 west of Lincoln, but gives up a few miles later. The highway’s a maze, two- and three- and four-car pile-ups, jack-knifed semi trailers blocking both lanes. A couple times he has to off-road it across the median, switch to the oncoming lanes for a while, which makes him twitchy even though it doesn’t seem like anyone in the world is left to run into.
“Are you feeling any better? You seemed unwell last night. I thought those mussels looked questionable — I told your father, being so far from the ocean —”
made it,” he adds, like an afterthought, and Castiel only realizes as he passes through the door in Dean’s wake that John is talking about him.
Dean solves his problem by extending a blind hand. Castiel steps closer to take it, and Dean squeezes his fingers, tight.
There’s a large, hairy-looking coconut on the table at his elbow, and a handful of Mounds bars beside it. Dean’s still grinning into his whiskey glass, looking something close to incandescent with happiness, and Castiel blurts, “Why are people giving you coconuts?”
Dean’s got his fingers hooked in Castiel’s shirt collar, head thrown back to let Castiel’s lips graze his throat, when suddenly his palm flattens against Castiel’s chest. “Wait — wait.”
He can see the unhappiness settle into Dean’s limbs, and hates himself for being the cause. “Not even to my — to Ellen and Jo and Bobby?”
“Nah.” Dean shifts in his seat. “It doesn’t — bug me or anything. It just — it was different, you know?”
He stops, and scowls, as if he can’t find the words and is furious with it. Abruptly, Castiel’s selfishness abandons him.
Or now. A mile from the bunker, maybe two, Impala parked in an empty field. There’s a beer to Dean’s lips, grief and resolve in his eyes. Led Zeppelin is playing from the stereo — a mixtape Castiel knows.
“Hey,” he says. “I almost forgot. I got you something.” And he reaches out across the gap between them and sets a pristine new cowboy hat on Castiel’s head.
— and Lisa and Ben were fucking incredible, they didn’t deserve any of his shit, but — but now he has it. Kind of. He’s got a home, a real one, and a guy who means the world to share it with him, and Dean can only look. Never touch.
There’s no rhythm to it, no finesse. Just fumbling, overpowering need, and Castiel thrusts into Dean’s throat once, twice, three times — Dean’s vibrating, practically whining for it, grabbing Castiel’s hips to urge them forward — and then they lose their balance and are tumbling, entangled, to the motel room floor.
He takes Castiel through the process of saddling his horse, adjusting the stirrups and cinching down the saddlebags — they’re heavy, though Dean doesn’t comment on their contents — and placing the bridle. Then comes getting
“You know,” says Jack, in a very small voice, “I still don’t understand. There are things I thought — I thought I’d just
Dean’s clattering down the bunkhouse steps the moment he pulls into the yard. He’s in red flannel and the ever-present hat, and under it, he’s grinning. “Day’s half gone. Look who decided to show!”
Juddery adrenaline is racing down Castiel’s limbs; a laugh catches in his own throat. “So long as Michael doesn’t track us — whatever you want,” he manages, but Dean grins at him, and he finds he’s grinning too.
Well. Okay. That solves the problem of what to feed him. Though they might have a new problem if Jack’s also resurrecting fossil fish.
Dean’s not ever gonna pass that offer up, but — well. Cas is playing at something, and Dean doesn’t know what it is.
“Of course, the food was very different then,” he adds, as he opens his menu. “They didn’t have tomatoes.”
Castiel considers the question. Staying pressed to Dean’s chest is a good option, but Dean might want it back, at some point. Mustering his courage, he lifts his head, and levers himself up off Dean’s body. Dean stops him from going further with a gentle touch. His face is still flushed, but calm now, eyes careful on Castiel’s face. He brushes a hand gently over his cheek, and Castiel shivers. Only then does he realize he’s stopped trembling.
“I mean, though.” Cas lifts Dean’s chin so he can turn to look at him, eyes serious, only inches away. “It was wrong no matter what. It was
Castiel has seen this so many times. He’d almost forgotten, from the old times — when he and his brethren used to take over whole armies at once. When he’d glance down the line and watch each human soldier’s face smooth, back straighten, the dreads and discomforts of mortal consciousness slipping away; the way they’d move their arms, too easy, without fear of pain.
For a moment Dean just looks at him. Then he grins and takes a bite of pizza. “So you’re saying — what, I had some kind of magic soul juice, got all over you and turned you into one of the good guys?”
“I wouldn’t stop you. I would go with you.” Castiel adds, scrupulously, “I might need to prevent you from doing anything stupid.”
The simplest solution — as far as Castiel is concerned — is to sit in the Impala’s front seat, invisible. He thinks Dean might not like that, so he doesn’t tell him.
They don’t talk for a while, just sit in silence over the single plate between them, dismantling pancakes, crunching through bacon. Eventually Castiel asks, “You knew her when you were a kid?”
There are other things, too — the conversation they didn’t have in Purgatory. Dean’s prayer. His careful acceptance of Jack. The way he keeps looking at Cas like he’s something breakable — Castiel can
It might be the last thing he has of Cas. The last thing — ever. He almost doesn’t dare reach out and fold the knife closed again — tuck it back in the pocket where it belongs.
There’s another long pause. It stretches onward; the seconds tick by. Then Dean’s voice softly says,
He doesn’t let just anyone drive her. He doesn’t even like it when Sam does, really, though forty changes your perspective on what sacrifices are worth it for your beauty sleep. Teaching Jack was — well, that was special. But Cas —
She glances over at him, and whatever she sees makes her smile. “Not often,” she says. “Every once in a while someone might catch a kick when they’re unlucky, but these boys know how to fall. And the horses won’t go after a rider — bulls will, that’s why we have the bullfighters in to distract them, but the horses just want to buck.”
Sam is up, because of course Sam’s up, getting ready to go for his run. He looks startled when a bleary Dean knocks on his door, then pokes his head in; he’s already got earbuds in his ears. He pulls them out. “Hey, man — what’s up? Did you — sleep?”
He’s not sure he has any right to be sorry for it; and he wouldn’t, he wouldn’t, not for anyone else, not really, but — this is Dean.
Dean watches the other cars they pass as he drives. Semis in orderly convoys and families on their way home from vacation, frazzled parents bent over steering wheels. The occasional lonely drifter, like he used to be, with no one to sit in their passenger seat.
Dean laughs, warm and scratchy. He sounds hazy, a little distant, like he’s too tired for proper incredulity; but he sounds happy. “Okay. Okay — I’ll be there. What’s the address?”
“So,” says Dean, “I’m kinda loitering around trying to figure out a backup plan, and this dude who’s standing out there smoking notices me and he’s like — hey, I can get you in. Leads me around to this back door, and we come in behind the band, and it’s —
“No.” Cas doesn’t elaborate further, but later he shows Dean the bright black-and-yellow bird pecking at the orange halves in the garden. “I heard some earlier. I thought they might like some food.”
to be intact — he and Cas have a separate, modern well for their water — but he figures it’ll look better that way.
“Right,” says Greta. “I need to run, so — let me know if you need anything, or — I’ll swing by tomorrow morning if. If there’s anything you need.”
“We should get one,” Castiel suggests, and Dean says, “Cas, it’s January,” but he’s already pulling into a parking space.
the goose character — Boris — is saying. Jack, sitting with one knee propped up, settles his chin on his hands.
Castiel budges over. He sort of quits staring, or at least he lets his eyelids lower. He turns on his side, though, so he can still see Dean, mere inches away. Dean’s profile, silhouetted against the cracks of light from behind the curtains. Dean’s lips and his nose and the curve of his cheekbone; the bob of his throat. Dean’s chest, rising and falling, deeper as he slips into sleep.
Dean is propped on both arms, leaning back onto the Impala’s hood. When he frees one, the other shakes briefly with the effort of taking his weight.
Dean turns to glance up the hill. Jack is still sitting under the old oak tree, still hunched in on himself, but he’s let Cas approach, at least. They’re sitting a few feet away from each other, Cas looking out serenely across the water. They don’t look like they’re talking. Dean shrugs. “You game to find out?”
There’s not much of the gory details that Cas missed, Dean thinks, when he raised him from hell. Took Dean’s soul in his hands and pieced it back together. It’s not the sort of thing they bring up.
“Stop worrying about being rude,” Dean says, but his tone is short suddenly, abrupt, his face going harder. “I’m really not —”
The rodeo continues. Castiel locks himself firmly into character; makes noises of vague assent when his mother exclaims over the violence of the sport, when his father qualifies that with something about proud Western traditions, the role of athletic competition in a culture’s sense of itself. He tries to give Charlie a smile when she shoots him a tiny, worried glance.
“Okay,” he says. “I get the whole — grieving war widow thing you’ve got going on here, but you smell like four-day-old pizza and sweat. That
A ball of water rises from the sea. It swirls briefly in the air, then rises, and — starts to expand.
He scrambles to get his boxers off, catching them awkwardly for a second on his dick. He drops them off the side of the bed, and feels Cas’s eyes follow them. Then follow his hand back up.
Castiel stops trying to interrupt. He knows enough of Dean’s history to picture it: his mother, gone in flames. His father, cold and hard, ripping his sons from their life — from any semblance of normalcy, of healing.
Castiel waits a long minute in case Dean’s going to say anything more. He’s asked Dean so many questions, so many details, but never the simplest one. “What was he like?”
“I’m facing a — similar problem,” he says finally. “I wish I could offer you the wisdom of experience, but I think perhaps — perhaps you should try telling them anyway.”
don’t need you — smiting my dad or whatever.” If anything, Dean’s smile grows more forced. “Look — you can wait in the car. Or, not the car, he’s gonna wanna see the car, but — I won’t run off or something, I promise. Just let me handle this.”
Castiel turns to face Dustin. He’s taller than the cowboy, if not as burly. “Good game,” he says, extending his hand to shake.
He stops again. Castiel kisses his shoulder, the mark there, the heart of his own palm, and Dean shivers. “Maybe,” he concedes, after a while. Then, with a strain on his voice: “You’d come with me?”
“Hey,” says Castiel, suddenly needing to voice it out loud. “On Grated Coconut. You were — spectacular.”
The menus the waiter hands them are enormous and laminated, spiral-bound, and Dean reads his twice before ordering the breakfast special. Castiel watches where his eyes linger; he asks for the blueberry pancakes and eats one for form’s sake before passing the plate with the other two to Dean.
The words catch Castiel by surprise. They’re quick, and clipped; Dean isn’t meeting his eyes. His shoulders are hunched up, defensive, like he’s waiting for the axe to fall.
They don’t speak for a while after they start to drive. They’ve talked themselves out, Castiel thinks, at least for now, and Dean has his window down, the music turned up loud. The combination creates a river of sound, enough to get lost in, and Castiel realizes after a while that he could roll his window down, too, so he does. That makes Dean shoot him a grin, and so Castiel tries tapping his fingers in time to the music, like Dean does. That feels good too.
They end up fucking against the shower wall, Castiel’s legs wrapped around Dean’s hips and Dean bearing the weight of both of them, rolling into him in long, careful thrusts. It’s a feat of acrobatics Castiel didn’t know either of them were capable of. Water beads on Dean’s eyelashes as he gazes down at Castiel, rapt, his arms bracing them both against the tile.
says Dean, and he’s suddenly on his feet. The look on his face is desolate and furious. “You don’t — do this, okay? You don’t get to do this. I’m not —”
Dean reminds himself. Sometimes he wishes he could remember that from when he was a kid. Not just the things she told him — about watching
“What? Dude, no.” For a moment, Dean sounds like he could be anywhere, shooting the shit with another cowboy over a glass of beer. And Castiel sees all over how frail he looks, how ill at ease, in his hospital gown and IV tube; how small and fragile and remarkable a human body is, even one as full of life as Dean’s. He thinks of Dean’s brother’s hands around his throat, and finds his own are trembling.
“I wanted to see you first.” Cas’s gaze is on Dean’s eyes, then his mouth; Dean kisses him again. “And Henry.”
Dean takes a moment to break the gaze, swinging his leg over his horse as he does. “C’mere,” he says, “I want to show you something.”
A year ago, before Jack died, they started working their way through the Disney canon on movie nights.
man. Can’t ever fall asleep. And when you finally do, they start poking and prodding and taking your vitals all over again — Cas.” He cuts himself off abruptly. His face looks scared, and so fucking young. “I kept thinking, what if I never —”
“Dean,” is the first thing Mia says. Her voice is pleasant, musical, deliberate. “It’s nice to hear from you again.”
He tries to warn Dean when he’s close, but Dean ignores him, sinks down even deeper than before, so Castiel’s cock is nudging the back of his throat, and he makes a strangled noise when Castiel bucks uncontrollably into him, but it’s too late, he’s coming, ears roaring and white filling his vision, and it’s only when he’s recovering, staggering to rest his weight against the shower wall, and Dean is coughing and spitting at his feet, that he looks down and realizes that Dean’s come, too.
He finds that he’s smiling, and there are tears in his eyes. “Hey,” he says, and Dean says, “Hey,” cracked and faint, and there’s a chair at his bedside and Cas is sitting in it, taking Dean’s hand in both of his and kissing it, saying, “Hey,” again, and, “you scared the shit out of me, Dean.”
They trade again in Cheyenne. Dean watches Cas drive and asks, “So is it too soon to start planning that third date?”
The unfairness of it rises up suddenly in his throat, choking him. Dean spent so long feeling like he was supposed to want some apple pie life — like Dad, like Sam. Marry a girl. Settle down. And he
He doesn’t pull his phone out until he reaches the bathroom. Then, he locks the stall door behind him and leans bodily against the wall. The fabric of his jeans scrapes across his knuckles as he reaches into his pocket. He pulls out his phone with trembling hands, and flips it open.
They keep driving. Through towns that seem normal and bustling; past people who aren’t wiping salt from their eyes. They drive for an hour, and then Dean pulls into a motel parking lot in Redwood Falls.
His knee knocks the underside of the table; silverware jingles, and his water slops in its glass. “What do you mean?”
Cas looks thoughtful, but Dean shakes his head. “I mean, that’s — listen. There’s as many kinds of fucked up parent-kid relationships as there are parents and kids. Trust me; you’re gonna go crazy if you start looking for a pattern to give meaning to all that.”
The horse explodes out of it. He lands squarely on his front legs, kicking the rear ones high in the air, and a cloud of dust goes with them as the cowboy flops like a rag doll; then the horse twists, kicking again. Castiel’s gasp is swallowed in the noise of the crowd as Cody Traister slips sideways, still clinging to his single hold but clearly flailing for control. One more buck, and he’s gone, tumbling into the dust, and Castiel sucks in an alarmed breath as the horse’s legs fling out again, but the cowboy rolls low and is up and running, clutching his hat to the head, as a buzzer blares over the arena.
Dean is watching him. There’s a smile on his face. “You’re not real,” Castiel mutters. “There’s simply no way you’re real. This is a — the most vivid dream I’ve ever had, but it can’t possibly be real.”
Its stillness, even on a thirteen-year-old’s face, makes Michael’s smile look nasty. “I could simply imprison you until the time that I need you. I am magnanimous. I am offering you — oh, five years of freedom. Give or take.”
He sees the hesitation register in her eyes. Then she smiles, with dimples — she’s really pretty cute. “What are my options?”
He remembers Cas popping up right behind him at that sink; all up in his personal space. He remembers it feeling weird, another body that close, after days of life-without-Sam. His instincts didn’t know what to do with it. Fight. Get closer. All the way close; turn himself inside out with need.
The first one is that it takes a long time to fall. Castiel has had this thought before; his life as an angel sometimes seems like one long string of fallings. Some are more literal than others — every time an Enochian blood sigil has blasted him through space; every time he’s felt the heartbeat he shouldn’t have stutter and miss a step. Once, a pawn in Metatron’s spell, he fell like this, like a meteor; but even that wasn’t quite the same.
Well. His thoughts are written all over his face. Relief, and love, and worry, still — a kind of worry Castiel can fix.
This is the first time he’s set foot in this motel room. It doesn’t look dissimilar to the last one; dark wallpaper, zealous decor. There’s a painting of dogs playing poker on the wall, a wooden screen painted with aces of hearts and spades separating the two beds from the small kitchenette. It couldn’t be clearer that John’s bed is abandoned — there are no bags beside it. The covers are smoothed into place with military precision.
“Hey,” he says, “Dean Winchester,” and reaches out a hand for the man behind him to shake. He’s older, tall and thin, with gray hair and a pleasantly weathered face; he introduces himself as Thomas, and his wife as Laura. She has a gauzy air that contrasts sharply with the lesbian couple at the next table, Gina and Evangeline, who goes by Evan, and Dean’s getting into his role as ice-breaker when Gina asks, suddenly and not unkindly, “And what’s your name?”
Maybe he does deserve them. Maybe he does deserve — happiness, or something — acceptance. Maybe he deserves all the things that he would wish for Dean, and that he knows Dean wants for him.
It helps, Cas being there, he thinks — when he wakes up in time, he can smooth gentle hands over Dean’s shoulders, his hips, pull him close, and Dean will steady and quiet. Other times, it takes more effort, and Dean doesn’t calm until his eyes fly open, breathing hard. Once, he wakes Castiel up by sitting straight up in bed, in the middle of the night, and declaring, in a deep, sleep-rough voice,
He disturbs the covers as little as possible when he goes back to bed. Slides carefully between the sheets, flat on his back, just far enough that he’s not falling off the edge.
Dean can feel the blush start at the roots of his hair — travel all the way down his body to his toes.
“Thanks, Sammy.” Dean raps his knuckles twice on his brother’s door as he turns away. Embarrassment fights with accomplishment in his chest all the way back down the hall.
Feels like I should put a blanket warning on this chapter for generalized Dean Issues and This Bitch John Winchester (derogatory).
He stops himself. It seems out of line; it’s too early, too much. But Dean opens his eyes, still fragile and hollow, and says, “What?”
“See,” says Sam, “this is why — just because Jack’s superpowered doesn’t mean — look, we need to pay
“That’s okay.” A family with four children passes between Dean and Castiel, giving them odd looks; Dean ignores them. “Are you — are you all right?”
He’s not sure what he ever did to deserve a friend like Charlie. He’s not sure what he ever did to deserve Dean, or any of this, and the emotion rises up to choke him before Dean leans in with coffee breath and kisses him and says, “Hey. Outta your head, remember?”
There’s a pause, when they get through the door, like the moment on the top of a rollercoaster; a caesura, the beat of silence that makes the following clash of sound or adrenalin or poetry sweep you off your feet. Cas sucks in his breath, sharp, and then Dean is stepping into his space, his wrong-footed nervousness of the stairwell forgotten. He’s tangling his fingers with the buttons on Castiel’s shirt, flicking them deftly free — he’s running his palms down Castiel’s chest, raking his nails on skin.
And then he straightens, grinning broadly, and walks backward to the door of the truck cab, watching Castiel try to recover his flustered senses all the way.
Dean shifts in his seat. “I guess I never — I dunno. Sam said something, when Mrs. B first popped up, about like — we’re not really holiday people. And man, it made me think — I tried sometimes when we were kids, I really did, but all I had to go on was what I saw on TV, you know? And everything on TV — it’s a whole different world. Like, it’s perfect. There’s never a bucket of fried chicken or — or Dad sleeping one off on the carpet. So a lot of the time it didn’t feel really worth even trying.”
“He’ll be fine,” says Ellen, implacably. “It’s a simple, closed fracture; the bone will heal normally. He just needs rest and pain management.”
He insists on walking, when they’re at the ranch, sometimes for miles — “gotta keep my strength up, Cas” — but he wears out quickly. They learn to walk in the river valley, where it’s shaded and flat, and there are downed trees to sit on when Dean needs to stop and rest. Only once does Castiel seriously consider going back to the ranch for help, when Dean’s out of breath and light-headed, leaning back against a poplar trunk, not really answering Castiel’s questions about whether he’ll be all right to make the walk home. Only when Castiel’s announcing his intentions loudly, half out of the clearing, do his eyes fly open. “I’m
She must have been here all along, under Michael’s spell. She’s wearing soft cotton in a uniform color, what Dean has told Castiel are called scrubs; she looks confused. “I just — lay down for a nap —”
“I’ll talk to him,” Dean says, forcing a smile. It’ll be easy enough to eventually beg out of whatever rendezvous Thomas and Laura have planned, but: “Give him time. He’ll come around.”
“Easy,” murmurs Dean. “Breathe. Just breathe. Follow mine, okay? Here.” He draws Cas’s hand to his chest. “Breathe in with me, that’s it.”
He’s never done this before. He has absolutely no practice, and no doubt his technique leaves miles to be desired, but Dean’s hips heave and he lets out an inarticulate cry and then: “
He hurries to get his own door open. His jacket catches on the handle, and he nearly stumbles; he grimaces and frees it. “Hey. Dean Winchester. We talked on the phone. This is — Cas, he’s my partner. Hope that’s okay.”
that, in a way. He remembers the night Metatron cast the angels from Heaven; he remembers the sky filled with meteors. “Sort of. He kind of — rose again. He’s down here by choice now, I guess.”
“Yeah, well, there’s bound to be some bumps, okay?” Dean’s saying now. “But the kid deserves a chance to be normal, Sam. Go to school, have friends —”
“I have to go,” he says. He doesn’t wait. Doesn’t look for the confusion on Dean’s face, or the hurt, or the beginnings of protest; doesn’t give Dean a chance to tell him to stay.
Many of Castiel’s brethren would consider it the opposite. He is feeling increasingly alienated from his brethren. “It is,” he answers, and follows Dean inside.
“Hey man, I get it.” Emily glances at the front desk, then tilts her head closer and mutters, conspiratorially, “What’s his name?”
John seems to be regaining his composure as Dean talks. He’s swaying on his feet, though, Castiel notices; there’s the stink of whiskey on his breath.
Castiel follows him to the back of the trailer to unload the horses. Their coats are white and chestnut brown, not unlike Floss, a scheme that Castiel ventures to describe as paint and Dean corrects him to pinto. “Paint’s for breeders,” he clarifies. “Pinto just means a pony that looks like these fine ladies. Isn’t that right, sweetheart?” he adds softly to the one who just lipped his sleeve, and she whickers in agreement.
He’s a little astonished Charlie hasn’t called him on his bullshit. It strikes him, suddenly, that it is deep bullshit indeed.
Cas doesn’t move from the doorway. He doesn’t offer any further instruction. He just watches, eyes hungry, as Dean curls his fingers around his balls; as he takes his dick in his hand again, long, smooth strokes. As Dean shuts his eyes and arches his neck and digs his shoulders into the bed; as he splays his legs wide. Cas watches Dean touch his own ribs, his chest, his throat. Cas watches him take himself apart.
his grace these days is inadequate to both move tremendously heavy objects and keep his body warm. The snow is still falling thick and fast. He probably could have stuck to more navigable highways, anyway, tweaked his transect a little — what are the chances Amara’s lurking deep in these snowbound peaks? But here he is.
He kisses him by the luggage rack and he kisses him into bed, he kisses his temples and his eyelids and the sturdy beat of his heart, he kisses Dean’s hands and his ribs and his mouth again, always his mouth, and Dean makes small, senseless sounds and flutters his hands over Castiel’s back, his thighs, but Castiel stops him when he tries to go for his belt; just kisses him, and keeps kissing him, until Dean relaxes boneless into him and gives up all his fight.
There’s the flash of lightning — the flare of grace. Screaming. The house shaking. Wings burned high on the walls.
But Dean doesn’t let him go. His fingers stay clenched in Castiel’s shirt; his other hand is on Castiel’s hip. He’s breathing unsteadily, tipping his face forward so Castiel can’t see it, and when he speaks, it’s into Castiel’s collarbone. “Sorry, I — Cas, if we keep going like this, I’m gonna — in a few minutes I’m gonna be begging you for a hell of a lot more.”
