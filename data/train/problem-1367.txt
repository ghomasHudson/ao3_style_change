Sherlock walked into the living room, settled in his chair and fed her, telling her the story of a big, mean dog they’d once been trying to find, which had turned out to be just a regular dog. He even told her about the glowing rabbits.
John must have fallen asleep at some point, because the next thing he knew he was being awoken by Sherlock thrashing back and forth on the bed, his eyes still closed. The moonlight was now streaming across the floor and highlighting Sherlock’s face, which looked ghostly white.
He’d always believed that someday...but then Sherlock had been dead, and he’d met Mary, and Mary had been safer in so many ways. Until it turned out she was the most dangerous of all. And now she was gone.
He reached down to bring both their cocks together, and started to thrust upward harder, leaning down to kiss John again.
They broke apart, but not far, resting their foreheads against each other and just panting, inhaling each other’s air.
“Okay?” Sherlock stopped, looking up at him through his eyelashes, eyes hooded, plush lips hovering just over his cock.
Now, though. After waiting so long, after wanting Sherlock so much, he couldn’t contain it anymore, hide it anymore, not even a little bit. So his impulse was to push Sherlock away, not to deal with it, not to acknowledge the way he felt.
Sherlock must have looked like he was going to protest, but all John had to do was raise his eyebrows, and he acquiesced.
When he finally got to his first hundred, he strung them through a piece of clothes line and attached it to the ceiling in his new flat. He lay down on his bed with the window open, and watched the colored cranes dance lightly in the summer breeze.
Sherlock’s eyes opened again, and their gazes met, the force of it hitting John in the solar plexus.
“Three hundred and twenty three,” Chi said before he could finish. “I make about ten per day if I’m feeling well. Less on the days when my head hurts too much and everything goes blurry.”
A mass of exhausted limbs, Sherlock just held on as John thrust hard into him, again and again. John dropped his forehead to Sherlock’s neck, biting down just as he came, and Sherlock moaned again at the feeling of John’s cock pulsing, his come filling him.
John swallowed deeply, gathering himself before he spoke. “I’m not… I’m not leaving again, Sherlock, not unless you want me to. I was a total and complete idiot, for so long, I know, but… you’re it for me, don’t you see? I was about to tell you that first night when you pushed me against the wall and snogged me, so I never got the chance, but… you’re
Feeling slightly confused, John took the jumper he offered, which was a soft, dark blue. “Is this cashmere? I can’t accept this.”
John touched his elbow lightly, trying to reassure him. “So they killed her and then—what, they dumped her body here, trying to make it look like a drowning? But why?”
He slammed the door to Sherlock’s room open, wincing at the noise. They both paused, listening, but there was no noise from upstairs.
Sherlock’s lips, which he’d imagined tasting a thousand times, were as plush as they looked, parting underneath John’s tongue easily. John sipped at his bottom lip, losing himself more second by second.
“I’m right here,” John said, smoothing his hand over Sherlock’s forehead, pushing the sticky curls upward.
John closed his eyes. “I lost someone,” he said, his throat dry. It was true, but it was desaturated language. “
The man’s smile widened impossibly further. “John Watson. I won’t be forgetting that name anytime soon.”
John sat down on his bed, his head in his hands and his stomach in knots. He hadn’t realised until that exact moment that he had actually been hoping that this would work, that it would bring Sherlock back.
“My landlady, Mrs. Hudson.” Sherlock strode into the kitchen, plopping down immediately at the stool in front of his microscope. He took a petri dish and some kind of liquid, putting the swab next to him carefully on the table. He started preparing a slide for the microscope with deft fingers, his motions quick and precise.
John looked back out toward the water, watching Sherlock’s dark head bobbing farther and farther from the shore. Sherlock seemed to be a good swimmer and the current wasn’t fast, but John was still apprehensive. When Sherlock reached the cluster of logs, his head disappeared. Seconds ticked by slowly, until Sherlock finally surfaced again, swimming one-handed toward John, pulling something behind himself.
John ordered them both breakfast–including some food for Sherlock, hoping he could make him eat something–and walked into the bathroom.
Sherlock looked like, for once in his life, he had no idea what to think or say. Instead, he reached up and ran his thumb over John’s bottom lip.
The man looked a bit surprised, but the chuckled after a moment. “What’s your connection to Sherlock Holmes?”
John, who had already eaten half of his, was about to point out that the hot dogs were bloody delicious. When he looked up, however, he saw that Sherlock had a glob of mustard on his upper lip, and the words caught in his throat. Sherlock lowered his gaze and took another bite, a bigger one this time. His plush lips wrapped around the hot dog, his eyelashes fanning out on his cheeks.
At first, it was just closed lips, pressed together, and John couldn’t quite believe what he’d just done. But then, gloriously, beautifully,
“What ever is, with the two of us?” John reached up to cup his cheek, brushing his thumb over Sherlock’s lips. “But it’s worth it. All of it. All the pain, all the years apart…it’s worth it to me. I want to be with you too, so much. Today, tomorrow, fifty years from now. Because you’re the fucking love of my life, actually.”
“I’ll be right back,” John said. Sherlock just closed his eyes again, and concern spiked in John’s chest. Sherlock was obviously very sick; he wasn’t even making any of his normal sarcastic remarks.
The man cocked his head to the side. “And yet you saved his life, spent the night at his flat... and when I threatened him you jumped in this vehicle without a second thought. Should we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
we bumped into each other,” the man said, pulling the collar of his long wool coat up against the winter wind.
John followed him down the walkway, wondering what he’d gotten himself into this time. As per usual, Sherlock had only explained the broad strokes of the case to him, leaving out the details, which was aggravating to say the least. Still, John was tingling with anticipation and excitement at the prospect of a case in a far-off country. He’d been to the states a few times, but never to New England.
"Instead of Chinese and whatever inane programme you were planning on subjecting me to tomorrow night, I would like for us to go out to dinner. Together."
I am hoping that it isn’t a grievous error that the Thames could be cold enough during a cold snap in the winter to give someone hypothermia. I tried to do some research on this but it was a bit unclear, so if it isn’t, just chalk it up to artistic license.
Unable to look at Sherlock for one more second without making some kind of embarrassing declaration, John closed his eyes again.
With a surety he hadn’t known he possessed, John had curled his hands into the lapels of Sherlock’s coat, pushing him back into the door and kissing him deeply. Sherlock had melted into his embrace, and it had felt like something had clicked into place. They’d ended up in bed together, Sherlock begging for all of John, and John giving everything of himself gladly.
“What about the coffee?” Sherlock’s voice was no longer as deep nor as nonchalant as it had been moments before.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, hesitating. That was odd; Sherlock never hesitated, never considered his words before saying them. He just
Once they’d eaten breakfast and gotten dressed, was almost one in the afternoon. The “office” they were looking for, Sherlock informed him, was in a small shop near Park Street T stop, only a short walk from their hotel. They walked along the Common for a bit until they turned down a small street that connected two bigger streets. The crooked alleys that veered off in strange angles reminded him of London, which had also grown during the times before cities were laid out in brick patterns.
Eventually, he heard Rosie fussing on the monitor. He disentangled himself from Sherlock without waking him—a feat, truly—relieved himself, and pulled on his old striped bathrobe before walking quietly up the stairs.
He’d been more afraid of losing Sherlock in that moment than he had Mary. When he’d seen the barrel of a gun pointed at Sherlock...it was like seeing his worst fear realized for the third time.
“Wait, what?” John shook his head to clear it as he stepped backward. It was as if they’d been having a whole conversation that John wasn’t privy to.
Sherlock’s gaze swept down John’s body as he sipped from his glass, and John couldn’t help noticing how his lips were wine-slick, just a bit reddened. He bit his bottom lip, trying not to imagine what it would feel like to sweep his tongue over those lips.
He walked into his bedroom, looking up at the cranes on his ceiling. He tried to ignore the burning feeling in his chest, his lungs, but it started to consume him like a wildfire. He stood up on his bed and ripped two strings of cranes down, taking them into the living room and throwing them in his fireplace. He lit a match, hesitating for a moment before he threw it on top. As he poured himself another scotch, he watched the paper curling under the flames. The scotch wasn’t numbing him enough, and for the first time in his life he wished he had something even stronger.
As they approached, John could see the outline of the body through the legs of the people standing around her.
John could feel Sherlock’s cock getting hard under his fingertips. He continued to stroke it slowly as Sherlock made little sighs and moans into his mouth, and John’s own cock started to get hard in response. He kissed lightly down Sherlock’s neck, nipping at his pulse point, continuing to slide his hand up and down Sherlock’s length at a languid pace.
Sherlock smiled, and his eyes lit up, in that way that meant he had solved it. John’s heart did a little flip-flop, seeing it. “And he’s doing it again this inning.”
Sherlock woke the next morning with the sound of rain against the windows. He lay there, watching the drops streak down for a few minutes, while he held a pillow close to him. It still smelled like John, which was proof that John had been in his bed. Not only that, but John wasn’t going anywhere, and John wanted to be with him. For all intents and purposes, he had never really had sex before, but John was alright with that. Sherlock contemplated these things for a few more minutes, and several things clicked into place all at once. He had to tell John, immediately, because John had to come back to bed.
John growled, pulling him closer, his hands squeezing Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock felt dizzy, his heart was starting to pound in his chest, and John was snogging him as if his life depended on it. His tongue was dipping in and retreating, the he sucked on Sherlock’s lip. It was incredible, how just kissing was making Sherlock feel like he was losing control.
I am trying to stay true to a lot of aspects of English university life (especially how students go through A levels and such, which will be more relevant later), but in terms of the courses John is taking as a first year law student, I'm taking some liberties. Since I'm a 1L in an American university law school, I'm just putting in the kinds of classes I am taking. If there's a huge difference from what first year law students in England learn, please forgive me.
“What about my shoes?” John felt completely exposed, and he didn’t like it. He crossed his arms over his chest.
John blinked once in surprise, watching him warily. So it was a threat, then; Moriarty knew he had been at the pool.
Class finally ended an eternity later, and the girl whose head he’d been staring at smiled at him flirtatiously as he walked out. He managed a curt nod, trying not to flush even more, as he fled the scene.
Mostly because he couldn’t think of an alternative other than running out the door, (which could mean that John might never talk to him again), Sherlock moved his arm from his eyes.
John fell into a routine. He would work his shift at the hospital, and at the end of each shift he would take a new stack of origami paper, grab a couple of sandwiches, and walk to the cancer ward.
As the hours and then days crawled by, John couldn’t decide which was worse: the fact that he hadn’t heard from Sherlock, or that he’d programmed his own number into Sherlock’s phone and Sherlock had ignored it. The fact was, this time, he’d wanted to stay, and Sherlock had practically thrown him out.
John frowned. He’d never told her about Sherlock, and he hadn’t heard anyone say the name in more than a year.
As the door slammed behind him, John let out a huge breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding. He pulled out his phone and dialed Sherlock’s number as he walked out of the classroom. It rang through to voicemail, so John dialed again, but Sherlock didn’t pick up.
Sherlock was silent for a long moment, and John thought he’d fallen asleep. “If your connection to her was that circumstantial, I doubt he targeted her because of you. The motive still eludes me, but I will do my best to bring her murderers to justice, John. Hers and Carl’s. I promise.”
Sherlock huffed. “You went on about how the previous professor suddenly went on sabbatical for at least half an hour the other day. Besides, when it’s something about you, I do care.”
Shaking his head in mock chagrin, Lestrade released John’s hand and lead them toward the riverbank. “Female, early twenties. No phone or ID found on the body, so for now she’s Jane Doe. It appears to be a suicide, and Anderson has already ruled the cause of death to be drowning.”
“This is much better,” John whispered, before bending to kiss Sherlock again. This time, it wasn’t as fevered, or as vicious of a kiss. He kissed Sherlock slowly, his tongue dipping in a rhythm that felt like sex–at least, how Sherlock imagined sex would feel. His barely-there beard was scratching Sherlock’s face, but Sherlock loved it, he wanted
“You would have to transfer, probably to Bart’s,” Sherlock interrupted, untucking his violin from his neck. “You have the necessary A levels, so you would just have to submit your application.”
“Then shut up,” John said. He slid his hands around Sherlock’s waist, just as he had imagined, and before he could lose his nerve, kissed him.
“I…” Sherlock pressed his lips together, looking off-kilter, the way he did when he wasn’t sure what he should do in a particular situation.
Attempting deflection, John snorted. “Because you seem to have some kind of death wish.” It was supposed to be a reprimand, but his voice came out softer than he’d meant it to be.
“I–I don’t…” Sherlock stuttered, unable to finish his sentence because John took the opportunity to tease his nipple with his tongue.
“John.” The tone of this ‘John,’ in comparison with the others, was soft, tender, his mouth curling around the word like a caress.
After a full week, John was unable to justify a further delay. With more dread than he felt when he went to Contracts class, John took the jumper and walked to Sherlock’s flat one night after supper. The lights on the first floor were on, but it was unclear whether anyone was home. He placed the package on the doorstep, lingering there longer than was truly necessary, oscillating as to whether he should knock. Before he could make a decision, however, he heard some violin music filtering down from the top floor. He glanced up at the window, where he could just make out the outline of a tall, lithe figure silhouetted behind the curtains.
John's jaw clenched as he tried not to imagine the amount of pain that would have had to be inflicted to cause those deep gashes. Feeling the raised skin under his fingertips was as painful as if his own flesh had been flayed.
“Why don’t you sit down, Doctor Watson,” she said, picking up a new piece of paper and folding it over delicately to make a triangle.
.” He needed John to fill him, to be part of him, to be inside of him. It was almost a physical ache, deep inside.
He shrugged and stood up to put the kettle on. As he waited for it to boil he looked out the window at the lightening sky. Nothing had changed, yet for some reason, for the first time in over a year, he didn’t hate seeing the sun rise.
But the mistletoe, in their own flat…it was too much. It mocked him, rankled him, made his skin prickle. It was a reminder of what he wanted but couldn’t have.
Sherlock snorted in derision. “I told you, they think Carl died of natural causes and we have no actual proof to the contrary.”
“It’s not… I don’t…” John stuttered, caught off guard. He tucked his chin into his chest as he stuffed his hands in his pockets. He rocked back on his heels, trying to regain composure.
“Mycroft,” Sherlock said, appearing in the doorway to the kitchen, scowling. “What are you doing here?”
“Yes, yes,” John said, sucking at his throat, starting to stroke him faster. Sherlock arched again, and hot come was spurting all over John’s hand as John stroked him through it.
Before John could ask more, the sound of the heavy outer door opening cut him short. As footsteps echoed down the hall, John could hear two men arguing. Their voices sounded oddly familiar. Before John could react, Sherlock grabbed him and pushed him toward an open broom cupboard, closing it behind them as quietly as possible. The interior was rather small, and because of all the cleaning detritus behind them, John was pressed front-to-front directly up against Sherlock.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched. “That’s it? Okay? I was hoping you’d at least favor me with an ‘adequate.’”
Sighing as if it were a huge inconvenience, Sherlock opened his mouth and John placed them on his tongue. He grabbed the glass of water on Sherlock’s bedside and helped him drink.
John bit his lip, trying to decide what to do. He knew empirically that he should ignore the text, go study for the next several hours, then get some sleep for class the next day, like a good student.
“Almost certainly. Your professor must be involved again. But what’s the link? The pattern?” Sherlock said, not bothering to lower his voice.
John squeezed the cheeks of Sherlock’s ass hard, and Sherlock’s eyes fluttered shut as he leaned in to kiss John again, slipping his tongue into his mouth.
“Alright,” John acquiesced, and he thought he saw the corner of Sherlock’s mouth turn upward just a bit, but then it was gone.
He stopped, hovering over John’s cock, which was straining against the fabric of his pants and trousers, and bit his lower lip.
John knew he should feel like one of them, going home to the person he loved, even if it wasn’t exactly how he’d imagined. The problem was he couldn’t stop thinking about the mistletoe. He kept returning to his daydream about Sherlock underneath it, kissing him soundly, his lean body pressed up against John’s. It crowded his thoughts, made the happiness he felt bittersweet.
John didn’t say a word, closing the last few steps between them, pulling his arm back and punching Sherlock in the jaw with all his strength.
“The girl was not far from where the horrible thing fell, but somehow she and her family survived. Many years later, she became very sick.”
“Happy Valentine’s Day, love,” John said, scooting down so their heads were even. His eyes were the deepest blue Sherlock had ever seen them, and his silvery hair was mussed from sleep in an endearingly boyish way. “I didn’t think you’d want to celebrate it.”
Sherlock’s lips quirked upward. “Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection on your phone: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in, but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone, never see a drunk’s without them.”
John swallowed, after the silence had already stretched on too long, trying to muster up a bit of courage.
“Well, not really, but… before Clara, Harry dated an American woman. Virginia was a huge Orioles fan. They used to watch it all the time, so I did pick up some things. Especially the fact that beer and baseball are hopelessly intertwined.”
Sherlock’s breath stuttered and he blinked his eyes open blearily. For a moment, they just looked at each other.
“It’s just… welcome to London?” Laughing so hard he couldn’t quite breathe, John stepped backward, leaning against the wall of the building nearest them.
Sherlock’s long legs must have served him well, however, for he made it to the other building with room to spare.
“Need anything?” he asked, looking around the disaster that was once her kitchen. It appeared like she was cooking for an entire regiment, rather than the handful of people they actually called friends.
“Actually, yes, I can swim. I’ve met my share of sharks, and I’ve not necessarily come out on the bottom in those fights,” he said bitingly.
“Mmm,” John hummed. “You want to have sex with me, and you can orgasm alone. You just don’t know what you like.” He brushed kisses up Sherlock’s jawline. “...
“What,” he said hoarsely. His head was pounding, his throat was parched, and his neck was unbelievably stiff. It took him a moment to realize that he was sitting against his front door. He apparently hadn’t even made it inside his flat the night before, but he couldn’t remember why. His gaze fell on a paper bag next to him, which seemed to contain a mostly empty bottle of something.
John brought one of the chairs from the kitchen into the room, sitting next to Sherlock’s bedside. Sherlock seemed to drop into a doze almost immediately. John brought a book into the room so that he could read as he sat vigil.
John started to lean in, but Sherlock’s fingers pressed into John’s chest just a bit harder, and John stopped.
At one point, Sherlock got in an argument with an eight year old girl (who was wearing an American Flag hat) about whether Paul Revere should be considered an Englishman or an American. The girl argued that he was was born on American soil and was part of the Revolution, and was therefore an American; Sherlock argued that technically had been born an English citizen as Massachusetts was still part of the colonies back then. John had to hide his face with his hand because he was grinning idiotically, dizzy with affection.
In lieu of a response, Sherlock took off his shirt and threw it aside, then leaned down to kiss under John’s jaw, delicate, feather-light brushes of his lips. John sighed, tilting his head back, outlining Sherlock’s shoulder blades with the tips of his fingers, feeling the soft skin there, committing it to memory.
When the tea was ready, he poured himself a cup and walked back out of the kitchen toward the hallway, avoiding the mistletoe altogether.
Occasionally, he woke up in the middle of the night at a noise from the flat below, and he would think it was Sherlock experimenting on something downstairs. Then he would remember.
John swallowed, doing the math in his head. Chi might not have enough time to make them all, if the projected amount of time she had left on the chart was accurate.
Sherlock simply looked up at John with a bone-deep exhaustion. The condensation in the air was beading in his hair in a sort of halo. “I should think that, by now, it should be fairly obvious that I would do anything for you, John,” he said hoarsely.
On Friday nights, sometimes Mrs. Hudson would offer to watch Rosie, and John would order Chinese food. He brought it into the salon, poured a couple fingers of scotch and watched something mindless on the telly. Sherlock would inevitably end up watching with him, with his own glass, pointing out the inaccuracies of the movie and eating far more than he normally would. By the end of those evenings, John would nod off with his head on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock would almost always fall asleep there as well, reveling secretly in the feeling of John's body next to his own. It was like they were dangling on the precipice of something, but neither of them wanted to fall off the edge.
John bit his lip. Getting into bed with a mostly-naked Sherlock while he was mostly-naked himself seemed like a terrible idea for his sanity, if nothing else.
“You let me… I…” He had punched Sherlock over and over again, wrestling him to the floor onto his back. He must have ripped these wounds open anew, and Sherlock hadn’t said anything.
John let his eyes fall shut again, feeling the edges his awareness, beyond the dark chasm behind his eyelids. He was aware of every part of Sherlock’s being, right next to his—so, so close, and yet so far away.
John frowned, thinking. It all seemed so out of character for Mycroft, who rarely did something without expecting something in return.
“During the fourth inning he went to the tenth row, then to the fifteenth row directly after, even though there were people in the intervening rows who wanted hot dogs. And during those rows he gets their change from his left pocket instead of his right, where he has been getting it from the rest of the time.”
Sherlock stiffened immediately. John felt his heart pounding in his ears, waiting. Waiting for Sherlock to finally acknowledge that there was something between them, something that had been buried so deep and had so many scars that even thinking about it was like prodding at a wound that had never quite healed.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but as lips slid upward into a grin. “With pleasure,” he whispered back.
“Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?” As Sherlock had deduced, John had volunteered at Bart’s for a few months one summer, and he’d learned basic first aid while he was there. He’d never had to use it before, but there was a first time for everything.
Without all the colored cranes, it was just the same as all the other rooms in the hospital. Harry’s cajoling had done nothing, and neither had Mr. Hatayama’s pleading. But being in this room made him feel ashamed of giving up, and of the drinking. Everything.
“You heard someone being beaten and you ran down a dark alley toward the sound instead of calling for help.”
They circled around one of the pillars of the bridge toward a group of people who were standing around what had to be the body.
Sighing again, John closed his eyes. “From now on, I’ll let you know when you’re going too far. With me or with other people. Now let me sleep.”
John hadn’t seen Sherlock naked since he’d been back, except when he’d been in the hospital after he’d been shot, but that was only from the waist up.
Sherlock was already a trembling mess by the time John licked two fingers of his fingers and then swallowed Sherlock all the way down. He bottomed out, his eyes watering with the effort, as he circled Sherlock’s hole with his fingers, just barely pressing inward, holding back enough not to overstimulate his already-tired muscle. Sherlock slid his fingers through John’s hair, making small thrusts up into John’s mouth, and John could see it in his face as he started to come. He pulled off again, just teasing the head as he stroked the bottom of Sherlock’s cock with his hand, faster and faster, until Sherlock was coming in long pulses down his throat.
John burst into another fit of giggles, and as he looked up into those eyes that were so complex, and yet so achingly vulnerable, it felt like he’d found something he’d always been searching for, something dangerous and exciting and
With a great effort, John broke the gaze and stepped backward, his heart hammering in his chest. He picked up his bookbag from the floor. “I’d better get going,” he said, attempting to keep his tone light.
Sherlock sighed, starting to focus the microscope. “Pity, we could have split the fee. Think it through next time.”
John set the plates on the table, looking at Sherlock out of the corner of his eye. He was wearing a deep wine-red shirt and a black suit, and his hair was tousled in a way that John now knew was artfully done, not accidental. He looked beautiful. But then, he always did.
As they were looking at the papers, two men, one in the tenth row and one in the fifteenth row, got up and started walking toward the exit, heads bent.
“Hold on a second. You didn’t even know we don’t have a king, but you know about the president-elect of America?” John said incredulously.
But before he could say more, John sunk his mouth down on Sherlock’s cock, engulfing him in wet heat. Sherlock threw his head back, fisting his hands in the sheets. John bobbed slowly up and down on Sherlock’s length as his lubed fingers traced down to his hole, circling around it.
Sherlock sunk his fingernails into John’s back, arching upward into every thrust, kissing back with a tinge of desperation. Through his haze of bliss, John realized Sherlock was kissing him like this was a last kiss, rather than one of the first, and it tugged at something deep inside him.
They were waiting to board the plane at Heathrow less than four hours later, and Sherlock was… well… chipper. There was no other word for it. He had an honest-to-god bounce to his step.
Sherlock looked down at John, his hair glinting in the morning light, and he was smiling up at Sherlock.
,” John swore, fighting against the natural urge to let his eyes slide closed, because he wanted to watch his cock disappearing into that gorgeous mouth.
Sherlock swung his leg off of John and stood up, albeit a bit unsteadily. John took his outstretched hand, stood up and immediately pulled Sherlock into another deep kiss.
John grasped at his hips with one hand, pulling Sherlock’s head down with the other for another scorching kiss as he started to thrust upwards into Sherlock’s cleft.
“Come back to bed.” Sherlock’s voice was a low rumble. He started nuzzling the back of John’s neck, sending tingling sensations down John’s extremities.
They walked down the aisle to a row near the back of the section and sat down in their seats. John looked around the stands at all the people in their Red Sox hats and jerseys. The baseball players themselves were out on the field warming up, but the game hadn’t begun yet.
John didn’t walk through, however. He just stepped closer to Sherlock, his eyes lingering on Sherlock’s throat over his collar.
John fished around blindly until he found the plastic bottle, pulling it out. It was three quarters empty. He raised an eyebrow at Sherlock, who shrugged. John huffed a laugh, seven years’ worth of assumptions flying out the window.
There were criss-crossed white lines up and down his back, dozens of them. There was no mistaking what they were. John hadn’t seen someone being tortured firsthand, but he knew what whip marks looked like.
The taxi screeched to a halt. The driver started yelling obscenities at Sherlock, but Sherlock paid him no mind, running around to open the door to the passenger side.
John felt his brow furrow, but he didn’t protest. He did have something to wish for, but it was impossible. John felt tears pricking his eyes, but he fought them back, blinking quickly.
“Not only that,” Sherlock pressed on, “But you’re abnormally attracted to dangerous situations and people.”
“I still don’t see why you didn’t rig the election against him, surely you could have done that,” Sherlock remarked.
With a surge of energy, John sat up, swinging his legs off the bed. He pulled Sherlock up to standing, taking him by the hand and tugging him down the stairs with purpose, almost tripping over his own feet in his haste.
John scratched the two-day stubble under his jaw which was… distracting. “And you want me to try and get your brain to turn off so you can enjoy sex?”
“I’m here,” John said. He needed to get closer. He rolled over until he was half on top of Sherlock. God, it felt good, it felt amazing… like jumping into a cold lake on a hot summer’s afternoon, like the taste of a snowflake on his tongue, like listening to a lone violin’s melody. He was home. There was nothing else to it.
“Very peculiar,” Sherlock said in a bored voice that meant he was no longer listening. “I’ll be on the next plane.”
The man caught up with him easily, probably due to his ridiculously long legs. “Ah yes, of course, first year law student, trying to get through briefing the cases for your Criminal Law class. You are on a full scholarship, but you need to keep your grades up to a certain level in order to keep it.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Mrs. Hudson was talking about how we need a more festive atmosphere for the party. I assume she put it up.”
The next few innings went by quickly, especially since John had to go to the loo, and the seventh inning was interrupted by a “stretch,” which consisted of the fans standing up to sing some ridiculous song. Sherlock didn’t stand, looking around at all the fans with something akin to incredulous distaste.
John smiled, a rare smile, and pulled him down by the collar for another lingering kiss. He leaned back fractionally to whisper against Sherlock’s lips. “Now, you take me to bed, Sherlock Holmes.”
The man from the pool seemed to be abnormally skilled at covering his tracks, and he had disappeared without a trace. All they had to go on was a first name, “Jim,” which may have been a pseudonym anyway. After searching fruitlessly for two weeks, Sherlock had settled into a dark mood, which in turn put a dark cloud over Baker Street.
“I can’t stay long,” Mycroft added. “Pressing affairs of state. The president-elect of America is about to announce his chief of staff, who is definitely being paid off by Putin. They aren’t even trying to hide it. This, of course, after his first three picks, who were far worse, turned him down. The man is like a plague.”
John lowered his hand. “Of course, of course I’ll come,” John said, grabbing his coat and keys and shutting the door behind himself.
Sherlock shifted slightly, and John bit his bottom lip, his heart starting to beat faster. Sherlock groaned, cracking one eye open and meeting John’s gaze.
Chi's eyes didn’t hold the gaze most people looked at him with. Instead, she looked at him with understanding. It was the kind of understanding that only the dead and dying have for one another. He was a dead man walking, and Chi knew it.
John moaned, hands fisting into the bedclothes, his body starting to shake. Sherlock pulled down the waistband with one finger so that he could lick the head of John’s cock, teasing at the frenulum. John gasped, the entire world narrowing down to Sherlock’s hot, exquisite mouth wrapped around him.
“Thank you.” John reached down to cup Sherlock’s face with one hand. “What’s wrong? Did you want me to do something differently–”
They’d had this same argument over and over again, and John would never stop torturing himself over things he’d had no control over. Wanting to stop the words from leaving John’s mouth, and the emotion behind them, Sherlock leaned in to capture John’s mouth with his own.
It felt as though he were becoming unspooled, like someone had started pulling the thread of his being and he was unraveling. Flashes, memories, paraded in front of him one by one.
Sherlock shrugged. “The royal family of England has no effect on the world one way or another. Unfortunately,
John looked up in slight disbelief for a moment, then shook his head and started climbing up the ladder after him. By the time he’d made it halfway up, Sherlock was already disappearing over the ledge in a swish of his coat.
John took a few jumpers from Baker Street and moved back into the same bedsit he’d lived in before he’d met Sherlock. He didn’t take any furniture, and he never went back to 221B after.
“Hold still.” John moved half a step closer, reaching up to pick the fluff off Sherlock’s shirt. His fingers brushed the smooth skin on Sherlock’s throat as he did so, which sent a thrill down his spine.
John woke before dawn the next morning with their limbs entangled, Sherlock’s head resting on his chest.
He got up, putting the piece of paper in his pocket. He slid on his old black jacket and strode from the flat.
“And I hoped… it’s a case, like old times, but also getting away from everything, where we could escape all the memories. Erm. Not that you
Everything about the night around him seemed to fade away into the background. He felt frozen on the step, the darkness thickening around him, and the only thing he could hear was the single violin.
“Fine, but text me later, alright? I’m putting my number in your phone.” He snatched Sherlock’s mobile off the table and programmed his name and number in. Sherlock didn’t move or otherwise respond, so John picked up his bookbag and strode out with what little dignity he could muster.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “It’s not a difficult deduction. How did it happen? Did his liver give out?”
This went on for what felt like an age, John rubbing their cocks together and nipping and sucking along Sherlock’s neck. It was torturous pleasure, and Sherlock was getting dizzy again.
He kissed down Sherlock’s chest until he could tease Sherlock’s nipple with his tongue, and Sherlock’s fingers raked down John’s back.  John tongued the other nipple until it got hard, teasing the head of Sherlock’s cock with his thumb.
John ached to pick her up and just breathe her in, but rule number one was never to wake a sleeping baby, and he knew he’d regret it.
“No,” Sherlock interrupted. “No, I… want to. I just… I had given up hope. That I could have that with you. I didn’t…” he cut himself off, pressing his lips to John’s again, and John could feel his yearning through his kiss.
“We don’t even know each other. I just met you ten minutes ago, and now you want me to move in with you?”
John’s stomach clenched. Shock surged through him, then anger followed close on its coattails, then grief so deep that it felt like his head was being split in half. Suddenly he was in the parking lot of Bart’s all over again, watching Sherlock fall to his death, seeing the glassy, deadened look in his eyes. Pale skin stained with blood, and no pulse in his wrist.
John sighed into it, sealing their words with the promise of more. He slid his hand around Sherlock’s back under his robe, teasing at the waistband of his pyjamas with his finger tips.
John cleared his throat again. “Will you show me how to make those?” John said, gesturing toward the sheets of paper. “I’ll help you.”
“Did I get it all right?” Sherlock asked, over-emphasizing the “t” at the end of the last word as he unlocked the door and pushed it open.
“Not like that,” Sherlock said, sipping from John’s lips again. “I just mean. I feel so much it’s like I can’t contain it. I…” he swallowed. “I’m not...used to this.”
“Mycroft said this was the only room left on this short notice,” Sherlock said, not looking up from his phone.
get a flatmate?” She looked back at John. “What, did he follow you home?” she cocked her head toward Sherlock.
John rolled his eyes, but said nothing. They lay there for a few more minutes, listening to the sound of the rain outside.
, John thought. That had not been the way he’d meant to say it. He was used to hearing it in his own thoughts, but he hadn’t meant to actually
Sherlock nodded, and then John’s body was gone, but Sherlock barely had time to register the loss before John was back. John quickly divested himself of his sleeping shirt, and was now only in his boxers. He pushed Sherlock down onto his back, settling himself between Sherlock’s legs, and Sherlock heard the click of a bottle. Sherlock closed his eyes, arching his head backward.
“John.” He said it in the same exact tone he’d used downstairs—the one that made John’s heart squeeze in his chest.
John sighed, rubbing his eyes with one hand. He had put up so many carefully constructed barriers, had divided his life up into so many tiny pieces and put them all in boxes and stuffed them far back in his mind, that he hardly remembered anything anymore. This one little girl was ripping all of his wounds open again, but instead of running in the opposite direction, he stayed and let it happen.
John poked his head out of the kitchen to look over at Sherlock, his curly head bent over something on the living room table and his expression one of intense concentration.
Sherlock wrapped his limbs around John, kissing him back. It wasn’t long before he was arching up into John’s hand, his fingernails digging into John’s skin.
John watched him for a moment, trying to make sense of what Sherlock had been saying, and finally he realized: Sherlock had tried to take him on a
“I know, I know, it’s just, Moriarty, he knew I’m involved. You don’t think he—it was because of me that he targeted her, do you?”
Sherlock nearly collapsed, torn between bucking into John’s mouth and thrusting into his hand. He was overwhelmed by sensation, his entire body was shaking, he was crying out into the pillow.
“Are you sure?” John asked. Because there was no going back from this. There was no way he could ever go back to not kissing Sherlock once he started.
“Happy Christmas!” Molly’s singsong voice broke the spell. Lestrade walked into the room with her, carrying two bottles of wine.
Sherlock slowly turned his head back to look at John, who sat on the side of the bed, and held Sherlock’s face with both hands.
He had also never been superstitious. When he broke a mirror, he simply swept it up. When he spilled salt, he didn’t toss any over his shoulder.
They stared at each other for a moment, and Sherlock’s mouth twitched upward as he moved forward, stepping between John’s legs. He reached out to trace John’s bottom lip with just the tip of his finger, his eyes glowing in the slight city light from the window.
John took the long way home from the shops, walking through Regent’s park in the dusk. It was late September, one of his favorite times of year. Even though the weather in London wasn’t that variable from season to season, the air had a feeling of change to it, and he felt alive and energized.
In a haze of adrenalin and hope, John walked forward until he was under the light of the same street lamp, close enough to see the outlines of Sherlock’s face.
“Which is it?” Sherlock said, his voice reaching a lower register. John realized was having trouble breathing.
Sherlock’s curly head popped over the railing of the stairwell. “Shhh,” he chastised. “I just got her to sleep.”
John stopped abruptly, squinting his eyes as he looked down the dark alley. He heard two distinct voices, slightly dampened by the high walls around them.
He gathered up his books and notes and started to leave. There was no hope for it; he would just have to finish studying in his room.
Sherlock pulled the back door open quickly, but the taxi didn’t hold the burly-looking man from the alley. Instead, it was a middle-aged man who looked utterly confused.
“No, I,” Sherlock cleared his throat, leaning back a bit so that he could see John's face. “I usually only care about this day because there’s always a lot of murders. Jilted lovers, envious ex-mistresses,
There was a little girl tucked in the sheets of the bed. Her head was covered with white bandages, and her skin almost completely faded into the white smock she was wearing.
“Ahhh.” Sherlock arched upward, curling all his limbs around John. It was truly incomparable, the feeling of being filled with John. It would never be enough, he’d always want more.
“Shit!” John cursed, dropping his phone. He grabbed the now-scalding material and quickly pulled it away from his chest. “Oi, watch where you’re going!”
Sherlock’s head was turned slightly toward the window, his long neck was stretched out. John felt his tongue dart out to lick his lower lip, wondering what it would be like to kiss the delicate skin there. Sherlock’s hair was beautifully tousled as ever, but he’d ruffled it before he’d settled into his seat, making him look younger, more boyish. His long eyelashes were fluttering against the pale skin of his cheeks, and he was just so… effortlessly beautiful.
He heard John pour lube on his fingers, and he held the base of Sherlock’s cock with the other. Then he paused. “Sherlock, look at me.”
“I might not be very good at this,” Sherlock said, his eyes glinting in the low light. “It’s been quite a while.”
“Um… okay.” John busied himself by plumping up Sherlock’s pillows a bit, helping him sit up against the headboard.
He didn’t blame Sherlock for it, not anymore, and yet he’d chosen to bring it up, twist the knife. He’d broken the delicate balance they’d struck for so long.
He turned over, and was immediately greeted with the sight of John’s relaxed face, his blond eyelashes fluttering over his cheeks. Sherlock watched him for a few minutes, enjoying the rare peacefulness that never lasted for them. Eventually, trying not to wake John, he carefully slid down the bed so that he could nestle his head under John’s chin, sliding his arm over John’s waist. He tangled their feet together for good measure.
“Jesus,” John muttered under his breath. He was standing in front of the UCL aquatic center, which he’d seen on the news several times that week.
He gave John a DVD that he and Sherlock had made for John’s birthday one year. John tried to seem lighthearted, making jokes, but all he could concentrate on was the feeling of the plastic case under his fingers.
“You being gone...I was untethered. I never expected to,” he made a nose of frustration. “I don’t get attached to people.” Sherlock’s gaze lowered, his eyelashes fanning over his cheeks.
They did this somewhat often, especially in the middle of the night, when Rosie woke up. Sherlock was often up anyway, so he always came up and helped soothe her back to sleep, telling her a story—usually a gruesome murder—though it was probably was just the sound of his voice that lulled her into slumber.
Sherlock probably wailed embarrassingly loudly as he spilled over into John’s hand, but he couldn’t find the will to care. John held him through it, kissing him deeply until his cock was spent.
John trudged up the steps to the law library, hunching his shoulders against the drizzling rain. He’d been able to catch the coffee cart right before they had packed up for the night, ordering the strongest drink they would give him. It had been an extravagant purchase—more than he could really afford to spend—but it was going to be a long night and he needed the caffeine. He thought tiredly for the umpteenth time that he really needed to get a flatmate. Rent was slowly eating up his savings, and soon there wouldn’t be any left.
Sherlock’s mouth twisted as he took his hands out of his pockets and rested them on the cool stone of the bridge balustrade, drumming his fingers a bit.
“If we have the trainers, we can prove—” Sherlock froze, his eyes focusing on a taxi about a block ahead of them.  “Of course!"
“Good morning my darling,” John cooed, kissing the top of her head. “Are you hungry? Papa is starving.”
He squeezed the lube into his hand, and leaned down to stroke their cocks at the same time, coating them both. Then he held them together as he started thrusting. Sherlock moaned loudly, wrapping his legs around John’s hips, his thin body holding surprising power.
He watched as the John’s cock slid against between his legs, over and over, and John’s body was pressing him downward. John was biting his shoulder blade, twisting and pulling Sherlock’s cock at the same time with one hand.
“There’s nothing else of use here,” he declared, stalking back out toward the street, and John followed at a trot.
Mr. Hatayama nodded at John, and they both emptied box after box of cranes on top of the casket. There were nine hundred and forty-three.
He was vaguely aware that John was rubbing against his hip until he came too, a couple of minutes later, shouting Sherlock’s name, and then he was in a daze as John cleaned him up.
The story of their lives had always been about emptiness. The empty space between their bodies, which John had wanted to close so many times, to just...give in,
John broke off the kiss, his eyes widening as he pulled back. “Shit,” he cursed, his breath ragged. His lips were pink from the snogging, and his eyes were much darker than usual, trained intensely on Sherlock. He was still holding Sherlock up, which was good, as Sherlock’s whole frame was trembling and his legs seemed to be made of gelatin. The warmth that had started in his chest had now spread to his entire body, more concentrated in particular areas than in others. The sensation was so strong that he couldn’t really breathe.
Sherlock opened the cabinets, frowning as he realized that there were no clean tea cups; most of them were currently on the table. John’s mouth twitched upward into a smile.
John had moved back into his room upstairs with Rosie, and everything fell back into a predictable pattern. Cases, John, Rosie, cases. Sherlock felt more content, more whole, than he had in years. If he was being honest with himself, what he was feeling was happiness; a happiness he hadn't known since before the Fall.
Sherlock stood up abruptly, slipping the magnifying glass into his pocket as he strode away. “Come along, John,” he said, over his shoulder.
The man didn’t even look up, still typing furiously on his phone as he held up a finger on his free hand.
As they walked out of the park, Sherlock had a spring in his step, and his good mood and energy were infectious. When he suggested that they walk back to the hotel instead of taking a cab or Uber, John readily agreed.
John trudged quietly up to their flat, his joints creaking a bit as he walked up the last few steps—when had he gotten so old?—and hung his coat on its hook.
“Let me know when you’re done, I’ll help you out. I’ll go change your sheets,” he said, standing up.
Sherlock must have gotten up to check on Rosie in the night, because the baby monitor was on the bedside table, but there were no sounds coming from it.
John ached, for the thousandth time in his life, to cross over and run his hand through those messy curls, to tuck his nose into the back of Sherlock’s neck and just inhale, the way he did with Rosie when he needed to ground himself, to make himself feel like he was back home.
Sherlock was completely, totally naked, and John–who was clothed only in his pants–was currently sprawled on top of him, snogging him deeply.
“Good.” Looking pleased, Sherlock left the kettle to boil and strode down the hall towards a bedroom. “I’ll get you a jumper.”
He hurried from the law building, starting to type out a text as quickly as possible, but just as he exited the main door he almost ran into Sherlock himself.
, even for only two nights–with a living room, a fireplace, floor to ceiling windows on one side… and a California king-sized bed.
Just as John thought he’d forgotten him, Sherlock’s curly head popped out over the ledge. “John, come on!” his head disappeared again, and John climbed the rest of the way as quickly as he could.
Sherlock was in the kitchen, his back to the entrance, carefully meting out tea leaves into the teapot. John leaned his head against the doorframe, as he often did, and watched. Sherlock’s eyelashes lowered as he poured the hot water into the teapot, his sinewy arms flexing beneath the bathrobe. It was so blessedly boring in its normality, Sherlock making tea.
John had essentially resigned himself to having “everything but”— that is, everything he would want in a relationship, other than kissing and sex. In every other way, Sherlock was his partner. He had come so close to losing him three different times that he was afraid to ask for more. He’d watched Sherlock die, he’d married someone else, he'd watched him march off to certain death. The thought of not having Sherlock in his life made him ache deep down, like the chasm of grief he’d felt after Sherlock had jumped. That fear was illogical, he knew, yet he couldn’t risk losing Sherlock again.
John knew his cue; that meant Sherlock didn’t want to talk anymore for a while. “I’m just… I’m going to take a shower.”
“And then there’s your brother. You don’t have a passion for law, obviously.” John looked daggers at him, but the man pressed on as if oblivious. “It’s the middle of your first year and you are already suffering, but not just from studying. You clearly want to be doing something else. Your bookbag has all the telltale signs of someone who studied for medical A levels—hydrochloric acid stain on the strap, most likely from advanced chemistry coursework. You also have a patch from Emergency Medical Services at St. Bart’s on the side, the kind they give to volunteers. The only reason why you would choose law over medicine, as they are both noble and profitable professions, is most likely due to familial pressure. Put two and two together with your obstreperous sibling’s drinking, and there you have it.”
The girl stared at him for a long moment. “Considering I’m the one who’s dying, you seem a lot more depressed than I am,” the girl said bluntly, not answering his question. “Who died?”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow questioningly. John shook his head, breaking the gaze. ”Never mind. Let’s go.” He walked past Sherlock and started down the stairs.
Seeing Sherlock on the screen, smaller yet larger than life, talking, was almost more than he could bear. But he also couldn’t get enough. Sherlock was dead, but not dead; he was alive on the screen and in memory, but he was only a phantom. John drank more, watching Sherlock awkwardly speak to Greg off-screen.
Sherlock stayed stiff for a long moment, his arms at his sides. Then, slowly, he raised them to encircle John’s body. They stayed like that for a long time, neither of them moving, or saying anything.
Lestrade went right over to Sherlock and gave him a hug. “Happy Christmas, Sherlock.” He shook John’s hand. “John.”
He contemplated briefly that he should extricate himself from Sherlock’s grasp and go make some tea, but for now it was too pleasant to be in this position. It was a stolen season, though.
Chi’s face cracked into a little grin. “I do have an internet connection on my phone, you know,” she said.
He felt the air in his lungs rush out as he read what it said: the girl had a brain tumor. She had been through two prior operations, and chemotherapy seemed to have been ineffective. She was already stage four, and mets had been found in her liver. Even though she was ten years old, she looked much younger. The cancer treatments must have stunted her growth.
It wasn’t until two days later that they tried again, mostly because they were called in to solve a murder of a priest who was involved in an underground prostitution ring, and they were up for a full day and a half. When they finally got home, they had both showered and collapsed into bed–Sherlock’s bed, by some unspoken agreement, which was fine with Sherlock.
When he’d learned that Mary had been Moriarty’s second all along, and that the baby hadn’t been his… he had expected to feel grief, or soul-crushing guilt. Instead he’d been consumed by the anger he felt toward Mary for her deception, and toward himself for falling for it. It wasn’t until long after it all, after several months, that he’d felt relief.
“And a happy new year,” John joked, and then he rolled over to settle between Sherlock’s legs, their cocks sliding against each other.
Sherlock didn’t speak. After a moment, he turned toward John on the bed, their bodies so close that John could feel his warmth, but they weren’t quite touching.
“There’s nothing wrong with me,” Sherlock said, but it was without his normal snark. He sneezed, which turned into a hacking cough.
“What do you think?” Sherlock walked directly over to the sink and filled the kettle, setting it on the stove. Now that he had removed his coat, John could see that he was dressed in a white button-down and black slacks, which revealed his lean body underneath. John watched him move about the kitchen, his eyes lingering on the dark mess of curls, which contrasted with his pale skin. Put together with his unusual eyes, in a word, Sherlock was…well,
“Here,” a familiar voice responded. John walked down the long room until he found Sherlock. He was wearing nitrile gloves and peering into a locker, which appeared to have once been completely taped off by the police.
Sherlock didn’t turn, waving him off with one hand as he continued speaking. “So you haven’t been paid in how long?” he asked the man on the screen, scribbling on a note pad.
“We are–I’m just going home–” one of them said, starting to sidle toward the exit, but John stopped him again with a glare.
While John puttered around, Sherlock’s still-functioning eye followed his every move with the same intense gaze as he’d been subjected to that first night. It felt as though he were being x-rayed.
“Happy Valentine’s,” Sherlock said, feeling himself flush slightly as he said the words. He could feel John smiling even though he couldn’t see it.
Sherlock knew every single thing about him, he always had. He had to know this too. So why hadn’t he ever acknowledged it, or even poked at it? His favorite pastime was to flay people open, show their greatest flaws.
For hours on end, he and Chi would fold cranes and talk about anything from the countries he had visited (leaving out the gorier aspects of why he had been there) to her favorite math teacher. He was still slow, (triangle, triangle, kite, long triangle, wings, head, repeat), but there was something meditative about making the tiny paper birds.
Sherlock waved his hand in a dismissive gesture. “Take it. Its previous owner wants nothing to do with it—or me—as of last week. It’s yours.”
John chuckled, handing him one of the metal bottles. “Live a little. One beer isn’t going to make it hard for you to catch… whatever it is you’re trying to see. Besides, it’s baseball. Beer is practically required.”
“I hear there’s a lot of history in this area. Some kind of Path of Liberty, or something. I believe there’s even some kind of massacre involved.”
When they arrived at their destination, Sherlock jumped out of the cab—leaving John to pay— and pulled some nitrile gloves from his pocket. He handed a pair to John and pulled on his own as he strode forward, his coat billowing behind him. As they walked, John took in the scene in front of him. They were on the edge of a nondescript bridge on the banks of the Thames, and several Scotland Yard cars were parked with their lights flashing. A few cops in uniform and some people in forensics suits were standing about chatting.
“I had a dream that you said…” Sherlock said thickly, as if his mouth was dry. He paused, swallowing.
John settled in, working on a write-up of a minor case they had solved a couple of weeks before. After they took off and he’d made some headway, he glanced over at Sherlock, who appeared to be dozing. Since no one else was in their row, John let himself look his fill.
Sherlock closed his eyes again. “John, you have an oral argument this morning which you still have to finish preparing for. You should go.”
Sherlock shrugged again. “It’s possible that she’s hoping Molly and Greg will finally have the nerve to…you know.”
Sherlock sighed, settling into the warm water, while John grabbed a washcloth and some soap. He sat on the side of the tub, soaping the cloth, but when he saw Sherlock’s back, he froze.
“It will help,” John said. “Your body is weak, it’s fighting a battle internally right now. It needs some sustenance.”
When John got back into the flat, it appeared as though Sherlock hadn't moved. Rolling his eyes, John headed into the loo and turned on the shower. He took a little more time getting ready than usual, shaving closely, putting on aftershave and a little product in his hair. He went upstairs and put on the jeans that Sherlock had made him wear once to “distract” a bartender at a gay club for a case, and had been sitting in the back of his closet ever since. He also pulled on is nicest white button down, with a dark green jumper over it.
He let his hips shift into it, fucking upward gently as Sherlock came down. It had been so long since he’d had another man doing this, he forgot how good it could be. It obviously wasn’t Sherlock’s first time, and John was already embarrassingly close to coming.
“John Watson,” John said, holding out his hand. “I’m studying at the School of Laws at UCL. I’m particularly interested in criminal law, so if you wouldn’t mind my being here, I think I could learn something.”
John watched him for a moment before he went on. “It doesn’t matter to me whatsoever how much experience you’ve had. The reason I was asking all of these questions was because I want to make sure that you want to do this, and that it’s not physically or emotionally painful for you. I… I have wanted to do this–be with you–for
“Good morning to you too,” John said, grinning so widely that his face almost hurt. He kissed Sherlock again, just for good measure, then kissed down Sherlock’s throat.
Sherlock took his hand, and John helped him up, then pulled him into a hug. He fisted his hands into the back of Sherlock’s coat.
He got up, walking out of the room, checking his watch. The paper store would still be open if he left now.
“It might take some getting used to, for both of us, but…” John trailed off, licking his lips. “That’s something I’m willing to do, with you."
John bit his bottom lip, releasing it again. “Do you…” The question, unfinished, hung between them. It had been suspended in the air for the entire time they’d known each other, hovering like a glittering mirage on the horizon.
His life felt like a nightmare from which he would never wake. A year passed, but he wouldn’t be able to recall what had happened if someone had asked. The colour had been drained from everything—the danger, the laughter, the promise of a future. It all had died along with Sherlock. He lived day to day, wondering sometimes if he would have the courage to kiss his gun and find out if there really was an afterlife. He didn’t really believe in heaven or hell, but at least he’d either be with Sherlock again, or he’d be nothing.
John was reaching into his bookbag for his mobile when someone tall bumped into him, spilling the quadruple espresso all over his jumper.
“I just need to check something,” Sherlock said cheerfully, and dug a hand in Larry’s left pocket, where there were several papers.
The next night, John spent a bit longer than usual in the shower and he had obviously shaved as well. He came down in his good jeans, a dry cleaned shirt and jacket—his date night outfit. Sherlock was in the salon, shrugging on his jacket, and he froze, looking at John.
John looked at the jumper, then up at Sherlock. A man had left clothes at Sherlock’s flat, but he wasn’t really his roommate.
John went back into the kitchen and ladled some soup into one of the only clean mugs they had left, taking it back into the room.
“She wanted you to have it,” Mr. Hatayama continued. He put the crane on the bar next to John’s hand. “She told me—that last day, before she—” he broke off, his voice wavering.
Realization dawned. Sherlock wouldn’t ask for more than what they had, because he was afraid. He was afraid John would leave again, that this room would be empty again. Emptiness was the thing they both feared the most; an empty needle, an empty bottle waited for them, always. Empty bedsit. Empty hearse, empty grave.
After about ten minutes, Sherlock spoke again, as if they had been having a conversation the whole time. “You still have a passport, don’t you? Mycroft can get you one pretty quickly, if not, but it would be better if yours were still valid.”
“I didn’t even realize I was doing it. You have to understand, John. My brain is like a rocket trapped on the launchpad, constantly straining for challenge, and with the murderer still missing...” he trailed off, biting his lip again. John wanted nothing more than to taste that lip, to feel it between his own teeth.
The burly man continued to stare John down, but he stepped back. “Tell the fairy he’d better lay off, or it’ll be worse next time."
As her father drove the car away, Chi pressed the palm of her hand to the window. John waved, trying to fight off the feeling of dread deep in his stomach.
Unable to form words, Sherlock just nodded. John smiled, but it wasn’t his normal smile; it was a predatory one, which made Sherlock feel hot all over. John tugged him toward Sherlock’s room one-handed, and Sherlock shuffled after him, feeling extremely uncoordinated.
Finally, some of you might remember that John originally thought Moriarty was a student. I decided to change that detail for plot purposes. Sorry for the confusion.
Once Sherlock collapsed back onto the bed, panting, eyes half closed, John thrust into his fist a few more times, and then he was coming too, biting down on the crook of Sherlock’s neck, his vision whiting out with the force of it.
Sherlock blinked at him, and then he nodded. The simplest gesture, with a world of meaning behind it.
John glanced over at Sherlock, who hadn’t acknowledged his presence, and his eyes caught on a small object hanging from the beam that separated the kitchen from the salon.
Sherlock kept at it, picking up the pace, stroking the base of his cock with one hand at the same time.
The seconds stretched out, John’s heart beating so hard that he could feel it in his ears. The only sound was the distant wail of a siren in the distance. They lay in silence for a solid minute before Sherlock spoke again.
“I insist.” The greenish-grey eyes were boring into him again, and John felt momentarily like the air had been sucked out of his lungs.
The lock had already been picked, so John walked quickly down the hallway, glancing furtively around him as he went. He opened the door leading to the locker room and peeked in. There were no signs of life.
Chi was released from the hospital under home care as the leaves began to fall. John helped her father carefully pack her cranes in boxes and put them in the backseat of their car.
The wine, the light from the Chinese lanterns, and the high from solving a case bathed everything in rosiness, and for the first time in a long time he’d forgotten about Mary and her betrayal. They had stayed until the waiter had started giving them the side-eye. After swaying their way back to the flat, Sherlock had closed the door behind them, and had turned back to lean against it. Both of them had stared at each other for a long time, until Sherlock had stepped forward and cupped John’s face, leaning down to kiss him with a forcefulness that John hadn’t expected. But then Sherlock had leaned back, his eyes wide, as if he couldn’t quite believe what he had just done.
John glanced up and down the street, but there was no one in sight. He didn’t actually believe that Sherlock’s life was in danger, yet he couldn’t bring himself to take the chance.
… I do.” Sherlock said it with an air of finality, though it was not really all he wanted to say, but at the same time it was exactly what he wanted to say.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, his tone clipped. He didn’t offer any further information, reopening his computer and starting to type furiously.
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, his eyes glistening, and he stepped forward, backing John into the sink for a deeper, more passionate kiss.
. John was willing to take whatever Sherlock would give him, even if that meant maintaining the status quo.
—John had begun to say, flare of rage overtaking him, before stopping himself, flexing his bad hand.
John, on the other hand, was a romantic through and through. Despite the fact that they had become a couple in the early fall, John had decided that the day that they had met was their “true” anniversary. On January 29th he had filled the lab in St. Bart’s with candles, and he’d brought takeout from their favorite Chinese restaurant. Later, he’d “given” Sherlock a corpse who had died of a mysterious illness as an anniversary gift (it had really been a murder by the ex-wife, of course). Then he’d proceeded to shag Sherlock senseless when they’d come home. It had been… acceptable.
John leaned back, lubing up his cock with one hand and then positioning himself. “I know what you need,” he said. He pushed in, hard, just like Sherlock wanted.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “About how Carl died,” he said, as if they had been having a full conversation about this and John hadn’t been able to keep up.
Sherlock glanced up briefly, then back down at the newspaper clipping he was holding. “Oh. It just sort of…happened.”
Sherlock bobbed a few times, twisting his hand a bit on the downstroke. He teased the head with his tongue, then took John's cock all the way down his throat until he almost choked, then bobbed some more.
“One person, one time. Hands. In the chemical lab. Friend from uni. Never wanted to after, or since. Until now. Until you.” Sherlock said it all in a clinical, clipped tone.
Moriarty snapped his briefcase shut. “Tell your friend I know what he’s doing. Also, if he wants to keep his pet, he’ll stop baiting the sharks.”
Sherlock’s expression was one of faint hope and tight anxiety, his hands stuffed in his pockets. Otherwise, he looked just as he always had, right down to the tailored suit under his Belstaff.
“Ahh,” Sherlock breathed, arching backward. John thumbed the head of his cock, and Sherlock clung to his night shirt, trying to remember to breathe.
Sherlock couldn’t help it, he turned over to look at John, who was looking at the wall with a blank expression on his face.
“Well, I guess that’s it then,” John panted, but Sherlock simply backed up, then ran full stop toward the ledge.
The voices got louder as the men approached, and soon they were on the deck of the pool, echoing off the walls.
It had been so long. All they had been through, all the loss, the pain...it had all been worth it, because John was with him again. But Sherlock had to know if John wanted more. John had to know by now...he must know how Sherlock felt. But there was only one way to find out.
The inside of the so-called office was dingy, and mostly empty. There was no furniture, other than a desk and chair in one corner, and a single land line phone. Sherlock started shuffling through some papers on the desk as John looked in the back. There was a loo, which looked like it hadn’t been cleaned since the last century, and some stacks of order receipts.
He straddled Sherlock, kissing his pale throat and down his chest, trailing his fingers down Sherlock’s stomach to his belt buckle. As he undid Sherlock’s trousers, he swirled his tongue around one peaked nipple, then the other. Sherlock arched up into him, making a glorious whimpering sound.
John felt his breath catch in his throat. Sherlock looked overwhelmed, but his eyes were fixed on John.
Sherlock considered this for a moment, before he nodded. John pulled him to his feet and flung one of Sherlock’s arms over his shoulder.
Then John’s tongue was gone, his hand was gone, and John’s cock was sliding in between Sherlock’s legs, his torso on Sherlock’s back.
John blinked his eyes open to sunlight streaming into the bedroom and his head resting against the headboard at an awkward angle. He glanced down to see that Sherlock’s head was half-resting on his chest, and he was breathing evenly, his arm flung over John’s waist.
John winced, feeling dry-mouthed and jet-lagged, and extremely annoyed. He pulled the pillow more soundly over his head.
“I love you, John Watson,” Sherlock whispered against his lips. “I will love you until the day I close my eyes forever. I want to be with you, in mind, in body, in whatever way you want to be with me. I’m tired of pretending otherwise.”
“Do what?” John yawned. His anger seemed to have dissipated with the night, and now all he felt was bone-deep exhaustion.
John’s breath caught in his throat. It wasn’t really the reply he'd been expecting, and it made him realize how much Sherlock had been holding back. There was so much they had avoided saying, so much tiptoeing around each other in the past year. He was done. He was so far beyond done, he couldn’t believe it had taken him so long to see it. It had been seven long years, and he
“Oh,” John said, hesitating slightly before he followed. “I am studying law on scholarship. Dad did want Harry to be a barrister. Dropped out, though. The drinking didn’t help.”
Sherlock felt his mouth open and close a few times, because his brain was having trouble processing this information.
John nipped his bottom lip, and Sherlock felt his knees buckle, a small groan escaping his lips. John’s lips curled upward slightly, and he held Sherlock up as he continued to snog him so thoroughly that Sherlock completely forgot that they were in a public place.That is, until someone wolf-whistled at them from across the street.
Rosie was standing up in her crib, rubbing her eyes blearily, babbling nonsensically. John clicked the baby monitor off and went to the crib to pick her up.
John groaned, licking and nipping harder on Sherlock’s neck. Slowly, torturously slowly, he started to roll his hips, grinding himself into Sherlock.
He couldn’t help it. He felt the mirth bubbling up in his chest, and before he knew it he was laughing uproariously.
“Sodding fag was poking his head in other people’s business,” the bigger man said. “Needed to be taught a lesson.”
He didn't allow himself to deny it anymore: he’d been in love with Sherlock for so long that it was almost like it had settled into his DNA. He had lived with it uncomfortably before Sherlock fell of the roof of Barts, but he
John helped Sherlock up the stairs and to his room, shrugging him out of his shoes and coat. He found some alcohol in the kitchen cupboard and cleaned the lacerations on Sherlock’s face as best he could. One of Sherlock’s eyes was already so swollen that he could barely open it, so John created a cold compress using a flannel.
John slid his hand into Sherlock’s hair, something he’d longed to do so many times, pulling his head down so that he could slip his tongue into Sherlock’s mouth, tentatively, and Sherlock let out a small whimper.
They stared at each other for a long moment, and John felt his throat working. Sherlock’s eyes were sharp, evaluating, tinged with a deep hurt; but he said nothing.
One Thursday night, John was reading a book in his chair, with a cold cup of tea next to him and the child monitor on the side table. Sherlock was perched in his own chair, his fingers steepled over his lips, watching John.
Now, for the first time since before Sherlock had been dead, they were clear of any obstacles, real or imagined. He was free to tell Sherlock how he felt, finally, yet he hadn’t. He told himself he was just waiting for his moment, for the right time, whatever that could be.
Once they got to their row, John took out his laptop before stowing his carry-on in the bin above him. Sherlock was already settling into his seat, pulling his coat over him.
“Of course, of course,” Lestrade said, waving his hand. “I got approval from the D.I. Just this once.”
“Fuck you,” John said, his lips twitching into a smile. He was so happy that his entire body was singing with it, and he simply didn’t know what to do with himself.
“John?” Sherlock blinked up at him, seeming to have difficulty focusing. He clutched his head with one hand. “What are you doing?”
“We’re fine, Mrs. Hudson,” John called back, forcing his tone to be light. “Sherlock’s just being... Sherlock. You know how it is.”
I know, it's been ages since this updated. I'm planning on trying to update every couple of weeks from now on, though. Scout's honor.
John took the long way home from the surgery, walking through Regent’s Park. Halfway there, the rain began to fall, leaves dipping toward the ground as they grew heavy with drops. John shook out his umbrella and put it up, sliding his other hand in his jacket pocket.
Sherlock nudged John’s shirt up his chest, and John sat up a bit to help him take it off. Sherlock started kissing down his torso, a bit at a time, teasing each of his nipples with his tongue. He nipped at the vee of John’s hip, leading downward until John’s whole body was on fire.
, as you so eloquently described him. Unfortunately, I was caught. I might have escaped relatively unscathed if I had not deduced that he and his friend have been shagging each other for the past two months. When I pointed it out, they were less than pleased. ”
Sherlock raised his eyebrow. “Most young female suicides occur in the home, slit wrists or pills. Or even carbon monoxide poisoning. No one kills themselves by inhaling chlorine gas. It was murder, and it's definitely connected with Carl Powers. A serial killer, and an arrogant one, it’s like Christmas,” he said, almost gleefully.
“So?” Sherlock set down the coffee to steep and turned around, crossing his arms and leaning against the counter. His eyes widened fractionally, flicking over John again.
“I know,” John said, because he did. He’d been imagining this moment for so long, and now that it was finally here—he was about to have sex with Sherlock—he felt completely overwhelmed.
When he reached the point in the park where that one bench stood, John paused for a moment. He had walked by it thousands of times, never acknowledging its significance, but for some reason, this time he paused.
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed, and for one paralyzing, heart-wrenching moment, John thought he was about to be rejected.
He leaned back against the door, sighing. The mistletoe shouldn’t make him so angry; it was a stupid tradition, anyway. Who said that you had to kiss someone just because they were standing underneath a plant?
Sherlock looked like he was going to object again, but thought better of it, and took a sip from the cold beverage. John smiled, sipping his own beer.
A few hours later, everyone was fed and a bit tipsy, and they were all sitting in the living room listening to Sherlock playing “Silent Night” on the violin. It wasn’t snowing, but there was a light frost on the window, a fire was crackling in the hearth, and the lights were twinkling in the dim light. Molly was sitting in Lestrade’s lap, wearing fake antlers (because, as usual, Sherlock had refused to wear them). Lestrade whispered something in her ear, and she giggled.
“I already know more about you than most of your acquaintances, as I believe I have already proven.” The side of Sherlock’s mouth quirked upward slightly. “Is there some other problem?”
Big droplets of rain were gathering into larger reservoirs on the painted wood, the divots in the seat where he and Mike had sat, seven long years ago, drinking coffee.
John told the cabbie the address, glancing nervously over at Sherlock again. “You still haven’t actually told me how you ended up in a dark alley, being beaten to a pulp by a meathead.”
Though a few of them grumbled or gave Sherlock death glares, they moved a bit to the side, and John was able to catch a glimpse of the woman. She was wearing a familiar-looking long pink rain coat, and was nearly on her side. Her face was slightly obscured by long tendrils of dark, wet hair, and a fine white froth laced her nose and mouth.
“No, you didn’t. I heard them hitting you all the way from the street.” He prodded Sherlock’s chest slightly, and he winced as John touched his right side. “Bruised ribs, if not fractured.”
Chi opened her eyes. “She had cancer too. A different kind than mine. She had lots of spots on her legs and lumps on her neck.”
“No, no. I just...I want to make sure. That this is what you want. Because…” he swallowed, trying to find the words, but it was like trying to catch a falling star. “I can’t go back from this. If we...I will want to be like this. I want. I want to be with you. Do you understand? Not just now.”
John’s immediate impulse was to refuse. He wanted nothing more than to stay with Sherlock now, forever, starting right away. But that very impulse scared him more than anything else. He was in danger of falling head over heels for this man who wanted nothing more out of him than a flatmate.
John must have drifted off at some point–he probably shouldn't have had the third glass of scotch–because the next thing he knew the captain was telling them to put their seat backs up in preparation for landing at Boston Logan. He blinked his eyes open, realizing that he had slumped down in his seat and his head was resting on Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock was reading
John frowned, but before he could prod her further, Lestrade and Molly appeared in front of him, coats on. “Okay, we’re off,” Lestrade said happily, his eyes only for Molly. “Happy Christmas, John.”
John let his eyes flutter open, focusing his gaze on the ceiling again. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Sherlock’s pale profile against the darkness of the room.
John’s eyes flicked downward, and Sherlock was suddenly extremely aware of John’s proximity. His heart started beating against his chest ferociously.
John reached over with his free hand to feel Sherlock’s forehead, gently. He sighed in relief, as Sherlock’s fever seemed to have broken. He was still warm, but not burning up anymore.
“Sherlock?” John whispered, nudging Sherlock’s shoulder gently, but not enough to worsen the concussion. Sherlock didn’t budge.
“Very.” Sherlock lay down lengthwise on the couch, in his thinking pose, with his hands steepled under his chin.
“We should shower,” John said, unhurriedly wiping them both off with his shirt, then lying back down.
John grabbed his hand, squeezing it gently. “Sorry, it’s just. I’ve never had to give lessons on initiating sex before,” John said, eyes dancing.
“No,” Sherlock said quickly. John cocked his head, watching him, and he noticed there was a tiny bit of fluff on Sherlock’s collar.
John shifted on his feet, feeling as if he were being flayed open by his gaze. “I… er… do you want breakfast? Tea?”
John raised his head to look into Sherlock’s eyes. After all this time, he was finally going to say it, for real.
Wishing he could turn and run out the doors, John made his way over to a seat on the edge of the first row and quickly sat down.
Then he’d run into Mike, and Sherlock had swept into his life, a hurricane of wool coat and dark hair and quick words that cut deep, and John had been smitten within the first two hours.
As he stood there, completely immobile, the figure on the porch walked forward, out of the darkness. Once the figure moved under the light of a streetlamp, he could see dark curly hair.
“Good going, by the way,” John said under his breath to Mrs. Hudson as Lestrade and Molly went into the hall to get their coats.
“Your alcoholic sister’s failings shouldn’t dictate your entire life. Even your father would have agreed with that, drunkard though he was. Fulfilling your dead parent’s wishes is simple folly.”
John clamped down on that thought just as it crossed his mind, stuffed it into a tiny box, and exiled it to the far back of his mind.
“What else should we do today?” John closed his eyes, his voice already drowsy. “Maybe there’ll be a case. I could call Lestrade.”
In the end, it was three more weeks before he saw Sherlock Holmes again, and it was purely by accident.
he wanted to ask. He wished he could see Sherlock’s face, to discern whether it was a joke or…a flirtation.
They ran down another fire escape, dashing out into the street just as the cab was turning the corner, and Sherlock jumped in front of the taxi, holding out his arms.
He got up and strode through the ensuite door to the bathroom, grabbing his medical kit and walking back into Sherlock’s room.
“For all I care, we can go down to get the adoption papers today and make it official, but I think she already thinks of you as her other father,” he said.
Sherlock met his gaze, and the intensity of feeling he saw there—the love, he knew now—almost knocked John backwards.
Sherlock met his gaze, tilting his head to the side. It wasn’t in a self-deprecating way, nor was it a dismissal; it was more...considering.
The front door was unlocked, as it usually was when Sherlock was home, and John took the steps up to the flat two-time. “Sherlock,” he called out, putting his jacket up on its hook. He could hear Sherlock talking to someone in the next room.
His thoughts drifted further, into more dangerous territory. He imagined what Sherlock’s lush lips tasted like, or how that pale, delicate skin would feel beneath his own. John longed to twist the dark curly hair between his fingers, and see how Sherlock’s face would look, lips parted, as he…
“Wow, you two actually have a tree this year, well done,” Lestrade said, clapping John on the shoulder.
John felt his breath catch; he’d never heard Sherlock say something like that, never imagined it would be directed toward him.
It took him a moment to realize that John was speaking again. “Sherlock, I want… I want you,” John panted. “I want this, please, I want you to come, give it to me love.”
At first, that’s all it was; a press of lips, John’s heart pounding, and then Sherlock cupped John’s cheek in his hand, tilting his head and parting his mouth to let John in.
After a while, John felt Sherlock’s forehead again. His fever seemed to be going down, which was a good sign. The rest of the symptoms would just have to run their course. At least he’d be here, in case Sherlock got worse.
John rubbed the back of his neck. That wasn’t untrue; he had been working for about thirty hours straight and hadn’t been off his feet the entire time. He still had to do that consult, but it would keep for another ten minutes.
“I’ll tell it to you.” Chi swallowed audibly, and John could see that her lips seemed too dry. He automatically reached for the water on the bedside table and helped her sit up. As she drank, she never stopped looking up at him. Her gaze was deeply unsettling for a reason he couldn’t quite pinpoint.
“Oh.” Greg had had his eye on Molly for what felt like eons, but he still hadn’t asked her out, despite the fact that his divorce had been final for some time.
Trying to keep some semblance of composure, John walked out of the bathroom. He closed the door behind himself, leaning back against it and closing his eyes. There was a tightness in his chest, not that different than what he’d felt on the day Sherlock had left him standing on the tarmac. Back then he’d had a tiny sliver of hope that Sherlock would pull a
He slipped into bed, feeling the ache in his bones from the long night of travel they’d just endured. “Turn out the light when you’re done thinking,” John said, turning over and putting a pillow over his head.
“Oh, John, good,” Sherlock said, nodding curtly. “I was looking for you. We’ve been summoned to a crime scene.”
There was a baby monitor on the counter, along with a mostly-empty bottle of formula. Some kind of experiment was in progress on the kitchen table, tea cups of noxious-looking fluids interspersed with baby toys, and a toddler book on the solar system was sitting on the high chair tray.
“She had pulmonary edema, resulting from drowning in freshwater. How else would that have happened?” the forensics man asked, obviously annoyed. “She jumped off a bridge and drowned herself. The simplest explanation tends to be the right one.”
Christmas Eve arrived. Sherlock had been in a bit of a mood ever since the day the mistletoe appeared, which John assumed was simply because no good cases had come up. By midafternoon on the day of the party, Sherlock was still in his pyjamas and blue silk robe, curled up on the sofa, facing the back.
John leaned against the kitchen counter, watching Sherlock work for several minutes without speaking. It was mesmerizing in a way, seeing Sherlock in his element. He was so focused that it was as if he had already forgotten that John was there.
Sherlock pulled off immediately, licking the spit from his lips. “Problem?” he asked, a tightness appearing around his eyes.
He pressed his lips together and turned on his heel, walking with a slight spring to his step, weaving through the other evening commuters.
If Sherlock noticed his soppy contemplations, he gave no indication whatsoever. Instead, he picked up the formula bottle, waving it between his index and thumb.
Sherlock just glanced down blearily at his hands and back up at John, as if he weren’t entirely sure what the objects were meant to be used for.
“Very well. Just don’t ruin the furniture. Or what’s left of it.” Neither of them moved as her footsteps faded away again.
John cleared his throat slightly, realizing the kettle had been whistling. He turned back to the kitchen and poured the water.
“Go on,” John said, and Sherlock rolled his eyes, but he took the pills and sipped the tea before he set it on the side table. He leaned his head back and closed his eye again, sighing.
“I’m going to kiss you now,” he said, and Sherlock did nothing other than nod again, more vigorously this time.
“You okay?” he asked, glancing up at Sherlock, who nodded, but Sherlock’s heart started beating much faster in anticipation of what John was going to do next.
John looked up at him, and the earnestness he saw in Sherlock’s eyes, the slight pinkish hue on his cheeks and nose from the early fall breeze... his heart just couldn’t take it anymore.
“There’s a book too, if you’re teaching young children how to do origami,” the clerk said, smiling, as she scanned all the packages. “We have teachers in here all the time. What level do you teach?”
John hesitated, wondering if he should run in the other direction, but somehow he found himself swinging his bookbag over his shoulder and jogging to catch up.
Standing here, though, listening to the rain fall on his umbrella, dichotomously reminded him of standing in front of a glossy black gravestone. A gravestone that, he now knew, had stood over an empty grave.
Sherlock averted his eyes, looking embarrassed, but he nodded. “But then you came down tonight, wearing those jeans, and the shoes, and I started to hope again.”
“He must have gone another way. I was so certain he’d take a cab so as to be harder to follow…” Sherlock muttered to himself, running his hand through his hair and pacing back and forth.
He wrapped a towel around his waist before walking out of the bathroom. Sherlock was still lying on the couch in the exact same position he’d been in before.
John nodded sternly before turning back to his task. He had barely spoken to Mycroft in the last year, but it wasn’t unlike him to show up unannounced.
The morning sunlight was starting to peek in through the window, threatening to bring him to consciousness, so John groaned and burrowed more deeply into his pillow. As he drifted through what was starting to feel like a terrible hangover, he could almost imagine that he could smell Sherlock’s hair. It was like squinting while looking at the sun.
Relief flooded through him, and John softened. “I know. Me either.” They’d both spent so long pretending, so long ignoring how they felt, that it was a tidal wave of emotion when they had finally set it free.
“He obviously has a lot more connections than we thought. This changes the range of motives dramatically, but we will have to come back to investigate,” Sherlock interrupted. “This new murder, though, it's connected, I can feel it. Come on.” Sherlock turned John around and pushed him toward the street.
The notes twirled downward from the swirling curtains, swelling and fading in turns. It was a plaintive piece, achingly beautiful, and it twisted deep in John’s gut. He suddenly felt lonelier than he’d ever felt in his life, just listening from afar.
“I should think it’s rather obvious.” Sherlock put the bag in his pocket and went back to inspecting the locker.
“Happy Christmas.” Mycroft held out the scotch. Sherlock raised an eyebrow as he walked past him, but he didn't take the bottle.
Sherlock looked at the hot dog a bit dubiously, but after a moment, he bit into it. “Interesting,” he said around his mouthful, sounding unconvinced.
“--to which I already know the answers, right,” John muttered. He took out the bottle of paracetamol and shook out a few pills. “Here, take these.”
John tilted his head to look at her through the slits of his eyes, but he said nothing. Her mouth tightened, the way it did before they were going to get into a row.
“When you weren’t here, I wished I had actually jumped off the roof,” he said, his voice quiet, careful, incongruous with the violence of the statement.
“Okay,” John nodded. “And when you… do you, um.” John shook his head, laughing. “For god’s sake, I’m a bloody doctor, this shouldn’t be hard to ask about.”
Sherlock averted his gaze, suddenly feeling too naked to be having this conversation. He took the tangled top sheet and pulled it around his body.
“Oh come off it,” John said, taking his hand again, and stepping closer. “I love that I’m the one to teach all of this to you. I thought our ‘first’ time was just, well, sloppy, because we had both been wanting each other for so long. At least, that’s how it was for me. I wanted everything, all of you, so much that I couldn’t stop myself long enough to even take off our clothes. But now we have all the time in the world. Like I said before, we can do this slowly. Everything you have told me so far has been good news.” John stepped closer again, into his space, and brushed his lips under Sherlock’s jaw. Sherlock shivered involuntarily.
John resisted the urge to swear under his breath and stuck his hands in his pockets as he walked back toward the front of the classroom.
John’s heart felt like it was going to burst, so he kissed Sherlock again, lightly. It felt like a promise for the future, a wish fulfilled.
The lights overhead were off, and the gradient light from the water was oscillating over the walls in strange dancing waves. There was something about the room that sent a shiver down John’s spine, and he didn’t think it was just the fact that Carl had died there.
“You thought if we came to Boston we would feel more like a detective team again?” John felt his heart sink a little. Maybe Sherlock was just trying to make them more of a unit in their work partnership again, nothing more.
The man on the screen shifted in his seat. “A couple of weeks. Their office is closed, I went yesterday to see. There was a sign saying ‘The Red Sox Red-Hatted League is officially disbanded.’ When I called Spaulding on the number he gave me, he said there was a minor delay, but that I would still be getting my checks in the mail.” John raised an eyebrow, noting that the man had an American accent.
John bit the side of his cheek. “I think I pretty much know everything you could possibly throw at me at this point, don’t you?”
“We want to look out for anything suspicious until then, but yes.” Sherlock was drumming his fingers against his thighs, obviously keyed up.
,” Sherlock said again, as if this were completely obvious. He turned his collar up against the drizzle that was starting to come down.
Sherlock arched as John enveloped the head of his cock with his mouth, swirling his tongue around and licking the most sensitive part as he stroked the base.
“Or I could lick your arse with my tongue,” John whispered, stroking up and rubbing his thumb over the head of Sherlock’s cock. “Until your cock is so hard that you beg me to touch it, to let you come."
Sherlock nodded once, his eyes already closed. John went to the bathroom, turning on the shower to hot. It felt so good to stand under the spray, and even though his body thought it was about 8 am, he felt himself being lulled back into a sleepy state. He didn’t realize until he’d emerged that he didn’t actually have his sleeping clothes yet, since the bellboy had to bring up their suitcases.
Sherlock seemed to share the sentiment. He swung a leg over so that he could sit on John’s lap, wrapping his long limbs around him. And oh, that was
It took a good three hours for him to finish and post it. He made himself some tea and a sandwich, then went back to sit in his chair and read, enjoying the fresh air coming in through the window.
He felt John turn his head slightly to look over at the window. “So it is,” he said, his voice soft.
“Okay.” John paused, licking his bottom lip quickly. “Do you… did you enjoy it, though? The kissing and… everything?”
It had been a couple of months since he’d moved back into 221B. It was like coming home, but as the old saying went, ‘you can never go home again.’ He’d changed irreversibly–he and Sherlock
He shook, and shook, and eventually he rolled to the side, letting Sherlock breathe. He grabbed his vest and cleaned them both off as best he could, then lay down, flopping an arm over his eyes.
Still, that phrase running through his head was so utterly, uncharacteristically romantic. Sappy, even.
He’d had the same one over and over again since he’d moved back into Baker Street. His subconscious carried him to a place where he could finally feel Sherlock’s naked body arching elegantly underneath him, his pale cheeks flushed as John thrust into him deeply. John always awoke from the dream alone in his bed, rock hard and with a deep sense of loss.
The whole Magnussen ordeal had changed that. The way Sherlock had looked at him right before he’d pulled the trigger had given him a glimmer of hope, despite the fact that it was paired with deep despair. On the tarmac, John had held Sherlock’s bare hand for what felt like the last time, and he’d had to physically stop himself from pulling Sherlock into a kiss right then and there.
John just rolled his eyes, helping him sit on the side of the tub. Sherlock leaned his head against the wall, breathing heavily, as if those few steps had exhausted him. John leaned over and ran the bath, turning it up hot enough that the room started filling with steam.
“Don’t know.” Sherlock struggled to sit up against the wall. Purplish bruises were already coloring the pale skin on his cheeks.
“Sherlock Holmes!” Wilson said, shaking Sherlock’s hand enthusiastically. “Thank you so much for coming. I would never have thought you’d take a little case like mine.”
John felt giddy, pulling Sherlock flush against him and kissing him again. He sucked on Sherlock’s lower lip, just a little, and Sherlock opened his mouth wider in a gasp. John fisted his hand in Sherlock’s curls, snogging him deeply, pouring everything he felt into the kiss.
Sherlock glanced upward and they exchanged a silent look for a long moment. Then Sherlock’s lips curled upward into a secret smile, one John knew was only for him.
“Hey,” John said, pulling a chair up to sit next to the bed. “Deduce something if you have to, but please stay awake.”
John reached up to cup Sherlock’s cheek, and Sherlock’s eyes fluttered at the contact. “Alright?” he asked, still unsure.
John ran down the empty corridor, opening the door to the lecture hall and quickly turned around to close it quietly behind him.
John looked at him. “So if you had your suspicions the whole time, why did we come here? Why take the case?”
After Greg left, John walked straight over to his cabinet and poured himself three fingers of scotch. He drank it all in one gulp, then poured another.
“I p-promise I won’t d-do anything un-t-toward,” Sherlock said, grinning despite the chattering of his teeth.
He stomped up to his room and lay on his bed to study more, but he couldn’t focus on the words. Sherlock’s voice kept floating through his head. The thing was, every single thing he’d said had been spot on. John had never fully admitted it to himself, but giving up medicine was one of his greatest regrets. It was like Sherlock had known exactly which buttons to push.
Mr. Hatayama sighed. “Chi also said you’d say something like that.” He smiled a watery smile, looking at John over his wire-rimmed glasses. “She was wise beyond her years, as I’m sure you noticed.”
John opened his mouth to say something else, but it wasn’t worth it. Instead, he clenched his fists, turning around and starting back down the steps.
On some level, he wished he’d prepared more for this moment. If he’d woken up that morning, knowing that this would be the day he would finally tell Sherlock how he felt, that he would finally rip his chest open and let him see his heart, maybe he would have had a glass of brandy or two to steel himself.
She leaned in conspiratorially. “There’s another bedroom upstairs, if you’ll be needing two bedrooms.” She winked at him.
John could almost feel the heat of Sherlock’s breath against his cheek. “No. I mean, yes,” he said hoarsely. His throat felt dry.
John ran up the steps of the law building, checking his watch as he went. Despite Sherlock’s entreaties, he’d slept far later than he’d meant to, and now he was late for Criminal Law.
Sherlock had already turned back to his slide, which he now put under the microscope. “Mrs. Hudson, this is John Watson. He’s studying law at the university. He’ll be my new flatmate.”
When he glanced over at the living room, Sherlock was no longer on the sofa and the loo door was closed. John smirked, shaking his head. Sherlock might try to feign nonchalance, but he actually loved Christmas and being surrounded by the people who cared about him.
Sherlock immediately grabbed his arm, pulling him over onto the rooftop. The momentum of it, however, made him lose his balance, and they both toppled forward. Sherlock landed with a soft grunt, and John was directly on top of him. Their faces were half an inch apart, and Sherlock’s wild eyes were looking directly into John’s.
John’s hand tightened on the strap of his bookbag as he glanced down the street. He should probably call for help. That would be the most sensible thing to do.
John sighed, but he still looked amused. “It’s really nothing I didn’t expect from you but… for one thing, ordering me into the bedroom isn’t going to get either of us in the mood. It’s not like a transaction, you know.”
Sherlock looked up at the window, as the snow drifted downward outside silently. There was nothing else he wanted, not anymore. There was nothing left to chase after. Sure, there would always be cases, but there would also be John. And maybe someday in the far future, a cottage in the country somewhere, where John would write under a patio while he worked in the garden, and bees buzzed in the background.
Rosie was fast asleep, her bumblebee stuffed animal tucked in next to her—she’d called it “beh” the other day, Sherlock had been convinced it was her first word, but John thought she was just making sounds. Sherlock had bought it for her, and John was certain that was the reason she loved it so much.
Sherlock took out his lock pick. It was midday on a Friday, and there were plenty of passersby on the busier streets on either side, but there were no people on their street.
John picked up his glass. “A bit,” he said. He clenched his left fist, trying to keep it from trembling. It was harder to control the more he drank.
Steeling himself once more, John opened the door and walked back down the hall. Sherlock was in the kitchen, pouring the boiling water into a French press.
"No. No, it’s...perfect," Sherlock said, turning to adjust his collar in the mirror to hide the slight flush of his face. He was wearing his aubergine shirt, because John had always loved it.
He blinked his eyes open and turned over, pushing the pillow off. The sound was coming from Sherlock, who was in the fetal position on the other side of the bed, clutching a pillow, hugging it to his torso. He was snoring extremely loudly and drooling a little bit.
John put the kettle on, then walked into the living room and leaned against the doorframe, watching them.
John took a deep breath. Hope was dangerous, she was right. Until now he had never let himself hope, because Sherlock was gone, and there was no bringing him back.
After a moment, he leaned back, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s. “I’m going to get something to clean us up, all right?”
“Squeeze your thighs together,” John gasped, starting to thrust forward. He was kissing Sherlock’s shoulders and neck all the while, his scruffy beard surely leaving marks on Sherlock’s body.
John met his eyes, and for a moment neither of them moved, they were just breathing each other’s air, and then John was pushing him back against the bed. John pulled off his jumper, leaving his vest and jeans. He crawled onto the bed, settling between Sherlock’s thighs, pressing him into the mattress. Sherlock couldn’t find the words to protest that John was still wearing far too many clothes.
“No, thanks.” John opened his laptop as a way to end the conversation, and she took the hint, leaving to get his drink.
John felt his forehead, but he still felt very warm. “I have some soup heating up in the kitchen, I’ll be right back.”
I also took some liberties regarding the general organization of law studies at the University College of London School of Laws, and based it mostly on the way classes are taught here in the US (I don’t know if they hold midterm examinations or whether they use the socratic method for example).
Sherlock snorted. “I had a feeling it was Larry the whole time. After all, he was the one who encouraged Wilson to apply for the ‘job’ at the League. I just wasn’t sure why they were distracting Wilson from what was going on in the section. To be honest, they probably needn’t have bothered, it’s not as if Wilson was really that observant anyway. They might have gotten away with the whole thing if they had just paid him like they were supposed to.”
John blew air out in one long breath. “I’m not good at this stuff, but… I’m going to try.” He cleared his throat. Sherlock felt hope starting to fight against the anxiety, just a little.
John felt his heart softening at the look. “Well, you can start by not ripping open their deepest and most painful secrets. It tends to rub people the wrong way.”
Mrs. Hudson glanced back at John, grinning widely, and John looked downward, shuffling his feet a bit. Everyone seemed to think they were a couple, yet Sherlock seemed completely uninterested.
Sherlock huffed a laugh, and John giggled along with him, until they were both giggling as if they were teenagers snogging on the couch for the first time.
Sherlock opened her mouth to look down her throat. “There’s also some kind of irritation on her throat. I’ve seen these kinds of chemical burns before. There was a dolt of a student who mishandled chemicals in our lab last year.”
The students flowed around John, some stealing amused glances at him as they passed, others talking behind their hands.
Instead, he spoke again, his hand still in Sherlock’s hair. “Can I ask you something? You don’t have to answer, if you don’t want to.”
Sherlock raised Alexia’s hand and sniffed her fingernails, which were also painted pink. “This was not a suicide. Or a drowning, for that matter,” he said, replacing her hand carefully.
“Ohhhh. No, no, no. Stupid.” Sherlock shook his head as if disappointed with himself. “He didn’t die, did he? He just killed someone
The thought caught him off-guard. He’d danced around it before, but he’d never actually given it a name. He’d never loved before, never said it to anyone before, and now that John was in his life he could not foresee ever loving anyone else ever again.
As searing blue eyes held his, John couldn’t control himself anymore, and he was coming and coming, still thrusting hard upward and crying out into Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock held him through it until John finally felt himself coming down from his orgasm.
Sherlock emerged from the bathroom just as John was finishing up with putting new sheets on the bed.
“I wouldn’t trade it for the world,” Sherlock murmured. The naked honesty in his expression, the passion, was almost too much; it was like staring into the sun.
Sherlock looked up at him, his eyes glittering. “Do you know you do that out loud?” he asked. Their eyes met, and neither of them looked away, the moment seeming to stretch on endlessly. John’s heart was beating faster, and the wind whipping off the river couldn’t be the only reason why he shivered.
“Mr. Watson,” a smooth voice said. Something about the voice made the hair on the back of John’s neck stand up. “Please get in.”
“Is this his idea of a joke?” John muttered under his breath, moving into the room and shutting the door behind him.
“I know,” he whispered. As the words came out, he realized… that he did. He’d always known, in a way. He took a deep breath, feeling as if his whole life had been leading to this moment, his heart pounding.
“Since you’re not going to bother asking me if I want to go, can you tell me where we are going, at least?”
Now, John let his eyes wander a bit, down Sherlock’s torso to his narrow hips, then back up to the curling hair over Sherlock’s pale forehead. His lush lips that looked a bit raw from all the kissing the evening before, and his eyelids were fluttering slightly in his sleep. It was surreal to see Sherlock in such a vulnerable position in the light of day.
He should go back downstairs and apologize. They should probably talk about the fact that his wife, who had almost killed Sherlock once, had then taken a bullet for him. But they didn’t talk about things. They didn’t express their feelings like that.
Chi watched him for a long moment, then nodded very seriously. “Okay, here you go,” she said, handing him a red square of paper and taking a new one of her own.
Sherlock shook his head, once. He looked so young, so hopeful, and John took the one step toward him that he had been waiting six years to take.
“Don’t even think about it.” John caught him, hefting him up to sitting position on the side of the bed, then slinging Sherlock’s arm over his shoulder to help him toward the bathroom. “I promise you’ll feel better.”
Sherlock grinned, and started to climb onto the bed, but John realized that—ridiculously—they were both still mostly clothed.
Sherlock bit his lower lip.“I was… hoping… but I didn’t know for sure that this would be the outcome.”
“Shit,” he cursed under his breath. He stood quickly, rubbing his eyes as he strode back over to the bed. The compress had slid off Sherlock’s face in his sleep, and his black eye had bloomed spectacularly into deep purple. There were other dark splotches all over his cheekbones.
When he finally drifted off, he dreamed of bees buzzing in the honeyed afternoon light of a summer afternoon and of dark curls twined through his fingers.
Sherlock was leaning forward slightly, his eyes closed and breathing ragged. John wasn’t even sure he’d heard him until he said, very quietly, “Serbia.”
Sherlock sighed, as if relieved, and John smoothed his hair back again a few times. He thought Sherlock had fallen asleep again, but then he spoke once more.
John was nursing a glass of the scotch Mycroft had brought, figuring it would be a waste to bin it out of spite. He definitely had a healthy buzz going, and the fact that Sherlock was playing violin gave him an excuse to stare unabashedly at him. There was something sensual about the lines of Sherlock’s shoulders as he played, the tilt of his head, the way his fingers caressed the strings. Sherlock was a musician, there was no way about it. He seemed to become a part of the music as he played, and it was amazing to behold.
? He was a champion swimmer, and he trained here with the local team three times a week despite the rigorous course load he was taking. He was getting top marks, and was on track to graduate in the top of the class.”
“No. People don’t do that.” Sherlock’s eye slid shut again. John was about to protest but Sherlock mumbled, “Not sleeping. Just resting.”
John laughed, looking at her over Sherlock’s shoulder. “I’m getting your food, sweetheart. Your dads were just having a moment."
He might have whimpered—or maybe it was Sherlock, he wasn’t entirely sure, but his fingers sunk into Sherlock’s hair, tugging his head to the side so that he could kiss him harder.
John moaned into his mouth, reaching up to slide his fingers into Sherlock’s hair, tugging it just enough not to cause actual pain, as they started moving in sync.
Neither of them moved for a long moment. Sherlock wanted it to last as long as possible: this feeling of John inside of him, the feeling of being joined, John’s breath hot against his neck.
“It’s still cold enough to give you hypothermia,” John called out, but it was too late; Sherlock had started to swim toward the cluster. John glanced back toward the far bridge where the crime scene was still ongoing, but they were far enough away that no one had seemed to notice that Sherlock Holmes was fully submerged in the Thames.
There should be fireworks or a national parade for this sort of revelation instead of this: two people having a conversation in the dying light of an April evening, prompted by almost nothing, but almost a decade too late.
John banged his own head against the door. He needed to snap out of it; going down that road, even in his imagination, was pointless. He could manage to avoid going through the kitchen into the living room until after Christmas Eve.
Once their gazes met, John took a long breath. “Do you… do you want to have sex? Because we don’t have to. You were so enthusiastic… I mean, you were the one who kissed me first… and then… I mean. I just thought. I thought you wanted to, but some people don’t like having sex. I don’t want to do anything you don’t want to do.”
“Sherlock,” John said in relief. “The murderer is my bloody Criminal Law professor. His name was Moriarty. He made me stay after lecture, and was dropping all these hints about the pool—he knows who I am. He knows we were there.”
“Blast,” Sherlock said under his breath, his sharp eyes flicking over the man. “Welcome to London, sorry for the bother.”
“No,” John said, shaking his head as he leaned back. He took the stethoscope out of his ears and slung it around his neck again. “I’m just filling in. How’s your pain? Do you need more morphine?”
John closed his eyes, turning his head slightly to the side, saying nothing. Of course, Chi had been right. He’d given up.
“I did,” John said, his voice hoarse and a bitter aftertaste on his tongue. He badly wanted to order another drink, but he had a feeling that the bartender wouldn’t sell him any more. He still had half a bottle of scotch at home, but he could stop at the Tesco on the way home and by some more malt.
As John walked down the stairs, he glanced over at Sherlock, whose head poked up to look at him briefly.
“Oh come off it,” John said, jogging to catch up with him. “Let’s do it. It sounds fun, actually.” He took out his phone, googling a map of the Trail.
John felt Sherlock’s cheekbones and nose, then took out his stethoscope and lifted up Sherlock’s shirt. He tried not to think about the intimacy of all this--as if Sherlock were just any another patient--as he listened to Sherlock’s chest. “Breathe,” he said. Sherlock obeyed. “Again.” Sherlock’s deep breath turned into a hacking cough this time.
“Sit up a second,” Sherlock said, and John obeyed. Sherlock pulled his pants and trousers down enough that John’s cock sprung free. Sherlock paused, licking his lips again, and he met John’s gaze.
He stood up straight and went to heat up some chicken broth, wondering if he had some spare sheets in the linen closet.
Sherlock sat down again, but closer to John’s chest this time, so that John’s cock was behind him instead of in front. He reached back to ensure that John’s cock was nestled in between his cheeks, not inside, but sliding along his opening.
John felt his heart leap in his throat as he looked up in surprise. This wasn’t Sherlock, he knew that; it was just some images captured on film. Yet for some reason, John couldn’t stop watching, wondering what was going to happen next.
John moved closer, feeling his heart pound in his chest, because it was happening, finally, after years of longing and wondering, of not knowing whether Sherlock felt the same… Sherlock was kissing him.
This was the part where one was supposed to lose oneself, wasn’t it? This was the part where he was supposed to give in to sensation, according to everything he had ever heard. But he couldn’t. He was too focused on every single movement, every brush of lips, of fingers; too focused on John’s beating heart. John Watson was on top of him,
One day in early summer, John was walking through the ward on his way to a consult when he passed by a private room. The walls were the same sterile shade of grey as the rest of the patient rooms in the hospital, but this room was vibrant with color despite that. The afternoon sunlight filtered in through hundreds of pieces of colored paper that were strung up on the ceiling. John stepped in, looking up, and when he was directly underneath them, he could see that they were origami paper cranes.
John forced himself to meet Sherlock’s eyes again, because watching that mouth was too dangerous. “Okay, rule one about friendship—just because you can deduce all of those things about someone doesn’t mean you have to say them aloud. Friends don’t pick at their friends’ wounds until they bleed, Sherlock.”
Sherlock sighed, letting John help him sit up enough to drink some of the broth. After a few sips, he shook his head, and John helped him lay back down.
“I have to get our daughter some food first, then you can have your way with me again,” John said, effervescent with happiness.
“God, yes,” Sherlock said, looking down to see John’s cock between his legs. It was unbelievably hot, and dirty in a way.
John picked up the cup and took a sip of the tea, which was fixed exactly how he liked it. A peace offering, if a meagre one. “Thanks,” he said.
He trudged down the street in the fading light, hands stuffed in his pockets and his shoulders hunched. Sherlock was obviously not interested in him, and he was pining away like some kind of an idiot. Try as he might, though, it seemed to be impossibly hard to forget about him.
John was now sure that he recognized the two voices: they were the two men that had beaten Sherlock up in the alley.
Anderson scowled at both of them, but didn’t say anything more. Lestrade was walking back over to them, hanging up his phone at the same time. “Alexia Poussant went missing four days ago,” he said. “She was on her way to visit her parents in Cardiff, but she never made it. The parents thought she’d decided to stay at school, and the roommate thought she was at home. No one realized she was actually missing until a few days had gone by.”
They followed the flow of foot traffic over a bridge toward the park, passing dozens of restaurants and bars along the way. The park itself was smaller than John had imagined, but was just as he would have an imagined an old-time baseball park to look. It was old, very old, but seemed to have a lot of character to it.
He was looking at John with such unaffectedly earnest expression that John felt a tug in his chest. Sherlock cared enough about John to remember extraneous details about his life, enough to apologize when it obviously didn’t come naturally to him, enough to be worried that John wouldn’t forgive him.
Sherlock felt himself flush even more deeply, but the fact that John hadn’t left him yet gave him courage. He nodded again.
It took a couple of hours to wrap up the case, talking to the Boston Police and giving their statements. It turned out that Larry had been the go-between for members of investment firms who had previously been flagged for white collar crime, so they couldn’t so much as meet in a coffee shop without the FBI trying to bug their conversations. The way they had devised to divulge which stocks their underground buyers should purchase was to hand them to Larry as they bought their hot dog, and he would hand it to the buyer as he gave them their hot dog. They had invented the Red-Hatted League, hiring Wilson alone, so that he would be distracted by keeping score of the game while they were transferring the papers. Sherlock had to explain this to at least five different people, in detail, and John was starting to feel sleepy, wondering why he had gotten that third beer. Finally, they were allowed to leave.
Sherlock’s pink tongue dipped out to wet his bottom lip again, and John’s eyes followed the movement.
Sherlock had expected Valentine’s Day to be no different. After all, it was their first one as a couple, and John was the romantic of the two of them. As long as there was some kind of shag involved, Sherlock probably wouldn’t object to whatever John had planned.
Sherlock turned his head to look up at him, his eyes still glassy, as if he were having trouble focusing. He tried to take a deep breath through his nose and coughed again. Instead of talking, he squeezed his eyes shut, nodding again.
Sherlock had killed Magnussen, knowing full well what it would mean. Then he’d left on that plane knowing it would end in torture and death. And it had all been so that John could stay with Mary--the woman who had nearly killed him not six months before--just because he thought it was what John wanted.
There was a ringing in John’s ears. Sherlock was looking at him in surprise, his mouth opening and closing like a fish. His normal bravado had been punctured like a balloon.
“'Course,” he said, nodding. Once he had everything in place for landing, he lay back and closed his eyes, nursing his water. He could already feel the dehydration headache coming on.
John awoke with a start, realizing immediately that the room was lighter than he remembered. He’d obviously fallen asleep sometime in the night.
