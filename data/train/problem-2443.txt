Before he even had his hand on the doorknob, soft violin music streamed towards him and when he quietly opened the door he saw Sherlock standing at the window, the instrument at his chin and shoulder, the bow gracefully dancing over the sharp strings. John gaped and his heart started to ache.
John found his voice again, anger boiling high in his chest. How stupid had he been not to see it? Why would the homeless network inform Sherlock about this one drug lab among certainly dozens of them in London? And so soon after the dealers had escaped without anyone seeing their damn faces?!?
The setback of the murder case had shaken him in a way no case ever has before. The brutality with which the victims had been handled still makes him shiver. But it’s not the only reason he finds himself unable to drift back into sleep incidentally. He’d seriously doubt his mental capabilities if it weren’t for the fact that his hard drive now seems to be wired to the thud his heart gives in his rib cage every time John breaths deeply in the dark. Pushing against it is to no avail and for a moment Sherlock half resents himself again, his lips forming a thin line. He will have to start again tomorrow, go to the morgue, absorb the records about the examination, check in with his underground network; there must be something, maybe even similar other cases—
It’s weird and it throws Sherlock off track and he has to harrumph before he can start to address Lestrade again.
John was very aware how their relationship had always been weird but they had liked it, even relished in it. Of course they had never talked about it. It seemed that, as long as there were still boundaries between them, boundaries that had nothing to do with them perpetually ignoring how something like personal space even existed, boundaries they didn’t question, everything was fine.
It feels thoroughly out of time again.
“My goodness, any preschooler has better mental capacity than that idiot Anderson,” he splutters before regarding Lestrade closely. The man is shifting uncomfortably and shuffles his feet on the linoleum floor, refusing to give way.
“Sherlock, I need you to be honest now.”
Having said these words, he opened the low door under the stairs, and John was shoved inside behind Sherlock. Then the door closed, plunging them into total darkness.
“What-“, John starts as Sherlock retrieves a cardstock box in dark red.
“A simple card,” he states, pulling it out, holding it around the edges between his palms. “No personal indication I can detect. It's hand written but it’s no one I recognize.
“I couldn’t let that happen. John, you deserve nothing but the truth. I am sorry I didn’t have it in me to give it to you earlier.”
“I’ve had worse within the past two years, John”, Sherlock said and it sounded rather matter-of-factly.
Sherlock fidgeted next to him, pushing himself away from the table. He paced the room for the next five minutes before slouching against the wall where he slid down to John’s feet.
He gracefully lifted a long-fingered hand to make a throwaway gesture, his eyes focused on John, who was quite flabbergasted. For a moment he wondered whether Sherlock was making fun of him while wishing deep inside him that they had had this conversation years ago.
“Such a charmer,” he said good-naturedly and obviously had to suppress a giggling fit. Then he raised his glass.

“John, whatever it is you think of me, I am most certainly not a patient man,” Sherlock replies, slowly so he doesn’t stutter or lose his breath halfway through.
John has the grace to blush deeper and look sheepish.
talk, Sherlock, there is just so much I want you to know. But we really need to shower first and change. I can’t have this conversation in stained trousers.”
The next 27 hours seemed blend into each other. He had awoken in the morning after searching their flat, feeling widely confused about how he could have slept through half of the day and the night on the sofa in their sitting room but he’d been so incredibly exhausted. There were images in his head which felt dreamlike and unfixed, of warm skin on his cheeks when he had been so cold, of words whispered in the dark but it all was already slipping from him minutes after he’d woken in the light of an early tuesday morning. Like mist on a field in the morning; beautiful, unreal somehow and frustratingly impossible to hold onto. Only when he’d gotten up to fix himself a cup of tea had he noticed that Sherlock’s bedroom door stood ajar when he was 100% sure he’d closed it the day before. He himself was clad in a blanket that was still securely wrapped around him because he had taken it off the sofa with him. He could not remember having it with him when he had collapsed on the sofa 18 hours earlier.
“Do you want to shower first?” John wants to know and looks him over, taking in his sodden trousers, his sweaty shirt with the grime on the cuffs and his disheveled hair. Sherlock, for once, doesn’t care about his looks and John has to ask again to get a slight shake of his head by way of an answer.
However, if he
Across from him, John has given up waiting for him and waves at the waitress. Before Sherlock can do so much as blink, the girl is at their table, a big smile on her face and when John attentively smiles back at her, her eyes begin to shine with the attention. Sherlock seethes and clamps his mouth shut in recalcitrance. John is a handsome man, he concedes, charming and likable, and since he isn’t Sherlock’s, John can technically smile at whomever he likes. Females certainly like that smile of John’s.
“I should have known there were three, but we still have a chance. They haven’t killed us,” he heard Sherlock mumble.
Lestrade shakes his head while John gets up to his feet. He turns around and now it is Sherlock who glances at him. What is John doing, what is he aiming at? Sherlock has to force his attention back onto the tableau at hand to not give himself away and resumes his work.
PS: I so fell for Mycroft; he is amazing. If I could spend an evening with a character from the series, I'd choose him. We'd have Scotch in front of a fire place and talk about politics.
They are still standing close at the counter, much closer than the open room necessitates and the protruding table top Sherlock is leaning against is plunging uncomfortably into his side. Most of his weight is pressed down on his left leg where he’s shifted to accommodate within the narrow space between stool, counter and
He could hear Sherlock exhale, his breath forming little white puffs in the unmoving air between them. Their thighs touched, but John was in control again.
John’s eyebrows rise. “I didn’t exactly call you away, Sherlock, I merely told you to expect a delivery.”
“Why do you believe that, Dr. Watson? He came back to you and has stayed with you ever since. I don’t think he will leave again. You are angry with him but that is only understandable given your situation.”
During the ride home in the cab Sherlock figures that Molly is indeed telling the truth and it really is Valentine’s Day because the city is adorned with hearts and ribbons and roses and more such nonsense and Sherlock decides that, clearly, humanity has gone insane. He’d been too busy in his mind palace on the way to the morgue earlier, planning his experiment, and had deliberately blocked out his entire surroundings. Which is probably why the overall-adorable-fluffy-commerce-atmosphere disgusts him so thoroughly now.
The look Sherlock gave him was offended.
John just hummed, feeling very pleased with himself, took his own cup from the counter. He sat down in his favorite chair, taking this morning's papers and burying himself behind them.
"You told me this morning you were meeting her, it doesn’t take a genius. I don't know why you still care for dating, though. It sounds tedious. If you would have just asked me before, I could have saved you a trip into the city center and the money you spend on her for dinner. Actually, I am shocked you haven't made sure she was worth your while. Or…” Sherlock sat straight up on the couch and shook his hand dismissively, a sardonic smile on his lips.
John was having trouble breathing when he finished and his voice had broken on the last word. He’d deliberately chosen what he said because, for once, he wanted to hurt. He wanted to hurt Sherlock the way the other had hurt him and wanted to show how much pain he had caused him.
They bickered affectionately for a few minutes, bathing in each other’s attention. Sharing chaste but by no means less enthusiastic kisses. But then Sherlock’s forehead contorted and John watched him recall something that had happened last night.
“Don’t be nervous, this is not a rejection, Sherlock,” John simply says but there is a trace of tension in his body now. “We will do whatever you want but it should all wait until the case is wrapped. I want you to think about it when your head is clear again, I am not imposing myself on you while you cannot afford to be too distracted. This isn't just a fling.” Maybe it’s just a trick of the light but, abruptly, John’s eyes go dark when he takes a deep breath and chuckles, voice deep and all Sherlock can do is
Sinking back into the hot water whose steam had already totally obscured both mirror and window pane he was feeling more or less peaceful for the first time after he left the hospital. Of course he’d pondered Sherlock and their situation and everything, it was only natural. His thoughts had flown back to both the small wooden box and its potential meaning and their kiss and almost-kiss more or less on its own. He terribly missed the other man and their easy, comfortable relationship now that his head felt clear and he was relaxing in the tub, engulfed in foam, pleasant smell and hot water. Giving in to his imagination. There was no denying the longing his body ached with. Somehow the words “Sherlock”, “romantic issue” and “desire” had become mixed together in an indistinguishable form. He thought about touching himself for a moment but then dropped it, because it didn’t feel adequate and would only have offered the wrong kind of reconciliation. It wasn’t just sexual desire, it was more, so much more. He knew that now for sure even though he didn’t know what to do with it. And he didn’t know if it was wise to bring it to Sherlock’s attention.
The natural attraction between them, the little bouts of affection they show each other in everyday-life - a touch on the shoulder, a brush of fingers over tea mugs, hovering closer together over a file or the newspaper than the situation necessitates, a half-flirty smile when Sherlock is brilliant and John calls him so - it is undeniable. Life with John is just so interesting and comfortable, Sherlock muses, more comfortable that it has ever been with anyone. More comfortable than it had been with Victor, for whose affection he constantly had to battle only to spectacularly loose the fight and be left behind. In the secrecy of his mind Sherlock likes to entertain the thought that John will always be around. Sadly, it is also a fact that Sherlock isn’t sure John’s taste actually runs in his direction. They have spent so many years together and yet Sherlock is yet to secure ample proof of John’s general inclination. However, if it weren’t for the constant buzz in his guts that’s driving him round the bend, the constant yearning to reach out, grasp and hold close what he wants to be his, it wouldn’t actually matter. He’d take it all in stride while just being John’s friend if he could be sure John never leaves.
John chuckled, trying to mask his sudden interest with friendly concern, leaned towards Sherlock and put his elbows on his own knees.
, John,” Sherlock chastises coyly and John licks his lips and rolls his eyes. He gently skims his hands upwards again, brushing the other nipple. “That’s your opinion
It’s no explosives that’s hidden in a patch of silk. Instead there is a small creamy envelope of finest stationery, sealed by wax… and a single light purple foxglove.
John swallowed heavily against a lump in his throat that wouldn’t disappear and he gaped at Sherlock, opening his mouth only to close it again. Did Sherlock really just say that? And mean what John thought he meant? It was too easy to hope. One never knew with Sherlock. John’s chest felt tight. Because he just wanted to believe him. With all his heart. Be weak and just believe him.
“I apologize, Dr. Watson. I trust you are alright.”
John looked from the man to Sherlock and back to the man, who was grinning widely now.
Sherlock clears his throat.
They kiss for endless seconds without letting it tumble into more, content with each other when John’s phone that he’s kept in the pockets of his jeans chimes with a text. John isn’t fazed and leans further up and into Sherlock, though it’s an awkward position the way he’s perched in Sherlock’s lap, back curved and all weight on his right arm. Then the phone chimes again and Sherlock breaks the kiss, but hovers closely. “You don’t want to get that?”
“Does it? Well, then let me show you a 10 before something else gets in the way… If you like…”
“Is that why we took this case?”
Sherlock’s cold fingers touched John’s lower lip and John’s body reacted instantly by automatically gripping Sherlock’s wrist, holding it into place. Sherlock continued to stare into John’s eyes, his hand slowly cupping his face. He was so close it would have taken no afford at all to-
There was nothing sweet about their kiss, and the way Sherlock pressed him to his chest and held him tightly made John think of a drowning man clinging on to dear life.
Molly is off in her office, which means they are alone and since there is nothing Sherlock can do about the Valentine-flower-conundrum at the moment - and he decidedly
It only takes a moment for John to take over and Sherlock once more bows to sentiment and expertise that is just so much greater than his own. John makes a rather musical noise as he tugs Sherlock - chest and legs and hips and
“Maybe we should make you eat a sandwich to put you back into order. And then you need a shower – and clean clothes.” John is oblivious to Sherlock’s revelations and suddenly giggles like a smitten teenager. He palpates Sherlock’s arms fondly. His eyes are still shining and Sherlock’s gaucheness dissipates. He steps closer and lets his hands rest around John’s elbows, a tad sheepish.
is just ridiculous. So who has?
“I wouldn’t exactly call if afraid. But superstition mostly has a true piece to it. You cannot be sure it wouldn’t have been bad if I hadn’t clinked glasses so many times in the past.”
It is hilarious and irritating the way his skin prickles when he can feel John glancing at him. Oh, it isn’t like John never looked at him in the first place, of course. John always does when they are around each other - that’s non-disputable. He looks him straight in the eyes, confidently, self-centered, in a way only John can. It’s natural, mind, it’s what people do when they are around others, Sherlock muses. Humans look at each other. But it is not only social conformity and decency; it is also navigation, self-defense and assessment. Sherlock certainly knows how and where to look. And what to look for. He makes a living by looking, deducing, seeing things no one else notices. He knows he’s very good at it, effective, though usually not part of the setting, one might say. He knows how to calculate from afar, taking no part on his own whatsoever.
“I HAVE BEEN PATIENT FOR TWO BLOODY YEARS. BEING PATIENT WITH YOU WILL TAKE ME TO AN EARLY GRAVE. NOT THAT YOU WOULD KNOW…”
Now that he is hurrying through the hallways towards the right door, it comes to him that John’s room is comfortably located on the first landing. It used to be basically a lumber-room right next to the one where he keeps his knowledge about tobacco ash. But when he opens the wide double wing door now he has to admit that, over the time he’s spent with John, the room has turned into a spacious apartment. It contains everything he’s ever connected to or thought of John.
"Because it's all gone cold hours ago."
Sherlock pursed his lips, his features momentarily blank. But then he smiled mockingly and a soft glimmer appeared in his eyes.
Molly regards them with eyes as wide as saucers when Sherlock opens the door to the lab, John trudging behind him.
The mysterious card and digitalis flower from yesterday that he still hasn’t the first idea about who’d sent it to him notwithstanding; receiving John’s present means he can at least finally solve
Sherlock went first, running into the dark alley in front of the storehouse, and vanished into darkness a second later. When no screams or shots came, John began to follow.
John smiles back at him. It’s a bit lopsided but when he mock-rolls his eyes, Sherlock can actually see John is proud. Which makes Sherlock proud and his heart flies out to the doctor. They smile at each other fondly, John’s eyes start to shine and Sherlock thinks how friendship is indeed such a very weird thing. You walk along the path of life, dismissing people left, right and center because they are boring, dull and generally morons, until something changes and you meet someone random. Someone who turns out to be worth a second glance and you pick out that random human and decide that
John’s tongue comes forward to dab his lips.
"To social stupidity and other stuff I don't need to understand."
“How can you know? There’re enough people out there who clearly hold a grudge against you, maybe someone’s out for revenge of some sort.”
There might have been some same-sex interests in John’s previous life. In fact, Sherlock is downright positive John has made experience while in the army. However, that time has long since passed and Sherlock doesn’t know about the nature of said experiences. Doesn’t know whether these haven’t only happened out of convenience. Men, alone in the desert among enemy forces, constantly under threat against body and psyche. Sentiments of any kind must have run wild. That’s why Sherlock is convinced certain encounters have indeed happened.
“John, my name is hardly a counter argument, so stop using it as such. We’re going to Bart’s.”
Contrast again.
, exactly
Sherlock opens his mouth but finds that no sound comes out. He tries again but all the oxytocin must finally have unfurled its damaging effect on his active lexis.
The CD itself looks unscathed and Sherlock leaves his chair to put it into their stereo. He briefly wonders why they even have a stereo but John must have brought it with him when he moved in.
“Why would you text with Molly? She was
Sherlock instantly raised his hand to his mouth, furiously rubbing at his chin. John wasn’t sure if he actually saw a faint red covering his pale cheeks, because he was so covered in dust.
Maybe that was why Sherlock avoided him. It was a mess. But Sherlock was his best friend and they had to make up at some point or John could never be happy again. They had already wasted too much time.
Sherlock employs his thesis now at their breakfast table by turning sideways and fumbling his phone out of the pockets of his dressing gown. He decidedly doesn’t look at John and feigns mental absence and there it happens again. John peeps towards him around the rim of his newspaper and Sherlock has to hide a smile in his teacup again.
He is still panting and his ribcage feels so tight that his hand has to clutch at his heart to keep it from fluttering out of his chest.
"Come on, John! Let's go out and have the real fun!"
Two words that can hold an entire universe. John’s eyes are dancing and his answer is full of heat  - full of promises.
Sherlock’s answering smile was wide and breathless, his eyes sparkling.
“Tea?” he asks and the moment is instantly broken, time is moving again and John steps into the kitchen to put the kettle on.
“I don’t like being lied to,” he snapped at Sherlock and shoved his hands into the pockets of his trousers to stop them from shaking.
In an instant his world became mute and he felt his blood pressure rise. His soldier mode kicked in.
Sherlock let his shoulders slump down, and when he spoke, his voice came out in a whisper.
“Yes, god-- yes.”
He wants to lay himself at John’s feet and for once let someone else solves the puzzle, because he‘s failed where his shyness, his awkwardness  outwits his intellect.
Despite the white-hot anger and disappointment that’s coiling in his stomach, Sherlock finds himself snorting and out of the corner of his eyes he notices John staring at him.
As he looks at John now, all smiles, soft eyes and enticing cologne, he concludes that he may not know what John appreciates in a romantic partner but if his requirements could be met within their life together at 221b, Sherlock would do his utmost to meet them.
John rolls his eyes at him. “Yes, okay,
It took John a moment to start processing.
“Tea would be good.”
Lestrade had stayed for half an hour, telling them about the condition of the storehouse the drug lab had been in. Syringes, dirt and packages of medication had littered the floor. John had repeatedly glanced at Sherlock from the corner of his eyes, but Sherlock had said nothing. John had grown increasingly worried. When Lestrade had made Donovan bring two cups of decent tea, it hadn’t beneath her to show how much she had hated waiting on them.
“This one isn’t, I am afraid,” John mumbles, somewhat resentfully, and rather under his breath, before checking his mobile and clenching his jaw. “Someone isn’t.”
“I need to see your arms. Now.”
At some point waiting had become utterly intolerable and Sherlock had written John a message to ask if he was alright. He’d been happy like a smitten teenager when John texted back a minute later.
“Dear, how do you look? Are you fine? Sherlock has told me everything.”
"Two scoops of sugar, three stirs, spoon is in the cup, now will you put your feet off the coffee table, the eyeballs alone are indecent enough."
He cleared his throat.
Sherlock looked up to him and when John didn’t answer he put his hands onto John’s hips and pushed them both a little upright so they could look at each properly.
A memory flashed through his mind like a snippet from a movie sequence. How Sherlock had looked at him, so pained and awkward, before he’d grabbed him behind that batch of trash and put their lips together and hold him tight.
Sherlock was obviously losing patience with his older brother, and Mycroft made no effort of hiding just how much he enjoyed it.
Rushing to the door, Sherlock doesn’t turn to check whether John follows and for a moment he is unsure whether he wants him to. Then quiet footfalls echo behind him and he’s relieved of the decision. In the pockets of his coat his hands shake around the objects where he’s grabbed them.
With these words, he pulled a small dark object from the insides of his suit jacket and tossed it onto John’s bed. Taking it in his hand, he was surprised to see his phone again - the one Sherlock had dumped into the gutter after he had called Lestrade and his people. Sherlock bristled at the sight of John’s phone. He and Mycroft were still standing in front of the bed, rocking back and forth in their verbal exchange.
Their hips slotted together and John heavily cursed the presence of their trousers in his mind.
They stared at each other in exasperation, but then Sherlock’s face turned blank again as he shook his head. All energy immediately left John’s body. He lowered his head as defeat washed through him, his voice becoming quiet.
Sherlock enters the sitting room the second Lestrade opens the door. The man is totally out of breath, his hair windswept and out of the window Sherlock can see a car waiting at the kerb. They stare at each other for a second and a part of Sherlock is glad somehow they’ve only shared kisses, sweet words and caresses in the dark, so there are no secrets that can be pried from him now.
John’s brain felt dull and he was taken aback when he noticed how his heart had started to beat in double speed. Sherlock had checked on him while he was sleeping in his bedroom. Sherlock had never been to his bedroom before. As far as he knew. One never really knew with Sherlock, though.
The mechanics are clear, easy, but somehow strange and abhorrent. They all seem to lack something vital and he has never felt so reduced to his bodily functions before. Self-assessment notwithstanding, his ‘partners’ were all of a certain type; keen both on easy sex and never seeing him again afterwards. They had expected a performance and he had delivered.
“Imperious and arrogant does suit you better, Sherlock.”
"And outweighing all my options made me see reason. I figured-- you wouldn’t take it too good if I kept secrets-- or restrains. So I don’t keep them anymore. I have to warn you, though. I don’t have a dating history and therefore it is beyond me to know how this is to be done properly but don’t think I am not comfortable here.”
“Full English, is it? I see you also made eggs. Oh, and bacon.”
He extended his arm in John's general direction, making a hurrying gesture. John shook his head.
He pulls John closer, presses his face into the hollow behind his ear, his scent all around him and feels his own heart thudding in his throat. He doesn’t know for how much he is really up to now - it’s all really overwhelming, to say the least - but after another moment he takes John’s hand and intertwining their fingers he pushes them away from the kitchen counter.
“I know what you’ve been hoping for,” Sherlock says hotly, hackles rising, because he can only imagine too well, “and I am sorry you didn’t get it, I am sorry the day didn’t exactly live up to your expectations.”
Maybe it’s the confusion of the last fortnight along with the emotional upheaval of constantly missing John the last six days and the urgent chase through the sewers that has jangled his nerves but the whole tableau really gets to him. His pulse is buzzing with useless restlessness, his breath very loud in his ears.
The conundrum of how and
"Yes, Sherlock," John interrupted him and suppressed an impatient flicker as he looked back at Sherlock who stepped to his side in front of the restaurant in central London.
The mind palace consists of a very logical system. To aid and ensure remembrance Sherlock has built it to resemble a very spacious mansion and every room has its own purpose. That also applies to their respective furniture, shape and style. It is like being in the place for real, seeing and touching real things, absorbing real information.
But this,
Thanx to my wonderful beta-reader Kisa.
Gently, so as not to disturb Sherlock, who had his back to him and was swaying lightly to the sound of his own playing, he shrugged out of his jacket to hang it on the hat stand next to the door. His gaze fell upon Sherlock’s coat and he grabbed the muddied sleeve without thinking. An idea formed in his brain and checking again whether Sherlock’s attention was still elsewhere John thoroughly searched his pockets. He was relieved when his hands came up empty.
Such a long time since I last updated, sorry sorry. I've been so busy with a new project, "Glances", that I plan to post as soon as I am able.
He saw Sherlock nod.
John gets him out of the cab and guides him into the flat, his hand on the small of his back and when Sherlock tumbles into his chair John wordlessly goes into the kitchen to make tea. Sherlock instantly misses the stability John’s touch has offered and feels boneless and clamped like a rag doll.
, parameters have to be adjusted but every time Sherlock has conducted an experiment and found himself in the heat of it - propped up against another body in a similar context that leaves little room for imagination - he’d been out of his pants by now. It’s how these things go. So... Can it be that John doesn't want him
Sherlock suddenly had his phone in his hand and John saw its bluish glow turn Sherlock’s features ghostlike. His brain clicked, coming to the right solution. Sherlock saw, and tilted his head once into a curt nod.
“Well, the circumstances required a blatant act of restriction.”
, while they were handcuffed and had to make a fast escape. The gist of it all is that they are comfortable around each other and Sherlock has never ever before imagined that touching John Watson could be such a highly confusing and tempting affair. It certainly wasn’t when they were handcuffed and that has been the closest they’ve ever physically come into their respective private spaces.
“John— “
towards him. John’s small but sturdy hand is right next to his on the table, fingers twitching in the obvious and barely contained need to reach out and touch, and when his gaze flicks towards his mouth in formidable interest, Sherlock is lost at sea…
Dismissing that particular mystery for the time being he turns the card, hums, and holds it up to the fading light. He’s somewhat disappointed when there is nothing to detect. No hidden message, no watermarking, just ordinary stationery, though heavily expensive, lacerated fancily around the edges and with tiny leafy filaments that are just a tad darker than the rest of the paper.
John doesn’t seem to mind because he tips his head back and smiles, his eyes ablaze with light. “That I do, and have for a very long time. We don’t need to discuss this at lengths, Sherlock, I am sure you’d rather we didn’t but...” John trails off but then squares his jaw in determination and Sherlock finds he’s actually holding his breath.
"We are here because Scotland Yard wants to celebrate the capture of those drug sellers with us."
Sherlock gasps in exaggerated horror. “God, beware, they will attempt to think and I will be annoyed.”
John shifts a bit. “You’ve said my thinking is annoying, too.”
“Good. I won’t ask how you know my code.”
Living with Sherlock as a flatmate had always come easy to him. John had never minded his experiments cluttering their kitchen table, his playing the violin at ungodly hours, his general annoyance with the world, his particular shade on the autistic spectrum. How he himself never ceased to be amazed by Sherlock’s direct and on-the-spot deductions. How Sherlock shared the teensy exceptions, the tiny things he didn’t get right by 100% with John only. John had idolized him greatly, there was no denying it.
“We cannot outrun them, John, we have to hide.”
Sherlock nods absent-mindedly but keeps silent. They way Lestrade eyes him suggest he wants to ask more questions and even though he abhores the pity and implied concern for his own personal circumstances Sherlock somehow cannot find it in him to brush him off. Best get it over with.
John’s voice is hoarse and soothing, thick with sentiment and no small portion of arousal when he speaks. His words are unexpected, though and Sherlock wonders if the sudden anxiety he feels plays out on his face and if that’s what makes John choose his words. “You need to go back to sleep, Sherlock. It’s still nighttime.” John exhales with great care and it feels like there might be more to say that he’s choosing not to now before he briefly shuts his eyes to restrain himself and propels them onto their sides, facing each other.
“Yeah, come on, before he comes back around.”
Sherlock nodded, lifted the gun off the floor, and checked the magazine. It proved to be empty, and they exchanged a look. John straightened his back and held his breath, motioning for Sherlock to keep quiet. They had to be quick now.
“Mycroft, of course I shouldn’t be surprised to see you--”
“Why, Mycroft, do you believe I can be of any help to you? It’s killing me not to know what is behind it all, because Moriarty was dead before Sherlock decided to fake his suicide. But I thank you for telling me you had your hands in all of what happened afterwards.”
It is a rainy Thursday afternoon close to sunset and John is still at the clinic when Sherlock drops into his armchair. He pushes his wet curls out of his face before steepling his fingers under his chin. The solution of his current case sits just frustratingly out of arm’s reach but he is unable to grasp it. He knows he’s overlooking a specific detail but it all just doesn’t make sense. It’s maddening and he flashes out of his chair again to pace the room. He cannot consult with John, it might be another two hours before John comes home and until he does Sherlock is left alone with a problem he has next to no knowledge about and has never encountered before:
“So you’re hiding something.”
Count on Lestrade to be completely oblivious. John clenched his fist around his glass of champagne and hoped the ever omni-observing detective hadn’t been eavesdropping.
“Yes, but you mustn’t worry, John…”
When all the tedious wrapping is finally gone, John’s smile abruptly expires. Which is not a development Sherlock has anticipated. John isn’t supposed to look grim if Sherlock can help it. He frowns.
“Ah,” Greg lifts his hands and snaps back into DI mode. “Official matters. We had this corpse that has been washed ashore near Vauxhall Bridge. Anderson thinks he’s been poisoned and I am here to see if Molly can confirm that theory.”
“What is it you don’t do? What scares you so? Look, it’s me you’re talking to, not some twat from off the streets. Me!”
“I am not scared by you, John,” Sherlock whispers and immediately feels vulnerable and raw in front of those blue eyes.
“I do,” John says, abruptly, and all Sherlock can do to save face is shove away his musings, shape up and roll his eyes dramatically. “Yes, but we all know you enjoy a challenge and you’re hardly normal in any definition yourself.”

say anything, gives voice to his feelings, his attraction and, inevitably, his unsuitability and uncertainties, if he lays himself bare at John’s feet, there is a distinctive chance that John might leave. Or let him down, which would make things less final but more awkward and probably result in John leaving in the long run. That way only darkness lies and Sherlock actually dreads to face the consequences of a life without his conductor of light. Two years he’d waited to be with John again and resume their former life at Baker Street and so far they are doing a pretty good job of it. However, Sherlock knows he wants more and biding his time until a moment that might as well never come is just excruciating.
A third man stepped into his field of vision when they reached a low door under the stairs. The next moment, a fist connected with John’s jaw. His knees buckled and he fell to the floor, seeing stars.
“I suggest you’d better hurry solve that case now.”
John smiled.
, evidently, that’s the most exciting and captivating person around? John doesn’t think he is amazing, though, despite repetitive evidence to the contrary, and Sherlock has always wondered why.
as an excuse to finally get a move on is hilarious and downright pathetic, even for you.”
Sherlock is basically thrumming with anticipation when he snaps on nitrile gloves, extents nimble fingers and delicately snatches the envelope out of the box. He is careful to touch it as little as possible so he can check it for fingerprints later. John is watching him closely, poised for either fight or flight, attack or defensive protection. Whichever first comes in handy, Sherlock supposes and the prospect excites him more than is prudent.
Mycroft’s slim fingers encircled the hot coffee cup, holding it at a graceful angle. John was instantly reminded of Sherlock’s delicate hands and how the other man had touched him only two days ago. Scowling, he turned to the window.
“Well, if you insist…” Sherlock says around biting and licking at John’s thumb, pursing his lips while his tongue presses against calloused skin and he is thrilled to note John’s cock jumping at his ministrations.
"Let’s not get this champagne go to waste,” he announced and Sherlock gave John one of his long-suffering-looks.
"Just the thing to distract me from my night's ordeal. That was a message from my homeless' network.”
John looks at him intently and Sherlock snaps back into focus. “I won’t,” he hears John declare. “I am perfectly content, Sherlock.” Lifting the other hand to Sherlock’s face as well and cradling his jaw, he smiles. “Any other questions?”
Sherlock was steepling his fingers under his chin, talking very fast.
“Well,
He took another phone out of his jacket and passed it over for Sherlock to take. It was obviously his. Sherlock hissed, but Mycroft didn’t let that disturb him much.
“But the physician didn’t have to stitch up the wound, so they just bandaged it. You should be fine again by tomorrow.”
He just couldn’t help himself when it started and soon he was falling headfirst into one sensory picture after another, his control magnificently slipping into the void of John’s empty seat next to him. The realms of the mind are certainly curious.
In his heart John is a generous and gentle person, surprisingly smart and witty, socially competent and very easy to like. His presence has made Sherlock's work a lot easier, made dealing with Anderson and the likes considerably more agreeable. However, Sherlock has also seen John’s dark side - when his face is drawn into stressed lines, his eyes fierce, his voice low and his hands clutched into fists. The way he gets angry, his eyes dark and flat.
“I wrote him a message.”
“Why don’t you two answer your bloody phones?” Lestrade asks, clearly distracted by Sherlock’s state of undress but trying not to let it show. There are holes beneath the seams of his night shirt where it meets his throat and pelvis. No time to stop and don a dressing gown. Sherlock bristles. “Slept” he offers gruffly by way of an elaborate explanation. He stalls the next question that is blooming in the puzzled look Lestrade grants him with by narrowing his eyes sternly. “Why didn’t you knock?”
John abruptly turns back to him and tries hard not to purse his lips. After a moment of awkward hesitation he nods. Once.
Well, then again, maybe the other man already knew and that was why they’d argued so much, or rather John asked questions and Sherlock ignored him. He didn’t know if Sherlock was interested in that sort of thing in the first place but thinking back to their conversation about dating he was positive that at least Sherlock’s experiences in that field were terribly limited. If they existed at all. Not that the thought bothered him greatly. He’d be surprised if it wasn’t as it apparently presented itself. John was also a little surprised that the homosexual touch of it was no great matter to him. It wasn’t as if he was interested in men in general, he was solely interested in Sherlock.
Sherlock has believed a shift in their relationship to be of a totally different design. He’s always assumed John would leave 221B and him at some point to get married and have a family. Like any normal human would do. His dating habits surely lead to that conclusion. Sherlock silently thanks god or whatever deity above he doesn’t actually believe in that he is not normal. Being normal would only be dull and undesirable and of course interfere with The Work. His own priorities are different but that’s the way he likes it, where he feels save and confident. Where he gets his input from. He knows he’d never go and change that.
“You had to have proof I was irrevocably dead. So you could let it be and move on. You could say it was an act of loyalty.”
John pinches the bridge of his nose and the same complicated look Sherlock has detected earlier comes back into his eyes. “Sherlock has been given an anonymous Valentine’s Day present,” he says, looking at Molly, who looks downright shaken now.
They sit in silence for a few minutes while Sherlock sips his tea. It is so hot it’s scalding but that’s how he likes it. He uses the sleeve of his dressing gown to wipe at a spare drop that’s sliding down the cup and tucks his naked feet under him in the chair. Out of the corner of his eyes he scrutinizes John but the other man is engrossed in the papers and doesn’t pay him much attention.
“Just a bunch of “friends” celebrating an event, how lovely.”
“Oh, Sherlock… You are…”
“Greg, it’s John.”
“Are you still bored? I am working on this case, a lost woman, her boyfriend turned up dead a few days ago, care to come with me?”
“Don’t be daft, you know I am not driving in a police car.” Sherlock says, giving him an iconic long-suffering sigh. "Two hours top today, we'll talk to the cabbie, but I am sure the tunnel where he's hidden the second body is also the place he killed the first. You and your
Now that that’s been settled, Sherlock thinks gleefully, he doesn’t have to grumbly clamp his mouth shut and swallow a caustic retort when Mrs. Hudson loudly presumes they live in sin. Because, clearly, now they do and it’s glorious.
Sherlock’s hands had stayed above the waistline at first but when John had grabbed a handful of his arse and had given it a proper squeeze, flushing heavily himself, his ears burning, Sherlock had gasped and reciprocated. With equal results.
There is still no trace of the young woman, though and Sherlock is hawk-like. If her boyfriend has been the victim of a fatal crime chances are she has been as well. Trepidation runs high with urgency by the time they check in with Lestrade and his team again before returning to the sewers, this time with the whole NSY crew to cover more ground.
There is a notion of an idea tucked into the cerebral gyri of his brain a moment later as he regards his crotch with a mixture of mental detachment, fascination and pique.
“I thought about texting you, believe me. I thought about it so many times back then,” John heard the other whisper and he sounded so unsure, so very vulnerable and unlike himself, that John lifted his head a bit and touched his cheek to Sherlock’s in an attempt to reassure him and ease his pain a bit.
especially without proper shoes, but he pirouettes again just for the sheer joy of it. He’d be quite a good dancer had he only proceeded taking classes but once word had got out he’d seen some serious bullying that has kept him back. He regrets it now, 23 years later in 221B’s music filled sitting room. Regrets how he’s let self-consciousness and cowardice keep him from something he’s really wanted when all of a sudden firm hands grab around his waist and at his chest and force him to stop twirling abruptly.
“No, it didn’t, Sherlock, but I guess you running after every half-cooked mystery that presents itself is just something I cannot change.” Fuming, John crosses his arms in front of his chest and glares up at Sherlock.
Where functionality is the main parameter, replaceability is an unchallenged necessity. According to that thesis, social or emotional entanglement is either tedious and not desirable or simply hurts and since most people are intolerable tosser Sherlock, at some point, has simply given up on other people and the potentialities their company had to offer to him. It had always suited him just fine, thank you very much.
When John had awoken, Sherlock’s arm was draped over his stomach, his curls wild and his face relaxed in slumber. The alarm clock had shown him that it was only eight o’clock in the morning and John had spent the best part of a delightful hour watching Sherlock sleep. It was really hard not to feel peaceful and when the lurching of his own heart was anything to go by, John knew that he had never been so happy in a very long time.
Which is just intolerable. No matter the delicacy, John and his sentiments, or lack thereof, shouldn’t be allowed to frighten him so much. To render him helpless, a delicate flower in a strong gust of wind. Anger curdles his stomach because he simply cannot give all his control away and let someone else be in charge. He’s spent years suppressing the darkness that entails a threat to his emotional equilibrium and he isn’t Sherlock Holmes, the great detective that sees everything and can entertain deductions with even the tiniest scrap of data, for nothing. He may not be able to circumvent confirming their status quo and find out if it all goes to hell once he declares himself, but he can certainly make sure John declares first. Or at least gives him enough information to conclude if it’s all worth the effort, the pain in his chest and the yearning buzz in his guts, and where exactly he stands. If Sherlock can coax John into revealing enough, then maybe he’ll be able to protect what’s his. Even if what’s his is just a scrap of pitted dignity.
“Oh, John, that’s…” Molly starts but immediately shuts off at a look from John. She pulls her lab coat closer around her shoulders, her face carefully blank, then turns to encompass Sherlock. “Okay, where do you want me to start?”
“Ready when you are.”
John’s voice is calm and soothing and this time Sherlock nods slowly, disentangles himself from their embrace and all the potentialities it stands for. It is no real surprise in a fortnight of surprises one of the hardest and most distasteful things Sherlock has ever come across is acting on the inevitability of taking a simple but much needed shower now.
“My god, I never knew you had such passion in you, John.”
Sherlock rests a protective hand over John’s waist, drinking in his warmth and scent and feels so cozy and right where he belongs that he is asleep again within ten minutes.
He’s been there before, looking into Victor’s dark, bottomless eyes, and back then had decided differently. Some 10 years ago he’d met him at university and, yes, Sherlock has had all the vital experiences people have when they fall in love with someone. The glow, the giddiness, the emotional rush. The physicality. But then Victor had turned on him, had told Sherlock he’d tired of him before unceremoniously dumping him. All had fallen apart around him and when every bit of the inglorious aftermath had finally been over - which had happened with great amounts of delirious pain, depression, drugs and scars on his side of the equation - Sherlock was done with that particular aspect of humanity and hasn’t deemed it iterative in any way, shape or form. One-time encounters are totally out of the equation as they won‘t help in terms of loneliness
“Sherlock, are you alright?”
“But engaging with anyone only mildly attractive into said activities without the excuse of love positively is a chemical defect and here we are at the beginning again. These chemical dysfunctions and defects are trivial and therefor really not my area. And I say that as a chemist. How can you properly judge situation and circumstances when impulses and hormones are chasing each other in your body and you end up losing control?”
to see to the practicable things first. No matter how high the adrenaline rises - and John is a junky who will always go for the rush - whenever there is a delay in the plan or they need to take a bit of time to recalculate, John, as an ironclad rule, provides tea. Tea and food and warmth and comfort. However, at the moment Sherlock doesn’t care about either. His frustration with both the case and his emotional state is so palpable, he’s radiating waves of genuine distress and the way John has handled him since they found the body tells him John knows there is something going on that is absurdly out of the ordinary.
Sherlock can feel his face do something really peculiar and then his lips are on John’s again. It is a bit clumsy at first but soon becomes slow and intense and this time it is all his. There is a give and take - and a rhythm along with that delicious beat against his mouth that makes his body hum with sweetness, anticipation and electricity.
John could feel Sherlock tense up. Then the detective bumped his knee on John’s as he turned to him.
“No, don’t sit on the floor, Sherlock.  You’ll get too cold. Come here.”
“I was afraid you’d say that.”
Sherlock’s ears go very pink as John presses all of his body unabashedly to his for a moment. Both his hands cup around Sherlock’s arse, thus making Sherlock’s skin tingle and break out into sweating.
There is nothing they can do.
can take over if it remains to be as boring as it has been so far.” He huffs with annoyance, trusts in Lestrade to catch the air quotes and presses on so Lestrade won’t ask questions. “Make Molly re-check the amount of blood at the scene, then text me. Don't call. I will presumably be very busy later on so don't waste precious time now. John?”
. Sherlock fumes in distress and instinctually turns away from John, a sense of betrayal curling in his guts. He glares at the DI, chin held high and stubborn and wishes the man would just shut up and not fan the flames any further.
“Who gave you the package?” Sherlock inquires, if only to distract John temporarily from checking his phone again and looking so put out and miserable. Which isn’t at all what he wants. Sherlock still hasn’t done anything but John doesn’t smile anymore. He prefers John smiling, eyes scintillating and alight with happiness.
How would it feel without all that fabric between them, how would it be to take John’s hands in his own and trap them over his head on the mattress. To whisper romantic profanities into his ears and watch him respond to them. To hold him down and just
“Can we leave, then?” John asks and drains the dregs of his own drink. There is still a palpable amount of tension in him, and when John’s phone chimes a fourth time since they’ve come here, Sherlock waves a hand at him, grateful for the reprieve.
There it is again, the glance. Twice in just a few minutes. Sherlock notices he’s feeling hot again, increasingly hot and all his self-control just immediately goes out of the window.
"You were saying earlier?"
John looks bemusedly at him. “I’ve just gotten a mail from- oh, my god, I don’t believe it. Radio-silence yesterday and now this. I’ve been checking my mobile all day yesterday.”
He looked at Sherlock, who had slid down next to him, eyes closed, curls matted to his sweaty forehead. Everything was quiet around them, the only sound was their labored breathing. When Sherlock opened his eyes again, John couldn’t look away. It suddenly hit him that they might not live to tell the tale this time.
John pecks it affectionately. “We
“I didn’t know you'd ever— “, Sherlock hears himself saying but finds he cannot come up with a conclusion for his sentence. John shakes his head and saves him from his own inaptitude.
“It’s not explosives.”
Sherlock smiles again and is momentarily nonplussed by how warm his chest feels where John touched him and how out-worldly good that is. Excitement pools into his belly and it’s due to both, excitement about the new lead in that dreadful murder case
“Well”, John steps closer again, shoulders devoid of their former tension, and leans onto the counter next to Sherlock. “Who knows?”
“Yeah. We should. For once we should.” John’s voice is low and firm, his breath ghosts over Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock immediately loses it and simply has to lean in and press his cheek to John’s.
“No, how clever you are.”
Sherlock is feeling very cozy but as he gets more awake, his mind comes back on-line and immediately has to battle two very different sets of problems.
They had just texted once two day ago and John had gone to bed early. While half waiting for Sherlock to show up at some point and half trying to ignore his longing for him to just do so, he had fallen asleep and had dreamed weird things again. Impressions of green and orange light interspersed with the smell of chloroform and cold smoke.
It didn’t help matters that Sherlock either thought he deserved the rough treatment John showed towards him when frustration and insecurity were just too strong to hold back. Or maybe Sherlock simply didn’t care. Sometimes he would sit in their living room, though, entirely focused on something John couldn’t see, face completely blank. Or he would spend hours in his mind palace, flipping his hands through empty air and John had to move their furniture out of his way. John mused how this was connected to whatever it was that Sherlock had done while he was away. Perhaps it was just his own personal way of fighting his demons and John found that making him play the violin usually helped.
“I had to deal with everything alone, Sherlock,” he lashed out.
And Sherlock Holmes doesn’t do guessing.
When he gets home Mrs. Hudson is in the hallway, arms indecently full of spring flowers and a giant smile on her face. Sherlock’s mood instantly tumbles towards bottom line. “Will you look at that, Sherlock,” she coos and practically sticks the flowers in his face. “Mr. Chatterjee is just so wonderful, such a gentleman-“
John’s smile morphs into a bright chuckle while the twinkle in his eyes becomes positively blinding and suddenly there is a spark between them. Teetering for and back on his heels, John says “I know you’re not. You’ll like it though, I am sure. But I am afraid you will have to wait a bit longer.”
When they were gone, there was an odd moment of silence before Sherlock rose and sat on the side of John’s bed again that he had abandoned before. John thought of their kiss when Sherlock’s weight shook the bed, but Lestrade’s visit and his description of the drug lab, along with his own imagination of Sherlock buying material there, had considerably sobered him.
“I didn’t know if it was enough for you. I-- I didn’t know I’d miss you so much-- need you so much. But when I came back you were so angry and I wanted to make you feel at ease first and then maybe-- when I had won your trust again--“
His fingers hovered over the still open message field and he texted the next words in a rush to just get them off his heart.
All the data he has so far collected about John lead to two possible courses of action: If Sherlock
“That’s a nice thing to say, dear. I don’t want to interfere with your life, but you must know, whatever your… little domestic was about---“
. But he just cannot get himself to ask. Cannot make himself take the plunge. A part of him balks at the sentiment, the cowardice but it is nothing in comparison to the crushing feeling behind his sternum that reminds him of how much he’d missed ballet classes when he was eight.
John realized his thoughts had gone a little astray as was their habit lately when Sherlock was close. It was an irritating mix of restless and frustrating anger and blood swirling concern, intersected with an insecurity he hadn’t known before and this new territory terrified him greatly. He was in control most of the time now, though, after he had completely lost it when Sherlock reappeared in front of a little pub John liked to have his lunch at one day. He’d nearly broken Sherlock’s nose in the process. Once he was alone in his flat afterwards he had cried, a whole new experience for him, but it had washed most of the shock from his system. To the world punching Sherlock in his dishy face still seemed an appropriate reaction, though. A reaction John had felt strangely proud of afterwards.
“Moving on didn’t work for me.”
John nodded and lifted his hand to stroke over Sherlock shoulder down onto his back and arse. He’d gotten his proper look at Sherlock’s glorious backside last night and the memory made him smile. He’d for sure be smiling a lot today.
“What faceless female, Sherlock?” John inquires again, sharply, and when Sherlock still doesn’t answer, he surges forward and grabs his wrist. Sherlock has a sudden flashback to how John has grabbed his wrist earlier in their sitting room to keep him from handling presumed explosives. He swallows and forces his face into a blank mask.
“Sherlock, you know, sometimes I think you’re only putting up with me so you don’t actually have to talk to people. Or be nice to them.”
“We’ll be there, Greg. Good to hear you got that guy.”
— I fell for you.”
Just a week ago Molly had told him the same when Sherlock had been to the morgue with him, fussing over the body of a teenager supposedly killed by adulterated drugs their suspects had sold. She had been waiting for Sherlock to go about his business and asked John to the kitchen for coffee, both knowing it would take Sherlock at least half an hour before he was satisfied with the results of Molly’s examination on the bodies. John had felt completely dumbfounded when she stated how pleased she was to see them back together. It must have been quite a struggle for her to sound careless. And, despite growing anger, John had blushed madly, his ears tingling as if Molly’s word had burned him. He had been in a rush to leave as soon as convenience and courtesy allowed.
“Me too, believe me.”
“I am off. Molly, John,” he says in parting, nodding towards them but deliberately ignoring Sherlock before taking his leave.
John appears unfazed. His face is calm but there is something in his eyes that seems a bit off. “It must be someone who really likes you,” John muses. “Someone… brave.”
“I better do.”
“Can’t you guess?” John says, calmly shaking his head as if it is all totally obvious. “I didn’t say anything because you are the most amazing thing I have ever seen and I wanted to keep what we have— wanted to keep you and not make things awkward or scare you off.”
Sherlock didn’t return but John hadn’t really expected him to. He spent his day in a daze, trying not to ponder what had happened between them, failing gloriously and finally dozed off into an uneasy sleep.
Tilting his head sideways, John saw Sherlock’s lips drawn into a tight line, confirming that John had come to the right conclusion. A feeling of utter disappointment settled in his stomach.
And what’s more: No matter who has sent the mysterious present to him, the saying on the card absolutely proved to be right.
“Well,” John shuffles his feet, but doesn’t come any closer, a complicated look in his eyes. “Because they’re sending their adoration in a riddle.”
Sherlock is totally lost and doesn’t know what to do with himself. For the first time in years he feels miserably lonely. He solves the case of the drowned child with the fair curls and the Michael Jackson CD tucked into his pocket the second day but it offers only a brief relief. John will be gone for another four days and Sherlock absolutely hates it.
“I wanted this,” he whispered into Sherlock’s skin when his lips brushed Sherlock's throat, the longing and intensity of his own words going straight to John’s groin. Sherlock’s body gave a shudder and his arms tightened around him. John’s name fell from his lips, twice, and it was so full of meaning and emotion that John pressed two hard kisses to Sherlock’s mouth in the hope of letting them convey all his feelings. Because even though Sherlock had already confessed how he felt and had so evened the way for physical contact, John wasn’t ready to phrase his own feelings into words. Especially since their intensity along with the way he reacted to Sherlock writhing underneath him took him by quite a stupendous amount of surprise. He had been in love before but it had never felt so important.
“What? No!” he exclaims, forcefully, and fumbles to check his mobile again. Sherlock’s eyes narrow because the box and flower, he recalls, aren’t the only mystery meant to be solved here.
John’s voice falls from his lips like clouds opening to reveal bright beams of sunlight and Sherlock experiences a breathless rush of affection towards him and fumbles a bit with the tails of his unbuttoned shirt. He’s nervous all of a sudden and the need to step closer to John hits him fully in the chest. It creates a warm pool right there between his sternum and shoulders and the fact that John is still standing by the door with that lovely smile on his face, his focus entirely on Sherlock, doesn’t exactly offer any opportunity to just turn or step away without seeming weird or obviously flustered. The moment drags towards infinity and if it only wouldn’t be so totally awkward - him standing in their sitting room in his shirt sleeves, color slowly rising to form two warm spots on his cheeks  - he may be tempted to never leave the realm where John Watson looks at him with so much affection, patience and focus. Sherlock shyly dips his chin.
“I am sure he just wants to prove he’s omnipotent, that git. His behavior indeed is irritating. Not that I am surprise.. or complaining this time.”
“No… Aaah…”
He’s heard these words before – in sappy movies and boring and predictable TV shows he’s watched for scientific research on human behavior and reactions to stimuli and sentiments. He’s always rolled his eyes and thought it all petty and pathetic.
“Jeez, I didn’t expect you back so soon, Sherlock Holmes.”
It is the following afternoon and Lestrade eyes Sherlock quizzically when he hands him a manila folder at NSY.
___________________________________
“I didn’t take you for a romantic,” Sherlock hears himself say and it is surprisingly okay for now. John’s words contain a modicum of sense.
“You’ve never really lost it, Sherlock. Hell, I was so insecure about you all the time, I was afraid I’d failed or overtaxed you.”
“Maybe he likes talking to me better than he does to you. You always give him the feeling he’s a kindergartener.”
Sherlock’s head snapped up, his pool of wide grey-green eyes gone dark in the fading light but his voice stayed very soft and rang with a certain finality, as if he was just stating the facts without emotion.
“Gavin, your timing is unfavourable.”
“John-”
Three hours later he opened the front door of 221B Baker Street and crept into the hallway. He took off his jacket and stepped into his flat. Sherlock was still sitting on the couch, his feet back on the coffee table, toes wiggling alongside eyeballs and muttering under his breath. John took off his shoes and then collected the four teacups gone cold from the coffee table to rinse them in the kitchen sink.
The end
plans?” John asks a moment later, eyes curious now and brows furrowed.
Sherlock’s forehead puckered; he took a deep breath and closed his eyes and when he opened them again, John saw how scared and anxious he really was. For a second he was wondering if Sherlock might be afraid that John would change his mind and push him away. As if John would do something so utterly ridiculous. As if John could deny him anything.
Turning around, he noticed Sherlock staring at him, and their eyes met. John cleared his throat.
“I don’t want to sleep,” Sherlock insists and grips the armrests of his chair with both hands. His whole body goes taut. John is lingering very close to him and suddenly, illogically, Sherlock resents it all - resents sentiments, resents this murder case and how it has triggered him into emotional attachment and unease, resents himself and the way he’s fantasized about the potentialities he has discovered about John. Resents how his transport is practically out of control and vibrates with longing where it’s supposed to use all its capabilities for the prevailing case. His fingers turn white around the nails where he digs them into the fabric of his chair.
Ah, yes.
He felt Sherlock tense up next to him and a moment later both his hands grabbed John’s.
“John, John,” Sherlock says, talking over John and finally fully looking up at him. “Don’t- That’s- No one truly likes me, as you should well know.” He says it with a finality that makes John open his mouth but, thankfully, refrain from finishing the sentence. Instead he bites the corner of his lower lip, eyes glistening with something very close to anger again.
Sherlock is back in his favourite chair again with his laptop on his knees after spending half the day in the garden department of a DIY store. He planned to write an article for his website about the different varieties and the quantity of smoke that forms over bonfires according to the combination of wood and the size of the respective logs used in the fire. But somehow he could not properly concentrate.
Sherlock sat very still all of a sudden.
“Why would I be angry with you?” he retorts, incredulous, then thinks and amends, “I could ask you the same question, John.”
“Ah, Dr. Watson, you are awake.”
He browses the data aimlessly for a while but it doesn’t really help him solve the mystery of John’s secret glances. It leaves him frustrated and confused.
John was feeling at a loss somehow and it hit him how uncomfortable the flat felt to him without Sherlock. But the other man was evading him, that much was obvious. Sherlock needed space.
When John awoke, the light of dawn flooded the room, covering everything in murky orange. He blinked his eyes and turned his head sideways, away from the light. He was lying on a flat and soft surface, a blanket covering his body. When he fully opened his eyes, he realised he was lying in a hospital bed. A dull ache filled his head.
… to notice?” he inquires and it makes John squirm a bit in his arms and furrow his brows.
He feels John’s eyes on his back all the way down the hallway to his room and it creates the most delicious tingle. A tingle that engulfs his whole being, from his skull through his curls all the way down his lean torso and over his buttocks to his legs and feet and when he reaches his bedroom he has to press one hand to his chest and close his eyes to keep his heart from fluttering out of his rib cage to soar into the wide, wide open night sky.
Sherlock’s voice sounded strained and he had to blink, twice.
“But I don’t want— “ Sherlock trails off and rather skims delicate fingers along his neck and waist, studiously ignoring the request. John acquiesces and comes to exactly the right conclusion. He closes his eyes and breathes for a long moment.
“You look horrible, Sherlock. Why haven’t you been home to change your clothes? It must have been quite a run-in with these drug dealers of yours.”
But for once Lestrade doesn’t let himself be deterred. “Sherlock, we’ve found something on the body of the woman you two discovered yesterday” he says and lifts a small plastic bag onto eye level. Sherlock takes it and examines the content. It is a small wooden ball, slightly beveled so it isn’t perfectly round, approximately a half an inch in diameter, light brown and with a hole in the middle. In the natural grooves of the wood tiny brown indentions can be seen – as if it has been dumped into paint and then washed and dried. Sherlock rolls it in his fingers briefly before a knowing smile lights his face. He hands it back to Lestrade and starts aligning data. This really looks quite promising. “Where did you find it?” he asks only to have Lestrade confirm his suspicion. “In her stomach.”
“There is a smear of blood on your jaw, I take it is Dr. Watson’s?”
“Don’t,” he said, his voice calm.
“You know it is totally beyond me how people regard it as desirable to engage into certain activities in order to gain physical well-being just because societal conventions dictate it’s convenient, even prestigious? And yes, listen closely, because I may under certain circumstance be inclined to think that it could be worthwhile if one is and I shudder to even say this out loud: in love with the other party involved. But then again, our culture is full of stories about questionable things people do when they are in love.”
The End
Sherlock’s eyes seemed very old again and they looked at each other for another second before the buzzing of Sherlock’s phone interrupted.
Sherlock fidgets, tugging his hands into his pockets only to brush the respective parts of his anonymous present and tears them out again, as if burned. He adjusts his scarf but it’s all to no avail. The tension between them is palpable in the way John’s glancing at him has increased in the last minutes, has intensified in its focus and Sherlock is close to panicking again.
It was different somehow that time in the kitchen, at the crime scene and three days ago in the tube. Different from each single glance and also from John’s usual behavior and attitude.
From a logical point of view it’s quite simple: He tumbled into John’s arms, completely unaware that the other man’s presence and John caught him and put him back onto his feet. It really shouldn’t be so much of a problem and certainly shouldn’t be enough to keep his mind so terribly occupied, running in circles and preventing sleep from coming over him and engulfing him in soft oblivion.
which is infinitely better anyway, even though it would feel decidedly weird to give John
The nurse switched on the headlights and stepped next to his bed. Examining his head, she smiled.
Disclaimer: I don’t own Sherlock but if I did, I’d give him to John.
John,
“You know, sometimes I think Mycroft is really obsessed with us. I wonder what the reason may be for that.”
“It’s so beautiful, John…”
John turned to Sherlock, looking him over. He found him returning his gaze, something incredibly intense, soft and tender going on behind his eyes. John cleared his throat, deciding to be brave.
Sherlock rose again, and carefully, as if testing the air between them, sat on the table next to John. His ridiculously long legs touched the floor where John’s couldn’t. John was shivering, visibly now, and Sherlock inched closer.
is the one that gets all the messages and John mostly receives his from either the clinic, Lestrade or himself, Sherlock. “Go, check,” he prompts and John rolls his eyes but gets up and angles for his phone. He fumbles a bit in his jeans, untangles it and frowns. “It’s your brother.”
“But you know, some people treat these experiences and their possibilities with casual interest?” he asked a moment later and couldn’t quite keep the mockery out of his voice. Sherlock gave him a mock-pained look.
The D.I. raised his glass again, an expectant look in his eyes. Sherlock's lips turned into an annoyed line.
Sherlock was out of breath by the time he finished, and John knew he was right. They were both tired and worn out from this chase. John was all but certain that their pursuers were very familiar with their surroundings, thus effectively keeping them from leaving the storehouse area. They locked eyes, their hiding spot well-lit enough so that John could see Sherlock’s flushed face. The floor beneath them creaked when he slumped against the brick wall behind them and slid to the ground. They had to rest, even if it was only for a short time. Their hiding place seemed to be safe enough for now. John could imagine only too well what would happen to them if they were found and he was prepared to do everything in his powers to not let it get that far.
Sherlock’s eyes were still insecure but there was also something else going on behind them.
“Oh,” he exclaims lamely and it takes him a few seconds to put his laptop onto the coffee table and take his cup. Their fingers brush and Sherlock’s eyes flits from John’s face to their hands and back up to his face again. He doesn’t know why but suddenly he’s a bit nervous. John is wearing a dark green jumper tonight, tighter around his frame than the oatmeal one or the sweatshirt with the stripes he prefers when at home and dark blue trousers. His hair is properly groomed but that might have been due to the fact that he’s been at the clinic today.
A second loud moan drowned out any other coherent speech and made John’s blood rush straight into his groins. He had to push his own arousal hard into the matrass and roll his hips. The duvet and the remains of his trousers had him both moaning and shuddering and he opened his mouth without further ado or internal debating to take Sherlock in, his tongue sliding over hard and warm flesh, over the little slit at his glans, while slender hips desperately tried to rock upwards. Sherlock tangled the fingers of one hand into his hair and was practically melting under him. It seemed like the part of his brain that was usually stalling every human notion and every interest Sherlock might have had towards other people, had floated away. And, damn, John would make sure it’d stay away. All that mattered at the moment - and risking a look upwards to Sherlock’s face, flushed and contorted into pleasured agony, only confirmed it - was Sherlock’s lean, naked body under him, his cock on his tongue and his sweet cries in his ears. His warm skin everywhere and the incredibility of sharing pleasure with being together like that.
“Good morning,” he replies and John smiles at him and lazily kisses his chin. Sherlock may have been too strung out a few hours ago to fully appreciate the afterglow, the cuddling, but he happily indulges now. Lifting his arms to encompass John, he strokes over sturdy shoulders and a delicately muscled back before his fingers move over strong arms upwards to tangle into short strands of silver-blond hair. John huffs a lazy breath and Sherlock instantly decides, that, lackadaisical, warm and naked in his bed is how he likes John best in the morning.
Sherlock obviously doesn’t have a sweetheart. He has a
“Adoration is a very strong term for a single flower and roughly 2 ounces of cardstock,” he retorts and John chuckles.
“There can be more than one?” Sherlock wants to know and John shrugs his shoulders.
John’s brain somehow felt unattached from his body and his anger evaporated. In stressful and threatening situations, he tended to go astonishingly focused - one of the advantages of a military schooling.
The first time Sherlock notices John glancing at him is on a Sunday evening. It is approaching 9pm and they’ve just had dinner. Sherlock is busy cataloguing various effects of poison after he’s done several experiments in the morgue earlier that day. He sits in his chair, the laptop is on his knees and John is in the kitchen cleaning their dinner plates. They’ve eaten in a companionable silence that Sherlock enjoyed despite the fact that he hadn’t really bothered talking all day. With John it doesn’t feel strained or weird as it does with others.
This is the last chapter and I really had such a good time writing this story.
He heard Sherlock exhale, but he still refused to answer. John felt his patience dwindling rapidly.
John’s face swirls and becomes unfocused but Sherlock realizes that this is just because he is blinking rapidly. “John—,“ he whispers and simply has to kiss him again. “This is ridiculous,” he huffs and it is not quite clear whether he means his attire at Buckingham palace or something more present.
However, if he is totally honest with himself, the worst and most confusing part is the fact that it’s not only John and his motives he’s questioning. It’s also his own. The picture of how he suddenly wanted to touch John’s hand at Angelo’s hovers before him and it’s nothing he’s ever encountered before. It doesn’t fit his set of data about humanity. He has never in all his life touched someone just for the sake of feeling them skin to skin, without any ulterior motive. He knows Mycroft thinks the prospect of physically getting close to people frightens him but that’s not true. The truth is: It simply doesn’t mean anything to him. He entertains physical and also emotional contact when the circumstances require him to, when it is a possibility to obtain data he needs or to get doors open for him. Mind, he’s not totally incompetent when it comes to touching someone in an explicitly sexual context, no matter what Mycroft thinks. Everybody experiments at university but after setting himself up with four different specimens, two of each gender – all for the sake of science and because he’d been a tiny bit curious – he had found that this area is certainly not one where he would seek fulfillment.
John sees his awkwardness. He blinks a few times and then composes himself and gives him a reassuring smile.
“No, don’t doubt anything, Sherlock,” John reassures him. He kisses him softly, his gentle accommodating self again and the flicker of enticing dark a foggy memory, his hand warm on Sherlock‘s shoulder. “I want it to happen but not now, not in a rush.” He smiles. “For me it will still be the same once the sun rises.”
John only looks at him with slightly narrowed eyes but when he shakes his head again it isn’t totally devoid of mirth and fondness.
“Three, as of today, and if you count the Sunday I noticed, twenty-two days,” Sherlock clarifies and swallows hard like he realized a mistake. John is silent, his blue eyes incredulous and there is another layer of truth in John’s question.
He wasn’t alone, though, and once John had fully come around, he saw Sherlock’s coat hanging over a chair next to his bed. The man himself was staring out of the window when John opened his eyes, and for a moment, John was able to take in Sherlock’s slender form. The right sleeve of his shirt was thoroughly muddied up to his shoulder; his curls were messy; and he had his hands interlaced under his chin, giving him the look of a prayer. He appeared to be unhurt, and John was overwhelmed by a wave of relief that washed through him.
But this is not what happens and Sherlock is allowed to keep a good part of his dignity. Instead he abandonds thinking and intuitively lifts his chin. His eyes are wide open when his lips brush over John’s jaw and then melt onto John’s soft yet firm mouth.
“Have you checked all your messages from yesterday?” he asks, more curious and a tad suspicious because, usually,
John’s eyes are deep blue pools of warm water during their cab ride as Sherlock fills him in about the case. He is less nervous now that everything is back to normal and they are about to do a case together, an air of familiar excitement around them. John’s presence has always helped him focus and deal with the problems at hand. There is a bit of a distance between them on the backseat of the cab that Sherlock silently keeps himself from gravitating towards to surmount it and bath in John’s stable warmth but it is only a minor physicality and there is nothing to worry about.
“God, Sherlock-- I want you so much…”
“No,” John exclaims, leaning upwards again to nuzzle his nose into the warm space behind Sherlock right ear. “It’s not important.” John is warm under his hands, skin smooth with just a dusting of blond hair around his pectorals. His kisses are languorous and wet and deliciously stubbly but something is nagging in the back of Sherlock’s head and it’s not the fact that he’s asked the exact same question just last evening and John has answered in exactly the same words. He straightens his spine and looks down at John.
when he blinks up at him and Sherlock is reminded of how John had smiled at him last night at Regent’s Park. Before they’ve gone home.
“He’ll be back in three days,” Sherlock replies caustically and refuses to look at Lestrade. He’s afraid he might give it all away if he does. It’s a bit offputting how Lestrade phrases his question, focusing rather on John‘s absence than his return. Yet, if he notices how Sherlock changed that focus, he doesn’t say anything and, for a moment, Sherlock is absurdly glad that Lestarde has learned how not to pry.
, is the exception.
John was on his feet the next moment and the sudden distance brought up between them kept him from grabbing Sherlock and pommelling him.
As he reaches the end of the corridor, the footfalls behind him a steady presence but keeping their distance, the door to the lab is thrown open again. “What about your mice, Sherlock?” Molly’s squeaky voice rings through the corridor. “I wanted to talk with you about them.” She pauses, breathless. “I gave them names.”
“Why is everything emotion with you, John? I don’t do emotion.”
John didn’t like Sherlock’s last two words. He looked around, troubled. He was still riding an adrenaline high and needed to calm himself forcefully.
“Hello freak,” she greeted Sherlock and stood back at the wall to drink her coffee.
The man went limp instantly. John grabbed Sherlock’s hand and hurled him back to his feet. Their chests were heaving laboriously, their faces wild. When their eyes met, John saw the same look on Sherlock’s face that he had given him on the roof; his gaze intense and glistening. John’s heart gave a hard thud.
“Ah, yes, little brother, two more things: I have taken it upon myself to at least bring you a new shirt.” Mycroft tossed him the shopping bag he had brought, and Sherlock caught it in midair, angrily glaring at his older brother.
“As much as I’d prefer to stay in bed with you, Scotland Yard is still on the agenda. I didn’t dream that, did I?”
John’s eyes darted upwards to meet Sherlock’s.
“Very subtle, Sherlock.”
The body that lies in the bend of a dead end tunnel is half naked, with limps twisted into unnatural angles and blood everywhere, covering the floor, the walls and the body. Even though this spot is close to the river there is no tide and no drainage like in other parts of the sewers. It is simply by chance that they found her and if John hadn’t checked the adjacent tunnels as well they may never have. The scene is presumably just the way the killer has left it when he was done slaying his poor victim. In comparison the male body they have found looked rather untouched while this one here - eyes staring unblinking, hair strewn out wildly around the head, chunks of skin and flesh missing around the thighs and neck, broken clavicle and bashed-in brain – makes Sherlock’s heart sink and his stomach twist. He feels sick all of a sudden.
Somehow their lips meet again and it’s more than a university experiment between drunk and curious early-20s. It is bliss and wonder and it holds them captive where their bodies touch, warms him from his hairline all the way down to the soles of his feet. Sherlock is spell-bound by the contrast of John’s warm and gentle hands at the nape of his neck – the hands that have held a gun only a few hour earlier and suddenly, with a flash of insecurity and self-insight, feels ill-fitting and too obvious. Too big. Not in comparison to John, who is perched in his lap in what must be a pretty uncomfortable angle - his buttocks pressing down onto Sherlock’s thighs, his arms draped around Sherlock’s shoulders in a loose circle. Apart from the fact that Sherlock, for a second, has to tamp down on a surge of vanity to want to leave his body, soar up to the ceiling and check on himself and how he’s doing from the outside, it feels good. More than good.
“You cannot know whether it’s perhaps explosives,” John reasons. “Someone might try and blow up the flat.”
Regent’s Park at night is beautiful. The air is clear and mild, with a bit of a fresh wind, and the pathways amidst the scattered street lamps are emptied of the buzzing crowd that certainly must have enjoyed the afternoon here earlier. Stray couples occasionally pass them but no one really lingers around the playgrounds and university buildings at around half past ten on a february night. The library sports a few illuminated windows but once they pass Triton’s Fountain and the open air theatre, they don’t meet anyone else again.
“Sherlock, wait a second.”
John has called him “love” before they’ve fallen asleep as if it was the simplest thing in the world - has touched and held him like Sherlock is
again when Sherlock had retold the story of their latest case to Angelo. He’d felt flustered again but quite chuffed with himself. Impressing John does have unfathomable merits of its own.
“We can’t go to Bart’s now!” John repeats emphatically and shakes his head. His dark blue eyes are wide open and glistening.
“Sherlock…” John's voice is small and Sherlock thinks that maybe kissing in the dark really isn’t enough but it's not like he has references to rely on. He cannot be sure what it is that goes on in John’s mind. Then it occurs to him that maybe— maybe John, who has instigated their first kiss in Sherlock’s chair at the risk of having it thrown back into his face, who has followed him to bed, who has demanded nothing so far, whose presence has formed a quiet place where there is nothing but the two of them – maybe John, despite all his apparent self-confidence, needs it spelled out. Needs
“What?” He feigns a chuckle. “Is my thinking bothering you again?”
They tiptoed to a staircase at the outer wall of the old building, and climbed the stairs silently. They reached a window which overlooked a small roof of a lower building, and had an equally small yard in between. The yard, moderately illuminated by street lamps, was closed on three sides by walls, a gateway leading off into the darkness of an alley. A transporter was parked in front of the open gateway, but no one was in sight.
"Why, your company is most delightful, John," Sherlock said matter-of-factly and picked up his phone. John was flabbergasted. That man was really clueless sometimes.
Squaring his shoulders and licking his lips he went on.
“What happened to my head?” John asked as he put the bowl back onto his breakfast tray. He comfortably slumped back into his up-right pillow, gazing at Sherlock.
He wants to plea for John to just explain it all to him, to tell him what’s behind it all because he’s neither strong nor witty enough to suss it out on his own. He wants to tell John to rid him of this terrifying feeling of not being emotionally stable enough to be both human and craving.
John’s mouth drops open.
Sherlock has made an experiment out of his observations concerning John and feels slightly put out with him now for refraining to distribute the appropriate data. Is it a game? Coincidence? What does it mean? Does it mean anything at all? But nothing Sherlock can come up with makes sense or fits all the information he’s acquired.
Their eyes met and the warmth in his ears crept onto his cheeks.
“Add that to the list of things people might talk about. You and me, trapped in a small room, with no means to stay warm but each other.”
“That was quick thinking with my phone, Sherlock. You called Greg?”
But first things first.
John immediately noticed the two men in a puddle of light which came off a street lantern. He instantly reacted and pushed Sherlock back into the dark, before another shot tore the air around them. Desperately trying to protect them both, he pushed Sherlock into a dark yard on their right and through a rusty gate. Clasping his sleeve tightly, they ran through the building, out of another door, and into a second yard. Here, Sherlock pulled him behind another batch of trash.
“Would it be alright if we sleep now? Just— sleep?”
For a second John looks like he wasn’t going to answer. When he does it’s probably Sherlock's urgency and the ‘please’ that makes him change his mind. In any case his words turn the atmosphere around them into blunt electricity.
“What?” he demands to know but both hurry to shrug at him.
“No, he really isn’t, it’s just his wife that’s out of town with her sister. Those aren’t even roses. The alphabet of flowers-”
John chuckled quietly.
It is only when it’s apparent that neither is it an accident nor would John put a stop to this that Sherlock is able to close his eyes and bow to sentiment.
He had to avert his eyes from the mirror the next second, feeling embarrassed.
“You utter--”
Sherlock swallows hard. Murder is always nasty business. Nasty and utterly unfair.
Close. Devine. Secure.
A few days after their celebration John took the tea kettle off the stove and poured water into two cups standing on the counter. It was still an hour until he scheduled to meet an old university friend along with his friend's wife and her sister, whom he was to be introduced to tonight. He was wearing his favorite shoes, a close fitting dark blue jumper and had his hair combed back nice and casual. A quick look into the mirror in the bathroom confirmed he was looking his best tonight. He felt good, everything was back to normal, him going out on a date and Sherlock staying in, doing whatever it was he did. He’d dated a lot of women, John mused, trying to ignore the certain tone these words had. It had become an integral part of his life in the last two years. He liked dating, it was fun most of the time and he usually didn't give it a second thought when it didn't work out. A casual and distracting way to spend free time and John had never thought about stopping it just because Sherlock had become the center of his every day life again. It seemed ridiculous, John told himself, to stop just because he was feeling weird about Sherlock Holmes lately.
Sherlock blinks for a moment and realizes he is trembling.
Which is
“Mycroft, what do you want? You didn’t leave your office just to make me wear a new shirt.”
It’s one of the reasons why Sherlock has never made a pass at John.
John blushed heavily and cut the look. Sherlock’s grip onto his hips and the small circles his thumb was doing on his skin kept him grounded and remain in place while Sherlock's eyes, large in their dimly-lit sitting room, tried to hold his gaze. John didn’t know why he hadn’t started sliding his hands under Sherlock’s shirt, dip into the waistband of his trousers and unwrap him. But a small part in him was not convinced, that these actions were in his best interests. Or in Sherlock’s.
Sherlock stares and, for a moment, John stares back at him, before he nudges his knee to Sherlock’s under the table and turns his menu card to prompt a decision. “And what do you want to eat?”
He stripped in the bathroom and got in front of the mirror to check himself while hot water flowed into the tub behind him. His face didn’t look bad. The bruise, once purple and very sharp against his fair skin, was turning into an interesting shade of yellow now but that wasn’t something he could do anything about.
“Keep going. I can try to distract--” Sherlock answered but John cut him short.
He’d felt immediately flushed and had safely retreated to being annoyed with himself. He’s fairly certain, though, even now as he stands next to Lestrade, that it won’t take long to suss is all out once John is back at 221B – Sherlock will dedicate it his whole and undivided attention.
the consecutive text says,
“Why... I... Please-”
John pressed his lips onto Sherlock’s forehead, lifting his hand and playing with a strand of his dark and messy curls. Sherlock looked at him and his eyes suddenly became very wistful and shy again.
“That was rather rude on Greg”, John stated. Sherlock huffed with annoyance.
He stopped.
“I missed him. Hell, even Anderson missed him. And you, for that matter. Police work just isn’t the same without you.”
“No.”
“Haven’t we been through this, John?”
“What do you mean this isn’t yours?” Sherlock snaps, thrown by the change in John’s demeanor. “You said you’d give me a present? Who else would be giving me a present?” The thought isn’t completely without interest but who on earth would give him an earnest Valentine’s Day present? A mock-present, yes, to either pique his attention or his disgust. To distract him from far more important things like murders and crimes but there is just nothing on these days until Lestrade finally comes out and asks him to look over his newest crime scene photos.
“God, I
“Ah, so nice not seeing you in a hospital bed for change, Sherlock.” A voice resounded from the open door, and to John’s puzzlement, Mycroft Holmes swept into the room, umbrella dangling from his wrist, and a shopping bag in his hand.
preferred day, what were
“It’s too light,” he says by way of an elaborate explanation and sets the box down onto the table to push his fingers under the ribbon and remove it. He’s about to remove the lid when-
, it occurs to Sherlock,
“Oh, Sherlock…”
“That is a weird question to ask now-- oh--“
“Open it?”
The innuendo got stuck in John’s head and grew there. So when Sherlock arched his back and leaned in for another kiss, John brought his hands down onto his shoulders to restrain him.
Pondering distractions to pass the waiting time the carcass comes to mind, but he dismisses the thought of repeating his spleen experiment, because a quick look at John and his tense shoulders tell him that he’d rather be someplace else. Which is weird because John could have left any time. Sherlock may have told him they were going to Bart’s together and John is always keen to be either helpful or act as a sort of filter between Sherlock and the entanglements of the world. But John’s restlessness is thoroughly distracting and at around nine o’clock, after the final test results from the card come in, Sherlock finally gives up on his microscope.
True to his proposal John hadn’t fussed with continuing their rather aimless stroll through Regent’s Park and had led Sherlock down the quickest route to Baker Street. There, he’d taken Sherlock up the stairs, out of his clothes and into bed with a single-minded determination that had let Sherlock to deduce he himself hadn’t been the only one engaging in fantasies of a certain nature. His warm hands, capable mouth and strong body had spread Sherlock onto the sheets where John had devoured him well into the early hours of the morning until Sherlock couldn’t remember either his name or where his body ended and John’s began.
“It just sort of came up,” John answers, oblivious to Sherlock’s inner turmoil. “Though he came up with most of the details himself,” he says, his smile a bit wry. “He asked me if I had plans, I confirmed and told him I’d made up my mind about someone. He asked me whether she’s beautiful and I didn’t see any reason to correct every detail of his assumptions.”
But the feeling,
For one so unassuming with his non-descript jumpers and harmless, even boring appearance, John is surprisingly witty, sassy even. Capable and strong and positively riveting in his intricate complexity; a drawer of hidden treasures. The day he’d limped into Sherlock’s life can never be cherished enough. In fact, Valentine’s Day should be replaced by it.
John shut down his thoughts, because he tended to get sidetracked when he was nervous. Lifting the headpiece of his hospital bed with the remote control, he adjusted his position to sit a little more comfortable before he dared to look at Sherlock again. The slender detective was staring at him and John felt a faint warmth creeping into his ears and settling there.
It’s obvious that he’s lost his choice in the matter, and so, miserably, he pulls his coat tighter around himself and follows.
“Sherlock, you okay?”
“How did you confirm that without having ever been… involved yourself?”
“I haven’t heard from her in years. She is of no concern,” Sherlock says and finds his voice is low and final.
“I wanted to protect you, John. It’s the truth.”
"Mmh, Lestrade really hasn't got anything new for me. God, I am so bored. How do you cope with that every day?"
"Sherlock, for the love of god!" John turned around, facing the other man and grinding his teeth.
“And where are you going now? And why only two hours?” Lestrade wants to know, exasperatedly flicking his hands in the air.
His words made Sherlock leave the bed, as if he’d been burned, but John hadn’t expected it to be simple in any event. He mirrored Sherlock in crossing his arms in front of his chest, and they stared at each other. But then, Sherlock’s glance eluded him after a few seconds by turning to the window, his back rigid. John tried a different approach, his voice turning sharp.
Five seconds later his phone buzzes with a message.
“Yes, it feels good to be back,” John admitted and opened the door to the back garden. Lestrade followed him out and John had to grab his shoulders to steady him.
“Don’t you want to read that texts? Is it John?” she inquires cautiously and Sherlock growls because it has all been so very nice when she’d stood in silent attention to hand him all the tools he needs the moment he needs them. She’s become quite astute in interpreting his silent looks towards the tool tray.
Who would have thought Sherlock could be so damn seductive - while still wearing all his clothes? Neither of them had made a move towards getting rid of their respective garments, yet. They’d kept it on just this side of innocence but John was past illusion. He’d never wanted anyone so bad in his entire life. He just didn’t know how to get there with Sherlock. Even though Sherlock was fairly aroused himself. John could feel it through the fabric of his suit trousers.
“I want it, too. And I won’t change my mind” Sherlock says, smiling because it would all be worthless without John anyway and when he puts their mouths together he can kiss the stars.
“Ah, Sherlock, there you are. Enjoying yourself?”
“Keep your secrets, if you must. If that’s what you need, okay. Just… don’t lie to me, Sherlock, please.”
They meander a bit aimlessly after leaving the direct path back to Baker Street. It has seemed to Sherlock that, for once, he was following John but John could as well have been following him. Sherlock doesn’t really question it and it actually doesn’t really matter in the great scheme of things. After his lapse in the restaurant the air around them feels tight again despite the park’s spaciousness. They don’t really talk, they only make the occasional remark about what they see on their path, about the food and whether John has a shift at the clinic the next day. They carefully omit everything that revolves around either Sherlock’s anonymous Valentine’s present, John’s shattered dating plans or the dating prospects of their friends and associates. Once in a while Sherlock glances at John and feels John glance back in return when Sherlock isn’t looking and the air around them turns more and more static. Sherlock wonders when it will burst. It’s obvious John wants to say something - Sherlock has seen it in his eyes after they’ve left the restaurant and ventured into the park. The look has never left really left John’s eyes. The question is only, what exactly it is John wishes to say and Sherlock finds himself whole-heartedly dreading the moment John will finally say it.
They had kissed. In the middle of an adrenaline-fuelled chase where men with guns had tried to take them down. With all the anger and insecurity between them, he had grabbed Sherlock and kissed him. And Sherlock had kissed him back. John was feeling quite hot and a tad embarrassed because if it hadn’t been for the space between the bed and chair, and the door suddenly opening to allow the nurse in, tray in hands, he might have been tempted to do it again.
“John, I— What’s supposed to happen now? Do you think we should—“
“It might not be what you expect, I am the way I am and I don’t know if I can… Being with me isn’t exactly a picknick, John.“ Sherlock says, his voice tinged with frustration, turning small a moment later when, as an afterthought, he utters “I don’t know what you expect...”
Sherlock’s eyes were very serious, yet incredibly tender and honest when John lifted his gaze to look at him. Sherlock sighed.
Ah, it’s so
Instead, he vows to take John out whenever the notion strikes, kiss him whenever he likes and take him to bed to either sleep or not sleep every night. To wake up again to John’s warm and wonderful body, that, in this very moment, is pressed up against his to have him as close as possible.
way. Like no other has ever before.
At first he’d been bashfully quiet when John had practically whipped him out of his garments, scattering them carelessly to be left where they fell, joined by John’s only moments later. It had been such a long time since he’d last engaged in carnal pleasures and at first had found it surreal and strange to follow John’s lead and let biology and sentiments wash over him. He’d felt utterly vulnerable, a tiny bit stupid and utterly unprepared for the onslaught. But John had simply kissed him, encouraged and reassured him and soon had him reduced to soft moans, thrusting hips and wandering hands. Everything outside his bed had been rendered irrelevant and utterly dismissible. Being touched by John and touching him in return had allowed his baser nature to surface, a nature that wants to smell and hold, kiss and taste. To claim and be claimed in return and at some point he’d given himself over to the rush that is all
“I am very pissed off with you, Sherlock Holmes. You cannot imagine how much.” He managed to say between clenched teeth, shook off Sherlock’s arm, and jumped off the table, his fists clenched.
, why does his mind feel so hazy all of a sudden? His heart is beating frantically in his chest but he feels daft and unable to move.
John abruptly stops in his tracks and Sherlock, having continued their meanderings for a couple more steps, has to turn around to face him.
Sherlock got up and pulled the tray closer. He decidedly didn’t look at John when he bent over him to secure the bedside table, and suddenly it seemed like his hands were shaking. It was only for a moment, though, before Sherlock slumped back into his chair, hands folded over his chest.
He closed his eyes for a second to calm himself but found that, when he opened them again, he couldn’t look at Sherlock. His nerves felt raw. His hands were shaking and he retrieved them from Sherlock’s and put them into his own lap. Sherlock didn’t hold onto him when he sensed the movement and let go. The air around them felt heavy.
But the way John says it, his voice low and so enticingly honest and real makes his breath hitch in his throat. His heart lurches sideways and it all goes straight into his abdomen, where it leaves a very warm imprint. “Yes,” he whispers. Another deduction falls into line and he smiles. “And I wouldn’t want for you to have given up dating for nothing.”
The thing is, he’s never particularly cared about any of them the way he cares about John. And John, who has walked the line of friendship before and certainly knows his way, cares about him in return. They’ve known each other for three and a half years now and Sherlock has never really entertained the thought before that, being the difficult man he is, there is a person who likes him exactly for what and who he is.
Now, though, Sherlock feels that isn’t enough anymore; that they are on the brink of something entirely different, something that will change the way they are around each other for ever. Something that will either make or break them. Probably the latter. Maybe it’s just in his head but everything that has happened today has made him aware of the fact that he cannot follow the path they have obviously set for themselves any longer. There is too much tension, too much frustration, yearning… too much unclarified. He cannot fathom what it is John wants to convey, he’s lacking viable data, so the only thing he can indulge in is guessing.
“Am I giving the impression it wasn’t?”
“What do you need live mice for, Sherlock?” John asks, suspicion thick in his voice. “And where are they?”
Sherlock gave a spasmodic push upwards, grinding their hips together again. His leg that wasn’t trapped in between John and the back of the sofa lifted and wound its way around John, aligning their arousals and John’s heart went wild.
