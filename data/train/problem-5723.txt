Tony leaned into the touch. “Okay, so…”
“Where are we going?” Tony implored and Steve knew at that moment the call had been deliberate.
Natasha looked down at him softly, brushing back a stray hair that had fallen as Clint argued about the hole in the wall. Tony knew without a doubt it was from when Clint tried seeing how fast he could throw an apple at Bruce. He didn’t know how the challenge had started, but he knew it ended up with the apple creating a sizeable dent in their hallway wall.
Tony nodded, curling his hands around the bed sheets. “Don’t leave.”
“Oh of course. I do apologize.” The receptionist smiled nervously.
So now all he had to do was destroy Tony and oh was it a wonderful process. He hoped wherever Howard was he was looking on in pain. His thoughts took control of him so strongly, that he didn’t even register the noise in the tower.
Natasha smiled and leaned forward to kiss his cheek. Ryder followed the movement with his eyes, but choose not to say anything.
Karen was seated opposite of him, her own smile mirroring his own. To say that she was happy to have Tony back was an understatement.
Bucky momentarily stiffened in his seat before
Speaking of Rogers.
And something that far removed from dirt, would take an incredible time to get rid of blood stains. He still didn’t know why they had white towels in the tower with as much dirt and grime the Avengers seemed to rack up.
“And what?”
Tony shook his head. “Okay, did you happen to undergo some type of brain surgery while I was gone, during this past month? I mean I know that I’m fine as hell so no reason to tell me, but are you alright in the head?”
“I am sorry sir. I had assumed I didn’t need to reply, seeing as though you had already answered your question,” FRIDAY cheekily replied.
Nearly an hour later, the program had ended and the gymnasium was beginning to clear. Tony was surprised that no one really tried staying in order to see him, but May quickly explained that the students were more eager to leave this school and hop into their break than briefly speak to Tony.
“Tony,” came Steve’s startled gasp.
Tony tilted his head as he thought. He snapped his fingers and answered with a smile. “Yeah, he did actually. One day he gave me a granola and yogurt.”
Tony noticed he did that a lot in his sleep. It was very endearing.
“Did you tell Laura that?” Steve asked leaning forward on his elbows.
He was broken out of his thoughts, when Julie cleared her throat thus effectively silencing any and all chatter. She winked at Harley who in turn grew red in the ears. Seemingly pleased, Julie went back to gain everyone’s attention.
He tried staying awake. He used to be so good at it. He could stay up for nearly 72 hours without a nap, but now he struggled to stay awake for five minutes. He had taken to removing the patches himself and hiding them under the mattress. Cali helped him with that at least, but it didn’t help. From whatever pills they were giving him, the alcohol, and he knew that they probably placed something in his food, the little food that he received.
“You two did everything and nothing,” Ryder explained. “Say you love me.”
This…this is what Peter imagined when he became Spiderman. He wanted the chance to expand his family. And looking at Tony absentmindedly run his fingers through Steve’s hair, watching Bucky debate with Tony about how he didn’t need lasers in his new arm, laughing at Bruce turn bright red as Harley tried setting up a dating profile for him…was simply all he ever dreamed of.
Natasha slowly and dangerously turned her body to Ryder’s. “You tried giving Miles orange juice?”
“All right put your coms on,” Steve told the ones sitting at the table. Steve was thankful that they all remembered from previous times that they always would bring their coms, when they were in large public spaces. “We’ll let you know what happens.”
“Rhodey called me saying you were having a hard day,” Ryder said taking off his suit jacket and throwing it onto an empty chair in the lab. Tony looked up just as Ryder was beginning to unbutton his tie and sit down. “Why didn’t you call me? We could’ve taken the day off together.”
Thanks again to everyone who commented, gave a kudo, and left a bookmark. You all continue to make my day :)
Steve’s hand twitched on the part of the couch he had rested his hand on. He looked at Ryder’s hand rubbing slowly circle around Tony’s knees and speaking to him softly.
“We have to be honest from now on. I don’t care for whatever reason. Just be honest and listen to me. I know more than I let on,” Tony announced.
“This will help with the bruising and swelling,” she said then reached over into her bag. “And I can cover it up with this. And this will help you sober up real quick. An old family secret.”
“But I’m not doing anything Pepper. We were just stopping by at the bakery after you were done and everyone’s seen me in worst.”
“Mhm,” Steve said, finger pressing slightly into the space there where lube and Steves’ cum was leaking out. Tony’s mouth parted and he shifted one leg over Steve’s waist.
Steve didn’t say anything. There was nothing left to say at that point. Tony seemed to see that with the look Steve was giving him. He nodded once to Steve and then to himself, before stepping away from Steve. His body swayed and Steve reached out to steady him. Tony quickly recoiled from his assistance and stood on shaky legs. His body hunched over and he gathered his sweater in his hands and played with the fringes at the hem. He kept nodding to himself as he staggered away from Steve.
“Alright, let’s not get two attached to the idea of being Steve’s best man,” Natasha said seriously.
“Yes?”
Steve placed his own hand over Tony’s that was resting against his chest. He raised it closer to his neck and Tony felt the pulse there thrum against his fingertips. He let out a breath…once twice, before allowing his head to fall against Steve’s chest.
Sam raised his hands in defense. “Fine.”
Steve nodded, accepting this fate. “Whelp, guess it isn’t ethical to pause time forever huh?”
“Right, well I met Ryder at a college party, the first I ever went to. We talked and hung out a bit, but after that we didn’t really cross paths. I was disappointed,” he said amused at his past self. “I think I latched onto this idea that I could meet a friend so easily. I mean on the movies, it seemed so simple.”
“But a young Tony didn’t know that. Our Tony didn’t know that until nearly over a year ago. He’s had that added guilt on his mind for years. How long did you know?”
Steve reached over and snatched a piece of Tony’s funnel cake before popping it into his mouth. Tony’s eyes widened and his mouth opened and closed as though trying to figure out a response to it. Steve made motions to take another piece, but Tony was prepared this time. He held his plate away from Steve.
“What’s this I hear about going to the lab? Oh, are we blowing shit up. Please tell me we’re blowing some shit up. I haven’t done this in forever,” Clint exclaimed. “Let’s go now.”
Tony narrowed his eyes at the two of them suspiciously, “No, what’s going on? I see those secret looks you’re passing-and oh my goodness you think Steve’s going to say no? Or do you think he’s breaking up with me…he’s breaking up with me?”
“Barton and Rogers.” Fury said his name lower and with more anger. “I cannot physically be here. Because if one of you let something stupid like that come out of your mouth again I am going to kill you,” Fury gritted out.
“So, if that was all you wanted to know, then I think you have to let me go. After all, this whole interrogation thing is bordering the side of illegal. I know my rights and you are infringing upon them.”
With that Pepper left and Natasha turned to Steve. Motioning him forward, Steve stood beside her.

Happy parked the car just outside the cemetery gates, before looking back at Tony.
Bucky’s ear picked back up on the argument that Clint and Natasha were having, while he himself tried to stop from shivering from the cold. The cold hadn’t brought many good memories to his mind. Looking at Steve, whose shoulders were tense, Bucky could see Steve felt the same about the cold.
Pepper scrunched up his face. “Oh, there is definite need for a shovel talk.”
He exited the classroom amidst whispers of them talking about Tony. Even their professor had tried discreetly getting a view of Tony. Tony poked his head in and waved, before closing the door behind them.
Pepper rolled her eyes amusedly, moving to set her papers into a nice stack. “Yes and that was a month ago before you pushed back the meeting with the investors to go take Miles out for ice cream because and I quote, ‘Pep, my son’s pediatrician says he needs more calcium in his diet.”
Tony scrunched his face. “In my coffee? Steve you are crazy if you think I’m going to have vegetable flavored coffee.”
Steve let the red haze disperse before him, coolly settling into something that he would be addressing later. Bucky was right though, right now wasn’t the time.
Steve made no move, but instead straightened his shoulders. “I shouldn’t have left. I don’t know what your plan is, but I was a fool to have even somehow fall right into it. You may think that I’m bad for Tony, but I’m not. I was stupid and naïve for listening to you.”
A few more seconds and it would be over.
“That I do,” Peter whispered to himself. “See you guys later.”
“Tony.”
The only ones remaining were Steve and Tony. Both were tired, but were unwilling to leave each other’s company just quite yet. Tony told FRIDAY to play another movie something along the lines of what they had been watching. Tony was the first to fall asleep his head tilted awkwardly against the couch.
He tugged Steve to him, kissing him with such a fierceness that made Steve tumble into him.
Everyone soon took defensive stances. The man backed up and raised his hands. “Okay everyone let’s calm down now.”
Steve nodded, knowing not to push. Tony breathed in and tilted his head up to look back at Steve.
Tony sighed at the movement, but allowed his body to be maneuvered gently by Steve. That was until Steve tried placing Tony in an upright position. Tony removed Steve’s hand and twisted his body so that his legs were elevated on the bench’s arms and his head was placed on Steve’s lap. Steve swallowed down the need to whisper, “I love you.”
Steve tried reigning in the need to scowl and roll his eyes. Instead he nodded as though understanding the man’s confusion.
Steve shrugged. “I admit it was easier for me to leave and to never know what would happen if I actually fought for him…if I made him know that I thought I was better for him. Because what if I stayed and fought for Tony? What if I stayed and I became the person who destroyed Tony? But what if I fought for him and I lost him.”
Tony cleared his throat and blinked away a threat of tears. “You pulled me back. You reminded me how much family I have and I’m so forever grateful because you kept being my motivation to push forward. You stepped in for playdates with my kids when Steve had to rush me to my therapist for a session because I was sinking. You both helped bring me out of panic attacks, when I remembered just why I was starting this non-profit.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony’s eyes fell shut.
Tony laughed warmly. “Perhaps.”
Peter huffed. “It’s man. Spiderman.”
Tony quickly stepped aside and tried shaking his head from the fog that had settled over his eyes. He turned to Sharon and gave her his full attention.
Tony nodded and pushed open the door to Miles’ room. Miles was sitting in his bed and coloring in his coloring book. Tony smiled and went to go sit down at the head of Miles’ bed before Miles flung the coloring book at Tony and pulled the covers over his head.
And Tony looked forward to this not just being a beginning of a beautiful life, but rather a continuation.
“No, I deserve this Raft here. Steve you don’t know even half of the things I’ve done for the CMPNY or for Ryder.”
Tony turned his face down and wiped at his eyes. He was not going to cry, he told Steve so. “Was it your mission to make me cry tonight?”
He opened his eyes, recognizing that he was still in Harley’s room, soft music still playing in the background. He turned to the side and gently placed Miles back on his side of the fort, before looking at the clock. It had only been two hours and there was still quite a bit of time, before breakfast.
“You too. Bye Steve.”
Tony laughed. “Please, I’m doing you a favor Rogers.”
Without even becoming aware of it, Tony had slowly gravitated toward Steve, who was now standing from his position beside the chair.
“You think he’s going to confess with anyone else, besides just me in there?”
“You killed me the day you refused to listen to me,” Ryder announced using one hand to play with the waistband of Tony’s boxers. “You killed me when you didn’t give me the chance to say goodbye or even tell you the reason I had to leave.”
“Everything goes with silver,” Bucky noted.
He wanted it all with Tony. And he wanted it forever.
They had watched as Tony pulled in resources, spoke to DV advocates, gained partnerships with other shelters, and spoke to donors. He already had an amazing staff that of course went through not only Pepper’s intensive background search, but also Natasha’s slightly less legal method of insuring that the people they were hiring were good and honest individuals.
Because at least Ryder stayed. It doesn’t matter if the bruises stayed too.
Tony nodded at that. “I know, but I am okay. Know why I am okay?” Miles shook his head. “Because I am surrounded by three of my most favorite people in the world.”
His mom left him as soon as Tony was old enough to walk on his own.
Tony kept in a sob.
Steve couldn’t help, but to let a small breath of laughter escape his lips. At that noise, Tony turned sharply to him.
The nurse seemed to struggle with something, until he nodded. He looked between the both of them.
The weeks leading up to the fight against Thanos, they had grown closer and talked. He had yelled, Steve had put forth the same just as frustrated at how things had gotten so wrong between them. The two of them often felt so much it was hard to explain that was the reason they could never just let things breathe and actually talk.
Steve rolled his eyes at him. As the night went on, the others continued watching TV and just relaxed. Peter fixed Miles some dinner, before they both retired for the night seeing as though it was Miles’ bedtime. And Peter had to get rest since he alongside other students had to get up early in the morning to set up for the carnival.
Natasha’s cheeks turned bright red, but as soon as they flushed they quickly went back to its normal coloring.
But that’s exactly what had happened to him, wasn’t it?
“I literally came to you and Sam a month ago, asking if it would be alright if I proposed to Tony so close to the date of your anniversary, to which you readily agreed saying that more ways to celebrate the month are always exciting,” Steve groaned.
“And he didn’t Steve. He never did,” Tony gasped wetly. “I kept trying. Everything that I did was because I believed in those promises that he would get better. I lied to my son. I lied to Rhodey, Pepper, all of you. And for what?”
Tony tried reasoning with the last bit of sense Ryder might have had. “Ryder I need you to let me go. I said no to your proposal and you need to accept that. I have a son…”
Bucky was at his B.A.R.F. appointment. He had a few weeks without it, since he had been here, but he had needed to get back to his schedule. So Tony set up a few of his trusted doctors and set everything up the way it had been for him in Wakanda. While things would never be perfect, Tony hoped B.A.R.F. would help Bucky.
Emily pocketed the change and smiled brightly at him. “Thanks Mr. Stark. Enjoy the rest of your day.”
“Okay,” Michelle drawled out suspiciously, narrowing her eyes between the two.
“Congratulations,” they all said in various loud voices of excitement.
did not go unnoticed by either of them.
Bucky nodded his head and looked around the room. “Do you mind if one more tags along?” Bucky questioned silently.
“Look, you’re not alone. All of us are going to help with moving forward. I mean we still have those group therapy sessions and hey don’t look at me like that,” Bucky announced as he looked at Steve’s wincing.
“So,” Natasha began.
“Can I bring my coloring books?”
“What’s going on in my…? Steve are you high or on some medication? Where are all these compliments coming from?”
So yeah he wanted the darkness.
Steve was unsure that Tony would feel comfortable about leaving Miles in his care. While he felt there wasn’t as much hostility between the two as it had been, he knew that Tony still did not truly trust him especially with his son, especially not to watch him for that long.
Tony let anger be his energy.
“Pep,” Rhodey chided. “Do you want to see what Rogers wrote?”
And Tony knew that he didn’t need to feel needed or particular wanted…not by them.
“Nope,” Peter said sounding distressed. “And it’s going to bring my GPA down and I can’t get lower than a B in this class if I’m trying to graduate at the top of my class.”
Tony exited the car and left the safety it offered. Tony pushed open the gates and went inside the cemetery. The grass beneath his feet crinkled at each step from leaves from fallen trees that had not been raked yet.
He had broke off, then not being able to continue before tears pricked his eyes and Steve’s arms wrapped around him. Steve remembers how Tony tried to stifle his sobs, but Steve kept him in his arms and offered soothingly that he let it all out.
“What happened to watching Tony?” Pepper said.
With the exception of Wanda and Sam, the Avengers entered the newly renovated Tower. Steve marveled at the lines of the building. His eyes traveled at the softness of some of the lines that contrasted with the sharp jagged edges of some parts of the building. Steve yearned to grab his sketchbook and wondered briefly if he could take some time away to buy one.
“I’m tired Steve,” Tony admitted. “I just wanted to talk to Miles.”
He knew the way his left eye twitched ever so slightly as he was in the first stages of telling a lie.
“Okay, yeah I’m a supersoldier,” Steve laughed. He stayed in the hospital room, not leaving yet.
But he needed even more to tell himself Tony didn’t need to hear this…at least not from him.
“I’m exhausted Steve. It’s been months…and I’m still feeling like I’m not back to myself. I can’t,” Tony stopped speaking, not really confident in his ability to explain what he was feeling. And he didn’t have the energy to try finding the correct words that wouldn’t have Steve up all night trying to take care of him.
“Because! Because I couldn’t find him by myself, I couldn’t bring him back. I had no idea where he was. If it was just me, he would still be there Buck. He would still be there,” Steve rasped out, his breath hitching from trying to control the way a sob wanted to break out.
“So why now? Why come back into Tony’s life,” Natasha inserted.
“I’m sorry,” he said, slower that time. “I do apologize that my relationship with Tony has ended this way. Had I known my actions would have brought such pain and heartache I would have sought to rectify that immediately? However, you know Tony, Captain. I am sure you know.”
Steve nodded as Tony walked away from the line.
A tense silence filled the space between them. Tony turned away. Steve wanted to prod further, wanted to get him to open up to him.
“You’ll take care of Mr. Tony?” Julie said, speaking to Fury for the first time.
“That would be lovely,” Pepper said kissing Tony’s cheek.
Steve looked at them two. “I will not concede to defeat.”
Bucky mock saluted before returning his attention back to beating Harley’s car in the game.
“I’ve been having the papers ready for you to sign since the second month of you coming here,” Karen admitted warmly. “I think…I know you will be a wonderful father to Miles.”
“This is something that your heart truly desires,” Steve inquired. “Something that without it you would feel lost?”
“And they deserve ten times more, but you limited me to gifts only one every two months” Tony assured her. “But how are things going around here. Everything up to code and what not? Nobody harassing you or the kids?”
Miles shook his head. “No, baba. It’s supposed to look like that,” he said growing frustrated. “Baba. Baba no.”
“No, we never want to leave and we will never want to leave. We should have never left in the first place” Steve answered. “And I’m all for talking things out from now on and figuring what to do from here.”
Nat looked smugly at Steve. “See, let’s give the man what he wants.”
“You did not just take a piece of my funnel cake and eat it!” Tony shouted. “It was mine.”
He leaned over and began dry heaving at the point, trying to control his sobs as he heard the door open. He muffled his noises with the back of his hands, ignoring how the tears felt hot on his skin. The door to his stall opened.
Steve smiled in response. “Hey, I told you that you’re aboard the Steve wooing ride. I intend to keep my word about it being fun.”
“No, it’s no problem. Your singing is amazing. However, I don’t want to be late, so I think I’ll follow May. It was nice meeting you,” Tony said bidding a quick goodbye to Miles.
“Early present? My birthday hasn’t passed yet,” Tony told her.
Thank you all so much for the continuous love and support. All the comments, kudos, and bookmarks go straight to my heart. :)
“Obie burned it,” he said softly as if he said it soft enough it wouldn’t be true. “I…he said it was making me soft to rely on that, when I was supposed to be making weapons and continuing my father’s legacy.”
Rhodey sighed. “Menaces the both of you.”
Steve frowned as everyone left the hallway and Natasha went to go entertain Miles. His eyes scanned the hallway leading to Tony’s room. He had a feeling who the Mr. Mean Bad One was and he didn’t like it.
“Kay. Can I bring Snuggles,” Miles said in reference to his stuffed penguin.
Rhodey glared at him with the same potent stare that Mama Rhodes would send him. Tony immediately stopped messing around with the game Miles was playing with and placed his attention back toward Rhodey.
Tony smiled softly looking at Miles.
“I know, but they didn’t say we couldn’t give tips,” he winked.
Steve kissed Miles on the cheek. “Indeed, you will always be our bambino. Forever and always. Now I guess, I’ll seriously go before-”
Steve stopped shortly, not really knowing how to respond or if to respond. He loved Miles, he truly did and he was really grateful that Miles had been placed in Tony’s life. He knew that if he truly wanted to pursue Tony and having Miles say he wanted him to be his dad instead, well that got to him.
“Bambino no, no, no that’s not why I left,” Tony wanted to quickly assure.
Miles’ attention was immediately taken away from Tony and steered toward Diana. Diana’s mom smiled warmly at the two.
“So why don’t you really want to sign the Accords?”
“Oh, hush you. Nobody asked for your opinion,” Tony said.
Isa noticed Clint’s and Bucky’s own unease about therapy and decided to ease the tension. “Look as a legal counsel for the Accords, I think that therapy would be the best for you all moving forward. It doesn’t have to be about you all exposing yourselves. It does not mean testing of any sort. No needles, no brainwashing of the sort, no trying to change your entire identity,” she answered looking directly at Bucky when she said all of this.
“Don’t,” Tony hissed. “Just don’t.”
With each whispered utterance, Tony’s breath began to even out showing that he was far more exhausted than he had let on. Steve was soon to quickly follow, finally for the first time sleeping well than he had since the 52 days Tony had been gone. He had the man he loved back in his arms and he wasn’t going to leave.
“Of course I understand. I would be concerned as well. However, he is in good hands. No, no. Well, he has to answer the call of any member of the Avengers. That is a matter of life and death. I will be sure to let him know you called though. Yes, you too. Goodbye.”
Tony realized the screams were his.
Submitting to the urge, he tilted his head downward to press a kiss against Steve’s forehead. He brushed a few stray golden hairs that stuck to the skin there, behind his ear. His hands softly caressed the shell of Steve’s ear and then they made their descent toward his jawline.
He seemed to be waiting for Steve to say something, anything to give him a reason as to why he was being questioned by Steve and having two other Avengers posted at the corners of the room. He opened his mouth to question it, but thought otherwise. He learned one thing in his government classes was to always keep silent.
Miles held tightly on to Tony’s hand and urged him to go faster. “Alright Miles I get the hint. I’m coming. I’m coming.”
Steve hunched his shoulders. “There were some tears shed. No hugging,” he muttered quickly.
“You fucking sick bastard,” Steve rasped out, hands coming to rest thickly on the junction between shoulder and neck on Isak. “You’d be a fool to think I would ever let you near Tony.”
“I will. I promise.”
“You don’t even know what good shows are on the television right now! So why do you even care about controlling the remote,” Clint stressed out.
“Excuse me,” Steve said, but inwardly was grateful that Clint had stopped that outward train of thought. Tony didn’t need to know right now all the ways that he was planning on destroying Ryder. He sent out prayers once again, that the sadistic asshole that was Ryder truly was pretending to be his brother.
Natasha crossed her legs and relaxed in her chair. “I’ve trained them well.”
Tony looked down at his hands, before turning to face Steve.
“You don’t understand. My brother wasn’t always like this. He was warmer as a child, bright, and full of incomprehensible joy. It used to make me jealous with how easily he seemed to find light in certain situations. I remember the time my dad got laid off from his job and my mom had pneumonia. My older siblings and I were sad because it seemed like the weight of the world was bearing heavy on our shoulders, but Ryder he somehow managed to find my dad doing something he loved and spoke to one of his friends whose mom was a doctor. He was always helping us.”
The boys had all wanted to come, but without knowing what state Tony was in it was best they wouldn’t come until he was at least awake. Peter and Harley had been highly annoyed at that, as expected. Miles had also been angry, hearing from Peter and Harley that his baba was back, but wasn’t able to see him.
His throat tightened from holding in the confession again. He wanted to tell it to Tony every day, but ever since he said it to Tony that first time he woke up in the hospital, Tony would flinch at the statement. Steve would like to say it wasn’t him that was causing the flinch, he felt like he knew that he wasn’t…but at the same time…
“Steve,” Tony said turning his body to face Steve. His voice sounded like his heart was breaking. Tony placed a palm on Steve’s stomach and he felt the gesture ground him.
“Yeah, but we actually met through our moms, planning some group hangout. I mean I’m forever thankful for that, but I never actually had friends that I just you know met,” Tony explained. “So I was happy to hang out with him. We did a lot of that in the beginning, just hanging out.”
Tony’s lower lip trembled and he forced himself not to start crying. He was so tired of all the tears and he doubted his body could keep losing this water intake…or however bodies stored tears he was sure he was maxed out. But as Steve kept rubbing his back and pressing soft kisses to his temple, he couldn’t keep it all in. Guess those past few months of therapy were actually working.
, Tony reminded himself.
“It’s New York…why does he want a license right now,” Steve sadly said. “Tony why are our kids growing up so fast. You’ll stay young forever right, kiddo?”
Steve pulled the blanket tighter over Tony’s body. He had remained silent for most part of the story even when he wanted to protest everything that Ryder was about. Tony could even feel when Steve was getting riled up. It was in the way he pulled Tony closer to him or pressed a kiss on top of his head so that he would say anything to interrupt Tony.
“Exactly! But I fucking have the ability to change Barton. I’m not stagnant in my decisions. Look I’m not saying I was completely wrong nor completely right. Neither of us were and that’s what led us here. But I am here to compromise. Why can’t you see this?”
“Tony is there anything you can give us to help us locate you. I mean we’re trying, we’ve followed your location and tried scanning your suit, but there’s a point that your location just gets lost,” Steve said disappointedly.
Silence broke through once again.
Rhodey left to go back home. Tony told him that he should be with his family on his road to recovery. Tony wanted to imply that he was Rhodey’s family, but he didn’t want to be greedy. Rhodey still had people in his life who loved him. Those people could help heal his heart. Tony could only try to heal his legs.
“Hey my dedication allowed me to win this game.” Tony bumped his shoulder into Steve. “And reveal my secrets? Never. Steve you’ll just have to find your own strategy.”
“Tony-” Ryder began, but was cut off by Tony.
“He is not to be trusted. I have half the mind that if you were to ask him anything in regards to the location he would activate his kill switch over jeopardizing his loyalty with Ryder,” Cali said.
“I’m glad you’re helping out. The kids really like you there. Though I am hoping that maybe you just stop having secret meetings with your little black widows. I’m pretty sure last week, one of your little spies hacked into my phone and downloaded videos of black widows.”
So here he was with Miles and Steve at the grocery store with what almost seemed like a hundred people running up and down the aisles in hopes of gathering groceries to prepare for their Christmas meal.
Principal Davis leaned forward and rested his elbows on his desk. “Yes, and that is what counseling will be provided for.”
He needed Steve to stay with him and denounce everything that Ryder said. He wanted Steve to be the domino effect, not the domino effect of people leaving, but the domino effect of people staying and actually caring about him.
Your (currently sobbing in a corner from relief and sadness of saying goodbye) friend,
Tony still felt the phantom touch of Ryder’s hands on his reactor, then it shifted to being back in Afghanistan, then it transformed into Obie’s hands reaching for him, then it altered to someone who was unnamed reaching for the arc reactor with cold hands and stabbing the space below it, then it became Steve pressing the shield into his chest.
Tony’s eyes widened and he choked on air. He tried clearing his throat as he watched the woman look on in concern. He waved off the worry and the woman’s expression cleared just lightly.
“Look hand him over to me, while you get the things ready,” Bucky told Tony arms outstretched. “I took care of Steve way too many times to know how to handle someone who’s sick. I’m pretty sure there was a point he was smaller than this one of those times I took care of him.”
He raised his fists to meet Steve’s chest.
Steve tried to manfully stifle the coo he wanted to make at the adorable tired expression. He notably failed, when a quick awe slipped his lips and Tony raised one eyebrow artfully at him in response.
Agreed, Clint rested his hand on Steve’s shoulder.
A sound came like Tony was trying to stop himself from crying out.
“One long day. Now up, let Tony and us have some time together. I know Tony would like to go to the lab for a little bit,” Natasha teased, looking at Tony.
Steve’s eyes widened by Natasha’s declaration.
“First you’re not weak,” Steve said.
“You sure? I can…I can always just talk to my therapist about this. I mean I probably will tell him everything, but I thought it was nice to tell…because I can’t exactly see my therapist right now. But I didn’t think about how much it might mean for you to…”
“Ryder,” she said slowly. Just as she was connecting the dots, a man entered the living area carrying a small toddler on his hip.
He began to play with the hair at Steve’s nape.
Rhodey made a face at this. “It isn’t going. I am not going to fall in love with my physical therapist for your entertainment.”
Steve’s voice broke off mid-sentence and he palmed the back of his eyes. His breathing deepened and he dug the heel of his hands into his eyes as if shaking away dark thoughts.
Tony chewed at the insides of his cheek and looked at the papers scattered across his desk. “They came back.”
“Close the door,” Fury instructed.
The two said their goodbyes and Tony went back to shopping for groceries. Steve looked toward him and tossed a bag of apples into the cart. Miles swung his feet and bobbed his head to the song the grocery store was playing.
“Mr. Stark it is such a pleasure to have you here,” the receptionist said handing him back his ID. “The kids are so thrilled that you are able to make it here. Someday we’re going to have to get you back here so you can do a presentation or speech of your own.”
The sharp pain in his cheek interrupts him before he is able to say anything else.
“Sure,” Steve said.
Steve turned to him. “A favor? How is pushing me away a favor?”
U, having thought it won as DUM-E left, came closer to Tony only to get knocked off as DUM-E came whirling by knocking U onto the ground.
May nodded reassured. “Good.”
Steve remained silent.
“Do you know what you did wrong?” Miriam repeated taking off her jacket and throwing it against the toilet seat.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Tony whispered, afraid that this stranger could read into him. Granted Miles gave her a whole lot of information. He had to do better at hiding these things especially from his kid.
Ryder frowned. “Bracelet?”
Steve immediately looked to him checking to see if he was okay, before resuming his actions.
Steve nodded.
“Hey, I can walk by myself,” Tony argued, having a little bit more life into his voice. “Put me down.”
Karen rolled her eyes. “No.”
And by everything holy no wonder Tony had hated him, when they first met.
Tony pushed at Steve’s shoulders. “Alright, I give. Your super soldier stamina is fairly good.”
Tony sent a silent thank you to May, to which she responded with a smile.
Pepper leaned back to look Tony in the eye. “Then what are you nervous about.”
Cali’s hands shook as she kept looking at the door.
The only ones who were there were Steve, Bucky, Sam, Natasha, Clint, Wanda, and Vision. Wanda and Vision had been able to take a brief break from her training to attend the Gala. Tony had warmly welcomed them. He truly didn’t trust himself to be too close to Wanda. Even though he was hoping that she was getting her necessary help, he just couldn’t trust being close to her again at least not yet.
Coulson collapsed into the chair, placed beside the window and pressed the palm of his hands into his eyes. He breathed out sharply and tried reigning in the sense of panic at everything that was going on. Ignoring his panic, never fared well for him.
And that was all Steve needed. He needed that reassurance that Bucky had his back like always. Then looking toward Clint, he got a silent nod of approval and ran his hands over his bow looking satisfyingly at the wound he had left on Ryder’s shoulder.
Steve smiled and began to clean Tony with the wet washcloth and the lavender and vanilla soap Tony loved so much. In between cleaning, Tony had indeed fallen asleep much too tired with all the events from the day all the way from spending time with the kids to dealing with Ryder.
“Of course I do,” Steve said.
He saw Ryder’s will slowly wavering.
Ryder was quick to enter the bathroom that time and coo to him as though he were a child. He cleaned up Tony’s mess and helped him brush his teeth. Tony had bit at the fingers that came close to his lips. Ryder frowned and walked away.
“There, 650,” Sam said cheekily.
“I would like it for it to go into the rules that this winged creature, who is without wings be silenced while I present my building. I was silent during yours, I would like to be given the same courtesy,” Thor said, pushing away at Sam’s shoulder.
Something in his mind seemed to want to be brought to the forefront. Pepper’s words from their meeting a few hours ago echoed in his mind, but he pushed it back.
Tony immediately grew pale and his eyes dimmed slightly. He swallowed a lump in his throat and turned toward Miles, refusing to meet any of their eyes. He opened his mouth to say an equally stinging retort, but figured he just couldn’t…not today.
Ryder handed the party invite to Steve, picked up his briefcase, and left the kitchen.
Miles sent an unimpressed glare to Tony. Tony waved his hands in defeat. “Okay, bambino. Have at it.”
“Did you have a good time at the carnival bambino?” Tony asked as Miles laid his head on his shoulder.
“I have captured the startled expressions of Captain Rogers and Sgt. Barnes. Shall I send them to your phone Harley,” FRIDAY inquired.
“Hey, sorry I kind of hung up on you like that,” Tony said yawning into his shirt. “Some lady was talking to Miles and I had to go get him.”
Tony’s eyes followed Peter’s abrupt motion and he too began to get out of his seat. “Thanks for checking in. I’m fine. You can tell Ryder or not. I don’t care.”
“Oh come on Ryder. I’ve suffered worse than a little hit to my face,” Tony argued back. “And if you can’t see why I said no to your proposal you’re dumber than I was led to believe.”
Steve shook himself out of the thought as he watched the guards lock the prison cell that Ryder was in. He was content to leave then and there that was until he saw Ryder had the sign of waking and Steve truly wanted to be there the moment Ryder realized he was never getting out and never getting near Tony again.
However, Tony knew he needed help. He always knew, he just never knew when he needed to go or who he could actually turn to at least until Isa suggested one of her co-workers Dr. Sana. The Accords ramifications already implemented that the Avengers would have to agree to therapy, but Tony had plans of brushing it off until Isa made him promise to at least try.
“Tones when did you adopt a kid?” Rhodey questioned.
“You’re alright Mr. Stark,” Michelle nodded. “Don’t see how you got an intern job with him Peter.”
When Steve had finally taken the time to get to know Tony, he slowly realized that beyond the wall Tony had placed in front of himself he was rather expressive in his eyes. If one looked beyond the display he wanted to portray and actually took the time to look into his eyes, one would see stories there.
Bruce walked in, rubbing at his eyeglasses before setting them down on the bridge of his noise. “Please, Thor no five minute conversations over pop tarts, before I’ve had the chance to at least have some tea.”
Ryder was lying. Steve would not be the beginning of the domino effect. Tony told this to Ryder.
“I’m Tony that’s not what…” Steve sighed out frustrated.
Steve paused unsure if he should divulge what he had said. “Why is Tony not answering?”
Tony ran his fingers on Steve’s knee.
Miles rolled his eyes and crossed his arms. “I want baba’s food. He makes animals.”
“Ryder that’s a little tight. Loosen up,” Tony gasped.
Tony reciprocated the gesture leaning down to kiss Steve on the forehead. “Get some rest, Cap.”
Tony inhaled, trying to stop the murderous thoughts that were surging in his mind.
Tony smiled and nodded both of them, before leaving to go find Ryder.
“It is,” Clint whispered to Tony seriously. “Don’t let her convince you otherwise.”
He loved Steve.
“Couldn’t get in touch with Tony,” Steve said shrugging. “Told him he probably just doesn’t have it on sound. Besides Tony’s not that great at answering phone calls anyway. Probably shouldn’t worry too much.”
“He’s already left babe. Better luck trying to convince him he can’t drive, once he takes his test next month,” Tony said.
Tony looked at Steve. “I like my dreams. In them you always care about me. Always love me in my dreams. But when I wake up you leave me. Always leave me. Left me in the cold once and in the cold again. I don’t want to wake up this time. It’s too cold. Always too cold.”
Clint rolled his eyes, but let Natasha carry on nonetheless.
“He’s an idiot,” Steve announced. “Sorry, but I am trying to implement this new honest policy we have going and if Ryder can’t see how amazing you are with Miles then he’s stupid. Besides you didn’t spring a kid on him. It’s his own fault for not realizing how connected you two were. I only saw you two together for a few weeks and I knew. So stupid, he’s just stupid.”
And if that didn’t make Steve die a little inside.
“I…ah perhaps I should have started with what I followed you here for. So everything you read in the letter is true. That was me saying everything I wanted to say the moment I came back here…everything I wanted to say only a few months after getting to know you,” Steve explained. “But I felt I couldn’t. You were everything I thought I could never have. You were brilliant, sarcastic, kind, selfless, insightful, and confident.”
every night, when you were scared.”
By the time the two had made it to the Tower, Pepper was already situated in the board room. Immediately, without any thought she went over to Tony and wrapped him in a hug. Tony had his suspicions that Happy might have passed on what had happened, but now they were confirmed.
Bucky turned and Ryder was right. His neck had been hanging off. If Bucky had been paying attention, he would have maneuvered Tony’s body to a more comfortable position. It was probably best Ryder had come.
Tony raised himself on his toes and pressed a kiss to Steve. “I’ll see you when I get back home?” Tony questioned hesitantly. Even though they had just shared a kiss, Tony knew all too well how things could change quickly.
It was beautiful to see everyone together. The business in their lives, all the pain and suffering…it all brought them here to one another. Although cliché, Tony supposed that love had been quite effective in melding things together.
Met with no disagreements, everyone began to murmur who could be second best man.
Tony stifled his laughter in his blanket.
Steve realized his mistake, when Ryder pulled his head forward in order ram his head into Steve. Steve pulled back just enough for the impact to only hit him on the left side of his face. The bruise wouldn’t last longer than a day…but this anger well it certainly wouldn’t pass along so quickly.
“No. Look we’ve been interrogating him, right. But look Ryder has somehow managed to make himself look like and behave similar to his brother, Isak. From an outside perspective we’re holding an innocent man, who was unfortunately roped in with his brother’s schemes. But we both know that’s not right.”
He was allowed a few moments of rest, before he heard the supply closet door open. He almost started to angrily cry at the thought that it would be Ryder telling him he had to go back. He let out a noise of relief, when the brief light from the hallway revealed Steve.
“I don’t hear another solution Miss Potts,” Tony teased. “But fine board meetings how exciting.”
Peter cut his eyes to the woman and bit his lip so as to not say anything disrespectful. He found it dryly amusing she was saying that he and Harley were not quite respectable, while she was the least respectable in this room. Peter waited for Tony to defend himself, but he didn’t. If possible Tony seemed to take the accusation as truth. Now that Peter was not going to allow himself to be silent on.
“Because you are going to live with me.”
“I would say otherwise seeing as how I saw you just gulping down the alcohol Miriam gave you,” Ryder said cheekily. “Hey smile!”
“What can’t you two get in your head? I’m not good for him. I’m doing this because I love him,” Steve rushed out. “You think I wanted to tell Tony I had to leave. You think I wanted to make Tony feel like me leaving was his fault?”
“Like hell I would. Tony those people are toxic. I thought we agreed they would adjust to being back in America somewhere separate from you. It’s not your responsibility to help them acclimate back into their old lives.”
I hate the both of you.
“How can I not?”
“Yep, what he said.”
“This does seem to be a simple disagreement and no one was seriously harmed. However, you do understand that I have to hold these meetings. Now we will be having some issues resolve meeting to work through this problem between the boys. During the study hall period all three of you will go to the school counselor to talk and she will give me progress. Once you have satisfied those requirements, you will be free.”
“Oh, please don’t be honored. You think you were the only one who I had a relationship like this with? Oh, no you were just the only one that wasn’t strong enough to endure what I had to offer. Funny, how I was using all of them as preparation for my time with you. But at the end of it, you were the one that wasn’t ready. Stark men are made of iron has never meant anything, has it?”
“Sure, you haven’t seen
“Touch me here,” Tony said, hands grabbing Steve’s chin. Tony grabbed onto Steve’s hands and lifted his hips up, showing Steve just exactly where he wanted him. Steve swallowed and took the instruction easily.
Tony laughed loudly at Steve slightly smacking his behind.
He slid his eyes over to Isak, who without speaking knew the implications of what his brother was saying. He leant closer to his wife and his daughter, pressing a hand against her back.
They had forgotten that there were two separate entrances to the interrogation room.
“Hey, what’s wrong?”
Bruce shifted on his feet and scratched the back of his neck nervously. “It’s ah a long story.”
Or would he wrap him up in and towel and speak softly to him as he usually did when he had those waterboarding sessions?
Pepper narrowed her eyes and held her hand out. “And why did you not deliver this at the hotel we are staying out. Better yet how do you have our location after all?”
“Hey, now don’t go doubting yourself. When you start doubting yourself, you lose focus of what you truly want. You remember when we went on missions with Howling Commandos we couldn’t let doubt cloud our thoughts because if we did one or all of us could die. Doubt here means you could lose Tony. So just…you know don’t do that,” Bucky trailed off awkwardly.
“The only cool thing about you,” Michelle dryly said leaning forward on her elbows. “Since you’re going home can I have your lunch?”
Isak’s jaw tightened. “That’s an awful statement to make.”
“I know that when you were with her, you would write down things that she would say because you loved her and you trusted her. You trusted her words because she lived through them. And then when she started forgetting you would remind her of the words she spoke to you so she could remember. You had a book full of those quotes. Then it was taken from you wasn’t it?”
Natasha swung Julie onto her hip. “Of course I can. Besides our group will be the best. And I can teach you all how to sight if anyone has rigged the games, so you can appropriately decide the next course of action,” she whispered to them.
Wordlessly, Tony handed the letter to Rhodey for him to read.
“We’re keeping an eye on him,” Bruce said. “He’s…been better.”
Tony wasn’t meant to tell anyone.
He couldn’t wait till he could send his fist through his teeth. He pulled back his chair and stood up with the binder.
“Hey, Mrs. Keener.”
“I can finally breathe,” she said fanning herself.
(See the end of the chapter for
For once Steve was finally getting a response. He saw the way his eyes darkened and clouded over with malice. His hands twitched in the cuffs and Steve noticed the discomfort settling in his body.
“Language,” Steve warned, but Harley was already too busy openly daydreaming about Julia.
“Sorry about that. Ryder wanted to tell me about his progress,” Tony explained laughing. “Alright I am ready for my funnel cake.”
Peter stayed silent afraid of interrupting.
“The boys?”
Rhodey exclaimed he would go with Pepper to May’s.
Steve shook his head. “I just wanted to give my speech standing, you know?”
His body sank into the bed and he wanted to cry in pure happiness that he was back home away from that room and that hotel. He looked to the door and realized it had been cracked slightly to the point where it was nearly closed, but just open enough that Tony knew he could leave if he wanted to.
“And I just kept thinking how this all wouldn’t have happened if you had trusted me…if you had really cared about me even as a teammate. But I was never that for you and it was my fault for assuming. I just…I don’t know maybe it was the way that Howard would always tell me stories about how great you were and how honorable that I put you on a high pedestal. Surely this great and honorable person wouldn’t lie about the truth of one of his teammate’s parents’ death. But you did.”
Natasha walked toward the doctor, who looked pained. “Ms. Romanoff and Mr. Rogers I am sure you can understand what I had to do.”
“Crap, sorry. Fuck, I’m messing things up again,” Tony bemoaned. “Fuck, can’t ever get things right. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sure, makes this wish that you hadn’t found me? Don’t need a sarcastic asshole back, am I right?”
His bright eyes staring at him would have been adorable, if it hadn’t been for the thinly veiled edged of panic taking over his expression.
Tony swung Miles up as he stood. “Of course you are my little hungry monster. Of course you are.”
The two carried on their back and forth, until the song’s end came. With a flurry of motions the two loudly exclaimed, “It means no worries for the rest of your days! It’s our problem free philosophy! Hakuna Matata!”
“Of course I’m right. You know I thought all this time, you would finally realize that I am often the voice of reason in our relationship,” Bucky said. “But I’m serious you can’t do this on your own and you’re even foolish for thinking anyone would let you do so. I’m pretty certain Pepper would stab you with her heel, if she had any idea you were going to keep Tony up in here.”
When Tony woke up, he tried ignoring the way his body seemed to scream at him. For a few moments he just laid in his bed, staring at the ceiling. Fingers traveled over his body lightly touching the bruises that were left behind from yesterday. Yesterday there had been a harshness to Ryder’s touch that hadn’t been there before. Tony knew he would be upset about him adopting Miles, but he figured since three whole days had passed without Ryder mentioning the adoption, he was safe.
“How did you meet this old rascal,” Miriam teased.
Tony smiled brightly at her, eyes still a little red-rimmed from crying.
“And I know you are all smart. Steve I know you are fairly intelligent. Any person who is able to acclimate into the 21
He deserved knowing Tony would never want him.
Bucky pulled his shoulders toward his neck as if being reprimanded and Steve became angry with Pepper making Bucky feel this way.
Miles looked puzzled. “I don’t know. But you color really good Mr. Steve. Can we color the robot?”
“No!” he yelled then added softly, “No, of course not Tony. Look Ryder’s lying to you okay, he’s trying to hurt you. He doesn’t care about you.”
Tony looked ahead of him, toward the fountain. He watched as the colors transformed and was transfixed for a moment.
“Ryder-”
“Of course,” Tony claimed.
He was pulled up again. His head rolled to the side and he couldn’t stop coughing up water. Miriam looked gleefully at him. Eva seemed distraught and Luka by then had left at Miriam’s insistence. He remembered Luka hesitating at pushing him back in and had hoped that would be the end. But then Miriam had taken over and she seemed harsher in her movements.
“So you said you wanted to see me Rogers,” Tony replied, his expression soft and unguarded.
Steve raised an inquiring eyebrow. “Drugs aren’t good for you kid.”
Tony’s lips quivered, heart pounding at Steve’s confession. Steve professing his love wasn’t unheard of, but Tony was always brought back with how much Steve felt. In some ways, it was always a pleasant surprise to feel this way…to be the recipient of such affection.
They had pushed aside those curious feelings that were whelming inside of them. There would be time later and if not there would be time later to at least dream again those dreams Tony had long since buried.
“So you’re straight,” Steve repeated.
He left the room and made no action to turn the lights off. He felt if he did…
“Yeah, okay,” Tony said looking up at Steve, wanting to tell him he didn’t have to pretend like he needed him.
Clint giggled and rubbed his hands together. “Oh I like this talking Bucky. So was there crying involved or hugging?”
“Now. And I mean sparkling. Dress to impress.”
“And what about you? Enjoying your first Stark Charity Christmas Gala?” Tony asked. He placed his hands in his pockets and rocked back onto the heels of his feet. “I know it can get a lot for some first timers with you know introducing yourself. Pretty sure everyone wanted to meet you as soon as you walked in.”
“He’s a tough one, but he’s oh so perfect when you’re finally inside. He falls apart so prettily,” Ryder breathed.
“Thanks for that by the way. I know keeping things a secret had to have been a little difficult,” Steve said as they finally made it to the car. He threw in Peter’s bag in the truck, after realizing that he couldn’t put his things in the backseat since they’d be picking up Harley and Miles shortly after leaving the airport.
Steve bent over and held a hand to his chest. “Tony that’s not true. You have a lot of people who care. I love you. Miles loves and misses you like crazy. I caught Peter looking at his vlog videos of the two of you all night. Natasha was sitting in your lab, while she went through files. We care about you Tony.”
“Cali…told you,” Tony whispered, waiting for the betrayal to settle in his heart. He had trusted her. “You…why are you talking like you don’t know what happened. Like you weren’t there?”
“Okay.”
Tony looked back into the house and smiled wearily.
“Were you going to hit him?” Tony screamed face growing tight with anger. “How dare you? I told myself I’d never be Howard and I sure as hell would never be like Maria who let her kid suffer abuse” Tony bit out. “And you wonder why I need a break from your-”
Harley sniffled and a cry escaped his lips. Steve rubbed his back gently.
“And it was true. You all weren’t my soldiers, just like the Commandos just weren’t my soldiers. In way you all easily became my family and maybe I allowed that to happen so fast because I needed some ties to this world. I needed to feel like I was gaining something, instead of feeling like I was losing everything to the point where I was losing myself”
“Hey, kiddo. I was just checking up on Miles and saw he wasn’t in bed.”
Steve immediately brightened, imagining that this meant he could get the chance to spend more time with Tony. “Yes, we would love to go. Sounds fun.”
“You won’t be disappointing her at all. I promise. I just have to do something, okay?”
“And I promised to be patient. I…I let…” Tony sniffed and could not finish his statement.
Tony wasn’t getting this. Okay, just rip it off like a Band-Aid. He hated the maker of that expression.
Steve’s expression turned solemn and he bent his head forward so as to not meet Isa’s inquiring gaze. Natasha who had lifted her eyes from her own packet watched Steve and decided she would have to privately talk to him later.
Miles’ eyes brightened considerably and he nodded excitedly. He held onto Tony closer and rubbed at his nose. “Goin’ home with you baba?”
“Look I’m fine. I’m just at the park with Miles and Peter. I’ll probably be back in another hour or so.”
His body froze from its spot under Steve’s arm, laid loose over his waist. His jaw tightened and he fought to have calming breaths, in hopes of centering himself before he woke up Steve. He counted to twenty as he took in his surroundings. He shifted to the side a little, lifting his hips a bit to carefully remove Steve’s arm off of him.
The woman’s eyes brightened. “Oh! A friend? You know he’s never really mentioned having any friends from back home. But I will tell him. Hold on.”
Peter shrugged. “Got into an argument. Tony’s giving him the silent treatment for a little while.”
Rhodey mock-saluted him and ended the call.
Steve’s chest grew tight and he knew that he had a long way to go, but he was never one for giving up.
Steve swallowed the knot in his throat and blinked away the tears that wanted to fall.
“But…I have to say it’ll make for an interesting documentary. They always love that stuff. I mean come on billionaire, former playboy, philanthropist, and Avengers stuck in the abusive relationship then kept captive for however long…and then he’s rescued. Man, can someone say Golden Globe awards,” Isak said cheekily.
“So, obviously I care about you the most here,” Sam smiled.
“Uh, no. Either side is fine with me,” Tony said yawning.
“Oh, Winston was here. He’s moved up faster than I thought,” Miriam addressed to Cali who was trying to make herself seem small.
Tony’s heart softened at the gesture that someone was so happy for this engagement that it brought them to happy tears. The night continued in this manner, food being passed between each other, chairs being brought out so that everyone could sit down.
"Hmmm," is all I can say about this for now...but don't fear Ryder will be getting his due very, very soon I promised you all and I always keep my word lol.
“He has?” Clint implored rather confusedly. Clint had done nothing to deserve any kindness.
“Go,” Cali explained once she had got done resetting Tony’s arm. “My sister won’t be asleep for long and Ryder will come back in a day. Take this hoodie cover your face. There will be a driver downstairs who will not ask questions. He will drive you to a plane. Get on the plane and he will take you home.”
Pepper smoothed her hands over his hair and he leant into the touch, the only good touches that he had received in the past few days. He blinked back the tears, feeling his eyelashes heavy with teardrops. Pepper moved back and sat in her seat, Rhodey soon followed her lead.
Harley raised his legs and propped his chin on his knees. He face his head to the door and tried to discreetly wipe away tears that were falling. Peter meanwhile let his fall freely, tears catching onto his chin before falling onto his lap.
“Hey, no. Look that’s all in the past,” Tony said, hands going to wipe at a tear that Steve hadn’t even known that he had cried. “I shouldn’t have even brought it up.”
“Would the Accords have saved your parents, if they were to have existed? Would the Accords had saved you from that cave in Afghanistan? Would the Accords have stopped the death of many innocents done by your hand? Can the Accords forgive all the red you have left behind in your wake?”
“No, it’s fine Tony. Look I’ve just been stressed. Some of the treatments aren’t working on the kids down here and I’m putting all my negative feelings on you. That’s isn’t fair,” Ryder confessed.
Steve grew amazed at Tony’s speechlessness. He was hoping that the gift would be well received, but Tony not being able to form a coherent sentence was unexpected.
Almost everyone was gathered in the kitchen eating breakfast, except for Tony.
“I am not lying and I do not appreciate you making me out to be a liar,” Isak professed. “Now, I’ll admit your teammate, Tony, is rather handsome. Had I not been married
“I’m thinking that maybe having meetings and keeping up with the kids for two weeks straight was a good thing, if it means sex like this. I mean goodness Steve I don’t think I’ve pulled out some of those moves, since the 90s. You’re welcome by the way,” Tony laughed.
“Steve did you see Miles leave?” Tony questioned.
But Ryder had never gotten the chance to fuck Tony, when they were in college. Maybe that’s why when he first came back into his life, he was ready to share that part of himself with Ryder. It was him being allowed to have part of that bit of his youth back. He hoped that his promises of taking care of him in that respect would have been true, but it hadn’t been. Tony had only seen that, when Ryder took him apart with no care of how uncomfortable Tony had been. Tony had always wondered if his parents hadn’t come over that next morning, if his first time letting Ryder in would have been as amazing as Ryder insisted and not as painful as the real version that he had experienced.
Steve looked at him to continue.
His shaking hands wanted to soothe the bruises left behind, he wanted to kiss every trace of visible skin and mutter praises into them. He wanted to offer comfort to Tony, hold him in his embrace and be a steady presence behind him.
He moved closer to Ryder and grabbed ahold of his chin, staring down at him.
Steve straightened his lips in faux seriousness. “I need silence from Mr. Stark and Mr. Jaime please. This requires my full focus.”
Tony went to grab Miles and settled him on his hip, despite Miles trying to be put down. Eventually he gave up and just settled on Tony’s hip, and laid his head on his chest.
Well, guess his assumptions were wrong.
“But Sam never told me. This isn’t all my fault. He could have let me know, instead of stewing for a whole week,” Bucky pouted. “I didn’t want him to be feeling that upset or angry for that long.”
Tony ran a finger of the design markings and smiled sadly. “Yeah, people always assumed my dad and I were the only geniuses of the family. However, they often forget that my dad met my mom when he visited his friends at Harvard. My mom was brilliant it’s just when Howard started diminishing her ideas is when she lost that fire for her own research. I’m pretty sure these were part of the last designs my mom and I made together. I had stumbled upon her working one night on some prosthetic designs and regenerative limb research and being so fascinated with it all.”
Wanda wished that she could have some alone time with him. She knew that she could pull the fears to the forefront of his mind. She could make him scream in desperation, claw at his skin as thought it was his enemy, and cry to the heavens for forgiveness.
Then that was when Miles pulled out a purple lollipop that looked mysteriously like the ones Clint sometimes had in the house. He allowed himself five seconds to fill the betrayal, before he went over to Miles.
Steve broke off and dropped Tony’s hands.
“I know and I’m sorry that we’ve made you continue thinking this way, even when we’ve been knowing you for years. And you don’t have to talk to me about it today, tomorrow, or even months later. But I don’t want you going around ever thinking that whatever happened was your fault or that the abuse you’re suffered was because of you not being strong. Because that’s not the case. And I’ll tell you that every day if you need me to.”
Tony’s mouth gaped open and Pepper looked pleasantly surprised.
Steve growled, menacingly, in the back of his throat.
“No…I’m…sorry. Sorry, you all had to hear that. I didn’t want that. You all, I never wanted…” Tony stuttered, falling all over his words. He didn’t know how all of that had spun so out of his control. The end result was fine, but getting there. He hadn’t known Ryder would try explaining everything.
Ryder was the first to leave, before the others were soon to follow.
She looked toward the door, hoping that someone in medic would have come up by now.
Tony quickly grew aware of where he was at and threw his legs off of Bucky’s lap. He stood up being mindful not to shake too much. His cheeks reddened in embarrassment as he leaned in to Ryder’s grasp.
Peter looked down at his hands and picked at the skin there.
Tony’s body went pliant as Steve laid him down. Steve left for a second to gather something more fitting than the hospital gown that they had placed on Tony’s body. He reached in for some warm pajama pants and a hoodie, both of which helped with the coldness that Tony might wake up feeling.
“But…you can’t just…Mr. Rogers.”
“You are literally a child. I see two children in this room right now. I am having trouble deciding which is older,” Rhodey dryly stated. “Plus who told you anything about Miranda and her assets?”
Natasha stood up and Tony followed her lead.
Steve didn’t dare allow himself to look back, not even when he heard Tony’s body fall to the ground and heard sobs rack through his body.
His mouth opened, in the form of a question. He felt the story wasn’t over, but he had been holding this question in him, ever since Tony had first started talking to him. He wondered if an appropriate time to even discuss that question was now. He didn’t know if it would be alright to even bring something up that was that traumatic, not that anything else Tony had said wasn’t traumatic enough on its own.
Steve did as commanded, pressing forward in that one spot. He felt himself begin to come apart. But he needed Tony to get there before him. After all, it was always his hopes for himself to bring Tony apart first.
This had to be a sign.
He couldn’t wait till those five days were up.
Steve stepped closer.
Few moments of silence passed, before Steve stood up. “Can I wash the blood off of your hands?”
“I’m not devising some master plan Mr. Rogers. I am rather offended you think so lowly of me. I simply acted out in the best interests of Tony.”
“Wouldn’t need to be pardoned, if they weren’t.”
“Okay. You both have fun. I’ll be back to pick you all up shortly,” Happy regarded Tony and went back to the driver’s side of the car.
“Guess, we’ll find out yeah,” Bruce said, whose arms were now full of an energetic child taking pieces of fruit out of his bowl.
Tony broke away from Steve’s grasp and headed toward the door. “Got it. Merchant is my safe word. Now, let’s get this over with. This certainly hadn’t been in my plans for the evening.”
“Oh, is this how Bucky forgot his and Sam’s two year anniversary?” Natasha said, sitting down at the table and helping Steve untangle the lights.
“How do you know all of that,” Steve said, hoping that this was the moment that tipped him off.
Rhodey tightened his hold on Tony. “Any person is blessed to have you in their life, to love you Tones. How could Steve not love you?”
Tony was calming himself internally to stop the thunderous racing of his heart. The first piece of glass being taken out with a tweezer barely registered in Tony’s mind because he was so focused on staring at Steve’s face as his serious gaze was directed toward Tony’s hands.
Tony and Steve were putting up groceries, when Tony pulled out a box of fruit snacks. He frowned, distinctly remembering that he had made sure that he hadn’t bought any. He turned to look at Steve who was looking down with flushed cheeks.
“Why? Why leave me?”
Fury held his head down as Tony entered the interrogation room. He sat down in the chair opposite of Ryder, who was smiling at Tony as though Tony wouldn’t know.
, he told himself.
Also I made some update schedule changes for the next three chapters. For my "I apologize in advance for many tears shed" 3 part series
Also if he didn’t give him something now, he had no doubt in his mind that somehow Tony would find a way to get some coffee into his system. Steve walked back into the room, holding the now steaming bowl of soup. Tony accepted it easily, blowing onto the spoon before feeding himself some.
“Of course, Tones,” Rhodey said.
It had all been too damn close.
Heat mixed in with the cold and the sharp turn of temperature disoriented him. He felt dizzy and fragmented…like he didn’t belong in his skin.
His chest heaved up and down. His finger nails pieced into his palms. Feeling himself go into a dark place he leaned over the couch. Closing his eyes, he started trying to calm himself down. Suddenly, he felt his body close in on itself.
“I’m a supersoldier,” Tony repeated in a high-pitched voice. “Yeah, and I am Tony fucking Stark.”
He walked into the main living area and saw Bucky gathering some books into his bag. He raised an eyebrow, which was received by a half shrug. Steve laughed shortly and turned away intending to go into the kitchen and grab a bottle of water and some snacks. However, his movements were stopped, when he felt a body barrel into his.
“Hey, can I talk to you outside on the balcony for a second,” Steve whispered not loud enough to hear over the carol of children.
The two then continued talking about finding ways to prove that Tony was one of the greatest humans that ever existed. They were going to do their own little outside work. The two were so involved in discussing their plans that they hadn’t realized the time passing. Harley went to go use the restroom and Peter placed his earbuds back in his ear.
Steve nodded, biting his lip in concentration. He held up two different sized pots to Bucky. “Okay, which one of these do you think I should make the pasta in? I was thinking about using the larger one, that way we could have leftovers.”
After the conversation he had with Tony, he was pretty certain that he was the reason for Tony’s bad dreams. Talking about everything in the past year probably brought everything up to the surface for Tony. He didn’t want to be reminders of a terrible past for Tony.
Tony raise his hands in defense. “He’s at Michelle’s. They’re studying at Leauna’s for their academic decathlon or something of the sort. Peter thinks it’s a date.”
Ryder smiled then spat out the tooth that had been dangling.
May raised an eyebrow at him. “Tony I’m pretty sure he’s sleeping the appropriate hours necessary. It’s just who
“Well what other kind are there? To the dinosaur nuggets we go!” Tony shouted and skipped to the kitchen, enjoying how the child’s laughter followed him.
“Any person would take time to forgive the transgressions of those idiots. Some wouldn’t find it in themselves to forgive at all.”
“Finally. You two took forever to get ready. Remember I need to get to school early so I can set up my project presentation with my group. We need to leave in like eight minutes at the latest,” Harley rushed out, mouth full with food.
Tony shrugged. “Well, that’s not too much more to it honestly. We started drifting apart and soon I stopped caring what the reason was.”
“Okay, preoccupied child. Red and gold headphones. You think you’re cute, right? I don’t like kids very much, but I have to admit its adorable seeing him with Iron Man headphones. Soft thighs,” Ryder softly muttered so as to not let anyone hear.
Peter sat down in the chair Pepper had once occupied and Harley sat in the chair that Rhodey was once in. Miles looked hesitantly at the tubes that Tony was still connected to and then toward the arm cast.
Steve looked out the window of the quinjet, silently observing the view below them. How infinitely small they were compared to everything up here. He wondered if Tony thought the same thing every time he flew as Iron Man.
“Why?” Steve inquired.
“Conscious?” Tony couldn’t help laughing once Happy started laughing over Miles mispronunciation.
He heard the door open and then close. He tightly closed his eyes and tried evening his wheezing breaths. He curled his arms tightly around his arc reactor, the place he was most vulnerable. Usually, Ryder left him alone if he was sleeping.
“I will allow it this time,” Tony claimed.
Tony laughed as Natasha loudly sang, “And oh the shame!”
“And to think you call yourself a spy,” Tony murmured. “How do these things go unnoticed with you? I think you two may want to watch your surroundings when you go back to your group.”
Bucky looked after Sam’s retreating figure.
Cali leaned back wordlessly and picked up Tony’s head. Tony shivered and shook. He smacked his lips together and turned sluggish eyes toward Miriam. Miriam petted his hair and then leaned over to grab another bottle.
“Oh, Tony. You should know not to try and get away. You must be disciplined for that. Eva, Luka hold him,” Miriam instructed.
Clint looked at the ceiling. “Ah, I remember when Laura would give me the silent treatment. She could last up to a month. But I have to say it made the making up part a whole lot more fun, if you know what I mean.”
The two continued down the main floor hallways until Tony noticed a figure approach them. The figure came into focus as he got closer. Upon closer inspection, Tony realized it was Harley. Miles immediately wiggled on Tony’s hip in hopes that Tony would let him go. Tony did as Miles wanted and watched as Miles ran to Harley, who easily picked him up.
“But things were still fine…at least I thought they were,” Tony joked.
Tony fell into listening to Miles excited ramblings, going in on his time with Aunt Pepper and the others. Tony made sure to send Pepper all of her favorite things for making sure that Miles’ was far removed from this as he possibly could be. He hugged Miles tighter to him and at some point didn’t even realize he had fallen asleep, until he could no longer hear Miles’ talking.
“And maybe it’s unconventional me asking you like this, but I can’t live with myself knowing that the only thing my son will remember me by our trips to the hospital. I want to go out and do something that he can be proud about. And I’ll rest easier knowing that he has someone like you watching over him, while I am away.”
“Shit,” Clint breathed out.
“It’s okay, I’m here. I’m here,” Tony whispered.
Unfortunately, I cannot give you a fluffy chapter as an apology...soooooo *hides under rock*
“Why are you up there bambino?” Tony tried in a more calm voice looking around for a step stool.
“Excuse me sir,” Karen spoke. “You both know this is not how we behave. And why am I still not hearing apologies or seeing you two hug.”
“We have Ryder in custody,” Fury stated without any hesitation.
Tony dug out his phone and handed it to Peter who then gave it to Miles. Tony sat in the chair beside Harley and nodded his head as Mrs. Thompson who was cooing over her son. Flash seemed to preen at the attention and Tony didn’t mistake the glint of mischief in that kids’ eyes.
Tony scrunched up his face. “Uh, thanks? Tiny human body needs to breathe then.”
His thoughts shifted as he pushed the question aside, not quite ready to give an answer.
He placed it over Tony’s shoulder, looking at how the thick material seemed to swallow him up. Steve went back to holding his hand. He watched the steady rise and fall of Tony’s chest.
He said it aloud again.
As he walked into the building, he went straight to the kitchen to place Miles’ medicine in the medicine cabinet. Upon reaching the kitchen, he was startled when he saw his former teammates sitting down and staring at Ryder who was leaning against the countertop.
Everyone in the kitchen, sans Sam and Bucky began chuckling. Steve stuffed his mouth with a piece of toast, before handing a full plate to Tony. Tony accepted it graciously and began to eat. Steve smiled softly at him, kissing the corner of his mouth fully aware that no one’s attention was on them, instead entirely focused for the moment on Sam and Bucky’s complete and utter lack of secrecy.
Miles picked up his shovel and said sternly. “I don’t like him baba. He makes you cry. People that love you don’t make you cry baba.”
Steve placed the phone back in his pocket and smiled to himself. Rather happily he went to placing the leftovers in Tupperware and placing them in the refrigerator. Unbeknownst to him, Bucky had re-entered the kitchen having already eaten his dinner and going just to wash his and the boys dishes. He watched on silently as Steve hummed around the kitchen placing things in saran wrap and such.
Anyways, I have to go. Meeting in two hours. Wish me luck.
“I would like to see proof that my sister is alive,” Cali spoke.
“Plus I am just so tired of having him bounced around back and forth. He also says he enjoys Midtown High School. I think he’d be terribly upset if he had to leave the friends he’s made there. So Steve just please consider it. Like I said I still have to wait to be discharged and see if they even accept my application.”
“Oh, we can talk about this when I get into town? Oh, you mean before or after I have to meet with Pepper and Rhodey so I can tell them my intentions with you as your boyfriend. Like Tony you didn’t even ask if I agreed to this,” Ryder hissed.
“Well that’s going to have to change. Think about how people will view our relationship, when you are out here kissing everyone that isn’t me and…”
“Because if me saying I forgive them gets them to stay, I’ll keep telling them I forgive them. It’s fine. Eventually they’ll forgive me for whatever they think I need forgiveness over and it’ll be okie dokie.”
“You know Tony and I. We’re complete opposites. Ever since the day I met him we would clash. There was something refreshing about that because ever since I woke up everyone wanted to treat me like someone to worship. And I hated that. They wanted me to be what the stories were. And it got tiring of having people need you to be something above the normal person. And Tony saw that. He didn’t treat me like someone whose ground that I walked on should be kissed.”
“But how can I? You’ve chosen two perfect colors,” Steve groaned. “This is so hard.”
“Like I was saying,” he continued as though Steve wasn’t mere seconds away from chocking him to lifelessness. “You’ve probably read up on Tony and noticed he was kind of troubled as a kid getting up to all types of nonsense.”
When they made it to the main floor where Bucky, Miles, and Harley were, the first thing Tony noticed was Miles adorably trying to keep himself awake. His body was slowly losing its upright position only to be jerked back when either Bucky or Harley gave a loud shout to the game. Miles’ eyes would the unfocusedly shoot between the two, before his eyelids fluttered close for a few seconds.
Tony’s lips tilted in a smirk, remembering with all the arguments that stemmed from that fact alone.
“Yeah, once I realized that you were planning on doing 100. I couldn’t let you eat a 100 lollipops Tony. That was going to end horribly wrong,” Rhodey said.
“I can’t tell if you’re lying or not, but that creeped me out. Could they have downloaded pictures of cute puppies or rainbows instead?”
“I mean, hey you have to admit he looks rather beautiful all bruised up like that. There is something gorgeous in having ownership over someone. My brother just probably wasn’t able to do it properly. Maybe they were still ironing out the kinks in it. He was never good at taking care of things for a long time,” Isak said.
After a series of meetings, Tony was so thankful that Rhodey was meeting up with Pepper and himself for lunch. He needed a break from that lot of annoying business people. Sometimes he really wanted to just fire them. He’d have to ask Pepper about that a little later.
Cali shook her head, somber expression deepening even further.
All throughout the story, Tony’s back grew tense and his fingers were now clutching the bowl of soup tightly. It was as short and abrupt as the end of his friendship with Ryder had truly been.
“Tony is not a plaything. I don’t care where you think your loyalty lies may I remind you that you are here under my control and I am the Captain that is placing you on the tightrope between life and death.”
Well until Ryder.
Steve lost the sentiment of the tease, instead choosing to open his mouth in shock. He blinked his eyes a few times confused as to why on earth Bekah was going to entrust Harley into his care. Sure, he loved having the kid around, but he wasn’t sure if he had the necessary skills to be a full on guardian.
He pulled the covers up tighter to his chest and wished away the coldness. He also wished there was more light offered in this room beside the lamp and the light fixture above his head. A nurse came in carrying a food tray. She made her pleasantries and sat it near Tony’s bed. Tony said thank you and as she was leaving as for her to crack the door. She must not have heard him because she closed the door firmly shut behind her.
At this Tony grew slightly upset. “Why are you doing this? Are you trying to confuse me or something?”
“After long deliberation and countless arguments from our judges, we have finally reached a winner. Ms. Karen and Uncle Tony, if you could kindly follow us,” Peter addressed them.
“I know you’re not, but your baba is a busy man and he needs all the rest he can get. Do you think you can be a good boy and let him sleep for just a little longer?”
“See I saved you from being a little sugar baby.”
“Want some gum?” Ryder questioned opening up the packet.
Steve said this, but he really had no intention of moving. This was the most time he had spent with Tony in the past year and he wanted more of it. So he was genuinely surprised when Tony opened his mouth.
“I can’t just sit here Shuri and do nothing! It’s been almost a month since Tony has been gone and we haven’t found anything. Sure, we have some lady locked up and a few others, but they’re very dedicated to not saying anything. We are literally at the same point where were in, when he was taken. And it’s all my fault,” Peter ranted while pulling the rest of his suit out of his backpack.
“But then Cali called me, saying that you all had come to save you and that I should leave. So I hightailed it out of there. I didn’t too much mind being on the end of a witch hunt. I knew you weren’t the one who was trying to leave. They just took you.”
A love without conditions.
Tony grew lightheaded from where this conversation was going. He knew that kids picked up on things, but had he really been letting his son see what was happening to him. He didn’t want those problems to be public for Miles.
“Protect me!” Tony screamed. “That’s what you tell yourself? That was not protection. I don’t need your protection. I have never needed anyone’s protection. What I needed was honesty. What I needed was for you to tell me everything and let me deal with the consequences. Sure, would I have blamed Bucky and resented him? Yes. But I would never have tried to kill him or punish him. I would have just needed time, but you took that away from me.”
“You’re doing an amazing job,” Steve truthfully admitted staring straight at Tony.
“Pumpkin? Doll? Daffodil? The apple to my pie? The straw to my berry? The chocolate to my banana?”
“Eloquently put Rogers,” Tony said though he was slowly losing his smile.
I march with greatened speed
Tony didn’t dare allow himself to be hopeful. However, Wanda’s hopeful smile at the back of him and Pepper’s excited squeal caused him to want to look behind himself.
, Tony thinks darkly.
“I won’t disappear. Promise. I’ll stay right here,” Steve said drawing his hand back.
“Is there still a place for me to move in to?” Steve asked her.
Steve shrugged his shoulders and admitted, “I know…I know I’m still just trying to view therapy not as a form of weakness or punishment.”
Clint turned to him. “No offense kid, but you’re just an intern. Let us handle this okay. We’ll let you know if there’s anything to know. You can help with Pepper.”
“You’re growing a beard?”
“Oh, yeah? By the end of this week I would like a report. Do not disappoint me Parker,” Shuri laughed.
“So I’ve heard,” Rhodey teased. “But in all seriousness how are you holding up?”
Coulson took control of the situation and offered that they all meet in the main living area. Cali followed all of them and chose to sit opposite of them all. Her posture was wound tight and her lips were pursed.
, Tony thought to himself letting that last remaining bit of coldness ease its way out of his body. He leaned further into the hold of Clint and Natasha whose arms were now tightly wrapped around him as they leaned over to grab different blocks. He felt peaceful, telling Thor and Sam where to build a certain door.
Kevin grumbled something under his breath.
“No, Ryder. You really can’t. It’s crazy that you want to hold onto this imaginary grudge against me. And even if I had been the so called reason for you leaving MIT, that gives you no reason to treat me as you did. You were…fuck Ryder,” Tony breathed out harshly, anger taking everything out of him.
Tony clenched down his body spasmed chasing after a growing release. “Harder,” Tony moaned deeply, nails scratching at Steve’s back leaving a fiery trail in its wake.
“And that’s what spring break is for babe.”
“That’s not fair.”
“Do not! Do not!” Miles screamed. “Left me here! I want penguin and Dum-E and FRIDAY. Why leave? Was I bad?”
Karen laughed. “Alright, let’s go deal with this yeah and then appropriately get started on the decorations?”
Tony’s eyes widened at that. “Please don’t. I don’t need you two giving Steve the shovel talk. Besides I’m not even sure that there is need for a shovel talk.”
Peter titled his head. “Really?”
He still remained a short distance away from him as to not crowd Tony.
“Bull shit Clint. You just did that. You’ve been doing that ever since we got here. Everyone is trying and you’re not even making an effort,” Natasha honestly told him.
He opened his eyes and pleaded for his ma to speak to him just this once. And then as if through an underserving grace or his half sleep-riddle mind he heard her.
Tony opened his eyes and tried to cease the shaking in his body and the tears that were falling on his cheeks.
He sobered up. He didn’t remember being unconscious. Then he listened to the other part of Cali’s statement. Ryder had his armor. Granted he wouldn’t really be able to access the suit without his voice command, but the fact still stood that he had it.
“Tell me again, when you’re awake,” Tony pleaded, leaving one last kiss to his cheek, before turning to leave for the door.
“And you didn’t think to tell me,” Ryder hissed as he straddled Tony’s hips. He pressed his wet fingers against Tony’s hips and scratched at the soft skin there. Tony let out a hiss and tried pushing Ryder’s hands away from him.
And as promised here is the chapter! See you all again on Saturday ;)
“But it didn’t last very long. It almost seemed to change without me nothing it for the longest. I don’t know if that’s because he was so good at hiding things or just because I wasn’t looking.”
“Oh, yeah,” Peter sheepishly replied. “He’s been having trouble sleeping. So he’s come to Harley’s room a few nights and mine whenever I’m here.”
He would never admit it out loud, but he had hoped to see Miriam’s face as her sounds of laughter transferred to screaming.
“If you truly believed me to be noble, then you would know that I’m not going to give up on someone I love. Especially if there’s a chance those feelings may be returned,” Steve addressed. “And quite honestly if you knew that Tony loved you back, you wouldn’t be so concerned with me fighting for him.”
Steve, Bucky, and Clint all trailed after the guards neither of them comfortable with just leaving him there. They all needed the assurance that he would be in that cell, once they left for good. The guards had told them that the majority of the CMPNY were here in the Raft and the other lesser offences had been relocated at other prison holdings. Admittedly, some CMPNY were unhappy with Ryder’s role in their capture.
Pepper sighed softly. “Yeah, I think that’s what bothers me and…well…” her sentence tapered off.
A little kid peeked through the cracks of the door and smiled. She gave the “I’m watching you motion” with her fingers and closed the door behind her.
Tony’s breathe caught and he wiped at his eyes, vision in front of him going blurry and he didn’t want one moment of this picture of family to be wasted. His eyes cleared and it centered again on everyone in here not a moment of love lost between anyone.
She undid the ties at his hands and handed him a hoodie. “Put this on. I hope it’s your size.”
Mrs. Thompson sent a sympathetic glare to the two. “I mean if my family was like theirs I am certain that I would have to act out in some way as well.”
“Tony you are a hot mess.”
“Would you rather have the chance of saying goodbye or rather regret never being able to have the chance to say goodbye,” the doctor questioned. “I would much rather Harley be the chance to say goodbye to his mother before she passes.”
“If you want more time with her, you don’t need to pretend that you’re okay with her leaving as soon as she is. It’ll hurt you in the long run.”
“Be good for me sweetheart and show me how beautifully you come apart,” Steve said, mouthing at Tony’s neck.
Steve looked down at him lovingly, wiping away a stray tear that had fallen from Tony’s eyes.
“Steve I am now going to need you to watch that show with me whenever I watch it. I need your commentary.”
“He was trying,” Tony offered.
Bucky felt his neck become damp as Steve continued crying to the point where his cries sounded like wheezing. If Bucky wasn’t certain that the serum had cured his asthma, Bucky would have been rushing Steve over to medical.
That was the only way Steve and the others had agreed to putting Tony in the room with Ryder alone. Tony had argued his case, saying Ryder was much more likely to say it was him, if he felt that it was only Tony. Add the others and you would just get defensive statements.
Isak, looked up at them and smiled softly. Beneath it was a desperation that Steve found unsettling.
“How long are you going to be in the lab?” Peter questioned his mouth already full with a bite of his sandwich. “Because I know you have no concept of time.”
He didn’t want to say how he tried getting someone to fix the hole, but Ryder had insisted it stay there as a reminder. Tony had forgotten what he had done to trigger that response, but he did remember how whatever it was Tony had stopped doing it without even questioning.
He saw Wanda looking more relaxed and calm than ever, while talking to Vision. He looked as Natasha and Bruce engaged in a conversation with shy smiles and bodies slightly worn with tension. He saw Sam and Rhodey comparing short and often amusing stories about their time in the military. He saw Thor attempting to steal dessert from the other tables, while Loki grinned mischievously his hand outreached and…wait…
“You think so?” Steve questioned.
“Yeah, yeah you’re right.”
Julie had kicked him in the neither regions and exclaimed that, “You’re the reason Mr. Tony hasn’t been here in like forever!”
“I’m always up to a challenge.”
“What? I object to this accusation,” Flash interrupted. “Do you see a person such as myself trying to pick on a freshman?”
“I still have access to the kill switch with Ryder, yes?”
Oh, so Tony had definitely won. He was so going to rub this in Clint’s face later on. He wondered to himself whether he could forever have his creation on display in the communal area of the tower with the word
Steve stopped breathing.
Miles leaned forward near Steve’s face, looked him in the face, and rolled his eyes as slowly as he could.
Pepper sent a text to Steve and walked into the lab. Rhodey was sitting dozed off in a chair and Pepper paused to flick him upside the ear. Startled, Rhodey surged away eyes blinking away any sleepiness.
“We all did,” Miles said, jumping into Tony’s arms. “Were you surprised baba? I kept it a secret for forever.”
“You want me to enter you slowly and fill you up to the point where you feel like you can’t breathe, but it’s the best feeling in the world. You want me to move inside you like water, brushing up against you. You want the warmth that I have left inside you to last you for days because you’ve felt cold since then.”
“Because Tony is a nice person. Do not know why it is so hard for you all to notice that,” Isa told him. “He’s been taking care of your family and keeping them out of the spotlight. I’m sure you would have known that if perhaps you gave your wife a call. But oh well guess exiles don’t really have access to a phone.”
“Yes?”
The music that had been playing softly all throughout the tower was now a little louder providing a nice background sound.
No one noticed.
The two found themselves passing Miles’ group. Peter, Michelle, and Ned were filtered in between the kids. Peter being in the back turned toward Tony who had just walked toward them.
Natasha nodded her head. “What else is new?”
Sam picked apart his at his palms. He wanted to check-in and make sure Tony was okay. But how could he be okay, right now? Sam resolved to find a way to help Tony in whatever way he could. He hadn’t really been there for him before, what with his role only being really to help Steve with Bucky, but he would change that.
He couldn’t call Steve and tell him when he comes this time he should stay…that they should all stay. It wouldn’t be fair to make them do something they don’t want. So it’s okay if they didn’t even come back here to him. He could make them a Tower separate from the one he had renovated. He had been optimistic when he started remodeling. But now…maybe they wanted a place where he wouldn’t be. He couldn’t make them stay with him.
“Of course,” Pepper said taking Miles and placing him on her hip. “Come on boys.”
Tony smiled slightly at the reddening of Steve’s neck as he turned around. He waited three seconds before following, all the while praying that this wouldn’t be amongst the last days that the team gathered together. And if everything went to plan everyone from the snap would be back.
Tony stopped short, eyes welling up. He felt his breath catch in his throat, remembering the exact moment all of his strength had left him.
“FRIDAY I do not appreciate your cheekiness,” Tony said briefly smiling at his AI’s personality. If there was one thing Tony was extremely proud of was his creations and their ability to have personality. “Alright Miles open up.”
A doctor came in, holding a clipboard in her hand.  Steve looked at Rhodey and Pepper, who had just come at the right time. Rhodey led Pepper to a chair, beside Bruce who had his head tilted back. Pepper sat down and the doctor took that as her time to finally begin speaking.
Once Tony had slumped back onto the bed and his breathing had calmed down, Steve pulled his fingers out of Tony.
“And there’s no other way?”
“Just to make sure I know when you’re gone,” Tony said as though he had to explain.
Natasha packed away a dinner for Tony and set it in the refrigerator. No one had wanted to wake Tony up because what Peter had said was true. He did need sleep. Clint followed Natasha up to her room and asked if they could have a sleepover. Natasha pushed him out of his chair. Bucky had left the living room a few minutes ago to mediate for the night. It was something that his therapist suggested and something that Bucky had been trying to do daily.
“It is,” Bucky agreed. “I just don’t agree why you’ve been talking all day about how romantic Steve is. Like hello…I’m fairly certain you’re not married to Steve.”
Tony laughed, a soft but genuine sound that Steve had always loved to hear and be the cause for.
Needless to say I hope all of your days are going better and that you enjoy this nice little chapter with no angst (Guys I really tried to give y'all an angst break here...whether I am successful or not meh).
Natasha tersely nodded. “Thanks for letting me know.”
“You know Mr. Stark I was thinking how does child services handle an alcoholic father. And you’re a new father right? I would certainly hate for someone to release the footage of the room’s cameras of you being drunk. Or perhaps I’ll send you home right now to get your son. I don’t imagine you’ll be a father much more, when they see your drunk self,” Miriam taunted.
“Miles slow down sweetheart. You’re still a little under the weather,” Tony said trailing quickly behind Miles. “Bambino.”
“There’s nothing in Ryder’s and Tony’s relationship that was healthy,” Steve told him.
“Do you want me to come with you?” Steve whispered.
Steve closed his eyes and walked near Bucky. He knew that Tony was asleep, but he didn’t want their voices to bring him out of it. After all that had been going on, Tony needed all the rest he could afford.
“I’m sorry that I said something was wrong with your voice,” Kevin apologized.
Tony mistook Steve’s flirtation for an honest question. “Honestly, some spaghetti. Where did it go? Please tell me that it’s not all gone.”
The two hugged and went back to their respective places. Marley let go of her noise and then let out an exaggerated breath.
Miriam was now straddling him, her skirt pooling over Tony’s stomach. She hummed a song in the back of her throat as she poured herself a drink. She tossed it back and Tony wanted to tear into the skin that took the liquid.
Isa easily handed it over to Natasha and succeeding in not glowing at the fact that she managed to get Natasha to sign. Of course she was more than positive it was mainly due to her closeness to Tony and her own understanding of the documents.
“Alright lover boy, let’s say you and your friend get a little more involved.”
“I was sold out for a lollipop,” he said leaning down.
“Please don’t,” Tony said.
Cali entered the Tower nearly running, pulling alongside a man who looked to be in his late sixties. His wide frantic eyes skimmed everyone before him. Steve noticed the missing fingers first and his heart pounded viciously in his chest. Wanda was immediately called forth and sent out to ease the man’s fears.
“Sure.”
“You’re awful. That poor nurse is going to say he was bullied by a national icon,” Tony sputtered, body shaking, but this time from poorly restrained laughter. “And what happened with the whole you don’t like bullies? I’m going to need this to be added to the plaque above below your picture in the museum.”
“Of course a team,” Steve slowly repeated.
Tony noticed this, but didn’t allow that to stop him.
Steve frowned at this and looked at Tony. “Do you think Howard may have been trying to actually put a wedge in your relationship?”
Steve would be very welcoming of Tony’s words and then he would steer him toward the right direction. He had a month to persuade Tony to get rid of the Accords. At least that is what Pepper had seemed to imply. He looked at the rest of his teammates and decided that for them he would be the one to help Tony see the downsides of the Accords. Sure there may have been changes made, but at the end of the day it was still a restriction on their powers. If only Tony could understand this…but he couldn’t because he was Tony Stark.
“I have no doubt that you have not changed at all. I see the same man today that I saw years ago. You may have everyone else fooled, but remember brother that I know you. I know that this is all a façade. You’ve seem to get into the good graces being some doctor and dating Tony. It was actually rather smart trying to clean up your image.”
His eyes blinked away bleary tears because…there had been a second where he thought Steve wasn’t going to make it. Hell, there was a moment where he thought he was reaching his own final seconds. Yet here he was. Here he was standing with all those he loved around him. It was nothing short of a miracle.
“Shuri,” Peter whined. “Why on earth would I want to do that?”
“I know, but you have to get up and get dressed. You can take a nap, when we get back home. But you don’t want to be late. Remember we’re seeing Peter at his school today. Or I guess we will just stay home and tell Peter we will see him later. I guess sleep does sound better.”
“Yeah. We especially were during our teenage years. Tony looked after me. I looked after him, even though he said that wasn’t my job. Then well his parents died and he had to become head of his dad’s company. I was an agent. I didn’t really have time to make home visits. I mean we still stayed in touch, but not so recently.”
Tony shrugged. “Yeah. But hey this all looks really good maybe we should dive in and-”
“Stark,” came Fury’s deep voice.
Tony begrudgingly followed Steve into the main room. He had just put Miles down for sleep and really wanted to go back to his lab. He had intended to go back to his lab and hide in there. Unfortunately, a certain super soldier wouldn’t let him do that.
Steve smirked and stepped even closer. Bucky backed away knowing that this was not going to end well for Ryder. Bucky was fully aware of what Steve could do. He wondered if Steve ever told his team about the time he left a guy paralyzed, after a fellow soldier had called Gabe Jones a derogatory term.
Tony still struggled to breathe and Natasha was growing desperate. “Please Tony I can’t help you, if you don’t breathe. Come on follow me.”
Not even seconds later, Steve’s phone buzzed with an incoming text. He frowned slightly, when his brain provided the fact that Tony never liked paying attention to his phone, while with company. It was actually the only time that someone could see Tony unattached to his phone, unless it was an emergency. Tony had told him it was the one good thing he took from his father. He may not have always been attentive to Tony as a child, but he was never rude enough to have his attention anywhere else beside the food in front of him.
Tony’s breaths puffed out and filled the silence of the room. Steve hummed in the back of his throat as he continued the repetitive motion of running his fingers through Tony’s hair. A few more minutes passed with Tony completely still.
The smirk on Miriam’s face didn’t seem to ease Tony’s worries. However, he couldn’t help the small slimmer of hope that he could wash away the stain that their hands left. Ryder left the room, locking it behind him.
Ryder slipped into the space between the half open door. “I love you. You love me. I’ll be back soon.”
Steve balled his fists in his hands. “I have apologized and I will continue seeking forgiveness. I will continue to show Tony that I care and love him…something that you clearly don’t.”
But that was all then. Steve had to try and not get too caught up in remembering how things were. He would have plenty of time to do that as he pretended to trick himself to falling asleep. He knew his dreams would now be a compilation of trains, icy water, Siberia, and Tony’s hand falling outside his grasp. He knew and accepted all of this.
Natasha shushed him and turned to fully face Tony. “Okay, so were we doing some work for SHIELD in Washington D.C. It was a pretty routine mission, nothing too extreme. But we had some down time. And I know sometimes agents like to portray themselves as using the downtime to catch up on some sleep or get a head of the game. Unfortunately, when you have a child as a partner you do not.”
And Tony had been in the dark from all of this. He hadn’t even wanted to know what had happened to the CMPNY or Ryder. He was just thankful he was out of there and that was it. He hadn’t really questioned where Ryder had gone off to.
“Thanks, umm thanks for coming to get me,” Tony said as though he was thanking someone for simply picking him up from the mall…like someone had went out of their way to find him.
Steve stepped closer to him and kept his hand on his chin. “And the quote was from Peggy. I never knew how much you knew Peggy, but then I found out to you she was your Aunt Peggy. You’d spend the weekends with her and she’d tell you everything. She gave you wisdom that you had never explored before.”
Isak shrugged. “I think it was. I mean Tony stayed with him for nearly a year. Ever think maybe he was just trying to save face, when you all rescued him. Maybe he didn’t want you all knowing that he likes to take it rough and be diminished to nothing. I mean maybe he just fabricated everything.”
“Oh, please that was merely a suggestion. Also I do not appreciate how you all added T’Challa to the group chat that day to stage an intervention. If all of your shoe games were on point then I would have no desire to state that,” Shuri defended.
“I may have never been involved in the physical aspects that Ryder often had my sister or other agents enforce, but I was his informant. Anything he wanted to know, I had everything made available to him. I gave him files on…children…sick children whose parents wouldn’t miss them when we would do experiments for our serum. I changed hospital records to make it seem like it wasn’t Ryder’s fault that his patients were dying.”
Tony stood up, pushing Steve away from Ryder. Steve stayed still for a moment, but stepped aside when Tony nudged him once more. Steve left room, only enough for Tony to be in Ryder’s line of vision, but not close enough for Ryder to be able to touch Tony.
There would be no time for second chances, not this go around. Strange’s warning had been burned into his memory and Peter’s body fading away plagued his nightmares. So no there couldn’t be a chance where Steve did not trust him.
Tony leaned away from Steve and Steve allowed him to put some distance between them. Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and knelt beside Miles.
He didn’t have to keep his thoughts of mindless celebrity gossip much longer. Harley went toward him and motioned for him to stand up. Steve walked to him.
“No, don’t call. He might…Ryder might punish me again. He hasn’t punished me lately, he’s always saving me from those punishments…but Steve I don’t get it he gets people to drown me and then comes with a towel. Steve I don’t like it here.”
Wanda and Vision were at each other’s side, communicating to one another softly. Wanda’s body had a faint red glow to it and Vision hadn’t seemed too concerned. In fact, he encouraged the thoughts that Wanda was sending out.
“Steve,” Natasha said warningly. “Without a tongue, he can’t confess.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter’s fork fell harshly to his plate and he blinked owlishly at Natasha. It was only then that Natasha realized her mistake as she watched the closed of expression transform Peter’s face, one that too hauntingly mirrored Tony’s own. He pushed his plate back and gathered himself away from the table.
Tony winced slightly at the applied pressure on his hip. “Yeah, I know.”
Clint let out a harsh laugh and rubbed his face.
Pepper nodded to herself and leaned back. “That’s fine. What’s one video in the midst of many I have of you two.”
How could he get out of this fucking useless body that was stifling him?
“Okay, Di stay where I can see you or where granny and granddaddy can see you okay. And don’t go toward the water. You both don’t have anyone with you, okay?”
A door opened. Hands rubbed the space between his shoulders. A light voice tried breaking through the screaming in Tony’s head.
“Cut the bull shit Steve. For once stop lying to yourself and to those around you. The Accords are not what you have a problem with. If you seriously have a problem with the Accords, I would be doubting your efficiency as our team leader.”
“You don’t need them as your family. Tony we’re your family. Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, Peter, your soon to be adopted kid. You don’t need this in your life,” Rhodey pleaded.
He scrunched up his face at Natasha’s worried glance. Natasha hooked her fingers around the back of his neck, meeting a patch. She smoothly took it off and watched Tony’s eyes blink to stay awake. Natasha did everything she could to make sure Tony wouldn’t fall asleep. Looking at the blood slowly trailing from his temple, he might have had a concussion.
Tony stood up, but before he could even turn around every one of his team, family, and friends came tumbling outside.
Steve looked down at his feet, before turning his gaze up to meet Tony’s. His eyes were heavy with the burden of a thousand weights. Fury could see the tension running all throughout his body, yet Steve remained a solid sign of strength. His shoulders were still straight and his gaze hadn’t wavered, since he started looking at Fury.
“Alright,” Tony said. “Thanks for today.”
“I’m sure you are. Look we’ll have a more private discussion about things later. I need to pack for my trip to Honduras. Clean this up and we’ll talk when I get back, before I leave to board my flight.”
“The most special,” Sophie said. “And we need Mr. Tony for it.”
“You won’t leave, after everything’s said?” Tony asked once more, knowing it wasn’t fair to make Steve promise this. He shouldn’t have to feel required to stay.
Tony looked up, an achingly brilliant smile delighting his features. His eyes softened as he took in Steve’s loving expression. Reaching his hand upward, he pulled Steve’s chin toward him and placed a gentle kiss on the side of his lips. He withdrew for a second, before resting his head on Steve’s chest.
“I’ll bring you coffee for as long as you let me even if I think that they’re terrible for you,” Steve said leaning closer to Tony’s space. “But you’ll have to add some fruit and vegetables.”
“Ummm riiiiight,” Ryder said wearily looking at all of them.
“So,” Steve dragged. “Wheelchair or being carried.”
And so Tony had put on a brave face and accepted what he would have to do to make the only person, he had left in his physical presence, to stay.
Sam rolled his eyes. “Silence.”
“Okay, I sent some of the pics to you,” Peter said. “Also Pepper just texted in the group text and she said she’s keeping Tony occupied and that you owe her so many new shoes, cause he’s already driving her up a wall.”
“Steve stand down,” Bucky whispered just light enough for only Steve to hear.
“You can say no,” Natasha explained.
“All this is helping to do is effectively treat your trauma and your responses to it. It is to help mediate the pain you feel and all of the emotions that are brought up in your day to day job. It is to make sure that your thoughts are clear.”
Leaving Tony like this was hard. He didn’t want to leave, especially with the warmth he was receiving. He felt like it was his anchor, grounding him. If there was no visit today, he would have been perfectly content to stay there with Tony all day. Alas that was not the case.
“No, are you out of your mind? There was nothing beautiful about our relationship. It was like a prison for me. I hated that I told myself to stay. I hated how I let you back in, forgiving you, thinking that
The lights dimmed and a clip began to play on the projector. The scenes were entirely captivating and Tony found himself reminiscing about how he found joy in science as a young child through observing the world.
Rhodey nodded. He went to the kitchen and began to call them. Meanwhile Natasha was pulling up something on her phone. Clint had grabbed an arrow from somewhere and was now twirling it between his fingers. Bucky was looking for mission commands. Bruce was trying to calm himself down from becoming the Hulk.
Steve scanned the room, but couldn’t find Tony anywhere. “Does anyone have eyes on Tony,” he said walking toward the others.
Tony languidly stretched his body, arms wrapping themselves around Miles. His bleary eyes settled warmly on Bucky. Ryder didn’t seem to miss this and placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
Steve stepped back from him. Inside he felt a pleased grin and hoped that outside reflected it. Though he knows he was probably looking like an overeager dog right now. However, he wasn’t afraid of letting Tony know how affected he was by him. He kept everything bottled up inside for so long and it didn’t do him any good.
