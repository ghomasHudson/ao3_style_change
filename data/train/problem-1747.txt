John stared at her, the full meaning of what she was saying sinking in slowly. “Christ. It was meant for you. The bomb, or whatever it was. And that means—“ he was on his feet without even realizing it. “Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson—“
Sherlock’s back arched and his head dropped back, mouth falling open. “They…they laugh. They make jokes about how much I want it, how desperate I must be for a real man, like them, not a silly English schoolboy. And I say I do want it. That I’ve never been with a man. That I want to see what it’s like.”
At the end of the month, another of Lady Fitz-Hugh-Curtis’ friends arrived with an upper-class crisis. Sherlock had turned down any number of missing spouses, pets, heirlooms, and offspring, but apparently a missing racehorse was unusual enough to catch his attention, so off they went to Dartmoor.
“Well, I don’t like him, gentleman or no,” Billy said with sudden vehemence. “He looks at me like he’s a cat, and I a mouse, and I don’t know yet he’s got his paw on my tail.”
“I hate you,” Sherlock said, sounding close to tears, and John reached out and smacked Circe’s flank and cried, “Go!”
“Oops, better get that, it’s mum,” she said, standing up and moving quickly toward the door to get out of earshot. She took a breath, making the shift back to Agra, and answered.
Sherlock was too weak to lift his own head from John’s shoulder, so John carefully fitted his fingers along his face to lift his chin. He brushed his lips tentatively across Sherlock’s and held still; when Sherlock did not immediately stop breathing and the heavens did not open to smite them with a bolt of lightning, he kissed him, slow and sweet. Sherlock kissed back until he had to break off to gasp for breath, at which point John continued to brush kisses over his nose and cheeks and forehead while Sherlock trembled and trembled.
“Say it again?”
Sherlock sensed the muscles of John’s buttocks flexing, building into a rhythm; instinctively, his own hips tightened to meet him, making the friction rise higher, harder. It was so much better, somehow, than when he’d touched himself. Pinned against the wall, John’s hips thrusting roughly against him, the gathering heat between his legs: he was no better than an animal, all higher functions subsumed in the need for John to keep rubbing against his cock. “Oh,” Sherlock gasped—the pleasure was surging, closer, closer, he was going to—“
“I do, don’t I?” Sherlock said happily, soothed by the compliment. “I can’t wait to get back.”
“Sherlock. What are you talking about? Calm
Collins nodded and John said, “Then we will help. Have you shovels? We need every alpha and strong beta to start digging a trench, there, between the village and the field. Keep the women filling buckets and have the children start soaking cloths in the river—sacks, shawls, whatever you have.” The river would be just past the grove of trees.
“Are you sure?” Abbott asked. “You’re missing the fete over at St. Bart’s.”
“Over tomorrow? No. Not of no earthly judge, not now. I’m not going to contest the charges. You have to know I’m dying; better to go quick and clean at the end of a rope than go on like this, and one less lie on my conscience that way.”
“—or a chemist. But if you ever decide you’d like to turn to the crime thing instead, look me up. We could use your brains on the force.”
Sherlock’s bed was empty. John got up, stretching, and peered out, but the first storey was deserted. He padded over to the window. An immaculately tended garden stretched down toward a small stream, willows clustered on its banks. A perfect summer day in the English countryside. Exactly what the NeoTories claimed to be preserving and, if Sherlock was right, there was almost no one left here to enjoy it.
Sherlock spent the time cross-checking everything he’d dug up on Regal Florist against the pictures of the employees Hobbes had brought back, but he unearthed nothing new. At least he would have a fresh supply of chocolate to fuel his labors now. Eventually he heard Hobbes letting herself in downstairs and then the sound of her humming as she trudged up the stairs. “Stop humming,” he said, irritably.
“Mirzayev is connected to everybody. He’s based in Samarkand—you remember the old Silk Road? Well, he’s the new Silk Road. He connects Asia and the Middle East, and from there Europe. Drugs, guns, you name it—everything goes through him.”
John took a deep breath. “I’m upset,” he said carefully, “because I care about you. A lot. Um, not just as a friend. What happened earlier was—“ Oh God, it broke his heart how Sherlock’s shoulders hunched then, obviously expecting the next words to be something like “a mistake”—“something I’ve wanted for a long time. Wanted a lot,” John finished defiantly. “I would have said something sooner, but I thought, you know, you were already taken.”
Since Trevor was perhaps the least talkative person Sherlock had ever met, he could certainly see the truth of that. “Do you want to run it through?” he asked. “I’m going to need at least three cups before I go back.” Sherlock was a chemist, not a physicist, but Trevor was gracious enough to give him a seat, and it would pass the time until he was ready to return.
“You know why.”
Sherlock looked ready to kick Mycroft in the teeth, and John though he might just let him. “Do you have a picture of this thing, or any information on the collector?” he asked instead.
John grinned, smearing lube over himself without even bothering to let it warm in his hand first. “You’ll tell me if I hurt you,” he said, mostly joking, as he lifted Sherlock’s thighs up and positioned himself.
John’s imagination immediately supplied a picture of a garter belt. With hairy male legs. This might be a highly arousing image for many people, but John had to admit it did nothing for him.
This was true. Sherlock was not sure why he could not let the case go, aside from the obvious fact that he couldn’t solve it and that in itself drove him crazy; the note, he supposed, the note that had fitted into his dream and that had not been found at any other crime scene. It set his spidey-sense tingling, as John had once said. (Sherlock had had to look this up. He liked it.) He was certainly not about to admit to Mycroft that he had a
John woke the next morning feeling half sick from shame and gin. He could hardly bear to even think of what he had done. He was a sodomite. He had committed a terrible sin, and he had liked it, even if the larger part of his mind hated himself now. Now that he was no longer half-drunk he knew with awful, burning shame that he had done wrong by Teddy, a boy who had clearly felt something for him beyond idle attraction.
“Very well,” she said. Her voice scratched over the words.
“No I won’t interfere, no I won’t leak anything to the press, and of course I’ll pass anything I find along to her. How long?”
Sherlock paused briefly at the end of the movement but then went straight into the third without comment. This time the music was dreamy and muted, with faint echoes of the melodies from the first two sections woven in, and John understood: the third movement mourned not just the loss of the idealist who had left for war, but the loss of the war itself.
They made their careful way around the city in an ever-widening orbit, sticking to the smallest possible roads until they were able to veer north. They left the closely packed housing estates behind, traveling through carefully preserved villages that gradually gave way to countryside. In spite of Sherlock’s efforts they hit two more checkpoints, both manned by soldiers. At the first, near Windsor, a spotty boy still in his teens took an agonizingly long time to compare their fake identification to a sheaf of names on a clipboard. By the time he finally waved them through, John’s back was damp with sweat.
“Hmmm?”
last night). Life was good!
“What have you got there, my Lord?” Young Tom asked. “Shall I help you with it?”
“What sorts of things?”
“Whatever happened to her anyway?” John asked, curious.
“Round him up, Elyer, you lot are going with Bekturganov.” Bekturganov was more or less Samirelliev’s second in command.
“I wrote most of it last weekend, actually,” Sherlock admitted. He had stayed up for three days, writing feverishly in one of the practice rooms until he’d fallen asleep in there with all the lights on very late Sunday night. “That’s why it’s a bit rough. I can polish it up a bit and take out the…extra parts.”
Becoming human was going to take a good deal more work.
“Ketamine,” Sherlock breathed. “Well well well.” He and Molly grinned at each other and he felt that bright fizzy sparkle again, the glorious high of making a connection and being proved right.
“So you’re saying, what, some sort of…shadow government? Government in exile? Some Bonnie Prince Charlie there to rally the…
John followed Sherlock as he picked his way carefully to the back right corner. There was a clear space, although it looked only big enough for one blanket to John’s eye, and was right next to a towering hulk of a man who appeared to have no interest in neighbors. As they drew closer John could see that he had actually claimed two blankets, and that he had two more rolled up behind his back and another across his legs. As they drew closer, the man glared at them so fiercely that John’s footsteps instinctively faltered, but Sherlock kept on. John saw that the man’s eyes were a hideous dark yellow.
John smiled, looking fractionally more relaxed, and said, “I thought I’d stick to tea tonight. Mind if I put the kettle on?”
“I texted you because I thought there was a high likelihood of an issue you would wish to investigate, not to invite you to brunch,” Sherlock snapped, but he crossed to his chair and perched on the very edge of the seat. Mycroft’s eyebrows rose, slowly. His eyes narrowed at Sherlock and then, for no reason John could fathom, flicked to John. Sherlock inexplicably colored, then leaned ostentatiously back in his chair.
The big man came out of the back of the house and strode toward them, followed by two teenaged boys. One was black, the other white-blonde. “Angus Crawford,” he said, grabbing John in a bear hug and shaking Sherlock’s hand. “And these are two o’ my lads, Nat and Eli. Have you got all your things?”
“But it tastes better when you make it for me.”
Sherlock smiled fully now. “And you say I’m the romantic one.”
an investigation. He’s completely in the dark.”
“Were you flirting with him?” he asked in a low, dangerous voice. He wasn’t really jealous. For one thing, if he ever thought Sherlock wanted someone else--someone more his station--he would of course do the honorable thing and withdraw; he knew Sherlock had no interest in Gruner, but they hadn’t really touched in days now, and they had both been so tense--
Sherlock opened his eyes and turned to look at John, but now it was John who was staring fixedly upwards.
“Sorry, I didn’t think you could hear me,” Roz said. She was in her running clothes and smelled of sweat: morning already, then. “Doing okay?”
Sherlock sighed and went to his wardrobe to consider what to wear. His clubbing days were long behind him, but he had no doubts about his ability to blend in. The nightclub, judging by its location and external décor, catered to a professional and largely gay crowd. It was no student dive; Daniel Pearson went there strictly for business. Whoever he met there would be a serious dealer, with Daniel merely providing access to the university market. Sherlock wondered if Daniel, a student of economics, fancied himself a franchisee. He pulled out dark jeans and his tightest black shirt. He didn’t need John for this. Everything would be fine.
Sherlock’s jaw clenched involuntarily. The address was perfectly correct, but almost no one used it except the most conservative Bondeds. Fitzwilliam was the Prime Minister’s bondmate and the epitome of the NeoTory ideal: vacuous, pretty, and bearer of multiple litters of weak-chinned purebreds. He was also French, a fact which irritated Sherlock more than all the rest put together. He could so easily have got out!
By the next day everyone in London knew that Moriarty had negotiated an alliance and trade agreement with Mexico-Centroamerica. The newspapers painted this as an enormous victory, ensuring that sugar and tobacco would once again flow freely into the British Empire and that the Republic of Texas would inevitably follow.
And, of course, he was
had a lovely smile, so then I couldn’t say it myself, but it didn’t matter because he didn’t wait for me to say anything anyway.”
Aronsen’s sharp dark eyes did not waver and Sherlock found himself thinking of foxes and minks, small soft things that looked like prey until they showed their teeth. “Joe said you were planning to do some research last night.”
Sherlock grinned savagely. Chris Poletti, he thought, let’s see what secrets you were hiding six years ago, shall we?
He ignored the soup and went back to work.
“You like it out in the country?” Hamza said.
“I beg your pardon for the liberty,” Sherlock said, dropping to one knee. “We have not been introduced. I am Sherlock Holmes, son of the late Earl of Sherrinford.”
Sherlock heard the sound of quick firm footfalls and turned just in time to see Captain Watson emerge from the side hallway. “Oh good, I’ve caught you. Cook was hoping for a quick word about the shopping before you go.”
Now that John had the weekends free and was staying at the abbey he decided to carry on taking the early Saturday train, as he had done the day Sherlock had left hospital. He and Sherlock argued about this at length.
Lestrade propped his feet on his desk. “Most people would just say ‘yes’,” he observed.
John smiled. “Okay then. That helps. I think I can listen to the rest of this now.”
“I know. It doesn’t make it okay. But it helps. I know. Listen, John, let’s keep in touch, all right?”
“That,” John said, stunned, “was amazing.”
“It’s your best friend’s advice. You deserve it.”
After everything else, remembering the fire itself turned out to be rather anticlimactic. Surprisingly, Sherlock recalled very little of the actual fire—he thought he had probably been fast asleep when Mycroft scooped him up—only that hazy impression of flight and of huddling in the damp grass whilst his parents and Mycroft engaged in an unprecedented and spectacular row:
“Get in,” Ricoletti said abruptly, opening the door.
“I really wish I’d known those,” he said a little ruefully. “Misspent youth. I didn’t discover
John waved this aside. “Go on, just tell me now. I want to see Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s already dry mouth turned to sawdust. All he really knew was what he had heard from the other guards, which was that the police were well paid not to bother them. The bit about the opium going to the station was a complete fiction, although it looked as though they had fallen for it; he could not name even a single member of the official police, let alone which might be on Mirzayev’s payroll. “I don’t know,” he whispered.
Sherlock let the thought sit in his brain for a moment and then reached to turn off the shower. He stared at his reflection in the mirror. One month clean! No matter how hard he tried to downplay it, he couldn’t suppress a bubbling sense of pride. He looked…okay. Still a little thin, ridiculously pale, nails a mess; but his eyes were clear and his spine was straight and last week’s fresh sores were nearly healed. John’s words brushed against his mind (
“Oh, that’s rough,” Mike said.
“Are you coming back after?”
While this was not unexpected, it was certainly unnerving. “Expect I won’t be staying long then,” John said, trying for a smile. “Ta very much.”
“The fetuses, obviously. Why else would he cut them out? As I was saying he clearly keeps them someplace, so I started searching and sure enough, Wane Ellis rented a unit here.” Sherlock tacked up the last page, a printout of the homepage of Houston U-Store-It (Se Habla Espanol, Amigos!). “Six and a half years ago.”
John smiled. Sherlock could see the corner of his mouth curve up, the skin around one eye crinkling. They were lying on the floor on either side of Sherlock’s door, whispering through the inch-high gap.
Up in his room he shucked his jeans as quickly as possible, freeing his aching erection, and put his gun away. He heard the front door click downstairs; Mrs. Hudson locking up, probably. They should let her know Moran was in custody. Tomorrow. John pulled off the rest of his clothes and then hesitated. Sherlock was clearly keen, but John didn’t want him to feel pressured, and he’d never been much of one for sleeping in the nude anyway. He pulled on his pajamas. As a last thought he picked up his phone and switched it to silent, thinking he could do without Owen calling to update them on anything Moran might say tonight.
“Budge up a bit,” John advised, scooting them both forward, “There—put your hand on the window—that’s it. Now you’re the one with a view, aren’t you?”
“Oh Christ,” John groaned, looking at the desolate countryside sweeping past him. “You
John knew without asking that no one had ever rubbed Sherlock’s feet before. Poor skinny little transport, your owner doesn’t take very good care of you, he thought fondly as he rubbed Sherlock’s high arches. He doesn’t even buy you woolly socks. John made a mental note to buy Sherlock some woolly socks of his own for Christmas, or better yet some of those sheepskin slippers, the kind with the fleece inside. Sherlock would adore those, he loved soft things. Too bad Christmas was so far off.
Sherlock, was that necessary?”
Sherlock broke off the kiss and rolled onto his back. John pushed himself up on an elbow to look down at him and Sherlock held his gaze, eyes grave and steady. His fingers went to the buttons on his shirt and slowly, very slowly, he began to unbutton them. There was nothing coy or coquettish in his face or his movements. He was not teasing, he was giving himself up to John’s eyes for the first time, a gift; John felt the weight of it, of Sherlock’s trust and love. “I love you,” he whispered.
“Who was that?”
He was asking permission, Sherlock understood. “Go ahead. Come on me,” he said encouragingly, realizing that he really wanted John to do it.
“Then I’ll take the smallest thing you have that comes with a hot shower,” Sherlock said, teeth chattering.
“Is that what we’re calling it now?” Sherlock asked. “If she’d half as much brains as breasts she wouldn’t need me at all.”
No sense worrying about that now. John reached into the drawer and pulled out a handful of lube packets, next to the tissues he’d cleverly added after last time, and opened them up. He heard Sherlock’s sharp intake of breath and felt his cock surge and dampen in John’s hand: God, he wanted this, he was practically gagging for it. When John put a slicked finger to his entrance Sherlock all but shoved backward in his eagerness.
For some reason John seemed to be finding this rather funny, although Sherlock could see him struggling to hide it. “So you went to a club, got drunk, and pulled a bloke without lifting a finger,” he said. “Why am I not more surprised? Then what happened?”
The king was incredulous.
was the one with the incredible blow job skills: he was shaking, moaning with every stroke of John’s fist, hands clutching frantically at his hair, the back of John’s head, his face. He came like that a minute later, one hand clenched in John’s hair and the other over his own mouth.
“We can’t take all that,” John protested.
The first few days were hell. Sherlock had never thought much about his body except when it made its needs inconveniently known; now it demanded all of his attention. This was a relief, since it kept him from thinking about anything else except
John realized that Simon had left that—probably deliberately—unclear. The changed nature of their relationship was known to all their friends by now, but this was the first time John had actually been called upon to out himself to a stranger. It was harder than he expected. “Partner,” he managed, and then a bit louder, “I’m his boyfriend. Yes.” Git, he thought to himself, that wasn’t so hard, now was it?
Sherlock was quiet. He could not argue that.
blueberries. Do you want the bottom of that?”
Sherlock stared into space a minute, eyes flicking back and forth, until he saw the picture in his mind where he had just seen mention of the University of Sussex: on the notice board in the music corridor.
“No, Commander, I have not. Not a word.”
“Ah, Mr. Holmes…”
“I can see that,” she said, which he assumed referred to the scabby sores on his arms. Maybe he really didn’t look good, at least with his sleeve rolled up. “But you seem a bit…stretched thin, you know? Held together with spit and baling wire.”
But Easter went off better than anticipated. His family was so genuinely happy he was doing better that no one wanted to rock the boat, and one of the capsules emptied into Mycroft’s evening whisky sent him off snoring even before their parents went to bed. Sherlock waited until their room went silent just to be safe, then slipped stealthily into Mycroft’s room, filched his laptop, and worked out his password in two tries. (Napoleon,
Sherlock was left rooted to the spot, listening to his retreating footsteps. John kissing him had been overwhelming, shattering; he’d been left with a longing so intense and beyond his comprehension he could not even look at it directly. This was different. The desire he felt now was highly specific and despicably simple: he wanted John’s hands on him again, not just on his hips but everywhere, on all the skin as yet unmarked by his fingerprints, on his--
it—and the penny dropped. Sherlock was not going to spend the rest of the night unwinding with his violin. He was going to burn off his massive post case adrenaline high having sex with Sebastian Moran. John had to fight down a spike of jealousy. God, what would it be like to have that restless energy in his bed, to be the focus of that white-hot intensity? It would be like staring into the sun.
“Sherlock Holmes,” he said quietly. “I was the detective you and your wife hired when your nanny was being stalked.” Brendan, that was his name. The last time Sherlock saw him had been in a sunny kitchen, sitting at the table while his wife made coffee, a sandy-haired man with smile lines around his eyes. Sherlock had been slightly bemused by the sight of Brendan’s bondbite. Most Londoners back then were unlikely even to marry, let alone actually go through a bonding. Brendan and his bondmate were…barristers? No, something in finance, they both worked in the City. “Brendan. What happened to Marjane?”
“Oh, Jesus Christ,” John said, clapping his hands over his ears. “Why on earth would you think Mycroft and I’d ever had a conversation to do with your sex fantasies? Or anything about sex at all? And why would you think Mycroft would even know—actually, you know what, don’t answer that.”
“I haven’t the faintest idea what you just said,” Mycroft said blankly.
Jessica screamed in pure, elemental fury, and it took all three of them to hold her back as she launched herself at Davy with her fingernails hooked into claws.
Sherlock nuzzled into his chest. “I love you. I love you.”
phone buzzed. She took it out of her pocket, looked at the unfamiliar number, and held it up to John. He nodded, mouth going down into a grim line. She answered.
“Cuh, aa, t,” John said again, looking at the paper. “Cat.”
“Tony Lindner—I’m a friend of a friend, I mean. I didn’t speak to him directly.” Anthony Lindner was the man who had first aroused Mr. Mahdavi’s suspicions by arranging to have his own yacht sunk. He was currently out of the country and difficult to reach, or so they hoped.
“Oh, quite a bit. He and Mr. Holmes go way back, did you know that? They went to school together.”
Sherlock dropped his trousers and stepped neatly away from them, and there underneath he was wearing long black tights that ended at his ankles. In the low light of the single lamp he was a vision: pale skin glowing against all that black clothing and hair, eyes wide and dark, long black-clad legs that went on and on and on. John wanted to gobble him up like a biscuit. Sherlock slid his right foot forward and curled his arm, and then abruptly he whirled around in a perfect pirouette, once, twice, and then back exactly as he had started, foot arched in front of him.
Well, that was...totally reasonable, of course it was, Pip was alone and grieving now and Sherlock was surely his friend, after all, they did work in the storerooms together. Although so did Ernie, John thought a little resentfully. But everyone had already started eating, and he could not be so churlish as to turf Pip out of his seat when he was already chewing his bread. He took a seat farther down the table, realizing after he did so that he had sat down next to Teddy.
“Very traditional of you.”
On the forty-seventh day after Sherlock had last been seen alive, John’s nurse stuck her head round his door and said in a worried voice, “Dr. Watson, there’s someone here from the government—“
John laughed a bit breathlessly. “And you thought I was a size queen.” He tugged Sherlock forward by the hips until they were touching. “Christ. I knew, I learnt in training, that pheromones had an effect but I didn’t
“Now I get the autopsy and labs reports from the police and after a decent interval of time tell them I think they should test for ketamine and gamma hydroxybutyrate. Thank you for that, by the way, I might not have thought of that one.”
“Last night…” This part was even harder. John hated even thinking about the terror he’d felt, waiting, and he
“They had nothing to do with this!”  Sherlock insisted.  “They were genuine gifts from my brother, Mycroft.”
Sherlock frowned and pulled his sheet back over himself.
“You don’t deserve to be treated like this.  No one does.” Molly asserted.
There was a knock at the door.
I leaned against the door and slid down to sit.  I could smell myself as a fresh wave of slick rolled down my thighs, accompanied by semen.  It was a fresh reminder that John sacrificed his own sensibilities to save my life, not because he wanted to but because he had to.  Instinct made me rub my scent against the floor.  I got up on my hands and knees and returned to the bed, leaving a trail of slick on the floor.  It was an open invitation for an Alpha to claim me… Breed me… Make me their own.  At that moment I could take any Alpha that walked through my front door.  It just happened to be John.
“Careful, Lord John.”  Sherlock chuckled.  “Now come closer so I can talk to you without half the room listening.”
“How can love be forbidden?”
When John returned home from his job as a locum doctor he found Sherlock sprawled on the couch wearing only a sheet.  The heat had been turned up and there was a fire in the fireplace making the flat warm.  “Hello.”
John lightly touched when Sherlock had kissed.  “That’s it?  I was expecting a tingle or something.”
“This is a castle.  Let’s go find the gardens, my lord.”  And with that she dragged him out of the room and down the hall.  “This is our home now.  We should get to know it.”
“I promise.”
I shrugged and resumed staring across the room.
Sherlock took John’s hand and led him to the back corner of the garden.  Under a tree there were cigarette butts littering the ground.  Walls came together in the corner of the garden to create a sheltered place.
“I sat on your lap.” Sherlock pointed out.
“There is something you need to know about John.”  Mycroft murmured, glancing at where the doctor stood, talking to Greg.
“You are mistaken, Lestrade.  She is the daughter of Morstan.  Morstan raised her and loved her.  Parentage is not always about blood.”
Sherlock used his clean hand to wipe his mouth.
“Taste me?”  John raised an eyebrow.
John blinked up at the drapery above his head.  “You were there?”
“You… Like Sherlock?”
The crowd of lords stared in shock at the vase while ladies swooned.
“Why would I care?  Maybe because I’m your friend?”
“I’m… At war.”  John breathed, staring up at the other man’s impossibly cool eyes.  “There’s no time…”  His words were cut off when Sherlock kissed him.  It lasted only a moment before John regained his senses and pushed the other man away.  “No!  I don’t need this.”
“Bed chamber?”
“I was thinking the friend could be for both of us.”  John explained.  “Now will you come to bed with me?”
Sherlock made it to the battle just as Moriarty managed to free his arm and slither away.  The faun stared at the werewolf in surprise.  “Who is that?”
“You’re my first.” Sherlock murmured as he gave an experimental roll of his hips.  “No one else has come this far.”  His hands took John’s wrists, holding them down on the pillow as his hips slowly started to grind.
“Sherlock…” John rested a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “You are cold.  Come to bed.”
“Irene is here…”
“Speaking of… Where is he?”
“You have needs…”
“Such strong words from a naked man,” Mycroft mused airily.
“You’re pretty confident about that.”
John got out and stood behind a clearly frustrated consulting detective.  “A man, then.  You can marry a man.”
Sherlock scowled and blushed at Mycroft’s words.
John gaped up at the other lord, eyes wide.  “Sherlock?”
John peeled off his vest and tossed it aside.  “What will you do with me?”
“I’m so sorry, my lord.”  Mary answered.  “Morstan raised me as his own.”
“Jim.” Sherlock’s voice answered.
“Always.” John replied.
Sherlock made a needy sound and pressed himself into John’s space.  “Take me to bed.”
Sherlock stood up and held out his hand.  John took it and was pulled up off the couch.  The detective led him into the bedroom and released his hand to go to the chest of drawers.  Quickly he pulled out pajamas and dropped them on the bed before beginning the process of undressing.
“And who has the power to take him out should he depose the king?”
“I still don’t have any place on my person to hide a knife!”  Sherlock responded and opened John’s door to step out.  And with that Sherlock was gone with Lestrade.
“I’m not straight either.  I’m open to anyone.”
“Listen, Sherlock… I know you’re in heat and it’s difficult for you right now…”
“Been poking into the warg database?”
Lord John shook his head and retired within.
“You don’t count.”
“This isn’t right, Sherlock!  He can’t do that.  You’re the king.”  John snarled at him as they walked, careful to keep his voice low so no one could overhear.  “I’ll kill him.  Give me a sword and I’ll take that smug head off his shoulders and present it to you on a pike.”
“I’m… Honored.”  John managed, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath so he wouldn’t cum too quickly.  Lips kissed him and he kissed back.  Too soon they were probing tongues and clashing teeth as Sherlock continued to roll and grind.  “Fuck…” John gasped when he was finally allowed to breathe.  Sherlock was very much in control.  “Let me touch you.”  His wrists were caught in Sherlock’s grasp.
“H-how did you know about that?” John asked, confused.  He thought their sleeping arrangement was unknown to everyone.
John crawled to the faucet and twisted the tap.  Experimentally he sniffed, and tasted it before spitting it out.  “It’s water.”
“That’s what werewolves do… we find our target based on smell.”
“I do not…” John began.
“Me?  I was… um… masturbating.”
A few minutes later there was a video sent to Sherlock and he opened it, careful to keep the sound low.  On screen there was a group of about ten men, writhing together in sync.  The camera panned the group before focusing on a man who was balls deep in a woman.  The man was John… younger, but definitely John.  Behind John another male very obviously had his cock up John’s arse and they all writhed together in time with the rest of the group.  One male gave a cry which caused the tempo of the movement to speed up and all the males in the room raised their heads and began to howl as they obviously climaxed.  Melting together onto the floor in a pile of bodies several women picked themselves up off the floor, climbing out from under the males that had been fucking them.  “Dr. Sawyer?” the camera woman greeted the woman that had been under John.
And I just got home from Scotland so William Wallace has been on my mind.
“Gods… You have sass.”
John managed to roll us over and sat on top of my thighs to grind himself against me.  “Look at you!”
John made a face and stole one of Sherlock’s dumplings, stuffing it into his mouth with mirthful glee and a waggle of his eyebrows.
“He’s naked.  You could bugger him.”
The man gaped at his lord.  “My lord?”
I looked at her as she sat in John’s chair, regarding me.  “I’m fine.”
“That sounds like an excellent idea.”
Ok, guys... Season 4 gave me very little to work with before turning into a Scooby Doo episode ("Jinkies!  It was old lady Holmes the whole time!").  I really have no idea where to go with this, thanks to Season 4.  I'll just put this here and then hammer out a fix-it ending that DOESN'T involve John beating the crap out of a suicidal Sherlock.  Happy thoughts!  We're almost done.  Just this bit of angst.  It was so hard to write... But I needed to get something down.
“Can we go back to bed?” John asked as he took Sherlock’s hand and led him back towards the hut.  “That’s enough excitement for one night.”
When John regained consciousness he told us that the person he thought was his psychiatrist was actually someone claiming to be my sister, Eurus.  This brought Mycroft, John and I to Sherrinford where we played her sick game.  It was there I found out that my whole life had been a lie.
“Then maybe I should move back in.  In the meantime perhaps you would like to stay with me at my place?  We can clean up over here.  It might be a little cramped… But there’s room for you if you want it.”
“I love you.”  I almost didn’t hear his admission because his lips were pressed against my own.  Too soon the blood was rushing to my head and I couldn’t hear over the sound of my own breathing.  Slowly the world returned to normal and I felt John still grinding in a desperate motion.  In two thrusts he finally collapsed and I was aware of the combined wet on our stomachs.
Sherlock sucked on two fingers for a moment before pushing them into John’s tight heat.
There was a hint of a smile on Sherlock’s lips… Merely a pull of the lips before he set them firm again.  “Shush!” Sherlock admonished, climbing on top of John’s sprawled body.  “Or I really will use my sword.”
John regarded me critically.  “Do you want to be bitten?”
Watson finally stood up and stepped away from the bed.  “Goodnight, Holmes.  Pleasant dreams.”
But it didn’t happen.  The crowd exploded in wild applause and surged around John, dragging him off with them out into the forest.
Sherlock whimpered softly, clutching at John as his hips picked up speed.  “You feel good.”
“She is the closest I will ever have to a child.” Sherlock answered.
I shook my head again.  “He bit me.”
Sherlock grinned and lightly kissed John’s cheek.  “Where would I hide my weapon?”  Throwing his leg over John’s thighs he pushed his erection against John’s knee.  “Oh… There it is.”
“I want you.”
“Holmes, this is a medical procedure.  I take no pleasure from it.  This is purely for your benefit, not mine.”  Watson stated rather crossly.
“We slept together… ate together… worked together… brought down targets assigned to us… every day of my bloody life they were there… and now they are all gone.  I’m alone.  We’re not meant to be alone.  They set me free to find another pack… their packs won’t accept a fringe werewolf.  Maybe the feral ones will let me join… if I can find them.  If they accept my human blood…”  As he spoke John clutched Sherlock’s knee and massaged his calf muscle.
John watched him until the last of his long body was completely gone, leaving only a grass trail to show he’d been there.  Finally he turned his attention to Sherlock.  “Are you ok?”
The king stepped back and looked away.  “I’ve come to realize that I forced this upon you and I regret that.”  With a heavy sigh he returned to his desk and sat down on the chair.  “You and your wife may go.”
John regarded me critically.  “Do you want to be bitten?”
“John?”
“You’ve been playing with your ring.  I thought… Perhaps… You told me once that you needed it.  You need intimacy and closeness.  It makes us human.  If we went together I could keep an eye on you and make sure you didn’t go home with anyone too dangerous.”
“I just got her to sleep.” Sherlock whispered.
A fresh wave of slick filled the room with the pungent aroma of Omega in heat.  “Do we have to talk about that right now?”
John slapped at Sherlock’s arm.  “You cock…”
“Do you want more children?” Sherlock asked.
“Maybe his human mate removed it.”
“Well…”  John leaned into the neck and sniffed.  “Warg.”
John did not answer, rolling Sherlock onto his back and slowly kissing down his body.
Sherlock used his torch to illuminate the forest floor, unsure which way to go.
John’s eyes went wide and he looked between the two of us.  “I don’t remember… I remember hitting him but it was like someone else was doing it.  I don’t recall anything about being alone together…”
--TBC
“Since you?”
“No!” John burst out.  His agitation was confusing.  “No lube!  Nothing to prepare you!  What am I supposed to do?”  As he railed, he gesticulated.  Sherlock caught John’s right hand.  “What are you doing?” John asked.
My mobile buzzed and I looked at it.  It was a text from John.
Lestrade hesitated a moment, opening his mouth as if to speak.  But then he closed it and followed Lord Sherlock out the door.
Something in the shadows growled back.
“Yes.” Rosie spoke with some authority as she took a bite of her eggs.
“I still don’t…”
“Which one was that?” John asked quietly.
Sherlock orgasmed first.  His legs attempted to wrap themselves around John’s head as he ejaculated.  A low moan escaped him as his fingers paused and then probed deeper in thrusts simulating fucking.
“What’s wrong?  Why are you so out of breath?”
“She made me choose between Mycroft and… And… Who to kill.”
“Oh.”
“I cannot.  You are my king…” John’s words faltered at the end, allowing the betrayal he felt to color his words.
“John?  Are you alright, dear?”  Mrs. Hudson asked as John passed her door once again after she lost count.
“John?”  Sherlock queried his sleeping companion.
John turned around and around, staring up at the buildings.  “It’s… so big!”
Inside the club there was a sound of monitor feedback and the patrons became restless.
“Copy that.  Watson out.”  And with that he set his walkie aside.
I shut the door and locked it for good measure.  “I find I cannot wait for dinner.”
John sat down on the bed, not caring what sort of mess he would leave on the sheet bellow him.  “I’m attached to you.  Whether or not you feel the same is up to you.  But for as long as we have this… I’m yours.  I’ll say it.  I care about you.  I worry about you when we’re on dangerous cases.  I like having sex with you.  I’m yours.  I’d like to think you’re mine.  You have needs.  I hope I’m filling them.”  Getting up, he headed towards the bathroom.  “We should probably change the sheets.”
“Ok.”  Rosie responded, taking a bite of cereal.
“So far?”  Lestrade breathed.
“You are my king.  I will do anything in my power to protect you.  I am a soldier.”
Sherlock bit his lips.
“Sherlock… That happened.  We talked about being broken and then you fell asleep.  I let you sleep.”
“Finally!”  Sherlock pulled away from John and went to the door.
“Flesh-eating beetles… Do keep up, John.”
“What are you doing?!” And yet John made no effort to pull his hand away.  A soft groan escaped him as his penis gave a twitch of interest.
I blinked at him in shock.
I couldn’t tell her it was because of Mary’s death.  I was no longer someone John cared about.  I was only physical release he desperately needed.  Whether that was sexual or aggressive release, it didn’t really matter.  It was the only way I was of any use to him anymore.  I would do anything for him.
“Don’t listen to him.” John smiled at Greg.  “So… What do you think?”
“Listen, Sherlock… I know you’re in heat and it’s difficult for you right now…”
It was something that made him feel ill sitting in his chambers, waiting for his John to impregnate his new bride, Mary.  What if she managed to get him to fall in love with her?
Sherlock moaned and squirmed out of the chair, facing it he rested his body on the seat and pushed down his trousers.  “Please?”
I scrambled back towards the bed, kneeling on the floor.  John stood before me with only his vest on.  I reached for him, pulling him into my space.  I nuzzled between his legs, finding his penis to be half erect as my mouth took him.  I could swallow him all the way down.  Vaguely I was aware of him cursing above me, his hands scrambled to clutch at my head or the bed behind me.
John rolled over onto his side, staring into the darkness of the unfamiliar room.  The bed was far more comfortable than any of his own.  The mattress was soft.  And in that instant he remembered the look on Sherlock’s face when they had sex.  Would he look the same way when he took Mary?  Would she see the lust in his eyes or hear the whispered words of devotion?  Would it be too dark to see?  What was it like to be a woman and to feel a man’s cock enter her?  Would he excite her first so she was wet?  And then tomorrow night would she be disappointed that John’s length and girth weren’t the same?
“No… I just come here for their woods.”
“Thank you, Watson.” Sherlock answered and lowered his body on the bed.
The words were harsh and I sat on the bed, watching him pick up the foil package with some apprehension.  John didn’t want me.  Maybe there had been a time he was open to the idea of having an Omega, but I ruined it when I jumped.  A part of him was broken and lost forever when I returned.  And he married Mary to prove it.  Now she was dead and all that was left was broken.
I lost my grip on my bow, the violin making a guttural squeal of protest.  Not trusting my fingers, I lowered by right hand.  “Oh?”  My eloquence was lost.  Perhaps she meant she had conversed with John.
“You would use sentiment against me.”  Watson answered.  “This is not the arrangement we made back when I offered to treat your hysteria.  I can understand your desire to touch.  I acknowledge your need to not be alone while you take relief.  But sentiment goes too far.”
“You will take my scent and the entire world will know that you have been bred by me.”
And with the whirlwind of the case it seemed for a time they forgot what happened that evening.
But John made no move to get up or clean himself.  We lay with him resting a leg on my thighs.  “What brought this on?”
Mycroft made a face.  “You’re not serious…”
“These things take time, m’lord.  But I believe his highness will be pleased if you take a wife to father an heir.  She is a worthy match for you.”
Sherlock combed his fingers through John’s hair.  “I want you to fuck me.”
“Why?  Because I’m your mother?”  Irene challenged.
“Is there anything I can say to make you believe that I love you and I don’t want to leave?”  John asked.
Sherlock nodded and was instantly unprepared for John to press his nose into his crotch.  “Um…”
“You want a friend… Not me.”  Sherlock whimpered.
“Strictly for masturbation purposes.”
“You can’t do it, John.”
“She has been found by one of her enemies.  I’m sorry, John.”
John kissed his forehead and held him tight.  There would be time to figure out last names later.
“No.  Just proving a point.”
“Say something.”
“Why?  Because you’re my king?  King William?”  John took Sherlock’s hand and kissed it.  “What do you want, Lord Sherlock?”
John’s fingers traced the spine all the way down to the small of the detective’s back.  His body scooted back to straddle the brunette’s thighs as he followed one scar into the waistband of Sherlock’s sweats.  It wasn’t entirely erotic to touch Sherlock in this way… And yet he was still excited from the near kisses on the couch.  Leaning forward, he kissed Sherlock’s spine.
Sherlock stared at him for a long moment before glancing at the crowd.  “Well?  Is someone going to clean that up or will I have to do it?”
“Hello!”  Her greeting is especially bright and cheerful.  It grates on my nerves.  “Tea?”
John bowed his head, staring down at Sherlock’s body.  Already he was hard even though by rights he should be drained from the spasms only a few minutes before.
John made a face and pushed down his pants to reveal his impressive erection.  Regardless of his state of mind, his body reacted to my scent.  “No, of course not.”
Sherlock gave a soft sigh and wrapped his arm around John’s waist.  Long fingers drew lazy patterns along John’s spine from his waist to his scapula and back down again.
The cab stopped and the cabbie alerted them that their reached their destination.
“Can I turn on the light and get a better look at them?”
“Goodnight.”  Sherlock kissed John’s cheek and settled in for sleep.
His name was Greg Lestrade and he was a police officer.  The grey haired man in Sherlock and John’s clearing, looking around with his mouth open in awe.  “This place is… Wow.”
John knelt down above her, allowing her to pull off his tunic and push down his trousers.  Her hand caught his wrist and she directed his hand to her warm, wet folds.  “Gods…” John breathed, pushing his fingers into her.  His thumb flicked at her jewel, causing her to squirm.
“You wish to leave.”  King William’s tone was soft and yet harsh.
“Keep your eyes shut!  What do you want, Moriarty?”
Lord John followed King William into the court, pleased at the way lords and ladies scrambled to get out of their king’s way lest they be punished.
Sherlock made a frustrated sound and ran his fingers through his hair.  “This is what I was afraid of!  Someone like Jim Moriarty was going to find out about you and hurt you.  This is why I didn’t want to become attached.”
Watson entered the room, keeping his eyes on the floor.  “I am sorry, Holmes.  I did not mean to snap at you like that.  Your hysteria has gotten worse, has it not?”
“Very well.  I will be in after your bath.” Watson replied as he returned to his newspaper.
“Lay down the dagger.”  King William commanded.
“That’s what humans do.”
John picked up Rosie and set her on his lap.  “Did you hear that, Rosie?  You might have a little brother or sister.”
“I would love to.” John answered.
“Sherlock hasn’t been broken into his new life of servitude.  I brought him because he’s pretty to look at… But he’s stubborn and doesn’t take instructions.  With a dedicated master he can be tamed.  Please accept them all as gifts.”
“You made him beg four times…” Irene sounded more than a little awed.
“I don’t know what else to do, John.  My body is…” Vaguely he indicated his erection.
When Sherlock came to he was aware that time had passed without him.  John sat beside him on the bed, looking at him with some concern.  John had washed up.  The hand he had used was clean and smelled faintly of soap.  Sherlock could smell it as John pushed the curls from his forehead.
John removed his pants and got into bed.
The man got up from the ground and pulled his coat back on.  “I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
Sherlock frowned and shook his head.  “Many terrible things… And it’s what he has planned for you.  It is no coincidence that my brother sent you a body guard.  Molly will also serve you well.  She is a bright girl and needs the protection of a strong lord.  Make use of them and they will prove their loyalty.”
“Yeah?  But I can’t think of any way this will be pleasant for you.”
“Not really.”
John fought off the urge to wrap his arms around her.  “If you’re a mermaid where is your fish tail?”
“Out!”
John looked up, making eye contact before removing his hand so he could swallow me all the way down to the root.
John stared dully at the empty room where he and his wife once inhabited.  “What am I to do?”
Ever write something and then lose track of what you were thinking when you started?  What were they arguing about?  Why did I write that?  Where was I going with this?  (scratches head)  I think I got it figured out.
“No.” I answered from my chair.
“Molly hasn’t yet been bred.  But if her mother and sisters are any indication, she will be fertile.  She hasn’t yet been deflowered.”  The man smirked and stepped behind the second man to tap him.
“I am loyal.”  John answered and reached down to take Sherlock’s hand.
“I don’t understand why you are so intent on bedding me.  I can give you aid in your search.  My men are at your disposal.  You can dress as the lord you were born to be.  Why do you tease me so relentlessly?  Is it for a game?”
“I should have told you.” I reasoned.
“Are you surprised?”  Sherlock asked.
“How?”  John demanded, glaring up at Sherlock.
Watson shut his eyes and turned his head away from Sherlock as if he anticipated what the detective wanted to do to him.
“Yes, of course I’ll hunt with you.” John answered with a smirk.
“After your bath will you be requiring assistance?”
“Mm… John…” Sherlock moaned, pushing his bottom up.
John frowned at me as his daughter squirmed in his arms.  “That’s not true.”
“John?” Sherlock sat up, looking at his boyfriend in concern.
Two nights passed without Watson entering Sherlock’s bedroom.  Both nights Sherlock found it difficult to fall asleep.  A variety of positions were tried along with sleeping in the nude.  The chill of the room on his skin did nothing to ease him into sleep.  During the day he was irritable and cross with everyone and everything.
“This is a bloody crime scene.”  Lestrade announced.
“You mean a pixie?  They can fly and change size.  Their Glamour is to have wings and glow.”
“Well… Thank you.”  John smiled back, feeling the heat from where the faun touched him travel up his leg.  The sensation seemed to migrate through his body, making him feel completely warm and relaxed at the faun’s touch even though by rights he should be terrified.  Instead he felt really good… Almost intoxicated.
“It’s really something, isn’t it?” John asked from where he stood, trying to cover his genitals with his hands.  With other Fae it hadn’t really mattered before.  Everyone was naked under their Glamour.  That was just a fact of existence.  It was strange to have a mortal look at him with outside eyes.
I rolled my eyes.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  In truth I knew exactly whom she was talking about.
John wasn’t wearing a shirt.  A further look and he realized that John was completely naked.  “What do you want?”
Sherlock didn’t answer.  Instead he grabbed a flower from John’s garland and crushed it in his hands.
“You don’t want to bed me?”  A look of confusion settled on Sherlock’s face.
The next day was spent with Sherlock trying to ignore Greg as much as possible.  John talked to Greg as if they were old friends.  Sherlock found that annoying.
“Then warm me up.”
“We won’t let that happen.”  Sherlock stood and smoothed down his meager loincloth.
And they were on their way back to London.
There was always a celebration in the Holmes manor when one of their indentured servants was able to pay back their debts and be granted freedom.  Sherlock wondered what John’s celebration had been like.
“No one ever agrees to let me fuck them.  Ahh!”
John settled himself on Sherlock’s legs, face in his king’s crotch.  “Where is that naughty lord posing as a bed slave who had his way with me over and over again?”  Lightly he licked Sherlock’s cock.
“Don’t be ambiguous.”
I watched him undress down to his pants.  “Did you bite me?”
“It’s NOT a trick!”  Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “I deduce!  I notice little details that the rest of you take for granted or ignore.”
“What do you care?”  Sherlock snarled back, his patience gone.
“What are you doing, Sherlock?” Jim asked.
“You have me.”
Sherlock found a fleshy part and bit down.
“No.”  Sherlock smiled.
John grunted again and rolled over, facing away from Sherlock.  “’S the middle of the night.”
“For weddings the groom is given the clinging ivy and the bride is given the flowers.  On their wedding night the flowers are used to remove the clinging ivy.  But that didn’t happen for us because they abducted you.  And if it isn’t removed it will start to squeeze.”
“Will you listen to me?” John demanded.  “I am an Alpha and I am telling you that you are not an Undesirable.”
“Mostly I was thinking about sleep.  My bed is far more comfortable than your bed or the couch.”
“I’m good.”  John raised his glass.
“Humor me.”  Sherlock demanded.
Suddenly John ejaculated and I swallowed it all, proud of myself for managing it.
“My king…” John replied, holding him tightly.  “Will you help me raise my daughter?”
“It is up to you.” I repeated myself.
John obeyed, climbing onto the bed even though his knees were sore from kneeling on the hearth.  “What do you want, your highness?”
John followed him.  The world around them changed.  John pulled away from the kiss and noticed that they were surrounded by a mist as if they were in a fog. “Where are we?”
“Then we better go.”  John pulled on his own mask, blue with white dots.  Rosie’s luggage was a priority, but both men also carried an overnight bag.
“Stay.”  I answered.
“Someone who wants me.”
The detective kissed him deeply.  “You.”
Sherlock pulled away with a final bite to John’s left buttock before he sat up and scooted forward to push himself into the space he had created.
“They do have names, don’t they?  Most people do.  We can’t go around calling each other ‘you,’ can we?”
John waited until he heard Mycroft leave the building before turning back to Sherlock and nuzzling his reddened cheeks.  Handing Sherlock the disc he continued to nuzzle, pushing the human back towards the couch.  “You’re upset.  I can smell your anxiety.”
John took a step back.  “No… I… No… I didn’t realize it had been nine days.  You told me to stay until I got her pregnant.  I didn’t know you meant seven days exactly.  If I had known I would have kept better track of the days.”
“Thank you for that.” John breathed.
There was a knock at the door and then Lestrade looked in without waiting for an invitation to enter.  “We have him, your highness!  I mean… m’lord.  I’m sorry.”  Looking contrite, the guard withdrew.
Sherlock gave another sob that sounded like a laugh and shook his head, wiping the tears away with the back of his hand.  “Ask me again… Properly.”
“Did he tell you?” Eurus cocked her head to the side, eyes wide in feigned innocence.
“What are you, John Watson?” Mycroft asked.
Sherlock had always been a freeborn.  As a child he had been raised by house slaves his parents had hired to do the menial tasks like cook, clean and raise the children.  One of his more traumatic childhood memories had been when his nanny had paid off her debt and left the household.  No matter how it was explained to the young Sherlock that this was the way of the world and that his nanny would be very happy now that she could have a home and family of her own, Sherlock felt abandoned and betrayed.  When the next nanny was bought Sherlock refused to show any sort of affection, knowing that nanny too would soon buy her freedom and leave.
Something had changed from the last time Sherlock had been to 1895.  Watson seemed to think Sherlock was suffering from hysteria.
Sherlock pointed an accusatory finger at John.  “My lord doesn’t know his place.  Strip him and place him in my bed chamber.”
Sherlock nodded and blushed.
“Um… Mary.  She’s a mermaid I met.”
“Better.”
“That’s John Watson.”  Molly smiled.
“You two are back early.” Molly stated.  “I expected you two to go out afterwards.”
“Then you must live on… For me.”  Sherlock’s fingertips lightly slid down John’s sides, causing him to twitch.  A fond smile crossed his lips.  “John… You must.  I order it.  If something happens to me you must take Mary and the child and go.  You must live… For me.  No heroics.  I would have you live to be very old.”
“Go to our room.”  I reiterated, and watched as he made his way to the bedroom.
John blinked at the question.  “What?”
Sherlock frowned at his mobile and looked through the files again, returning to a video of a happy John holding the cub named Ian.  Something within the detective crumbled and hurt.
“It is what it is…” I murmured, looking down at the child on my lap.  “Are you going to text Mycroft next?”
“It’s too early for bed.” John remarked from his corner of the couch, unsure what to make of Sherlock’s inability to give a proper answer.
I wanted John to myself.  Perhaps I’m selfish like that.  “I was planning on having sex with you when we returned home.”
“How much?” Sherlock managed, lightheaded.
That would be a no, then. At the restaurant, John had just gathered up his bag and iced coffees when his text alert chirped. John transferred everything to his right hand, precariously, and pulled out his phone to check the text, which turned out to be from Dimmock. John had just read
“Wouldn’t know about that, sir, I’m just the driver.”
“Mmm?”
There were also a fair number of private cases, which became more frequent as Sherlock’s renown increased. John’s favorite involved an opera singer with a jealous rival because of the sheer drama involved, although he got a little sick of their client, who kept hanging around even after the case had been wrapped up.
Macey looked up, frowning. “Really? Let me see.” Sherlock bared his teeth and Macey said, “Right, don’t smile.”
Sherlock’s recovery was long and unpleasant. It was days before he could finish a sentence or sit up unsupported, and his weakness made him miserable and fractious. After several days he spiraled from irritability into depression, a bleak listless silence that reminded John far too much of the journey north.
“James Moriarty was an IRA gunman. Went to prison in the seventies and left a pregnant girlfriend named Mabel Allen. Three guesses as to the baby’s name. We know this because the Royal Ulster Constabulary kept tabs on Mabel for a while, figuring her for an IRA sympathizer, but she took up with another bloke and they dropped her after that.”
“We’ll need the farrier out soon anyway—Leviathan’s got a shoe loose now,” said Davy, and Gregson groaned.
“Sherlock.”
“Okay. I’ll just have a quick wash, then, and you can have the bathroom.”
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said in his hoarse voice, looking at his drawn-up knees. “I won’t do that again.”
“John,” the man said warmly, standing.
John looked from her to the open doorway, where he could now hear Ryan talking to someone—Rodriguez, from the sound of it. Then the weird, unsettling quiet was abruptly broken by the sound of Sherlock shouting. “Five!
Augustbird's
John looked at him, puzzled. “Because your whole face does this
Sherlock barely touched his food, while John ate too much, too fast, and felt sick. Still, Sherlock seemed outwardly calm; he was actually less jumpy than the first time John had had tea with him at Lucy’s, possibly because the baseline noise level was so high that crashing and shouting barely registered. John got Sherlock talking about his music, which always helped to distract him. He had temporarily abandoned his Easter piece to work on a new commission, a hymn to St. Cecilia for an women’s ensemble.
John lowered his own mug. His eyes had gone sad, so sad that Sherlock had to look away. “I know, Sherlock. I think I’ve always known.”
“You think I’m going to be upset,” Sherlock said dispassionately as John took the glass away. He painfully pushed himself upright. “Whatever it is you have to tell me, you don’t want to. You think I won’t like it.”
Twilight thickened into darkness. John wandered around the studio, looking at framed album covers that showed Davy Dreadful in his glory days and poking at the guitars that hung on the walls. “Do you play?” Felix asked.
“So if, say, a murderer went back—if he wrinkled,” Sherlock said, “and he killed someone else, the negative effect would be felt not only by him but by the now-surviving victim.”
There was, predictably, an enormous fuss. Half the Hall apparently had to be roused to get Sherlock’s bedroom warmed and ready, but finally he was whisked away by a footman, wrapped in about five blankets and looking exhausted and cross. John looked around at the clock on the mantle and was astonished to see it was not even midnight.
Sally looked at him steadily. “You want to go home?”
For the second time that day Sherlock’s knees gave way. He sank to the steps and buried his face in his hands.
. It’s nearly dawn, I can hear the birds.”
“Yes,” Trevor said simply.
“Araceli Hernandez,” Roz said almost reluctantly. “She was one of the earlier victims and the coroner thought that the baby had been removed almost immediately. She was eight and a half months along, and…her family has always held out hope that the baby survived.”
Sherlock glared at him, and Dimmock said hurriedly, “That’s Emma right enough, and that one there is the brother, he’s two. He’s still here, he was watching cartoons. Apparently Emma naps out here when the weather’s fine.”
Sherlock was on the second bottle when John came in, whistling cheerfully. When he saw Sherlock sitting on the bed his face broke into a smile so dazzling Sherlock wondered how he had ever thought the room bright before.
“Here,” Angelo said to John one day, when Sherlock had gone to visit a pair of near-feral pickpockets even younger than he was. “I really can’t eat it. Too much pressure on my belly.”
“Tell me,” Juliet said gently.
The courtroom was big and intimidating and crowded with people, none of whom were interested in John, so they were all chattering and buzzing away even as the clerk shouted for order. The statements of the soldiers were entered into evidence and the case presented. John was sworn in, identified himself and, on being asked, gave his age as sixteen.
There was a second of silence—the aural equivalent of Sherlock blinking at him—and then Sherlock said warily, “Pyjama bottoms, two t-shirts, dressing gown, socks. It’s cold.”
“Janine has to talk to Lucy ahead of time, or she’s going to try to match her nail polish and eye shadow to the dress and it’s going to be vile.”
“We shouldn’t—“
John laughed outright at that, as Sherlock had expected, and shut his laptop with an air of decision. “Well, let’s get going then. I’ll go talk to Elena about putting a lunch up for us.”
“It might just be cold enough for hell to freeze over, so perhaps I will.”
“That’s four times,” Sherlock hissed, which at least meant he got the last word as they had now arrived at the dining hall.
Thanks to Itco for very gently breaking the news to me that “Sigerson” is not actually a Norwegian name. Look, Arthur Conan Doyle, I know they didn’t have Google in your day, but would it have killed you to written the Norwegian embassy or something?
“Nothing. Well…” She waved her hand a bit. “It’s only that on our first date it was you got kidnapped and Sherlock had to come and rescue us, so I suppose it seems a little funny to me that you’re stopping work to keep
I already know what you’re going to say. You’re going to tell me that if I actually looked through the papers instead of flinging them across the room after a glance at the first page I might find something to interest me. I won’t. Criminal genius peaked with Moriarty and it’s been all downhill from there, petty criminals and petty motivations and no imagination and it’s all too tedious for words.” Sherlock flung one arm out, which left him draped across the sofa like a Victorian heroine in a swoon of terminal ennui.
John still felt anxious, but he appreciated Michael’s attempt to cheer him up. “We should learn a lot, working here, won’t we, Michael? Are you hoping to resume your studies when you leave?”
“Oh no you don’t,” John said suddenly and there was no listlessness to his voice—it was sharp and almost angry. “No. You do not get to do this. Sherlock Holmes, open your eyes and talk to me, you bloody fucking coward.”
can I, because I don’t know.” He’d begun to twist himself in his seat, rocking a little.
.” He gripped Sherlock’s hips and thrust hard and Sherlock did, crying out in desperate pleasure as he came. He had to admit, Tiernan had gotten really good at this.
“Slammed my face against a wall,” Sherlock said dispassionately. “Then a table. He did hit me though, but not much.”
“Sherlock? What are you doing?”
,” he assured John as they sat in the pub with Irene. “Unless we’re actually caught red-handed, which we won’t be, we’ll be able to bluff our way out of just about anything else. This is much less risky.”
glares in his direction.
Sherlock stepped back inside and immediately wrinkled his nose. After the fresh air outside the fug of the bothy was distinctly rank: woodsmoke, beans and, overwhelmingly, sex. He opened the windows.
“He won’t take the broth, he doesn’t like it. Oh, and watch he doesn’t scratch in his sleep--”
“Oh, love, that’s not true,” John said, pulling him in tightly. “No, don’t do that, I don’t mean you’re not brilliant at sex, you know you are. Sherlock, we already have a relationship, we have had for months. And what about all those nights we spent just sleeping together before? Those are the parts that really matter, like this right now, and you’re brilliant at this part too. I swear to you, if we never had sex again, I’d be okay with it as long as I had still had you with me, just like this.”
He did the only thing he had time to do in that fragment of a second before the gun went off: he turned.
Sherlock looked flummoxed. “But you’ve never had sex with a man since you’ve lived with me.”
“No--the gin is the clever part. The school does order quite a lot of gin, because Mr. Temple is a dipsomaniac--”
leaving.”
“Chinese. Probably Hong Kong. Could have bought it in London though.”
“When John comes, back, say you have to leave,” Sherlock said evenly. “I’ll manage from there.”
“Well, you’ll just have to go to A&E after all then, won’t you? I can’t suture up half your chest without lidocaine.”
something change—and he would have his chance, and when the chance came, he had to be ready.
“Did you get dirty?”
When he’d shut the door behind them Michael leaned against the wall and said, “Look…I know you need to work tonight. You’ve got to keep your head in the game; I respect that. But if you want to come back after you’re done…” He took his key card from his pocket and handed it to Sherlock. “Doesn’t matter if it’s late. I’m not asking for anything, I just like sleeping with you.”
“Where are we going?”
John reached out with the tip of his foot and snagged the crumpled pile of black tights. He flipped the tights up and caught them. “Hey, I think these are okay. We could use them again sometime.”
The weight fell away and John got swiftly to his feet, keeping his right arm close to his body. Sherlock was kneeling on the ground with his head down, shoulders heaving, and John reached out with his left hand and with a strength born largely of adrenaline hauled him to his feet, praying he would not hurt Sherlock further. The backpackers were staring at them wide-eyed, the rest of the café having fallen silent as well at this interesting turn of events.
“He was the lucky one.”
“How may do we have?”
“Anything good?’
“What are you talking about?”
John was thirty-four years old. He’d been in love, more than once, and he’d fallen in love and married a woman who was brave and true and had died in front of him fighting for a cause they both believed in. He thought he had nothing more to learn about love and nothing left to feel. He had been utterly wrong. Falling in love with Sherlock was a disaster, a catastrophe in every possible sense, but he knew he could no more tear himself away from Sherlock than he could his own arm.
” he breathed.
Lily banged her coffee cup on the pushchair in glee.
This section doesn't have the unambiguous happy ending, but, as promised, it's a nice little break from all the angst.
Rouncewell glanced at him. “Do you know who has the contract to supply her Majesty’s army?”
John knew perfectly well that as a stranger in town he might as well have a target painted on his back. He tried to remember which way he had seen the soldiers going; were they between him and the road back to Sherlock? The shopkeeper seemed to read his hesitation. “Come on out the back here,” he said quietly to John, glancing over at the two elderly ladies twittering by the teakettles. “If you’re trying to reach the forest road, which I’d advise, go straight down the alley and through the gate--you’ll be on the other side of the hedgerow then and like as not won’t be seen at all.”
They had to wait until the plane was safely airborne so they could put down the tray tables, and then they were off and running. Margaret was surprised to find she was enjoying herself. She’d never particularly thought she liked kids, but she’d been reevaluating a lot of things about herself the past year or so. She was thirty-eight now, and she couldn’t be a badass assassin forever; she’d eventually get caught. And she was sick of working for Moriarty. At first it had seemed like a good deal, him making all the arrangements and her pocketing most of the fee, but the man was utterly mental and getting worse. Margaret had been stealthily working on her exit strategy for months now, and was just waiting for the right moment. She had a moment’s fantasy of taking the girl off with her, raising her up to be a tough bird who could shoot and cheat at cards and take shit from no man, but this girl clearly had a mum back in England. She’d be all right. Still….maybe the motherhood thing wasn’t entirely out of the question. She’d think about it.
Sherlock shook his head, not trusting his voice.
been affected—by this, wouldn’t I be suffering the effects too?”
Sherlock returned to the surgeon a few days later and got his stitches out and the green light to return home, although he was advised to avoid air travel if possible. It took Mycroft a few days longer to get the Swiss government’s blessing—the police had not been thrilled that John had killed two people and then left the scene in a helicopter, no matter the mitigating circumstances. So they were able to see the Flower Clock after all, along with a number of equally dull tourist attractions that Sherlock deleted immediately. Thank God he had an injury that gave him an excuse to flee back to the hotel.
Sherlock’s fingers caressed John’s cock and squeezed the base in a way that somehow seemed both delicate and indescribably filthy. “I believe I was promised romance.”
Sherlock took a breath and hauled himself upright. His hip hurt where he’d fallen on it, but he ignored that and tentatively tried his left foot. He could bear weight on it, so that was a relief. Just a sprain, and Sherlock knew how to manage sprains. He looked for the cabin, which was a red blur in the distance, set his teeth, and began to hobble back.
“Nothing.”
Sherlock stretched—from the tingling in his arm, he’d been dead to the world for quite a while—and rolled onto his back. He felt the familiar ache in his hips and backside, but for the first time there was no bitterness, no shamed misery. He felt
The day had begun beautifully. John had woken early with the comfortable feeling that all was right with the world. The rain had finally stopped and he saw glimpses of blue sky out the window, accompanied by a whiff of new leaves and the glorious birdsong of London traffic. His date had gone well. The quinoa pilaf was, if not something he would want every day, edible: Sylvie had liked the organic pastries John had brought; they had spent a pleasant evening looking over her photos and discussing camping gear and various places they had traveled. They’d finished up with quite a nice snog, and all in all John felt the evening had been a success. Especially since Sherlock hadn’t texted him once.
“Well, high-strung. Let’s say that.”
“I’ll email you as soon as I have the file,” Donovan said, sounding relieved, and then thank God she rang off.
“Toby found another dealer,” Matthew said. “She talked to Danny and he said he had a special blend he’d sell her at cost, so she could take all the profit selling it to Toby. So she picked it up and took it to the studio that night. But Toby said he didn’t need it, he’d found some more. So she had it there and I guess—she was so tired, she’d been working so hard and she’d cut back on coffee to save money, and I guess she thought if she just took a little—a lot of people use here and there, they always say it doesn’t hurt to just take a bit, but it did hurt. It did.”
John made a show of strolling the aisles for a bit, inspecting the meagre offerings, before approaching the shopkeeper.
“Sherlock! Time to eat!” his mother called.
“Maybe,” Sherlock said cautiously.
Out in the lounge John settled into the familiar comfort of his chair and found himself confronted by the gaping absence of Sherlock across from him. He looked at the empty seat, the bare music stand, the violin case and unnaturally tidy desk. Shit. No wonder Sherlock had moved his armchair. John got up abruptly and went to Sherlock’s room.
For a moment they just stood staring at each other. Sherlock, who had no idea what to make of this, was trying very hard not to think at all; John was…what? His brows were drawn together in an expression almost of pain. There was anger there too though—Sherlock was adept at spotting John’s anger by now—and weariness, and something else Sherlock couldn’t decipher. Wearing yesterday’s clothes, a scraping of stubble. Drunk? Not close enough to tell.
use cocaine, and a few weeks ago he was complaining about his stash running low—something happened to his dealer, apparently.”
“I don’t want to get ejaculate on my clothes.”
John bit his lips, facing the bathroom door.  Of course he had been reckless.  Over the past month with Sherlock he was beginning to grow attached to the man he shared a bed with.  “Why?  Am I not allowed to become attached to you?”
“I could get used to this.”  John stated as he lay face down upon the rock, allowing the sun to warm his backside.
“Yes, yes… Arousal.  I know that already.”  Sherlock answered, annoyed that his mind palace was being delayed.  “Thus my affliction last night when you found me.”
“I’m fine, Sherlock.  He didn’t touch me.”  John caught Sherlock mid-pace and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, resting his head on the detective’s shoulder.
Sherlock lifted his head and focused on John.  “John?”
Mycroft lifted the folder he had placed on the chair next to him. “When Sherlock was small, our family stayed several summers at the estate of a family friend in Sussex. There was a cottage nearby where an old man kept bees. Sherlock had no interest in the things our parents hoped would interest him—going to the beach or learning to ride a pony—but he was fascinated by the bees and he visited the old man every day. For years he was adamant that when he grew up he too would be a beekeeper and live in that exact cottage. A few months ago, when it became evident that Sherlock would need single-storey accommodation rather soon, I made inquiries, but it was far too expensive to rent for long. However…” Mycroft took out a sheaf of stapled pages and passed them to John. “Thanks to our mutual friend’s troubled conscience, you now own it.”
It was 1993, a bad time to be mother to a gay son. All you could do was buy him condoms, and hope.
“And they are planning to perform it…” John looked at Sherlock’s blank face, then typed on his laptop. “…next Friday. Sherlock, this is quite big! It’s in the papers! Can we go?”
“You overpaid,” Sherlock said. “I gave her twenty pounds the last time but she went all the way to the florist and back then,
“Unlikely,” Sherlock said. “Even if it survived the initial removal, the killer would have had to want to keep it alive. There’s no evidence of that. He probably would have just tossed it into the bin liner and let it suffocate.”
“He doesn’t need to,” Sherlock said bitterly. “He’s been at Eton a whole year already. All he has to do is drop dark hints, how everyone will despise me and so on. I hate him.”
“That should do nicely,” Lady Smallwood said and then to Sherlock: “Won’t you have a seat? I’m sure you have questions.”
“I don’t understand,” John said. “How was he being indecent if he was just with another man? Was there a lady who escaped out the window, or something?”
“Want the whole story?” Moran asked. “I don’t mind. We’ve got some time to kill before the cavalry shows up.”
talk to the owner, and make sure she’s alone. Yes. Ring me back when you’ve got the information.” He rang off and sighed. “Makes me appreciate Lestrade. Don’t tell him I said that.”
“He jumped,” Minchin whispered. “Lord help us, he jumped.”
“Do you have to work tomorrow?”
The restaurant was almost empty save for a small clutch of elderly women gossiping in a corner, but the food was hot and John ate with relish. “Eat your stew,’ he told Sherlock, who was mostly stirring his in circles with his spoon.
“No, please, carry on as you were, certainly you must have trousers,” Lord Mycroft—Lord Sherrinford now, John reminded himself—said, with that smile that always looked slightly pained. “And John, I believe we are well past such formalities now. You will call me Mycroft.”
Sherlock swept off without answering. Let him sort it out with Mrs. Hudson.
John hesitated, clearly not wanting to leave Sherlock, but the operator answered and Sherlock began telling her the situation in rapid if imperfect German, so he gave a brisk nod and turned to the boy, who was looking back up the path with his face knotted with anxiety. “Doctor,” he said, pointing to himself and raising his eyebrows, and the boy looked enormously relieved and grabbed for John’s arm, tugging him back the way he had come.
“Wait a minute,” John said. “Let me get this straight. You sent Sherlock off to Eastern Europe to micromanage your revolution?”
This seemed to cheer the young lieutenant. “There’s always Sandringham. If we do well we can earn passes on our next leave. Not quite the same as having one in heat, but better than whatever beta slags we can get in London.”
At the crossway in the center of the stable John came to Circe, cross-tied and waiting patiently, but no one else was in sight. Circe nosed at John in the hope of more sugar. “Shh,” John whispered, looking over his shoulder just as someone came out of the tack room carrying a saddle. A very small someone. “What do you think you’re doing?” John said loudly.
For the first hour or so the prickling was manageable. Even as it grew the exercise helped—rowing, in particular, felt almost exquisite, the hard push with his legs stretching his kinking lower spine. By the time he started to run in place he had begun to prickle all over, though he kept going, doggedly pushing forward even as heat lubricant began trickling down his legs.
John climbed back down to find Sherlock had brought a teapot and dishes over to the tiny table set into the one alcove without a radiator. He looked out the windows and saw they were overlooking the rest of the abbey; a cloistered quadrangle sat directly beneath them.
“Yes.” Sherlock was now so overcaffeinated he was vibrating.
Sherlock smiled a quick, relieved smile, his cheekbones pink in the glow of the streetlights. “I won’t,” he promised, and for a moment John thought he hesitated, but then he was gone in a swirl of coat, leaving John feeling strangely restless and alone.
“ Sherlock sounded as though he were struggling to get the words out.
“Mycroft Holmes. And if your boss doesn’t know it…have him call
“Nope,” John said, trying to pull Sherlock back down into his embrace. “None of that. You made me a promise, remember?”
On the walk to Angelo’s Sherlock told John about his mother’s phone call.
“Sure you can. Shit, I really want to tell you to come over here, but you can’t.”
Dusk was thickening into darkness when they finally reached the shepherd’s little enclosure, and the prince’s legs were aching from the long climb. The shepherd gathered all the sheep into the fold, running his hands over their backs in the poor light to be sure all the flock was accounted for. “The source of the stream comes out over there if you want to drink and wash,” he said over his shoulder.
“New boys,” the young man announced to a slightly older clerk, who wrote down their names and ages and then took them into an inner office, where he announced, “New boys,” in his turn.
“Both of them, Dr. Watson. Mr. Holmes and his brother.”
“As you say, sir,” Sherlock said meekly, and John almost laughed. Sherlock sounded more like an aristocrat who had drunk too much port than anything else. “Stop smiling! This is harder than German. I’d like to hear you try
Oh shit, John thought, now we’re in for it.
he want?
John looked as though he was still trying to seem annoyed, but the corners of his mouth twitched. “We’d better get straight on home,” he said. “You’re soaked to the skin.”
Sherlock blinked several times in quick succession. “What?”
“You’ll let us know when you have him,” John said to Owen, not a question.
Sherlock quickly clicked over to the window that was displaying his inbox as John came up behind him, smelling pleasantly of shaving cream and soap. “Nothing worth my time.”
“Of course, my Lord,” John said, smiling for the first time.
Sherlock Holmes was nuzzling John’s neck whilst John was stroking his arse and his cock and this was so far over the edge into insane John wasn’t sure he’d ever find his way back.
“Potatoes are scheduled to be delivered tomorrow,” Sherlock murmured happily. He was trying to fold himself up like a Chinese puzzle so that John could wrap around him. “I can’t wait.”
John decided he’d spent enough time at the party to be polite and went looking for Molly. She was chatting animatedly with a tall man with wild dark hair, narrow glasses, and a truly atrocious jumper. He caught her eye, raised his eyebrows, and mimed waving good-bye; she beamed and nodded. John caught her meaning: John leaving early would give her a lovely excuse to be escorted home. Excellent. He went in search of Harry, who was on the sofa with Lucy and another woman, all sharing a container of ice cream.
“It implies he wants to see you again. I wouldn’t read too much into it. Maybe you have a natural talent for shagging. He didn’t ask me for permission to marry you, he might just want a…friends-with-benefits type of thing.” Irene was still watching him closely, though he couldn’t tell why.
John laughed. “She’s my landlady. And they aren’t really for me, it’s a present for an old tenant.” Green Jacket’s accent was American, and presumably he hadn’t been around long enough to recognize John from the tabloids or know of Mrs. Hudson’s most famous lodger. John gathered up the box and gave the man a half wave: “Got to run. Have a good weekend.”
“John, I’m sorry, I’ll be with you as soon as I can,” Simon said quietly, striding past him. John turned his head and realized he could see the dim outlines of things now. The thunder rumbled again, less loudly; the storm must be passing. John looked back toward the door so fast his neck cracked but he could see nothing there. The desk blocked his view of the floor.
John looked at him, not really trying to conceal his dislike: he outranked the little twat, and had ten years on him as well. “Have you ever even been with an omega before Sandringham?”
“So. Ask,” Juliet said when they had settled down and got drinks. “You’ve got something, I can tell.”
Sherlock thought,
“Yes, fine,” Sherlock said, far more interested in the case than the curry. “How soon can you get here?”
“Be still,” John crooned, pistoning his fingers with agonizing slowness in and out of Sherlock’s yearning body. Sherlock had no experience with this other than as a prelude to the main event, usually rushed and often abandoned altogether; he had no idea that John’s fingers inside him could feel so good. He tried to hold still, as John instructed, but his hips seemed to rock of their own volition. John spread his fingers, making Sherlock writhe, and stroked his prostate again. Sherlock was moaning, pushing back, seeking that touch, God, he was
“Good. Just came back to work and the first case I get is a bloody mess. Can he come take a look?”
“Sherlock, in case it’s escaped your notice, I’m on your side, so can you stop biting my damn head off?” John was rapidly losing patience.
Moran was beheaded on Tower Green and his head displayed on a pike. Now it was Pitts who was surrounded by well-wishers and sycophants on Sunday, while Moriarty remained prudently abroad. Pitts was so pleased with himself that he decided to hold a dinner party to celebrate. This was something of an event. Unlike many of the commanders who socialized frequently—Commander Adler always seemed to either be throwing or attending a party—Pitts’s entertaining was usually limited to the occasional small dinner, so the whole household was in an uproar. Even Sherlock contributed by going to the bakery in the Veilgarden and ordering a chocolate gateau of such extravagance that the hard-faced man threw in two cream teas for free.
Sherlock left the nondescript building in Mumbai to head back to his cheap hotel room. He’d given his report to the agent there and now said report was being encoded and sent off to London. The agent had promised that any responses would be delivered as soon as they arrived.
“God, you’re lovely,” John murmured, nuzzling into Sherlock’s neck and running his hands over his back. “Lie back for me?”
“Raw, isn’t it?” he said, catching sight of John in front of the fireplace. “Second time I’ve replaced my hankie today. Can’t believe you were out so long.”
And there would surely be a few semi-homophobic remarks thrown in as well:
at Sherlock’s arse.
“What about you?” John asked Lestrade.
Out of habit, John waited to ring Owen until he was halfway across town.
“I hadn’t expected to.” Mycroft did not, in fact, seem particularly fussed. “If she cracked this early I’d be enormously disappointed. No, we’ll pop her in our detention centre for a day or two, let her think we’ve forgotten about her whilst her underlings tell us all they know.”
The young man smiled a slow, well-known grin, wicked and lazy, and John burst into laughter. “Irene!”
“I will,” Sherlock promised. He used his long arms to push up a bit and rocked his hips in tiny increments. The motion rubbed John’s prick against the pillow pile in a way that sparked a bit of renewed interest in the proceedings. He flexed his own hips experimentally, pushing back, and found that an improvement over Sherlock pushing forward, so he did it again. “Is it—“ he panted, ”is it okay if I do this for a bit?”
“Ah,” Sherlock gasped, his back arching in a convulsive shiver, and John let go to grip his hips with both hands and thrust again. He wasn’t sure he was consistently keeping the angle right, but it didn’t seem to matter—Sherlock was still making frantic “ah, ah, ah,” noises and pushing back into John in a quickening rhythm. John could feel his bollocks tightening--it wasn’t going to take long like this. He tried to decide if he should try to reach around and grab Sherlock again before he got too close, but he was afraid if he let go they would slip, and anyway oh God oh Christ it was too late anyway, it just felt too fantastic and he couldn’t stop and now he was just
“Nonsense…”  Sherlock waved John’s concerns away.  “You are my beloved and so I shall shower you and your bride with everything you desire.”
Sherlock pushed in and froze, feeling himself expel deep within John’s tight heat.  Giving a few more half-hearted strokes, his orgasm washed over him and he leaned against John’s back.
After putting themselves to rights, they snuggled together under the blankets, content to be together.  They stayed that way until morning.
Sherlock moaned.
“How do you know?”  John demanded.  “And what of the front line?”
“What about Rosie?” Sherlock asked.
“GET OUT!”  John demanded.  Getting up from the bed he went to the door.  “Guard!”
Giving a few experimental thrusts he found that his penis really liked the friction.  John seemed to like it too if his whispers of encouragement were any indication.  “Like this?”
“No.  I’m used to it.  It will feel really good for me.”
“What do you want?”
The room was lit by a fire in the hearth.  The bed was unmade as if Sherlock had been using it before he had met John in his study.  For a moment he looked around, trying to find the best place to meet his fate.  And he remembered the moment he had first met Sherlock, placed before him as an offering.  Quickly he went to his knees on the hearth.  The door made a sound and he bowed as the sex slaves had done almost a year before.  The door opened and shut.  Footsteps entered the room and stopped before him.
I shrugged and got up from the floor to sit in my chair, across from him.  “What’s to celebrate?”
“Yes, m’lord.”  Lestrade answered as he took the dagger from the lady’s hand and led her away.
“It’s difficult to grow up without your mother.”  Sherlock mused, lightly tracing the edge of John’s tunic with his fingertip.
“Downstairs?”
Sherlock nodded and dismounted, watching John pull off his clothing until he was just as bare.
John rested against Sherlock’s warmth, feeling a little drowsy in their afterglow.  “Now… About my chamber in the south tower…”
“Sorry, m’lord.”  Lestrade approached from behind.  “The king wishes to see you.”
“I’m fine.” Sherlock answered.
“Isn’t that enough?”
“Gods… That’s filthy.”
“Then show me.” John answered.
“You will be a good husband to her.  Marrying you will give her the stability she needs and she doesn’t have to worry about her husband taking what is rightfully her land.”
“That also happened.”  John answered.
He knew what I was doing, why was he pretending otherwise?
Powerful thrusts pushed him into the bedding and John braced himself to take it.  Fingers clutched him, holding him in place as the one behind him continued.  The other hand frantically pumped at his cock.  Too soon he finished, his seed falling uselessly on the blanket.  The lord had been completely unprepared for the intensity of the moment and he couldn’t hold back.  There was dampness on his back and it confused him to feel it.  Suddently Sherlock went still and the collapsed, pushing him into the bedding.
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”  John whispered as he tugged at his garlands.  “I should have known… I should have remembered.  I don’t know what happened to the time…”
“You were also attracted to me.”
“Why do you want to possess me?  I don’t understand the appeal.”
Sherlock hesitantly wrapped his arms around John’s back to reciprocate the hug.  “Are you cold?”
Mycroft glanced at John a moment before pursing his lips.  “You are aware that I’m not involved in EVERY project… right?”
“So… Basically you just look like a regular human.”  John observed.  “She told me that your change is your sexual appetite and the size of your penis.”
“I’m fine.”  John answered.
“Ok… I’ll… do it.”  Nervously Sherlock reached down under John’s scrotum, running his finger back to find the orifice by touch, watching John tremble beneath him.  His finger encountered someplace open, warm and wet.  “Why are you wet?”  Quickly inspecting his finger he saw nothing that would normally leak out of the orifice.
Sherlock started to tremble and then fidget.  When her lips touched his shaft he nearly jumped out of the chair.  Desperately he looked around the flat, his eyes landing on John.
“Hello, John.”  A female voice came from the water.
“There was always the possibility.” John answered.
John rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand.  “Will you forgive me?”
“Have you seen him since that video was made?”
“Do I have a choice?”  John smirked.
John’s breath was warm as his canines faintly dragged against Sherlock’s neck.  “I could take you…”
“I want you to prove it.”
“Ok?”  John lay back down.
“Tell me I’m wrong.  Tell me you haven’t been self-destructive because of him.”
John shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Someone probably disagreed with his correct assessment.  It happens.”  Wiping his hand on a dish towel, he returned to the table and sat down.  While he had been distracted he found that a corner of Rosie’s sandwich was missing.  It seemed that Sherlock was correct.  A watched Rosie rarely eats.
Sherlock watched as John began to unbutton before pulling out the plug.  “Should I refill the tub or will it be a shower?”
Quickly I pulled on my dressing gown and entered the living room to see Molly sitting on the couch, reading.  Molly looked up at me and gave me a soft smile.  I knew from her look that she pitied me.  My Alpha was gone.  “Are you alright?”
Sherlock cried out and went stiff.
It seemed they were at a stalemate.  John stared down at his bare foot.  His ankle was normal sized.  Casually he rubbed it against his other foot, still in the shoe.  “How about I remove something and ask a question.  You answer?”
“Not out in the open.  We’re not safe here.”
I shook my head wearily.  “You’re an Alpha… You wouldn’t understand.”
“He forced himself on my mate… how else should I react?”
“Sherlock… There seems to be a side effect…”
A movement in the corner of the bed chamber caught his eye.  Lestrade stood there, unnoticed.  “Lestrade?”
John firmly planted his feet on the ground and kicked back with his caught feet.  And then the gorgon dropped him.  John stumbled and fell, his eyes accidentally opened and he took in the scene before him for the first time.  The gorgon, Moriarty had a long, snake body.  Sherlock was caught in his coils.  John had escaped a length of coil.  The gorgon himself had his attention on Sherlock.  Moriarty turned and John gasped.  Dark hair, dark eyes… There were snakes in the man’s hair.  From the waist down he had the body of a snake.
John pulled his mouth of Sherlock and looked back at where Sherlock desperately clung to his body, sucking him and pushing a third finger into him.  “Fuck…” Resting his face against Sherlock’s hip, he moaned, cresting into his climax.
John panicked.  What were the odds of the murderer picking him as his next victim?  Glancing towards the stage, he made eye contact with Sherlock… At least he hoped he did.  John suspected it was hard for Sherlock to see with the spotlight in his eyes.
Sherlock cringed a little.  The attention to his grooming after a session by the werewolf was a bit embarrassing.  Every spec of semen was quickly found and consumed.  It felt good… fantastic even… but it was still very… odd being the focus of THAT much attention.  And Sherlock felt just a little bit unworthy of that attention.  There was nothing he could offer in return.  John seemed to enjoy sucking his cock… but Sherlock didn’t know how to reciprocate the gesture.  Really he couldn’t help but think he should be giving more.  The orgy video showed very little cock sucking if any.  All of the participants were inside their partner.  Sherlock felt more than a little intimidated… and unworthy.  John was an experienced, sexual being… and Sherlock was not.
“Everything he’s done since he started seeing his new therapist after Mary died… It was programmed into him by our sister.  He carried out her whims.”
“That’s my good girl.” Sherlock kissed her curls again.
Rosie made a face.  “He’s already my daddy.”
I took a deep breath and held it, confused by her conversation with herself.
“That’s it, my lord.”  Irene whimpered, wrapping her arms around his back.
Sherlock held him for a long moment before letting him go.  “You should return to your wife.”
“You’ve had your fingers in my arse and you’re asking me why?”
John watched them go before turning his attention to Sherlock.  “That was very rude!”
“Harder!  Draw blood!”
“What did she mean by that?”  John demanded.  “Why do I have to be naked?”
But at that moment John’s guards filled the room, instantly aiming their swords and spears at the naked man.
“I accept it.”
They were making their way down a corridor in the keep.  No one was about.
“Bite me!”
Sherlock gasped and reached for John’s head, pulling his face to the faun’s sternum.  “Shut your eyes!  Shut your eyes, now!”
John Watson sat at the table across from his daughter, watching her pick at her sandwich.  At three years old she had begun a phase in which she gave Sherlock a run for his money and lived on a diet that consisted of air and dew from morning glories.  She had him beat in that he sometimes was weak and needed tea with milk and sugar and an occasional biscuit.  Since she had no interest in eating her lunch, Rosie Watson was intent on using her index and thumb to pinch off bits of bread and roll them into tiny dough balls that she dropped onto the table.  John found the whole process exhausting.
“I like his little cock.” Another voice chuckled.
Sherlock and John were met by Siger Holmes whom took one of the bags.  “Good to see you!”
“I’m a faun.  I could take a giant or a kraken.  I can certainly take a centaur stallion in his human form.”
Sherlock regarded the tiny being with a hint of sadness on his face.
“Not important?”  John stared at Sherlock a long moment before his eyes went wide.  “It’s a trick!  This whole thing was a trick!  You’re here to kill me!”  Quickly he went for the door.  “Help!  Help, guards!”
“Let’s have dinner.”
“For my body?”
Rosie stirred as if she knew her parents were discussing her.  Releasing Sherlock’s hand, she repositioned herself so that she was sprawled between them with John at her head and Sherlock at her feet.
Sherlock frowned.  “I want you to stop being so annoying.”
“Angelo’s for dinner tonight?” I suggested as John sat down on the sofa with a mug of tea.
Sherlock shut the door and crossed the room to set the candle down along with a vial.  Without looking at John he pulled off his nightshirt and tossed it aside on the floor.  The mattress moved as Sherlock climbed into the bed.
John ran his hands through his hair before reaching into his pocket to pull out a foil wrapped Alpha-sized condom.  Tossing it on the bed, he began to undress.  “You could have gotten pregnant… Studies show that the treatment for estrus poisoning has a high percentage of pregnancies even if the Alpha doesn’t bite.”
Sherlock stepped into the middle of the room, staring down at the blackmailer.  “What we have learned today should never leave this room.”
John gave an exasperated whine.
“John…”
John stared at him in shock.  It seemed he needed a bit more encouragement.
It was around that time that rumors began to circulate around court about Mary’s pedigree.  And one day she packed up and left in the dead of night, leaving her husband in the arms of his lover, and their child in the care of the wet nurse.
(See the end of the chapter for
A light drifted over them.  It looked something like a firefly but it was bigger.  The light circled the faun’s head, revealing a pair of horns nestled in dark curls.  The light pulsed and suddenly a naked woman stood before them.  “Hello.”  The woman smiled, not at all concerned with her unclothed state.  Her skin’s glow rivaled the light from the fire.
With a grunt and a desperate movement of limbs Sherlock managed to roll on top of John, grinding against him.  “Like this?”
“No.  It may be you want a child… Or a woman.  It will be something I can’t give you.  You may grow to resent me for bringing you here and stripping you of your mortality.  …Forcing you to mate with me so that I may survive.”
John untied his shoe and pulled it off, setting it aside as he pondered his first question.  It was best to start with the basics.  “What is your name?”
Sherlock hopped up from his seat and approached the two.  “Rise Lord John and Lady Mary.”
“I love you.” I answered.
The room was dark.  It was either very late or very early.  From the child monitor he could hear Rosie’s breathing and occasional soft grunt.  Beside him his boyfriend John snored.
They stood, staring at each other for a long moment.
“And yet you want me to shag you.”  John pointed out.  “Something you haven’t allowed others to attempt.”
“My lady… Please… We’re outside.”
John rolled over, resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “He did.  But I’m alright.”
“You could have told me.”
Finally we broke apart for tender, soft kisses.  “Stay.” I begged of him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.  “Notice his helm is gone… As is his sword.  They were taken from him before he was pushed.  The person who took them needed a guard’s helm and sword to pass for a guard.”
John looked over Sherlock’s naked body and gave a helpless laugh.  “That’s how you got me to trust you.  Look at me!  I’m naked and unarmed!  Where would I hide my sword?”
“Jim…” Sherlock’s tone was soft and deadly.
“I wonder why I’m even here.” John admitted.
King William stood still with his arms held out after his throw.  Slowly he lowered them to his sides.
“Why are you sad?”
At that moment several thoughts passed through Sherlock’s head simultaneously.  All involved himself in various positions with John pounding into him.  Of course John would know what to do.  John had experience.  “I know you do.”
“Holmes…” Watson whispered.
“You’d gain my standing… the standing I had in my old pack.  You’d be alpha with me… my alpha mate… our own pack.”  John’s lips pressed against Sherlock’s neck and lightly kissed there.
John went to the door and called in a guard.  “Please take Molly to the kitchens and outfit Lestrade for guard duty.”  When they were gone that just left Sherlock.  “What are your skills?”
John nibbled on Sherlock’s scrotum.  “Do you still love me, Lord Sherlock?”
“Such as?”  John glanced towards the bed and then returned his gaze to his desk.
Sherlock felt something die inside of him.  There had been something rising within him… Hope, need.  Hunger.  And with John’s words they came crashing down upon him.  The back of his throat seized up and he found the corners of his eyes sting as his vision blurred.  It took him several moments to realize he was about to cry.  Horrified at the idea of John seeing, he turned away and hastily climbed out of bed.  Trembling fingers found his robe and he pulled it on.
I didn’t answer.  The sweat on his back was cooling as evidence of what we had done began to fade.  My scent was no longer pungent.  With a grunt John pulled out and waddled off to the bathroom to deal with the condom, leaving me alone on the bed that still smelled of us.  The tears came again.
“How can I not?”  Molly asked, edging closer to the bars.  “He is… Extraordinary.”
Watson’s eyes were on the slave, Sherlock.  “Thank you.  What is your name again?”
“Why did you turn it off?” I asked.
Sherlock took John’s hand and rubbed his thumb across the knuckles as if to soothe him.
“Fine…”  Irene rolled her eyes and stepped back, returning to her tiny light size and buzzed away.
“You are wrong, John Watson… he is my brother and he will always be my concern.  Human packs don’t work like werewolf packs.”  Opening the door he stepped out.  At the last moment he pulled a disc from his pocket and handed it to John.  “More footage from your pack.  Good day.”  And then he was gone.
“You all have a desire?  What is yours?”
Sherlock smiled at him.  “I made a vow.”
Like clockwork they retired to Sherlock’s bedroom and Sherlock changed into his night shirt.  As he lay on the bed Watson sat down on the edge.  But Sherlock had something else in mind for that night.  As Watson reached down to take Sherlock in hand, Sherlock reached out to touch Watson’s crotch, finding him to be hard.
“I do.”
The king tapped his fingers on his desk, pursing his lips.  “Why?”
Sherlock pulled his hand from John’s trousers and stared at the military general.
“Only if I don’t wash my hair.”  John turned to him and helped him stand before pulling the shower curtain into place.
“You’ve been programmed to harm Sherlock.”
“You were injured in battle only four years later.  You were still a very young man when you gave up the pleasures of the flesh because you lost a part of yourself on the battlefield.  I would like to give back that missing part… If I can.”
John shrugged and rolled over onto his back.  “We sleep in a nest under the stars.  But it would be nice to be safe and snug someplace not so out in the open.  It doesn’t have to be much.  I miss sleeping in a bed but I know with the materials we have that probably won’t be possible.”
Also NaNoWriMo starts November 1st.  I'm thinking of completely rewriting "Need Me" into a non-fanfic.  I haven't reread the fic in ages and so I will attempt to remake it based on what I remember about it with a lot more world building.
“You’re bothering my mate.  You have to leave now.”  John advanced on Mycroft who was still near the doorway.  “Perhaps you can find out where Sebastian went…  There must be some tracking on us.  I remember something was embedded in my neck before my first trip outside the compound.”
“Look what they did to you!” Sherlock gesticulated at John.  “And that was only because they weren’t sure if I had affection for you.  Now they know… Or they suspect.  Next time they won’t wait for me to rescue you.”
Then, suddenly, the room erupted in chaos.  People tried to leave but were met with police in uniforms.  In the middle of it all the peacock stood, proud and tall, surveying the room.
“Think nothing of it.” Sherlock answered, resting his hand on Rosie’s chest.  The small child gave a small sob before falling back asleep, reassured by the weight of the hand on her.
John released his hold and wearily wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s body to complete the hug.  “Told you I was close.”
“This is what his highness wishes for you… An heir.  Heirs come from marriage.”
“Why?”
“But I’ll still treat you as a mate… because you are.  At least in the ways of my old pack we are…”
Sherlock looked back over his shoulder at the contrite doctor.  “You cannot be serious.”
“I don’t need anything from him that I don’t already get.”
And with that John left the room.
“Go away?”  John sat up to look at him.
Sherlock pulled off John’s cock to kiss his belly again.  “Because you need heirs.  Heirs come with marriage.  And I can’t marry you…”  Sherlock’s kisses found John’s scrotum and down between his arse cheeks.  A tongue probed there.
John’s eyes trailed down Sherlock’s body, noticing the beginning of the erection.  “Maybe sucking your cock isn’t the best way to please you.  Too many memories involved even though I’m the one that swallows you.  I suppose that detail is what just makes it tolerable.”
“I thought I’d never get out of there.” John concluded as he collapsed in his chair across from me.  “I couldn’t be late picking up Rosie.”
“I thought…”
Sherlock pressed his face into the top of John’s head.  “Of course I would.”
The next day we were pulled into a case.  John entitled it “The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.”  Our young client was a fan of our work and followed our blog since the Baskerville case.  There was a poodle named Wellington that had been murdered.  That case took several days to resolve.  Solving it was easy.  The fallout from that resolution was difficult.
My andogynecologist made a face as he assessed my paperwork.  “Mr. Holmes… Something came up in your bloodwork.  I can’t put you back on suppressants… You’re pregnant.”
“Yes.” Sherlock breathed against John’s lips.
“Starving.”
“Sherlock… You’re not forcing me.”  John sighed and wrapped his arms around the faun.  “I went away with you because I wanted to.  I’m a centaur now… Who else could have me aside from a faun?”
John opened his eyes and looked down, startled.  “Did you fall?”
“I didn’t realize…  I mean I’ve had sex with humans before and I didn’t think…”  Biting his lips, John nodded to himself.  Idly his hand reached up and touched the bite Sherlock had given him on his trapeziod muscle.  “I’ve never asked to be bitten before.”
“On your back.”
“I can’t eat or drink right now.  It doesn’t really hurt… but it’s rather uncomfortable.  It’s like… like… the moon is playing tug of war with something inside of me.  At moonrise of the full moon it wins the tug of war and my wolf side is forced out of me.  It takes several minutes.  Usually I can change in less than a second but this… this is so much longer.  And it’s the same at moon set.  I can feel it approaching and leaving over the course of days… like an itch on my skin.”
“There you go.  Deep, cleansing breaths.”  Watson murmured as he kept his handkerchief in place.  “Relax.”
“Hey…” John reached up and touched the cut on Sherlock’s face.  “You haven’t told me how you got that.”
Sherlock froze, eyes wide.  “You met a siren?  Did she touch you?  Did she… Kiss you?”  Immediately the faun got up and looked John over.  “You don’t look drowned.”
John rolled his eyes and looked to my mobile.  “How does she know your birthday and I don’t?”  There was jealousy in his voice.  I could imagine him rolling that thought around while he used my mouth.
Sherlock bit his lips and nodded.  “It’s you.  It’s always been you.  I tried to deny it, but I can’t anymore… I need you.”
John removed his own shirt, vest, and trousers.
“With what?”  John got up from the ground and picked up the coat, dusting it off before handing it back to the man.  “My clothes are somewhere around here.”  Not bothering to cover up, John moved to a different tree and reached into the trunk to pull out a bag.  Quickly he got dressed with the contents of the bag.  “What do you want?”
“That is what it means to be my lover… And it’s only fair since I have to give you up for a time while you perform your husbandly duty.”
“I think I am the one who gets to decide that.”
“Hush.  We don’t want to get caught.”
I stopped taking them the day Mary died.  The bullet that killed her was meant for me and I was on borrowed time.  I stopped taking suppressants and plunged myself into the drugs so I would forget.  I would forget that I was about to die and that my Alpha hated me with every fiber of his being.  It was better to forget and then slip away.
“Was all that okay?” John asked softly. “Did it work for you? Anything too much, anything you want different next time?”
“No, I’m fine.”
To John’s surprise, it helped. Listening to Sherlock struggle to soften his razor-sharp consonants and broaden his vowels could not help but make him smile, even as he knew the task’s importance. “You need to say ‘sir’,” he told Sherlock. “All the time, to everybody. It’s like punctuation for people like us.”
Sherlock lifted the napkin and peered at his tray, but the bread and cheese had gone dry and hard. This made Sherlock feel hungrier than ever. He also felt sorry for himself. Bored to extinction
“Oh,” Mycroft said in the tones of someone unwrapping a surprising birthday gift.
“Mycroft knows everything.”
Sherlock wriggled his way around, frowning as he attempted to keep his balance with his hands tied, and John took a piece of ice from the bowl he had set on the bedside table and popped it into his mouth. When Sherlock had finally got himself maneuvered around to a fair approximation of where he was supposed to be, John spit out the ice, took him by the back of the head, and plunged his chilled tongue into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock gasped at the sensation—God, he felt so hot--and dropped his head back, letting John take possession of his warm mouth. John reached for the ice, still kissing, and slowly ran the edge of the ice cube over Sherlock’s collarbone.
, to Lord Sherlock?” Sherlock. Sherlock, who was a lord, who was his employer’s son. Who was a
“Well, okay. Just…be careful?”
“She’s a photographer from Hampshire,” Sherlock said. “How do you think she arranged a murder in the Himalayas? She had to have help. Professional help.”
John’s hips moved ever so slightly, making pleasure flare through Sherlock’s body again. He heard his own voice whimper and John moved again, grinding into him and it was so much, so exquisite, that he could not help pushing back.
Sherlock understood, meant the strange and infinite river, and yet not: he saw the cellar bunker around him now, the fluorescent lighting and concrete walls. “But I have to…” he started but before he finished the thought he knew it was wrong. He didn’t need to be willing to die to defeat Moriarty; he had always been willing to give up everything. What he had finally learned--after six lifetimes and still, it seemed, too late--was that he did not have to do it alone. “Oh,” he said sadly.
“I can’t change into a wolf several hours before moonrise.  I’m stuck in my human form right now and I will be until it happens.”
“Oh!  Sherlock!”  Molly beamed, obviously pleased to see him.  “This way.”  Molly pulled out a body and stood nearby as Sherlock began to look it over.  “How was your trip?”
“Mary…”
“You are often busy.”
Sherlock curled up on his side of the bed, closing his eyes.  He could live with John only having sex with him when he absolutely had to… Really he could.
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this.  She was supposed to stay with me and I would protect her.  What kind of knight am I if I am unable to protect my own wife?”
“You disappeared from your place at the bar and I knew… I knew he had you.” Sherlock wrapped his arms around John, holding him tight.
“Your highness…” A tenor greeted.
John started to get up again.  “I’ll shatter his skull…”
“Because I’m cold.”
“We are to live in guest chambers?”  John turned to look at Lestrade, frowning.
“Tell me about your meeting of our new king.”  Sherlock requested as he lay naked on his side, one arm casually thrown over John’s waist.
“Where shall we put them?  The bridal chamber isn’t… It’s not meant for…”
“I am a warg soldier.”  John frowned at the computer.
We went through my sister’s idea of games.  They involved death and killing.
There was no answer.
“Deduce!”  Sherlock commanded.
“It’s alright.”
“What?”
John obeyed.
“So you gave me your number because I’m a soldier… Was a soldier.”
Too quickly I was falling, slipping over the edge and I climaxed between us.
“I know.”  John whispered and kissed his cheek, aware that Sherlock had been licking his dirtiest of places.  Love would only allow him to do so much.
I played with gusto my own composition.  I wrote it around the time the Woman came into our lives.  During that time John brought woman after woman into our flat.  They passed through his bed and out the door.  I watched the man I wanted to be with chase and discard tall brunettes.  And all the while he kept a count of the number of texts I received from the Woman.  John, my clueless John, had no idea that I kept count of his women as he kept count of my texts.  We moved around each other in a jealous dance of mutual frustration.  Him with his parade of nameless brunettes and me with my soft gasps of ecstasy.
“John wouldn’t do that to you.”
“You would not believe the day I had…” John’s voice came from my kitchen.  For several minutes he made a show of adding things to my refrigerator and placing Rosie’s bag on the table.
John’s eyes rolled back in head feeling the warm splatter.  And then he realized Sherlock’s hand was damp as it stroked him, teasing his scrotum and his ass.  “God, Sherlock…” John moaned.  One glance down told him that Sherlock was using the considerably large puddle of cum on him.  A finger tickled at his ass and he cried out, feeling himself release into the warm, wet mouth.
John grunted.  “Wha?”
A week before the wedding a message was sent from the king.
Sherlock bent down, for he was taller, and brushed his lips against John’s.  A warm hand found its way into John’s trousers to touch him.
“You need a knot.  This heat will end if you have a knot.” John informed me as he opened the package and rolled the large condom over his length.  It was made to catch the impressive amount of semen an Alpha produced.  His half knot kept it in place.  “What position do you prefer?”
“Not me!  It was Sherlock.  She calls both of us ‘daddy.’” John explained.
“Stop!” John commanded, annoyed at Sherlock’s observation.
An hour later the two were found wandering the grounds arm in arm.  “How is it you came to be here without an escort?”
A little filler... Do you know what's coming in January???  SEASON 4!  So I'm basically just vamping until it's released since I'm vaguely running parallel to the series.  We'll see what happens in January.
“She did.”  Sherlock responded as he stepped into view.  His cheek was bleeding and it dripped onto his blue silk shirt.  “Sorry I’m late.”
