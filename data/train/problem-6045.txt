“—and two, I really had no idea at the time that I felt any such way, and in my defense—”
Tony feels a rush of emotion equal parts guilt, irritation, and fondness. Only a fool as big as Rhodey would do something like put Tony’s health over his own, and only Rhodey would be forward enough with him to put it like that.
“Tony…”
“A few options are from SHIELD,” Tony says. “Nobody touched by the Hydra doxxing, of course. Some known personally by our resident double-0’s, or other trusted sources. A couple are ex-military psychs too, people with experience handling classified information.”
“Screw you,” Clint says.
Mr. Stank.”
“Thanks, Shellhead,” Natasha says, chest heaving. There’s blood dripping across the hollow of her throat, and streaks of mud on her cheek, but Tony’s going to count it as a win anyway.
“I shouldn’t have bothered you,” Tony says, pressing a hand over his eyes, briefly, and he feels downright miserable, but turns away anyway. What did he honestly think was going to happen? Rogers isn’t some magical creature who can fix Tony at will. He’s human, Tony reminds himself.
“FRIDAY gave you a color for the coffee too,” Steve says, tripping all over the words in his haste. Tony is too tired for this. “Vision doesn't make coffee.”
“Tony,” Pepper says firmly. “We are not giving away self-sustaining energy to one of the most developed, well-off countries in the world.”
The first thing he does is send out that email to the other Avengers, but while he’s waiting for replies he digs out the design for the hardware that’ll let him program and reprogram the nanites. He spends most of the morning fabricating what looks like a slightly smaller hemodialysis machine for blood transfusions, and in between work on that he lays out for various scans and takes blood samples for FRIDAY to analyze.
“Are you living here?” Sam asks, not harshly, but his eyes are sharp.
“Hey, Buck,” he says after a minute of staring down the Black Widow. Bucky hums his acknowledgment. “Let’s go hunt down some more chairs.”
Steve’s quiet after that. Almost a minute goes by in silence before Tony looks over, and Steve’s face is stony as he stares through the lines of trees. His jaw is tight and tendons stand out in his neck.
“So,” Tony says eventually. His arms are folded on the table, his head resting on top of them. Bruce is fiddling with his phone, waiting for the hour mark to make his next observations. “How’re things going with you and Natasha?”
“On my way, Cap,” Tony says, already angled that way. “Where in the building, Wanda?”
“—heh, a little late for—”
“Please,” Bruce says, just as quietly and just as vehemently, “without it, you really think Tony would still be alive?”
It’s surreal how normal the night feels. Like they’ve been a team all along, or something, and how the fact that Steve and Tony kissed and have been sharing a bed is just—a natural addition, apparently. Everything stays relaxed, and Tony doesn’t seek out another drink, though the knowledge sits heavily and nags at him: his own weakness for alcohol, the choice of drunken oblivion being taken away, and his selfishness in not even bothering to learn about Scott, who he thinks is a generally good person, by the way.
“This doesn’t even matter anymore,” Tony mutters eventually. Then, louder, “This is in the past—Steve, this isn’t going to fix anything now.”
“You’ve got a unique situation,” Tony says in agreement. “And I didn’t want to do anything without your say-so, but I’d like to bring your aunt in on the conversation. And as for the secret identity bit, I don’t think there’s any reason you’d have to reveal your face. Especially not right away. Though I also think this might be a good opportunity for you to be able to have a therapist who knows the ins and outs of your life, who will also be discreet.”
“Hi,” Steve says, “Tony, I. Sam said he saw you.”
Tony wakes up in the morning feeling well-rested and clear, though it still takes him a couple minutes to realize he just woke up, which means he was asleep. His senses come alive instantly, processing and sorting information: he’s warm with his back tucked up against the cushions on the back of the couch, his shoulder wedged between the couch and Steve’s torso; he’s mostly on top of Steve, using him as a pillow. Steve’s laying on the couch on his back, one of the throw pillows folded up under his head. Tony’s pretty sure one of his arms is pinned underneath Tony, but the other is wrapped around his waist, caught between Tony’s shoulder blade and the couch back. Either Steve or FRIDAY must’ve turned the TV off at some point. He guesses it must be late morning from how bright it is. There are hushed sounds coming from behind them somewhere—the kitchen, if Tony’s right. He focuses, trying to figure out who it is by sound. There’s the sound of ceramics sliding across the countertop (something Bruce does when he’s sleepy and uncoordinated), a distinctive plop, plop, plop of plate, mug, and drumming fingers (Thor, for sure, no one else makes that much noise simply existing unless they’re actively pouting), and the whisper of socked feet across the hardwood floor, the inhale-exhale of perfectly even breathing (Natasha, cautiously quiet out of habit).
“I’ll keep you posted,” Natasha says. Steve twists to look back at where she and Bruce are standing still, not following. “I’m gonna catch Bruce up on some things before someone gets a nasty surprise.”
Tony thinks of Natasha showing up and pulling bananas out of thin air, of her believing or disbelieving him at his word. He could use that, some of her crisis management, he thinks, and then he remembers the ridiculous, “Of course—anything,” over the phone, like a promise because he just doesn’t know when to stop, and Tony’s mouth is open before he even completely decides, but when he speaks, it’s to say Steve’s name.
“What the fuck,” he whispers and hesitantly (suspiciously) reaches for a plate, watching them out of the corner of his eye as they all watch him slowly reach for the sausage.
“We’ll be there tomorrow. Let the team know?”
“It’s nice out here,” Tony says aloud, giving a voice to the tranquility settling over his mind, casting his eyes over the orchard. The trees are shorter than Tony expected for apple trees, but sturdy looking. He doesn’t doubt they can hold their own in the wicked upstate winters. Steve looking at him in a way Tony can’t immediately identify.
“Holy shit!” Tony says, just as a lucky shot gets him in the ankle, knocking the flight stabilizers out of whack and sending him careening for a sickening moment before he rights himself. Focus, he thinks.
Eventually, at some point, they break apart and Tony gasps, feeling overheated. He runs his fingers through Steve’s hair and the position he’s in isn’t the most comfortable with how he’s twisting but with this body it’s not really a big deal at all. He smiles and Steve’s looking up at him, lips turned up and eyebrows down and—hey, he looks almost heartbroken, Tony realizes.
“What the hell,” Wanda says quietly from his side.
“Why aren't you more worried about this?” Tony finally demands. His blood is boiling, singing—he thought Rhodey would be more concerned, would have something sympathetic to say at the very least.
And then they’re gone and Tony scans the room for a way out because he may be a fool but he knows his hard limits when he hits them. He catches Clint’s eye by mistake, because of course Clint gets to see this. And see he does, in the sharp way he does in the field, sharply and thoroughly. Tony holds his gaze for all of four seconds and shakes his head twice slowly,
He knows he has responsibilities, but he finally feels like he can breathe. That’s what he told Steve he’s out here to do, and he meant it. Even if he’s still up-to-date and working on projects for everyone else, he’s not in a state of constant performance. This is the most freedom he’s ever had. He just doesn’t want it to end.
They end up, for just a moment, in the dark, the movie’s menu casting them in blue-white light, with Tony’s palm against the side of Steve’s head, holding him so that Steve’s head is pressed to Tony’s shoulder. One of Steve’s feet is curled up on the couch beside him, and Tony bets it’s uncomfortable. He lets Steve up after about thirty seconds there, and Steve just reaches for the remote and settles in with his shoulder pressed to Tony’s.
“What’s up?” Steve asks. He’s watching more carefully now, with tight eyes. Tony just shakes his head sharply, once, twice, and then stops abruptly when it makes his nausea spike.
“What?” Wanda says.
“Behind the car rental service building up the street,” she says. “I can fly someone there, but—”
bounces off the armor, singeing it slightly, and ricochets into Carnegie’s lit overhangs. Sparks fly and the overhang dips ominously.
“The princess of Wakanda?” Bruce says, still sounding bleary. He’s even rubbing his eyes—it’s
“I admit,” Thor says, his voice a calm, low hum, and Tony almost startles all over again, “I know the word therapy, though the concept is...slightly foreign.”
“Uh-huh,” he says, and he sounds a little dazed. Tony can’t tell if it’s because he’s coming down from an anxious spiral or because he’s talking to Captain America. Probably both, because Peter.
“Good,” Tony says suddenly, and means it. “Because that lab? Yours. Always has been. It’ll still be there tomorrow, and the next day. At least until some baddie inevitably destroys that part of the compound, but there will always be
“Long as no one tweeted about our plans,” Clint says, arms crossed as he slouches in his chair (Tony would be almost offended if he didn’t remember the posture from the SHIELD days), “I think we’re probably fine.”
“Come on,” Rhodey says, but then Dum-E’s wheels are screaming in his excitement to see Uncle Rhodey, who he definitely likes more than Tony, and they’re held up for another ten minutes.
Tony’s up close and personal with one of the bots—he's found that his repulsors can at least reliably weaken the joints if the shot is point-blank—when he’s suddenly being blown back, down, and into the ground. As he stands from the crater he’s apparently made, he looks up to see another explode in the sky, and he understands.
“So it’s a way to prove ourselves,” Vision suggests, and gods help him, Tony knows he thinks he’s helping, that he’s offering a way to frame it less as Tony-thinks-we’re-batshit-and-need-psychoanalyzing and more this-is-something-we-have-to-do-for-everyone-else’s-sakes.
Bucky's considers his mug, and Tony can see the thought process play out on his face. He spins a pizza crust idly and watches as Bucky brings the mug to his lips, knowing full well that it’s still much too hot to drink. Bucky commits, though; he slurps obnoxiously, and continues breathing in air after he pulls the coffee away, trying to cool the liquid as it burns his tongue, and Tony laughs at him, silently. It’s quiet again, then, and at least Tony knows better than to drink his coffee for another couple minutes. They both sit there, and he doesn’t know what else to say that would keep things as peaceful as they are, so he eats the crust even though he doesn’t want it. Eventually he swaps his plate for his mug and thinks, to hell with it.
Tony doesn’t want to fight. Nobody alive would take him seriously if he said so, but this is the thing:
“Christ,” Rhodey says. “Yeah, hi. Tony made me new legs.” He breaks off, laughs harshly. “So I’m doing much better.”
Tony happens to glance at the clock right around the time when Steve would normally pop his head into the office, already looking like a kicked puppy, to let Tony know there’s food and that he’s welcome to eat with the rest of the team, really, they want him there.
“—fine!” Tony shouted. Steve smiled wide.
Steve comes around once on the ride to the hospital—which, in reality, isn’t far away at all, but they can only go so fast over the hills of the park, picking their way through the trees and trails. One of the medics motions Tony forward and he finds himself going easily, grabbing onto Steve’s hand.
“What are you—”
. “What can I do to help you?”
Twenty minutes later, the phone buzzes under his leg. Tony’s mature enough to admit that Steve was probably in a meeting or the gym, but the thought of him pulling a petty move like “can’t reply right away, gotta wait so Tony doesn’t get the satisfaction” is highly, highly amusing.
“Course. It’s about time for you to meet everyone out of combat, don’t you think? I do.” He pauses, nods to himself. “It’s decided. Happy’ll be in touch, let him know the next weekend you have free.”
“Neither is this conversation,” Tony says. “Look, Rogers—I’m tired, you’re tired. Let’s, I dunno. Rest.”
“It’s a little early,” Steve tries.
It sounds like he’s in pain, a whimper-grunt through gritted teeth, and Tony’s sure he’s never heard something so sad from Steve before. There’s a moment of blind panic where Tony’s sleep-addled brain is convinced that his presence in Steve’s bed is somehow causing physical harm to the man. It takes the jolt of adrenaline springing through his blood and waking him up before the simple reality of the situation hits him: Steve’s having a nightmare.
“I’ve been going through performance reports and background checks for psychologists for hours,” Steve says by way of explanation.
“If that’s an option, then fine,” Natasha says. “If it’s a question of vomiting and dry heaving, you might be better off with something to give up. Just saying.”
this self-sabotage thing where he just forgets about some of his teammates. He sees Bucky shift his weight out of the corner of his eye.
Natasha’s voice rings in his ears.
Tony settled next to Steve, hips against the counter behind him so they were both facing the same way, watching the closed refrigerator as Tony started to eat, all while beating down the feeling of wrongness at having shown vulnerability to Steve, to Rogers, to this guy he swore he wouldn’t let beneath his armor ever again.
Tony releases a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding.
There’s a joke about
“And to be entirely honest with you?” Rhodey says, ignoring Tony entirely in a way that makes Tony smile into his phone. “I’m pretty sure that if I tried to kick Steve’s ass you’d just end up kicking mine. Then I’d have to kick your ass, and that’s just embarrassing for everyone involved.”
“Hey, Rogers!” Tony reaches out and catches Steve’s arm. It’s not enough force to stop a super-soldier, but thankfully Steve stops anyway.
And Tony has to roll his eyes.
Bucky nods, thoughtful and hesitant but relenting, and Tony’s grateful for him.
“I’m not sure I am entirely on board with the notion of moving Barnes while he’s unaware,” he admits. His face on the video feed doesn’t look tired, but Tony thinks the king is radiating the kind of long-suffering exhaustion that Tony uniquely inspires.
“Goodnight,” Vision says kindly, and Tony listens to the retreating footsteps.
smirking?—that stills something in Tony. It makes him intrigued, genuinely curious and eager enough to see how Steve wants to play this out. When Steve reaches the chair Tony’s sitting in, he braces one hand on the arm, reaches with the other to cradle the back of Tony’s head, and leans in. Tony puts the tablet down to rest both of his hands on Steve’s chest, the swell of his pecs, a question in the movements:
“Said the super spy,” Tony says.
“I do,” Tony says. “Guess we’ll just have to let it.”
“That’s not—” Steve says, but then Natasha’s stepping between them, and then her eyes are widening and she’s falling.
“Well, if you’re sure.” To Tony’s relief, Steve sounds lighter, amused. Maybe it’s a little forced, but Tony doesn’t even give a shit. Forced ease is better than panic as far as he’s concerned.
under Tony’s hands in that first kiss.
The lights come up and Steve’s there, in the workshop, about four meters away, and it’s still too close. Tony isn’t afraid of the man, but he hates the distance between them now. He closes his eyes.
The notes for the meeting are mostly just a bullet point list of things they need to address. It looks a little something like this:
“Okay,” Steve says. He glances over at Tony like he wants to say something, but changes his mind. Tony lets it go and rolls his window down a crack. Wind roars through the car and stirs up the air. Steve glances over again, then looks back at the road quickly, which is frustrating because Tony knows the man doesn’t even need to look at the road to drive this stretch safely, and he wishes Steve would simultaneously drop it and spit it out.
Rhodey says and, yeah, Tony really should’ve seen that one coming. “Aw, man. You always did go for the assholes.”
(He’s still going to look over the London deal later, though. See what he can do for them.)
“Tony?” Steve asks hesitantly.
Bucky doesn’t say anything, just stands very, very still. Natasha sighs. He thinks Sam might’ve fallen asleep. Steve steps forwards, aware that his voice is raised, angry, even though he doesn’t want to start a fight right now, not with Rhodey of all people.
“Everyone seems to be having a genuinely good time," Steve says, a little unsure or defensive or—something.
“Nah,” he says. “What do y’think? AVALON Alpha-4?”
“Just your face.”
“She’s a big girl.”
“I’m pretty sure it’s ‘down here,’ rubber duckie, Malibu’s much farther south than New York.” Tony shoves an entire piece of bacon into his mouth and talks around it, says, “Besides, I eat. Food is food even when it’s not a hot meal, it just doesn’t taste as good.”
“Afraid of what?” Steve asks.
Steve laughs, which leads to a cough, which makes him try to curl in on himself. Steve’s head knocks into Tony’s helmet and, despite himself, Tony snickers.
to escape the reality of fighting all around him. He narrowed his field of vision down to the circuits in front of his face and distracted himself with beautiful people and beautiful things and beautiful code and substances that make all of those beautiful things downright heavenly. He did this for years, and only allowed Pepper and Obie to pull his attention away for as long as it took to find the answer to the problem he was given, and not a second more.
“We couldn’t find Richards,” Natasha says as she sets the ‘jet down. “Bruce and Vision are trying to figure out where their commands are coming from.”
“Do you want some music?” Steve asks, already reaching for the radio. Tony reaches out and catches his wrist. Steve blinks at the road, but puts his hand back on the steering wheel when Tony lets go.
Tony takes a deep breath, spins his swivel chair in a circle.
Nat rolls her eyes at that, but she stays perched on the arm of Bucky’s couch until her tea’s gone and she knows all the housewives by name. She doesn’t make any comment about Tony and Bucky watching bad TV together in the dead of night, which Tony’s grateful for, and she leaves between episodes to go back to bed or at least retreat to her room.
“At first I really just felt…cheated. We were finally going to try and talk things out, so of course the universe would drag us over the coals when we’re finally close to getting on the same page.”
“No, by all means,” Clint says. “Take a hit from the bots, or I think you might get a jawful of vibranium.”
Pepper relaxes her stance, her shoulders drop. Steve thinks she’s going to concede the point for all of two seconds.
“Some things more than others, but yeah. We’ve done some kinda damage, believe it or not.”
“But?” Steve says.
“Keep them safe,” he says, and a wave of fire drags him under.
—as his fingers slide up to trace Steve’s collarbones.
“Coffee?” Tony asks, already aimed that way.
“Call me Steve.”
“Oh, please,” Steve says, and he’s definitely pouting when he bats at Tony’s hand. “Like you could make the shot any better.”
“Thanks, Tony.”
Honestly, Tony’s of the opinion that thirty percent is rather high, but FRIDAY had thought that even forty percent (where they’d set it previously) was too low. He doesn’t know, really, there aren’t social norms that dictate how high a chance of success you should have before your AI has permission to drag around your corpse as a posable doll (at least, not the kind of social norms you can google).
“Others are on their way back,” Sam says sleepily from his chair-bed. “Clint’s in surgery.”
“Yeah—that!” Scott says, snapping his fingers. “Should we all really be in the same room?”
“Hawkeye,” Natasha says, and she sounds out of breath but sharp.
“Hey, Steve,” Tony says, and feels only a little like an idiot. Sam’s straightened up to talk to Clint, and somehow Tony doesn’t feel like Thor will judge him for this. “Med’s on their way. You’re gonna be fine.”
“Shall I start the list off with ‘intentionally causing bodily harm to self’?” FRIDAY says.
“Come on,” Steve says again, eyes half open, voice kind but low. His breath feels so very heated where it brushes Tony’s spit-wet lips.
Thor claps a hand on Tony’s shoulder as he lowers himself into a chair.
“Wanda was—”
. It’s just enough of a shock to make the spark of anger flicker—right into a blaze. Like one of Pavlov’s fucking dogs, he’s hungry and a little anxious. Like clockwork. He raises an eyebrow down at his stomach.
Tony wanted to bash Steve’s teeth in for making his chest ache like this, and he was reminded of why he worked so hard to get pardons for all of these idiots. There was no one he’d rather have at his back, by his side, than Captain America.
Tony wants to stomp down on his flash of irritation, but it just flares even brighter. Of course Steve would take the path of ultimate righteousness, of course he gets to keep his hands clean while Tony loses whatever shred of his humanity is left. Because that’s how Steve’s morals work: black and white, right and wrong, and Steve’s always right, good, fighting on the right side, even if it damns the rest of the world. How dare Tony ask him to get his hands dirty just to keep Tony from killing his teammates, their teammates.
When Steve and Tony had sat on the couch, it wasn’t one person comforting the other; it didn’t feel like giving anything up or taking anything away. It was breathing and understanding each other, and living despite the violence they’ve committed, and allowing themselves to live, and to be comforted and, more impossibly, to comfort. Tony doesn’t think he’s ever felt that before. He wonders if that’s the definition of love, or if he’s just really fucked up. He remembers seeing Steve tormenting himself for things that happened, and he remembers knowing that feeling exactly, but he also remembers knowing that Steve’s a good person, a person who’s fought and been fought against, who everyone expects to keep fighting and to figure it out, because he’s Captain America, that’s what he does. He remembers how young and vulnerable Steve looked in the kitchen, and how Steve drove him all the way home.
He spends a stupid amount of time trying to reason with himself.
“Yeah, well.” Tony holds his mug close to his chest. It’s too hot to drink, but he breathes in deep to ground himself in the familiar smell. “I do. I mind it.” Tony thinks he should sound more bitter, but he doesn’t have the energy for it yet today. “Here’s the compromise: no more broken bones and let’s keep it off national news.”
“I’m not quite sure I want to know how it went,” Tony says faintly. He can hear it this time, how Steve takes a deep breath before speaking.
“Would you just
Tony busts in through a wall on the third floor after a scan reveals no lifeforms on that level and he flies down the stairwell. It doesn’t take him long to find Wanda, in what looks like a destroyed office, red energy holding the
After he has a bag full of toiletries and clothes, there’s still a couple hours to kill, so he sets out for the kitchen. Thankfully, it’s a little later than he’s usually up, and everyone seems to have been through for breakfast already. The coffee pot is even empty. He takes a breath so deep it reaches the bottom of his lungs for once and goes about making his own.
“We’re right here, Tony,” he says, raising his voice and angling his head so that the words have to be loud enough to reach Tony. And then Steve moves around to help pull Clint to his feet because he seems to be struggling. He’ll have someone check Clint over on the ’jet, he decides, and wraps Clint’s arm around his own shoulders to lead him out of the alley. The EMTs are strapping Tony down behind them, and they’ll need to follow an Avenger to know where to go to get Tony on board. Steve doesn’t want them taking any more time than they have to.
“Okay,” Sam says as the door slides shut, “but you still look like a jackass!”
“Sam’s not up yet?” Tony says. He tosses the tablet and the USB on the table and walks past it to dump the dishes in the sink and grab a cup of coffee.
“Your heart’s racing,” Bruce says lowly, eyes flickering to the wall clock. He pulls a face.
Tony sweeps his thumb back and forth over her spine and she shudders.
He hears the next people coming long before they get to the kitchen—two of them, he thinks. But he’s neck deep in setting up wireless tripwires for Ross and his minions, and he doesn’t look up until the room grows deathly still and quiet. Tony looks up and sees Clint, head still tilted down toward his phone, but eyes raised and resting on something beyond Tony’s shoulder. Tony turns around, and—oh.
Wanda’s terrifyingly powerful and also out of control. Tony’s opinion is that she’s not equipped emotionally to be on this team, but he knows that’s a fight he can’t win. There aren’t many fights he can seem to win lately (against the Avengers, that is; he can win fights against Ross and the UN and the entirety of the United States, but the Avengers are a different story). He can foresee the defenses, or at least some of them; she’s part of this team too, Tony; she doesn’t have anywhere else to go, Tony; if she’s not on the team they’ll try to hold her responsible for Lagos, Tony; you killed her parents, Tony, she didn’t mean it. Each and every one punctuated by a disappointed sigh, all in Rogers’ impatient voice or snapped out in Barton’s, sharp as ice.
“We’ll take it slow,” Tony promises him. “We’ll figure out what’s best.”
Just as vague, just as unspecific, as Steve always seems in his rallying speeches. Blind hope and drive, the need to dive in.
Tony’s throat feels stuck when he opens his mouth. He can almost hear the ghosts of Obie telling him to buck up, Dad’s audible glare stuck over smiling teeth. He even imagines Pepper’s terse smile, though that one’s probably nonsensical.
“Just hold on,” Tony says. He feels strangely calm. Steve's the one that needs to stay calm, though. It’s got to be hard for him to breathe with all the debris billowing around them, through the space in between them. Tony has filters in his suit for this, all Steve has between him and the rubble is Tony’s armored body, which is hardly airtight.
Steve grins.
“Yes,” Steve says immediately. It resounds through the phone and Tony swears under his breath, says a couple of unsavory (unfair) things.
“I’m saying,” he says, exhales, “that there’s letting her help clean up what was partly her mess and instantly instating her as an Avenger.”
It’s a pleasant, productive kind of solitary, with the life of the city humming all around him, and he takes the opportunity to pause and think. About what he wants from the team this time around, about what he might want from this thing he can feel between himself and Steve.
He thinks of Obie pouring him a nightcap and patting him on the shoulder when he’d get too wound up, eyes dilated with inspiration or coke or mania; he was never one to hover, but he’d laugh as he left, a warm sound Tony used to think of as fond, usually with a comment about how he had to
“And so far only simulations,” Vision says, “but even so, we seem to crash an awful lot.”
He hopes that’s what it means. He needs it to mean that, at this point.
It’s quiet for a few long moments. The crickets’ chirping is audible even all the way from the compound’s roof.
to wake himself up.
Tony gags then and his entire spine heaves him upwards. He gags again and Steve uses the hand in Tony’s hair to shove his head to the side just in time for him to not choke on his own vomit. The puke splashes onto the pavement and onto the thigh of Steve’s uniform. His heart clenches and he kneads the back of Tony’s neck until it looks like he’s done, and then settles him back against the wall again. Tony resumes his pained gasping.
but he knows enough to shut up and let the medics work.
“He’ll be fine,” Clint says lowly, finally letting go of Tony’s shoulder. “Asshole’s got a harder head than the rest of us put together.”
“Here I am,” Tony agrees. Steve’s already in casual clothes, out of the sweats he wears for his morning workouts. He’s smiling too, so Tony smiles back in the hazy, honest way he can before he’s caffeinated. These are the easiest times between them since Steve’s come back, Tony’s found, when it’s too late or too early, and reality’s warped.
rota?”
Reassurance, showing interest—positive reinforcement.
Tony had asked, because that’s what Mom gave him when he was so awake it kept her up too.
“It’ll heal,” he tells her.
“Not all of us were here when you fell to pieces, Cap,” Bruce says. It’s still cool and cutting, matter-of-fact.
a longer chapter finally! i meant to get this up last night but instead i slept for about 13 hours after being awake for 32, so whatever.
And then the air’s knocked out of him; his head whips to the side and he’s sent flying toward the ground hard enough to crack the asphalt. Eyes open, he raises his hands defensively, and the fight’s back on.
“Neither is the—Gi-Ant Man,” Tony says, waving his hand at the horrendous wordplay. “You both get absolutely knackered after being all big and mighty—which, actually, do you get fatigued after shrinking down, too?”
“Nat, have I ever told you how much I adore you?” Tony asks.
“So where exactly does ’Tasha keep her phone when she’s wearing those dresses?” Tony says. “She always seems to have it, even when there’s no room for underwear in there.”
“Hey,” Steve says. He smiles back belatedly. “Tony, hi. What’s up?”
“I don’t need help anymore than you do,” Steve says.
Natasha and Bruce are huddled at the edge of the main street and Steve pauses, takes Clint’s hand from his shoulders, leans him against a wall, and dry heaves over the ground a few feet away. Nothing comes up, so when he decides he’s done he gathers Clint back up and goes to meet them. Someone’s given Bruce a shock blanket and some pants, but he’s barefoot and shirtless. Natasha’s watching them closely, and then looking behind them.
Steve turns back and lets Bucky tow him off.
“To the ’shop?” FRIDAY asks.
He goes through The Routine, puts on some clean jeans and a couple t-shirts (purposefully leaving the tinted HUD glasses behind, knowing they can come off as defensive just like regular sunglasses), and, before he can talk himself out of it, walks down the hall to Steve’s room. It’s not until after he knocks that he realizes Steve’s probably not just sitting in his room, but the door swings open to reveal Steve in dark jeans and a dark gray shirt with three-quarter sleeves, a style that looks unfairly good on him and one that Tony’s sure Wanda introduced him to. Steve’s sense of style increased by roughly 70% when she joined the team, though she still can’t convince him to accessorize, much to Natasha’s amusement. Tony grins wide, and Steve blinks at him.
It occurs to Tony that Steve could probably snap him like a twig caught up in his own mind like this. He remembers Pepper’s hand on his shoulder, the insistent shaking, the terror of reliving the worst moments of his life melting into the reality of almost hurting her, of calling the suit on her in his sleep. So, okay, he probably shouldn’t shake Steve. Maybe. Steve’s nightmares are probably different than his own, but that doesn’t really give Tony a clue as to how to stop this. But this really, really needs to be stopped.
(Steve does, is the crazy thing. He holds perfectly still and watches while Tony moves decidedly into his bubble and squint-stares at both of his eyes in turn.)
He waits a beat, but Steve just stares at the floor, man-out-of-time style, sad and lost. Tony steps around in front of him, still not touching, but close enough that he’s in Steve’s line of sight and, sure enough, Steve looks up to meet his eyes, jaw clenched.
They’re sitting pressed up against each other on the couch by this point and it’s all comfort and safety and a heavy tiredness and Tony’s so grateful that Rhodey’s still here, even at the price of his functioning legs, and he hates himself for thinking so. He can’t help but compare the feeling to sitting next to Steve on the couch back at the compound. They were pressed together similarly, but that had felt revolutionary, somehow, reckless and inevitable and like finally coming home.
“I do not want to have this fight right now,” Tony says.
They’ve done a pretty good job of keeping up with the new ones, but at some point they started showing up five at a time instead of two, so it’s still going to take them a while.
Clint fires off a shot from the sky, and Wanda comes flying down of her own power, Redwing and Sam hot on her heels, and Thor waits for them to be clear before falling mightily from the sky and scorching the ground with lightning. They’re up to 35 bots if Tony had to guess, something he failed to mention over the comm.
Tony grins. “You’re not wrong.”
“Okay,” Tony says, “I was kind of an asshole when he came to my home unannounced and acted like I was the one being unreasonable but to be fair he came to my home unannounced and acted like I was the one being unreasonable.”
Now, Tony doesn’t make a habit of using words like
“I fell asleep,” Tony explains, but that doesn’t wipe the look from Steve’s face. “It’s not deep,” he tries next, because it’s really not. He’s not sitting down here bleeding out, it doesn’t even need stitches.
“Hey, kid.”
This isn’t a fix of any kind between him and Bruce, but it loosens something in Tony’s chest when Bruce’s knee bumps into his own leg as he swivels closer to get a better look. It’s evidence that Bruce is willing to talk to him, to give him a chance.
“It's been days of basically no news about you, man,” Sam says. “It’s better to know nothing’s changed than to just sit around.”
It hammers home the reality Steve’s living in more than his waking words or gestures probably ever could. Even confused and afraid and tense and not-entirely-aware, Steve had quieted instantly as he woke and took in Tony’s reassurance.
By the time Tony’s done with that, there’s half of a pot of coffee, and he snags a quick mugful before replacing the carafe. He slides the mug to Steve, so it sits right in front of his nose, and notes the surprise on Steve’s face as he moves back to stand in front of his collected pile of food with his hands on his hips.
He accepts the call. The last thing he needs is a rescue party showing up on his front lawn.
“He is with me,” T’Challa says from the other screen. “He remains in cryogenic stasis in my facilities and under my guard. Though I’m inclined to agree with Mr. Stark, and we shall speak more on the matter later.”
“Just a little longer, right?” he says to them. He’s fighting a losing battle, and not against the Brood. No matter how hard he tries, he’s losing consciousness. Probably more than consciousness. Steve looks like he wants to cry. Wanda’s stepped away from them and is holding more Brood off while they have their moment.
“Like the ones the Triskellion used to have, for breaking in some of the larger teams.”
Tony shrugs, motioning to Bucky, who’s finally close enough to have caught sight of the prosthetic waiting on the table for him. He lets Bucky approach the table and intercepts DUM-E before he can follow, quietly poking the bot's support struts and smiling to himself, comforted more than he'd like to admit as DUM-E forgets their guest in lieu of trying to predict Tony's next “attack." Of course, true randomness doesn't exist (or, at the very least, it doesn't stem from the human mind), but it's close enough to thoroughly stump the robot.
of us did to ensure the Avengers still existed, for everyone else here to even have the choice to be on the team or not.”
“Okay,” Tony said, “I know, but I’m in the middle of this—”
“It’ll probably save the entire world oodles of crap,” Tony says. “But—yeah. Part of eligibility for active membership should be respect for—or at least a tolerance of, I’m not that picky—all teammates. I don’t know exactly how we’re going to judge that, and doctor-patient confidentiality is still a thing, but we’ll hash something out and see how it works.”
“Steve?”
Since I woke up with Extremis, I haven’t slept at all, I haven’t even been tired.”
“You can’t—“ Steve starts to say, and Tony is done.
The legal team is, admittedly, all on Tony’s payroll, and he does have the most experience in that department, but Tony agrees when Steve says they should all be kept up-to-date on such matters. They all have a tendency to react rather with more volatility to surprises than most other people, hence the exceptional display of fight-or-flight reaction invoked by Secretary Ross’s appearance at the compound.
“I don’t know if it’s ridiculous or impressive,” she says.
The doctor comes back eventually, when Tony’s head is buzzing and his skin is full of static. He stands aside as the doctor rouses Steve, who knows his own name, what year it is (after a flash of panic that has Tony stepping forward into plain view), though not exactly where he is.
do you not understand?”
“So we appear to be having a meeting full of friendly advice,” he says mildly.
Scott comes back and they clink the necks of their bottles together. The bubbles hit Tony’s mouth like it was yesterday. Familiar, nice. The taste might be a little stronger, but that might be his new tastebuds.
“Now and again,” Tony says, because that’s true. He thought of it often enough. “I’m glad I didn’t though. It would’ve been just to rant and rave about why I was right.”
“Hey,” Tony says, standing and taking the cup offered to him.
Unmoored and unsure, Tony reaches up and grabs onto Steve’s hand with both of his own.
tell them and he’s actually trying to give Tony a heart attack. Clint laughs, even as he clings to Tony’s side, and Tony could drop him right now, it would be so easy.
“How’s our little band of misfits doing?” he asks, going for chipper. Thankfully, FRIDAY’s never known him as anything other than a glorified hot mess, so she rolls with it.
T’Challa sighs, and Tony silently agrees.
“You too, Tony,” Steve calls as he strolls into the elevator. “Get some sleep.”
“Then what, pray tell, do you mean?” he asks.
“Not you too,” she says to Tony.
“Yeah.”
Steve’s eyes are so blue, even in the different, dim, unnatural lighting of his office. Not a hint of green.
“We shall continue this conversation another time,” T’Challa says.
“Fair enough,” Bucky says.
want to hear this.
Steve nods, and Tony takes off again.
“No!” Tony says. “I’m not gonna be your self-fulfilling prophecy, Rogers. You want a reason to fuck up the entire team we just brought back together? You can have Barnes back!”
“Most of my teeth are fake,” Clint agrees with a quick grin to show them off. “And most people can’t even tell.”
“They are,” Tony says quickly. “So was I. Just needed a moment to myself, or whatever. Collecting my thoughts.”
“I know you know,” Tony says, exasperated. “You know, I know, Nat knows, apparently Bruce and Pep know. Everyone knows except him. He’s gonna stomp me out without even knowing it.”
He puts down the scissors, drops his towel, and puts on the first clothes he can get his hands on. His brain and the surface of his skin are still buzzing, and he’s distracted enough that he doesn’t even feel the familiar rush of nerves-dread-comfort when he opens his bedroom door to see Steve standing there. He looks tired—exhausted, really—but all evidence of physical wounds has probably healed by now.
“You’re having more than coffee!” Clint calls from his spot at the table.
Belatedly, he realizes he’s been staring at Steve for minutes now, blinking slowly, and Steve’s been returning his gaze. The edge has bled out of the moment, leaving calm regard. Expectation.
on the bright side, i'm starting work on my senior project, so. if any of you would ever be interested in some of my original fiction, that'll be a thing that exists in a few months. so that's pretty exciting
“What’s that?” Sam asks, but his voice is behind Steve, he can wait—oh, shit, what if Tony’s hurt—
“Just me,” Tony calls softly in the direction of the ensuite, pulling the door shut behind him. That door’s open, too, the sounds of the sink and a toothbrush floating out. Tony forgot to brush his own teeth, but it’s too late now. He’s here and he needs to stay here or he really might bolt.
Steve sits there on the exam table, and he nods along with what the doctor says for the entire time he’s speaking. He doesn’t remember having dealt with this doctor before, and that’s good, that’s wonderful actually, because the doctor probably thinks he’s listening or going to take any of his advice. Steve knows how this works. No backflips, sparring, or jumping, and probably no showers until his back fixes itself. Not his first rodeo, after all.
“I don’t know,” Tony says. And then he’s running his mouth, and he doesn’t know he’s going to say it until he’s saying, “Listen? Let me talk and ignore me? Stay the fuck away from me? Be there?”
“Then just come lay down,” Steve says, a smile right there in his voice. Tony looks up then—is he getting laughed at here?—to see Steve looking right at him. He’s still looking when Steve continues, voice pitched low, but the smile kind and open on his face. “I’m sure we can think of something to do.”
“Try again in an hour or two. Barton gets sloppy when he’s buzzed,” he says.
“Okay,” he says. His neck and shoulder pulse with pain. “You’re out.”
Tony makes another cut, a joint higher on his thumb, and then one on the pad.
The real kicker is that he can still hurt over it so much, even if he gets that Steve was just a mess then, that he phrased everything wrong that day—it still hurts like an intentional blow.
“Hey,” Steve says.
Tony blinks.
Tony’s breath does a funny thing on the other end of the line, and Steve wants to cry all over again, but he feels too tired. It’s the quiet resignation of bleeding in front of another human being.
Steve’s lips are soft, and it’s not exactly one continuous kiss, but they bleed into each other enough that Tony can’t keep count. He tastes like pepperoni and onions and it should probably be gross but instead Tony finds it downright delightful—real, his brain screams at him, this has to be real. And he grins into Steve’s mouth, the air spasming in his lungs, not quite a laugh, and Steve huffs underneath him even though he can’t know what’s so funny, and then Tony’s kissing him again, and the kisses aren’t numbered, but they retreat and surge like a goddamn tide. Tony’s hand wandering into Steve’s hair, Steve’s blunt fingernails at his hairline, the tension is his neck when he lifts his head to get closer, to chase Tony.
“Every kind,” Tony says. In that moment Steve looks like he needs a minute to absorb that information despite being the more caffeinated of the two of them, and Tony turns his back and fixes his own cup of coffee. Stirring in sugar, he’s hit with the mental image of a hot tub full of coffee, smelling rich and dark but being sweet to the taste. It’s a stupid detail, not something he thinks is really worth remembering, but it brings with it the memory of being trapped in the locked up suit, hovering over Steve after having tackled him to the ground, being stuck with him.
to me,” Steve says.
Clint, sitting directly to Tony’s left, raises a hand.
“I’m gonna need you to give me a minute here, sweetpea.”
(“You can call me Peter, by the way,” Peter says. “If you want, that is. When we’re like—at the compound, of course. It’s still a—secret, generally speaking. But I figure if Mr. Stark trusts you guys then the least I can tell you is my name. It might be important someday, it usually seems to be eventu—”
He flies straight at Steve, faster than he should, and tackles him. He senses more than feels the cracks coming from Steve’s lower ribs, the way his pelvis angles against his own shoulder. They skid across the ground hard, Steve screaming, the suit screaming, sparks flying. Tony covers Steve’s body with his own and braces himself; the building’s already crashing down on them. Steve’s still holding onto his shield somehow, and he flings it up and around so it’s covering both of their heads. Tony’s collarbone howls at the way his arms are braced, but he just swallows and clenches his teeth against it.
It’s a good thing that heart medication’s obsolete in his current physical state.
“I was thinking maybe we could—one of the training rooms, we could revamp it, make it a simulation room.”
“Uh,” Tony says, and it’s a higher pitch than he strictly means for it to be. “Is that what we would call it?”
“Not thinkin’ of jumping, are ya?”
“So, you said better airport time?” he prompts.
“If you and Steve really fought so hard against one another, if he really hurt you as much as it sounds like he did, and tore you up, and broke the team apart—and you’re still having this freakout?” Bruce pauses to meet Tony’s eyes head-on in a way that’s rare for him. “Then I can personally guarantee the Hulk will beat you into the ground if you let an opportunity for genuine care and happiness slip by.”
“Okay,” Steve says. “We’ll wait for it, and then we’ll fight.”
“It’s—” Tony stops to think.
“That only really went away when SHIELD fell,” he says. “We were just so high on the newfound freedom and afraid of authority we didn’t implement our own structures in its place.”
“Avengers,” he says, “fall in.”
He’s five minutes late getting to Marcel’s, though he still seems to have beaten Pepper there. After surveying the place, he grabs a coffee from the counter and picks the most inconspicuous table in the corner to sit at.
Well, he’d hoped.
And of course there’s an IV in the crook of his arm; Tony doesn’t know why he didn’t place that with the tingling not-numbness earlier. Not today, Satan.
Steve’s lying, twisted, legs mostly out straight, but torso slumped to the side in a way that looks like it should be uncomfortable. He’s out cold, his face ultra-calm in a way that speaks of oblivion. For a blinding, stomach-turning moment, Tony sees the War Machine armor, Rhodey’s blank face still in the helmet.
“Were there really that many robot parts to round up?”
“It was a bad situation,” Tony says halfheartedly. It’s a shitty defense.
“That’s not—”
And Natasha, because she’s still Natasha, doesn’t knock. Despite never having been here before and a complete lack of access to the blueprints, she just waltzes on into his house. He wants to blame FRIDAY, but seeing as he’s been dragging his feet in inviting his girl in, it’s pretty impossible for her to have unlocked the doors.
“Delete them.”
Tony hums again.
is, once again, the most fantastic beta in the world.
“1932 Ford Flathead Roadster,” he says.
Steve’s mouth flattens out again as he purses his lips.
“Injected himself with Extremis,” Steve says. The rolling, flailing energy seems to have left Tony after vomiting. He’s slumped against the wall now, eyes half open, moaning so quietly on the exhale.
Tony stays for the next few hours. Bruce explains his current experiments—all seven of them, dear God—and Tony alternates between conducive brainstorming and being an absolute nuisance to the very idea of science. Bruce tolerates it for a surprisingly long time, which is more of a testament to how he feels about Tony’s decisions of late than any conversation ever could be.
“Good,” Rhodey says, and hangs up, because he’s the worst best friend in the entire world.
The sun is setting over…Kansas? The sun is setting over Kansas as Tony flies east, and it’s going to be dark in Illinois by the time they start the battle. Battles take either half the time or triple the time in the dark. Tony knows this, and Steve knows this, and Tony knows Steve knows this, and Steve knows that Tony knows that Steve knows this.
“Hey,” he says, “I’m fine.”
Clint’s head drops onto the counter and he mumbles something Tony can’t hear.
“Everything okay over there?”
“So,” Pepper says a couple minutes into the walk. “You and Steve, huh?”
"No, I
“—you’ll want to call for med-evac,” she says. “Ideally to the compound.”
doing the whole waiting-and-seeing thing.”
He finally gets his feet to move, then, to take him forward that last bit of space so he can fall at Tony’s side. His hands float over Tony’s body, looking for injuries. One of his arms is soaked with blood, and he’s holding it all wrong at the shoulder, too. The t-shirt he’s wearing is too baggy to see anything underneath, so Steve moves on. There’s a tear in his jeans at his hip, where the skin beneath is swelling and discolored. There’s a clear puncture mark, the edges of which are flaking away like mica.
“Do we have a current phone number for Reed Richards?” he asks.
About halfway through his first pizza, his phone chimes. He’s sprawled across a stylish but still somehow comfortable couch in a classic draw-me-like-one-of-your-French-girls pose, and his shoes have been thrown to the other side of the room. In short, he is living and doesn’t want to look at the message, but he stuffs the last half of his current slice into his mouth and goes to dig his phone out of his pocket because he’s not actually the piece of shit people think he is.
“But you haven’t—”
“I love you,” Pepper says when they’re standing outside the SI offices. “You’re family, whether we’re together or not. I just wish you’d stop leaving for months at a time. I miss you too, you know.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Barton.” Tony raises an eyebrow at the hurt look he gets in response. Once upon a time he would’ve said “birdbrain” or “Legolas” or something witty. God, he’s tired.
“I wish,” he says.
hellO! i know it's been forever (again) but listen: i quit my job, broke up w/ my SO, moved halfway across the country, and got a new job since i last updated this fic. finally settling in, thank the gods.
“Yep,” Tony says, and Bruce barely bothers to open his eyes as he takes the first few stumbling steps following. Tony keeps his arm around the man’s shoulders because, Jesus, he’s going to faceplant if Tony lets go.
“Tony injected himself with a dose,” Steve says. “It’s—hard to explain. There's a file I can get you, though. I think it’s the only thing keeping him alive.”
so, how 'bout endgame, huh (lol)
Tony almost wants to argue that he’s a heavy hitter here, alright, he doesn’t need to be in the outfield, but he also figures he did most of the legwork before they showed up so he can take a least a minute.
Overall, Tony’s content, enough that it feels dangerous, and he can feel a faint thrum of adrenaline in his fingertips at the implications even though that’s downright antithetical to the whole tranquility thing.
“Yeah,” Tony says, and it’s only a half-lie. “There are things that can be done, of course. I’m not a squishy-parts doctor, much less a psychologist, but there’s—therapy, and maybe even the BARF tech if we’re careful about it. And I’ve got a couple ideas floating around for the arm already—”
“Hey, old man.” Tony sounds subdued, but like he might be smiling. “Forget your inhaler again?”
“Dude,” Rhodey says. “He was in the Army. In the 40s. And technically he’s part of the generation that raised the Baby Boomers.”
Tony googles “tony stark news” and it’s right there, third option down:
More importantly, he needs to know. If he can, what it takes to get even an hour or two of shuteye.
He blinks, and Bucky shifts so that his shoulders are at an angle to Tony, and to the doorway, instead of square to the front. Tony blinks again, and then looks back down at his list. He adds
“I’m working on it,” Tony says, because he will be at least. He can figure this out. If nothing else, they’re finally in the position to bargain for Barnes’ freedom. Sure, they might have to negotiate on some of the points they agreed on for the amendments, but Tony thinks they can probably get everything eventually.
“They did a debrief already, but you’ll probably have to fill out a report or talk to the rep.”
He looks at her, wants to believe she’s here as a friend, another olive branch, and not as the glorified babysitter who drew the short straw. Finally, he nods, accepting it at face value. Either way, it would be good to acclimatize himself to people again probably. Like when you win a goldfish at the carnival and have to put it in a fishbowl gradually unless you want it to go into shock and die. Tony’s not exactly sure when he became the goldfish in his own simile, but he’s not a huge fan of it.
A laugh catches Steve so off-guard it comes out as a snort and his hand flies up to his face (Tony guesses he’s making sure he didn’t just spray snot everywhere). He lowers his hand a couple cautious seconds later, smirking.
Tony swallows three times in quick succession to keep the bile down, and Steve smiles at him in open gratitude. Tony smiles back in what he hopes translates to solidarity-slash-amusement.
So, first task: observation.
There’s the prick of a needle, four of them, and Tony grits his teeth. Ideally, there would be a dozen or more needles; it would be safer that way, to spread the dose out through his body, but Tony never knows how much damage the suit will take or which parts will get knocked out of commission. (Also, Tony dislikes needles, so sue him.) They hold for a moment, and then retreat.
take me literally, Clinton, I know your number.”
“I’m running low here, guys,” Clint says. “The explosive arrows were the only ones doing any good and I’m just about out.”
“You haven’t slept yet,” Steve guesses, looking unimpressed.
“Of course you were,” Natasha mutters. Steve concurs.
“By ‘man’ and ‘horse’ I obviously meant ‘boy’ and ‘arachnid,’” Tony says, and Steve snorts.
“Dr. Stark,” T’Challa returns and Tony half chokes on his slice. Natasha pounds him on the back and T’Challa looks bemused.
“The point of this,” Steve says gently, “is not to make anyone feel unsafe. If there are concerns, we are happy to help. We’ll find solutions for everyone.”
Vision and Wanda have moved on to evacuation, methodically making the rounds through the surrounding buildings. Natasha’s rejoined the guys on the ground, and she’s  being tight-lipped about the injured woman. Nobody asks a second time.
The elevator car vibrated slightly around them, just the hum of machinery. Nothing, really. It had maybe been too long since Tony last slept, and he was on edge. Too many deadlines, too much pressure, too much everything. He felt raw and exposed, like an eyeball without a lid. The ding as they reached the common floor was grating, and Tony sucked in a slightly desperate breath before he had to step into the living room.
Most everyone—besides Steve, Natasha, and Clint—look down at the tablets in front of them, and Tony assumes FRIDAY’s brought up the relevant information. Bruce even slips on his reading glasses. Bucky looks up after scanning the list, arms crossed over his chest in a way Tony thinks is supposed to be nonchalant.
The armor peels away and starts flitting around, gathering bits of circuitry from the grass. His heart’s hammering when he turns back to Steve, whose condition hasn’t changed in the slightest. Thor meets his eye from where he’s kneeling by Steve’s head, murmuring what sound like reassurances. Tony reaches out and puts a gentle hand on Steve’s ankle, using so little pressure Steve wouldn’t be able to feel it through the Kevlar even if he were awake.
“Wanda,” he says as soon as he can.
Steve actually
“Vic?” he calls to the bots.
Tony grins and comes to stand at Peter’s other side, opposite Steve.
“Goodnight!” Steve calls after them, to which Bruce mumbles some very unkind and downright obscene words into Tony’s shoulder. Tony laughs a laugh that is pure delight. Just as Tony calls the elevator, Sam comes out of the stairwell off to the side, takes one look at them standing there, and grins.
What Howard never told him (though, perhaps he hadn’t known, or it was different for him) was the paralytic effects of anxiety, the spiraling thoughts leading nowhere but brain gridlock. At MIT, there were weeks at a time where Tony would skip class and wander campus like a ghost, oscillating between obsessively thinking about things beyond his control and altering his brain chemistry beyond the ability to obsess. He’d come back to himself one day, one hour, one minute, having picked up a tool, or idly turning over ideas get through a homework assignment he’d left lying out, or with someone else’s walkman deconstructed and laid out on a coffee table that wasn’t in his dorm, and he’d begin the arduous task of working his way back to himself.
But he’d been doing well on the surface at least. He told himself that if he could just act like it was a normal day on the outside then it would have to be just that—normal, ordinary, like all the other days he and Sam have spent galavanting across the world for the better part of a year now, taking down Hydra bases when they find them, busting drug and human trafficking rings. And now it’s not normal, now it’s really Steve’s birthday and he and Sam are hiding out in a shack in France, a safe house left over from the SHIELD days. Wanda’s still in Wakanda, and Steve doesn’t blame her for being tired of running, wanting time and space to process her grief. Scott and Clint both snuck back into the States to be with their families.
“No can do, Stark,” Steve says. “We should be done with this by tomorrow. We can even fly back to New York together.”
“He’s not here,” Sam says, glancing at Steve, probably to make sure he’s not going to bolt or punch someone (Tony) in the face. Tony thinks it would be a nice gesture if he thought Sam was looking to protect his teammate from physical harm, but Tony’s pretty sure Sam just doesn’t want Steve to get in trouble right away.
Mrs. Young nods at the king.
“Who even would that be?” Tony asks. “Sam, Rhodey, Vision, Wanda…Scott? They’re all staying.”
A few seconds later and Natasha’s barrelling down the ramp at a full tilt sprint, launching herself at a bot with her Widow’s Bites already crackling to life, taking it down in a complicated flip. The things are durable, but she moves so quickly and efficiently that it doesn’t take her that long to incapacitate, all things considered.
Come back, Tony thinks. And then the burning reaches the top of his head, his brain, and he knows nothing else.
“I miss you,” he says suddenly, and, by God, how he means it. “And I’m sorry. Whatever’s been happening, I’m the one who’s been absent. I’ll fix it.”
that he can’t say anything for a few seconds. The words are designed to hurt, and it would be satisfying, making Steve feel just a modicum of the terrible injury Tony himself had been left to fester in, but they’ve made progress and it wouldn’t be right. Tony reminds himself fiercely that it would feel good for only a fraction of a second, and only build the momentum of the verbal battle.
“—and I spoke with Vision,” Steve cuts in, louder and with
“It feels like a third chance,” he admits. “Or—whatever number I’m on now.” He laughs, a quiet huff of self-deprecation.
Tony thinks.
“He, um. There was someone at school and she, uh, she saw a YouTube video from Chicago, and she was saying—well she was just, she was so sure you were dead, Mr. Stark, and I just—”
“Captain Rogers,” T’Challa says through the comm, “I suggest you take your injured to safety. I can transport the rest to the Avengers compound when this task is complete.”
“Oh, my God,” he says, “is that drool? Jesus, all over the couch!”
“Look—“ Clint starts.
Tony would be grateful if he were present. He’s relying mostly on FRIDAY to record Bucky’s answers and to inform him later of what really needs to be adjusted or fixed. Most of Tony’s attention is thinking about Mom, about Siberia, about how goddamn angry he’d been at Howard for years when he thought it was all his fault, about Steve lying, about Steve’s face when he’d been caught in the lie in that bunker, about every effort Tony made being thrown back in his face, about Steve’s knees pressed to either side of his ribcage, about Steve’s shield looming, coming closer, about how much Tony hated himself for flinching, for covering his face.
It quells the hurt enough that he can imagine Rhodey being right, or at least not entirely looney.
“Oh, God,” Tony sighs. “No, not you, I was not addressing you, you giant fool.”
Still—he doesn’t actually move to stop Sam. He might say something sharp, but he won’t be cruel. (Baby steps.)
“Fantastic,” Tony says, hands splayed before him (because it’s more effective when he uses both his words and his body language, including tone, when telling a kid they’ve done something right). “Way to study.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah,” Bucky says, like he caught all that. He purses his lips. “One thing at a time. Let’s get someone to look at your back.”
Steve meets Bucky’s eyes and he understands, with a startling intimacy, what Rhodey means.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m right here,” Tony tells him, “but the paramedics have to take a look at you for a sec.”
“Last official point of business,” Tony says and, sadly, people start to rouse themselves.
Tony smiles up at Rhodey and Rhodey must see something in it, because he changes tracks.
“Tony?” And Steve sounded anxious, but at least he wasn’t disappointed, and holy shit, would Tony ever stop caring about what Steve thought of him? The tablet from earlier slid off Tony’s legs, and Tony got the urge to rip his pants off, rip his skin off, muscle, down to bone, just to make it all go away because he was feeling so much. “Hey, Tony.”
“Huh,” Tony says, liking the sound of it.
“Asshole,” Steve pants out, laying back carefully against the ground.
“You were just trying to help us,” she says then, and it should sound like pointing out the obvious, but Tony’s been so afraid that nobody could tell, all he feels is sharp relief. “It might’ve even worked, too.”
“Take your time.”
“I’m happy for you guys,” Sam says. “I haven’t seen him this—at peace. Ever, I don’t think.”
Tony stared after him for a long time before he finally made it to his own bed.
Wanda inclines her head in concession, eyes fixed on the table. Clint still looks pissed, but his shoulders relax just the smallest bit.
“A ringing endorsement,” FRIDAY says, voice closer to its usual dryness.
“Whoa,” Tony says, going for calm but ending up closer to shocked.
“Sure,” Tony said, too tired to put up a fight.
“I’m just saying. You must feel pretty strongly if you feel this way even after everything that’s gone wrong.”
Get a grip, Stark, he tells himself. Just because you’re only now catching on, doesn’t mean this hasn’t been going on for weeks now. Don’t make it weird.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony feels like half the wild thing Natasha spotted on the common floor and half the distant, calculating man his dad always wanted him to be. Steve blinks at him as he fills the open doorway, gripping the frame. Steve smiles an insincere smile and swivels his chair to face him.
“Steve asleep?” he asks.
“No, I think I’ll tag along.”
Steve snorts at that, and Natasha seems to relax the rest of the way.
“Just a couple checkups I pushed back when you decided to stage an entire ballet with Death herself.”
“Yeah.”
“I know,” Tony says calmly, because he does, and he did. That’s why he took on all the stuff he did for the Avengers. Or, it’s at least part of the reason, a part he never thought he would be admitting to. Another part of it was that after New York he needed to keep busy with as much as possible, to stay awake, to keep working, to keep from spiraling down with his thoughts of how hopeless it was going to be to try and go up against an army like the one he’d seen through the wormhole. Another part was the ever-present guilt, the need to make it up to Yinsen, to make himself worthy of Iron Man and the second chance he was rewarded. The last part was the one aware of Nat’s preliminary report, the one that said he wasn’t worthy of being an Avenger, the part of him that was afraid they were going to kick him off the team for just—how he was.
“Well—” Scott says.
“Extremis isn’t—it’s not a super soldier serum,” Bruce says. “It was designed for that maybe, but even when Killian was testing it, the only people he could find willing to subject themselves to it were frustrated, desperate men and women. It’s not something you do if you have other options. For good reason.”
“Stand aside for the glory that is Doom!” says the closest one. It lifts its hand and fires an honest-to-God laser beam. It
“Why?” Tony quips back, proud of himself for not visibly panicking. “You see something the CT couldn’t, Sherlock?”
“Okay,” Tony says, and claps his hands together. “Dummy, over here—no, I, thank you. There, perfect.” Tony goes to pick up the arm and DUM-E, miraculously, stays where Tony stations him at Bucky’s side.
A tiny, excited gasp comes from the wild-haired kid, and her small hands go up to cover her mouth.
but when has that ever stopped him before?
“Okay,” Tony says easily, “okay, no. Fine.”
“Okay?” Peter asks, and his voice absolutely trembles. “Are you—I mean, Ned heard. And I didn’t know and I haven’t heard from you and, and Happy didn’t answer the phone so I thought
“Where did this—” Bucky says, looking down at the screen in confusion, and then up at Tony, utter betrayal on his face. “Tony,” he whines.
Steve raises his hands like he’s surrendering and Tony thinks, no, that’s not right. Steve doesn’t do that, doesn’t back down, especially not from Tony.
“Only you, sugarplum.”
“Of course it is,” Bruce hisses, leaning forward with his hands braced on the arms of his wheely chair. “It’s Ultron all over again. It’s making your home our base of operations all over again. Sounds an awful lot like control to me.”
Tony sits with his back against the tub and unlocks his phone, firing off a text to Pepper.
“No, no, no,” Clint’s voice carries up to Tony. “Oh, my God, Vis, come on. No, wait, don’t use those!”
Tony moves around the perimeter of the room to stand behind the thing. The only sounds are his heavy, clanking footsteps and the infected’s struggling hisses. He sets his feet wide, brings his arms up, and takes a deep breath.
“You know that he got—stung?” Rhodey asks.
“Yes,” she says eventually, tremulously, “goodnight.”
“A couple of times, actually—” Pepper says.
If he knew he’d be meeting Tony halfway, or at least trying. (Which is, maybe, not entirely fair, given that Bruce is here and talking and that’s more effort than he wastes on most human beings.)
He looks up to see Steve watching him from the other side of the island, mug in hand and a smile on his lips that tells Tony he’s not fooled at all, but that’s probably okay because Steve himself looks absolutely dopey with that expression. Tony lets himself smile back because who else is going to see? Bruce is out like a light.
“Are you okay?”
“No, it’s,” Tony says. He tightens his hold, curls his fingers around to actually hold Steve’s hand, and swipes his thumb along Steve’s knuckles. He feels Steve exhale sharply, then breathe in deeply, and Tony mirrors the deep breath slowly. The weight settles around him again and he’s floating, Steve a buoy in their own endless sea. It’s peace, Tony thinks.
“Yeah, Tony?”
lol i haven't actually forgotten about y'all. thanks for all the comments on the last chapter, they were very much appreciated.
He wonders what his girl knows (or thinks she knows) about his self-imposed solitude.
“Just wrapped up some work myself, actually,” Tony admits, matching Steve’s smile and he—God, he feels. “If you were looking for company.”
“Stark,” Steve says. At least he doesn’t look like he’s trying to defuse a bomb. Just…like he means it. “Tony, don’t ask me to do that. I don’t wanna hurt you anymore.”
Tony rolls his eyes so hard it would normally have given him a headache.
“Sorry I’m late,” she says. “Conference call with London went longer than I strictly wanted. They keep thinking they can wait us out and that we’ll donate the reactor.”
The terror he feels is because this is it. This is
“ ‘Right’ might be a bit of a stretch.”
Part of Tony rages and thinks
“I helped vet some of the shrink options,” he says neutrally. “And being benched fucking sucks, yeah, but it probably saved my life a few times in my early days at SHIELD. When it’s coming from a doctor, they’re usually right.”
“Why do
He hasn’t thought it in years, at least not so concretely, so front-and-center, but it pops up, unbidden: What would Mom think? The Maria Tony likes to remember would probably just give him a hug, one hand cradling his skull and one hand and squeezing his neck. She would call him “bambino,” even at this age, and she would tell him not to carry the weight of the world like this.
“What?” Steve says, eyebrows pulled together.
“Well,” he drawls, “I see Altair, which I know—visual magnitude of .77 and 16.7 lightyears from our sun—but no, I guess. What’s Aquila?”
“There is a celebration afterwards.” At least FRIDAY has the good sense to sound sorry about it. “A gala to mark the symbolic return of the Avengers.”
“Ms. Potts,” Bruce says, and he takes off his glasses to fiddle with them, “it may very well become necessary.”
“We’re all due to debrief with a UN representative in the morning,” Tony says, eyes still locked with T’Challa’s surprisingly understanding ones. “You may have all been pardoned, but the Accords are still in place, and you will follow them. We can talk amendments tomorrow afternoon when debrief is over, or you can crawl back to Wakanda. I don’t give a shit.”
By the time they get Steve settled into a bed, he seems a little better. He’s just exhausted, and drops off into a doze the second he knows they’re done with him for the time being. The nurse who sets them up says they’ll probably only hold Steve until they look through the scans. She doesn’t say so, but Tony’s pretty sure they don’t expect to find anything troubling.
“Okay,” Tony says, his lips brushing right above Steve’s collarbone. Not that kind of situation, he tells his body firmly.
“Okay,” Tony says, “maybe not, and it’s not a competition.”
“Pizza for breakfast?” Tony blinks at the container of still-cold pizza. (Steve swears he’s not being rude, this is how Tony insists he likes his leftover pizza.)
“Nope,” Tony says. “I’ll talk to ya later, Cap.”
He thinks of Howard, even though the only memory he can seem to conjure up is that time Tony partied a little too hard during a summer trip home and a couple of kids drove him home and left him on the front lawn, by the gates they didn’t have a passcode to. Howard had come out in his robe and gotten his slippers damp with dew as he hoisted Tony’s arm over his own shoulders and dragged him back inside. That was the Howard-and-Tony version of a hug.
Tony clamps his teeth hard on the giggle the view manifests. He’s well rested, comfortable, safe. Steve’s under him and Nat’s leaning on her elbows above him, and it smells like bacon. He’s absolutely floored by the feeling it’s giving him. His heart was definitely not made big enough for all the emotion it’s holding in this moment, and he has no idea what to do with the excess.
“Three tablets,” he explains. “They could be reviewing scans for hours.”
“Not your fault,” Natasha told him. “I’m going to go, but tell FRIDAY when we can come back in.”
Rhodey huffs, and it sounds like an old argument. Steve closes his eyes, tips his head back against the wall, and breathes measured breaths there. ‘Ready to die,’ Pepper had said. He needs a moment, just to let those words wash over him, and then to hold them up next to his idea of Tony, a man so full of light and curiosity and creation, a man with a personality so big he just—expands to fit whatever room he’s in, a man who couldn’t give up the good fight, even if it went against what the love of his life wanted for him, from him. But that’s a slippery slope, isn’t it? Because Tony’s the person who brings them post-mission smoothies and gives them all rooms, but he’s also the person to carry a nuke through space, or to threaten a terrorist, or to use himself as a human shield when a teammate’s in need.
“Then we’ll wait and see,” Steve says.
“Next version?” Tony says. “Oh, damn, nobody told you. This is it, sour patch. Final product, no refunds.”
Steve’s smile is small but genuine. Very real, and very warm.
“Stark?” Clint’s saying, taking a distinctive step forward. Tony swallows, swallows, swallows, and turns around so he’s gripping the rail behind him. He meets Clint’s eyes and just lets him see because where the fuck is he going to go? Tony’s more or less trapped, and thank the gods Clint’s in the mood to use that near-superhuman eyesight of his tonight, he’s so glad he doesn’t have to scrape for the words. Clint looks at him, and Tony knows Clint knows. He breathes, swallows again.
And there’s Steve’s disappointed voice. It makes Tony want to throw a chair. That voice has never once made him want to be calm or rational. Tony whirs around to face the man, and only just keeps from balling his fists up or baring his teeth.
Tony remembers how fast Sam was to start reading the Accords when they first came back, thinks of the easy back and forth between them that had next to nothing to do with Tony’s usual charm or effort. He thinks Sam’s probably right. Anyone else he might not believe, but it’s Wilson and, despite everything, a part of Tony’s glad Steve had a friend when he was on the run, because God knows Nat would’ve been in and out, coming and going, and she was here at the compound for that last bit before everyone else came back too.
Tony blinks. She looks downright smug. He narrows his eyes and snuggles further into Steve’s chest.
“Hi,” he says, and he sounds breathless and a little gruff, but not like he hasn’t spoken in however long it’s been now.
Tony’s grinning like a loon when he copies the link, sends it to Steve, and asks,
“Rogers, please. Let’s just make it through the next—”
But that’s not quite right, Tony thinks. He knows that’s not quite right. But then what is?
“The part,” Tony says. “Uh. The one where they…” And Tony looks over when he hears Steve breathing funny and the man’s trying so hard not to laugh it looks like he’s trying to hold bees in his mouth.
“I know,” Tony says, and he groans in frustration. Steve’s brow furrows and Tony swipes his thumb over the back of his hand and wrist. “I wanted to—want to.” He squeezes his eyes shut briefly. “He came down to try it on earlier. Still some adjustments to make, of course. Some of the plating was sticking, but mostly it’s already done. And I want him to have it because I’m the asshole who destroyed the last one—but it just—I couldn’t—”
Howard had said, surprisingly patient, gaze far away.
Scott laughs that laugh he gets when he’s uncomfortable. Cassie just nods seriously.
Tony brings his hands up to cover his eyes, just for a moment as he tells himself to get a fucking grip. This isn’t the kind of fight he’d wanted. It’s all wrong. This isn’t some random asshole in a bar, it’s not even Rhodey. It’s Steve with all twelve shades of blue in his eyes, and Tony wanting to make everyone hurt just as much as he hurts, just like always.
He still has his in-ear comm with him, transmission off. He’s only able to pick up every odd word, and it doesn’t make much sense. He tries to pay more attention to the voices than the words. Sam and Clint, their tones suggesting bickering, Steve’s increasingly clipped orders. This fire inside of him is spreading out from the injection sites, down to his knees and up his neck, slowly, so slowly.
It’s the start to a good day, he tells himself, and then wills himself to believe it.
“We promised to make more of an effort—”
didn’t get us thrown into cells,” Wanda says, equal parts confusion and venom.
“Green light, boss.”
“Or something,” Steve echoes. And then he smiles, wry and a little confused. “Strange,” he muses, looking down at their hands on his chest. “When did you get here? I must’ve zoned out.”
. “Later, okay? When I’ve had my fill of breathing.”
“He’s in the living room,” Steve says. “I’m just in my bedroom.”
“Yeah, no,” Tony says. “Far as I know, Jesus never ripped a man’s arm off.” Bucky snorts and Tony feels something in the atmosphere relax. “But what do I know; it’s been a while since I sat down with a Bible.”
“What noise?” he asks eventually.
Skimming the rest of the letter, Tony clarifies and summarizes as he goes.
Tony breaks his newfound routine that night and finishes the lighter weight struts for Rhodey’s legs. He mails them out the next morning with an apology note. Rhodes is an aerospace engineer, he literally has the qualifications of a rocket scientist, and he can screw the new struts into place himself.
“Fought the robots?” he asks. Tony nods. Steve stares for a long moment before he speaks, even though they both know he’s going to say it: “Yeah.”
“And we’re the only two up ’n about at such an ungodly hour,” Steve says, but he’s smirking now, eyes twinkling.
The rest of the ride passes with Steve panting and the EMTs asking questions that seem to slip over Steve’s brain like water, nothing soaking in. The EMTs don’t seem frustrated or particularly panicky over it, though Tony doesn’t know how much of that is them trying to keep Steve calm, how much is them trying to keep Tony calm. They ask, and wait, and ask again if Steve doesn’t say anything. He gets a couple of them, says slightly irrelevant things to some of them, but mostly he doesn’t answer, and after a couple of tries, the ambulance worker will look to Tony for an answer.
Tony reaches up and—yeah, he’s definitely still wearing the tinted HUD glasses. Effectively: sunglasses inside at 7:30AM. Patented asshole look. He’s worked with worse before. And, luckily, he can hear the elevator on its way.
“I don’t know how I’m supposed to help,” Steve says a little desperately.
“We’re doing dinner later,” Sam calls after him as he breezes out of the room.
Even the way he flicks his hand toward the tablet is controlled to a T.
“There is no way,” Tony says, gesturing with his free hand. “Oh, my God,
“Healing factor,” Tony says, instead of any of that other stuff. “Heightened senses, it seems like. I’m not exactly sure what else. It’s a modified strain, and even before, there seemed to be some leeway with what effects would manifest in which subjects.”
(See the end of the chapter for
There’s a pause on Steve’s end. Too long, Tony thinks.
. FRIDAY’s not installed here yet, so Tony’s as alone as he’s been in months, maybe years. It’s a massive relief to be able to take a full breath.
—but shrugs it off because, really, he shouldn’t be able to hear the hum of a refrigerator two floors down.
There’s a beat of silence. Tony thinks sympathetically of the school counselor who tried to help him when he was fourteen only to be met with some of the worst vitriol Tony’s ever slung in his life. He can feel the karma ripping toward him at lightspeed.
“Shhh, honeybunch,” Tony says, smirks. “You’re interrupting my trail blazing.”
The desperation lifts after a prolonged moment, just enough for Steve to make a joke about Tony’s brand name process of seduction, and then he snickers at his own cleverness. Tony comes up for air long enough to get out a comeback about Steve’s complete lack of innocence (“Really, Steven, you’re supposed to be America’s sweetheart. You’d be disowned if they saw that come-hither look.”) and the tension dissolves.
“A hundred and seventeen countries, Banner. And they were right to be uncomfortable with the level of power we had. They were right to demand change, and they were right to be pissed off. You’re probably right to be pissed off too.”
“I’ll have a smoothie in the lab,” Tony says back.
“Oh, God,” Bruce groans down the line.
Sam, who’s already shoveling food into his mouth, lifts his eyes, looking strangely innocent. Tony shrugs and doesn’t meet Steve’s eyes even though he can feel the weight of his gaze.
Tony doesn’t know what he meant by that, precisely, but he seemed fond and entirely accepting of the idea of Tony sleeping in his room. He even looked alarmed when he thought he’d gotten it wrong.
He fires off a repulsor blast. Thankfully, it doesn’t ricochet where it hits one of the bots, but it does little more than char the outer shell of the thing.
And that’s….well, that’s all of them. Rhodey goes to sit in the armchair between the couch and one of the loveseats, and Steve’s zipping around with paper plates and containers of food. They need more furniture, Tony notes with delight. They’re all here, and there’s not enough room to sit. The giddiness turns sour in his mouth for a brief moment as it brings up the memory of how empty it was, how lonely when it was only him and Vision. Those three months before Natasha came waltzing back in, where the vastness of the compound threatened to swallow him daily.
It feels good to start their diagnostics. U gets impatient and squirmy during the first checks, because U is always squirmy when they do this. DUM-E’s the one to stay perfectly still and follow orders—there were a couple incidents way back in the day that ended in both Tony and DUM-E getting a nasty shock or cut or some other such hurt—though he does chatter at Tony the entire time, like a teenager in a barber’s chair.
“Yeah, duh,” he says. “I remember that. Gimme the where and the when, I’ll bring the will and the way.”
“Any second,” Clint says. He crouches down on Tony’s other side, falling heavily to his knees and swaying worryingly when he gets there. “They were on standby. We’re gonna load ‘im into the Quinjet. They’re lending us a pilot and some medical personnel to get back to the compound.”
“Since when does Tony Stark need approval?”
The joke falls on deaf ears, but Steve curls into him, around him. The crown of his head presses into Tony’s nape. Steve’s hair would probably tickle if they weren’t both sleep-warm and if Tony wasn’t still fuzzy with sleep. All it is is soft.
“I—” Peter says, looking over and noticing who’s standing off to the side. “H-hi, Mr. America—Captain Rogers, sir, of course I remember. Or, I mean—sorry about Germany. Not really, though, because I still think you were wrong, but—oh, God. That’s not what I—”
“She’s lovely,” Tony says to Natasha and Sam later when everyone’s milling around the rec room.
Tony breathes out in a rush. Clint’s followed him after all. He didn’t hear the door open, but that’s Clint’s voice, a good couple paces behind him, but he doesn’t turn around.
“Ms. Romanoff,” FRIDAY says.
“Well, whose fault is that?”
“Jesus Christ.”
“You don’t even see it, do you?” Pepper asks. Exasperated sorrow. Then, angrier, “You shouldn’t have to martyr yourself for someone to notice you.”
“Since immediately after being released from the rubble,” she says. Steve’s eyes slip shut. Too long, much too long. Then again, five seconds would be too long in this hell.
“Well, it was bad for a few days, but Tony really is okay now.”
He’s almost got the new voice-command system mapped out by the time Sam and Steve step out of the elevator in workout clothes, looking bright eyed and bushy tailed.
to realize the meaning behind the stimulus, that he and Steve both slept crammed onto the sofa all night long, that Steve stayed and is still here. The warmth making a home in Tony’s chest grows roots, attaching him to Steve and the couch, pinning him down with utter contentment, making him leaden so that he feels like he might never move, might never find a good enough reason to get up and walk away from this morning.
“Thanks for that input, Dr. Banner,” Rhodey says, swiftly and seriously. “You can screw off now, or I’ll show you just how nice these new legs can be.”
“But then you were….then I decided I didn’t care if we were getting along. No, I mean—I care, obviously, or I wouldn’t be going to so much trouble.” Tony raises an eyebrow at Steve, but doesn’t jump in right away to save him. “Not that you’re—” He huffs out a sigh and looks skyward like he’s praying for divine intervention. “I do care. We work better when we’re on the same side, and it’s been…emptier here without you around, but I could deal with that as long as I knew your were alive and well somewhere.”
“—Tim—”
Tony’s not entirely comfortable with Steve knowing him so well—and when did that happen, anyway? But also who cares because that’s not the point of the conversation.
The hurt is easily accessible. It comes to life like a guard dog waiting to be called on, awake and snapping, so defensive it’s mean, vicious.
Tony can feel the tech’s eyes on him and knows they’ll pitch a fit if he tries to explain how the CT radiation really isn’t a problem for him, he really could just chill in here while they do the scan. All they need of Steve is his head, anyway, the rest of his body doesn’t even need to go through the scanner.
“What?” Steve’s probably blinking on the other end of the connection. Tony can almost hear him straightening up over a little jolt of genuine surprise.
What the Ten Rings taught him was the lie of neutrality. If you aim for Switzerland, the closest you’ll land is gleefully ignorant, maybe powerfully, destructively arrogant. He found himself suddenly living the all-too-real consequences of his own non-action, the difference being that he deserved those consequences and none of the other recipients had. This has been his philosophy since, evolving at times (from the realization of the lie of neutrality in Afghanistan to the lie of apoliticism when the government tried to step in that first time) but always clinging to that first thread, the visceral disgust at zero-accountability systems.
All-in-all, Steve is a whole and complete person in Tony’s eyes-ears-nose-brain now, maybe for the first time ever. He’s not an old war story from Howard, or Fury’s lapdog, or even Cap. He’s Steve, with all that could possibly mean, and Tony wishes he’d brought the HUD glasses with him after all. He wants to catalogue all of this, feels it desperately, this needs to be saved. (And, truth be told, Tony could do with the extra wall between him and Steve; he fears he might’ve gotten rid of one too many defenses.)
thank u @ anyone still sticking with me on this fic! y'all blow my mind. comments always always always appreciated!
“Since over half the team decided they’d rather jump headfirst into the RAFT than work with me to ratify the Accords,” Tony says.
“Mostly of turning into a braindead monster and killing everyone,” Tony says. “Or of slowly going insane and dropping dead from some bullshit inability to reach REM sleep. But…” Steve’s nose nudges against Tony’s head, and Tony breathes deeply again. “I was scared of it being Ultron all over again. Of not saying anything and being blamed when shit hits the fan.”
“Nobody’s keeping you here,” Tony says before he’s really thought about it. Part of him, a corner somewhere in his brain, can’t help but feel somehow proud of Bruce for speaking up, even through the inconvenience of it. Most of him, though, thinks,
“I could sleep,” Tony lies easily.
Steve’s gotten out a knife and a bowl to go with the cutting board, but he’s just staring at them on the counter now. Tony turns his back to get a mug and the sugar down from the cabinet.
Tony stares at him. He would think Sam’s fucking with him if he didn’t know any better. Sam’s not generally difficult to read, though. He smirks when he’s joking, raises an eyebrow when he’s making a joke at someone’s expense, and right now he just looks genuinely confused.
They both look up to see Spider-Man barreling toward them in a series of graceful flips and webs.
“I think I’m gonna come with you,” he says, smiling. Then, lowering his voice, “Look. I’ll pinky promise to not be in the way, if that’s what it takes, but the Avengers use the buddy system. Who am I to break tradition?”
“Actually,” Clint says, “I’ve got my eye on a palm tree on the north shore of Maui.”
Tony circles the room and talks like it’s a networking event, like he’s making up for lost time. He talks to everyone as if to say
He tries everything he can think of: lavender essential oils on his pillow, FRIDAY playing ocean sounds, getting buck-ass nude underneath the softest sheets money can buy.
“Hey, look,” Steve says softly, and he points to a kite shape in the stars above them. “Aquila.”
He surveys the contents of the fridge for another five seconds and takes one lingering look at the people gathered before he starts scooping out ingredients.
“No, I think I meant he’s a lunatic,” Bucky says, coming farther into the room, getting down a glass from the cabinet and pouring himself some orange juice. “And thanks for the sentiment, but you really don’t need to make me a thing.”
“The line of presidential succession?” Bruce says helpfully.
Abruptly, he wanders to the other end of the living room where Clint and Vision are playing darts. Wanda and Scott wave him over and talk him into gambling with them. He bets on Vis because he’s, like, a quarter Tony’s son, even though one look tells him Barton’s here to destroy the competition. He graciously loses $40 and claps Vision on the shoulder and leans in close enough to whisper.
“God Almighty,” Tony says, and slumps down onto his pillow.
He sets his mug down, mostly empty now, and spins it by the handle.
There. Casual as can be. He feels like maybe he should be panicking about this, but he doesn’t want to. He wants a beer, and to keep chatting with Scott, and to watch Vision kick Clint’s ass at darts.
“G’night,” Steve mumbles back, and Tony smiles at the foot of the bed, turning the brightness down on the tablet.
There are timestamped pictures of him before the Avengers reunited (mostly headed to and from meetings, a couple shots of him walking into the hospital Rhodey was staying at), and they’re side by side with photographs from the second signing of the Accords and the beginning of the gala that night, along with explanations as to why that second row can’t be real. In the first photos it points out his injuries, one of which may have, the author reasons, been responsible for his demise. Even his body shape is compared; in the first row of pictures, he looks ill but also like he’d been stress eating, he’s got a bit of a belly and hollows under his eyes. In the second, he looks like a manic version of his younger self, a bit of a slimmer waist and more color, hair carefully styled (but that last part’s all Natasha). Tony figures the physical renovation he did to the Malibu house was good for something, and getting rid of the alcohol didn’t hurt either.
“I started fucking up the vector calculations, Steve,” he says insistently. “JARVIS locked everything down? He said it was a protocol for when I’m mentally impaired, but this is just mutiny—I’m not done yet—”
Maybe he's being a little dramatic—it sure as hell wouldn’t be the first time he’d been accused of theatricality—but he has to wait for this new version of reality to settle around him. In this version, Steve cares about him, and lets Tony seek out contact, which Steve then adds to. It’s a reality where the team might be real, might work and not even kill him in the process. In this reality—wonder of wonders—Steve wants to work with him to fix the issues with the team.
“And everyone else?” Tony says. Bruce just stares at him. Rhodey and Tony watch Bruce stare at Tony for a few seconds until it becomes clear that he’s not going to answer. Tony thinks he’s pissed Bruce off somehow; the man’s breathing is suspiciously even and he’s not really blinking. It’s strange. Pepper doesn’t move from her spot against the wall, but at least Tony knows why she’s upset with him.
“Next time I’m getting a contract written up.” Bucky blinks his eyes like he’s rolling them behind closed lids, but he reaches a steadying hand forward when Steve slides off the exam table anyway.
“Iron Man—”
Tony’d been afraid he’d have to extrapolate on that since it’s admittedly pretty vague, but Steve’s smile softens into something like a sincere expression and Tony counts it as a win.
Tony stares at him, and stares, and stares, even though he knows his answer.
“It’s Tony,” Steve says, and stares at the wall opposite him. He wants to look at Bucky, to drink in the sight of him being awake and aware of himself, but it’s too much. He desperately wishes he hadn’t drank the water Sam pressed into his hand on the ’jet, because he thinks he might get sick for real this time. It feels like a forbidden comfort to have Bucky here when Tony literally used himself as a human shield to save Steve from a falling building. It feels like betrayal, again, right when he and Tony had agreed to talk things through.
Tony waves them off shortly. He knows, okay, he’s working on it.
“Jesus,” Rhodey mutters. Then, louder, “I mean
“Iron Man,” Steve says.
It’s just before 5 AM, and Tony feels good. He wants to chase the feeling, though he’s not entirely sure of the most effective way to do that. Brain still half remembering the old days, he recalls the benders, just one more drink, another line just to hold him over when everything got overwhelming or the people seemed vicious. Chasing the incredible, ultimate freedom with reckless abandon. And later, chasing that feeling of worth every time he destroyed another stash of the weaponry designed by his own hands, chasing Yinsen’s ghost. After the Battle of New York, chasing the feeling of a full breath, the actual lungful he could only manage when a new suit was assembled and powering on in front of him, or some other new precaution put into place against the looming threat of vengeful aliens.
Steve laughed and shook his head helplessly. “Thanks, Tony.”
Part of Tony wants to laugh, point out that he wasn’t asking. The rest of him is too busy sighing in relief.
Rogers?” Tony asks, reaching over him for the tissues. He makes a show of balling it up and taking aim, lining his elbow up and squinting one eye shut, tongue poking out the side of his mouth in concentration.
“Probably not,” Tony says, a little breathless but steady.
Tony’s never actually been here before, in person. His first impression is that it’s spacious and echoey and it feels
The pizza’s still warm when they get back to the compound. With the preliminary debrief Clint mentioned, the others didn’t beat them back by more than an hour. Noticing the boxes upon boxes upon boxes, some with strange topping combinations—the pizzeria's even gone to the trouble of learning a pared down Mockba recipe because Nat once mentioned in a BuzzFeed interview she missed it sometimes—Tony decides that whatever they tipped wasn’t enough and he’ll write them another check for the hell of it. It’s a little local pizzeria that drives way out of their way to deliver to the compound, and have learned how to make a very many pizzas very quickly since the Avengers moved upstate.
“Just because I would do something—”
“I don’t think I’m sleeping anytime soon, and I’m tired of staring at the wall,” Tony says. Steve takes a visibly deep breath. “Go turn on a Bond movie and I’ll make the popcorn.”
He breezes into the room, a little too fast maybe, and uses the momentum to propel himself toward the coffee maker. Scott’s sitting at the island with a StarkPad, a kid on the screen who must be his daughter, Vision’s standing in front of the stove, apparently cooking, and Clint’s sitting at the dining table on a wooden chair, propped up on at least five different cushions and wrapped in bandages (and Tony feels a stab of guilt at that, having wiped his own slate clean of injuries without actually healing), facing the kitchen and looking riled up.
And yet, Tony tells himself. And yet here they are. That shouldn’t fix everything but it should mean something. It has to mean something.
They're at the press meeting some idiot thought to jam between the signing and the gala. A reporter’s asking Captain America if he doesn’t think he’s a sellout for signing (not in so many words, but that’s the gist of it).
“Yes, boss,” she said, and the noise stopped. Tony hummed his acknowledgement.
He bites his hand to stifle the noise he’s making, and it feels almost good, like when you have a headache and you press on your head to relieve the pressure. He bites harder.
“Any idea what happened?” Clint asks, and Steve can already hear feet pounding on the street, getting closer. Steve realizes belatedly that FRIDAY must not be transmitting through the comms, just the suit’s speakers.
Tony grins, wide and free, and wonders if Scott would accept an offer of the services of the best child psychologist on the West Coast or if he’d be insulted.
“Yep,” Natasha says. “We’ve got an entire day.”
thank u all for the incredible comments. i think i only really replied to things this time if there were direct questions, and even then i might've missed some. i'm a goddamn mess of a person, i swear to god. i'm so busy all the time these days. pls tell me if something in this chapter doesn't make sense and i'll fix it
She trails off, it’s obviously Tony’s turn to say something, so he opens his mouth, and the only thing he can think of spills out.
“Fingers crossed.”
It earns him a sleepy snort, but Bruce’s eyes are drooping again so Tony doesn’t even have to hide his responding grin.
“No, really,” Tony says, and it’s as good as an admission. “Cap’s only about half-asshole, and he’s definitely half-angelic, just not with me. Besides, he’s hot as hell. Peak of human perfection and all that. You saying you wouldn’t tap that?”
“Mornin’,” Tony says quietly.
Bruce's eyes light up and he sucks in a breath.
It drags him under again.
“Listen,” Tony says, willing himself to project calm and cool, no matter how on edge he is, “we can’t Van Gogh this anymore. We aren’t suffering artists, and not dealing with our problems isn’t brave or stoic. If we don’t deal with ourselves—if we leave things as they are, people will die.”
“Tomorrow is the scheduled signing of the revised Accords,” FRIDAY says.
“Since you woke up?” Steve repeats, and when Tony focuses on his face again he’s frowning deeper. “But it’s been—”
“We’ll inform local authorities," Nat replies.
“What?” Tony says, blinks.
“You won’t, okay?” Steve says. “That’s my promise of the day. You’re not going to go insane, you’re not going to murder anyone. Not another Avenger, and not an innocent bystander. I swear to God. And not because I’m going to stop you, or take you down, or whatever other euphemism you pick.”
“That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t be blamed,” Tony says.
In short, Steve’s lying, and Tony has mixed feelings about that. But it’s one of those lies people tell to make you feel better, and it’s a nice enough thought that Tony doesn’t call him on it.
“What do you mean?” Pepper says, quick as a whip, and turns to face Bruce instead.
“Sell me as a trophy husband to the highest bidder?” Tony says.
Tony grabs onto Steve’s forearm, and then slowly lowers back down, Steve flat on his back, Tony curled over him. Steve’s back arched, Tony pressing down.
Tony sighs through his nose.
The list feels like something final. Here’s Tony, after advocating for the Accords for a year now, after vying for the belief that the most powerful don’t get to decide what’s right and who they help, and now this list, this list ranking the value of human life. He knows it’s a decision he makes in the field every time he goes out, but it’s never felt so clinical.
“Oh? A getaway. Romantic. Didn’t think you were the type.”
“Welcome back to the party,” Sam says when he’s visible again.
Clint shrugs as his hand falls to the armrest of his chair, and he’s got one leg kicked up on the edge of the conference table, relaxed as can be.
The doctors know about as much as Tony does at this point, so he doesn’t even feel bad about ditching medical. He even asks about those tests they want to run, and when he hears (MRI, blood tests, cognitive responses, etc.) he feels even more justified. If they’re not going to do anything useful, there’s no reason for Tony to sit here twiddling his thumbs. Finally, the doctor sighs and moves for a piece of cotton to hold against the puncture on Tony’s arm. Rhodey excuses himself with a quip about letting everyone know Tony’s not a raging monster (yet). And even though Tony knows that Rhodey’s just giving him some privacy and probably about to hunt Pepper down—which, yeah—he’s grateful for the gesture.
that if JARVIS were still around, he’d flip that switch, but it’s not JARVIS, it’s FRIDAY. Tony loves FRIDAY because she’s his kid too, but it’s not the same, it can’t be the same. It’s petty and unreasonable, but he’s just not close enough with FRIDAY for her to understand what’s going on with him right now, and he doesn’t have the words to explain it.
“Just,” Steve takes a shallow breath and huffs it out, “listen, okay?”
“Training room was helpful when there were, like, five of us but—team training with this many people…it would be good to run sims,” he says, making a show of trailing off with his own ideas, like he’s already mapping it out in his head—which, to be fair, he kind of is, but it’s about the reassurance, okay?
he says, and he answers the phone before he even makes it to the kitchen.
Tony watches Steve for a moment as Steve watches the countertop.
“If our baseline for alien invasions is the Chitauri,” Tony says, “then this is a relatively small attack. I’m estimating a couple hundred hostiles based on what I can see from the sky.”
“Oh,” Tony says.
“It’s just life,” Pepper reminds him quietly. “Not three strikes and you’re out.”
“Since forever,” Natasha says shortly, cutting Scott a no-nonsense look. “Even at SHIELD there were psych-evals—”
“How can we be out of eggs?” Bruce asks from his spot on one end of the couch (they’ve expanded to fit most of the kitchen and living room, from the dining table to the kitchen counter to the recliner). “We get mass deliveries every week. We have enough eggs to feed a small army.”
Vision walks Wanda to her room, now that Clint is more or less in the clear. Scott goes off to his room to call his girlfriend once it’s late enough in the morning for that kind of thing. Someone gets Sam a pair of crutches and he and Thor leave long enough to get protein-heavy breakfasts for everyone remaining. Natasha and Bucky are the only ones who stay the entire time, but by the time Rhodey comes back, Vision, Thor, and Sam are there too. Rhodey looks determined, the face of a colonel on a mission. He stands by the wall and watches Steve pace until he catches on, pauses, and turns to face the other man head-on.
“Not surprised,” Sam says.
“Stark?”
“Don’t care,” Tony says. “It’s the principle of the thing.”
“What?” Tony says as he flops back down on the bed, finally undressed the rest of the way. He settles on his side, elbow propping his head up, and reaches a hand out to touch Steve’s side, just because he can. He nods toward the trash can. “Can’t make the shot?”
can he be?
Tony doesn’t know how Steve knows to take the stairs instead of the elevator, but he does, and Tony’s glad. If he had to stand in an elevator right now he might actually claw his way out of his own epidermis.
“Hm,” Tony says. “Do they make a compelling argument?”
“Find Richards,” Tony says. “I gotta go.”
“Awesome sauce,” Tony says. “So. We won, then?”
“Rogers,” he says pleasantly when the door opens. T’Challa watches on silently.
“Disney roulette,” Tony says. “Place your bets, old man. Who’s gonna end up crying this time?”
To Steve’s exceptional merit, all he does is smile at the ceiling, and Tony can feel his eyebrows raise where his face is still pressed to Tony’s shoulder. Tony—if pressed—might have assumed Steve would give a reaction similar to the others who’ve been here: sheets pulled up, embarrassment, peeved. Tony’s pleasantly surprised by both the choice in post-orgasm confession and the way Steve only seems to settle in at the sound of FRIDAY’s voice.
“Thor, it’s good to, y’know. See you,” Tony says. “And thanks for showing up and saving all our asses.”
—but that doesn’t mean it’s not so easy, so natural to get swept up in Steve’s energy.
“Uh-huh.”
“Yeah,” Tony says quietly, for lack of any other response.
—on the tip of his tongue.
“Way to stick it to the man,” Tony says.
“Getting acquainted with the compound’s Hulk room,” she says, and Steve would be curious, really, if curiosity didn’t take so much energy.
Tony only sees the sketchpad laid out on Steve’s bed because Steve shifts in the doorway to block his view of it. That’s interesting, definitely, but Tony lets him get away with it for now.
“God, no, wait,” he says. Bruce pauses, mouth still half open, and Tony says, “Jesus, I’m bad at this. Sleep, you.” He makes a vague shooing gesture at Bruce as his science bro’s face melts from shock to amusement. “We’ll have a science party later.”
Tony misses.
And it’s obviously not that he can’t talk, because of course he can. And he can still communicate with language. He hums to himself while he works and he both receives and sends emails and texts. He simply doesn’t feel the overwhelming need to talk, to fill the silence, so he doesn’t.
“Among other things,” Steve says.
“Not worth the trouble,” he finally admits, looking sheepish about it and, yeah, Tony gets that. He takes a moment to contemplate his answer.
The thing is, Tony really, really doesn’t want to go upstairs and stare at food while his ex-ex-teammates stare at him. The thought of a movie makes it almost bearable because at least that promises minimal social interaction. Plus, he can’t help but mock himself internally: isn’t this what he wanted? For the Avengers to be together?
It’s not until the third beer that Tony realizes: he’s not even buzzed. He doesn’t feel anything, no warmth in his stomach, no heat on his face, no careful tingling in his fingertips. Nothing.
Tony looks at her, opens his mouth with no idea how to say—
Tony trades places with Wanda after a little while and falls into an easy rhythm. Extremis is good and Tony feels efficient and sharp and the team runs smoothly. The bots are resilient, but not invulnerable, and it’s surprisingly satisfying to be fighting non-living combatants. Giving in to reckless abandon and smashing them to pieces with only the guilt of lost engineering beauty is refreshing, to say the least.
The information sits, and Tony probably imagines the way Wanda’s brow smooths out the slightest bit. Vision nods like he’s in agreement with something sage.
and said to Bucky
“Alright,” she said, easily enough.
affect my ability to ride an ant into battle?”
And he remembers, with a jolt. The woman being worn as a second skin, fighting next to Wanda, Thor’s new haircut, Steve under a building, a stinging, burning horror in his leg, FRIDAY
“Why,” Tony says, turning his head to look at Clint without sitting up, “wouldn’t they be?”
“‘Kay,” Steve says on the exhale. He doesn’t look happy in the slightest. In fact, his eyes scrunch in what seems to be pain, but his breathing evens out to a deliberate pattern and he stays still on the bench.
“At least he wasn’t actively dying?” Pepper says, voice dripping with saccharine sarcasm. Rhodey shrugs theatrically, lifting his hands palm-up over his head.
Tony’s smile melts into something a little more genuine and he swings on the couch so he can kick his legs up too.
Maybe he’s a little tightly wound and maybe there’s a headache building behind his eyes and down his neck and into his chest where headaches definitely shouldn’t be, and maybe he’s stayed up later than he logically should’ve if only by a couple hours, and maybe he’s even on his way to bed when he passes through the kitchen and sees Wanda there, sitting at the island.
He really is burning from the inside out, hot and blistering, and he can’t help but remember Pepper’s face when she’d cried out for him, glowing and hurt and strapped to a table.
“I know it doesn’t matter how I want you to feel,” Tony says. Steve stays looking at the TV, but he reaches a hand up and grabs onto Tony’s leg. “For what it’s worth, though. I don’t get off on your misery.”
“Hey,” Tony says. “Maybe next time you’ll think twice about headbutting a tree.”
Tony’s gotten so sucked into the conversation before him he’d almost forgotten about leaving Steve in the elevator. Almost, but not quite—so when Steve walks out and Natasha collapses sideways on the couch, feet kicked into the air, Tony just waves Steve over and looks back at Scott for him to continue. Bruce looks at Steve and back at Tony, an air of doneness about him that Tony appreciates greatly. Scott looks at Natasha, at Steve, and back at Tony who’s waiting for him to continue, and narrows his eyes as his jaw snaps shut.
“A vacation with no lab?” Tony says, taking great care to sound aghast and an appropriate level of horrified by the very idea. “That’s what you get for not letting me help with the itinerary.”
A low rumble overtakes the kitchen, and a nostalgia kicks up in Tony’s chest. He checks the news on his tablet and moves on to his second and third cups of coffee. Fox News is displeased, but it’s mostly nitpicking at this point. Tony seriously doubts anyone’s going to break down their door and haul them off to the RAFT over a few insurance claims. The rest of the major news networks are tentatively positive about the returning Avengers, and Tony honestly feels like he should be doing a touchdown dance.
“I shall return,” FRIDAY says, voice inflected with more warmth that usual. Air forces its way out of Tony’s throat, and he makes it into a sob instead of a scream.
“You’re a jerk,” Steve says, “you know that?”
“What I really wanna know,” Tony says, folding back onto the ground with a grace he’s never possessed until a couple days ago, “is who the hell was videotaping my pseudo-death when we were actively evacuating the area, what the hell.”
“What does that mean?” Steve says.
Eventually, the doctor nods to Bucky and exits the room. Bucky inclines his head at the doctor in response, but leaves his chin down when he rotates to glare at Steve.
Steve laughs, and it’s less bell-like than usual, more sleep-rough. His fingernails scratch lightly at Tony’s scalp. Tony has to pause and seriously consider the possibility that he’s been kidnapped and somehow rigged into an ideal virtual reality by someone looking to dig his most well kept secrets out of his brain. He read a book like that once; it seems almost like the most likely explanation.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony happens to look at the clock around a time reasonable for breakfast and decides he could use a break (and some coffee). He takes a tablet, a USB, and some dirty dishes up with him to the communal level.
“We’re gonna be—okay,” Steve parrots back, breathing through the pain.
“Well,” Sam says, and looks off to the side. More considering than chastised, but whatever. “Now that you mention it, I mean, no. Guess I assumed that was something the ‘senior members’ took care of.”
“Hey,” Steve says, putting his hands in his pockets and rocking back on his heels.
“T’n,” Steve calls, and Tony’s heart clenches. His entire body tenses, and the hand on his shoulder tightens its grip too. It’s Clint, he realizes, and takes a deep breath. Wanda’s watching them intently from a couple yards away, and Thor’s talking to Natasha and some nameless agent a few yards beyond that.
“SHIELD’s the worst,” Rhodey agrees. “It’s not that I’m glad they’re gone because it was nice when they dealt with the bureaucratic bullshit, but also good riddance.”
Every “act natural” scene from every movie Tony’s seen in his 40-odd years flashes before his eyes, and he has to bite the inside of his cheek to keep from cracking up.
He went through the files when the fiasco was over, though. There had been descriptions, mostly of young people who had fought for their country and then been cast aside upon their return, signing away their bodies for a second chance. Steve remembers thinking he understood, and then he remembers realizing for the first time just what he’d been gambling when he decided to let Erskine and Howard experiment on him.
“Some things,” Tony says, trying to dredge up offense at the statement and landing mostly on amusement. “You know I’m actually almost 50 and am still alive somehow, right?”
“Are you?” she asks.
The sight of Steve catches Tony’s attention from the corner of his eye. Still, very still, and staring unblinking at the floor. He doesn’t exactly look tired, but Tony suspects anyway. When he nudges Steve’s foot with his own, the man’s focus flickers to Tony immediately.
Her arms are tight around him, one hand even cradling the back of his skull, her warm fingers curling into the hair there. Tony is suddenly very aware of just how greasy his hair is.
There had been videos.
“What’s up with the traffic light?” Scott says, sliding into the unoccupied seat next to Steve.
He expected to have to do at least a little searching, but the scuffle is immediately audible when he reaches 57th, and he finds a small drove of robots—all automated according to FRIDAY, none being piloted—outside of Carnegie Hall. A quick sweep of the area shows most civilians running for the hills, and the group of eighteen robots don’t seem to be spreading out or causing more than structural harm so far, though they are weaponized.
“Oh,” Tony says again, and turns on his rock-stool so he can replace his elbow with his forehead on Steve’s shoulder, willing his tears to evaporate before they spill over.
Tony’s sweating the way people sweat when they’re on party drugs.
Vision doesn’t answer and if there’s one trait he got from JARVIS it’s that they can insert smugness into silence so that even Tony can hear it, so he lifts his head and finally notices that they’re in his bedroom, Vision’s floated them across the floor and through the walls like the world’s sneakiest air hockey puck. Tony huffs a laugh that ends in a yawn.
“That wouldn’t have happened,” Clint says.
“Yeah, well,” Bruce says, and he doesn’t seem to be awake enough to be overly self-conscious. “It’s exciting to have a lab again.” He pauses to yawn. “Guess I got carried away.”
“We’ve got a job to do,” Tony says, trying his best not to slur his words. He looks straight into Steve’s eyes, though he doesn’t dare lift the faceplate. “Together.”
It doesn’t take them long to migrate back to the living room. Tony would just take them down to the ’shop, but all of the stools down there are backless, hard metal. He’s got holo-interfaces in just about every room now (except the guest bathrooms, even he knows that’s excessive) so they just settle back on the couch there and Rhodey asks what he’s been working on.
There’s nothing but blue. Is that even possible? How can there be—twelve different kinds of blue and not a single crosses into green territory?”
—like Tony was nothing, just another obstacle in the way of Bucky, like Mom didn’t mean anything, like not even Howard’s life meant anything to Steve when all was said and done.
“Probably not, the way this conversation’s going,” Tony says.
“Make thicker helmets?” Tony guesses, because as much as he’s pretty sure at this point that the conversation has nothing to do with the helmets, he kind of wishes it did.
“You know I actually met Fury as a kid?” he asks. “Course, I didn’t have a clue who he was, but…”
“I am,” he says, and realizes they’d asked who would be coming with, and he’s apparently just volunteered despite being the least qualified human being for the job. He pauses with that information, one foot braced to hop into the vehicle.
“Well then.” Steve heaves a great sigh. They’re sitting on the ground now, underneath their tree. Tony moved down a little while ago when he needed a moment to think through his response, and Steve followed. Now, Steve’s on the ground, leaning up against the trunk with his legs bent and Tony’s beside him, sitting on a small rock criss-cross so their knees touch. “Do you have an avenue in mind that would let us deal with the Wanda thing without singling her out?”
“Stop,” Tony says, orders. It’s too loud, it echoes, but he can’t go in circles forever. “Cap, I’m tired.”
Tony rolls his eyes because, really, they both know that’s not going to last. When it comes down to it, Bruce is just as bad of a workaholic as Tony, and he gets just as little sleep (at least pre-Extremis). Ever since he first came to crash at the tower, Bruce has had the tendency to act like it might be his last time allowed in a lab even though Tony's made it a point to gift the space and funding to Bruce to do with as he sees fit. Unless Bruce can suddenly go twelve hours without coffee or tea or some form of caffeine, this rule’s doomed to fail.
“Must not be that solid if you can’t even tell what it is,” Tony says back. Rhodey just looks at him. “C’mon, we all know it wasn’t Barnes’s fault. Okay, so maybe he has awful taste in best friends, but I bet Rogers was even cuter when he was a hundred pounds soaking wet. Like a feral kitten, or something.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Bucky Barnes,” Bucky says, shaking Bruce’s hand.
“Sweet dreams,” Steve says into the skin behind his ear. Tony grips Steve’s hand harder for a moment, fighting off a second shiver, and feels Steve’s mouth curl into a smug smile. (Okay, so he can’t see the smile, but he doesn’t have to be able to see it to know it’s self-satisfied. Because Steve’s an asshole like that.)
“Please, God, call me Tony.”
is. His fingernails scratch lightly over the t-shirt there, Steve’s breath catching at the movement. Tony files the sound away, using it to fortify his confidence. “I liked waking up on the couch this morning. I liked that it was
Tony rolls his eyes.
“C’mon, man!” Sam says. “We’re watching a movie, can’t you mute that?”
Tony shoves at Steve’s shoulder and rolls his eyes. They’re suddenly very close to each other and Tony hasn’t exactly been this close to someone, facing them and lending them his full attention, since he got control (more or less) of the way his senses work now. Steve has a distinct smell Tony’s brain immediately classifies as familiar and—somewhat surprisingly, especially since he at least smells partly like SHIELD agent—safe. SHIELD and the balm he uses on the leather straps of his shield. His hair is golden and thick, and Tony can see now where Steve styles it to hide a cowlick on the right side. His eyebrows taper off almost awkwardly, meaning it’s been just a couple weeks too long since he let Nat shape them up. One of his ears is just ever-so-slightly smaller than the other, but Tony really doesn’t think a human without enhanced senses would ever be able to tell without the help of a computer program.
“The signing will take place at the UN headquarters in New York City at 4 PM,” FRIDAY says.
now. Nothing to do but forge ahead, he supposes. Steve’s feet are planted firmly on the ground, though he stays sitting for now. His posture is challenging nonetheless. Tony lets go of the doorframe and stands with his shoulders back, feet exactly shoulder-width apart.
He’s warm and heavy. Safe. Surrounded in a glorious nothingness he’s been missing for a long time, somehow. If he had to equate the feeling to a place, it would be the mansion on Fifth Avenue, the one he hasn’t been to in—years. Tony holds the feeling so close that he almost loses it completely.
“Any one of them or a specific one?” Clint says.
“I’m pretty sure,” Tony says, ignoring the water bottle and dropping his head back to look up at her, “that I don’t have any bananas.”
“Oh,” Cling says, “sure, yeah.”
Steve shuts up, then, and comes closer. Tony turns back to his hologram, though he’s definitely lost concentration. Steve’s behind him, a little to the side, and puts a hand on the junction between Tony’s shoulder and neck, thumb swiping slowly. It feels at odds with the speed at which Tony’s existing. He almost wants to duck out of the contact, but doesn’t want to give Steve the wrong idea, so he takes a deep breath instead, focuses on the graphics in front of them, twisting them, trying to think of weak points, stabilizing factors, the safest way to let them be the biggest idiots about personal safety. A few minutes go by, and Steve watches the light as Tony manipulates it.
Tony’s head rolls towards Clint and his eyes open fully just long enough to look up at Clint and break Steve’s heart.
“Hey, Brucey,” Tony says, going for light, “what’s—”
Tony’s struck by a sudden terror, like he’s standing on the edge of a cliff, armor nowhere in sight. He’s also hit by the absolute clarity of the knowledge that he’s here with Steve, that Steve’s on the same ledge that he is, that, while this might be the riskiest, stupidest thing he’s done in years—Steve’s here, too. Steve seems to want him here.
“We’ll be discussing bonding night activities, so come with options ready,” Steve says with a straight face. Clint snorts and Sam groans, while Vision looks to be contemplating the topic with something alarmingly close to sincerity. Before he can open his vibranium mouth, Tony jumps back in.
Rhodey comes the rest of the way into the room pretty quickly, Tony notes with something like glee. He's moving really well. Still, Tony should add the braces to his to-do list.
all next to the sense memory of Rhodey’s arms around him in the desert. Today was less serious, but Bucky wasn’t there. He needs to see it for himself, maybe, and Tony gets that. Steve goes willingly enough when prodded, but not without an exasperated look back at Tony.
Rhodey nods slowly from where he’s sitting, gaze on the far wall.
who is exceptional, superiorly thoughtful, and delightfully thorough
Eventually, he opens his eyes, feeling truly rested. They’ve shifted around in the night, a little farther apart than they were, and Tony’s ended up on his stomach (even though he doesn’t have the arc reactor anymore, he still rolls onto his stomach a lot in his sleep, a remembered weight on his chest sometimes present when he lies on his back), his arm flung haphazardly across Steve’s abs. Steve himself is on his back, face slack and so beautiful the force of it hits Tony like a truck.
What Tony definitely doesn’t say: “The things we do for love, amiright?”
The kicker is that the nanites can’t remotely interface with other systems. Tony doesn’t want to become hackable. So, while the microscopic bots are programable, they have to be removed, each manually tweaked, and then reinserted. And the process would be much less gross if he were talking about machines instead of his own body. Ugh.
“It’s not like Sam or Scott ever volunteered for Nazi experimentation specifically as part of a ploy to exact revenge on an existing member of the team.”
“Tony.” A voice from the other direction. Wait, Tony thinks. That’s not right. “Can you open your eyes?”
“Do you require medical assistance?”
“And a long time before that,” Tony confirms. “Anyway, I’ll show ya the in’s and out’s of the ol’ ox cart later, that backpack looks like it weighs seventy pounds.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait,” Scott interjects, “how does that even work? That’s not a structurally sound way to—have a body.”
Tony does remember to turn the transmission off on his comm this time.
“This is bullshit,” Clint says, tossing himself bodily against the back of his chair.
“Boss?” FRIDAY asks, sounding startled.
“Maybe they’ll have him settled by the time you’ve gotten the boulder removed from your spine,” she says evenly. He can feel Bucky’s gaze on them, but doesn’t look.
Steve wrinkles his nose, eyes leaving Tony’s face to look down at their hands. His finger follows a path across his knuckles and Tony can’t see from this angle but he knows there’s a wicked scar there, one from his pre-Iron Man days, actually. Something from London, with cocaine and a downright terrifyingly dingy club. A man with gaudy rings and maybe broken glass, though he can’t recall which of those things actually cut his hand. He probably deserved it.
“Simple, really,” Steve says. “We commit to talking to each other, and listening. And you start hanging out with the team more, at least on bonding nights once we get that going, so you can see—or we can both see—what happens when we’re not alone.”
so i know i've been gone Quite a while but life happens! i have a degree, a finished novella, a job, and an apartment now. should be able to write/update CONSISTENTLY now. thanks @ anyone still reading this
Sam’s halfway through saying, “Not yet,” when Steve interrupts.
“Yeah, yeah, 3PO. I think I can brush my teeth on my own, though, so…” Tony wiggles his way out of the hug and stands. He half expects there to be blood on the knees of his pants when he looks down, but of course there’s nothing there.
“They have stingers, too,” Steve’s saying. “Reports differ, but the poison will either kill you or paralyze you, so let’s all agree to steer clear.”
“No, thanks,” he said, blinking at the food, then at Steve.
“Oh, come on,” Steve scoffs, and he looks just as nasty as Tony feels now, all jagged edges and open bleeding. “You say that like I’m looking for excuses to bolt, like I really just wanted to leave last time.”
“Magic fridge!” Scott yells when he comes in, amazed by the sudden appearance of food in the kitchen. Tony snorts.
Tony says, so loudly and suddenly that Steve pulls back in shock, eyes widening, even as Tony leans in and says, “Hold still.”
but.” A deep breath that hikes his shoulders up. “God, I’m astounded we made it so long after Ultron without something worse landing in our laps.”
As a plan, it’s not exactly foolproof. But it’s just about the only option they’ve got.
so here i am, two weeks late but armed with good excuses. two mondays ago i went to the gym for too long and made myself sick (not how it sounds--the rdj sherlock holmes movie came on while i was on the elliptical so i decided to stay and watch the whole thing, and then almost passed out in a chinese restaurant afterwards) and THEN i went to russia for a week. and now i'm back at school, just getting over a cold. i'm trying my best here.
“Forget about who’s responsible for it!” Steve says, and his voice is raised to match Tony’s. “What if I just don’t want you to feel like that?”
(Except Tony cares, and Tony caring about someone almost certainly curses them. But this is Steve.)
“That’s what I came out here for was some peace and quiet,” he says, but his heart really isn’t in it. “I just didn’t wanna be rude and kick you out right away.”
“Yeah, Nomad’s really been struggling, y’know, I think you’re slowing down in your old age.”
Tony shakes his head a little frantically despite his sore neck. He reaches forward with both hands suddenly to grab for Vision and ends up gripping the junction where his skull meets his neck. It’s a strangely intimate gesture, and not quite what he’d been aiming for, but Vision accepts it readily and slides forward, tractionless on the smooth floor, and folds his own arms around Tony’s shoulders. The pain is ebbing and the terror feels washed out, but he’s exhausted and doesn’t know if he could get off the ground even if the desire were stronger.
It’s enough for Steve to have some room to maneuver, but he’s only halfway through swinging the shield, and Tony’s trying to get his arm out from underneath him, when the Brood’s tail snaps forwards, into Tony’s hip. Not into the plating, but through it, into his hip. His throat closes on something that feels like a sob, and he brings his hand up to fire a careful, concentrated repulsor blast while Steve takes another defensive swing.
“Rogers called me, actually.” Rhodey makes his way over the the couch and drops down to Tony’s level, balancing on the balls of his feet. “So I’ve been laying with the dogs all day.”
The logical part of Tony’s brain is busy being proud of himself, for listening to his gut and knowing he wasn’t ready before, and for having enough respect for himself to be honest about that.
“I wasn’t the only one, you know. It takes two to fight,” he says quietly. The words are bullshit. Tony’s pretty sure even Steve knows how irrelevant a thing it is to point out at this stage in the game based on his voice; he sounds absolutely dejected, like he’s resigned himself to another screaming match or even another physical fight. Tony looks him square in the eyes when he answers.
“Hey, Cass,” Scott says, tilting the screen to get Tony in the shot, “guess who’s here?”
After another couple hours, people start filtering out. Sam, Scott, Bruce, Vision, Bucky. Eventually it’s Tony and Steve leaning against the kitchen counter talking to Nat and Clint, who are seated on the couch, Nat’s legs sprawled over Clint’s lap, and Wanda and Thor in the corner, having a conversation together.
“Good morning, Tony,” Vision says. Tony jerks back to reality to find that—no time has passed. Vision is still mid-pour at the sink, sharing a look with Tony.
“And the only reason Doom would be throwing a tantrum in New York is…” Tony prompts.
“Then we won’t keep you,” Steve says, and he looks at Tony out of the corner of his eye. “It sounds like you’ve got some more practicing to do.”
“JARVIS, wanna start up whatever’s next on the list?” Steve asks a couple minutes later.
“No it’s not!”
“Is Sam with you tonight?” Tony asks, and he sounds more serious now, concerned.
Steve’s smile widened, and then he was gone.
He steps forward, doing what felt impossible just seconds ago, and it’s like miniaturizing the arc reactor all over again, the feeling he gets putting his palm flat to Steve’s sternum. He keeps his elbow bent only slightly, connecting with Steve in a way that makes him real, human, warm—
“Mm-hm,” Tony mumbles, so Steve gets a tupperware container full of leftover Hawaiian pizza and three bottles of purple Gatorade, and brings them back to where Tony’s sitting exactly as Steve left him.
There’s a phone ringing suddenly. Shrilly and obnoxiously and Steve almost doesn’t realize that it’s his phone, the burner phone, until it’s too late. He thinks the TV, maybe, except Sam’s doing a crossword puzzle, the TV isn’t even on, and Steve’s out of the dining chair and vaulting over the couch to his room.
“Well…” Sam says, looks at Tony, and the both of them back away.
Tony clears his throat, and Steve hears something clinking together.
“What’s going on?” Tony asks again. He plants his feet wider and thinks of the suit down in the workshop. Steve sidesteps him and is suddenly inside.
Tony sighs into the sudden hush of the room.
“No,” Tony says, and it’s not even a real temptation.
“You’re a lunatic,” he says, but he looks more relaxed than Tony’s ever seen him, not that that’s saying much.
The next voice he gets is…Scott? Definitely Scott. He laughs, then speaks, sounding light. Tony catches the stray word, but gets distracted when he hears Vision. Vision’s tone doesn’t vary too much still, staying steady and calm but with varying degrees of gravity to it. There’s not much there now. There’s a fourth voice, unfamiliar to Tony, but tinny, it might just be a TV.
I’m so mad at you, Tony thinks. I hate you, and I want you to fix that, and I know that’s unfair, and I don’t really give a shit if it is or not. I ran out of words until this exact moment, or I thought I had, so what the fuck is this? Why won’t you stop haunting me? I know I have a huge karma debt, but why is this how I have to pay it? I’m so hurt, and it’s because of you, and I thought you were supposed to be better than this. How dare you be human, how could you be everybody else’s hero while stomping me into the ground. I wanted, so desperately, and I thought we actually were friends for a while there—I actually thought. I can handle that, Steve, I can get shit on and smile all the while, what I can’t handle is the pendulum effect: friends—enemies, hero—villain, wanted—disgusting, speaking—screaming—begging—fighting—fighting—fighting—
“About to collect some serious money from Fury, that’s what,” she says, not even looking at him. Steve grunts, tightens his grip around Tony, and stretches one foot out. Tony rolls his head around to look up at him.
“Tony,” he says, channeling what Tony and Clint call his Captain Voice. “Status report.”
“We,” Steve announces to the entire floor of Avengers, “are out of eggs.”
“I know you are,” Steve says, and it’s a little too close to condescending for Tony’s ease.
Clint
He starts a pot of coffee and pokes around in the fridge, snatching the remains of a frozen pizza to take with him. The muscles in his hand don’t cramp when he grabs both coffee mugs with it and the plate in the other hand, and his balance is impeccable. He hands one off to Bucky. Tony takes a seat in the armchair adjacent to Bucky’s couch, puts his coffee on the end table so it can cool, and puts the plate on his lap so he can start eating.
“More of a wait-and-see game, but yeah.”
“T’ny,” Steve says, and Tony’s less worried than he maybe should be. This version of Steve sounds almost exactly like the sleep-addled one, the slurring prominent, but at least he recognizes who Tony is.
thanks guys! i'm still on
“Me too.” Tony feels his eyebrows pinch together, and Clint’s frowning now. “You said he was lonely.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It comes from behind them, and when Steve turns he sees Sam occupying two waiting room chairs turned to face each other; he’s sitting in one and has his ankle propped up in another. That’s not what makes Steve pause, though. Rhodey’s there, too. He’s standing, pacing but trying to be sneaky about it, and he looks more pissed off than anything. Natasha’s there as well, standing behind the chair Sam’s sitting in, one hand braced on the back. She looks pained, gaze flickering to the door Tony’s behind, then to Bucky, and then settling on Steve.
“Hm,” Thor considers. Then, like it’s a guess, “A personal counsel.”
“Of course, thank you,” Tony says. T’Challa smiles as he cuts the connection. Tony swivels in his chair to face Steve fully. “What’s up?”
“Hey, Steve,” someone says from behind him, behind Bruce even.
“Then we’ll go home,” he says. Tony looks away, back down to the phone, and he’s just about to ask about it when the thing vibrates against the metal floor. Steve snatches it up and relays, “Nat says there’s a back entrance down the south hallway.” He looks back up again. “Think you can make it?”
“No!” Steve roars down the phone. Tony squeezes his eyes shut for an instant and Steve takes it as permission to go on. “I’m trying here. You could at least let me try.”
Tony’s mouth quirks up in a genuine smile, maybe his first since he’s woken up. He waits a few seconds to make sure Steve’s said his piece, and rocks back on his heels.
They’re both breathing hard when they roll to a stop, and Tony makes sure he’s braced to shield her from falling debris, even as he flips the faceplate up.
Rhodey doesn’t rise to the bait.
“No!” Steve says.
“Hawkeye and Iron Man,” Steve says, “set and keep a perimeter. Everyone else, let’s round ‘em up!”
Steve’s in there, too. He can hear the other man’s breathing (which is creepy on a couple different levels), but he could be asleep for all Tony’s knows.
“I’m fine,” Steve says and thinks, like hell I am. “I—is everything okay? What’s going on?”
Tony squeezes his ankle and very carefully does not think.
“Oh.” Tony pauses. “That? Civilians, Cap. And a Dalmatian, they’re very cute. You’d rather I let the dog die? That’s anti-American rhetoric at it’s finest.”
Steve stands up gracefully and reaches both his hands down to Tony. Honestly, he’s a little stiff from sitting on the ground and his ass is sore from his less-than-gentle landing, so he lets Steve haul him up. They stand there for a second, hands clasped, but it’s not exactly a Moment; Tony’s ass really does ache, and he needs to take a couple breaths before he can clear his throat and drop his hands. Steve lets him go but holds out an elbow. Feeling slightly surreal about it, Tony links their arms together and gives the rest of the balcony shifty eyes.
“Already on their way,” she replies.
“Just keep him calm and resting,” the nurse says to him as she pulls a privacy curtain around Steve’s bed in the ER. “With the accelerated healing, this is all just precautionary, but with the vomiting and how long he was unconscious, a CT is just standard procedure. Right now, we’re just waiting for a machine to free up.”
“That thing Zemo said?” Steve asks. “I’m sure in some lighting—”
“I’m gonna kill him,” Rhodey says low, under his breath, pacing more obviously now. Steve registers that he means Tony, not Clint. “No, shit, if this is still happening when Pep gets here all I have to do is not stop her—I can’t believe—”
It’s 11:19 when Pepper finally walks in, but Tony’s head is absolutely buzzing and he doesn’t turn to face her until she puts a hand on his shoulder even though he’s definitely aware of her presence.
It’s about checking, maybe. Though Steve’s not a machine he can run a diagnostic on, he’s not a robot to be put through the ringer to test his strength. Not an AI or a bot. But that’s not entirely right. After all, how often has Tony reminded himself, rather forcefully, that Steve’s a man, not some golden soul in a perfect body? Steve Rogers, not Captain America.
Bruce’s conflicted feelings about the entire thing are confusing both of them, and Tony doesn’t think Bruce’s point-of-view is entirely uncommon.
What’re you so afraid of, Stark?
“I’m not sayin’ you gotta sleep,” Sam says as he presses the call button for the elevator. “If you can’t, then…Just rest. Chill out. Night!” he calls as he turns.
“Good,” Rhodey says.
“You’re not the engineer here, Steve,” Tony says gently.
“Not exactly,” Sam says. Then, at Tony’s what-the-fuck look, “I was just stopping down to ask your doctor if you were up and at ‘em yet, but now I don’t have to.”
“Hell, man,” Rhodey says. “What’m I going to do with you?”
“Why, Boss,” FRIDAY says through the comm in the glasses, “people will think you’ve gone soft.”
“Okay,” Steve says, pretending to be all serious again, but Tony’s onto him, “focus, people.”
Steve makes another distressed sound, a hum, low in his throat but quieter than the other noises. Resigned and tired. They’re not holding hands anymore, but their hands are still touching, Tony’s pinky almost hooked around Steve’s thumb. He chances a slow swipe where they’re already touching, hoping it’ll be interpreted subconsciously as comfort instead of something to panic over.
“We kill the ones here as a message to the queen,” Steve says.
“I do, though.” Steve’s hands are so gentle, so careful. Tony can’t decide if he wants to bury his face in Steve’s hair or choke the life out of him, so he does neither. Steve’s voice is gentle, too, sad. “I’m not going to hurt you.”
hello, all! been a while.
“Just me,” Tony says, only engaging his vocal cords enough to get the barest hint of his voice behind the words. Steve hums, shuffles around, settles again.
“Yeah, well, the senior members mostly weren’t. Nat did press every now and then, of course, but. We haven’t been the best at communication and being actual teammates outside of combat.”
“I did,” Tony mutters, leaning back so he can fish his phone out of his jeans pocket. And he did, or FRIDAY should’ve done it for him. An automatic Priority Alerts Only setting for when it’s movie night, or he’s in a meeting, or anywhere he’ll get in trouble for it.
“I’m a goddess,” she tells them. Tony smiles. “Bow down to the mighty powers of the diplomat extraordinaire.”
“They got their X-ray,” Steve says. “A deal’s a deal.”
“Well, I don’t know if lovely is the word I would use, specifically, but…”
This is all—too much. It’s too much. The silence that stretches this time is awkward, and Tony feels like it’s his turn to say something, but what? What does Steve want from him here? For him to say
“Me too,” he says. And then, because it’s true but mostly because it’ll make Scott squirm, he says, “And, y’know, your old man’s one of the bravest weirdos I know, and a valuable asset to the Avengers, yadda, yadda, but I’m afraid there are just too many people wearing red these days, and I’ve gotta do something about it.”
“There’s nothing,” Bruce says, hand closed tightly around Tony’s wrist, keeping it away from the needle. Tony always forgets how strong Bruce can be in this form too. “It’s just for hydration, there’s nothing in it.”
“Just making sure you’re not fixin’ to poison me,” Tony says, willing it to sound like a normal worry.
When Tony uncovers his eyes, Steve’s still there, and this strikes Tony as a minor miracle for no particular reason.
“That will be all, Ms. Potts.”
“Second floor.”
“Damn, Cobain,” Tony says, “I was half-hoping His Kittiness would fill in the blanks, but that would be—yeah. I don’t know if ‘too easy’ is the phrase I’m looking for, but it would be too easy.”
“Tony?” he says. Tony realizes after a moment that he’s waiting for a reply.
Despite the interrupted sleep, Tony wakes early. Earlier than Steve anyway, if the way his hand rises and falls with someone else’s deep breaths is anything to go by. He takes his time waking, floating just on the edge of consciousness where everything is slow and peaceful and uncomplicated.
“What’s that noise?” Tony says. He cocks his head to the side—and when the hell did he become a dog—and, yeah, definitely from downstairs. Steve stays quiet for a few seconds and copies the head movement. He raises an eyebrow at Tony.
And, really, part of Tony wants to laugh at the shock of Steve Rogers coming onto him. But he doesn’t because Steve’s doing it
But even he knows that’s ridiculous. What he really wants was for them to have been ready for this conversation back then. He also knows neither of them were. Tony hadn’t gotten used to Steve being around again yet, and he sure as hell hadn’t trusted him. For his part, Steve didn’t yet understand what Tony was going through, or even quite have a handle on the whole respecting-Tony’s-boundaries thing. It would’ve been an unmitigated disaster, and Tony knows it, but he still can’t help wishing they’d done this sooner anyway. It feels like he’s wasted a lot of time being angry and defensive when he could’ve had this instead.
The thing is, he knows he’s right. He’s so sure that these changes need to be made, that something’s got to give here before they get a repeat of their so-called “war.” What he needs today is for people to be willing and ready to hear it. And that’s the crux of the issue: he has no control over what happens next beyond how he carries himself in the room. It’s the least fun kind of guessing game.
Peter looks from Tony to Steve and back, like he thinks it might be a trap.
“Right,” Steve says.
“A brilliant pain in the ass,” Tony says.
“Okay,” Tony says, “thoughts?”
There’s a humming sounds that kicks in then, and Tony cocks his head. His first thought is that it’s Steve’s phone, but the timbre is off and Steve doesn’t move to pick it up. The sound doesn’t seem to be coming from Tony’s own bedroom or bathroom behind him, and so he reaches out with his senses, out and around—down? It’s coming from below them, maybe, probably, and it sounds like—
“Hi, Tony,” she says, and drags her mouth up in an insincere smile.
“Fine,” Rhodey says, and takes the screwdriver away from Tony. “A couple of your house goblins went all the way down to the city in a jet just to get saag from that place in Queens.”
His hesitance to leave is the only reason he’s even still there when the call comes in. He’s sitting in Bryant Park, being invisible, sipping from a paper cup of coffee, and people watching when his phone trills. Not a ring, or a ping, or a vibration. A trill, which only happens when it’s urgent Avengers business. He digs it out quickly and presses it to his ear.
“Aw,” Clint says, “you do care.”
summary of scene involving gore: the alien is in fact wearing a human as a second skin. wanda's restraining it when tony enters, but tony jumps on it and holds it still as wanda looks inside its head. upon finding "no one home" tony decides that the human being is in fact effectively dead. he tells wanda to leave (she does) and kills the alien after a brief struggle.
Steve shrugs and Clint checks his watch.
It takes a while to find his body, and when he does he spends some time convincing it that he’s alive. He clenches the muscles in one shoulder, releases, and then the other. Then the same thing with his legs, until he’s almost rocking side to side in micro movements. He scrunches his nose, too. That tingling is still there. Numbness, kind of. A form of numbness.
“Tony,” Steve murmurs, and Tony can feel the word across his scalp, a warm breath of air from where Steve has his nose buried in Tony’s hair.
“I missed you,” Tony says, the words spill out of his mouth, and they’re not even the ones he means to say. Bruce pauses mid-drink. He swallows and lowers the mug, focusing squarely on Tony again.
“Good to be back,” Tony says, grins back with his hands in his pockets. He feels unfit for human interaction, strange, his skin still tingling and the lights are too bright. The world is pressing in on him, and these two—the veterans’ counselor and the master spy—will be able to tell. Even so, it’s not a lie. He’s glad he’s back, and happy to see them unharmed and okay.
“I don’t mean money or things,” Steve says, and he hasn’t let it drop, but at least he’s let go of that
“Had,” Tony corrects him, grinning.
By the time he brought Iron Man into existence, he was, if not a healthy adult, then at least a passably functional one. Or, one who could cope reasonably well enough for a few hours if he needed to pass as one. If nothing else, today he has to be able to show up and hold eye contact.
“Keeping tabs on me, old man?” he asks, but there’s no heat to it, only tiredness, and maybe the barest hint of fondness.
his brain replays.
“Depends on how you look at it,” Tony says.
“Steve was worried about you,” Bucky says after a couple of minutes. He’s cradling his still-too-hot-to-drink coffee to his chest, and his eyes have mostly been on his mug.
“Steve?” Tony asked.
“Right,” she says, and then starts counting off on her fingers. “Scarlett Witch, you, Vision, uh. Falcon, Daddy.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, “alright.” He looks at Bucky for a moment longer. “And maybe get some sleep in a real bed, Buck. You’re lookin a little rough.”
“But nothing,” Tony says firmly. “There is no ‘but.’ I’m trying to—not overthink. To just have a good time and not be a bitter bitch about it all and wonder why this was so impossible before, or assume they only like me right now because you visibly like me right now. I’m being
“That’s it?” Tony whispers. Steve tugs the knot of their hands closer and rests one of Tony’s knuckles against his own nose, and Tony scoots just a little closer to ease the awkward angle his arm is at. When Steve exhales, Tony can feel it down the side of his hand like a ripple of water.
“Go check it out,” he says. “Secure a perimeter, but don’t engage unless absolutely necessary.”
"Gee, thanks,” Tony says. “Must be all the emotional heavy lifting I’ve been doing lately.”
“What,” Steve says, a more normal volume, something light and teasing, “there’s something the great Tony Stark doesn’t know about space?”
“Um,” Peter says, after another short lapse of silence. His voice is pitched higher than normal, reminding Tony of the first time they met. “How would that work with—how would I—”
Tony thinks, so suddenly and fiercely he wouldn’t be surprised if Steve responded out loud. He doesn’t, of course. Tony has to breathe deeply through his nose as he rounds the next corner.
“Certainly, Boss,” she says. “Someone’s got to.”
“Right," Sam says, blinking down at his mug. “Carry on.”
“We’re just trying to lay some better groundwork for the team this time around,” Steve offers. “Along with some new resources available to help each other when we need it. And those resources will be available to you too, so you should probably know what they are.”
He says goodbye to Happy, makes a tentative promise to get down to the city next week sometime, and when he turns back around, Steve and Peter are peering under the hood of the car Tony’d been working on to calm his nerves.
Clint snorts and locks his muscles up as Tony engages the repulsors.
“That still doesn’t—”
“No risk of that around here at least,” he says.
note: addition of the "food issues" tag. it's not too bad, but if that sort of thing is hard for you, just be aware
“Aw, man,” he says, turning to the kitchen. He calls out, “Please tell me I didn’t miss the drag-Tony-for-wearing-shades-inside sess, because I could really use that today.” Then, facing Tony again, “Dude.”
Tony stops to think about that before answering. None of this is revelatory, not for Tony anyway. But it might be revealing that Steve recognizes it for what it was, that there were issues he could’ve been solving before the Accords fell into their laps. It’s probably even more revealing that he seems so incited by the events now, like the emotions are fresh. (Like he didn’t even notice any of this until recently.)
“Tired?” Tony asks quietly. Steve smiles like he’s got something to feel guilty about.
Tony curses. Any other arrow and he and Sam could go collect them from the ground, but the explosive arrows are a one-and-done kind of deal.
Steve flips his hand so he can twine their fingers together and squeeze for a moment, insistently.
Nat takes a sip of her coffee, looking happy and relaxed in her mismatched flannel pajamas; the bottoms are Clint’s, the shirt is Bruce’s, which doesn’t necessarily mean anything even though Tony wants to read into it. Natasha stole a few pieces of Bruce’s clothing while he was away. She steals everyone’s clothes, but it’s still heartwarming to see whenever she lets her guard down, sheds a piece of her armor.
There’s something heavy on his leg all of a sudden, so heavy he can’t move it. Going from how Steve pales and gasps, he can feel the weight, too.
“Yeah, Buck,” Tony simpers as Steve turns to follow Sam. Bucky looks about ready to sink through the floor, and like he’s trying very hard to appear unaffected. “You look like you could use the beauty rest.”
Tony looks at Steve, whose eyes are glazed but watching the encounter nonetheless. He doesn’t offer input either way, so Tony decides to take that as permission.
“I think…” Tony says, “it might be the fridge on the common level.”
Truthfully, Steve doesn’t know if a lullaby will be soothing or frustrating to Hulk at this point, not after how things went down between Bruce and Natasha in Sokovia, but he wants her close in case it’s just a run-of-the-mill injury and Tony refuses help. She’s always been best at reasoning with him and getting him to accept what he needs. Mostly, he’s keeping Clint because the man looks about four seconds from total collapse. He and Tony also have a weird, tailor-made bro code where medical assistance is concerned.
Tony lasts two more days.
“You know what that was.” Tony raised an eyebrow and Steve looked like he had half a lemon in his mouth.
“It’s just…” Peter says, voice hushed. “That video looked really bad, Mr. Stark.”
“It is! I never saw him care about you until after Chicago.” She takes a deep breath and is a more appropriate volume when she speaks again. “Do you remember what you looked like when they brought you back to the states? After he
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says softly. Tony opens his eyes to see Steve smiling in the soft light from the lamp. He has a corner of the comforter in his hand and flaps it demonstratively when Tony looks over. “Scoot over.”
“That’s a whole other conversation,” Bruce says dismissively, now holding his coffee in one hand and prodding at his specimen with the other. It’s a veritable disaster waiting to happen, and Tony just hopes Bruce isn’t working with anything too toxic. “My anger towards you is one thing, but it’s got nothing on how livid I still am with Rogers.”
“I, uh,” he says. “Steve and I, we’re—or, at least, I’m pretty sure, I think—”
“Look, Captain America will even vouch for me.” And he flips the phone to speaker. “I’m okay, right, Cap?”
“Dark-Hoodie Jesus!” Tony greets because, really, standing there with his pinned hoodie sleeve, the long hair, and open expression, no other words will even come to mind. He tilts his head after the nicknames leaves his mouth, considering. “Huh. You really need a haircut—but! That’s definitely not why I asked for your presence in my humble abode.”
“Up to trouble, I hope?” Tony says.
Damn, Tony thinks. No such luck there.
“You're still not speaking,” Steve says. He blinks and a couple tears spill over because of course, of course the universe couldn’t even give Tony a small break. Sam looks alarmed and like he wants to help, but doesn’t know what to
“My money’s on Nat.”
“It’s nice to—” he makes a vague gesture, rocking to lean back on only one elbow, “—get along with everyone.”
“Where’d you learn so much about the stars anyway, Captain City Boy?” Tony says, trying to regain control of the situation.
“Natasha’s right,” Bruce says, looking small and miserable. “Unless Tony’s changed it more than we already had.” He grimaces. “There should be more safeties in place than when Killian was using it, at least.”
“Good, good—I’m glad he’s doing better.”
Steve’s different. Has been for a while. They’ve fought side-by-side too, and it feels just as natural to anticipate each other’s moves on the battlefield. But they’re not brothers. Steve and Tony don’t run as deep as Tony and Rhodey do, not yet, but they burn hot. Rhodey’s a moat, deep and wide and surrounding, protective, a buffer against the rest of the world, and Steve’s a channel of molten lava, blazing a path, making scars.
“I think I’ll live, though I might have to crash on the floor.” He tries to laugh, to make that sound more like a joke, but he can’t tell how close he gets to the mark. “That honestly doesn’t even sound like such a hardship at the moment.”
Tony Stark is a man of forward momentum, a self-proclaimed futurist. At the same time that he’s telling himself to suck it up and get on with his life, to accept this for what it is so he can move on to whatever shitshow is inevitably next, this feels like going backwards. This looks like the Merchant of Death staring back at him, feels like he’s lost something precious. Dark hair, dark eyes, smooth skin. He looks
“Keep up. That’s why it’s a compromise.”
Before, when everyone had just returned, Tony had felt so out of place and so unwanted. Things are still weird now, but at least he doesn’t feel so despised in his own home.
and another thanks to everyone leaving comments and still following this story! it's all very dear to me
“You should’ve seen what he did out there,” Steve says. “He made his armor—” He swallows, blinks again, tries to clear himself of the burning tears he can feel trying to make their way out. “He made the armor dump him behind a building when it became clear he probably wouldn’t make it, and then had his AI fly back into battle as he just…as he laid there thinking he was going to die.”
“I’m here,” Tony says at the same time. It doesn’t make anything worse, the touch and the words, so he does it a couple more times before Steve flexes around him—different, though, he thinks. Not so much terror-fueled agitation as testing the muscles. A sharper inhale, and then—
Either way, when Tony wakes up, it’s to his empty bed and the residual comfort of Steve having been there. Tony can
“Falcon, make your way up to the Quinjet,” he says. “We’ll wait for you. Vision, Thor, Wanda, Scott. Stay behind with T’Challa to get those things off-world. We’ll see you in a bit.”
“I am,” Tony whispers. Then, louder, angrier, “I’m trying. You know I’m not just being difficult for the sake of it, right? I was there and I was trying. Hell, I still am, Rogers, I just needed to breathe.”
“You’re not on anything,” Bruce confirms.
“That’s…nifty,” he says.
“I’m fine.”
“Yep,” he says, “too many. Something’s gotta give, and it’s not gonna be me. Red was mine first.”
