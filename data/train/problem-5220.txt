“Do you need to urinate?”
Cas swallows, he wishes he didn’t have to tell Dean this at all. He knows the outcome is only going to be nuclear. He takes a steadying breath, “You don’t have a diaper on right now, sweetheart.”
It’s fine though. Dean didn’t need to pull into whatever grimy rest stop was closest. It was a waste of time. He could hold it. He was fine.
His spirit lifted and feeling rather devious Dean climbs onto Cas’ lap. He grinds their crotches together his diaper so wet the sloshing is audible. Cas is so hard Dean can feel him through both of their thick sleep pants and his diaper. He feels rather proud that he was the reason Cas got so worked up.
Cas could usually tell when Dean had to pee. Dean had some tells that he never really learned how to hide. The way he gripped the steering wheel just a bit tighter the usual being the most obvious one. Lately, though Dean’s been announcing when he had to pee and it sent electric waves right to Cas’ crotch every time he did.
It feels hot and slick inside him. It drives Dean crazy in the best way possible. Cas tongue fucks him until he’s in tears begging to cum.
“You shouldn’t have to,” Dean argues. “It’s my mess.”
Dean groans, his stream lightening to a trickling halt, “Fuck, Cas. It’s so warm.”
They crinkled in his hands and smelled a little weird. It took him a minute to figure out how to get them on while standing up. Of course, Cas had to get him the kind with adhesive strips and not just the kind he could pull up. God, this was humiliating. If only his stupid brain wouldn’t send him to a fucking panic attack at the thought of just taking a God damn three minute break.
“Your turn?” Dean asks his hands already going for Cas’ fly.
The padding is just soaking it all up too. Dean can feel it growing under his jeans. It leaves goosebumps all over his skin.
“You’re so naughty Dean,” Cas teases. “Pissing your diaper right in the middle of the store. What if that poor cashier caught you.”
"Th-thank you. Hold my hand," Dean croaks. He's fully seated on Cas' cock his knees splayed at either side of Cas' thighs and his left hand secured firmly in Cas'. He lets out a sharp gasp as he finally lets his bladder go. Cas uses his free hand to rub Dean's crotch feeling the padding as it grows sodden.
“You should go now,” Cas whispers through the phone. Dean feels his neck flush and his stomach flutter. “There’s no need to worry, sweetheart. No one will notice and I’ve gotten you only the most absorbent padding so you won’t leak.”
“Thank you,” Dean says softly, tiredly. He’s exhausted.
“Are you doing okay?” Cas asks his voice huskier than usual. Perfect. Everything was going exactly as Dean had planned. All Dean needed to do was get Cas hot and bothered before leaving him all alone to take care of his little problem himself. Just like Dean had had to do.
“I do not make you wea-“ Castiel cuts himself off. He doesn’t want to argue. Dean is clearly overtired and embarrassed. It’s best to just let him cool off alone for a minute.
He kisses Cas deeply sucking on his bottom lip. Cas grabs at his thickly padded ass clutching the material roughly. Dean sucks at Cas’ neck leaving a wet red mark before moving his lips to Cas’ ear.
Dean seems to finally understand and his eyes go wide and he shoots up suddenly more awake than ever.
‘Guess that’s why you’re in diapers,’ Dean thinks bitterly.
Cas had been there for Dean through every step in this weird diaper wearing process. He’s enjoyed every step of it too, that freaky little angel. Dean can’t complain though he’s enjoyed a lot of it. But Cas has had to bear the brunt of Dean’s insecurity and today Dean wants to make his thanks known.
“Yeah’ ‘M in line,” Dean says. He’s behind a mom with a baby sitting in the cart. The baby is cute, friendly, she’s babbling and flailing her hands. Dean tries to not make eye contact with her but she keeps looking at him and waving. It’s like she knows.
“Diapers,” Cas states simply.
“Hello, Dean. You said to call with any updates,” Cas reminds him as though he needs an excuse to call.
“Yes,” Cas’ deep voice says, clearly amused. “Jack would like these pants.”
"Then what is?" Cas questions and he just sounds so caring it makes Dean want to melt.
“Oh! Rocky,” Comes Sam’s voice. He comes into view, all 7ft and dumb looking hair of him, and sits himself on the recliner by the couch. “Love this movie.”
“What the fuck!” He shouts.
It seems to be working. He’s bucking into Dean’s mouth more rough than usual. He really did get worked up. That makes Dean feel incredibly pleases. It was the reassurance he didn’t know he needed. Cas finds him sexy like this, diapered, so it must be okay. He hums a little louder and works his hand faster. Cas won’t last long now.
The final step in his plan involves him finishing off the remains of the water bottle and putting on the diaper he altered especially for tonight. It's the same thick white diaper he's grown accustomed to wearing lately but he's cut out a decent sized hole right where his asshole is. His bladder pulses needily and he gives a longing glance towards the toilet before he tapes the diaper in place. He checks in the mirror if the cutout lines up with his hole and sure enough, the outline of the blue plug is a stark contrast to the white fluff of the diaper. Goosebumps raise up on his skin and he rushes to his phone to text Cas to get his butt to their room stat.
Dean white knuckles the steering wheel and glares at the road.
“Dean,” Cas pleads. “You’re hurting. Please, just let go.”
Cas asks him that right as he’s walking through the sliding doors an employee smiling at him greeting him. He pays extra attention to the employee’s eyes if they’re shifting near his ass. If they give any sign they know. It doesn’t seem like they do but that does nothing to ease his paranoia.
“Oh, God. Oh, God,” Dean moans. “Please. Yes, I want to cum in my diaper. I want to be good.”
“I see,” He hums. He lays down next to Dean, placing his hand on the small of the other man’s back. Instantly, Dean feels his pain subside and he knows Cas has healed him.
"S-st-stop," He stutters. "Wanna piss when you're inside me."
“H-how do you wanna do this?” Dean croaks, his throat dry and sticky. He bites nervously at his lower lip the diaper still clutched in his grip.
“Mmhm,” Dean hums. He squeezes his thighs together with only slight dramatization. Cas’ toungue darts across his lips his eyes never leaving Dean’s crotch. Dean had begun to wonder if angel’s hand x-ray vision for how intensely Cas was staring at his blanket covered crotch.
“I’m fine,” He says, choosing to fib a bit. He doesn't need Cas up his ass about his health.
Cas warms the oil up in his hands before gently kneading his hands up and down Dean’s back. He’s gotten pretty proficient at massage thanks to several YouTube tutorial videos. He advises Dean to take a few deep breaths as he applies light pressure.
“No,” Cas answers like it was a sincere question. “But I am concerned for you. Holding your urine in for long periods of time is not healthy.”
“Ugh, fuck!” Dean shouts. He snatches the packet of diapers from Cas and stands up. “Fine. Just for today. But I’m not letting you change me.”
“B-but the mess,” Dean says miserably.
“When’s the last time you wet?” Cas asks him. Dean’s fingers squish the pear pie box a little too roughly at the question.
Dean has the perfect night planned for him and Cas. He set up the living room for a cozy movie night. Cas’ favorite extra soft sherpa throw blanket was slung over the couch just waiting for them to cuddle under. It was an ugly bright yellow color but Cas loved it so Dean tolerated it’s hideousness.
Dean's overstimulated cries is what does Cas in and he releases deep inside Dean with a shouted moan. He rolls off Dean and lets Dean snuggle in next to him, both still panting hard.
Cas just takes Dean’s hand in his and gives it a reassuring squeeze.
“Dean,” Castiel says gently.
“Cas?” Dean croaks voice hoarse. He lets his bladder pulse gently before releasing a short spurt. The warmth is an immediate contrast to the cold damp already settled in the padding.
The diaper slowly warms under Cas’ hand as Dean releases his bladder. They feel twin shudders as the crinkly material expands.
"You can go Dean," Cas whispers.
"Are you okay?" Cas questions noticing Dean gripping his diapered crotch.
Dean scoffs rolling his eyes, “You sound like Sam.”
“You’re such a good boy Dean.”
“Really?” Dean asks looking for assurance.
“I just want you to feel good,” Cas informs him. “You deserve it. I think I have an idea too.”
“No. You don’t,” Dean grits out.
"Oh, fuck," Cas curses moving his hand away quickly. "That's so hot, Dean."
"I love you too," Cas says softly. He pulls out slowly and turns Dean around to face him. Dean's face is red and tear-streaked. "You're such a good boy."
“Well, if everything is in order I’m ready for movie night,” Cas announces. He takes a step forward, crowding Dean’s personal space. “And I can see you’re prepared. Wearing a diaper for movie night is very smart. You won’t have to miss anything.”
Now that Dean's bladder has been voided he can finally focus on the intense pleasure Cas is giving him. Each thrust is hitting his spot expertly and his dick is straining inside his diaper begging to cum. Cas begins kneading the front of his diaper the thick padding giving Dean's cock even more friction, even more pleasure.
“Oh, Dean!” Cas moans his hands in Dean’s hair. “You’re s-so good.”
Dean shivers, squirming in his seat relishing how the warm wet padding feels against his skin. Against his cock, “It’s s-so, so warm. It feels good.”
Cas flushes a bit embarrassed to be called out. “I may have come across some websites that were less than appropriate when I was researching ways to help you last night.”
Dean paws at his hand jokingly, "You freak."
With Sam having cleared the room Dean finally lets himself relax. His piss starts flowing freely, burning hot as it completely drenches his diaper. It feels horrible.
“Go get cleaned up then lay on the bed,” Cas commands gently. “Naked. You worked hard these past few days you deserve a treat.”
“Don’t you want to cum in your diaper?” Cas asks cheekily as he makes quick work of taping the diaper shut. He can feel shudder underneath him as the front padding makes contact with his erect penis. “Like a good boy?”
He let Cas cuddle him all through the night. Let the angel rub his back and whisper sweet nothings in his ear. He loved cuddling usually. When they were at home, at the bunker, but when he was on a case he preferred to just be left alone. Well, not alone, but he didn't usually let Castiel get so close to him it fucked with his headspace. Cas understood, or at least he acted like he did for Dean's sake and always managed to keep his displays of affection to verbal gestures or extremely intense looks. He broke the unspoken rules that night though and Dean let him. Focusing on Cas' touch was better than focusing on the soggy diaper wrapped up in a plastic grocery bag in the motel trashcan. They had made it to their destination anyway he didn't need to worry about it anymore. Not until the next case that is.
“There’s no reason to hold it, Dean,” Cas tells him. “No one is going to know but me.”
Dean grumps intensely at that last bit. He didn’t want to be insecure about them. He wanted to wear them and use them and not have feel constant guilt or fear over being exposed. He could do this. Besides, Cas’ attempts at dirty talk were kind of hot.
Cas chuckles at him placing a hand against his bladder and rubbing in small circles. Dean nearly collapses when he groans at the touch.
“I just pissed myself,” Dean spits out the confession like it’s a dirty secret.
“No,” Cas agrees. “You’re not. I just know it was difficult for you last time. Dealing with the straps.”
Luckily, there was a Wegmans off the exit. Dean listened to Cas chat about some Netflix show Jack had him watching as he looked for a parking spot.
"You're so perfect, Dean," Cas cries. His balls tensing up signaling his orgasm. "You feel so amazing around me. So warm and tight."
Cas has at least tried to be sympathetic having picked up on Dean’s paranoia. The angel rubs a calming hand across his back and whispers about how he’s doing such a good job.
“No, it’s not weird,” Castiel assures Dean. “It is totally normal. Some people want to be changed straight away, but others like the feeling of a wet diaper.”
One particular bad cramp makes Dean jolt and Sam gives him a funny look.
Cas is sitting on the edge of the bed cradling a square plastic wrapped package that looks suspiciously like adult diapers.
“Mmph,” Dean groans as he flops over again. “That’s gonna be a bitch to clean.”
Dean sighs contently, "Yeah, I guess we are."
With a smirk he whispers, “Payback.” He gyrates his hips once more before scampering out of the room leaving Cas absolutely wrecked and alone on the couch.
Dean’s legs are shaking with the need to piss and with the desire to just be able to let go, but he can’t. He can’t make himself. It’s just not natural.
“Yea-yeah,” Dean answers. He can always hear the crinkling. No matter how many times Cas reassures him it’s not noticeable. “It’s loud.”
Dean sits down and moans at the feeling of the soggy diaper mushing against his skin. It’s still warm and envelops Dean’s bottom like a little hug.
This was supposed to be fun. He just wanted to feel sexy and have a nice time. He just wanted to tease Cas a little in a way he knew they both loved. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.
Dean’s eyes are watery and he’s sucking his lower lip in like he’s trying to keep from crying.
“Fuckin’ hell, man,” Dean laughs exasperatedly. “Don’t call it urinating. Just say piss.”
"Guess I'll put you out of your misery," Cas says. Dean hears the lid of the discarded lube bottle snap open and he nearly rejoices. Cas slowly edges the tip of his cock at Dean's hole circling his hips and teasing him.
The movie is nearing the end when it happens. Cas’ ministrations proving to be maybe a bit too calming having relaxed Dean enough that he temporarily relaxes his bladder. Warm urine spills into his padding with an audible hiss. Dean goes ram rod straight and gasps. He manages to stop the stream, tightening his muscles with as much force as he can.
"It's too much," Dean cries hiding his face in Cas' neck. "It's gonna leak."
There was a soft knock on Dean's door as he was packing up his duffle. Cas peaked his head inside announcing his appearance before making his way to sit beside Dean on the bed.
“Fuck,” Cas gasps. He’s snuck his hand into Dean’s sleep pants and is massaging the sodden material. “That was so hot.”
Dean sleeps soundly for ten hours straight when he wakes up with a familiar twinge in his bladder. He cuddles into Cas who has been diligently sat by his side occupying himself with his iPad. He tugs Cas’ hand away from his CandyCrush game and puts it on his crotch.
“Yeah, well I never wanted to be one of them!” Dean shouts working himself up over his shame and embarrassment over getting off on the act.
Dean flushes and takes a moment to really observe Cas. The angel is flushed, his lips swollen from biting at them, and he looks so proud.
With one hard thrust Dean's orgasming into his diaper his lips desperately finding Cas' to kiss him as he releases. Cas kisses him back eagerly thrusting frantically into him trying to find his own release.
He wraps his fingers around Cas’ cock gently jerking him as he suckles the tip. Cas always tastes so sweet. He hums around Cas’ dick something he knows drives his boyfriend crazy.
“C-can I ask for one more thing?” Dean asks shyly.
He pulled his jeans up over the padding and checked the mirror once more to see how obvious it was he had a fucking diaper on. To his surprise he couldn’t even tell. The crinkling when he moved however. It sounded horrendously loud to him.
Dean flushes brightly glad no one is in the car with him to see him transform into a tomato. He clears his throat nervously, “Yes.”
“I-I uh,” Dean stutters fidgeting with the car keys still in the ignition. “Okay. Should I stay on the line.”
“Yes, don’t hang up.”
Cas would put a hand over Dean’s crotch and feel as the diaper grew warm and slowly expanded under Dean’s jeans. It was always a struggled to pull his hand away and not give into the urge to rub Dean to orgasm. He didn’t want to get them into the habit of unsafe driving.
The next part of his plan involved a lot of lube and the giant butt plug Cas liked. Cone-shaped with soft silicone and pleasant blue color. It doesn’t matter how many times Dean shoves it up his ass it’ll always look daunting.
“Very much” Castiel nods eagerly.
He dresses himself in a worn t-shirt and his favorite sleep pants with little cartoon hot dogs on them. Underneath his comfy hot dog pants was a white fluffy diaper. The extra thick kind that drove Cas wild. The padding crinkled loudly underneath his loose pants making him blush even though he was still all alone in his bedroom.
Castiel and Dean have learned a lot about each other since Dean’s started wearing diapers during their trips. Dean learned that Cas really loved to watch Dean lose control in his diaper and Cas learned that Dean really loved to let Cas know when he was about to lose control.
Cas’ eyebrows shoot up to his hairline, “You, you want to?”
“Cas, I can’t stop,” Dean groans. “I can’t.”
“Just keep driving Dean,” Cas demands. His rubbing has picked up the pace and Dean’s pretty sure he’s never felt so aroused before. It almost makes him feel sick.
Cas fixes him with a look that tells him he's being an utter dumbass but wraps him up in his arms nonetheless. He places gentle kisses to Dean's skin rubbing his nose along his neck.
Just the thought of taking a break makes Dean’s skin crawl. He knows it’s irrational, that a few short stops to just take a God damn piss are ultimately inconsequential, but what if they aren’t? What if life or death for some poor sap is determined by those few seconds? It makes him feel nauseous.
“Yeah, baby?” Cas’ voice comes out just as wrecked. “You going?”
“I’m fine,” Dean grumps, flopping face down on the bed. “Besides, I’m not stopping. I’ve got places to be.”
It started normal enough.
Kisses are peppered against Dean’s skin. First on the back of his neck, then by his ear, then the small of his back. Cas places his lips lower and lower until he’s right at the cleft of Dean’s ass.
“Thanks,” Dean grins softly.
“Oh my God,” Dean gasps. His breathing is heavy and he blinks multiple times trying to focus on the road. “I’m okay. I’m okay. Drive Dean. Just drive.”
“Are you at the checkout?” Cas inquires.
Dean’s quick to snatch a small bottle of white pepper from the spice aisle his hands only slightly shaking.
He gets back on the bed positing himself so he's face down with his ass up towards the door. His cock is so hard it's peaking out the band of his diaper and he has to push it back down.
“Oh, God,” Dean repeats hips already moving. He humps against the bed his dick rubbing against the soft thick padding of his diaper. The precome oozing from his slit assisting in that entrancing feeling. He’s never felt anything like this. It’s almost like fucking a girl but something about it feels so much better and that scares Dean a little.
The hunt had ran a little longer than they planned and was a lot more difficult to handle than they first assumed. Hunting with an angel at your side usually helped to quicken the pace but the demon they went after proved extra tricky. Dean was currently running on nothing but coffee and 5 Hour Energy shots having barely slept in the past 72 hours. He looked absolutely miserable.
They both learned that Dean loved wearing the diapers and it wasn’t long before Dean was even wearing them on the trip back to bunker too. In fact, he had one on right now.
Dean snorts softly absorbing the words. Yeah, his life was pretty weird that wasn't a surprise. Maybe, putting it into perspective made it sound... Okay. He fiddles with a button on his flannel.
"Glad you think so," Dean laughs. "Want this to be good for you."
“Dean keep your voice down,”’Castiel advises. He can tell Dean wants to scream at him, to shout, to throw his chair right in Cas’ face. “If you yell you’ll wake up Sam and Jack. You don’t want them to see you like this do you?”
“No, you’re not,” Cas tells him evenly. “I can smell the infection on you.”
Dean does as he’s told and once the padding is under him he lets himself slowly relax down on top of it. Oh. He can’t help the gasp that escapes his lips. This diaper is definitely fluffier than the last one. His dick twitches just at the feeling of it caressing his ass.
Dean’s mouth is dry and he has to smack his lips together a few times before he can even form an answer, “Y-yeah.” Eloquent.
Dean tenses under his touch and with one final loud moan cums right into the front of his diaper.
"Do you want to put this on before we go?" Cas asks. And yup. He's pulled out a diaper from the confines of his coat. Dean flushes red and ducks his head trying to at least act like he's searching the duffle for something.
“Are you okay, man?” Sam asks. Dean’s entire body heats up red hot.
"Gonna cum," Dean moans.
“Cas,” Dean whispers. “Please, don’t.”
Cas shushes him gently, “You are. Remember to breathe evenly, sweetheart.”
The first night was the worst for Dean. The first night after using a diaper during the day that is. He could barely sleep that night his stomach tossing and turning with feelings of guilt and shame. He shouldn't have enjoyed it as much as he did. Scratch that. He shouldn't have enjoyed it all. Despite Cas' best attempts at reassurance he still felt like a sick fuck.
“C’mon sweet boy,” Cas encourages. He moves the hand on Dean’s butt a little lower massaging Dean’s balls through the diaper. “Tell me.”
“You were stunning.”
"Look at you," Cas says in awe. He can hear the shuffle of Cas shucking his clothes off as fast as he can. His footsteps are getting closer and then his hands are on Dean's ass rubbing it through the padding. "You look beautiful, sweetheart."
“What the fuck, Cas!” Dean repeats his voice softer but just as infuriated.
“I just pissed in a diaper,” Dean whispers to himself. “Fuck, Cas. I just pissed in a diaper and came from it. That can’t be normal.”
“My ass is sweaty,” Dean complains.
“Is it weird I even kinda like it now,” Dean whispers. “Now that it’s all cold and stuff.”
Dean’s grown hard in anticipation, his fingers curling in the sheets. He gasps when Cas’ hands open his cheeks revealing his pucker.
“Well, your brother is quite intelligent,” Cas chuckles fondly. “I’m sure he’s told you many times you aren’t taking enough breaks during your driving.”
Dean’s hesitant to stand up and drop his drawers which is absurd as Cas has seen him naked on numerous occasions. Hell, Cas has had his dick in his mouth. He really shouldn’t be so nervous but he just can’t help it he is. He undresses with shaky hands and flops down on his back on the bed. He bends his knees and flexes his toes against the covers.
The two sit nearly on top of each other curled up under the ugly yellow blanket on the couch. The only light in the room coming from the television screen. Dean had made good progress with the snack devouring nearly half the bowl of popcorn on his own. He had made even better progress on the drinks. He had managed to guzzle down a liter and a half of the sweet fizzy drink and was definitely beginning to feel it in his bladder.
There was an erlking terrorizing children in rural Pennsylvania. Dean decided to take this one on his own as it didn’t seem too dangerous. According to Sam the lore stated erlkings could only harm children and seeing as he’s a grown-ass man and not a child he made the decision to let everyone else have a relaxing few days off. Besides, he liked hunting solo occasionally. It was one of the very few times he got to be completely alone. It may seem a tad deranged but it was relaxing.
“I’m gonna cum. I’m gonna cum,” Dean chants wildly.
“Uh. May-Maybe,” Dean begins. He makes the mistake of looking into Cas’ eyes while trying to speak and the earnest expression sends a chill down his spine. Cas just wants to help him in any way possible. “Maybe, just this time. You can help. To see how I feel?”
He flicks his tongue out again licking over Dean’s hole before circling it with his tongue. He swirls around it expertly, tasting the soap Dean used in the shower and the taste that is uniquely his own. Dean is moan softly humping into the mattress trying to retrieve more friction on his aching unattended dick. He grips his cheeks harder pulling them wider apart allowing Cas to get deeper into his hole.
Cas kneads his palm against Dean’s crotch eliciting those lovely moans from his diapered boyfriend. He didn’t expect Dean to react this way. To love it so much. He fully expected Dean to just give up and pull over to use the bathroom at a gas station or in some wooded area on the side of the road. This though, this was truly surprising and Dean deserved a treat for being so good.
And the next case did come. Somehow, Castiel managed to weasel a way into getting Sam to stay at the bunker with Jack so it would just be him and Dean. Sam gave off five flavors of confused expressions but didn't question them too thoroughly. Dean's almost certain Sam thinks that the "case" is just an excuse for Dean and Castiel to go off and have sex privately. If only it was.
“My diaper!” Dean shouts, his body growing rigid. It’s all too much. The diaper is warm and slick with precome. Cas is right there kneading his balls and holding his hand. Keeping him safe. It’s overwhelming. “I’m coming in my diaper!”
“My beautiful boy,” Cas hums, his breath hot against Dean’s sensitive skin. He places gentle kisses against Dean’s hole, soft, barely there.
Dean awakens from a truly blissful dreamless sleep. He hasn’t slept that well in a long time. And right now he’s really wishing he never woke up.
“Nah, no keep going,” Dean says. “Please.”
Dean lets out an undignified whine suddenly becoming all too aware of the thick padding between his legs, “Yeah. ‘M wet.”
“Good boy,” Cas tells him, his voice sounding like gravel.
“I’m so glad you’re feeling enthusiastic,” Cas responds drily.
“Okay, so I just need to lure him out with what - a pie in an animal trap?” Dean questions with a chuckle. He has a vivid image of a fresh cherry pie luring the creature into the contraption like a Looney Toons cartoon.
“A little but I’m fine for now,” Dean bites his lower lip and evades eye contact. He’s being very obvious in his lie.
“Dean, it’s okay. It was just an accident,” Cas ensures. He takes a step forward but stops in place when Dean cowers backwards.
“So, bladder infections are a common occurrence for you?” Castiel questions.
Dean bites his lip, almost nods before he remembers he’s on the phone, “Yeah.”
Dean harumphs throwing the Impala’s door open. He knows he won’t leak and Cas just told him he wouldn’t either. His angel is just being mean on purpose now and it’s sending jolts of electricity to Dean’s cock.
Cas is the one who picks up on it first, of course. The two are on a hunting trip with just themselves; Sam off on a separate endeavor with Eileen. They just pulled into a motel for the night and gotten settled in their room.
It’s only a few hours into their trip when Castiel starts to notice the tell tale signs of Dean’s desperation. He’s subtle that’s for sure. His brow grows the slightest bit harder, his hands clutch the steering wheel a bit tighter, and he starts to tap his left foot to the beat of the music. It’s no surprise he has to go. He’d guzzled down three coffees before they even left the motel.
“Mm, Cas,” Dean groans, he squirms a bit in his seat before releasing his bladder. “‘M peein’.”
“Why don’t you go get cleaned up while I make you something to eat,” Castiel suggests knowing Dean would much rather immediately go to sleep without so much as taking his shoes off let alone his diaper. Sitting in a wet diaper for too long was just no good on anybody’s skin.
"Hi, baby," Dean answers shyly.
"Dean, your entire life is abnormal," Cas tells him. "You hunt monsters for a living. You've died multiple times. Not to mention, you've entered a long term relationship with an angel of the Lord. Wearing diapers is probably the most normal thing you've ever done."
“Hm, you like this Dean?” Cas asks. His pupils are blown out with lust and his voice has taken on that husky tone he reserves for bedroom activities. “Having your diaper changed?”
“N-need ta’ cum,” Dean moans. “Ca-Cas puh-lease.”
Dean nods hesitantly, “Yeah, I’m fucking exhausted. I want to be able to relax and just you know having to get up, turn on the lights, and all that shit to just take a piss messes with your REM cycle or whatever... You don’t have t-“
Castiel can't help the way his hips stutter upward as the hissing of Dean releasing his bladder grows audible. "You're so hot, baby," He moans.
The coffee table is set up with snacks and drinks a plenty. A bowl of popcorn slathered in butter sat beside another bowl full of pretzels. A giant yellow bag of peanut M&Ms was perched between the two. With all the salty snacks Dean knew he would need something sweet to compliment it. He also knew he would be needing plenty of fluids. That’s where the two two liter bottles of soda came in. Dean squirms a little just thinking about his plan.
He taped the diapers around his waist and chanced a look in the mirror. He looked absurd in a stark white diaper that made his butt look poofy. But, it didn’t feel that bad. The diaper was soft and fluffy. It was like getting a little hug around his bottom. It felt safe.
Cas is fully erect and dripping when Dean manages to pull him out of his pants. He’s beautiful. He squirms his body across the bed until he manages to get his lips around Cas’ cockhead. Cas never liked getting deepthroated, what he loved was having his head played with.
Cas just pursed his lips. “You’re right,” he said on an exhale, turning to stare out the front window. “It’s burning up again. I thought I would have more time, but the decay… it’s much faster this time.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Cas stand straighter, leaning towards Ramiel. “How?”
He scoffed. “Or it could kill us.”
They were standing in a small diner, nautical images scattered along the walls, a quiet murmur of indistinguishable conversation and the clatter of dishes providing a steady soundtrack. It took a moment for Dean to get his bearings, but the moment he recognized their surroundings, he fought the urge to be sick. It was the place he and Cas had eaten at a little over a week ago (and Jesus, it felt like it’d been at least triple that). He’d shooed Sam away to give himself the opportunity to ask Cas to kill him (and, if he’s being honest, out of no small amount of fear that the bitch would bring up Destiel or Casdean whatever the hell he wanted to call it just to fuck with Dean), but he hadn’t anticipated just how much it’d feel like, well, a
There were no sigils or runes to be painted, no ingredients to be amassed, no specific timing they had to wait for, only a small incantation that took Cas less than two minutes to memorize. The lack of buildup felt anticlimactic and far too quickly finished, giving Dean no time to gather his thoughts as they headed down to the dungeon, where they’d decided would be the smartest place to perform the spell. He felt like he hardly had the chance to catch his breath between giving in and Cas’s firm, “I’m ready.”
Even to Sam, it’s weak, and he can’t blame Cas for the way his face falls, just a little, just for a moment. It’s replaced almost as quickly with something fierce and familiar, Castiel the soldier making his reappearance. “What do
Right. Well. Might as well jump into it then. He clapped his hands together, affecting a somewhat strained smile. “So, uh, Cas said you may know something about the Mark of Cain?”
want?”
Sam reluctantly let go, but his grin was still firmly in place. “Sorry, man,” he said, though he didn’t seem it in the least.
Cas has moved closer, closer than even the meager distance they usually inhabit, and the wry twist to his smile and the unreadable gleam in his eyes sends Dean's pulse through the roof. "Uh, Cas?" The angel's got him all but pressed up to the side of the table. And yes, he wants this, has wanted it for years, but what's always seemed barely possible in dreams is excruciating now.
That sounded promising. Dean slid the file to Cas, who picked it up and immediately began rustling through it.
Objectively, he’d had far better kisses, but with the way his head just went quiet and the hushed sense of satisfaction and belonging that filled his heart at the slow, contented press of Cas’s lips against his, he couldn’t recall a single one of them. When they parted, his breath was coming faster. His chest felt tight with happiness, like some long-estranged part of him had finally come home, and his face felt like it could split from how wide his grin grew. “Took us long enough,” he joked, seeing his own dizzy joy reflected in Cas’s warm smile.
Son of a bitch, that was right. A quick glance over at Cas showed that he looked just as stunned as Dean felt.
Cas, poor guy, looks just as overwhelmed. “You never said.”
Something too nervous to be a smile lights on Dean’s face and he laughs, thin and reedy, and says, “See, here was me thinking everyone saw past all my bullshit, but hell, even Sam’s got no fucking clue.”
He was expecting to see that barren field and a young Sammy staring up at him, or maybe his mom smiling down at him and offering him a piece of pie, or even some white expanse of nothing closer to what he’d first imagined Heaven would be like. Once his eyes adjusted, though, he saw it was none of the above.
The surprised joy that skittered across Cas’s face was gratifying, and gave Dean a bit more determination to see this thing through. “Okay. Ready?” he asked. The arm that didn’t bore the mark came up, hand clutching at the sleeve of Cas’s coat in an unconscious attempt to brace himself.
Dean slumps like all his strings have been cut,
Alarm bells were ringing by the dozen in his ears. Shit, if Cas was going downhill this fast, they had even less time than they’d been counting on. The worry that there’d be no one to take him out was undeniably fresh in Dean’s mind, but it had been wholly eclipsed by panic and fear for Cas himself. He wanted to call the whole thing off, to go back to Earth and switch gears, sending Sammy looking for possible solutions to Cas’s predicament instead of his own. Hell, chances were they’d have a lot better luck with the Grace situation than the Mark. He knew, though, that there’d be no convincing Cas to turn back now. The stubborn son of a bitch was as bad as he and Sam that way. So if leaving wasn’t an option, they needed to get to Ramiel, and preferably soon. “Are you gonna be able to hold out long enough to even get to Ramiel?”
If Dean’s expression had been hard to read before, it’s almost impossible to now. Something – more than one something, actually – crosses his face, and he visibly hesitates and swallows before he looks down, and then back up. “Yeah, well,” he says, and takes another sip from his beer in a transparent effort to stall.
And that’s… not what Sam expected at all. But beyond the knee-jerk ‘wait what?’ reaction that has his mouth dropping it makes sense. Still sad, and still awful, and still makes that little throb of pity in his chest known, but of course. Of course Dean wouldn’t be able to sit still long enough to figure out what he wants out of life while Cas is still in the Empty. His guilt has always run deeper than Sam’s – and that’s saying something – and while of course Sam is grieving, and of course Sam is horrified that Cas is doomed to an eternal sleep at best, and of course Sam is going to miss him, already misses him something fierce, it’s always been different for Dean. It was what started the whole path of dominoes that led to Cas coming into their lives in the first place: he’d never been able to say goodbye.
Jack, to his credit, doesn’t look disappointed or upset at all. Nor does he look surprised, really. He looks at Cas, then Dean, the expression on his face almost like
“Yeah. He said there’s no way he knows of to remove it, but that maybe we can, uh, ‘corrupt its form’ to mess with its power. Kind of like how we can spray paint through warding sigils to break them.”
“One of the first souls I escorted to Heaven was Abel’s. He was a righteous man, and was horrified to learn that it had not been our Father that he had been speaking with, but the Serpent. He asked me to go to his brother, to see if there was anything to be done.”
They’d been walking in silence for a few minutes when there was a sudden intake of breath and a flash of something beside him. Dean startled, automatically reaching for the gun tucked in the small of his back. It wouldn’t do any good against anything up here, but he’d brought it nonetheless, unable to stomach being completely unarmed. Its familiar weight in his hand was a small comfort as he whirled around to see a huge explosion of light.
“Dean?” He hadn’t noticed that Sam was asleep in a chair beside him. Dean’s voice must have awoken him. “Oh thank God, you’re awake. How you feeling, man?” He leaned forward, hovering a bit.
“You know,” Sam says, more searching for something to keep the silence at bay than having any big revelation, “with Chuck… not writing our story anymore, we get to write our own.” Maybe tomorrow that’ll feel better, but right now it just sits heavy on his tongue. “You know, just you and me going wherever the story takes us. Just us.”
benefit. “You’ll get your happy ending with Eileen. I’ll, uh, I’ll figure mine out. With Cas.”
. They’re supposed to all be good, all have a fresh start. What the hell happened?
There was a long pause, and then, “Okay.”
“You know, I’m a big girl. I can wash dishes all by myself and everything,” she said, but the smile on her face held little of the sharpness it once had.
“Why not?” Sam asked, all traces of humor or eagerness gone. “Dean, this could be it. This could save you.
“The one you and Gadreel used to break into Heaven?” Sam asked, perking up.
“You’re angry with me,” Cas said, which, yeah, no shit, Sherlock.
“Yes, well. That part may be a problem.”
Dawn was just beginning to break when they pulled up to the bunker, the sky lightening from black to grey and streaking with pinks and blues as Dean pulled the parking brake and killed the engine. In the passenger seat, Cas startled awake. “What -- I fell asleep. How long was I out?” he asked, rubbing at his eyes.
It’s going to take some time, to recontextualize a million things, not the least of which all the times Sam never quite understood why Dean took things with Cas so much harder, because
His nerves are still humming from seven hours on the road, but still he strips down to his boxers and shirt and flops down onto his bed. The memory foam is a godsend beneath his aching muscles, but sleep doesn’t seem to want to come. Two hours later, he’s sick of staring at the cracks in the ceiling above his bed. There’s no way he’s sleeping anytime soon.
“The form holds power,” Ramiel said, continuing with another warning glare Dean’s way. “That is why a damaged symbol can be disastrous.”
“Is this
“I think Dean and I have things to talk about,” Cas tells Jack, but he’s still locked in his staring thing with Dean (and yeah, it’d been weird without it, but now Sam’s not so sure he should’ve been so eager to have it back). “I’ll pray to you tomorrow, and we can figure out how this will work. I… I’d still like to help. But I think… I’d like for my home to be here.”
, but those three words are somehow not as terrifying as they might’ve been even a year ago. “Yeah.” His voice is hoarse, but Cas must hear something in it to show that he’s not freaking out, for his smile returns. It’s enough to give Dean the courage to say, “Yeah, uh. Me too. Just so you’re aware.”
that Sam doesn’t have the heart to make a pointed comment about the brazen purple mark on his throat. “You always were a little slow on the uptake.”
had to put his headphones on last night, where he finds reasons not to look Dean in the eye because there are some noises that you never want to hear from your brother and your pseudo-brother best friend down the hall. There’s also the horrifically stilted exchange they stutter through where Sam makes some comment about Cas always having been Dean’s exception, and then Dean turns interesting colors as he mutters something about, yeah, maybe not so much an exception, and Sam quietly has another mental breakdown about all the things he’d somehow missed. “Dude,” Dean says, and he has that same confused, alarmed, amused look as when Sam had missed the whole ‘happy ending’ thing the first time, “you met Lee. What did you think that was?” Sam just splutters.)
Cas’s face twisted into a grimace. “I’m fine.” Apparently, he still hadn’t learned how to lie convincingly. “It’s nothing that can’t wait.”
“Yeah, he’s fine. Human, but we kinda figured that was the best case scenario, really.”
Her frown deepened. “Never mind, it’s stupid.”
this much, like the Mark had put a damper on all his emotions. It hurt, but he wouldn’t take the alternative, not for anything. “Shit. I think it worked.”
They’re ten minutes away from the motel when Cas makes a sharp noise, then immediately starts digging in his coat pockets and pulls out his phone.
Well shit. Now Sam’s the one that feels near tears.
. Threw himself onto the altar. Guess he was really that desperate to be a Winchester, hmm? It's pathetic." The mockery in his voice cuts like a knife. "He's nothing but a tool to you, but still he finds ways to fall even further. Letting little old me in, of all things. All to save you."
saying it. We got a lot to, uh, talk through.”
Sam just shrugged. “One way to find out, I guess?” he said, sounding so damn optimistic that Dean didn’t have the heart to get pissed. He’d seen how frantic Sam had been, how willing he’d been to believe Dean when he’d insisted for weeks that he was fine, how desperately he’d begged Dean to tell him that he’d had had no other choice. He knew his brother was just as, if not more, terrified of what happened next as he was.
you to, and yet here we are, wasting our time on a friggin’ field trip to Heaven. You told me that if I went off the rails again that you’d--”
And Dean knew he should press, should piggyback off of Sam’s concern and get at the truth, but he’d never been good at… this. He couldn’t sit and listen as Cas laid down yet another problem, couldn’t let himself give into the worry and concern gnawing at him. So instead, he inhaled noisily, reached for his half-empty beer bottle, and said, “Good.” He steadfastly ignored the bitch face Sam threw at him. “So where do we find this Ramiel guy?”
He watches somewhat warily as Cas makes his way to one wall, peering at the various t-shirts and armbands and creepy big-headed dolls that line the shelves. “You don’t think this place is a little… I don’t know, uh. Much?” he asks, unsure of the word he’s looking for. And yeah, okay, the tats on the girl’s arm are pretty cool. And wait is that a sunshade with the Millennium Falcon on it? That’s actually pretty freaking–
By the time Sam shuffles off to his room, leaving the bunker silent but for the humming of ancient machinery, Dean's about ready to call it a night, himself. He's still reeling from the pace of the day. The incident with Amara and the smiting sickness left him feeling empty and exhausted, and everything with Lucifer was so full and frantic. Frankly, he's fucking tired of being constantly pulled between extremes. Just once, he wants to find some middle ground.
Dean stopped himself from slamming on the brakes in surprise, but just barely. “Crowley? Crowley saved you?”
“Hel--?” Dean starts to repeat, incredulous despite himself. “How does you getting your throat torn out help me?”
Dean takes a ragged breath. “You said you couldn’t have it. Cas, man, you never
“What the hell, man? Why would Crowley want to buy you more time?”
Cas closed the folder and pushed it back Sam’s way. “I don’t know. The theory is sound, and the spell itself looks reliable, but ensuring that it would distort the Mark may be--”
The drive home is quiet.
there. Cas shakes his head. “Even having all of the context, I’m still struggling to keep up, so perhaps you should give him a break.”
“You know, there are pills that can help with that.” The comment flew out of Dean’s mouth before he could help it.
He’d worried that the Jack they knew would be changed, gone somehow, but despite the different way he carries himself, power all but visible in his body, his face is the same as ever, childish and understanding as he says goodbye and disappears in a blink.
Cas’s outstretched hand wavers just a little bit before he slowly withdraws it, cradling the mug to his own chest. “If I’m overstaying my welcome--“ he starts, words careful and hesitant.
Before Dean could begin to put his thoughts into words, Cas interrupted. “That’s not good enough.” Going by the tone to his words and the crease forming between his eyebrows, he was losing patience just as rapidly as Dean. “Ramiel, there must be something. I was told that if anyone could help, it would be you.”
Yeah, this was going to be fan-frigging-tastic. They all waited, sitting in silence for a moment before Dean cleared his throat. “Care to elaborate?”
He meant it to be reassuring, but Cas seemed anything but. “Perhaps.” He cleared his throat, maybe to diffuse the tension, but it rapidly turned to a series of coughs that sounded far too real and painful to be a distraction.
So, yeah, he’s been pissed at himself for weeks. (And, if he’s honest, a little pissed at Cas, too, for acting like the way things are is good enough, for not taking pity on Dean and taking the lead. Yeah, he’s a fucking hypocrite, so what else is new.)
For whatever reason, something in what he said must get through to Dean, because it’s the first smile that reaches even halfway to his eyes. “Now we drink,” he says, pushing himself off the edge of the table, hooking a foot around one of the chairs, and settling in, “and we shoot the shit, and if we’re lucky, we get a good night’s sleep for the first time in our sorry lives.” He takes a long pull of his beer, as if to demonstrate, and when he swallows, he looks at the table for a moment that stretches just a little too long. “And then tomorrow you’re gonna get in one of the dozen cars we have in the garage and drive to Eileen’s house, and you’re gonna get your happy ending.”
“Why?”
“Why do you -- are you whispering?”
, you dumbass,” he’d say, and then finally grow a pair and kiss him like he’s dreamed about for way too fucking long. And they’d all live happily ever after.
He looked up, meeting Cas’s gaze as he said, “If this doesn’t work, and by some miracle we both survive, you take me out.” Sure enough, there was no flicker of surprise on Cas’s face. “Right then. I mean it. I was willing to try this, but if it doesn’t work, that’s it. I can’t take that chance. You can tell Sam it was the transfer if you want.”
He can taste Cas's breath, feel the vibrations low in Cas's throat when he chuckles. "How
He wants to deny it. He wants to stand firm, laugh straight in the Devil's face and believe that Cas had been tricked, been robbed of his consent. But even as he feels the nausea rise, he knows it'd be a lie. "No. He knows he's important. That he's family," he says, but it's feeble, ringing false even in his own ears.
Yeah, like that's ever going to happen.
, to have not questioned even
Sam grinned, happiness evident on every inch of his face. “It’s good to see you up and about. We were getting kind of worried.”
Cas and Sam both shot him glares, the unamused expressions so eerily similar that he was startled into silence, torn between amusement and mild horror.
For all that Cas seemed unmovable and so unknowable when he’d first barged into Dean’s life, since then Dean’s actually become pretty good at reading him. He’s miles and miles away from the blank-faced angel he’d been back then. He feels so much more and shows it. But at the moment, Dean can’t, or won’t, figure out what the look on his face means.
“Yes.” Cas’s expression very clearly left no room for further argument on the subject. “It’s not much further.”
“C’mere, kid,” Dean says, and it’s his turn to tug him in. “We’re proud of you, you know that, right?”
. I just don’t know what--“
“What the
“I don’t need to sleep,” Cas said, though the huge yawn puncturing his words said otherwise. “I’m--”
"There's no way he'd ever say yes to you," he spits, and feels the conviction in it.
And then Dean would laugh because
“It’s Grumpy Cat.” Cas says it like it’s supposed to mean something to him, the capital letters almost audible, but Dean just shakes his head. Cas sighs, some of the enthusiasm in his eyes dimming. “In one of Claire’s texts, she compared me to Grumpy Cat. I looked it up on Google and apparently she’s a very famous cat. The videos were rather entertaining.”
She snorted, more of the derision he’d come to expect from her coming out. “What show have you been watching?”
He’s a bit quieter after that, and follows sedately as Cas makes his way across the store. It’s a few minutes later when he hears Cas say his name. He looks up and drops the Hawkeye toy he definitely was not messing with to see Cas clasping the ugliest looking stuffed animal Dean has ever seen. “I found it,” Cas announces proudly, holding the thing up.
“Sam?” Cas’s voice came from the doorway. “Is everything all right? I thought I heard…” He trailed off as he came into the room, clearly catching sight of the two of them, awake and both grinning like morons. He looked a million times better, eyes more alert, skin healthier, the confusion quickly dropping from his face to be replaced with a hesitant smile.
Dean, still feeling a bit spiteful about the lack of sleep, was unable to resist. “I’ll alert the media.”
Cas pushes himself upright, mouth set in a hard line. Dean watches as he picks a hand up (the hand that’d just been in dirt and hay and god knows what else, and he really needs to start thinking about infections now that he’s human) and touches the bite with a sharp hiss of pain. “You didn’t see the third one coming up on you. I had to help.”
“Why the hell not? Man, you saw what I did back in Pontiac. You and I both know it’s just a matter of time before I get ganked one way or another, and I’ll be damned before I make Sammy deal with a black-eyed version of me again.” He snorted and, unable to help himself, added, “Literally.”
wants. About Cas, and the awful, too-familiar pit of grief in his chest that comes with having to deal with this loss one final time. About Dean, and the future, and how fucking terrified he is, and how selfish that already feels.
“Purgatory.” It’s the first time that Dean’s been looking away when Sam looks over. He’s turned his head finally, and there’s color blooming in his neck and cheeks. Huh.
“There it is,” Dean says, still too fucking gleeful, and heads out, tugging Cas along right behind him.
The thought of them seeing Jack hurts, but in the best way. Sam hopes that they see past the new-God thing to the kid underneath, to see how
, this dorky, goofy little dude with messy hair, annoyingly blue eyes, and trademark coat that he’d almost forgotten that, underneath, Cas was still
The laugh that Dean gives at that is harsh and tastes bitter. “I’m angry because you were a dumbass and nearly got yourself ganked by three vamps.”
. For all he was so gung-ho on saving Dean now, he hadn’t given a damn before Dean had woken up with black eyes. Dean had nearly killed Sam. If he’d been even a little bit less interested in howling at the moon and a little more interested in embracing his dark side, he could have done some serious damage. And Cas had known, the whole time --
“You think this is funny?” Cas sounded truly angry for the first time.
Sam’s face broke into the widest smile Dean had seen in a long time as he leapt from his seat to wrap Dean in a bone-crushing hug.
“No, Dean, I didn’t. You asked and I listened, but I never agreed. Not once you actually elaborated the favor you were asking, that is,” he amended.
“You were a Reaper?” Dean hadn’t meant to ask it aloud, but what the hell.
“Jesus, this thing hurts,” Dean said, extending his arm to reveal the fresh welts.
“I’m fine,” Cas said with a shake of his head, though his voice sounded even rawer than usual. “We should get moving.”
“No. The Axis Mundi leads inward, to the Garden. We need to go out. Ramiel should be near the Gates.” With one last, brief look at memory-Dean, Cas headed for the entrance to the diner.
Ramiel locked eyes with Cas and then nodded, gravely, before withdrawing his hands from Cas’s hold. “I wish you luck, Dean Winchester,” he said, and then disappeared in a flap of wings.
, something so old and so unknowable and, ultimately, so far from human that Dean couldn’t begin to wrap his head around it. “Okay, seriously,” he asked, strangely hoarse, once Cas looked like himself once more. “What the hell is going on?”
Cas just makes a small humming noise, still focused wholly on the selection of novelty t-shirts. “I’m sure I’ll know the right gift when I see it.”
fine?”
It was obvious Claire was getting more and more irritated. “Yeah, okay, he’s a bad-ass with a blade, but he’s pretty much a lost little puppy on the inside. I would’ve thought
Frustration was beginning to war with the exhaustion on Cas’s face, and Dean wasn’t sure whether to count it as a victory or not. “What does that matter?”
Yeah. That couldn’t be good. “Uh. Care to elaborate?”
Sam was beginning to get angry now. "you're cas right?"
Sam was getting annoyed. " he's home "
It was a warm school night in October. Dean was 16, his denim pants had rips in them, his dirty shoes were marked with bright yellow stars drawn on by his best friend, his leather jacket was 2 sizes too big for him but he made it work with his boyish charm. He kicked a can of soda as he walked on the sidewalk with his pipsqueak brother chattering excitedly about his school project. It involved stars,that was the only reason they were out this late out at night, some star you were supposed to see only this time of year. When they reached the small hill in the back of their neighbourhood dean plumped down on his makeshift chair and turned on his flashlight to look at some batman comics. His brother would be annoyed a little bit but he wouldn't say anything. They stayed on the hill for about an hour.
They made way to the parking lot and sat in dean’s car. It was old yet new. He’d worked all season between football practices to buy it and he’d again spent so much time fixing it up at the junkyard. The inside smelled like dean. The moment they lit the joints and sat back it didn’t smell like anything anymore. For a short while they were both quiet and then they started to giggle because cas felt hot and he got stuck in his attempt to take off his jacket. It was too warm for the windows to be shut. Dean pulled one of his jacket sleeves and cas got unstuck. They saw bright red cigarets in the distance, some kids smoking under the trees. Cas decided to turn on the radio but there was no station they’d both agree on. In the end it was just white noise that they settled on. Dean’s mood was a bit down after they saw jo pass over to her car to change her high heels for sneakers. He lamented their break up. “It wasn’t like the other times, I don’t think we’re ever getting back together and that sucks, do you think ellen will still invite me over?” Castiel was aware that ellen and jo were somehow dean’s unofficial extended family. “Yes dean she will, don’t you worry” and he said it with his New York accent and it made dean laugh. Then his bracelet seemed to be scratching at him and he tried to take it off. When he did he dropped it but the car didn’t have enough room for him to pick it up again. And then he started to cry. Not cry like babies. Cry like he’d been caught cheating at 2nd grade math. Cas couldn’t comprehend what had just happened. “Hey it’s just somewhere in the car” and then dean started to sob and hid his face with his elbow. that was somehow the worst sound cas had ever heard in his entire life. He picked up the flashlight from the dashboard and lit up the car’s floor. “See?it’s there, hey, hey, it’s there, look” cas said and dean looked down and went “oh” with his wet puffy lips. Cas bent over dean’s seat and picked it up, “here, back to you again” he looked up at dean and said . Dean swallowed his tears and smiled “thanks” an actual tear dropped on cas’s hand. Dean’s eyes glimmered like a bubble bath. Cas kissed him on the chin. It tasted like the sea salt and it wobbled under his lips. Then he leaned back onto his own seat again and they lit another joint, letting themselves get lost into the fog. Cas turned the white noise off and chose a random cassette from dean’s collection. He knew dean loved them all anyway. It cheered him up and soon he was tapping on his knees along the song. Later he would make cas a mix tape and cas would lay down in his bed stroking himself but that’s still a long time away.
"yeah and have some coffee. My head is killing me" dean replied.
Jo thought of dean with his huge green eyes abandoned at that old house. He’d  never said anything about it.
At the mention of her name dean got confused. He didn’t want to see cas get hurt but he didn’t want to blow Charlie’s secret either.
Dean had slept it off. He'd go back to school tomorrow. He could walk normal enough now, if he braced himself through the pain. In his old ratty bed he was laying on his stomach staring at his shoes which glowed in the dark, the tiny stars. The world was quiet, everyone was asleep, but he was awake, thinking about football. He didn't want to think about himself. So he was thinking about football. He was thinking of the Halloween party in a couple of weeks. He was too old to go trick or treating but he had to take Sammy to get his candy. Then he could go to the party, the one jo always threw, and Sammy would go in a corner in the loud house to bury his nose in a book and dean could take a breath, he had raised no snitch. The sound of scratches at his window pulled him out of the thoughts. And a moment later stilled air hit him and a pair of legs entered through.
"yea sounds like him" dean shrugged.
"okay okay"
"no I swear he just saw me and decided to hate me?"
If dean Winchester had a file about him, it would state that there had been occasions when he passed out and woke up in strange motel rooms with no recollection of how he got there. And if someone read that file they could draw the same conclusions as he did every time. But dean wouldn’t think in terms of words. Because words have meanings. To him, it was meaningless and painful. Sometimes there’d be bruising and blood stains on the sheets and fluids that weren’t his. He would crawl to the bathroom or shuffle as best as he could, cry as the shower water shocked his skin prickly and get dressed, go to the streets and try to guess which part of town he was in. Get hitchhiked to familiar enough parts. One time he woke up near the state line. That was the worst. A few times he got looks from the seedy motel manager eyeing his exit. That happened less as he grew older and learned to cook for himself. When John cooked he felt like the end of the world was upon him. it always tasted funny when John cooked.
“Who are you taking to the dance?”
"yeah let's go" cas said.
On October 31st dean was dressed up as zuko from GREASE, jo was dressed as sandy, they were always on again off again and low key flirting, Charlie came in as a witch who was constantly making bad puns everyone had suspected she had worked all year round to come up with, cas was a vampire with blood dripping down the corner of his mouth and sam, he had thrown a white sheet over his head and called it a day. They had danced, drank, played spin the bottle, truth or dare and tired themselves out completely. Jo always threw the best Halloween parties because her mom always felt guilty for marrying again and basically turned a blind eye. Sam had fallen asleep in his little nook holding his book. They were too drunk to drive so they crashed in the living room. Most people had walked out but some kids had crashed here and there, sleeping with limbs stretched out. Dean woke up for a second when a flash of light bothered him. He was a light sleeper. Cas was standing there with a polaroid camera. "I took your photo" he said with a shit eating grin and stumbled besides dean. "you sleep like a fetus"
"go to hell" sam told him and ran away. He wanted to kick that boy but he knew he was weaker and yet, he still couldn't keep himself in check, the anger he was too afraid to show john, had bubbled up and now he was running away.
"how nice of him" cas whispered. His thumb brushed over dean's lower lip and he cleared his throat. "I'll pick you up tomorrow, just wait over 2nd corner"
content warning //
Dean looked at him disgusted. Sam had a cardboard he had painted white and it looked like he had captured butterflies through different stages of maturation and pinned them down in order. It looked like he had had more of them in that suspicious looking shoe box.
"go to bed Sammy" dean instructed his brother, who then ran to the house using the back door. But he did not go to bed. His heart was racing too much and he put his small head in the corner of the window and squinted. There was a punch and there was dean being dragged into the house. That's when the shouting began. Sam hid under the blankets in his bed and listened as each thud against the cheap thin walls indicated dean being hit. But he couldn't make out the words. He could hear them clearly but it didn't make a sense to him. As if they were spoken in a foreign language. It wasn't until years later that he would remember them and he would know what they meant. And then there was crying and whimpering, which sam really tried not to hear, it felt like invasing dean's privacy, like peaking in to see him take a shit on the toilet at school, something embarrassing that was wrong to do and wrong to mention even if you did.
Dean and castiel had met because castiel sold an axe to 9 year old sam. Castiel was new in town. His dad had died and his mom was a single parent who had decided to move back to her home town. Castiel lived with his mom and his grandparents. That summer he decided to help out and found a part time job at the hardware store. When sam tried to buy the axe he panicked and sold it to him. He was nerveous for a few days, expecting a parent to come barging in to demand why he had sold a hazardeous weapon to a gradeschool kid who had now lost his hand in a tragic accident.
Jo sat up suddenly. Was her mom saying she was bad for dean?not the other way around?
"where's your brother?" he asked.
"don't even joke about it" dean hissed at him. "what are you doing here cas? he's got a shot gun and he WILL use it"
"yeah sick, with the flu"
“It was before little sam was born. Mary, his mother, she’d left John, that was the first time she’d left him. John, he refused to take care of dean, said he was a bastard and Mary had tricked him into the marriage”
"oh and I brought you a snack" he gave dean a slice of pizza. Dean smiled in the dark, but cas saw. "I was gonna bring it earlier but your brother hates me"
Jo was at home in her bed hugging her pillow when her mother knocked on her door and she quickly dropped the pillow and sat straight. Her mom entered the bedroom with a warm cup of chocolate milk which she set on the bed side table because jo protested she wouldn’t drink it in bed lest she spills it. Her homework was on her floor. On her desk was a big pile of newspapers she was trying to make her art project out of. She had given up. She would ask dean tomorrow for help. He was very good with his hands and he knew how to bend materials into shape. Jo’s mother sat at the edge of her bed and asked her if she was feeling okay. They were both tired from a fight they’d had earlier and none of them were in the mood to keep it going. Her mom didn’t want her to date dean, which was bogus because jo always felt like Ellen had a soft spot for the boy and well, after her halloween party they were on their ON phase again which irked Ellen and jo couldn’t figure out why. At this moment jo both loved and hated Ellen. From the bottom of her heart she couldn’t really distinguish the two any more, she wanted her approval and trust but she couldn’t seem to find a way to gain either of those things. And it was exhausting. To be tough all the time. She WAS tough. But not all the time. There were times she wanted to let her hair down and French kiss her beautiful boyfriend and she didn’t mind sneaking around but if someone saw her being soft, she’d feel a pang in her heart. She didn’t know where it came from. So now she had her head on her mother’s leg and she was being caressed on her golden hair and she felt happy and heavy. It was frustrating. Ellen couldn’t tell how tense she was on the inside. But she had an inkling anyway. “Honey, I don’t hate dean, I don’t. But he’s not right for you.” She wanted to say. But she knew it would make her teenage daughter explode again. So this time she started by “did I ever tell you about the time I almost adopted dean?you were too little back then and well, I don’t know how much he remembers”
“So you’re stag too?” Dean said, the right corner of his mouth curling up.
"hello"
Cas had never seen drunk dean so seeing high dean sounded like a charming idea.
So Charlie had told him. Well now dean felt offended she hadn’t asked HIM to escort her.
“Because I want you to know I like dean, I do. But he needs someone he can rely on, your hot and cold teenage relationship is poisonous for him”
That parent never came. Dean Winchester did. He came over to the counter, he looked intimidating at first but no he didn't look angry, in fact he looked giddy and found it hilarious. He waited for his shift to be over, it was a Sunday afternoon and then he showed around the town. It was all new for castiel. He had grown up in new York, everyone was too busy and dirty, no one knew one another. Seeing dean have a usual spot at the diner, bantering with the waitress, it looked unreal to him. Dean's smile was easy. He didn't have to work hard to see it. dean appointed him cas, and he liked it (much better than his last nick name which was ass)
"hey"
Cas liked watching old news reels. He liked horror movies. He liked driving. He was on the debate team. He liked argueing with people. He liked seeing the cogs in their brains turn. He liked knowing about the world. He cared about so much and maybe he really cared so little. He had no capacity for the issues he seemed to be interested in. they were all words and pictures to him. He could read about the wars and he could imagine them, but they didn't mean anything to him. Not really. He was just a teenage boy. His heart had never been broken. He had never gotten close with anyone. Sharing all those hours with dean, it meant he had been invited into someone else's world and it excited cas. To be let in, to know things others didn't, it made him feel special. but it took time for his eyes to get used to the dark. To see that behind the easy smile was a painted carelessness the artist had taken years to master. Cas was not a stranger to taking a beating here and there. When he was too naughty or made a mess. It wasn't out of the ordinary to get beat up by your parents in those days. It was just something that happened. But dean's reluctance and eventual revelation of it was aberrant. Dean got beat too often too harsh for too little. He had learned to be cautious but all the ways he had formulated to make himself invisible still failed. His eyes were too green, his teeth too bright, his laugh too contagious. Dean had presence, whether he liked it or not. so cas drew stars on his shoes, so when he looked down in shame he'd still be looking up.
dean let his face be examined by the out stretched hands. "he never hits me in the face" dean said flatly.
Dean was surprised to have cas so close in his face, his eyes were dilated and looked into cas’s blue ones with shock.
"neither did the butterflies" dean told him. "I'm gonna let you go on three, two-
It was their bit, the moment dean found out cas could do a Russian accent. Castiel rolled his eyes. Dean said come on, cas did the dimitri. It was so easy to amuse dean.
Dean missed school for a few days, no one batted an eyelash, he wasn't academically "gifted" and his attitude rubbed the staff the wrong way to ever care, in fact each one of them expected him to end up in jail or die in a drunk driving accident someday. Sam on the other hand was always tidy, he was a smart kid and polite and everyone was nice to him because they pittied his background and home life. He'd stay for after school activities and he'd get cookies and milk because his teachers liked him and tried to help in little ways. It was a small town and the fact that his mother had left them and his father was an alcoholic were known facts.
No, he hadn’t done anything. Neither of them had, and that’s the damn problem. “It’s fine, Cas,” Dean says instead. “It’s just. There are things that I want.” It’s not the first time he’s said it aloud, but it still isn’t any less terrifying. The rush of exhilaration and fear and hope isn’t any less powerful. “Things that I never figured I’d get, and recently, y’know, a lot of the things that were in the way of that have disappeared. So it’s just--”
“Be careful,” Sam said once they finally let go of one another. His eyes darted to the side, over Dean’s shoulder. “Both of you.”
care about them? Why now? Every time Sam had brought up the visions, Dean had scoffed at the very notion, but Sam had bought into it with a kind of fervor Dean hadn't seen since Sam had practically tripped over his feet fawning over Cas and Uriel. And yeah, Dean gets it. He gets the need to put your faith into something, someone bigger than himself. He hadn't, not back then, but even if he's never had faith in God, he's since learned how to have it in something else.
or whatever. Ugh, it’s just weird, okay, he’s in my dad’s body and -- whatever, I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Yes.” If Ramiel could tell Dean was pissed, he didn’t react. “It is the same thing that happened to Cain.”
"Hey."
“Hey, wait a sec, hang on,” Dean interrupts, reaching out to grab the sleeve of Cas’s sweatshirt. “What’s going on?”
Cas was silent for a long moment. He probably knew what was coming and was figuring out how best to answer, Dean figured, which was why he was a bit surprised when Cas then said, “Anything.”
“However, there may be a way to free yourself of its hold.”
Dean kept the grip on his gun tight, but never made any move to raise it from where it hung at his side. He’d spent so long thinking of Cas as
“Yeah, well, I thought I didn’t have to ask either, because I thought
“We have plenty of time to make up for it,” Cas said softly, and then leaned in again to begin to do just that.
Cas grimaced. “By itself, maybe not. But I’ve had to exert more than I anticipated keeping you here as well, seeing as separating your soul from your body wasn’t an option.”
He didn’t mean to bring it up, not right away at least. Cas might have looked worn down and tired as all hell at the moment, but he knew better than most how the angel could turn all righteous fury and indignation when he wanted to. But an hour into the drive, the silence was eating at him, making him itchy and restless behind Baby’s wheel, and blaring his music just wasn’t cutting it. He knew jumping right into the fray with, ‘hey, remember when you promised to take me out if I went dark side? Time’s a-wastin’, buddy,’ would only end badly, but he’d never been a master of small talk, and there were really only two topics of conversation to be had. “So how bad is it, really?” he said abruptly, going for option B.
Charlie had spent the holidays on a summer camp as a counselor. It was in the woods, near a lake. She enjoyed telling scary stories at the bonfire to the kids, she liked telling them about the different plants when they went hiking, she specifically liked pointing out the poison ivy and oaks to give an air of danger, she liked looking like she was so old and wise. Not only had she enjoyed her time there this year and gotten paid, she had something she really wanted to tell dean about. Charlie and dean had been friends since they were little kids playing at the play ground. But when highschool rolled her parents sent her kicking and screaming to a proper catholic school. She saw less of dean but they still had their get togethers any time they could. She hadn't had a chance to tell dean about her discoveries yet. He was spending a lot of time with that new boy castiel. She was home for Christmas and she had invited dean like they did every year. Dean showed up with his little brother in tow. Charlie messed his head up and told him he had grown up so much the last time she'd seen him. Then she laughed. She liked being all adult. It was partially just to piss sam off. That kid was too serious for his own good.
Dean mumbled whatever and went back to sleep, curling up to cas for warmth who then threw his cape over their bodies and fell asleep in a few seconds.
"me too." Cas said.
That made jo take a mental step back. This was news to her. No one had ever said something about it.
Dean was furiously mopping the floors. He wouldn't look at sam. His face was dirty. Part of his hair was stuck to his forehead. Sam knew dean knew he had seen it all. There was no avoiding it now. Sam would never talk about it. but when he had children of his own he often wondered what would have happened if he had said something. Anything
Dean turned his head at that moment, cas’s heart dropped, he felt it drop.
Dean was perched with his chin on the wooden counter at the hardware store watching cas clean up the snow at the front of the display. No one was giving him orders or anything but he was so into it. It was relaxing to see someone give their 100 percent to a menial task. when it was completely clean he waved at dean and came back inside. The tip of his nose was red and runny and his lips had paled but he looked happy. It was a lazy afternoon the shop was empty and the snow had cancelled the football practice. Dean had gained some bulk and it was hard for cas to make his way through the back without bumping into him but dean made no show of moving away. His back was relaxed and he seemed very fascinated by the clock on the wall. Cas took his mug of tea and sat beside him.he was beginning to fear his new crowd would affect his idea of dean. Geeks and theatre nerds and debate club kids did not exactly match with jocks. Not that at his last school things were any different but at least there was more leeway. His new friends weren’t very nice but they liked to think they were. And he knew they were as mean as their counterparts, just less physically endowed to apply their cruelness. But dean was neither dumb nor cruel. And this afternoon they had free time to just sit there and do nothing but dean wasn’t talking. Castiel took a sip of his tea and burned his tongue. “ ouch “ he said, that brought dean out of his thoughts and he paid some attention to cas finally. “I got dumped…again” dean said and huffed out a bit of dispassionate air from his lungs. “ I got dumped right before valentine’s dance. Great” cas smiled to himself. Dean was handsome he could ask anyone to the dance and maybe half of them would say yes. “Is that funny to you?” Dean asked him with his eyebrows in a knot. “ very “ cas replied.
