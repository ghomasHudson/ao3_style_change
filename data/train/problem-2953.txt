Castiel could see she was having a hard time being the strong one, but they all needed her to, someone should be. “You married a great woman Sam.” Cas told him softly as they watched her talk to a nurse to find out about Dean. The corners of Sam’s lips quirked up, but there was no joy in his eyes. He looked at Cas slightly pained but nodded. “And you’ll marry a great man. I know he will get through this okay?” Sam clasped Cas’s knee as reassurance and Cas nodded. “He’s strong.” Cas agreed, his eyes still fixed on the conversation between Jess and the nurse.
When they got into the house Dean told Cas to close his eyes before walking into the back yard. For good measure, he got behind him and put his hands over Cas's face. He felt slightly giddy, being this close to the other. Unlike all those times in the past, he allowed himself to feel it, to enjoy the small touches, the mere presence of Castiel.
Dean told Cas to hold on for a second so he could get changed, so they could go back to the house. As much as he loved working on the house, he was disappointed that they didn't adhere to their ritual. He was looking forward to telling Dean about Bobby and Jack, and how they were redesigning heaven. Dean told him it would be worth the drive so Cas gave in. As soon as Dean got dressed he led Castiel out to the car, seeming to burst with excitement. Castiel started to wonder what it was he was so happy about.
Apparently they had severely underestimated how much work would have to put into the organization, the guest list, the menu... It also didn't take them long to realize that having a 'modest wedding' wasn't the most realistic idea for two people that knew and had saved dozens of people all over the US. After determining their guestlist, they had a large group of hunters, ex-hunters and hunters in training, a few angels they had grown close to that Jack had resurrected, other people that had helped them along the way, Dean's colleagues and the neighbor's they had grown quite close with. All in all they had over 200 guests they didn't want to exclude, turning it into quite a big wedding after all. Which would have been fine in and of itself. It had caused a lot of stress, but after months of planning, everything had been thought out perfectly. But that hard work unraveled within a ten minute phone call.
"Haven't they?" Jack asked confused as he looked between his fathers.
Dean asked about heaven and Castiel told him that Jack had asked Bobby for help. Dean seemed to be reassured by it as much as Cas had. Dean listen to the stories with a gentle smile on his face. After the sun set the temperature lowered quickly. It did give a new dimension to the garden.
When Sam and Gabriel got back from ice skating Dean had already set the table. Dean rolled his eyes when they entered, with Sam holding a bunch of red roses. It was the roses that had caught his eyes initially, but the sticker on the ribbon had him do a double take, it was the same shop. It was dumb of course, but he still couldn't help thinking back at how he freaked out Castiel by going there every day.
Castiel quite enjoyed working on the house along side the other. Dean talked a bit more easy when his hands were busy laying tiles of fixing plumbing. Cas liked hearing him talk, there was a sort of hapiness in Dean's voice that used to be rare, but now was there almost every day. Dean also seemed to value Castiel's opinion on the house more than he expected, explaining his plans for each room and asking Cas what he thought or what he would want.
This was different, vulnerable. What if he drooled on Cas or if he snored into his ear. Of course Cas wasn't going to leave him for being unattractive in his sleep, but what if he would? Dean had never felt this nervous about something he knew wouldn't happen, it was just hard to ignore that ever present feeling that told him he wouldn't be able to hold onto something good. That's why he was on the far left of the bed he had invited Cas into himself. Castiel stayed on the right side, calmly giving Dean time to adjust. At least he didn't ask if he should leave, but the question would come eventually if Dean kept looking so uncomfortable.
With rebuilding the house and fixing heaven, they hadn't had the chance to enjoy a moment like this, and Dean knew that a large part of it was due to him. He needed time to come to terms with who he loved, that he could even love that deeply and have it returned. He was still afraid that now that they both said it, now that it was real, it would be taken from him.
Dean followed the man over to the rack and took a look at what they had to offer. "Not really, but my brother is home for Christmas and he insisted on getting an angel for the tree this year." He explained, rolling his eyes at how how Sammy was trying with the decorations this year.
"Maybe... Or I was thinking, maybe we can do the ceremony now with the people that had to make travel plans, and we can hold a bigger party at the first possibility to book a new venue?"
Sam was still smiling. "It's fine Dean. I'm happy for you guys." Sam said quickly, when Dean narrowed his eyes at his brother.
A grin spread across his face. He'd heard those words from angels and demons alike, using it to point out his weakness or trying to use it as an insult. All he could do back then was clench his jaw and try to ignore how painful it was to hear that those feelings that he shouldn't have in the first place would be used against him and Dean, even if the latter didn't realize. Now, hearing the same statement brought him joy. Especially when put so plainly and without malice. "That's also right. So maybe I should get uncle Dean a ring, huh?" It wasn't the first time he considered proposing, but he always found reasons not to.
How could he respond? Cas was right, they did not need this. They'd be together forever either way.
Castiel had to agree that it was different, visiting Castiel or living there with him. "You're right." He admitted, trying not to focus on how much it sounded like Dean wasn't planning on visiting him at all.
Castiel rolled his eyes. "Humans shouldn't do that." Cas corrected him. "Jack would have been fine. You on the other hand..." He gave Dean a pointed look.
"Oh no, I know couples kiss. I always kind of wondered why I hadn't seen it before, but some people want privacy right." He concluded. "If I'm honest." Jack continued. "I was more surprised about Sam and Gabriel kissing."
Sam lifted an eyebrow as he looked at Dean. "You've seen him around the flower shop?" Sam asked, putting an emphasis on the word flower. Dean crossed his arms, hoping the obvious blush had faded by now. "You don't know who I'm bringing flowers." He threw back, shutting him up for only a second. then he pointed at Dean with a knowing laugh. "So there is some sort of secret love you're getting flowers. I knew you were at the settling down stage by now."  Sam pointed out with a triumphant smirk.
Dean bit his lip. "Uhm..." He let out in though. The man looked at him again and Dean could see the way his expression had changed, just by the pause in Dean's answers. He figured the guy was losing his patience and Dean was holding him from his work like this.
"I thought you might," Jody cut in with a grin. "Castiel, what do you vow to Dean?"
Jack looked up from his drink. "Right, Santa. I do have another question. Does he only come when we decorate? Because he didn't come last year... Or do we have to summon him first, because if so, I would very much like to help with that." Sam and Dean exchanged a look, but Gabriel jumped in to save them.
Dean gave him a confused look, like he needed more of an explanation.
Sam looked at the two with a smile. Dean never really liked Christmas as far as Sam was aware, but it seemed like he had some pretty good memories from before Mom died. As much as Sam wished he could have those memories as well, he was glad to see his brother reliving them with Jack.
Orriginally, Dean had planned to start painting next. But now that he had some time without Cas, he wanted to use that to surprise him.
"I'd say he doesn't want me to die, but I'm guessing he just likes his peace and quiet up there." Dean joked, almost burning his hotdog after not paying full attention to it as he listened to Cas.
That hurt. The way Castiel distanced himself from the word partner, like there could be anybody else for Dean. Had Dean really missed the whole point of what was happening. Was the whole confession some weird platonic angel crap and had Cas taken his confession the same way. "Maybe some day? Listen Cas, am I missing something here?" He couldn't keep the frustration out of his voice. How did he get it so wrong.
She nodded enthusiastically as she did the sign for love.
She tapped her lips twice with the nail of her thumb, then for good measure mimicked locking her lips with a key. Once her excitement died down a little she let out a yawn before rubbing through her eyes.
"What about this one?"
Judging by the nod, the number didn't seem to shock Levar in the slightest. "And you're not the only one. Demand is exciding our capacity. I commend how hard you and your colleagues have been working to keep up, but the current situation just isn't sustainable. Instead we have decided to expand the business to accommodate the growth."
"Wait, what happened?" Jack asked confused as he played with his fork. "Gabriel just said the two of you were kissing in the kitchen."
Dean smiled at Cas as they drove towards the ceremony hall. It had been 12 years since Gabriel triggered the failsafe and their old lives seemed almost like a weird fever dream. It had taken some getting used too for the boys, especially when they first went to visit Bobby, the one that raised them. They had to keep reminding themselves that some shared memories weren't shared anymore. It was sad in a way, but they got the chance to make new memories.
As Dean and Cas pulled up to the parking lot, Bobby was already waiting. He walked toward the impala to greet the two men. "Can you believe it, Sammy getting married." He smiled brightly as Dean shook his head. "Poor Eileen."
In the middle of the flowers, with a small walkway to work, Dean had put a beehive. Castiel had always loved bees and Dean knew that. He looked at him, at a slight loss for words. Maybe Cas's interest had rubbed off on the hunter, or maybe he did it because he knew Cas would enjoy it when he came to visit. Whatever the reason, Cas felt like Dean put it there for him.
"No, it's not." He stepped closer, "I should have told you how I felt long before that. I should have never made you feel like that was the only way to tell me."
The other chuckled at that. "It is, I suppose. But it's more then that to me. People seem just a little more cheery around Christmas. And it's a family holiday so that nice as well. I've got four brothers and three sisters, so it's good that they are forced to come here at least once a year."
Before Dean and Jack had returned Gabriel had reiterated a few times he could make everything fully decorated with a single snap, but Sam and Cas had finally talked him out of that. He was still convinced that doing this by hand was basically a useless endeavor, until he saw Sam's eyes light up, just at opening the boxes. He pulled out a cord of fairy lights and held it up.
Castiel was faster than Dean. He gasped, his eyes wide with joy. When Dean wanted to look at Castiel's glass he put his hand over what seemed to be some sort of engravement.  Instead he gestured for Dean to take out his own glass. One look around the room told Dean all eyes were on him now. Slowly, he pulled the glass out of the box and read what it said. Tears were filing up his eyes before he was consciously aware what the engravement stood for.
Dean had to admit it was a good pick right away. It wasn't as frilly and fluffy as most of the ones they had. It was golden, With dark wings spread out at the back. It looked awesome on its own, but the little santa head it wore really made Dean grin. Sammy might not be the biggest fan, wanting to go more traditional stuff this year. But he was staying in Deans apartment, so if Dean wanted this badass angel, Sam would just have to deal with it. "That's actually pretty awesome." Dean replied as he took it from the other, a small smile playing on his lips as he touched his fingers.
Gabriel shook his head. "Sorry, it was a total reset. Jack helped me with shielding the angels, but I couldn't take Eileen. She'd be a double, there was to much risk in that." Sam's face fell. He had thought maybe this could be his second chance after he pushed her away, ignoring her completely as he grieved for his brother, his best friend and his kid all at once.
"Not Lucifer." Dean agreed quickly.
Dean shook his head, but his eyes softened at the gesture. "Nah, but I do like it Cas, good choice." He complimented the angel. He sat down next to Cas to look through the box himself. His eye eventually fell on a little angel. There were a few in the box but this one had beautiful black wings. The rest of the angel was see through, casting sphere-like rainbow light on the blackness.
A loud bang on the screen woke him up, making him realize he had passed out on the couch. It would probably be better to just go to bed and hopefully pass out again. He was exhausted, not just physically, but his energy was drained in every way imaginable. With some reluctance he made his way to the stairs, passing through the kitchen to get there.
"As for our future, we both know I'm going to screw up again and again, but I'll try to do better each time. I vow to spend the rest of my life loving you and showing you how much I do." He let go of one hand to take Cas's ring out of the box, covering it in his fist. "I used to have only one place that really felt like home. But now, I'm truly home when I'm with you." He showed Cas the ring before sliding it onto his shaking fingers. It was almost an exact copy of Dean's engagement and wedding ring.  The only different was the middle band. Where Dean's ring had grace infused titanium, the one made for Cas had tiny band of glass covering a strip of sheet metal that was dented, bend and polished to give a sparkling effect. Cas's eyes grew wide when he saw it and he let out an unsteady breath. Dean hadn't expected him to understand right away, but it seemed like he did.
So he ignored the hurt in Castiel's eyes. It wasn't like Dean could offer any comfort either way. He just couldn't bring himself to a mental state where he believed things might turn out okay.
Castiel bit his lip, taking a short silence before he spoke. "I know I'm not a man of letters Dean." He said, his voice carrying a defencive edge. "But it's been my home for so long, you can't just expect me to leave completely..."
"What did you pray to me." Castiel asked in a soft voice.
Dean eyed the box curiously. "Why?" He let go of Castiel to grab the box, examining it intently as he sat down. Castiel's box was the exact same, apart from the little tag to keep them apart. Unsure if he was allowed to unwrap it right away, he shook the box near his ear.  No sound, that didn't help.
"Hey Cas, everything okay?" Dean's voice was so soft and careful, it was almost enough to bring tears to Cas's eyes. He just wanted a clear answer from the hunter, not all these mixed signals. He could feel Dean sitting down next to him, but he couldn't face him. Instead he looked over that beautiful garden Dean had made.
Despite not eating, Castiel rarely forgot to stock the fridge and make dinner while Dean was at work. He usually had to reheat it for Dean, but he always made sure there was plate ready. Dean never asked him to take on that role, but Castiel enjoyed taking care of the other and the habit had grown naturally during their time together.
When they broke apart their foreheads leaned against each other. Gabriel was smirking again and Sam smiled a little as he looked into the others amused eyes. "What?" He asked in a soft voice.
"I mean, he knows what he's doing, doesn't he? And it's his house as much as it's mine." Dean shrugged.
In a mixture of nerves and trying to assure Dean he wasn't leaving he blurted out "I just need to get down to one knee." Once he realized how much that line gave away, his eyes grew big as he focused in on Dean's reaction.
Castiel seemed to be just as confused as Dean was. "Am I?" It sounded gentle, sincere. Dean could feel the way Cas studied his face. His eyes bright and innocent. How had Dean ever made himself believe someone that beautiful in every way could ever love him like that.
"You heard me. I had a call with Levar today to ask for an update on the shipment of supplies, but it's gonna take another month. So at the time of your wedding, it's still a huge empty hall. We both agreed there was no use letting that go to waste. Levar has just gotten the go ahead from the top. So it's available if you want. Now I get that it's no party hall but we can spruce it up a little. I talked it through with Bill, he can do a small lighting set up for the dancefloor. Danny's cousin does party rentals so you have a discount on seating and tables. You just need some people to help with setting it all up, but if it's good for you and Cas it's settled."
"Son of a bitch." Dean let out, not towards Sammy, but in shock as the cold hit him.
"The couple has chosen to write their own vows, Dean, would you start?"
"It's just, my brother is making this big deal of decorating our place because this is the first time he's bringing his new boyfriend home. I thought I could help by adding to the decorations." He explained. "But maybe those roses you were reaching for are a bit on the nose. Besides, I don't know if I like the guy yet, so I might not want to encourage it." He joked, relieved the other smiled sincerely again.  The man matched his smile as he took the rose. "How about I put one in, and if it turns out you don't like him, you'll just take it out. Maybe he'll get the message."
Dean smiled as he looked at Cas. They were finally alone in their new house. Castiel didn't look as happy as Dean had hoped he would.
Brian laughed, shaking his head. "I'm telling you to go home. Take the offer, Dean."
"Hello Maura." He greeted her as she successfully navigated her way down the final step. She climbed up on top of one of the kitchen chairs, silently watching as Castiel tested the formula on his wrist to make sure it wouldn't burn Bobby when he drank it. He gave Bobby the bottle before pulling out the chair next to Maura and turning it so they were facing each other. "You're up early." He grinned.
Maura's voice brought him back to the present. She looked at him questioning, making him realize he hadn't answered. "Yes, lots of pictures." A soft smile spread over his face. "We'll first have to see if Uncle Dean wants to wear those rings."
Dean smiled at him all night as they talked about Castiel's work in heaven or Dean's hunts. It was hard to crush that flicker of hope that still plagued Cas's mind. He had always felt it, whenever Dean put a hand on his shoulder or laughed at Cas's attempts at joking. Castiel never let himself ignore those feelings of hope or joy before, but now he knew those were nothing more than acts of kinship, not romantic love.
There was a hard kick under the table and Gabriel winced visibly. Dean gave Cas a confused look and the other looked away, sporting a bigger blush than he had before. Gabriel looked smug, but Dean ignored him completely.  Instead he looked at Cas. He had his suspicions about what had just transpired but it seemed unrealistic. The table stayed relatively silent except for when they ordered the food.
Dean's eyes grew wide as Castiel walked through the door. "Cas." His voice was barely a whisper, but the angel responded, looking right into Dean's eyes.
Sam's face changed. He frowned and Dean tried to ignore how blatantly Sam was studying him. Then the expression softened, turning into a smile. There was something about the look that made Dean feel a blush coming up. "What?"
Castiel grinned, making his way back over to their bed next. "She can take a nap if she wants to." He slid under the blankets and put an arm around Dean, who instantly took the invitation to use him as a pillow again. There was a reason he never won these arguments and he was pretty sure Cas was well aware of what he was doing.
"Me too Sammy, me too."
It wasn't.
The whole project took almost half a year, but it was finally finished. Dean still couldn't believe his life had taken such a turn. During the built, he hadn't gone on a single hunt. He wasn't planning on going back to hunting either, not unless he had to.
Although pouring himself another glass of whiskey was tempting, it wasn't a good idea, avoiding the situation any longer wasn't going to get them through it. Both of them were still silent as Dean walked back over to the table and picked up what he recognized to be their catering contract. "So there's no plan B, no saving grace?"
The initial nerves of their new relation had worn off pretty quickly, and now that they had been living together for almost three months Castiel couldn't even imagine keeping his distance from Dean as they relaxed on the couch or not kissing Dean after the former hunter woke up. How had they spend so much time together, denying themselves this bliss.
Jack seemed to sit on that answer for a little while before he continued to his next question. "Okay, got it. And how does he know if I've been nice?"
He had imagined the moment before, but he was sure he would feel regret and shame. He always thought he'd hate himself after kissing Cas, but that couldn't be less true. He finally felt happiness.
As she continued describing how them being friends for so long only strengthened their relationship, Dean's hands started softly shaking while Cas tried to give him a reassuring smile, hoping Dean understood he agreed with Jody's words. Then she said something Castiel had tried to put into words before. "We don't get to choose who we fall in love with, and Castiel and Dean are a good example of how love sometimes sneaks up on us. But we do get to choose to love each other and there is no clearer example of that either. These two knew what they were choosing when they chose each other, most people can't truly say that. They knew the other as well as they knew themselves when they started on this journey together and it shows. So for all the jokes that will be made tonight about how oblivious they used to be, I'd like to highlight how that only strengthened their relationship once they finally realized. I'm still going to make the jokes. Come on, it took them 12 years, we can laugh about that, but it's with the knowledge that those 12 years formed such a strong basis that there is nothing that can ever break it." She paused, looking at Castiel and Dean as she opened the little box that had been in Bobby's wagon and tilted it towards Dean. Castiel hadn't seen his ring yet and Dean said he wanted to keep it a surprise. Even now, with the box tilted towards Dean, he still didn't know what his ring looked like.
Before Dean went to sleep, he moved his hand to his ring to stroke the titanium band. A smile spread over his face before he sighed. "I'm sorry I hurt you. I should have seen something was wrong before. I've been so busy... I know it's not an excuse. It's just hard sometimes."
When they finally started working on the upstairs, Eileen and Cas had settled on painting the guest room while Dean and Sam would do the master bedroom.
Castiel nodded. "I didn't want to wake you up. You seemed to need the sleep, and you know I don't mind watching over you."
Gabriel chuckled. "This is Sam's nightmare loop." Gabriel said, making Dean squint as he raised his weapon higher. Gabriel shook his head. "Relax Dean-O, I've dropped the nightmare, the loop as well actually."
When Cas and Dean returned from the kitchen, Dean was so focused on Gabriel's smirk he barely noticed the way Sam and Jack were smiling at them. When he noticed Gabriel's smirk only grew wider.
"You know the drill, Sammy. Cas is in charge of the colors." Dean reminded him.
"Stop acting like this is my fault." The words were laced in anger but there was a plead in them. Dean finally looked at Cas, picking up the signs he had been to tired to notice before. He sounded horse and tears were building up in his already red eyes. The last time he had seen Cas this upset was... No, he couldn't think about that. There was enough to deal with without adding past pain.
Castiel was okay with that, with having given his life in order to save his world, in order to save Dean.
Seeing Jack and Claire interact like that was always a delight. It meant a lot to Cas to have both Claire and Jack help him get ready for one of the most important days of his long life. Despite not calling Castiel her father, which he didn't think she should, Castiel did feel like they shared a similar bond. Which only strengthened when she met Jack and decided right away the then all powerful Nephilim and now all powerful god was definitely her little brother, and treated him accordingly.
As soon as Dean got home, he was met with the smell of burgers frying in the pan. He hugged Castiel from behind and leaned in to kiss his cheek as the other flipped the meat. "How was your day?" He pulled back to set the table while Cas talked about babysitting Bobby and the walk they took. It was hard for Dean not to instantly tell Cas about Levar's offer, but he wanted to give Cas a chance to talk about his day, before Dean's news would take up the whole conversation.
Dean felt a rush of warmth and happiness at that statement as he looked back at Cas. He put his arm on the back of the bench behind him. "Yeah. That's exactly what I want this to be. That's why I wanted to leave the bunker in the first place."
Cas was the next to pull Sam into a hug. "I'm really proud of you Sam." He told him.
In the kitchen downstairs, Cas was warming a bottle of formula in the microwave while softly swaying his nephew in his arms. At least Bobby had mostly stopped crying. He was still letting out little huffs and puffs as he waited for his food. Maura should be making her way down the stairs any second now if the sound had woken her up. Castiel turned around, a smile on his face as he saw the little girl climb down the stairs. His niece was making her way down half a step at a time, both arms outstretched with her hands clinging to the railing. "Uncle Castiel?" She sounded like she was still half asleep, so Cas made sure to keep an eye out so she wouldn't fall.
There is gonna be no real uploading scedual for this, I just hope it'll be finished around Christmas
Of course Cas knew him well enough by now to see Dean had something to say. Which was probably why he finished the story within five minutes before looking at Dean. "I feel like you have something more exciting to talk about than double diaper changes?" He plated Dean's dinner and Dean was once again reminded how lucky he was to come home to Cas every day.
"I do." The answer was quick and without a moment of hesitation. They slightly altered the traditional words, since they knew death wouldn't actually 'do them part'. When Dean died, Castiel would be right there in heaven to continue their existence together. After years of avoiding commitment, the idea of an actual eternity together hadn't frightened him at all, much to his own surprise. If anything, part him looked forward to being in heaven alongside Cas and everyone he loved. But only after a life well lived.
"How about you hold off on that for now?" Brian sounded almost amused as he suggested it. "Do you and Cas have time to come look at the new garage this weekend?"
Castiel stayed quiet. This wasn't how he had planned this to go. As the silence started to register, Dean turned to look at him, his muscles tensing where he had relaxed against Castiel seconds ago. The velvet of the box suddenly felt prickly instead of soft, the box itself far to heavy. Dean's eyes bore into him and he couldn't read anything into them.
Dean listen to the stories with a gentle smile on his face. After the sun set the temperature lowered quickly. It did give a new dimension to the garden. Dean had added little lights throughout the flowers, linked to a sensor that switched them on after the sunset. Castiel looked at Dean, instead of the beauty before him. "You did all of this in the short time I was gone?" He asked. Dean nodded, moving a little closer.
Dean seemed to notice Sam's behavior as well, otherwise he would have surely told them they were quite busy watching movies. "I'll put some on. Everything okay?"
"Yeah." Brian was sounding a lot happier than Dean would have expected. "I just called to see if you and Cas have found a replacement venue yet." The sentiment was nice enough, but why would Brian call, just to hear about the wedding.
Dean had been so caught in the feeling of Cas holding his hands so carefully, he barely realized the numbness and pain had subsided. "Better." He agreed.
Claire smiled back at them and Castiel was glad he could keep his promise to her. When he looked back at Dean, the other was still smiling brightly at him as Jody continued. "I don't think I exaggerate when I tell you that meeting Dean and later Castiel changed my life and I wouldn't be where I was today without these extraordinary individuals and I think many people here would say the same thing.  I remember that even before I met Castiel, Dean would mention him every so often. It got to a point where I had to ask Sam if there was something between Dean and that guy he kept mentioning. Even his own brother couldn't give me a straight a straight answer."
To think it hadn't even been worth everything they had gone through. The frustration, the long nights pouring over numbers... With all the stress planning brought, Dean had suggested eloping twice and Castiel started to consider waiting until Dean died because it had to be easier to organize all of this in heaven. Things at Dean's work had gone just as smoothly as planning their wedding had gone, which was to say not at all. Because of a massive delay in transportation, the machinery that was ordered for the new location still hadn't arrived so Dean and his colleagues were still working crazy hours every day.
Sam laughed as he shook the snow crystals from his hair. "Truce?" He asked.
They sat there for a bit, lazily talking about their days in heaven and at the garage as Dean finished both the hotdogs and the smores. After a few hours, Dean started yawning, snuggling closer to Castiel as if to get comfortable for the night. Castiel had been waiting for the right time to pop the question, but his nerves kept getting the better of him. Now it was almost too late. Moving as little as he could, he took the velvet box out of his pocket, clutching it tight. All he needed to do now was to get on one knee. Dean let out a whine when Cas moved away a little, holding him tighter in protest. "Come on, can't we stay a little longer?"
Claire led them to the back of the church where his little brother was waiting. "Sammy." He pulled the other into a hug, than let out a laugh. "You're shaking."
"This thing?" Cas repeated as he played back his memories, trying to see what he had missed.
The kiss that followed pulled away the tension that had been building up. Although he relaxed against the other, Dean's hand was still shaking as Castiel put the ring on it. As soon as Dean traced the band with his finger, a warmth overtook him. It reminded him waking up in Cas's arms, of the way his angel followed bees around the garden and the patience with which he listened to Maura's questions. It brought back memories of their first night in the garden, their first kiss, their first dance at Sam and Eileen's wedding.
He inhaled deeply once Cas reached him, realizing he had forgotten to breathe after seeing his soon to be husband walk towards him.
"I thought this was going to be the house for you and maybe someday a partner." Castiel admitted, seemingly ashamed of the assumpion.
"Thanks." Sam seemed to hesitate, like he wanted to say more. He made half a turn to leave, then turned again to hug Cas before awkwardly pulling away and walking out of the room again.
Cas laid it out so bluntly and Dean wished he had communicated like that, instead of hiding his feelings in prayer and taking Cas's smiles as confirmation.
Bobby hummed as he looked out over the horizon. "Not just that. You deserve to have a life down there as well, with Dean and Sam. The three of you have fought for it, now you get to enjoy it. That don't mean you get to abandon Jack up here, I know you wouldn't. But for when you're down there, just know someone's keeping an eye on him up here."
"Right," Sam laughed. "Because I'm sure you would have made that distinction back then."
Rowena was one of the bridesmaids as well. She had just showed up one day and told the boys 'yes I know everything' and had been their helping witch since then. She trained Sam even further and she'd grown quite close with Eileen as well throughout all of it.
It took Dean a little time to get used to having someone in his bed again. Even more with that person being Cas. It wasn't so much that he was sleeping next to a man. After he believed they had been dating for months, he was comfortable with the idea that he loved Cas, male vessel and all. It was still hard to accept Cas not only loved him, but that he wouldn't leave Dean when the charm wore off. Sleeping next to Cas with the other awake made Dean more self-conscious than he expected. Last time it happened, in the garden, Dean wasn't even aware he was falling asleep, with comfort and exhaustion doing all the work. This time, it wasn't that easy. Cas had seen him battered and bruised, but that was another kind of unflattering and back then, in the heat of the fight, Dean hadn't cared how he looked.
Cas seemed to notice the enjoyment as well. "Why have we never celebrated Christmas before?" He asked Dean when Jack was out of the room. "You seem to like it a lot. You always said you thought it was 'some crap to make people spend money'."
Castiel looked amazed, eyes wide and mouth agape. He turned to Dean, taking a second before he spoke. "This looks amazing. I didn't expect... This is great."
He and Cas had talked about maybe having children when Eileen was pregnant with Maura. It wasn't really something Dean imagined as a possibility after getting together with Cas, but his neighbors seemed to do the thinking for him. Speculations grew as the couple prepared for the arrival of their niece. Anyone that came to their house could see the stack of parenting books Castiel was reading. On hot days, Dean had the garage door open as he worked on a crib he was preparing for when they babysat. More than once, a well meaning neighbor had asked them if they had a surrogate or if they were adopting.
"Thanks guys." He didn't want to be ungrateful, but a whiskey glass couldn't be the only reason they looked that excited. "Uhm... What is this about?"
A pang of guilt hit Dean at the question. Of course he wasn't happy that they might not get married. But what was he supposed to do? Work had been hell and the only thing he wanted was to come home and relax a little before passing from exhaustion. But even that was too much to ask. He just fell from one problem into the next lately and honestly, he didn't have it in him to deal with yet another complication on their road back to happiness.
Dean smiled gratefully. If Cas wasn't happy with the idea, he would have declined. But even though he might not have been the most attentive partner in the last few months, Cas was still there for him. His one point of steadiness. He couldn't wait until the new location was up and running so he would have more time to spend with the other and show him how grateful he was for being able to rely on Cas.
"What are you talking about."
Which was why it didn't surprise Dean to hear the door across from theirs open a few moments after Castiel went downstairs. The patter of small feet against a wooden floor then down the stairs told him it was going to be a long time before he'd get his angel  back.
After everything that had happened, it shouldn't have surprised Sam in the way that it did. He had no words, no comfort. He pulled Dean into a tight hug. "I wish we could do it all over, the whole thing the way we wanted, without Chuck pulling our strings."
“In about an hour, they’re finishing up now.” She told him. “You and Sam can both go in now but only one of you can stay.” She explained as the nurse told her. “If he does wake up it has to be in a calm environment.” She continued and Cas nodded. Sam did as well. “We’ll take turns.” He told them and Cas agreed. Jess was glad neither of them fought to see Dean more, since both of the men cared equally.  She announce she had to take care of something and left the two, grabbing her phone to cancel their honeymoon to Paris.
"I love you." Dean's voice was low. In this room full of people, the statement was meant for Cas alone.
"Dean." Cas's voice was soft as he stepped closer, putting a hand on Dean's cheek to make him look at him.
Dean actually missed this a lot, just sitting and talking with his brother. He wasn't someone with a load of friends, he didn't really like most people. The only exceptions being Sam and Bobby, but that was family. Still when Sam moved away, half of his social circle was gone. It didn't cause him to much pain, but it made him appreciate these moments.
The difference between her and her dad was, Sammy only had Dean when they were growing up. Dean was a kid himself, with no idea or interest in how the world worked outside of hunting. Maura on the other hand had an ancient being with a philosophic outlook that didn't need to sleep and was more than happy to indulge her in all her questions. Even though she wasn't aware of what Cas really was, she had long figured out her uncle Castiel wouldn't try to tuck her in again right away if she woke up with a million new questions and ideas. Eileen's perseverance also wasn't lost on the little girl, she knew just how she was able to make things work out for her, no matter how young and small she was.
Dean looked into his eyes, feeling a low tingle in his hands as the pain started to eb away. He nodded softly. "Of course." He said in a voice so soft it was barely audible. Castiel smiled at that. He rubbed his thumbs slowly over the backs of Dean's hands.
Jack furrowed his eyebrow, giving Claire an unsure look before looking at Castiel again. "Do you doubt that he will?"
"It's for Singers salvage and repair yard. I'm a car-mechanic." They were about as far appart as two jobs could be. Where Dean spend all day with oil covered hands, surrounded by hard metal and engine sound, Castiel spend it with flowers in his hands, surrounded by sweet smells while smiling that smile of his at the happy costumers.
Apparently Marjorie's husband, Casper, died around the same time Dean bought the house. She didn't really have a lot of people to talk too and it was still hard to be reminded of him. She apologized for dropping her coffee but Dean assured her it was fine, thinking back at how lost he had been every time he had to grief Castiel. Back then, he couldn't even stomach Sam mentioning his name without feeling like he was about to break down. So he stayed silent, holding her hand until she smiled through her tears. "Cas... Casper, he is probably looking down on me right now, telling me not to be so sad. But it's hard, you know."
Dean had to stop himself from laughing. Castiel smiled. "He must be proud of you, putting up something like this at your age."
It was finally weekend... No matter how much Dean enjoyed working on cars all day long, it was exhausting. Especially now that their garage was making a name for itself and demand was picking up quickly. The last few weeks in particular had been insane, but he could put that all behind him for two days and just spend some downtime with Cas, relaxing around the house.
long time, but not when I do this." To demonstrate she closed her eyes tightly enough to make her nose wrinkle.
Mistletoe.
"Castiel Novak," Jody started. "Do you take Dean Winchester to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to uphold the vows you made before him and love him, comfort him, honor and keep him for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health. To be faithful only to him so long as you both exist?"
Lights came on when it got dark. They illuminated the flowers beautifully. Castiel looked at Dean, it really was amazing to see what he had done. "You did all of this in the short time I was gone?" He asked impressed. Dean nodded, moving a little closer. Castiel thought he had learned a lot about interpreting humans, especially Dean, during his last twelve years on earth. But now he was at a loss.
"Okay come on kid." Dean called to Jack as he stepped out of the car. Jack followed him to the trunk before Dean opened it and handed him an axe. "You wanted to pick the tree so you get to work for it." He grinned. "Now pick out a tree you like." The roads had been slippery due to the snow but Jack's eyes grew large as he saw the sight of the snow covering the pines.
Dean chuckled. "I know it's you, Cas..."
Gabriel didn't even look at Sam to see if he noticed, he just grinned as he mused. "Oh, how did that get there." He mused innocently as he stood right under the doorway and it suddenly hit Sam that neither of them had even brought a reef to hang.
When Dean went to bed, he ignored Gabriel's comment about Cas joining him. As he was lying in his bed, the events of the day being played back in his mind, he couldn't help but smile. Castiel had not only not stopped him, he had kissed him back. And no one seemed to really care about it. They all expected it, if he had to believe them.
Dean didn't feel heat in the way he expected. He had thought Cas's hands would radiate heat, but it was like he was giving of the heat himself, radiating it outwards. The sting let up slowly, until it was gone completely, and they were just left, staring at each other while Cas held Dean's hand.
He was lost in his thoughts when he suddenly heard the undeniable sound of Dean coming down the stairs again. Why was Dean still up? It was already 1 AM and Dean had work tomorrow morning. Dean stayed silent as he climbed down the stairs with Castiel eying him intently. Once he stepped into the kitchen he paused, staring at the floor. Castiel looked at him, waiting for Dean to meet his eyes. When Dean finally did, it was hard to look past how tired he was. But there was something else there.
Gabriel talked Sam into watching jack ass and Dean was convinced further that he and Gabriel would hit it off. When it got late Sam announced they should go to sleep. He seemed awkward about bringing his boyfriend into his bedroom with Dean there, but honestly, Dean preferred it to seeing them al cuddly on the couch. He stayed up for a bit longer before heading to bed himself. As he turned off the lights on the tree he sighed. Even if he was lonely, he was lucky Sammy had found someone decent enough. He headed to his empty bed, wondering if he would be alone again next year.
"I like it a lot, Dean. I'm glad you showed me." He assured the other.
"He isn't mine, you know. She was pregnant when we met. I always tried to be a good father to him, a father like Bobby was too us."
When he got to work he put the lights next to the tree. He was sure someone would figure out they meant to go on it, and he wasn't in any mood to put them on there himself.
Gabriel huffed. "Stop being a spoilsport and just help me. I promise you'll be rewarded. Sam gave him another look, wondering what that was supposed to mean. It was pretty clear what it meant as he followed Gabriel to his bedroom door, only to see the mistletoe hanging over the door.
Dean nodded at the compliment. "Yeah, the kid's got an eye for it." He agreed, giving Cas a smile. "How about the two of us plant this bad boy as the rest of you go look for the decorations. I'm pretty sure we left them in the library"
As Castiel made his way down the stairs and over to where Sam was sitting, he brushed his fingers over the railing of the stairs, the metal cold to the touch. Sam watched him with careful eyes, only looking away to add another ingredient into the grind of fine powder. Castiel wasn't sure what he put in, but it looked like some dried herb. "Still as skillful as ever." Cas commented as he looked at the fine mixture.
"Yeah, you like it?"
Claire smiled softly when she pulled back, tugging her hair behind her ear. "I'll go find Kaia and the rest, I'll see at the reception." With that she turned back to go to the main entry as Cas and Jack hid away in a room to the side until the ceremony started.
Castiel shook his head before resting it on Dean's shoulder. He liked this part of Dean coming home, where they both talked about their days, even if there wasn't a lot to tell. After years of lying or keeping things from each other, they could finally be open. "Not really, but I did go up there around noon to spend some time with Jack. He's coming down to earth for a visit pretty soon."
"I'm not living alone." He couldn't bring himself to look at Marjorie as he said it. Why couldn't the first time saying this be to someone from a younger, more accepting generation, instead of a woman in her eighties. "I moved here with my partner, Cas."
They stayed away from the topic of weddings and venues until after Dean finished eating. Instead they talked about their day like they used too do when Dean came home. Castiel talked about babysitting Bobby and Dean talked about the guy that put fuel in the oil tank. After they did the washing up, Dean sighed, no longer able to talk around it anymore. "So I guess we need to talk about what to do now."
After looking around for a bit, Jack's eyes fell on a tree that reminded him of the one he had seen in a townsquare. "That's a nice one." He said with excitement as he pointed at the large tree. Dean shook his head. "I don't think we can put that one on baby." He told Jack as he put a hand on his shoulder. "Try again."
"I just wanted to let you know, I killed another vampire nest today. Nothing I couldn't handle of course... It was almost boring in a way. Hunting... It ain't the same without you and Sam. I'm glad he quit, and I know you'll be back to join in a few days, hopefully..."
Sam gasped at the sudden overwhelming cold, but stood up with a grin nonetheless. He was just quick enough to shove his half formed snowball down the back of Dean's neck before he could get away.
"Yeah, it's hardly too early for that." Dean shrugged. "We've been living together since long before this thing started."
"Thank you."
"You...." Castiel was at a loss for words. He looked at the house briefly before finding Dean's eyes again. He looked so vunrable. "I didn't realize it was for both of us. You seemed so excited when we passed here, I wanted to be excited for you. I mean, when you didn't bring it up again, I figured you just didn't feel the way I did. I thought I had been clear." Apparently he had been at first. But it seemed like he took that certainty away. "I love you, I want a life you. I want to watch you grow old and spend an eternity with you in heaven afterwards." He made sure to say it in the plainest terms possible, so there was no posibility for Dean to misunderstand or doubt the meaning behind his words.
Jody addressed the crowd again. "You can join us in the next room to celebrate the union of Dean and Castiel Winchester."
The man nodded, though Dean could see he was still confused.
But now Dean was lying there, far more broken then Cas had ever been and there was nothing Cas could do. His wounds were treated and if Cas would want to take revenge on the cause it would be on himself, since he had been the one driving. He took Dean’s hand softly and felt a reassuring squeeze from Sam on his shoulder. He smiled over at him and smiled softly. He focussed on Dean again, rubbing the back of his hand with his thumb softly. Cas saw his tears hit the white sheet Dean was lying on. When he squeezed Dean’s hand softly he almost expected Dean to squeeze back, but of course he didn’t.
When he went back home he purposefully avoided the flower shop on his route, not wanting to make Castiel more uncomfortable if he happened to see him pass by. Instead he took a detour home, getting take out before he got back. When he got back Sam was working on something or other for school. Whatever it was, there were notebooks and papers scattered on the table, all marked, colorcoded and scribbled on.
"Just to be sure, You want me to move in with you?" Castiel asked again.
Whe Dean returned with beer and plates for the pie, he asked Cas how he had been. They talked about heaven for a bit and Jack's efforts to resurect angels. Dean enjoyed those moment together so much, he almost forgot he made dinner plans with Sam and Eileen. When he realized he shot Sam a quick text saying he was on his way and he was taking Cas.
Castiel turned back to Dean, who was by now blushing and seemed to be nailed to the ground. "Where were we Dean?" He asked with a small smile, putting a hand on Dean's cheek.
The other didn't seem to notice the strain in Castiel's voice. Dean walked into the kitchen, kissing the top of Cas's head absentmindedly. Castiel's eyes followed him though the kitchen, willing himself to tell Dean what happened. In the time it took him to build up the courage, Dean made his way to the fridge. A second after he opened it, his entire demeanor changed. Slumped shoulders pulled tight and even from behind, the strain in Dean's jaw became visible as it pulled at the back of his neck. Castiel recognized the stance from years ago and even with Dean still looking the other way, the expression that went with it was imprinted into Castiel's mind. No doubt Dean's eyebrows were pulled tight, his lips a firm straight line and his eyes empty, staring through everything with no mercy.
The regional manager, Levar, opened the door and stepped out of the office to greet him. "Dean." He stretched out his hand. "Long time no see. How are you doing?"
"Any other criteria, or are you just going to kiss me now?"
"Awesome day," Dean grinned in agreement. "But we have have two more hours until we have to get ready. We don't have to get up just yet." He pulled himself closer to Cas, pecking his lips again.
"I just wanted to say, I'm happy for you."
"He's got a list, he checks it twice actually."
"I'll ask him." Her words were still quiet but her hands made up for that, finger jolting at her chest.
"Couldn't keep your mouth shut?" Dean asked, sounding annoyed. He wasn't sure what to think. It didn't feel like Jack or Sam minded, and Sam's reaction was what he had been afraid of.
"What are you talking about Gabe?" Sam asked, eying his brother. Gabriel shrugged. "Well I kinda figured you'd get yourselves into some deep shit. I had expected it to be the whole Lucifer Michael thing, but holy shit you really outdid yourself.  "Anyway, with my little trick, I decided I could always add a little failsafe. A kind of restarting point..."
"It's not. I really am happy" The realization hit him harder than he expected. Of course there were bad times, but he
"Everything okay?" Castiel asked in a muted tone.
"Yeah, it's hardly too early for that." Dean shrugged. "We've been living together since long before this thing started."
They sat in silence as Dean tried not to think about of canceling their wedding two weeks before it was supposed to happen. Maura and Bobby would grow out of the clothes Sam and Eileen bought them for the wedding. A lot of people were staying at hotels to attend, which they probably couldn't cancel anymore. What if Marjorie didn't make it until then? She was getting older, even if she was healthy, people didn't last forever, not even with an angel secretly healing them with his every touch.
"You haven't heard..." Dean wondered how many times his heart could break while celebrating his first house. "I..." He fell short, trying to find a way to express what he had been trying to tell Cas all along.
"You just might." Dean assured him, still smiling. "No wonder you love Christmas, business must be booming this time of year. Even without my brothers weird way of over compensating."
During the meal a meager conversation played up again about Christmas plans and new years. Sam talked about their mishap on the ice ring and as long as Dean and Cas didn't talk to each other directly, the conversation kept pace. Just before their desert was served Gabriel told Sam he really had to come with him to meet a few friends Gabriel had spotted a few tables over. No one bought the bullshit excuse, but Dean didn't want to comment and Sam followed Gabriel any way.
"You... You want to live here?" Castiel asked, slightly confused as he looked at the house in the rearview. So Dean was planning to move out... He should have seen it coming, but he had tried to ignore the reality of it for so long. There was no reason for Dean to stay in the bunker with Cas, not if he wanted to move on with a new life.
Dean was still a little out of it, staring silently at his phone for another moment. When he looked up at Cas, the other looked worried. "That was what we needed..." Dean muttered, still in slight disbelief.
A small smile played on Dean's lips as he got up, clapping the dirt off his hands. "I think so. He's got a lot of questions about santa, that's for sure."
Jacks eyes lit up as he saw the tree stand upright in its place. Dean smiled. "How about we start with the hot chocolade before it gets cold. It's tradition you know, hot chocolade and cookies for breakfast and then a day of decorating."
"You mean, it's because we're men? I thought the wedding was too big or too small. I didn't realize..." He stopped mid sentence, swallowing hard. Dean had always been more weary of peoples prejudices towards them. Although they had been fortunate in their neighbors and most of Dean's colleagues, it took Dean some time to be comfortable holding Castiel's hand in public. He was finally at a point where homophobia wasn't the first thing coming to mind and Castiel hated having to tell Dean that this time, he would have been right.
"It's just excitement." Sam assured him. Bobby grinned as he cut in, hugging him as well. "Best be careful with those shaky hands boy, you don't want to mess up when signing 'I do'." Sam grinned. "I'll try not to."
"Have I told you how perfect you are Cas?" He asked when the kiss broke.
"Hey Cas." Dean was lying in bed, his eyes open as he prayed to his angel. He didn't pray to him every night, but he liked checking in every now and again while Cas was in heaven.
"He misses you too, it's just hard for him to get away. He has to make sure everything is taken care off first. Sometimes I think it's too much for him to be up there the whole time, but Bobby assured me he's all handling it very well." Castiel had taken some time to talk to Bobby to ask for Dean's hand. Bobby of course laughed at him and told him that was their own business. But he seemed happy about Castiel's plan. "Bobby says hi as well. He told me to make sure you stay away from him for a long time."
Gabriel grabbed Sam's wrist, pulling him into the open door frame as well.
Dean nodded softly before swallowing. Without a word, he made his way over. Castiel was still sat in the chair, looking up at the man he loved as Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel and pressing him closer. Tears streamed from Castiel's eyes, wetting Dean's shirt as he clung to the other. Lips pressed against the top of his head before Dean let out a calming hush. "We'll figure it out Cas," Dean muttered against Castiel's hair. "I love you."
Once she calmed down a little she squeezed Dean's hand, the hint of a smile played on her face. "You best hold onto him while you can. Don't waste a moment." With her free hand she opened the locket she wore on a chain around her neck. Inside the locket was a picture of a kind looking man. "I lost my Cas almost a year ago."
"I thought moving out was your response. That was all that changed." Cas admitted.
"Actually that's perfect!" Dean said happily. "I'll take it."
Sam was already cleaning up the supplies he used when he answered that it wasn't a problem. They stayed in the bunker for a some time after the ritual was done. With the kids and work, it had been some time since he and Sam had last hung out with just the two of them. They reminisced about when they were still living in the bunker, hunting every day.  They talked about how Sam and Eileen planned their wedding and about how Castiel wanted his wedding to go until it was almost time for Dean to come home.
"Good, I miss the kid."
Cas nodded and rushed inside. Dean wanted to follow him like he had done the day before but Cas was back in no time. "There you go."
What else had he expected. No matter how much Castiel tried to ignore it, things hadn't been great in the last few months. The build up had been gradual. At some point Dean stopped calling to let Cas know when he'd be home. As stress and exhaustion weighed heavier each day, Dean didn't always remember to ask how Cas's day had been until he stopped asking all together. Stories about his day were sparser as well. Instead they sat in silence as Dean wolfed down his dinner before moving over to the couch to watch TV.
happy. He took a deep breath as he tried to stop himself from getting to emotional before the wedding even started. "Thanks Sammy." He pulled his brother into a hug just before the music began playing in the other room. Despite Eileen filming everything, both brothers peeked trough the blinders of the meeting room to watch the start of the ceremony. No matter how much every one had worked on dressing the place up, it was still more a garage than it was a party hall. But it hardly mattered when the room was packed with people Dean cared about.
"An angel?" He then asked, repeating the words slowly and deliberately, without subverting his eyes. Dean rubbed the back of his neck wondering if it was a weird request and trying to break the tension that seemed to build. "Uh, yeah... An angel, you know." He looked away with a nervous smile playing on his lips. "I mean you've got all this Christmas crap here so I figured you might have one. You know, one of those that you put on top of the tree." He clarified. He looked around to see if he could find one himself and realized why the seller had been unsure on how to help, there were angel decorations of pretty much every kind displayed around the small shop. When he caught his eyes again the intense stare turned into an understanding one
"Sammy, Jack, how about you?" Gabriel out of the way so they could look inside the box. Sam got a little fake shiney candy cane and Jack got one of Santa in a sleigh.
"I'm bi so I guess past me has a point." He shot back, earing a snort from his brother.
Jack seemed to think about it. "Okay..." He said with doubt in his voice. "But does he think hunting monsters is nice?"
Dean could barely hear the first beep of the his alarm before Cas turned it off. With a slight groan he tried to will himself to leave the bed. Before he moved away the sleep fog left his brain just enough to remember what day it was. He opened his eyes to look up at his soon to be husband and suddenly felt wide awake.
Dean had decided to finish by going floor by floor. The first floor was finished. The walls were painted and most  of the furniture was placed. Sam had suggested to start with the bedroom so Dean could sleep there instead of heading back to the bunker each night, but Dean wanted the first night in their new house to be special. If he could get himself to ask Cas, he wanted Cas there with him in bed, watching over him. As dumb and creepy as the phrase had once sounded, it was nice now.
Dean rolled his eyes. "It's not that bad." He objected. The pain stung, but it was nothing compared to being bitten, sliced or cut, so he could get through it. He turned away to turn on the oven.
But then Jack safed him, like a light pulling him from the darkness. Suddenly the world was changed. Chuck was no longer in charge, Jack ruled heaven and earth and heaven got back to its purpose. Castiel knew all those things should matter more, but all he could think about was that now he had to face Dean. There was no way for Dean to ignore a statement as big as that. Or at least, so Cas thought.
Eileen hugged him before she left to prepare Maura for flower girl duty. Now it was just him and Sam, both listening out for the music to que them it was time to walk to the altar.
Castiel flushed. "It's not our house. It's just his."  He corrected him. "But I have been working on it with him a lot."
Apparently he was as skilled in suppressing emotions as he had hoped. He could feel Dean's eyes on him as he stared at the ground, willing himself not to cry.
"Dean Winchester, do you take Castiel Novak to be your lawfully wedded husband? Do you promise to uphold the vows you made before him and love him, comfort him, honor and keep him for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness and health. To be faithful only to him so long as you both exist?"
The cries  that woke him up slowly died down after Castiel picked Bobby up from the crib beside their bed. He took the baby boy out of their room, softly humming a lullaby. Hopefully the noise hadn't woken up Maura yet. It was nearly impossible to get her back to bed once she was awake.
"Nothing apparently...."
Cas was sitting on a pier, looking out over the river. Everything looked so peaceful, like Chuck hadn’t forsaken the place and left it to crumble. He could hear Dean talking to him, it was so automatic, the way he kept looking out for Dean’s prayers.
Dean put an arm over the back of the bench behind Cas, and it almost felt like he put an arm around him. Castiel didn't know what to think about it, but when Dean spoke he was reminded that all hope was futile. "Yeah. That's exactly what I want this to be." Dean agreed. "That's why I wanted to leave the bunker in the first place."
"What do you mean?"
When Dean made his way to the kitchen, Cas followed him wordlessly. Dean turned on the oven. "Jack seems to really be enjoying himself." Dean said as he looked over at Cas. Castiel nodded. "Yes this was a good plan." Castiel agreed. "I still don't get why you gave him the gloves. He's a nephilim, you know he can handle the cold."
Hair that wouldn't be as soft and malleable in a few hours. Not after Dean styled it with that pomade that made his hair smell of bourbon and oak. When they danced, that scent would fill him as he would rest his head on Dean's shoulder. Another glance at the clock told Castiel only two minutes had passed. This was torture. He had tried everything to make the time go by faster, but nothing worked.
Sam looked at Dean, who ripped his eyes away from his angel long enough to give his brother a quick nod. "Go to her, get to know her again. We'll meet in the bunker, it's got to be empty at this time."
Jack's excitement reminded Dean of how much he liked it when dad took him to the Christmas Tree Farm, before Yellow Eyes stole every sense of normalcy he knew. It wasn't quite the same. This wasn't picking out the nicest tree among merry families, this was illegally stealing a tree from a forest. But still, he wanted this to be as magical for the boy as he himself once thought Christmas was. Castiel had been right, Jack deserved to be a kid for once, and they all deserved to celebrate the holidays as a family.
"But, we've always been close like that. It's not like you ever tried to kiss me or hold my hand."
Kevin sighed. “Skipping stones is not as impressive now that I can move the stone with my mind.” He admitted. “But at least it’s something.”
Cas woke up to the sound of the door opening. A nurse came in, looking at Dean, than Cas with big eyes. Cas barely looked at her. He noticed a hand squeezing his. “Dean?” He asked, getting up to see Dean’s eyes half opened and a painful smile on his lips. “Didn’t want to wake you.” Dean muttered, sighing softly.
The night flew by in a haze of stories and laughter. Castiel cherished moments like this. He knew they were in short supply. He barely noticed the time until Sam and Eileen announced they were going to leave. Jack got up as well. Although he could now afford to leave heaven every now and again, he still needed to be up there a lot, so the moments had to be brief. Everyone hugged eachother goodbye and soon it was only Cas and Dean left.
"I don't know," Castiel answered again. This time it didn't sound as broken as it had last night. "You're home early. Is something wrong?"
Castiel looked at the house again. Dean had never really been one to care about the street view, so it had to be about something else. "It needs a lot of care, don't you think?" Castiel said, watching the hunters face as he did. He wasn't sure what sort of reaction Dean expected of him.
"Not that I recall." Castiel teased as he pulled Dean down on the bench with him.
The four of them went down the stairs so Dean could make blueberry pancakes as Castiel set the table and added a jar of honey from last weeks harvest. For some reason, Maura started interrogating Dean as soon as he sat down, asking him what shapes and colors he liked and if he liked parties. She was always full of questions like that. It was as exhausting as it was fun. Although he loved his niece and nephew, Dean was more than happy that Sam picked them up around noon so Dean and Cas could spend the rest of their Sunday together.
Dean walked over as soon as the coffee was running and walked up behind Cas, resting his hands on Castiel's shoulders. Castiel had never expected Dean to seek out his touch that much now that they were open about their feelings, but he couldn't complain. The feeling of Dean touching him assured him Dean was still there with him. That he was safe and close and chose to be there with Cas. Hopefully there would come a time he didn't need that constant assurance but for now, both of them seemed to seek it.
"No," Dean sighed. "I don't think there are any venues that can take us on such a short notice. If we want to keep the date, were probably going to have to size down a lot and hopefully find some other big venue to have a party in a few months."
Dean was unsure what changed. He'd gotten off half an hour early to take care of this and now Brian was asking him to set those things aside and focus on work instead. Why would Cas even have to be there. "It's quite a busy weekend for both of us. Why?"
"Or Bobby Padraic for a boy." Eileen added.
"Yes, except mondays." The guy informed him, handing him the flowers. Dean nodded, unconsciously storing that information in the back of his mind.  "Guess I'll see you around then." He said before leaving and the man nodded. "Until next time!" He called after Dean, and Dean decided that next time should come sooner rather than later.
"I'm just trying to come to terms with it all, you know." Sam sighed. "I don't feel like this place is... Right." He walked over to the railing, looking out over the endless horizon. "I had quite a life you know... You're sort of an uncle now."
Cas leaned in for a kiss the moment their eyes met. Their lips barely touched as he cupped Dean's cheek. His thumb bristled against Dean's stubble. He was looking right into Dean's eyes,  filling him with warmth as those soft lips formed a smile against his. "I love you." Castiel didn't move back to speak and Dean could feel the words move through him as their lips brushed together with each word.
Claire snorted at the line that Jody didn't seem to realize was a pun. Kaia hushed her despite chuckling softly. Dean was laughing as well, but stopped after shooting Castiel a half apologetic grin.
As soon as Dean stepped into the house he called out for his angel. No response. Dean had a slight fear that Cas had been called back up to heaven at the last moment, but he was sure Cas would have let him know if that was the case. Maybe he was at his hive.  As soon as Dean went into the garden to check, he spotted him next to their fire pit instead. "What's this?" Dean asked on his way over, before greeting Cas with a kiss. Dusk was already falling, but the fire took away the chill of the early spring evening.
Castiel walked over. "You can always visit." He suggested as he watched Dean work.
"Yeah, I mean everything kind of changes, and there are new trends every Christmas." The excited way the other looked as he talked talked about it almost made Dean enthusiastic as well.
Dean knew that when he was a kid, Mary and John would work on a pie together after he went to bed on Christmas eve. He later realized they used it as a cover up for why they were walking around the house late at night as they put the presents under the tree.
Castiel looked at it. "It needs a lot of care, don't you think?"
"So what about you? Still going where the Whiskey takes you?" Sam asked, making Dean look up at him.
"You... You want to live here?" Castiel asked, slightly confused as he looked at the house in the rearview.
"Of course." Castiel nodded, finally pulling the box out of his coat pocket. When he opened it, he swallowed hard. This was the right choice. Sam seemed to agree, taking the silver ring from where it was wedged in a satin filling. It was a little broader than wedding rings typically were since Dean had always favored broader rings in the past. It didn't have too much flare; just a silver ring with a brushed titanium band embedded across the middle. That was most important part of the ring, or at least is would be.
Gabriel got closer, but the two hunters had let their guard down enough to allow him to do so. He handed Sam a note. "I have her adres. She's hunting cases. It might not be a way to fix what you used to have, but it's a chance to do something better."
Castiel took a second to answer. "It just takes some getting used to this all." He admitted, looking over the garden.
Slowly his headache faded, clearing his mind a little. "So our only option is to reschedule," he concluded. "Because I'm not going to get married, knowing I cut out so many people."
--------
Dean still didn't know how Gabriel had managed to get a reservation in for Christmas eve in such a short time. he had insisted he wanted to take Sam and Dean to dinner in return for their hospitality. Even if Dean saw it as a way for Gabe to show off the money he could throw around, Dean was never one to say no to free food. When they got to the restaurant Dean smiled widely. He had expected some over the top fancy restaurants where every entre came with a weird utensil and a microscope. Instead, it was a decent steakhouse. It was expensive, just like Dean had expected, but not as bad as he thought. As soon as they entered Gabriel made his way to one of the waiters and announced their reservation. "Novak, table of four." There was a bit of mischief in his eyes as he stared over at Dean for the briefest moment. Before Dean could ask who the fourth one would be, he got his answer by looking in the direction the waiter was headed.
"Okay, so which one of these is for the bedroom?" Sam asked, showing Dean the options Cas had sworn were different when they bought the paint.
"Uncle Castiel?"
He could feel the silence grow tense as he waited for a response, but none came. This was it, he had made it too real and he was about to be punished with rejection. When he couldn't take it anymore and he just wanted Cas to get over it, he looked up. When he looked into the others eyes, he could see the other trying to figure out what to do next.
Instead he decided to just go in and ask. This time he waited by the counter quietly, looking at the man that was working on something again, not wanting to disturb him. Even though he could only see his back, Dean knew it was the guy that had helped him yesterday. He had to be pretty focused, considering the fact that he seemed unaware that he was no longer alone. Dean looked him over again before deciding to announce his presence after all. "Hey." He said, making the other turn towards him instantly.
Dean's eyes flew open, his shock almost masking the hurt in his eyes. "Maybe someday? Listen Cas, am I missing something here?"
But this time he wouldn’t give in, he couldn’t. Not again. It had taken him so long to realize he was nothing more then a tool. And no matter how sincere Dean sounded, he wasn’t going to put himself through that. Not for Dean, not for anyone.
"No dumdum," she rolled her eyes as a chuckle left her. "Have you seen the way those two look at each other? I'm surprised they aren't glued together right now. I'm just saying, your dad is looking great." The comment seemed to calm him a little as he smiled again.
Apparently he was spot on with his response, since Dean's excitement grew. "Yeah, but I like that sort of stuff. It's fulfilling to live in a house you practically built."
Dean wasn't sure who initiated their first kiss, he was too caught up in the moment to register who pressed in before those soft lips hit his. He also had no idea how long they stayed like that. Kissing softly as they held each other.
Castiel had forgotten what an anchor Dean could be to him and how much clearer the world was when Dean was on his side. He met his eyes and managed a little smile before leaning in to kiss Dean. It was clear the other was getting tired, even if he tried to ignore that for Castiel's sake. "Thank you, Dean. How about you try to get some sleep. It's going to be a long day tomorrow."
Jack wasn't sure why this was so much fun, but he let out a laugh as Dean declared. "Us against them!" after locking eyes with Jack and Cas. It was a silly fight but perhaps that was just it.
Castiel walked over. "You can always visit." He suggested as he watched Dean work.
"Yeah...But that's just not the same..." He said as he got up once one of the larger blocks caught fire.
"Sleep well, Dean."
Sam and Dean both grabbed the knifes they always tucked under their pillow, but neither of them lead the attack. Sam let his arm fall once reality set in. "So this was all you?" He asked, his voice hurt. Gabriel shook his head. "That was all Chuck actually. But I thought you deserved better."
If Cas had stayed away any longer, Dean had half a mind to go downstairs and tell him Maura needed to get back to bed. Just as he started moving towards the side of the bed so he could force himself to get up, Castiel was walking up the stairs. He was obviously trying hard to be quiet, despite knowing Dean wasn't falling back asleep without him. After a brief drop off in Maura's room, Cas appeared in the door with Bobby sleeping in his arms. "She's going to be tired tomorrow," Dean commented while Cas tucked Bobby in as well.
"You want me to make you something like that?" He asked as he got out from behind the counter to grab some materials. "Anything else you want in that?" He asked. Dean looked at the flowers but shook his head. "Like I said, I know jack shit about this kind of stuff, but you go crazy man, just make something you'd like." He assured him.  The man glanced at him quickly before focusing back on the vases. "Is it for someone special?" He inquired as his hand fell on a red rose.
"On this day 19 november 2020 we are here to celebrate love."
Dean grinned. "If you need a break, fine." He teased.
Dean still slept in the bunker during the project, so that was where Cas reappeared with pie after his visit upstairs. Dean just got out of the shower, cleaning of the days grime when the angel called him. Dean's grin widened, he had missed Cas more than he cared to admit, and he was excited to show him what he did with the place.
"Hello Dean."
"Dean." He stepped closer, hoping to show Dean it was okay, that he was there. He put a head on Dean's cheek to try and get him to look at the angel.
Castiel nodded slowly, eying Dean carefully. "They caught me off guard. I barely registered that she was canceling, let alone why..." He admitted. Dean lifted Cas's hand to his lips, pressing a kiss on the back of it. It was a tiny gesture but it meant so much.
"And you love uncle Dean," She argued, before Castiel could think of something else to say.
Dean stayed alone in the common room. How dare Sam accuse him of driving Castiel away. Dean had just been angry; Cas should be used to this by now. He should know Dean didn’t actually want him to leave. When most of Dean’s frustration subsided Dean realized that Cas had been putting up with a lot. And even though Dean refused to believe it was all his fault, Sam was right, he had to fix this. It had been something between Dean and Cas. He remembered the relieve in Cas’s voice when he heard Dean wasn’t going to fling himself into the ocean in a box. The pain in his own heart when Cas died and how much he hated Jack at first.
Cas removed his hand again so Dean could look at him. "Not at once."
"Well you are. I love you, Cas." As difficult as it had been to say those words the first time, he now made sure to tell Cas he loved him every single day.
"Hi, what can I do for you?" She asked as her eyes followed his. "Or are you here for Castiel?"
He choked on his words, the silence surrounding him. He looked around the room, expecting the angel to listen, expecting it to be enough. But no flutter of wings, no wonky tie and no hand on his shoulder.
Jack looked at him confused. "Why can't I have that. I've drunk before... I barely notice it." He assured Dean.
After Dean and Cas both gave him a parting hug, Jack dissapeared into thin air.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Dean got home Sam's eyes fell on the flowers he was holding at once. "Do you have a date?" was the first thing he asked as Dean walked through the door. Dean scoffed. "No. I just thought this would be nice to add to ll the other crap." He answered. Sam lifted his eyebrows. "You got me flowers?" He asked, crossing his arms. Dean sighed. "Yeah, cause I'm an awesome big brother." He just shot back as he put the bouquet in a vase they had gotten as a house warming present once. He could feel Sam's eyes on him, looking for an explanation. He ignored him completely, and instead asked if Gabriel had told Sam when he'd arrive. The topic was enough to shut Sam up as Dean saw the nerves in him building again.
The others returned, carrying a large box on decorations each. Gabriel had decorated himself by wearing a garland around his neck and Jack was wearing a santa hat. They put the boxes to the side as Sam said there was more if they needed it.
When being in heaven and using his grace to keep it running took to much of a toll, Castiel told Jack and Bobby he needed to go back down. Bobby asked him to take a walk through the heaven they had created so far before he left. As soon as Jack was out of earshot, Bobby turned to him. "I just wanted to thank you, Cas. My boys were up against God himself, and if it weren't for you and the kid, it wasn't a battle they would have won. They'd both be in hell, and trust me, that ain't an easy ride."
"You haven't heard..."
"Do you have any questions about that, Jack?" Castiel asked in the calmest voice. Dean's blush only grew as he imagined Castiel talking about whatever they were to the kid.
Castiel returned to earth with a new found reassurance. He entered the bunker just as Dean came out of the bathroom in only a robe. Castiel couldn't help the flush, but Dean didn't seem bothered by how the angel had caught him. He had expected Dean to make some comment about it before the confession, let alone after he found out how the angel saw him.
"Don't sweat it. Just text me if Cas is on board to check it out tomorrow." With that, the other end when silent. Dean stared at his phone in disbelieve.
When Sam and Dean were on their way to the present room while Castiel and Gabriel were still working on how to place the presents, Dean could feel Sam wanted to talk. He sped up his walk, but Sam followed suit. "Dean."
Dean sighed, then rolled his eyes instead of answering. It did feel nice to know Sam had known all this time and didn't care. But he wasn't going to admit that.
After a long time Castiel nodded. "You're right, we should probably just do it all later." He agreed as he started to sort his papers one by one.
Dean lowered his weapon as the words started to take meaning. "So everything has restarted?" He asked, "Everyone that was dead, everyone we saved, everyone that... Everyone?" He asked, his eyes lowering slightly. "Nothing that happened was real."
"That's the good stuff, Cas." Dean encouraged as he opened the box. "How about we all hang them one by one? At home we all used to choose a favourite ornament and than hang it one by one, and we'd do it until the tree was full. Mom used to tell me, that way it belonged to everyone." Dean told them. He hadn't really given Chrismas a thought in so long that now it all came out at once. every little thing that made Christmas magical when he was young.
Dean's lips pulled upwards again. "I know. Good kid. Smart, like his father."
It was almost harder to ignore Sam’s prayer, because Sam hadn’t been the one that hurt him, but Sam understood why he couldn’t go to him either. He prayed to Cas to take his time. Castiel sighed as he listened to both the prayers, deciding he was going to be more.
He sighed, frustration ebbing away as the hurt took the overhand. He looked at the floor. "Well one of us is."
Castiel was so touched, not just by Dean's words, but by Dean's gesture. He knew how much Baby meant to Dean, and now he would always carry that with him.  "Dean," he took a deep breath, already feeling his voice wavering. "To stand here today, in front of all of these people to tell you how much I love you is a privilege I never expected to have. Love to me was a foreign concept to me for so long. It was something I never truly understood and never expected to feel anyway. Not until I met you, suddenly I cared about things and people. And then I realized I was in love. You made me see what a force love can be. And it was a force I couldn't fight, no matter how much I tried to fight it at the start. But there is no fighting the way I feel for you and even if there was I wouldn't want to fight it. If I start every morning by seeing your smile, I'll start every day happy. I love you Dean and I want to be with you always, in this life and the next. We've been through so much together, but I'm ready for so much more."
Sam chuckled. "Really Gabe?" He asked, shaking his head.
“Yes, after you volunteered him up to go to hell with someone who he described as Jack’s corpse… And I didn’t even stop it.” His voice got quieter when he realized how blind he had been.
"I, uh..." Dean shook his head in disbelief, trying to find the words to explain Brian's offer while still trying to wrap his brain around them. "Apparently Brian had a talk with management. They're letting up use the garage for the wedding."
"But I'm thinking... Sam has it good." He swallowed. It was hard to say it. He was grateful he could say it in prayer, tell Cas in his own pace. "I want that for us too. I know we'll never be normal. I mean, you can't just drop your wings. But sometimes I can see it, you know. A little house with a garden. You can even keep your bees there... We could just have something simple. Maybe we can look for something when you're back. Anyway just uh... I don't know... Come back soon, okay?"
Sam put a hand on his brothers shoulder, clasping it tightly. "I'm sure he'll show up eventually, I know he cared a lot about you."
With some scheming, Dean was able to actually bring out the winning offer on the house. He told himself that as soon as the house was fixed and livable, he'd stop with the scheming and fraud. Instead he'd get a job somewhere and start a normal life with Cas. Well, as normal as being with a cosmic entity could be.
Sam huffed out a laugh. "Thanks." He said, slapping Dean on his back, so the snowball would burst. Dean hollowed his back to get away from the cold. He shook his head at Sam, but could still laugh about it.
So I might add another update later today because I really want to get it finished before Christmas and I have to work a lot.
"You did the best you could. I know you had a lot to grief."
Dean helped Jack cut down the tree. He showed the kid how to tie it to the roof of the car securely. It was nice, teaching the kid something that didn't have to do with killing or being killed.
Maura made her way down the isle first, looking a little overwhelmed but still drinking in the attention as she threw white rose pebbles. Behind her, she was pulling her brother in the little wagon Dean made for him, so Bobby could be the ringbearer. Now it was their turn.
“Where are you going?” Dean asked as Sam tried to leave.
Dean laughed, too tired to catch on quickly. "What, are you going to propose?" He joked.
"Well one of us is."
The ease with which Dean pulled Castiel closer when something exciting happened on screen still made him feel like butterflies fluttered in his stomach, but the sudden movement no longer made him fear Dean was pulling away. It was a constant reminder that this was their new life and they were allowed to enjoy it, without having to fight tooth and nail to defend it. Even if Dean's taste in movies was a bit outside of Castiel's taste, he could stay here with him forever, listening to Dean as he explained how they did the special effects that made some woman's head blow up.
"Thank you." He muttered. He wanted to tell him he liked being watched over now, but decided that was clear. It had to be.
A look at Jody was enough to tell she had trouble keeping in tears as she spoke. "I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may kiss the groom."
Dean had been drinking so Cas was the one that had to drive home after Sam and Jessica’s wedding. The wedding itself had been beautiful. They got married in a little chapel almost hidden in the woods. Their first dance had been magical and afterwards they pulled Dean and Cas both from the crowds. Jessica pulled Dean on the floor, knowing how much he hated dancing, Sam pulled Cas out, knowing how badly he wanted to dance with the reluctant Dean. In the end Dean even smiled as they waltzed as well as they could, Cas leaning his head on Dean’s shoulder and Dean pulling him just a little closer as if to say the rest of the world didn’t matter at that moment it was only them and Dean would always take care of him.
"Nothing... I just didn't think the two of you were moving in here together..." There was no judgement in his voice, but Sam did seem to be surprised. Dean sighed softly. "Yeah, I uh..." He looked away, it was uncomfortable for him to talk about it. He had kind of hoped that after all this time, it would be almost like an understood thing. "Me and Cas... You know. It's always been different right." He pointed out, still avoiding Sam's eyes. He could feel his stare and knew that his little brother was probably looking at him like he was proud of Dean, just for saying that. He didn't need this to feel like a big deal. "So yeah, house, partner. That's the american dream, right? Or at least as close as I want to get to it."
Sam sighed as he gave their place a once over as well, and Dean couldn't help being a little offended at the way Sam looked. He really seemed to think that this place Dean worked hard to pay for wasn't something to be proud of. That was either a new feeling, or something Dean hadn't picked up on before this Christmas break, but Dean was willing to bet it was the first. He even understood in a way why Sam felt like that, but that didn't make it any less painful to see the way Sammy looked at their home.
The sheets were cold and the bed was too big without Cas there. The last time he slept alone had been years ago, back when Castiel still had to go up to heaven for several days at a time. Even though it was hard for Dean to fall asleep alone, he never blamed Cas for going up there. Right now however, he was blaming him for staying downstairs. He stared at the ceiling, wondering how long it was going to take until Cas gave in and joined him in their bed. As exhausted as Dean was, he couldn't fall asleep again. With no distractions, all he could do was think. He grabbed Castiel's pillow when he could no longer resist the temptation and curled up around it, trying to pretend his angel was next to him. Cas was always close to him, even now his being was captured Dean's ring. Dean rubbed the titanium band, needing to feel the comfort and warmth that usually brought him. It didn't come. Did Cas know he was holding back his grace, was he doing it on purpose? This was the first time touching the ring didn't evoke a feeling of warmth and safety. Or at least Dean thought it was.
He wanted to be angry, to tell his brother that if this place wasn't good enough, he should just go spend his Christmas without Dean, but he didn't. Partly to avoid a big dramatic fight in which he would have to admit to Sam why he cared that much about the way Sam saw his place, but also because he knew it wasn't Sam's fault that he felt like that. Not really. He was just nervous about everything that might go wrong or that might change his image. A crappy apartment might really down sell him, even if he himself still loved the place.
It felt almost like faith, when they passed a slightly disheveled house with a for sale sign in the yard, barely three streets from Sam's house. Al though Dean didn't really want to be ruled by fate, this seemed to nice to pass up on.
"Any time, old man," Claire grinned. "Are the two of you ready to go?" She fished her car keys out of her pockets to drive the three of them to the garage.
"Cas listen... When you...." A tear slipped down his cheek as the words he tried to get out stuck in his throat. "I just... I couldn't even after..." He swallowed hard, willing the other to understand.
Gabriel look at him, a glint of mischief in his eyes. "It's tradition, isn't it." He said, quirking his eyebrows.
love and grow old with them.  Castiel just hoped he would still be a part of Dean's life after that. It was better to suppress any feelings of hope or love down completely and deal with them alone. His brain would catch up eventually and move on as well. At least, that's what he hoped.
He called the new management of their previous venue assholes, his colleagues joked about cutting the brakes if any of them dared to bring their car to the shop. They told him it was a shitty situation to be in, slapped him on his shoulder and offered to help in any way they could. Of course there was no way for them to help, unless they happened to own a large event center, but the sentiment was nice. 30 minutes before the end of Dean's shift, Brian, the location manager, took the wrench Dean was working with out of his hand after he tightened the last bold on the engine he fixed up. "I'll take it from here, you go home. Give Cas our best will ya?"
Cas smiled softly as he looked at Dean through his lashes. Dean registered the blush on Castiel's cheeks as adorable, before realizing he was sporting quite the blush himself. Dean sat down, trying to look anywhere but at the man he wanted to look at. When he dared to bat his eyes Castiel's way, he found the other looking at him as wel. Then he quickly looked at Sam instead before something appeared to click. "So. you're the one that wanted a traditional Christmas?" he asked. Dean could see Cas smile again as Sam looked over to Gabriel. Castiel knew how much effort Sam had put into impressing Gabriel, because Dean had practically told him. "How did you like the flowers?" He asked Sam.
"That's not really how that w-" Dean stopped mid sentence when he seemed to piece it together. "Jack?"
Cas kept his promise and half an hour before Sam and Eileen were supposed to arrive, Dean smiled as he heard the flutter of wings behind him. He grinned when Cas put his hands over Dean's eyes, reminding him of the evening Dean showed Cas his own personal beehive. He grinned, even after all that time, every touch still gave him butterflies. "You got a surprise?" He asked excited.
"Gabe will be here around one probably. He got here today so he has to spend the evening with his family first." Sam explained, making Dean snort. "He's a grown ass man right? You make it sound like his mom told him to get home before he can go out to play."
There was something Dean didn't like about this guy and he had no idea what it was. He was a bit snobbish and obviously thought he was funny, but there was something else. On the other hand there was something likable about him to. He was far less posh and almighty than Dean had though he would be, based on Sam's urge to get it all perfect. In fact he didn't seem to look down on their place or on Dean at all. Granted that would be hard with his height, but still.
"If you say something like that when he is here..." Sam started but Dean just laughed. "Than he'll pay me to keep my mouth shut?" Dean filled in, getting even more on Sam's nerves. He could see Sam was about to start a fight so he lifted his hands in mocking innocence.
"I mean not that house in particular, but you know." Dean seemed to realize it was hard for Castiel to watch him leave, why else would he ask his opinion at all. Cas smiled, trying to look as supportive as possible as Dean continued. "It seems like an okay neighbourhood, and it's close to Sam and Eileen."
"Nothing apparently...."
"I like it a lot, Dean. I'm glad you showed me." He assured the other.
"I love you too." The words came easy and honestly. There would never be anyone else for him besides Cas and today they would celebrate that with all their friends. They lay there for a moment longer until Cas sighed contently. "We should probably get up. It's going to be a busy day." The spark in his eyes made Dean's heart beat fast.
As the other three started, Gabriel grinned at Sam. "So after we're done playing in the snow, how bout I warm you up?" He asked, his eyebrows wiggling. Sam chuckled. "Sounds good." He agreed. He wasn't sure what it was between him and the angel, but he did like the fact that Gabriel seemed to want to carry it on. "How about we get cold first." He grinned, gathering up some snow himself to start a man.
"I still have thirty minutes on the clock," Dean argued a bit unsure.
Castiel refreshed his email, hoping that the owner of the barn had replied since he last refreshed it five minutes ago. Nothing. He didn't even have a sliver of good news for when Dean finally got home. Hopefully that would be any minute now, but there was no telling any more. Dean no longer called ahead to let Castiel know that he was going to be late, since it was a daily occurrence by now. A glance at the clock showed it was two and a half hours past the end of Dean's shift. As he waited, Castiel looked over the list he made again, his heart breaking slightly at each crossed out name.
"I do." He smiled as he squeezed Dean's hand tightly, knowing they were second away from this being a reality.
"Yeah..." Sam said in his normal awkward voice, trying to act more casual than he clearly felt about the flowers. "When we were done we went to meet Gabe's brother and apparently he had this waiting..." Sam explained, probably having caught Dean looking at the roses. Gabriel smirked proudly. "Don't pretend like you don't like them..." He told Sam who rolled his eyes at him. "You know I like them." He told Gabriel before turning back to Dean to add some context. "His brother is a florist. His shop is really close by actually."
Dean looked up at him, scared and hurt. Castiel felt awful. He wasn't sure how to address it. "I haven't heard any prayers in months. From no one. With everything that happened in heaven some things got lost. Jack and I have been working to fix it, but it's not been a top priority."
Even now, when he couldn't let it be just an understood thing, Dean found it difficult to say the words. It was easier to just pray to Cas. In a way it was more intimate than talking. The way prayer meant sharing his every thought with the other. But he didn't have to look at him and didn't have to deal with possible reactions.
Castiel looked the house over. It was weird to think Dean wouldn't go home with him.  "I guess I'll be heading back to the bunker."
Of course Castiel knew what rings she was talking about. A soft smile painted his face as he thought about his answer. "Did mommy and daddy tell you what those rings mean?"
He was glad everyone seemed to just follow along with Dean's plans. No one complained as the brothers and Jack all put on a coat and Dean insisted that Jack had to wear his gloves and hat. Dean told him that he could deal with some cold fingers, but didn't bother giving an argument to why the nephilim wouldn't be way better at dealing with the cold. The whole reason Jack had no gloves of his own was because the cold didn't bother him, but Dean seemed set on treating Jack like a little kid for once is his life.
This meant that nothing had to change. He could have what he wanted, without losing what he had.
"He seemed to like it, thanks again."
Castiel nodded, he didn't need a thank you for saving his friends, but it was clear Bobby felt like he needed to say it so he let him continue.
Suddenly little circles appeared on the water, and when Castiel looked closer, he was able to see a pebble bouncing over the water, creating new circles across the lake. He turned around to see who threw the pebble when he realized there was a presence next to him.
"No." Dean shook his head instantly. "That's not how this whole thing works." His voice dropped to a hushed tone. Castiel could probably hear him just fine, but he still had the urge to lean in. "Listen, the kid is probably going to find out soon anyway, but I want him to have at least one normal Christmas. I had a few and it's... There's nothing like being a kid on Christmas morning."
Sam smiled. "Thank you, I'll see you there."
holding up, Cas?" The casual phrasing didn't fit the depth of Dean's voice. This was all Castiel wanted, to be acknowledged again. For Dean to see these past months were hard on him too.
"Oh I want to show you around." He said with a grin before he looked at Cas. "Let's give him the tour."
The following weeks were spend working on the house full time. Dean took the weeds out of the front yard and made a little pathway, he build a nice deck and refurbished some old chairs so they'd have a nice place to sit in front of their home. The garage was cleaned up and the driveway was repaved before Baby got her own spot. It was hard work and he was sweating and aching at the end of each day, but he was proud of what his efforts accomplaced.
Once Dean's pressure at work would die down a little and the new garage and dealership would open, maybe they could set some time apart and talk. Not just to plan the wedding, but to talk about what happened and how Dean's reaction made Cas feel. They were better at communicating than they had been at the start of their relationship, but it was easy to fall back into old habits when they were faced with all this stress. Dean turned into himself more when he was going through a hard time. That's why Castiel didn't take it personally that the other had stopped telling Castiel he loved him on a daily basis. He didn't need to hear it as long as he could feel it. But today, he couldn't even feel it. He had been feeling horrible ever since he had gotten that call. Although he had been nervous to tell Dean, he never imagined the other would make him feel worse.
Dean nodded. "Yeah, you go get them." He told Jack. He could tell the other was as excited about Christmas as Dean had always been. Not for the presents, although Jack was certainly interested in the prospect of getting them, but because of the family foccus. Because they were really celebrating as a family for once.
"Kinda hard to miss isn't it?" Dean pointed out. "Is your brother always like that?" Dean asked as he looked at the adorable way Cas kept blushing.
He was short. But like really short. Of course Sam had showed Dean a few pictures, but the way they were framed hadn't prepared him for this. A quick glance at Sam was enough to conclude that he pretty much understood Dean's train of thought, and didn't want him to comment on it. Dean instead held out his hand to the other, deciding that was the polite option. "You must be Gabriel." Dean stated, earning a smirk. "Probably."
A sly grin played on Gabriel's face. "Oh it was real, but yes almost everyone is back where they were in 2008. Jack helped me initiate the failsafe, adding a few modification, as far as was possible." He locked eyes with Dean, before yelling out. "Oh Cassie."
"Do you want to put this one in?" Cas asked, reaching out to offer it to Dean. Cars had always been more of Dean's thing, but that's what made Cas liked the ornament.
Back in the main hall, Jack and Dean were still working on the tree as Castiel twisted a long garlent around the rails of the stairs. When he was done he grabbed the box that said ornaments and moved it over to the two men. There were just a few plain Christmas balls in the tree now, but the box he brought had loads of beautiful unique little ornaments in them. The men of Letters must have really cared about Christmas, based on the sheer volume and care they put in decorating.
"That's not really how that w-" His words were caught off when he realized what Cas meant. "Jack?" Dean asked with a bright smile.
"It's probably Marjorie." Dean figured, unable to be too annoyed at her interrupting. The older woman that lived next to them often came by for some coffee during the day. Dean had a soft spot for her, and not just because she liked baking pie.
But now, he wasn’t sure he would be Dean’s much longer. He wanted to make everything alright, but the one time Dean had to rely on him he had let Dean down. Castiel pondered it, his only distraction being his pain and the ever present low hum of the florescent lighting.
"Yeah, you're really giving him free range here, aren't you?"
He could hear himself whisper. "Tell me to stop" as he leaned in closer.
Dean got up around noon that Saturday. He wanted to sleep in longer, but Sam had insisted he should at least be awake when Gabriel came by.  Once he was showered and dressed it was already half past twelve. The guy would be here in about half an hour and Sam was already full of nerves. Dean rolled his eyes, finding it a mixture of adorable and highly disturbing. After all, they had been dating for over half a year, what did Sam have to be nervous about... Then with a pang the realization sunk in, Dean. The tiny crappy apartment might add to his nerves, but Dean started to suspect that it had more to do with him than with that. Granted, when Dean had first seen Sammy's ex Jessica, he had been a pretty terrible brother. Flirting with her before even introducing himself, making some comments he wasn't to proud of and just being a dick in general. Still he had grown a lot since then, Sammy had to know that.
They showed Jack the whole house. Dean talked about how Cas had picked the colors and most of the furniture and Cas talked about how Dean had laid the floors and fixed the roofs. About half hour passed like nothing until the doorbell rang. "That's Sam and Eileen. Sam must be so excited to see you." Dean told Jack.
There was a thrill to grabbing more snow and knowing the others would take that time to attack. He laughed whenever someone got hit, whether him or anyone else. This wasn't like any real fight he had been in, there was no winner, no consequences, no blood.
"What was that about?" Castiel's voice brought him back to the present.
It was morning when the sunlight woke Dean up. He moved away to yawn and Castiel already missed having him close. The hunter didn't seem to mind the fact that Castiel had been looking over him. If anything, he seemed happy. "Sorry... I must have been more tired than I thought. You should have woken me up." Castiel couldn't help but notice the pink tint on Dean's cheeks as he looked into the hunters eyes. Dean looked right back at him, with a soft of unexpected warmth in his expression. "Did you just stay in one position all night?"
"I'll take it, Charlie." He assured the girl, who shrugged and walked towards the cart Castiel had been unloading. Dean didn't think about why Castiel insisted on helping, but appreciated the gesture non the less. He was thinking of a good way to casually tease the other about it, just to see how he'd react, but the florist cut him to it.
After they told Jack to go to bed when the movie ended, they prepared the presents underneath the tree, which they had hidden in one of the empty bed rooms. They had all gotten a large amount of presents, not just for Jack, but for each other as well. There was an air of tension everyone seemed to feel as they piled on the presents. Everyone except Gabriel, who was more than happy to have this be their family drama.
There was no way Castiel would ever take days liked these for granted. His arm was slung around Dean, who was either talking through the movie or eating popcorn, sometimes both. This was the third 'classic' horror movie of the day, and they had about twenty more to go in the next few weeks before Dean started his new job at the garage. Technically speaking, they were watching the movies for Castiel's benefit. Dean had been talking about something called 'Zombie bride 3'. When Castiel admitted he had never seen the movie, Dean swore it was a classic and insisted they needed to bring Castiel up to date. Truthfully speaking, Dean just needed an excuse to spend a whole day on the couch watching his favorite movies with Cas, and Castiel was more than happy to oblige.
They got into Baby, heading for the men of letters bunker. As Dean started the engine he looked at Cas, smiling. "I really thought I had lost you."
Still, they'd also prepare an apple pie and put it in the fridge without baking it. Then, just before they started Christmas dinner the next day, Mary would put the pie in the oven, so it could bake as they ate. That way, they always had freshly baked, hot pie as Christmas desert.
"I love you too Dean." Castiel intertwined their fingers and Dean could feel the power of the grace, of Castiel's being, course through him even more as the happiness of their shared life filled him. They stayed like that for some time, letting the emotions guide them. Eventually the fire died down to a smolder and Castiel got up to stomp it out. Dean's eyes were blurry with sleep and tears as Castiel stepped closer again and put an arm around his shoulders and another under his knees. Usually Dean would have protested to being picked up bridal style, but right now he couldn't worry about those traces of over-masculine pride he hadn't been able to get rid off. He clung to Castiel, pressing close to him as the other carried him to their bed.
"Of course." Sam assured him before heading out to look for the angel.
He looked at Cas, ignoring both their blushes as he kissed the others lips. They were even softer then he had imagined. When they broke apart he looked at Castiel with a soft, warm smile. "Merry Christmas, Cas."
After Dean put a bacon wrapped hotdog on his spike he wrapped his free arm around Castiel as well as the meat roasted over the fire. "What did you do today? Did heaven need you?"
"So, you're not moving in together..?" Bobby repeated, like it was a foreign concept. "I thought the two of you were... Well, something." Bobby said, looking at Jack for back up. The nephlim looked a bit unsure how to respond.
It was already half past four when they finished decorating. The bunker was now filled with garlands and Christmas lights, reefs and strategically placed mistletoes. Dean clapped his hands together. "Now all we need to do in build a snowman." He told them, and Sam started to wonder just how many Winchester Christmas traditions he had missed.
When he looked over again and his eyes met those of the other and Dean wondered if the man even recognized him. It was only a flash before he lost his gaze as his car took him past the shop and on his way to work.
Sam started laughing as the realisation set in. "Jack, did you think Cas and Dean have been dating all this time?"
Castiel could see the way Dean played with the fabric of his shirt. He seemed really proud of the garden and Castiel was touched that his opinion still seemed to matter to Dean. He nodded before exploring the garden some more as the hunter went inside.
Sam's smiled, hope returning to him. "So if Cas is back does that mean-"
Maura's eyes lit up. "And will you have a party, like the pictures mommy showed me?" Her excitement was making her talk louder again, but as soon as she looked at her baby brother, she covered her mouth to get quiet before she continued. "I was still small like Bobby, when mommy and daddy had the party so I don't remember. We need to take a lot of pictures, so Bobby remembers as well."
Dean encircled Cas's waist with one arm, the other finding its way to Cas's hair. When they broke apart he rested his foehead against Cas's. He couldn't see anything but those beautiful blue eyes.
"Oh sorry hello." He answered, a small blush painting his face. Dean held back a grin at how flustered the guy got for not noticing him before. "So, how did your brother like the angel?" He asked. Dean was somewhat surprised the other remembered him, but made sure not to show it.
"Stop worrying." Dean told him, trying not to take it personal. "It might be small here, but don't rich people just call that cozy..." He asked, rolling his eyes at the idea of someone calling their place cozy. Before Sam had time to think about that or form an answer, Dean handed him the angel he had bought. Sam didn't comment on its less then traditional look, but just thanked Dean.  Dean could see how important this all was for Sam. Maybe he should show Sam that he knew this was a big deal. A small smile krept on his face as he decided to go back to that shop the next day after work and get something to 'cozy' the place up more.
