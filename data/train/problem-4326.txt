The question was like ice water being poured over Dean's playful mood. Another reminder he would be returning home alone... “Nah,” he shook his head, giving a half shrug, “just give it to me. I'll drop them both off when I leave next week.”
“The Darkness is almost infinite power,” Cas answered, “I’m not sure what ‘growing up’ means in this case.”
“Eye of the beholder,” Dean answered for Sam, hoping it was enough to soothe Cas’ obviously ruffled feathers. Sam safely agreed with a soft “yeah” as he began typing and Dean sat down.
“Hey, snow days are awesome. Sleep in. Goof off by watching TV. Eat snacks till your stomach bursts. Awesome. What brought that memory?”
“Sure,” Dean replied with a shrug, giving him a small smile. He hoped he didn’t sound too eager about being able to touch Cas again. Cas dug through the end of his bag and pulled out the medicated cream, tossing it over. Dean caught it one handed and flicked open the cap, squeezing out a fair amount before tossing the bottle back.
Soon they were back on their way towards the turnpike. Just a couple more hours and they could finally stop for the night. Had Dean would have been agreeable, they could have flown to L.A. But, unfortunately, Dean had a deathly fear of flying, no way in hell he would have agreed to stepping one toe on a plane. Cas’ lower back already started protesting about the van’s shocks, which he only knew about because of Dean, trying to remember if their first trip left him feeling this uncomfortable, already planning on soaking in the tub later.
Inias and Cas both startle and Cas shrugs out of Dean’s grip to stare at the man, using his body to shield Inias in a reversal of their earlier stance.
Dean chuckles and shakes his head. “Impatient, Angel,” he mutters as his eyes track a young couple walking less than a hundred yards from them. “Uh, no one can see us, right?” Dean licks his lips nervously and his eyes widen when he catches sight of a woman walking with a toddler in a pink princess dress.
“Cas, come here!” Dean turns and reaches out a hand, beckoning Cas closer. “Get down here, you gotta see the way they swim, it’s amazing.” Dean’s grin is as bright as the sun and Cas is powerless to resist the warmth radiating from him.
Dean can’t move his arms more than an inch. Now that Cas has figured out the series of knots, he’s moving much quicker.
Cas nods and chews his lip, doing his best to not snap his hips forward at Dean’s urging. Finally, slowly, he bottoms out and grinds his hips against Dean’s ass, giving him a moment to adjust.
Cas huffs and shakes his head, letting Dean tug him back to his side. “It felt like it at the time.”
Cas’ breath catches as he pulls Dean around to face him. “You were expecting yelling?!” Cas tries not to yell himself.
Cas carefully wraps his arms around Dean’s back and breathes his scent in deeply. “Like pick up a hooker?” He tries to joke but he can tell by the way Dean’s arms tighten around him that it fell flat.
Cas was having a bad day and Dean had only wanted to help. Somehow, his heart didn’t get the memo and he sent Cas literally running away. Dean’s lost track of how many times he’s tried to call and text without even shred of success.
Cas bucks his hips, his dick already showing interest in Dean’s weight on top of him. “You sure you want to watch Dr. Sexy?” He asks and chews his lip while he stares into Dean’s darkening eyes.
Dean bumps their shoulders playfully, something he seems to be doing a lot, Cas has noticed, and reaches around him to throw away the ruined napkin. “Good thing you got extras,” he says, standing just a little too close as he licks another stripe up his cone. “My brother used to accuse me of being an overgrown toddler.”
“Dean,” Cas whimpers and shakes his head as he lets Dean back him against the wall. “How can you be okay with this?” Doubt is strong in Cas’s voice but he doesn’t flinch when Dean takes his hand.
“No, that, that’s my fault, for hurting you.” Cas shakes his head as he points to the liquid temptation and Dean bites his lip to disagree. “Fuck, Dean, I’m so sorry to push you to this.”
He can’t fathom why he resisted this for so long. Cas is perfect, his broad back is sculpted with muscle, strong and young. Powerful. Dean could lose himself, become drunk under the touch of Cas’ hands and barely notice the passage of time.
“I didn’t expect to introduce you to the family so soon,” Dean says softly and something in his voice makes Cas’s chest twinge.
“Cas, wake up!” Dean’s voice comes again and Cas feels himself being shaken. Suddenly he’s on his back and Cas struggles and whimpers against the hands holding him there. “Wake up!” Dean’s voice shouts, closer than before.
Dean’s ears ring as his cheeks redden as he tries to take a deep breath and calm himself. Cas left the room less than five minutes ago to move their laundry into the dryer and Balthazar immediately started in with questions that Dean does not want to answer. “I am not discussing our sex life,” Dean grates for the third time but Balthazar remains undeterred.
Cas wants this. Cas has dreamed of this and he trusts Dean enough to surrender everything to him. The power Cas is giving him is heady and the sight of those pink lips closing around the ball gag sends shockwaves straight to Dean’s cock.
“If you’re serious about taking up yoga, I know someone who runs a class. I can give her a call for you.” Dean’s green eyes pop into his field of vision, blocking his spectacular view of the ceiling fan whirling above.
His uncle’s sword falls to the ground as the man wraps his hands around Dean’s blade, trying to push himself off the deadly weapon.
“Good.” Meg nods, still cradling his cheek. “You callin it a night, then?” She asks as she turns his chin this way and that, examining his bruised and broken skin.
Mills arches a brow, unimpressed with his answer and Missy elbows him in the ribs. “Earlier, you both said you stopped by the coffee shop on your way to work and then noticed something wrong on your way home. Now you don’t have a job? Which is it?”
“Oh Dean” Tears well in Castiel’s eyes as he feels something crack inside of his lover. “You are more precious to me than my own life. I need you to understand that” Cas drapes himself over Dean once more, pressing warm kisses to each knob of his spine as he works his way to Dean’s shoulders. Dean sighs into the feather-light touches, letting himself enjoy the moment instead of reminding himself of the past.
Benny shrugs as he reverently brushes his fingertips over the riches gathered in the center of the space. He snaps his fingers at the warriors behind him to call them to attention from their distracted glances about the room.
Dean huffs a laugh and his grin returns full force. “Me too. Sam thought I was crazy, didn’t think you’d be ready to commit to my crazy life this soon.”
Cas takes his time touching and kissing every inch of Dean’s skin from his brow to the insides of his ankles. Words are inadequate to describe the feeling of complete adoration pulsing through his veins and spilling out over his tongue in the form of whispered endearments against warm skin that have Dean letting out the softest gasps and moans. Cas relishes having Dean like this, soft and pliant beneath him as he explores.
Dean’s shirt ends up rucked around his armpits but he doesn’t want to pull away from Cas long enough to tug the garment over his head.
“Your end is near though,” Lilith mutters lowly as she lowers her head to the stump Benny had prepared. She tilts her chin to the side and looks up at Dean with a chilling smirk as he lifts his ax high.
He leans his head toward Cas, his lips ghosting over the shell of Cas ear. “I love you so much,” he whispers, heart absolutely aching with the emotion behind his words. “So brave, so strong, so beautiful,” he continues even as Cas tenses and shakes his head.
White-hot anger sparks to life in Cas’ chest and his vision begins to darken around the edges as his pulse pounds in his ears. “No!” He growls as he surges forward to wrench the offending food, if you can even call it that, from Dean’s hands and heaves it overboard. He turns back to glare at Dean, breaths labored and meets Dean’s surprised expression with a sense of satisfaction.
Dean nods again, chin seemingly on a swivel when he thinks. Suddenly, his up and down motion ceases and he shakes his head. “I don’t want to hide you a minute longer. Would you mind if I called him real quick? I want to at least tell him before we get caught kissing in public.” Dean winks with a playful smirk.
The oven timer interrupts them when Dean starts talking about being harassed by Bernardo and Balthazar leaps to his feet to check on the lasagna while Dean continues his tale.
His mood slowly swirls down the drain along with the soap being coldly rinsed from his body, washing away the touch of strangers and leaving behind a hollow ache in his chest. Tonight wasn’t any worse than normal. In some ways, it was better, but that doesn’t explain the despair threatening to swallow him whole. He shakes his head and smacks the wet wall of the shower with a strangled cry of frustration before viciously turning the water off and ripping his towel off the bar.
“This is my reality, Dean. I’m sorry I lied to you, but…” Cas steps forward, full of righteous fury but Dean stops him with a gentle hand to the center of his chest.
Dean’s eyes water as he drives on, the pleasure concentrated in his balls near ready to explode. He needs Cas to tell him. He needs to hear…
Cas blazes a trail of hot kisses over Dean’s jaw and down the column of his throat while Dean rucks up Cas’ shirt, splaying his fingers over the man’s hips to hold him in place. “Dean,” Cas gasps as he grinds down. “Please tell me you want this.”
Cas lingers for as long as he dares. He told Dean he would return, and he has no desire for Dean to come looking for him. Besides, he needs to empty the bathwater.
“The vic is being taken to Central, he’s in critical condition but the medics got his bleeding under control.” Another officer stops at Mill’s side and delivers the report that nearly sends Cas crashing to his knees. “You got their statement?”
to do what I can while I still have the strength.” Meg fixes him with her most pleading look, her eyes wide and lips pursed.
No answer from the Angel. Dean hopes that means Cas is elsewhere in the bunker. Researching or something. Hell, even watching porn. Just, please Chuck don’t let him be trying to cook.
He would need an entire bottle of tranquilizers to survive the flight, but he would do whatever it took.
“You clearly did not think. For your false accusations, you may complete Castiel’s duties as well as your own for today,” Dean bites and Cas nearly balks at the sound of his full name. He releases her with a shove and holds up the gleaming knife. “You have my thanks for this lovely little dagger,” Dean says with a smirk before tucking the blade back into his belt as Lilith’s expression darkens.
Dean chuckles. “You are such a wimp.” His hands continue to smooth the aloe across the planes of Castiel’s back. “And I’m gonna ring Benny’s neck for letting this happen.”
A loud crack sounds below them and Cas jolts away in surprise, once again certain that this is a dream and he’s about to be ripped from it.
“I’ll go get them.” Cas volunteers and holds his hand out for the keys as Dean unlocks the apartment.
Missy waving from the window of the coffee shop gives him pause and he smiles reflexively when he sees her bright smile and plastic cup being waved in his direction.
Crowley nods before shaking his head. “You’re smitten, Squirrel,” he says, voice dry and acerbic but his soft smile is pleased. “So, Cas. Tell me a bit about yourself.”
Cas nods and meets Andrew’s eyes briefly. “My degree sounds terribly pretentious, but simply put, I’m studying the development and philosophy of the Latin language.”
Cas nudges Dean’s shoulders, encouraging him to sit forward before standing and offering his hand. They follow James without a word, hands linked together. Cas’ palm burns against Dean’s as they’re guided from the demonstration room, past an ‘employees only’ sign and into a long hallway that is better lit than the rest of the club. Dean studies the deep gray walls, noting how plain yet welcoming the space still is as they’re brought to a series of closed doors.
He nods and swallows hard. “I do, actually.” His stomach does a happy little swoop when his thoughts turn to Dean. “You remember that guy from a few weeks ago?”
“Never” Cas deadpans, eyes darkened with lust as he reaches for Dean again. He whimpers and pouts when Dean bats his hands away and steps farther back.
“Good,” Dean whispers before drawing Cas into a tender kiss that extends to the tips of his toes. Cas’ eyes slide closed and he might whimper, but he’ll never admit to it, as Dean’s lips move against his.
They discuss the case for a bit, but there is no possible way they can turn the scant information they have into a three-hour conversation. So, Dean heaves a deep breath and settles in for the long haul. Classic rock blaring from the speakers discourages further conversation and the way Cas is staring out the side window gives Dean the impression that his thoughts are equally as sour.
Dean hums, thinking the words to Castiel in a prayer and Cas squeezes him tighter before taking a step back and slipping free. The Angel runs fingertips down Dean’s spine, mojoing the mess from Dean’s ass before it can begin leaking out. Dean shivers in the cold as he murmurs words of thanks, gooseflesh popping out on his arms now that the light sheen of sweat covering his body begins to evaporate.
“You’re making demands?” Cas arches a brow and folds his arms over his chest, fixing Dean with a glare that makes him shiver.
Only when he’s gone does Cas loosen his grip and allow Dean to pull away to find his jeans. “How are your arms?” Cas asks as he follows Dean to his feet. He catches Dean’s wrist, encouraging him to turn and meet his eyes.
“Boy, I’ve been watching your Daddy teach you to play since you could barely reach the table. Never thought I’d see the day someone’d whip a Winchester.” Ellen bumps Cas’ shoulder and smiles wide. “How about I get you boys a pitcher, on the house,” She says before bustling away, oblivious to the way Cas’ smile falters and he glances toward the floor.
Dean continues moving closer, bypassing Cas’ mouth to whisper in his ear. “You’re pretty handsome yourself, Professor.”
He pushes his ass up to help, and Cas wastes no time tossing his jeans and underwear to the floor before resuming his position over Dean’s lap. His cock bobs heavily, eager to be touched and when Cas shifts and shimmies into place, he nearly loses the resolve to let Cas take what he wants from him.
Dean’s brow furrows but he allows Cas to hold his hands firmly as he searches Cas’ expression for honesty. “You are afraid. Of me?” Dean’s tone is pained and guilt threatens to consume Castiel for being the cause.
“Shit! Charlie’s gonna kill me.” He presses another quick kiss to Cas’ lips and hurries toward the bedroom.
“Oh god, please. Don’t” Sam looks as if he bit into a lemon and Dean laughs over the rim of his coffee mug.
Dean scratches the back of his neck, his most obvious tell for when he’s uncomfortable and Cas chews his lip as he waits for Dean to put his thoughts together. He knows better than to try to rush Dean when he’s wearing that pinched frown of nervousness.
Cas drops his head back to rest along the edge of the old barrel and groans even as his muscles begin to relax under the nearly too hot water.
“You like espresso, Castiel?” John asks as he sets a towering platter of pancakes at the center of the already crowded table.
He looks up to meet Dean’s gaze and his breath catches in his throat when he notices Dean’s tender smile. “Thank you, Dean,” Cas mutters softly as he steps back, his heart still fluttering from the feeling of Dean's hesitant touch.
Dean looks between Cas’s rosy cheeks and Meg’s predatory grin with the beginnings of a smirk before he shakes his head. “No, thanks.” He flashes Cas a grin that can mean absolutely nothing good before opening his mouth again. “But I would
The server gives him a warm smile and nods before walking away while Dean lets out a shaky breath. The drink on the table in front of him is neon orange and the bowl of potato chips is all too inviting. Cas takes a sip of his orange concoction and hums in satisfaction so Dean decides to try his as well.
Cas resumes stroking Dean’s hair with a thoughtful hum. “So what were you thinking for later? Dinner with Sam?”
Those final dreams have been banished from his mind since the moment Dean turned around to face him in Herculaneum and it seems fitting to be reminded of them now.
Dean gives one more scoot and swallows hard, real fear of falling off the table starting to crawl up into his chest. “Perfect” Cas’ deep voice rumbles and Dean relaxes slightly. “Now, I need to examine your prostate. Relax for a moment while I get everything ready” He pats Dean’s knee once more before turning away.
He just didn’t expect it to happen to him, especially after such a simple scene. Or so quickly. He thought these things took time to develop.
“Asmodeus promised our freedom. I thought, Metatron convinced me that was the only way,” Gadreel says and Castiel’s blood runs cold.
Dean has somehow procured a blanket and is swinging it wildly as the creature flies in circles above his head. Round and round the room it goes in a never-ending loop, too high for Dean to swat from the air no matter how hard he tries.
Cas lets out a heavy sigh and nods. As much as his brother tortured him, he could always count on Gabriel to come through. He even tried to defend him to their father after their final confrontation, an action that got Gabriel banned from the family for over a year.
Dean shrugs. “Well, yeah. If I can’t trust the man I love with keys to my house, who can I trust?” Dean’s cheeks flush redder with each word but his gaze is earnest enough to have an entire circus doing somersaults in Cas’ stomach.
Sam lets out a strangled sound and holds his hands up to mock strangle his brother. “You are such a dumbass.” Sam turns on his heel and stomps away, entirely done with this conversation and Dean is glad to see him go.
for me,” his voice falters and he scrubs at his eyes. “I’m so sorry I left, Dean. I was too afraid to call, too afraid of disappointing you.” He sniffles and Dean finally looks up to meet Sam’s watering eyes. “I’m so sorry.”
“Come on, let me make you a drink, on the house,” she pulls back with a gentle smile. “Tell me about him while you wait.”
“Dean, are you okay?” Cas asks. He cannot ignore Dean’s unease any longer. Something is bothering him.
And yet the monk had apologized to Dean in a gravel rough voice that sent a shiver down Dean’s spine. The language he spoke was one Dean barely recognized. He hadn’t heard much of the Saxon language since he was a young boy and those memories have been buried so long that Dean has nearly forgotten.
“Oh, Dean,” Cas whimpers, rolling forward to catch Dean in a bruising kiss. Their mouths work together smoothly, tongues brushing ever so slightly as Cas presses him into the plush mattress. “You have no idea how happy that makes me, how…” Cas pulls back just enough to speak before diving in again. “You are incredible, Dean Winchester.”
“Not my boyfriend,” Cas grumbles weakly as he washes out his mug and sets the chipped ceramic on the drying rack. He doesn’t miss Meg’s dramatic eyeroll as she flops onto the couch without clearing her plate and turns on the boxy TV that sits on the floor. They only get the free local channels, but he’s always been a sucker for PBS anyway.
Dean’s smile turns predatory and he steps into Cas’ space. “Good. Because I want you, right here. Right now.”
“Hey, it’s alright. Would you like a photo?” Dean asks easily. “Benny, would you?” He asks when the woman nods as she chews her lip.
“Dean, I…” Castiel begins to protest weakly, knowing well enough by now that resistance is futile. He doesn't have the will to fight Dean anymore.
One ring after another, Dean waits with bated breath and Castiel shifts in his seat, wringing his hands and shaking them out over and over again.
“Sorry, I just,” Dean says as he skillfully backs out of the driveway to pull out behind his Dad’s truck. “I think my Dad is more just stunned stupid by all this. I told them I was gay last Christmas, but I’ve never dated. Never brought anyone home so I think he was just able to ignore it. Then to see us like that on the front lawn and find out you’re the one I’ve been dreaming about my whole life...” Dean shakes his head as he trails off.
“Sir?” The host questions after a handful of thundering heartbeats and Cas turns to the man with saucer-like eyes. “Is this table alright? Perhaps you would prefer a booth?”
“I have heard that the Jarl’s rule is contested. That your Dean and his brother may be in danger from their uncle. I have also heard they may be the lost princes of Wessex?” Ephraim’s tone changes then and Cas swears he almost sounds wistful.
“Balthazar!” Dean barks as he scans the beach for the monk. Balthazar was the first of the Christians to abandon his robes in favor of the Viking way of dress. He’s even been letting his hair grow out.
Dean’s arms grips Cas’ hips and Cas’ strong legs hold onto Dean tightly as he draws back sharply before slamming forward, pulling Cas’ to meet him. The smooth drag of his erection against Castiel’s inner walls at this angle is like nothing Dean has ever felt. His muscles strain and bulge to hold the weakened Angel’s weight but the look of pure bliss on Castiel’s face is worth every bit of the discomfort.
He clenches his jaw and does his best to ignore Dean, but he nudges Cas with his foot and calls his name incessantly.  Castiel’s patience stretches thinner than parchment at Dean’s continued demands for him to eat.
“What….” Cas begins, glancing worriedly at the open computer screen. “What is ‘Kinktober’?” he rumbles, using his fingers to create air quotes around the strange sounding word.
He settles on his knees between Cas’ spread thighs and runs his hands over Cas’ hips and down his legs as he looks up to meet that perfectly blue gaze.
” She shovels another spoonful of off-brand cheerios into her mouth. “Besides, it’s not like we can’t afford a decent cup of coffee for you now and then.”
Dean swallows hard and Cas can feel him shiver slightly. “I….please. Cas. Please” His voice shudders and he leans harder into Cas.
Finally, he gets the photo app sorted and takes a half dozen pictures while Dean and the barista grin at each other.
“Alright. Let's go” Dean turns abruptly towards the door and snags Castiel by the wrist on his way out.
“Fine,” Dean says, tone flat. “I must oversee the camp, anyway.” He gives Sam a dismissive wave and pushes to his feet. He takes another moment to stare down at where Cas still kneels in the grass and Cas cannot bear to look up at the man.
“Sonofabitch.” Dean shakes his head as he prods at the bottom of the screen. “There’s a hole in it!”
The way Dean’s jeans hug his ass has Cas biting at his lip and he takes a hurried step forward so he can plaster himself to Dean’s back and grind his hardening dick against that perfect swell.
Dean’s pulse quickens and throat shifts as he swallows and gives Cas a jerky nod. Hell yes. “Maybe,” he starts before taking a deep breath, “maybe we should take this to the backseat.”
“Gabe, I’m sorry, but I just wanted Dean to myself for a while longer.” Cas waves to Garth as Dean takes the oversized cup of coffee from the man and the fifth of Basil Hayden's Bourbon.
Cas finds the textbook he wants and shuffles back to Sam before launching into a drawn-out explanation of the nuanced differences between the different stages of the Latin language and Sam hangs on his every word.
He swallows hard and squeezes his eyes closed as he drums his fingers on the counter. He hates how weak he is, how these random cravings seem intent on punishing him for his hard-fought sobriety.
Cas lets out a heavy sigh and shakes his head fondly. “Brat,” He says but his tone lacks any heat. “I was planning on keeping everything simple the first time we play with this. I’m not going to ask anything of you that we haven’t done outside this…arrangement, and in turn I expect you to obey me without question or protest.”
Mary cocks her head. “If you like honey, I have a friend who keeps bees. I’m sure Cain would love to show you around his apiary.”
“Witches” Dean states, grudgingly forcing himself to draw the computer closer to look at whatever Sam is trying to show him. Four people dead, three more missing in a tiny little burg no one has ever heard of. The only reason the story has made the news is that, before the last week, the town has had exactly one murder in its two-hundred-year history. The victims were all staff members at the local hospital but from different departments. “What makes you think there's a witch? Looks more like a deranged patient” He shoves the computer back, knowing Sam has more to go on than just this. His little brother is anything but sloppy.
He reaches behind himself to grab a throw pillow and shoves it over his lap before leaning forward to grab his computer.
The kicks continue to come and Castiel grunts with each one, his face now soaked with tears. He clenches his eyes shut tightly and prays to God for deliverance from this torture. He cannot survive like this.
“What, Dean?” Cas answers and swallows hard around the knot in his throat that keeps him from humming at Dean’s tender touch.
Dean blinks again, looking to Cas for approval like he knows a sub should. Not that Cas would mind if he answered for himself, but his lips don’t quite want to form words yet and this man seems harmless enough.
Castiel has come to believe that Dean earnestly wishes for his happiness, but short of freeing him and allowing Cas to return home, Dean has done everything in his power to ensure Castiel’s contentment.
Cas slides out slowly, gasping and groaning at the nearly too much pressure squeezing his dick as he moves inside his lover. He snaps his hips quickly, burying himself to the hilt and drawing a gasp from Dean as the air is punched from his lungs.
There are too many strangers in the crowd, too many unfamiliar faces in a place Dean has called home since he was a small boy.
“Please, Cas. Please” Dean whimpers, pushing back onto Castiel’s probing tongue. He loves this, he really does. The first time, he had a moment of panic because there was a mouth all over his ass and that was just gross! But the pure pleasure sparking low in his gut that had him trembling all over was too good to deny.
Cas nods before he can stop himself. Something about Dean makes Castiel want to try, want to hope for something better.
should have left well enough alone. He should have left you and your whelp of a brother to the Britons. You are too weak to be one of us.” Asmodeus says, his tone somehow light and chiding as if Dean were a simpleton.
Dean won’t hurt him. Dean will never hurt him. Cas pulls back with a gasp. “Dean.” His chest heaves and his mouth hangs open as he takes in Dean’s blown pupils and strained breathing.
Meanwhile, Dean nearly chokes on his Margherita, earning a knowing smirk from Gabriel that immediately has the devious little shit that lives deep inside Castiel perking up to say attention.
His heart flutters as his mouth starts to open but he licks his lips and swallows hard around the syllables forming on his tongue. The little spike of adrenaline rushes through his veins and forces him to clench his eyes to find his bravery.
Cas does his best not to squirm and whimper. Dean’s words strike hot and heavy, sending his arousal into dangerous levels. He hasn’t wanted like this in years. The promise that Dean is laying before him is tantalizing in every way and he needs something more than Dean’s hand.
Cas places wet kisses along the back of Dean’s neck and down between his shoulders, slowly beginning to withdraw and press back in. He tries his hardest to reign in his moans at the delicious pressure surrounding his cock as he moves inside Dean. All of heaven pales in comparison to this carnal pleasure. Not for the first time, he gives thanks to his father for allowing him this level of exquisite hedonism.
Cas lands a solid smack, holding his hand over the heating skin to seal in the sting as Dean grits out the first count. The blows continue to fall and Dean continues to count. Dean melts into each strike, groaning as his cock hangs heavy between his legs.
“Noted. So, why choose to study religion? I would think your childhood would have left a bitter taste in your mouth?” Dean asks, his expression far too earnest for where Cas’ mind immediately goes.
Cas doesn’t bother fighting his lingering smile. “Yes, Ms. Masters. I thought you would be headed home by now?” He asks with an arched brow.
“Dean?” Cas says softly and Dean flinches when he feels the man brush his fingers along the back of his shoulder.
“You say that now…” He trails off when Gabriel’s eyes dart up from his menu to meet his and Cas sucks in a deep breath. “So, Gabriel. What brought you to Texas again?”
“We talked about this...” Cas whispers in Dean’s ear, low enough that the microphone held off to the side can’t pick up his voice. He eyes the crowd nervously and plasters on his best smile before giving a little wave.
Dean snorts licks his lips. “You called her ‘miss’. That’s what you call women younger than you.” Dean can’t help but explain. For all that Cas has learned, sometimes he’s still a little clueless, a fact that Dean will never stop finding endearing.
Cas remembers drifting off not long after muttering something about looking forward to meeting Sam, and Dean had responded with a kiss to his brow and a whispered
“Don’t laugh at me,” Cas says, knowing Dean won’t understand his words. The furrow of a frown that dents Dean’s brow has Cas letting out the faintest huff of laughter as he holds his hand out for Dean to take.
Dean lifts his head and rolls his eyes. “So you keep reminding me.” His heart warms with Bobby’s concern and unique brand of tough love but he doesn’t let that affect the way scowls back at the older man.
The agreeable phrase nearly causes Cas physical pain to mutter, but he promised to be cooperative and admitting his needs is the first step.
Cas huffs a laugh as he waves toward the glass. “I think it’s sweet.” He takes Dean’s hands back and resumes their dance to a song that he’s starting to recognize, an older love song that is every bit as cheesy as it is sweet. He starts to hum along with the chorus, when the band starts to sing about
Cas laughs as he catches the pillow and throws it back, catching Dean in the shoulder. The two men stand grinning at one another before Cas finally shakes his head fondly. “I’ll see you downstairs,” He says as he moves toward the door.
Dean snorts a laugh and rolls his eyes. “I don’t think we should ever have pets. They might turn on us.” He hums when Cas’ fingers find a particularly good spot on his scalp and his eyes drift closed with a sigh.
“Uh-huh.” Gabriel lets out a heavy breath. “So, San Francisco.” A heavy pause follows and Cas nods, forgetting for a moment that his brother can’t see him through the phone. “I’m coming to see you.”
Dean notices his hesitation almost immediately and whimpers with regret as he tries to pull back, but Cas holds on tightly, keeping Dean close.
Several deep breaths later, he wanders into the bedroom to find some clean clothes and ends up shrugging into an emerald green button-down that he knows brings out his eyes and his best pair of jeans.
Just then, Cas’ office door flies open and Balthazar storms in with a newspaper clutched tightly in his hands. “Cassie! When were you going to tell me about this?!” He slams the paper down in front of Cas and Charlie squawks on the other end of the line.
“It’s not fancy espresso, but it’s strong,” Dean says as he brings his coffee to his lips with a satisfied hum.
“Still,” Dean mutters before pressing a line of chaste kisses along the column of Castiel’s throat. “Just come sit with me?”
Dean kisses him deeply and Cas melts with a pleased hum as Dean takes what he wants and plunders Cas’ mouth until he nearly forgets how to breathe. “There. That’s better.” Dean pushes Cas away gently and turns away as if he hasn’t just kissed Cas senseless.
he thinks. “But, I want to belong to you. I do belong to you” Dean blushes as he barely manages to spit out the words and Cas swallows hard.
“OUT!” Castiel doesn’t have the patience for Benny’s begging. It’s beneath them both and frankly, it's unbecoming.
“Wanna get lunch on the way back?” Dean asks as he slides in behind the wheel and Cas shakes his head.
Dean’s mind so helpfully supplies. He vaguely remembers Sam griping about something to do with driving and whatnot a couple of days ago, but that is the extent of it.
“Oh my god! Is this what I’m going to have to deal with now? I take it back. I take every nice thing I’ve ever said back,” Sam says with a wrinkled nose and narrowed eyes.
“Still your mind, brother.” A heavy hand settles on Dean’s shoulder and the man turns his head to take in his best friend’s gentle blue eyes.
“Sit,” Cas urges him down and Dean sees no reason to resist. The pain in his shoulder is steadily building into an all-consuming, nauseating, agony that has him clenching his eyes but he isn’t ready to return to bed yet. Not with the sun slowly dropping over the horizon and Cas pressed against his side.
“You know I don’t understand,” Cas says flatly. Truthfully, he understands more than he’ll admit. Dean thinks he doesn’t deserve him?
Next to him, Lee takes his position with a wide grin and the rest of the band settles into their spots.
Dean keens as Castiel picks up speed, striking his prostate over and over with perfect aim. He trembles, his grip on the cool metal of the Impala and Castiel’s strong arms are the only thing keeping his knees from giving out. “Come for me, Dean” Castiel growls low in Dean’s ear, thrusting sharply. “Come on, my good boy. Come” Castiel’s punctuates his words with sharp tugs on Dean’s cock, twisting his wrist just the way Dean likes, and Dean does. Dean comes with a sob, cock twitching and painting the shiny black metal of Baby’s door with streaks of white.
Cas rolls his eyes and continues to sip as Dean settles onto the bed next to him and snuggles into his side. “So, what’s the plan?” Cas finally asks when the coffee is nearly drained.
Finally, Dean lays twitching on the floor and gives in to his own laughter as stares up at Cas with warmth reflected in his green eyes. “I’m glad that my pain is amusing to you.”
Cas opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out. “We don’t have to do that. Not everyone does, the woman on the phone said that many of their members don’t…”
Cas rips his wrist out of Michael’s hold. “How can you say that? After father disowned me, after everything you’ve said just now? How dare you say that you miss me when you haven’t spared me a thought in ten years!” He nearly growls, anger flashing in his gaze.
Dean smiles gently. “Tell me if you want to stop,” He says as he nudges Cas’ knees apart so he can settle in the space between. Dean prays to the gods that Cas doesn’t ask him to stop. He wants nothing more than to feel the weight of Cas on his tongue and have his taste on his lips.
Gabe studies his expression, searching his resolve and he gives a firm nod when he finds what he’s looking for. “Good. We’ve got work to do.”
Dean squirms with excitement when a roll is brought out on fire, the blue flames licking up over the protective dish.
Dean leads them inside without another word and Cas is careful to strike a balance between submissive and willful as Dean pulls him through the long hall toward an area Cas has yet to see.
Dean prays, knowing how Castiel loves when Dean lowers his barriers enough to speak to Castiel from the depths of his soul.
“Stop it.” Balthazar puts a hand on his shoulder to stop him from reaching for his phone. “Whatever is going on in that pretty little head of yours, stop it.”
Dean huffs and shakes his head. “I know, but I’ve been wanting to try Tapas for years. Don’t got anything like that in Kansas.”
By the time the sub on stage is hoisted above the ground, face down but angled upward with arms extended behind him. One leg above the other, bent ninety degrees and the sole of his opposite foot pressed against his thigh. He looks graceful, poised and beautiful like a dancer and Dean’s stomach clenches as he looks on. This as much art as it is erotic.
Dean hears rustling in the background as Sam straightens and Dean can almost see his ears perking up with interest. “I’m good, just about to head into work.”
“Its Bobby. I was supposed to be downstairs an hour ago,” Dean hurries to explain as he pulls a grease-stained t-shirt over his head.
Dean groans at the short punching thrusts, noting with thankfulness that Cas is avoiding his prostate. “Yes” He hisses, desire for exactly that sparking low in his gut.
“Then who are you going…? Oh, you’re just being an ass. Got it.” Sam chuckles humorlessly. “Seriously, man, you okay?”
For at least the dozenth time since they first exchanged those marvelous three little words, the website bookmarked on his computer makes his fingers itch. He finds it far too easy to imagine a thin circle of silver wrapped around Dean’s finger as he frets the strings of his guitar and the thought fills Castiel with undeniable warmth.
Dean shuffles toward the door warily, already dreading what might be waiting for him on the other side.
Their eyes lock for what feels like an eternity as Cas forces himself to consider. Dean’s chest heaves and his cock twitches in Castiel’s hand with each beat of his head, hurrying his thoughts and dampening his caution.
Dean takes a deep breath and forces himself to nod. “If she wishes to leave with you, I will not try to stop you.”
Cas smiles at their exchange even as he feels a pang of jealousy deep in his stomach. Dean is so lucky to have a family who looks out for him. Who loves him unconditionally and without question.
Dean feels his cheeks flush as the abstract idea in his head becomes real. Cas was serious. Cas is serious. There is a club within reach and they could… is he ready for that? To let Cas fuck him where anyone else could see?
Ten minutes later, Cas is staring at himself in the mirror and he has to admit, he looks good. Still like himself, but less formal. More relaxed and open.
Dean swallows thickly, clenching around the plug nestled in his ass as if he needs the reminder of its presence. He had nearly swallowed his tongue when Sam had shown up. In all his half-assed planning he had not even considered the possibility of having to face Sam while wearing a plug in his ass. Now that he has though, the thought terrifies him. What if Sam had noticed something was different?
“The man who harmed you will die,” Dean says and rests a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. Cas flinches away from the contact but doesn’t try to run. Dean gestures across the fire where Alastair is kneeling in the dirt with his hands bound behind him. He struggles against the ropes, but he has no real chance of escape. “Sam, tell him. Tell him his pain will be avenged.”
Morning dawns and another full day and night pass as Castiel slowly feels more apathetic about his position. He’s convinced that as long as they’re on the boats, the Vikings will not harm him or his brothers.
He closes his eyes tightly and counts to five, trying to calm his racing heart and convince himself that there is nothing wrong with the truth, but he should apologize for his tone.
Meg presses her hand to her sternum, helping her breathe as she shakes her head with a grimace. “No, I’m fine, I just need a minute,” Meg protests, already pushing him away.
Meg sucks in a shaky breath and lets out a small cough as she nods. “Has he told you about Gabriel?”
Cas rolls his eyes and Dean pretends not to notice. Of course, Cas will be fine. The restraint of the tie is nothing but a symbol. A simple length of silk wouldn’t be able to restrain him if he wanted to escape.
This isn't the time for words, not when Dean's heart still skips and his stomach clenches if his thoughts drift back to seeing Marv pull that gun.
Samandriel’s lips press into a flat line but his moves in a faint nod of agreement. “I trust your judgment, Castiel. You know I do.”
Cas hurries to her side without thinking and wraps his arm around her back to guide her to their lumpy couch. “You’re staying home tonight.” Cas decides for her as he helps her down.
“Castiel. As in Cas, Castiel? Your Castiel?” Sam asks as he pinches a frown and Dean’s heart sinks. He knows that look.
Bobby rolls his eyes. “So it’s boy drama. Come on, Princess, I ain’t payin you to mope,” he says, but underneath his gruffness is a layer of gentle understanding that Dean recognizes from years of learning how to decode his uncle’s words.
Cas goes reluctantly but melts when Dean wraps a strong arm around his stomach to draw Cas’ back tight against his chest and Dean nuzzles his nose in the crook Cas’ neck with a pleased sigh.
He doesn’t need Gabriel’s influence in the mix or else good ole Hugh might actually rise from the grave to attend.
Dean stares, wide-eyed as his fingers close around the delicate blooms. “Chamomile?” He questions, heart racing as he swallows hard and meets Cas’ gaze.
Then he winces, his features contorting into something that promises news Dean isn’t going to enjoy and those blue eyes look at him sheepishly. “I have a confession to make.”
“Go Cas, go be with your brothers. With Inias,” Dean says as he shakes his head. He presses his lips into a flat line to hide his frown and he turns to stalk away before Cas can argue with him.
“Ephraim claimed you would heal faster if your body slept, so we only let the medicine wear off to make sure you drank some broth,” Sam says, finishing Cas’ thought.
Cas looks up from where he’s typing on Dean’s phone with a startled expression. “No, uh, it’s a Motorola.”
Sleep reclaims him quickly, and his dreams feature soft smiles and golden freckles set to a soft and happy melody.
“That one in New Mexico. With the pool? Anyway, you remember what happened?” Sam’s eyes gleam with the promise of making his point and proving Dean wrong.
“Gonna make you come, wanna feel you,” the man mutters in Cas’s ear, shattering his wayward fantasy and Cas groans for an entirely different reason.
Castiel wraps his arms around Dean, holding him tightly. His adoration for this human swells and overflows, he only wishes there was a way to make Dean truly believe in the depths of his affection. “I need to hear the words” Cas whispers into Dean’s ear before nipping lightly at his earlobe.
His stomach flutters anxiously as he waits, leaning his elbow against the warm brick with a hand on his cocked hip. The ground here is perpetually damp and the air reeks vaguely of trash, but all in all, it isn’t a bad spot.
“Does the name Marv mean anything to you?” Sam asks and Dean nearly recoils from the cloud of anger that forms around Cas.
Dean closes his eyes and tries to focus on how sexy Cas looks. How this is supposed to be fun. Cas must sense his discomfort because he places a gentle kiss to his lips and Dean calms instantly.
Dean shrugs. “Yeah, not gonna be able to get any cars in here until I can guarantee I won’t be getting glitter everywhere.”
Cas shakes his head again. Alfie must be mistaken. There is no way Inias sees him as anything more than a friend.
His warriors know that Dean will not tolerate abuse in his camp and they abide by his rules without question. The monks are left uncomfortable but unharmed. Dean is not concerned by most of his warriors, he is only careful to keep an eye on the other pair of brothers on this raid. Azazel and Alastair.
He sighs and shakes his head the same way he tries to shake off the misplaced disappointment he feels.
Cas hums and relishes the taste of Dean’s lips, sweet with just a touch of mint from the gum he had been chewing. Underneath lies a taste that is simply Dean, one of Castiel’s favorite flavors. He could spend the night doing nothing more than standing here, kissing his boyfriend, and be perfectly content.
Dean’s smile fades and he nods. “It was about ten years ago, when I was first starting out and a tabloid got a photo of me kissing some groupie, a
Sam rolls his eyes as Cas watches their exchange intently. Dean sounds almost offended as he waves toward Cas, surely telling his brother that he will do as he pleases. Castiel’s opinion means nothing.
They cross the space like magnets drawn together and collide in the center of the Winchester front lawn to hold each other tight.
“Hey,” Dean says, plastering himself against Cas’ back as he wraps his arms around Cas’ middle to pull Cas against him. “You’re what’s best for me.”
Dean ignores how strange it still feels to address their past life in much the same way as their current one but he sees no reason not to.
Now that he’s certain his cheeks are permanently red from the fear of embarrassment, he grasps Dean’s hand tightly to lead them back to the table.
Dean shakes his head, no, but glances towards Sarah and her partner. Deep down, Dean entertains the idea of sinking to the floor and kneeling between Castiel’s spread thighs and letting his Angel use his mouth right here in front of everyone. His dick hardens further, nearly painfully so and he forces himself to look away.
Sam sighs. “It’s just not polite to discuss what you and your partner like with other people. Especially family” He tries to explain. “It’s, uh….it’s private” He looks toward Cas with sincerity, trying to make the angel understand.
Cas shrugs. “No weirder than a blow job” How would it be? He had researched the topic and it all seemed fairly straightforward.
“Oh yeah.” Benny folds his arms over his chest and watches the scene unfold carefully. Cas doesn’t miss the way Benny’s eyes never stop scanning the crowd, even if it is made up of mostly toddlers and their exhausted mothers.
But that dark little cloud begins to form in Dean’s mind, casting doubt and renewing his deeply rooted sense of guilt. The bottom of his stomach drops out and bile rises in his throat.
Something heavy passes between them and Dean swallows hard. Any teasing jibe he may have thought to say dies on his tongue when he sees the simple adoration gleaming in Castiel’s eyes. He swallows hard, a flush rising in cheeks as he turns his attention to where Cas’ cock lays against his thigh, half-hard and waiting.
Cas perches at the edge of the bed they’ve come to share and his cock bobs at attention in front of him. Dean’s lips travels across Cas’ cheek and down his throat, licking and sucking with the occasional nip that has Cas whimpering with pleasure. Dean bats Cas’ hand away when he reaches for the hunter and Cas whines at the rebuke. Dean’s teeth skim against Castiel’s shoulder, mouth spread wide in a grin as his kisses continue to travel the toned expanse of skin in front of him.
Cas nods and pulls Dean onto his lap. “Yeah?” Cas doesn’t bother hiding his wide smile. They’ve only got two more days until they have to head back and four before they have to part ways if Dean is going to be back to work on time, but that still leaves four days for just them and Cas couldn’t be happier.
He lifts his hips in offering and he can feel Dean smile against his skin. “Please,” Cas says softly, his voice barely more than a breathy whisper. “Make me feel good.”
He tears up when he learns he has three nieces and nephews, Michael’s children. Twin girls and a little boy with a mop of dark hair and bright blue eyes.
Dean hums to himself as he waits for his toast to pop, fingers drumming idly on the worn countertop in the garage’s grease-stained breakroom.
Dean shakes his head and reclaims his favorite little spot in the crook of Cas’ neck with a sniffle.
Cas goes stiff and Mary releases him quickly with a sheepish smile. “Sorry, I just...sorry,” she says apologetically.
Dean gives him a soft smile and shakes his head in disagreement. “Very brave,” Dean says as he reaches for the jar of ointment. Cas looks past Dean, to the wall behind him as he holds out his hands. “No more fieldwork until your hands heal. Be more careful.”
Cas shakes his head. It’s not okay. He should never have brought the damn thing. He should have played it off casually instead of delving straight into an obvious panic. He should have known something like this would happen. “It’s nothing.”
Saturday afternoon comes with the speed of molasses in wintertime, but eventually, Dean finds himself trudging up the stairs to Castiel’s apartment and lifting his hand to knock.
“Cas,” Dean whines before Cas silences him with another kiss and he bites at Dean’s lower lip gently as Dean’s fingers toy with the waistband of his boxers. “Off,” Dean demands, shoving the offending fabric down as best as he can from this angle.
The ride up is silent and Cas can’t help but worry that Benny is going to be joining them in the room too, but he breathes a silent sigh of relief when Dean waves him off once they exit the elevator. “If you need anything, you know where to find me, brother. You boys take care,” Benny says with a wink as holds out his hand for Cas to shake.
“Right, Salida.” Cas sighed, knowing he’d forget again. “Remind me to get some Tylenol before we head back to the hotel, please.”
“Doubtful. She's in California and I'm in Kansas,” Dean answered, scrolling on his phone. “Here we go. The address for the hotel. Show me that electronic doo-dad of yours.”
“I know that,” Dean scoffed. “Just wasn't with her. Anyways, let's hit the road. We still gotta eat something. I don't want to get too sloshed. Not that I would with beer. But you're a lightweight.” He grinned at Cas as he stood up.
boyfriend now. Rather than risk any problems between him and Dean, Cas simply kept quiet. When Dean finally did end things with Meg, Cas barely was able to contain his relief.
Cas opened the envelope, gasping softly. Inside was a handful of bills in small denominations. “I can't accept this you guys! It's too much,” he told them, moving to hand the envelope back to her.
that? Not that it wasn’t wanted, he wanted it very much. But Cas never gave him any indications about having mutual feelings. Maybe… it was just one of those things guy friends did? Although the idea of sucking off one of his male friends didn’t sound very appealing.
Cas glanced at him over his shoulder and smiled. “I promise not to take all day. I know we got a lot of road to travel on yet. Half hour tops.”
A few minutes later, the waitress returned with their drinks and they placed their order. As she walked away from them, Cas reached for his glass and pulled the paper top off of his straw.
Both of them rushed to Cas’ side, Dean laying his hand on Cas’ shoulder. Helplessness and fear washed over him, continuously calling out Cas’ name with no reaction. After a few long minutes (had it been minutes? It felt like hours), Sam tried saying Cas’ name again, hoping to get him to respond. Dean’s heart was racing, unsure what to do to help but unable to move either. Cas’ eyes slowly opened, looking at Sam.
Dean’s hand stroked Cas’ cock too slow to do anything but add to the teasing that his finger was  doing to Cas’ hole. Moans as well as conflicting pleas escaped as Cas grabbed fistfuls of the comforter underneath them. Pleas for more as well as begging for him to stop teasing. Dean chose to listen to the pleas for more, finally bending down to flick his tongue along the edges of Cas’ hole, stroking Cas a little faster.
He was better than ‘good’ but didn’t know how he felt about getting sucked off by his best friend, a best friend he was practically was in love with. What the hell was he supposed to say?
Fuck. Dean’s head was spinning. He didn't know what possessed him to start touching Cas, but just couldn't
Dean’s small smile dropped instantly but didn’t get a chance to say anything before Cas turned away from him and walked to the van.
“Good. Now finish your breakfast so we can go see our moms,” he told him, turning back to his own plate and bumping him with his shoulder.
Cas finally stopped shaking, but it did little to quell Dean’s fear. Cupping Cas’ cheek, Dean tried rousing him gently. Finally he was greeted with blue eyes looking back at him, Dean swallowed his fear as he helped Cas sit up. Sam quickly excused himself, mumbling something about finding another way out since Rowena had taken advantage of their worry for Cas to escape and lock them in.They heard Sam moving about in the distance. Cas didn’t move nor did he try meeting Dean’s eyes.
Dean glanced over at him, blinking once, though Cas wasn’t looking at him. He cleared his throat. “Told ya, I'm not getting on a plane, dude. Not even for you.”
“I blacked out for a lot of it,” Cas told them, not looking at either one. “But I… I don’t know. It overwhelmed me. I… I couldn’t control it,” he said angrily.
Dean remained sitting at the table after Cas disappeared to the bathroom, finishing his coffee. Already, he dreaded the return trip home. He would be taking the van back to Kansas before using it for his own move. However, Dean couldn't say he was overly excited about his new job... Oh, don't get him wrong, he loved working on vehicles. It was just the realization that he would now be going home to an empty apartment at night that he was less than thrilled about.
Cas waited a moment, then turned to face the dresser, pressing both palms flat on the surface and bracing himself.
“Oh, what, you wouldn't love me if I got fat?” he challenged, ignoring the fact he mentioned the word love.
“You? Sentimental? Like driving your granddad's old heap of junk? Yeah, haven't noticed.” Dean laughed at his joke.
The woman seems to appear out of nowhere. One second he’s alone, the next she’s standing a few feet in front of him, her back to him. Cautiously he steps towards her, finally calling out to her, asking her what the hell is going on?  He doesn’t know how he knows, but he feels sure that she holds all the answers to his questions. She slowly turns, looking at him from the corner of her eye.
“That was a quick shower,” Dean said, walking around to the driver's side to roll down that window as well.
Cas snickered before disappearing into the bathroom again. Dean heard him turning the water on and tinkering around with something.
Cas followed him, trying unsuccessfully to grab for his bag. Each time, Dean’s grip would tighten on the handle not allowing Cas to take it and chuckling at Cas’ apparent frustration. Cas won by yet another strategically placed poke to Dean’s side. Naturally, he called foul.
God, he hated her. He pressed his lips together to keep from snapping at her, politely smiling. Dean just smiled at him, winking.
“At what age do I have to hit before she stops treating me like a child?” Cas asked, feeling grumpy from the long drive.
“Yeah, but it is still a baby, right?” Dean managed to organize his thoughts enough to add. “I mean the Darkness I saw was an adult, so it still has to… grow up.” Now they knew the missing baby was, in fact,  the Darkness, it still didn’t tell them where she was or explain his conflicting feelings about her.
Any further discussions were thwarted by Sam’s return, informing them he’d found a back door but it was securely locked. Cas glanced over at the metal security gate for only a moment before it suddenly sprang open. Dean shot him another concerned look. “Cas…,” he said softly.
“Stahahahahop,” Cas pleaded as he laughed, trying unsuccessfully to get away. “Plehahahahahse! PLEASE!”
Dean wasn’t sure if ‘thing’ properly explained who the Darkness was, but he wasn’t really sure what to make of her either. “Yeah, it’d be nice if he put down the mai tai and show up for work,” he snarked, getting up
“Just reminiscing. Remember when we shoveled snow for the neighborhood when we were in middle school?”
Dean tried not to picture exactly what  ‘whatever’ might consist of or how much pain it would cause Cas. The poor angel already was sweat-drenched, something he didn’t know angels could even do. “He’s gotta be up to something.
“We were hoping your angel wiring would fight it off,” Sam said. “Or… slow it down at least.” He seemed to be as much at a loss as Dean was.
“Oh, trust me. We'll be stopping. I'm not about to go more than six, eight hours max, without eating.”
“I'm just worried you're going to have a heart attack before you're forty from all those burgers, not to mention your unhealthy obsession with bacon and pie.”
He remembers swirling dark smoke surrounding him, his ears ringing from the howling wind. Glancing around, he hopes for some idea of where he is, but the only thing he can see is more dark smoke. Where the hell is Sam? Did he get swept up in the rolling fog as well, as trapped as Dean seems to be? Should he call out for his brother? Is there even anyone to call out to?
Cas groaned, loving the sound of Dean crying out his name. He ran his tongue on the underside of Dean's cock, slowly moving down his shaft before starting to move back to the top in the same teasing manner. Dean's back kept arching as his hips met with Cas’ bobs. He wasn't going to last much longer, that Cas would make sure of. Hollowing out his cheeks, he started sucking a bit harder, moving faster.
After a few more minutes, thankfully, Dean stopped. Cas let a few residual giggles out before he calmed down, his breathing heavy and Dean’s weight grounding him. “Are you done?” Cas asked, hoping he was.
“Don’t even say it,” Dean warned, pointing threateningly at him. Yeah, they needed help but he’d be damned if it would be Metadouche. They really didn’t need to be kicking that hornet’s nest again.
“Stop. Don't look at me like that. I hate when you look at me like that. Don’t! I’m sorry!” Cas sounded as if he was pleading.
He hadn’t actually meant to fall asleep, but Dean’s hands running over his back, fingers digging into his muscles… it had just felt so good. He had to stop thinking about the weight of Dean’s body pressing him into the mattress or else he would get aroused again.
The question nearly had Cas choking on his beer. Was Dean being serious? Looking at him, he saw Dean was serious as he looked back to him waiting for Cas’ answer. “Um… I don't know,” he answered, thankful he didn't accidentally confess his feelings.
Cas didn’t answer but Dean knew he’d heard him. He stepped into his room and closed the door. Neither of them said anything as Dean came to the bed and laid down, gently pulling on the back of Cas’ shirt, indicating for him to lie down too.
It didn’t sound fine, sounded anything but fine, in fact. “Yeah, but you had Rowena,” Cas pointed out. Because of me, you…” He was unable to finish the sentence. Once again, he had messed up the Winchesters’ plans, and once again it had been Dean who paid for it.
Cas glanced over his shoulder and smiled back at him. How quickly things were forgiven from just a mere touch, absolutely pathetic.
Confusion washes over him again. A mile? He had somehow been transported a mile away? Was it the smoke? The woman? Both?The last thing he remembers is sitting in the Impala, watching in silent horror as rolling smoke barreled towards them. He had told Sam to hold on, already sensing they were in for a rocky ride. Then the smoke and that now familiar roaring had swallowed them up, and there she was, the woman. She had been standing right in front of them, calmly watching them. He had leaned closer to the windshield, trying to get a better look.
He didn’t really need Cas to answer that out loud to know he did. But underneath all this, Cas still worried it was Dean who didn’t trust him. He saw Cas’ lips form the soft answer “Always”, but he was too mesmerized by those lips to really hear the word. , Dean knew he didn’t need any further words for Cas to finally believe he hadn’t lost Dean’s trust. This wasn’t about earning trust but the need to reconnect as well as losing themselves in each other.
Nearly forty minutes later, Dean finally returned, finding Cas stretched out on his stomach on top of the double bed wearing shorts and a tee shirt. The television was on but he doubted Cas was paying attention since his eyes were closed.
“Don't get any ideas. I'm not getting on a plane. That's you and Sammy’s way of going.” On several occasions bringing up the idea of flying rather than driving. No way in hell was he leaving Baby for that long of a period. Not to mention it would be a cold day in hell before he stepped on one of those metal death traps.
“I had another memory from when Rowena cursed me. Crowley was there as well, and I tried attacking him.”
Inside the main office, Dean waited for the clerk to check them out, leaning one hip against the faux marble desk and looked out to the parking lot. Watching Cas for a few minutes, guilt washed over him. It was official; he was an asshole. He had never been good at talking about his feelings -- just ask Meg -- but he knew he should’ve at least said
Cas stared at Dean's retreating form as he sprinted to the bathroom. The door shut with a force that made Cas jump and he sighed, waiting. He shifted and pulled the covers up to his waist, turning onto his side so he could see the television and the bathroom door. He reached for the remote and flipped through the channels until he found something halfway decent, glancing over at the door every few minutes. He was half hoping for Dean to emerge, half glad he didn't. He forced himself to stay calm and tried to focus on the show and the heaviness of his eyes.
“Tell me what?” Dean asked, not looking at him as he dragged a finger across the laminated menu, studying the burger description.
Their food arrived a short time later, Cas glanced at Dean's plate with a laugh. “There's your favorite; green beans.”
“We are. But look around, dude,” Dean said, turning to face the street with his arms out to the side. “You got Taco Bell there,” he pointed. “KFC there.” Another point. “Not to mention McDonald’s and Burger King. So, what’s your pick?”
“Found a diner down the street,” Dean said, pulling out another sandwich from the bag which no doubt was a cheeseburger. “Sit down, you gotta be starving, too.”
“What do you mean? I thought we were getting something to eat?” Cas asked him with a look of confusion.
“Dean,” Cas sighed again, this time he sounded concerned, “Promise me you'll take care of yourself.”
How idiotic he was. Dean was obviously straight. For a moment forgetting, allowing himself to revel in Dean's attention at the restaurant. He didn't need the reminder nor wanting to witness Dean's shameless flirting either. He slowly made his way back to the truck on the other side of the pump of Dean's car, mentally praying they wouldn't notice him. But he never had the best of luck.
The narrow, winding road was still quiet at this hour. Cas pulled the van into his parents’ driveway as Dean pulled off and parked across the street in front of his own parents’ house. Cas turned the ignition off, content just sitting there and look at the house. It was still the same deep green clapboard house he’d grown up in, the two-door garage housing his mother's red Ford Focus and his dad's silver Buick Enclave. There weren’t three cars parked haphazardly anymore in the front lawn, one for each of the kids.
Sam held up a hand to stop him. “I know, Dean. You don’t have to say anything, all right? Just do me a favor.”
Fuck, that felt good. His eyes closed as he imagined a different hand touching him, memories of Cas from this morning rushed into his mind, stroking himself faster envisioning Cas’ mouth on him again. Oh, god. That fucking mouth. So hot, so wet. Cas’ tongue dragged underneath as he took more into his mouth. Dean’s hand stroked faster in time with fantasy Cas’ mouth. Oh, he was going to come, he was going to come. Feeling his orgasm rising from his toes, he came all over his hand as well as the shower wall, leaning to the side to bite his arm and muffle his moan.
“You seem to be under the impression that I'm incapable of finding my way around, Dean,” Cas said, almost insulted.
“Well, the big question is; where in the hell is she?” Dean turned in his seat, wiping his lower lip with the back of his thumb, groaning softly.
Cindy held her hand out to him. Dean quickly looked back to her, glancing down at her hand, not catching on.
“Look, I hate doing this, but I think it’s best if you stay here,” he told Cas softly, his hand resting on Cas’ thigh.
“Not my fault you're so damn ticklish,” Dean grinned. He couldn’t remember how he got started tickling Cas but now it was almost compulsory.
“You got to. Breakfast is only for another hour. I'm gonna shower real quick, so get your lazy ass up, dude.”
“I think we're making good time. We only got a couple more hours before we hit Goodland,” Cas said suddenly.
He slowed the movements of his mouth, fingers pressing harder against Dean’s sac, not yet ready for it to end. Dean whimpered in protest and Cas smiled around Dean's cock. No, he definitely wasn't ready for it to end. Once again, he ran his tongue from the base of his cock to the tip, swirling on the head.
Dean looked back over at Cas, noting he didn’t look any worse after Sam’s comment about the car. Definitely not what he called better, but at least he wasn’t growling or in discomfort, although he wasn’t answering Sam’s question either.
“Would you look at me?” Dean whispered as a waitress came over. He smiled politely at her, but Cas kept his gaze downwards, taking it upon himself to order the drinks for the both of them. “So, um, Cas,” Dean started once the waitress left them to look over their menus. “Look. I don’t know what happened. I mean, I
Finally making it back to the apartment complex, the sun was now fully shining as he crossed the parking lot towards the unit he shared with Dean, knowing he would probably still be asleep. Dean wasn’t exactly a morning person, refusing to move or do anything until he had at least two cups of coffee. Pulling his keys out of his running shorts’ pocket, Cas jogged up the stairs to the second level. A few people passed him with genuine smiles as they made their way to work and he nodded back politely until he reached the landing. Unlocking his door, he was surprised to see Dean sitting at the small round corner kitchen table already dressed and drinking his coffee from an overly large mug. The mug had been a gag gift for Dean's last birthday, though Dean accepted it readily and claimed it made the perfect coffee mug, especially when he had to be up early.
Neither Dean or Sam answered as they glanced at each other in question and worry. Would Cas be further under the spell’s effects when upset, or in this case, insulted?
Cas watched sympathetically as Dean reached for the ice pack, once again sitting at an angle in his chair. Cas sat back down heavily, pondering Dean’s words. It hadn’t been disgust with him Dean was feeling, but embarrassment at the reminder of when it had been Caswith the bruises when Dean still bore the Mark. Despite how readily he had forgiven Dean for that, it seemed Dean hadn’t yet forgiven himself.
It wasn't a phase, he wasn't confused. He was a twelve-year-old gay boy and he was scared everyone was going to hate him.
“You're the goofy ass who pulled over,” Dean singsonged, relenting and handing him the slip of thick paper.
Dean huffed in response. “He’s gotta have Rowena in his sights, right? I mean, she did try to take him out.” He walked behind Cas, forcing himself not to reach out to touch him.
As Dean hit a particularly sensitive spot, Cas couldn’t stop the moan from escaping. Dean’s fingers played along the bumps of Cas’ spine causing him to moan again. Dean didn’t say anything, continuing to move his hands as he gently rubbed Cas’ back, and Cas’ breathing came in quicker. He felt himself growing harder in his jeans, his erection pressing this side of uncomfortable against the zipper, and he turned, unable to stand it anymore. They stood nearly nose to nose, the air between them seemed to crackle with sexual tension.
“I’m going to take what I want from you,” Cas says as his fingers dig into the fluffy pillow still clutched in his hands. Dean has backed himself onto the bed, on his knees in the middle and still scooting away as Cas follows.
Cas hisses in pain but refuses to let go as Dean attempts to pull him away and force Castiel to loosen his grip.
Lee may be shorter, but he’s stocky and Dean is not prepared when he drops his shoulder and lunges forward with his arms wrapping around Dean’s middle.
“Thanks, man,” The stranger says as he turns and meanders away, leaving Cas alone in the darkness once again.
Cas directs Dean’s motions but makes no move to take over for him. Rufus was right. Cleaning your own fish is rule number two of fishing. Rule number one is baiting your own hook.
the reports on the news about how much bacteria lives on lettuce?” Dean asks Sam. “I’ll take my chances with a greasy burger.”
“A humble-what?” Dean asks, clueless and confused. Meg is speaking nonsense and the way her words curl in the air with sharpened edges as they fall make something cautious twitch low in Dean’s belly.
Castiel chuckles as he steps forward. “Yes, Dean” He gently takes the mask and slides it over Dean’s face. “I thought you might enjoy wearing this one” His smile is gentle and loving as he adjusts the mask to sit properly before running his fingertips down Dean’s bare arm.
Dean remembers with a start that his fingers are still buried inside of Cas and he crooks them with a smirk, derailing Cas’ domineering track to return them to the fact that
He glances back up to see Cas still staring with that soft smile playing on his lips and Gadreel and Inias embroiled in deep conversation, not paying him any attention. Dean allows himself to return Cas’ smile and give the monk a curt nod only to see Cas’ smile grow.
Cas swallows hard and avoids Dean’s gaze. “Have you been to Marshall’s Beach yet? It’s down by the Golden Gate.”
“You’re dating Dean Winchester?” She asks again and Cas wants to melt into the floor for telling her they were on a date.
Dean pauses his ministrations, simply holding Cas’ cock deep in his mouth as he rocks his tongue against the underside; waiting for Cas to look down.
The stars sparkle above him since he light pollution from the city doesn’t make it out as far as Bobby’s house and for the first time since he promised himself to get sober, he feels like he’s going to make it.
Cas smiles down at him sleepily as he pulls out with a wince. He climbs over Dean and brackets his shoulders with his hands before leaning down for a kiss that is far too chaste for what they’ve just done. “Hello, Dean.”
“Good,” Dean finally says with a nod. “Work mainly, my Uncle Bobby’s been kickin my ass even after I got done kicking my own.” He bites his lip, realizing he said too much and stares straight ahead, hoping that Cas won’t ask.
“No, Dean!” Sam fires back and Castiel’s eyes widen. “Listen to him!” Sam says, gesturing to Cas. “He didn’t try to run. He moved only a few paces!” Sam waves his arms over his head and Cas takes a cautious step back, not understanding a word of what Sam is saying to Dean.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas whispers low as his lips brush against the shell of Dean’s ear just enough to tickle.
Dean shrugs, utterly immune to the flat glare Castiel aims in his direction. “Well, if you change your mind, I wouldn’t complain.” He flashes a cocky grin and offers Cas a hand up.
Cas presses two fingers to Dean’s temple, searching with his grace for whatever might be wrong. He finds nothing. No bleeding injuries, no sprains, strains or even bruises. Nothing to suggest why Dean might be behaving this oddly. “Dean, you are beginning to worry me” He strokes light fingers through Dean’s hair as he searches for the source of Dean’s affliction.
“Come on, Cas!” Dean says excitedly as he laces their fingers together and tugs Cas toward the ticket office of the zoo.
Cas huffs, he isn’t certain that Ephraim’s words are entirely true and the thought brings Castiel back to his endless circle of self-loathing. They may listen to Gabriel, but him? Cas is nothing to them but a failure. “Marv was never to be trusted.” He deflects with a wave of his hand.
Now, his stomach threatens to force him to revisit his dinner with the horrifying thought of hurting Dean.
Dean rubs the back of his neck as he leads them through the halls to the outside world. “I’m not ready to share it with anyone.”
Dean obeys quickly and without a word. Once he’s settled in the center of the bed with his legs as far apart as he’s comfortable with, he turns his attention back to Cas.
Cas lifts a hand to rest over Dean’s as he struggles not to lean into the touch. Dean’s nudity fills Castiel with confusion instead of his former fear. He needs to leave.
Dean stares from his drafting table, eyes wide before he glances down at his work and decides that he might as well see what the ruckus is.
“I’m okay,” Cas whispers, unclenching his fingers from Dean’s hair to stroke lightly across his jaw.
A muted rustle in the distance catches Dean’s attention and he stares off in the direction of the sound. A quick look to the monks still awake show that they heard the noise as well, their attention is fixated on a point in the distance rather than Dean.
“I feel gross from the road and you could use some alone time with your friends.” Dean waves a hand toward Meg and the two men in the kitchen.
“That bastard had them tied up naked!” Dean tries to roll away but Castiel’s knot holds fast and he flops back with an unhappy groan.
Cas hums thoughtfully and carefully withdraws his fingers before slinking up Dean’s body to draw him into a heated kiss. “I suppose I should, I’m not into necrophilia.”
“Their trip,” John says. “Turns out Cas is good friends with an old buddy of mine from the Marines.”
“Dean?” Cas questions, looking between the man and the water. Surely Dean can't mean for Cas to undress and... no. Cas stops his thoughts there and shakes his head.
“Dammit Cas,” Dean grumbles as he gives up and rolls out of bed. Now that he’s awake, memories of all the work he needs to do in his yard plant themselves at the forefront of his mind.
Rachel pulls him in readily and he holds her tight as some of his broken pieces begin to knit together. She cries against his shoulder as Andrew joins their hug and Dean watches with a tear rolling down his cheek.
Dean surges forward to press their lips together messily. Their teeth clash but Cas doesn’t back away as Dean pulls his hand back just enough to add a second finger. Cas arches beneath him, a fresh gush of lube(?) coats Dean’s fingers and he groans into their kiss. “Fuck, Cas.” Dean is going to ignore how weird this is and focus on how
Except, that isn’t what Dean see and his heart flutters as he takes in the gently upturned corners of Cas’s lips.
Cas nods and lets out a heavy breath. “Dean is a new friend,” he says quietly as he types out his response.
“Dean,” Cas whispers and brushes his fingers against Dean’s wrist to carefully get the man’s attention.
Cas chuckles and shakes his head. “I said let me take care of you” Dean nods sleepily, resisting a yawn and knowing full well that a shower sounds like entirely too much effort right now. Maybe just this once he’ll let Cas use his mojo on him. Afterall, he’s been using it on him already tonight.
Cas returns his glare pound for pound, fighting the smile that makes the corners of his mouth twitch.
He’s less than half of Asmodeus’ age but he’s injured. His left arm lacks the strength to support him in hand to hand combat.
That was when Samuel had burst through the door to the sanctuary and their father had shoved Dean and little Sam behind the alter, telling Dean to “take care of Sammy.”
Dean freezes, stunned by the sudden hug, and he swallows hard as he wraps his arms around Cas’ back and holds him gently. The weight Castiel gave his words isn’t lost on him and he feels like he’s missing something vital, something just out of his reach.
“You should give me your number, we could hang out.” Missy turns to finish making his drink and Cas flushes.
“Let’s just get the beer and get out. You need anything?” Dean asks to distract himself from the mental images that Cas has planted in his brain. The images that little Dean might be threatening to show interest in and turn this shopping trip into an experience he would rather not have.
He could float away on a cloud and he wouldn’t care. Hell, he wouldn’t care if Cas bent him over and fucked him right now in front of James. Hmm, maybe that would be a good idea…
Dean gasps as the head of Cas’ cock breaches his hole and the slick length glides in effortlessly. Both men groan when Cas bottoms out but the Angel doesn’t wait for Dean to adjust and draws back sharply.
Dean clears his throat and shakes off the moment before Cas can comment further. “I, uh, I was also thinking maybe we could have dinner with Sam? If that’s okay, I mean, you don’t have to meet him if you’re not ready…”
Lee grins. “I feel ya, man. Can’t be comfortable tryin to share space with this idiot,” he fake whispers, using his hand to both shield his face and point his thumb at Dean. “Not sure how you put up with his snoring.” He claps Cas on the shoulder playfully while Dean shoves him away.
Cas’ heart stutters with his next thought. “Would you be interested in conserving water?” Cas asks with an arched brow that he hopes comes off as suggestive.
Silence clicks where his thoughts should be and he can’t help the blank stare that he captures Dean with. Dean wants him to stay? All night? He licks his suddenly too dry lips and Dean shifts his gaze, cheeks reddening. “Okay,” Cas manages to choke out with a disbelieving nod.
“How do you know my name?” Cas asks. He’s certain his heart stopped beating when she said his name and started crying, and he hopes it starts again soon because his stomach is cramping painfully. “Who are you?” Cas’ voice comes out frail and unsure, high pitched in a way that betrays his impending panic.
By the end of the first movie, the pie is half gone and they’re pressed together from shoulder to hip.
“Winchester,” Dean and Cas say in unison and Cas swears his heart is about to beat out of his chest. Has he really had a thin connection to Dean for years before they met? He shakes his head and swallows hard.
“Dean?” Castiel urges Dean to look at him. “Are you ok?” Cas questions, concern flooding his expression.
Bobby stares, narrowing his eyes until Cas is ready to squirm. When he steps forward, it takes everything Cas has to keep his feet planted and his chin up. “Castiel, huh? Well, it’s nice to finally meet you. Thought this one was never gonna shut up about you,” Bobby says, lips twitching into something resembling a smile as he points his thumb at Dean before holding out a hand for Cas to shake.
Dean looks to him expectantly, so Cas gives him a nod and careful smile. “Yes, Dean,” He says softly, resisting the urge to thank the man again for stepping between him and Lilith.
He wonders if they’ll change their minds now and then just as quickly decides that he doesn’t care. He had loved sleeping next to Cas and waking up tangled together during their week in Rome. Even Sam sleeping in the same room and forcing them to keep their hands above the waist didn’t stop that week from being the best sleep Dean has ever had.
Dean shrugs again, his blush growing deeper. “I know we’re trying not to rush and if you think it’s too soon, I understand, but at least hold onto them while you’re here. I’ll feel better knowing you can come and go while I have to work.”
Cas smiles at him like Dean is the most adorable thing he’s ever seen. “Dean, if you think for a moment that I would turn down a chance to be close to you, then I need to do a better job of showing you.” Cas leans forward and draws Cas into an easy kiss, one that’s full of promise and has Dean’s eyes fluttering closed.
Cas leans down to leave a trail of kisses from Dean’s sternum to his navel before traveling to mouth at the sharp cut of Dean’s hips. He nips slightly, closing his teeth around each jut of muscle and pressing down enough to make Dean jerk beneath him.
Cas lifts his ass to help, staring at Dean with wide blue eyes; brows drawn together in confusion. He won’t deny how appealing Dean looks streaked with blood and with the adrenaline still pumping through his veins from the fight. A wild and unsure look, nearly manic, dilutes the color of Dean’s eyes as he glares down at Cas. The human’s heart hammers in his chest, Castiel can feel the thundering motion as if the man’s heart were visible before him. Cas spreads his legs in an offering. “Dean” He rasps, not willing to apologize but more than willing to be taken by Dean.
“Dean!” Cas protests with a laugh as he blindly grabs for his computer to keep it from crashing to the hardwood floor. “Computer!”
Dean nods, ignoring the deep ache permeating his body. “Don’t leave me,” he mutters, words slurred by the call of unconsciousness.
“Checking their wings,” Cas says absently, moving slowly to prevent startling the small animal. “I think they’re okay. We should put them outside.”
Cas handles this hit better, keeping the coughing to a minimum and letting the cloud of thick white smoke out in a heavy rush as he stares at Dean unblinkingly.
Dean laughs and shakes his head as he looks at the floor. “Yeah, well, you cost me a kiss.” He points playfully.
“If that’s the best you got, then yes. Yes, you are.” Dean bumps their shoulders together with a fond smile on his lips. “You’re adorable.” He hums in thought while Castiel slumps in his seat. “I got an idea.” Dean suddenly snaps his fingers and reaches for the saltshaker in the middle of the table.
“Of course, Dean” Castiel’s voice sounds distant, almost resigned and Dean immediately feels guilty for making him feel that way.
Dean feels his brows arching before he can stop them. “Oh?” This ought to be great. Fantastic even. He’s going to be sorely disappointed if this attractive stranger was behind this fiendish prank that is going to cost him a week’s worth of business while he tries to clean his garage.
Dean huffs and shakes his head as he cinches his arm around Cas’s shoulders. “You do remember what you told me when I was afraid to call Sam, right?”
Inias lays a comforting hand on Cas’ shoulder and his gentle gaze bores deep into Castiel’s soul. “You will find a way, Castiel. Trust in God, my brother. All will be as
“Dean!” Cas hisses from across the table when Teddy turns on his heel and heads toward the bar. “You didn’t have to do that.”
Dean grins. “And yet you still like me.” He takes the napkin and dabs at his chin with a cheeky wink.
“I am as well as I can be. And you?” Cas answers and turns the question on Inias. The shy smile he receives in return is enough of an answer.
Cas nods and tilts his gaze to the ceiling and prays for salvation. “We’re in trouble. I know it. Trust nothing from any of them.”
“You can” Castiel voices his undying faith in the hunter and keeps going. His thrusts remain steady and Dean twitches each time his palm rubs against the head of Dean’s half hard cock. “You can” He repeats like a mantra.
He needs to know. It’s obvious that Mick already has some attachment to him and Cas really needs to stop encouraging him, but the money…
“You…you said people only watch porn when they’re alone” Castiel’s voice is a little high, a little frantic and he’s looking at Dean like he has a third eye sprouting from the center of his forehead. He clearly was prepared for Dean to shoot his idea out of the sky, not easily agree with him!
“No, I uh,” He says before pausing to take a deep breath. “I tend to avoid mind-altering substances.” He needs to talk to Dean before he tells everyone about his family history.
Another firm smack lands on his ass and Dean yelps. “I don’t quite believe you are” Castiel growls, giving Dean one more slap square in the middle of his ass.
“Yeah?” Dean’s eyes widen and he glances toward the closed bathroom door. “Why are you telling me this?” She should be telling Cas.
After Dean’s vehement denial and failed attempt to explain, Cas distanced himself and only reluctantly left his bed when Dean ordered him to come to eat.
He’s faced this torment for years. Every fiber of his eternal being demands that he bring order to the long-neglected flower beds and each day he refuses to give in to his nature.
Cas makes short work of spinning Dean around and guiding him to the table. “I’m gonna bend you over and fuck you hard and fast. If you don’t come on my cock, you will wait till later” Cas growls in Dean’s ear as his hand presses into Dean’s lower back.
“Delicious,” Cas says, dropping his voice low just too see how red he can make Dean flush. He shakes his head internally at himself, berating this game of chicken he’s started playing. He has no business teasing Dean, but the way his green eyes shine and his freckles stand out against his pink cheeks is too tempting to resist. For the first time in years, he wants to find out what delectable noises he can draw from someone. He wants to be touched with the reverence that Dean’s eyes are promising him.
“You look great, Cas.” Dean tweaks Cas’ bowtie once more for good measure. “Not sure why you’re complaining.”
Dean lets out a shaky breath. “I can’t… I’m not going to try to force him to do something he doesn’t want to do.”
“Ugh” Cas shifts, limbs trembling with the overload of sensation. “More” He whimpers, arching his hips off the bed. His cock leaks a thick bead of precome that drips down his length, not unlike the wax from the candle in Dean’s hand.
“Now, back to the task at hand. Dean begged me to let him meet you, went on and on about your incredible blue eyes and wholesome profile. But, I’ve got one question for you before I sign off on this.” She sets her coffee aside and folds her arms over her chest. Her green eyes are sharp and her glare would be damning if she were bigger, but even so, Cas takes a half step back for safety’s sake.
Dean all but tumbles out of baby in his haste to escape the awkward tension that has settled between them. He doesn’t forget his manners though, Ellen would have his hide, and he strides around to the other side of the car to wait for Cas.
Hot liquid coats his hand and the gun clatters to the floor as Missy’s sobs finally reach his ears but Cas is still moving. He stabs, again and again until the man slumps lifeless to the floor, greasy blond hair now matted with the blood pooling beneath him.
The two days on the road with Dean are some of the most relaxed and carefree that he has experienced since he first left home, high on his newfound freedom and confident that he was going to find everything he would ever need.
Staring back at him is a photo of him and Dean. Cas’ back is to the camera, he can’t quite be identified but the way they’re standing and the adoring look in Dean’s eyes makes his intent clear enough.
In the distance, Dean sees a shadow move, a person watching him approach and his stomach lodges in his throat. From this far away he can’t tell if that person is Castiel, but Meg promised him that Cas is the only one who sets up in this area. He slouches slightly and convinces his bowlegs to straighten as he dips his chin, trying to disguise himself just enough to avoid suspicion.
Inias and Alfie are meek and gentle souls although Dean holds the impression that Alfie is more of a nickname than the young man’s true name. Regardless, they might do well tending to the village widows.
Sam, who thought having the mysterious Castiel there would help Dean feel more at ease when he meets Jess for the first time.
“But Dean...he, he wants to. Like Alastair,” Cas starts before sparing Dean a quick glance as Sam cuts him off with harsh words.
“What the hell Sam!” Dean barks, quickly throwing a blanket over him and Cas. It’s too late. They all know it’s too late. There are some things a little brother never needs to see, and his big brother being balls deep inside his neighbor is one of them. “You ever hear of knocking?!”
“I want you to count each strike. All thirty of them” Castiel explains, tapping Dean’s ass lightly. “Do you understand”
Cas hisses and his eyes clench as their erections rub together, the delicious friction too enticing to ignore. “Yes, Dean. Tie me. Make me yours,” Cas rasps as he reaches for the crossbar of the headboard, intent on restraining himself if needs be.
“Gabriel,” Gabriel says with just a shade too much cheer as his eyes drag over the easy way they fit together and Castiel does not miss the way his eyes narrow at the sight of his hand covering Dean’s.
Sunday is their favorite day. The one day of the week they decide to stay home and not walk the streets in search of customers.
Thankfully, Dean’s eyes are closed lazily and his hands are folded over the stretch of freckled skin where his shirt has ridden up.
“No way.” Cas shakes his head and stares down at his phone with a grimace. The little thumbs-up emoji stares back at him. Taunting him.
“You said there was a case?” Dean prods, ignoring Sam’s contrition. Just because he’s gotten all touchy-feely with Cas and talking about stuff, doesn’t mean he’s ready or willing to have the same conversation with Sam.
“Awesome.” Dean smiles softly as Benny leads them to the elevator and bundles the three of them inside.
He finally remembers to check his phone as he waits for his espresso machine to fire up and he can’t help the huff of laughter that escapes him as he opens Balthazar’s response to his text last night.
He coaxes Dean to sit up and reverently helps him remove his shirts before climbing over him and pressing him into the mattress.
“I love you,” Cas whispers, quickly pressing a kiss into Dean’s hair to distract from his awkward declaration.
“One more day,” Dean mutters to himself as his tremors slow and he swallows hard against the bile rising in his throat. “One more day.” He reminds himself of his promise to take this one day at a time.
He growls his frustrations lowly as dust kicks up around him. The sparse crowd parts around him, none willing to intrude upon his brooding but that doesn’t stop their hushed whispers from reaching his ears.
“Sam” Dean draws out the word, determined to pry whatever has Sam in a snit out before it festers and he wants to have a full conversation involving
When Dean turns to the wings and opens his arms in invitation, mouthing silent pleas for Cas to join him, his resolve crumbles and Cas lets out a browbeaten sigh.
Cas goes still beneath him and Dean looks down in time to see Cas’ eyes spark blue. Dean looks away quickly, just in case, but he can feel when Cas is done. He turns back to see his Angel blink away the last traces of his grace and his soft smile makes Dean’s stomach warm pleasantly. “Now they can’t,” Cas whispers as he runs his hands up Dean’s bare arms.
He smiles and hopes he doesn’t look as stunned as he feels. “Yes, Dean,” he manages to say around the lump of nervous excitement clogging his throat.
Dean nods before being reminded to use his words by a single raised brow and the tightening of fingers in his hair. “Y….yeah.”
Dean had a stalker? Cas’s heart patters uncomfortably with the short burst of adrenaline. “No?” He dares to say, chewing his lip as he fiddles with their clasped fingers. “I didn’t know there was a stalker.”
“Please let me take you somewhere with a proper bed,” Mick murmurs as he strokes his fingertips down Castiel’s cheek. “You would love my apartment, I’m sure of it. I’ve got the best mattress money can buy.”
“Someone like me,” Cas says, agreeing even though he can’t bring himself to meet Dean’s eyes. He stares down the street, in the direction of the barely habitable apartment he shares with Meg. “I need to go.”
His skin itches with the need to feel a man’s touch as something more than a stolen moment that flirts with the edge of danger.
“Still, shit, is that why you didn’t want to go out to dinner with me? Money?” Dean guesses and Castiel’s stomach plummets at just how perceptive his new friend is.
The second stump is set clear of the gore from the first and hot tears streak down Ruby’s cheeks as Sam leads her to where Dean now stands. Dean takes hold of the woman’s hands and leans close to Sam.
“Thank you, Sir” Dean forces himself to say as he drops his head on his shoulder and tries not to shake.
Dean is glad for the soft way Cas is staring at him, but he still feels a not so small amount of self-loathing brewing deep in his gut.
“We have a few minutes,” Dean says with a smirk, relishing the buzzing excitement between them. He reaches for Cas’ cummerbund and pulls him forward. “I want a taste now.” He pushes the cummerbund up and toys with Cas’ zipper as he sinks to his knees.
Cas’ eyes narrow further and that beautiful blue nearly disappears and he lifts his chin proudly. “Then why are my plants dying under your feet?”
He drops back, head hitting the pillow and he struggles to stay still. “Feels so good” He mumbles, barely coherent as the sensations run directly from his foot to his dick; which is a weeping mess laying hard across his belly. He doesn’t want to touch himself, not yet. This is too good to hurry along.
“So, that was fun,” Cas says as soon as the doors close around them and they’re alone in Dean’s car.
“Yeah, we probably should.” Dean’s fingers brush the back of Cas’ hand and Cas is sorely tempted to rotate his wrist and lace their fingers together.
Cas nods. “I appreciate your apology, Dean.” Cas’s words are stilted but his smile is soft enough to release a fraction of the tension set in his shoulders.
James nods and then shakes his head. “For this, you’d stay dressed as long as you’re comfortable. I wouldn’t be touching any of your intimate places, just arms and legs mainly as I guided Castiel in how to tie you.”
“Cas?” Dean’s lips part as if he can’t believe the man in front of him. “Charlie said you were, well…you, but damn. I liked your picture but I didn’t expect...” Dean snaps his jaw shut and swallows hard as he shakes his head. “I’m rambling.”
Cas hums but doesn’t say anything as he wraps his arms around Dean and holds him tight. The voices from the kitchen grow louder and Cas narrowly resists a groan as he recognizes Meg’s sultry voice added to the mix.
The lady behind the counter laughs and shakes her head. “You sure you can handle a dead-eye with an extra shot?”
He’s already gotten his daily disaster out of the way, so he’s confident this date is going to go smoothly.
Cas doesn’t have much, being an Angel and not seeing the need to ever wear anything other than his usual uniform outside of their room, so Dean isn’t sure what to expect when he slides open the drawer.
Dean turns as slowly as he dares, keeping his gaze downward to avoid the disappointment he knows must be written across Castiel’s features. “I’m sorry” He mumbles, feeling the guilt of ruining this for Cas sinking in his stomach like a stone.
Dean lets the act go unremarked. He knows all too well of his brother’s thirst for knowledge. Sam loves to read and his research has served them well on this trip. Sam has a curious mind and Dean will not begrudge him that.
Dean moans into the kiss, his hard cock straining inside his slightly too tight jeans and soaking the front of his panties. He feels so good, skin flushed and cheeks heated; just enough adrenaline pumping through his veins to not care so much about having an audience. He steals a glance at the couple next to them, the Dom’s finger’s twined tightly in his submissive’s hair as she swallows around his cock. A new pair is on the stage now, two women clad in skin-tight leather. At any other point in his life, Dean would have been dying to watch, but the cock teasing at his lips is far more alluring.
“Cas,” Dean says softly. “I promised,” Dean says in Castiel’s language, the words coming slow and stiff.
Dean bites his lip and toys with the edge of the blanket between his fingers. He can’t bring himself to meet Cas’ gaze. A dozen
“My name is Castiel, by the way, I’m really sorry about this Mr. Singer,” Castiel rambles as he starts sweeping at the edge of the mess.
Dean huffs a laugh and shakes his head. “You sure you’re ready for that?” Dean understands him perfectly.
“Your brother did this?” Dean questions, his voice wooden. He’s torn between apologizing for Cole’s actions and screaming his outrage about the craft herpes infection he’s been saddled with.
Dean swallows hard and turns, catching the almost yellow eyes of his cousin standing with a knife to Benny’s throat.
The girl drops her knees beside him and rests a hand over his glowing vest with a sad expression. “Thank you, mister. Your bravery will not be forgotten.” She gives him a firm nod before pushing to her feet and darting off into the darkness.
“That was,” Dean starts to say but shakes his head with a lazy smile. He drags his fingers through their cooling come with a look of awe and Cas can’t help the delighted little skip the caveman part of his brain does at the sight.
Cas’ breath hitches and he swallows thickly. Dean is entrancing, confident and clearly enjoying himself as he sinks down on Castiel’s lap. Cas nods, already having forgotten what Dean had asked.
The larger man releases his hold on Castiel the instant the rope falls away and Cas hurries back to the place he’s come to consider his. Benny gives him a firm nod and turns away, leaving Cas to rub the feeling back into his hands and stretch his arms over his head.
Dean does as Cas says and his pole bends terrifyingly as the creature on the end his line zips away from the pier. “Cas?” Dean mutters when the bright red fish breaks the surface and Cas can feel Dean’s flinch of surprise. “What was that!?
He tamps down on his excitement quickly, not willing to get ahead of himself quite yet. “How are you?” He chews his lips and sits up straighter on the couch so he doesn’t miss a word.
Dean hums in agreement. “Like seeing you riled up” He mumbles into his pillow, leaning back into Castiel’s touch.
His mouth waters and he can feel his gums ache where his canines beg to sink into tender flesh, to claim what the alpha in him knows to be his. “You are infuriating.”
“You should invite Dean up here.” Meg’s voice pulls him out of the show and he lifts his head to stare down at her with narrowed eyes. She blinks at him innocently and pries herself off his shoulder to roll her eyes when he continues to stare with wide eyes and a slack jaw. “If he’s going to be on your life, I want to meet him.”
Castiel runs his fingertips along the outline of Dean’s jaw, frowning at the bit of gore still clinging to his hunter. Dean sighs into the touch, blinking his eyes closed as he swallows thickly. He’s still upset, but his anger has been dampened enough for now. The rest simply needs time. “I’m sorry, Dean. I did not mean to upset you. I did not consider my actions beyond my drive to protect you”
“You see what you do to me, Dean?” Cas’ voice is rough as he undoes the button of his slacks. His cock springs free when he pushes his pants down and steps out of them, stepping towards Dean with purpose.
“Dean” Cas questions again and Dean lets his head hang with a deep exhale. Cas removes his feet and sits more upright before patting his knee. “Turn and face me, Dean”
He’d rather be kissing him, but the way his stomach twists into knots at the thought of Ellen and Sam seeing him kissing a man chills the heat in his veins and he’s left giving Cas an awkward little smile as he nudges him toward Jess. “You’ll be alright. I promise they don’t bite.” Dean winks, because he’s Dean freaking Winchester and he does not cuddle.
“I don’t think I enjoyed denying you,” Cas says, his tone haltingly serious. “I want to give you everything. Keeping your from climaxing was…not my preferred way to torment you.”
Dean raises his sword as he rushes across the clearing. “Get off of him!” Dean growls as he reaches for Alastair, ripping him away from the monk and casting him roughly onto the ground. Dean quickly places himself between the men while the monk screams through his sobs as he scrambles away.
Cas sucks in a cleansing breath through his nose and nods as Dean leads him across the room and under the still-warm blankets.
If he isn’t talking to Sam, Dean is working and pretending that the outside world doesn’t exist. Getting greasy and sweaty underneath and inside cars is the only way he’s been able to distract himself from the weight of an entire week of being ignored.
Cas continues his ministrations until Dean’s eyelids are heavy and his body hums with endorphins. “You’re amazing,” Dean mumbles when Cas gives his shoulders one last squeeze.
Cas nods, eyeing Dean with purpose before grabbing the laptop and cradling it with one hand before taking Dean’s hand with his other. “We can start slow”
His hands tremble as he reaches carefully between Dean and Samuel to set his burden down. Dean had requested Castiel be the one to serve him and his father, Cas being his great prize that the green-eyed man desires to show off and Jarl Samuel had relented.
Instead of commenting, he turns his gaze skyward and breathes deep as his smirk softens into a smile. The stars overhead are bright and the nighttime air is cool, peaceful. He turns toward Cas and gestures toward Baby. “Sit with me?”
He rubs his eyes again as the pit in his stomach grows. She doesn’t need him anymore, he should go back to his apartment.
Dean’s heart skips a beat at Cas’ tone. His voice holds no heat and sounds almost gentle as if he isn’t angry that Dean very nearly violated his budding trust.
Balthazar sighs and begins to undo the lacing around Cas’ collar and Cas goes like a rag doll when Bal urges him to lift his arms to help gets his shirt over his head. “You’re really going to make me do this, aren’t you?” Balthazar mutters as he starts on the lacing of Cas’ pants.
Cas looks around in a blind panic, searching for Dean but the man has disappeared. Cas tugs violently on the ropes binding him with a strangled sound and his heart threatens to beat out of his chest.
The last years have taught him to submit, to let others take what they want from his body, but the way Dean gives himself over so readily has a desperate whine escaping this throat.
“That’s him again, isn’t it?” Meg props her chin on her hands and stares, her brown eyes baleful as her lips form a pout.
sound sexy, but it’s Cas’ fingers in question and Dean is fairly certain his body has been conditioned to excite at even the thought of Castiel touching him.
Cas grimaces at the thought of being anywhere and being functional at nine in the morning, but he’s too curious to say no. He’ll deal with being miserable when the time comes.
Dean swallows hard and nods. “It’s early, I get it.” Dean trails off with narrowed eyes as his head tilts, pointing an ear toward the ceiling and his eyes slide closed and his jaw tightens. “Sonufabitch,” he mutters under his breath.
someone right now and the only person he wants is Dean. He sniffled and wipes his eyes as he looks around, trying to figure out where he is.
Cas sucks in a deep breath and shrugs. Dean is offering so he might as well go for it. “Uh, hazelnut cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso?” He says, glancing questioningly between Dean and Missy.
Castiel nods and Dean watches the man’s throat flex as he swallows hard. His eyes scream with the amount of pain he is suffering and Dean’s heart twinges in sympathy.
“Dean, that’s horrible!” Cas has heard of such gays, treating bisexual men like they were somehow less. The discrimination that runs rampant in the Queer community frustrates him to no end. One would think that they would be more accepting because of the collective challenges they face, but the same problems always persist no matter how much progress is made.
Cas smiles fondly, graciously allowing Dean to fall apart and put himself back together as the sky grows ever darker overhead. “Did you think he wouldn’t?”
Once inside, with the door quietly closed, Cas nudges Dean toward the bed and presses him down gently with a firm hand to the center of the hunter’s chest.
Cas also explains that he works for himself, owning his small firm, so he gives himself Mondays off.
“Dammit, Cas. Gotta get you a bell or something.” Dean tries to play off his near panic attack as surprise but the cogs in his mind are whirling, desperately hoping that Cas didn’t notice that Dean wasn’t actually
“I..” Cas starts but bites at his lower lip. “I called someone earlier, explained that we’ve never been but are interested” He continues slowly, cautiously.
Cas must be able to tell by Dean’s tone because his fingers quickly disappear from Dean’s hair and find Dean’s hand instead. He laces their fingers together and gives a squeeze.
His toes twitch and he winces, biting back his apology when Cas shifts. If Dean weren’t so hyper-focused, he probably wouldn’t have noticed the minute roll of Castiel’s ankle that probably signifies a curl of his toes.
Dean startles as he turns, swallowing hard when his gaze lands on the monk. “Balthazar. I did not know you were there.”
Dean leaves a kiss in Cas’ hair. “You’re not a mess. This is new for both of us. We’ll figure it out.”
“Hey, Cas?” Dean says, breaking the careful silence and causing the man across from him to lay his pen down and lift those soul-searching blue eyes to meet Dean’s hesitant gaze.
Balthazar thinks he’s a bit dramatic, but how can no one else see the crime behind that grinning barista who greets him at the counter? Her only saving grace is being an amenable gatekeeper to the closest thing to divinity that exists on this plane of existence.
“Good to see someone’s finally made an honest man outta you, boy” Rufus’ grumpy façade finally cracks to reveal a soft smile and Cas lets out a relieved breath. “He the reason you ain’t come around to see me in years?” He arches an accusing brow even as he holds his hand toward Dean.
His heart stutters when he considers the recent memory of seeing that man with long braided hair nock his arrow and aim. In the moment it took him and Gabriel to follow the man’s sight straight to Dean, Cas began to react without thought.
“Thanks for coming up here with me,” he says instead, turning his head so that he can meet Cas’s gaze. In the dim light, the blue of his eyes is lost but the soft smile Castiel wears is easily seen.
Cas takes the opportunity to sling a leg over Dean’s hips to straddle the man, effectively sitting in his lap. “In all my millennia of existence, the thought of disobeying my father never crossed my mind. Angels aren’t built for free will, Dean” Castiel continues licking and sucking gently around the pulse point of Dean’s throat. “But the moment my grace touched your soul in the darkest pits of Hell, something came alive in me” He drags his teeth over Dean’s collarbone and is pleased to feel Dean shudder beneath him.
Dean huffs something resembling a bitter laugh. “I almost did, on accident.” Dean is quick to assure. “I thought you were a deer.”
With his chin forced higher, he takes a deep breath and nods to himself. He can do this just a little bit longer. Until he can find something else that pays halfway decently.
want to visit? “Lets, uh, just throw our bags in the rooms and we can go” Dean’s glances between his brother and his Angel, distracted with the gymnastics his mind is trying to complete trying to puzzle out what Cas is up to.
Dean shakes his head with a sigh before nodding. He still refuses to meet Cas’ gaze as he reaches forward to snatch a twig off the ground in front of him. His nimble fingers twist and break the frail piece of wood into ever smaller pieces. “I’m bad, Cas. Bad for you. You don’t want me.”
“Yes, Dean” Cas assures and leans closer to whisper. “I appreciate you being such a good boy for me, I want to reward you”
Castiel watches in fascination as Dean hurriedly drags his pants up despite the mess leaking from his ass, he’d be lying if he didn’t find the knowledge of Dean carrying his scent to be somewhat satisfying. Dean is
“Dammit, Sam!” Dean yells, getting in his brother’s face. His heart hammers in his chest and the edges of his vision darken with rage even as panic begins to set in. Cas is out there, unprotected. They need to hurry.
“Look, we all know that Cassie was hurt by Azazel’s brother. I have my suspicions about what happened but Cas won’t talk about it. We protect our own, you understand?” Balthazar frowns as he regards Dean carefully.
Cas drums his fingers against Dean’s belly and hums in thought. “And what would you have me do?” He’s curious to know what makes Dean tick, how far he’ll go to stand up for his principles.
Dean squares his shoulders and takes a deep breath, preparing himself for what may become the most difficult aspect of this entire raid. He has no choice if he is to be seen worthy in the eyes of his Jarl and his people.
Cas wakes before his alarm, the emotional weight of last night causing his heart to flutter happily as he watches the dappled rays of dawn’s light Dean’s features just enough to make out his golden lashes and the smattering of faint freckles that spread over the bridge his nose and across his cheeks.
Dean swings with his ax but he’s been forced to hold the weapon in his clumsy left hand and his swing barely cuts into Azazel’s side.
“Gross,” Charlie pretends to gag just as Benny ushers them toward the waiting car with a grumble about cameras in the distance.
Dean busies himself fixing the last of the dinner Mary had started. The chicken is done, keeping warm in the turned-off oven as he spoons the mashed potatoes into a serving bowl that he tucks under the heat vent. A bag of frozen peas is sitting on the counter, so Dean heats those too and adds a spoonful of soft butter when the microwave signals that they’re finished.
Dean’s body goes where Cas puts him and his stomach swoops with pure pleasure as Cas grips his shoulder and moves his thumbs is tight circles that dig harshly into his sore muscles. “Gods, Cas. Don’t stop,” Dean moans and his eyes flutter closed.
“Lilith. Ruby. Listen,” Cas says in a whisper as he grips Benny’s forearm and leads him to the corner of the building.
“I thought he was into it. He kissed back and pulled me closer. It was, fuck, it was the best kiss of my life and then the next thing I know, he’s shoving me back and scrambling to get away.” Dean lets out a shaky breath and drops his head into his hands.
Together, they walk arm and arm to the alley where they split up. Cas continues on alone, weaving through the narrow streets toward his usual place about half a block past a gay bar.
Cas huffs his amusement and leans forward to look. The picture of him and Dean staring at each other with adoring smiles and nothing but love shining in their eyes is enough to give anyone a toothache. “Send it to me?”
The near-feral look in Dean’s eyes when he had confronted Alastair had proven to Cas that Dean is capable of terrible things. He had never witnessed such horror as Dean had committed when he swung that ax.
Dean wanders onward, eyes wide and disbelieving. Benny and the others follow close behind. “We need,” Dean says through a heaving breath. “We need to go. Now.”
Dean smirks. “The sex ain’t half bad either” He quips as he brushes down Castiel’s length with a single finger. Cas gasps at the sensation, hips bucking into Dean’s too gentle touch.
Dean watches Cas with a fondness that borders on painful. His heart clenches and his stomach is alight with a fluttering swarm of butterflies but Cas seems oblivious to Dean’s plight.
“I,” he starts, “I’m sorry. I was scared, I wasn’t thinking,” Cas stammers but Dean doesn’t understand his words and Cas growls in frustration. “You confound me, Dean of Winchester.” Cas finally looks up and Dean’s heart stutters when he notices a single tear rolls down Cas’ dirty cheek.
“I challenge you in single combat, Asmodeus. You are not the rightful leader of our people and I will not stand by while you steal the Jarldom,” Dean says flatly, loud enough for all to hear.
Sam tried. He had begged him to go too, with tears streaming down his reddened cheeks before he wiped his snotty nose on his shirt sleeve.
Cas’ head tilts and Dean’s brows furrow. “Years?” Dean asks, stunned that what they have is unusual.
Cas nods as he settles back and flexes his fingers as Dean reaches out to bind his wrists to the slat of the headboard.
“No. You taking another vessel would just be weird. It would be too close to taking advantage of someone, they’d be in there somewhere and I’d be....no. Just no” Dean reasons, voice edging on alarm the more he thinks about the idea. And yeah, anything with Sam is out of the question” He scrunches his face and shakes his head. “We can try an aphrodisiac if you want. Any idea of any that might actually affect you?”
Cas grits his teeth and struggles to stay still as a litany of beautiful filth pours from Dean’s lips, his motions turning from fluid to jerky as he drives them toward their climax. “So close, Dean, I can’t…”
“He and Lilith…” Cas starts but trails off when he doesn’t know the right words to explain their copulation.
“I could touch you like this for hours, years even, and never tire of being near you,” Cas says and Dean struggles to hold in his desired retort.
“Everything ok, Dean?” Castiel returns, seating himself next to Dean and wrapping an arm around his shoulders as he hands off the bottle of water.
“That’s,” Mary starts but pauses. “Oh hell, I need to ask.” Mary squares her shoulders and John opens his mouth to protest. “No, John, I can’t pretend everything is okay.”
Dean turns and clenches his jaw. “Cas, come. NOW,” Dean says, his words a clear order that has Cas’ feet moving slowly despite his internal protest.
Megan nods, her smile a little starstruck. By now, several other people have moved closer, noticing who is at the center of the commotion.
He wants to run. This is why he does his best to avoid Cas. Those blue eyes, that stare, the firm jaw. He’s nearly ethereal, the way he stares and for a moment Dean begins to doubt his assessment of his neighbor.
Cas dips to kiss along Dean’s neck as his fingers drift to the front of Dean’s jeans. “Stop talking,” he mutters before recapturing Dean’s lips with a demanding moan. There are so many things to be uncertain of but turning men into putty with his body is one thing he knows well.
“So, we’re officially throwing in our lot with these savages,” Balthazar says but any heat his words may have carried is lost to his wide smile.
Castiel looks down with a furrowed brow, taking a moment to read what he can of the sign as Michael shifts uncomfortably. “Homosexuality is an abomination to...” He looks up with a smirk. “Really?”
“I’d rather do this outside, more room and all.” He gestures vaguely at the back seat of his car. Cas knows from experience how cramped it can be. Cadillacs weren’t made for two large men to move around in the back seat.
Dean smirks as the car rolls inside and the heavy wooden door lowers behind them. “Told ya I didn’t live in some weird-ass mansion.”
She’s right and he knows it. Without insurance, or hell, even with insurance, there isn’t much a hospital can do at this point. A year ago, the doctor at the clinic told them eight months, best case scenario.
Cas follows and drops into the chair next to Sam’s when Dean goes back inside to get the steaks ready.
Dean nods with a frown. “This will be dangerous. I would understand if you decide you don’t want to…” Dean trails off as he scans the face of each monk gathered around him.
righteous man. Do you think I would lie to you about how much I love you? About how wonderful I think you are?” Cas narrows his eyes and Dean’s resolve wilts. Cas gravel rough tone is deep and unmovable.
“Sarah. I’m Dean” He nods towards her and she returns her attention to her Dom. Dean stares, confused as to why she suddenly gave up their conversation. “Anyways, I was just talking to Sarah about the club”
Dean feels Cas’ hurt look like a punch to the stomach and he can’t understand why Cas’ smile would turn to something that looks a little too much like shame. “Okay,” He says with a shrug as he hands the phone back. “Guess you’re just not one to fall into the same popularity trap as the rest of us.”
Michael shrugs. “Father sent a good portion of the congregation to protest this event. He feels that the University is pandering to you, specifically, you can imagine his outrage.” His little smirk is telling even if he is staring down at the sign with a wrinkled nose. “Luke is around here somewhere.”
Meg’s grin widens and Cas steps forward to grabs Dean’s arm and drag him from the apartment. “Oh, the stories I could tell you…”
Dean nuzzles into his pillow as he considers. “I dunno. That’s like being tied up and hung from the ceiling or some shit, right?”
“Hmmm. You’re right” Cas leans forward to press kisses to the heated flesh of Dean’s ass. “I adore you, Dean. Is that not enough to convince you of your worth?” Cas questions between soothing kisses as he flushes small amounts his grace into Dean’s abused flesh, only enough to lessen the sting. He knows how highly Dean values him, he can sense Dean’s devotion through his very soul. “Is it so hard to believe that I love you?” Cas whispers, nearly ready to pray that Dean will believe him.
He’s already dreading returning to the hotel tonight with Sam and leaving Cas behind here. He doesn’t want to let the man out of his sight for even a minute.
Dean presses deeper, the dry push a strange sensation as Cas’ muscles tense around him. Suddenly, the motion becomes easier, the way slicked by something… “Cas?” Dean questions, his hand stilling inside his Angel.
Castiel has made him self scarce ALL day and Dean is beginning to go stir crazy waiting to see what he has planned. Cas promised him cowboy boots and Dr. Sexy so he almost doesn't care what Castiel wants to do with him. Just as long as his Angel is wearing those boots.
“Hello, Sam,” Cas says with a smile, not realizing in the slightest the budding tension in the family.
The weather is a little warm for the tattered leather, but it’s comfortable and he can trick himself into feeling invisible when he hunches his shoulders and hurries onward.
“Attention!” Dean barks, silencing the gathered crowd once Ruby and Lilith are shoved to their knees in front of the Jarl’s great chair. Dean takes a half step forward as he calls for the trial to begin and his heart races in excitement.
Cas huffs to himself as Dean strides across the room to open for Benny. He busies his hands by straightening his robe and making sure he’s covered while he waits for Benny to chew him a new one for being so stupid.
“Come on Char, Cas is a big boy, he’s got this.” Benny touches Charlie's elbow and nudges her away. “Be right back, Chief.” Benny gives him a firm nod before leading Charlie away to do whatever it is she’s supposed to be doing while the band wraps up on stage.
“Shit shit shit.” He spins with wide eyes, gaze landing on the loaf of fancy Italian bread that somehow got too close to the burner and is on
Cas struggles not to pull away from the gentle touch as his stomach squirms uncomfortably while he stares into the deep green of Dean’s eyes.
Dean hums and smacks his lips together when he pulls back. “Have fun with the rugrats,” he says with a fond smile.
Dean nods and stretches his arms over his head with a groaning yawn. “Think about coming with me?” He mumbles through his yawn before meeting Cas’ eyes sleepily.
“Shit,” Dean mutters as he touches the button to answer the call. “Hey Cas,” he says brightly, pretending that his cheeks aren’t burning.
Cas chews his lips and eyes the bed cautiously as his feet remain planted on the floor. He thought Dean understood when he said slow, but perhaps he had chosen the wrong word after all. He looks at Dean and then to his next of furs on the floor, trying to decide.
With one last look in the mirror, he pulls in a deep breath through his nose and nods once with determination.
From a mischievous tormentor one minute to soft cuddle bug the next, and Cas finds that he loves both almost equally.
Perhaps he should forgo the blockers. Just once to see Dean’s reaction and discover if Dean could feel for him what he feels for the man bent against his desk.
