“You might want to lie back a little longer.” The voice suggests. “Alprazolam in great quantities can give one a massive headache.”
"I will burn you!" Sherlock snarls harshly, hauling Moriarty up. With a shout, he shoves him at the fireplace. He wants him to burn to dust. He wants him to disappear. He wants him gone.
.” Sherlock interjected, quickly swiping it from her hand before he realized Billy could see it, but he just laughed.
While he waited, he planned, as Sherlock was prone to do. He had thirteen scenarios planned for the moment John walked through that door, and was working on three more when, lo and behold, the good Doctor himself entered the flat, or staggered in, rather.
"There will never be anyone else. No one before you, and so will it be after." He said quietly and he felt John chuckle against his ear.
That first week afterwards he would stumble out of bed and vomit into the sink, images of Sherlock's bloodied face burning in his mind. The first few days afterwards he hadn't made it to the sink.
"Do you remember how I looked when you found me?" Sherlock asks quietly, turning his eyes to Lestrade. "Did I look like that? That clean? That well-kept?"
"I was shaking then, not enough for me to notice, but I was. I had a panic attack. Thought you were leaving me or that you were working with Mary of all people or…well, I don't know what I thought. It was so sudden—took me off-guard—and I didn't even start to consider
"The desert." He answers solemnly. In the dim light, quietly hidden in the shadows of their booth, the blackness in his veins is muted, less noticeable.
"They were aiming to kill. You had to adapt to a new circumstances and you did marvellously well under pressure." Sherlock leaned forward, trying to get John to look at him. "I don't blame you, John, for acting as you did. If you hadn't, we'd all be dead and they would have carted you off somewhere and done god-knows-what to you."
“Sherlock,” Lestrade sounds harried, out of breath. “There’s been another one. We sweated an address out of him this morning. Forensics just got here.”
close to sending you back home. I'll do it too. One little snap and poof, you're back with your thoughts and that weird sex witch for company—"
He stared at the window where nothing moved behind it. Stared at it until he felt Mycroft gently pull him back.
He had fallen asleep in John's arms, sated and happy but fearing that he had become rather spoiled now and knowing that he'd never fall asleep again if John wasn't there. He just knew.
He wondered how many things he could delete before striking out his soul entirely. First patience, then sympathy, then politeness, then kindness… (Fa1 then Fa2 then Fa3, etc. until the conditional is negated).
"It's so hard, Sherlock—for me." He begins softly. "You have to understand that. Something needs to click in that brain of yours so you understand." He pauses, trying to verbalise what's he's thinking. "It's hard for me, because you're here, you're
Moran was knocked back onto the floor in a spray of blood and John willed all of his energy to look up. The chain of the cuffs was weakening under his weight. His left shoulder burned horribly, a deep, hot pain burning where that bullet once did. He'd have to find a way to get down before Moran got back up or his shoulder gave out.
He looked. There, in the yard, just beyond the stairs and sloping down towards the road, was a stag. It sniffed at the lawn, heart pounding dully, monotonously, as it scrounged for its dinner. He could hear the blood pass through it, running to the tips of its ears, its legs, its belly. It was a strong animal, compact and lean. It would do.
So he did. He didn't tell them, but he did, going into the room quietly at two in the morning for a routine check-up and coming out of the room at two-thirty with the news. He had expected grief or tears or even suspicion, but all he saw was relief. They both, he and this family, wanted the same thing, and now they had it.
Two men behind him, two tables to the right, talking in rapid Bosnian about something that was probably as mundane as bills but sounded to John like Tchaikovsky madly plucking the strings of a ponder, dark, exciting and foreign and melodic as all languages seem to a non-speaker.
The man I’d left behind, buried in the salt, he might have said that once. Might not have even hesitated. Probably wouldn’t have. But he’s gone, and I am here.
She bustles around the room for a moment before disappearing back downstairs, saying her offer of tea still stands and to get it before its cold. At the bottom of the stairs she yells up something about being careful when going into John's room, but he doesn't hear her.
John had stepped forward then, raising a gloved hand to wipe a droplet of blood from the corner of Sherlock’s mouth. He’d watched as John drew it to his own and sucked it off his thumb, fangs just visible in the moonlight filtering in through the canopy. Although he had just eaten, he hungered.
John swipes his card and opens the door. The room is still, save for the castle of Prague looming in the window, outlined in the soft glow of darkening evening. Mycroft’s compensation for a job well done was recuperation in a five star spa that neither of them wanted. Some stains were stuck in the skin so deep that warm baths couldn’t wash it out.
“Why did you leave so quickly?” She asks, then upon seeing his face she adds: “I mean, you don’t have to tell me, I was just curious…sorry.”
"I knew it was you." Sherlock said. "In that church in Bruges. I knew it was you as soon as you spoke, I knew by your voice, by your silence, by your footsteps. I knew."
"Nachash envies that. He despises that he can only feel hate, that he doesn't even have the memory of loving anything but constant forces telling him it was so. He hates that he once loved and now has nothing but bile in his bones. He took John from you because John was what he could never be. He wants you to suffer as he does, and you cannot allow that. You
"Common sense, sir. The only way to look around these arches is to lean over the fence," He indicated the iron fence beside them, "So you wouldn't know if someone was on either side, listening, which they must be since you're a criminal and all, and so you must be wanted for something somewhere—"
But he smiles. Bitterly, like tasting lemons or seeing someone that you don't particularly care for but knowing you have to be polite.
for you to forget me, John, if it meant you would be happy. But you didn't. And you also didn't shoot Mikheia after he helped you. That tells me all I need to know concerning your worth. You are everything, John. Everything. Now that you're here, now that you're right in front of me, I don't ever want to see you away ever again."
"Yes." John replies, his eyes shutting as steam whistles from the kettle. "I thought it was something else. Something I didn't want to come anywhere near you."
“Better that I aspire to something that I might have than try and get back in the good graces of those whose faces I’ve spit in—”
John didn’t say anything as he stepped forward. They never did when they came back together. He held out his hands, open, but not reaching, and Sherlock met him in the middle, staring down at him as he took John’s gloved hands in his own. Their height difference never really bothered him, although at times he did wish he were a little taller, if not to be so imposed upon all the time by the stupid git he called his husband. When he
Mycroft feels exposed. He doesn't like it. Soft tenderness is left to the elements when there should be iron.
“Good.” Lestrade nods. “That’s good. I wasn’t cherishing the idea of chucking you out, to be honest. Now get a donut and some coffee or something. Sergeant Donovan is bringing in that biker you tried to chase down for questioning, and you look like hell thawed.”
Sherlock could only stare at the bodies, at the thick blood oozing from their faces, pulpy with bits of brains and skull, red pooling beneath them.
“Hell, Mr Holmes,” The man says, dark against the light as he leans forward, “is what we make of our situations.”
"Nn—I don't have a heart. I just—just have a soul. But whatever it is, whatever I have…it's yours. It's yours, Sherlock."
Her brother sits across from her. He looks so much older, so much more tired. He made it through his fire, but only barely. He was still burned, still hurting, still raw. She tried to help him. She would never stop trying to help him.
Sherlock stares into nothingness for a moment, his mind whirring. He stands, shadow cast large and looming on the wall.
"We are, aren't we? Nothing's been the same since." He exhaled a stream of smoke and stubbed the cigarette out. "Nothing will ever be the same. But I'll manage. You too, I'm betting."
Sherlock didn’t answer and John sighed, rolling his eyes and looking heavenward as if some divine intervention might ever stop the Holmes brothers from meddling in other people’s affairs.
Sherlock scowled at her, flyaway hair curling madly from the humidity coming from the canal as it cooled in the night.
John swipes his card and opens the door. The room is still, save for the castle of Prague looming in the window, outlined in the soft glow of darkening evening. Mycroft’s compensation for a job well done was recuperation in a five star spa that neither of them wanted. Some stains were stuck in the skin so deep that warm baths couldn’t wash it out.
"Murderers?" John shook his head in disbelief. "You must not be from around here. We don't have murderers, or vigilantes, much less ones named Sherlock."
“Did you know he used his shoes as a garrotte? Quite impressive, really. My friend never saw it coming until he’d fallen off the roof of that church you two were hiding in.”
“I.O.U?” Mikheia frowns as he reads. He looks suspiciously at Sasha. “You didn’t tell me you could write.”
"A diary?" She asks, turning to Rachel's father, sitting on the bed clutching at one of his daughter's pillows.
“Really? Your sister might have some qualms with that, and your father too. You are his only son after all and, let’s face it, your sister was never much of a prize, was she? You’re the golden boy, apple of Mummy’s eye—well, while she was alive…top percentile in your class at Bart’s, a decorated army Captain, now a confirmed bachelor with and a bad leg and a flighty, unreliable flatmate. Quite the life, eh?”
Sherlock glances to him, then to the spot of light on the wall, to the point in the corner of his eye that he could see and didn’t want to face. The gyroscope can still spin if he can’t see it.
Sherlock finds himself unable to fill the space of silence with the proper verbose necessary for this conversation. Should he offer congratulations? Condolences?
"You can't hurt me, Sherlock Holmes." Emma says, her voice unwavering, steady with the confidence of faith. "You can kill me if you like, but you'll never
"Please use what meagre intellect you have and save me the trouble of correcting you because, really, it does get quite tedious. She was a
John is trapped in a corner, between the wall and the hands of a man he has no desire to hurt and the need to be safe.
"Too late. I already took it from you. It's like a disease and you've been innoculated. Absolved, even. You can't get it again. I either pass it on or let it burn me from the inside out and there's nothing you can do but watch. You should've known better than to let me in since this is was it will lead to."
In turn, John felt the same. A frizzle of electricity jolted him, and he welcomed Sherlock in, overcome by his nature, the intelligence, the brilliance, the clever determination that stripped the locks he had placed around him for centuries in an instant. It all happened in one moment, the kiss of deference to an offered hand, but it had been all they needed.
"Should I be rethinking my conclusions on your death fetish?" John asked, his voice teasing but with a black current underneath. Sherlock waited for him to answer and he sighed. "It didn't feel like anything, I suppose, when you get down to it. Whenever I have my finger on the trigger, I let whatever part of me that I can manage split apart and duck behind whatever shrapnel cover it can find. Then I went back and salvaged it later, trying to put everything back like I found it when I was alone. Or if Mary was there."
“Mrs Hudson doesn’t know I’m here. I came straight to you, after I…I can leave as quickly as I came.”
"Have you ever been surprised, Doctor Watson? I imagine there are quite a few things you could come to believe if you broadened your horizons."
He shrugs, and John sighs, rubbing at his temples. “Well, the point is that I started to look at the corresponding news stories of the places I’d thought you were likely to be in. Places where Moriarty might have thought it was important to have people there.”
thinking about it. He was in a constant staring contest with that damn door, and he always lost, always ceded defeat and turned away to pretend he wasn't thinking of it anymore.
John nearly rolled his eyes. He hadn’t expected dramatics this soon—typically it was two to three glasses in. But, now that he thought about it, her supply had been rather exceptional, made him feel warmer, more pliant. She had picked it smartly; she’d wanted him relaxed and open to questions. Heaven only knows what Sherlock’s reaction was. He’d be in the oubliettes by dawn if he got into the vintage.
"No, you drew attention to a man in a basement flat with John's name scrambled in his own. You did not tell me where John was."
In a moment, the fool had John by the throat, hoisting him off his feet. Sherlock hissed, moving to rip his arms off. Rip off his head. Protect his mate—
He can feel Irene freeze behind him, only for a moment, before she disguises it by moving around him to the sink.
"And I will as well," John replied back. "Now," he said, standing and dragging his mate up with him. "I think we've got ourselves a monster to catch."
He knelt beside him as John tried to grasp the straps of something Sherlock should have noticed before.
"Unacceptable." Sherlock said calmly. "I'm not leaving you again. The only way you're carting me out of here is if I'm a corpse."
There is a storm over London, just as there is seemingly every night lately. Rain is no stranger here, but it's becoming a familiar friend that invites itself over one time too many.
“No problem, Sherlock, really.” Billy smiled, rubbing the back of his head. He could tell he made the boy nervous, but that was how he liked it. Nervous didn’t ask questions. “Is there anything else I can get you? Anything you might need?”
He did his job. That much could have been said of him. He’d done it. For who exactly, he couldn’t say. He didn’t know anymore, to be honest. For him, no, it hadn’t been for him. He hadn’t gained anything, except a few more secure days in Tokyo…a few days that meant nothing. He’d still have to run, in the end. He always ran, in the end. He didn’t do it for Kita—why on earth would he do it for her?—and for John…everything was for John, everything was for them, for both of them, for who they’d been, and perhaps who they might be, but nothing was just for one cause. He was a prism, and the light shone through, flashing in all directions, refracting off of himself until he was in darkness. Is the prism aware that it exists for light, or does light exist for the prism? He isn’t sure…he isn’t sure he’s ever been sure.
"I took a sample." Sherlock admitted shamelessly. "I found bone and calcium residue. The line of grey beneath the S16? That's human ash."
“I think I’ll ask you again.” Sherlock said to the empty kitchen, his voice slow and slurred. “We’re about overdue for another, don’t you think? You better get up, John, or I won’t ever know...and you're not that cruel. You better get up, John.”
“Fair point.” Mortimer shrugs, tossing the handtowel over his shoulder before he heads into his darkened foyer. “Are you coming?” He calls from the darkness.
Moran stepped into the sunlight, his clothes trailing flour in the wind like dust. In the blur of movement John could see Sherlock's dark hair framing his pale face, all colour draining from it as Moran stopped in front of him.
But what if? What if he was still out there? Sherlock had not sacrificed three years of his life, three years of John's life and the fact that it didn't include him in it, for Moriarty to have lived.
?"—into biting anger directed towards John, so John had responded by shutting Sherlock's laptop and giving him, what was in John's opinion, spectacular head. After that, Sherlock had taken to using sex, as they usually did, to alleviate boredom or stress or frustration. John had lost count of how many times they'd fucked since they arrived, to be perfectly honest, and he doubted they'd left any surface that hadn't been christened. The bed in the lounge, the table, the elevator (when Sherlock had been spectacularly lazy and took it to the third floor to the archive room before making John carry the stack of papers down and rewarding him with a slow fuck against the wall), the kitchen counter after they'd attempted to make pie one night, three separate showers, five different beds (whichever room was closest when the mood struck), and, on one memorable occasion, the grand staircase. John would be lying if he said he didn't enjoy the fact that they were unutterably alone in all this, that he could be as loud as he wanted or as slow or hard and
He brought the last handful of blood between them, allowing John to have his fill, expecting him to finish it off entirely; his wounds were worse, he required more. John drank some, then covered Sherlock’s hand with his own, pushing it back towards him.
"John is not a tablecloth pawn to you. He is not someone that you would use then toss away. How are you going to get the information you require out of him?"
"If he was as valuable as you claim, what were you waiting for? An engraved invitation to raid the place? My brother's permission? But you wouldn't care for that. Mycroft is just a walrus in a suit to you."
He didn’t rise to the bait. “Your concern is heartwarming, as ever. John has responded well after he destroyed your latest gambit for my affections.”
“Wrong." Sherlock replies evenly. "Watcher and Detective Inspector. You never mentioned seeing John to me. “Why?”
“A girl can only go so far in heels.” She answers with an arched eyebrow. She’s herself today, or whichever form the one that rose from the bathtub is, dressed in a tight dawn blue dress with a cream overcoat gilded with gold lining and sporting large, dark sunglasses and thigh high black boots.
The flat is oddly quiet. John must be waiting in their room, formerly his room, though he was keen to share.
“But alas,” The man says, turning to where the light was shining, “your friend damaged my friend. What might we do about that?”
“You don’t think that…surely, Sherlock doesn’t wind his hand around your spine and feed you his clever little words—”
Harry gestures, as if that answers it. “Humanity is bright, Sherlock. It’s hard to look the sun in the face when it stares back at you. So we get our fill when we can, and then we look away and keep what we saw as long as we can.”
I will be meeting with one Sheriff Gregory Lestrade—should be easy to remember—at the local hospital to interview this magical missing girl, one Ronette Pulaski. Names these days. Afterwards, I will look for accommodations in town, preferably ones with internet access and an adequate notion of cleanliness.
“In another age, when your race was younger, they came up with stories. Stories about witches and magic and mythical creatures never heard of to terrify and enthral their children. Let’s just say these stories had to come from somewhere, there had to be some truth in them. There were tales of gods turning themselves into animals from the people you call Romans, just as the Germans devoured stories of women with tails for legs and siren’s songs as hungrily as the Finnish and Dutch did. And you English, you so love wolves and bears and vicious and bloody things, don’t you? These stories are not all…inherently false. People do love fairytales. They love things that are darker than they are. Makes them feel better.”
Dying of heartbreak is improbable, but not impossible. He’s looked into it. It’s colloquially called the Widow’s Illness (from what John mentioned once at least). Acute stress cardiomyopathy, the classic symptoms of cardiac arrest, only it’s psychological, not physiological; you can be legally dead of a heart attack and your heart is still working as fine as it ever did. John had tried explaining to Sherlock how devastating losing the one you loved most was, but neither really knew what that meant, how it felt, and now Sherlock was left to experience it alone.
Sherlock was back outside of St. Bart's, as alive and well as he ever was, his eyes scanning the street for any sign of his doctor, any sign of John, when he finally saw him. After three years of wondering if he was forgetting what John looked like (because the camera's image was often grainy), of what John smelled like (because obviously cameras didn't have olfactory sensors), of what John's smile or his frown or his laugh were like (he would like to have a nice chat with Mycroft one day on the quality of his surveillance cameras), he spotted John in the crowd.
“And so was Jim. But John,” Moran shakes his head. “There’s a Queen-and-Country fellow through and through. Can’t tell if you’re the Queen or Country, though.”
Sherlock saw a shirtless man dressed in women's slacks running with his back to him and took a moment to process it. Must be the escaped prisoner he and Mikheia had heard about. He had hair like John's…similar body type too, but it was too muscular to be
The shadows grew longer, darker, oil lamps and candles running lower and lower the farther back he went, until finally he caught a glimpse of a familiar grey gaze, settling hazily onto him.
John does not respond, but his warm hands, calmly stilled over Sherlock's lean sides, make him continue.
John seemed to understand and reached down, hauling him back from under his arms as he dragged the two of them back into the house. He laid Sherlock out on the linoleum, and he felt cold, thickened blood seep into his hair. Turning his head, he touched his tongue to the floor. It was delicious, dignity be damned.
John shut his eyes, closing out the angry, trembling Sherlock, before opening them again to a Sherlock with his back to him, running a hand through his hair.
John smiled at him and let Sherlock kiss him with a warmth that felt like the rising sun that shone on them.
Sherlock ripped John's shirt off, sending it the floor with a wet squelch, exposing a chest coated in fresh blood that flowed over wounds and around congealed, sticky globs of previously shed blood that hadn't been cleaned off. Mikheia ran in, the bowl in his hands steaming in the dark room. The blood soaking into the floor shone black in the golden light coming in from the hallway.
John rests his head on Sherlock’s shoulder and leans into him. He recognises that Sherlock is trying to make amends, and he appreciates it.
“You think I’m like Jim. You think every clue has to mean something. I’m not so indulgent as he was. He was obsessed with making you puzzles and watching you work through the intricacies. In a way, my work is…a loving parody. Jim overthought everything, tailored every detail and riddle to your liking. I don’t plan like he did. I don’t think things through.”
Sherlock didn’t answer; a fine trickle of dust fell from the crumbled brick where John had broken it.
"All the fucking shagging you lot have been up to." He said, laughing as he picked up a tulumbe and bit into it, spitting it back out onto the floor before he could chew. "Marathon sessions, from what I can tell since you've rarely left the hotel." Moran tossed the pastry to the floor and looked up at him, cocking an eyebrow. "Honestly, don't you have anything else to do?"
He starts to laugh. A stream of giggles that runs into full blown gut-clenching laughter, complete with his eyes tearing up.
“Not sure.” Harry hummed. “I don’t suppose there’s much to do but catch up with you and Dracula over there. The three of us, together again.”
“Sh—Sherlock? Is that you?” He squints, a wry tired smile coming to his face. “You look like shite.”
, Detective Inspector. I don't want to kill him." Moran tilts his head and a knowing smile comes on his face. "I just want to
Someone answers him, and Lestrade watches as Sherlock’s face drains of colour, all his defences singularly knocked down in one blow. His grip tightens around the phone as if it were a lifeline thrown to a drowning man. Mycroft has already come to attention, straightening in the edge of Lestrade’s line of sight. Sherlock looks like he might be sick.
." Sherlock murmured, placing an open-mouthed kiss on it. "If anything it highlights your features, your lovely bone structure, instead of detracting from it—"
“I think it will always be there in some capacity. I can’t forget it. Not really…” He sighed, his voice shaking when he spoke next. “I don’t want to feel like this.”
"You, John Watson? You? The man for whom I spent three years setting up your fall? No. No, there is no chance I'm digging my claws out of you."
Mikheia had heard that voice say that phrase only once before, when his father told him to run close to the walls and not look back, no matter what sounds he heard, no matter how much he cried. It ended with a sudden spray of his father's blood onto the dirty slush of the sidewalk, ended with Mikheia knowing in his five year old heart that his father would never laugh again, never smile or joke or hug him, and that he was alone, all alone, and thus the son christened into this world with the blood of the father.
“People who deserved it, people who he agreed to kill. And he was a willing participant. He signed his own name where it was required. He was also, if you remember, a soldier. He killed people before you, so I must ask is it so shocking that he did so after?”
John had never told him what’d he seen in the camps or what he'd witnessed as a prisoner of war, and he didn’t have to. But he wasn’t quite the same after that; the light didn’t reach his eyes when he smiled, and Sherlock thought it the greatest of ironies, that after all the atrocity they had lived through, of all the human violence and cruelty, not to mention their own kind’s, it had been this that would break him, the actions of soldiers following orders, atrocities flying under the banner of scientific inquiry. They knew that what John had seen, what had happened, was irrevocable, and nothing would be quite as it was before.
Carefully, he raised the glass to his lips. John was near the entrance, speaking with two women and a man, all of whom had a clear investment in making him their next sexual conquest. Boring. The other revelers were gathered in clusters in the usual places—the closest servant’s tray, the musicians, supplicating themselves in front of the guest of honour. Some were leaning over the railings below deck, heads and knotted ties of their masks visible as they cheered on the race sailing by. Others were applauding the comedy troupe's performance as the actors bowed once, twice, then dissolved into the crowd.
He lifted the stone as if it were no heavier than a pillow, propping it against the side. He leaned forward to stare down into the darkness, but a hand at his neck made him pause. John was worried.
“Eavesdropping, John? For shame.” Sherlock chided, noting the red tinge that flushed to John’s ears.
"Not that this isn't touching—" Mortimer says from behind them. "And trust me, it's a nice gesture and all, and I know I'm ruining a golden moment, but did I just fucking hear you say you're using an
"Why didn't you tell me?" Sherlock's voice came quietly, an inquiring whisper proving he'd been awake and listening.
Artemisia said nothing at breakfast, taken in the closed garden parlor on the veranda, the faint purple of the sun blending into the dark horizon through the greenery and darkened glass panes of the transparent room.
Salt comes from death. And so do I. Wherever I go, death follows. Sometimes we are friends, and the right man dies at the right time and death is on my side. Sometimes it turns on me, and I’m left to bleed out quietly until I  manage to pick myself up, until I think of what would happen if I didn’t, I think of not seeing him again, and I stagger to the nearest hospital, or to whatever hovel I’m living in so I can stitch myself back together. It’s happened much too often lately. I’m too close to getting what I want. I’m getting sloppy, careless.
Someone’s wading in the water, slowly. Not as fast as he wants. He wants running, he wants hurried splashing—a frenzy—because it means there’s something to be done to save him. Save John. That’s all he wants, all he’s ever wanted.
The cab speeds off down the street as soon as they pay their fare, tyres screeching as it merges with the empty night that engulfs it.
He rubbed his thumb over the nape of John's neck and felt a shiver run through them both, a struck string that vibrated with potent motion. There was so much time, and yet so little of it. John wasn't to be treated as a pawn, and yet Moriarty was forcing them towards rash action by making his move so quickly. A vital rule of war: one never left a defended position unless they were capable of advancing safely. That only created opportunities for the enemy.
"A quest has one goal, though. I don't know if Sherlock wanted just one when he—when he left the first time."
When I come to, John is kneeling over me, brow furrowed. His lips are moving, but in the haze I don’t know what he’s saying. The lights are blurred above me.
Sherlock had never had the chance to touch him, to feel his chest rise and fall as they took their last breaths together, and that was the worst of it.
"No, I think I'll go in if that's alright with you—" Sherlock begins, brushing past Lestrade to get into the interrogation room, but the DI is faster than expected and grabs him none too gently by the wrist.
“You’ve never spent two days with me, love. Let’s go to dinner, get to know each other a little better.”
He goes into the parlour, littered with things that are all yelling John’s name at him. His mug that he hadn’t washed out yet, his medical books, his magazines and war novels, objects that speak loudly of their owner’s character. A meticulous nature, honed by time in the army yet frayed by a more peaceful civilian lifestyle. An interest in war, a clean curiosity until it was experience first-hand when one finds that there is no romanticism in the sound of gunfire or screams of the dying. It is this interest, however, that makes him hopeful. John has survived many things. In the best outcome of the situation, this will be one that he can add to his list. Sherlock doesn’t want to think of the worst.
"No...just me." Sherlock tried to smile, but he was too consumed with that slow heat, with fascination at this man beneath him, in him, this man that was saving him and didn't even know it.
“That day in the hotel…the day after.” He begins softly. “Someone tried to kill me, and was assassinated in the attempt.”
Someone is desperate. They want him alive. That’s nice. Someone cares if he dies. He’d like to be alive. That’d be nice. Really nice. He doesn’t know why. He doesn’t know if he wants to live for himself, or for someone else.
There was a refinement to it all. Whoever the voice was, however associated he was with Moran, he had a finesse that John hadn’t quite seen since Moriarty, and even then the madman was more often than not lost to his own devices and personal pursuits. This man had a clarity of purpose, and that frightened John the most.
He rounds a corner, into an alley barely wide enough for him, skinny as he is and as he’s become. John’s not around anymore to make him toast with the edges browned like he didn’t know he likes it, or crepes that stick to the ceiling.
"You are not here to offer me money." Mikheia concluded quietly. "You want my help, but you do not intend to pay me for it." His eyes turned dark. "You are threating me."
"You look like the Archangel of Death, Sherlock. The rest of us look relatively normal compared to you and your great bloody coat and cheekbones. Considering that cabbie didn't know you were the closest thing to normal in the backseat, I bet what he was really afraid of was
"Usually I find that our kind goes first." Moran said casually. "Those who like the thrill of fire always end up being consumed by it."
“Keep holding my arm at the elbow, but take my wrist with your free hand, yeah, like that, okay…now slowly pull my arm out, and not too hard or you’ll worsen it—
John was Atlas and the weight of the world had collapsed on him. He felt heavy, his chest felt full of lead, full of heartache and suffering and pain as the heavens crashed down on him and he buckled under its weight, unable to hold it up any longer. He tasted the salty dirt of grief, the iron of blood, the taste of pain and tears and suffering.
Dead, because the killer wanted to be heard. Because they knew how to hide evidence. Because they knew how to hide in plain sight, how to get a date with a man close to the one they wanted, how to laugh and smile and not feel anything at all.
thing I’ve ever seen, Sherlock Holmes. You shouldn't be so quick to discount yourself, to think that you don't matter, because you matter most. I did not endure an eternity of suffering to watch you do the same. I will
"Do you remember what I told you about werewolves?" Sherlock says. "I hope from now on you take me more seriously,
. He had persisted in initiating contact, if only to see where the boundaries lay; he tried in tiny apartments, in palazzos, forest dachas, in flat fields under the stars, and each time John had allowed it to progress, then suddenly stopped completely, each time more baffling than the next because Sherlock
"How can you be so sure?" Sherlock asked, narrowing his eyes in what was supposed to be a penetrating stare but ended up looking to Mikheia like he was just squinting into bright sunlight. "How can you know that it won't have a consequence, when everything you could possibly fathom has a conceivable consequence?"
"Hm." John made a sound in the back of his throat as he nipped and kissed and let his hands slide wherever they cared to.
Kita moves quickly, faster than he imagined she could—stupid—and he barely blocks her jab, forearm coming up to stop the blade an inch from his temple. He steps on her bare foot, heel digging into the thin skin, and uses his weight to his advantage, grabbing her other arm and pinning it behind her.
John blanched. "Right about what?" He turned to Sherlock, who had a slightly apologetic look on his face. "Sherlock, what the hell did you do now?"
"Just like that." Sherlock repeated softly, the cold dark metal back in his voice. "You shouldn't worry about going after him. I already plan to."
"Well I meant to get him in the head, then. Do good intentions count?" John asked with an unhappy grin.
"Sherlock, this is ridiculous, I'm not going to spend the rest of my life like bloody Rapunzel, afraid of my own shadow—"
When you last saw her she'll never see Rachel again Rachel Rachel Rachel her daughter her baby, everything's not alright. Rachel's gone she's gone but it all feels so far away something to deal with later when she can cry until there's nothing left—
to listen to John or Sherlock if he didn't want to, but he respected them too much to disagree. He knew quite well that they were smarter than him in the ways that either his youth or education had denied him. But he had felt so isolated, so trapped, before Sherlock had let him join his adventures, and now it was like he had looked away from the sun and everything was dark and he couldn't see anything as it used to be, only cast in shadows of disappointment.
In the rush of adrenaline, he had blurted out, asking her if she'd like to go out sometime. She had laughed. He liked her laugh. She had accepted. He liked that too, although it had been on strictly platonic terms. They'd gone straight from the agency after he'd gotten a new set of clothes, to the Drop-Off, which they were to visit together in the next three years more than any other customers the owner could remember.
the gum, only with a vague synthetic mint flavouring, which would make perfect sense since cordite is three-fifths nitroglycerin so it would taste sweet naturally…
John opened the door, stepping out into the hallway in women's slacks. There was something he'd never thought he'd do. Check that off the list of things he never wanted to do again.
Sherlock heaves out a put-upon sigh, setting down his pen. “I’m sure I don’t know John. Your guess, as someone who is familiar with her, is as good as mine. The officer who arrested your assailant just returned with her a few minutes ago, so you can stop bothering me with this incessant questioning and go bother her.”
"Experience, yes. Although it was mild, I assume it gets worse as the abuse continues. A direct correlation."
"Why did they leave her vagina?" Sherlock asks, unfazed, as Lestrade's ears redden. "Please call it by its proper name, Lestrade, it's only the respectful thing to do. We are not schoolboys in the yard anymore."
“Not particularly.” He huffed. “You remember, I was drunk most of the time. And of course I trust you John, but at the same time I am aware of the lengths Moriarty will go to, to ensure my downfall by proxy of you. I just want you to be careful, and nothing in this plan of yours reassures me that you’re not putting yourself in danger because it makes you feel alive. You are at your best in war, a fact I am tempted to both admire and denigrate. Don’t allow it to be the end of you.”
He runs a thumb over John’s temple, taking a long and shaking breath. It was so easy to start imagining if things had gone wrong. Hypotheticals were all he had to remind him of how lucky he was, how lucky they all had been. Until John woke permanently, until he was up and talking and Johning the particular way he did, there was still the chance Nachash could get to him. There may always be a chance. There would always be the lingering fear of Damocles’ sword, of the pain of helpless love waiting to crush him. He would be reminded of the fact that in John’s suffering he would always be an outsider.
“And what might this one be?” Sherlock replies groggily, trying to gather his conscious thoughts into something workable, though they keep bobbing out of reach, disappearing into nothingness as quickly as they come.
The tracks scream underneath them for a moment and Sherlock is reminded of the sound John made when he fell to him. He wonders what sound it would make when he left.
"You can't do that anymore, Sherlock." He looked up at him with tired eyes. "You can't just force me to tell you everything. You can't just—just
He would be lying if he said he wasn't envious towards the detective. Who wouldn't be? He was everything Jim wanted, and that was nothing he saw in Sebastian Moran. But Sherlock had the love of John Watson tether him to the ground, whereas Jim had severed those chains long ago, not wanting to be tied down by anything. Sherlock's weakness and his salvation. Jim didn't like the word. He thought he didn't need it. Sebastian didn't want to give him salvation. He wanted to go along for the ride.
“Do you love other things like you love me? Do you love me as much as you love a tree or a patch of grass or another person?”
It was illogical, because John himself had watched Georgei Kurgazov die, watched him bleed out underneath his hands, watched the light leave his eyes nearly two years ago.
He stood and stretched; one of the things he’d found himself missing was the way his skin would pimple under the cold air, although most other bodily reactions remained the same. A bite mark over his heart tightened against the cold, not quite healed, pierced through deeply by sharp teeth.
"Yeah," John replies dryly. "And lately I've developed a keen interest in large hats and I've kept myself up at nights thinking of how to successfully invade Russia."
The rumpled sheets had fallen off the bed, kicked off as she had struggled. The pillow was still warm, still smelled of her, the scent light and unencumbered.
“You have his rope in your hand, and his is in yours. You feel strangled when he is in danger, and so he does for you. You have traded, see. Mine? Mine is still in my hand, where it started. When I am in peril, only I tighten it. Only I care what happens to me.”
," he adds, "with a good plan in place, who's to say we don't have just as good a chance as he does?"
“Very well. He’s been gone longer than anticipated, so we might make our way to his office.” Mycroft says with a tight smile, which fades when his eyes dart to That Door. “Sherlock—”
“God, it smells like deer piss in here.” John muttered, head falling against the cabinet. “We’re never going to get the smell out.”
John sighs. “It’s not about me thinking you want rid of me, Sherlock, it’s the fact that you never considered me in any of your plans. Not with the hallucinations in Baskerville, not with your fall at Bart’s—Christ, even with the pool you just showed up with the Bruce Partington plans regardless of where I was and thought you could solve it yourself! You don’t trust me enough to include me in the things that matter most to who we are as—as friends.”
“Was that really called for?” He croaks, opening his eyes in the thick darkness to glare in the direction of his captor.
It could be for someone else; another vampire, crossing into his territory, or an old fight returning again. It could mean anything, and he didn’t know where to start.
; John remembered hearing that in London in the original run. The way they felt about each other did not change, although its intensity may waver.
The boy stared at her and there was something slipping in his eyes that gave him away, like he wasn't fully committed to what he had come to do. He must have seen the realisation dawn on her face.
He’d pointed out a few constellations to Mikheia without any response before the boy dropped off, carried into a deep sleep by the adrenaline crash and an exhaustion that was burdened with a heaviness that is impenetrable to outsiders and incongruent to any other emotional state. The weight of death sits in the cart with them, has bound them inextricably to one another, and tied their wrists together in the most terrifying and brutal way humanly possible. Although John tried to reason with him—for all they knew, Moran was still alive since there hadn’t been time to check—he quickly realized the headspace his friend was in, and let him weather his storm alone as long as he wanted to.
A smile flickered to Sherlock's face. "They've got some cans out back if you'd rather watch paint dry." He offered, and just like that there they were, two madmen laughing together in the desert in front of a corpse.
There was an otherworldly wail as John struck, burying a large carving knife in Billy’s remaining ankle, splitting through the bone and into the ground. He did the same with the other foot, pinning his body to the earth with a sharp paring knife.
"It's possible." Sherlock admits. "The world never suffers from a shortage of people desperate enough for attention and mad enough to try and get it."
"Yes," he said quietly, as he began to pace in a circle around his husband. "I want it to be slow. I want you to think of me as you burn and fall apart and suffer, alone." He paused, cocking his head as he continued to clean his hands. "No. You know what? I've changed my mind. I want it to be quick, over and done with, and you left to nothing but ashes, as if you were never here to begin with." His lips thinned as he frowned. "There is no way I can answer the question you're asking. In either scenario, I am not there to witness it, or play any role other than the ghost that follows you in your heart."
That night, wedged between John and the wall, he dreams of trees again. He’d had pine in place of marrow in his bones once more, and that sticky sweet smell returns to slow his blood to sap again. He’s slowly poisoned by the greenness of it all.
Takaijihi. That was his name now. ‘Tall Mercy’. Partly for his height, yes, but partly for the other meaning: a high price; expensive. Neither side pretended that the reason they had allowed him to attend their meetings wasn’t because of the damage he’d done to the three cocksure foot members that tried to mug him.
"How long has it been since you last ate?" He asked as Sherlock tipped the canteen back once more. "Or drank?"
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he snapped the locks on the case to the sitar. He hated repeating himself. The whole lot of them could
"But the likelihood that they are in Sarajevo are staggering. The ratio alone must be in the triple digits—"
"That's why I buried her." John said cheerfully, watching the dark water as it lapped its way to shore. Sherlock's head whipped towards him.
Mycroft scoffs. "You would know if it was a threat, Sherlock. Don't be so benighted. It's beneath you."
"John, John, let me help you, listen to me—" Sherlock pleads, finding it hard to manage all of this mess in so little space. "John,
"I always wondered why you were in that car after my first assignment." He looked at her. "Did they send you on purpose? Try to bait me in with a pretty woman that was as kind and patient as I needed?" He smirked. "It worked. Better than they know."
Mycroft and Lestrade share a glance as the news story ends and Sherlock continues to sit there, staring at the telly as if there’s more to be gleaned from it.
"John is not the one responsible for Jim's death. If anything, I am to blame. Logically then, your gun is aimed at the wrong person."
The helicopter air-lifted Mikheia to the nearest hospital, leaving the three to ride in a tense silence through the streets until they too arrived at the hospital.
He had promised to take John driving, so the next night they journeyed up through the winding hills and dark backroads. John rolled his window down, putting himself nearly halfway out of it, the wind brushing against his face, his hair, moonlight shining off his sunglasses. It brought a smile to Sherlock’s face, watching the ridiculous man hang his head out of the car like a dog going on a ride.
The man turned over, peering up at him with eyes the crystalline blue of a clear winter sky, his face red and smudged with dirt around a dark bandana.
Her smile is straight, white, and easy. She laughs at the slightest things he says and God help him if it doesn't make him feel a little bit cocky. He is sitting at this table with a woman far too beautiful to be in his league, and she's laughing at his jokes and smiling and actually carrying conversation. She was a little late, but John can forgive that, mainly because once she starts talking he doesn't want her to stop.
He was not able to leave the hotel. Mycroft had made sure of it. Did he know what Sherlock was planning? Probably not. He most likely thought that Sherlock would kill himself at the first chance he got. A few hours ago, he would have been right. Now though, now Sherlock had some other business to take care of first.
of all people if you can believe that. Moriarty had you all pinned under his thumb, he had people out there ready to kill you, and so I did what I could to ensure that didn't happen. He killed himself to make sure I had no other alternative but to jump. And I did, for you and for everyone."
There was the sound of fading footsteps. The rust began to peel off Sherlock's seldom cared for heart, revealing the tender, unused muscle underneath and making him aware of it and its pain all the more strongly.
John left his patient at the improvised bedside and said something quietly to the chef before shuffling around the room as he began to gather the required items. Sherlock, of course, heard it all.
Sherlock looks up at him, resting his chin on John's collarbone. He smiles, unguarded and genuine, one of those rare sights that even John can count on one hand.
“You’ve been misinformed, sadly.” He bites out. “Our association is at an end as well. I wasted—” He stops. He is overcome with the urge to break something. He has spent a month here, a month, a captive, a gun for hire, and for what? Moran isn’t here. Moran is not. Here. A month is gone, Moran is gone, he was never here in the first place, not when it was crucial, not when it mattered—he wants to break something—
The chair creaks as the man sits back down. “However, Captain, we have some other pressing matters to deal with for the moment. Are you capable of speaking?”
Sherlock wills his ears to shut as tightly as his eyes are, but he can’t block out Not-John’s laugh.
John might be off enjoying the small mountain down of Damüls, Austria. John might throw a snowball at him when he least expected it and say "Christ Sherlock, you look like a fucking barbet with wet hair, you know that, right?". John might stumble through rudimentary German when he ordered his food-although he was always good at picking up useful phrases (must have been from his time in the army)- and then marvel as Sherlock broke out in flawless German, complete with accent, proclaim it
Sherlock cannot imagine anything that was so special about him as a child, nor teenager, nor adult, to give John even an ounce of what he himself felt for him. John was an angel, he was good and brave and unparalleled, and what was he? What did John see in him that was so deserving?
He’s cut off as something blurred and hard barrels into him harshly, arms wrapped around him like a garrote.
"Hmm?" Harry looks back. "Oh, well you lot do love to believe in the idea of physical things, and not so much in the things themselves, don't you?" She shrugs. "It's not hard, changing what's there once you know what to call it. It either is, or it isn't, and it was in our way, so I made it into an 'isn't'."
"You big peacock." John chuckled into his shoulder before he brought up his head, resting it on Sherlock's clavicle, kissing the area where Sherlock's heart beat beneath hot skin. "I'm going to move. Is that okay?"
Sherlock decides to let her believe she’s cleverer than he is. That she’s winning. The scene in the bathroom flashes before him and he hesitates. She knew he wasn’t interested. Must be persistence then, or otherwise. He’d return to it later.
He watches his brother’s attention devour the screen, and wonders if this is it, if this is how far unchecked he has allowed his affections to go. He is staring at it as if it is the one thing in the whole world he needs, as if his existence hinges on it. This table holds the one thing Sherlock Holmes cares about the most, and this one thing is an ocean and circumstance away.
"They can know that anyways without a personal visit." Sherlock says irately. "Mycroft can tell them. I'll text my mother."
"If I knew, don't you think I'd be doing it?" Sherlock snaps at him before John makes a noise and Sherlock brushes hair from his face. "John, John talk to me. Your larynx is uninjured, so I know you can talk."
Mycroft was silent, but they could both sense his distaste. “Harriet was always determined to have what she would.”
"What gave me away then?" Sherlock asked and to John it sounded like he assumed he was humouring him.
John was dying – he had not said as much to his brother, but he knew that he knew. He could feel the essence of existence leeching from him slowly, and he was not surprised when the bond cut out; a last contingent to spare John any remaining energy.
The driver had just set his things down on the curb when John saw it: movement in the upper floor window; the drawing back of a curtain.
He turns at his name, coming face to face with two tall, obviously foreign men, one pallid and drawn, looking to be one step in the grave, and the other straight-backed and serious. He startles for a moment at just how much he and Death Walking look alike; both skinny and possessing dark hair laced with curls, both with high, defined cheekbones and pronounced lips. But for his glasses and the distant, grieving look in Death’s eyes, they could be the same man.
As he trailed off, a high whine began in his ears, like an unending alarm. It felt like his head was tightening, trapped in a compression. Even in his dazed state he knew he had some sort of head trauma, although quite mild, so he counted himself lucky.
“Maybe. Maybe I like how Jim spun you in circles. Maybe I wanted to try. See how good I was next to him.”
He collapsed to the floor, the feeling not so dissimilar from behind shot, although far less intense. He felt the metal's impact reverberate deep through his bones as he tried to suck in the breath it had punched out.
“It’s no shock blanket,” Sherlock huffs, wrapping the other end of the duvet over himself as he curls closer to John. “But it will have to do for now.”
“I’ll eat mine.” I say, but I don’t move to picking up my fork. He’s hiding something, there’s something he won’t tell me, something is wrong—
"Expecting someone?" John asked. Past the initial impression, the whiskey was settling into his bones nicely, driving out the evening cold.
"Just a mad thought in the mad mind of Sherlock Holmes." Mary sighed. "Ah, well, no harm done." She eyed his bandage. "Not to me, anyways. How is it today?"
“I’ll try.” Sherlock says tensely and Lestrade nods grimly. He doesn’t know if he should add anything, any words of comfort.
Odd. This place was certainly aesthetically pleasing enough for a photograph. Maybe the shot wasn't as good on the balcony as elsewhere in the church.
“No, he was under the assumption that we had a younger brother and I informed him that we, in fact, do not. What’s happened?”
“So I’ve got a loaded gun pointed at her—plain old bullets do kill other things like they kill us—and she tries to seduce me, but still appearing as myself. It was like my cock and my brain were on two
“Are you hungry?” John asked, handing Sherlock his coat to hang as he went to start a fire in the grate.
He didn’t know why John was being so difficult about it – he would love Washington; it would remind him of Scotland. But no, he was the one who insisted on that insipid trip to
But that would only expedite John's end, and that was one thing Sherlock could not abide by. He stared down at his doctor. He looked so young when he was asleep—strike that—unconscious. The lines that came with worrying over Sherlock were gone.
"Because the couple two tables over are suffering from a bad habit of eavesdropping and do you really have anywhere else to go?"
"Sorry I disappointed you." John answered coldly. "But you are rather late. I'm afraid you couldn't get my usual treatment."
“What do you want, John?” He says miserably, sinking back own into his seat. “Because I don’t think I can tell anymore.” He presses his palms against his eyes, seeing bursts of John’s afterimage. “You can’t go, and you can’t stay. So what do you want?”
“Sherlock, haven’t you had enough of having his fate in the air? Surely of all people you’d want to know—”
"Cause of death…" Sherlock murmurs, nudging at the body with gloved fingers. "Acute psychosis brought on by substance injection, most likely a solution of cocaine."
He braces himself as the cloth is removed from his head again. A heavy weight settles against his face—whatever machine it was that they were using.
"To see how far they could push you. How far you'd go when you were unstable. If you would forget your morals."
John sits in the sunshine in the middle of Sherlock's duvet, eyes shut and wings folded. He stands in the doorway, peering down at the psuedo-angel and he already knows he wants to see nothing else when he comes home. He always wants John to be in his sight when he opens this door.
"I made cookies." He said happily, tossing the tray into the sink and taking off the apron. "But you call them biscuits, yes? You British are very odd; everything is mixed up when I am with you. I found the ingredients in the oddest place, in the back of the pantry, like someone was trying to hide them—"
"The night's young," Irene said. "You're welcome to come in, provided you leave your weapons at the door—"
so freshly arrived to the Continent. Beneath the long canopy whose golden tassels stretched the length of the ship, the interior stitched in blue velvet and fine silver stars. On one end, the guest of honour sat, lording over his loaned subjects for the evening. On the other, a small stage had been constructed, where a
John's heart was the happiest it had been in years, thrumming, pounding, beating out a rhythm of sheer joy as he ran. His brain hummed with cool purpose, focusing in on one target and nothing else. Hell, if he squinted, he could pretend he was running through the market of Asadabad, wearing that god awful uniform that he hated right up until the moment he took it off, when he began to miss it with a terrible ferocity. Asadabad, where he could rip off his Kevlar with the rest of the troop and dive into the Pech and not worry about anything for a half hour at the most and just float in the cool water and pretend he wasn't there. Asadabad, where he burned on that beach in his dream, where he was taken from Sherlock like a fish on a line, left to wake in that crushing despair where every shadow looked like a silhouette of that mad genius as the fever clung to him. He still tried not to think of the Kremlin, but that didn't mean he didn't. And it was also another story, for another time.
“It makes me forget.” He mumbled, his eyes tracing the terra cotta shingles. John bit the inside of his mouth – he would get no more out of the idiot tonight.
The weather comes on. Cloudy, with rain. How surprising, in London, in the springtime. Truly shocking.
“Tell our dear Sherlock I say hello.” Moriarty smiled. “You’ll see me again.” He said, blowing a kiss at him. “Until then, Johnny.”
"The coffee was already made. You've been up a while, all night perhaps, but you've changed clothes, which implied that you felt dirty. You may have also taken a shower, but that's doubtful as I didn't hear water running and you always let your hair dry naturally and it's not wet now. You're expecting an attack, which is another reason why you haven't showered, since you thought you didn't have time. You're tired, but not just from lack of sleep. You're worried for our safety since you feel responsible for getting us into this, even though I am at as much fault, if not more than you. You feel guilty over those men's deaths, even though you shouldn't. You know your agency is dangerous, but you've been ignoring the fact until now, because they've never threatened you and now they've crossed a line. You're wondering where your loyalties lie. And, judging by your posture, you have to go to the bathroom, so by all means…" Sherlock trailed off, gesturing to the bathroom.
And that was all Sherlock needed to bridge the gap between them, the approval he had sought to go forward for so long. He brought his hands to hold John’s face and let out a sigh of relief at the touch— finally—as they sank into their bond together.
The room falls silent, save for the chairs creaking as all the men look to one another to see how they should react to the news.
The click of a key. The opening and shutting of a door, and John found himself pressed in the cool darkness between Sherlock and the door.
Sherlock leans back and stares him. Mycroft knows that look too well, the assessing predator lurking in the grass. As if Mycroft were low enough to be counted as
They had been ghosts in Norway, and they were ghosts now, although of an entirely different kind. They would wake together in their tiny rooms as the sun fell through the sky, staring at each other silently as they worked at their connection, passing over it the way a jeweler holds a rare and particular brilliant, making sure to catch the light at every angle, detangling each snag and knot slowly; then they would wash and dress one by one, watching each other by the light of the oil lamp. When night was a certainty, dimmed behind the thick curtains, they would go out.
John smiled, a little sadly, wistfully. He gripped Sherlock’s hands in his, then let go, standing up. A feeling had begun within him, something slow and powerful, a banked fire growing in heat. It had been a long time since he had felt
"I suppose this is for some noble and lofty reason, then." Sherlock said, stubbing out his cigarette.
“You didn’t come here upon your arrival.” He begins. “Your shirt is too starched, a sign of cheap detergent. You had to wash it, and hotel detergent was the only available option because you didn’t expect to be here long enough to bring a change of clothes. You went somewhere else. You went to see someone and they ruined your shirt, or you ruined it while visiting them. Gluttonous as you are, I can’t see you cramming scones and tea in that maw so sloppily that you’d spill. You can’t move that fast anyways. So,” He sniffs, “someone ruined your shirt and assuming it wasn’t a clumsy waiter because you didn’t have time to eat anywhere much to your chagrin, it wasn’t food—”
"You are the one that's escaped? The one they are looking for?" The boy's accent wasn't Russian, it was something from farther east. Romanian perhaps?
John whips around, but there is nothing behind him. His eyes dart around the room. He didn't imagine that; a woman had spoken just now, her voice high and airy. Perhaps Sherlock had the TV on and it had come through the vents. That happened in quiet places. Sound carries, after all.
She had called on him a day later. Not in person, of course. They were not friends, not acquaintances, and barely allies. She had merely gotten to him first, and unleashed him on everyone else.
He still has to heal. He still has to pester Sherlock to answer his questions about Emma's brother. He still has to learn what it means to be in love with a man who infuriates him as much as he endears him. He still has to learn all those things he thought he would lose in that lonely and desperate car ride.
“You don’t think you matter, Sherlock.” John says softly, something inside him swollen with heavy sympathy. “You don’t think anyone cares about what happens to you. For thirty years, you’ve thought you’ve been alone.” He swallows, or tries to, but his throat is closing. “For thirty years, I’ve watched you. I’ve learned your heart, memorised it inside and out. I could point it out if I were blindfolded in the darkness and didn’t know which way was up. I’ve watched you destroy yourself and I’ve watched you build yourself back up. You think your heart is worth less than one that doesn’t even exist? Then you don’t know how precious yours is.” His voice quiets to a whisper. He can feel his eyes stinging. "
“You’re too good for me.” Sherlock says abruptly, if only because he has just acknowledged the feeling himself.
"John Hamish Watson," Sherlock's voice was raw, scraped by desperation. "If you've gone and let Moran give you a bloody concussion I won't let you shag me again for a month, do you hear me?"
Afterwards, Mikheia clears the plates as John redresses his wounds—he had, of late, thankfully gained most of his mobility back—, wrapping gauze around raw but healing skin. Georgiy wordlessly darts around, helping Mikheia with the dishes and holding a bandage for John when it’s necessary, before he bundles himself up and heads out to the barn to lock up the animals.
“Ah.” The man stands, hurriedly wolfing down the rest of his polenta, and sets the bowl down with a clatter, striding past them into the next room, gesturing for them to follow. “This way.”
He strode down the stone streets of the Baščaršija square, in a hurry to get back to John and tell him all that he had learned.
be with you. Who will do the shopping since you hate the grocery store? Who will work when we don't have a case?" John's smile faded and he put a hand over Sherlock's. "I may be
"I'll promise you whatever I damn well please. When we're old and grey and I'm about to go, I'll blindfold you and you can't take it off until the funeral's over and done with. So there, you will never see me dead again."
Thank you all for sticking with this story - I hope that it is one you find both rewarding and engaging, whether you read it one time, or come back to read it again.
God, he’d missed this. The connectivity, the instant rejoining. They were perfect, soulmates wasn't adequate for what they shared. Sherlock would lap at his neck, kiss him, wedge his thighs open with his knee, and it was unlike anything else; no blood high, no bite, no human, would ever match him, and he knew Sherlock felt the same, even if he didn’t say it. He almost wished he could still bruise, just to see those marks in the mirror the next day and try to match them with his own palm.
“If you lose yourself, if it happens again, I need you to tell me, no matter what. I want to help you.”
“No,” he shook his head. “it’s not.” He perched on the edge of their bed, looking up across the room at his mate, standing as still as stone, as if waiting for the other shoe to drop, the blade to fall; suddenly he hated himself, how he had acted, how he’d behaved. Sherlock’s recovery had not been easy, and it was not far in the distance behind them, yet he still acted as if it were possible these last years had been for nothing, as if one fight, one criticism, one misconstrued word might send his mate spiraling back down into the darkness that had consumed them in Norway.
They rounded the corner to where their gondola and its driver had been slated to wait. The water taxi was still tied to its post, but the driver was now slumped over against the oar racks, dark blood soaking his lapels. Sherlock’s teeth descended so rapidly at the smell that his fangs punched twin holes into his lip, and he felt John steady himself as the scent washed over him too.
"Oh, let's not forget Watson, here." Moran jerked John upwards, snapping his head back to reveal his face, messy with blood and flour. "You should tell him to keep up his sparring. He's gotten quite sloppy since we last met. Although I wouldn't bet on him remembering that bit—"
That night John bolts up in his bed, cold sweat trickling down his temples even though his head is hot. No, not hot.
So it was no surprise to the train that it was unfamiliar to the entanglements of love as well as the tension that occasionally and inevitably springs between two people who love each other, a tension neither is willing to initiate the solution to for fear of looking like a right idiot.
“Mycroft can go fuck himself.” Sherlock bit out and John raised his eyebrow at the crassness; he was quite upset, more-so than he was letting on. “And the whole world can go with him.”
John takes a deep breath through his nose, his knuckles white as he grips the doorframe. He can smell the sting of sulphur, and his gaze catches a pair of clawed feet singed into the floor.
Sherlock tightened his hold on John’s hand. The constant endearments and minor praise were different in person than over the phone; there was something realer to John’s adoration when he was there, the two of them together.
Sherlock growls in frustration before heading to the parlour and donning his shoes, mismatched with his robe and pyjamas, but he couldn't be arsed to care about much so soon after waking up other than the fact that he needed to find John and then hassle him about buying more coffee.
The kettle clicked as the water boiled away, gussets of steam billowing into the cold air. Heating the house through the night cost money that he didn't have. So he made do.
"Mikheia…" John muttered. Two great green eyes stared at him, blood trickling down the side of his face from an open cut. His hands were bandaged with torn, bloodied pieces of cloth in the way of street punks that had habits of breaking windows.
Sherlock followed him in, shutting the door to their room before tossing his cloak over the chair, shoulders tense.
Sherlock's ratio of people he pissed off—to—people in Sarajevo seemed with every hour that passed to be falsely corroborated.
He had seen Sherlock blacked out and faded from drug use, seen him feral and deadly from withdrawal, seen him irate and impatient from lack of food or sleep, but Sherlock heartbroken, Sherlock without John, that was something entirely different. He would not stand-by and watch his brother destroy himself over anything, even someone as worthy as John Watson.
"Even if you prove me wrong, I will never agree with you." Sherlock says monotonously, the tone John knows he reserves for when he's sulking.
." Lestrade's voice seems to hold enough power that Moran lets his taunts peter out. The two stare at one another for a moment. "Where?"
A grainy video feed fills the screen, shaky and unsteady with the motions of the hand that’s holding it. Sherlock can tell the owner is a drug dealer. Why else would they be in a dark park at midnight with those motor reflex skills? Their camera is focused on one of the greater ponds that were built to look as if they went on for metres and not miles, the lens facing outwards, away from the railings and sculptures and towards the dark shadows of the treeline.
with you?" Sherlock took a deep calming breath. "Sebastian Moran, former sniper in the Queen's Army, is now a gun for hire, an assassin working out of Moriarty's pocket."
"If you two are quite done," Sherlock bites, "I have investigating to do. Honestly Lestrade, with me doing your job, I still can't believe you get paid for things like this..."
"They only people that know where he is are criminals, like him." He sputtered, gesturing to the river as if it proved his point. "If I knew, if I was a criminal, I probably wouldn't tell you. It is very easy to see that you are a foreigner. Criminals make it their business not to trust foreigners, only rob them."
on, Sherlock. What if you or I hadn't gone out and they found us here? What if they attacked Mrs Hudson? You let a
"No," Mary said, pursing her lips, "but the attending doctor seemed to think it was a combination of hallucinogens and a chemically altered epinephrine synthetic."
"Anyways, John, what was so important that you had to rush into the hall and hug me like I was the messiah come to earth?"
"Would you rather I kill you now?" He asked. It wasn't a threat, but a mercy. If the man wanted to die, he had the option to do it quickly, without pain.
“No.” Sherlock replies briskly. “Call your people. Report a gas leak, turn on the sprinklers, pull the fire alarms, I don’t care. Get them out.”
This was Post-John, singularly more worse and terrible than anything else he had been through, something he had never hoped he'd live to experience, something he'd sacrificed three years of
Ever since Moriarty, John did not liked to be strapped to anything. It made him nervous. Hell, it would make anyone nervous.
If Sherlock had not had the exact same thought minutes earlier, when John had fallen into the mud and he thought the worst, he might have blanched. He might have been speechless.
and downed the last of his drink, letting the dregs of thought settle in his mind as the wine pooled warmly in the pockets of his stomach.
“Later.” Sherlock answered, staring at him with an equal intensity, looking to the rest of the world like mild concern.
As his mind recedes into the darkness, indistinguishable from the one that surrounds him, he thinks of Sherlock. Of course he does. It’s safe now.
Too many people, too many, and that was what Moran had been waiting for. He was going to fulfil Moriarty's last request, that John be killed where Sherlock Holmes could see it and he was going to do it because Moriarty was to Sebastian Moran what Sherlock was to John Watson, an invaluable man he held in the highest regard, whom he would gladly die for, whom he would gladly put his military skills to good use with, and whom he would avenge if given the chance. John had offered his life for Sherlock's at the pool that night they met Moriarty, and now it was simply Moran's turn, although it came to him too late.
. He had briefly considered the thought that it was simply two men sharing a name, which happened often enough, but a quick scan through the pages of each revealed an uncommon bloodlust for hunting game, which sent off all the alarms in John's head, a warning that screamed '
of hatred and darkness won't follow. John is simply overcome by the desire to have Sherlock nowhere near it; he'll have to come up with a plan later.
John's head snapped up, his gaze darting from the river to scan his surroundings. Nothing much to look at. A few tourists taking pictures, locals sunbathing on the grass, people walking dogs. A boy nearby him coughed.
The moon hung over the city, the stacked chimneys, the sleeping world. Women stood in the windows, couples milled in the streets; people were living, going about their evening, unknowing, concerned with themselves and their lives.
He didn't feel anything towards the people he killed. Not guilt, not remorse, and certainly not pity. What guilt had they shown when they torched the church and let those kids and their teacher burn alive? What remorse did they have when they kidnapped young children and then left their bodies for their families to find? What pity did they have when they murdered innocent people? If they had the ignominy to not feel any of that, then John would treat them accordingly.
"That's rather pot meets kettle, don't you think?" He says lowly. "If we're meeting on mortal grounds, John, I'd say you haven't a leg to stand on."
"That's what you want, isn't it?" John groaned, head lolling forward briefly before falling back to stare at the high ceiling. "It's why you took Sherlock earlier. To get back at him, for Jim."
Sherlock stepped forward, bringing a hand to outline John's face as they stared at each other. John let his fingers lace themselves with Sherlock's.
“You were in love with her. You were seeing her secretly, and no one else at school or her friends knew about it. She was the homecoming queen, she was dating the captain of the football team…how long did you think you could keep this relationship a secret?”
for god's sake, not Lestrade! The day I show him deference is the day that the Queen crawls out of my—"
"No, it's okay Sherlock." John says gently. "You don't have to regret what you say if you mean it…if it upsets you. It's better than keeping it inside until it turns stagnant and bitter and you're too ashamed of it to tell me. You're human. You all have thoughts that are too terrible to say."
It was selfish, if nothing else, to die so that someone else may live. Sherlock would feel as John did, know his pain of losing the one he loved most, but there would be no coming back. At least they still had those golden moments, beams of light in the storm. At least Sherlock could live off those memories, off the kisses and the knowledge that John loved him with everything he was. John hadn't been granted that amenity after Bart's, and if he could live off nothing, maybe then Sherlock could sustain himself on what he'd been given.
“I’m not going to kill you.” He whispers at the bridge of John’s nose. “I can’t do a thing like that twice.”
The shadow of the barwoman moves away and he continues to drum his fingers on the table, only to have the light blocked again a moment later.
John shrugged. “The less he knows the better. I go in, I get out. No one has to know but us, but I don’t think you should go back to your meetings with Moriarty. He’ll skin you for a new chessboard after this, I’d think.”
“I get it, then.” He says softly. “I get it. You have to do this. I’m the last wrung of the ladder to get you out of the pit.”
"We don't have the equipment here; I had to send it to Seattle. Farther away but better analysis. We're waiting on the toxicology reports. Those'll take a few days."
Ne eyes him across the bar, worrying at the yellow beads around his wrist. Sherlock raises his glass, eyebrow arched. Ne lights a cigarette, staring him down, the embers glowing in his eyes before the strobe lights drown them out, and then looks away.
"I can still taste you, what you're feeling, even after my…well, whatever happened to me." He murmurs into the soft curly down. "It's like…mint, clear air, snow…bliss. Pureness. You feel happy."
John cries out, feeling the metal slice through tenuous tendons and lean muscle, feels it knick slick solid bone, and Azazel reaches behind him again, snagging another smaller knife from the stand.
"A higher one, in generalised terms." John smiles. "It likes to appear as what the individual perceives it to be. It's called Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, Shintoism, the solar system, science." John wants to bottle the surprise on Sherlock's face. "You call it epiphanies. I call it outside help."
“I really thought I might die.” Sherlock said, rather plainly. “After you left, it was as if you have taken all the color of the world with you. And your implication was asinine, of course I knew where you kept your shoes, your domestic preferences are entirely predictable—”
As he leans against the old whitewashed wood of the back door to take off his boots, Sasha trots back to him, wagging his tail as he offers his prize in his mouth to Mikheia: a red apple.
. You are fool's gold, Sherlock Holmes. But...the real question is: is he?" She asks slowly, her mocking eyes turning to John.
They are in tandem now, moving with each other. John’s hand touches his face, brings him close. Breathes softly against his jawline, nudges his nose to the side. He murmurs something inaudible against Sherlock’s skin, and then their lips touch and there’s no need for words anymore.
Mikheia made an amused face and stared at him a moment, drumming his spoon on his cup absentmindedly.
ruined me.” He admits, “But I failedyou. I’ve dissolved you down to atrophy. Look at what’s become of you, John. You’ve barely spoken since you came back, I thought I broke you, I thought—I thought I did the wrong thing, bringing you back—”
Was this what Sherlock had known, what he had felt going up those stairs to the roof of St. Bart's? That he was going to die? It was an odd feeling, a stranger smudged among familiar thoughts. It felt cold and empty, bells clanging tightly inside his gut.
“I’m crackers.” John says and they both smile, but it’s heavy with something they’d rather not name. “But, until tonight, I’d never given it a second thought. You’re Sherlock, you’re crazy, and it’s what makes me mad for you. It’s what makes you
and so he went to the one behind it and watched as dust and sand flew by as they followed the first and watched as it hit a UED and exploded and watched as it burned and it could have been him in there and it was all
"Pity." Moriarty says lowly. "You scared him off. Don't bite the hand that feeds, Sherlock. Looks like you'll have to be put down."
"That's where you're going after you head home, pack up your things, go to the airport, and get on your plane tomorrow."
"But I do, John or…I'm trying to. I don't want to proclaim that you knew what you were signing up for when you became involved with me both platonically and emotionally, but I've never hidden anything about myself from you, and I don't plan to either. I've laid everything out before you."
Sherlock squints as he peers closer at them—there seems to be words printed on the circular stamp of metal, but he can't make them out—
“Never actually got around to asking him, funnily enough.” John says coolly, gun still trained on Moran.
“Let’s go out. I want to go out.” John says excitedly and Sherlock gives a yelp of surprise as he yanks up the sheets and upends John off the bed. As he rolls off, John tucks into a tumble and rises to his feet in one fluid motion, stretching his arms above his head, the muscles pulling taut, like some supernatural Olympic gymnast before he disappears into the kitchen.
Already, she knew that Sebastian was going to go after them—her first, most likely—for leaving school before he could catch her, but he was quick to reckless (and usually wrong) conclusions, plus she had a head start. He'd go to the diner first, and annoy Sarah until she got sick of him and kicked him out. Then maybe to Molly's house, ask her parents in his nicest veneer where she was, pretend to be the wholesome All-American boyfriend instead of the slippery little eel he turned out to be. As much as she hated it, Rachel's death gave her the chance to keep him away for a few days, maybe even for good. She didn't want to see anyone really—just finding Will was draining enough—and she wanted to see Sebastian least of all.
—across the deck, and down into the galley. He was about to resist when he felt the bond lash him back into place, a strong, tensile sensation of self-control. Not his. John’s.
!" John shouts, almost snarling, as his head swivels to look over his shoulder. He grabs a piece of jagged metal piping from the debris littering the alley and Sherlock could swear it begins to pulse in his hand, humming with whatever energy John is powering through it.
The same could not be said for his mate; as the days went on, he began to notice that Sherlock was content, but not satisfied. He would often join John in his nightly activities, but soon he appeared less and less, wrapping himself in a cloak in the dungeon of the castle, running experiment after experiment late into the morning.
"S16, the atomic number for sulphur. The sample on her hand was diluted with hydrogen peroxide as a kind of damage control, although it seems to have only partially worked as her palm
It may have been the only time that Sherlock truly meant it, because Mycroft understood him. He understood what John meant, he understood why Sherlock didn't tell him where he was, and he understood why he was not complimented on his recent and substantial weight loss or his promotion or why Sherlock didn't ask how he was. Because he knew that Sherlock knew.
. It hurts so much, like his wing has been torn out from the root and a white-hot poker had been rammed into the open wound, searing him right down to the bone. He pants into the wet ground, smelling the thick scent of mud and dirt and grass as he hears the beast howl.
“Famous last words—” Moran begins, and Mikheia can practically hear the smile drop off his face as he hears the oncoming car and whips around, diving out of the way just before it careens into him, leaving it to crash into the elevator shaft. Ducking behind the cover of a nearby car, Moran smashes out a window and begins to fire in John’s direction as the car alarms from both wounded vehicles begin to blare. If he’d been in any other situation, Mikheia would be impressed by their sheer battery life, remnants of the cars built for longevity and not appearance, but he’s in the warzone now and can’t sacrifice the time to think about it.
"Listen, I ain't got time to argue with a man who was all but sure he'd live to see another day even while the rope was choking the life out of him. I want to know why you got up there in the first place."
As he closed the door, he self-consciously tugged at the waistline. The trousers were a little snug, but made of some kind of smooth material that let his skin breathe easily. Good, proper trousers for running away in.
Mycroft doesn’t understand why he holds the journal tightly if he so much as glances at it. Why Sherlock always keeps it close to him. He’d be a fool to let Mycroft take it away again. He’ll never tell him the real reason why he’s so…protective of this ratty little notebook, all worn leather and binding coming unstuck. If this journey leads nowhere, if John is really nothing more than ashes, then this is truly all he has left. This, and the ghosts. The thousand Johns that linger around their flat—and it will always be their flat, just as Sherlock will always be John’s and he will always be Sherlock’s—the ones that make a hundred cups of tea in a hundred different ways, the ones that read a different book every minute in John’s chair, the ones that make that tsk in the back of their throat as they clean up a hundred spilled liquids of a hundred experiments. All of his memories. All of his ghosts. They only leave when he shuts his eyes, or finds alternative solutions, and they’re right there again when he wakes, or when he comes back down so hard he crashes to earth and only wants to shoot straight back up again if it means he won’t hurt, or be aware that he does.
"You're ruining the experiment!" The man hissed as John began to climb up. "An unaccounted variable is absolutely disastrous—"
Pain began to course through his body, as if his mind had been trying to ward it off until the last possible moment. A soft pain, an ache of reopened wounds, yet he couldn't feel any blood sticking his shirt to his skin. His bullet wound felt red-hot. His lungs burned like he was holding his breath underwater.
-he's everything, he's the reason I left and the reason I would come back, and he'll never forgive me for what I did...never..."
They manage to make it to the train station just as theirs is about to depart, and he and Sherlock sit across from each other in an otherwise empty compartment as the English countryside speeds by, Sherlock's legs stretching to rest beside John's lap.
“Maybe we will, alright, but not if you keep blabbing it out like that. Is that how you knew my name?”
“You mean to tell me you’ve been to every den in Shanghai?” Irene said, raising her eyebrow. “He really did break your heart, didn’t he?”
It was his first live kill in over a hundred years. He loved it and he hated it, the struggle between life and death, the will of the creature, the essential fight to eat or be eaten. Rich blood poured into his mouth and spilled down his throat in a hot cascade, salty, metallic, beautiful. The stag was healthy; he could taste it.
Morning dawns cold against the walls, the blue of retreating night diving into a deeper hue until it begins to lighten, filtered through heavy grey clouds that blot out the weak sun. The smell of roasting coffee permeates the air, lying thick over vague traces of reheated food and gunpowder.
Sherlock's head snapped up from his examination the thick red marks on John's neck from where Moran had wrapped his arm around it, and for a moment he looked quite deranged.
"Of course, wherever he's concerned, you're always wary. Always…sceptical. I'm not surprised. That your brother would call you suddenly and proclaim that he had proof of something you always dreamed existed; it was too good to be true, wasn't it?" John drags his teabag from the mug and lets it drip into the steaming tisane. "Five minutes ago, you walked in here thinking that the safety you felt was indigestion. Now you wonder if I really am what Sherlock claims me to be." John grins as he stirs his tea. "Do you still believe he's delusional?"
John can’t answer, the sound is lodged in his throat, dry and tightening. Fear bangs around in his bones, trickling through the marrow and seeping in like cold water.
The house they finally stop at is indistinguishable from the rest of the block: skinny, teetering upwards as tall as its rudimentary stone structure will support, with a chipping red door facing the cobblestoned street.
The hush of the morning stills the air, the rising street sounds barely trickling inside. The room is dark, with only a solitary lamp turned on, casting long shadows filtered through the watered-down morning light over the walls.
The suspense in the anticipation of another murder nearly flees John's mind entirely, only revived by the constant notifications that it is all that occupies Sherlock's.
They silently draw their weapons; an old Tokarev TT-33 pistol and a rusted iron wrench. Georgiy was never one for war, but the same couldn’t be said for them, the soldier and the scarred spider boy, both adrift in their own penchant for danger, both lost to their lifelong gamble of cheating death.
They lay together on the bed, John on one side and Sherlock on the other, their coffee forgotten on the table.
if he was an arsehole, because that was usually when his mind burned at its brightest and they couldn't afford or care to break him from his revelations.
John shuts his eyes, his heart kicking harder and harder as if it's trying to protest what's about to happen. Funny how it would kill him by trying to keep him alive.
Word spread quickly around town about the foreign visitors, and although no one quite seemed to trust them, they were left to their own desires; once Sherlock had managed to solve the rather simple crime of a trussed-up goose and a missing gemstone, their reception was much warmer. Some evenings he would rise early and open their salon to whatever wayward visitor or potential patron might ring, and John would come later, prepare the tea service, and sit quietly as he watched Sherlock work, peeling apart the lowly, sundry drama of pastoral life.
This doesn’t stop Sherlock from thinking that John could have escaped. He could have leapt into the river at the last moment or—though Sherlock’s stomach twists at the irony—jumped, but the blast radius alone would have left him badly burned, perhaps to the point that, if the fire hadn’t killed him, he would have drowned in the river, and no one would have survived a fall from that height unless they’d planned it—and not everyone thought that far ahead. Perhaps he hadn’t even been in the car park at all, but that didn’t explain why John hadn’t found him then, why he hadn’t returned to the hotel or collapsed next to Sherlock in the wet grass of the assembly plant where he belonged.
Most days, John figured he found it was worth it. He had not known of the dark thoughts Sherlock entertained when they were apart, and when he finally admitted to them on the lawn of Dartmoor after a night facing the spectres and hounds of the hall, John had watched him pant out the truth, that he was terrified of dying, terrified of the greatest and loneliest last moment of wasted potential and squandered time, terrified of the true death that would separate the two of them irreparably. He had gasped into the wet grass of the early morning that John was never to leave him, that he was never to go where he could not find him.
John stilled at the revelation. He realised long ago that he could never truly doubt anything Sherlock said, so he usually took whatever came out of that perfectly shaped cupid's mouth to be gospel truth. He always seemed to pick the oddest and most inappropriate times to think about Sherlock's mouth.
Billy hissed, moving to retreat, but feinted, clutching at his neck with one hand and lashing out with the other, his nails piercing Sherlock’s cheek as the knife fell from his grip. Blood dripped down onto his face, the silver residue in it singeing his skin. He lashed out at any part he could reach, scraping his hands against the long wound at Billy’s throat, digging into the stab wounds, peeling away at as much of the cold flesh as he could reach.
“Love has its prices.” Felix began as they climbed the grand staircase, footsteps muffled by the lush carpet. “I’m not much for whores, but I’m sure they would come calling for you, men and women alike. A handsome man, a gentleman, and with money. What more could they want?”
Molly’s face crumples a little as she grips the blanket tighter around her shoulders. “Are you going to arrest him?”
"But that's—that's completely unlike Moriarty." John countered, coming to his senses once he shook his brush with death off. "Moriarty is like you. He always has a reason for whatever he does, he always..." John trailed off at the look on Sherlock's face and realised what he had said. "Oh, dammit, Sherlock, you know I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry, I just meant you guys think very similarly is all—"
“You remember Dartmoor. You remember what I said on the lawn.” Sherlock replied, and John nodded solemnly. “My greatest fear and my greatest comfort in life is the potential of a bottomless existence. Something that goes on forever; the possibilities are endless, but, then again, the possibilities are endless. Do you understand?”
"If I didn't get off from thoughts of your death, why would your injuries be any different since they brought you that much closer to that particular fantasy becoming a reality?"
M: Honestly, that was just kind of an abstract image or something in my head and I don’t know. I think Lot’s wife turned to salt when she looked back at the city. I think they used to pack bodies in salt. So there’s not specifically any meaning into it directly, but it seemed like a bad thing to have to live in salt. A lot of my lyrics approximate meaning without me knowing why they sound right."
Sherlock stands, but he doesn’t know why. It won’t get his point across any more than sitting. “I don’t understand. What don’t I understand?”
"They've been drugging me, Sherlock." John said hoarsely, looking up at him with red-rimmed eyes. "They've been drugging me, and I've been killing people for them." A sour laugh escaped him. "I didn't even think twice about it! Anyone else would have realised what was going on,
"You kicked me out of your room around two-thirty four this morning. Around three-thirty I heard restless noises and, knowing that you most likely caught cold from your swim, came up to check on you. As soon as you calmed down I left, but around four I heard noise again and decided it would be more pertinent to my sanity and your comfort if I moved you to my bed."
“You should know me better than that.” He says quietly. “The rent’s what you want to talk about? Fine. The rent’s been paid for. By your brother. For a lifetime. Do you know why? Because he felt bad that you went and killed yourself in front of me, and that he was partially the reason why. The only thing keeping me in this flat is
John's cut off as the doorbell rings once, short and brief. Not a client—or at least not one in the rush so common to them—and too brief to be a visitor either—no one goes out of their way to visit them unless they want something.
They knew where he was now. The alarm had been sounded or whatever they used to alert the staff of the facility.
"Well you try texting when both hands are carrying coffee." John smiled as he set down the cups, his smile so different from Not-John's, so unburdened and clean. He walked over to the bed and cupped Sherlock's face, kissing him on the forehead. "Sorry you had to wake up alone. Especially after last night—well—this morning. I thought you'd like waking up to coffee better than my morning breath."
"Well…they weren't you, for starters. Actually…that's about it. They weren't you. That's all I needed to know, really." John looked over at him. "Did you know that you look like a bloody barbet with wet hair?"
Mycroft has nothing to say. There isn't a bookshelf behind John to which he can discount the coloured wings he now sees. They aren't even remotely the same shade of dark brown.
"Bugger, is my tail showing?" John replies with a playful smile. "Well, I guess biologically speaking I'm as close to you as any other person on this planet. The change between realms shifts your insides a bit on the way over, made me look more like what you'd expect me to…made me look nonthreatening, so you'd accept me easier. There are some little differences though. For one, the food here, although it's quite good, doesn't do anything for me. I don't need to convert it into anything, so it just burns away after I've eaten it. It's a bit of a waste, but you don't hear me complaining. But in my real form I don't have ten eyes or a third leg or anything. I'm just…bigger, I guess. Brighter. Stronger."
"You told me you didn't know how long you'd be here. When I awoke, I thought—briefly—that your time had expired." Sherlock sniffs, turning his eyes from John. "I wasn't ready. Didn't want it to be over. I remember thinking how unfair it was."
Sherlock blinked, snapping back from that comfortable kitchen on Baker Street, to this airy, dark cathedral in Belgium, so far away from home. So far away from John.
It was the isolation of it all that really got to him. Everything was too still. At least when Sherlock was around he was always in a frenzy, trapped in thought or letting his silent presence seep through the room, and then later John was around to talk to about anything, but this sudden silence, their absence…it was like dunking red hot metal into icy water.
A faint smile graces John's face. "No. No, it was nothing like that. I knew exactly what I was doing when I came here."
"Then what did you think? You never tell me anything, and I don't just mean with St. Bart's or the time you were away. I mean
"Tell you what, Holmes." He smiles with red teeth. "You take me to your mate Lestrade, and I'll tell you where Watson is."
When he got back, the door wasn't shut all the way. He entered, a heaviness sinking inside him, confirming what he didn't want confirmed.
Fire bloomed around him like a sunrise, hot, sudden and bright. A machine to his left that had once been tasked to sorting bullets started to sputter as sparks began emanating from it. He could only hope the idiots that had abandoned this factory had taken the ammunition with them.
"You can't tell by which way the wind's blowing or the angle of my left eyebrow?" John frowned, busy cleaning the blood from under his nails. "He passed out halfway through. Should be fine in a few hours—"
, with your mad brain whole in your mad skull, not six feet under—hell, you're not even six feet away from me—and it's all that I've wanted for three years—Christ, it has been almost three years, hasn't it?" John stills, as if it's only just occurred to him how great the passing time had been. He's silent for a moment, his lips mouthing around the words
After a moment, the door to the bar opened, and John came up beside him, staring at the empty parking space.
However much power he gleans from his minor position in the British government, it unfortunately does not extend to airport security. Sherlock stands silently beside him in the queue, dutifully shedding his coat and shoes and placing them beside his carry-on in the plastic tray. Mycroft pretends not to notice that his eyes never leave the bag as it passes through the scanners.
John, the paradox. In his life for one week and already he can’t seem to bear to think of living without him.
He wishes Sherlock had his power. Wishes he could taste John's own disappointment, cold and pervasively stinging like swallowing a chunk of ice or rinsing with mouthwash (John had thought it had burned a hole through his cheek when he first used it). He wishes Sherlock knew what it was, to feel these things and know how to fix them yet also to feel as if you are unfixable. But he doesn't truly wish these things; he would never want Sherlock to live a life other than his own. It wouldn't be right. Wouldn't be fair.
"I'm sorry." John said, his lips grazing Sherlock's before he pulled himself away. "That's not how I want it to go. And once that brain of yours catches up, I don't think you will either."
But despite the petty scandals, he still has no motive for the son’s murder. Moran wasn’t stupid enough to do it for a name, just because it matched up with John’s. There had to be another reason.
"Please, John, a pebble with the power to make your body live forever? Sounds a little too good to be true because it is; it doesn't exist. I learned a long time ago that there's no use looking for immortality in a little rock." She crouches to meet his eyes, her own bright with fervour. "It's an
John opens his eyes to a sea of glazed confectionary treats. A glance in every direction he can manage yields towering stacks of shining chocolate, fine powdered sugar, colored sprinkles, and crullers with that fine patina of icing.
But sometimes that was all he could do. Thinking was his greatest strength. If they had never met, he would have gone on reaping humanity for its finest souls, draining and using every person he could find, until he was either caught, killed, or starved by poisoned blood. John would have been worse off; he had a huge streak for guilt and self-punishment, and an even wider margin for danger. Sherlock didn’t have to guess what would have happened to him: killed in battle, or by his own hand. He’d said as much before, of the decades after he’d been bitten spent in a vicious battle with himself, the loss of his humanity, hidden away in a self-imposed exile, wandering though the hills of Turkey, Hungary, Northern Italy. He knew John had a harder time coping with his immortality than he did; Sherlock had asked to be turned, and John had never had a choice.
"It's alright, I'm a doctor." He said calmly, his cadence practised and measured, and she trusted him through the haze of a drugged stupor and the language barrier. "Here, ease up, that dart really did a number on you." He helped her sit up against the wall. She didn't understand anything he was saying. "Whatever it was though, it was a mild sedative, and you should be right as rain soon enough." He smiled kindly. His eyes were so blue. He really was quite nice.
"I hope that's a reflection on my character and not my appearance." A voice behind them says as Lestrade comes to sit down at their table.
"I thought I was past wanting to murder you on sight," John said irately as he stood,"but you've always been good at proving me wrong."
“You know as long as I’m here, you won’t be alone, Sherlock. Never. I’ll track you down if I have to. My record’s pretty bloody on point there. If I’m going to stay, if this is going to work, you have to trust me enough to not spare me from the burden you carry. Ruin me a little. Let me help you.”
The sun was dipping low in the sky, casting an angelic pink limn around the clouds. John watched as Gladstone and his rider faded into the distance, merging in the horizon with the oncoming night. He glanced down at the gun, and opened the chamber. No bullets left.
Slowly, light begins to build in the laver, shining through in pockets and slashes, illuminating the roughly carved characters. Harry's grip on his hand tightens.
He moves to stand, but a warm hand has wrapped around his wrist. He looks down to where John is staring back at him.
He composes a sonata on his violin. He imagines he'd have played it at John's funeral. If he'd had one.
The man sat in his chair, clutching a Sig Sauer like a priest with his cross. Both methods were as ineffectual at stopping him as the other.
He had shared his concerns with John tenfold, a thousand times, but the stubborn man wouldn’t budge; he was going to stay a while longer, chance be damned. No amount of arguing or reason would move him. Part of him believed that not even a war would convince his husband to leave; another part believed that this was why he was staying: after what he had done in Switzerland, what had happened in Paris, John wanted a war, found purpose in it. He always had.
They watched the body in silence, waiting to see if anything more would happen. Slowly, a dark stain appeared on Hope's pants.
I do!" Mikheia burst out in a loud, raw voice whose existence Sherlock had long suspected but never witnessed. He could see tears in the boy's eyes. "So why do you keep asking me? I know that we are friends, Sherlock, and friends do not just abandon each other. I heard John tell you that friends do not let one another watch them fall, or do you only listen to him when it is convenient for you—"
"After I left you, in Norway," he began, "I didn't know where to go. I thought...maybe get off the continent. Go to England. Go to the New World."
Slowly, Sherlock separated himself, holding John’s head as he moved out from underneath his weight. Together, he and his brother took hold of John underneath his arms; Mycroft noticed his brother flinch as he tried and failed to keep his face still as John let out a low moan, his eyes still tightly shut, lost to fevered unconsciousness.
Mikheia stood and walked over to the trash can before spitting out a mouthful of biscuit, a smile on his face.
"Sometimes. Once again you demonstrate your habit of knowing things about me that no one else has the privilege to."
"He's been…weak." He heard Mycroft explain to Mary. "Quite weak." Then something else, "Drug…not fully left his system."
John looked at him then, and considered the question that previously he would never have thought could even cross his mind, much less be entertained to near completion. He was not in Sherlock’s head anymore, but he knew him well enough to recognize the expression on his face.
“One never knows with old dogs and new tricks.” Moriarty grinned, the dullness in his eyes brightening into a fevered gleam as he leaned forward excitedly. “What do you think it would take for me to get to him after all these years?” He asked with a manic smile. “What do you think I wouldn’t do?”
John's calmer now, his breath evening as the water dirties with mud and thick blackness that comes off his skin in congealed globs like tar, dense and oily. His eyes slide open slowly, flickering for a moment before settling on Sherlock, who must look more like a crazed semblance of a man than anything else at this point. There's too much darkness littering the water, it's growing less clear by the second.
"And what good would that do, sir?" Mikheia asked. "There are no mysteries in Bruges for you to solve whose answer was not already obvious."
. And for John, he’d go a little farther. For the two of them, for two men who together created the only real father he’d ever truly known, he’d go a little farther.
, Sherlock, slowly, ow, fuck, fuck—okay now it should be line up to my shoulder joint, so the humerus will—will pop back in.”
"I think we already did that, John. She sleeps right below us and they hired an architect who likes thin, cheap building material. And obviously since she called she's still quite alive, so she seems to be made of stronger stuff than you give her credit for."
A large, calloused hand grabs him under the arm and hauls him to his feet, but something’s wrong. He feels as if he’s standing on a wave, the ground churning beneath him like he will never have steady footing, like he is constantly in a state of losing his balance, stepping down on that imagined stair into nothingness.
The fight seems to leave John for a moment and it's all Sherlock needs to lift him over the rim of the tub, spilling water onto the floor as John sinks into the warm bath. Sherlock's hand comes to support his head, the other trying to hold him down.
The last of the sun was dying out as the battalion crested over the snowy hill; the sun set early this far north, and darkness reigned more often than not.
“You’ve been feeding him.” He said darkly. Sherlock didn’t answer, and he strode up to his brother, yanking his arm up so he could see the damning marks: two puncture wounds, right at the wrist, unhealed. “You bloody idiot,” he hissed, “do you know what you’ve done?”
The floors of the apartment rattled as a train arrived in the station, making the crockery clatter in their racks and the table creak.
“I wouldn’t have known — that, I think, is the cruellest thing you could do to me. Leaving me in the dark, without warning. Proving to me that brilliance had blind spots, and no amount of intelligence would bring you back because I was the one who allowed you fall away.”
His gaze sweeps over her and she gets the feeling that he can see through her. That he knows. He must. Oh God, he knows.
Sherlock doesn’t turn at the voice. He doesn’t need or feel the proclivity to. This water must be the only thing that sees his face.
Talking, yes. Talking was good. Talking would keep John breathing longer. He wished he was certain that what he was saying had validity, but he was about to find out.
Alkaev doesn’t turn as they cross the threshold, his back to them and his head bent over to look at something.
Mycroft slides the compartment door open and politely waits for an elderly couple to pass by before he steps into the narrow hallway. Cigarette smoke lingers around the ceiling lights like moths to flame, the sweet warm smell of clove and tobacco lingering around the smoking passengers.
"Angelo!" Sherlock called as the man in question returned with a fresh drink. "What do you have on the menu tonight?"
“Do you know,” The voice starts again, “that there is a special room in an American university, in Minnesota I believe. It’s an anechoic chamber. You know this word? Anechoic?”
. Slay the beast. I know this world, I have been hurt by it as you have, and more than just the scars on our shoulders or the bullets inside us. Our being here is a hydra, a many-headed monster. We think we win, and we do not. We think everything is over, and the world still turns. You must fight this as you would anything else. You are not alone. You have me. And I am not alone, for I have you. A hydra surely cannot survive two swords in its neck at once, yes? And once we find Sherlock, we will have three, and your beast will be dead.”
', which is underlined by a thicker stroke of something grey that appears fine and gritty, almost like sand.
“Someone started a forum after you—after your fall. I didn’t read much of it at first until it started popping up more and more. People other than myself believed in you, believed that you were still out there, and I didn’t want to keep fooling myself. I’d seen the blood and…felt your wrist.” John swallows roughly, taking a sip of tea to mask it. “But one day I found myself browsing it, and when I checked the time it’d been three hours since I started. Then I went back the next day, and the next. People kept saying they’d seen you out on the street or in a coffee shop or playing third seat cello in the London Philharmonic—”
"Ako želite da živite, zaboravi moje lice." The boy smiled, as if he wasn't pointing a gun at her. "Understand?"
“Uh, it was a pretty random meeting, just one of those things, you know? I was driving a backroad round midnight and I saw him pulled over with his hood up, so I stopped to help him.”
"Are you alright?" Sherlock asks, concern gleaning in his tone, yet he makes no move to help John up. Is he afraid of touching him? Have they reverted back to primary school and John has been infected with cooties?
He should have seen this. He should have known. Should have listened to his gut, to that crawling feeling he got when he came in. But even then, Sherlock and Lestrade already drunk the spiked tea, and he’d have no more of an idea what to do with two unconscious men on the streets of London as he did now—
“I’m sorry I didn’t come in today.” Molly says finally, quietly, to the room, her voice magnified by the stillness of the hour.
, which was both normal and unusual. He looked like a house of cards about to fold in on itself, trembling and fragile. He was staring at John but his mind was miles away. He could have been staring at a pile of stones for all he knew.
"Sherlock," John's voice brought him back. "Just go, go and be careful. We'll be alright, I promise. Here—" John handed him the gun that he had taken from one of the dead men before he shot them.
One looked up as they passed, rasping and raising a hand to paw weakly at the air, as if asking for help. John stopped, tensing as if he might attend to him, that time-worn reflex of a healer. Before he could move, Sherlock laid a hand on his shoulder.
“Of the two of us, I am the one who has more room to be…let’s say flexible in the work. Pulling you out of Petrograd was a mistake, although I do agree that you can’t go back, not with the current political climate…”
They watch in silence as Sherlock sets the half-empty glass on the nightstand, the other hand out of view, stroking back John’s hair, murmuring things that can’t be heard past the threshold.

No, no, this is much more interesting. Moriarty has no appeal to him anymore, not since he strapped John to enough semtex to level a building and Sherlock is quite sure that he is, with utter certainty, very, very dead, his loathsome body rotting in the shallow grave it deserves.
person. There were things she was involved with—things she let herself get pulled into that she thought we'd hate her for…she said there are things about me…she said even Molly doesn't know me."
love each other, and that was most certainly not John or Sherlock since they had many things to do like solve crimes and shoot people and snog, if he could address it so simply. Loving each other was almost an afterthought, something they did alone after the adrenalin had worn off and the danger was over and they were mending their wounds.
“No,” John sighs, pinching his nose, “I—the look on your face, in Stockholm. When you saw me. It was so clear that I wasn’t in any plan you’d had until then. I wasn’t supposed to be there, and, to me, neither were you. We were supposed to be together, in London, living out our lives and all that comes with sharing a flat with you. I was supposed to be convincing you to buy the milk or label your experiments or running after criminals with you, not punching you so hard you fainted.”
Toying with her pencil, Molly glances back, to the corner where Will sits. Their eyes meet and together they look down at the empty desk.
“I can’t say I was surprised.” Moriarty raised an eyebrow. “You fell much faster than I had anticipated.”
He found himself banging against the door with a strength he didn't know he had until it ripped from its hinges and he was scrambling upwards in a mad dash to the foyer.
"Moriarty was never the greatest threat to our happiness," John said, shaking his head. "I was. You were. We both are."
What had happened here, in all regards, had been an unforeseen and unexpected affair, one whose strength he had not anticipated. He sighed, a long, low exhale.
He rounds the corner and heads to the long table at the end of the hall that Sherlock sits at, staring at his laptop with wide eyes.
“Sherlock.” John said lowly, and he forced himself to look where John had focused his attention: the white figure, unseen by mortal eyes as it skirted the walls like a crawling bug over the meandering, intoxicated crowd, no more aware of the danger than they currently were of their own feet, judging by the state of them. It disappeared into a narrow alley and they darted over, standing side by side at the lip of the darkness.
"Do you want anything else?" He asks as Sherlock puts the plate in the sink. "Some pasta, maybe? Or an apple? I think we've got some Thai left—"
and…all else. My family, we Croatian by blood, so we hide in the hills, away from fighting. This is why my home there. Mikheia, his family Russian, so they go too. The VRS,  they bomb markets, they kill woman and rape too, babies die…we thought war would not come back after Stalin
As he woke, alone in that grey dawn, chest slick with cold sweat, a thought lingered in his startled mind.
“He’s been sick.” John says, hands on his hips. “Very sick. I broke one of his paws, but I managed to fix most of the damage.”
"By the dresser." Sherlock said lazily, rolling onto his back and spreading all of his limbs over the bed. "You could just go down as you are, you know."
As he raced through the dark halls, adrenaline pumped through him like liquid sunlight, brightening his blood until his heart was bursting like an imploding supernova with every beat. He was moving in hyper-time, no longer noticing the cold pain that pervaded every crevice of his body or the sudden dizziness that crashed onto him in waves, like he was being pushed and battered in the pull of a riptide.
It’s the sound of the drill that brings him fully to attention. There’s a soft laugh in front of him, but he doesn’t need to open his eyes to know they’ve bagged him. The burlap warms with each breath.
A family of four: man and woman, teenaged son and older daughter. Three tables back. Dutch. Tourists.
“Why?” Sherlock asked quietly. “I thought…I thought when I got better you might—” Might what? Forgive him? Forget what he’d done? “I thought we would be like it was.”
Their loss of clothes makes little difference in a heat so intense it made Sherlock's own skin feel saturated and heavy.
He needed to stop thinking about this. He was tired, he was crashing off adrenaline and shock and he was possibly feverish judging by the burn of the wounds on his back. The hospital had given him a few antibiotics and painkillers, but he hadn't wanted to tempt fate (or have any addictive substances around Sherlock) and only took the minimum amount.
Mycroft hummed, leaning in to peer into the wound, drawn open carefully. It looked, to him, as if it were healing, slowly but surely; a good sign. He washed the scalpel once more to ensure that even the smallest splinter of wood was removed before crouching to look at a different angle.
“Not until you left, I didn’t. But between leaving Norway and seeing you again in Algiers I did. Why wouldn’t I? You remember what I told you I was like before we met – even Mycroft couldn’t help me. I do not pretend to be a good man; I don’t know if I will ever be one. You make me want to want it, and when you’re gone I have nothing to serve as a reminder.”
"John!" He burst into the foyer, sliding over the previously shed blood that had trickled in from the den. As he breathed in, he smelled a hot, pervading, metallic scent, thick with iron.
Sherlock stopped his motions, tucking one end of the unfinished dressing in so it wouldn't fall out while he thought.
She paused, considering, before nodding and excusing herself. Soon the sound of running water flowed through the suite.
Mycroft stays. He lifts Sherlock's unconscious form to the sofa, tucks him under a blanket their grandmother made, and watches over him the rest of the night.
Alkaev nods, returning Mycroft’s grim smile which slides off his face as he sees Sherlock’s meagre parody. Sherlock supposes it must look patronising to him. It probably is, if he cared enough to think about it.
John is just fastening the pin in his bandages when Georgiy returns, shedding his outer layers quickly in the smoky heat of the cottage. As John watches, he slowly kneels down on the floor in front of the fireplace and takes out a pocketknife, loosening a rattling floorboard and setting it aside. He reaches down until his arm disappears and comes up with a dusty dark bottle, thoroughly examined by Sasha’s wet busy nose as he raises himself back up and replaces the floorboard.
