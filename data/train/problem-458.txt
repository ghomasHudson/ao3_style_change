She was called Boudica, apparently. John couldn’t really argue with that. She was a warrior all right. Some nights he thought she might kill him in his sleep. Sherlock tended to shorten it to “Bea”. John thought “Dick” was a bit more appropriate.
'Superficial.' Sherlock whispered, his gaze skimming the aquarium glass, taking in the reflections more than the fish beyond. 'Go deeper.'
Sherlock hesitated, his mind whirling as, all the while, a timer in the back of his head ticked down. Mycroft could only guarantee the sanctity of the line for ninety seconds at a time, and that narrow window of opportunity was quickly closing. 'I doubt they will try again tonight. I'll call you in an hour or two, once I have a solid notion of how to proceed.'
Sherlock looked John up and down, reading every tell-tale sign of anxiety that gilded his frame. His hands clenched into nervous fists, and he kept shifting his weight, battle-ready even now. That expressive face sagged beneath the burden of the past few days, and John's body practically hummed with tension.
'Did you enjoy your korma?' Sherlock purred, stretching in a way that made John's blood turn sluggish with lust. 'And the five beers beforehand?'
The kiss of life.
He narrowed his eyes, wishing he could read the whirl of her thoughts. She could not be this naïve. He understood the notion of a sunken cost fallacy, but surely she could be brought to see reason? 'Perhaps there is an alternative. Talk to Mycroft: arrange asylum. We can get you out of the country and away from Harmattan. We can put together a new life for you, one that is safe from their reach.'
‘You didn’t answer,’ he croaked. ‘What are you?’
'How she came upon this information, I cannot be sure. Some of what I've unearthed is blatant: contact details and blackmail opportunities. Others appear to be locations: perhaps bank deposit boxes containing evidence.' He rolled his shoulders in a shrug, propping his palms on the kitchen surface and leaning forward, looming over the video call as if he could impinge his will on Mycroft through the screen. 'I have not decoded even a fraction of it. If it's all the same – all intelligence such as this...'
'Why would I tell you that?' Mary poked him in the back with the gun, urging him onwards. 'We're somewhere quiet. That's all you need to know.'
There was no point talking to him when he was like this. John had tried before. The result was curt, one-word answers that got him nowhere. When it came to information, Sherlock was like a sponge, and in the end, there was only so much even he could take in without getting saturated. He'd be in his mind palace before John had even got his coat off, of that he was sure.
Sherlock had insisted they both retrieve the food; it maximised their chances of being seen. They wanted news of their return to spread to the right ears, and by the time they pulled up at Baker Street, John knew that more than one of Sherlock's network had caught sight of him through the car's open window. They would be spreading the whispers around the city like wildfire. Honestly, they'd be lucky for the chance to eat their takeaway at this rate.
Now, after all they had been through, all that John suffered in his absence, Sherlock had found the evidence he needed. In the unguarded moments of the past few days, John had exposed his feelings to Sherlock. Unintentional it may have been, but that did not make the revelations any less valuable in Sherlock's eyes. If anything, it made them more precious. All possibility of guile was stripped away to leave nothing but the naked truth.
The knife scraped over the toast, a metronome for his considerations. It would help if he could deduce more about John's state of mind, but the lingering remnants of illness overshadowed all other deductions, writ too broad across John's body for him to make out the minutiae beneath.
John raised an eyebrow, deliberately not glancing in Sherlock’s direction. He could just say no outright. It’s what his mum would have done. Her word was law, and once a choice was made it stayed that way, but that wasn’t how he did things.
He enunciated the last “t” as he brought himself to a halt at John’s side, his body completely at ease as their shoulders brushed. ‘Nice try, but I’m afraid you’re fooling no one. You wanted to look as if you had fallen upon hard times when, in fact, I doubt nothing could be further from the truth. You’re doing very well for yourself. I suspect you are merely bored.’
He turned, picking her up and depositing her into John's lap. Immediately, John's arms cradled his daughter, holding her close and tight, offering the physical reassurance he himself would never accept.
He lowered his hands, gesturing through to the kitchen. 'It could be that I'm entirely wrong in my assessment that Mary is O Dio. Or, alternatively, the name may apply to more than one individual, but seeing these as well....'
Sherlock blinked. 'No, of course not.'
‘Looks like she met her match,’ Anderson muttered from where he stood, just loud enough to be heard. ‘She’s definitely not the winner of this fight.’
‘A puppy is a huge amount of work, Rosie, love. They need to be trained and fe. They need walking all the time. They need space…’ John gestured to 221B meaningfully. God, he’d love to get a nice semi with a bit of garden, but this was London. He’d have to be a millionaire, and besides, he liked the flat. It was home. Leaving it felt…. Wrong.
Yet there was nothing intrusive or uncomfortable about John's familiar presence. In fact, it would have been positively comforting if not for the raw-edged heat that seemed to blast itself from John's skin like he was some kind of human furnace. Sherlock could almost believe that if he flicked water on him it would evaporate in a burst of steam.
'Near constant surveillance on your apartment and outside your work, plus another individual who follows you en-route,' Sherlock said, quick and informative. 'Not my people, nor Mycroft's. It became obvious shortly after Mary...' Sherlock trailed off, and John could hear the unspoken "died" hovering on the line. 'After Mary.'
John could not say how long he stood there; long enough for a gloss of sweat to gather upon Sherlock's brow. He lingered, captivated, and only a glimmer of movement on the other side of the room tore his attention away.
'John, I need you to listen to me.' Tension underpinned Sherlock's words, thrumming beneath them in a way that made John's skin prickle with awareness. 'Your temperature's risen. You're delirious. Do you understand?'
Sherlock must have read something in his face, or perhaps he simply anticipated the inevitable collapse of John's restraint. The crutches clattered on the floor as he cast them off, reaching instead with both arms to brace John's weight and pull him close.
'I can at least move the telly in for you. The cables are long enough to bear it. I always buy extra.'
Not a single denial slipped free from her. There were no cries of "Impossible!" Instead, Norbury looked as if she had been punched in the gut, robbed of air and confidence in one fell swoop.
'She is safe.
It worked. Sherlock had hoped that John would latch onto the distraction with determination, if not enthusiasm, and he had been correct. Once the task had been brought to his attention, John threw himself into the job, ticking things off on his fingers even as he eyed the flat with a critical glare. 'Socket covers, cupboard locks, a fire screen and multiple baby gates.' John sighed, scrubbing his hand through his hair before hesitating. 'I'll need to talk to Mrs Hudson; make sure she's all right with all this.'
This time, he faced not the centre of the bed, but outwards, half his face obscured by the swell of the pillow. His body curved into a cove of flesh, his knees a bare handspan away from Sherlock's shoulders. John’s hand shifted, freeing his wrist from Sherlock’s grasp only to entwine their fingers.
John winced, wondering what he could say that would not make it sound like he was losing his marbles. 'It's just a feeling. The first time was at Mary's – at the graveyard. I shook it off and ignored it, but recently I've noticed it when I'm just out shopping or in the park with Rosie.'
If he had to guess, they belonged to a pair people of medium height and weight. One moved with purpose, but the other shuffled their feet. Reluctant, perhaps, or possibly impeded by an injury. With only sound to go on, there were a myriad of theories racing through his head, but no firm conclusions. All Sherlock could do was tense, shifting his body around and curling his knees up to his chest, bracing himself to lash out.
'I forgive you,' Sherlock murmured against the heat of John's mouth, speaking it like a vow into John's lips before sealing it there with a soft, hopeful kiss.
Sherlock leaned against the wall of the corridor, his mind racing. He did not want to be honest for fear that it might make John turn his back for good, and yet lying, even by omission, felt like too much of a breach of trust after all Mary's deceit. John did not deserve to suffer for that, even if the truth was a terrifying prospect.
'Perhaps you did not notice the balance shift. Mary is good at being subtle. She would have done it slowly. Maybe you paid attention when you realised it had become cooperative: the two of you equals. After all, Mary's a clever woman, entrenched in a world where she understands the value of knowledge. She had the skills, and you had the connections.
Well, John wasn't about to argue with that. 'What about you?'
‘I can’t answer them. Not here. We need to get back to Baker Street.’
And what did that make him?
'Oh, John. What are your symptoms?' She listened as he rambled through the same thing he'd described to Sherlock, making appropriate noises of sympathy. 'Do you have everything you need? Food? Medication?'
Norbury's mask was slipping, even he could see that. The sharp lines of confident indifference drained from her features, but what lay beneath was not the fear he expected. Instead, she seemed determined.
'Your fever rose, then broke. You were delirious. You – you didn't seem to recognise where you were,' Sherlock explained, his voice void of all judgement. Only a tiny shiver beneath his words suggested he was anything other than composed, and John forced himself to untangle the knotted mass of his recent memories.
He pursed his lips, ignoring the way the paper shook in his grasp. The words seared themselves into his brain with each pass of his gaze. The confines of the taxi pressed around him, claustrophobic. He tore his eyes away, folding the page and tucking it back into his pocket as he waited for Baker Street to come into view.
Rosie sat silent in John's arms as he paced back and forth across the living room, needing to burn off some of the roiling emotion seething in his veins. Maybe it would be better if he put her down, but right now it felt like she was the only thing stopping him from flying apart at the seams.
Sherlock watched him, his expression unreadable. Of course, to Sherlock, Mary was intrinsically tied up with AGRA. He had not been privy to many of John and Mary's quiet moments. He had not been involved in the relationship they had built, first in ignorance, and then in spite of all the secrets. There had been a friendship between them though, and John wondered how much Sherlock himself missed her. How much of the strain he could see etching Sherlock's features was because of Mary's death, and how much was because of John's distance?
'I don't understand.'  Mary's lips twisted upwards at their corners, but the smile didn't reach her eyes.
He'd loved the idea of Mary.
The rumbling roar of an engine filled his ears, the pitch suggesting a horsepower comparable to a truck or other medium-sized vehicle. It made sense; he could feel nothing around him, no seats or even carpeting. Most likely mode of transport? A transit van. They were everywhere in London and far from remarkable. The question was, where were they taking him?
He could, of course, put the bottle back and say nothing, but where was the fun in that? He had the report he’d come for. He might as well put Mycroft on the back foot before he left.
John scowled, shaking his head. 'I left it behind: didn't trust it not to be bugged or have a tracker installed or something. Why?'
John growled, shaking his head as he lowered the gun and took a step forward, waving it vaguely as he gesticulated. ‘Yeah, no. All right, yeah, but Fae’s one thing. I can see how a few might linger on, causing trouble. There’s enough humans around with a little bit too much power to not have a bit of Fae blood in them, but this? You?’
'So do I,' Sherlock promised. 'You'll get me the report?'
'You really think this will help?' John asked, standing back at the room's edge so as not to get in Sherlock's way.
'You talk about her like she's the enemy.'
Sherlock swallowed, struggling to meet her gaze. The words boiled in his throat, but he could not find it in him to give them voice, not to Mary.
‘Not for me.’ Sherlock raised a hand to call a taxi, his mouth twisting in a wry smile as he shook his head. Pale eyes sparkled, making John’s stomach swoop and his heart thud in his chest. ‘For us.’
John busied himself with settling Rosie in her bouncy chair, placing it on the floor and setting up various toys. She was almost too big for it, but since she was still hit-and-miss with sitting up unaided, he was happy to let her rock herself in the springy seat. Safely strapped in, she wouldn't escape in a hurry, and it was stable enough not to fall over.
Strings of fairy lights danced in the breeze and tiny solar lamps glowed in the flowerbeds, twinkling like fireflies amidst the stirring foliage. The red wine on Sherlock’s tongue carried a hint of spice, its heady flavour intoxicating and moreish as he lounged on one of the garden chairs.
‘Another beer?’
Even if it wasn't some convoluted plot like Sherlock’s leap from Bart’s, there was still a very good chance that the people watching him were doing so because of one of Sherlock's cases. Maybe he'd pissed off the wrong person, or caught the attention of yet another criminal mastermind. Maybe the observers were foot soldiers, examining the lay of the land, and John – in his self-enforced isolation – made an easy target. Perhaps he was being assessed, his worth measured by some unknown criteria...
There were few people in the world he would consider worthy of such attention, but John was one of them.
His heart hammered in his throat, every pulse threatening to choke him as the silence settled around them anew. His muscles quivered with tension, as if he were a violin string stretched too tight, awaiting the conductor's guidance towards a symphony or a dirge.
Hadn't that been his mantra since he got back to London, at least where John and Mary were concerned? Step-by-step, day-by-day, he had turned a blind eye, pretending he couldn't see the secrets they both wore like a shroud.
Mycroft wrinkled his nose, defying all of Sherlock's expectations and taking a healthy gulp of the drink in his hand. He looked uncomfortable in his three-piece suit, as if he were girding his loins to broach an unpleasant subject. 'What about Mary Morstan?
Sherlock stretched out a hand, tweaking the pages free from Mycroft's grasp. 'You think they can help?'
He bumped his shoulder into Sherlock’s arm, smiling as those interstellar eyes came back down to earth.
‘Until she was fencing with her murderer,’ Anderson pointed out, his hands shifting around his kit.
She threw her phone down on top of the bloody clothes, shaking her head as the paramedic offered a replacement. She'd get her own, one she knew had not been tampered with. The last thing she needed was Sherlock Holmes and another GPS device blowing this all away.
‘Ugh. Breathing’s boring.’
Overhead, the sun broke through the clouds, turning the puddles to mirrors and decking the grass in diamonds. John lifted his face to its subtle warmth and let out a breath it felt like he had been holding ever since Sherlock fell from Bart’s.
'No. Harmattan is different. They're a group of mercenaries associated with no known political power. I suspect any other buyers Mary found were tied to governments and influential figures. As such, they would have other avenues available to them to acquire information, such as their own secret services.’
His voice shook around the words, excitement and need tangling in his throat. It was nothing they had not done before. He and Sherlock had taken each other every-which-way, in each other and not. Today, however, it felt like a bone deep urge.
When Rosie had first lifted her arms to him, rather than John – had clutched at him with hands sticky with who-knew-what – Sherlock had not even hesitated. He had scooped her up, not even breaking the flow of his deductions as Greg tried not to grin like a fool.
Now she lay not two months in the ground and John had already found his way back to Sherlock's side.
Sherlock's entire body buzzed with awareness. It felt like all the times when they had caught one another's eye, laughing and breathless in the wake of some case, the turn of a moment stretching into an eternity that contained everything unspoken.
'Could have fooled me,' John muttered, not caring if he was being unkind. The logical part of him knew that Mycroft was right. He had taken endless precautions to keep Rosie out of harm’s way, but that didn't mean John had to like it. In particular, the bit where he didn't even know where Rosie was going chafed against his raw nerves. 'I hate this.'
'Not yet. That doesn't show up until later. It's – it's just a headache. Muscle aches. I'm tired and I've got no appetite. A bit of sleep will sort me out, I'm sure.' John tried to smile, but it felt more like a wound on his face than anything else, so he let it fall away. ‘So far, it's not so bad. I've had 'flu worse.'
No, John was a man who focussed on action and solutions. He needed the answers that Sherlock had yet to provide, and every moment of delay only made his failure feel that much more intense. There was nothing he could do to bring Mary back or replace the possessions and memories John and Rosie had lost in the fire. The only thing he was good for was unravelling the mystery that surrounded their lives.
He thought of the gun, locked away upstairs and out of his reach. He'd fought off the temptation to carry it with him. Out on the street the risk of discovery was too great, and at home, he had Rosie to consider. He would never forgive himself if a stray bullet or a misfire harmed his little girl.
Norbury sucked in a breath but remained silent, her eyes burning.
And yet he kept thinking of the observers he had seen watching John and Rosie, and how unimpressive he had found their skills. From everything he knew about Harmattan, he had anticipated something more professional. While the resources at their disposal had indicated that they had plenty of cash behind them, he would have expected their actual operations to be more covert. Instead, they had been visible to anyone who thought to look twice.
‘Oh, are you playing?’ John’s smile wobbled as he shrugged off his coat. ‘Or just scratching at it?’
'No, Sherlock. Just... no. Solve this so Rosie and I can get back to our lives. Make it the last thing you do for us. Then we can all be happy.'
With a start, he realised they'd come to a halt outside a door. Stained glass decorated it, obscuring the view within, but a gleaming plaque indicated they'd reached their destination. 'Sorry, I was...' He gave a wry smile.  'Nothing. Nothing important. Just thinking. Carry on.'
'Here.' Sherlock chucked him a precious bottle of sanitiser, watching as John cleaned his hands with the efficient movements of habit. As soon as he was done, he clipped the digital oximeter to John's finger, allowing it time to settle as he took John's temperature again.
She looked good, for a dead woman, John thought, his teeth clenched hard enough to crack. Just when they – he and Sherlock and Rosie – had found some kind of balance in their lives, she turned up again to ruin it all.
Except, even now, with the claim of “Aethereon” rattling around his head like a pinball, he couldn’t turn his back and walk away. Not anymore.
‘Eat up,’ Molly urged, handing him a plate of morsels. Once, she would have been flustered by the interaction. Now, though, she just topped up his wineglass and plonked herself down in the chair to his right. Her dangly earrings caught the meagre light: a flash of confidence amidst the fall of her hair. ‘John said you’d not had any dinner.’
John pulled a face. At the time, he had not questioned the Moroccan police officer shooting Ajay in the back: it had all been over so quickly. Had Mary been behind that, too? Had she known that Ajay could have uncovered the truth of Amo and Odio?
'Maybe I can just sleep on the sofa?'
He trailed off, as unable to label John’s mood as John was himself. Despondent, maybe. Cynical. Resigned. A mixture of all three.
'Or you.' Sherlock shrugged as she spun around, her hands clenched into fists at her side. 'What was the message, Mary?'
Sherlock said nothing. Working through the likely permutations of Mary's actions was one thing, but he could not speak for her emotional motivations. John claimed that what he had done when he leapt from the rooftop of Bart's was a different matter, and perhaps in some ways it was, but the end result was the same. He had been gone for almost two years, and though he doubted John had ever cared for Sherlock as he had for Mary, there were still undeniable parallels.
John admired the sharpness of his cheekbones and the striking contrast of his curls, the fullness of the lips and strength of his shoulders. He looked like a bloody work of art: one that John could touch.
He watched her scoop up the phone once more, jabbing a button with her thumb and smiling, honey-sweet, as the line connected. 'Mycroft, don't talk. Just listen. Haversham airfield. Bring me what I want. No tricks, no games. The splinter group are already on their way. If they arrive before you do, then I'm afraid Sherlock becomes nothing more than a liability.' She paused, raising an eyebrow in Sherlock's direction. 'He's still alive. For now. Don't make me regret that decision.'
‘Is the pain all right?’
'So how do we prove it?' John shifted, his eyes narrowed and his chin lifted, a long-absent spark of determination gleaming in his eyes.
time.
The cockatoo screeched, flaring its crest and fixing them both with a beady stare as it uttered the one word that Sherlock had thankfully spared them.
His house was gone, and Baker Street could be next.
'I can't let that happen.'
They said their farewells as John disconnected the call, dropping Sherlock's phone into the cup holder near the gear stick and stretching out the ache in his left thigh. 'You believe they'll go for Molly?'
The flat felt like he did: purposeless. Sherlock had defined them both – Baker Street and blogger alike. Now, he wasn’t ever coming back, and where did that leave them? How could he –? What was he meant to–?
'Still nothing from Mycroft?' John checked over the grass with a wary eye before setting Rosie down. He sat near her with much grunting and knee-clicking, keeping watch in case she started to shove soil and leaves in her mouth. It wouldn't hurt her if she did, Sherlock mused, but he recalled from his own childhood that parents tended to get upset about that kind of thing.
Honestly, John couldn't remember the last time he'd seen Greg so uncertain about anything. He reached for his patience, determined to wait it out. He knew Greg, knew he was more brave than he was sensible. He'd spit it out sooner or later.
B xxx
John huffed a mirthless laugh at that blatant understatement. Mycroft was right. He doubted Mary would have shared her ideas with Harmattan. Even as a member of AGRA, she had always been playing her own game. It was safe to say that cooperation did not come easily to her. She had made that obvious when she tried to solve the Magnusson problem without assistance. 'So, what's the plan? We follow the splinter group to Mary and then... what?'
‘Shut your mouth,’ John whispered, a grin playing on his lips as Greg halted on the threshold of 221B, the report in his hand completely forgotten. ‘Want me to take that?’
John was always eager to use dashes in his work to bring a sense of immediacy, but in a handwritten message such as this they were both proliferous and out of place. Now they hoarded Sherlock's attention, clamouring for his focus even as he struggled to understand their relevance.
And if Sherlock were to find the answers he needed to ensure John’s safety, then he would need to unearth every single one.
'Quite so, though not in the manner we had anticipated. Their absence here was an unexpected blessing, but it seems they were merely gathering nearby resources.' Even as Mycroft spoke, the distant thrum of a helicopter echoed through the air. 'We need to evacuate the area. They have us outgunned.'
She had. He could have reached out and touched her. Yet memory, even his, could be fallible, especially during moments of high-stress. What he recalled may not be what he perceived, and what he had seen might not have been true. He had to be sure, for John's sake.
He pulled out a card. Ludicrously expensive silk-coated paper stock. It reeked of luxury: something far beyond Lestrade’s means. Sherlock’s too, if he were honest. Not that he’d likely ever have need for these particular services.
‘It’s all right, John.’
Sherlock lay upon the nest of their bed, his dark tail a sinuous whip of fur over the plumpness of his bare arse and the curve of his thigh. One ear twitched against the pillow, acknowledging John's presence as a slow smile curved that full mouth. Vivid eyes met his gaze, one eyebrow arched in invitation as John grinned and toed off his boots.
‘Hah, you’re one to talk. You’ve known him longer than me, and you’re still friends with him.’
Well, that was where John came in.
Sherlock sighed, not a sound of impatience, but regret. John wondered how many times Sherlock had asked himself the same question while he was gone. How many times had he sat alone in far-off lands, debating everything that had led them to that point?
He had another case to solve.
That was what they had, what they shared, and what they both stood to lose if he had read the situation incorrectly. Oh, a romantic relationship had been on John's mind when they first met, despite his ineffectual denials. It had lingered, well-hidden, through the years since, surviving even when, in John's view at least, Sherlock himself had not.
John blinked himself back to his meal, realising he'd been sitting with his fork halfway to his mouth. With a grunt, he devoured some baked beans before focussing on Sherlock's face. 'Anything?'
Christmas had been a bit of a non-event until Rosie came along. He had celebrated it out of habit, more than anything. Now that there was a small human being to spoil absolutely rotten, it seemed that everyone they knew was thrusting brightly coloured gifts in their direction.
Sherlock grimaced into his coffee cup, setting the drink aside and shoving his book in the satchel slung over the back of his chair. Pulling it onto his shoulder, he sauntered from the cafe, resisting the urge to lift his hand for a cab. He was a student, after all. Better to cling to the illusion that money was tight.
‘It wasn’t really bollocks, was it?’ He narrowed his eyes and peered up into Sherlock’s face, feeling a ridiculous surge of guilt for doubting him.
His hands tightened around the steering wheel, white-knuckled. It would be easy to take an abrupt turn and see if they gave chase or fell behind. The temptation thudded in his ears and his foot twitched on the accelerator, but he fought off the urge.
'Probably both. Logically, someone should be watching Baker Street. It's the only bolthole they have left open for you in London after burning down your home. Once they see that we have returned...' Sherlock trailed off with a shrug. 'I imagine they will act quickly.'
'Are you saying you'll help me?' Mary scoffed, shaking her head. 'You must think I was born yesterday, Sherlock. Why would you bother? As you said before, what's in it for you?'
'Fair enough.' John tucked the notion away, respecting Greg's wishes. Half of him was tempted to ask Sherlock if he'd noticed anything, but that felt like cheating. Besides, even if he had, Sherlock would probably have deemed it irrelevant and forgotten it a moment later. 'Send me a text tomorrow with your budget and any essentials. We'll see what we can rustle up.'
'Perhaps,' Mycroft acknowledged, 'but he could not out-run the debris, of which there was a significant amount. Large, high velocity projectiles... I'm sure I do not need to explain further? If you wanted Doctor Watson to be part of this little charade, you should have been more careful. I arrived too late at the scene to do more than recover his phone and tidy up some of the mess you left behind. Now tell me, where is Sherlock?'
With a sigh, he got to his feet, checking the clock before spurring himself into action. He would begin his infiltration at five a.m., giving him plenty of time to search the suspect's premises before Mycroft whisked John away and his distraction became a necessity. In the meantime, there was much to do, least of all breaking the news of a hasty departure to John.
'I'm sure she was. Mary may have lied about many things, John, but she loved you. I doubt she would ever willingly put you or Rosie in danger.'
‘They’re going to get you something big,’ he whispered. ‘Not said what it is yet, though.’
He couldn’t say what made him do it. Some instinct, perhaps. A desperate need to hold on to Sherlock, who always seemed to be on the brink of leaving. With a quick twist, he pulled his jacket free and grabbed Sherlock’s hand, matching his stride as their fingers entwined.
'I'm fine.'
'I thought if I took myself out of the picture while Norbury went to jail, that would be the end of it.'
'As if it was ever that to start with. Just... be careful, all right?'
Holmes – can only guarantee so much.' Her lips twisted in a grimace, as if it upset her to admit her boss' limitations.
'I have nothing to say to you.'
As for the situation in Baker Street, Mycroft knew better than to interfere.
Oh, the others would believe it well enough. Donovan and Anderson didn’t have the patience to look behind the meticulous mask Sherlock showed the world. Hell, Greg only knew the truth because Mycroft had told him – warned him more like.
He reached out, accepting the toast that John still held out like a grudging peace offering and taking a bite. It was a silent promise and, in years to come, Sherlock would see it for the turning point it truly was.
Rosie.
The space was cramped and claustrophobic, and John pulled a face as he surveyed the waist-high tunnels in the torch light. He and Sherlock had trekked through London's sewers more times than he cared to remember, but this was a different matter. In the middle of the capital, it was like strolling along boulevards. Here, he suspected they would have to crawl.
He took a deep breath, forcing the words up his throat and through his lips, speaking his truth with as much certainty as he could muster. 'But if you ever wanted to develop our relationship further, I would leap at the chance.'
Closing his eyes, Sherlock steepled his fingers in front of his face, allowing his awareness to plummet into the depths of his Mind Palace. He recalled Mary as he had first known her: a glossy, wax-work model of herself, shallow and benign. Ordinary in almost every way. It was a caricature, something Mary had carefully crafted to show the world, and it had worked. Even Sherlock had been fooled, at least for a little while.
His fingers had clenched upon waking, but Sherlock didn't stir. Those dark curls scribbled over the white sheets, and the nape of his neck lay exposed at the top of his collar. The twisted wreck of the duvet hid his face from view, and for one, awful minute, John wondered if Sherlock, too, had fallen ill.
''s a symptom,' he slurred, wrinkling his nose as he tried to get his tongue to work. 'Not a symptom. An effect. Vivid, weird dreams. Been reported a fair bit.'
Lestrade nodded. ‘It’s a theory. A better one than furries, anyway. We’ll check out Acacia Avenue. See what we can turn up. I hate the weird ones.’
Now, John had offered the perfect compromise: a sharing of Sherlock's king-size bed, easily big enough for two grown men. It was a practical suggestion, and Sherlock pushed away the small voice that uttered hopeful whispers of John's care into his ear. How easy it was to read meaning in gestures where none existed. They were flatmates and friends, forced into closer proximity by their circumstances. That was all.
'So what's it about?' John frowned, reading the Ionic script with nothing but bafflement.
'Thanks.'
It was one of the reasons he loved him.
He gripped the sink, swallowing hard as the emptiness of his flat clanged all around him. God, why was he even still here? Why had he stayed when Mary had the good sense to pack up and get out? She’d seen the writing on the wall – had realised she had no place in John’s story, not with Sherlock taking up all the pages. There was nothing left for him within these walls, so why did he stay?
In his youth, the idea of belonging anywhere had been frankly abhorrent. Now? Well, it had its advantages, and not just when it came to the Work.
'So, you reckon it's the gravestones we should be looking at?'
'Then my brother will confirm our story, at least if he knows what is good for him. There is a time for petty squabbles, and Mycroft is aware that this isn't it. Will you be all right with a late dinner?'
Even his mind was a fog of static – a calm pool on the surface full of dark undercurrents that tried to drag him down. He forced himself not to think: to return again and again to a state of numb emptiness. Right now, it was the only way he could make it through what remained of the day without falling apart.
His jumper covered up its bulk with ease, and the weight of it did something to steel his resolve. He sucked in a deep breath of the cold, exhaust-tinged air, putting his hands on his hips as he watched Sherlock amble around the car, his phone clamped to his ear.
'Then who? It's not Moriarty. This has none of his style, and I neutralised any affiliates who might seek revenge during my absence.'
The instant the latch of the back door popped, he rammed his feet full force into the panel. It whipped open, forcing a cry of pain from someone's throat. The sound of metal hitting flesh, meaty and unpleasant, reached his ears, and he bared his teeth in a snarl, peering at the bright square of daylight that he had revealed.
Relying on both John and Sherlock to be adequately distraught had been the biggest risk in this plan. They'd made the whole thing as believable as possible, her and Vivian, but there was still a chance one of them would figure out the deception.
He considered struggling, but the pistol to his brow was a fearsome chaperone. His feet may be untethered, but even if he landed a blow, there was no guarantee Mary would crumple, and he could neither pick up the gun himself nor remove it from play. No, Mary may be working alone, but she still had him outgunned, and he could not risk the bite of a bullet. Not if he wanted to find out what happened to John.
'That's the one. You've not got it from me so far, and you've not exactly been obeying social distancing. Not by a long shot.' He opened one eye again to give Sherlock a baleful, bleary glare. 'Rest, please? Here or somewhere else?'
to be done.
‘Ease. A high moisture environment: thus, the water was the easiest thing to manipulate.’
He vaulted back through the same window that had allowed him in, taking a moment to turn and inspect his handiwork. It would not take long for the flames to catch and spread. Already a haze of smoke filled his view, biting at his eyes. It would do. Besides, his actions were not the only prong in this attack. His homeless network would have had time to play their hand, to keep eyes on any watchers and ensure they were distracted: a convenient mugging here, a cry for help there... It would be enough.
'Fine,' he grumbled, grabbing his bag from where he had left it on the kitchen floor and padding through to Sherlock's room. It felt odd, being in this neat space: both familiar and alien all at once. The air still smelled faintly of dry cleaning and whatever Sherlock used in his hair: a fragrance that made John smile despite himself.
How long had he craved this? Not the mere equation of one body against another, pliant and willing, but John, specifically? He could not even begin to count the days, and now that he had him – had John, strong and yielding in equal turn in his arms – Sherlock could barely breathe for the sheer rightness of it all. This was the moment that brought his life into focus: the instant in which all the jagged, disparate parts of himself slotted into place.
Yet Greg still never saw Sherlock eat.
John did as he was asked, offering Sherlock the rectangle of plastic with the tiniest hint of a warning smile. 'Please don't buy anything dodgy on it? I don't need to deal with talking to the fraud department as well as everything else.'
'Yeah.' John let out a quivering sigh. 'Just –'
'Most of the files were simply details of AGRA. At first glance, I thought Mary was protecting herself: outlining previous missions and keeping an account of anything that went wrong in case she was ever brought up on charges. She needed something to prove she was acting on orders.'
He passed the test with flying colours, just as Sherlock knew he would.
Silently, Sherlock turned off to the left, melting into London’s crowds. The walk towards Diogenes was too long to consider, and once he was several streets away, Sherlock pulled off his glasses. Straightening from his youthful slouch made his back twinge, and he grimaced in discomfort as he raised his hand for a taxi.
John hunkered down by the hearth, getting the fire lit after a few false starts. Once a steady blaze burned in the grate, he made himself a cup of tea and picked up his Dan Brown book. The soft turn of pages and the crackle of the flames marked the passing afternoon. He got up now and then to make himself fresh tea, but otherwise enjoyed the peace.
'Hello, Bart's Mortuary.'
Frustration and anxiety were Sherlock's constant companions, and by the fifth day, those two emotions had replaced the bastions of his bones. He felt like a man made of nothing but sentiment, rubbed raw by the relentless waves of concern and the veils of helplessness that cocooned his every moment.
'Not for long.'
'Right.' Greg folded his arms, taking in the scene with an air of disbelief. 'I'll need statements –' He held up a hand as Sherlock sighed and rolled his eyes. '–but it can wait a day or so.' He tilted his head, his grin softening into something friendly and knowing. 'If that suits you, of course.'
The single word unfurled through the air, blooming like ink across a blank page, obliterating all before it. Anger pinched Mary's eyes and hardened the angle of her jaw. Her fingers stopped their fretful dance, falling unnaturally still. Yet it was not just Sherlock's casual dismissal of her excuses that upset her.
After months back in London, it felt as if he had truly come home.
'Less a theory with every passing moment,' Sherlock pointed out. 'You had to rid yourselves of the unwanted attention, or at least get the both of you to safety. That was the deal, was it not? You would go to jail, where they could not reach you, and Mary's "death" would remove her from the equation. Hence the performance at the aquarium.'
Rosie burbled in her arms, oblivious to the turmoil around her. Clean, well-fed and bright eyed, she clapped her chubby hands together at the sight of Sherlock, her little legs kicking as she giggled. Someone, at least, was happy to see him.
Her laugh was harsh and sharp, more a bark than anything. ‘Wanna bet?’
He was not an impartial observer; he knew that much. Whatever he and Mary had been to each other, he could not deny that he was emotionally invested. Perhaps he was seeing things that simply weren't there, painting Mary in sinister shades of his own imagination. Yet before he could stumble to his feet and seek Sherlock's opinion, something else caught his eye in another photograph. One of him and Rosie at the park.
'I don't know. There must have been, but even now I cannot see it. Moriarty was so thorough. So absolute. Every time I saw a glimmer of possibility in a different choice, he snuffed it out.' A sardonic huff of laughter escaped his chest. 'I stand by what I said back then: he was brilliant.'
'Yes. I can't make any guarantees, but with any luck Baker Street is secure from prying eyes and ears. How about you?'
'I thought you liked your flat?’
As if to prove his point, Sherlock’s phone signalled an incoming text. Mycroft did not need to be so crass as to read it over his brother’s shoulder to know that it was John. It was written in Sherlock’s face. Foul temper eased, giving way to that subtle, wry delight that suited him so well. His coat whirled as he scooped it up and flung it around his shoulders, a wounded bird made new and taking flight once more.
He let out a tight breath, closing his eyes and resisting the urge to get up and pace. Such restlessness would do him no good. Nothing could help him escape this. It did not matter how often he dove into his mind palace or how many times he examined every angle, he could not find a way back to what had been. Mary lay dead, and Sherlock was to blame.
He blinked as Sherlock's voice resonated through him. The warmth at his back resolved into Sherlock's long, lean frame. He sat behind John, supporting his slumped body against the wall of his chest. John lay in the vee of Sherlock's legs, Sherlock's thighs bracketing his hips as he sagged against him.
She pursed her lips, shrugging in a coy gesture of amusement. 'Sorry! I knew that wouldn't work. John might be a simple man at the best of times, but he knows me. Knows how to get to me and make me second-guess myself. Besides, as soon as your brother gave away his involvement in this whole affair, it all became painfully clear.'
'I should have expected this,' he murmured, guiding John into the armchair. Perhaps pacing would ease some of the nervous tension that thrummed through his body, but Sherlock wasn't certain that he would not simply collapse where he stood, his legs cut out from beneath him. 'I was so focussed on making sure you and Rosie were safe that I did not think to secure your home.'
221B had its charms, even if its central heating was temperamental and its old sash windows let in a draft. It had become his sanctuary, made all the more so by the man he shared it with. Oh, Sherlock was never going to be a peaceful, calming influence, but what use was that to John? That wasn't what he needed. Excitement alone wouldn't fulfil him either, not anymore.
'You need to understand that whoever has you under observation will notice a new phone if you use it where you might be seen. We cannot be sure what may cause them to escalate, and what form their escalation might take. Their motivations remain – veiled.' In her lap, her hand twitched, smoothing down the fabric of her skirt.
Sherlock.
'No.' Sherlock swung the Belstaff around his shoulders, slipping his arms into the sleeves as the wool settled around him. 'That's what Lestrade, Dimmock and their teams are here for. The refectory kitchens will still be open. We'll get you some lunch.'
That was an understatement. Their TV may be small, but there was a mare's nest of cables stuffed down behind it for use in experiments which Sherlock had yet to schedule. They might as well be used for their intended purpose before being sacrificed at the altar of knowledge. 'That'd be brilliant.'
'What do you want to watch?' John asked, smiling into his cup of tea as Sherlock shook his head.
'Your faith in me is misplaced.'
John sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. 'She needed your voice, Molly. She recorded the attack and played it back to us, making it sound like she had you hostage somewhere. She told me to come alone or...' He trailed off, not wanting to finish. Even now, he struggled to believe that the Mary he had known – that he had married – could be the same as the woman they currently faced. 'It was a distraction. Something to get me out of the way while she took Sherlock. She has him, but we don't know where she's taken him yet. Did you see or hear anything else? Anything that might tell us where she's gone?'
The single, whispered word heralded their arrival, and John let out a sigh of relief as one of the operatives climbed the ladder and eased the manhole cover aside, taking a moment to survey their surroundings before giving the all clear. John shifted his feet, waiting his turn before clambering up into the daylight. He kept low to the ground, stooping so he wouldn't be seen as he hunkered in the long grass.
'Superb.' Sherlock grumbled, not bothering to hide his impatience as the doctor rattled off warnings and instructions.
After a moment's thought, he tucked her blanket over her legs for extra warmth and retrieved her cuddly toy: an inadvisably rainbow coloured elephant. It was not beyond the realms of possibility that she'd decide to nap, but John made sure there were plenty of toys nearby to give her, just in case.
'Perhaps I should thank you. John already intended to propose before you showed up. I knew that, but I had real doubts about whether we'd ever get to the church. He has a problem with commitment. Your return to London lit a fire under him: he seemed desperate to prove he'd never been truly hurt by your absence and was eager to make me his wife. I couldn't have planned it better myself.'
Acceptance was surprisingly easy. It wouldn’t be the first time John had loved someone who didn’t return the feeling. No, he could content himself with this: answering the call of The Work at Sherlock’s side.
'John?'
John looked up, examining the sparse scatter of stars that sparkled in the night sky: glitter spilt on a black canvas, elegant and untouchable.
Miss Rosie Watson had to return to Baker Street. To her father, who needed her just as much as she needed him.
At first, she’d worried he just wanted his favourite punching bag nearby, but he’d surprised her. Now, Holmes only called Anderson an idiot when he really deserved it, which got rarer every day. Besides, he wasn’t the only one, when she or Greg were being particularly dense – maybe they were tired, or just plain fed up – he’d not hesitate to let them know.
John pursed his lips, giving his head a slow shake and closing his eyes before letting out a steadying breath, 'I don't like this. Something doesn't feel right.'
Leaning back, he stretched out his knuckles, his gaze strafing across his own notes and the tantalising hints he had uncovered. It was only when someone touched his elbow – soft yet shocking all at once – that he emerged into the real world to find John standing at his side.
'But...?'
He plugged in the baby monitor, flicking it on and clipping the receiver to his belt as he set about putting away their meagre possessions. How long would they call this place home? A few days, a week, more?
Sherlock met her gaze over the laptop screen, aware that she wasn't talking about John and Rosie. Rather, she included him in the equation. While he had done his best not to mourn John's loss to the married state, he could not deny that his life had not been the same since his departure. It had been a more solitary affair, for one thing.
“We what, John?” Sherlock’s voice was sharp and full of impatience.
““Silent Night” isn’t actually my favourite Christmas song,” Sherlock said after a moment. John could feel his voice rumbling through his chest.
“How-why…”
“Thank you.”
“Shut up,” John said. “Sherlock. Shut up, and turn around. And no, it is not ash samples so you can get that idea out of your head.” He tried to sound stern, but his smile betrayed him. His hand trembled in his pocket, and he gripped the box tighter.
Sherlock thought, but all he said was, “It’s all right.”
“You’ve already given me so much, I don’t know what else there is,” John said.
Sherlock grinned and pushed himself up from his seat.
Sherlock thought, and settled himself in his chair to wait. He heard John’s footsteps, his voice muttering to Rosie while moving around in his bedroom. It was strangely calming. Rosie must have been tucked in, because John started down the stairs. But then he stopped, lingering, and Sherlock listened. A sound like a muffled yell came from the stairs. He raised himself halfway out of his chair. When a crash sounded from the hallway, he pushed himself up fully and ran out of the room.
“This.” John leaned over and kissed Sherlock. Sherlock kissed back eagerly. He wasn’t experienced enough-not when John did
“I think they might be in danger,” Sherlock said, lowering his voice.
“Full names,” Sherlock pointed out, and John rolled his eyes, but not before Sherlock caught the barest hint of laughter in them.
“What does this have to do with the note?” Lestrade interrupted.
“No. Stop talking. You have no right to come here and talk about John. It is incredibly painful in ways you wouldn’t even understand. I don’t care what you think you know. You’re wrong. Wrong. I can’t be in love with John. Please leave.” He felt a small spark of remorse curling in the pit of his stomach at the pained expression at Molly’s face, but didn’t care enough to stop. “I’m doing what I have to do, Molly. Isn’t that what we all do? Do what we must to survive?”
“I look up to him,” Smith said, and Sherlock lunged.
Suicide is also mentioned, but nothing happens. In later chapters, there are suicidal thoughts that are there but nothing in detail and no suicide attempts are shown.
Sherlock replaced his violin in the case, latching it and setting it back in it’s position near the window. He followed John into the kitchen. “What are you making?”
Mary had done.
An odd cocktail of amusement and misery welled up in the back of his throat. Had he always been this bloody broken? Had he always needed excitement and danger to function? He had joined the army after all, but now he found himself staring down the barrel of an uncomfortable truth. He might hate being followed and watched – might snarl and snap at the threat present in the constant surveillance – but some part of him still thrived on the uncertainty.
Sherlock fed himself with single-minded focus, putting away each mouthful with perfunctory neatness before heading for the bathroom. The drum of hot water from the shower erased the patina of sweat and staleness that seemed to linger on his skin. Clean pyjamas brought him comfort, and a cup of tea offered a touch of calm.
A pair of Mycroft's people buckled her into the car seat, making sure she was comfortable before retreating to let John says his goodbyes. Tears bit at his eyes as he pressed a kiss to Rosie's crown, promising her that they'd be back together soon.
He reached up a clumsy hand, cupping the sharp line of Sherlock's jaw and delving fingers back into his hair as he lifted his shoulders from the bed, half-curled over the cresting core of pleasure. His abs would hate him for it later, but right now he couldn't bring himself to care. He would suffer anything to have this: Sherlock in his body and in his bed, driving the both of them over the edge.
'Christ, the warehouse. I caught that on the scanner. You were there? Are you all right?'
'I think not. Firstly, it's leather. You'll slip off it every time you move. Secondly, it is far from comfortable. You might be shorter than me, but you still won't fit with ease.'
'Pain?' John laughed, an awful, mirthless sound that made Sherlock's blood run cold. 'You've already caused plenty of that. Why stop now?'
'That would be very unwise. It's the only way out for you and Rosie, don't you see?'
She shoved him up the steps to the portacabin, reaching around him to open the door and push him inside. It was a roomy, abandoned space. Sherlock had expected it to be shrouded in a veil of dust, but Mary had clearly been using this place for some time. From the outside it may look like nothing special, but its interior gave away the unusual nature of its current occupant's lifestyle: laptops and gadgetry gleamed on the desks. There was no sign of a bed or anything else to indicate Mary lived here. This was her base for her work: temporary, but well-equipped.
‘Find out who gave them to her,’ Sherlock ordered. ‘I suspect you’ll find her killer.’
Sherlock had to content himself with quick, worried glances as he contemplated the contents of the fridge. Mercifully, there were pre-cooked meals as well as ingredients, and he pulled free what looked like a hearty beef stew, pouring it from the Tupperware into a sauce-pan and flicking on the stove.
A cold sweat itched between his shoulder-blades, and all John could think was that he didn’t learn his bloody lesson. All this time: all these years of almost only for Sherlock to be taken away from him one way or the other… He should know by now to act on his feelings, rather than taking his time. They didn’t have time.
How could he convince him that – for all the turmoil he had wrought on their lives over the course of their friendship – he would never willingly hurt John again? How could John take the risk of tying himself to Sherlock, when Sherlock himself could not even find the bravery needed to speak of it, for fear of all that he stood to lose?
He would look at the cold cases and, more importantly, take the help his friends offered. He did not have the strength to rediscover his own definition, but they never forgot.
'What does that mean?' John asked. 'I don't understand.'
John gave a derisive snort. 'Checking he's not blown the place up in my absence, more like. But yeah, I'd love one.'
He was not wrong in that respect. Even now, he listed in the bowl of his armchair, supported by its shape and nothing more. Yet even as he went to get to his feet, Sherlock knew the journey to the bedroom would not be one he could make alone. John's weakness, as painful as it was to witness, chafed against his friend's nature, cutting him to the quick. The fact John had not even the strength to rail against it spoke volumes for the state of his health.
He shifted beneath the sudden sharpness of Sherlock's scrutiny. He knew his friend couldn't read his mind, but that didn't stop him feeling like every guilty little notion was currently written all over his face. Still, if Sherlock deduced anything from John's pleasant expression, he said nothing. The rap of his knuckles was quick and to the point, and when the Dean opened the door, Sherlock's shamming smile sat firmly in place.
Only the Work remained, as steadfast as John’s new bride.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow, but didn't question him as he set another cup of tea down at his side. 'I'll get you some more food,' he murmured, a hint of amusement lilting his voice. 'Toast?'
Wearily, John pushed himself away from the kitchen surface, limping over to his uncomfortable, modern armchair with his tea in his hand. He needed to stop doing this to himself, just for a minute or two. It would be so easy to get mired down and end up with nothing but self-loathing. He didn't deserve anything more, but Rosie did. Rosie deserved the world, and he intended to give it to her, but he couldn't do that like this: broken and sleepless. Alive but torn up inside.
'John?'
‘It’s the case of the loaded dice.’
He reached out, manhandling John off the floor and guiding him into the depths of the armchair before flicking the nearby fire on with the press of a button. The mesh screen shielding the dizzy waltz of the flames would keep Rosie safe, and besides, Sherlock had no intention of leaving either Watson to their own devices. Rosie was not yet old enough to understand cause and effect, and John...
'You think we can beat her at her own game?'
John swallowed, his throat dry. It was a bit voyeuristic, watching Sherlock like this, but he could not bring himself to call out and break the spell. That would be sacrilege. Instead, he kept himself to the shadows, allowing himself the guilty pleasure of observing Sherlock unnoticed.
Sherlock made a noise halfway between a laugh and a groan, brushing an idle kiss across John’s knuckles before heading for the bathroom to brush his teeth. They got ready for bed with their normal, studied quietness. Rosie might be upstairs, but she had sharp hearing when it suited her. The last thing they needed was for her to come charging downstairs now and declare Christmas officially here. Not before they’d had at least a little bit of sleep.
'I'll start with the flat,' he said firmly. 'After that, we'll see, but I'm in no rush.' He shrugged, a crooked smile taking years off his face. 'It's not the life I ever thought I'd have, this one, but it's turns out it's not too bad. Don't think I'm in a rush to share it again, not just yet.'
He could not resist the temptation to stretch up and claim that mouth anew, to worship Sherlock with tender kisses that spoke of far more than lust and release. John had never been great with talking about his feelings, but here, in the bower of their bed, he could show Sherlock how much he was adored; how much he meant to John, unconditionally and without restraint.
Mary made a rough sound of annoyance. John could picture her: lips pinched and face flushed with aggravation. 'Very well. Speak.'
With a sigh, John stared at the TV screen, sipping at a milky cup of tea and curling his sock-clad toes against the floor. He could sit down on the sofa, too big for just one person, but that felt like settling in. As much as his body ached for rest, he could not bring himself to relax. He didn't deserve it. Not with Mary gone and people watching and Rosie only a room away, needing him every waking moment.
John winced, dragging his mind out of the gutter as he braced himself for Sherlock’s scathing reply. It seemed everyone else in the room had done the same. Donovan’s lips pinched tight and Anderson stood, stiff as a board.
Except of course that, if Sherlock was around, no one was looking at anyone else. Sherlock demanded attention without even trying. The lines of his body, the sharpness of his suit, the alarming clarity of his gaze… he captivated them, and John could linger happily on the side-lines.
‘Not breathing,’ he whispered, taking some reassurance that a heartbeat thudded beneath his fingers, at least for now.
John grimaced. He knew how much Sherlock hated cases like this, practically the opposite of a locked room. There were too many potential suspects, the motives too vague to allow one to stand out more than the other. It left them both swimming in a sea of possibilities, waiting for the one insight that would slot everything into place.
They'd be armed, whoever they were, insinuating themselves into the frail sanctuary of his home. They must be aware of his presence. Would they incapacitate him and steal Rosie away, or were the two of them targets? If John was lucky, they'd attempt to overpower and sedate him somehow. If not, their solution could be more terminal.
The chime of his phone interrupted his thoughts, and he pulled it out to skim through the new email, a
Detouring via the sink, he removed the disposable latex gloves, peeling them free and throwing them away. Washing his hands, he reached for a fresh pair before gathering what he would need to clean John's room.
down John’s spine, ‘and your company.’
Sherlock cocked his head, a frown pleating his brow as he waited for John to continue.
And that was just how he wanted it.
Sherlock strode back and forth in front of the fireplace, his footsteps ringing out their accusations. In his palm, the phone that offered a secure line to John felt slick and ethereal, a drifting connection that could, at any moment, be severed.
'Why is that?'
Most of Guy's Campus was a happy blend of architecture over the years, from the grand building they'd been in to industrial style renovations and ultra-modern additions. The Shard loomed nearby like a sword cutting into the sky, vanishing from sight as they ducked inside and made their way to the front door.
John's throat pulsed, another sob trying to claw its way out, born not from misery, but the brightest, most desperate kind of relief. Perhaps, from someone else, the words would not mean much: an empty platitude. From Sherlock they sounded as solemn as any wedding vow and were given in utmost seriousness. Had he not proved, time and again over the past week or so, that John was his highest priority?
Desperately, he reached out, clutching the sleeve of Sherlock's pyjamas. Fine fabric creased in the curl of his fist as his voice slurred, low and urgent. 'Don't go,' he begged, wishing he could fight off the pull of sleep. Yet it swamped him, as inexorable as any tide. 'Please don't go.'
If his therapist heard he’d been here again. Well, she wouldn’t. No use telling her this. No use telling anyone, really. They’d only fret and fuss and generally make him feel as if he were being a nuisance. Part of him knew he was wallowing, but he couldn’t help it. Everything else felt like a lie. How could he carry on as if it hadn’t happened? As if Sherlock hadn’t happened?
John sagged onto the nearby chair, shaking his head in disbelief. 'If that's the case, if Mary was who they were looking for, then why haven't they stopped? She's dead. She's gone. Why are they even bothering with me and Rosie?'
Irene was beautiful, but not in a way that stirred Sherlock’s blood. She possessed vivid intelligence and a manipulative manner to match. She was the queen on the chessboard, deferring to the king’s title while wielding all the power herself.
John snarled, his voice ripping free from him as if he were some kind of wild animal, but there was nothing here to fight. A hand on his shoulder made him flinch, shying away from the presence at his side as he blinked back angry, frightened tears.
A fragment of sound breached the silence, freezing him where he stood. It had not been much, a mere scrape of something against the flagstone floor, but it may as well have been a gunshot. Sherlock immediately flinched back, crouching low and holding his breath as he waited, watching the open doorway.
'Maybe, but it's not the kind of thing you forget in a hurry.' John grinned, shaking his head. 'If you are looking for a new place, though, I can get Sherlock and Mrs Hudson on the case. Between them, I bet they can find you somewhere nice. Some bloke will owe Sherlock a favour, and Mrs Hudson's knitting group all seem to own London property.'
‘A lot.’ Sherlock tried not to scowl. In truth, he’d not been counting.
‘When did you last eat anything?’ John hissed, his jaw clenched. He looked as if he would like nothing more than to grab Sherlock’s shoulders and shake some sense into him. Either that or punch him in the face.
John parted the fabric of her fencing gear to take a look at the flesh. ‘It’s a clear line. No hesitations or deviations. If they’d hacked at her it would be messy. Well, messier.’
'Yeah, well. Sleep's not easy these days. I can't even blame her.' He tickled Rosie's chin. She squealed in delight, but the answering smile on his face felt alien and strange. 'I need to go back to work. Back to...' He almost said "normal" before swallowing it down. Normal wasn't this life, not for him. Normal was Sherlock and Mary, cases and madness. His own brand of "normal" was something he could never go back to again. 'I need the routine,' he finished lamely.
'Anyone familiar?'
Sherlock took the phone away from his ear, jabbing his finger onto one of the buttons. 'You're on speaker with John. Repeat what you just told me.'
‘I could use your help,’ Sherlock confessed, sending a
Behind him, John's silence continued, thick and bottomless. He did not shift his weight, and each breath sounded too sharp and short, painful to the ear. There was nothing Sherlock could do to help. Poring over the information they already had would only lead them around in endless circles, trapping them in dire supposition. He needed more data, and his only choice of action was to wait for it to arrive.
Sherlock drew a breath, tucking that subtle admission to one side. Caring for someone had never been his forte. He tended not to notice their discomfort until it was already too late, but once again, John was asking him for help. It settled some of the anxious fluttering that hummed through his veins and steeled his certainty.
'You knew more about it than me, Sherlock. I'm sure of that. You actually looked into it when I – I didn't want to see. I was happier with the fantasy than the woman I'd married.' His voice took on a harsh edge, scraping over those last words. John's hands clenched into fists where they rested against his legs, the knuckles jutting bone-white, pressing against his skin. 'I – I don't remember everything she said. There were apologies. Tears. I wanted them to be real, so I didn't look deeper.'
Well, almost all of it. She didn’t think she’d ever get used to Sherlock-bloody-Holmes.
John hummed in agreement, not missing the way Greg kept shooting quick, furtive looks in his direction, as if he were debating whether or not to speak up about something. Normally, John would pretend he hadn't noticed and let his friend hold his silence, but he'd had just enough beer to throw a bit of caution to the wind. Besides, he and Greg were mates, good mates... If Greg had a problem, he'd rather hear about it and help.
Her family would have played some role in her decision, but how much of one, he could not say. An optimist would hope that John and Rosie's safety was her sole preoccupation and the driving force behind her plan, but Sherlock doubted that conclusion. After all, by faking her own death Mary removed herself from the picture, yet she did not appear to have done so in order to neutralise the threat to John.
'Are you all right?' he demanded, desperate to look behind him but unable to do so. He did not dare take his eyes off the splinter group. Not for a moment.
Until a few – a very select few – started to pay attention.
Sherlock glanced around, noticing how there were no shopping bags or groceries left out. She must have had time to put them away before her fate befell her. ‘What about the flowers?’
Sherlock sighed, relieved to answer the call of the Work. Better that than put up with everyone else’s gruesome fascination. They would get bored eventually. The wound would heal, and in the meantime?
‘Easy to love.’
‘I –’ Sherlock’s breath hitched, hard and sudden, so unusual that John twitched at the noise. He was not the only one. Over by the window, Greg stood like a statue, tense and shocked. Even Donovan seemed thrown, her face contorted in a strange twist of confusion and pity.
'They were, though not until after he visited your house and received your letter from Miss Hooper. They curtailed their efforts when it became clear the two of you were no longer associated.'
'What kind of discrepancies?'
Shamming wouldn't work, not bold tears or bright grins. They were only for the gullible: people too wrapped up in their own lives to see what went on around them. Mary had never fit into that category. Her cynical view of the world allowed her to act the part without ever being taken in by the emotions of others. She was right; in some unsavoury ways, they were very similar.
Necessary, yes, but that did not mean he enjoyed the excursion. Perhaps he had been able to prove how the perpetrator escaped the bank without being noticed, but his shoes were ruined, and the dank, earthy smell seemed to have lodged in the back of his throat.
“Why, your and Sherlock’s of course,” John sees red, anger and hatred filling his every pore as he spits Latin at the demon like acid.
Sherlock’s strays.
'I have reason to believe that Mary has left London. I received notice that the Harmattan splinter group is on the move, heading east into Kent.'
'Which suggests it was Mary, but who's the accomplice?'
'Friend of yours?' he asked
'Safety, relatively speaking. Norbury, for all her cunning, is a civil servant. She has none of Mary's training or allegiances, therefore I imagine she felt she wouldn't survive a "disappearance". Perhaps she and Mary could have faked their deaths together, but Norbury would be dead-weight: a liability at best. To maximise her chances of getting away, Mary had to cut all connections.'
He moved like a man in his eighties, stiff and hobbling. That was when he could bring himself to move at all. It hurt Sherlock to see what the simplest activities cost John. Basic self-care, such as taking a shower, was completely out of the question. Even getting him to eat and drink was an act of coercion. He'd already lost weight, and it was all Sherlock could do to tempt him with tea and whatever food might appeal.
Sherlock paused, no doubt considering her words before shrugging out of his Belstaff and suit jacket, leaving himself in his shirt sleeves. John did the same, lifting an eyebrow at Sally and offering her a little smile. ‘Anywhere we can leave these?’ he asked. ‘A locker or anything?’
'Bunkers, John.' Mycroft indicated a number of faint outlines drawn throughout the site. 'This would have been a major target, and there were numerous shelters constructed capable of offering shelter for up to a week. Initially, they would have had septic tanks, of course, but at some point, the two largest were connected to the main sewer system.'
‘You really are a fighter, aren’t you?’ John murmured, impressed despite himself. ‘Poor girl.’
‘Don’t you start,’ he called over his shoulder. ‘You don’t like Banksy either.’
They lived, and love would warm all their coldest days.
'Probably got a kickback,' John grumbled.
'All right. I'll get you some tea and a hot water bottle.' At John's puzzled look he raised an eyebrow. 'You've been shivering since you woke up. While the paracetamol will help with that, there's no need for you to be miserable in the meantime. Here.' He held out John's phone, now fully charged. 'You might as well check emails or whatever it is you do on there sometimes. I'd recommend against the news, though. I doubt it will improve your temper.'
'You're welcome.'
In the end, he knew what to do, but he thanked the doctor all the same and accepted the prophylactic antibiotics and painkillers. Manhandling a pair of crutches awkwardly under one arm, he grabbed the handles of Sherlock's wheelchair. He still wore his ratty hoodie, but the jeans were gone, replaced by some thin scrub pants, and John winced in sympathy as a cool wind whipped through the open front doors.
'I don't think I want to know.' Greg's good-natured tease made John grin, and they eased their way through the crowd towards the front door, shuddering as they stepped out into a bitter, sharp-toothed gale. 'Bloody hell, it's brass monkeys out here!'
Sherlock flicked his fingers. In this, at least, Mary's intentions were irrelevant. In Magnusson's office, weapon in hand, Mary had acted to protect herself. Basic motivations were always the most honest, and Mary had been taking care of her own interests for years. They remained her number one priority, right up to the moment she had stepped in to the path of Norbury's gun.
The pounding in his head drummed at John's temples, matched only by the low thrum of mortification burning his cheeks. He had not meant to break down, but the strain of the past few weeks had crashed over him like a tidal wave, heavy and dark. All his doubts swirled through the shadows, bubbles through water, leaving him dizzy as his tears rose up to choke him.
'Bind him,' the commander ordered, tossing John some restraints. 'Quickly.'
'I know.' John closed his eyes, not releasing Sherlock's hand. 'It's easy to imagine everything going to shit.' He squeezed his fingers in emphasis. 'Just – be careful? Mary's already proven she won't think twice about shooting you, and this time she's not got to keep up any pretences. At least, not for my sake.'
Was there?
(See the end of the chapter for
'I hope to receive the decrypted version by tomorrow at the latest. As for our stay in the safe house...' Sherlock paused, looking as adrift as John felt. 'I can't be sure.'
‘What do they expect when they let people play with swords?’
Now, he felt as if he had opened the locked door of digital encryption only to find another behind it, blocking him from the truth. One for which he had no key.
'Exactly.' Sherlock met John's gaze, his breath catching as he realised their inadvertent intimacy. Side-by-side and, like this, almost nose-to-nose, they shared the same space and the soft, tempting aura of body heat. He cleared his throat but did not look away. 'Confront her, John. Divide her attention and throw her off her stride. She won't expect it, and it's one of the few things we have in our arsenal that could cause her serious difficulties.'
'A sentiment I share, Doctor Watson. I have a team scrutinising all nearby CCTV for any vehicle that might be involved in my brother's abduction. I also have a ground unit searching the area where this was found for any clues as to their likely destination, but it will take time.'
A moment later, his resolve crumbled apart. ‘Go on then. Who’s having an affair?’
It was for a case, of course, but there was a time when he had done this for money and for fun. Despite what most people believed, bare-knuckle boxing was not so much about strength as it was speed and strategy. As long as he put himself in the right place at the right time, his blows could knock even someone the size of “Tiger” Tyson to the floor.
He skipped the maple syrup, though. Just in case.
At last, he erupted into wakefulness, his aching eyes snapping open as his mind scrambled to take stock. Yet his brief panic abated a moment later, not reassured by his surroundings, but by the man whose head rested on the mattress at his side, his slender, pale hand trapped in John's grip.
A sense of movement behind him – Sherlock shaking his head maybe – caught his attention, and when he spoke, Sherlock's voice was deep and rasping. 'There is no need to apologise. I am the one who's sorry. I should not have left you then, and I will not leave you now.'
'And if you did, would you surrender it? Would you hand it over to buy your way free of their attentions?'
They had been thorough and methodical in their hunt, and from the continuing barks of the gunfire, the rest had pinned down the unit in the CCTV command centre, locking them in a stalemate. Was Mycroft with them, or was he elsewhere, devising his own plans to bring about the finale of their efforts?
Perhaps everything since her death had coloured his vision of her, casting its long shadows, but John was not convinced. Was this Mary – the hard, cold one in the picture – the real thing? Even her gaze seemed calculating, not a warm blue but something sharp and harsh. Was he finally seeing her as she really was?
'About twenty minutes. You were lost to the world.'
'No?' Sherlock leaned forward, raising a condescending eyebrow. 'Then allow me. You were perfectly placed for selling secrets and influencing the outcome of undercover operations, but you couldn't do it alone. You needed someone on the inside, and that someone was Mary Morstan. For a while, it worked. Her role in AGRA continued, guided by your sinister hand where necessary, and she acted as an independent intermediary when it came to simple espionage transactions. Then, at some point, you realised you were no longer the one in charge.'
'Right,' John wheezed, clearing his throat and trying not to flush as he wrestled his mind away from fantasies of Sherlock's lips on his and that long, lean body pressed against his own. 'Right. It could be bollocks, you know that?'
Of course, Mary could never have been so successful at her job if she were not well-prepared. She planned in convoluted eventualities, and this, her death, had clearly been one of them. Eminently practical.
‘Did you really think it would be easy?’
Small feet, John noticed, and he'd seen no prints anywhere else. Whoever they were, they hadn't bothered to explore the rest of the dark, empty building. The question was, had they left, or did they still lurk inside 221B? No light trickled under the door, and try as he might, John couldn't hear any movement. However, that meant nothing, and his pulse tripped over itself as Sherlock reached for the handle.
He was a doctor, for God's sake! He knew how close it had been. Yes, there was a chance Sherlock would survive it, but the odds had not been in his favour. If John had been a couple of minutes slower... If the ambulance had not managed to storm the breach of London's nightmare traffic... He shuddered, the entire episode cast in a new and grim light.
'Thanks.'
'Were probably in on it. I do not have access, but I imagine if I could see the time of death and the signatory, they too would be falsified. Mary never got as far as a hospital. She didn't need to. The ambulance whisked her away, and that was that.'  Sherlock folded his arms over his chest and crossed his legs at the ankle: a lanky sprawl at John's side. 'As I said, I am sorry. I should have been more thorough. Perhaps then, we would have been aware of the ruse much earlier.'
‘Nothing so interesting,’ Sherlock promised. ‘Besides, most children are fascinated by that kind of thing. It’s the parents who object.’
‘Well, they’re not bored.’
'It's not your fault.' Sherlock jerked his head to the side before John could protest. 'I'm not saying the situation is lacking nuance, or that you are blameless. There are shades of grey to every conflict, but as you've said to me repeatedly, the majority of the guilt lies on Mary's shoulders. She made her choices, and we are not immune to the consequences of that. Nor is she. We cannot go back and undo decisions already made. We can only move forward.' He drew a deep breath, letting it out through his nose before offering a confession of his own. 'I only fear how it will end.'
John grunted, grudgingly peeling one eye open to give Sherlock the once over. His clumsy, grasping hand finally caught in Sherlock’s t-shirt, dragging him closer with surprising strength. Before he knew it, he was enveloped in the bed once more, John’s hand gliding down the side of his waist and hooking him close.
There was a time when this kind of social gathering would have been beneath his notice. He blamed John. Ever since he moved in, he had been trying to get Sherlock involved with their acquaintances, strengthening the silken web that connected them into something that was… well, frankly unbreakable.
He couldn't even say they were for Mary, not really. They were for himself, for the place he  found himself, threatened and trapped and lost, wanting to rely on Sherlock as he had before but not allowing himself to do so. How could he, when to do it would be a betrayal to Mary? A different kind of affair.
'It’s obvious. Don’t deny it. This “O Dio” was a point of contact for the buyers. Perhaps they never knew their name or saw their face, but they were a link in the chain between yourself and the people to whom you provided information.' He leant forward, cocking his head like a bird of prey sizing up a tasty meal. 'Who was it, Ms Norbury?'
'She was convenient. Still is, at least for now. Meet me at Dewhurst industrial estate in one hour. I’ll text you precise coordinates. Come alone and bring the file.'
Rubbing his hands together, he debated whether to put on another pair of socks. Except that would involve moving from the nest he’d made in his armchair. Here, in a cocoon of blankets and close to the crackling fire, he at least managed to control his shivers.
Breakfast appeared to be Rosie's second highest priority, after a nappy change, and John couldn't help the smile softening his mouth as he and Sherlock moved around each other in the kitchen, as easily as they had before Sherlock's fall. The addition of Rosie didn't throw out that old, half-remembered routine at all, and Sherlock took feeding her some porridge in his stride, despite the mess she made.
Sherlock snorted. “I have perfect self-control,” he boasted.
“What’s got you smiling so brightly?” enquires John.
“Yes, you git. Really.”
“What?” John stops short, causing Sherlock to accidentally step onto his toes. Sherlock smirks at him, his eyes twinkling. John pinches his waist, at which Sherlock sucks in a surprised breath and squirms slightly.
John snorts, gazing at Sherlock and rolling his eyes. Sherlock can’t deduce whether he is angry or scared or simply pissed off slightly that Sherlock subjected him to another experiment without his consent, and one with more profound consequences than drugging his tea to knock him out for a day. He doesn’t look terribly upset, though. John is a doctor and a soldier. He is familiar with death. He probably never expected to end up as a ghost, but now that the initial shock has passed, he seems to accept it with the same stoic steadfastness he always displays in the face of adversity – or whatever new plan Sherlock has devised (or, to quote John, what “hare-brained scheme you cooked up in that brilliant brain of yours”). Mostly, John takes it all in stride. He complains, yes, and calls Sherlock idiot or git or twat or nutter, but it’s usually accompanied by an exasperated sigh or a shake of head, and almost always by a fond smile.
Moran snorts derisively. He looks really angry now. John steps even closer to Sherlock, and a quick glance towards him shows that his fists are tightly clenched. His entire body is tense and alert, ready to leap forward in Sherlock’s defence. His expression is very, very calm. He looks utterly menacing.
She sighed. “But now it’s off season, luckily. It’s mostly locals now, and perhaps the odd bird watcher down at Orford Ness.”
His status as a freak and loner continues and solidifies when he changes schools and is sent to Harrow from which Mycroft has just graduated as celebrated Head Boy. He doesn’t get along with the other boys – posh, snotty, pretentious brats, most of them – and he doesn’t want to. After some initial bullying from his fellow housemates and retaliation from his side, they mostly leave him in peace, fearful of his sharp deductions and cutting remarks exposing their deepest secrets, a skill he has honed to a fine art.
“Sherlock? Tickets?” Gazing up at the conductor, he sighed. “Un moment, s’il vous plaît.”
John turned to him with a slight groan when his shoulder twinged. “What’s up?”
Molly spots Sherlock first. She looks at him and blushes. Sherlock is convinced that they have been talking about him. At first he feels another stab of what can only be jealousy at seeing them sit next to each other so amicably with their cake and tea, but then he reconsiders. Why would they talk about him? They don’t look embarrassed and guilty enough to assume they have been making fun of him and his no doubt unconventional manners. No, it rather seems that John enquired about him, questioning Molly who has known Sherlock for some time and who, despite his obvious disregard of her attempts at romance, still seems to obstinately be maintaining her infatuation with him.
Again there's art: "
He sighed as he crawled out of bed. There was indeed a mug of tea on the bedside table, but it was already cold, indicating that Sherlock had made it at least an hour ago. The time of the text wasn’t a real indication, though, since Sherlock was won’t to text John from downstairs, or even from the living room when John was in the kitchen. John sipped from the drink. He knew it was irrational, not to mention somewhat gross because in his opinion cold tea simply didn’t cut it, but to just pour it away after Sherlock had made such an effort didn’t feel right.
John leans back, stares at him incredulously.
the Freak, Scotland Yard’s very own, and they have come to understand and appreciate his value, and even seem to like him a little. But hearing it from Daniel again hurts with unexpected force, tearing up old scars of wounds he thought had healed long ago.
“My bikes are in good hands, although I might want to fine-tune my time trial machine before the next one.”
Sherlock doesn’t show his face again for what remainder of the day, having withdrawn to his room and locked the door. He doesn’t come out for either tea or food. John fervently hopes he hasn’t dealt a fatal blow to their friendship with his offer. Sherlock didn’t seem completely appalled by his words, rather overwhelmed and out of his depth. Touched, too, in a strange way. John wonders what’s going through his mind now, whether he’s actually considering the proposal.
Ah yes, Sherlock dimly recalls that in most billets, visits of the opposite gender are strongly discouraged so as to avoid indecent behaviour. Not that Mrs. Turner or Mrs. Hudson have ever had to worry on his behalf. In fact, there have been instances when they not so subtly hinted that they wouldn’t mind if he ‘got himself a gal’, culminating in him informing them rather gruffly that ‘gals’ were not exactly his area, (which, in hindsight, might have given them the wrong idea entirely but at least sufficed to shut them up for the time being). When will people understand that he isn’t looking for a relationship – of any kind?
“There is a bruise here,” John presses slightly and Sherlock draws in a sharp breath at the stab of pain, “but nothing seems broken. You’ll have to move gently for a while, and not overdo the cycling. Every deep breath is likely going to hurt for a few weeks.” He rolls down the vest again.
“Q. e. d., indeed,” agreed John, and they both started to laugh.
John claps his shoulder, hard enough for him to almost spill his beer. “Yes, there is. You described her as you would a suspect. Guess women really aren’t your area.”
Sherlock arrives at the canteen with half an hour to spare. As usual, the place is brimming with life: Wrens sitting together in giggling groups, some army personnel playing cards, grey-faced and shadow-eyed codebreakers huddling over their plates. Two women
“Yes,” replies John. “In 2006 or ’07, I think. And in ’89, of course, when they had a time trial on the last day, and the first two in the GC, Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon, were only fifteen seconds apart and battled it out to the last one, ending the Tour with a difference of only eight seconds.”
Sherlock makes a frustrated sound. “Not much. They are communicating in Italian. I do know the language, but it makes lip-reading even more difficult. Ricoletti appears to be upset or annoyed by something and Fratelli is trying to reassure or persuade him. They seem familiar with each other. Victor has so far not said much, mostly listened. There is a small bag on the table but I can’t see what’s inside it.”
“Where are they taking us?” enquires John softly.
“I can still hear you, Victor,” admonishes Sherlock. “And I’d prefer if you could just shut up for a bit and let me think.”
Sherlock scoffs. “Apart from making a brief appearance at their parents’ funeral – and that only because Mummy insisted, threatening me with cutting off my finances entirely if I didn’t show up – I haven’t had any contact with Daniel for twenty-nine years, a fact appreciated by both sides, no doubt. And we weren’t close even then. Daniel and Christopher were idiotic bullies when we were children, Daniel more so than his younger brother. Their friends, or cronies, rather, were even worse. The few times I was forced to socialise with them routinely ended in disaster.”
Sherlock shrugged. “Sentiment,” he admitted quietly, as if it sufficed as an explanation. John squeezed his shoulder again. “Care to elaborate?” he asked.
“Not your business, Mycroft,” returns Sherlock sharply, starting for the door again.
“Before you make this call, Mr. Kenworthy, could I telephone Scotland Yard?” demands Sherlock. “As you may remember, apart from the disappearance of the messages, we are also investigating a murder, and need to schedule a meeting with the police for when we are passing through London later today. Oh, and please inform Mr. Tiltman that he must arrange another day of leave for me. In all likelihood, we will have to spend the night in London, perhaps even longer, meaning I would miss my next shift and probably the one after, too. But, I suppose the information we have provided so far will warrant the leave.”
Sherlock grins and winks at him. “Speak for yourself.”
“Actually, yes. I know you have contacts all over the city, Billy. Go and mobilise them. Find out where Irene Adler lives.”
Exchanging a quick glance with Sherlock standing next to him who had studied the scene with his habitual keen and searching glance, John saw his friend draw himself up.
“Well,” says John, “hopefully it’s a sign for more peaceful and communicative times ahead. Next time one of them needs help, you know what to do.”
“Sherlock, what the hell are you going on about?” asks John, looking utterly confused.
“When?”
Sherlock huffs impatiently. “I thought you’d be more excited about this,” he says, speaking urgently. “We need to be mobile tomorrow, and we need to stay as inconspicuous as possible, which, as Soo Lin pointed out correctly, isn’t easy given how recognisable we are. What would be better than to disguise as a couple of silly-looking tourists? The mountain-bikes will afford us the luxury of getting quickly from one part of Tignes to the next – even cross-country, if required. And the fact that they’re electric will prevent us from getting too fatigued during our rest day and will also add another layer of disguise. Think about it, John. You, a former professional mountain-biker, riding an E-bike. Nobody knowing you would even consider the idea. And nobody knowing me would ever think I’d voluntarily wear the outfit I’ve picked for us.”
“Why? Did you drug his tea?”
He does feel more human after his shower. Sarah is already waiting for him when he hobbles out of the ensuite, a towel wrapped round his hips. It’s clear that Sherlock fetched her. She raises an eyebrow when John holds up a hand and forestalls whatever she was going to say. “I don’t want to talk about it.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply immediately, so John sticks his head round the door, toothbrush in hand. “What is it?”
Sherlock frowns at him. “Why are you so interested in my past encounters with alcohol?”
The two girls exchange a look, then glance at the coins in their hands. “Those are going to buy a lot of flowers,” muses the older.
“No. Way. I’m not gonna ride one of these. Not as long as I’m alive.”
“Where did you put the rucksack?” asked John. “I need the first aid kit. One of the Italians had a nasty crash and needs a doctor.”
again, meaning the stage win will be fought over between them alone. During the ten kilometres between Côte des Bastides and the next and final climb of the day, another category three to Col de la Gineste, hardly a minute passes without an attack.
Drawing closer and hunkering down slightly in order to catch a glimpse of his face, he could see what had killed Moran: a single shot to the forehead from a small calibre gun. A thin ribbon of blood had run out and trickled down along his nose and onto his lap. The back of the head was hale, no splatter of blood, bone and brains behind him on the wall, but also no blood stains leading up to the bench.
“We?”
John bit back the wry comment that lay on his tongue, knowing that it would have been inappropriate. Sherlock’s gaze had unfocused again. John tried to imagine what he was seeing before his inner eye, realising he had no idea what Victor had looked like. He only had a vague idea what Sherlock might have looked like ten, fifteen years ago. He reckoned there were places on the internet to find out.
Sherlock’s eyes drifted to his face for an instant before they flicked to the ceiling again. “As I said, it’s not important.”
“That’s what the papers speculated,” muses Lang. “Never had much trouble with him, those few times I met him. Bit of a big talker without substance behind his words, if you ask me. Remember having to settle some minor conflict with some of the local farmers, though, when he wanted to run a hunt right across their fields shortly before harvest time, which would have flattened their crops. Got them riled up a little, and rightly so. In the end he had to reschedule his hunt until the fields were bare.” He thumbs through the passports thoughtfully. “So if Moran is a traitor and, if those articles were correct, in league with the Krauts, what about this here valet of his? Was he working for them as well?”
“More than okay, I’d say.”
“Feel free to touch me as well,” John invited Sherlock, to give him something to do and concentrate on to distract him slightly from the immediate sensations. Sherlock swallowed and nodded, and began to hesitantly run his hands over John’s shoulders and down his back until he reached the hem of his t-shirt and started to pull it up.
John chuckles. “Oh, right. Apologies. Got carried away a little. Let’s do it by your manual, then.” He shifts so that his face is level with Sherlock’s, hesitates briefly to gather himself, and meets Sherlock’s lips half-way. This time, it’s no silly smack. It’s careful and tender and a bit awkward because they have to negotiate whose nose goes where first. Sherlock isn’t an expert kisser, that much is clear. But he is ... honest. Genuine. There is nothing showy or pretentious about the way he experimentally moves his lips against John’s. He doesn’t hide the fact that he’s not done this very often. Neither does he conceal that he seems to be enjoying what he is doing, judging by the soft sighs and low moans he utters occasionally. Sherlock tastes of toothpaste. John feels slight stubble on his upper lip because Sherlock hadn’t shaved in the morning. John is certain that his own taste, feel and reactions are being meticulously recorded for later analysis and deduction, and probable use, later on.
“Another accident?” muses John, frowning at the vehicle.
“I know what cuddling implies,” came the indignant reply.
Their conversation in the bunker came to mind as soon as awareness of the new development seeped through his still sleep-sluggish brain, which didn’t improve his situation but rather caused an averse reaction. He tried to distract himself by thinking about the case, attempting to figure out what had bothered him about it the previous evening and to recapture the vague idea he’d had of having picked up some vital information but not been able to place it. The strategy didn’t help, though. Whenever he forced himself to think about the case, the image of Sherlock saying something brilliant came up, and the rush of heat into John’s nether regions increased.
Did he just refer to a flatshare or does his invitation extend further? Reviewing the past evening in particular, had he been with anybody else, John would have been sure they’d been flirting. John sighs softly in frustration. He isn’t the best when it comes to reading people. And Sherlock is a particularly hard nut to crack. He said he wasn’t interested in a relationship, and apparently has never really had one. He seems unaccustomed to intimacy, particularly physical but emotional, too. John has no idea whether Sherlock’s ever actually had sex. The way he described his panic at Victor Trevor’s advances seems to indicate a certain reluctance if not downright refusal to explore these things. Perhaps he’s asexual, or just very particular with his choice of partners, or celibate ... Whatever Sherlock is, John decides it’s not his place to pry. He hopes he’ll learn more in time, though.
“Will we be required to give more detailed statements in the Sommersby case?” John wanted to know.
The stage unfolds very much according to John’s expectations. An early, determined breakaway made up of Anderson and the current holder of the polka-dot jersey as well as five other riders, distance themselves from the peloton. They collect what mountain points are to be gained, and those from two intermediate sprints. The peloton, still battle-weary from the previous, hard stage and the crash preceding it, trundles along. The overall speed is again fairly low, averaging around 40 kmh. There are two minor crashes that cause delays in the main field, but without any grave consequences for the riders involved, nor for the general classification. Team Speedy’s has their hands full once more trying to control the speed in the peloton. Because of the hilly profile of the stage and not wanting to risk any unpleasant surprises, they keep the breakaways at a short lead of about four minutes. Several other teams with sprint hopefuls help out now and again, particularly near the end of the stage when the riders have reached the hills near the river Yonne where there are some category four climbs. The breakaways are caught about twenty kilometres before the finish. Some minor escape attempts launched by single riders are thwarted almost immediately, so that the peloton reaches today’s destination, the small town of Joigny, as a large group.
“As much as I love the fans and the atmosphere they create along the road and everything, some are just arseholes or absolutely dumb, or both,” grouses Dimmock, gesturing angrily at the screen. “She didn’t pay any attention to the rider at all, just to the motorcycle camera to make sure she and her stupid sign were filmed. And it’s a fucking time trial, meaning the cameras will be round every few minutes with another rider.”
Trafalgar Square is a riot of colourful advertising. A large crowd has assembled in front of the stage and screens, eager to see the teams and their bicycles, and to snatch a water bottle or some other promotional item. Flags, balloons and giant hand-shaped signs are waving in the audience. Many onlookers have arrived on bicycles and are wearing yellow jerseys, or green ones or white ones with red polka dots similar to the one awarded to the winner of the Mountain classification. Others have donned jerseys of last year’s Tour de France teams, or of local cycling clubs. Some have come straight from work, their suit jackets over their arms and their shirt-sleeves rolled up because of the heat. Tourists have flocked to the square as well. Some have climbed onto the lion statues for a better view. The mood is expectant and quite buoyant. Whatever anxiety befell John back in his room, it’s abated somewhat now. He’s in his element, dressed in cycling gear, surrounded by his teammates, many of whom he counts as his friends. The adoration of the onlookers ... The only time he is happier and more at ease with himself and the world is when he is actually riding his bicycle.
Sherlock shakes his head and waves a hand. “Nothing.”
“Not just you,” sighed Lestrade, running a hand through his hair. “The weekend you were away at that conference in Glasgow, he texted me sixty-three times. Still, one does get used to it, and after a while you think something’s odd when your phone stops chiming without pause.” The DI gave John a shrewd look. “And now you’re bored, I take it? You never used to come to one of our outings in the past. What did you do for Halloween, anyway?”
Billy twists himself a little, muttering something like “One ’as to make a livin’, right?” Aloud, he says, “Mr. ’olmes can attest to me bein’ an ’onest man, guv’.”
John takes a deep breath, fiddles with his serviette, before raising his eyes to Sherlock’s. “Are you in love with me, Sherlock?”
“Normal,” states Sherlock, a strange timbre to his voice. He almost sounds hurt.
John gazes at the gum, then at Sherlock. He looks tempted to say something, but apparently thinks the better of it. He nods, a small smile playing on his lips.
“Do you want to talk about your dream? It helps, sometimes.”
His eyes switch to John, and he swallows. “Well, apart from that one time. Anyway, the case is fairly straightforward. We know who killed her. It was accidental, they claim. All evidence points towards that being the truth. They simply wanted to knock her out and then dump her somewhere away from the Station, where she’d be found and looked after. Trouble was that they struck her too hard, and killed her almost immediately. Then they panicked and carried her down into the tunnel to make sure nobody accidentally stumbled across her until they found a way to dispose of her body permanently. Then a ‘job’, as they called it, interfered, and the next time they were able to access the station, you were nosing around.”
Sherlock snorted and dove into his döner again. John decided not to tease him any further, but stored away the information. Who knew when it might come in handy again to know how to distract Sherlock?
Mrs. Suffield has made brief introductions, calling Sherlock a friend of Molly’s with a twitch of her eyebrows that suggests that she suspects the two of them to be more than just friends. Now she is settled at the table as well and nursing a cup of strong tea with what looks like a weekly allowance of sugar in it.
The hairbrush stills for a moment. “Is this why you are here? I heard about your ... misunderstanding with him.” She turns in her seat, her eyes raking Sherlock’s figure. He shifts onto the leg he’s been favouring, but of course she has noticed his injury. He wonders how much she knows, how far rumour has spread already, if there’s a sensational article in the
Sherlock has leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers under his chin and watching the round. “Hereford Police had another complaint on file, this time by neighbours of Remington and his fiancée.”
Sherlock turns onto his side and frowns at John. “When?”
His own stomach gives a strange lurch. Something has happened ahead, something to attract the attention of the official Tour media and broadcasting networks, enough to send the heli and extra camera people. When yet another motorcycle rushes past John, he signs to its occupants and makes a questioning gesture, but the riders don’t seem to have caught it. Nearing another narrow curve, the forest on the downhill side is replaced by a steep, stony meadow, the verges grown with tall foxgloves and some late-flowering hemlocks, opening the view to the stretch of road below. The helicopter is hovering there, which can only mean a crash. A crash of an important rider.
“Okay. I think mum and dad want to leave soon. They’ll pay for the hotel. John also told them you didn’t want any money, and that if they want to pay anything, they should help the homeless people in London.”
“They’re right,” admits Sherlock. “The day after tomorrow and the day after that are going to be the hardest days of this Tour for me, particularly the stage with Cols de Menté and Peyresourde, the Port de Balès and two more categorised climbs. I’ll be glad to hang on to the rear-wheels of the other favourites to get across these mountains in a fairly acceptable time. And it all depends on how tomorrow goes. Should I lose too much time already, I don’t think I’ll try fighting for a podium place at all. Top ten would be respectable, too.”
Outside, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry are taking leave of John and Molly.
Eventually, John clears his throat. “Sorry for running out like that. I shouldn’t have, not with you ...”
“Ah, but we do have time to look after weary bumble bees, do we?”
Sherlock’s impression of her formed during their initial conversation over the phone of a self-confident, charismatic, somewhat cheeky and outspoken woman is quickly confirmed.
John whistles softly. “You really do know this stuff, don’t you? Detective work, I mean.”
“What do people have then, in their real lives?” asks John, gazing at Sherlock.
“Well, keep down the squirming, then. I’m trying to fall asleep again.”
“We’ll let you use the loo,” declares Daniel magnanimously. “But after that, it’s the sea-chest in the attic again. Less stuff for you to spoil in there.”
Cottage Place is deserted when John reaches it. It’s a quiet side street off busy Brompton Road. On its left hand side, behind a wrought iron fence, the stands for the Santander bicycles are almost empty, although some people seem to have chained their own bicycles to some of the stands, some permanently, considering the amount of rust on some of the bikes. To the left of the bike stands, behind a small strip of greenery overshadowed by plane trees, looms the eastern side of London Oratory, a 19th century church building clad in white limestone with an impressive neo-classical façade towards Brompton Road.
John frowned. “Go about doing what, Sherlock? I’m kinda missing the connection here.”
. “Cheers for the support,
On his way to the battlements, fervently hoping that Sherlock is still there, John has a peek at the plate. On there, beautifully arranged with raspberries, some kind of red sauce, flower petals and swirls of tempered chocolate is a large portion of white
“Getting stabbed with a fencing sword? Not so much. But as chances go, this is both unfortunate and quite the opposite,” muses Sherlock.
changed? How, and why, and why now?
John smiled warmly at him. “Sounds like a good plan. May I, then?”
Twice, other people can be seem walking along the path that runs along the top of the ridge. Every time, Jan vanishes into the forest with Sherlock following, and they hide up a tree and watch the hikers explore the site and then move away again while the boys sit in the branches suppressing giggles. Sherlock imagines he is Robin of Sherwood – now with a proper Little John at his side – hiding in the Greenwood to waylay the minions of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Jan is very skilled at mimicking various bird calls, which cause some irration in the couple of elderly walkers as they discuss whether they’ve just heard an early nightingale or a robin.
“We just want to talk,” continues Sherlock. “Or ... communicate, somehow. With you. If you can. Can you give us a sign that you can hear me? Bang against something, perhaps? One for yes, two for no.”
“Do you know where this listening station is?” asks John as they approach the village green bathed in afternoon sunlight. The rest of their walk has been conducted in silence, both of them lost in thought.
John shakes his head sadly, swallowing around the lump in his throat. “The doctors said he’s going to be lucky to walk again. But you know James. He’s tough. He’ll manage. Guess you’ll have to ride for GC this year,” John says and winks.
John sits down next to him, leaning back against the headboard and adjusting a pillow in his back to be more comfortable. “Ah yes. The case, right? Didn’t you want to talk to that reporter? Kitty Riley?”
“He is a politician, John. Of course he is. But if you are referring to odd sexual practises, no. I hope not, at least. I try not to think about it. But even though he doesn’t often entertain guests here, I remember that when my parents were still using this house more frequently we often had visitors of a rather illustrious kind. My uncle Rudy, for example, likes to dress in female underwear. He has a collection of corsets. Sometimes, he even wears it in public under his suits. He also puts on makeup when in private. One of my mother’s aunts has a young lover who had barely come of age when she first introduced him. As far as I know, they’re still together. Judging from the way she moved after one night they spent together in one of the guest rooms, she enjoys a bit of sodomy. One of my cousins is a homosexual. Caused a bit of a scandal at Eton a few years ago when he and another boy were discovered in a compromising position in the library. Somehow, he managed to not get expelled. I think his parents made a generous donation to the school and the whole affair was conveniently hushed up. During a Christmas celebration, he flirted rather heavily with my aunt’s young lover. They spent a night together which they tried to hush up, but then had a public falling out about it. My aunt forgave her paramour, and my cousin went on to Cambridge where he found ample young men to spend time with. I think he works in broadcasting now.”
“Molly left about half an hour ago. She’s staying with Jeannine, I think. She didn’t want to cycle all the way to her place, and Jeannine has a room here in Bletchley, lucky girl.”
“What I wonder is what the woman, Nora Perkins, was doing at there,” muses John. “I mean, yes, she was interested in the old Tube stations and all things related to the Underground. It’s a fascinating subject, sure. But why sneak in alone? She must have known the station was privately owned. Was the door open when she set out to investigate? Did she get a key from somewhere? Or did she break in? Why didn’t she inform anybody where she was going? I mean, the stuff she told her co-worker was highly cryptic. Sherlock worked it out, but I doubt the others did. Her fiancé had no idea where she’d gone. Why all this secrecy – unless she was doing something not entirely legal.”
He lets out a long breath. “Listen, sorry for snapping at you—”
Sherlock goes missing at some point. After a quick search John finds him in one of the peach orchards with the farm’s beekeeper, inspecting the hives and talking animatedly in French. John doesn’t interrupt them but watches for some time, half hidden behind some trees. Sherlock is gesticulating animatedly, his face aglow. He looks utterly fascinated, asking many questions, pointing at trees and the wild flowers growing in the tall grass. The beekeeper, an elderly woman with a strong tan and silvery hair, listens and explains patiently. At one point they step closer to one of the hives and she opens it. Sherlock gestures towards her head, probably asking about her lack of protective gear. She only smiles and shakes her head and begins to carefully lift out one of the frames. It’s covered in bees which begin to crawl over her hands and up her arms. She doesn’t seem to mind and nods to Sherlock to extend his hand and hover it over the bees. Cautiously, he does. John catches his breath. But the bees don’t hurt Sherlock. In fact, they ignore him. Sherlock laughs softly, his eyes shining. He looks like a little child at Christmas as he stands with his hands filled with bees.
There is another pause. The faint outline flickers. The tea stirs as the visitor dips the spoon into the mug again. Then writing appears.
According to Sally, John’s split time is more than respectable. “You’re doing brilliantly, John. You’re in eleventh place right now. That’s remarkable. Don’t overdo it on the last stretch, though. Your heart-rate is almost at its peak.”
Lestrade shook his head. “No, not as such. But there is a body. One of the bus drivers found it, about two hours ago. At first he thought it was a drunk taking a kip on one of the benches. Turned out the fellow was dead. But that’s not the strangest thing about the whole set up. Before the driver ever called London City Police, we received an anonymous tip off. That’s why we are here as well. The whole thing is very strange. Uncanny, even. See for yourselves.”
Sherlock smiles at well. Their gentle bickering calms him. “Once again, you underestimate me, John Watson. I did attend regular driving lessons. The instructor was a fierce and opinionated woman who, to use your vocabulary, ‘didn’t put up with any of my shit’. Also, driving and learning a few traffic rules is not actually difficult. I managed to pass my driving test and acquire my licence with the minimum lessons required.”
The return journey back into London was quiet. Lestrade dropped them off at Baker Street and thanked them. “I’ll keep you in the loop, okay? Thanks, you two. Oh, and Sherlock, be nice to Dimmock, yeah? The poor chap is this close to a mental breakdown.”
“Why would he hurt me?”
Sherlock ducks his head, laughing softly. “Touché.”
Sherlock chuckled, leaning in for an experimental swipe of his tongue along John’s jaw which made John squirm and shudder and laugh softly while causing another rush of blood into his nether regions.
at University. And no. Just he and Victor were at Cambridge at the same time as I. The Van Coon brothers from Wilkes’ team attended Oxford, most of the other riders are younger. Many didn’t go to University at all.”
The journey is uneventful but for a signal failure near Elephant and Castle that delays their train by almost half an hour. Sherlock distracts himself with deducing their fellow passengers and helping John with
At this, John’s expression darkens. “Yes, I did. I take it you didn’t just spend one night there.” His voice and eyes are hard now, disapproving.
“What’s that?”
Sherlock holds his gaze for a moment “Yes, see you there.” He seems about to add something, but in this moment, Wilkes’ mountain helper van Coon accelerates with Wilkes on his rear wheel. With a last glance at John, Sherlock speeds after them, followed by some of the other GC contenders. John is left behind to ride at his own pace, watching Sherlock cycle up to Wilkes and then, to the other’s surprise, continue, forcing Wilkes to chase after him. John smiles grimly to himself.
John smiles. “Of course. Must have been nice to have your brilliance confirmed. Still, I am flattered that I made your very short watch-list, right behind your old pal Victor Trevor.”
John smiles at this. Although he supports Kit and wants him to become leader in the young rider category again, he wouldn’t mind if the white jersey stayed on Lachapelle’s shoulders. The young Frenchman is sympathetic. Moreover, his openness about his relationship with his teammate Bernard and their unwavering support from their own nationals touches John. He wishes everybody were so accepting of openly queer riders.
“So what exactly spoke against him slipping on the stairs and getting killed in the fall?”
Where would he be without him?
Pain grated through Sherlock's skull, flashing outwards from two epicentres, one at his temple and another behind his ear. A pair of strikes: brutal and efficient – so quick he had not even seen them coming.
'Besides, even if it wasn't Ajay, as Mary believes, she wouldn't be here if she still had access to those other files. They have been neutralised. Now, the only way for her to get what she wants is to confront Mycroft – which would be foolish at best – or come after us. She just doesn't know that, yet.'
‘Sure.’ John opened his crisps, munching on them happily as he relaxed. The fire crackled in the grate, soaking the room with its heat. Most pubs got hot from the crowd alone, but the big rooms of the old Victorian place seemed to carry a perennial chill. By the time Greg returned, John had leaned forward, his palms outstretched to revel in the glow of the flames.
'Only a number of explosives and a radio transmitter, no doubt designed to notify Ms Morstan that the devices had been triggered. I do not believe there is any possibility that she does not know what has occurred and who is responsible.' The clink of a glass echoed through the earpiece. 'They were not intended merely to alarm or maim. I have lost several agents tonight. It is safe to say that Ms Morstan has thrown all caution to the wind.'
Closing his eyes, he pressed his lips to the top of Rosie's head, breathing in the scent of her as he bared his teeth. Every muscle shivered with the need to act, trembling beneath his skin as the air turned tight and heavy around him. Sweat trickled down his spine, and John swallowed hard, barely blinking. He watched the light change beyond the door as the two figures oh-so-slowly approached.
Two were on the rare occasions John had found the energy to take Rosie to the park. One was of John walking, his shoulders rounded, trailing down one of London's many side-streets and half-praying for a fight. It had been taken early in his grief, when he'd just wanted to get
Yet the picture itself was not what disturbed him. Instead, a figure in the background held his attention, catching his eye as his mind whirled and raced.
‘Not any longer.’
A smile tugged at the corner of Sherlock’s lips. ‘But you’re not.’
Later, the outside world would find them anew. They would pick up Rosie from nursery and have a family dinner. Work would make its demands and responsibilities would intercede, but that was all part of the deal.
With a quick nod, she sat up, waiting for her equilibrium to settle before reaching for the bag she’d instructed her accomplices to bring.
Mary, or someone bearing her name, may have been buried, but Norbury had yet to be prosecuted. As such, he knew that Lestrade and, to a lesser extent, Molly, were taking a risk in handing the documents off to him. It was nothing they had not done before, but he appreciated the effort all the same.
'Take mine,' Sherlock said, apparently reading John’s doubt in his expression and gesturing through to his room. 'The fire-escape is a potential line of attack, but also an exit point. We might have to put it to use.'
‘They’re dead. There aren’t any left.’
'Please.'
'Did you have to say that?' he asked, pursing his lips when Sherlock raised an eyebrow in his direction.
'Will it?' John cocked his head, watching the cogs turn behind Sherlock's eyes. 'Really? Or will it be just the same as before, but better?'
‘We’ll go and talk to the Dean,’ Sherlock decided, meeting John’s gaze with a flicker of quicksilver eyes. ‘Unless there’s anything more to take a look at?’
How could he give it credit, when he had already seen how much John suffered? All his life, Sherlock had held the truth sacrosanct, but when it came to Mary he had turned a blind eye again and again, ignoring his doubts so that they could not even form into suspicions.
John laughed. He couldn’t help it. He should probably feel a little bit sorry for Sebastian, but quite frankly, the wanker deserved it. ‘So, what now?’ he asked, watching the way Sherlock’s eyes gleamed, bright and beautiful and bloody brilliant.
More damning was the blood-stain. Mary had lain on the floor as she had "perished", panting her last, and yet it had been several minutes before her so-called death. A wound through the torso would have bled and drained from the thoracic space through the hole in her back, but the mark was not much bigger than the spread of one hand. There should have been more.
This space had been a strange office-cum-repair-shop at some point, and a multitude of heavy steel tools hung on racks. Additionally, the desks were solid, unfinished wood workbenches, as thick as walls: the perfect shield from projectiles.
