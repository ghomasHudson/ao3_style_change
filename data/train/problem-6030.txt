Before the comments come in. No Peter does not have autism. Yes, it might be odd that he is treated younger but it is what it is, read it how you like. No, I do not think it is abusive or promoting abuse and no he does not have a mental illness. Yes, he does get corner time and spanked in this story, please read the tags. Thanks for taking the time to read this to anyone who is enjoying the story.
Hey! This was a request. This was one of the stories that were locked because someone reported it. Hope you like this and let me know what you think!
Peter rolled his eyes at his uncle and took the pyjamas his Papa handed him. Tossing his shirt and t-shirt on the ground and slipping into the Ironman pyjama set instead.
The rest of the class gasped. While everyone sort of knew that he was Tony Stark’s kid, there was still many that didn’t believe him, mostly because they hadn’t gotten around to doing a press conference.
Tony smiled at him, one of his real smiles, that went the whole way to his eyes when he was truly happy. “Yeah, we do.”
He took off running ahead of them, ignoring Dada’s call for him to wait on them. He wanted to see the bath that Jamie was having. Jamie was sick so he needed all the bubbles. That would make him feel a lot better! It always helped Peter, in both worlds. He rushed into the bathroom where the water was just about filled and saw that while there were a few bubbles but there wasn’t near enough for his liking. Dada and Mama were way too trusting and left the bottle of Iron-Man bubble bath just out for anyone to take it. Peter fumbled with the lid for longer than he wanted, getting it off just as Dada and Jamie walked in. In panic Peter tipped the bottle upside down and emptied it into the bath swirling his hands to mix it into the water, ignoring his sleep suit getting wet.
His brow furrowed when he saw it was a bottle of milk. How was that supposed to be better than pancakes? When Jamie looked at him though he nodded in agreement with his Papa. Jamie must be too little for them. That was okay though, all it meant was that there was more for Peter.
Let me know what you think of this chapter, the end kind of got away from me and I am running on very little sleep so sorry if there are any grammatical issues that I can't see. Thanks for the response to this story so far. It's been cool! :)
That confused Steve even more. He’d made sure to never overstep with Peter before he and Tony were mated. He knew how overprotective an Omega could be over their pups.
“Okay, you’re my big boy, but you’re still my baby right?” Peter bit his lip. He really wanted to say yes because he loved being his Mama’s baby but at the same time, he remembered his old life when his Mama wasn’t his Mama.
Peter eyed up his Dad from behind his bowl of wheeto’s early on Saturday morning. They were both in the living room watching cartoons while having breakfast. It was a tradition they had going since Peter was really young. Usually, Papa was there as well but he had to meet with some new shield agents. Dad was supposed to go as well but outright refused to give up their Saturday morning routine. Peter would normally be upset that his Papa wasn’t joining them but today it worked in his favour. He would be able to convince Dad a lot quicker than he would Papa, especially after the whole field trip fiasco. It was now or never. His Dad had finished his smoothie and was just scrolling through his StarkPad, smiling every so often when he saw something funny.
“I have a name I want to use Mama. I assume I can’t use Peter.” Peter piped up when it got to the naming part. Tony was just going to put in Stark Jr or something along those lines, but if Peter wanted to put a name down he was fine with that.
“Tony, you’d better be on your best behaviour. I have no issue spanking you where I need to.” Tony nodded impatiently. Of course, he was going to be on his best behaviour, he had to see if Clint was okay. That was the main goal here.
“Sure is, kid. She’s just not a caregiver so wasn’t able to adopt you when you were classified. Dada and I did but she’s still very much part of your life Peter. She still lives in Queens and you love seeing her.”
Tony growled again but accepted it. “Fine, but if I find out you did Steve I don’t care how much I love your cock, I’ll chop it off.”
“You back with us?” Clint nodded, flushing in embarrassment over his mini freak out. “Verbal answer please.”
“Welcome to the club kid. Literally, everyone, except Uncle Bucky look tiny compared to Papa. Don’t forget to follow your aunts and uncles on it, or they’ll be annoying us.” Tony pointed out. The only people that Peter already followed were him and Steve. That part was not negotiable. “Steve, add Peter’s account as an option on your twitter so you can switch between.”
It was too difficult to comprehend that he was in the same world but a completely different world at the same time.
“Okay, straight to my floor then J.” No point stopping in the common room, Steve would have him stripped and hanging off his knot in less time than it would have taken Tony to say hello. Not that Tony would object that was. He could feel himself getting wetter even thinking of Steve and his Alpha cock. No, the worse thing about it was that Steve would have no shame and wouldn’t just keep it to the privacy of his bedroom, no, he’d take him anywhere he saw fit. It was a hangover from Steve’s time when Omega’s were taken where ever their Alpha saw fit. Nowadays that was reserved for ‘traditionalists’, and Tony Stark was anything but traditional. It was one of the reasons he hid from Steve every heat. Of course, he took all the Omega jewellery and accepted his hand at courtship but he just knew if he saw or smelled Steve it would be all over. He would give in and then he’d be mated. Don’t get him wrong, he wanted to mate with Steve, the only problem was that he had a tiny problem with relinquishing control and the problem with traditional Alpha’s were that they needed to have the control. Steve had told Tony some of what would be expected of him when (Tony was well aware he said
let go of his Dad Peter was quick to stick himself to his side for his own cuddle while they walked, content now that he wasn’t being left out.
“No pubic hair, common for submissive Omegas” He commented, grasping his cock and pulling his foreskin forward and back a few times. “Penis is healthy, no issues with the foreskin.” He took Clint’s balls in his hand and rolled them, pinching slightly as he examined them.  “Testicles are healthy if a little blue.” The comment got a snort from Steve and Bucky. He moved on from there, going down each leg to his feet, “Both legs and feet are fine. A few scars from past missions but nothing to worry about. Bucky can you put him over your lap? Clint, I need to check your prostate to see if everything is okay. It will probably be enjoyable for you with the state you’re in at the moment but I’ll try be as quick as possible.”
“Good boy. I’ll let you know when you can come.” Steve resumed, using his thumb to spread the pre-come around the tip of Tony’s cock. It was a flaring red and straining against Steve’s hand and he kept his teasing to the tip, circling again and again, stopping when Tony thought he’d come. Every time he brought him to the edge before stopping long enough to take Tony back from the brink only to begin again.
Privately Tony could admit that he liked how clingy Peter got with him, never wanting Tony to be out of his sight.
“Awesome! Let’s go get you changed.” Peter was placed standing beside the couch while Mama got up, he went to bring the bottle into the kitchen but Peter followed him. It was still too soon to be left by himself.
Tony cleared his throat to bring the room back into focus. Once everyone (Peter) had quietened down he spoke. “Peter, why don’t you go with Papa and get settled while I finish here?” He said in such a way that Peter would know what he meant instantly but the rest of the room would be oblivious unless they knew him.
Bruce was the first one to respond. “Wow, you look amazing Peter. I thought you were a real bear for a second.”
His new Mama hummed, “Yes, very considerate. Now don’t leave my baby waiting, go and get him his promised cookie. And don’t forget about me!” He called after them. Peter looked over his new Daddy’s shoulder and grinned at his new Mama to show he hadn’t forgotten, getting a wink in return which made him blush again.
“Uh-“ Bucky wasn’t sure of that and looked back to Tony to help him. Before Tony could say anything Peter piped up from his perch on his Daddy’s lap, watching everything intently.
It showed how much Tony didn’t want Peter to be upset that he allowed Harley to hand him the whole of a six squared bar of chocolate. Peter for his part, forgot all about being upset over the comment and happily took the bar with a thank you before biting into it. He loved chocolate so much. He didn’t understand why his parents just wouldn’t give him some every day to build up his tolerance. When he commented on it before he got a swift no off both of them. Either way, he got a full bar today and in no way was he complaining. He sent his Dad a smile when he looked back, a silent thank you for allowing him to have it. The car fell into peaceful silence while Tony navigated his way out of the carpark, it wasn’t broken until a few minutes after Harley took out his phone and scrolled through his twitter updates, noticing Peter's name was trending.
It took everything in Tony not to argue that he was about to argue, instead he cuddled into Steve, scenting his neck to get another boost of comfort from him, he really didn’t want to admit why he didn’t want to wear the collar but he just knew that Steve would see through any lie he tried to come up with. Instead, he mumbled into Steve’s neck hoping that Steve would understand him.
“Remember as well. I want this hard at all time for me.” Steve gave Tony’s cock a pump, causing him to whine. He was already hard, he didn’t need a reminder. His stupid body was loving the humiliation of being naked and around other people.
Tony sighed, nearly sure he knew what was wrong. “I think he’s jealous but instead of being clingy to me, he’s annoyed because I left him in the car while we got your bags. He’s feeling ignored.”
Peter let out a little giggle at that. It was true, uncle Bruce could be found sleeping anywhere around the tower. They even had a bet going to see who found him in the weirdest place. Clint was currently winning after finding him in the vents once.
“Do you think Papa will mind?” Peter asked as he cuddled into his Dad and watched him go through setting up his account first, giggling slightly at the name he created. @Iamironman was such an obvious username. He had to provide a copy of his passport to get his account verified. “Can I get my account verified like that?” Being verified straight away would be sick!
Peter rested his head against his Dad’s chest and listened to his heart while he calmed down. His Dad let him take his time until he was ready to ask his question. Peter stayed there for what was probably longer than necessary until he started to worry that Papa would be home before he would be able to get the question out.
Poor baby wasn’t going to be one bit happy. Hopefully, he won’t wake up in tears though, at least if they start the visit off calmly it might help.
Bruce took the gloves off an disposed of them in the trashcan, coming back to write more on the clipboard before looking at Clint and Bucky.
He was quite surprised that after his initial panic where he thought that Steve would take Tony away from him, he took to Steve so well. Of course, he still went to Tony for most of his cuddles and comfort, but he had shyly come up to Steve and let him scent him. It was something that Omega pups took comfort in.
Peter took off running through the penthouse to change. Usually, they would be naked but Steve wanted to make Peter as comfortable as possible. Next time maybe. He was sure the pup would see them naked throughout the next month, knowing how much he loves to crawl into Tony’s bed.
Peter’s eyes widened at his Papa’s earnest words. He jumped up from his spot and ran into his waiting arms to comfort him. “It’s okay Papa if you really don’t want me to do one I won’t. I don’t want to worry you and Mama.”
Mama got the paci quickly and popped it into his mouth. “There we go, my demanding boy. Let’s change your diaper really quickly before Dr Cho comes back.” Tony took the diaper bag off of Steve and brought Bucky over to the exam table, lying him back on it to get at his wet diaper. Bucky kicked his legs in frustrations, not wanting a change but he also didn’t want to sit in a wet diaper. All his thoughts were so confusing, so he whined instead, knowing it would get his point across.
At Peter’s nod, Bucky happily took the bottle, gripping it with two hands and tilting his head back to drink. It was delicious! Papa was right. It was way better than pancakes. Although Peter looked to be really enjoying them.
Tony brushed his lips over Peter’s forehead. “You sure do buddy. You’re going to be the best big brother there is. I’m sure of it. Right now though we have to be very careful with him because he’s pretty upset. Do you think you can help us make him comfortable enough to go to a test centre?”
“Mama, can I do that?” Peter was nearly sure that he’d say no but there was always a chance that it might be a yes.
How was he just supposed to accept that he now had a ‘classification’ and that he’d be more of a kid than adult for the rest of his life? What about when he got older? Would Mama and Daddy always be there or would he be all alone when they were gone?
Steve took a firm hold of Tony’s hips and sat the both of them up so that Tony was on his back and Steve was over him. The new position allowed Steve to press even closer than he was before. He stayed still long enough to get Tony squirming before he began to move and then all Tony could do was hold on as Steve pounded into him.
Hey! So yeah it's like 11 days before Christmas but look, the Halloween story is done so yay! Sorry about the delay but it got done!
“Did you forget to look in the kitchen, Petey? That’s where me and Dada were.” Ohh... The kitchen. Dang, it.
Tony saw Peter’s breath quicken and his how much he was fidgeting and moved quickly over to his son, wrapping an arm around his son to help him calm down. Peter had a tendency to work himself up when he had a difficult question to ask, so much to the point that he would be inconsolable for a while after it. Luckily Tony and Steve were well able to stop it before it got to that point.
Surprisingly it was Tony that began to growl at him. Bucky, Steve, and Clint all looked at him, not sure why he was growling while Bruce just shook his head.
“During your heat, it brought you relief to be filled and knotted. This week though, I’m going to train you to respond to my cock at all times. You’ll be spending a lot of this week riding my cock and focusing on staying hard at all times with me.”
Peter was beyond excited. Like beyond, beyond excited! He was so excited that he couldn’t stop his frantically shaking legs or his tapping hands. He’d been told off twice already for disturbing the class but he didn’t care because today was
Peter just jerked his head once. Not saying anything else, just staring with a wariness that Tony hated. He didn’t want Peter to ever look at him that way.
The elevator door opened, and Steve and Tony whipped their heads to it, shushing whoever was coming through. They had only gotten the boys down. They didn’t want to risk them waking up and breaking their peace. Thankfully it was just Natasha that came through. She was a quiet person in general, so they highly doubted she would wake them.
It only took Steve to nod once and Tony was off like a shot, rushing into the living room. The sight that he came into made him stop in his tracks, unsure of what he was looking at for a minute until it all became clear. Clint was strapped down on a breeding bench with a fucking machine behind him, pounding him hard and fast. The whirring of the machine was loud in Tony’s ears and he couldn’t look away no matter how much he tried. He could see Clint’s cock underneath swinging back and forth, with a puddle of cum underneath him. Clint’s eyes were closed, his mouth slightly open as he continuously moaned his way through the fucking.
“Sorry Flash, maybe another time.” He skipped around him and ran over to the land rover that Papa used to pick him up in. It was kind of funny to see Flash’s anger filled face as he ran by him and across the road to the car, narrowly being missed by another car he as ran. Whoops, he gave a little wave when the car's horn beeped aggressively and kept running, not wanting to anger the driver any more. His face broke out into a grin when he opened the door and saw his Papa behind the wheel, throwing himself at the man as if he hadn’t seen him that morning for breakfast.
Steve walked around the Land Rover and took Peter’s hand, he knew his son was old enough to cross through the parking garage by himself but just four months ago he was very nearly hit by Clint when he decided to run ahead of his parents. Since then he had to hold one of his parent's hands where cars were involved. Today was another example of just how unaware Peter was of the cars surrounding him. He knew it embarrassed him but he’d rather have him embarrassed than dead.
“Don’t hide your sounds sweetheart. I love hearing them.” Bucky said, brushing his fingers against his still clothed cock as he unzipped his jeans. With a quick yank, they were down to his calves, baring him to the room. Clint could only spare a tiny bit of himself to be embarrassed as Bucky had taken hold of his engorged cock, giving it a slow stroke, making Clint’s toes curl in pleasure. He let go as quick as though which left Clint wanting and straining forward a bit.
“Peter! What are you doing?!” His Dada’s loud voice demanded. Peter jumped, not liking the stern, loud voice directed at him. He looked down to the floor, looking at his feet.
Tony blinked and blinked again, unable to comprehend what his son was trying to say. Twitter? Peter? His innocent little boy on the evil platform of twitter? Tony had to bite back his natural response of over his dead body. Peter was looking at him with pleading eyes so Tony would hear him out before making the decision.
Peter threw the last grape into the air and caught it, grinning at Bucky’s whoop of celebration. It was touch and go whether he got it into his mouth or not, today was obviously a good day since he caught it on the first go.
Comments and kudos are much appreciated. I don't have time to respond to all of them but I still enjoy reading each and every one of the comments and try my best to respond to the ones that have questions!
Steve adding his mark to Peter would send out the signal to everyone that Peter had double the protection, not that Tony’s scent wasn’t protection enough. Tony was still Iron-Man and famous. His scent attached to Peter had already done its job. Adding Steve’s would just solidify any of the truly idiotic Alpha’s that thought they could take on Iron-Man’s pup.
“Great name. All I have to do now is add the profile picture and mute a few things and we’ll be golden.” Tony made quick work of muting all the accounts he could think of and any bad word that he didn’t want Peter to see. He didn’t mind a few coming through but there was no need for him to be exposed to that language all the time.
“Well done Bucky! I’m just going to look through this for a minute and then I’ll be back. Tony if you could get his sleeper off and push his diaper to the side a bit. I’ve learned to do it quickly is the best route to go.” Cho took the papers she was filling out during the exam and left once again, leaving the family of four.
Bucky just huffed a laugh in response. “Sorry darlin’ but if you want some sweets later you need to be well rested.” He said, throwing himself onto Peter’s king size bed. “Thanks for giving me an excuse to get out of the most boring meeting in history though.”
Peter listened while his Dad and Harley talked the whole way home, feeling slightly left out that they didn’t even bother to try and include him. Harley was telling a particular story where his friends convinced him to go down a super steep hill and he ended up falling. Dad gave out to him but Peter just thought that it made Harley even cooler than he already was. He decided to insert in himself into the conversation.
Tony rolled his eyes, willing his cheeks to stop burning, it wasn’t even that embarrassing. It was cuter than anything.
The waitress waited until they were all seated before taking their order. Peter stared openly at her in a way only a baby could. He got a smile back of her which made him blush and hide his face. His poor bashful baby.
That seemed to stop Bucky for a minute. How was he supposed to answer that question? It was obvious that Peter was the big brother.
Peter nodded sadly. “But- But I wasn’t like this and now I am. Why? Why can’t I be big? What about school?” Peter didn’t want his whole life ruined because of this new world. He shivered lightly when his Mama took his vest off, leaving him fully naked, thankfully he didn’t waste time putting him into the warm bubble bath. Peter let out a sigh, this was nice.
“No.” Time to let his parents know that he wasn’t going to be little like they thought. He was big enough to sit by himself. Unfortunately for him, in this world, he was way weaker than his Mama and he didn’t even bother to argue with him. Before Peter could protest any further he was strapped in and his pacifier was placed in his mouth, along with Ironman in his lap.
“Good, now let’s go.” Steve stood to the side and let Tony pass, bringing his hand down on his bottom when he passed. Tony yelped and brought his hand to rub the sting but picked up the pace. Steve noticed that Tony’s cock jumped even as his ass clenched. That was something to file away for later.
It got so bad last time that when Peter went to bed Tony had to go with him to bed and wasn’t able to move until the next morning.
Harley laughed and put Peter down, letting himself be dragged by Peter over to Tony who was smiling and ignoring all of the people around him taking photos.
“Yeah, bud. You and I will spend all day tomorrow with each other having fun and Sunday. I’ll only be gone a few hours I’d say.” Harley reassured him. Peter nodded, maybe Harley wasn’t sick of him after all?
“Sorry Mama, but I got it the first time!” He grinned proudly up at Tony. Tony just rolled his eyes at the teen, jerking his head towards the door.
Steve didn’t talk until Peter was completely relaxed against him. Willingly cuddling into him now that his scent was in his nose.
crying, normally he could withstand a lot more pain than that but right now his emotions were all over the place, it must be something got to do with just waking up alive again. It was the only explanation he had for why he was currently clutching his head and sobbing loudly. He tried his best to be quiet but it just hurt too much.
“Right, let’s get you set up. Remember Tony. Once half the pasta is gone you can have the knot okay? You can also come as much as you want since technically it’s still my cock inside you.”
“ ‘Kay.” Peter turned away from his Daddy to look at Bucky who was still cuddling with Mama. “Bucky!” He called, waiting until Bucky looked at him from around his blankey that he was rubbing against his face.
Peter squinted his eyes at his Mama. He knew the suss, they were just tricking him into not kicking up a huge fuss since Bucky was pretty much melting down in the seat beside him. Peter sighed. Fine. He’d do it, but they’d owe him big time and better not get used to him being so accommodating.
“Makin’ bubble bath for Jamie.” He mumbled, glancing at the bubbles that were starting to overflow in the bath. Peter looked at Jamie and saw that he had stopped crying, eyes wide as he looked at the massive amount of bubbles that were in the bath. “Look Dada, Jamie’s happy!” Maybe that would get him out of trouble?
Tony let out a little sigh of relief, opening his arms for Peter to cuddle into him, smiling when a damp head hit his chest. “Of course not. He’s devastated thinking you don’t like him anymore. He asked Steve would it be better if he went.”
Clint gave a single sharp nod, not looking at any of them. He heard the collective intake of breath and bit his lip. This wasn’t going to fair too well for him.
“I don’t want you to but I’ll allow it if you put up the rules of the Q and A before they ask and give me the phone for the next hour so I can delete all the tweets that aren’t appropriate.” Peter was happy to agree, handing his phone over to his Papa so that he could write the tweet out as Peter watched.
Steve’s grin was almost wolfish. “I said he’d get to come by my hand as a sorry and he did. I never said what I’d do after that. My Omega needs to be hard at all times for his Alpha, I’m just helping him so he doesn’t disobey one of my orders. I’m good like that.”
Peter pouted for a minute, how come Harley was always allowed to do the cool stuff and he wasn’t? Maybe he could get Harley to bring him out. That was if he even remembered he was there. That idea was shot down the second he even thought about it though.
“Baby, want a baba?” His new Mama asked. That was another thing, why was he so accepting of them being his new parents without even a protest? He looked at Mr Stark and wasn’t able to help it, even though he could see Mr Winter Solider shaking his head sharply at him. His new Mama and Daddy would protect him if Mr Winter Solider was really angry at him.
“Shh, it’s alright sweetheart, I got you.” He relaxed at the sound of Steve’s voice, moaning when he was shifted so he was sitting back against Steve’s chest. Tony could feel Steve’s cock pressing deeper inside of him, the shock of the new position sending him into a dry orgasm. This had been happening since the second time Steve knotted him. Tony was not prepared for how much better a real cock would be, although it might have something to do with Steve owning that cock. His mind went hazy with the orgasm as he relaxed back against Steve, his head falling back against his chest. Steve continued whispering lowly into his ear while rubbing his stomach before talking in a normal voice again.
“I remember but I need you to help your baby brother out. He’ll be more comfortable if you are in a high chair as well.”
The easiest way to scent a pup was by rubbing up against them and licking them. Their tongues had scent glands in it that attached to the pup or mate when they were scenting. Steve began by letting out his scent and rubbing his head against Peters. Peter pushed back happily, even as he ignored Steve for the most part. Just handing his arm over or exposing his tummy when Steve began to bathe him in his scent.
“What if he’s mean to me?” Peter had heard horror stories about Alpha’s taking on an Omega with kids. They were either pushed aside or abused. He didn’t want to be one of those kids.
“What a great name for your brother.” Mama praised, looking up from the questionnaire he was filling out, making Peter beam with pride. It made up for not being able to cuddle him. Sure Daddy was good at it but he lacked something Mama just had. He wouldn’t tell Daddy that though, it would hurt his feelings.
Peter didn’t say anything for a long time, just continued to stare at his Dad. Wondering how his heat could have changed things so much. What did this mean for him? Would he not be allowed near his Dad anymore if this Alpha said no? Would he not be able to cuddle with him or climb into his bed at night when he was afraid? When he finally decided to move he just cuddled into his Dad’s neck. Afraid this would be the last time that he’d ever get to do it.
“Looks like you’ve finally gotten your memories back then.” He looked over at Mr Winter Solider, “You too?” At his nod, his new Mama sighed and looked at his new Daddy.
His new Daddy held him easily in one arm as he went around the kitchen getting the cookie tin, which was blue and had a picture of the cookie monster on it that said We want cookie, om nom nom.’ He also picked up a bottle of milk out of something that looked like it was made for heating it, if the steam was anything to go by. He brought both back into where the rest were, handing Peter back to his new Mama and opened the cookie tin to let Peter take the two cookies out before passing it around to everyone else. Peter shyly handed one to his new Mama who took it happily and ate it straight away. Peter continued to look at his until Mr Stark laughed slightly. “Need to take the pacifier out before you eat it, baby.”
An update I know. Crazy times. I'm heading to Scotland for the week so I said I'd put this out and post another update when I'm back.
Steve raised an eyebrow at Clint’s accusing tone. “Why would I say it was a replica if it wasn’t?” He asked, baffled by Clint’s outrage. Clint didn’t respond though and just glared at him. Steve shrugged, fine. He didn’t care about what Clint did or didn’t think. His main concern right now was Tony and his need. “You ready for it?” He spent the last five minutes that it took Clint to get the dildo explaining to Tony what he was going to do. Tony wasn’t very happy with it but he agreed nonetheless. At his nod he raised Tony off his cock, ignoring Clint’s stare and shoved the dildo in straight away, stopping right before the knot. Tony’s whole body spasmed with the changeover, making him cry out.
“Shh, come on baby. It’s okay, Daddy’s here. Look, what I have, that’s right, your blankey. There we go. You hold that and  work on calming down buddy.”
Tony sighed, trying to get Peter to calm down while he ran the bath for him. It wasn’t nice having an accident and he rocked him as it filled up. He put Peter’s favourite bubbles into it and set on stripping him. Peter was still hiccupping as the tears continued to drip down, not seeming to care that Tony was taking his wet pants off.
“N-No Mama, She, She, She goes on the bold step for her age.” Tony chuckled, his boy had a heart of gold, trying to get Friday out of her spanking even when he got a fright because of her.
Jamie was sick and wouldn’t stop sicking up which made Peter gag. Poor Mama had just gotten clean from Peter’s pee and now he had to go get clean all over again. If Peter wasn’t gagging along with Jamie he probably would have found the whole situation funny. Although, he was turned off of his applesauce. It did not look at all appealing anymore.
“I know Papa, love you too. Can we go out and show everyone our costumes now? They’re going to love them!” He bounced excitedly, taking Tony’s hand when he offered it.
“Peter, take a breath and calm down for me. All you have to do is get the question out and then it’s done. Regardless of my answer, okay?”
Tony’s hips bucked as far as Steve’s knot let him. “Steeeeve. I need to get up and work. I have meetings to attend and prototypes that need to be developed. I can’t just stop all of that.”
Steve and Tony were not surprised at all. Peter was a young little as well ranging between 12-18 month mark so at least they weren’t going into it blind. They knew how to handle a young little.
“You were great Tones. Stay where you are. I have something for you while we watch Star Wars.” Steve didn’t think Tony could move even if he wanted to. It looked like his whole concentration was going on not orgasming. Steve left him to calm down slightly and went over to their toy box, taking out a long, thick dildo, curved at the top so that it hits his prostate straight one, while the knot at the end will keep off of Steve in him.
Peter wasn’t sure how he knew that his Mama was better equipped to sort this than his Dada but he assumed that this was part of his two consciousness coming together which was pretty disorientating. He wasn’t able to think about it too much because it hurt his head a lot. At this point he just had to accept that this was the way he was, trying to fight it was like trying to fight the tide.
Tony looked back at his son who didn’t even look ashamed, he just shrugged, “They took my photo without my consent. That’s not cool.”
“When will Dad be home? Will he be ready to go on time? I don’t want to miss trick or treating. Are our costumes ready?” He asked, not waiting for an answer before asking his next question. In the end, Steve had to raise his voice to be heard over him.
him to move. He tried to rock his hips but Steve stopped him with a laugh and when he went to touch his cock Steve slapped his hand away.
“Happy is going to meet us at the end of the street. Let’s go before you have to carry him.” Tony lead the way to where he could see the Rolls Royce waiting at the end of the road. Steve took Peter’s hand again and followed more slowly behind Tony.
“Guys leave the dishes, I’ll see to them. Tony looks like he’s going to be here for a while. Clint, you can help me.” He said, seeing what reaction he’d have. Clint just nodded, remaining seated as the rest filed out. Bucky ran a hand through Tony’s curls before leaving. “Have fun doll.”
“I’m sorry doll. You poor thing, Steve is just worst isn’t he?” He consoled the angry Omega who was starting to look a bit flushed.
Clint, Natasha and Bruce are all out on a mission for the next three days. Bucky is gone out with Sam and Steve is in the common room sketching.” Damn, he was hoping that Steve would have gone out as well. No such luck. If he got wind of Tony going through heat there would be no hope for him.
“Want to see how Tony feels? Give them a pinch Clint. Look at Tony’s face. Look how blissed out he is. Go on, try it.” Clint brought a shaking hand to left nipple and gave it a light pinch, biting his lip as he did.
“How do you do that? I swear I breathe near them and they wake up but you just pick them up and move them without a single issue!” Steve said, exasperated.
Tony rolled his eyes at his overdramatic child. “It’s right here baby. Relax.” He said, handing Peter a deep bucket. They’d tried to get a smaller one so he wouldn’t get too many sweets but Peter saw right through them. It happened every year and everywhere Peter made Tony make him one in his lab with Peter overseeing him.
“Now not everything is negotiable. Unfortunately, you might see me and your Dad making love sometimes but if you ask Friday where we are she will usually tell you if it’s safe to come in. For you, one of the rules that you’ll have is that you’re in chastity until we can find you an Alpha or you choose one yourself.” Steve held up his hand before Peter could protest. “We won’t make you mate with an Alpha if you don’t want to but we do expect you to give our suggestions a chance.”
Harley cringed, he could see how Peter could construe that as them ignoring him in the car. They had mostly spoken to one another and not Peter unless he inserted himself into the conversation. They had to try to make it up to the sensitive boy before he got too upset. Tony and Harley hated when Peter was upset with them.
Clint’s mouth went dry. They wanted him to strip. Naked. In front of all of them. This was like all of his nightmares in one. He wanted to follow Bruce’s orders but his body wouldn’t move no matter how much he willed it to. Oh god, he couldn’t do this. It was all getting to be too much. This was happening too quickly if they could just slow down a tiny bit. The panic was setting in and the room was blurring around him. He needed to leave, now. He looked around for a way out but he couldn’t see straight. It was getting harder and harder to breathe, his breaths coming in short gasps until he felt like he was choking on them. He jumped up, not sure what he was going to do but he had to do something- anything- to stop the all-consuming fear that was overcoming him. His ears were ringing, and everything was starting to feel too far away. Instead of trying to stop it like he usually did, he let it happen. It was kind of nice, the floating feeling, like no one, could touch him from here. Peaceful in a way. He could vaguely hear someone calling his name but he wouldn’t have been able to answer them even if he wanted to. He closed his eyes, letting himself float away. This was too difficult. He didn’t want to do it was easier to give into the floaty feeling than to face the three mad Alphas. He felt himself fall but was powerless to stop it. Letting the feeling of despair overcome him.
Tony ran a soothing hand through Steve’s hair, “I know, but we can still monitor it and make sure he’s as protected as possible. Let Peter know that it makes you anxious and I’m sure he’ll understand. We have a smart kid.”
“Oh my, that’s some mess you made there Petey. Let’s get you changed into your sleepsuit and see why Dada disappeared for so long?”
“Hi, Jamie. You sleepy?” Peter asked quietly. Bucky bobbed his head up and down. He looked like he could fall asleep any second. Maybe Mama and Dada didn’t know? He should tell them.
“Sure bud, you have to go into your seat though.” It took everything in Peter to not whine. He wouldn’t let his ‘classification’ get the best of him! He was big, dang it! Instead, he shrugged.
“Peter, it’s okay. You didn’t hurt my feelings. I know you didn’t mean it and I’m sorry if you're disappointed by the raisins but your Mama warned me to get you something a small bit healthy because he knew that Natasha was going to go overboard. So if you want to blame anyone, blame Tony.” Bruce said, giving Tony up without an ounce of regret.
“Oh, you’re changing him, leave his diaper off for a minute, I can get that part of the exam over with quickly so you don’t have to use two diapers.”
Peter looked at his uncle with pure joy, laughing. “It’s only me uncle Bruce! I’m baby bear, Dad is Mama bear and Papa is Papa bear!” He jumped around the room. “What do you think of Mama and Papa?” He asked, ignoring his Papa’s groan.
“Bu-but I had a- a acc’dent.” He moaned, letting Tony manipulate his arms through the tops. He was naked from the waist down and he didn’t have it in him to care.
“Yeah sure J. I’ll head up now.” It wasn’t like he didn’t know his heat was coming, it happened like clockwork every three months without fail. It was just that he was really hoping he’d get at least another day before he had to retire to his room to ride a fake Knot for the next week. He sighed, he never was the lucky though so up to the room he went. “J. Where is everyone else?”
“You did but clothes can be washed baby. It’s no big deal.” Tony said soothingly, “Do you see why we want you to wear a diaper?”
“It’s okay Tones. I get it. No one gets in the way of protective omegas. Let’s go now so you can get to your lab and I can work out a proper training plan for this week.” Tony made a face when he heard the training plan part but nodded and jumped up.
This was the scene that Tony walked in on. Scrubbing his hair with a towel he stopped short when he saw the tower of bubbles, with Peter crying beside the bath and Jamie hitting Steve and shouting at him that he was bad for making Petey cry.
“Still with me? Good. In WBT I was taking care of everyone in my own way and now in this world, I have what’s called a ‘classification’. My classification is a Caretaker here so I still do my thing but in a more open way because it’s now part of who I am and not secondary. The entity then told us that because we were going into a different world these secondary personalities would become part of the primary ones and a system would then be in place for that. She wasn’t able to tell us at the time what our classification was going to be or what the system was. It was a risk we had to take, and we only had half the information but we agreed. After that, the soul stone was destroyed and the blast knocked everyone out. When we woke up we were in this world. I was sharing a bed with Steve and we had a double set of memories to contend with. We could remember the WBT but seemed to be the only ones that did, but we also remembered a different life here, one that I have to admit is way more peaceful and organised. Crime rates are way down, there’s only half the amount of prisons now and there’s no fight against things like drugs and homelessness because the infrastructure is set up in a way that works with the secondary personalities that are now primary.”
Why do you have a booster? I’m in high school if anyone saw me on it would be social suicide.”  He complained.
“No coming unless from your cock, I know, I know. The replica counts though, doesn’t it?” Tony asked, hopeful that he would have at least 2 ways he was able to come instead of just through Steve fucking him.
Tony crossed his arms over his bare chest. “No. I’m not going out there naked. I don’t care that you want me naked at all times. Its. Not. Happening.”
“Jamie does need your help,” Dada said, taking him out of his highchair. Peter stood, waiting for Dada to take Jamie out of his one. Dada made a good choice in taking off Jamie’s clothes before he picked him up. Jamie didn’t stop crying and whining throughout the whole process, looking at Peter like he needed help. A sudden thought came to Peter, that Jamie looked up to him, and wanted him to help him. He felt his tummy go warm at the look that Jamie was giving him. He ran over after Dada had his clothes off and Peter held back a giggle at seeing Jamie’s tummy. He reached up and took Jamie’s hand to let him know he was here. Jamie’s grip was surprisingly soft, yet strong enough that Peter wasn’t in fear of their hands separating.
“You’re right. It’s too soon for people to know who you are properly. This will be a good way to start it off, no need to tell people straight away though.” Tony cautioned as he handed Peter the phone to let him enter his name, smiling when he saw what he wrote.
Peter watched the two hugging and got a horrible feeling in his tummy. Why was his Dad cuddling with Harley so long? Did he not like Peter’s cuddles? Maybe after Harley was finished with his extremely long hug Peter could cuddle into his side (in between Harley and Dad) while they walked back out to the car. Peter noticed someone taking a photo of him and stuck his tongue out at them, gaining a laugh in response. He really hoped that they didn’t post that anywhere.
Bucky put the tray down on the dresser glancing over at Steve and Tony. He could see that the knot had reduced a tiny bit even from where he was. “Was it longer than usual?” He asked.
Tony followed his son at a leisurely pace and walked in in time to see him jumping into Steve’s open arms, Steve catching him as if he weighed nothing. “Papa! It’s time to get ready for trick or treating!” He laughed as Steve swung him around, Peter throwing his head back in delight.
Well, that would be the next order of business; getting this diaper off him was of utmost importance. He threw his legs over the crib and glanced down. That did look like an awful long way down. He gave a little gulp and squared his shoulders. He was Spiderman! He could do this! Clutching onto the rail he let himself slid off the side, his stomach dropping along with his legs until, what after felt like a lifetime, his feet hit the floor. He did a little dance once he knew he was safe. Take that Mama! He knew he was big! Now for the next thing. To get out these clothes.
“Thanks, Mama, I love you.” Peter took the picture quickly from his Dad. People didn’t get to see this side of his Dad, the one where he was open and relaxed with Peter’s most favourite smile in the world.
Bucky and Bruce cleaned the kitchen in record timing, making sure it was spotless before his exam. Clint cringed as Bucky shut the dishwasher. The beeping of it starting was loud in the otherwise silent room. It reminded Clint of the beeping of an alarm which was apt in this situation since it also signified the beginning of his exam and the end of his current life as he knew it.
Peter didn’t want to sound like a cry baby but he couldn’t help it. He was sick of Mama and Harley always ignoring him and spending the weekend trying to get his Dad’s attention. “Does he want Harley because he’s bigger?”
“I- I- I-“ He stuttered, not able to form the words for a second before it all came spilling out, “I won’t go to college and work with you in the lab and get a job and be an adult ever and, and what if you and Daddy go away and I’m left all alone because your old and old people die and I don’t want you or Daddy to die and I don’t want to be alone.” He sobbed out, catching both Steve and Tony by surprise.
“I know my darling but you have to be our good boy as well, right?” He asked, making sure to keep his tone light so the little boy wouldn’t think he was in trouble.
Steve moved Bucky first, he was a lighter sleeper than Peter so it would take him a bit longer to manoeuvre him.
“Sure, just don’t do anything illegal and if you get into trouble make sure to call me straight away.”
Dr Cho placed them on the table in front of Bucky and he studied them seriously before putting them all in a line. That was what she wanted, wasn’t it? He kept one in his hand because he liked the feel of it but the others all looked pretty like that.
Steve looked down at his son, who was so clearly trying to be convincing even though his argument was extremely flawed.
“Peter, think you could look at me?”  His Dad asked, putting a finger under his chin so that he could see Peter’s eyes.
The diner went completely silent when they came in. Tony supposed he couldn’t blame them. It wasn’t every day Ironman and Captain America with two babies on their hips.
“But, But I don’t understand. I wasn’t yours but now I am?” Peter took a suck of his pacifier to stop the overwhelming pressure he felt trying to figure it out. This thing was like magic, he may ask Mr Thor if there was a reason it was so amazing.
It wasn’t long before the knot went down though and Tony’s body felt like it was on fire once again. He could feel his hand and the dildo was wet with his slick, so much that he couldn’t get a good hold on it to fuck him as hard as he needed it. He thought he’d get a few more turns out of it before he turned to his wall dildo. He finally got a grip on it and removed it, a gush of slick coming out with it. He didn’t even care though, all he wanted was the bigger cock filling him up as fast as possible. He threw it across his bed and crawled over to the wall where the other cock was hanging, reaching between his legs he lined it up with his hole and sunk down on it with a grunt. This one was a lot bigger than the other one, stuffing him more completely than the first. He thighs shook slightly with the sheer size of it and he had to take a minute to let the size grow comfortable before moving. When he did though, his eyes rolled back in his head, god why didn’t he start with this one. He fucked himself back on it, loving the feel of the cock sliding in and out of his wet hole. He only had to brush off his cock this time and he was coming hard, letting out a guttural moan. The stretch of the Knot sending him into a second longer orgasm. His mind went fuzzy as he lost the power to his arms, falling face down on the bed, the pull of the dildo sending more shocks through his body. This time, he fell into a deep sleep, not dosing like he did earlier, forgetting all about the open door of his room.
Bucky reached out an ran a hand through Clint’s hair, raising an eyebrow when he pulled away and flushed a deeper red. Clint loved when Bucky ran his fingers through his hair?
The utter defeat in Peter’s tone broke Steve’s heart. He and his husband would be having very strong words tonight. Steve knew Peter sometimes had a hard time in school. He was younger and smarter than his class. The usually bred resentment. He was lucky he had good friends in MJ and Ned. His decathlon team were pretty protective of him as well.
Steve smiled down at him, “Hey sweetheart. I’d say you’re aching about now huh?” He asked, running a hand down Tony’s sweaty back.
“Uncle Bucky!” He cried, leaving his father’s side to go over to his favourite uncle. Tony watched with the rest of the room as Peter settled himself on Bucky’s lap and gave him a hug.
“Yeah Papa, that was a good try at being funny! Well done!” Peter’s support was probably worse than the teasing he would receive off his teammates for his bad sense of humour. Mostly because he was genuine in his support of his Papa.
Tony looked up when Peter called him. He could feel his kids eyes on him for the past half hour and was wondering when he’d finally ask what he wanted.
Slowly Steve reviled what he was hiding and Tony couldn’t help the startled breath he took. In Steve’s hand was a collar, it was thin but durable looking, made of black leather, with a D ring on the front, a tag hanging from it that declared him to be Steve’s. The clasp of the collar had a key hanging from it, meaning Tony wouldn’t be able to take it off without Steve’s permission. By Tony’s judgement, the collar would sit on his neck snuggly, right under Steve’s claiming bite. It would be just another way for Steve to stake his claim on his omega. Tony couldn’t help but feel a bit upset at the prospect of wearing, what was essentially, a dog collar. Steve must have seen his face fall because before Tony knew what was happening he was enveloped in Steve’s arms, soaking in the comfort he was given.
“No one sweetheart. They send an at home kit and you send the mould back. Clint is just talking before he thinks again. You know I wouldn’t let anyone touch me but you.” He soothed, running a comforting hand up and down his tensed stomach.
Steve cringed. Peter wasn’t wrong. The first night Harley came over it was always him and Tony in the lab together with Peter upstairs with him. They didn’t think Peter noticed it but they obviously didn’t give him enough credit. He was way better at hiding his emotions that he let on if it was only coming out now how upset he was.
“Clint,” Bucky warned when he felt him tense up as Bruce approached. Clint couldn’t help it though. He really hated his blood being taken. After a few seconds of Clint staying tense Bucky sighed and moved his hand from his stomach to his cock, wrapping his fingers around it.
Peter turned it on and opened the camera on it, turning it to selfie mode. Both of the stopped just outside the front doors of the school, Peter held the camera up, giving a huge smile to it while Tony was kissing his curls. The caption read ‘Collected early from school, thanks, Dad!’
“Ever the businessman, always finding a loophole. Yes, if I allow you to use the replica then you can come as much as you want on that as well. Now let’s go see Clint and Bucky.”
“Actually Papa I’m suddenly not very hungry. I might just go take a shower.” Steve didn’t do much more than blink at him. Peter was always hungry so him saying he wasn’t was cause for alarm. Then add that he was willingly having a shower over a bath and Steve knew that Peter was feeling a lot worse than he let on. Steve decided to not force Peter to see them.
“Of course I love Harley. Our relationship is just a small bit different than mine and yours. That’s not a bad thing. Think of it this way. Harley is more like one of the adults than one of the kids. So even though he plays with you and watches movies with you he’s still an adult and he’s treated like one. You’re a kid and will be treated like one. There’s no need to compete for my time Pete because I’m always 100% focussed on you, even when I’m talking to someone else.”
I was supposed to update These Little Days but after infinity war, I couldn't. I wrote this chapter instead lol. Let me know what you think and thanks for the comments and kudos so far!
He handed Peter a towel while he set the shower to the temperature Peter liked it, putting his favourite shampoo and body wash close.
“You know well Pete that we have rules around this. You get the first two days to go wild and then after that, you only get a few pieces throughout the day.” Peter wanted to complain but he knew last time that he tried that his parents took away the first two days. He promised to never again do that.
“Mama, paci.” He requested. If he was doing this stupid exam he was going to be as comfy as possible doing it.
He wasted no time pushing it into him, smiling at Tony’s filthy moan in response. With one last smack, he pulled Tony’s shirt down and helped him stand. Tony’s face was flushed and his eyes glazed with pleasure. Steve helped him sit back where he was original, seeing Tony’s eyes roll back in pleasure when the dildo moved with him.
Bucky smirked, “Anytime doll. Can’t have our resident Omega’s honour being at risk.” At Steve’s growl, he laughed, “I’ll go get that water and snacks for you punk. You treat him right now.” With a small salute, Bucky was gone.
“It’s alright baby. Come over here and tie this for me?” He asked, holding the ties of an apron out to him. Of course, he had to be Mama bear, Peter made sure of it. Peter made quick work of tying the apron for Tony and came around so he could look at Tony in the same way Tony looked at him, squinting his eyes right back.
Peter reared back, his eyes wide. “No! I don’t want him to go!” Before Tony could say anything else Peter was up and gone, screaming for Harley not to leave him. Tony didn’t have it in him to give out to Peter for running and shouting in the house. He followed at a more sedate pace and got to the living room in time to see Harley tearily hugging Peter back.
“Jamie, you need to relax, you have an upset tummy. You need a bath and some quiet time, not all this.” Steve tried to reason with him as Jamie continued to struggle away pushing and slapping him, while Peter continued to cry.
So lost in his own thoughts he didn’t even realise that Bruce was taking blood from his arm until he felt the pressure of the needle leaving his skin. He looked at his arm in shock, a plaster covering the small area to stop the blood. How did he not notice that? He craned his neck to look at Bucky, confused but Bucky just laughed.
All of this lead to his current predicament though. He was now confined to his room for the next week, with the hope that Steve doesn’t come looking for him in that time or worse, that he doesn’t cave and go looking for him. He practically ran to his room when he got onto his floor, throwing off as much of his clothes as he could while he went. Another problem with his heat was that his skin got so sensitive he hated the feel of any sort of clothing on it. By the time he finally goes to his room he was naked his Omega cock stand straight out from his body. Not bothering to close his door fully, he gave it one harsh tug before running over to his toy box, setting everything up before he was too far gone. He stuck one of his favourite dildo’s to the wall on his bed, another was connected to a machine he made himself that would pump in and out of him. That was for later though, when he was too far gone to go anything but take it. He put a vibrator on his bed beside another dildo that he used for the start. He found going in prepared was better than only with one dildo. Each of them had inflatable knots that came out once he clenched down for more ten seconds. He normally only clenched down that long if he was in the middle of an orgasm so it worked out fine. The need was getting worse though so he wasted no time picking up the first dildo and pressing it against his opening. He didn’t need to stretch himself out, the slick that covered his thighs would ease the way. He let out a moan as it was pushed deeper and deeper into him until the full seven inches were rammed deep into him. Alpha cocks were quite a bit bigger than what he had in him but this was nice to start off with. He pumped his hips forwards, moaning when he felt it bump against the bundle of nerves. All it took was one pull of his small Omega cock and he was spilling all over his hands, clenching around the dildo that was now inflating, the knot sending more spasms through his body. He sighed in relief, the start was always the easiest, more pleasure than pain. It was only three to four orgasms in that he started to feel the ache worse. Right now though he felt comfortably full, dosing off while he body milked the fake cock inside him.
“Baby, we didn’t hear you was all. We didn’t mean to ignore you. I’m really sorry you felt ignored though. Can you forgive me?”
“With me and Daddy dying, well that’s not happening any time soon. There’s a weird thing in this world that means if you’re a caregiver or little, your life span is much longer than usual. I’m sure the doctor that’s checking Bucky will be explaining it though so you can ask him or her all your questions when we're in there but just know that Daddy and I aren’t going to be leaving you and Bucky. Got that?”
“Sorry, Clint but I was really tired after school and I can only save one person each time. I promise next time it’ll be you okay?”
“Don’t be rude.” He said in the same tone he’d used with Peter when he was kicking. Bucky blushed red in embarrassment and nodded quickly. The swat was more attention-getting than anything but strangely enough, Bucky felt near tears at it. It did help when the arm he’d taken from his shoulders to swat him with came back around him. There was always a feeling of safety when Steve hugged you like that. He felt his face burning hotter when he saw Tony looking at him like he looked at Peter when he was being cute.
“Oh hush, you’re getting your cookie.” Mr Stark said, breaking a bit off before taking his baby finger and placing it on Peter’s chin to open his mouth and pop the cookie into his mouth. Peter hummed happily eating the small bit of cookie, opening his mouth expectantly for the next bit when he was done. Mr Stark was prompt and gave it to him straight away, chatting with Black Widow while he fed Peter. It dawned on Peter as the last piece of the cookie was going into this mouth that he was being treated exactly like a young baby was. Why was he accepting this so easily? He should be fighting this or trying to figure out what happened, not just sit here and let them treat as if he was way younger than he was. He looked around at everyone else to see if they were finding this as unusual as he suddenly was. It wasn’t until he caught eyes with Mr Winter Solider and realised he wasn’t alone. Everyone else was acting like this was completely normal though which was strange, maybe Mr Winter Soldier had gone away when he did and was only back now?
Natasha smiled, sitting across from them. “Friday told me that they were over the worst of it, so I said I’d come up and check on how their parents are doing. You both look like you haven’t slept in a few months.” She said shrewdly. Neither man could argue with her. Even Tony, who was used to going on creative binges, was exhausted to the point of delirious.
“Yeah, we’ll be there to collect you at 4.30. Are you at the airport?- You sure you don’t want to use the private jet?- Okay, okay! Jeez, you’d think I wasn’t a billionaire or something.- Right, I’ll see you later today. I’m collecting Pete after school so he’ll be there as well. He’ll probably be half asleep though.- Okay, see you then.”
Okay. So turns out, putting a t-shirt on is not that easy. He got his head stuck in the armhole way too many times before he was able to finally get it into the head hole. Putting his arms in was worse. They just would not cooperate with him at all! He felt a bit like a mummy. It took way longer than it should of but eventually, he was able to get his two arms into the top, sighing with success.
Steve slid into the room as they were all watching Peter and Bucky interact. Tony glanced at him, “Wait to keep him settled.” He murmured with a smirk.
“Yeah, you can do that for me.” Peter had to stifle a giggle as he followed all of his aunts and uncles, trying to decide what his first tweet would be. He sat there for ages, trying to think of what a good one would be as his Dad and Papa talked about the rules and regulations around his account and it came to him. A photo of his parents would be the perfect first tweet. He jumped up and made his way to the kitchen, mumbling about a snack so his parents wouldn't get suspicious. When he got to the door he turned and looked to them, waiting until they looked up to snap the picture.
“That’s the general gist of it though. Is there any questions you have?” Bucky stared at him, wide-eyed, not sure why he wasn’t explaining what they really wanted to know. Before he could ask though Peter bet him to it.
[attached, a photo of Tony smiling softly on a tasteful cream couch, next to Steve who was grinning, an arm thrown over Tony's shoulders as he grinned at the person behind the camera. It was impossible not to see the fondness coming from both of the men.]
“Betrayed by my own son. You’re all lucky to be in my presence really. I’m probably the coolest person you’ll ever meet, besides Peter.” He declared, sitting on the other side of Peter.
“Mostly, the whole of the internet can’t get over how cute Peter is and how could someone so pure come from you and Steve. Oh, Ellen DeGeneres is after retweeting his picture. Wants you on the show. Awesome.” Harley looked back at Peter who was listening to it all curiously. “Well done Peter you’ve hit over a million followers.”
“Yeah, we’re starting it today. I thought that we’d start easy with you and Clint here, work up to a bigger room full of people you know? Maybe even see if he can manage it with Peter there.”
Tony and Steve shared a look over Peter’s head. They’d been out around three hours and it was coming close to Peter’s bedtime. Apparently, Peter’s body could tell because with the excitement of the whole day and evening he was exhausted.
Peter opened clicked into the responses to see what people were commenting, surprised about the number of news sites that had it.
Peter being Peter though, it didn’t come out in conventional ways because he was just too pure-hearted for the typical kind of jealousy.
“He’ll be fine. He’ll be way more upset if I don’t bring him. I can deal with a little bit of jealousy. He’s not even jealous in a normal way, he just clings more.”
“Okay, let’s watch a movie and wait until Mama comes home. You can answer some of the questions then.”
For some reason when Tony picked him up gently Bucky stayed asleep though, Steve thought it was just a Mama’s touch that kept him that way when he said as much to Tony though all he got was a squawk of indignation.
“Your Mama is very thoughtful, isn’t he?” Clint said, the teasing glint in his tone flying completely over Peter’s head. It didn’t go over Tony’s though, Clint ignored the glare that was sent his way.
“Yeah, it’s the third time me knotting him, I think it’s taking longer to go down the further Tony gets into his heat. The longer it is the more relaxed he is.”
