But this was their son they were talking about and judging how determined Peter could be, they couldn’t stop Peter from doing his duty.
“If you want we can talk more? I was actually here to interview a student that I see fit to take an Internship for the Stark Industry.” He said.
But then I received this finish and edited version of chapter nine just this morning along with the new edited version of chapter eight, and that she's replied that she was better, already.
Steve gave Tony his soft, reasoning smile and cupped Tony’s face. His thumb ghosted against Tony’s cheeks. Tony leaned into the touch before Steve moved forward and kissed the crown of Tony’s forehead, trailing down to peck his chin, lips and Steve had the decency to sigh contently once Tony responded to his kisses. Tony, in his part, didn’t miss a beat to reciprocate by kissing back.
Pepper yelled at Tony through their phone and explained to her as to why he couldn’t attend the important meeting tomorrow. Tony didn’t hesitate. He began to enlighten about Peter, about him and the rest of the Avengers had finally found his son, his long lost son.
Everyone in the room stopped talking the moment Nick Fury and the new member showed up. Peter could see Captain America and the others had a disordered look on their face. It made him feel out of place.
“Yea, no…but take a look at this Tony.” James said as he told Johnny to replay the video again. Bit blurry and static. Tony watched it; there he saw a white van parked at the back of the hospital before three people scrambled out of the back door. They were carrying, well more like strolling something, out of the door, putting it inside the van.
Tony whistled which earned him a glare from his husband who was sitting next to him. “What?” Tony asked innocently. Steve just continued to glare at him. Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s covetous attitude. “Hey guys! We’ve found our guy!” Clint called. They shifted their attention outside, eyes never leaving the figure of a tall, scarily slender boy who was following Gwen Stacy from behind like a puppy in love.  The boy was about 5’10 feet tall, in a dark t-shirt underneath his darkish hoodie jacket, adorned with black pants and a pair of old worn sneakers. His bag dangled behind him whilst he was on his skateboard.
Tony went to his and Steve’s bedroom. A phone was on his ears. He ordered Happy to prepare his private jet tomorrow morning and to get few things for Peter
There in the center beside Tony and Steve’s costumes was his new Spiderman suit. He stared, gaping at it. Three new Spiderman suits.
He thought as he pulled out his bow and arrow, aiming one on Spiderman who noticed it and quickly dodged his attack. He kept shooting his target but his mark sidestepped each of his arrows.
The two could only hope Peter would understand, would accept them as his real parents, but for now, the couple would just enjoy their time with Peter for a while.
Steve found folder files related to their work and experiment, while Bruce found their recorded tapes. Richard on the other hand found confidential files filled with complete algorithm notes. It snatched his attention. Bruce even found something that looked like a cartridges tube, with a few liquid still in it. He examined it for a little while before putting the pieces of the cartridges tube inside his bag. Then he noticed a small aquarium tank full of ten radioactive Spiders inside it, alive.
Tony just chuckled at that. “I want you to design your own for it will be your room for a long time.” Tony said, because Peter was not allowed to leave them.
“Uh… Seriously?! So what you some kind of like the SWAT group or something?” He asked. “…Something likes that… We work for the government--” Hawkeye exclaimed but got cut off as Spiderman quickly said. “No thanks. I don’t like working with the government or becoming one of their dogs who they could order around. So sorry. Find someone else.” Spiderman said as he grabbed his bag and took off, leaving Hawkeye behind dumfounded. “Wait--! Great… He left!” Hawkeye grumbled.
“I’m going to call the rest of the Avengers and tell them that we will have another meeting tomorrow. We will have a new mission to do; we have no choice but to abandon plan B and go to plan C.” Tony said which confused Steve.
When they got there, they saw that everyone was busy. Tony was at the center where a huge oval table was placed upon. Papers, files, boxes and tapes were scattered on the table as Tony began to read some of the files while Brain Braddock arranged some of the records by dates and names. Richard and Bruce were busy examining some of the experiments the Parker couple left behind. Henry Pym and Henry McCoy were busy checking and printing something on the computer.
Tony thought of it before nodding his head. “We could do that… Now for our new mission. Good, now let’s start with our plan. I want each one of you to divide into four groups.  Now. Here are the groups. Group one would be: Me, Steve, Reed Richards and Bruce Banner. Group two will be Henry Pym, Henry McCoy and Ben. Group three will be Janet Van Dan, Susan Richards, Natasha and Jenifer Walters. Group four will be: Dr. Strange, Clint, Thor and Johnny Strom and John Blaze. Group five will be: Mathew Murdock, Brain Braddock, Francis Castiglione and Logan.” Tony said as he looked at everyone for their agreement.
“You didn’t do anything.” Tony takes Steve’s hand, rubbing his knuckles with his thumb. “It’s not your fault.”
“I can get him,” Tony says. It’s tempting to take the offer, but one glance in the alpha’s direction shows him on the verge of passing out.
“I’m saying that you make the best of your situation. Believe me there were times when I wanted to say fuck it and give up, but I didn’t. You’ll figure this out. And I know it seems scary because of the kid…” Tony trails off and directs his attention back to the half-eaten slice of pizza.
He knows that voice. Tony turns his head toward the voice, finding Steve beside him. His mate smiles, tears rushing down his face now that their eyes are locked.
Steve frowns and places the tea to the side. “But we can’t leave the mansion. I don’t want to risk-”
Tony gasps like it’s the worst thing Steve has ever said to him. “I can’t go as Iron Man! That’s lazy! I want to be…” He pauses as he thinks it over a moment. “Something, but not that.”
The rest of the exam passes fairly quickly. Steve was in good health and his pregnancy was progressing as it should be. Bruce doesn’t spend much time, but does remind the omega to reach out to him if something were to change.
Steve holds his son tighter, his heart breaking with each sob Peter releases. “I’m here for you. No matter what.”
I swear Flash will find out in the next chapter. I just wanted Peter and Steve to have a little talk 😊
He had been waiting for this moment. Holding his son for the first time had constantly been on his mind. Steve had envisioned it differently. Tony would be here, sitting beside him and cradling their son in his arms. Tony probably would’ve been nervous too. He never said it out loud, but the idea of kids and a family probably terrified him.
Tony stays as close as Steve will let him. He doesn’t want to hover and suffocate his mate, but his alpha side demands he comfort Steve. The omega doesn’t complain when Tony lies beside him, and he purrs softly, content in his alpha’s arms.
James nods his head and sniffs. Steve cries softly with him. James pulls back slightly and stares into the blue eyes that resemble his own, and with one tiny hand, stretches it out to touch Steve’s cheek.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony quickly assures. “I get it. Steve was gone and you just needed someone. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the someone you needed.”
He spends all night downstairs in the living room, curled up on the sofa, emitting small groans every time his stomach tightens. The pain wasn’t the worst thing he’s ever experienced, but it wasn’t comfortable either.
Steve whines low in his throat, needing to comfort his baby. As if on cue, the door opens and Tony comes in, smelling of coffee and grease. They’ve only been back a few hours and already Tony was hard at work in his workshop.
Peter gulps and unbuttons his jeans, then he lifts his shirt, exposing his flat belly. He flinches when a gel is applied to his skin.
Morgan’s eyes flutter and the nipple from the bottle loosens around her lips. Tony tries to remove it from her mouth, only for her to whimper and try to suck it back in. Tony smiles and let’s her nurse some more until her tummy’s full and she’s dozing off. He lays her down for the night and places a gentle kiss to the top of her head. He makes sure to leave the door open in case she needs him sometime during the night.
Tony groans. “This is torture. You’re lucky I love you and this kid. But now I’m thinking I hate you just a little bit.”
Morgan turns away, glancing down at her bowl of cereal to mask the tears that gather in her eyes. She tries to tell herself that getting worked up over Peter going on a run was stupid, but the little voice in the back of her head is quick to point out that she had asked to go on one and her request had been denied.
He keeps running and fighting his way out until he’s finally outside the compound walls. He doesn’t slow down, using his superhuman speed to outrun the guards.
“Steve, we-you can’t keep him.” Tony stares the dog down, nose wrinkling in disgust when the dog scratches at its ear. Great, the dirty mutt had fleas.
“Again! Daddy, do the other one!” James points at the tree just behind the one his father just blew up.
Steve was becoming more and more like himself. He would occasionally wake during the night from nightmares, but eventually those too didn’t bother him like they used to. He continues to go to his meetings with Sam and Strange, and each time he comes back smiling and gaining more confidence in himself.
“Fine, fine. I’ll make a list tomorrow. I’m gonna need Steve’s input anyway. Speaking of...how is he?”
The man returns with the ring wrapped and placed in a small bag. Tony smiles giddily and accepts the bag. He thanks the man and both he and Happy leave the store.
It takes a moment for Tony to lift his head in Steve’s direction, and when he does, his heart breaks at the sight. Steve is crying, his body shaking with each painful sob. He struggles to pull his pants up, emitting a whimper from the pain the motion brings. He curls up, making himself as small as possible, his back facing Tony.
Peter’s eyes roam over the space. It was simple with a queen size bed in the center, a large acrylic painting of New York above the bed, a bedside table with a lamp, and a dresser against the wall.
“I’m sorry.” Tears are running down Steve’s face now. He gently strokes the bruise on Tony’s cheek with his thumb. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Steve shakes his head. “No. Everything would be so different now. I probably wouldn’t be able to recognize it.”
He doesn’t dwell on those thoughts for long, and instead he focuses on being with Tony right now. His eyes shut and he drifts off to sleep.
Peter stares up at Steve, head cocking in confusion. He’s heard the word multiple times, but has refused to say it. Steve was still holding onto hope.
Steve can only nod and he searches for the spot on Tony’s neck that releases the most of his scent, nosing around until he finds it. He inhales deeply, finding comfort almost instantly. It’s crazy how the small hint of coffee transports him back to the days when it was just the two of them, spending early mornings in the kitchen and being close to each other. Life had seemed so simple then. Back then they had been free.
He doesn’t take the knife like he originally considered. The little orange bottle beside the coffee pot is what captures his attention. Tony had said they weren’t working, and maybe they weren’t doing their job at easing his depression, but Steve was sure if he took just the right amount, that they would help in other ways.
“More!” Peter reaches for the half empty bag, but Steve is faster and moves it further away. Peter whines and tries to climb onto the counter.
The drive is mostly filled with silence. The only sounds that emerge is that of Steve's labored breathing and moans of pain. His eyes are shut and he’s resting his head back against the seat. He finds it’s more comfortable to be reclined in the seat, and he allows himself to rest. His break doesn’t last long, and he hisses in pain when his belly contracts.
That dream of one day working alongside the Avengers all seems like that...just a dream. He no longer has the motivation to have his own suit and his own place on the team. It was a fantasy.
“Okay.” Steve smiles and pecks Tony on the cheek, then he’s rising to his feet. “I’m going to pack her a bag.”
“I know. I guess I’m just ready for this to be done. Maybe next time you can...I mean...if we’re lucky.”
“Oh shit,” Tony mutters and gulps down another drink of coffee. “I gotta go. Pep will kill me if I’m late again.”
The beta in the white coat is easily recognizable. He had been present for all of the check ups and births. He had been the one to take all of Steve’s pups away.
The pain is at its worst and only getting more intense. His body aches from the position he has it in, his heart is beating so hard it feels like it’s going to burst from his chest. All he wants to do is quit. But he knows he can’t.
While Peter waits he replies to an unopened message from Ned, and then once he’s reassured his best friend that he was fine and he’d see him next week, he closes the chat and opens Google. His fingers hover over the keyboard for a second as he contemplates his next move. He types in the word adoption, but that’s as far as he goes. Google offers suggestions, but Peter can’t decide which one to click on.
Five minutes later, omegas begin to trickle into the room. Steve stiffens and glances down, pretending not to notice as the chairs around him start to fill up. The mixture of the sweet scents is soothing, but Steve still can’t help but grow nervous. He’d have to open up and talk to these people about the abuse and torment he’s gone through for the past few years.
The exam room Tony leads Steve to doesn’t compare to the ones he’s used to. Hydra had only made their room exceptional for their potential heir. They didn’t care if Steve was comfortable or not. The bed in the middle of the room lacks the straps Hydra had installed on their beds. At least Steve wouldn’t have to worry about being tied down for the exam.
He serves himself a cup and returns back to the couch, carefully lowering himself down beside Natasha. She’s managed to calm Morgan down and his daughter is no longer fussy, instead her eyes are wide open and trained on Natasha’s smiling face.
Tony gives a small shrug in response. He didn’t mind getting fucked every once and awhile, but he preferred the fucking. The sounds Steve made always went straight to his cock. And the feel of being inside of him was the most incredible feeling.
“A-Alpha, please? Please don’t.” Steve begs, his eyes filling with tears. His pleas go unheard. They always do.
“I know.” Steve rubs along the large bump, smiling when their son pushes against him. “He’s waking up.”
The dog comes closer, his long nails clicking against the floor and he stops beside Tony’s side. Tony moves his hand away when something wet brushes against his skin.
Tony and Bucky don’t break each other’s gaze. Staring into the eyes of The Winter Soldier had Tony’s blood running cold. These had been the last eyes his parents had stared into before their lives were brutally taken from them.
“Not exactly.” Steve pecks Tony on the lips before pulling away and rushing to turn on his old record player, filling the room with a tune from back in the day. He joins Tony again and holds out a hand for him. “Dance with me.”
Flash shakes his head when Peter offers him a Star Wars t-shirt. Peter lets out a sigh and sits next to Flash, ignoring the way his arm brushes against Flash’s.
At least, Steve hoped and prayed they would be. He knew better than to let his guard down around Alpha, no matter the distance between them. Alpha was strong and smart, always one step ahead. Steve was lucky to have escaped when he did. But he wasn’t ready to celebrate his success just yet.
He takes a deep breath to calm himself, eyes squeezing shut when he says those three words. “I love you.”
The pups are fast asleep. Harley is curled up beside his brother, softly snoring. Steve smiles and approaches the bedside, reaching down to gently brush a hand through James’ hair.
Steve doesn’t bother sticking around and he gathers up the blanket they were wrapped in, and goes inside to get ready for bed. He stops by James’ room, poking his head in and watching as Tony comforts the scared pup.
A choked sob escapes Peter and he sets the picture down beside him, then he’s hunching forward and burying his face in his hands, sobbing into them. He wants to scream and cry until the pain is gone, but nothing could ever rid him of this excruciating pain. It was always going to be there.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. “I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t be there for you and him. I’m sorry I didn’t make more of an effort to be in your lives. I’m sorry for all the wrongs I’ve done.”
Of course the first thing they do is scold him for being in the rain. He ignores the lecture and rushes to hug them both.
“I know he promised you another trip,” Sam says sadly. “It’s not the same but we hope it’s enough to remind you of the good times.”
Tony needs to stop doubting himself and believe that he can be a good father, but I understand his way of thinking. He didn’t have the best relationship with his father.
It was definitely not the costume Tony had pictured for his son. His son wanted to be him. Tony Stark. Iron Man didn’t even compare in Peter’s eyes.
Happy had said Tony was on his way back, but the lack of communication on Tony’s part was worrisome. The time zone didn’t help and he wonders if maybe his husband had dozed off on the flight home. Steve would understand if he did. Tony was working harder than ever.
“Alpha thought so. I remember how tiny the pup was. He never cried. I didn’t even get a chance to name him.”
Peter is snapped from his thoughts when he senses someone approaching. He glances over his shoulder to find his Uncle Sam coming down the stairs toward him.
Steve is ready to protest, but he doesn’t get the chance. Another contraction is building and his body bears down on its own. The pressure between his legs increases, along with the burning. Steve whines through it, reaching down again to feel around the baby’s head. Tony’s gaze follows, his stomach dropping at the sight of the dark hair slowly inching forward.
“I know.” Tony glances down to watch Steve rub circles over his belly. “And I’m going to get bigger. Joy.”
“I’m coming,” Steve assures and climbs out of bed. He sneaks a glance in his mate’s direction, not surprised to find Tony undisturbed from his peaceful slumber. Tony rarely got any sleep at all, so finding him still asleep doesn’t bother Steve. He could handle the kids by himself. Tony did a lot and needed a break.
Peter yawns and his eyes fall shut. Tony gives him another kiss before leaving the room and shutting the light off on his way out.
“That looked pretty bad.” Tony frowns and comes over to join his mate on the bed. “Don’t tell me it gets worse.”
They don’t talk much after that. After crawling into bed and snuggling up against his alpha, Steve is on the verge of passing out. He tries to keep his eyes open a little longer, but the comfort Tony naturally brings is what eventually lulls Steve to sleep.
Tony huffs and tips his head back against the seat. “We still have what, three months? Jesus, we do. Fuck.”
“Hey,” Tony soothes when Steve’s eyes grow misty. He cups Steve’s face in his hands. “It’s okay. I know how happy you are about this. I’m sorry for ruining the experience. Pregnancy and me just don’t mix. It’s one of the reasons why I was afraid to do this in the first place. I knew it wasn’t going to be enjoyable for me.”
“No, worse than that. It wasn’t just daily beatings. Steve was treated like property. The pups he had were forced.”
Peter cranes neck to get a better glimpse of his father, but with the amount of activity going on around him, it’s stolen and he’s left to sit alone, wondering about what’s happening.
“I’m thinking that there’s this poor guy who needs my help and I can’t just throw him back into the cold. He has no one. And I mean literally no one.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, his eyes roaming over the pile of boxes that are waiting for him to open. He blows out a breath and runs a hand through his hair.
Everything needed to be perfect. Well, at least that’s what Natasha wanted. She had taken it upon herself to plan the baby shower. Not that Steve or Tony minded. They understood her excitement for their newest family member.
The elevator stops and the doors open. Tony steps out first and Peter trails behind. His brows furrow when he realizes they weren’t at the penthouse.
His alpha snarls in anger and wrestles with the chains, but still he’s unable to rush to Steve’s side.
The last thing he ever expected was to crawl out from the hole he’s being hiding in and receive another letter from Steve. He hasn’t heard from him in years. Of course it was him who had blocked all calls and messages from Steve, but the letters he still got. It was tempting to just forward them back, but he kept every single one of them. He never had the courage to read them and disregarded them like everything else in his life.
The guest room was fine. It was obvious that the room had never been used or bothered with. It was basic.
“He won’t find you. He has no clue that you’re here with me. I’m sure I’m the last person he’d expect. You’ve never met any of the other alphas right?” Tony asks and Steve nods his head. “See? He won’t even think twice about me. You and the baby are fine.”
Then of course there was the party. But Peter doesn’t want to think about that night. He had vowed to never be so stupid and reckless again.
His presence wasn’t going to be welcomed and a part of him regrets not bringing the suit just in case. Perhaps he was overthinking. The team had been his friends at one point, and he didn’t want to believe that they’d turn on him. But if they did decide to shun him, then he’d understand. He had hurt one of their own and walked away from all of them.
“You know he only likes you for your um…” Tony pauses, frowning at his instability to form a proper snarky remark. Natasha chooses to ignore him and instead focuses on cooing over her nephew. “Never mind. Thanks for the help.”
Tony glances up when he hears Steve grunt. “You okay?” he asks and Steve nods his head in response. “You’re a terrible liar. What hurts?”
Sam smiles softly and lowers himself down beside his nephew. “This scene has definitely played out before.”
“It’s very tempting but-” Steve untangles himself from Tony’s arms, chuckling at the frown that appears over his face. “-we did tell your friends about the shower.”
Peter continues to show his discomfort and Tony sighs. Steve is still crying, obviously just as upset as their son.
“I’m still mad at you by the way,” Tony says and he adds more soap to the cloth. He runs it over Steve’s chest, following the trail of bruises until he’s washing along his stomach.
“Still out there, searching for me. I thought once I escaped he’d never find me and I would be safe. My pup would be safe. Now he knows where I am.”
“It was bound to happen sooner or later. He’ll be going to college soon and then living on his own. Maybe get married. He can’t stay with us forever.”
“He’s okay. If he’s anything like you, then he’s going to be okay. Steve, don’t beat yourself up. You didn’t know.”
“Hey,” Bruce says, raising one hand to calm his friend. “I’m not saying you’re the bad guy, Tony. I know you’re trying and changing. I bet everyone else notices too. But it’s Peter who matters more than us.”
With Peter calm and distracted, Tony steps away to assist his mate. “What do you need me to do?” He asks, clasping his hands together. His eyes land on the bag of chocolate chips and he helps himself to a handful.
“It’s like he’s gotten worse,” Rhodey is the next to joke. He makes himself comfortable on the arm of the sofa closest to his best friend. Tony rolls his eyes and flips him off.
Tony scoffs. He can’t believe that Steve didn’t hate him for what he did and didn’t do. Tony’s never hated himself more than he does now. Surly Steve felt the same.
Peter cautiously moves toward the empty sofa across from his uncle Bucky. The stern look hasn’t gone away, and it only makes Peter feel worse. He sinks into the sofa cushion in fear.
“It’s not fair.” Steve’s eyes fill with tears and he wipes at them angrily. “I wanted that baby. I wanted that baby so much.”
“You okay?” Steve asks and he sets the soiled trash can down on the floor. He makes a mental note to clean it out.
“No!” Peter screams again, using his own superhuman strength against his uncle. “Please! Don’t hurt him!”
The grip he has on Steve’s cheek tightens and he forcefully tilts Steve’s neck to the side, exposing the mark Tony had put there. One glance in the steel blue eyes has Steve’s blood running cold.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees and he rubs his belly, smiling when Peter pushes against his palm. “I can’t wait.”
It’s not long before they have their hot chocolate in hand and a large blanket to curl under with. Steve takes his son outside to the porch, and that’s where they drink their hot chocolate under the stars.
“Why? Maybe I should. He’s just a kid and the world is dangerous. Maybe it’s a good thing we lost ours.”
“Good.” Tony pats Happy on the shoulder, then he heads toward the elevator. “Don’t freak him out!” he makes sure to call out before the doors close.
The sound of the heavy metal door opening fills the room and Tony snaps his head up. Two men enter, dressed all in black and masks covering their faces. The guns in their hands aim at him.
“Hey, it’s okay. We don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. I didn’t tell the press about you for a reason. I know you’re not ready, and that’s okay.”
“So what do we do? I don’t want to lose you again.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.
The omega growls when the unwanted hands creep closer to his most intimate place. He goes ignored and the alpha continues to run the cloth over Steve’s body. The scent the alpha gives off changes; he’s getting aroused. It was sick and Steve couldn’t grasp the idea of anyone getting off on this. But he was an omega. He was supposed to pleasure the alphas.
Im updating this on my break. Just some more idiots who can’t admit that they still love each other lol Hope you all enjoy!
Tony is still hesitant, and with cautious steps he joins his husband. Steve glances up, offering a small smile. It’s the first smile Tony has seen in days.
It only takes a few days for the envelope to arrive at the mansion. Tony disregards the rest of the mail that Pepper has forwarded to him, his eagerness to rip into the manila envelope too difficult to ignore. He sneaks away downstairs to his lab, far away from Steve for the big reveal.
When Steve enters the room, he finds Tony lying in the bed, hooked up to a machine, and upon closer inspection, his face is decorated in black and blue bruises.
Steve shakes his head and drinks more of his tea. Tony watches as he swallows the hot liquid. Perfect.
“It’s my fault you’re…” Tony gestures to the small bump Steve is hiding under the sweatshirt. He can’t help but think back to the conversation he had with Pepper. There was no proof that the pup Steve was carrying even was his. He doesn’t dare tell Steve the doubts he still has.
With his glass now empty and the urge for another becoming too much to ignore, he steps away from the group and over toward the bar. While he waits, he leans against the counter and sighs. So much for enjoying the party.
“I thought I’d be ready. I wanted this. I wanted it for so long and now I have it and...and I’m scared. I should be happy, right? I got what I wanted.”
The guilt is gnawing at him, but Tony pushes it aside. He wouldn’t let it consume him. He can’t start regretting what he had done. Not when he had just saved them both.
“It’s hard,” Bruce says, his voice capturing Tony’s attention. “Not having him here has really hurt us. There’s a hole now, one that only he could fill.”
Tony sighs. “Fine, I guess. I zoned out a few times. I couldn’t stop thinking about this really great guy.”
“I know. I’m just...scared.” The last word is said so quietly Steve wouldn’ve missed it if not for his enhanced hearing.
The urge to drink only increases and for a second he considers giving in and following through. But just in the nick of time, Pepper saves him.
Peter understands these meetings are important to his papa and he sits quietly, not making a single sound when the meeting starts. Steve always comes prepared in case he needs to bring his son, and he’s brought Peter’s coloring book and crayons. The little boy works quietly in his book while the grownups talk about bad guys and other superhero stuff.
Steve curls up with his mate, eyes transfixed on the ring on his finger. He had been afraid of marriage and the changes it would bring. He was content just being bonded, but now as he pictures the ceremony and having their friends celebrate their love, he’s excited to get married.
Turning away from them, Tony scans the vast property for something else to test his new invention on. The older pups join in, pointing in various directions and simultaneously yelling at their father to blow up another tree or a big rock.
“You’re a horrible liar.” Tony scoots forward in the chair and reaches out to brush back the blond strands of hair that have fallen in Steve’s face. He smiles at him. “Go to sleep. I’ll be awake in case anything changes.”
“Too much?” Tony peers down at him and with one hand, reaches down to run his fingers through Steve’s messy hair.
Steve snaps out of the haze and blinks a few times before glancing down and finding a large puddle of blood. The alpha he’s holding has stopped fighting, his arms limp against his side. Steve removes his hand from the bloody, smashed in head, and Rollins hits the floor with a thud. He was dead.
Steve isn’t feeling any better by the time he’s on the jet and surrounded by his team. He doesn’t tell them about his fight with Tony, and he definitely doesn’t tell him about the mild cramping in his abdomen. They were only distractions that both himself and his teammates didn’t need.
“Hey, kiddo,” Tony speaks softly to his son. He adjusts Peter into his arms. “What’s up, squirt? You looked so cozy in there. Or did you just want to interrupt daddy? That was it, huh?”
Tony smiles and slips the engagement ring over Steve’s finger. Tony rises to his feet and brings Steve in for a kiss.
It takes a few more solid pushes until the head is born and cupped in his palm. Steve slowly removes the hand he has over his mouth, a shaky laugh leaving him when he feels his pup’s head of soft hair. The next contraction is already building and with a groan, Steve pushes, this time a little harder.
“Maybe you still can.” Pepper reaches for the letter again and the wallet size photo that was attached to it. She shows him the smiling face of a little boy with brown eyes. “He’s your second chance. You can still make things right for him.”
“No one’s coming for you,” Steve says. He walks around the alpha, satisfied that he has his abuser tied up and defenseless. “It’s just you and me.”
Steve whimpers in response. He’s used to dirty talk, but during past foreplay experiences, he wasn’t tied up and blindfolded. It made it more exhilarating.
The door to the conference room opens and Tony walks in. Just the sight and scent of his mate is enough to bring a smile to Steve’s face. Tony greets him the same way and comes over to comfort him. He must smell the sourness in Steve’s scent.
“Should we even bother?” Steve can’t believe he’s asking such a ridiculous question. Deep down he wants nothing more than for them to keep trying until they get lucky, but that little voice in the back of his mind decides to speak up, reminding him of their already failed attempts. What good would another try do? For all he knew they’d end up with the same result.
Tony,” Steve’s voice fills the space. “I know it’s been a while since we’ve...well...you know. I gave up a long time ago on reaching out to you; I knew you had moved on and I tri-I did the same.
“Nothing.” Steve lies. He doesn’t miss the way Sam watches him closely. “Guess it just became a little much. These parties are just so…”
He gets Peter into a clean diaper; it’s not so bad. But then the hard part comes. Steve doesn’t remember the little buttons on Peter’s pajamas being so damn difficult. Peter is still crying, the sound painful to hear.
He remembered being bored out of his mind and eventually being dragged away from the party to meet with Mr. Pierce, but what follows is a blur. He doesn’t remember chasing after an omega. The only omega he remembers is…
Tony smiles. Steve wasn’t one to pass on any sort of activity with their son. Watching movies and catching up on the films he’s missed with Peter was one of his favorites.
With their daughter calm and satisfied with her new playmate, Steve takes Peter as promised. The younger pup is content showing off his building blocks and favorite cars to his mother. Upstairs Steve can hear Sarah’s giggles, the sound bringing a smile to his face.
“You’re welcome. Am I the favorite now?” It’s said as a joke but Morgan was hoping her papa would agree and tell her he loves her more. He wouldn’t of course. He’s said it numerous times that he didn’t have favorites and he loves all of them the same.
Being away from each other was only for a few days, and then Tony would be returning and the loneliness he felt would disappear the moment he pulled Steve into his arms.
He gives up on his work. He wasn’t in the right mindset to continue anyway. He’d rather go back upstairs and drink until he blacks out. But he can’t.
“Hey, look at me,” Tony reaches out and lifts Steve’s chin so their eyes meet. “He’s not going to find you. I won’t let him. You’re safe. You and that baby are safe. I promise.”
Instead he casually walks the trails of the park a few blocks from Steve’s new home. He takes a break on one of the nearby benches to enjoy his cup of coffee and the warm sun.
Tony is awoken during the middle of the night to the sounds of Steve’s retching. The light is on in the adjoined bathroom and the door is slightly ajar. Tony gets out of bed to investigate, pushing open the door and finding his husband on his knees and clinging tightly to the toilet bowl.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Steve assures. He knew how guilty his mate felt. He’d never blame Tony for the trouble they found themselves in. It wasn’t the alpha’s fault.
Before Rumlow can shoot again, Steve grabs him by his shirt and yanks him close, then with one hand, collides his fist with the alpha’s mouth. Steve throws him to the ground and kicks him hard in the side, forcing a pained grunt from the alpha’s bloodied lips. Brock tries to shoot his gun, but Steve is faster and he rips it out of the alpha’s hand and tosses it to the side, leaving the bully completely defenseless.
The burp Peter releases is bigger than Tony expected and he can’t help the small giggle he makes in reaction to it.
Steve gives Peter back his puppy and leans down to kiss his son’s brown curls. Peter tries to break free again, but one stern look from Steve has the pup frowning and lying back with a huff.
Tony’s attention falls on the letter again and he snatches it up, ripping into it and taking out the letter inside. He slants back in his chair and begins reading.
The alpha tightens his grip around him, threatening the omega if another sound was made. Steve didn’t care if he was kicked and punched, he didn’t care if he was bloodied and bruised. He didn’t matter.
“Someone’s ready to meet you,” the nurse says, her smile growing brighter. She wheels the baby over and carefully places him into Steve’s outstretched arms.
Steve groans when a hand touches his shoulder and shakes him gently. He opens his eyes and yawns. “Hmm?”
“How’d that go by the way?” Steve asks and he begins draining the tub and cleaning up the mess he’s made during bath time. “Besides boring.”
“Please come back,” Peter whispers. He doesn’t know how many times he murmured those three words. He had done it that night on the jet, and again all the other nights following. He’d probably be saying them for the rest of his life.
“Sir,” Jarvis pipes up and an alert pops up on one of Tony’s screens. “You have a calendar reminder.”
“You talk,” Sam lies back and rests his head against the pillow, his eyes struggling to stay open. “Tell me what you’re feeling because I know you won’t open up again.”
“I never thought that I would have a mate or pups, but then you literally ran into my life, and changed everything. You’re it for me, Steve. You and the kids are all I want. I love you. I don’t care what life throws at us, we’ve already proved we can handle anything. I promise to love you and our pups for the rest of my life. I promise to be a good father, mate, husband and alpha. Will you marry me?”
“He’s busy too, kiddo. Don’t worry about him. He’ll warm up to you.” Tony wraps his arm around Peter’s shoulders, guiding him out of the foyer and toward the massive living room.
Something inside the desk drawer catches his eye and his brows furrow. There’s two envelopes inside, one with his name scribbled on one and his dad’s on the other. Peter takes both. He doesn’t open the one for his dad, and a part of him is afraid to open the one for him, but his curiosity beats the fear and he tears into the envelope.
Peter doesn’t respond and instead tries to slip out of the bathroom. But he’s not that lucky and Flash is stopping him, the hand on his shoulder tightening
Both boys are dressed and at the table by the time Tony makes it downstairs. He greets both of them with kisses and tousles their hair. Both Harley and Peter giggle.
They’re led to a control room of some sorts and that’s where they find the Director. Beside him are a beta man and woman that Steve had never met before.
But it wasn’t being on a team that Tony was struggling with. His feelings for Steve was the reasoning behind his decision to leave. It was the only way he’d get over Steve for good.
“I know it’s not something you’re used to,” Steve says and Tony glances up at him. “You probably usually get more tasteful things but...I hope you like it anyway.”
Sam is the one who calls the meeting a few weeks later. His arm was healing nicely and no longer a concern of his. He couldn’t say that for his husband. Bucky was constantly checking on him and making sure he was comfortable. Sam enjoyed the break, but it was time to get back to business.
“What’s this, Dodge?” Steve questions, picking the toy up to examine it and making a face when he finds it slobbered on. “This isn’t for the baby is it?”
Steve shifts uncomfortably at the thought of having to talk about the man that destroyed his life. Tony immediately senses the hesitation and backs off.
It’s not until Steve is returning a few minutes later with the diaper bag and stroller does Tony hesitate letting Steve go alone. He’s ready to tag along, only to stop himself. He didn’t want to ruin their bonding time. And he trusted Steve. Everything was going to be fine.
“Do you still want to help me with this?” Steve asks when he senses Tony’s attitude shift at the mention of the baby. He didn’t understand why Tony was acting different when just a few hours ago he was talking about getting items for the baby.
“Tony?” Bruce’s voice breaks through the quiet and both Peter and Tony peer up at him. He’s fiddling nervously with his fingers, but there’s a hint of a smile on his face. Tony immediately jumps to his feet and Peter follows. “He’s stable now. They said you can see him,” Bruce informs.
Tony grimaces, stepping back when the dog has set its attention on him and comes over, still wagging its tail. Its nose is cold and wet, and Tony quickly pulls his hand away. “Go. Shoo!” he waves the dog away, ignoring the chuckling coming from his boyfriend.
For the most part everything was good. She was lucky to have such a close knit relationship with her family members. Not everyone could say that. But it wasn’t just their closeness she loved. They were a family of superheroes.
Tony lies back and watches as Steve rides him, enjoying the way the omega whimpers and moans as he fucks himself on the alpha’s cock, as he takes what he needs.
“I think I’d remember if you did. I wish I had some magic serum. My back fucking hurts and my head…” Tony reaches up to touch the bump he knows will be there for days, and winces.
Happy runs back into the bedroom. Steve has never seen him so terrified. Usually the beta came off as tough and fearless.
“I mean it. I’ve wanted to know you and now that I can...I don’t know. I just don’t want it to turn bad or anything.”
The hours tick by agonizingly slow. Steve knew labor progressed differently for everyone, but it was like Tony’s was going slower than normal. Peter had already proved that he was going to take after Tony with his stubborn attitude, and now wasn’t any different. Their son just refused to budge.
A soft sniff and then Peter is looking up at him, his own dark eyes full of tears. “I’m sorry, mama. I was just playing. He told on me!” Peter points at his brother.
Deep down he wanted to be bonded and share a life with a mate. They had so much that still needed to be revealed. But the pup in his belly was already the strongest connection they had. Steve wanted to know if there was more.
Steve pants through the pain, tears gathering in his eyes when it intensifies. He’s been through this enough times to know what to expect, but each time he struggles to cope with the pain brought on by the contractions.
“What?” Tony asks innocently as he cuts into his chicken breast. “It’s true. The baby needs all the nutrients it can get.”
Steve was at least thankful this alpha let him wash himself. Rumlow always made sure he participated.
He needs to step away from the party and he disappears from the common room and hides out on the stairs. He leans against the railing and takes a deep breath to calm his nerves. His stomach churns and his head spins. Steve’s unsure if it’s the party that’s overwhelming or knowing in a couple of months he’d be a father.
The smile that forms over Alexander’s face has Tony’s stomach coiling tightly. He braces himself for another punch or kick; something, but it never comes. That scares him even more.
Peter does as he’s told, but it’s easier said than done. He hasn’t been comfortable since he stepped foot through the front door.
Tony chuckles and takes a drink from his glass, then he sets it down and gives the menu a quick look over; he already knows what he wants.
Morgan doesn’t reply. She loved her brother and everyone else in their family, but lately it was like they didn’t love or care about her. She was always being pushed aside and forgotten. They were getting all the love, something she desperately yearned for.
Steve takes a shaky breath. His eyes burn with fresh tears. He wants to confess how he feels and the thoughts he’s been having, but he can’t bring himself to do it. He doesn’t want to be a burden anymore. They don’t deserve to suffer because he’s a failure.
It’s well into the afternoon by the time Peter returns to the compound. He doesn’t find his aunt in her apartment or down in the common room. He considers going to hang out with his uncles, but they’d probably want some space. He doesn’t know their full story and has been too afraid to ask.
Tony becomes a blur, just another memory that Steve forces himself to forget. If Tony wanted to be selfish and move on, then damn it Steve was going to do the same. He could be selfish if he tried hard enough. His whole life he had always been putting others before himself. But things were going to change. His happiness and his son’s happiness was being pushed to the front of the line.
“These are the pups,” Steve introduces his children next. “Harley,” he says and places a hand over the little boy’s messy hair. “And James.”
“I’m his best friend so I’m cutting,” Bucky says, only to halt when Natasha holds up a warning finger. “Or not. Here’s fine.”
The sound of his pup’s distress has Steve leaning in close to get a look at Tony’s phone. Steve frowns when he takes in the sight of Happy’s slightly disheveled hair and the green and blue scribbles along his face.
Natasha cocks her head in confusion. “Nothing happened. We just wanted to check on you and-” she pauses and holds up a bottle of Chardonnay. “-we brought wine.”
Morgan peers up at him, drawn to the familiar voice. She keeps her eyes trained on his face while he talks to her.
“Wow. She’s gotten so big,” Peter beams. The last time he saw her was the day after she was born. It was difficult for him to drop by the compound when he was caught up with school and being the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. “Can I um…?”
“Whoa, hang on. Just because I tolerate him doesn’t mean...you’re delusional. Must be from giving birth or something.”
When Tony arrives at the compound, he takes a moment to collect himself before going inside. He takes deep, slows breaths to steady his rapidly beating heart. The suffocating feeling returns and he has to fight the urge to rip the tie off.
“He’s not eating,” Tony explains in a hushed tone. Happy directs his gaze on the omega then he’s turning back to Tony.
“Dammit,” Tony mutters under his breath. He presses a little harder on the accelerator. “Steve, listen to me. I’m almost home. I’ll be there. Just like I promised. But I need you to calm down. Can you do that for me?”
“We can stop,” he whispers. His hands rub along Steve’s shoulders and down to his arms. “You don’t have to help me.”
It should be Rogers. Stark shouldn’t even be on the table. Clint had been right about Tony being invisible. Everyone knew that Tony Stark wasn’t going to step up and care for his son, so why the hell should the baby take his last name?
Tony nods and hands Peter the tablet. “I’m still working on it. Maybe we can brainstorm or something. We’re really good at that.”
“I swear you two are always together,” Steve says with a shake of his head. He collapses on the couch beside Tony, letting his head fall back against the sofa. Dodger is up from his spot near Tony to greet Steve with a lick.
Tony is ready to protest, but he decides against it, not wanting to upset his husband anymore. He gets up and leaves the room, slowly pulling the door closed. He pauses before it shuts completely, his ears filling with soft sniffles. He peers through the crack of the door, his heart breaking at the sight of Steve crying.
Tony works quickly at shedding his clothing and then positions himself between Steve’s spread legs. He trails a hand down to his cock and leads it to Steve’s entrance, teasing the pink rim before pressing inside.
Each step is difficult, but Steve knows better than to show even a hint of pain. The alphas found his discomfort pleasurable and made sure to inflict more damage just to get a kick out of it. It was cruel, but no one was worse than the head alpha.
A moment of silence passes between them. A part of Peter wants his papa to leave him alone, but the other half wants the comfort and encouragement his papa never failed to give.
, Steve thinks to himself. He doesn’t voice that thought out loud though. Tony hasn’t said if he liked the idea, which made Steve believe that it wasn’t a thought Tony had. Marriage didn’t seem like Tony Stark’s style. Or at least that’s what Steve used to believe. He didn’t think Tony was into a serious relationship or becoming a father. But Tony had proved Steve wrong on both accounts.
He wouldn’t be like Howard. He’d be better. He’d show Peter everyday just how much he loved him. It was difficult for him to show affection but for his own son it would come easy. Peter would always know how much he was loved and cared for.
After dinner Bucky excuses himself and hides away like he always does. Peter doesn’t go after him, deciding to give him space.
Tony rolls his eyes and escorts the kid outside. Just like the last time, Tony makes sure Peter gets across the street safely. He watches for a while until his son blends in with the rest of the crowd of New Yorkers.
Peter looks around, for a moment forgetting that the AI was everywhere. He doesn’t know where to look but up.
When the next contraction starts, he blows out a breath and leans forward, pushing as hard as he can. This time he can’t conceal his cries of pain and a scream rips through his throat. He uses both hands to grasp the baby, and with another strong push and yell, he delivers the pup from his body.
Steve smiles and gives the bump another kiss before taking his original spot beside Tony and pulling him close. He knows they should probably get cleaned up and change the sheets, but he’s enjoying holding Tony.
“Yeah.” Tony smiles and rubs Steve’s belly fondly. “He’ll be here soon. Tell you what, after I get back we’ll get the nursery started and then plan your birthday and a baby shower.”
Steve leaves the room in the rush, not wanting Tony to see how flustered he was getting. But Tony had already seen in and he can’t help but smile at the way Steve reacted. Seeing Steve flustered wasn’t something everyone got to witness, but he’s been one of the lucky ones to see it, and he found it adorable.
The call ends, and with a huff, Tony scrubs a hand along his face. He wasn’t going to give up, not when he had a chance of making Steve feel like himself again. It would be easy to hire someone else to watch Morgan; he had the resources to do a proper background check to insure he hired the best, but that would be too time consuming.
Tony returns with Harley and joins his family back on the sofa. Harley plops down on lap, accidentally spilling some of his milk. He gasps and stares wide eyed at the mess, blue eyes glistening with tears.
The room falls silent. Sam immediately lets Bucky go, eyes wide. Even Peter and Alpine have their full attention on Bucky.
Peter is gently placed down in the middle of the large bed. He stirs in his sleep and lets out a small yawn. Steve heads to the bathroom to get a washcloth to clean his son’s face. He’s not surprised when he returns to find Tony curled up around Peter.
You guys I am so sorry! Life has been crazy and then I decided to take a little break from writing. I ended up binging a show (Teen Wolf. I know I’m super late 🤦♀️) but I’m ready to make more time for writing now. I definitely missed it! Thank you so much for being patient and for always supporting me 😊
“If you’d like,” the doctor says, sensing the omega’s hesitancy. “Again, I’m not here to pressure you okay? I’m trying to help.”
Peter turns back to the unopened message and taps on the icon to read the text from his dad. Another smile breaks across his face as he reads the message.
He plops down in a chair at his workbench and turns in it, brows furrowing as he slips the paper out of the envelope. He skims through it, reading through the printed words until he finds what he’s been waiting for.
I’m so sorry this is on the short side! I’ve been so busy lately and life just keeps getting crazier. I thought a quick update was better than none 😆
Peter hasn’t even registered the tears in his eyes until small drops of water land on the letter. He quickly tries to wipe them away and not smear the ink. He reads over it again and again and again until he’s sure it’s embedded in his mind. It was all he had left.
“Um...I’m not sure.” Steve can’t help but frown again. He was never told the details about his pup. It wasn’t his to worry about. All of his pups belonged to Hydra.
“Dad’s here,” Peter begins and he sighs again. “He left though. Maybe next time he’ll stay and talk to you. I don’t know. He’s...kind of difficult. I’m trying to get to know him and so far it’s been...fine. I’m still learning about him.
His stomach churns and the urge to vomit makes itself known. He fights it and takes a deep breath to calm himself.
Peter snaps out of it when he hears his name being called. He blinks a few times before settling his eyes on the doctor in front of him. Both Doctor Banner and his papa are frowning at him.
“Pancakes!” Harley runs into the kitchen and takes a peek into the bowl of batter. He reaches into the bowl to scoop some to taste and Steve has to take the bowl away. “No fair. I wanted some!”
Happy huffs and glances down at the speedometer; he was already going fast, and any faster would be too dangerous.  “I would go faster but-” Happy pauses when Steve lets out another cry of pain. “-I’m going as fast as I can. We’ll be there soon okay?”
He wonders what his son is doing and if he was even doing okay. His next visit with Bruce wasn’t for a few more weeks and that reminder dampens his mood. It’s not until he remembers someone else’s capabilities.
“Steve!” Pepper cries and rushes toward him, embracing him in a tight hug. He hugs back and inhales her scent. Pepper pulls back, leaving her hands on his shoulders as she studies him. “Oh my God! You’re alive!”
He smiles at the familiar color scheme; red, white, and blue would always mean something to him. But it’s the star in the center that makes his heart clench in the most painful way. Beside the suit is the helmet he remembers wearing as a kid, and then there’s the shield.
The room fills with the wet, slurping sounds of Tony’s tongue lapping up the slick leaking from Steve’s hole. The omega keens, his toes curling from the intense pleasure that courses through him.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony assures. He remembers Steve struggling to get her to latch on the night before, and he curses to himself for not getting out of bed first. “You should have let me handle it.”
The contraction ends and Steve rushes to gather his belongings for the hospital. He regrets coming out to the lake house. If they were back at the compound then he’d only have to go down to the medbay to give birth. The lake house was their private home, and at the time it had been perfect to hide away until their daughter arrived. Steve hadn’t anticipated Tony’s emergency and the baby’s early arrival.
The moment Steve is in the shower and the hot water hits his back, he lets out a sigh and leans forward, resting his head against the tiled wall. The water burns against his battered skin, but at the same time it’s bringing relief to his aching muscles.
It’s difficult to carry most of his weight, but she tries, not ready to give up. It wasn’t her style to forfeit, especially when the lives of her friends were on the line. Natasha grits her teeth and pushes forward, holding onto Steve as hard as she can.
Tony nods and glances down at his lap while he wrings his hands together. Natasha continues to sip her wine, probably feeling pretty pleased with herself. Tony wonders if she would’ve found more joy in beating him to a pulp. Or maybe she was leaving that for Bucky.
“Nah,” Steve decides, though the look in his eyes says something totally different. “This works. This is fine.”
Sam places a hand over Peter’s shoulder. “It’ll get better. I wish I could say tomorrow or next week, but it will get easier. He wants you to be happy. It’s all he’s ever wanted.”
“I’m not skilled with cakes or anything but I tried,” Peter says with a little shrug. “Do you like it?”
“Bingo. And in my favorite color.” Tony smirks and takes the cuffs from Steve’s hands. “It’ll be fun. I’ll tie you up, maybe blindfold you.”
The oldest looks to be about five years of age. His dark hair is askew and his blue eyes full of fear. Beside him is another little boy, no more than three-years-old, with messy blond hair and blue eyes like the older pup. In the older boy’s arms is a smaller pup with golden hair.
“They’ll find him,” Bruce catches himself saying. He’s not sure if she’ll believe him. He doesn’t even believe himself. Tony was gone and there was no sign of his body or Steve’s or-
The nightmares never stop. Some nights they’re not as intense, but other nights, this like one, are when they are at their worst.
“It’s okay,” Tony soothes. He grunts softly and Steve lifts his head, noticing the pain written on Tony’s face. It wasn’t right that Tony was suffering too and Steve could do nothing about it. “Worry about you for once,” Tony says.
“You need to rest,” Steve reminds him and he steps into the room. Tony peers up at him and sighs. “I mean it. How do you expect to get better?”
Steve shakes his head and groans. “Tony, it hurts. Something’s not right. I think I need to go to-” he gasps suddenly and his eyes shoot down. Then that’s when Tony sees the red stain covering the sheets. “Tony!” Steve cries out in panic.
“So you’ll be Captain America forever and I guess I’ll be your...sidekick?” Peter asks, a little unsurely.
“You know you told me to listen to you and not that voice, but guess what, Tony? I am listening to you, and you’re starting to sound just like that voice.”
“I’m not. I’m...I’m scared,” Steve admits and he plops back down. “I’m scared he’ll find me and...Tony, he’ll hurt me again.”
Steve only wishes she had decided to make her grand entrance when Tony was still in town. He had been called for a meeting in Hong Kong to address some of the issues his tower was experiencing. It wasn’t something he could easily get out of-Pepper made sure of that- but he had assured Steve he'd make it back before Morgan arrived.
“No.” Tony shakes his head. “I don’t care. To me you’ve always been perfect, but now you’re absolutely stunning. You gave me the greatest gift in the world.”
Steve silences him with another kiss. “I’m okay,” he assures. “This is okay. I actually wanted...I don’t know. I was hoping…”
Eventually the penthouse becomes too small, and it’s Tony’s idea to move his family somewhere with open space and privacy. Retiring from the team was bound to happen sooner or later, and it was the birth of their son that gave Steve and Tony that final push.
Tony’s watched the video so many times he’s almost lost count. He keeps his eyes on his son, taking in his expression as he experiences the video for the first time.
For the most part he’s able to keep quiet. Natasha is the first to track him down and fish for information. She finds him in the gym-a place he usually goes to think and be alone- and he’s forced to stop punching his third bag to greet her. She isn’t dressed in anything indicating that she wants to train, leaving him to assume that she just wants him to talk.
“Hey, it’s okay,” MJ assures. She looks him over, that frown on her face never leaving. It only makes Peter feel worse. “I didn’t know you were back.”
For a moment Peter considers telling his uncle where he’s really been, but he holds back. His uncle would kill him for sure.
“Look at me, Tony!” Steve’s voice raises slightly and he steps back to give Tony a better view of his flaws. “I’m so...disgusting.”
“Isn’t he always? Wait, why is he still here? You can’t keep him forever, Tony. He’s not some stray you adopted off the street!” Happy hisses.
“Let’s do something simple,” Steve had to remind him again. “We can order in, watch a movie, have sex.”
The next room he’s taken to is familiar. It’s a complete contrast to the one he was in before. The walls are painted a deep red and the floor is a shiny hardwood, but it’s not the burst of color that captures Steve’s attention.
“You’ve been asleep, Cap,” Are the first words Nick says. A scene like this has played out before, back when Steve had first woken up from his 65 year slumber.
Lunch is only slightly better. Peter doesn’t eat, picking at the fries and sandwich he regrets getting. Ned is the only one participating in their conversation, but that’s fine. Peter enjoys hearing him talk.
Having Steve meet with the doctor in the safety of their own home is relieving, but Tony can’t help but wonder if Steve would still struggle to open up. He was still having issues letting Tony in. Some days were better, but it was clear that he didn’t want to release all of his pent up feelings. Tony’s hoping after today, Steve would feel more comfortable.
“A lot.” Steve pulls away and turns to meet Tony’s eyes. “I know you said you’d wait until I was ready again, and...and I think I am now.”
Steve is exhausted by the time they get back up to the penthouse, and the first thing he does is go up the stairs to the bedroom. He lets out a sigh and plops down on the bed, eyes falling shut the moment his head hits the pillow. Not even a few minutes later a knock on the door disturbs him and he sits up right when Tony enters the room.
“Yeah!” Peter’s response is shocking. The last Tony heard was that his son was struggling to find the perfect costume. He honestly didn’t blame him. Every year something new was coming out. It could be a little overwhelming.
They’re lying in bed, settling down for the night and curled up with each other. Steve as usual has his hands on Tony’s belly. It’s grown and starting to resemble a pregnant belly. Tony still keeps it hidden until they can come out to the rest of the world, but when it’s just them, he exposes the bump and lets Steve touch it.
“Stop!” Peter cries out in frustration. Both adults fall silent and finally acknowledge him. “Stop yelling.”
The simple life his papa wanted was never going to exist. They weren’t going to get the chance to live in Brooklyn.
Steve smiles softly and pulls Tony back into his arms. “I know. You’re almost there,” he says, laying a hand over Tony’s belly and gently caressing the spot where he feels their son.
“You want to do what?” Nick eventually asks, his tone dripping with irritation. This conversation mirrors the one Steve had with him fifteen years ago. Steve reminds himself how that conversation ended, and he’s hopeful this one would be the same.
“No more scraps of paper and that broken pencil you use. Now you have all this.” Tony waves a hand over the brown leathered bag that houses the supplies.
“Right now it’s the cut on my face,” Steve points at the large gash running down the side of his head. “It’s okay. I’ll be brand new in the morning.”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I love you.” He purposely doesn’t say he loves the baby. That would be lying.
Tony nods and moves toward the closet, opening the door and poking his head inside. He’s seen worse but it was nice to know that Steve Rogers had clutter.
“And I know you’d never hurt him,” Sam says softly and kisses the top of Bucky’s head. “You need to not be so…”
It wasn’t, at least not entirely. He never considered his unborn child a mistake. Unplanned was what it was. Never a mistake.
“If one on one isn’t working then I can recommend a group session,” Dr. Strange says. Steve’s ears perk up at that. It would help get him back out into the world and meet new people. People that were just like him.
“It’s fine,” Tony quickly says when he notices the omega’s nervous energy. “I don’t want to push you into anything, remember? We can order everything and have it delivered.”
“I’m here, Petey,” Steve assures and he takes his son into his arms, holding him close and shushing him. “You’re going to be okay. You’re safe.”
As usual, Rumlow and Rollins escort him to their leader’s room. He is shoved a little too harshly inside, something that goes unnoticed by Alpha. Their leader is on the opposite side of the room, pouring himself a drink at the bar. He peers up when he senses their presence, a smile forming over his face.
Flash makes sure no one is paying them any mind before he starts. “I want to talk to you about the…thing.”
“I know. Sorry. This is just-” Tony releases a breath, leaning back on his haunches and running a hand through his already messed up hair. “Fuck, Steve! I don’t know what to do! I never thought-”
Morgan smiles. She contemplates telling him about the rest of her day, even though she knows her dad won’t be thrilled about hearing about the cute boy in her class. He was so protective of her. It got annoying sometimes.
“And crying,” Natasha rounds the sofa to take the empty spot beside him. She glances in the direction of the tv and a frown appears over her face. “Why are you watching
Bruce nods his head in agreement. “You did. And he’s the reason for it. You two make a good couple.”
Despite wanting to hide away from the harsh reality, Tony knows he can’t. Lord knows Jarvis wouldn’t approve if he tried to pretend that he didn’t feel anything.
“No,” Steve says with a shake of his head. The pain was beginning to taper off. “I’m okay. It’s gone now.”
Sam and Bucky step into the room, both bringing items of their own. Sam has a few balloons and Bucky has a blue teddy bear. Steve can’t help but smile at the sight of them.
“Relax,” Steve soothes. With his free hand he reaches down to grip Tony’s cock, stroking it to distract Tony from the sting. He inches more of his finger inside, ears straining for any sounds of discomfort.
Tony sighs heavily and takes the few steps toward Steve. He takes the bottle and studies it for a second before handing it back.
Knowing there was no point in lying, Peter nods. “Do you guys have to go? Isn’t there anyone else? Uncle Thor can do it, right?”
“Relax, kiddo,” Tony waves Peter off. “We just haven’t used that thing in a while. Maybe we should,” Tony says those last words to his husband, who nods in response.
The room he finds himself in is bare, devoid of any windows, and a single door is bolted tight into the wall opposite of him. The room is illuminated by swinging bulbs above him. They twitch every few seconds.
There’s a sense of relief knowing that he had another person on his side. He felt he could trust Nick now. His child would be safe and receive the best care. No harm would ever come to him or her.
“Are you sure?” Steve appears wary, not that Tony blames him. It was difficult at times to take care of Morgan, especially when both of them were running on very little sleep. But Tony was confident he could manage just fine.
“I didn’t mean it like that. Well, I mean they both can be exhausting. You know what I’ll go now. Sleep tight, Pete.”
Another whimper comes from the omega. Steve tries to make himself even smaller, and despite his large frame, he manages to pull it off. He was the one who was really broken.
“Nope. I’m surprised he’s even letting me feed him now. He fought all day with the bottle. Guess he misses being fed from the source.”
The omega’s eyes shoot open at the sound of his name, his brows knitting together in confusion. He looks around the room, immediately recognizing it as the guest room in Tony’s mansion. But it’s not the familiarity of the room that eases Steve’s anxious mind- the comforting scent of the alpha is what calms him.
Hello! I hope everyone is doing well and had a wonderful holiday! I had meant to post this earlier, but life got in the way. I'm off the next few days so I'm going to update this one again and hopefully finish it. These two need their happy ending!
Tony hums. “Yeah. We’ll figure it out okay? Let’s focus on this first. I don’t want you stressing out.”
He gives the room a look over, searching for anything that could ease the ache until he had the alpha near him again. He spots what he can only assume is a closet, and with both his curiosity piqued and the urge to have the alpha near him overwhelming, Steve crosses the room to search for something belonging to Tony.
Now that he’s alone, those tears run freely down his face. A choked sob escapes him and he buries his face with both hands. It’s a struggle to remain standing, his legs give out and he slides down to the floor. He tries to keep his cries to himself, but the pain is unlike anything he’s ever experienced.
It was difficult to imagine spending a few days with him while Tony traveled to New York. Steve doesn’t want to think about that trip either. He was going to be fine. He had Jarvis and Happy. That should be enough.
And now with the approaching holiday, Steve was looking forward to it. Their first year together, Tony had gone overboard with gifts, showering Steve with large bouquets of flowers, boxes of chocolates, and stuffed animals too big to fit into the apartment. The gesture was sweet but too much. Tony made sure to tone it down, albeit the best he could. It was still Tony, which meant that though a large stuffed animal didn’t happen, he made up for it with another extravagant gift. At least a wristwatch could fit into their home...until Steve learned it cost a few million dollars.
“By who? Where are we?” Tony’s unable to get a proper look at the room he woke up in. He tries to sit up again, only to give up when the gunshot wound in his back throbs.
His phone is sitting on the nightstand beside his bed, and he reaches for it, finding the number he hasn’t called in a while. He’s not expecting anyone to pick up, but after the third ring, Tony’s voice is on the other line.
“I’m fine, Steve. I’ve been doing this a lot longer than you think.” Steve crossed his arms like a disappointed housewife and the obvious frustrated silence made Tony turn back around and sigh heavily at the expression on his teammate’s face “What?” He groaned and Steve’s face softened from almost anger to worry.
“Oh, fuck. Steve, I’m going to cum.” Steve made a non-noise and rested his forehead against Tony’s shoulder.
They hardly broke from the kiss as Steve continued stretching out Tony’s hole, though Steve did get impossibly more desperate as he started to gently rock his hips the longer he took. But he knew that Tony had to be ready, and the last thing he wanted to do was hurt the man he loved. That was for a better time, when they’d discussed it. So, when Tony was ready, Steve took hardly any time to reach over to his jeans and take out the condom he had in the back pocket, moaning hardly audibly as he put it on and then slowly pushed into Tony. The other man’s mouth silently dropped open and he tightly grabbed onto Steve’s biceps as he lifted his hips up just sightly “Oh my… Fuck, Steve.” He whimpered gently. They’d done this quite a few times, and even before then Tony had been a receiver a couple of times, but each time was so intense for him since he spent his whole time subconsciously on edge and every nerve was practically screaming to tense while also wanting this to carry on because it felt so good. Steve stopped for a second as his hips pressed flush against Tony’s, trailing his hands across Tony’s body; Across his chest and stroking the arc rector, down his shoulders and arms only to go back up, caressing his legs while Tony managed to mutter an almost unintelligible plea for him to stop the touches and “Fucking do me already”. Steve chucked and then took Tony’s right hand in his, lacing their fingers together, as he started to slowly pull his hips back. He gasped out a moan as he sheathed himself fully into Tony again, keeping up the slow pace until Tony was finally fully relaxed and wordlessly begging for Steve to properly fuck him.
“If you think you can handle it.” Tony looked him in the eyes and sighed softly before moving to kiss him gently.
“You talk too much.” He mumbled with a smile, watching his lover desperately try to reign in his desperate need to find release. Tony had his eyes closed just gently, his bottom lip caught between his teeth and breathy moans slipped from his mouth, though muffled.
“I’m fine.” He said as Steve forced him to turn so that the supersoldier could look over him. There were deep purple bags under his bloodshot eyes, his face pale with both hidden exhaustion and hunger that he tried to ignore in favour of doing work that he could easily fit between looking after himself if he bothered. He was tense, muscles tight under Steve’s hands as the blond rested his hands on the shorter man’s shoulders.
He stepped closer behind Tony, close enough that he was sure that the soldier’s body heat would be felt for definite. His arms snaked around Tony’s waist and he rested his chin on the other man’s shoulder “Really Steve?” Tony seemed to radiate in anger yet Steve didn’t let up, knowing that his little plan would make Tony eventually see it his way. He turned his head slightly and nuzzled his noise against Tony’s neck gently. Though the latter man made a slight disgruntled noise, he didn’t make a move to push Steve’s head away “I’m busy.” He urged, hoping Steve would miraculously decide against this and go away. Hoping doesn’t mean it ever happened.
They’re both on the sofa. Alpine is in his lap, purring softly as he scratches behind her ear. Sam almost doesn’t want to disturb his husband’s pleasant mood. These days anything could set Bucky off.
Steve is in the bedroom, sitting on the bed with something in his hand. Tony ignores the item at first and leans in to greet his husband with a kiss to the cheek. Steve doesn’t even acknowledge him, at least not the way he usually does. It has Tony growing concerned.
He’s forced to stop when gunfire rings out and he quickly pulls himself up onto the ceiling when more men appear. The bullets zip through the dimly lit corridors, striking the enemies and they fall to the floor. Then Peter knows why. His uncle Bucky was responsible.
“I don’t know how to say this,” Tony starts. His head is throbbing again. That’s what he gets for skipping out on caffeine this morning. “Okay, here’s what’s up. That omega, guy, Steve. That’s his name by the way. He um how do I put this...so Happy almost hit him with the car yesterday-”
It was pathetic, he knew this and his team must know it too. He doesn’t miss the sympathetic looks sent his way when his phone rings and he rushes to answer it, only to discover it’s Hill, Fury or his doctor. No one else calls.
At those words, Steve is snapping his head up in Tony’s direction, his jaw clenching. If he wants to say something, he decides against it and directs his attention back to Morgan. He finally has her latching on and it’s not long before she’s greedily taking her fill. The room is silent, all except for the suckling sounds Morgan produces while she eats.
Tony grows silent. He honestly doesn’t know when their lives will find a sense of normalcy. Morgan had changed a lot. Tony doesn’t regret her and the way she altered everything. And he knows deep down Steve feels the same way.
“N-Nat,” Steve rasps. He winces when he tries to move toward her, the pain from his wound worsening. He grunts and slumps back against the wall, his legs threatening to give out.
They didn’t work. They barely managed to create a friendship and the romantic relationship they decided to try crumbled. Tony should’ve known it was a bad idea from the start. They weren’t capable of loving each other. They fought more than anything. At least, that used to be the case.
“You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to. But if you ever need to talk then don’t hesitate. I’m here practically everyday. Stop by whenever you want.”
They eat in silence, the uncomfortable feeling only growing more intense with each passing second. Steve’s starving, but he holds off, taking small unsure bites. Alpha watches him closely.
“Did he turn green?” Bucky asked with a frown. “You need to just stop at McDonald’s when he wants some. Trust me.”
“Will you two stop it!” Natasha intervenes and both Sam and Bucky fall silent. She waits until she holds everyone’s attention before continuing. “Sam’s right. This isn’t about us. It’s about Peter. He’s the one dealing with the most right now. Steve meant something to all of us but to Peter he meant so much more. Do you really think Steve would want us keeping his son away from Tony? Steve didn’t want that, remember? He wanted Peter to know Tony.”
Steve chokes back a sob and Tony wraps his arms around him, bringing him close until Steve is pressed against him. Steve clings to him tightly, releasing the sobs that wrack through him.
Tony doesn’t want to think about Steve now. He had spent all night drinking and wishing he had done something right. There was guilt regarding his son, but the guilt he had for Steve was much worse. He’d never forgive himself.
Those words sting. Tony’s thrown hurtful words at him before during past arguments, but none of them have hurt more than the words Tony is saying now.
Peter continues to voice his displeasure, the sounds he produces rising in volume. The first thing Tony wants to do is panic. He reminds himself that he’s been able to get Peter calm in the past, but there was something about this time that has Tony doubting his abilities.
“You’re a terrible liar, Steve.” Bucky shakes his head. His eyes roam over his friend and a frown appears over his face. “You also look like crap.”
Tony eyes shoot open at those words. That can’t be right. He wasn’t expecting them back until late tomorrow. He throws the blankets off and rolls over onto his back.
“There’s your baby.” Bruce points to what Peter can only describe as a blob. It has no real shape; it doesn’t resemble a baby at all.
“Hmm.” Steve frowns and pulls back slightly. “And if that doesn’t work. Hot chocolate definitely will.”
Tony shakes his head and moves closer until he can take Steve’s hands in his own. “Sweetheart, you are not disgusting. You are one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen.”
He promised Peter a suit when he got back, and he never broke a single promise to his son. He doesn’t know what Peter had in mind, but he hopes his son appreciates the thought.
Peter holds out his pinkie. Tony eyes it for a moment, and with a roll of his eyes, wraps his own pinkie around the one offered to him.
“It’s okay if you did. I guess in a way you were right. I can’t handle our daughter sometimes. I thought having a baby would be this...incredible experience. And believe me I love that little girl more than anything in this world, but this...Tony, it’s this part I can’t handle. I don’t understand why I feel or say the things that I do. But I’m trying to get better.”
Steve thanks JARVIS on his way out. He takes each step down the stairs carefully, craning his neck in hopes of catching a glimpse of the alpha. He finds him lounging on the sofa, head down and obviously distracted with the same device he had seen the omega woman with earlier. He reaches the bottom of the stairs and cautiously shuffles closer, wringing his hands together nervously.
Tony focuses on that one spot, applying just the right amount of pressure until Steve’s cock is responding to his touch. It’s not long before he’s hard again and leaking precome at the tip.
Peter doesn’t want to talk. He wants to run away and never see them again. They hated him. They were disappointed and would never look at him the same. He couldn’t stay here.
Tony returns a few minutes later with a bottled coke and a glass filled to the brim with green liquid. Peter can’t help but grimace at the sludge.
Peter glances away from the window to stare at him, brows furrowed for a moment before he remembers. “Oh! Yeah...um...I can kinda...swing.”
He loved their son and some of the perks that came with being pregnant, but he had a lot of issues with it. Mostly his inability to keep up with the new changes to his body. It was a struggle and he couldn’t help but grow excited at the thought of finally being done.
“Yeah...just tired. Haven’t slept well in a week.” It’s a response Tony has heard before, and he doesn’t question it. He’s been affected by Morgan’s presence, but nowhere near as close as Steve. He didn’t have to carry her for months and then suffer with the birth; Steve did all of those things, so the guy deserved to complain a little.
The two alpha’s had been reprimanded, and though it was nice to see them get punished for a change, Steve knew that once he had given birth, they would seek him out for revenge.
By the time dinner is ready, the rest of the family shows up. Steve isn’t thrilled with their tardiness and he orders them to clean up before calling them to eat.
Tony doesn’t say anything else. He honestly doesn’t know what he’s supposed to say to cheer his husband up.
Bucky inhales sharply and has to fight the urge to punch the wall. Alpine comes near him again and he scoops her up, cradling her close until she’s purring.
Steve is about ready to protest, just like Tony knew he would, but before the words can leave Steve’s mouth, Tony takes his hands and brings him closer. Steve yelps in surprise when Tony pulls him into his lap.
Steve loves how good of a father Tony is. Morgan was the luckiest girl in the world to have someone like him in her life. Steve would say the same. Tony was his rock, the one person who could turn his whole day around by just smiling.
Pepper comes closer and Steve can’t help but flinch when she lays a hand over his shoulder. He had expected Tony to come rushing after him but it was nice having another omega around.
Tony removes his fingers, giving the omega a break to calm down and catch his breath. Steve is panting harshly, his body covered in a sheen of sweat and his own slick. His cock is still hard and leaking.
Being back in his own apartment slightly alters his mood. He’s able to focus on something else other than Tony. The pain is what takes all of his attention. It’s stronger and more intense than what it had been. It’s concerning and that voice inside his head tells him to take Sam’s advice and go to medical. But he’s stubborn and sure the serum will take care of whatever it is that’s bothering him.
Steve hums into the kiss. “Why do you?” he retorts, breaking the kiss for a second before connecting their lips again.
Steve curses quietly to himself and hangs his head between his shoulders, eyes burning with the tears that threaten to fall. He grips the edge of the countertop to steady himself when he sways. He glances toward his right, settling his eyes on the plastic stick he had just peed on.
When Flash doesn’t respond right away, Peter fears the worst and waits for Flash to turn away and leave. But then he surprises Peter by gripping him tightly by the arm and dragging him toward an empty hallway.
Poor Steve is still struggling, but it’s going to take time for him to heal. At least he has Tony and their pups to help him.
Bruce moves on to look over the youngest pup, quietly shushing Peter when he begins to fuss. “Shh, I know, little guy. This isn’t fun.”
Happy nods and opens the door for Peter. When they’re both inside the vehicle and making their way through the busy streets, Happy asks, “I’m assuming it’s either laundry day or your mini me is growing.”
Tony inhales sharply and sends his friend a quick look before turning back to his mate. “And what about you? Do you really enjoy sneaking out to your meetings?”
“Hey.” Peter notices her when she runs into the living room. He has Harley calm and watching cartoons, giving him an opportunity to take her hand and stop her from going up the stairs. “Morgan, what’s wrong?”
“You’re safe,” Steve whispers and hugs his son close, doing what he had with the other pups and kissing the top of James’ head. The pup responds with a soft purr, the sound bringing tears to Steve’s eyes.
“I don’t care if we’re not together like that anymore. I’m still going to help you and our son. I promise.”
“Yeah,” Steve agrees. A name was something that had slipped his mind. “I guess Baby Stark doesn’t work.”
He quietly enters his uncles’ apartment, expecting the yelling and interrogating to start, but when he steps inside and hears laughter, he grows both confused and relieved.
Steve nods and bites down on his bottom lip as he contemplates his next move. He leans closer and kisses Tony again, and then again and again until the kiss grows heated.
Tony doesn’t want to get his hopes up, especially when it was too soon to say for sure, but he was positive Steve was feeling like himself again. He wonders if their night out had anything to do with it. Steve had been different that night; he smiled and laughed, something Tony hadn’t seen him do in a long time.
Steve frowns as he thinks it over. Tony had been the only alpha to ask. “Do you want me to present?”
Peter leaves out the fact that he hasn’t seen his dad in a few days. He also leaves out the part about skipping school and rushing to Stark Industries, hoping to bump into his dad again. It was pathetic but how else was he supposed to keep in contact? It wasn’t like they swapped numbers.
Steve sighs and takes Tony’s hand again. “I was so scared. When Nat told me-Tony, I didn’t know what to do. I thought you were…”
Steve winces again and places a hand over his belly. “Maybe I pushed myself a little too hard today.”
“I don’t think he really knows me,” Tony says. He tries to say it in a joking manner, but it’s obvious from the look Steve is giving him that he failed. “I wasn’t exactly around, Cap.”
The wall he’s landing on isn’t going to hold him for long and he crawls as fast as he can, relief washing over him when he spots the exit. Another boom shakes the deteriorating structure, the fear of getting caught in the rubble motivating Peter to move hurriedly.
Peter can barely bring himself to look at his uncles. It’s been a little over a week since the party and the huge blow up that resulted in violence and mean words being shared. Apologies for that night have yet to be given, at least not really. Bucky and Peter weren’t on speaking terms at the moment.
He doesn’t allow the results to break him down. It didn’t matter. He still had a baby growing inside Tony’s belly, and that was more than enough. It was perfect.
“The serum.” The words slip out of his mouth before he can even stop them. Bruce's head snaps up, showing off the deep wrinkles beginning to form over his brow.
Peter forces himself to glance up at the poster, and that’s when he makes his decision. He jumps up from his seat and rushes toward the exit, muttering a ‘sorry’ on his way out.
Movement on his left has Steve turning away from her and setting his fiery gaze on the beta. Steve sniffs the air, his nose wrinkling. The scent was off. There was a hint of sweetness lingering in the air.
Tony sighs, unsure if he should believe his son. He ignores his nerves and allows Peter to lead him toward the party, happy that they were together again.
He turns to Bruce for help, only getting a small shrug in response. It doesn’t make him feel better. One glance at his other uncles shows stern expressions and a good chance he’s getting reprimanded for something.
“Damn you, Steve,” Tony curses, his anger building. It wasn’t as if any of this was Steve’s fault. It wasn’t like Steve knew he was going to die so unexpectedly. But damn did it hurt. It hurt badly. “Fuck,” Tony grumbles and angrily wipes at the tears that roll down his face.
“I figured out what to do,” Peter gets to the point, feeling confident now that he’s safe and secure in his bedroom and not the school cafeteria.
Peter whimpers from the other side of the bed, waking from his slumber and fussing in his bassinet. Tony goes to get him, quietly shushing him and speaking to the little pup as he comforts him. It brings a smile to Steve’s face.
The grin on Steve’s face is gone in an instant, a frown taking its place. “Fleabag? Tony, he has a name. And I know you won’t sleep on the couch.”
Tony huffs and begins reading through the various emails he received during the weekend. He’s wishing he responded to them before.
I took a day off...sort of. I helped my son with school and then rested when I could. I had some of this chapter complete and then forced myself to finish it and now here it is!
He didn’t want that for his children. He just wanted them to live a normal, happy life. Was that too much to ask for?
“I had a great time, though,” Steve assures, a smile forming over his lips. “I wouldn’t have agreed to a second if I didn’t.”
Bruce offers a small smile and nods his head. His smile falters and he turns to Tony, leaning in and saying something only meant for the alpha’s ears. Steve can’t help but frown.
Steve doesn’t even flinch when Tony’s hands are on him again. He can feel when he’s close by, and can even smell him. Tony’s hands roam over his legs and spreads them open, then he’s positioning himself between them.
Pretty soon the piles of presents have vanished, leaving behind a new pile of baby products that needed to be put away. Tony can’t help the loud sigh that leaves him at the thought of carrying the items upstairs and putting them in the nursery. It would just be a job for Steve to complete.
Tony reaches his office and immediately shuts Happy out. He wants to be alone, but he knows it won’t be for long. He had received numerous missed calls and messages from Pepper within the last few days, and that's what finally got his ass back into the city and away from the quiet life he had been living.
“Nothing,” Tony lies. He knows his lie is falling through. He had been repeating the same lie for years, and each time Happy had been able to see through it. “Baby’s good. He’ll be here soon, though.”
They needed to talk. They need to sit down and be honest with each other, lay everything out instead of keeping it bottled in. That was the root of the problem. It would be easy to blame Steve’s depression or the stress brought on from having a new baby, but the reality of it all was the lack of communication between them. Talking had never been one of their strong suits. It took awhile for them to get where they were now, and Tony wasn’t about to let them take any steps back.
“I’ll spoil her.” Natasha enters the room and makes her way toward the kitchen to serve herself a plate.
Peter’s scared about what lies ahead, but at the same time he can’t help but feel giddy. This was his first mission, his chance to be a hero and fight alongside his family. He’d been waiting for this moment for as long as he could remember.
When Tony fails to respond in a timely manner, Steve throws the bag over his shoulder and leaves the room. Tony rushes after him.
Just like Peter promised, he leads Ned up to his room and shouts to his parents that they’ll be doing homework before shutting the door. Ned sits down on the bed and anxiously waits for Peter to tell him what was so important that it had to wait for right now.
“Yeah. Peter.” Tony tests out the name, liking it the more he thinks it over. “It is nice. So Tony Junior is out then?”
Tony doesn’t hear from his son or his best friend. He was sure after a few days that at least one of them would have called him back. He could have easily reached out to them first, and for one person he did, but still there had been no response. Maybe this was karma’s way of getting him back. He did blow Steve off after multiple phone calls, texts, voicemails, and letters were sent. Maybe Tony was getting punished now.
The alpha laughs. “You don’t deserve anything. Be grateful with what I have given you. You’re lucky to be alive, Omega. I could’ve left you in that ice.”
“Steve, it’s okay to be nervous,” Pepper says, “I can’t imagine how difficult this is for you. That’s why Tony and I working hard to come up with a story-”
Tony curses loudly and takes a step back to calm himself before he loses his cool. Steve takes this opportunity to intervene and calm their distressed son.
“My mother was a nurse,” Steve starts. “And my father was a soldier. He died before I was born, leaving my mother to care for me on her own. She did her best given our circumstances. I didn’t make it easy and sometimes I wondered if her life would be easier if I had…” Steve frowns and brings his glass up to his lips, hoping the cool water would drown the lump that’s formed in his throat.
“It’s hurting me too. I get it. I get not knowing what to do. But don’t end up like me. I didn’t cope well when I lost my parents. I did stupid shit, remember? You just have to find a way to move past this.”
“As long as you don’t announce it to the world, I think a small get together would be good for you and Steve. He seems...relaxed.”
“I know,” Tony takes both of Steve’s hands and gives them a reassuring squeeze. “I know I’m probably disregarding those baby steps but I want you here. With you and Pete I feel...it feels like we’re a family.”
Tony keeps his hand on him, letting him know he’s still there. He trails his hand down the omega’s chest, getting lower and lower to where he really wants to touch.
Bucky gets up from the table, abandoning breakfast and disappearing down the hall. The bedroom door slams shut.
“Yeah yeah.” Tony waves his hand dismissively. Another question enters his mind, but he’s unsure if he should ask it. Talking about Steve was too sensitive for the both of them.
“Yeah. I’ve been putting off a lot because of-” Tony waves a hand at Steve’s belly. “-and I know once he’s born I’ll put off more. God. I don’t even know how I’m supposed to run this place and be a father. I should just quit.”
Bucky rolls his eyes and steps away to allow Sam to enter their apartment. It wasn’t the first time he’s greeted Sam this way. Sam’s had Bucky’s phone pressed into his face more times than he can count. Usually it was when Bucky didn’t understand something about his phone or when he wanted to show Sam whatever he’s come across on the internet. Luckily for Sam it’s nothing weird this time and just a simple text from his nephew.
He didn’t want to admit it, but now he was finally starting to understand what Tony had been talking about. He loved Dodger, but the constant following was starting to get under his skin. Steve blames his pregnancy. As of late, it’s been the reason for many things, his mood swings being one of them.
“Mr. Stark? Are you alright?” Alexander is out of his own seat, coming closer and laying a hand on Tony’s shoulder.
Hi! I hope you all are having a good weekend and staying safe. I'm sad I have to work tomorrow, and I wanted to get a few things updated before the workweek starts back up again. I know I had originally put that this story would end after two chapters, but there was a few requests for more and I just couldn't say no. I don't know how long this story is going to be, so we'll just see I guess. There is a birth scene in this one, so just a heads up. Anyway here is the next chapter!
Bucky sniffs and places out a hand to touch the casket. “I’m gonna miss you, pal. Till the end of the line.”
He wishes he could stay longer and hold Steve, but it was time to go. Steve gives Morgan another kiss, then Tony is taking her into his arms.
Morgan’s cries die down and her dark eyes open, revealing the tears in them. Their eyes meet and Tony smiles down at her. He offers the bottle again and this time she takes it without a fuss.
“How is this fun? I had to pee in a cup, get poked with needles, answer thousands of questions, and now I’m in a dark room with a weird bed. I want to go home.”
“Jarvis helped me. I don’t know. I guess what I’m saying is you need to face the pain. It’s going to hurt but it does get better.”
His daughter pulls away from his chest, emitting another whimper. Steve tries to comfort her, only for his attempts to fail and her whimpers rise in volume. Her cries send him into a panic. They’ll hear her.
“See? Steve, I know you’re a little different now-” Tony takes Steve’s hands again when Steve tries to use them to hide himself. “-but I don’t care. I think you’re beautiful no matter what.”
“I’m sorry, Tony,” The doctor apologizes. “I need to check your dilation. Can you roll over for me?”
After the session ends and the last member has left, Steve lingers behind and helps Sam clean up and rearrange the room.
“Yeah.” Tony smiles and reaches out to touch his son. He lays a hand over Peter’s head, chuckling to himself at the amount of hair his son has. “He is going to take after me. Sorry.”
“Y-yeah,” Peter stammers and fiddles with his fingers. “Papa thinks it was the serum. I don’t know. One minute I was normal and the next he found me crawling on the ceiling.”
“But…” Steve pauses and worries his bottom lip with his teeth. Tears spill from his eyes again. “I’m sorry. I turned your whole world upside down.”
“Hey, Flash. I’m-” Peter cuts himself off when he sighs. He takes a breath before trying again. “Flash, I’m pregnant-fuck, no that’s-Flash, I know we hate each other and...that night at the party we promised we wouldn’t-but it happened and now I’m-”
“That could work,” Bucky decides to add and he joins them at the table with a cup of coffee for himself and a glass of orange juice for Steve. Steve mutters a ‘thanks’ and accepts the beverage. “And if the letter doesn’t work then fuck him. You have us.”
, that voice likes to taunt. And it’s right. Tony does deserve to be left alone. He lost everything.
“M-more. Tony, please.” Steve begs, purposely clenching down on the alpha’s finger. Tony complies and increases the pace, then he’s adding another finger and thrusting them harshly. Steve’s breathing picks up, the heavy pants growing harsher when Tony’s finger gets close to that spot inside of him.
It’s not until it’s time for cake does he excuse himself from a conversation with Pepper to get the dessert he’s prepared. He makes his way to the kitchen, his ears immediately picking up on the familiar voices of Tony and Bruce. Steve is ready to ask them for help until he picks up bits of their conversation.
The opportunity to talk to Steve doesn’t present itself. Natasha is coming over with a screaming Morgan in her arms. Tony is ready to take his daughter back and calm her down, but at the sounds of her cries, Steve is already out of his seat and rushing to get her.
They’re all gathered around the large living space. Peter and Sam are on the floor sorting through the countless dvds while Bucky, Natasha, and Bruce gather on the sofa and sort through photos and other miscellaneous items Steve has collected over the years.
“Wait...are you saying you’re fine with him?” Peter asks to make sure he was in fact hearing his uncle’s words correctly.
Just like Jarvis had said, Steve is still in the living room, sitting on the couch with his face buried in his hands. The small sniffs and sobs are heartbreaking to hear. All Tony’s ever seen is this side of Steve. He’s only witnessed the broken side. He wonders if Steve even has a good side.
But that all changed when Steve woke up in a new time period. The holiday was still the same, though maybe now it was worse, but what made it better was Tony.
The man is on him in seconds, issuing punch after punch to Steve’s face. The punches keep coming, filling Steve’s battered mouth with blood. Steve is able to shove him off, giving himself a break from the beatings, but then the man is back, lunging after him.
“Okay. Relax.” Tony pats the bodyguard gently on the shoulder. “I’ll check on him,” he says and reaches for the handle on the side of the door.
”I’d be careful with him hanging around the building by himself,” Happy says, “you don’t want people getting the wrong idea.”
“I don’t care,” Tony says and he lays a hand over Steve’s thigh, gently rubbing circles over the area. “Honey, this is a partnership. I don’t want you to feel like you have to do everything on your own.”
A small sob escapes him and he has to slap a hand over his mouth to hide it. Tony was just down the hall playing with their daughter, completely unaware that Steve was beating himself up again. He didn’t want Tony to see him like this either. He was supposed to be strong and happy to be a mother.
“I know. I love you, Auntie Nat, but...but I want them to listen too.” Morgan sighs. “Can I just live with you?”
His idea of something else ends up being a pair of sweatpants. It’s not cool enough for him to get away with wearing them, but it was better than going around school with his pants open.
“But this isn’t his room,” Tony says and he lays his Starkpad to the side. “Not really. We’re not going to be living here full time. Why even bother?”
“Yes you did. Maybe we never should’ve-” Steve glances down at the ring on his finger. He toys with the band before slipping it off and laying it on the counter. “Here. Maybe now you can find someone better.”
“He can,” Tony answers quickly. “He can measure the baby, detect any health issues, determine the sex-”
Tony sighs again. “It’s not what you think. Steve wanted to do something small and...yeah. Wait, are you calling to let me know you’re not coming or…”
But it was only Pepper and Happy who greeted him, and judging by the broken looks on their faces, they had already heard the news.
She’s hesitant to approach him, but when he looks up at her with pain filled eyes, she sighs sadly and moves toward him, carefully avoiding the glass as she sits beside him.
This chapter wasn't supposed to exist, but I wanted to add some more cute Steve and Peter moments so I wrote this quickly and here it is! I'll update again tomorrow since that chapter is already finished.
Morgan’s cries have gotten louder, more urgent. Tony’s not sure if it’s because she can sense that she’s so close to getting her fill, or she’s picking up on Steve’s irritation. Maybe it’s both.
The invitation that he received had gone in the trash, but his assistant, Pepper, informed him that his presence was expected at the event. Tony had scoffed and rolled his eyes. He knew why he was their guest of honor. They just wanted his money.
Tony internally screams at himself. He sucked at comforting others. He never knew how to say the right things.
“Your brain. All I knew about you was how intelligent you are. They thought if they combined your intelligence and my strength, then they could create their next leader,” Steve says. He glances down at his belly and rubs the spot tenderly. “I don’t know if this is the one, but they want this baby. And I can’t let them take another.”
“I wanted to. And-”Steve pauses and slips free from around Tony to get to the island. He picks up the gift. “-this is for you. I...I hope you like it.”
Peter chokes back a sob and this time Tony pulls him into a hug. Peter clings to him tightly and sobs, not caring if he’s staining the expensive shirt his dad has on.
Harley is back to pouting and he pulls away, shaking his head and crossing his arms. “No. I don’t wanna.”
“I didn’t mean it like that. He just…he’s tired.” Tony frowns at his own words. Here he was using the same excuse Steve loved to use on him. “I mean...come on, he can’t be. Right?”
“So far everything looks good. I’ll print some pictures for you when I’m done, then you should be good to go.”
A group of men come through the corridor and into the room, speaking in a language Peter immediately recognizes. His uncle and aunt would speak it sometimes.
All of his time and energy went to his husband, nephew and friends. He’s beginning to wonder if this was how Steve felt. Steve was always setting aside his own feelings and time to care for everyone else. Especially his son. Peter was his whole world.
Tony drags Bruce away from the door and down the empty hallway until he’s positive they’re out of earshot.
Peter blows out a deep breath and pushes forward, determined to find Flash and get it over with. It was like ripping off a bandaid. Or at least that’s what Peter wishes for it to be like. Ripping a bandaid off would probably be easier and less humiliating.
Dodger’s attention is grabbed the second Tony comes through with Peter in tow. Much to Tony’s relief, Dodger doesn’t jump or bark.
It’s an adjustment when they bring him to the compound for the first time, but it’s also relieving. Peter was stronger now and showing no signs of any complications. He was absolutely perfect.
It strikes fear in him. They must know who he is and what he can do. Hydra had wanted to use him and perhaps SHIELD had similar agendas.
Tony is happy again once he has his favorite snack and a promise that he’ll be getting the drugs soon. He could usually do pain and suffering. He’s been through those two things most of his life, but it didn’t compare to the bitch that was labor.
A heavy silence fills the room. Steve’s breathing appears too loud. His heart is still racing, pounding roughly against his ribcage that it almost hurts. He strains his ears, relying on his enhanced hearing to pick up on the sound he should be perceiving. The room remains silent.
Thank you guys so much for sticking this one out with me! I’m happy to have finally finished it. I love my readers! You guys are awesome! Now off to write some more! ❤️
“I’m gonna be honest with you. I do feel guilty, but that’s not the reason behind my generosity. I’m not an asshole.”
For once Steve isn’t awoken by a dreadful nightmare. The slight pressure on his chest isn’t because of the alpha that used to keep him pinned down. The scent that fills Steve’s nose is pleasant, reminding him of home, safety, and love.
Bucky nods and casts his gaze down to hide the tears in his eyes. Sam notices and reaches for Bucky’s hand, pulling him close until he can wrap both arms around him.
“Sweetie, it’s okay.” Natasha pulls him into a hug. He doesn’t fight her touch and allows her to hold him close. “I miss him too. A lot.”
Steve is taken aback by the politeness. He can’t remember a time when he was spoken to like this...like...like a human being. His mother made sure to raise him to be kind and speak politely to others. For the most part he did. It wasn’t until he was locked away did he forget the manners his mother taught him. In his mind Hydra didn’t deserve them. Maybe he would have received less bruises if he had listened.
Steve chuckles and leans back in his chair, watching as Tony bonds with their son. He wondered how it was supposed to work now that his relationship with Tony was over. He didn’t know if Tony would stick around and help, but the past couple of days, Tony had proved that he was going to do more than help with their son. He was going to love him unconditionally, and be the best father he could possibly be.
“What are you doing?” Steve asks and places a soft kiss to the back of Tony’s neck. “Come upstairs.”
“Where are we?” Steve asks, his eyes roaming over the body of water and trees. It was beautiful and peaceful, nothing at all like the noisy city they left behind. The sun has started to set, painting the sky in rich pinks and purples. It was hard to get a view of the sun setting with skyscrapers, but out here, Steve was able to see it all.
Sam places a hand over Bucky’s shoulder to calm him, but his efforts fail and Bucky is shrugging him off. Bucky stands and turns to leave, only to spin around and point a finger at Tony.
Tony brings the car seat over to the sofa so that Dodger can meet the newest family member. Peter is stirred from his sleep when Dodger comes over to sniff him.
Not a word is said until Tony is pulling into his private garage and shutting off the ignition. He takes off his sunglasses, revealing his glistening eyes. He glances at his son.
As soon as Ned is walking the opposite direction and blending in with the crowd, Peter rushes toward the nearest bathroom and locks himself in the last stall. He shrugs his backpack off, not caring if it falls onto the dirty floor beneath his feet.
“Hurry, Daddy!” Peter gently pushes Tony toward the stairs. “We need to go show everyone our costumes!”
Peter nods and his eyes drift toward the doorway, finding his uncle leaning against the frame with his arms crossed and lips pursed in a tight line. He didn’t seem too happy, but Peter didn’t understand or care why. All that mattered was that his papa was home early.
“Relax, baby. It’s just me.” Tony gently pressing his finger against the tight muscle, watching as Steve’s body relaxes just enough to take him in and swallow the tip of his finger. “Good. Just like that. Feel good?”
I just want to say thank you for all the lovely comments, kudos and for reading this story. It means so much!
The two pups rush to Tony’s side to give him the same greeting. Tony lifts Harley into his arms, only to wince in pain and hand him to Steve. His sore back was going to be an issue for a little longer.
It was a stupid plan, Peter knew this, but he couldn’t risk his papa going out on a mission alone. He’s seen his father do this so many times, and each time there has never even been a hint of fear on his father’s face. But Peter had seen something different this time.
Tears gather in his eyes and he blinks to keep them from falling. Tony rises to his feet abruptly and makes his way to the bar, rummaging through the bottles he has until he finds one with the highest proof.
Peter nods. “My papa would take care of everyone but sometimes I took care of him. I helped the team when I could. I couldn’t fight the bad guys with them but at least I could help patch them back up.”
“You okay?” Tony asks, his voice capturing Steve’s attention and he peers up at him, forcing a smile to hide his hurt.
Dodger cocks his head to the side when Peter emits a tiny whimper. Steve is quick to swoop in and take Peter from the car seat and into his arms. He lowers himself onto the couch and works on getting Peter calm.
The door to the apartment is opening and in walks Tony, large shopping bags in both hands and a smile on his face. He’s dressed in dark jeans and a black t-shirt with a skeleton on the front. He reminds Steve of a kid...a really big kid. But that was exactly what Tony was.
Yay I finally got around to updating this one. I’m off today so probably that’s why. I started the next chapter at work so maybe I’ll have that up this weekend 🤞
“Do you want to come over again?” Peter asks and Flash nods. “Fine. My parents shouldn’t be home. Just meet me outside after school okay?”
“Mr. Stark...you’re my...other parent.” Peter finally finds the courage to get the words out. He feels like a heavy weight has just been lifted off his shoulders. He’s not sure what he’s expecting, maybe a hug or something. But instead, his dad only frowns at him.
Tony opens the door and gestures for Peter to enter first, then he shuts the door behind them. Peter makes himself comfortable in one of the chairs in front of the desk, and his dad takes his own seat.
“It just takes practice,” Steve agrees and copies Tony, groaning slightly from being on the floor. “I’m getting too old for this.”
Steve misses Brooklyn. He misses the old, worn down apartment, because even though it didn’t have much to offer, it was still his home. It was the only place he had ever known. He can still smell his mother cooking dinner in the tiny kitchen, hearing her humming a tune from her homeland. He remembers her smile, the way it would light up every room she entered. God Steve missed her.
Tony sticks his tongue out and places the bags on the kitchen island. “Oh hey! What did you think of Michael? Cool, right?”
Steve studies himself in the mirror and tries not to frown at the reflection staring back at him. The bruises have begun to fade and the cuts along his face appear to be healing nicely. The physical damage might be gone but the mental and emotional abuse was still there.
He’s just finished getting off the phone with a doctor. He feels hopeful now that he’s taken the first step in getting help for his husband, but he’s quickly reminded that they had a long road ahead of them. Steve wasn’t going to bounce back overnight.
Steve nods his head, then he’s leaving the room. Tony lets out a sigh and directs his attention back to his daughter. She is still sleeping peacefully in his arms, and for a moment Tony wonders if she will behave for him.
Peter can’t stop staring at the image Doctor Banner had printed out for him. He has an envelope full of them tucked away in his desk drawer, but he’s made sure to keep one with him. He studies it closely, finding it hard to believe that he had life growing inside of him. The pregnancy test had confirmed it, but seeing the baby for the first time made everything more real.
“Of course. Steve and I are good. Really good actually. I’ve thought about-” Tony stops himself. The idea of marriage has crossed his mind more times than he’d care to admit. For as long as he could remember, marriage was something he decided wasn’t for him. He hadn’t met the one and decided he was better off alone. It was safer that way. But then he met Steve and they had a son. Now marriage didn’t seem so bad.
“I know what you’re thinking.” Pepper’s voice is back in his ears and Steve peers up at her, not realizing that he had glanced down again. “Tony loves you. I can see it; everyone can.”
“At least Happy was there,” Tony points at the screen when his bodyguard appears in the video. Happy takes Tony inside and the SUV drives away. Tony huffs and scratches at his chin. “Guess I should’ve had him with me huh?” He says more so to himself.
Everyone turns around at the familiar voice. Peter immediately sets Steve down when the toddler wiggles to get free.
“You’re a good dad, Tony.” Steve smiles and threads his fingers through the alpha’s hair. Tony pulls back slightly, a look of uncertainty crossing his features. “You are. Peter’s lucky. And so am I.”
Sergeant Barnes was currently back in DC under SHIELD's care. He had been abused for years under Hydra's control. Tony wasn’t sure what he thought about him, especially once he learned the truth about his parents and the affiliation Barnes had with them. It wasn’t until he learned of the brainwashing did he ease off. It wasn’t like Barnes could help what he did, but Tony was still wary.
Peter glances around, relieved to find that no one has given him any attention. He gestures for Ned to follow and together they make their way through the front doors and toward the closest restroom.
“Just admit it, Tony. Just admit that you’re afraid of me. You don’t trust me around her and I get that. I don’t trust myself either. It’s better if I go.” Steve turns back around and grabs the bag.
“You didn’t tell me enough. Tony, who is he? I didn’t even know you were romantically involved and having a pup.”
And it’s time to get a rescue mission set up! I’m bringing in new characters. Hope no one forgot about Natalie 😉.
A soft whimper cuts through the silence, forcing Tony to lift his head and set his eyes on the trembling figure a few feet away from him. He struggles with the chains, desperate to be near him and comfort him like he was supposed to. The chains around him jingle with each attempt he makes to break loose, but it’s hopeless.
Steve frees himself from the duvet, the simple action causing the little pup to smile. It meant mama was up and ready to play. Peter giggles and rushes toward the doorway, eagerly waiting for Steve to catch up to him.
This chapter actually inspired me to write a little one-shot that I will be posting soon, but that's random. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! I will update soon!
“The pictures? Yeah.” Peter smiles and places the picture back beside the others. “He’d add mine with them...it made me feel like a fan. He always told me I was his biggest fan and that he was mine.”
“I guess. Gonna be hard now that I don’t have you two. Hey, maybe next week or whenever you’re up to it, he can stay with me? I know we haven’t discussed a schedule yet, but I’m all for taking him for a week.”
Hello! I hope everyone is doing well! I miss all of you. I’m still trying to find a routine and struggling a bit. But I’m determined to get there!
“You did a lot more than that.” Tony rises to his feet and moves toward his friend. He lays a hand over his shoulder. “I owe you big time for keeping them safe.”
His water hadn’t broken yet, which he was grateful for, but at the rate the contractions were coming, he wouldn’t be surprised if it broke soon.
Peter had stopped crying, completely content on Steve’s chest, finding comfort in the soft beating of the heart he'd heard the moment he was given the ability to hear.
“Steve,” Tony moans softly, rubbing himself a little harder. He’s losing control. Steve did something to him that no other omega has ever done before. Steve was intoxicating, stronger than any alcohol Tony has ever consumed.
“Hmm? What’s wrong?” Tony mumbles. His eyes remain closed and Morgan knows he’ll fall back to sleep soon.
“Buck-” Steve tries to protest, but Bucky is already rising to his feet and opening his arms. With a sigh of defeat, Steve places Peter in Bucky’s arms. “Careful with his head.”
His papa returns a few minutes later with jeans that obviously belong to his dad. Peter grimaces and accepts them despite how much he’d rather reject the item and crawl back into bed.
The omega keens from the praise. Tony knows how much they love being praised during mating. He moves his hips a little harder, punching out gasps and moans from the blond.
“Hang on...did we meet at-there was a party I was invited to a few weeks back. Was it there?” Tony questions.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees with a nod of his head. He rises to his feet and crosses the room to get more paper towels. He hands them to Tony. “The baby looks good. I’m happy.”
“Shh.” Tony shushes him with a kiss. They break apart. “You deserve it. You went out of your way to do something nice for me...of course I fucked it up but…”
His shoes echo loudly once he steps through the front door and into one of the biggest living rooms he’s ever seen. He can vividly remember the small one he walked into every time he stepped through the door of his one bedroom apartment, but this place was unlike anything Steve’s ever imagined. He came from rags while it was evident Tony was from riches.
Tony rises to his feet and lifts Steve up to his own. “Can you walk?” Tony asks when Steve stumbles forward.
“I got her,” Steve says quickly and rushes to take the pup into his arms. Sarah whimpers and wraps her arms around Steve’s neck, sniffing around until she finds his scent gland and buries her nose into it. “What’s wrong, sweetheart?”
“You two met recently. After you and I spoke about making a contribution to my organization, you bumped into him. You two only spoke for a few minutes, but he seemed to take a liking to you.”
“Okay.” Natasha nods and places a kiss to his head. “Be safe. Come home straight after school. I don’t want to ground you.”
The room reminds Tony of a room you’d find at a luxury hotel. It’s walls are painted white and the floors are light colored hardwood. The queen size bed is neatly made with fresh white sheets and a matching duvet. There’s a small bathroom adjacent to the bed. A flat screen TV is mounted on the wall and a light gray sofa and matching armchair sit around it, resembling a small living room. On the opposite side of the room are white double doors that lead out into a small patio, perfect for when Steve wanted to enjoy a quiet night.
Steve ignores the warning, baring his own teeth and moving toward the alpha. Rumlow keeps the gun aimed, but Steve knows he won’t pull the trigger. The alpha tries to keep his composure but despite his efforts, Steve can both see and smell his fear.
“Honey, you feeling okay?” It’s a stupid question to ask. Of course Steve wasn’t okay. He just lost a baby.
But now as they’re in the sanitized room at the OB’s office, that clump of cells resembles a tiny person.
Steve brings the sweatshirt up to his nose, inhaling the familiar scent. He keens at the smell and sniffs again. The fabric is soft against his skin, and he can only imagine what it would feel like to wear. A thought crosses his mind.
“They’re good,” Steve can’t help but smile at the thought of his pups. “They’ve actually discovered a new show.”
It’s not until they’re halfway into the movie does Steve emit a soft gasp. Peter is too engrossed in the cartoon to acknowledge the sound, but Tony hears it and sends his husband a worried look. Steve is still focusing on the movie, unaware of the fact that Tony is watching him closely. Steve’s face twists in discomfort and he wraps an arm around his belly.
“I know. Me too. But it happened and all we can do is support him. Yelling at him like that wasn’t okay.”
Well they’ve made up and I swear Tony is done doing stupid things. Unless you count going back to New York? 🤔 You know what, forget what I said 😆 And! Peter will be here soon!
“Not like that. I’m still hesitant about that. I was thinking I take her around the compound, maybe spend some time outside. We both could use the fresh air.”
“But Steve is different. I’m not saying he’d hurt her,” Bruce quickly says when Tony frowns. “You and I both know Steve isn’t capable of hurting anyone he loves. But I do think he needs to see someone.”
Tony’s phone rings after the signing and he immediately answers. He doesn’t miss the way Natalie watches him.
Alpha returns with his drink. He eyes the barely touched food and shakes his head with disapproval. “I offer you a night in my private quarters and you can’t even appreciate my generosity. I’ve considered having you stay here full time-”
Steve doesn’t stop, and he continues to kiss and lick along the mark. He traces the dents his teeth created with his tongue. Tony groans, his eyes fluttering shut from the jolts of pleasure that shoots through him.
“But you’re not! How many times have you-” Tony stops himself before he can make the situation worse. But it’s too late. The damage is already done. Steve knows what he’s referring to. “I didn’t mean-Steve, it’s not like that. I didn’t-”
He’s snapped from his thoughts when Morgan whimpers in his arms. One glance down shows her tiny features contorting into distress. Tony hopes she’s not hungry again. The last thing he wants to do is go back upstairs and wake his husband.
Bucky snaps his head up at those words, the color from his face draining and eyes going wide. “What?”
“I don’t. He’s been kicking me all ni-” Steve cuts off with a groan when Peter finally wakes up and stretches. Natasha is the only one delighted to feel the movement.
Peter’s not surprised when his papa picks up after the first ring, nor when he promises to be there in fifteen minutes or less. His papa had always been this way. Ever since Peter was a little kid, his papa smothered him with love and affection. The attention was nice and Peter enjoyed the warmth and comfort his father brought, but now that he was older, he needed space. He wasn’t a baby anymore.
It’s those thoughts that keep him distracted. His email is open and there are a few that need to be replied to urgently, but he can’t bring himself to type out replies. He’s tempted to have Pepper do it, but she was already doing so much. The least he could do was carry some of the weight. It was his company after all.
Steve adds more lube to his cock and leads it to Tony’s prepared entrance. The head pushes through until it’s breaching Tony's hole. Steve groans from the feeling of having Tony wrapped around him, snug and warm. He wouldn’t have minded being the one fucked, but with Tony’s condition, this was how it was going to be for awhile.
“Because you’re my friend and I missed you. Plus, we’re still gonna need you. I can’t deliver this kid and-”
Sam had been recruited to help with their latest mission after Steve met him working as a SHIELD agent. Taking down Hydra wasn’t a simple task and Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t thankful for the extra person on their side. The reward had its gains, stopping a Nazi cult was one of them, but for Steve, the biggest gain was getting his best friend back.
“Bucky!” Steve cries, transferring most of his weight onto his best friend. Bucky holds him up, just like he used to do when they were kids. Some things never change.
He’s been instructed to push and though he fights to hold off just until he knows where Steve was and if his husband was okay, he can’t hold back for long and his body goes against him, bearing down on its own.
Tony double checks on the pups, and once he finds them fast asleep, he shuts their door and heads toward the master bedroom. Steve is sitting on the edge of the bed, fiddling nervously with his fingers and gnawing away on his bottom lip.
“Huh? Funny… He only wrote here the experiment name as just Peter… Wait! Fuck! He was experiment on his kid? That’s just sick!” Tony said as he snapped the paper shut, looking all pale and horrified. Just then the video recorder stopped and was placed with a new record; this one had a video of Mr. Parker sitting in his small office in the lab as he began talking.
When he got there, Nick Fury, himself and a few SHIELD agents were there. He and Nick were talking about something important before they headed off, drove in one of the SHIELD expensive cars to the Avengers tower.
Clint snapped. “No! I remember what it looks like. It’s just that don’t laugh or freak out?” He asked as they blinked at him. “No…why would we?” Steve asked as Clint sighed before saying it out loud. “His bag was full of Captain American and Iron Man logo stickers and a pin that had ‘I heart Science’ written on it.” He said.
Peter was surprised to hear this. Tony was giving away the nursery room he and Steve had worked so hard for it. “No…” He said. “No?” Tony asked with a frown.
Natasha raised a brow at that. “Okay…if that is all then I think I need to go then. But are you really honestly sure that you are not in any way involved? Honesty might save your hide.” She pressed. The answer she received was a nod form the boy. “All right. My work is here is done then.” With that, she left.
He was a straight A’s student. Bruce got up and went back to the office. “I have already picked a student and I would like to interview Mr. Parker since he caught my attention. The child is quite smart and I would like to see if he is more than that. He’s the only one that stands out the most.” He said. The principal winced at the mention of Peter.
“Peter? Buddy, what’s wrong?” Tony asked ever so tenderly. Next to him, Steve blinked. He hadn’t known Tony could use a feathery tone. He didn’t even use that tone on Steve. Not even once and now with their son, Tony spoke as if he was talking to the most delicate thing in the world. Peter took a deep breath.
“I do not know, Peter. Your parents have never said a single word. However, your mother, Mary did leave a letter and her journal for you. She wanted me to give it to you when you turn fifteen but you’re old enough now to understand this thing. S-She even managed to get your father’s journals as well without his knowledge and wanted you to have it. So please Peter, whatever happens, just remember that we all love you. Your uncle Ben and I, your parents, adoptive or not.” She said with a soft yet trembling sad smile before adding.
Steve was proud of his husband (even if he thought it was too much. With all the dividing groups and performing things people such as they didn’t usually do). Sure, Steve was the leader of the Avengers and the one who inclined in giving orders to everyone around and his husband might be just his second-in-command but that didn’t mean Tony couldn’t handle or didn’t know how to be a leader to replace Steve when the time called for it. It looked like all the hard work of teaching his husband about leadership had finally paid off.
Peter grunted in pain. Green Goblin took this as his cue to escape and kicked Peter off him as he flew away.
“I’m sure Tony will be happy if you call him that, Peter. In fact he’ll be delighted. We didn’t adopt you because your one of Tony’s students, you know?” Steve said as he added. “Besides, we already see you as the child we always wanted and dreamed of.” Tony heard his husband say it with the most sincere and gentle tone.
“You little shit!” Green Goblin hissed. “I should have killed you those months ago when I got the chance!” he admitted.
“I’m happy for you, Peter. You are always so special. I will always support you on whatever you want to do in your life. But that’s not what I want to tell you.” She smiled reassuringly.
“We have the evidences. Fingerprints, blood samples and so on.” Nick said. “What’s your answer, kid? You don’t have any relatives left. Your aunt just died a few weeks ago. You only have two choices. Join the Avengers or we’ll hand you to the cop. I’m sure they will be delighted if we hand you to them. After all, they still think you’re the murderer of one Captain Stacy.”
Peter blinked his eyes before glancing at Bruce, “Is that really all right? I mean, won’t Mr. Stark be mad or anything?” He asked worriedly.
Nick Fury sat on his chair as the front door flew open. He looked up to see Captain America and Tony Stark as the two walked quietly to their presented seats and filled the empty space. He noticed the way Steve was eye-balling him to get on with the meeting. He complied and motioned Coulson to hand each file to the Avengers. Nick stood up, pressing a button on the oval table. A tri-color holograph of Spiderman swinging from the skyscraper to another skyscraper popped up on the huge screen as he began.
Tony blinked his eyes before saying. “So? What’s about it?” He inquired. “Well…it seems like this guy has more spark in him then we have hoped for.” Nick said, as Phil added. “What he means is…that we first assumed this Spiderman was one of the embryonic superheroes we have encountered in the past. However, it appears he’s not one of those. He’s real thing and that he is more than what we have expected him to be.” Phil said.
Peter visit his Aunty May only to be broken a few days later when May died due to her weak condition. But not before confronting the boy about his identity about telling the boy the whole true, that he was adopted and left a letter for Peter to read. Along side with his mother's letter and journals.
One was painted in his original red-blue and a spider symbol. The other one painted in a shiny red and yellow with a lager spider symbol on the chest, the boots were painted in yellow, then at the back of the suit were appendages spider-arms like made of metal in yellow paint. The third one was a metal spider armor suit that was painted in red and blue.
When peter was done reading the letter, he took a deep breath, exhaling it out harshly. Then he laughed and laughed and laughed. His life was complete a mess.
Like Tony, Steve too missed their stolen son from them. He fantasized of what it would feel like to teach Peter to play baseball or to teach him to ride a bike. The things a normal father would teach their son. Sometime he dreamed of reading a bedtime story to Peter, if he was still there. Steve bit the insides of his lips as silver tears fell and he turned around to face the back of the armchair.
Tony and Steve watched sadly and concerned for their son. Just then the door opened as a doctor came inside, probably to check on May, and was astounded to see them inside the room. “Oh, hello, sorry for the interruption. I didn’t know Mrs Parker has guests today. I’ll just make this quick and check if Mrs Parker is doing okay.” The doctor said, going towards May to perform the procedures.
) Clint voice could be heard through the intercom. Bruce couldn’t help but to grin silently in his head while following Peter to the gym.
Everything was back to normal. Well as normal as they could be. He was still doing his Spiderman’s duty sometimes and meeting up with his fellow Avengers.
Mathew sat on the other side. The three watched Family Guy. Well, mostly it was only Frank and Lucas watching it. Matt was blind to everything, indulging the view of his family.
“Oh him?” He said before sighing. “Sir? Is there a problem that I should be aware about this child?” Bruce tilted his head. “Ah. No. Yes Peter is a great choice. It’s just that I don’t think you might want to pick him as a student. His attitude is a little too much.”
“Yeah…I…sure. Will do that, Cap.” Tony weakly claimed. Steve gave him a smile. The man out of time looked around; making sure no one would come in here. He glimpsed down at his husband, giving Tony his genuine smile, kissing him fully on the lips.
The universe really despised them then or was just messing around with their lives. Tony moved toward the cribs and placed his hand on the rail. A sad expression marred his face. He imagined their little Peter here with them, at home in his little blue crib, awake and smiling up at his papas, cooing to greet him good morning yet he know in reality it would never happen.
Peter watched his two idols left along with Nick Fury. A frown dominated his face; the mask prevented anyone to see it. Did his idols don’t want him to join their group?
Steve gaped at the stuff Tony had bought for Peter. He glared at his husband. Clearly he wasn’t amused at Tony for pampering the child. Sure Peter was their son but it didn’t mean it was right to indulge him right away. He needed to talk to Tony about this. He didn’t want Peter to become a spoiled child.
They were awesome. Peter couldn’t help but to let out a loud squeal and hugged his dad, chanting ‘thank you’ numerous times. Tony chuckled at the boy.
Tony noticed the look on his husband’s face. “See? Now even you begin to see what I’m thinking…” Tony said.
Peter was put in the system for a while, while Tony and his husband went to get the adoption for Peter (without the boy’s awareness). They weren’t going to allow anyone to adopt their baby. When they had finally won the custody (As expected) for Peter parker, they took the boy back at to tower to where he truly belonged.
There standing in the door was a mortified Wolverine. Everyone stared at him weirdly. Logan noticed this, glaring at every single in the room, running a hand on his face before purposely marched to his seat. Though not before he threw the glariest glare he could muster at Brain.
“Now the group one would be going to the couple’s former work place to investigate there and see if you could find any lead or whatever we could find that could lead us to Peter’s real history or if his-…Mine and Steve lost kid.” Tony stopped short at the mention of the name and the reason for this mission before shaking his head. He tried not to get sentimental.
Steve looked at Peter, sighing as he threw a glance at his friend. “Bruce, can you excuse us for a while?” He requested. Bruce nodded and got up; he peeked at Peter with a weak look before leaving.
.’ Hawkeye thought. “Uh… Might I point out that I’m not a bad guy, I’m on your side?” He said. “Oh, really? Then what are you?” Spiderman asked. “I work for SHIELD. An organization who gathers people with the ability like you.” He said.
Peter who was on the ground, moaning in pain as he took out the dagger. He heard Black Window screamed for him. When everyone had finally stopped and destroyed the rest of the robots, they all went towards Spiderman.
Steve had decided to have the ‘Avengers Meeting’ with the rest of the members for their opinions about Peter Parker. Clint and Tony were keen that peter was their target. Although they still needed more proof and that was the very reasons why the other superheroes were here. Even after all those months of getting to know Peter, they were still going with their plan.
He also found out, that Tony, who he thought was his biological dad, was actually his biological mother who had given birth to him. It freaked him out. Richard Parker didn’t reveal much information on that part about Tony Stark being his mother. He also found out that Steve Rogers-Stark was his biological dad, who had impregnated his mom (Tony).
“Well… I guess it must have slipped their mind with…the news of…my parents’ death and all...” Peter said, clearly didn’t want to talk anything about his parents. Reed realized and backed away from the conversation slowly.
“Huh? Didn’t know they were that kind of people but hey! You can only see things such as that on TV.” Johnny said. Bruce laughed behind him. The human torch raised a brow at the smaller man and Bruce hurriedly hid it with a blush.
Both Starks were quiet. Eyes never faltered from the screen. From here, everyone would prefer if the two argue rather, better that than this current silent treatment. Johnny was about to say something when the elevator chimed, suggesting someone was about to enter. Bruce instantly pushed (More like punching and kicking) Clint under the table to prevent him from being seen while Tony hurriedly turned off the screen just before the elevator flew open, revealing Peter himself. The boy looked adorably confused.
“What is that? I don’t like that.” He caught on what James had found on the video footage. Bruce, Richard and Avengers stopped what they were doing and scanned at the holographic screen.
She couldn’t help it. That kid had the same name as the nephew they had lost a long time ago and she couldn’t help but feel disappointed at herself for not trying to look hard for Peter all those years ago. ‘
smile, earning him a smile in return from his husband. They all drove back home to begin and solve this stuff they had found from the Oscorp to get it over and done with while waiting for the rest of the groups to get back to the tower.
Yes, Bruce, Steve and Tony did feel guilty for doing this to the boy but mission came first. Besides, if Peter was really Spider-man, Tony could at least try to do something to ease…whatever it was that Fury was planning to do to the kid. The least he could do for the boy. And for the very first time ever, Tony hoped they were wrong. He didn’t want Peter to be Spider-man. He wanted Peter to be just Peter, someone who Tony grew to care.
Bruce sighed. Everything right now was a total mess. He could only wish in the end, things would go back to normal, if not okay. He could only pray. He sighed again before getting up and decided to tell and put Steve to bed since Tony was already in his and Steve’s bedroom, fast asleep, but not without curling his arms around his body, trying to make himself as small as he could.
Then Peter looked at his aunty May and knew he couldn’t hide this from her any longer. So he began to describe everything, slowly and with every bit of detail.
“No. I don’t want to tell her just yet since I’m not sure if I’m being approved yet. I don’t want to get her hopes up only for it to be crushed down. She- she has a fragile health. So-…yeah.”
“I really missed your kiss, Steve. We haven’t been kissing anymore ever since our Peter’s gone. But…I...I want
Tony had introduced Peter to Pepper. The boy was a bit shy around her at first, stating that it wasn’t every day you could meet a beautiful woman. Pepper laughed at the comment and few days later, those two became the best of friends. Even Pepper pointed out how the boy was similar to Tony.
“Well, Peter already knows how you look like five months ago. It’s better to be safe than sorry.” Natasha huffed. “Fine.” She took the black wig and shade from Tony. At least she didn’t look like a total dork like Clint.
Below them were robots. “Are those robots?” He asked and realized it. “Dude! Those look like the kinds of robot you see in anime! Like the Gundam, Eureka, Tiger and bunny. A mecha! Are you saying you want our help to uh…? I don’t know? Get ride of these things?” He asked.
Bruce had stayed the night here to make sure and keep an eye on the couple. He watched both Steve and Tony from afar; an understatement expression adorned his face. He could somewhat apprehend what both Tony and Steve were feeling and going through right now. After all, who in their right mind wouldn’t react the same way when you found out your son was being used as nothing but a tool to create another tool?
Both Richard and Steve nodded and were about to head out when Steve said to Richard. “Reed you go ahead and explain to Bruce about our plan, I’ll catch up with you two in a second. I just… Need to talk something to my husband.” Steve said to which Richard nodded in undersanding. Steve then turned to face Tony who had a baffled look grace on his face. It had been so long since the last time he saw that look and Steve just wanted to- well, squeeze his husband right now.
“Tony. We need to talk.” Steve said as he walked towards their bed, placing down the tray on the nightstand table. He turned to face Tony to lay a hand on Tony’s knee to get his attention.
Steve, among all of people, would know that feeling. Losing the people he’d loved, like Peggy and Bucky.  Especially Bucky because Bucky was always there and he was Steve’s most-…the man inhaled. No point dwelling in the past anymore. “I would like to see how good you are so why don’t we start sooner than later. We’ll do it around…weekend? Sounds good to you?” Tony Asked. Peter bobbed his head repeatedly.
“But she doesn’t know the truth. I only told her lies, lies about I adopted the baby when the truth was that I actually stole the child from his biological parents from hospital with the help of my fellow co-workers. But I will be keeping and raising the child for future examination. With this, I can find any complications of the serum afterward or not as the infant grows older.” Mr. Parker said which sent the Avengers to gasp in shock and at the man’s declaration.
Two weeks later, everything went normal for Peter. His aunt May was coming back home from her field trip next week on Tuesday.
their Son Peter has the same name as our little Peter? Just a coincidence that they had a son, a child out of the blue? Didn’t you hear what Richard said? He told us Mary; Peter’s mother couldn’t have a baby. She was infertile. Maybe yes, Mary had told her husband that they didn’t want to adopt a child before, because of their job.”
“Bruce, do you think there are any chances Peter would remember that day? The day he was in the lab or when he was being studied, injected with the serum?” Steve asked. Bruce searched Steve’s facial expression before answering in a way that would be easy for Steve to understand.
He could see the Fantastic Four, the Beast from the X-men, Wolverine who was sitting with a bottle of an alcohol in his hand.
“I—” Peter said but was cut off when Tony decided to come out from his hiding spot and said (surprising the boy). “Of course I won’t mind you call me dad, Peter.  It means you finally accept me and Steve as your new parents--”
“—But we’ve never found the right potential host for it. Still a few months later, a baby that was born with an impediment during child birth had reached our ears and we’d decided to use the mentioned infant us our test subject. To our relief, Therapeutic Serum did it wonder on Peter. The result came positive without any problems. Peter came out safe and sound. And for future notice? I’m going to keep and adopt Peter to see if the serum effect would last long or not. Also we have the infant blood sample for future studies as well. The blood sample is labeled as PBRS, stands for ‘PETER BENJAMIN ROGERS-STARK’.”
Peter was in the waiting room with Steve. He emphasized how he didn’t need Steve to coddle to him but the older man insisted, cuddling the boy protectively in his arms.  “I-I didn’t even have the chance to tell her I love her.” Peter murmured. Eyes rimmed red, as Steve rubbed the boy’s back. He glanced at his husband. For the first time in his life, Tony didn’t have the answers to appease his son’s pain. He just had to be useless when it came to his son, wasn’t he? The goatee man excused himself from the room.
“I…Peter…you-you are not Richard and Mary’s son. You’re adopted.” May reached out to the boy. Peter stayed still and quite as he continued to listen. His face gave nothing away.
Peter was dumbstruck “Wait! Stark Industry?! As in the one and only Stark industry?!” He asked.  Bruce chuckled at the kid’s expression and said. “Ah. Yes…you see Mr. Stark wishes for me to find a better…student for him to take in with…as an internship…err…offer?” He stuttered.
He saw Mr. Parker hold the jar, pricking the needle into it before transferring whatever substance inside it into the syringe.  The man flicked the nozzle twice before heading towards the incubator, opening the postern, reaching his arm to rub the soft spot of the infant before injecting the substance, green liquid poured indignantly into the infant’s system.
“Thanks,” Peter smiles weakly and tries to stand. Steve is faster and helps him up to his feet, and leads him over to the vanity so he can freshen up.
Morgan doesn’t fuss or stir, instead she finds comfort in the familiar scent and drifts back to sleep.
He honestly didn’t know what he was supposed to say at this point. He wonders if Steve would be angry that such a test was even done, or maybe it would be the deceit that ended up starting a fight. Tony didn’t want any of that, not when they’d come this far already, but Tony would understand if it did. It was his fault.
Tony excuses himself at one point, needing a break from the videos. He returns back to his workbench, his mind plotting ideas for his son’s suit. Steve’s sketch had been vague, but it gave him a general idea of what he envisioned for their son. He’d do his best to bring it to life.
He’s finally granted a break and he drops his head down, heavy pants leaving his lips as he tries to regain his breathing. The nurse is the one encouraging him now, no doubt providing a distraction from the doctor between his legs. Her gloved fingers are exploring his sensitive entrance, forcing a whine to escape him.
