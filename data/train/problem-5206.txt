“I love you, Cas,” Dean admits quietly. Castiel says nothing, but the verbal confession forces him to blink and inhale sharply. Clearly Cas wasn’t expecting to have this conversation either. “I know I said you were like a brother to us, but that’s not true. At least for me. This is different. I’m in love with you, Cas. I think I have been for a while now.” Dean pauses, trying to read Cas’ reaction. “Is that okay?” Still, silence. Castiel’s pupils have dilated, and his lips are slightly parted. Mimicking Dean’s earlier response, Castiel swallows and simply answers, “Yes.”
“You love that song,” Castiel teased, echoing words from their past, and snuggling into Dean’s side as best he could in the back seat of the Impala.
“Interesting,” she said, crossing her arms and tapping a finger against her chin. “I know we won’t get into choreography for a while, but do you think you’d be able to teach Dean a few floor moves?”
“Thanks, man.”
“I told you. Without my powers, I lost control over my vessel. I usually keep them hidden, but...I couldn’t help it. I’m sorry, Dean. As soon as you release the handcuffs, I’ll be able to put them away. We probably shouldn’t use the cuffs anymore to prevent it from happening again.”
“Cas always has my back. Just like Sammy does. We have all gone to the mat for each other without hesitation. But it’s the other stuff that makes him special. It’s hard to describe, really, but I feel better when he’s home with us, in the bunker. He’s just got this way of getting under your skin, and then you always want him around.” Dean pauses to take another swig of his liquor. “I have been in some really low points these last few years, and Cas pulled me up every time. The way he can just rest his hand on my shoulder and look at me with those hypnotizing blue eyes just makes me believe it’s all gonna be ok in the end.”
“So, who’s Dean?” Gabriel asked, giving Castiel a minor heart attack after his brother popped up out of nowhere, with one hand on his hip and the other rolling a bright red lollipop between his fingers. “This wouldn’t have anything to do with that pole thing you went to with Anna last week would it?”
Dean closed his eyes and bit the inside of his cheek to fight against the swelling of his cock which had perked up like a damned teenager.  He was suddenly grateful he chose these particularly loose fitting yoga pants.
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean’s brushing his teeth when thoughts of last night swarm his mind. Castiel. The bar. The alley. Was it real? Had he only dreamt about the angel and his own damn greedy hands? Was he under some witch’s spell again? Dean fills his hand with water to rinse his mouth. His fingers brush over his lips. They are still sensitive and slightly chapped. The image of Castiel’s strong neck and jawline burst into his memory. Dean knows he could not have imagined that. It was real. It had happened.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck!. Cas! Cas touch me! I need your hands on me! Please, baby, make me come,” Dean begged.
“Sorry, dude. Didn't mean to startle you,” Dean offered with a smile. “Um, I was wondering if Cas was here. I kinda need to talk to him about something.”
Sam looked down at his hands in his lap and sat silent for a few breaths.
The water has turned lukewarm overhead, but Dean and Cas stand under the spray together, exchanging playful looks and quickly washing away any residual mess. They both freeze when there is a knock at the door. “Dean! What the hell are you doing in there, man? What’s taking so long?” Sam yells from outside the bathroom. Dean laughs and shouts back, “Sorry Sammy, be out in a minute. There’s really great water pressure in here!” Dean can almost hear Sam rolling his eyes. “That’s great, Dean. But, uh, try to save some hot water for the rest of the building, okay?”
“Ah, fuck!” Dean screamed, his head thrown back in a swirl of pleasure and just the right amount of pain. “Oh, god, that’s it, Angel. Fuck me just like that!”
“Oh my god, you own Angel’s Books? I love that place! You’ve got a great YA section, and that guy running the cafe who thinks he’s really funny makes one hell of a honey latte,” she said with a smile.
They shared a look for a moment before Dean looked down and focused on his coffee cup while he continued talking.
Castiel steadied his nerves as he walked into the front room of the studio and immediately made eye contact with Charlie, who had the biggest, most self-satisfied smile he’d ever seen on anyone who wasn’t Gabriel.
Castiel was reaching into an ice chest for a beer when a voice startled him from behind.
Dean turned his back to him, swaying his ass from side to side. He turned around, sliding the red sash around his slim waist until it came off in his hand. Slowly, he walked toward Castiel and wrapped the soft fabric around his neck. Grinning like the lovestruck fool he was, Castiel was already hard in his pajama pants when Dean blew him a kiss and popped the Santa hat on top of his head. It was silly and sexy and perfect. Dean backed away, letting the velvet jacket slip off his bare shoulders and tossing it to the side. He stepped up to the shiny new pole in the corner and reached high to grip and pull himself into an inversion, his bowlegs forming a “v” above his head. From there Dean did a few simple spins, before sliding down to the hardwood floor. He crawled forward, looking up at Castiel through thick lashes. Once he reached his target, he gripped Castiel by his thighs to help pull him back to his feet. Standing over him, he tucked his thumbs into the hem of his pants. Dean pulled them down slowly, revealing a pair of deliciously red satin panties with lace trim and a tiny white bow. Silver cursive lettering covered the front that said “Open Me”.
Dean slowly lowered his body down until he could drop and land softly on the wood floor. The music came to an end and without warning, the curtain was pulled open dramatically to announce their presence.
“Yes. I think we should fuck. Just get it out of our system. Cause if I have to try and sleep while you’re just right there in the next bed, I might go insane.”
Something in the back of Dean’s mind whispered that sitting here staring at Cas all night wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing. But the guy did offer to listen to his problems. He took a deep breath and let out an obnoxiously loud sigh.
It had been two days since Dean agreed to take on Castiel as a partner. Tonight marked their first official rehearsal. Rehearsal was a loose term here, since he and Pam would be putting Cas through a crash course on Pole 101 as quickly and as safely possible. They budgeted at least a few weeks to bring Cas up to speed and let him gain the necessary strength and skill to actually start practicing choreography. Pam’s Intro to Pole class was an eight week course. They were hoping to cut that in half for Castiel.
“You know, it really pisses me off to hear you say things like about yourself. I mean, I get that it's scary to put yourself out there like that. But, Dean. You're the best person I know. You’re strong. You’re a fighter.  You’ve always put others ahead of your own happiness, and now you’ve got it basically right in front of you, but you won’t try and fight for it. I honestly think you might be surprised what happens if you actually talk to him about how you feel.”
How had he already mastered the sad puppy look that Dean could never resist? Up until now, it only ever worked when Sam or, on occasion, Charlie did it.
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean grunted, rolling his eyes and looking away to slyly wipe his mouth with the back of his hand, just in case.
Dean stood there, chewing on his bottom lip while he thought about Castiel’s question. Up until five minutes ago, he’d been having a pretty shitty day… but now? He barely knew this dude, and yet he had somehow 180°-ed his mood with just a flash of his baby blues.
Finally inside his office-closet, he closed the door, hung up his old trench coat, and flopped into his squeaky desk chair. Away from the knowing and overly suspicious eyes of his brother, he allowed himself to check his phone for any new messages while the computer booted up.
“You look really familiar. Where have I seen you?”
“Alright Taylor Swift, you’re done here,” Dean growled.
“Dean and Castiel? You’re all set. You can take your places on the stage, please.”
“Give me your hands, Angel,” Dean said. Cas held both hands out in front of him as Dean cuffed each wrist.
So, each night they explored each other a little more. Of course, Castiel already knew Dean’s body and soul like a well worn map, but that didn’t stop him from looking again. And again. And again.
“You love this song. You said Swayze always gets a pass. And it was your idea to play Rock, Paper Scissors to help us decide,” Cas whispered back. “Although, I do have a confession. Sam let it slip that you always throw scissors during that game, so I knew I had an advantage,” he said in a rush.
Castiel swallowed and looked up at Dean, his eyes hooded and dark. “Dean. I’ve been thinking about this. I want to give you control over my body. Because I trust you. But, I can’t make any promises about what will happen if I get physically overwhelmed while being tied down. I don’t think I’ll hurt you, but-,” Dean placed two fingers over Cas’ lips before stepping forward and replacing his fingers with a soft kiss. As he pulled back, Dean's eyes stayed shut and he whispered, “I’ve got you, Cas. Let me take care of you.” Dean slowly opened his eyes to see Cas nodding in agreement.
But he didn’t. As much as he wanted to, he kept his distance, staring at each other until a kid running past them made them jump. With the moment officially broken, Dean found he could breathe once again.
It didn’t hurt that Dean was an extremely flirty drunk. He kept finding reasons to touch him. Like reaching up to tug on his hair when he teased about how unruly it was. He brushed his thumb over Cas’ chin and with a wink suggested he not shave before the competition because the scruff was sexy. Before long, their faces were barely inches apart, giggling over stupid jokes and paying no attention to their friends. Castiel really did his best to look Dean in the eye and not at his tempting mouth. He must not have been doing a very good job. Eventually, Dean leaned over, lips ghosting over the shell of his ear to whisper.
Dean turned and took a seat in the arm chair along the wall. “Good. Now, Cas. You said you want me to take control. So. Strip. Slowly.”
What felt like a lifetime passed in the few seconds while Dean was pulled in closer to Castiel by some invisible force. Dean’s heart pounded in his chest when their lips brushed together, barely touching. Castiel’s lips felt like a live wire that sent a course of electricity through Dean’s veins that he could feel in the tips of his fingers. He studied Cas’ face for any signs that he had misread the signals and crossed a line. Finding only want in those big blue eyes, Dean leaned forward again to seal their mouths together in a soft but heated kiss. Kiss after kiss after kiss, they sat, Cas leaning back against Dean’s chest. Cas brought a hand up, reaching behind him to card his fingers though Dean’s hair. When Cas’ tongue brushed against his mouth, Dean let out a breathy moan, quickly parting his lips to let Cas in. He let his hands wander over Cas’ ribs and around to his belly. When he lightly traced over a nipple with his finger nail, Castiel shivered in his arms and arched his back, bringing his ass in direct contact with Dean’s groin. They pulled apart, panting against each other. Dean looked down, over Castiel’s shoulder, to see Cas’ cock tenting obscenely in his tiny black shorts. Surely, Cas could feel that Dean was under the same effect from where he sat, Dean’s entire length trapped between his belly and Cas’ back, throbbing.
Upon hearing that, Castiel leaned forward on his elbows, pursed his lips and arched his right eyebrow. “Let me be the judge of that,” he urged gently.
Dean takes a long breath and slowly exhales through his lips. “You know, I don’t have a lot of memories of my mother. She was taken from us when I was only four. But one thing I can recall is my mom telling me angels were watching over me. And now, wouldn’t you know it, one actually does. One stubborn, overly protective, self-sacrificing warrior of God was chosen to save me. One angel literally pulled me out of Hell and told me I was worth saving. And then he rebelled against Heaven to fight beside me and my brother to save the world.” Dean looks up with a proud grin on his face and a slight blush in his cheeks.
“We still need lube. I’m happy to open you up with my tongue if you want,” he whispered low and rough. “But if you want my cock inside you, we need to find lube.”
“Alright, then. I think it’s time for some tunes.” Dean turned on his heel, trying to break the tension, and walked straight to the stereo system. Cranking up Led Zeppelin always helped get him in the zone during practice. He bopped his head along with the beat and turned around to find Castiel staring at him with a curious look. “What’s wrong?”
“Charlie, tell me this idea isn’t completely crazy,” Dean asked, staring out of the windows to the dark parking lot.
“Is this okay, angel?”
“Sounds good, Dean,” Charlie said on her way to the backroom, likely to reheat her coffee in the microwave. Before she disappeared through the curtain, she stopped and looked at Dean straight in the eye , “Tell Castiel I said hi,” she said and hid her smile behind her cup as Dean flailed in surprise.
“Oh! Well...great! I think that sounds like a fun idea!” Castiel tried to sound sincere. He knew his sister. She would go to two classes. Maybe three, before losing interest.
Not breaking eye contact with Cas, Dean, smiling, replies to her, “Yeah, sounds like a good plan. Thanks for, uh, the talk.” Castiel mirrors his smile. “Maybe we should continue this outside, Dean.”
Dean knows thier time alone is limited. As soon as they reach the motel, they will have Sam to deal with. As they cross a small alley way, Dean instinctively grabs Cas by the hand and pulls him into the dark space. “I can’t wait anymore,” Dean pleads and pushes Cas against the brick. Not wanting to be overly agressive, Dean holds back his overwhelming desire to claim Cas as his right there in the street. Instead, he steadies himself with a deep breath and reaches both hands up to Cas’s face. He takes a step closer to Cas as their lips finally make contact for the first time. It’s slow and gentle, but Dean has never poured more of himself into a kiss before this one. This one kiss that changes everything. Because best friends don’t kiss like this.
“Really? We spent almost all day together. You sure you aren’t tired of me yet?”
Castiel watched through his passenger side window as Anna’s car navigated through the trendy East side of Austin, knowing too well that he wasn't cool enough for this neighborhood. It was a nice clear night to be out anyway; the air cold and fresh, but not too chilly. Despite only being one week into the new year, he hoped it meant a mild winter.
“Dude, calm down. No one actually watches this show for the medical accuracy. People watch for the drama and the good looking cast. I mean, Dr. Sexy is named that for a reason.”
“Hey. Don’t be nervous, man. You guys are gonna be great tomorrow.”
“Good. Are you okay to keep going?”
He barely noticed the little bell above the door as it opened and brought in a chill. But a moment later, they were greeted by Anna as she bounced in with a smile and landed at their table, in sweats and clutching a canvas tote bag.
“Um, Dean. I know what you’re doing. This is the same trick that Johnny used in Dirty Dancing when he was teaching Baby how to dance.”
“Yeah, follow me sugar,” Pam said, turning to walk back into the studio space. Castiel gripped his bag and followed dutifully.
“Well Dean, do you think we won?”
All of a sudden, staying a little later didn’t seem so bad.
“Wait, what?” Dean asked, clearly taken aback. “Then why would you want to do this? Huh? Why would you want to help me?” Dean asked suspiciously.
“I’ll try anyway. It’s the thought that counts. Just let me say this once and I’ll let it go if that’s what you really want. There is the potential for something really great here. But if you don’t try and fix your mistakes about how you acted, then you will lose it. And that one will be your fault.”
“Um, I know about these things because I talk to him. I ask him things about his life. And he tells me. Sorry Dean. You’re not my only BFF anymore. You two are gonna have to share me,” she said, shrugging. “Anyway, the gist of it is that he and his ex were engaged. They were supposed to open the bookstore together, but then Cas found out the guy cheated. The douchebag told him he had made a mistake asking Cas to marry him. Cas was left trying to open the store by himself. That’s why his brother stepped in to help run the place.”
. You’re perfect. I know you said it’s been a while, but I didn’t think you meant that long. How is that possible?”
“Ahem,” Charlie rumbled obnoxiously, clearing her throat from where she stood, her eyes bouncing from Dean to Cas.
Castiel looked up at Dean with wide eyes and flushed cheeks, more than the champagne could be responsible for.
“Oh yeah. Right there. Can you push a little harder?”
“Um, yeah totally! Throw your stuff in the back,” Charlie said with a friendly smile.
Castiel’s not sure how long he actually stood there, getting his first look at Dean from only a few feet away. Now that the main overhead lights were on in the building, he could see details that were previously hidden in the dimness. Specifically, mossy green eyes and a galaxy of freckles sprinkled across Dean’s nose and along his cheekbones. His mouth pulled up on one side in a charming grin that showed off full pouty lips. Luckily for Castiel’s sanity, he was dressed again, back in the low slung ratty jeans and a white t-shirt. He was still delectable, but at least he wasn’t nearly naked. A few seconds (or hours, he really couldn’t be sure) later, his brain kindly reminded him that he had been asked a question.
Dean switched the toy off again and carefully started working it into Cas’s hole, pulling it back out every few minutes to play with the rim with the tip of his thumb, gently stretching it. All the while, Cas seemed to fall into a zen-like state. His cheek against the pillow, arms restrained over his head, legs tucked up under him, and ass in the air, Castiel kept his eyes shut as he took deep even breaths. Dean would’ve worried he wasn’t affected if it weren’t for Cas’s cock, hard and leaking where the tip rubbed against the sheet.
“Which part?”
Castiel’s blue eyes went soft as he smiled at Dean. “Okay, Dean.”
He had one foot on the pavement when his phone buzzed and looking at it he realized he’d missed a few texts from Charlie.
Charlie stared at him for a moment, a smile slowly spreading across her face, as if she’d just learned some valuable information.
Charlie could always make him smile. Even when she was calling him out on his bullshit.
Of course in the back of his mind, Dean knew he was dangerously close to a state he could only describe as contentment. He could feel himself falling farther and farther into a place that might be impossible to climb out of again.
There’s a pause before Sam continues, “Hey we haven’t heard from Cas in a couple days. Why don’t we call him and see if he wants to meet us at the diner.” Dean fights to control his laughter and buries his face into Cas’ neck. After Cas nods his head, Dean answers, “Yeah, that is a great idea Sammy. I’ll give him a call as soon as I get out, okay?” There’s another pause before, “It’s cool, I’ll just call him right now.” “Wait, Sa-“ Before Dean could finish his protest, the familiar ring of Cas’ cell phone fills the bathroom from inside his coat pocket. Dean and Cas stand frozen as the ringtone comes to a stop. From outside the bathroom, they hear, “Um, Cas? Are you in there?” “Good morning, Sam,” Cas answers from inside the shower.  Dean shrugs his shoulders and grins at his angel, refusing to let his brother ruin his post sex euphoria. Multiple orgasms are worth having to deal with Sam’s bitch face.
“Cassie! Guess what? I’m going to sign up for the beginner’s class!” Anna bounced up and down excitedly.
“Yes, I remember Anna. Actually Dean here gave me his card for the shop he works at and suggested we get the car towed there tomorrow,” he said, gesturing towards Dean.
All Dean did was roll his eyes and grumble quietly to himself.
“You want the Cliff’s Notes of it? I had no idea such an awkward dude with no natural rhythm could turn into a feral sex god in the sack. I mean, it was just supposed to be quick drunk fuck, not the best fucking sex of my life.”
They were each planning a solo routine, on top of their duo. If they won that, they had agreed to split it evenly. Lisa was a single mom to a kid named Ben. She was planning to add the money to his college savings.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about Gabriel,” Castiel replied, rolling his eyes. “And if something happened this weekend, you’d be the last person I’d tell.”
“Come here. Let me get a closer look at you,” Dean requested with open arms. Cas went without hesitation and stood in front of Dean, watching as Dean reached up to brush his fingers over Cas’ hips and down to his thighs. Holding Cas in place, Dean pulled the navy blue fabric down, just an inch or two on his left side, and leaned forward to place a soft kiss on the exposed skin there. He felt Cas flinch and heard a quiet whimper. Dean looked up through hooded lashes.
“Charlie! I was wondering when you were going to stop by,” Castiel said, with a big gummy smile.
Dean felt himself flush from the praise. He ducked his head down and wiped his hands over his face in embarrassment. “I don’t know if I’d call it that.”
Dean takes a sip from his glass, a lop-sided grin still on his face. The bar tender eyes him perceptively. “Family? Wow. So you guys have gotten really close, then?”
The audience cheered and clapped as Pam walked off to the side toward her students. Castiel watched as six women, all different ages and sizes, took their places at each pole. A moment later, the lights were dimmed a bit more, and a heavy beat filled the room.
After Pam shut the door behind her, Dean and Castiel looked at each other. This was the first time they were truly alone together.
“I’ll be back in a bit. Don’t go anywhere, baby,” he said with a devilish laugh. Cas’ eyes went wide and his mouth dropped as he watched Dean turn and walk out of the room.
“Ummm,” he answered elegantly.
A few hours later Castiel and the rest of Dean’s cheering squad whooped and hollered as Dean was announced as the first place winner in the men’s solo category. Of course Castiel was biased, but there was no doubt Dean was the best in the group. The other routines were good of course. But they were also a little boring. Their music selection was bland and their performance was basic. Watching Dean up on stage, under the lights with the wailing rhythms of Led Zeppelin was hypnotizing. Dean was unforgettable.
Cas reached up to wipe his hand over his mouth, but missed his target, and managed to smear it over his bottom lip. “Did I get it?”
Cas’ eyes fluttered and he exhaled loudly.
Dean whipped his head back around to find Castiel standing in front of him with wide scared eyes.
It turned out that Dean was right. Castiel still couldn’t believe it himself, but they had this. Perhaps luck was on their side because a lot of the other teams made errors that the judges took off points for. But Dean and Castiel nailed every trick in their routine. And hours later, they had the trophy to prove it. Dean’s face had been radiant in pride ever since the winners were announced at the closing ceremony. Dean, Castiel and their little cheering squad gathered outside in the parking lot, ready to split up for the three hour ride back to Austin. Their precious trophy found a spot on Baby’s front seat.
“Yes. No. I don’t know,” Castiel stuttered. “Do it again,” he pleaded, making Dean huff a quiet laugh. He settled himself down on his belly in between Castiel’s legs and swept over Castiel’s exposed hole with his flat tongue, over and over again, until Castiel became a whiney, writhing mess. He pointed his tongue and flicked it over the sensitive skin, gradually pushing in and working him open. Dean covered his index finger in spit and worked it gently into him. When Cas quietly begged for more, Dean added his middle finger and continued to stretch him open. When Castiel began rolling his hips, simultaneously humping the mattress and fucking himself back on Dean’s fingers, Dean scraped his teeth over the flesh of Castiel’s ass and bit down in a warning. He kissed the same spot and slowly removed his fingers, despite Castiel’s protesting.
“There’s no need to apologize Cas. I just don’t want you pushing yourself and getting hurt.”
“Um, me too. I have to admit I’m kind of nervous. I just hope I don’t make too big a fool of myself. You can feel free to call this whole thing off if I’m terrible. I won’t take offense, I promise.”
From there, they moved on to showing Cas how to grip the pole, and how to use the pole for conditioning exercises. Dean would demonstrate first and Cas would copy him. It only took him a few tries to be able to pull his feet up into a crunch, holding onto the pole for support. Each time he got something right, he looked over at Dean and smiled.
“So, Castiel. Dean told me you’ve had some pretty extensive martial arts training?”
Three dots appeared almost immediately.
Secret morning shower sex!
“Does he know?”
“Really? Tell me.” The bar tender looks at Dean fondly, mirroring his smile.
Sam stayed silent for a minute, before he just had to open his mouth again.
“Oh. Great. Yeah, Castiel. What did you think of the show?” Charlie asked, tilting her head slightly and bouncing her eyebrows.
“I mean, sure. I wouldn’t kick him out of bed.” Still chewing, he added, “not really my type though.”
Gabriel took one look at him and -holding his coffee hostage- narrowed his eyes. "Spill. What’s got you buzzing in here like a bumblebee in paradise?” Gabriel’s wide smile and bouncing eyebrows already had Castiel rolling his eyes.
“I know it’s a crazy idea, but hear me out,” Castiel continued in a gentle tone, as if approaching a wild animal like Dean, who might bite him and run away if he felt threatened.
One thing was clear. Charlie had been correct in her assessment. The routine he had seen with Lisa was an act. Brilliant, yes. But, this wasn't any flashy performance; Dean was in his own little world. And Castiel felt like a voyeur, catching a glimpse of something private.
Sam was quiet. Looking down the beach and shaking his head.
Before their conversation could continue, their attention was directed to the clinking of a glass and then at Pam, who now stood in the middle of the room, waiting for the room to quiet down.
“Nevermind. And yes. Gabriel Novak, how do you do? I’m Cassie’s big brother.”
“What’d you think of the show?”
Castiel rolled his eyes to himself. He should have known Dean would be uncomfortable accepting all of the money if they won. With a sigh, he smiled up at the ceiling. “Okay Dean. Fifty-fifty. You have yourself a deal.”
Dean noticed Cas’s face drop just a bit. His now tight smile no longer reached his eyes. Castiel wrapped his hands around the empty coffee mug. “I’m sorry I assumed,” he said, bowing his head a little. “You two seemed to have great chemistry during your routine, so I just figured that came from somewhere, ya know?” Castiel continued staring at the bottom of his coffee cup while the conversation lulled. Dean took a sip as he looked to his right, inwardly cringing a little at the awkward silence and trying to come up with anything he could use as an excuse to stay here with Cas. After a minute, Castiel’s mouth pulled up in a smirk.
Dean wrapped his free arm around Cas’ waist to keep him as close as possible while he worked to get Cas off. His legs hugged Cas’ sides tight as Cas gently rocked his ass back and forth against Dean’s cock with the deliciously right amount of pressure.
“Dean didn’t tell you everything about the accident, did he?”
(See the end of the chapter for
An insistent pounding woke him sometime around noon. He squinted at his phone screen indicating three missed calls and six messages, all from Charlie. He only had one guess as to who it was knocking at his door when he would normally be at work. He dragged himself out of bed and went straight to the door, not even bothering to put pants on. One quick check through the peephole confirmed his suspicions and he pulled the door open for his best friend, and leaned against the door frame.
“Uh, yes. Aikido, specifically. Growing up, our father insisted we know how to defend ourselves properly if the need ever arose. It hasn’t, but that’s beside the point,” he said, rolling his eyes. “My brothers practice karate, but I found aikido to be more enjoyable in study. It teaches one how to take down an attacker without mortally injuring them. I don’t believe in using any more violence than is necessary, unlike my brothers. I’m still fairly proficient, although I stopped practicing about two years ago. Now I mostly just run in the mornings before work.”
Dean’s trance is broken when he feels Castiel’s hand on his shoulder, covering the same skin where Cas first touched him in Hell those years ago. Cas pulls Dean to his feet and pushes him flat against the tile. Hands roam over bare skin. Mouths meet again, lips parting to allow tongues to taste and explore. Castiel rolls his hips, his hard cock brushing Dean’s, causing a quieted moan out of each of them. “I want to try something, Dean,” Cas whispers between kisses. “Whatever you want Cas, it’s yours,” Dean replies breathlessly.
When Dean reached the swell of his ass, he peeled the delicate lace down and backed away momentarily to tug them off. Then he reached back up and used his hands to completely expose his hole. He hovered over it, lightly blowing cool air over the sensitive skin.
“Dean, I’m sorry to inform you that Castiel here is going to be my other BFF from now on. He owns the bookstore over on Lamar and has promised me a BFF discount,” she said with pride.
The days quickly turned into weeks. From the very beginning, day after day, Cas showed up. He put in the work. Obviously he was always strong, thanks to his years of martial arts training. But in their rehearsals, he gained a new kind of strength. A new confidence. There was a brightness in his eyes that had been dulled when Dean first met him. Now they seemed to sparkle each time he walked into the studio.
“You don’t seem fine. Is this about last night?”
“Hmmm? Oh, yeah,” she continued. “All the way from regionals to international levels even. Obviously most people just do pole for fun, or as a cool workout. But for those who compete, it’s a big deal. Plus, there’s a pretty nice check waiting for the first place winner at nationals.”
Castiel made a hasty retreat for the little office hidden off in the corner. It wasn’t much. Just big enough for a desk with an old computer, a few shelves, and coat hooks. Calling it an office was a generous term as it wasn’t much more than a moderately sized closet. But it gave Castiel some semblance of privacy when he needed it.
Lisa huffed a laugh. “Why would I? I mean, I’ll step back in if I need to of course. But it’s pretty clear that Dean already has the partner that he wants. At least something good came out of my accident. You know he and I had coffee at The Last Drop a few weeks ago? Right after y'all came back from Dallas.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and smiled at his sister. “Yes, you were right. Next time you offer to bring me along for an article you’re working on, maybe I won’t be so…,” Castiel as interrupted by another round of cheers, this time even louder and more spirited. When he found the cause, his brain short-circuited. Dean was walking back toward the poles. The difference being...he had removed his jeans. He was down to nothing but a really small pair of black shorts that only covered the bare necessities and hugged his little bubble butt amazingly well.
Dean’s own erection was becoming almost painful inside his underwear. It was time to move on to the next part of his plan. He turned the plug off again and let Castiel catch his breath.
“So, after that, Sammy suggested I come down here with him. It’s always just been the two of us anyway really. So, Sammy went to school and I went to work.”
Time had marched forward like it always does, the days grew longer and warmer, and suddenly, the weekend of the regional competition was here. Since it was being held in Dallas, everyone agreed to split up and take two cars for the three hour road trip. Charlie, Dorothy, and Pam were taking Charlie’s yellow Volkswagen Beetle. That left Dean driving Cas, Sam, and Jess in the Impala.
Dean smiled as he gently patted the outside of his jacket pocket.
As the song rambled on, imploring over and over again what could be done to earn the love of another, Dean and Castiel grew more unaware of their audience which had migrated off the dance floor. Sam and Jess sat at a round table with Charlie and her new wife, Dorothy, all resting their feet and watched the scene in front of them.
“Hello Dean. I guess I’m as ready as I’ll ever be.” Castiel leaned down into the open window. “Good morning Sam. Jess,” he answered, giving a little awkward wave to the couple in the back seat. He slid onto the leather seat and set down a small paper gift bag from his store next to him. When Dean took his place in the driver’s seat he looked over curiously at the bag.
The next morning, Dean was already wide awake, having choked down the bitter coffee supplied in his room. He was showered and dressed as he stepped into the elevator and hit the button for the floor above his. He buried the anxiety of today’s events in the back of his mind. He had higher priorities right now. He had to talk to Cas. He had to know they were still okay. He stepped off the elevator and was rounding the corner when he caught sight of Balthazar standing in Cas’ doorway. He froze on the spot, watching Balthazar give Cas a quick hug, before backing away with a nod of his head as Cas quietly shut his door. He turned and walked up the hall toward Dean, who had no means of escape before being seen.
“Um, you’re welcome I guess,” he said, unsure of himself. “I mean, I don’t really know what I did to help. I just sat and listened. Dean told me about Lisa and about how you got him into dancing after his accident and about his plans for the garage and that everything is kind of on hold now.”
Castiel suspected Dean’s pouting was all for show since he quickly fell right into the choreography, showing as much excitement for their new plan as Castiel had when he suggested it in the first place.
“There’s a competition for pole dancing?”
“Anyway, we should get going,” Anna suggested. “I’ve got a staff meeting at 8 tomorrow morning, and I want to organize my notes for the article.”
“So perfect.”
“Cool, thanks,” Anna said, turning and disappearing behind the fuchsia curtain.
“Been a busy week, but I had to come by and see my new best friend,” Charlie said, wrapping her arms around Castiel for a quick hug.
The blinding smile he received was reward enough.
Dean walked over to their makeshift bar and took a bottle off the shelf. “Nothing too exciting, Sammy. Getting me a midnight drink and calling it a night,” Dean replied, dropping a handful of ice cubes into a glass, followed by his favorite whisky.
After a few seconds of silence and a side-eye directed towards her brother, Anna admitted, “No... but my point still stands. It will be fun, I promise. Pole studios are a really popular fitness alternative to gyms nowadays and my supervisor loved my idea about doing a feature for the Chronicle,” she concluded as the car came to a stop at a red light. She looked over at Castiel with that same pleading look she had perfected years ago when they were children, knowing it worked on Cas every time she wanted something.
“You won’t, Cas. I promise you, whether we win or lose at regionals, I’m still glad we did this.”
“Dean?”
“Very funny Dean.”
“What? I’m sure you have your secrets. I have mine,” she said casually, looking to the side where the bookmarks were hanging on a little display.
“Yeah,” Dean said, clearing his throat. “Yeah, you’re...you’re right. That’s what’s important.” Dean’s hands fidgeted by his sides, restless for some reason. He ducked his head down, unable to look Cas in the eye anymore. “Thanks Cas.” He looked around behind him awkwardly. “I guess I should go and let you get back to work. I’ll see you in practice.”
The golden California sunset found Dean with his ass in the sand feeling better than he had in years. Even though he wouldn’t be bringing home any prize money from the solo category, he knew third place was still something to be proud of, so he couldn’t find himself to be too upset. Everyone he cared about was here with him, enjoying the day. After the day’s results were announced, they all left the hotel and spent a few hours exploring the San Diego Zoo. Dean laughed to himself, remembering Cas running up to him in the gift shop holding up a T-shirt with two cartoon koalas clinging to a tree branch together, insisting they each get one. Dean had rolled his eyes in false irritation at the cheesy souvenir, before pulling out his wallet and paying for them both. A shriek caused him to look up to find Charlie and Jess ganging up on Cas and dunking him under the waves. Cas came up spitting out salt water and shaking his head before chasing them through the surf.
“Oh, Jesus fuck,” Dean gasped, his cock twitching in response.
“Dean, if you start drooling, I’m never gonna let you hear the end of it,” Sam said with a teasing grin.
Dean stepped out of the dark and into the embracing warmth and light of the little coffee shop. He filled his lungs with sweet-scented air and painted on a smile when Alfie greeted him from behind the counter.
Clearing his throat, Castiel picked his bag up and gestured toward Charlie’s Beetle. “Hey Charlie, why don’t I ride back with you guys this time?”
“Well, I’ve been thinking. I like the idea of being tied up. Not anything crazy of course. I just like the thought of what might happen, knowing I didn't have complete control over my vessel. Couldn’t touch you, even if I wanted to.” Cas paused for a moment. “What do you think, Dean?” Cas looked up to find Dean frozen, staring back at him.
“Okay, well, when Sammy and I first moved down to Austin, Bobby gave me a job immediately at the shop. I don’t even think he needed the help but he insisted. Because of that I was able to support myself and Sam while he was at school.”
“God, Dean,” Cas panted. “You really are a beautiful sight. Your lips around my cock.”
Dean leaned down in between them to haul up a worn cardboard box full of cassette tapes and dropped it right in Cas’s lap. “And for being awesome, you get to choose our driving music.”
“Anna is short for Anael. We were all named for angels,” Castiel replied, pausing for a moment before explaining. “Our parents were very religious.”
Dean can't keep his hands to himself after admitting his true feelings to Cas
Dean’s self control was definitely being tested. Castiel had a voice made for sex, and here he was moaning in his ear while Dean had his hands on him. He forced his body under control before it could betray him with an inappropriately timed erection.
Dean blinked a few times and swallowed hard.
“Wow. I’m impressed,” Castiel said with certainty. “Really sounds like you’ve come a long way and worked really hard to get here. You should be proud of that. And Lisa seems like a really great partner. Are you two, you know…,” he questioned awkwardly, his voice wavering a little.
“Cas! Tell me you’re close, baby. I want us to come together, so you gotta tell me,” Dean said in between breaths.
Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d gotten more than four hours of good sleep.  Sleep that wasn’t the result of being pass-out drunk that left a massive hangover the next day. He squints his eyes, still blurry from sleep as he surveys the little motel room. Sam is sitting at the small dining table, fully dressed, typing something into his laptop. “Hey, Sammy. What time is it?” Dean mumbles. Sam raises his eyebrows and looks up from his work with a warm smile. “Ah, good morning, Sleeping Beauty. It is just past 9am,” he answers, watching Dean slowly sit up from his tangled sheets. “What?! Damn, why didn’t you wake me? Don’t we need to get on the road or something?” Sam laughs and closes his computer. “Eh, no need. I still need to figire out what the deal is with this possible case in Iowa. I don’t want us to make the trip if it’s really just kids playing pranks. So, we should probably just hang out here for another day, if that’s cool. And you were out, man. I figured I’d let you sleep.” Dean stands and reaches his arms up over his head, stretching out the kinks in his muscles. “Thanks, little brother. I guess I needed the rest after last night,” Dean says, smiling to himself as he makes his way toward the bathroom. Sam huffs, “Yeah, I guess that vamp nest really wore you out last night, huh?” Dean freezes mid stride. “Wha-yep. The vamp nest. That’ll do it. Damn vampires,” Dean says, hoping to sound believable. “I’m gonna get washed up. Then how about we go find some breakfast, huh?” “Sounds good, Dean,” Sam replies as the bathroom door shuts.
“Dean, you know the only thing that can restrain me properly are the Enochian handcuffs. Do you have any idea where they are? I took the liberty of searching the weapons room, and even in the Impala’s trunk, but I couldn’t locate them.”
They stood on opposite sides of the pastry counter, sizing each other up for a moment, before a shrill giggle pulled their focus. Dean’s eye found Cas kneeling on the wood floor in front of the register. A little girl stood in front of him; she couldn’t have been older than five. From where they stood, he couldn’t hear what Cas was saying, but it had her laughing hysterically, her brown pigtail braids bouncing off her shoulders and her big brown eyes lit up in joy.
Castiel gave him one last warm smile, before it disappeared, his eyes turned down.
“Get on with it,” Cas said, his voice laced with desperation. “I can take more, Dean. You don’t have to go so slowly.”
“Is that so?” Dean began lazily rocking back and forth on Castiel’s lap. Smiling, he leaned down to pepper Cas with kisses. “Well, in that case, do you have any plans for tomorrow night,” he asked, playfully nibbling on Cas’s bottom lip.
“I think you should fuck me,” Dean said, grinning and leaning back on his hands.
“I didn’t mean to take advantage of you. I take responsibility for Saturday night, what I said the next morning was wrong. I didn’t mean it when I said it was a mistake. But I was scared. Scared that I was getting too comfortable and letting you get too close. Because when anything good comes my way, I find a way to fuck it up. And you’ve become one of my best friends in all this, and I don’t want to lose that. So I pushed you away. Now, I just realize I was an asshole.”
Cas blinked and looked down. “Um, maybe this is a really bad time to mention this, but I don’t really know how to dance.”
Dean’s eyes widened as he held on for dear life as Cas fucked him hard and fast. His fingers wrapped around Dean’s cock where it bounced on his belly, rock hard, and jerked him at a pace that matched his thrusts.
Dean pressed his lips together in a quick tight smile, looking down again. “Trust me, it’s really not anything impressive.”
“Much better, thank you,” he huffed. “I’d really like to repay you for your kindness, if that’s okay.”
“Fffuck,” Dean rasped. He felt a burning in his chest and audibly dragged air into his lungs. How long had he been holding his breath?
“Be that as it may, I have to agree with Rowena McLeod. I’ve seen you boys rehearse for months. But Sunday, something was definitely different. I don’t know what happened between you two, but you need to fix it so we can get to work. We have eight weeks until nationals in San Diego. We have to develop a whole new routine. So, boys. We’ve got work to do.”
Castiel hesitated for a moment, but grabbed Dean’s hand to seal their promise. “Deal,” Cas said nodding with a tight smile.
“Uh, ok Cas. What do you mean by “different”?
From where they sat on the floor, neither Dean or Cas looked up in response. “Sure,” Dean uttered. “Why not?”
“No. And he doesn’t need to. Nothing good could come from that. He’s too good for someone like me, and I’d much rather keep him around as a friend than scare him off with something that big. Better this way.”
“We...I- something might have happened a couple of months ago. One night at the studio. Please don’t tell Pam. It wasn’t a big deal. And we agreed that it was a one time thing and we were cool. And we were. Until this weekend. And I knew it was a bad idea for us to share a room. I knew that. I should have gotten my own room. I should have kept my hands to myself, but I didn’t because I’m a dumbass with a crush.”
“You did,” she said sweetly, not missing a beat.
Dean chewed on his bottom lip and glanced up slightly at Castiel. Castiel nodded and opened his mouth to answer him just as a stage assistant in a headset approached them.
Castiel lowered his body over Dean until they were finally face to face.
“Yeah! Sounds like it. How many angels are we talking about here?”
Long after the sun went down, Dean found himself alone in his room, digging through his bag for his phone charger and coming up empty handed. Looking at his phone screen again, he cursed himself for forgetting it. With only eleven percent battery life left, it wouldn’t last much longer.
While he told Kevin he’d be in the closet-office working on this week’s payroll, he had immediately pulled up a search engine. He spent the better part of two hours immersed in videos, reading pages upon pages of rules and regulations, and going to war with his own imagination. It was a crazy idea. One that was definitely out of his comfort zone. But perhaps that’s exactly what he needed. Anna was right. All he did anymore was go to work and come home to an empty apartment, eat the same dinner and reread the same books every night before dragging himself to bed, just to do it all again the next day. He’d spent so long wrapped up in his own little cocoon, hiding away from life and it’s possibilities.
“I was,” Dean uttered, his brows pinching together.
“Um, hello. I have eyes,” she answered pointing to her own face. “You started texting me for info as soon as I sat next to him at the showcase. The crush is nothing new. I’m talking about what happened after the sex. Your little pillow talk confession where you told him it would be easy to fall for him, followed by your big panic the next morning where you called the entire thing a big mistake, and basically giving him the silent treatment for the rest of the weekend. Kind of a dick move. Especially considering all the shit his ex put him through.”
Dean dropped his head in his hands.
“Well, welcome,” Castiel answered, gesturing widely toward the rest of the store. “To what do we owe the visit? You looking for anything in particular?”
Castiel was distracted when he looked past Anna to see the very tall man from before attempting to fold himself into a sitting position on the floor. He wrapped his arm around the pretty girl Anna was just conversing with. His mind started connecting the dots after a few seconds. Was her brother in law the man with the beautiful smile?
“Pretty much. But they’ll get there.”
Cas looked up at him and back down to his plate. “It’s pretty good. How’s your pie?”
Silence settled between them. Feeling the need to steer the subject into safer territory, Dean looked over at Cas’ half eaten dessert.
When he finally gave in this afternoon and told Gabriel what he was planning, they had gone over all the pros and cons of taking on something like this. And bless Gabriel; he only teased him for a few minutes before realizing how serious he was. One of Gabriel’s concerns (and another reason he’s a good big brother) was Castiel’s crush on Dean. Gabriel had never even met Dean so Castiel had to admit that maybe he wasn’t as subtle as he thought he was. He couldn’t deny it. And he knew going into this that there was a chance that nothing would ever come of it. If Dean wasn’t interested in him as any other kind of partner, he would have to live with that. That all being said, desire sure was one hell of a motivator.
Castiel’s mouth twitched in a smile after he blew out the breath he’d been holding. He had no idea that three little words could be so exciting and so terrifying at the same time.
Never breaking eye contact, Dean slowly lowered his hand, his fingers skimming over Castiel’s body, until they found the hem of his shorts. He dipped a finger below the fabric, but didn’t go any further, giving Castiel the chance to pull away if he wanted. Castiel only continued to look up at him through dark lashes until he slowly nodded his head, urging Dean to press on. When Dean finally wrapped his fingers around his cock, Cas let out a loud sigh, threw his head back against Dean’s shoulder, his mouth open and eyes closed.
Twenty minutes later, he was changed and sitting on the polished wood floor. Dean sat a few feet away. They’d politely greeted each other, but there was a tension in the air. Right now, it seemed to come from Pam who stood over them with a raised brow and a stack of papers in her hand.
“It’s no wonder you’re sore, buddy,” he said with a false casualness. “You’re covered in knots back here. Can you sit?”
“Yeah, Dean’s been through a lot. I hate thinking he’s gotta wait another year to give it a go with the competition. Pam seemed to think they really had a chance,” she said with a sigh while reading the back cover of a memoir by Carrie Fisher. “I mean he’s at the studio every night, no matter what, for an hour after closing. Even on nights Lisa couldn’t make it, Dean was still rehearsing. I’m sure that won’t change anytime soon by the way,” she added, looking up at him with a smile, before wandering off into the science fiction aisle.
His focus shifted to the big heavy curtain leading to the main floor, where he could hear a funky, bluesy rock song playing.
“It’s pretty cool,” he commented, trying to sound casual.
Sam looked up from his laptop as Dean entered the kitchen. “Hey man, what are you up to,” Sam asked.
“Yes, please.”
“Yeah. I’m sure,” Cas replied shrugging his shoulders. “I rode up with you guys. Figure I’ll go back with the girls. And now you’ll have more space for the trophy,” he added, trying to keep his face from betraying him. “I’ll see you in a few days Dean.”
Trying to improve the uncomfortable atmosphere, the bar tender looks around the empty room and thinks about what she has just heard.  “You said most of the angels are dicks. So, that must mean that some of them are ok. There has to be a good angel out of all of them.” She pauses, looking hopeful. “Right?”
He didn’t know how long he stood there staring at the door, chewing on his bottom lip and dissecting pieces of their conversation. Charlie was a smart girl, but she was not very subtle. It was clear she came here with an ulterior motive. He didn't really pay much mind to that though, for his brain had just come up with an incredibly intriguing idea.
Castiel could recognize the red flags. Dean’s movements were quick and purposeful. “Good morning Dean,” Castiel replied. “Is everything okay?”
Castiel’s skill grew exponentially each week. Every time he mastered a new move, his face lit up with enthusiastic pride. The day he mastered his first inversion, he wrapped his arms around Dean and squeezed him tight, before quickly pulling away again. It did funny things to Dean’s insides.
“Dean, there’s someone here to see you,” Charlie said with an innocent smile.
Dean’s stomach answered for him with a rumble.
“Option two is where you pull on your big girl panties, and talk to him. Tell him what’s going on in that big head of yours. I’m not saying to declare your forever and undying love for the guy. But anything’s better than nothing. Hell, just ask the guy out. What’s the worst that could happen?”
“You brought me pie?”
“Good boy. Thank you for telling me to slow down. That would have ruined what else I have planned,” Dean said with a smirk.
“That’s gonna be so cheesy though,” Dean whined as they listened to the familiar song.
“Yeah. Probably explains why he’s such an asshole now,” Castiel added.
“So, how long has that been going on,” Sam asked with a raised brow.
Anna worked as a journalist for The Chronicle, a weekly print magazine that covered events, politics, and trends around Austin. Castiel was proud of his sister, even if he wasn’t proud of her ability to talk him into things he didn’t want to do.
Dean, quite familiar with that little flutter, squints his eyes and smirks at her. “He’s right behind me, isn’t he?”
“Because. Good things do happen, Dean.”
That night found them all scrunched together in a large booth at a bar a few blocks from the hotel. A few greasy appetizers were being shared and the beer flowed easily. Castiel could barely move where he sat squished between Dean and the wall, but he couldn’t find himself to care. It had been years since he could remember having this much fun with friends. He and Ishim certainly had never had nights out like this.
“Hello, Dean.” Dean’s eyes pop open. He barely heard Cas’ low voice over the sound of the shower. Dean pulls the shower curtain back before remembering he is naked, covered in bubbles with an errection now at full attention. Castiel is standing just outside the shower, fully dressed, trench coat and all. His lips part and his eyes move down Dean’s body. His gaze lingers a bit before slowy making its way back up to make eye contact with Dean. “Cas, what are you doing here? I thought you said it was a bad idea for you to be here,” Dean whispers, aware that his baby brother is still sitting on the other side of the bathroom door. “Last night, it was a bad idea. But I told you I would see you soon, Dean,” Cas answers in a hushed raspy voice, his mouth forming a lop-sided grin. His curiousity peaked, Dean asks “So what did you end up doing last night after you disappeared on me?” Castiel’s eyes move down again when he answers, “Research.” He shrugs the trench coat off his shoulders, letting it fall behind him. Despite the hot water, a shiver runs down Dean’s body. That familiar electric charge fills the space around them. “Research? What kind of research, Cas?” Dean asks quietly, bringing his hand back up to continue stroking himself, teasing Cas. “Different ways to love you Dean. Physically,” Cas says straightfaced. Dean swallows hard. “Cas, by research, do you mean…porn? Did you spend all night watching porn?” Cas simply nods and kicks off his dress shoes, followed by his socks. Dean blows out the breath he had been holding and closes his eyes. “Fuck,” Dean utters.
He helped Cas get his legs out from under him and massaged his calves for a moment while Cas squirmed and gently humped the mattress when the toy hit at a different angle in his new position.
“Dean,” Cas growled. “Dean, stop. It’s getting late. We shouldn’t do this tonight,” Cas whispered in between kisses.
“Are you going to fuck me now?” Castiel bent his knees up and spread his legs in offering, likely assuming Dean would remove the toy and bury himself inside instead.
“Mornin’ sunshine! You ready to show ‘em what we got?” Dean’s excitement was palpable as he bounced out of the car to open the trunk for Castiel’s duffle bag.
The bedroom door clicked shut and Cas turned to see Dean walking to his dresser, sipping from a rocks glass. Dean watched him, his eyes hungry as he mouthed a piece of ice, working it over with his tongue.
“Whatcha got there Cas?”
Castiel blushed. He had never considered himself to be an influential person. He stared at the neat stack of novels in front of him, his hands picking at them until they were completely aligned.
“Cas,“ he whined. “Cas, I’m not gonna last very long, Angel. You feel too damned good. I feel like I’m gonna explode,” Dean warned. Castiel squeezed the base of Dean’s cock and doubled his efforts. He sucked hard around the head, hollowed his cheeks and took him all the way down again until Dean could feel the back of his throat. Cas swallowed around him, making Dean cry out.
They’d been at it for a couple of hours when Pam announced she was officially done for the night. She disappeared to her back office for a few minutes and returned with her bag and a silver key that she pressed into Dean’s palm.
“You are too tempting, Siren,” he said with a grin. “I don’t think we should let this happen again though. Not like this,” he added after a pause. Cas peeled himself off Dean’s body, but stayed kneeling next to him. “It’s been a really good day, but I just don’t want a repeat of what happened last time. Tomorrow is too important, Dean. It’s everything we’ve been working toward. I mean, we’re so close to the finish line. I don’t want to lose focus now.”
“You’re welcome sweetie. You boys have a good night,” Pam said, already heading toward the door.
“Yeah, I can’t wait! You and the guys have always done your karate thing. Maybe this will be my thing,” Anna said with a hopeful smile. Over the years, Anna had many “things”. There were art classes, cooking workshops, and even a short-lived membership in an ax-throwing league last year. Nothing stuck. Even as a child, she managed to convince their father to let her quit the martial arts training her brothers had to attend.
“Best friend? Really? ‘Cause the last time I talked about someone like that,” she pauses cautiously, “I was in love.”
Dean gently tucked Cas’ softening cock back inside his shorts. While Dean’s dick was still rock hard and aching for release, a part of him was also perfectly happy to just sit here holding Cas while he came down from his orgasm. Cas finally opened his glossy blue eyes and looked up at Dean with a soft, satisfied grin.
Leave it to a bar tender offering free drinks to get Dean to start talking about his real feelings for Castiel. Dean should have realized, however, that Cas is listening.
Castiel pushed away the familiar emotions of rejection, desperate to fix this. Slowly, Castiel pulled the sheets away from him and stood up. He didn’t like having to have this conversation in only his underwear, but he wasn’t about to ask Dean to wait until he got dressed. He kept his voice steady.
“Wow, Dean, I’m so sorry. That’s more than any child should have to deal with,” Cas said.
The x rays of Lisa’s shoulder clearly showed a fractured clavicle. The ER doctor explained that it would heal on its own; there was no need for surgery. But it would still take months to heal. One thing was sure. Lisa couldn’t compete.
Dean knew his face was flushed, and it wasn’t because the room was too warm. Castiel fought to hold back a giggle.
Cas kept his eyes on Dean while he backed up until the mattress hit the back of his knees. He lowered himself gracefully onto Dean’s bed, resting his head on the pillow. Dean retrieved the cuffs from where he left them on the night stand and stood over Cas, taking a moment to admire the view.  His fingers were itching to touch, but Dean knew if he did, there would be no stopping and this whole thing would be over far too quickly. He wanted to make this good. Take his time. Play.
His phone buzzed with a message from Anna letting him know the shop had called. Her car was all done and ready for pick up.  Anxiety twisted Castiel’s stomach. If he had to drop Anna off to get her car, he would probably see Dean. As much as that thought excited him, the auto shop probably wasn’t the best place for the conversation Castiel wanted to have. His phone buzzed again, this time Anna letting him know that she was getting a ride with a coworker named Jeannine who worked in the photography department. He blew a chest full of air out of his mouth and forced his nerves to calm down. This gave him a little more time to figure out exactly what he was going to say when he did see Dean. And if Charlie was right about Dean’s practice schedule, he knew exactly where and when to find him.
