"Um...my father was abusive, alcoholic, terrible- when he was there, that is. He would hit me and Harry, and no one could help us because my mom had died of cancer when I was ten. We managed, Harry and I. We just had the usual beatings and fighting, and at least we were together."
John buried face in his hands, his shuttered eyes desperately holding back unshed tears and his shoulders quivering with, barely restrained sobs. He was angry and sad, so inexplicably sad. Angry that the one good thing in his life was also lying to him. Sad that not just their relationship, but also their friendship, had likely been all just an experiment.
Still panting hard, a giddy Sherlock opened the door of 221B for John in a rare, chivalrous gesture. John looked at him, surprised for only a second before they both burst into adrenaline-fueled giggles. John turned to hang up his coat, still chuckling, and Sherlock snuck a genuine grin at his back, the special one he reserved only for John, when he didn't know Sherlock was looking.
John stared at him, waiting for a response. Sherlock remained quiet, though his thoughts were racing.
"Don't you think sometimes that Freak is just messing with John? That he really doesn't care about him that much?"
Ella had been right. Yes, John had trust issues, but they were obviously for good reason. He should have just ignored her and continued not trusting anyone. He found he couldn't trust anybody, anymore.
John turned around and just looked at Sherlock. Just drank in his tall form, shining in the moonlight.
"It went further to shit when Harry came out. Actually, when she was caught with one of her string of 'girlfriends'. He... he was always extraordinarily homophobic, and he screamed at her to get out of his house along with her 'fag'- so she did. I was only sixteen, and I was so scared to be left alone with him. She didn't even look back at me, she just left."
Finally, John continued. "I couldn't move. He took a ruler off his desk and started slapping me hard with it, on the bum. Then he threw the ruler away and shoved me against a wall, really fast. His lips were on mine before I knew what was happening.
He had just had his own reservations, hadn't he? He knew it had been too good to be true. That Sherlock never did anything romantic or even affectionate, always just physical. He was more rude to him than before they were 'dating', and seemed never to care for John's moods. He knew he hadn't signed up for a regular boyfriend when he happily agreed to Sherlock's surprising proposal- but he also knew that there was something lacking. It hurt so much, that Sherlock didn't deem him worthy enough to be with him properly.
Sherlock tried really hard to reply that it was ok, it was all right, he could tell it was not directed towards him, but he was finding it quite difficult to speak at the moment, so all he could manage was a reassuring, if a little pained, smile. He truly was sure John hadn't meant any of that, especially now that they were lovers- it was probably some soldier reflex, though he had caught the "I'm not letting you touch me again"... His heart sank as he thought of what that could possibly mean, but filed it away for a later time. He first had to make sure John didn't think he was taking this to heart. Though it did hurt like hell.
"Jesus, Sherlock, you literally said the same thing when we were playing Cluedo that one time! Hypocrite much?" John smirked at him, bad mood from the previous day completely evaporated. Sherlock had indeed taken him out to dinner, cleaned up the corpse, and even eaten something, without John having to ask him to! The move, whether intended for John or not, had made him immediately forget his grievances. So Sherlock was not always the best boyfriend. That was to be expected- he never even took care of himself, so how could John expect him to care for another? It was ok. John was sure that Sherlock cared for him, in his own, special, way.
He inhaled sharply- this was obviously much worse than just reflexes, if it was affecting John so much as to make him cry. He never cried.
Sherlock saw John's confused look, but gained some confidence when he saw it turn into one of attraction (widening pupils, hitched, faster breath, trembly knees)- or so he thought. His heart beating at the speed of light, he slowed his pace as he came within a mere five inches of John's quivering lips. Trying with all his might not to betray his immense excitement, he languidly reached a hand up and placed it on the wall over John's head, bracing himself. He threw on a sexy smile, one he knew worked wonders on the ladies (always good for manipulation, they actually thought he cared) and used his other hand to tilt John's chin up towards him. He relished their height difference, loving the feel of towering over John, of John looking up at him with dancing eyes. He leaned down and before he could think anything else, he kissed John.
John let out a humorless snort. Donovan was right. He would follow Sherlock to hell and back- even if it was just John's personal hell. He wanted Sherlock to be happy, no matter how broken he was himself. He was inconsequential. Sherlock, on the other hand, was everything. He was the world's everything, his own everything... John's everything.
"I had these lights put up for you. I was going to tell you- tell you today, that I love you. But you'd already come here, of your own volition."
At risk of sounding stupidly sentimental, (who cares, you've already made an absolute fool of yourself today), Sherlock felt complete. That was it. He and John both melted into the kiss, forgetting all of the years they had lost, all the heartbreak they had put each other through, all of the misunderstandings, and just losing themselves in the other.
"He ordered me to turn around. He used his belt to tie my hands to his desk. And he did it. He called me a sl*t, a useless waste of space, a failure of a man, a- a- f***."
"Shut up, John, and let me kiss you. You looked so hot in there, I couldn't think of anything else. That must be why I was wrong. I can't stop wanting you, and it's messing up my brain process."
When they got back much later, having caught the criminal with relative ease, Sherlock was on FIRE, on top of the world. He felt that nothing could stop him now. As he watched John remove his coat, he was struck by how soft his blond-grey hair looked even when slightly sweaty, and how genuine his laugh sounded, and how much he wanted to be the one to make John laugh and forgot all his worries. He was slightly sickened at how sentimental he sounded, but found he gave not one sh*t. He felt exhilarated, on top of the world, in love-
So maybe his own tendency to keep to himself had disguised the fact that John wasn't comfortable touching others as well. He had just assumed that all the times John shied away from Sherlock's (or anyone's) touch, it was out of respect for Sherlock's aversion.
And stayed frozen. Sherlock was no expert on kissing but he was sure that John was supposed to have kissed him back by now. Maybe he's so happy I'm finally kissing him, his overanalyzing brain happily supplied. Yes, that must be it. He resumed kissing John, hoping against hope for a reaction.
"Sherlock." John was smiling full force now, and Sherlock didn't know how to get the rambling to stop.
John leaned into the kiss, fully participating now, not able to get enough Sherlock. What the man lacked in relationship skills, he sure made up for with amazing kissing abilities. They were both moaning now, skin heating up at the contact, at the searing kiss. Sherlock did a thing with his tongue that had him seeing stars.
He never really cared for John's moods, or showed much concern when he was sick or injured. He never asked about his day, or just give John a hug. Nope, none of the normal stuff.
A still shivering John grabbed at the wall and stood up. He slowly started backing away, like a trapped animal, clutching at the walls, the railing, anything, as he tried to get as far away from Sherlock as possible. He picked up the pace, all the while staring at Sherlock with a trembling, broken face full of raw fear. Sherlock's heart shattered again, for the second time that night, at the sight of that expression, directed at him. John then abruptly turned and fled to his room, stumbling on the seventh step, and slammed the door.
Sherlock would kill the man responsible. He knew he was right about this, and he would find him, and kill him.
He ordered me to touch him as he smashed his tongue into my mouth. He licked my face and humped against me, him fully dressed, me fully naked. He noticed that I was crying and- and- bit my shoulder, hard, and told me to stop. So I stopped."
Sherlock had no sense of personal space, for sure, but that was when it came to other people. He resented hugs or any such physical show of affection, and avoided human contact like the plague, unless necessary for exploitation, of course.
He had made a grave mistake. Of that much, he knew. He had read the signs all wrong; he should have known that John had not been exhibiting the signs of attraction, but rather, fear. He pretended he couldn't hear the muffled whimpers floating out of John's room down into the sitting room, where Sherlock was frantically pacing. He had hurt John, and John would never talk to him again. And Sherlock didn't even known why.
Sherlock wanted so badly to tell him that he was more than just useful to Sherlock- he was all that was important to Sherlock. Not only that, but he had saved so many lives, so many times, including Sherlock's own. John's impact on the world, despite his humbleness, were much bigger than he could think. He just needed to be reminded of that, maybe. But Sherlock was still fiercely proud of John, that in his darkest moments he had been so selfless. Always so selfless, my John.
On some logical plane he knew he might be overreacting- this was coming from Anderson and Donovan, after all. He hated himself for placing doubt in Sherlock, for not believing that Sherlock had a heart. Sherlock had initiated their relationship. Had said that he had always liked John, and wanted to try this out. But he couldn't shake the thought that it was true.
John spoke again, in a hoarse whisper. "We were in Afghanistan. I had just joined the ranks, and he was my superior. I had no family, and not many friends. My sister had just passed away after two years in an alcoholic coma, so I was feeling that my medical education was of no use if I couldn't have saved her. So I enlisted in the military so I didn't feel so useless."
“Shh, love. It’s alright,” John soothed, his hand back on Sherlock’s head. “I know you’re in pain… it’s going to be alright.”
John forced a smile and brushed a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead. “I don’t want to forget it. I feel so bad…”
Sherlock screamed loudly when the pan struck the intruder’s head. He ducked behind the curtains and peered out. The intruder lay still on the floor, completely unconscious. Redbeard crawled out from under the bed and hesitantly approached the prone form. Summoning up his courage, Sherlock gripped the pan in both hands and followed Redbeard’s lead. “Oh god… what am I doing?” he muttered, reaching out and poking the stranger’s head with the pan. There was no response.
The Crown of the Lost Prince lay on a velvet cushion atop a marble column in the sacred throne room of the palace. The Crown was a simple yet beautiful design of silver and gold twisted together with tiny diamonds. When the sun reflected off of it, it was as if hundreds of tiny rainbows were dancing on the walls and floors. The Crown was kept under heavy guard and only the King and Queen were allowed to touch the valuable heirloom. They often came to the throne room to gaze at the crown and feel connected to their lost son.
To celebrate his birth, the King and Queen and their elder son, Prince Mycroft, launched a flying lantern into the sky. For that one moment, everything was perfect. And then, the moment ended.
“I will,” John whispered, leaning down to press passionate kisses to Sherlock’s neck and cheeks. His cock was straining in its denim prison, aching to be released, and he reached down to unzip his jeans. His massive cock flopped out and bobbed, pre-cum dripping onto Sherlock’s concave stomach. The omega lifted his hips again, rutting against John’s cock and the ex-soldier moaned as intense pleasure rippled through his body. “God… Sherlock… you’re so… so perfect,” he breathed in Sherlock’s ear before pressing his lips to the omega’s beautiful, plump mouth.
The next thing he knew, a wet tongue was sticking in his ear and he realized that he had been knocked out again. He butted heads with the big red dog beside him. “Would you stop that?”
Another thing that had happened was John took Sherlock to St. Bart’s Hospital to visit a friend-Mike Stamford. Mike had exclaimed over Sherlock, complimenting how healthy and fine he looked. “I can’t believe what you did, John Watson. He looks like a whole other person,” Mike whispered to John.
“Pot pie,” John replied, peering at Sherlock’s reddening finger. It was not blistering, which was good. “It’s really good. Thick, warm crust. Baked chicken. Vegetables like peas and carrots. All simmered in a thick sauce. Here, come sit down, and you can try some.”
“That’s all for now,” Mrs. Hudson announced. “You can explore the bag. Enjoy the dessert. I have to go but I’ll be back up to check on you boys tomorrow. Sleep well.” She gave John a motherly kiss then wrapped Sherlock in a warm embrace. He hugged her back and she patted his cheek before departing.
“Kid? You okay?” Ace asked with concern. He cleared his throat awkwardly upon noticing that Sherlock was beginning to cry. “You know… I can’t help but notice, you seem a little at war with yourself here. I’m picking up bits and pieces. Sort of a protective parent, forbidden road trip. This is serious stuff. But-” here he paused and patted Sherlock amiably on the back- “let me ease your conscience. This is part of growing up. A little rebellion, a little adventure. That’s good, healthy even.”
With the sounds of horses and men behind him, Ace made a beeline for the tower. As there appeared to be no door or stairs, he began the arduous climb up the sides of the tower. Thankfully, there were plenty of ledges for him to cling too and he reached the window in no time. Cautiously peering inside, he discovered that the tower appeared to be lived in. There was a bed with rumpled sheets and several books strewn out on the floor. A table near the window contained what appeared to be beakers and a microscope. The walls were covered with mathematical equations and scientific calculations. His eyes wary, Ace climbed in and gazed about the room. “Hello?”
Mrs. Hudson stood up, dabbing at her mouth with a napkin.. “I’ll clear the table and wash the dishes for you, John. Go put Sherlock to bed. He looks like he needs the rest.” She kissed Sherlock’s curly head, patted his hand, and started to take the dishes off the table. Sherlock watched her, his eyes glowing with absolute affection.
Ace suddenly felt a tap on his shoulder. He whirled around and saw the concert pianist man. He gestured to a hatch in the floor. “Go on, live your dream,” he whispered with a tender smile that didn’t seem to fit his grotesque features.
Gently, John brushed the dark curls out of the omega’s eyes. “You’ve got beautiful eyes, lovely,” he told the boy.
John scrutinized Sherlock for a few moments then nodded. “We’ll take them, then. I’m sure it’ll take you a while to get used to them. That’s how it is with new shoes.” After Sherlock took off the shoes, John put them back in the box.
“Really?” Sherlock, in his excitement, smashed the pan against Ace’s temple, sending the man sprawling to the floor. “Oops!”
Sherlock desperately wanted to trust him. With all his heart. He could sense no malice or ill-will in John but it could be a trick. No. It’s best he didn’t trust John. He didn’t want to be hurt all over again.
Tilting back his head, Sherlock let out a pleasured scream as he came.. Pearly, white ropes of semen flew out, spattering John’s chest and stomach. His body was tingling all over; his hands had gone numb from the sensation. It felt  like hours. He kept ejaculating, spilling his seed all over John and the bedsheets. When his balls were dry, they retracted painfully and Sherlock whimpered at the loss of sensation. “Oh… Jawn…” That was probably the most intense orgasm he had ever experienced and it was brought on out of his own free will-not someone forcing him to it.
“SHERLOCK!” he burst out, his voice sounding so angry and his eyes dark. “H-How dare you!” He strode towards Sherlock, his hand raised.
John felt tears coming to his own eyes and he quickly brushed them away. “Love… I promise, I’m not like the others. I will never hurt you. I only want to care for you and love you… I know you don’t believe me but I hope… god, I hope that one day you will. It’s going to take some time, love. Take all the time you need.” He laid his hand atop the silky curls and traced the boy’s cheekbones with his other hand. “I’ll be here for you.”
"I was beginning to really like the man, as more than my superior. I could almost call it love. One day, he called me into his office. He said he was going to talk to me about a promotion."
He asked again, gentler, almost in a whisper, "How did it happen?" He turned around and saw John staring at him, cocooned in all of his blankets, with only his eyes peeking out, on the bed.
"Please, John. This is me you're trying to fool here. That 'smile' is even more obvious than a frown. I do notice, John."
He would have just walked on, but then he heard what they were saying and froze in his tracks, just barely able to see the three drinking coffee.
He knew John was blocking the door, so he waited for what seemed like hours until he heard John inevitably get up and stumble to his bed. He heard a rustling, and then silence- a long silence.
"Anyway, since then I haven't been able to get close to a man. I couldn't believe that the first guy I almost fell for could hurt me in such a way, so now I freak out at any male romantic touch. I don't know anymore. Even if I want to be with someone that way, I can't."
How much ever John wanted Sherlock right now, this was getting out of hand. John grabbed Sherlock's shoulders, partly to push him away, partly to support himself, as his knees were going weak. He succeeded in separating himself from Sherlock by just a fraction of an inch.
John had experienced a traumatic sexual assault, and he couldn't have men to touch him. Sherlock, in his own selfish intentions and having stupidly not noticed, had triggered a flashback, effectively unraveling all the years of care John had taken to hide his secret and protect himself through isolation.
Finally, when Sherlock was able to take a breath without it feeling like a lorry fell on his midsection, he said in a low voice, "John, it's quite ok. Really. I don't think any less of you, I'm sure you were just reacting on your amazing reflexes."
Sherlock's face immediately reddened, and he gave an embarrassed shrug, looking anywhere but at John. "I was just so happy and excited that I was finally able to hug and kiss you, like I've wanted to do for years. You looked so incredibly cute, swaying your hips and singing while cooking in the kitchen. I- you were too irresistible."
But the second his hand touched John's arm, John visibly jumped and receded, recoiled further into his own skin. The small man became even smaller. What struck Sherlock was how he didn't even try to fight back- John was helpless. He went silent at the touch, with a sharp gasp, and Sherlock was momentarily able to breathe again, thinking John had snapped out of it- but then John looked up into Sherlock's eyes with the expression of a victim who knows he is going to die, and whispered, "No, please."
Sherlock proceeded to have a mental short circuit, and John just chuckled fondly. Lestrade looked over fondly at their banter, not even attempting to hide the wide grin on his face.
If an experiment was all he was to Sherlock... well, so be it. How much ever he had always hated those experiments, those pointless, annoying, take-up-all-of-Sherlock's-time, more-interesting-than-John experiments, how much ever he wanted to curl into a ball and never come out of it again, he would be for Sherlock what Sherlock wanted him to be.
Sherlock panicked. He didn't know what to make of the situation, didn't know if John really hated Sherlock this much, didn't know how to help John, didn't know, didn't know, didn't KNOW. Sherlock wanted to comfort John again, but he understood that for some reason John didn't want Sherlock to touch him, so he didn't. John was still whispering, pleading.
Dimmock laughed uncomfortably. "Yeah, I do get that feeling. I mean, Sherlock Holmes in a relationship? Like, did you see how he just abandoned Watson back there? How he just drags him all over the place, and the poor guy doesn't even notice that he's just the lovesick sidekick who's being strung along."
"You surprised me from behind, and... " He took a deep breath, as if steeling himself. His hands clenched a few times, almost of their own volition, and after a few moments of tension, in which Sherlock was more unsure than he had ever been in his life, John spoke in a quiet, resolved tone.
Sherlock eased open the door of their flat, intent on surprising John, who he could hear humming and puttering about in the kitchen.
Well, that worked. The word vomit immediately stopped, replaced by complete silence. Sherlock's eyes were glued to John's as he watched the older man shift closer and turn around to face Sherlock. They were mere inches apart, and Sherlock couldn't think just from the proximity.
He considered just asking Sherlock about it. That would be the logical course of action. Maybe then he would debunk all of this, scold John for actually believing Anderson, and get the hell on with it. But John didn't think he could take it if Sherlock didn't refute it. His heart was tearing in two at the mere thought.
He couldn't help it. He really couldn't. John had to know how he felt. And he had to know how John really felt. Before he could think about all the things that could possibly go wrong (there were many), he took a deep breath, and strode over to John, who started slowly turning around at the sound of swift footsteps.
John barely realized that they were leaving the break room, and with what was left of his brain, he quietly moved back into the main corridor. He refused to think about anything.
Sherlock listened with eager but anxious anticipation. John had never really told him the details of his time abroad before, saying that it was "a bit not good", so Sherlock had let it be. John had seemed happy to be with Sherlock, but besides the occasional nightmare, he never saw evidence that John's army days could still be haunting him.
John absorbed that, and then burst out giggling, which set Sherlock's heart on fire, which mad him giggle, and then they were both laughing their guts out. It felt so damn good and he never wanted this feeling to end. Hopefully, that is possible now with all those pesky misunderstandings out of the way.
As Sherlock dug through his mind palace for more evidence, starting from when they had first met years before, he found that John had always actively gone out of his way to avoid any kind of contact with another human. He would make contact with people only when absolutely necessary, and always kept to a personal bubble of at minimum two feet. He had avoided hugging even the few people he trusted (Lestrade had tried many times, and Sherlock once, when he was really drunk). Sherlock remembered now that on every such occasion, John's eyes would widen, he would step back, and politely smile, giving some excuse, like "I'm a military man, you know me, I'll probably accidentally decapitate you." Sherlock had noticed how fishy that sounded even then, but had instead wallowed in his perceived rejection (he was drunk, he was allowed). No touch from anyone, then, romantic or not.
John continued, "I quickly rose to the top of my troop. Sholto"- and here John hiccuped- "Sh-Sholto would smile at me often, and encourage me, and try to talk to me. He never did that with the other soldiers, and it made me feel special. I was sure I was straight, but day by day, and sexy smile by sexy smile, I began to doubt that."
In the moonlit glow on cold spring evening, John sat down next to Sherlock and proceeded to have the best meal of his entire life, with the best person in his life.
Why keep it secret? Of course. It was with a man. Whether or not John was bisexual, he had always stood so staunchly behind his straightness, and couldn't admit that it was with a guy. He felt ashamed. Ashamed that it was a man. Ashamed that his soldier instincts had failed him when it mattered. Ashamed that he was weak, and tainted, and...
Sherlock took a lap of faith and brushed his hand over the only visible part of John's body, his cheek. He gently cupped it in his palm.
At that, John looked up- and Sherlock was shocked beyond words to find that John's eyes were glistening.
Sherlock froze in place, careful not to make any sudden movements, lest he scare John and lose the small trust he had gained.
Sherlock then heard a sound he would never forget, one that made him back up immediately: John sobbed. Sherlock had never seen John cry before- he assumed that he rarely cried, and if he ever did, he certainly never let Sherlock see him. So the fact that John had let a sob rip through his body, was in fact continuing to cry and shake behind his hands, meant either he didn't recognize that Sherlock was there, or he didn't care. Most likely the latter. John fell to the floor in the fetal position, head to his knees, breaths coming fast and hard, like he was hyperventilating.
Sherlock was scared, so scared, but he didn't let this dash his hopes. He had to be strong for John. So he just told him the truth, plain and simple.
Now that he had figured it out, he had a more important task at hand: John. His brain, heart, and blood cried out for John. Screw his selfish emotions, he just wanted John to be happy. He just wanted to hold him and tell him it was OK, that he was here for him. But how could he if John was scared of his touch?
Sherlock gaped at him, mouth closing and opening like a fish. How can he possibly think this is his fault?!
Once out of Lestrade's office, Sherlock briskly dragged John into the nearest empty corridor and pushed his back roughly against the wall. Sherlock's lips were on John's before he even had time to ask what he was doing.
John hated himself, in that moment, for having let Sherlock be the one person he trusted. The one person he could love. The one person that had saved him. The one person he could be Johnwith. The one person he allowed himself to rely on. The one person with him he felt something akin to lov-
He deposited Sherlock on the couch in the living room, and then sank with his head in hands into his own armchair. Neither spoke for many minutes- John because his world had crashed down around him, and Sherlock because it hurt too much.
John kept up his steady stream of whispered "All my faults", each of which caused Sherlock's heart to clench painfully. But he kept quiet.
"John, you are my best friend, and much of what you just said to me, I feel towards you twice as much. You are invaluable to me." As I told you yesterday, he thought but didn't voice. Though he hated redundancy, it was always nice to hear John tell him these wonderful things he never thought anyone would say to him.
John felt tears spill and nodded his head. Of course he denies it. He squished down the little smidge of hope that he had just been overreacting that had arisen at his words. Instead, he opted for anger. His jaw clenched, he he stared resolutely at the ground.
He slowly sat down on the bed and scooched over until he was sitting across from a still cocooned John, making sure to maintain eye contact with him the whole time. John tensed slightly, but didn't protest.
"Whatever. I warned John. The man's a freak, and Watson's stupid to have ever believed his feelings could be returned." Donovan shrugged, already bored by the topic. "Anderson, meet me in 30 in my office to discuss that case?" A none-too-discreet pointed look was sent in Anderson's direction.
Sherlock ran a hand under his shirt, the fingers of the other hand brushing the raised scar tissue on his shoulder. John shuddered in response to the stimulation. And John suddenly found he didn't care.
Sherlock just marveled at John's idiocy. Coming out after getting together? New low, John, new low. Even for you.
John had had his doubts, of course. Never about Sherlock's capacity to love, no, always doubts of his own worth, his worth to someone as independent, and beautiful, and brilliant as Sherlock. Sometimes he just couldn't understand why Sherlock even kept him around, let alone be his boyfriend.
They both stepped into each other's embrace, just happy to hold each other. Glad that it really was love, one that would never stop. John was the happiest he had ever been in his life. A stray tear dripped onto Sherlock's hand, where it was cupping John's cheek. He looked straight at John, and then kissed the tear on his hand. It was such a powerful gesture that John's heart stuttered, and his knees trembled. He had to clutch Sherlock for support. He's showing me that he will try to be better.
"Sherlock, I- what do you mean? I feel fine, just- just took a walk, that's all. We can go home now, if you want. I'll make you the thing with the peas." A brittle laugh that fell far short of its mark. A feeble attempt at normalcy. I will be what he wants me to be.
As soon as he had surprised John from behind, John had froze for just a fraction of a second before reaching behind, grabbing Sherlock's torso and throwing him over his shoulder, as if he weighed nothing (kind of true, given how little he ate). With a vicious, sub-sonic voice that was the most dangerous sound Sherlock had ever heard, he growled, "Get off! Right now! I'm not letting you ever touch me again!" And then proceeded to pummel the living daylights out of Sherlock, who was too shocked (and in pain) to move.
"God, I- I'm so sorry Sherlock. I'm so, so sorry. This isn't the first time I've beat you up, and none of them were actually your fault."
John didn't know whether he should be affronted or amused. He settled on a little of both and was about to snap back a biting retort when Sherlock physically shook his head and strode over to John. He grabbed his hand and basically dragged him towards the door, stopping for only a second to filch the necessary files from the still-open file cabinet. He threw a cheeky smirk over his shoulder at a spluttering Lestrade, then pulled John out the door. John just sighed resignedly and let himself be pulled along, muttering an apology (that he didn't really feel at the moment) to Lestrade on the way.
"He grabbed my hair and forced himself into my mouth. He was moaning and I was trying hard not to cry or scream. Then-then-"
Sherlock groaned in anger and pounded a fist into the arm of John's chair. He seethed. John was a better than a great man, he was a good one, and Sherlock loved him, and he wanted to protect him from whatever this was caused by (even though that was silly, this had happened before they met), and he didn't. deserve. this. Not his John.
"I entered the room and closed the door behind me, excited for a promotion, and maybe to see if the feelings were mutual. In an odd voice, he told me to lock the door. Even though I was confused as to why that was necessary, I shrugged it off and did so.
"Ok, I never wanted to have to tell anyone this, but I think you deserve an explanation after the right arse that I've been to you."
John grinned that one-sided smile back, but it quickly faded. He drew in a deep breath, then started, hesitantly at first.
His heart broke for John yet again, the largest in a series of rips Sherlock wasn't sure his self-proclaimed tiny heart could handle- after all, his heart was John.
He fought the urge to run up to John's room and break down the door and ask for forgiveness and ask what's wrong and just hold him and kiss him and-
They were both high off the thrill of a chase, a fully satisfactory, honest-to-god chase, complete with guns and jumping across buildings and tripping over cats (John would never let Sherlock live that one down). Sherlock had been itching to get out of the house for days; his annoying little feelings for John had been driving him insane, and he desperately needed a case to distract himself from the John invading his brain, the John he had to constantly remind himself he could never have, not in that way.
"John. What's wrong?" A low, deep, voice, the one he would never tire of hearing, from next to him on the bench.
"John. I have always been there. I will always be there. I will always hold you, whether or not you need it. I love you, John, and nothing will ever change that."
"But just know that I'm so grateful- you don't know how grateful- that you will always be my best friend, no matter- no matter how much I hurt you, and I'll be happy to even be just a small part of your life. So happy."
Then he leaned forward and kissed John, gently cupping his face in his large hands. John's eyes flew closed, but he couldn't stop the anguished sob that flew out of his mouth. He couldn't stop his hands from flying out and pushing Sherlock away, though his lips and brain and heart wanted to be even closer to Sherlock. He couldn't stop the tears that rolled down his cheeks, unable to stay within their confines.
Sherlock inwardly sighed- it wasn't fair that they'd just started their relationship and already John was too scared to be close to Sherlock.
"I noticed you were cold, earlier. Take my coat." He draped his wonderfully warm, wonderfully Sherlock coat around John's shoulders, who immediately sighed in pleasure.
John decided not to try and follow Sherlock. He had made his dramatic exit, and was probably off somewhere doing who knows what. Besides, John wanted to stop by Tesco's later. It was hell of a lot easier without Sherlock. And he had only just gotten over his earlier mortification- he didn't want to be seen in public with Sherlock just yet. Who knew how fast gossip spread around here?
Sherlock had never noticed. He scoffed at himself. How had he missed it, after being his best friend for years? And with his brain?
Sherlock took a second to get over his shock that John loved him. And then he took another second to wonder how the hell perfect John could love someone as flawed as Sherlock. He then had a second of doubt, that John was joking, but quickly dismissed that, given John's state. No not a situation to joke. And then he was grateful. So grateful. He loved John more than he ever had in that moment- even during the worst moments in life, he had selflessly decided to give his life to others. Even after Sherlock had made him re experience the worst pain of his life, he still cared about Sherlock. Loved him, even.
Sherlock had deduced this about John in their early days together- though it pained him that John had had a tough childhood and was still so blase about it, as if it was normal. But John never mentioned his family, so neither did Sherlock. It was the least he could do- so he went after his middle name instead.
Then only did he notice the other details that had escaped him earlier, or that he had selectively left out, in his singular goal of kissing John, and in the brief mental short circuit afterwards. That John was clutching the wall behind him as if wanting to melt into it, as if it was the only thing holding him up. That John was drawing fast, laboured breaths that were not of arousal, and that his eyes were jumping and his legs were shaking, but definitely not of arousal. That John was whimpering.
"Must I repeat myself? I thought you were cute," he muttered, still embarrassed at having been caught feeling... sentiment.
Actually, scratch that. Not just contact with any other human- now that he thought about it, he seemed to only have such a reaction with males. John had gone out and presumably touched a number of females since knowing Sherlock (though notably none of those 'relationships' had worked out), so he was obviously fine with women touching him. But he hadn't seen him ever go near, much less make contact with, a single person of the male gender.
"But also for someone who says they like me how could you not notice that I WAS GONE FOR A BLOODY WEEK! A WEEK, SHERLOCK! What the actual HELL?!"
Finally he got off of me, and untied me so I could put my clothes on before someone could walk into his room to find a naked guy and start suspecting. He zipped up his pants, raked his eyes over my body with a triumphant grin, and left the room without another word.
With the biggest grin on his face, he exclaimed, "John, you idiot. You absolute idiot. I've always told you that you're too stupid for your own good. I just tried to kiss you today! I've wanted to do that since you killed that cabbie for me! Can't you see, I love you John! I caused all this today because I love you!"
"I actually tried to end it all. Right then. I put my clothes back on and thought about showering, to die clean, but decided it didn't matter, that I would never be clean again. So I took the belt he had left, and tied a noose from the ceiling fan, right there in his room. It seemed fitting to die in the domain of the person who had conquered me, with his belt."
Sherlock held him until his cries subsided. Until there was only silence, just their two heartbeats, each taking strength in the other.
I couldn't even think to react. He told me to take my shirt off, so I did. He told me to take my pants off, so I did. It was like he had some weird power over me; I had to obey. He watched, sneering, the whole time. He then walked up to me."
"Don't hide it, Sherlock. Why else would you want me around? I heard Anderson, Donovan, and Dimmock talking about us. They said that I'm just an experiment to you. That you kiss me and treat me to gather data. Like with your parents. Or Jeannette. Like one of your experiments. I- Sherlock, if that's the case, I'm sorry for messing up your data. But I'm not like you, I'm weak- I can't hold back my emotions. I do truly like you as more than a friend, and if all I am is an experiment to you, I will stay and be that, because I'm weak and I need you. Just- forget this happened and we can go back to normal. Or, if you are done with your experiment, then we can just go back to being 'friends', if- if- that was even real too." Tears streaming from tightly shut eyes, leaving tracks.
Lestrade laughed. "The office pool. I bet that you two would finally get together in January- Anderson actually fell for your "I'm not gay" crap! Hah- the fool." Ignoring an offended squawk from both Anderson and John, he continued, "I knew since I met you. So, thanks for the 100 pounds." He turned back around to his file cabinets, acting like he was reaching in to check that the case files Sherlock needed were still there, but really just concealing a wicked grin, knowing that he had likely just broken John.
But he didn't care, because despite his tremendous pain caused by John's pain, he was happier beyond his capability, happier than he had ever been.
And then he realized that he actually couldn't believe it, that this was the ultimate test, the final part of Sherlock's twisted experiment, to drive a wedge in his heart and twist it, to destroy John. He couldn't even be angry at Sherlock. He hurt so much, but he just stood up, ready to go back home. But a hand on his wrist stopped him.
"I- I saw you cry. I don't like it when you cry, I care about you. You know this isn't really my area, John. Please tell me what's wrong. Did someone do something to you? Tell me, I'll find them and hurt them."
Sherlock drew a quiet, cleansing breath and turned the doorknob. As he entered, he didn't even look at John, in case it would scare him again. He was sure John was awake (he was good at differentiating sleep breathing, and furthermore knew that John didn't sleep when upset).
I know I am. Why do you love me? This is a trick, one of your experiments. I know it is. This was a mistake. I knew I shouldn't let you touch me! You're just like them, like him! I'm all alone, and I can't! Sherlock, I can't! I can't, I can't!
"I- uh, yesterday, we confessed our feelings to each other, or rather I confessed my love for you, and we agreed to partake in a sexual and romantic relationship... you didn't object, so I assumed that I was free to..."
A carefully measured breath. A fluttering opening of eyes. A large, glaringly fake smile plastered across his face. He won't notice.
Sherlock immediately opened his mouth to protest that frankly ridiculous notion, but John shook his head and cut in before he could get in a word. "No- I know you'll say that you will never hate me, or that I'm entitled, or some bullshit like that, but I know that I've messed up so many times in the past, and I always blamed you and put you through so much pain unfairly. Let me take the blame now."
"I love you, John. I've been so scared that we would fall apart, that I would lose you, lose this beautiful thing we have, even lose our friendship, if I told you. I've never had something so amazing, never deserved it. I still don't. I somehow got you, and I never wanted to let you go, I was scared that I would mess up something. I want to say 'don't be an idiot for trusting Anderson, for god sakes', but he was right, in a way. I was severely lacking on my part, and just kept taking without giving back. I had never felt anything so strong for anybody, and that scared me. I'm so sorry that I couldn't give you the attention and love you needed, but I just didn't know how. If I knew that you didn't like my experiments, I would have stopped a long time ago. You will never be an experiment to me, John. You are special, and I can't live without you. I've loved you from the day we met. I- I love you."
"Yes, that's it, you misheard, John, you're really getting old, I clearly thought you had come back early, you know how my mind palace is, I get lost it in it, and I was just telling you to bring me those ginger nuts from the bakery, why would I "confess my love for you" or some nonsense like that, I was merely-"
As hard as it was to accept that, Sherlock reluctantly closed his mouth, knowing from past experience when John talked this much he needed to just speak, much like when he was confessing to cheating on Mary.
Sherlock didn't think he'd ever been this happy. If this was what just a taste of life 'with' John Watson was, he wanted, and could have, the full nine-course meal.
Looking back at the next few seconds, Sherlock should've known that he was coming on too strong, too fast, and furthermore from behind- John was not a touchy person, and he still might not have been over that shock of actually getting to be in relationship with The Sherlock Holmes. And he was soldier- his reflexes were beyond fast.
“Same here, Watson,” Trevor replied jovially. His eyes darted from John’s cane to the young omega clinging to the army doctor’s side. “Who’s this?”
“I-I don’t wanna go back,” he sobbed, his thin frame shuddering with each sob. “Please… Jawn… I’m sorry… I-I’m so so sorry...Please… forgive me… I didn’t mean it… I didn’t mean it at all!”
The next moment, gentle fingers carded through his curls and he heard John saying, “Sherlock? Are you alright?”
“Sherlock, darling, look at the mirror,” Father interrupted, gathering Sherlock into his arms. “You know what I see? I see a confident, strong, handsome young man! And… oh! Look! You’re here too. Oh darling, I’m just teasing! Stop taking everything so seriously!” Moriaty slapped his thigh as he doubled over with laughter. Sherlock watched, stone-faced, unable to understand what was so hilariously funny.
The omega turned over, whimpering suddenly, forehead wrinkling. Pale hands tossed the blanket off and plush lips parted to let out pitiful whines.
Both the handler and the beta woman looked at him with surprise. “But sir! This one… he’s already been… I mean, he’s not a virgin. He’s disobedient, clingy, and he cries all the time. He’s going to be put down; he’s so much trouble. Surely you don’t want him! We can find a much better one for you to purchase,” the beta woman interjected quickly.
“Ah, yes, we’d like to buy this collar, please,” John answered politely and gestured for Sherlock to hand it over.
The ride home was quite uneventful but when John and the omega got out on Baker Street, the cabbie grinned and said, “If you ever want to rent him out, here’s my number.” He offered John a scrap of paper  but the blond alpha growled menacingly.
Reassured, the omega relaxed against John. “I just…. Well, you are tanned… your face is, at least, but not above the wrists and…” He scrunched his nose up in a manner John found rather cute. “Also, the way you carry yourself-shoulders back, hands in fists at your side, steady, rhythmic walk-and your short haircut, clear signs of military background…” He looked hesitant to go on but John merely nodded and the omega continued, gaining confidence with each word he blurtted out. “Also, the way you treated my wounds… you have practiced hands. You performed a full examination on me. So, you were an army doctor. Also, your limp, it’s at least partly psychosomatic because it’s really bad when you walk but when you stand, it doesn’t seem to bother you-as if you’ve forgotten all about it. Probably the original injury was traumatic… wounded in action….. Afghanistan.  You’ve probably got a therapist as well.”
“Oh, Trevor!!” he exclaimed, smiling. “It’s been a while since I last saw you!  Three week, hasn’t it?”
Tossing Mike a warning glare, John slowly knelt down, so as not to frighten the omega,  and tenderly cupped the boy’s chin in his hand. “Hey lovely,” he said gently, running his fingers over the pallid, withdrawn cheeks. At his touch, the omega flinched, his captivating eyes closing tight. “Oh, lovely, it’s alright, I’m not going to hurt you. Please, won’t you look at me?”
“You’re right. I don’t want to either but he’s so thin and he told me the House only fed him when they remembered.” John walked over to the couch and laid a hand on the omega’s thin shoulder. Sherlock didn’t move, his breath coming in steady little gasps. He made the most adorable sigh and rolled over to face John, eyelids fluttering. “He looks like an angel,” John thought to himself, his heart nearly bursting with love for this tiny creature. Gently, he shook Sherlock’s shoulder. “Love, it’s time to get up. It’s supper. Would you like to eat something?”
“Oh, no, no! This is bad! This is very, very bad! This is really bad!” Ace cried, clutching the wanted poster in his hand. “They just can’t get my nose right!” Once again, a very poorly talented artist had made Ace’s nose two sizes too big. Unfortunately, no one could seem to get his face right.
Sherlock drewin a deep breath and offered John a shaky, yet genuine smile. . “It’s…. I mean, I’m finding it’s always alright when you’re here, Jawn.”
Moriaty threw back his head and laughed. “Oh, you mean the stars, don’t you, darling? Well, you could just look out the window. You don’t need to go anywhere.”
After getting up and manuevering her way through the boxes littered on the floor, she leads them through a rusty door into a long, low, dim room crowded with wire cages. Omegas of every shape and size and sex and age filled the cages, crammed in so that they were pressing against the wire.  The room was deathly quiet, except for the whines of a few pups, who were snuggled up at their mothers’ sides. It smelled horrifically, almost overwhelming the strong scent of omegas in heat. John frowned when he saw the squalid conditions the omegas must live in. The poor creatures were all terribly thin, bones jutting out and faces drawn and pinched with hunger. Some were standing in their own waste, hopeless faces showing their surrender to the miserable life they lead. A few extended their hands, pleading at John with their eyes, begging him to take them away from this horrible place. John avoided their gazes, too ashamed with himself.
John’s eyes widened with gratitude. “Thank you so much, Mrs. Hudson. Please, stay and eat it with us. Sherlock and I won’t be able to eat the whole thing by ourselves.”
John’s stomach clenched painfully at the boy’s pitiful expression and he reached out, engulfing the boy in his strong arms. “Shhh… love, no, you don’t have to apologize,” he whispered, nuzzling the boy’s neck despite himself.  “I don’t like that ‘master’ stuff. Would you call me ‘John’ please?”
His heart pounding, Sherlock kowtowed, just like he’d been taught ever since he was merely a pup. “Master….Jawn… I’m very sorry for yelling at you. I have no excuse. Please forgive me,” he whispered almost robotically.
The omega sat straight up, nearly bonking John on the chin with his head. “Sherlock? S..Sherlock?  I…. I think I can remember that name… my mother gave it to me…. I had forgotten it!” Eyes bright with tears, the omega threw his arms around John’s neck and hugged him tightly. “Thank you Jawn… thank you so much!”
A male voice broke through Sherlock’s flashback. He opened his eyes and stared into the menacing blue orbs of an alpha male.
Sherlock himself was weeping but begging all at the same time, arms flailing and hole clenching tight around John’s cock. “God… yes… yes…”
Sherlock willingly opened his mouth, allowing John to stick his tongue in and explore. His breath was coming in short pants and gasps and he latched onto John’s hair, actually pulling him towards him.
“Shut up,” the alpha snapped and he threw the collar as hard and as far as he could. Sherlock watched it sail through the air, the moonlight glinting off the pretty silver buckle and the sapphire shining like a star against the black of the sky. For some reason, it was almost as if a part of him had gone flying away with his collar. Now that the collar was taken care of, the alpha turned to Sherlock and grinned, eyes glittering with anticipation. “I’m going to fuck you raw,” he warned, then threw back his head and laughed like a maniac.
“How much it costs doesn’t matter, John,” Mrs. Hudson replied with a dismissive wave. She handed the coat to Sherlock, who took it from her and ran his hand over the collar. “Isn’t it handsome? I think it will look very good on you. Oh, I’ve got one more thing for you too.” Again, she reached into the bag and this time, pulled out a long, navy-blue scarf, which she proceeded to wrap loosely around Sherlock’s neck. “Now you’ve got a proper coat and a proper scarf for winter.”
No, wait! This man.. He was talking away one of Sherlock’s most precious belongings! The beautiful collar that John had bought for him… that showed that Sherlock was John’s. Desperately, he lunged forward to grab it. “Give it back! Please!” he cried, hating how small and weak he sounded. “Please… sir… please…”
Sherlock let out a moan as John sunk his teeth into his neck, their scents mingling together and becoming one. “Yes… I’m yours,” Sherlock whispered and cupped John’s chin, craning his neck to kiss his alpha. John pulled away from Sherlock’s neck and dark blood trickled down the skin, yet Sherlock felt no pain. Only blissful, sweet pleasure. He was John’s and only John’s and the feeling of belonging to John sent ripples of pleasure down his spine. “Oh god… I’m going to… please… master… Jawn… I.. I need to…” His cock twitched painfully and Sherlock bit his lip hard.
“I’ll just shorten it, Jawn, because it’s kind of long and boring…. Your brother probably recently left his wife and gave the phone to you so that you could keep in touch. However, the relationship between you two must not be close because you haven’t gone to live with him. So, perhaps you don’t like his drinking habits-”
“God…. Sherlock,” John exclaims, realizing instantly what must be happening. “You’re….  You’re in heat!”
They returned to the front desk, where the woman handed John a small, cardboard box and a clipboard with several papers on it to sign. “Just sign here and here and here,” she gestures, “then you’re free to go. Here is its file. All necessary information is in there: past owners, past bonds… etc etc etc. The box has its things in it. Old owner gave it some gifts. It also has a GPS tracker in its neck. I’ll update that one and we can link your email with it, if you’ll just put it down on the papers.” She handed John a pen.
John watched her go, then went back into the living room, where he settled himself on an armchair across from the couch. The omega was scrunched into a tiny ball, his nose buried in the blanket John had given him. His eyes were closed and his breathing was steady and even. He was asleep and John was glad. The poor boy needed all the rest he could get. There was something endearing about the way the omega sniffed and his nose wriggled as he slept and John couldn’t help but get up and brush the pale forehead with a kiss.
“God… GO! Leave me alone, Jawn! I don’t want you! I don’t want you at all!” Sherlock screamed, tears running down his cheeks like rivers. Again, visions flash before his eyes: John mounting him, taking him, and breeding him. Pain. Blood. Tears. “STOP IT!” he screamed at the top of his lungs, grabbing fistfuls of his dark curls and yanking. “No… no… please!”
“It’s just part of being an omega… you’re not as human as the others. Besides, I deserved my punishments… I was a bad slave.” The boy sounded so sad and so resigned that John engulfed him in another hug.
“No, Jawn… please! Don’t! I don’t want to see you blaming yourself! I don’t want to see you sad!” Sherlock cried, trying to sit up so that he could hug the distressed alpha. John gently pushed him back down but Sherlock’s hand remained in his. “Don’t like to see you like this, Jawn..”
“Oh. um…  Hey… Mrs. Hudson,” John said  quickly, noticing the fear on his omega’s face. Quickly, he walked over to the boy and picked him up. The omega quickly settled on his hip, clinging to John’s sweater and eyeing Mrs. Hudson warily. “This is… well, I call him ‘love’... He doesn’t know his real name. He’s my omega.” His omega’s grip tightened on John and he stroked the dark curls, trying to calm the boy. “Shhh, love, this is Mrs. Hudson. She is very kind… and likes to think that she is my mother. But, she’s really just my housekeeper.”
Sherlock, eyes bulging and lungs burning for air, nodded vigorously. “Y-yes… M-Master,” he gasped out, clawing at Moran’s hands. No one cares about you… no one cares about you… no one ever will care about you….
For a moment, John was lost in the kiss, reveling in Sherlock’s touch. God, those lips…. Then, he realized, as he was about to return the kiss, what was happening. He stepped back, startled, feeling arousal swell up within once again.  “S-Sherlock!” he gasped, rubbing his cheek where the boy had kissed him. He felt his cheeks start to go warm.
“Shut up!” Sherlock growled, clutching his pan close. What was this strange hot feeling in the pit of his stomach and what was that? Were his cheeks turning red? Redbeard wagged his tail knowingly and Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Stop it, Redbeard.” He glazed back down at the stranger and saw that the man’s eyes were open. Panicking, he raised the pan and brought it back down on the man’s head. Redbeard worriedly whined and licked the man. “He’s a bad guy, Redbeard, until proven innocent. We need to restrain him.” Seeing a chair nearby, Sherlock had an idea.
“O-Of course, sir,” the handler said before the woman could say another word. “He’ll be going for 500. He’s not exactly the cheapest on the market but he’s not exactly the most expensive. He’s pretty, so I suppose that makes up for the loss of his virginity. I’ll even throw in the cage.”
When he got to the kitchen, he discovered that Moriaty had already eaten-the remains of an apple and some bread crumbs were on the table. Redbeard immediately put his two front paws up on the table and licked up the scraps while Sherlock rummaged around in the pantry for oatmeal. “I hope Father goes shopping soon. We’re running out of flour and other things,” he remarked, pulling the bucket of oats out of the pantry and setting it on the table.
There was suddenly  a knock at the door, rousing the two from their embrace, and John jumped up, nearly upsetting the small omega. Mrs. Hudson walked in, singing cheerfully. She was  carrying several grocery bags and John gratefully realized that she must have gone shopping for him. The older beta woman stopped in her tracks when she caught a glimpse of the tiny omega sitting in the middle of the parlor. However, the lock of shock on her face quickly disappeared, replaced with a kind, grandmotherly expression. “And who is this little one?” she asked, setting the bags down on the floor.
Sherlock pulled on the coat. It hung a little off his skinny frame but if he keeps eating, he’ll fit into it soon enough. The sleeves came right down to his wrists and when he buttoned it up, John couldn’t help but whistle. The coat was stunning on Sherlock. It really brought out the unusual colouring of his eyes and it went well with his head of dark curls. “You look beautiful, love,” John said before he could stop himself.
“Have another one,” John said, picking up the omega’s file, which he had forgotten about until now. He opened the file and began to read, glancing occasionally down at the omega in his lap, who was contently munching on another biscuit.
The alpha was young, perhaps in his early twenties, and he was horny. Sherlock could tell by his scent that the alpha was aroused. An omega male was truly a treat, especially for a young, horny alpha male. Nearing Sherlock, he surveyed his prize, eyes glittering and mouth nearly drooling. “You’re not bonded, are you, little bitch?” he asked, his voice raspy.
“Darling,” John began carefully, trying to keep the excitement out of his voice, “you are not yet fully healed and I do not want to do anything to hurt you.”
“Move, slut,” one of the men says, grabbing Sherlock by the collar and yanking him roughly out of the way, choking him in the process. Sherlock hits the side of the cage and lets out a panicked yelp. The pain, however, is quickly forgotten when he sees the other men grabbing his pups, who are screaming at the top of their lungs.
After waiting for a while, making sure that John nor Mrs. Hudson would enter the flat, Sherlock scurried away to collect his ingredients.
Trevor raised his eyebrows as he eyed the black leather band around Sherlock’s slender neck.  “I thought you were against slavery, John. Looks like you’ve turned hypocrite and gone against your own word. But who am I to judge? He’s a pretty one, even though he’s as thin as a stick. Have you had a chance to use him yet? Is he any good?” The smaller alpha licked his lips, inhaling Sherlock’s sweet scent.
Sherlock turned off the water and slowly took a seat, gazing at his piece of pie. He picked up the fork with both hands and turned it over, his attention caught by his reflection in the gleamed metal. John, realizing that the poor boy had probably never held a utensil before, stood over Sherlock and gently guided his hand into the correct position. “See, you stab the food with the prongs and lift it up to your mouth. Good! Just like that! Wait, blow on it first. I don’t want your lips to get burned.” Sherlock drew in a deep breath of hair, his cheeks bulging slightly, and blew.  Chicken, peas, and carrots flew across the room and spattered on the wall.
“Jawn… oh Jawn!” Sherlock cried and buried his face in the alpha’s chest. “Why do you say such beautiful and wonderful things? I don’t… I don’t know exactly what they all mean because no one has ever told me those things before! Every person before you has called me horrible things but you, you Jawn, you call me things that send thrills down my spine and fills me with warmth! I can’t understand it… I just can’t!”
“Listen to me, Sherlock. You are beautiful both inside and out! You are like a flower, just waiting to blossom. I look at you and I see your heart. You are a beautiful innocent, with a heart of gold that has been crushed over and over. I want to fix your heart, Sherlock. But I’m not that kind of doctor. I just… I just want to fix things for you but I can’t. The only thing that I can do is remind you over and over how special and how beautiful and how perfect you are!”
“Yes love,” John replied, relieved that the boy seemed to be alright. He ran a hand through the curls and kissed the sweaty brow. “How do you feel?”
“No, no, this is being mean, Dimmock Come on! Like old times, huh? Let bygones be bygones!” John quickly said, his face flushing.
But the men pay no attention. They slam the cage shut and walk off, arms full of wriggling, crying pups. Sherlock presses himself against the bars, screaming at the top of his lungs, dizzy with pain and blinded with fierce anger. He knows it is no use but he keeps calling for his pups until his throat is sore and all his tears have dried up.
Sherlock sniffled and buried his head in John’s chest. “I… I love you, Jawn. I really and truly love you. More than anything in this world.”
Sherlock sagged in relief, grateful that Mrs. Hudson wasn’t too angry. “Alright. I think there’s some in here somewhere.” He bent down and picked up the beakers. “Will the black spot come off the floor?”
Mike had introduced Sherlock to Molly Hooper, a pathologist who worked in the morgue. To both Mike and John’s surprise, Sherlock had shown interest in Molly’s morbid job and had especially exclaimed over the very expensive and up-to-date lab equipment that the morgue sported. Molly had promised Sherlock he could come back and they had left the hospital, feeling very satisfied. John was happy because Sherlock was coming more and more out of his shell and Sherlock was happy because Molly had told him he could help her examine bodies whenever he wanted to.
The boy looked startled. “Lanterns!!! I knew they weren’t stars. Father was wrong and on several accounts. He has a lot to answer for. Well, anyway, tomorrow evening, they will light the night sky with these.. Lanterns. You will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely. Then… and only then..” Here, the boy paused to waggle the pan threateningly in Ace’s face.. “Will I return your satchel to you. That is my deal.” He stepped back and crossed his arms over his chest, looking triumphant.
“But trust me when I tell you this: You can tear this tower apart, brick by brick, but without my help, you will never find your precious satchel.”
A look of horror came over Sherlock’s face. “I-I’m so sorry, master! Please… I didn’t…. I wasn’t…” Breaking off in frightened sobs, he fell to his knees and kowtowed submissively at John’s feet. Slender hands wrapped around John’s ankles and a curly head bumped gently against his pant leg. “I’m sorry, Jawn… I wasn’t thinking. Punish me, please… I didn’t mean to upset you.”
His words were cut off as Moran backhanded him across the face. “Quiet, bitch. Your only purpose is to be my personal fuck-hole.  I have forbidden you to speak without permission and without me directly speaking to you. There will be no supper for you tonight as punishment. Perhaps you will finally learn to be good!” Moran looked at him with such condescending pity and Sherlock choked back a sob. “You never try hard enough, darling. You’re never good enough! I’m so good to you and yet you repay me with your sullenness and your whining!”
John sank back into his chair and let out a decidedly sad huff. After four days with no sleep, running around after Sherlock on a case, then a trying day at the surgery (a child had died), and then a terrible commute home, Sherlock wasn't even paying attention to him! He looked up, hoping Sherlock would notice his mood and bloody just ask him what was wrong, but no, Sherlock Holmes just didn't do things like that, did he? What were his exact words? "John, I guess since we're a couple now, I'll buy you dinner every other Saturday. Let me know if you will be requiring more from our relationship. Though to be honest I don't see it being much different than before. We just kiss more."
He looked at Sherlock, as if asking for permission to sit next to him on the couch- it broke Sherlock's heart that he felt like he was such a danger to Sherlock that he couldn't sit next to him. He nodded and smiled as reassuringly as he could. John tentatively sat down, almost at the other end of the couch.
He ran a shaky hand through his curls, grabbing a fistful and pulling hard on his scalp. He needed the pain, to set his mind straight and force him to think, think about how to fix this seemingly un-fixable situation; forget furthering their relationship, he had small hope that he could even salvage it.
"I'm so happy, Sherlock. I've wanted you since I met you, but I was just too damn scared of people like my father, so I've been firmly in the closet. I know it's ridiculous, not everyone is like that, but- I almost died that day, and I just couldn't for all these years. Anyway, I never thought in a million years you would return the feeling, and while I'm chuffed you do, I can barely comprehend it now."
John croaked out, "No, Sherlock. Of course it's not your fault. Don't ever say that- I will never forgive you if you say anything bad about yourself again. I've blamed you so many times before, and it was never you, and it never will be you."
He vowed to himself to figure it out, though- if not for the sake of his friend, then selfishly for his own need for his friend, and even more selfishly for the blow his ego was taking at not understanding why.
John took a deep, shuddering breath here, on the verge of tears again. Sherlock quelled his instinct to reach out to John, knowing he would continue on his time. He was hating this with all his heart, but at the same time desperate for John to continue, to hear about this monster did to John.
John glared at Sherlock's rear end from his chair, and then, no less disgruntled, stood up and handed Sherlock the lighter. Sherlock didn't even look at him, let alone thank him, and went about setting the body on fire.
He thought about calling Molly or Lestrade- usually John would know what to do in emotional situations like these, but... duh. He grimaced- John was a private man already, and wouldn't want his breakdown today known to anyone in anyway. Even Sherlock felt like he had crossed boundaries, seeing John so broken like that.
Anderson poked in, placing his coffee cup on the counter. "No, you know what? He's probably not even horny. You know how he's always doing those morbid side projects. Maybe John's just one of his experiments. The sick bastard's giving Watson the time of his life, and then probably cataloging every one of his reactions in that 'mind palace' of his, in the name of science. I might have been wrong about them getting together, but I just KNOW that I'm right about this."
Sherlock was taking deep, pained breaths at this point. He clenched his fists and gritted his teeth. He couldn't understand how someone could do this to John, to John.
"But I stopped myself. It had finally dawned on me that I was a soldier. I would fight. Even if I couldn't find a reason to live for myself, I vowed to make my life useful to someone else."
He stumbled back against the counter, taking shaky breaths. He seemed about to bolt from the room, when he remembered that Sherlock had just taken a major beating. Sherlock thought for a moment that he might just freak out and leave, but he practically saw John's doctor side coming out.
He had lit up like a Christmas tree when Lestrade had knocked on their door with a positive cornucopia of cases to be solved. Pleased to see that John looked equally excited to finally have a case, he had grabbed his Belstaff and favorite blue scarf, and brushed past Lestrade with a muttered "Thank you, Geoff." Lestrade had been so surprised that he had actually gotten a 'thank you' out of the detective that he almost didn't mind the butchered name. He and John just exchanged surprised smirks, and then John left the flat right on Sherlock's heels, eager for a good case, hopefully one with a chase.
John hadn't been there. That's why he didn't answer. I confessed my love and I assumed he was there and I thought it was a yes but he WASN'T THERE and OH MY GOD I JUST TOLD HIM NOW and THIS WASN'T HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO and OH SHIT SHIT SHIT SHIT back out Holmes back out RIGHT NOW
“Well… this is your new home. I haven’t got an extra bedroom but you can sleep right here on the couch if you want too… or I’ve got a sleeping bag we can put in my room, if that’s what you’d like. I’ve got some blankets and pillows hiding around here I can get for you.” John picked up the tv remote, which had fallen to the floor, and set it on the table. The omega watched him silently, wary eyes following his every move.
That was when Sherlock realized that John’s face was spattered with blood-the blood of his would-be rapist. John had shot the man to protect Sherlock? An omega slave wasn’t a big loss. John could have just walked away. But he’d come back… even after Sherlock had been terribly rude to him and John had saved him. “Jawn… You were just in time… you saved me, Jawn.”
The omega whimpered in fear, pulling the blanket over his head, and John quickly regretted his outburst. He rubbed the omega’s head. “Love, I’m not mad at you… I just… no… no, love, I-I would never do that to you without your consent. That’s inhumane and cruel….I didn’t buy you because I needed a sex slave…. I bought you because….” Well, John honestly didn’t know why he had bought the young omega. Was it the pitiful state the boy was in that brought out John’s compassionate heart? Or was it how the omega looked at him with those dazzling eyes, so full of confusion, sorrow, and fear? John took a deep breath. “I bought you because I needed…. I needed a friend.” This last word was whispered but the omega caught it.
Oh, you see that old man, over there? You might want to remember him. He’s kind of important. His name is Jim Moriaty and he is the adviser to the king of a great kingdom. Moriaty had earned the king’s trust over the years, and the king started handing more and more of his royal duties over to Moriaty. Everyone in the kingdom feared Moriaty but the king did not see through to the man’s evil heart.
John’s eyes widened and his heart warmed at this little affirmation of trust-no matter how small that trust may be. He wrapped his arm around the small boy, gently squeezing him. “I’m glad, love. I’m really glad.” His heart skipped a beat when the omega, hesitantly nevertheless, rubbed against him, nuzzling his neck, dark curls brushing against John’s chin.
The omega refused to sit down on the chair John had offered him and John didn’t want him kneeling on the floor, so the omega ended up on John’s lap, curly head pressed against John’s chest and thin hands gripping John’s fingers. “Mrs. Hudson makes the best biscuits,” John told the omega, picking up one of the sweets and offering it to the boy. To his surprise, the omega pressed his lips together and turned his head away. “Come on, love, what’s the matter? Aren’t you hungry?”
“Hey…. You deserve all the compliments I give you and more, love. Hopefully I can make up for all those years you went without. Now, come on. Let’s make your bed.”
“But I’m still here, Jawn,” Sherlock whispered, every breath making his chest ache. “I’m still here.”
An hour later, John left the flat, dressed in a freshly-ironed suit jacket and pants. He fussed over Sherlock until the omega had practically pushed him out the door, promising John that he would be perfectly fine. When John was gone, Sherlock looked around the flat and almost smiled. He was alone… and it was a perfect time to try an experiment. Unbeknownst to Molly, Sherlock had snitched some charcoal, sulphur, and potassium nitrate from the lab, which he had carefully concealed in some of his clothes. He’d read, somewhere, he couldn’t remember where, that if you mixed these three elements, you would create a powder that would explode upon contact with a flame.
"...and therefore, John, I see it fit that we be together romantically, physically, and whatever other way there is possible. I want it, and you haven't objected, so I'm assuming we're on the same page? Yes. Partners in every sense of the word."
Sherlock held John, as John cried. He just held him in his arms, with John's face buried in his chest and his legs in Sherlock's lap, and allowed John to cry away his pain.
"He came up from behind me, and I guess he must have seen what I was looking at, because I didn't notice until he had already clouted me on the head. I was dizzy, and too scared to defend myself. He threw punch after punch, kick after kick, until all I could see was the blood dripping down my eyes. He continuously yelled "fag", and "disgusting", and other slurs until I felt like throwing up, both from pain and nausea. I was sure I had at least a concussion, a few broken ribs, and a broken leg. Luckily, he was so drunk that he passed out, and I called 999. I don't know how I survived."
"NO, IT'S NOT OK!" John leaped up from his chair and came to stand in front of Sherlock, who couldn't help it- he winced.
Sherlock crossed his legs, looked up with an eyebrow cocked up, and patted the space next to him. "It is Saturday, after all."
Bells were ringing, all right. Ringing in Sherlock's ears. A dull roar washed over Sherlock's brain as he put two and two together in a spectacularly slow ten seconds.
When he saw the look on Sherlock's face, John croaked out, "Yeah, surprise, I am actually gay. Who woulda thunk?"
"I'm fine, now at least. I was disgusted with myself for not being able to defend myself against my own father, so I joined the army. I had no money or shelter anyway, thought I might earn the money to go to med school. I've gotten past it. But I guess because you sneaked up on me from behind, some memory was triggered and I just lost it. I really apologize again, Sherlock, I'm so sorry. Everything's always my fault."
"Sherlock. I wasn't here yesterday. I was in Dorset for a bloody week, remember? Came back just a few hours ago... ringing any bells?"
Before he understood why John was afraid, Sherlock acted on a protective instinct and cautiously approached John with a hand stretched towards his arm, to figure out what had hurt or scared him so. He couldn't bear to see John like this, and vowed to kill whoever was the cause.
"It hurt. It hurt so much. Physically, it hurt more than getting shot. I'd never been with a man before, never tried anything like that, and I wasn't prepared. And I didn't want to. I felt so violated. I hated him in that moment, hated that he had control over me, but I hated myself more, for not being able to fight back. I know it was all my fault."
A single tear escaped the restraints of his shuttered eyelids and found its solitary way down the cheek of the most lonely man in existence.
"It was probably all my fault- I shouldn't have sneaked up on you like that. It would surprise anyone."
And then, as if John had read his mind, something Sherlock always seemed to do to John instead, John softly laughed and said, "That's you, you idiot."
...No, duh, John, last time I checked, me and you are both males, and thus we agreed to be in homosexual relationship just yesterday... Sherlock proceeded to give the most incredulous look at John, who was nervously awaiting a response from Sherlock.
"You don't have to," said Sherlock, softly, and for the first time since John had started his story.
As he slinked with catlike grace towards John, who was currently chopping something, with his back turned to the door, completely unawares, Sherlock smiled with the memory of the previous night's much-awaited conversation.
He decided that he needed to confront him, tonight. Tomorrow, John would ignore him as if nothing had happened, and he couldn't live knowing the pain John hid in his heart. He loved John too much for that. No, he would make this better for John, no matter how much it made John hate him, and he would do it in the only way he knew how- talk to him as they had for years, as the best of friends.
"I only ever see them kissing. Holmes is probably just horny all the time, 'cos who in their right mind would want him, and saw no one better than the one person who actually trusts him to take advantage of. Easy pickings, John is- he's like a dog, always loyal to the freak. Would probably follow him to hell and back and never know it."
He resumed his pacing, adequately frantic this time, as he often did when he was on the trail of something, something big.
John continued in a whisper. "I hated hated knowing that this man had been inside me in every way possible. In my brain, in my mouth, inside me, everywhere. I just couldn't- I was weak. And I broke down on his carpet. I begged him to stop. But he ignored me and kept violating me, this time with me on the floor. I was shaking and it just wouldn't stop and I wanted to die.
He helped Sherlock up from the floor, slinging a long arm over his shoulders (Sherlock couldn't help but wince at the irony of it all, even as he relished the touch- a few minutes ago, he had been slung over these same shoulders so violently, and now it was with the utmost care).
John, a pretty observant man, did not miss this and immediately retreated, clenching his fists together as he did whenever he was angry. Angry at himself, Sherlock presumed. God, how he wanted to soothe him, and tell him it was alright. He didn't judge John. Stupid reflexes! He growled at his transport. Why did you have to go flinch and make him feel worse?!
“Me? Oh. Yeah. Fine. Gas leak, apparently.” Sherlock explained before turning his attention back to Mycroft. “I can’t.”
Several minutes later the war room table was cleared off except for the map and beers. Dean read off the incantation as Sam put a lighter to the corner of the parchment. It was quickly engulfed in flames and the brothers stood watching as the entire thing turned to ash. They exchanged confused looks. "I...guess there's no dragon skulls in the US?" Sam hypothesized. "Sammy, we're gonna need a bigger map." Dean grinned, proud of the reference he made.
"Naturally," John commented, as he put away the few groceries he had arrived with. "Need me to wear anything specific?"
The color drained slightly from Greg's face as his brain struggled to process the information. That could't be real, could it? How come he was only finding out about it now? Shouldn't he be required to know these things? How was he supposed to protect London if he didn't know about the added terrors lurking in the shadows? I mean, fuck, it was bad enough without the monsters.
"What in the bloody hell do think you're playing at? Do you have any idea who I am?!?" A gentleman with salt and pepper hair barked as he exited the sleek black car in the middle of the warehouse. The sound of the passenger door slamming echoed through the building. Anthea quickly and quietly guided him over in her bosses direction, before returning to the vehicle.
Lestrade stirred slightly with a small grunt of disapproval. One of his hands wrapped around John's waist, his subconscious not wanting to give up hold just yet.
Lestrade sat at his desk with his head in his hands. A sharp tapping sound, the tip of Mycroft's umbrella on his office door, alerted Greg to the eldest Holmes presence. The cop gave his face a thorough scrub with both hands before rising from his chair and allowing a warm smile to plaster itself on his face. "Mycroft." The D.I. said, low and soft. "It's good to see you. Sorry that it had to be under such unfortunate circumstances."
He was alone in the war room, leaned back in a chair with his feet up on the table and a beer in his hand, when the bunker door creaked open and Cas walked in. "There he is!" Dean announced, placing his feet back to the floor and smiling at his angel as he descended the staircase. "And with weapon in tow."
"...brother..." Greg said the word quietly and thoughtfully, like he was testing it out. "Alright." He stated, steeling himself a bit more and looking directly at the eldest Holmes brother. "What is it that you want to talk about?"
John sighed. He didn’t like the way Mycroft said that, and he can only be leading up to something dramatic. He tipped his head and raised a brow for the other man to continue with his theatrics.
Suddenly, the lightbulbs above the hunters began to blow out, shooting cascading showers of sparks. A shadowy figure, that Dean couldn't quite make out because of the fluctuation of light, sulked into the barn. The figure approached slowly but surely, walking right past all of the sigils and wardings that the hunters had laid for the being.
Greg nodded to Mycroft, signaling him to keep going. The hammer was drawn up again and then rendered the other knee useless. More blood. More screams. More pain.
“Gregory...” The detective’s chocolate brown eyes locked onto his and the rest of the sentence died in Mycroft’s throat. He found that he didn’t want to push Gregory away. Perhaps he did have some feelings on the matter, but Mycroft told himself it was because he was already worked up and was hoping for a release.
"Hello Dean." All of Dean's doubt left him when he heard the deep rich baritone. "C-Cas?" The hunter's voice broke along with the dam keeping his tears held back. He lifted a hand to the angel's face, needing to touch. To know that he was real. His hand cupped Cas' bearded jaw and it was solid. Dean's other hand came up to clasp a shoulder.
Another groan left him when he realized he wasn't alone. Lestrade was there, sitting on a bench opposite him, and he was staring intently at Sherlock.
“It’s not.” Greg snapped back. Mycroft gave up his right to care who he was sleeping with when he cut things off between them.
“Huh?” He said unintelligibly and dropped his hands. “Oh, uh, yes.” He answered before plopping down ungracefully into Sherlock’s armchair. (It was the closest.)
His gaze shifted over to John, and his voice became less stern. "I'm glad your both okay. Make sure he gets plenty of rest." With that, he excused himself.
"I found your list." The statement hung heavy in the air, because those four words told Sherlock an entire story. "You've met with my brother." It wasn't a question, just a deduction. Greg simply nodded. "You know, I didn't want to believe Mycroft when he told me you were an addict." The D.I. grimaced on the last word, then brought his left thumb up to scratch absently at an eyebrow. It was then that Sherlock noticed his other hand was occupied with a tiny plastic cup.
Then another thought struck him. “You’ve never felt bad about cheating before. What’s different now?” He inquired.
He did not have the luxury of indulging in feelings with his line of work. It's not that he was incapable, but he'd had a lifetime of practice keeping them at bay. Besides, the more space in his brain he dedicated to filling with facts and information, the less space he left for his heart and it's ridiculous whims. Therefore, it was Gregory that was worried about having feelings for Mycroft. Which most likely meant that he was already starting to develop those feelings.
Greg bit the inside of his cheek until he tasted blood. This new information seeped in like hypothermia, permeating his bones with an icy chill. She's been lying. He thought that she was honestly trying to fix things, but here was the proof that she wasn't. That she couldn't change. Maybe Greg couldn't change either.
After a few days of the brothers buried deep in research, Dean found something promising. He startled Sam out of his concentration when he hollered out, "Yes!" and slammed his fist down on the war room table. "Finally!"
"It's worth a shot." Dean nodded, a small smile forming on his face at Cas' sudden perkiness. "Let's go find him." The Winchester made to go off to gather his things, but Cas stopped him with a hand to his chest. "No. You stay here and locate the dragon skull. I'll go to hell and search for Hephaestas."
“Why not?” John inquired, his brows furrowed as he watched his friend. “I thought you’d be…flattered.”
”Oh please, Gregory. Don't be so dull. She’s off right now having an affair as we...speak.” Mycroft laid the last word on thick, a bit of a devilish look in his eyes. Gregory's face contorted into a grimace. Mycroft might as well have slapped him with the words. Despite this, he continued. “Which means that what’s actually changed is the way that you feel about our arrangement.”
Mycroft utilized a few seconds to internalize Greg's words. "I suppose you are correct, for the most part. However, Sherlock is a bit of a special case. And, again, his messes usually end up disrupting my most exceedingly crucial work. Not to mention, as with all addicts, he needs a bit more support to ensure that he's taking proper care of himself."
Sam leaned back into his seat and bit the inside of his bottom lip. "So, your boyfriend took off without you then?"
The Winchester brothers were sitting in leather armchairs, in the middle of confronting the newly found scribe of God.
He felt Dean's eyes follow the movement, so he glanced up to find the hunter now fixated on his mouth. The angel swallowed roughly. "Dean-" The name came out breathy and low. It wasn't even all the way across his lips before the hunter stole it from him, pressing their mouths together.
The memories from purgatory stung deep, bare to Dean's soul. The recent sightings of Cas had increased the frequency and the intensity of the flashbacks.
Sod this. Sod his reputation as a husband. It had been ruined long before today. As much as he didn't want a divorce, he couldn't live like this any longer.
As he leaned back he made sure to tell Cas, "You better come back in one piece or I'll kick your ass." Dean meant to sound serious, but he ended up just sounding worried instead.
By the time a bouncer arrived, Sherlock was very pleased with himself for causing such a perfect scene and distraction.
The next morning John awoke with a pain in his shoulder. He abruptly came back to reality when he realized that he wasn’t alone on Greg's sofa. They had both fallen asleep there while watching the telly last night.
“Look…” Greg started, raising his hands to gesture as he began to explain. “I’m not going to pretend that it wasn’t hotter than sin to see you in action today, Mycroft. But…” Greg let the sentence die off. He dropped his hands to his sides, and not knowing what else to do with them, shoved them into his pockets.
Cas leaned into the table and glared at his boyfriend. "Oh yeah. I'll just pop on down to hell and do some blacksmithing. Any other requests? Should I extract the iron for it from the blood of your enemies as well?"
“Good! That’s good, isn’t it? Well, with everything that you’ve tolerated so far, it seems that you will be continuing this…collaboration…with Sherlock.”
A hot shower, fresh change of clothes, and a spritz of cologne later, John returned to the living area.
"Speaking of." Dean interjected, bring his hand up and back down in a sort of patting manner on Cas' shoulder. "I found some old weaponry that I want you to check out. See if it's what we need for the heroes spell."
Greg looked up into his rear view mirror to glance at Sherlock, then nodded. He couldn't deny that that made perfect sense. He shut off the engine and sighed deeply. It had been a long day already, and it was about to get even longer. "I'm going to put you in a holding cell to finish riding out...whatever this is." Greg explained.
"Mycroft." It was spoken half way between a weak protest and longing plea. The detective made no attempt to move away, and so Mycroft began trailing kisses down the side of his neck. When he came upon his clothed shoulder he bit down over the fabric, drawing a light breathy moan from Gregory.
But it seemed like Sherlock had caught a scent, and if they were really pursuing a murderer, then John needed to have his wits about him.
"I have a feeling that you hold a much higher position in the government than you've lead on. With the way you just said that." Greg laughed cheekily. Then his demeanor turned serious as his gaze wondered ravenously along the length of Mycroft's lean body. "A true man of power." He mused. "I'm glad the responsibility falls on such deserving and capable shoulders."
Sherlock leaned into John’s touch and inhaled a whiff of very aroused alpha. He knew it wasn't John’s fault; his very strong scent, set off by his heat, was attracting John’s alpha instincts in ways the young man couldn’t resist. “No, I’m fine,” he whispered and pressed his body against John. Despite all his fears about being force-bonded, raped, and knotted, he found  himself drawn to the ex-soldier in ways he  can’t believe was possible. All his owners before had raped him during his heat and although his omega instincts have enjoyed it in a way, Sherlock had not. He had never felt a want for any of his owners… until now. Stupid fucking biology, he silently curses, pushing the urges out of his mind.
“Love, it’ll only be for a few minutes. It’ll be fine..” John gently pried Sherlock’s fingers from his hand and ran his hand through the dark curls once more. “Just relax love. Remember, I’m waiting for you when you get out.” Leaning down, he pressed a light kiss to Sherlock’s lips, then pulled away, looking worried and sad. “I love you, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s eyes brightened at the prospect of watching telly and he practically skipped into the living room. He froze for a moment when he reached the couch and glanced over his shoulder at John, silently asking permission to sit. When John nodded, he curled up on the couch and hugged one of the pillows to his chest.
“Let’s just turn around and you go home, and your dog. I get back my satchel. You get back a father-son relationship based on mutual trust and voila! We part ways as unlikely friends!”
“Oh… okay… I want to see the floating lights,” he burst out before his father could interrupt him with another ‘comedy’ session.
“Happiness,” Sherlock whispered, savoring the word. “I’ve never felt happiness before.” Fresh tears sprang into the omega’s beautiful eyes. “Oh Jawn…. Is happiness a good thing?”
Sherlock drew in a trembling breath and smiled weakly. “Okay… I don’t know where I am, and I need him to take me to see the lanterns, because I’ve been dreaming about them my entire life! Find your humanity! Haven’t any of you ever had a dream?”
Sherlock flushed, mortified. He’d forgotten. “Oh! Yes! Of course!” He shoved over a chair and pushed the hairbrush into Moriaty’s hands. “Flowergleamandglowletyourpowershinemaketheclockreversebringbackwhatoncewasmine,” he sang quickly as a startled Moriaty ran the brush through Sherlock’s tangled curls. So engrossed in getting the song over with that Sherlock did not notice the look of displeasure on his ‘ father’s’ face.
“Yes. Thank you for allowing me to sleep, Jawn.” He lifted his chin and sniffed the air. “What is that smell?”
“This is it. This is a very big day, Redbeard,” Sherlock said, glaring at his reflection in the mirror. “I’m finally going to do it. I’m going to ask him.” He squared his thin shoulders and lifted his chin. “I look more older and mature, don’t I, Redbeard?” he asked nervously.  Unhelpfully, Redbeard merely licked his master’s hand in response. Sherlock slumped. “Yeah, I look like a girl… a 12-year-old girl and not a 17-year-old-soon to be 18-boy.” Indeed, when he looked into the mirror, he saw a child much younger than he really was, with long black curls that cascaded down his shoulders to the floor and a too-thin nose and eyes that could pierce into your very soul. He was thin; his clothes hung off his frame like rags. He had a few freckles-the only color on his otherwise deathly pale face. There was nothing attractive or mature about him. He looked like a whore.
“No! Please, no!” Sherlock screams, jumping up and snapping ferociously at the men. “Don’t take them! Don’t take them!”
“Oh my lord,” Mrs. Hudson breathed, face turning pale, “the poor darling! Oh, John, you are the best thing to ever happen to him, I just know it! If you hadn’t come along, Lord knows what would have happened! You are a good man, John Watson. The best I’ve ever known and you are just what Sherlock needs. I saw how quickly he’d taken to you and I promise you he will come further out of his shell.”
