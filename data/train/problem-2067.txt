shattered?” she asked hopefully.  John glanced up at Sherlock who was inspecting an electric saw, used for cutting open the chest cavity, and turned it on by accident.  He dropped it, leaping backward, a vaguely panicked look on his face.  Molly winced as the blade broke when it hit the floor.  Sherlock caught the look on her face and immediately his face changed, from fearful, to guilty.  He picked up the saw, and set it back on the table.  The blade was perfect.  He stood away from the table.
Sherlock's head lolled against the pillow.  No control…and his wings, they were burning they were on fire and he was screaming again, flinging himself against the wall, he had to put out the fire.  Two angels were grabbing him, and he didn't know them and he panicked, striking out with feet and fists, though neither made much of an impact.  They wouldn't let him put out the fire, why wouldn't they let him….and then Mycroft was there with a hand on his neck, and then he could breathe again.  And Mycrofts' arms were around him and Sherlock sagged against his brother.
The feet all disappeared, though the stiletto stayed stuck, straight through his hand.  It shook, blood welling up, spilling to the floor.  The shoe was lifted, bringing his hand with it, and it might have slipped off, except a gloved hand grabbed the end of the heel, and yanked him up, hard, by the shoe.  He screamed again.  He was slammed backward into the wall, one of his wings getting slightly caught, bending painfully.  He panted, trying to get at least a little control back.    James grinned, running a finger along Sherlock’s jaw.  “Shh,” he whispered.  “That’s it.  Just….shh. Isn’t this nice?”  Sherlock glared.  Then, as the finger brushed his lips, bit it.  James yelled and slammed his injured hand into the wall, driving the shoe in clean to the bottom.
him there.  Mycfofts house was just…well.  It was big, and beautiful, and full of valuable things.  It was a lot like heaven, actually.  And very much not for him.  Baker Street was
Greg Lestrade and Sally Donovan met at Baker Street to discuss the journals two weeks after finding Sherlock.  They’d decided against pubs or anywhere public, based on the nature of the journals in question.  John let them in.  There was an air of…dread about the flat.  “I don’t really want to discuss what I read,” said John, suddenly.   “It was bad enough reading it once, and I’m not even finished.  I don’t need to read all of the journals.  And…I don’t need to know what yours said.”  Greg and Sally nodded.  Sally felt much the same way anyway, she was just glad that John had said it first.
John had been reading journals for nearly two months.   He felt sick.  He suddenly felt violently ill, and in fact, barely made it to the bathroom at all.
“What’s happened?  Are you alright?”  Stupid question.  He should ask where he was, but Sherlock was already answering.  “It’s…nothing.  Few broken bones, I think.  Cracked ribs?.  Burned…appendages.  I’ll be alright.  Well.  Presuming I don’t die of exposure.   The water….” And the smoke covered him again, dragging him away more roughly than before.
If people really want me to try and write a sexy chapter, I'll add ficlets to this universe.  More torture, more sex, more recovery or fluff...whatever people want.
that,” said Greg, furiously.  He had leapt to his feet.  John had automatically reached behind his back for the gun that wasn’t there anyway, and that he wasn't sure Greg even knew he had, considering just how illegal it was that he had it.
Sorry, bit anticlimactic, I know.  I just...don't like seeing the unfinished story sitting in my Works collection.  So.  Here I go.  Posting the story.
“I did,” said Sherlock calmly, shaking water off his hands and feet as he walked away from the pond.  “The water is…physical.  For the boy.”  It was the most Sherlock had said in a long time.  John found himself a little floored.  He hoped it meant that Sherlock would start speaking again.  It had been more than a year since he’d been back, and recovery seemed to be going slowly.  So he nodded slowly, though he wasn’t sure he understood.  Sherlock seemed to know this, because he sighed in exasperation.  He didn’t explain himself further, just started walking back to their shoes.  It had been enough of a walk for one day.
“Well…he did just determine everything wrong with the dead man.  And a few things that I don’t think had anything to do with the fact that he was dead.  Like…he was a gardener.  So, maybe he isn’t
“Right,” he said. “I understand.  But…” he swallowed.  “If he can fix ponds, can he fix people?”  John looked hopelessly at Sherlock.  Sherlock looked at the boy, and said nothing.  The boy continued anyway.  “I...my sister,” he said hesitantly, ignoring his friends calling for him to get his arse over to them with the bloody ball.  “She’s…dad says she’s sick.  And she prob’ly’ll die.”  Sherlock thought for a long moment.  Then he reached into his pocket, and pulled out an old vial.  A test tube, that must have been in this old coat for ages.  He filled it up with the water, and handed it to the boy.
“God Sherlock,” he whispered.  “I am so, so sorry.”  Sherlock didn’t answer, just tightened his own hands around John’s head, then looked to the bed again.  John swallowed, before carefully lifting Sherlock, under his knees and under his arms, and slowly standing and making his way to the bed, depositing Sherlock on it.  Sherlock stared at John again.  “I understand,” he murmured.  And he did.  Why that boy clicking his stick along the fence had set Sherlock off the way it had.  Normal things, taken and twisted and exaggerated, and most of them had meant pain.
Sherlock didn’t smile, but Lestrade thought maybe he saw a spark of amusement flick through his eyes.  He made his way back to the bed, and sat.  “That’s good, yeah?” asked Lestrade.  Sherlock had started studying the duvet intently.  John nodded.
Sally looked aghast.  “You steal bodies?” she asked.  “Sherlock’s…body has a family?  And he let it get tortured?”
It was too much all at once.  Sherlock blacked out.  He came to not long after, with Moriarty’s face just inches from his own, dropping the pipe that had been in his leg on the ground.  “No escaping that way Sherlock,” he chirped, almost pleasantly.  “That’s cheating.”  Sherlock growled at him.
watch.  Isda watched a few, but it wasn’t as necessary for her particular brand of healing.  Remliel and Sariel** both had to watch all the tapes as well.  To determine how best to heal Sherlock’s body and spirit, respectively.   Mycroft watched Sherlock.  The dreams seemed to be the worst.  Sherlock just kept screaming.  Sometimes Mycroft could calm him, sometimes he couldn’t, and it took the combined power of himself, Isda, and Sariel to calm him.
When he’d come to again, the wraith’s poison had all but left his system.  The screaming continued, but now he could tell it was on a loop.  Recordings.  Annoying, but the more he listened, the more he could tell that John hadn’t been in pain when he was yelling his name.  It was unlikely he was being tortured.  And the sounds were far too mechanical in the female’s scream as well.  No, his friends were not being tortured, not being hurt.  That relief even managed to carry him through the next several days, though the memories of killing his friends…and the others, remained very fresh in his mind.
Dina paused the tape again.  She wasn’t sure how much more of this she could take.  She would just make Mycroft take a turn, she thought.  It was only fair, she’d been watching these for a month now.  She’d watched seven months worth of footage.  She knew enough that she was aware of what was coming when the wraith attacked.  Sherlock didn’t say as much to James anymore.  He still spat biting comments at him sometimes, but a threat to John was enough to make him stop talking.
“No!” John yelled.  Or he tried.  At the moment he didn’t precisely have a body, or vocal chords, so yelling was impossible.  Moriarty pulled away, smirking into Sherlock’s dead eyes.  Sherlock lowered his hands, holding them at Moriarty’s chest level.  The knife was still pressed against Sherlock’s chest, John could see the blood dripping from the ever growing wound.
He couldn’t tell if Moriarty was pleased or not.  He did like torturing Sherlock, that much was obvious.  But if John might figure out where he was….Moriarty would rather enjoy killing John in front of Sherlock.  But he was rather hoping to wait a bit before they got to that part.  Sherlock wasn’t sure if Moriarty was telling him all this…or if he just knew it.
“I’m here now.  I’ll make the pain go away,” promised Moriarty.  He leaned up on his tip toes, pressed deep kiss to Sherlock’s lips.  His hand drifted to Sherlock’s cock, brushing lightly against it.  It twitched slightly.  Moriarty grinned against Sherlock’s lips.  “You want it,” he murmured.  “It’s John and you want it, even after what just happened.”  He pulled away, and he was himself again, and Sherlock fell back against the wall, eyes wide.
Re-learning it wasn’t too difficult.  Re-learning to speak it wasn’t hard either.   He simply couldn’t be bothered a lot of the time.  And John seemed to understand him well enough without it anyway.
John didn’t want to see this.  He knew he didn’t want to see this.  Somewhere, far away, Sherlock’s fingers tightened on the back of his head.
John swallowed.  He still hated these….sharing sessions.  But the relief in Sherlock’s eyes afterward was always so palpable.  And John could do nothing else to help him.  He stepped forward, felt Sherlock’s hands cupping his face and bringing their foreheads together.  There was the now familiar sickening swirl of color and sound, and the moment in Sherlock, feeling everything he had felt before he was forced to watch as a spectator.
John awoke to screaming.  He had been sleeping in the same room as Sherlock, and was attuned to the whimpers, he'd thought, that preceded most of his nightmares.  On this night though, Sherlock had been silent until the screaming started.  John didn't wake until Sherlock was shrieking to wake the dead, hands clawing at his stomach, red lines appearing on pale flesh, already bleeding.  "It's in me!" he shrieked.  "No! No!  Get it out!  Get it
Moriarty’s spells and sigils had lost their power when he’d died.  Two boys snuck into the warehouse.  Probably to drink and smoke.  They saw the dead body, saw the chained and injured Sherlock and took off running.  Sherlock screamed after them.  The colors shifted, John felt he was spinning, and then he was back in Baker Street, gasping, Mycroft looking concerned, and Sherlock looking frighteningly dead eyed again.
“He would have.  Eventually.  He would have taken you, likely brutally killed you in front of Sherlock, and likely Mrs Hudson as well as you, Detective Inspector, and then used that wraith to…convince Sherlock that he had done it.  He was…at one point, hanging on to sanity by noticing that the things in his visions were not there consistently.  If he imagined to have killed you, and then your bodies didn’t go away….then he would have believed it.  James….wanted him broken entirely before he killed him.”
But the wings had been injured and broken and festering for weeks, unable to move, blood and pus congealing in the feathers, and the metal had been melted to them in places.  So as the hell hounds tore away the netting, it caused more pain than Sherlock could have imagined.  The wings didn’t burst free, they were peeled free, leaving a good chunk of them behind in the dirty and stinking nets.  Moriarty crouched in front of him.  “Don’t ever let me catch you telling him
Also....this chapter is not edited.  The others were, at least a bit, this one is not at all.  So....sorry for any mistakes.  Feel free to point them out.
And then he dreamed of John again, the first time he’d managed to sleep more than a few minutes without nightmares or demons waking him.  They were on a beach this time.  And Sherlock was so relieved to see John he almost hugged him.  Instead, he merely asked John to talk.  To tell him how everyone was doing.  Each word reassured his beleaguered mind that he had definitely not killed his friends.  That they were all well, and unmolested by Moriarty’s demons.   Moriarty was coming, Sherlock could feel it.  “Remember the metal…” he tried suddenly, doing his best to give John a clue as to his whereabouts.  Water, from the previous conversation.  Metalworks.  Hopefully, John would piece it together.  It wasn’t much to go on though.  Especially since John likely thought these were just very vivid dreams.  But still, he hoped John would figure it out.  It was unlikely, since he hadn’t gotten the rest of the word out before he was dragged to the sea and down.
Learning what was real took….a long time.  He had to be sure, he had to feel things for himself.   And even then, he needed Mycroft to prove it.  To tell him it was alright.  That it was John.  Or Lestrade.  He didn’t really remember much English.  It was easier to speak in Enochian.  Or in one of the other languages of the angels.  Mycroft wanted him to speak in English though.  As did John, so he tried.  In the end, it was exhausting, so mostly, he didn’t speak at all, not for a long time.
“Oh, recalcitrant today are we?”  Sherlock’s eyes hardened slightly.  The effect was somewhat ruined by the fact that he was soaking wet and shivering.   Moriarty ‘tsk’d’ again.  “Angela, Dawson.  Have some fun will you?  I want him a bit warmed up.”  The two demons grabbed at the wrist chains.  His wings swung out and hit them both, leaving them swearing. Moriarty laughed.  “Got a bit of fight in you today, that’s nice.  Keeps things interesting.  Come on.  He’s chained up.  Use your pathetic little brains.”  If they were insulted, neither demon showed it.  They went for the chains again, got another clock round their heads with his wings for their efforts.
He’d put him unconscious for two weeks, and actually hooked him up to IV’s liberated from a local hospital.  “To make sure he has gets some nutrients in him,” Mycroft had said.
There were bad days.  John was often ushered away on those days.  Sometimes he was already there when Sherlock would suddenly panic.  Very little could set him off sometimes.  The sound of a car door slamming somewhere.  The grandfather clock chiming.  A child clicking a stick along the wrought iron fence near Mycroft’s property.  John didn’t even know how Sherlock could hear some of those things.  Mycroft assured him that he could.   Sometimes it was more obvious what had frightened him.  The car backfiring.   Sometimes it was nearly impossible to figure it out.  The child with the stick.
John was happy to have him here, though he worried incessantly.  Sherlock wanted to tell him that it would be alright, that he was fine, he was home.  But he wasn't really fine at all, and they both knew it.  And talking, lately, had just seemed to be so much extra effort that he didn't feel like dealing with at all.  English felt wrong on his tongue.   All the little rules and regulations felt tiny and insignificant and he simply didn't care.  He could get his point across with out using words.  And John more or less accepted that, taking Sherlock's impressions and images and using those to communicate, though he begged him to use his words almost daily.   Sometimes Sherlock complied.  Other times he did not.
““Nothing, it’s not important.  Look, he’ll realize that I’m here, you have to get…” and then he’d felt Moriarty’s presence.  He felt it wrapping around his body, suffocating him.  He saw John’s eyes, wide and terrified, and knew John must see it too, though he had no idea what John was seeing.  And then he was jerked backward, tumbling into darkness, opening his eyes to the furious face of Moriarty.
have, getting his hands around the chain, and starting to climb up, had ended with the chain being electrified, and he’d fallen.  He’d been a little surprised that his arms hadn’t broken, with the force of his fall.
It was of no use, of course, he was weak, that much was obvious.  And John didn’t like the look of his purple-red ribs.  The demons that had forced him to the bars were lashing him there, with some rather painful looking rope.  His wrists were already bleeding, and he’d barely pulled against it.  The third demon stepped forward, a fire poker in her hand.  It was glowing red.  She trailed it down Sherlock’s back, and he arched it, jerking forward as much as he could.  She played the poker down around his hips, over his arse cheeks, skimming the crack between them.  John had a sudden, horrid sense of foreboding.  John saw Moriarty enter the room, though Sherlock wouldn’t have been able to.  There were quite a few people with him.  Demons, John knew by now.
“Sherlock!  Sherlock!”  A woman screamed.  Sherlock screamed too.  “No!  No you promised.  Only me, you
“Nothing, it’s not important.  Look, he’ll realize that I’m here, you have to get…” and a thick black smoke had wrapped around Sherlock’s mouth, sliding up his nose, then enveloped his body, leaving nothing but widened eyes behind, and then it flew through the wall.  John had woken up gasping.
He tilted his head slightly.  "It wasn't all the way dead.  I…" he struggled for the right english word, and not finding it, substituted.  "Helped it."
John Watson’s first dream came within the first three months.  He was sitting, alone in the flat and suddenly Sherlock was there, looking surprised, coat firmly buttoned around him.  “Oh,” he’d said.  “Finally, I didn’t expect it to work.  We must be asleep at the same time.  I’ve been trying for ages you know.”
The demons came a little later, when he just…hung there arms numb and pained.  He still managed to kick at them, until two started holding his legs down, making struggle impossible.
There might be better choices, but based on the very little bit of research I did, I like those names.
He didn’t tell John and Lestrade everything.  Or even most of it.  He wasn’t really watching the tapes.  Dina did that, and passed information onto Mycroft, or let him know if there was a particular tape that he
Lestrade moved slowly toward the cage, touching the bars. Sherlock became frantic, screaming, flinging himself against the walls.  He hid behind the wings, though the motion seemed to cause him pain.  Lestrade stepped away, and Sherlock seemed to calm.  At least, he stopped screaming.  His eyes darted wildly around the room again; then he caught sight of John.
He screamed for Mycroft who was there in an instant with Isda, and the two of them managed to subdue Sherlock so he couldn't hurt himself anymore.  John tried to wake him for nearly five minutes before he stopped thrashing and his eyes lost that blank, unseeing look.  He was panting and still sobbing slightly.  "There's nothing inside you Sherlock," said John.  "Except for what is meant to be there.  No rats."  Sherlock nodded, then panicked again as he felt his arms still held captive.  He started to scream again, as Mycroft all but shoved John out of the way.
“Come Angela, give him some time.”  Sherlock had snorted.  A demon named Angela.  Ironic.  She’d given him another poke, this one in the stomach and danced away.   “You enjoy your sleep?”  He’d only had about two hours of it.  They’d kept screaming, and invisible hands kept yanking on the chains around his wrists and neck.  He didn’t answer, merely glared at Moriarty.
be?  He collapsed in on himself, and Moriarty’s laughter didn’t move him.  That dead look in Sherlock’s eyes, that hadn’t really gone away….John saw it in him in this vision.
BANG BANG BANG.  Echoing around what felt like a vast chamber.  Everything was dark and spinning but just for a moment.  It took him a moment to realize where he was.  Sherlock’s memory.  He was in Sherlock’s memory.  He felt vaguely horrified.  For a moment, he was Sherlock.  He was freezing, feet cramping on the concrete floor, wrists chafing, metal shackles tight around them, a collar around his neck, large spokes digging against his skin every time he moved.  There was a pain he couldn’t understand, radiating from…somewhere down into his shoulder and side.  It was only a moment, and then he was forced outside Sherlock’s body, and he was watching the scene as a ghost.
And then Mycroft was there, looking shaken, and people started just walking by again, paying no attention to the rather odd group.  Mycroft opened the door, and all three moved up to B.  Sherlock walked slowly up the stairs, as if he was remembering how.  John walked into the flat first, then Mycroft.  Sherlock stood hesitantly at the door.
Remembers Molly’s knife cutting down his chest, and he…hands shooting up, choking, pressing against her throat, the soft noise of thumbs crushing trachea.  Remembers Lestrade coming after him with Donvan and Anderson and…others.  Remembers grabbing a stick…a sword?  They had clubs…he remembered ducking and weaving and stabbing…and the wraith, coming back.  He tried to kill her.  It didn’t work.
….He was chained, arms stretched above his head, feet not touching the floor.  His shoulders ached.  There was something hard and unforgiving up his arse.  At least it wasn’t moving.  Sometimes they moved.  Moriarty was pacing in circles around him, saying something.  Probably something threatening, but Sherlock didn’t hear any of it.  His eyes were on the whip.  Though of course, it was when he couldn’t see it that it was used.  He screamed….
“Not quite what you’d pictured, I assume.  “We are not quite as depicted by Renaissance painters.  I assure you, Sherlock is actually one of the nicer ones, believe it or not.”  Sally managed a choked sort of noise.  “Do not mock, Ms Donovan.  I have kept your memory intact because I believe my brother actually rather likes you in his own way, at least, he respects you more than he does most of your co-workers, and also because I needed someone in the Yard to back up the Detective Inspector here, when he gives a falsified report if people start asking questions.”  She swallowed.  “Thank you.  Now.  Do not ask me what happened to my brother.  I was not there, I do not know.  That warehouse, the cage, both were warded.  He couldn’t get out, and he couldn’t be heard, not by anyone.  If someone had happened to be able to get inside the warehouse, which they wouldn’t have, the warding was too strong, they wouldn’t have been able to see or hear him, if they passed within inches of the cage.  I do not know what happened, and I do not know the extent of his injuries, though it seems they were severe.  His grace…his power, was…muted, I suppose.  It’s the only way he could have sustained some of his injuires.  I do not know how, though I aim to find out.  This seems to mean that he actually needed food and warmth, and sleep, especially in the cold.  It furthermore seems, that these were all denied him rather consistently.”  There was a knock on the door.  “Come in.”  The woman John knew as Anthea came in.
than before.  And John didn’t know, didn't know how much different he was.   False John had known.  Real John wouldn’t.  So he’d assure him.  Once he knew that it wasn’t a False John…it was Real John, with the proper smell, and feel, he’d reassure Real John too.  Real John wouldn’t know.  Real John would want to make sure.  False John…would know already.  He wouldn’t need to check to see that it was really him.  He didn’t want to speak to a False John.  So when John started moving fingers across his face, he was relieved.
Mycroft’s face was too big.  Too close.  Sherlock closed his eyes.  Maybe it would go away.  He opened his eyes.  It was still there.  Further away now.  Drifting toward him once more.  Why couldn’t he see?  He whimpered a little.  There was a hand on his shoulder, and he flung himself backward.  No, not…he couldn’t finish the thought, couldn’t remember what had been the problem.  “Sherlock!”  that was his name, he knew that, that was…good, that he knew his name and…he was pressed into the corner, Mycroft coming close.   No, no, he didn’t want Mycroft near him, why was he moving toward him?  He moaned, trying to fit himself further into the corner.  It wasn’t working, why?  Why couldn’t he make himself smaller?  The buzzing in his head…there was a buzzing, and it wouldn’t….stop.  There was a banging now, why….buzzing changed to banging, buzzing to banging buzzing to banging, banging, banging, banging….
“We are going to discuss…how we can help him,” he said.  “Physically…well, he seemed okay, as was possible.  There were mentions of bone breaks and…well.  Of impaling,” he shivered, “but there were no signs of that when we…when we found him.  I haven’t….gotten to the mental bits yet.”  He dreaded getting to the parts where Moriarty started to play with Sherlock’s mind.
The cattle prod was dropped and John felt a little sick when he saw the demon slip spiked brass knuckles on his hands.  Two jabs to the sides, and then he thrust, hard into Sherlock’s armpits lifting him up.  This scream was different, more broken.  The demon chuckled.  He tightened the choke collar’s chain, so that if Sherlock slumped, or tried to do anything but stand he’d be deeply wounded by the collar.  He stepped back and the first two started in with the clubs again, beating him at the knees (John winced when he heard the kneecap break) and ribs and slamming the butt of the clubs down on his feet, leaving them pulpy, bloody messes.  Sherlock collapsed once, and it nearly decapitated him, or so it looked to John, and he grunted slightly feeling like he had been the one it had happened to, not Sherlock.
So.  This has got sex in it.  Well, rape, technically.  Just in case you don't want to read that bit.  It's at the end, and it is obvious when it is coming.  So you are warned.
It was nearly a month and a half after what John called the Pond Incident, and two months after the Dream Incident, that Sherlock decided he wanted another day out.  John had tried to steer him away from the park, but Sherlock was absolutely adamant.  He hadn't even thought about it until three days ago, when the little boy had turned up at Baker Street.  Sherlock had opened the door before John could protest, and the boy had started with babbled thanks.  "She's all better sir, the doctors didn't know what to say, and she had to be in the hospital for another week, but she's all better and your water did it.  Thank you, thanks sir, I mean, really." and he hadn't seemed likely to stop, so Sherlock had merely nodded once, and shut the door on his face.  John had gone to apologize, but the boy was gone, and in his place was a piece of paper with a drawing of Sherlock dressed as a superhero.   Sherlock didn't care, when John had shown him, though a little pleased feeling ran through John that he was pretty sure actually belonged to Sherlock.   He supposed it was a good thing that Sherlock was pretending not to care about it.  He never would have shown that he cared about something so sentimental before.  John decided to take it as a sign that Sherlock was getting better.  But he kept the picture, putting it in a box that he kept under his bed, slipping the paper  underneath his war medals and next to the last picture he'd taken with his father before the man had died.  Sherlock could claim it later, if he wanted.
Making sense of what had happened to him.  He remembered all of it, with startling, horrifying clarity.  But now...now he could face it.  He didn't run away anymore.  He faced it, locked it up in his mind palace, kept it, and himself, safe from James Moriarty's influence.
Not ever again.  Or I will kill him.  And I will make you watch.”  The hell hounds were gone.  Sherlock never saw them leave.  “Goodbye Sherlock, for now.  Enjoy some lye, while I’m gone.”  Two demons pulled the chains at his arms tight and low, forcing his forehead to the ground.  Liquid splashed over him, burning.  He screamed, even as he felt the skin on his back turning an angry red, cracking, and the pain starting again as the liquid filled the new cracks.
“I think we need to discuss something else, Mycroft,” said John, evenly.  “Why did Moriarty…or James, or whatever the fuck his name was, choose Sherlock to do this to?  Mycroft sighed.
James…agreed with him wholeheartedly.  Sherlock and I…rather did as well.  Until Sherlock figured out what it was Lucifer really meant.  James and Sherlock had been…close.  Very close and…they’d been making plans, for…well, for when we won.  Everyone knew it would come to war.  And Sherlock and James were excited for this new world.  A world where, as we thought, angels and heaven and God would get proper respect.  Well.  Sherlock figured out that Lucifer planned on
“It’s him, Sherlock,” he said softly.  Sherlock stood slowly.  Lestrade looked a bit nervously at the wings.
feet, where had they come from? Kicking at his back and kidneys and legs, stomping on his knee caps and then there was a stiletto through his hand and he screamed.
Sariel had been trying to heal Sherlock’s body as best he could.  Body would come first, and then they could start working on healing his mind.  Dina was concerned it was taking so long to heal his body.  But his grace was hurt too, and that was making it difficult to help the vessels body.  Sariel had to heal both Sherlock himself, the grace, and the body it was contained in.  It would take some doing.
The next entry was dated a month and a half later.   There had been a few aborted entries, though none detailed any vicious tortures, not like the previous entries.  A few lines here and there:
The officers, aside from Sally Donovan and Lestrade started treating the scene far more normally.  “They’ll make the report,” said Mycroft.  “They found him.  Caged and abused.  He’s been taken to a private hospital, and his captor is dead.”  The four of them were standing in Mycroft’s house.  Sherlock was lying in Mycrofts arms.  Then, both were gone again.  Lestrade felt sick.  Mycroft reappeared.  “We have much to discuss,” he said stiffly.  “This way.”
Sherlock’s head jerked back, slamming into the wall.  His vision swam, but he managed to notice, for the first time that the heel of the shoe was made of an angel blade.  Not tempered in hell fire, just a regular blade.  That explained the glove he supposed.  He sucked in a hissing breath.  “You keep fighting me Sherlock,” James whispered.  “I do like it.”  He twisted the shoe before pulling it out.  “But please stop being boring about it.”  He jammed the shoe into Sherlock’s shoulder.   It was getting harder to bite back the screams.  He clenched his teeth, and whimpered slightly.   James clicked his tongue against his teeth.   “I want to hear you scream Sherlock,” he said, and twisted the shoe.  Sherlock did scream, and the shoe was removed and tossed away.  “That wasn’t so hard, was it?”  He stepped away, and Sherlock fell to the floor, cracking his knees hard.
The woman looked nonplussed, and then awed.  "Was that you?" she asked, breathlessly.  "You made the tree alive again?"
John shuddered.  He was already horrified.  He forced himself to keep reading, feeling sicker and sicker the more he read.
“The little sister?” Sherlock nodded.  “And the water will…heal her?”  Sherlock nodded again.  “Could you…could you have done it from here?”  Another nod.  That made him a little mad.  “Well?  Why didn’t you?” he demanded.
needed to be sure, so John needed to test him as well.  The next day, when Sherlock hesitantly put John’s hand on his cheek, John, feeling a little awkward, started moving his hand slowly over Sherlock’s face.
"I only fix what's broken," he said.  "I see your niece."  He tapped her forehead.  "Nothing broken with her.  She's happy."  He scowled at the woman.  "Come John."  And he grabbed his shoes away from the man and strode away, making John jog after him.
Mycroft sighed again.  “There was a War,” he said finally.  “A long time ago.  Heaven’s forces were split.  One-third agreed with Lucifer, that humans should be subjugated, that it was wrong that we were meant to bow to your kind, that you should bow to us.  He said…that God was asking us to….love humans more than Him, that this was wrong, that Lucifer, for one, wouldn’t do it.  He…was clever and persuasive.  Really, he wasn’t talking about loving our Father too much, he was talking about doing a better job ruling than Him, that he had a better plan.
"You aren't broken," he whispered.  "Not irreparably.  You fix yourself every day.  You let me help you.  You let Mycroft help when I cannot.  Don't ever think you're broken Sherlock.  Because you are picking yourself up.  And gluing yourself back together, and there is no way you could do that if you were unfixable."
“Please,” said Sherlock, “please, please,”  He alternated muttering and screaming.  “Don’t hurt him, please,”  Until finally the metal stopped connecting with skin and the chain lifted him up higher, almost to the roof, and then was severed, sending him plummeting to the ground.  His leg made a horrible cracking sound.  Then he screamed again, because someone was on his leg, pulling and he screamed yet again as the bone was forced through skin and
“You’ll want to be careful how close you get to me,” he snarled, striking out, hard.  It wasn’t an effective blow, not really.  It hit his Fallen brother in the human vessels solar plexus,  had James been human, it would have leveled him.  As it was, he did stumble back, and straightened his suit furiously.  “You will pay for that one Sherlock,” he hissed.  Sherlock was quite sure that he would.  But he was learning.  James, it seemed, when gloating, had a tendency to come too close.  Sherlock had felt an angel blade in his coat.  He would keep that in mind.
"It's not real," John comforted before Atlas lost all grips on what was and was not just that: real.
"Alright, okay, I know, I know," John whispered as Atlas' head stopped shaking and then her left arm began to slow, until reaching a stop. Her right hand following shortly afterwards.
"You let them in." Atlas smiled as they pulled into the Tesco car park. "And the society was reborn."
"Atlas," John tried but she had her back turned now and her breathing was heavy. Her hands were shaking and he could hear her chest heaving. "Can you-"
"No more work for tonight. Anyway, a letter came through the door." John said and Atlas sighed and tried to get up.
"I know what your thinking." Sherlock sighed. "But, I want it to go in your room. If you want it of course, by the window seat."
"Your lucky I'm not washing the mugs Sherlock Holmes." Atlas scolded before leaving the two men to speak. That is if John could bring himself to bring up what he had been meaning to mention for a whole month.
"Have you ever?" Mycroft asked Sherlock. Sherlock looked at him confused. "Have you ever told John about your anxiety?"
"Rosie's been saying something is going on between you two. A falling out or something." Sherlock said, Atlas only looking at him before down at the album. Her eyes pricking in unshed tears, she nodded into his chest once. "I know one thing. I did many things that should have made John never love me, never like me but he always came back. That unbelievable man is loyal to a fault."
"No. No, I think it's o-" John began but then her body went rigid, her eyes rolled and she was sent like waves into a boulder, into a seizure. Her whole body convulsed, her mouth continuously clicked and both men found themselves propelling off the bed to get out the way. Beeping summoned the doctor and nurses to her bedside, as they administered a needle to her arm to subside the seizure. But it kept going.
"Grandma and Grandad are popping by on Friday after school with Mycroft and Eurus. They want to see the final thing. I thought it would give us time to move and settle in a bit." Sherlock smiled before he lifted Rosie onto the breakfast bar, Jeff clutched to her chest. Her cast was yet to come off, the break taking longer to heal than anticipated. However, Rosie was really hoping that it would come off on Wednesday when she had the appointment. She'd gone off pink in recent weeks and was ready to wear her jackets and jumpers more comfortably.
"Understood." She paused a moment. "I have a maths book for Atlas. Although, I heard she has decided to take a course in English Literature, History and Politics. Quite an array and not quite what I would expect. She's very good with numbers but she is definitely better with words. Well she's bound to be with all that reading she does."
"Keep experimenting, that's what being young is for," Sherlock smiled, reappearing before kissing the crown of Sammy's head. "Alright?"
"I'm just tired, that's all." John whispered and he paused. "We didn't even get to give her her new records and sheet music."
"Okay. Is it possible that we are looking at an intended poisoning by a second party?" The doctor asked.
"Sherl-" And then the familiar drone of a disconnected line appeared and the call was no more. John put his palms to his eyes and rubbed before setting his phone down and sighing.
"Yes, you should have," John said and Atlas turned to look at him. "But that doesn't mean I'm mad or anything like that. I know that I can't even begin to understand how hard it can all be."
"Alright, now?" John asked as they met up with him just outside the little M&S right next to the Costa.
Tears began to cloud Atlas' vision as the beeps began to get increasingly louder as the timer reached two minutes and a half. Her breath caught in her throat as she glanced down at the timer.
"Uhm, Sherlock," Sammy whispered as the other man stayed at the bottom of the stairs. "Can you come with me?"
Then she stopped. John and Lestrade shared a concerned look as she looked dead straight ahead, seemingly not being present. Then, as if she'd lost all control in her arm, she dropped the glass. It shattering into a million pieces on the hard floor. John took her by the arms and sat her down on a stool.
"Well thank you," John smiled at her as Atlas nodded with a smile and hugged him back. "You mean as much to me as Rosie and Sam do. I love you, poppet."
Sherlock stood in his daughter's room plucking books off the shelf and reading the titles. He made a mental list of which books she had so that it made it easier for him to buy her a christmas present.
"I would say I don't know what you mean, but I know you would find out that I do." Atas agreed instantly, he grin showing some teeth. Then she frowned as she willed herself to explain in slightly more depth. "Lestrade told me that unless we find a way to occupy you you'll-"
"I played cello, poorly, as a child," John said with a smile. "Maybe for about a year and the cello is a family one passed down through our generations."
"Okay. So, like I said the results have come in." John wheeled his chair over to opposite Georgia who was so small with big eyes. "I'm glad you came in today because the results came in just yesterday." Leanne's breath hitched. "I'm sorry, but it is cancer."
"I will. I promise." Sherlock approached John as he put the bowl of porridge in the sink. He kissed him lightly on the lips, John putting two hands on his chest. Rosie gave a very loud
Sherlock being the person he was didn't move an inch, however John did taking a chair up next to hers. He seemed sad from what Sherlock could gather and Sherlock wondered if that's what the ache in his stomach and the lump in his throat was. His eyes watered and before he knew it his legs were forcing him out of the room and into the hallway.
"Hmm," Rosie said turning around to look at Harry and her papa who was sat next to her drinking tea. "Is it a Jeff!?" Harry looked at her with a smiled. "It's a dipcus."
"You," Atlas replied simply before opening her eyes. "I really hope I didn't break it. I didn't mean to."
The person who was allowing Rosie to grow up with two parents, with a family. And god if he didn't love Sherlock to the ends of the earth in that moment.
"I do know how to do it." Sherlock remarked as Rosie shook her head and sighing he got up and took a seat next to Wanda and watched.
Sherlock looked momentarily over to his eldest daughter, sure that he had heard her say something. She was still peacefully sleeping, curled up in a ball on her side.
"Okayyyyou'rereereerereur okay," John said looking at him softly. "Breath, Sherlock, take some deep breaths."
"Rosie." She strained. "Ro, Rosie." Removing her mask she tossed it to one side and began an attempt to sit up. Sherlock sat down on the bed and gathered her into him. He nodded to John who lifted Rosie around the other side. Atlas was shuffled onto one side of Sherlock, her legs discarded to one side as John and Rosie squeezed onto the mattress beside them.
for her. However, Sherlock had said they would set up for experiments only. He had plans for a special fridge in their too. With excitement they chatted over all the plans they had for the house. The ideas, how they all saw it come together.
"Will we see the sunrise?" The little girl asked quietly, Atlas nodding in response. If they left now, they could be looking out across some islands in time for the sun to rise. Atlas helped her dress in a short dungarees with a pair of tights, before putting a jumper on top of the T-shirt she had insisted on wearing. Atlas chucked on a pair of random trousers and a T-Shirt and cardigan. She would wear a jacket when they got downstairs.
It was morning. No, no it was evening. Midnight. Exactly midnight. Everyone had gone to bed early. She was still at the lodge, they'd been there nearly a week. Now, as clear as day she heard Rosie's screams before nothing. Slowly, she felt her neck. Tranquilizers. Brilliant. Just brilliant. Now, she just wondered where everyone else had gotten to and prayed that she wouldn't run out of oxygen in there. Out of nowhere there was a low buzz - as if a microphone was turning on.
"Breathe through it." Mycroft soothed, placing a hand to her knee and suddenly, Atlas wasn't Atlas, but a young Sherlock. All dressed up smartly in a blazer and shirt and it was now Mycroft realised that Atlas was - in so many ways - a carbon copy of her father, right down to the way she dealt with situations. He remembered one time that Sherlock had been at school and come home. The younger brother had headed straight for his room and locked himself away, not even appearing for tea. Mycroft, being the sly person he was, crafted a perfect explanation for why he had to venture into Sherlock's room. On the bed, Sherlock was having a panic attack and for the life of him Mycroft couldn't figure out why. And he felt a bit like that now and related so much and then came to the stifling realsiation that Sherlock's anxiety had never left him. And neither had his depression.
"Okay," Rosie squeaked with a nod for Xerxes, before she hopped into Atlas' lap, leaning against her.
"Oh, Sherlock!" Isla called. "Harry and Jo were going out for a walk this afternoon they were wondering if you'd join them. Me and John will stay here with Atlas."
"You alright?" Atlas asked as she came back to the trolley with a box of cupcake casings and decorations. Rosie really wanted to bake and had been mithering Atlas for days about doing it and ultimately, Atlas couldn't resist the deep blue eyes, cute smile and the fact that Jeff too, was desperate to bake.
"This better be good." Atlas said before he gave a smirk. It was now she saw that he too was wearing his pyjamas and she got to her feet.
"You look like him." She remarked before looking over to the living room behind Atlas. "How come you didn't think he was hitting on you?" She asked but before Atlas could answer she added. "Only every girl thinks he's doing some sort of flirtatious dance and not realising he's as gay as a rainbow on a roundabout."
"Atlas could you leave?" Sherlock asked quietly looking at the girl who was teary eyed. He didnt want to look at her. "Please."
"That box is supposed to help you remember," Sherlock smiled as she came back over with a glass of water and stuck a tongue out at him.
John put an arm around the teens shoulders. "Its who you are and that's okay. That's wonderful infact." Sammy's head dropped onto John's shoulder gently as he shut his eyes and gave a quiet whimper, which should have saddned John. But it didn't. It inspired him, the boy inspired him and it warmed him. The thought that this young boy was so, undoubtedly brave to be able to go through what he went through and still be standing was amazing. "Alright, your okay."
"Aside from the obvious, there's nothing we can see in the way of cuts or physical harm. I am worried about this spacing. I'm particularly worried about the development of PT-" The paramedic started.
"As a GP I know now that until you have another seizure, the doctor's won't refer you anywhere." John said. "But I think after the next one, if it happens, which probability says it will, we need to get an appointment." Atlas sighed as she looked up at him. "There's chance that something has developed or that something else has happened so we'll check it, yeah?"
"Rosie's hungry." Atlas said before looking back at the girl who she could confidently call her sibling. No-one knew why Rosie had an unwillingness to talk, but she did. And it wasn't like she couldn't speak or she didn't practice because she could often be found talking to her soft toy animals as she read them stories. It was just humans, she wouldn't speak to humans unless absolutely necessary.
Timothy nodded before tapping his nose, the girl retrieving her bookmark from the desk and placing it just inside. Then she trekked to her bedroom to retrieve a gesture, one few could expect.
"I'm here Sherlock," John whispered as he rested his forehead against his. "Just, breathe. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere, love."
"Of course," Sherlock smiled before he pulled out his violin, tightened the bow before looking at her. "Bach?"
"I know you do," John whispered. "Me and Sherlock are here and will always be here, for you and anything you need to speak to us about." He paused with a smirk. "From, I don't know, sex to where your going to study." Sammy laughed at that.
"If you sit up a little, I have something to show you." Sherlock said, the teenager doing as she was asked. It was now, she realised that she was behaving like a child and almost regretted her need for comfort like some sort of sentimental toddler. She sat up out of his hold before coming back into it, her head resting on the front of his shoulder. "Just don't make fun of me for it."
"Come here," John whispered with outstretched arms and Atlas made her way into them and made herself ever so small. She gripped at his arm tightly, the grip only loosening once he'd put his cheek to her hair. "Alright."
"And watched me die." Sherlock whispered regretfully, his eyes shining with tears. "You battled all that too." John just nodded before they hugged under the covers and John kissed Sherlocks forehead. "I could never have done all of that without you."
"Well, I always think I want to and then I think about leaving you all," John said, looking down at him. "And I can't anymore. I can't leave you or Rosie or Sammy and I definitely can't leave Atlas because she needs us right now."
"And you must be the famous blogger, Dr Watson-Holmes, congratulations on the marriage by the way," Gordon smiled as he shook John's hand.
"Sorry?" John said from the front of the class, Atlas' head snapping up incredibly fast. What was he doing? Asking her questions? People would know who she might be.
"Good morning." Jo said eventually, after she felt like the amount of time she had spent watching was bordering on awkward or inappropriate. She entered the room as Atlas turned down the music playing on her speaker as Sherlock served up the boiled egg for Rosie. He then cut her toast in strips and gave them to her.
"The normal way." She replied before laughing. The normal way consisted of a bank transfer of money - not the normal rate - and no mention of it to her father. All those times she was supposedly taking her notebook to the park or going for a walk she was coming to crime scenes.
"She's my baby," Sherlock said quietly before feeling the outside of his coat pocket. "Oh, Whisper." He nestled the toy in the crook of Atlas' arm and they waited. "I love you." And then he turned his head to John. "I love you."
"Hey Sam," Atlas said gently as she crouched next to him, kneeling on the floor. She put her torch upright on the floor and looked at him kindly. "Hey, hey, what is it?"
"Atlas." Sherlock said sternly, the young girl looking at him sideways before returning her eyes to the ceiling.
After around 25 pages Sherlock heard a medium loud crash and his eyes went wide. He put it to something minor and went back to his book, before hearing another, similar sound. This time it was more like a persistent groan, or cry for help. And then he heard it, a loud gasp and another crash. He entered the hallway and listened out for more. Upon hearing the sound was coming from Atlas' room he entered his eyes darting around, taking in as much as he could.
"Yeah, of course." Sherlock said, coming around to stand by John, a hand wrapped around his shoulder. And Jo could see how much they needed each other.
"Nuh-uh." John said as Atlas attempted to pull away from where she was sat. "Come here." She lay near him with her nose tucked into his side.
"SEE here, we flip it over because it's the right colour on ones side." Timothy said as he ungracefully flipped a sausage as Rosie - standing at a safe distance - watched intently. Atlas was sat crossed legged on the grass, reading a book as always predicted. Directly behind her, Wanda was attempting to platt her unruly short curls. Sherlock and John were sat at the picnic bench in conversation with Wanda (as she platted).
"She was moved from home to home after three incidents that occurred with her mother. The first was running down the street with her hair on fire, the second was jumping out a window and landing on the street below and the final one was pulling a gun out on people in a public place before shooting and inevitably killing two. Atlas was only around three when that last one happened. Her mother got put in psych. I left them when she was around seven maybe six." Sherlock explained, John's eyebrows narrowing.
"Hey, hey, none of that," Sherlock said, pulling her to his chest and kissing her hair softly. "It's part of the process."
John put the book he was reading to Rosie down, as Atlas allowed Sammy to sit on the chair - herself standing to his right. Sherlock sat down on the sofa, not close enough to John as normal. Ever since that woman, ever since John had
"My lovely husband, I'm not having a go. I'm sad too," John whispered as Sherlock nodded before clutching his partner closer.
"Maybe the news articles are right. Maybe that friend of yours is a freak and maybe that kid of his is just the same. A freak." John Sr said. And then John punched him, square in the jaw, before holding his hand as it throbbed in pain. Atlas was his kid, he wanted to be her dad. And they were
"Right. Shall we head to our favourite spot with this stuff?" Sammy translated for Xerxes as he gathered some bags of things to put at their private memorial for Aba.
"I found it hard. It's not easy, but it's never going to be easy. People make fun of you, yet you can't let that change you." Sherlock said, exchanging a look with John before he looked to see Atlas smiling at him.
"We need to get her to A&E and make sure we get some other things checked out." Quentin said as he looked at her eyes. Her eyes seemed to be drooping. "Mr Watson-Holmes?" He asked, Sherlock's head snapping up from where he'd been standing, looking at the ground.
"We feel for our own kids, yes," Ruth smiled. "But Sammy and Atlas, they were Aba's friends first. She loved them and they loved her. I can still remember May's face the day she found out...the just, sheer sadness in her eyes."
"Yeah." She sighed. "She's my friend but things change and the world changes and moves. It'll be fine."
"Well, that is true," John could be heard saying before they entered the kitchen, putting the bags of takeout onto the cabinets.
"Okay," Atlas smiled gently before leaning her head on Harry's shoulder and conversation continuing again.
"I think so," Sherlock said. "But you were smiley too as a baby. When I unwrapped your swaddle your eyes and your smile." Lost in a moment of reminiscence he only found himself again when Atlas shuffled against him. "And now look at you. All grown up. No longer a baby but a young woman now. Beautiful. A beautiful young woman. Don't let anyone take you down yeah? No women. No men. Especially not men. And if you ever need anything I am always one phone call away."
THAT afternoon once the friends had left, it was just the five of them, all getting ready to pack before they headed for Scotland in three days. Sammy was sat on the bed with a frown looking at his suitcase blankly when John knocked.
"Mmhmm," John hummed before he kissed her hair and held his nose in the smell of John Freida. "Do you need to go to sleep?"
"Bless," Isla said quietly her eyes tracking Sherlock as he got up from where he was sitting. "Where are you off to now then?"
"Sorry?" John asked as he looked to the neat and tidy woman. She had her hair pinned back strictly and she gave off a calming, gentle energy. John figured she couldn't be much older than himself.
"Them, Sherlock," John said as he pulled out a fleece and held it up to his stomach. "Do you think it'll fit me?" Sherlock just looked at him like a rabbit caught in some headlights. "No, probably not, I should probably start running again...or-or maybe cycling? Yeah...maybe that...anyway..."
"Your neither of those things," Sacha said, crouching down infront of her. "Even covered in blood. Now, I think you and all of your family deserve to go home, have a shower and get some sleep."
"Ahhh, it's taken me near on ten years to get you to the point where you will actually admit you need a hug."
"I couldn't look after her. Well I could, but it became unsafe for me to do so. I was running a particularly dangerous case and it was better I had no child that they could use against me for leverage," Sherlock said quietly. "Not when that child was everything to me and didn't deserve anything that could happen to her. And it wasn't easy. She was the only thing I had, the only person who was mine. The only thing that kept me alive."
"It was that," Sherlock giggled glancing down at Atlas who was still asleep. "It's always really hard to tell with Atlas. Sometimes I think she could sleep through a storm on a boat and sometimes I think she can't sleep. Full stop."
"School. We're talking about it." John declared, Atlas rolling her eyes as she continued reading her book.
"Rosie always makes Atlas happy," Sammy smiled as he crossed his legs, pulled out a book and held it.
"That's because she's your baby, Sherlock," John said with a smile, rubbing his shoulder. "She'll always be our baby, our little girl. And I've always thought that children look small whilst they sleep. Vulnerable and I think for Atlas, her guard is up so much of the time, even when she was being cradled against you. No, I think the true moment of vulnerability, in anyone, is in sleep."
SHERLOCK helped Atlas make up her bed in Rosie's room and transfer a handful of things across into the yellow room whilst John and Rosie selected the book for the evening. Now, standing on her mattress Atlas waited for Sherlock to get a pillow for her pillow case.
"I know you do. I love you too." John smiled back before he looked over to where Rosie was painting. It looked to be coming along quite nicely and it appeared that where Rosie coloured the block colour, Eurus then painted in the details in a unique style.
"Oh," Sammy said looking up as he packed away some acrylics, watercolours and paintbrushes. "I-I drew them. And that one," he made his way around the bed and pointed to a big painting on a canvas with lots of sky swirls and mountains that looked truly amazing. "Me and Atlas worked on one time she came for an overnight visit. Georgia helped us with the stars."
"Far too obvious." Sammy smirked before they made their way back over to the hammock and clambered in.
"He put himself there." Atlas finished off for Lestrade who looked at her. "We just don't know why."
best and bravest." Sherlock was slowly beginning to choke on his own words. "And so that means that I think he's going to be fine."
"Oh sweetheart," Sherlock said rubbing at her back. "Go take a seat in your chair, I have to put baking powder on it soon."
"WEAKNESS." Eurus said as the water began to touch Mycroft's chest, he shuffled Rosie onto his shoulders as she held onto his forehead. Up there, she remained further away from the water. Safer for longer. "Look for a weakness." Eurus repeated after some time, looking an invisible entity on the concrete wall. Sherlock furrowed his brow in a way that would have been adorable had the situation not been life or death. "That guy. Whoever he is. He doesn't want us to die. Think about it. I didn't want you guys to die when I put you in that room, I just wanted to watch the show and watch you wriggle." The most the woman had said in some time, yet a point they all took seriously. "He knows we can figure it out."
"WHY don't we just do it?" Sherlock huffed as he flopped into bed next to John who had just shut his eyes.
It took ages for the seizure to end and then, when it did, her body was lying on the ground, unresponsive. Her eyelids shut over her eyes and she lay...still.
"Shut the hell up." John shouted, before silence. He looked over the dirt on top of the multiple graves. He looked for any sign of something abnormal that may elude to being Atlas' grave.
"Feel free to get out and stretch your legs," The Police officer said before disappearing and Atlas burst into tears.
"Come on." He muttered impatiently, Atlas rolling her eyes and taking long strides up to him. "This is the one."
"Dead." Sherlock simply stated as Mycroft peered over Mary-Anne's body. Meanwhile John was at Atlas' side checking her over, he was a war doctor. He could handle a bullet wound.
"Yeah," Atlas smiled as she came up the stairs, followed by her friends. "I'll play the cello, that way Xerxes can feel the vibrations." She signed before pulling it out the case as John pulled a seat up for her. "Dad, if we're going to give these people a show, will you play with me?"
"You guys are the best set of parents yet." Atlas chuckled, making them laugh and look at each other in return. "I just... you've both seen hell and walked through it, you've both shot people to save and your still the best set of parents anyone could ask for." John looked teary eyed Atlas shuffling forward. "You guys make all of this, so much easier. I don't know why I shot Mrs Peterson, but I don't care because you guys don't care. I'm afraid that one day I'm going to be alone and have a serious seizure, but I put it to the back of my mind knowing that you'll be there. Most of all, I'm afraid I'm going to go off kilter and I like to think even then, even then you'll both be there in the best way possible." Sherlock blinked away tears and looked to his lap, before back up at Atlas. "What I'm trying to say is thank you. Thank you for putting up with me and my lack of social capabilities and often common sense. And most of all. Thank you for being my dads."
"Yes, I know. You didn't." Atlas winked as they made their way inside the shop, picking up a basket and heading for the fruit and vegetables aisle.
"Or it's just random but she could be about to head into a full seizure," John frowned. "Her body has been out through a lot today, not to mention her head. And she's obviously not slept, so tommorow could be another day of difficult. But we'll do it."
"Your looking at them." He said smirking as he stayed lying down. Everyone looked confused before Mycroft sighed and ran a hand over Rosie's back.
"And I'm excited that Sammy is a part of our family now and I'm really grateful to you and dad," Atlas smiled. "
"Your my person too." Sammy smiled in return as he pulled out. "Mycroft. He's the one who lives with your aunt, right?"
"We're not one hundred percent sure on that yet. We think we are going to pay for witnesses to avoid family fall outs." John said, giving a weak smile. "Sherlock has quite a few family members and we have quite a few close friends, all of which will be at the small get together the following day."
Atlas and Mrs Hudson began to make a move to the bus stop, glancing idly at the christmas lights and decorations that adorned each shop. It was nearing 2pm and the hustle and bustle of shoppers was only just starting to arise. Once at the bus stop they waited before taking the two minute bus journey to Mycroft's home.
"Oh," Atlas said quietly before she sat forward a little to grasp at Sherlock who shuffled forward to hug her.
"I love you." Atlas whispered, Mycroft pulled away and looked at her, with gentle hands either side of her face.
"My, Sherlock, your memory really is poor sometimes." Atlas said mockingly as John and Sherlock looked at her rather bemused. The rest of the room watched on in curiosity waiting for Sherlock's lightbulb moment of recognition. No-one had a clue of what it would be but Sherlock would remember. The memory must currently be stored in the recycling bin.
"I'll get her." Sherlock said pulling up to park outside the cottage. It was called Otter Lodge and had a river at the bottom of the garden that no doubt the girls would play in with the dog.
"Plus I really need to ask your friend a question." Atlas added as Sherlock reluctantly opened the door the entire room finally being revealed. Collected dust lingered on many surfaces and Atlas grimaced as she smelt hair burning. Round the corner she could just see some sort of chemical compound in the middle of being formed and she smiled. Maybe this was the right place to come looking.
"She was shot!" Sherlock near shouted, his eyes opening fast. "She was shot." He repeated quieter, John taking up his hand instead. "Her own mother shot her and she was shot where Mrs Pertwee was holding her fingers."
"I get days like these too," Sherlock whispered before Atlas sat up, turned around and hugged his middle.
"Doesn't matter," Sherlock said before he looked at Atlas and went onto his knees. "I've got you, duck. I've always got you."
WHEN she came to, she was on the sofa in the living room, weighted blanket on top of her and a quiet house.
"No, dad, please don't think I'm trying to stop you. I'm going to help you," Atlas said before he pulled her into his side and kissed her hair.
"Mr Holmes!" The man yelled again, his face red with sweat and exhaustion. "Mr Holmes! It's been reported that this is your daughter. What do you say to these claims?"
"Okay," Sherlock said before she just about skipped away into the hallway and disappeared into the bathroom.
"I know sweetheart." John sighed stroking her forehead. "I don't know how to help you understand. It's really complicated." Then he paused. There was a way to help, that she would no doubt ask further questions on at a later date. "Your mother died saving your dad..." John paused looking down to his sheets. "Because I loved him and love him..." An intake of breath. "More."
"About our friend who's been wrongly treated for, well since she got here." Sammy said exasperatedly, signing as he went so Xerxes knew what he was saying.
"Your parents are coming tommorow." Atlas announced after she was sure John had finished. John looked at her as if to say 'How?'
She slept for ages, head back on the pillow. Doped up on a huge amount of pain medication, she was out to the world, her collar bone covered. Sherlock's hand brushed her temple gently, removing some stray hairs.
"Atlas, listen to me, they never went home," Dr Aduba smiled. "They are sitting in the family room."
"Hey," John said back looking up to give a tired smile then putting his head back against Sherlock's shoulder. "We have space to keep one lot now, Sherlock." There was a pause. "If you'd like to."
"Here," John said quietly from the door. "Your going to need this." He said holding up a spray bottle to his partner. "50/50 vinegar water solution and a little bit of detergent, and baking powder." He produced the tub of rising agent in his other hand.
"Yeah, I asked dad before. That's all he said. Asked Atlas. That's all she said. And they both said that I had to have the story told by you and no-one else." Rosie said wriggling on the bed then looking back up at her papa.
"She wasn't saying anything." Abayomi protested, before shrinking with a glare from Atlas. Her eyes said
Sherlock sat up abruptly and began to blush a deep red. Atlas giving a laugh before Sherlock gulped, nodded.
"Long or short?" Sherlock asked, wrapping an arm around her shoulder. He rubbed with his thumb and she looked at him.
THE following morning, everyone had returned to their beds, Atlas staying awake downstairs with the dog. She still had physio call that she really didn't want to go to but now, as she sat stroking the dog, she supposed it couldn't be that bad.
"Shh, shhh, alright Sherlock. It is what it is." John said as Sherlock cried. "Now, why don't we go finish our wine and watch the northern lights some more?"
"Okay. We'll see about going to get them in a moment." Sammy smiled before he sat with Atlas for another few minutes. She only continued to sob.
"Yes. And I'm going to force you to listen to me. You are the most human human I have ever met and you have the biggest heart." John laughed before Sherlock gave one of his proper smiles. One of those ones that lit up the darkest of rooms and the darkest of moments. That was contagious and only made John smile in return.
Once they got outside Sherlock and Atlas stopped by a bench and they sat down, away from some streetlights and looked up.
"My," Rosie whined as he slipped an arm around her shoulder. Then she put her face against him. "My."
"Hands, papa." She said before John put out his hands and she assessed them. They may be in some unknown place but she needed to check that her father wasn't in pain. Father. She smiled to herself before analysing his hands carefully. Before long she had pulled out various splinters that had occurred in his hands and checked the blisters - painful but John said he could manage them.
"We're going to the van hire. Normally, a van would mean movement of large objects. So we're going to the storage unit that is filled with things left to you by family members. Once there we collect various items. However, I assume we're hiring a large van so then we will go over to Homebase because I assume - from the amount of texts you've received - you've been building an army. So we're going to be doing up the rooms, with the help of our friends and family. It should take approximately a week to do everything - of which I will drag Abayomi, my new friend, and Sammy with me to help. I know they won't spill it all to John." Atlas paused, looked skyward.
"Don't try to do anything stupid with it," John warned before she nodded. "Now come on, I'll butter your scone for you." He stood up and reached our his hand. "Come on." But she shook her head. "Come on, love." In the end, he sat down on the bed and Sherlock came into the bedroom.
to give back. Hale placed a candle and lit it before placing a framed picture of the society on the scarf. Sammy stepped forward and squatted down before placing a notepad that Abayomi had doodled in. Then, Atlas stepped forward and dropped down. She placed a paintbrush and wiped at the tears falling on her cheeks. Stepping back, Sammy looped an arm around her shoulder as May took her turn, placing a multi-picture picture frame.
"She's not dreaming," Sherlock said quietly. "She's having a nightmare." He got up from her seated position just as Atlas began to sob and writhe in the bed slightly.
"Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. It fits the Holmes'." Rosie finished. At a tender age of four she could already recite a number of books, poetry, short stories, plays and authors. As if she has enhanced memory. It then became apparent that it was he first words to most that sat around the table. They tried not to make a big deal of it, but they became ecstatic. It also became apparent at the fast becoming
"There aren't any books. How can people be so comfortable with that?" Atlas complained about a smirk.
John sat in silence, awaiting for her to continue. "I lost a baby." She blinked a few times. "A few months back and ever since then, the alcohol has looked
"This afternoon, she had a seizure and didn't regain any consciousness" Mycroft informed quickly as she continued to seize. His fingers folded over his mouth as he watched her fingers opening and shutting, her neck stretched and tensed.
"Yes, I looked properly." Sherlock replied sharply, Atlas only shrinking into her seat even more. Chest constricted, suffocation. She felt like she was drowning. Her eyes flitted over the room, landing on some adoption papers. Adoption papers? Her eyes strained to see the names inscribed but she did. She saw them, a pang hitting her chest. Sherlock was adopting Rosie. Not exactly unexpected, she did call him Dad after all. Nonetheless, something was hurting, deep down in her stomach making her feel sick. She was getting left behind again, adding just another thing to the list of things on her mind.
When he arrived he made his way upstairs to the room where Atlas was. She was sat on the bed, hastily pulling on her boots and tying them or trying to at least but she was shaking.
"It's how you speak when you don't know how to explain it." John added helpfully, face still hidden by the book. "You both do it. Bach on days that you either don't want to talk or what your feeling is complicated. Pretty Chopin on soft and romantic days - days like those I can get hugs. Sad Chopin on sad days. The composers you play belong to the emotions you feel whether you guys believe it or not, they are. Your father's right Atlas, have the best you can get. And let him do it for you."
"We can't protect her." John sighed, a hand running over his mouth. "And that's the impossibly difficult fact."
"I'll love you, no matter what you do. And I've always loved you." Sherlock said, John nodding before they gave each other a much needed hug.
"I was going to pop out and see if we can get some takeaway food from the Tesco just around the corner," John smiled, as Rosie looked up at him. "Are you wanting to come with me Rosie?"
So this whole story is pretty rubbish to be honest. Inaccurate to the characters, real life situations but it is what it is. If you can stand that, then hang around.
"Had a panic attack." John's voice came as he stood in the doorway, he looked over to Sherlock with his face still in Mycroft's shoulder.
"And Atlas so lovely to see you too." Wanda said as she took Atlas into an unsuspecting hug. However, she didn't shy away from it, she seemed to be okay. Timothy soon joined his wife in greeting his son and granddaughter as Wanda moved on to meet John.
"I'm angry with how selfish your being," John said before he shut the door completely on Sherlock and Peter and took her into the spare room that was being lit by the moonlight. "There's a point when it's appropriate-"
"Oh, look at her," Aunt Isla crooned. "John," She said looking at him. "She's beautiful." There was a pause. "And he's beautiful."
"Ro," Sherlock said as she came over to him. "I bought some fruit, do you want some?" She nodded, sucking her bottom lip with her teeth. "Stop sucking your lip, sweetheart." Rosie pushed her lip out and smiled at him.
One of them came toward him grinning.  He held a sharpened pipe.  Sherlock tried to move, he really did, but the chains on his arms and the demons holding his legs made it impossible.  The demon grinned.  “Let’s play, angel,” he sneered.  Sherlock breathed through his nose, hard and fast.  The demon laughed.  And Sherlock did scream as the metal pipe plunged through his stomach, impaling him, rather cleanly.
Mycroft didn't go home for nearly three days after that, until Sherlock all but kicked him out the window.  What he actually did, was banish Mycroft outside the flat, and refused to let the protections down to let him back in again, and eventually Mycroft had texted John, told him to keep Sherlock out of trouble and to call him if there was more incidents, and gone home.  Sherlock was extremely pleased with himself for the rest of the day.
He fought back when he could.  Striking out with whatever he could get his hands on, or, more often, just his hands.  Moriarty would laugh when he managed to strike a demon.  Or the wraith even.  Sherlock hated Moriarty’s laughter, more than anything.
Moriarty took another blade from out of nowhere, pressed himself tight against Sherlock once more.  He touched the blade to nipple, made a small cut.  Sherlock moaned.  Moriarty laughed.  He cut, with the knife at Sherlock’s now exposed armpits, digging the blade in nearly to the hilt, seeming to relish the cry.  John hissed slightly, watching the knife appear between the bones of the shoulder and collar bone.  Moriarty pulled it away, and then placed it, blade side first, against Sherlock’s chest.  He pressed a kiss at his neck.
"No," muttered John.  "Sherlock  don't you dare," he added, pushing the thought toward his friend with all his might, but Sherlock ignored him, and pushed slightly.  And there was a loud
Raphael is the angel of Healing, but...he's also an archangel, at least according to a lot of sources, not only Supernatural, so I figured he'd be busy.  Either doing arch angel stuff or being a dick, depending on whatever you want.
“Hello,” he said again.  Sherlock didn’t say anything.  But then…he didn’t say much of anything lately.  He approached slowly, almost as slowly as he had approached John the first time.  Lestrade flinched slightly as Sherlock reached up to touch his face, to test it.  The flinch was enough.  False Lestrade wouldn’t flinch.  False Lestrade would press closer, would smirk, and taunt.  Still, Sherlock touched his fingers to Lestrade’s face anyway.  Just because he could.  And because he could tell that he was making Lestrade uncomfortable, and that was a little amusing.
Footsteps and then Mycroft was there and how strange was that?  Was he joining in now?  Where was…Sherlock couldn't breathe.  He was disoriented and frightened.  Mycroft was saying something to him, hands on Sherlock's bony shoulders.  And then Mycrofts' face blurred and morphed into blackness again.
“Some would argue that blackmailing another into allowing himself to be kidnapped and tortured is cheating too,” he snarled.  Moriarty shoved the pipe he’d removed through Sherlock’s abdomen.
Sherlock just stared at her.  “True, Molly,” he murmured, touching her face lightly, cupping it with one hand.  “Real.”  She froze.  Sherlock was acting very oddly.  She still was only have sure he was there, and the trick with the tray wasn’t helping.  But his hand on her face…that was so very real.
“They’re gone.”  He lifted a hand and cupped Sherlock’s face.  “I am real, Sherlock.  I swear I am real.”
The following day, once more, he was whipped, and the demons were then allowed to have their fun.  One shoved him over and another turned the floor where he landed into a bed of pins.  The others liked this idea so much that they started making pins, and then nails start popping up all over the floor, making him jump to avoid them.  They’d shoot up if he stayed in the same place for more than a second.  He tried to climb the bars if the cage, but these two developed spikes, making him fall.  Over and over, all night it lasted.  Where were they getting their power?  He couldn’t think, but he
Sometimes the pokers the demons came in with were hot, glowing from the heat of a fire.  It didn’t take long for his feet to be burned, for them to work their way up his legs, to his buttocks and cock, to stomach—they had fun carving angel repelling wounds there, until Moriarty reminded them that he could still be affected by them, and they stopped, moving on to poke and burn Sherlock’s under arms and neck.
Sherlock cowered in the corner of the cage.  What was the point in fighting?  He was tired of hurting, tired of making things worse for himself.  It was better…to simply let things happen.  Except…it didn’t work like that either.  Because he was also terrified.  All the time, terrified.  He didn’t know what was real.  Unless it hurt.  If there was pain, he knew it was real.  It was impossible to fabricate pain.  At least, pain like this.  And he wanted to feel, and he was terrified of what new horrors would come for him when that cage door opened, and so he screamed when it did.  He pleaded.  Begged.  Nothing worked, of course….
It took him most of the night, but John realized that Sherlock had been trying to let John know that it was
John was seated somewhat awkwardly on the bed when Lestrade entered the room with Mycroft.  Sherlock was inspecting his fingers as though he’d never seen them before and wasn’t entirely sure what they did.  Sherlock’s head snapped up.  He stared at Lestrade, unblinking.  “Hello,” said Lestrade uncertainly.  Sherlock glanced at Mycroft.
.  We ask.  We cannot take a human vessel without permission from the human him or herself.”  Sally looked read to ask another furious question, but Lestrade put a hand on her shoulder.
the deaths of his friends to…break Sherlock.”  He swallowed.  “I’ve got some…angels trying to heal him.  He…doesn’t trust us.  He knows we are who we appear to be, I think.  Moriarty liked to….create illusions of being one of you, and Mrs Hudson sometimes, or Miss Hooper, on occasion…”
"  And John wrapped his arms around Sherlock, and held him close, closing his eyes.  He never wanted to see that lost, distraught expression.  Not ever again.
I have decided that Sherlock and Mycroft are their angelic names as well, for making things easier, but if I had to pick 'angelic' names for them, I'd go with Gazardiel (angel of new beginnings and All Knowing) for Mycroft, and Hamaliel (angel of Logic and Orderly Thinking) for Sherlock.
“Hurts,” whispered Sherlock.  His eyes darted from Mycroft to John again.  Mycroft…definitely real.  Definitely Mycroft.  And Mycroft wouldn’t be fooled. And Mycroft wouldn't lie, would he?
“Um…Sherlock?” she asked, quietly.  “Does…does John know you are here?  Alive I mean?”  Sherlock looked up at his name, blinked at John’s.  Slowly, he tilted his head to the side.  He wasn’t sure how to answer that.  He didn’t move.  She tried again.  “He knows…you are alive?”  He slowly nodded.  “He…knows where you are?”  Sherlock shook his head.  “Can…can we call him?” she asked.  He tilted his head to the side again.  She could do what she wanted really.  He was calm again.  Unafraid.  “I’m going to call him, alright?”  He didn’t answer, just turned back to the body again.
“Something in him…has broken, as we stated.  And he still…rather believes that everything is a trick.  We hope to get through to him soon.  I must go back to him,” he said, straightening his tie.  And he was gone.   The three humans stared at the spot where Mycroft had vanished.
This troubled him a bit, but not enough to dwell on it.  Because suddenly the hell hounds were there, tearing the netting off his wings, the small rings pulling bits of feather and flesh with them.  He screamed.  The smell was terrible.  Moriarty had a habit of hosing him down every night.  Either with freezing or with scalding water, depending on his mood.  And it always hurt, pressing him against the bars of the cage, nearly drowning him.  But it also ensured he and the cage were fairly clean for the next round of tortures.  The water washed away any blood or waste.
The warehouse was decrepit.  Sherlock hadn’t even known it existed.  On the outskirts of the city, near the Thames, the abandoned building was well removed from everything.   “And don’t think screaming will help you.  I’ve warded the place.  Even your true voice won’t alert the humans, should any happen by.”  He shoved Sherlock into the warehouse.  There was a twinge inside him, a dull thumping and a pain in his chest.  Moriarty was grinning at him.  He said a few words, too low and fast for Sherlock to hear them, and suddenly, the pain was intense.  He fell to his knees, gasping.  It hurt.  Sherlock was a bit too stunned to even really feel the pain at first.  “Isn’t that something?” gloated Moriarty.  “I’ve learned things.  Very interesting things, when I fell.  I’ve just muted your grace,” he laughed.  “You will feel
John sat in a rather uncomfortable arm chair, journal resting on his lap.  It felt wrong somehow.  He touched it with shaking hands, and, almost unwillingly opened it.
Sherlock, he’d tell them, had been getting often less than an hour of sleep a night.  After more than two years of nearly 24 hour a day torture, he told them to be patient.  It would take a while for him to heal, even a little.  And so it had been two months, and John hadn’t seen him.  No one had.
It is going to go back and forth with Sherlock's recovery process, and the tortures he faced under Moriarty.
“You are excused.”  The three gave him a quick nod and filed out of the room.  “Dina, do check on how Isda** is doing with Sherlock, will you?”  Ameriel nodded, and closed the door behind her.
The warehouse was almost frightening looking.  Lestrade had told him to go to the second story.  The smell hit him immediately.  It smelled of sulfur, but also of urine and excrement.   The first thing he saw was the cage.  Three sided, the fourth attached to the concrete wall.  The second thing he noticed was the dead man inside the cage, impeccable suit stained slightly, but not much, with blood, what looked like a sword of some kind sticking out of his neck.  The third and last thing he noticed was the one he was trying the most not to look at--something alive and in the cage.  It was hunched over in the corner, humanoid, but for the two wings arching from it’s back, through the bars of the cage, pinned to the wall with knives.  Its hands were shackled close together. There was a collar around its neck, and a chain reaching from the collar to the wall.  The creature was naked and shaking, and dirty, skeletal in frame, crouched in a tiny ball, face hidden.  Yet John had a terrible feeling he knew what…who, it was.  A look at Lestrade confirmed it.
But it's got Mycroft!  And John and Sally and Greg and Anthea aka Dina!  So.  Anyway, I figured John and crew needed to learn a bit more about Sherlock's past, because then certain things wouldn't make sense to them and the needed to learn them anyway.
Sherlock crouched next to the wall, hands chained.  One wing hung awkwardly next to him, the other was pinned to the wall, sticking through the bars of the cage.  The door banged and Sherlock pressed himself against the wall, hands going to his head.  “No, no, no, nonononono…” he began to moan.  Whatever had broken him had already happened, John realized.  The thought made him sick.  He hadn’t seen Sherlock broken in these visions before.  He’d seen him beaten bloody, tortured with visions, but always fighting back, always with hatred in his eyes.  This time…he was just terrified.
Moriarty’s other hand drifted down, finger sliding along the length of Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock shivered.  “You don’t want me,” murmured Moriarty.  “You want John.  But if he’s dead…you won’t have anyone to hope for.”  Sherlock froze.  He muttered something that sounded like ‘promise’.  Moriarty leaned in close.  “I lied,” he whispered.  “You think what I’ve done to you is unpleasant?  Watch me to it to
The fourth dream was a few months later.  Sherlock had just stared at him, he looked beaten, coat torn, face bloody.  He couldn’t be cajoled to speak at all. He just stared at John.  It was the most unnerving dream he’d had yet.  Though this time, he woke before the black smoke pulled Sherlock away.  These weren’t
," whispered the demon in Sherlock’s ear.  “So very, very tight.”  His fingers left bruises on Sherlock’s hips.
The room started to swim again, spinning into blackness, until all John could hear was the sick sound of metal hitting flesh and then nothing but the banging of metal clubs on the bars.
After these dreams, Moriarty would stand, gloating at him.  “Well, Sherlock?” he crowed.  “Enjoying your sleep?  See anything interesting?”  And Sherlock raised an eyebrow at him, the beginnings of a sneer.
John swallowed, feeling like he was going to throw up as Moriarty-as-John edged up Sherlock’s neck, his jaw…and pressing his lips against Sherlock’s.  And Sherlock…just accepted it.
“Shit,” was John’s comment.  He’d realized Sherlock was going to do something stupid quite quickly after he noticed him standing by the pond.  He seemed to be talking with a young boy who had chased a football over to where Sherlock was, and that was odd in and of itself.  Sherlock had been mostly confining himself to one word answers, though occasionally, he said more.  He never spoke to strangers.  Maybe the fact that it was a child…John watched, stunned into stillness when Sherlock put his finger into his mouth, tasting the water.  And when he turned around, John had a horrible feeling that he knew what Sherlock was going to do.  He stood and started walking.  Sherlock seemed to know, and he started moving faster.  “No!” he called.  Too late.  The pond was perfect and clean.  Probably not a trace of pollution in it at all.  And there were fish.  “Shit.”  He ignored the boy.
Sherlock didn’t seem to be listening anymore, not having judged Lestrade a threat, and instead seemed to be trying to unravel the blanket.  John sat on the bed, and lifted Sherlock’s hands.  Sherlock’s fingers curled automatically around John’s.  He brought the captured hands up to his face, and sniffed at them a little, before dropping them.  He ran his hands through his hair and stood again, moving from the bed to the window.  Lestrade looked a bit at a loss.
.  Of course not.  Still, it wasn’t something he thought Sherlock would think of.  He sighed.  Then looked at the boy, who was still looking at Sherlock like he was magic.  Which, John supposed he was.  “Don’t tell anyone,” he said, tiredly.  The boy looked up at John.
It was impossible to give him a shirt.  Even without the left over memories of torture, his wings were still in horrible shape.  And he couldn’t…hide them, couldn’t return them to the proper plane.  Mycroft couldn’t do it himself, and Sherlock lacked to presence of mind.    So blankets, at first, and even after, were provided in lieu of clothing.  They were often abandoned, or vanished out of existence by a frightened or distraught Sherlock.
Sherlock groaned, and sunk to a low crouch.  “Why?” he muttered.  “Why, he…I don’t think he could…and dead now, dead.  But tricking…always with tricks, and John and…I can’t…”  He didn’t seem to be able to hold onto a thought, just muttering and sometimes giving out a little scream as he seemed to see something John couldn’t.    It was the longest vision Sherlock had sent him, though it did start speeding up slightly.  Things bled together, and paused as Sherlock let out a scream.  A window broke. He wrapped his arms around his legs.  And Sherlock waited for the next trick, for the next bout of pain.  Because, though he could see Moriarty, dead on the floor, it wasn’t real.  It was never real.  And so he waited.  He waited for Moriarty to drag him back to the real world, from where he would never, ever escape.
Moriarty had sighed.  Then snapped his fingers.  Four demons appeared, eyes black, mouths open in delighted grins.  They’d entered the cage and pulled the knives from his wings.  He’d struggled, but twin knives slashed at his arms and chest and he was rather easily moved.  The collar around his neck was still attached to the wall, and it almost immediately began choking him as the demons tied his arms, to the sides of the cage.  The collar had small, cruel teeth that bit into Sherlock’s neck with any sudden movement and he gagged.  There was a snap, and then, more slack in the chain.  He was surprised, but not for long.
any hallucinations of her, apart from that first one, so long ago it was more a dream than anything else.  “Real,” he murmured again.
Lately...he'd been organizing his mind palace.  Making sure he wouldn't...descend into madness like that again.
” and with a flick of his hand and a few new words….words Sherlock didn’t understand, there was a terrible ripping and tearing, and he screamed as his wings were made to manifest.  He hadn’t even known that was possible.  Apparently it was.  He writhed on the floor, tearing at his back.  His shirt was torn where the wings had been forced through it, hanging off his back in shreds.  He managed to push himself to his knees, when he noticed a large black blur heading for him.  Then everything went dark.
“Don’t tell me what to do brother dear,” he said.  “You know how cross it makes me.”  Sherlock struggled against the chains, choking in pain.
James it seemed…never forgave Sherlock for betraying him.  For telling the Host what he knew, and what he guessed, of Lucifer’s plans.  He felt that Sherlock had taken everything away from him, all his dreams of power, and of domination.  So…he waited.  Waited for Sherlock to have something that Jim could threaten and then…take.”  He looked at John.
“D’ya ever talk, ‘cept in one word?” he demanded.  Sherlock didn’t know what to say to that, so he said nothing, just tilted his head and started at the boy, before turning his attention back to the ball again.  He knew this.  Something to do with a body part.  “S’gross ya know,” said the boy, and Sherlock assumed he was back on the topic of the water.  Humans jumped tracks so quickly.  “My mum says that even the fish in this pond die.”  Sherlock frowned.  That didn’t sound good at all.  And he knew from his taste of the water that it was definitely bad.  He heard John stand, start walking over.  He had about a minute before he arrived.  So he had to work fast.  He turned and crouched.  John was running now.  Sherlock placed his whole hand in the pond, and just as John yelled for him to stop, the pond cleared, no sign of green gunk anywhere.  There were even a few fish.  Sherlock had transported them from a nearby pet store, which was probably bad, but the fish preferred not to be in glass boxes anyway.
"You know what's gonna happen next," she whispered.  "He's gonna crack those ribs wiiiiiiiiiiide open.  And play with your insides."  Sherlock whimpered.  The demons looked at each other with obvious pleasure.  And then Sherlock was screaming again as his ribs were cracked open and pushed wide.  He wasn't screaming for long, as blackness overtook him.
.  That it wasn’t some false hallucination or someone simply pretending.  That he was offering John the chance to prove it to himself, like Sherlock did for John every time.  He felt a little bad now, for not mapping Sherlock’s face, as Sherlock had done to him.  John didn’t need to, he knew Sherlock was real, but Sherlock…John didn’t think he understood that.
**Remliel and Sariel are the angels of Awakening, and Guidance and Healing respectively.  There is another, called Saruek, that I might use later.  I figure Mycroft could have gotten some of the lesser angels to help him out.
Everything tightened, and he was pulled back onto the floor of their sitting room again.  He was crying.  He couldn’t breathe.  He felt arms around him, and he clutched at Sherlock.  This felt wrong.  Backwards.  He should be comforting Sherlock.  Though after what he had just seen….he doubted he would be very comforting at all.  It was amazing Sherlock trusted him at all.
“I want to stop but…I have to know what happened you know?  What he went through…how can we understand the recovery if we don’t understand what happened yeah?”
The sixth dream came in conjunction with a phone call.  In the dream, Sherlock didn’t appear at all, just his voice, screaming out for John.  For Mycroft.  Over and over in his head.  John had been roused out of bed, throwing on clothes.  He felt pulled in a way he couldn’t explain, hailing a cab, and telling him turn by turn where to go.  Then Lestrade had called, sounding shaken and terrified.  He refused to explain over the phone, just gave John the address, told him to get there.  John told him that he was already on his way.
The whip, therefore, in its first appearance, was a surprise.  He’d yelled and stood, and Moriarty was there with a whip in his had.  Sherlock’s shoulder had split.
Right.  Things get worse in the next chapter.  I needed to set up the Sharing system Sherlock's got going on with John, and now that I've done that....I can bring Sherlock to his breaking point.
John was allowed to see him four months after Sherlock was found.  He was sitting on the bed, cross legged, not really looking at anything.  His wings dipped up and down, though they mostly remained pulled tight around him.  “Sherlock,” said Mycroft quietly.  “John is here.”  Sherlock’s spine stiffened.  He looked up, saw John standing hesitantly next to Mycroft.  Sherlock’s eyes widened, his throat tightened.  He propelled himself off the bed toward the wall, shaking slightly.  “Sherlock it…it really is me.”  Sherlock made a scoffing noise.
Sherlock stiffened suddenly, then shivered.  He put both hands on his forehead, and sank to a low crouch.  John swallowed.  He moved forward.  Lestrade looked ready to ask a question, but the words caught in his throat as John knelt, and took Sherlock’s wrists.  Sherlock tilted his head, pressing his forehead against John’s.  Both of their eyes closed.  It lasted all of two minutes, and then Sherlock opened his eyes, and stood, facing the window again.  John stood slower, looking pale and ragged.
It was a day out.  They hadn’t had one of those….in a long time.  John hadn’t had once since even before Sherlock was found, and certainly not after.  But Sherlock had wanted to go out for some time, and Mycroft had deemed him well enough, and they found themselves in the nearby park.  Sherlock had almost immediately relieved himself of shoes and socks and started wandering about the grass.  It was a little concerning to John, that someone might recognize him.  But he didn’t really look the same.  He was subdued, in a way he’d never been before.  He didn’t have the coat anymore, and certainly not the hat.  John watched him carefully, as he wandered around the park.
“We are still looking sir.  We have found a selection of tapes and journals, detailing the events of the past two and a half years.” She set a box on the desk.  Two more dark suited men followed her and set two more boxes on the desk.  “It seems he was fastidious in chronicling everything he did.”  Mycroft picked up the first journal.  He set his jaw.
He was tied down on a cold metal slab.    His wrists and feet were bound with leather cuffs, inscribed with sigils to render an angel at full power weak.  It was unnecessary on him, but it did his job.  He could feel what little power he had left being muted, stifled.  He struggled briefly, but a cruel looking man grinned down at him, eyes white and gleaming.  It seemed that Moriarty had pulled some strings to get hell's most proficient torturer here.
They left, half reluctantly and half relieved.  John hated feeling like he wanted to leave Sherlock but it was honestly draining.  And he felt so
The second dream had come six months after that.  He’d been in the flat again, when Sherlock’s disapproving tones pierced his thoughts.  “Really?  The flat again? This is the first place he’ll look.”  John’s head had snapped up, and Sherlock was sitting in his chair, looking distinctly more disheveled than the last time.  He was tired, and he moved gingerly.  He still wore the coat, as though he didn’t know it was August.  Then of course, John remembered it was a dream.  That it didn’t matter what season it was, because Sherlock wasn’t there.  Still, it felt like he was.  John felt questions bubbling up, past his lips.
…Moriarty didn’t fuck him anymore.  He left it up to others.  To the demons mostly.  It was never quite as bad as it had been.  Though two at once, was a bit…much.  They usually chained him to the side of the cage, or to the roof of it.  Once, they cut him down early, and his kneecaps smashed into the floor.  The demon in front of him lowered it’s pants.  “Suck” it said.  “An’ if you bite, I’ll do the same to John while you watch.  Then I’ll kill ‘im.”  And so Sherlock had taken the man’s cock in his mouth and sucked until his jaw was screaming and his throat burning.  And then, hot liquid spurting in his mouth.  He choked, and a hand covered his mouth.  “You swallow.  You swallow or it’s the same as if you bit.”  Sherlock had done as instructed, though he was dimly aware of a part of his mind screaming.  But he couldn’t really reach that part anymore.  Easier to do what he was told….
Sherlock would get up, slowly, and make his way toward John, sending looks to Mycroft.  He’d carefully brush his fingers on John’s face, re-learning it every time.  Occasionally, he lifted one of John’s hands and smelled it.  During the third month, Sherlock started to put John’s hand on his own face, after smelling it.  John did nothing the first time, and Sherlock refused to speak to him the rest of the time.
The demons gripped the chains on the shackles, and threaded the chains through the hoops on the wall above him, hoisting his arms above his head.  He knelt on the floor, gasping.  The metal brace across his chest burned.  His wings cramped and all but screamed to be released.  Moriarty knelt in front of him.  “Sorry Sherlock.  Don’t really like you fighting all that much.  Higher please.”  They pulled on the chains, jerking him up by the arms so he was forced into an awkward crouch.  “There is good,” said Moriarty.  “We’ll be back shortly.”   It was two days.  During that time he didn’t see anyone, though occasionally the chains would jerk his arms up, or something would kick his legs out from under him, dislocating both shoulders.
The wings might have been physical now, but what little grace he had still hummed in them, and it was more than just bone and feathers that hit the demons.  There was still enough grace in him to hurt them.  Angela tried to use her fire poker, but he batted it away.  It hurt, but at least she didn’t have it anymore.  He settled into a slightly more secure fighting stance.  He was exhausted, and he didn’t know how long he could keep this up, but at least he could try.  He was still an angel.  And he would fight until his last breath.
"The girl is fine," he grumbled.  "Happy, not broken.  Good with singing.  Nothing to fix."  He grabbed John and with a flap of invisible wings and a rush of air, they were back at Baker Street.  John stumbled, coughing.  He hated that method of travel.  Sherlock had collapsed on the floor.
“You’ll want to be careful about what you say, Sherlock dear,” he whispered, silkily.  Sherlock spat on him.
Sherlock learned things about demons too.  He learned that they liked iron.  And they liked especially, to send it crashing across his face.  Moriarty though, seemed to like his face.  More so than the rest of his body, which was only healed when it was broken nearly beyond repair, and even then, thick scars roped around it, covering back, stomach, legs.  His face though, Moriarty healed with almost no scarring every time.
angel?” taunted the demon, picking up another long metal pipe.  This one went through his shoulder.  The demons holding his legs took the opportunity to start pulling on the pipes, letting go of his legs in the process.  He managed to kick one as it pulled down on the pipe in his shoulder.  It squealed furiously, and the next pipe went into his leg.
Moriarty moved fast, forcing the other wing to spread, slamming the knife home.  Sherlock screamed.  And then Moriarty, still looking like John, was pressed up against Sherlock.  He rolled his hips slightly, pressing against Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock whimpered slightly.  “Hands up,” sung Moriarty.  Sherlock didn’t move.  John was not sure where the riding crop came from.  He assumed it had been conjured.  “Get. Your. Hands. In. The. Air.
Dina rubbed her eyes.  Today’s video had been one of the worst yet.  Apparently, James hadn’t heard that trepanning* had been outdated thousands of years ago.  Still, he had seemed to relish placing the metal band around Sherlock’s head, and placing all sorts of metal objects…from ice picks to cork screws, and drilling holes into his skull.  After a while, Sherlock stopped screaming.  He’d left the band around Sherlock’s head for a long time, tapping at it, pulling at various metal handles, twisting a few in deeper.  Dina made careful notes about where each device was inserted, and about how far.  She went to find John and Lestrade as well, to see if maybe James had made a note of it in the journals.  Lestrade had the journal describing it, but it only said that he’d twisted metal objects into Sherlock’s head, some likely delving into the brain itself, but that he had been healed afterward.  There was no mention of how deep things had gone, or if it
He finally managed to hide his wings.  He supposed that meant they were healthy again, than he could slip them away, out of reach of human perception.  That was good.  They still worked then.  And he didn’t have to worry about hurting them again.  John was pleased too, he could tell.  Because it meant that maybe things could be normal again.  Even if he still wasn’t talking much.  And Sherlock didn’t want to disillusion him.  Maybe because he too wanted to think that things could be normal again.  He’d almost forgotten what hope felt like.
He pointed at him, and, reminiscent of the dream, began to laugh.  “False! You won’t trick me again,” he declared, “False, false falsefalsefalsefalse…” he kept going, slipping into a crouch, rocking, pulling at his hair.
“Um…” she said,  “Yes.  I’m real.  And…so are you?”  He took the tray, set it on the table, and took her hand, putting it against his own face.  As he had with John.  She still hardly believed he was there.  So she moved her hands over it carefully.  She moved her hands carefully, slowly, over the scars on his shoulders and torso and arms, glancing up to his face on occasion, to make sure it was still alright.  He didn’t move, just watched her, relieved.  She was real.  She had always been real.  There hadn’t
I might put more about the War of the Fall, as I've decided to call it later.  About why Sherlock left etc.  As sort of little anecdotes provided by Mycroft or James.
In the fifth dream, almost exactly two years after his disappearance, they were in the flat again, Sherlock lay on the floor, curled up in a ball.  He caught sight of John and started to laugh, loud, hysterical laughs that turned into screams.  Nothing John did could calm him. This time, the black smoke didn’t drag Sherlock back.  A massive, hideous dog did.  It slashed at Sherlock’s chest with a paw, then grabbed him round the shoulder with its mouth started to shake him frantically, as though it meant to tear him apart,  and both disappeared.  It was the worst dream John had ever had, and he woke smelling blood.
Sherlock Holmes had been missing, presumed dead for more than two years.  A few people had never stopped searching.
Sherlock had been at Mycroft’s home.    Recovering.  John only knew what Mycroft had told him about Sherlock’s healing.  No one was allowed to visit Sherlock.  Not after what had happened in the warehouse.  John was going nearly out of his mind.  Mycroft met with him and Lestrade fairly regularly.  John and Lestrade would compare notes about the journals.  Mycroft would listen impassively.  He was watching the tapes.   He was getting through them at incredible pace.
Lights.  Lights and sound and something moving and everything was blurring together.  And then all at once, it stopped.  Everything was dark.  Still.  There was just….nothing.
Sherlock stared at John’s face, trying to see.  Tricks?  He didn’t know, he couldn’t tell.  He shuddered, trying to think.  He couldn’t think.  He couldn’t see.  Couldn’t trust what he could see, or hear.  Mycroft.  He glanced to Mycroft and back to John.  Mycroft said John was real.  John was…John was his friend.  He’d do anything for John—and hadn’t he?  Two years…Mycroft said it was more than two years.   Two and half years, no grace, that’s why he was….black thoughts roiled in his mind and he pushed them away.  No.  Thinking would only make things worse.
“Careful,” he said.  “Make her drink.”  The water would heal the girl.  “Quickly,” he added, gesturing for the boy to go, now.  He dropped the football where he stood and started running.
Sherlock leaned against John and clutched at his shirt, closing his eyes.  He could feel the warmth, the concern, the love, rolling off of John.  He could feel how much John believed what he was saying.  Not broken, not shattered.  Just a bit cracked.  And he was getting better.
Like I said, if people want more stories in the universe, I will write some.  I am not married to it either, and if people are inspired...that's wonderful.  I would like to be linked, obviously, if people use this story as an inspiration or what have you, but...mostly, I wouldn't mind seeing more stories of this type at all.  I love the Sherlock!Angel idea.  I don't see enough of it.  And I love Sherlock!Whump.
“What was it that time?”  John just shook his head, and Lestrade didn’t ask again.  He didn’t really want to know.  The men just stood and watched Sherlock for a long time.  Mycroft re-entered the room.  He always looked tired nowadays.  John supposed it had something to do with caring for Sherlock as well as continuing to try and run the British Government.  Some things just became habit, he thought.  A job like Mycroft’s would be one of them.
John blinked at him, nonplussed.  “Oh.  Right.  Well…he is telling me now.  So, I guess that means Baker Street.”
"Oh, I am so sorry."  She coughed slightly, then looked back at the tree to change the subject.  "It's a shame, what's happened to that tree.  It died about three years ago.  Well.  Started dying.  They're going to cut it down.  I grew up with that tree though."  She sighed.  "It's at least a hundred years old.  Lot of history there."  She sighed again, recalling picnics, stolen kisses, a tire swing that had long since been removed.  Sherlock glanced over at them.  John stood suddenly, and Sherlock turned and put both hands on the rough bark.  "Is he going to try and push it over?" the woman asked, bemused.
"We know." Sherlock whispered reaching out a hand to brush her hair out of her eyes. "Would you like it, if I brush your hair?"
"Papa?" A little tired voice squeaked out from the big open archway into the lobby. "What's going on?" Her blue eyes were sparkling in the light and her hair was all over the place. Jeff was clutched to her chest like he normally was and John just stayed there. He didn't know how to reply or anything. How could he explain something so confusing to a five year old when he himself was confused?
"About twelve miles away but if we go now," Harry said, glancing at her watch. "We should make it back before more of our guests appear."
"Stop making that face." John said, Atlas only screwing her face up even more as she looked at him. "Its lovely."
Her body began to convulse on the floor, her form face down and the jug threatening to topple off the table at any moment. Of course, she didn't realise this though and began to his against the table leg.
"Even if I hadn't I would've tried." Sherlock said trying to help the situation along. Atlas nodded knowingly before looking at him.
"That's alright, Rosie," John said gently, putting an arm around her. "There we go, you can see its coming to an end now."
"Functional Neurological Disorder." John said quietly, looking up at Sherlock. "What makes you say that?"
"I am too." John said before tickling Rosie's tummy sending her into a fit of giggles. He himself laughed before blowing raspberries on her stomach too, making her laugh even more.
"Is this what your looking for?" Atlas asked as she picked up a piece of paper and studying it in her hands. She understood music well, being a violinist and pianist herself. The violin wasn't ger favourite or first instrument but she was still able to play quite intricate melodies. However the piano was her first love and her fingers were itching to just play, play something, play anything!
"Okay, you'll be okay, just hold on, just a little bit, you have people who need you, you-" Atlas watched her eyes glaze over and her whole body go slack. "You..." Abruptly, she stood and released everything.
"I covered some of the luggage in the back with some blankets," Sherlock smiled before he handed one to Sam who had Rosie sitting in his lap.
"Put your feet exactly where I put mine." Sammy said hoping over certain planks before coming to stop on the ridge. Atlas did the same before taking a seat directly next to him. They sat in silence and realised their ascent up the stairs took more time than they had realised and now the sun was beginning to rise over the city. It was spectacular, the sky painted in every colour imaginable as the head peaked over the first sets of houses on the horizon. Sammy took a snap with his phone before looking back at Atlas.
"We were supposed to be at parents evening tonight but I think me and Sherlock are going to stay here, we can have a family night in," John smiled before Sammy nodded warily before John rose to his feet, pulling the teen up with him.
When she opened her eyes she was staring straight at Sherlock who clutched the box of medical gear tighter and tighter.
"There was a lady arrived who wished to speak to them." Doctor Aduba smiled. "I think it was a lady from the family court."
"Okay." Atlas said as she took a few steps away and Sammy cleared the path. This was how she normally got in, at least when neither of her dads were watching. Attention of surrounding party members was caught as she jumped twice before running at full pelt, vaulted up the tree, grabbed a branch before swinging her legs up, ran across, jumped to another branch, grabbed the one above the entrance to the treehouse and swung her legs into the treehouse and landed. It wasn't very high up but it was high enough up that she had to take a run up. Atlas, then grabbed the ladder and pushed it out, making sure to latch it properly on the entrance.
The lab was Atlas and Sherlock's thinking spot. The place where they weren't judged for jumping in their own heads and gladly following whatever rabbit hole or staircase they found. They were at peace.
"That's funny. I didn't have you down as a black tea drinker." Atlas announced without removing her eyes from the page infront of her. Sherlock looked at her funny before taking a sniff and sure enough, black tea had a different smell to that of something other. Eventually, she closed the book placing it down on the table and staring eye to eye with Sherlock.
"Where are we going to?" Atlas asked as her new found 'friend' who she didn't believe would last long led her round some paths and onto what she believed were the outskirts of the city. There he led her round the back of a fence before they both vaulted it easily.
"Do you think we could talk?" Atlas questioned, she looked at John then back to Sherlock. "About everything."
"Half the time its illegible and then you change your mind two seconds later." John added and the laughter continued, something easy between the three of them. Little did they know, that it was only the beginning.
"Alright," John said, sitting down to eat. "Atlas and Sam, it would be appreciated if you two would get a good night's sleep. It's 7 hours driving tommorow of which me and Sherlock are taking turns."
"Oh and it already has a few classics on it, so see what you find." Atlas smiled as she retreated back to her room and came back through.
Then there was Thomas Aduba who had just died. A fellow colleague and his daughter - who also happened to be Atlas' friend Abayomi - had passed away in a airline crash. One of Atlas' friends had just died and he found it worrying that she just got up and went back to normal. As if the news reports online and in the papers and on social media weren't real. Then again, Atlas had been through enough hardship, pain, death and struggle to not crumble under immense pressure. But he still worried.
"She doesn't speak? My, John I expected you to raise your children better." John's father said, Sherlock looked over at him. He wanted to intervene, to say that John was a bloody good father. John had told him before that his father was also called John (John Sr.) and his mother was called Josephine (Jo to anyone who asked).
Atlas hadn't cried but had had three seizures during the week that had led to another review appointment being scheduled sooner, and she was soon moved onto a new set of medication.
"Yeah, it's on a rainbow street. Now that we have a second day...I mean...is it possible that me and Atlas can go on our own little tour. She probably has a map of Edinburgh in her mind palace," Sammy giggled as he looked up at John. "Where's Sherlock?"
Atlas pulled away, looked at him before going around and climbing back into the bed and huddling against Sherlock. The side of her head rubbing against his chest, his arm looping around her. She reached out a hand and gripping John's, closed her eyes.
"Yep, but early doors remember. We're leaving at about 7 in the morning so make sure your all up and ready," Sherlock smiled.
"Hey, hey." Sherlock said approaching her, cradling her in his arms as her breath became heavy. He applied pressure to the wound to help decrease the bleeding, self criticising when she winced in pain. "It'll be alright."
"I'm alright, thank you Rosie." Sherlock smiled, admiration shining in his eyes as Rosie shifted in his lap. Tucking her knees under herself she rested her chest and stomach up Sherlock's front with her temple resting just below his chin.
Walking into the small room, of the small Inverness based hospital, he sat down in a chair beside the bed.
THE clock came to beep precisely at 6:34am, the time she had chosen to set the night before. It changed every night, the numbers significant to mood as she swung her legs out. Sighing, she placed her feet on the ground and rose to her feet. She did everything she had to before going into the living room, typing into her phone.
Before them sat a man dressed in woman's clothing who was talking about an uncertainty about his wife. Something about her cheating on him with another man, but Atlas had long since switched off and returned to her book. John disappeared leaving a balloon in his place as he had done so many times before.
"Just a little overwhelming, yeah?" John said quietly before she pulled out of her dads hug and looked at him before she tilted her head up and looked at the ceiling obsessively. They waited, patiently, before she blinked a few times and looked at John and Sherlock in turn.
"I love you too Atlas." John said into her hair, planting a kiss on it and resting his chin atop her head.
ONCE everyone had settled down in the living room in preparation for the queen's speech, Atlas pulled Mrs Hudson to the side.
"It's alright," Sammy said before they crawled forward a bit more. "How can Inverness be this busy?"
"Instead of watching a movie, can we take Red out for a walk?" Sammy asked looking at John who smiled and nodded back.
"Your going to make me cry and I'm driving," Sherlock said with a smirk as they pulled into a viewpoint. "This is a pretty view but also, I need a moment."
"Hey, what happened?" John asked as Atlas pulled away and he pushed some hair off her forehead. She shook her head, tears streaming down her face. "Okay. We'll go home and we'll talk about it there. Jo and Harry are moving out soon. Have you had anything to eat?"
"I know, dad," Atlas whispered, looking at him with a nod. "I know." And then she noticed the frown on his features, deep lines of thought that Atlas found concerning and strange. "Are you alright?"
"I'll show you to your rooms." Timothy said as he progressed to show them all where they would be spending the next three nights. Rosie and Atlas were in a cosy room together, which Atlas didn't mind one bit. The house was larger than one may expect and seemed to exude happiness and rays of sunshine - Atlas pondered the thought that Timothy may have been the one to decorate the walls and choose the colours.
"No, I think we're just having a day here," Wanda said with a smile which was a complete and total lie but Atlas looked strangely pale. "Are you feeling alright today?"
"The beard. It's nice." Atlas smiled as she shuffled to move a little closer to John, Sherlock following so she still had her forehead against his lips.
"Hey, I know that, love." John frowned. "I am too. Seems like you got home and the worrying about you was over and suddenly I find myself worrying about our little girl. And what's going to happen to her. And I worry what might happen to Sammy and Rosie if Atlas doesn't..." John swallowed. "Y'know."
These rules could insure that Atlas and Sherlock could properly work on their empathetic skills. Although, most of the time neither would reveal their emotions to anyone unless they lived in 221B. That was the only time and they were the only people who were allowed to see in.
Warnings for vomit and near drowning. At this point, I keep forgetting to put these in but I think for the sequel to this I will only mention triggers if they are mental health based or vomit. I'm under the impression if you are here reading Sherlock fanfiction then you can probs handle gunshots and death.
"Go on, both of you," Mycroft said shooing them with an amused smile. Sherlock flashed a smile back before going over and kissing Atlas's temple with a smile. John repeating the same actions around his cast.
"Well done." Sherlock whispered, nothing comical being hinted in his voice as he placed a hand on her back. It was strange Atlas noted for him to do this, he wasn't good at human contact or emotions.
"Atlas here continues to give me her very valuable input, she can stay." John said, before Atlas gave him the kind of look that said a hundred
"Dad. Dad, I need you. Dad. Please." Atlas sad through her tears, a face streaked in tears and pain. "Dad. Papa...Dad."
"Better. It's going to take a lot more than a bullet to hurt me." Atlas replied. "Words always hurt - "
"As long as you don't scream, singing is still permitted." It rang. "I like it when the dying sing." Atlas gave a sigh before desiring to continue.
"Your shoulder aches when your stressed." Sherlock said, lifting his head slightly. "I have it all under control. And besides I have Atlas to help me out, we've found one we really like. It's all going OK. I promise. I can do it."
"Yes, me and dad both still play violin and I do still play piano but I also play cello, ukulele and baritone ukulele," Atlas grinned as her dad held her shoulder, rubbing firmly.
Atlas looked at it and smiled. It looked just as it did in the photos. Big. There was no mistaking that, Sherlock had already said that four bedroom was the most appropriate so that they could have a guest bedroom. It was old, almost like an old converted barn, almost as if Atlas could see if having sat there since before all the other houses. The front garden was not as big for this one as it was for the others, this house sitting more forward in it's plot. However, there was still room and adequate space for flowers and potted plants. To the right of the lawn section, was a drive way which appeared to peter round the back to give additional space, but on the front their was already enough space for two cars. A gate seperated the back driveway from the front and a wall seperated the housing plot from the public road. The distance suggested they were probably sitting on the outskirts here, the road off to the right leading into the countryside. A patch of trees scattering off from the side of the house next to the driveway.
"One fiddle," John smiled as he handed Sherlock his case and the man smiled. "Don't get too stressed out if it doesn't all fit, alright love?"
THE following morning they packed themselves away into the car and began the longer car journey up to the Highlands.
"They are." He said almost sadly. She didn't need to ask why he had the album, she could already deduce that one, she'd kept Whisper.
"Sherlock. Jesus. It's okay." John said the younger man still looking at the floor. "You - You look like I'm about-" Then before he could utter the words from his mouth on what he was going to say, he realised. "Oh shit. Oh Sherlock."
"Stand up." Mycroft insisted, looking down at his littlr brother. Sherlock didnt move. "Sherlock, stand up." He hissed.
"I thought papa was going to tell you that I'd gone back to bed," The teenager mumbled from under the covers, the duvet pulled up over her head. "That it's the medication."
"She's not." Sherlock said quickly and Sammy shook his head as he looked across the table. His eyes then fell to his lap as he welled up with tears.
"John!" Sherlock yelled up to the ceiling, an urgency in his voice as he checked his watch. John didn't reply, to his knowledge it was probably Sherlock just being silly again. "John!" Sherlock shouted again to the ceiling.
"I heard you." She laughed as Sherlock looked back to give Atlas a look. She got to her feet, gave John a quick kiss on the cheek and went off to follow her dad, Sherlock wrapping his spare arm around her shoulders.
"I'm cold." Atlas rasped before slowly blinking open her eyes. The room was dark and she could just about see the silhouette of John sitting in a chair. "Sit."
"I'm still listening, love," John said loudly, his face pointed to the door of the bathroom where he could just about see Sherlock in the mirror.
The stone opposite, June Willis, had greyed and gone pale but James' hadn't. It had stayed quite the same. She's stood there, by June Willis' grave at the funeral, a social worker attached to her side. And she'd sobbed and sobbed until she felt like her legs might just give way. She wanted to curl up in a ball and go home where he sat with the piano and violin and his banjo which he played the best music on. Back to the Scots ballads and now...Atlas felt like she was going to throw up.
"Are you alright?" Sherlock asked looking down to his husband and immediately putting his nose in the older man's hair.
"We'll go quietly, okay?" Atlas said, warning her. "Just incase they have gone to sleep." The young girl nodded before they silently descended the stairs. Rosie knocked lightly on the door, entering when they heard a questioning hello. When the little girl went in teary eyed she ran to John and climbed onto the bed.
"Yeah. A bumblybee." Atlas said as they continued on their path, trudging along the fully lit path. There was no point correcting her, especially because her nose scrunched up when she said it. This would cause the average human heart to speed up a little too much, words failing. Atlas took loads more photos of the dog and Rosie as they played together along the path.
"Alright, alright, my turn," Sherlock laughed. "I spy with my little eye, something beginning with G."
"Not good. She had three grand mal's this past week and I had to pressure the hospital for a sooner appointment and managed to get one."
"Stay with us." Sherlock said, surprising both parties until they realised that this situation was rather different to normal. "You might have to take the couch until we can figure out what to do. John's selling his house."
"I'd have texted you but no. Nothing." John smiled before he dropped his nose to Atlas' hair as she began to stir a little. She settled again and soon, the room was filled with deep breathing of a restful sleep again. "Your also supposed to be sleeping William Sherlock Scott Watson-Holmes."
"Yes," Atlas said before she began to sit up. "Look, I can probably walk out to the ambulance. I'm starting to feel way better."
"Ah yes. Says here. Can I get your name please?" The man asked, leaning in closer to the opened window on Sherlock's side.
"No," Atlas said. "Not me..." She steeled herself. "I remember the lodge and your headaches that you told no-one about and now...your face. So I ask again Uncle Mycroft, is it cancer?"
"No, we've nearly managed to get that piece by Telemann down,"  Sherlock smiled before Atlas groaned.
"Why?" John asked warily as he slowly put the tea down on the coffee table. When it clinked against the glass Atlas sat down next to him with her knees drawn up to her chest. Then, leaned against him, her legs still neatly tucked.
"You should let your dad go," Jo fussed but Atlas shook her head and Sherlock smiled apologetically.
"Okay," She whispered before getting to her feet and making her way over to her chair. She tucked her knees up to her chest and rested her chin on her arms. Sherlock nodded at her before shaking baking powder over the stain, picking up a few items he'd thrown off the bed. "Where's papa?"
"It's not epilepsy. It's what I've had the whole time." Atlas sighed before she looked at Mycroft. "It's stupid."
"Oh, your up here," Sammy smiled before he sat down on the floor and rested his temple against the bed.
"You left this in my bedroom, Red." Rosie said giving it to the dog who took it and looked at her. "Paw." She instructed, the dog giving it to her eagerly. John watched as she walked into the kitchen with her hands on her hips. He followed her in.
"Yeah, yeah." He sighed as he rubbed a hand over his face. "I was wondering...if you would be alright with...well...with you guys...if...well...I think I need to see Georgia."
"This is your desk." Sherlock said gesturing to the wooden desk with a new laptop on it, side light amongst other things.
JOHN ran a hand over his face as he entered the house at midnight. Sighing, he toed off his shoes and hung up his coat, dropping his bag in the lobby. As he entered the living room he saw Sherlock, bustling around the kitchen preparing a meal of tortellini for him in pyjamas. Just as John approached the breakfast bar, Sherlock swirled around and made up a bowl of tortellini with sauce and swiped infront of John.
"I know," Sherlock said again. "I know what it feels like. Alright? When I was on drugs and...all that...I dragged my friends time away from their loved ones...and I shouldn't have done that. People were running shifts looking after me and I would have been fine."
"You sick bastard." He said under his breath, before collecting he shovel and digging. Digging until his hands hurt, the skin on his palms peeled, digging until he couldn't take big enough breaths, till he was too warm, digging until he hit something hard. Scraping round the edges he found the lid for the coffin and tried to clear out the name. It read her name and he began to work faster and faster.
Once everyone was settled Rosie produced her cracker to pull with Atlas who took it. Once it was pulled they swapped and pulled Atlas' one. Rosie put her orange hat on her head, Timothy smiling as he pulled on his red one. Atlas pulled on a purple one, John a green one, Mrs Hudson also pulled on a red one, Mycroft refused and Wanda pulled on a light blue one. Sherlock sat holding it in his hands before Rosie squeezed past Atlas and walked over to him. She took his hat and pulled it onto his head.
"SO, wait." Greg said to Molly who was standing outside his hotel room door. She'd arrived just two minutes earlier with an unnerving spring in her step and just spent those two minutes speed telling Greg about what Sherlock had said on the phone. "Your telling me our sociopathic best friend who somehow has a lovely family of his own, has bought a house?" Molly looked at him and nodded once, biting her lip. Greg, who until this point had thought Molly was pulling some really good (for once) practical joke, sighed and beckoned her inside. He put the kettle on and continued to look at her like she had just told him of some miracle - then again, it
But Sherlock always came out of it on his own now.  Sometimes faster than others, sometimes looking a bit frightened or unnerved, but always...with a sort of air of contentment at the same time.  John had asked what he did, when he 'went away' into his head. Sherlock said he was reorganizing his mind palace.
Sherlock still had dreams.  And sometimes, if John was unlucky enough to be touching Sherlock when they happened, John had dreams too.
“I have,” said Lestrade.  “I’ve got journals from near the middle, I think, and…” he shuddered.  “He’s got this creature…called a wraith, providing Sherlock with…false experiences, and hallucinations.  Of us.  Well, not so much of you Sally, but of me.  And John, and Mrs Hudson.  Strangers too…anyway, he got lots of hallucinations about being freed.  About us…and even others at NSY coming to rescue him.  I mean…it makes his reaction to us make a lot more sense, if he thought we were more….wraith sent hallucinations.”
John followed him a little weakly, trying to puzzle through Sherlock’s words.  Sherlock was not inclined to explain himself, and he was glad that John didn’t ask.  He was tired.  He wasn’t fully healed yet.  Hopefully, it would be soon.  He almost smiled.  It was interesting, hoping.
“Doubtful.”  How else was he supposed to figure out just what was in the water?  The boy scowled at him.
? John thought, horrified.  The demon didn’t stop, jamming the prod into Sherlock, deep, until he could barely breath, and was left burned and bleeding.  The demons outside the cage kept running their pipes along the bars, banging them on occasion.
The wraith didn’t stop coming, not even when the Dreamwalks stopped.  For months, he’d dreamed of John, but it was never real.  And then she’d come, grinning, and she’d poison his mind, and he’d see John.  See him clear as if he were really there.  It was almost always John.  And every time Sherlock spoke to him, Moriarty would bite at him, scratch and beat and scream until Sherlock could barely move.
He wasn’t sure what had possessed him to say so much.   And then the presence is there, suffocating, pulling him back.
.  He sighed and slumped in his chair, rubbing his hand across his eyes.  Sherlock would get better, he told himself.  And he’d just have to be there for him.
The whip dug into his back and wings, again and again.  And then he understood.  Moriarty wanted to hear him scream.  You couldn’t scream if you couldn’t breath.  The whip licked at his neck, his wings, back and arse and thighs.  Finally, it stopped.  His back felt a pulpy mess, he could barely even feel it anymore.  The skin felt….gone really.  “That should do you for now,” Moriarty had said calmly.  Then, there was another snap, and…the stinging.  The stinging began.  The demons started laughing, taking turns with water pistols full of lemon juice and alcohol, squirting his back.  He was relieved that they couldn’t touch salt.  At least it limited just what they could pour into his wounds after they were inflicted.  Then he screamed again as someone chucked a bucket of…was it peroxide? on his back.  He wasn’t sure what it was, only that it hurt.  He had collapsed, almost sobbing.  He tried to tell himself he’d had worse, but his mind was nearly blank from pain, and he couldn’t remember worse than this.
There was a knock on the door, and Sherlock shook himself slightly, sitting up, straightened his shirt as a young woman hurried into the room.  "Mr Holmes," she said, "Doctor Watson.  I know you don't...really take cases anymore, your landlady was quite adamant, but...it's really serious, I wouldn't have come if..." she broke off with a sob.  John stilled, watching Sherlock as he sat forward, taking the woman in.
where the hell are you? And then he was there, as though he’d always been.  He raised a hand, and the cage was gone.  John’s mouth fell open.  Mycroft raised his hand again, and Sherlock was clean, though far from whole.  Scars crisscrossed everywhere along his body, detailing nearly unimaginable tortures.  Some fresh injuries were still bleeding.  Mycroft frowned.  Sherlock saw Mycroft and tried to crawl away, but Mycroft put a hand to Sherlock’s head, and he collapsed, unconscious.
Sherlock snapped his wings proudly behind him, still visible.  His feet were beginning to cramp, which confused him.  That was new.  Feeling cold.  It was near winter, and the windows were all open or broken.  He didn’t take his eyes away from Moriarty.  The Fallen angel grinned at him and threw the crowbar like a javelin.  Sherlock managed to duck it, but that meant that he missed the knives thrown just after he ducked, thrown at an inhuman speed that Sherlock was currently incapable of.  The end result was a knife plunged hilt deep into each wing, pinning him to the wall, mostly crouched on the floor.  He screamed.  The blades were some sort of angel blade though they burned like nothing he had ever felt.  “Angel blades, tempered in hellfire,” said Moriarty, as though reading his mind.  “They’ll poison you
The past Sherlock clutched at the man he thought was his friend.  “So…I hurt, John,” he rasped out.  “Everything….hurts.”
Moriarty had apparently gotten sick of healing his face after a certain point, and they mostly left it alone.  He hadn’t quiet figured out why Moriarty wanted his face kept…relatively clean of bruises or cuts and scarring.
Sorry it took so long to get up too.  But I don't have as much time right now, so updates will be scattered.
The boxes stood on Mycrofts desk like a challenge.  “I will view the tapes,” he said.  “If the three of you would like to start reading the journals…I suppose I will not stop you.   We will….keep each other informed.  I will stop by, every so often, to see what you have found and compare.”
Not brit-picked or anything, so...sorry if my wording or phrasing in that regard is all over the place.
Sherlock knew he was getting better.  Though he was still too scared all of the time.  He was still lost.  He hated John’s pity.  But he needed John there.  And the pity was getting less and less.  It was…something else, something he couldn’t quite name, that kept John here now.  And he tried for John.  He wanted to get better, for John.  His life as a detective seemed almost like a dream.  He remembered everything, but felt very little attachment to it.  Still, he remembered that he liked Lestrade, when he came around.  Which wasn’t often.
Sherlock stared at the little pond in the center.  It was…a sad pond, he thought.  The green waters weren’t at all healthy.  He crouched, and stuck a finger in the water.  It came out discolored.  “I don’t think yer s’pposed ta touch it,” said a voice behind him.  He turned.  There was a boy holding a ball…Sherlock stared at it, trying to place what
“He does it sometimes.  I think when it gets a bit too much and just starts going round and round inside his head and he can’t get it out or make sense of what he’s feeling…you know.   It feels like it lasts hours.   It’s just moments, really, but god, it’s always awful.”
The lack of control he seemed to have over his grace concerned Mycroft.  He ended up warding his house completely, so that Sherlock couldn’t fly away, simply by accident.  It meant that he couldn’t leave either, at least not easily, but it was a small price to pay, he thought.
“Sherlock?” he asked carefully.  The caged man slowly raised his head.  John stepped closer to the cage, and Sherlock lunged at him, all but snarling, though he was brought to a choking halt by the collar and chain, little rivulets of blood began running down his neck.  “Sherlock it’s me, it’s John,” he said, desperately.  Sherlock stumbled back a moment, then shook his head and lunged at him again, ignoring the collar pressing against his throat, clutching at the bars.
“No sir.  Nor have we viewed the tapes.  They were already in the boxes.  I think he meant to send them eventually.  He wanted us to know how…” she stopped.  Mycroft nodded.
I don't own the main characters.  Isda and Sariel are mine, though...someone else named them.  Whoever decides what angels are called and what they are angels of.  Characterization is mine though.
Sherlock struggled to regain consciousness.   “What’s that pet?  I didn’t hear you,” whispered a voice close to his ear.
him…Each time, he felt a little lighter.  As if the memories and dreams had weight, and by showing them to someone, he was removing a little bit of the burden from himself.   John didn't seem like he was letting them, the memories, crush him.  Or even weigh him down.  That was good.  It meant that Sherlock could keep showing him.  John wanted to help, and really, this was the best way, at least in Sherlock's mind.  He couldn't carry this by himself, and John could.
me!”  He collapsed again, murmuring frantically to himself, eyes darting in all directions.  He looked for all the world like an animal, wings flaring out on occasion.  John didn’t think he realized they were free.  He wasn’t moving outside the limited range the pinned appendages would have given him, not after the initial lunge.
…It hadn’t been the first time that they had fucked Sherlock.  It wasn’t even they first time more than one of them had done it.  But, it had been the most brutal.  The most in succession.  And the first time Moriarty had used John’s face to do it.  He had taken the last sacred thing Sherlock possessed, his one lingering…fantasy, and destroyed it.  He had ripped up Sherlock’s hope and smashed them beneath his feet.
Sherlock’s body reacted in ways that Sherlock clearly hated.  One demon, was almost gentle, easing into him, slowly.  He used a finger first, slicked with spit, sliding it slowly into Sherlock’s entrance, crooking his finger.  He prepared Sherlock gingerly, though the other demons jeered and told him to go faster.  Moriarty said nothing.  He watched, licking his lips occasionally.  The demon inserted a second finger, other hand drifting around Sherlock’s hip and palming his cock.  He stroked down, languidly, twice, and Sherlock moaned.  He started getting hard.  The demon bit at Sherlock’s shoulder, then carefully guiding himself in, entering Sherlock almost as slowly as he had with his fingers.  He rocked his hips slowly at first, picking up speed.  His other hand he left on Sherlock’s cock, stroking it in time to his thrusts.  Sherlock groaned again, body reacting positively.  Moving his hips along with the others, cock weeping pre-cum.  Sherlock yelled, and came, and the demon pulled out, looking satisfied.  He let Sherlock watch him lick the come off his hand.  Sherlock closed his eyes and shivered.  There were tear tracks down his cheeks.
.  Hurt me instead, hurt me….you promised” He fell backward, then collapsed, hard enough to crack his knee, which he ignored.  John had leapt backward when Sherlock had lunged, but he stepped forward again.  Sherlock shoved himself back, scrambling into the corner of the cage.  “No! False!” he screamed.  “You promised!”  Someone had tried to go around to the side Sherlock was, but he jerked away from the wall, leaping back, barely managing to catch himself on feet nearly black with grime.  “No!” he screamed again, eyes wide, terrified.  “No!  Away!  False, false, false!  You can’t
Mycroft sent her an annoyed look.  “Sherlock has been in that particular form for sixty years.  And he never had a family.  Furthermore, we do not
Bit more of Sherlock whump in the beginning.  Some sexual themes.  Not super-explicit, but, explicit enough.  Some language.
He glanced up, and he was alone.  He sat, back against the wall, and curled his wings around him as far as they would go, arms around his knees, brought tight against his chest.
John nodded.  “Yeah.  But…you know.  Can’t have knowledge like that getting out.  It’s…it’s a bit secret, alright?  Secret powers and all that, like the comics.”  The boy considered that, then nodded seriously.
“Sherlock…and I are not human,” he said.  “Nor was the man you knew as James Moriarty.  We…are angels.  Or rather, Sherlock and I are.  James…was Fallen.”
“Remember metal…?” he asked suddenly, but was cut off when the roiling black smoke dragged him away again, faster, rougher this time, than before, towards the sea, and then under the waves.  John awoke choking, tasting sea water.
John had not known what to do the first time Sherlock had panicked.  He’d started screaming, a wordless yell that shook the room, and sent John to his knees.  Mycroft had sent him away.  The next time it happened, Sherlock had pressed him into the corner, shaking.  He hadn’t made a noise, just wrapped his arms around his knees, wings around his trembling frame.  Mycroft had sent him away again.  The third time, Sherlock had been screaming again.  It wasn’t in what Mycroft called True Voice, just…screaming, and John got to Sherlock before Mycroft sent him away.  He grabbed Sherlock by the shoulders.  Mycroft decided it would be bad if John disappeared right in front of Sherlock.
This chapter (I know) jumps rather suddenly from a not really healed Sherlock to a much better Sherlock.  A lot of the chapters are going to do that.  Go between recovery and torture and being sick in Mycroft's house etc.  There will be more of the four months we didn't see in this chapter, intermixed with scenes from after he meets John again.
“We can’t do that,” she said.  “He’s still…locked in there.  We think it might be…permanent.  Or at least….mostly.   We tried expelling him from the vessel, but we think it just hurt him.”
"  He was half sobbing, and John couldn't grab hold of his wrists.  Sherlock had most of his strength, and pushing John away was no harder than pushing away a flea.  "Rats, rats," he sobbed, "get it out, get it out, no, no, no,
Sariel swallowed.  They’d done too much and not enough.  Sherlock had his strength back.  Just as strong as Mycroft was.  It had taken three of them to subdue him.  Mycroft looked shattered.  Sherlock was unconscious again.  It seemed the only way to make sure he didn’t hurt himself.  “I think it will be fine,” said Mycroft, voice calm.  “Thank you for your assistance.”  He wondered what more could be done.  They’d healed his body, but…Sariel felt useless.  He could do
“Like I’d tell you,” he said, voice hard, sometimes harsh from screams.  Moriarty would lift him by the collar.
He stepped slowly away from the wall.  His heart hammered in his chest.  He took a shaky breath.  Vessel, so locked into his vessel, why was that?  He…no.  No thinking.  He took another step.  He glanced at Mycroft and at John again.  Back to Mycroft.  It took him a long time to get across the room.  He carefully reached out with a trembling arm and brushed long fingers across John’s face.  False John had always reacted if Sherlock touched him.  Lashing out with whips and words as sharp as swords.  Sometimes pressing his face into Sherlock’s hand, sometimes pressing cold lips against it, reaching out to pull Sherlock close.
by your human vessel.  What I do to it,” he backhanded Sherlock across the face, snapping his head to one side and leaving a red mark, “you will feel.  I’ve tied you in and trapped you.”  He grinned.  “But your grace isn’t gone.  No.  Because then, I wouldn’t be able to do
so much as simply miserable.  He was always cold, and October was slowly sliding into November.  He’d been fed three times.  An apple, the first time.  And some sort of tasteless muck the next two.
John lost track of how many of them took their turn with Sherlock.  The females tended to use sharp objects of varying sizes, rustiness, sharpness…the males all used their own cocks, plunging into him over and over again.  Moriarty healed him occasionally, the result being he would be forced open anew every third penetration, ensuring that he remained tight, that each object, whether it be flesh or metal was as painful as possible as it entered, tearing him time and time again.
It wasn’t exactly as he had left it, and that was…good.  It was different enough from the forced hallucinations that he didn’t feel panicked or lost or unsure.  He touched the skull gingerly.  He whirled to face John, held out his hand.
Moriarty thought his new stance hilarious, and just laughed for a few minutes as the two demons tried to get close to him.  “See what two hours of sleep can do?” he crowed.  “Just have to make you annoyed that’s all.”  Still, after a few minutes, he grew bored of seeing Sherlock bat his minions away.  Two more demons appeared, with…Sherlock paused.  Netting?  All four launched themselves at him at once and, try as he might, he couldn’t fight them off.  He struggled and hit, but by the end of it all, his wings were lashed tightly to his back with a strange, metallic netting, tightly linked.  It sealed across his chest, ensuring the wings couldn’t break free.
“Well, I do like it when you beg,” said Moriarty.  He yanked the pipe out from where it protruded from Sherlock’s back.  “Beg!” he yelled, swinging the pipe, cracking it against Sherlock’s ribs.  “Beg!  Beg!  Beg!”  Each ‘beg’ was accompanied by a strong whack of the metal pipe against Sherlock’s stomach or ribs.
“Can’t have them killing you too quickly, can we brother?” he’d sing-songed.   Sherlock lay on the floor, curled up in the fetal position.  He gasped for breath, shook in pain and exhaustion.  Blood still flowed rather freely from his back, his feet, his hands.  His vision was hazy and swimming, his hearing was off, everything seemed to fade in and out, echoing.     Moriarty ‘tsk’d.’  “This won’t do.”  He clicked his fingers.  And Sherlock’s wounds healed themselves over.  They scarred, didn’t vanish as though they’d never been there, but they healed, from the bottom up. “There now.  Now you won’t die on me.  Good.  Because I still have a lot of fun planned for you.”
