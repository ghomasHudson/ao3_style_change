Tony inhaled deeply. Silence lingered for a moment, and then he thought he heard a small noise, like someone opening their mouth to talk.
Sam ended up being the one who flew him back to the quinjet, where he was sent straight to medical while the others surveyed the rest of the ship.
While Steve is gone, Tony closes his eyes, trying to push himself toward sleep even though he knows there’s no way he will be able to do it. His own bed feels like a foreign territory, vastly different just with the knowledge that Steve will be there by his side, through the night. Tony finds himself worrying about ridiculous things, like how much he moves or shifts during sleep, or snoring, or sweating too much. Of course, the concern makes no sense, since Steve has been sleeping with him for a while in his fantasy now, so none of that would come as a surprise to him, but Tony can’t help but worry that Steve has expectations of pleasant behavior from his dream self that the real version of him can’t live up to.
He wonders what Steve’s dreaming about. Being back in his time, maybe? Tony can see how that could be appealing - to have been able to safely land that plane, to get back from the war with Peggy Carter, to live a happy life and die as one soldier who made a difference, rather than as a legend to made the ultimate sacrifice.
Steve flushed. He looked away, then cleared his throat. “What I was supposed to,” he said, like that answered everything.
“I’m sorry,” Steve cut him off, sounding pained. “I had to, we don’t know what she could have done.”
“You can call them tits,” Tony whispers, conspiratorial, to Stark. Steve’s face burns and yet heat curls low in his belly at the thought of Tony exposing him like that, displaying all of his weak spots to Stark’s merciless mouth and fingers. “He loves it.”
But it’s also okay, because Steve is here – right next to him, eyes half-lidded, mouth curled in a peaceful smile as he starts to drift off to sleep.
The result was that, by the time the team got back, his mood was already awful, and it hadn’t really improved ever since, in the past few days. He resisted any attempts made by Nat and Thor to talk about it, and, to be honest, he hadn’t so much as glanced at Tony so far.
Steve is right behind him, and when Tony turns to look at him, he seems a little confused by Tony’s escape. His half-smile has faded, and for an irrational moment Tony misses it fiercely. It’s as if someone just turned off the sun.
“Hi, okay, so, I’m just gonna grab two of these, thank you.” He reaches for the tray before the man has a chance to offer anything and grabs two champagne flutes. “Stick around, I’m definitely gonna need you again tonight.” He pats the man on the shoulder, conspiratorial. “Bring something stronger.”
Tony gives him a nod, too hungry to speak. He takes a bite of his pizza and chews under Steve’s gaze.
past that, Steve thought, face heating a little at the memory of their last encounters – and it wasn’t fair for Steve to make Tony feel he had to retreat back to this kind of treatment.
His jaw is lax, his mouth helpless as Tony keeps going, the stretch of his lips mixing with the slick, continuous movement of Stark’s dick inside of him.
Despise Steve’s state, it’s slower, this time. Tony kisses him right after he closes the door, but before Steve can start fumbling with his clothes, he’s already leading them to bed. Steve’s thoughts turn to mush, helpless at the succession of long, deep kisses; he stumbles when the back of his knees touch the bed, falling down and pulling Tony with him.
He’s about to make an attempt to raise his head a millimeter to say it better, but then the warmth is gone, and he hears the door opening.
“Not a terrible idea, I suppose, but no, darling, I won’t.” Stark’s voice sent shivers down Steve’s neck as he climbed onto the bed. Steve’s face warmed and his breath shortened, even though Stark hadn’t lied about the mattress’ size. Still - he couldn’t feel Stark’s body next to his at all, but he could
“You’re like me, Tony. I’m not any more pleased about this than you are.” He taps the fingers of his free hand on the chair’s arm. “We have our differences, but at the end of the day, we’re the same.” Tired of waiting, he pulls the flask out of his vest, opens it and takes a large sip.
Life with three dogs in one apartment wasn’t easy, but Steve made do. Having Sam and Bucky nearby definitely helped, and, though, in the past, he had been forced to spend a few weeks living off ramen to buy food for all his children (as Bucky put it), things became pretty stable once a few of his political cartoons went viral and he was hired to draw for an extremely popular webcomic. The payment wasn’t anything exorbitant, but it paid his bills and allowed him to work from home and spend time with his dogs, so Steve wasn’t complaining.
Howard’s mouth curls in disapproval, but Tony doesn’t seem to notice, marching to the table and staring at him with wide, surprised eyes. He’s out of control, asking about a dozen of different questions at once. Just his voice is enough to make Howard’s headache start pounding again.
“So,” Tony says, after a few moments. His fingers tap the table. “I take it that stuffing your face is your way of enjoying the party, then?”
Dummy barked in protest at the suggestion, and Steve couldn’t blame him. “It’s still pouring outside,” he said. “You two can stay, it’s fine. You can have my bed.”
Stark smiled. “And for good reason. He saved my life, at least that one time.” He clasped his hands as he stared at Steve. “It worked as a wake-up call. I realized I had to stop the trail of blood my dad had passed on to me, in the form of my company. So I changed directions, turning Stark Industries into a giant of the clean energy business.” He took a deep breath. “That’s as far as the general public knows. But I didn’t stop there.”
Just as he says that, Tony’s hand slides over to Steve’s stomach, strong, skillful fingers barely touching him, knowing full well just the lightest brush will drive Steve crazy. His hands come up and down, teasing, never going below Steve’s belly button, deliberately nowhere close to his already throbbing cock.
to take care of the company was double-dealing, and he was the one who set everything up to get me kidnaped in the first place. He… he was my dad’s best friend.”
“Why?” He repeats instead, as if he doesn’t understand the question. Then, to Howard’s surprise, a flush climbs up on his cheeks, his mouth curling in a smile that seems to be carefully controlled in order to not be too bright. “I imagine that for the same reasons anyone marries, sir.”
“This might be a little cold,” Tony warned, and it indeed was – his hands lay on Steve’s shoulders in a careful, slow motion, and yet they sent a chill down Steve’s back, slick with some kind of oil. “I’m gonna start on top, alright?”
in the air, like a baseball, heading straight to the wall behind them. A helpless “No!” escaped from his lips, but, even as he launched himself forward in a faint attempt to save the dog from what would
“I have a shower in my suite,” Steve replies. He knows he must be a little disgusting, sticky and sweaty, but he wishes Tony, at least, would pretend not to notice.
“We can talk to him,” Tony says, standing up, walking towards the panel. Bruce looks at him puzzled, but he continues, touching and marking specific spots for FRIDAY to copy. “I can develop a couple of these in an hour. Half an hour, maybe. We modify it so it responds to Cap’s brainwaves, and someone can get inside his fantasy, and—”
Well, to be fair, the ceremony is quite lovely. Gamora and Quill’s vows are simple but beautiful, Groot as a flower girl is a surprisingly sweet moment, and the music from the 60s playing in the background during the entire thing is a nice touch.
There’s a moment, a split second in which Tony doesn’t react, and Steve is so afraid he thinks he won’t make it through this, then he feels the warm weight of Tony’s hand holding his.
“No. No, darling,” Stark interrupted, light laughter in his voice, and Steve’s anger deflated. It was dangerous, how Stark could do this. “That’s the last thing I want you to do. I was just wondering if you’d want to turn around and then, maybe… I could come closer?”
Tony tries to be patient. He tries to be understanding, and most of the time, he thinks he manages to. He watches Steve laugh at something on his phone - Steve has this dorky laugh that shakes his entire body and flushes his cheeks - and he thinks he can wait, this is enough for now. But then sometimes Steve bends over to pick up something he dropped, and all Tony can think about is how much he wants to stick his dick in that ass so hard, whoever manages to pull him out will be the next King Arthur. It just... happens.
“Hello,” Rogers says, breathless. Howard has no doubt the man completely forgot his presence the second Tony stepped inside the room. For a moment, he feels almost as though he’s intruding, because Rogers’ focus on Tony is almost inappropriate. Howard knows better than to be fooled by it, though.
“Thank you for having me tonight,” he says, before giving a quick, mechanic bow. Then his eyes find Howard’s, blue and cold and yet somehow blazing, as if he can see things Howard doesn’t want him too. “I trust that you will be able to reach the best decision for your son, my lord.”
He opens his mouth to say something, because as far as romantic speeches go, he’s pretty sure he could have done better, but he never finds out how, because in the next second Steve’s mouth is on his, soft and warm in a kiss that travels through Tony’s whole body. Tony’s lips part almost instantly, and Steve deepens the kiss, his hands going to Tony’s waist and pulling him closer until he feels his solid chest.
Steve lay down, and Tony quickly adjusted, walking to his chest and lying across it. He looked like a long, fluffy pillow, his fur making his shape seem especially round.
He looked down, his face hot with embarrassment and discomfort at Tony’s stare. His behavior wasn’t fair – Tony deserved better than to be avoided, especially with no apparent reason. But still, he found the words wouldn’t come out, locked inside his throat, trapped under too much fear and pride to be set free.
And then Steve’s thumb strokes his hand, moving slightly to interlace their fingers together, and Tony’s brain just shuts down, because.
He followed Tony to the chosen table, near Tony’s work counter. Tony positioned himself across it and patted a spot for Steve.
Truth be told, he was too busy focusing on not going insane to think about the strength of their performance. He had been distracted by his feelings, not even considering that getting caught could legitimately put them in danger, but now the possibility was too real to ignore. “She’s on to us? And you didn’t think it would be a good idea to tell me that?”
and in a moment Tony is right behind the couch, leaning forward to place his hands over the cushion. From behind Steve’s broad, sculpted-by-the-Gods back, he catches a glimpse of a Twitter feed.
Tony watched him, and at one point he closed his book and fished out the tiniest notepad from his pocket. He wrote something down, tongue sticking out from the corner of his mouth, deep concentration as his fingers brushed his bangs to the side, and Tony had thought:
Steve clenches his jaw, aware of the inappropriateness of those thoughts in a casual one night stand scenario. He grabs Tony’s shirt and pulls him into a deep kiss.
“We can talk more in the morning,” Tony suggests. In the suggestion there are a bunch of other words being said –
“No. Only when me and Dummy fight.” His lips curled into what seemed almost like a pout. “And, mind you, what counts as a
“Tell you what,” Tony says, eventually, his hand coming up to Steve’s shoulder. His grip isn’t tight, but it still sends a shiver down Steve’s spine. “I’m getting into the physics of it right now, so we should probably get you a drink for this.”
Steve blinked. That was a little unusual. Stark was rarely at home in the middle of the night, spending most of his time at trashy, decadent parties. Well—Steve had never been to one of them, so that was mostly his own guess, but it was a reasonable one, considering the companions Stark seemed to take to his apartment every other night. They would leave in the morning, nearly bumping onto Steve as they hurried towards the elevator, men and women with red eyes and clothing that seemed to be worth more than Steve’s rent, even if it didn’t cover much skin at all.
“I was counting on you to say that.” Stark gave him a bright grin. “There’s a lot that we can do – that shelter you work on, for instance? Could use an expansion, and then there’s…”
“Nothing,” Stark said, sounding a little desperate. “You just… I didn’t think it was true. I just needed to be around you for a while to be certain. But boy, have you proved me wrong.”
“Not right now,” Tony says, firm. His hand holds Steve’s wrist. “I wanted to talk to you about something.”
“I could,” Steve says, after a while. He’s giving him an exit to finish this conversation, but Tony doesn’t want it.
“Tony—” he heard Steve saying behind him, his voice a faint whisper, but impossible to ignore all the same.
Tony flinches, jumping away immediately, the warm, soft feel of Steve’s mouth on his like an electric current going through his body.
you want me, gorgeous.” His other hand goes to Steve’s jaw, turns his face to him. He kisses him slowly, then pulls back and flicks his thumb over Steve’s nipple. Steve gasps, and Tony keeps going, rolling the nub between his index finger and his thumb, pulling slightly and pressing short kisses at Steve’s mouth. “Just name it, and I’ll do it. Anything.”
See, the thing about saving the universe is that it’s a pretty awesome endeavor while it’s happening – fighting for humanity, putting every sore feeling behind for the greater good and all of that crap. When it’s done, though, all you’re left with is a supersoldier who smashed your heart in a million pieces, and it’s just awkward.
“Hmmm,” Tony murmurs approvingly, eyes closing again, even though, as far as Steve kisses go, that one is pretty weak. Still, it’s a nice start, and sometimes it’s good to have encouragement.
“At least the whores want me,” Tony’s face seems to shake for a moment, but he doesn’t back down an inch, and his voice is cutting, sharp. “At least they’re not terrified at the thought of bedding me, as they are at the mere mention of you. You must know, right? That they whisper among themselves of how old and decrepit you have gotten, and how they fear you will one day solicit their company - though, most of them aren’t sure, father: are you even capable of performing the job? Since mother—”
“Leave it,” Steve said when Stark attempted to shoo the cat away. He was still shaky, but he was slowly growing a little steadier, his mind grabbing onto details of the world around him to remind him that was where he was now, and not
“You’re delicious,” he says. Steve blushes hot, and he notices Stark is also flushed and winded, as he makes a gesture towards Steve’s body that’s almost awkward. “May I…”
“That sentence is so absurd I think if I spend too long thinking about it, I might dissociate,” Tony says, but he doesn’t move away when Steve takes a closer step. He inhales sharply. “Do you, huh… What are you—”
Maybe it isn’t the right thing to say, but Steve doesn’t mind, because the bright smile Tony gives him in return is worth making a fool of himself for. “Don’t mention it.” As Steve turns, he hears him adding, “See you later, Steve.”
As they get inside the elevator, Tony feels heat prickling from his cheeks down to his neck. A bug, certainly, but how? What misstep in programming the nanites could have caused this?
“We are,” Steve agrees. This might be the most words they’ve said to each other after sex, ever, and it feels awkward but sweet, making little engines twirl in Tony’s stomach.
Both of them grin. Stark pulls at his tie, loosening it before pulling it off in one smooth motion. Then he slips off his jacket, slowly, and it’s a transparent provocation of Steve’s stare, but Steve can’t bring himself to mind.
When Maria left, on nights when Howard stumbled through the hallways to get to bed, his hand on the wall to steady himself, he heard sounds coming from Tony’s bedroom. Muffled, uneven sobs, impossible to mistake for noises that came from working.
“Hey,” Steve says. He’s the slightest bit hesitant, but he seems pleased when he notices the messy bed. “How are you feeling?”
Steve nodded, but seemed unsure. He pulled Tony towards him, putting himself between him and the elevator. His eyes were bright, too bright to stare at, for Tony’s sanity. He focused on watching the elevator display behind Steve instead, where an upwards arrow shined.
“Uh, not sure,” Steve shrugs with one shoulder, eyes darting away, and it’s that, that weird layer of nervousness under all the coyness, that’s a fucking danger to society and everything it holds holy. It’s
“Seeing your behavior also made me wonder. For two people who overcame so much to be together, you don’t seem very at ease with each other, if you don’t mind me saying. Now, normally I wouldn’t dream of intruding in such a private topic, but.” She pressed her lips together in a golden, thin line. “You see, it’s… quite a strange situation. Some of my advisors seem to think you are, well—
“Would that work?” Tony asks, the rush of the idea still over his body, reluctant to allow even the slightest doubt to get through it.
He takes another sip, but this time it’s a small one, and his eyes don’t leave Steve’s face. His smile grows, and then his mouth curls, pressing his lips together, and he looks away.
Then, at 6:38, he was ready, exactly twenty-two minutes too early. Fortunately, Steve, being who he was, had also shown up to meet him in the living room early, so Tony didn’t have to wait for long.
Stark’s eyes spark with interest. “Really?” He holds one of the nipples in between his index finger and thumb, applying light pressure and pulling, sending a spark of delicious pain in his wake. Then he tilts his head upwards, coming to whisper in Steve’s ear as both of his hands continue the movement, pulling and twisting. “Do you like it when I play with your pretty tits, sweetheart?” The
, misses the fights they’d have, misses staring at his face constantly trying to figure out what he was thinking and always, always failing.
“Go dance with your husband,” Steve says, because he doesn’t want Bucky or Sam to waste time worrying about him tonight. It’s their night. “I’m fine, Mr. Wilson.”
be close, what is up with that? – but tragically, Steve pulls away, and after a few seconds of waiting Tony realizes he
Steve chuckles, and then leans forward and presses his lips to Tony’s mouth, in a sweet yet hurried movement. He pulls away just an inch, his nose still brushing Tony’s and his laugh lines so visible it’s almost insulting.
Moments after the transformation, Steve had been running around, sticking his nose in every single dangerous corner of Tony’s lab, and they had all decided maybe a walk would be best for him. Since he had barked loudly every time anyone else tried to put the leash on him, that task had fallen onto Tony’s shoulders.
Steve frowned, still not fully convinced. “Look, there’s no time to lose. The more we stand here talking, the further away he gets, and something bad might happen.”
Steve swallows. He knows he deserves this, but he wishes Tony would try to understand. It’s—it’s the best for both of them, in the end. Steve spared Tony the work of letting him down gently later, down the line, when the appeal of the sex wore off, or when Steve attempted to ask for more – or worse, he thinks with his stomach clenching, when Tony gave him more and Steve didn’t know what to do with it.
He didn’t even look offended, Tony thought, a little distantly. Just. Hurt in the rawest, simplest way someone could be.
“I’m not.” He looks away from Tony, eyes also finding the unavoidable view of Thor’s ass. His flush deepens, and his gaze quickly shifts to the sand. “I just wouldn’t feel comfortable in something so… revealing.”
“I do, in fact,” the man replied, his hand reaching into his pocket to pull out a cellphone which was clearly the lastest model. “Here.” He ran his thumb over the screen and typed something, turning the phone to Steve.
And then the elevator doors opened, and Steve got out, and there was no kiss but really, that had been even better. The doors closed, and Tony rested his head on the wall and smiled like an idiot at the ceiling.
At first, Steve raises an eyebrow, but, after a moment, it hits him. Certainly Tony wasn’t—“You—are you serious?”
it in some ways.” He shrugged. “Some of their tricks are better perceived than others. And making humans do the work, well—that’s always a hit.”
A few moments afterwards, the bed shifts as Steve climbs in next to him. Tony’s fingers curl around the sheets nervously as he feels an arm being laid over his waist and a body coming closer, fitting against Tony’s back.
When Tony received Natasha’s call, he—well, he thought she was wrong, for starters. Natasha’s track record stands against that, of course, but Tony just couldn’t help but think what she’s saying – Steve being attacked, Steve being kidnapped, Steve not answering any communications – just didn’t jive well with reality. It couldn’t happen. It just couldn’t.
Steve felt his eyes going heavy at all the warmth and comfort of the small bodies covering him. He moved his hand slightly to scratch Tony’s ear and was rewarded with a soft, loving noise that sounded suspiciously like a purr.
Afterwards, the conversation flows easily. Peggy doesn’t ask him much about his reality, clever enough to understand there are things he just won’t answer. They talk about the post-War, about Peggy’s new husband, about mundane things. They remember old times back at the base and laugh.
Steve shook his head, trying to focus on the living room instead. Stark’s apartment was roomier than his, decorated with extravagant art pieces that hurt Steve’s eyeballs. There was cat hair everywhere, a testament to his lack of cleaning skills.
Steve to be angry, wanted Steve to feel even a fraction of the rage and pain he was feeling – wanted to yell at him, to punch his face, to burst his precious Barnes’ head open. Stoic, righteous Steve, trying to stop Tony, trying to sound all rational and reasonable after keeping the truth from him for years, as if the death of his parents was nothing, as if
“Not yet,” Howard replies. He’d get angry at Tony’s insolence, but it’s too transparent an attempt to derail the conversation to truly get to him. “As I was saying. Iron – one of the finest metals men can find to fight a war with. But it’s not particularly rare or hard to replace. It gets rusty.”
When the elevator door opens, Tony rushes ahead, slipping out of Steve’s hold. He takes a few quick strides into the suite, on his way to the bedroom, desperate to put some distance between them, to get that amazing I.Q. of his to start working again.
Howard offers him wine, but of course he refuses. He then starts thanking Howard, but cuts himself short when Tony arrives.
Tony lets out a short, disbelieving laugh. “You. What else?” He shakes his head. “I don’t think I have had less success in understanding anything else, including the space-time continuum.” He pinches his nose, then clasps his hands together. “Look. Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but I’m not good at this… thing.”
Tony chews and swallows, his eyes snapping towards Steve’s, who is at a loss. Tony’s hand rests on the table behind them and he leans over it, his posture nonchalant.
“Are you going to just stand there?” he asked after a moment, unable to actually look and face Stark’s eyes. Still, his heart beat steadily in his chest as he heard Stark’s low, surprised chuckle.
Then his eyes land on Tony. He has a knowing smile on his lips, watching the happy couple as if he always knew it would end this way. His sunglasses hang from his collar. He doesn’t look like he’s been crying.
The bathroom’s door was closed, but Tony knew it was almost as big as the room, the bathtub making his jacuzzi seem like a bucket. And, of course, there was the king-sized bed, looming behind Steve and Tony like a threat and a mockery at the same time.
The thing is that… well, it’s not that simple, story time. It’s not just about reading—the kids enjoy interacting and reacting, and they need some kind of extra touch to follow the narrative. Steve, trying hard as Tony knows he is, just isn’t doing anything to make the story interesting – no acting out the characters voices, no dramatic pauses for extra impact, nothing. He’s just… reading, and Tony guesses the kids were instructed to be respectful in Captain America’s presence, so that’s why they haven’t raised hell yet, but there’s no denying they’re bored.
He turns immediately, a little startled, because he didn’t see Tony during the ceremony. And yet there he is, impeccably dressed in a two-piece suit that immediately that makes Steve feel underdressed in his old, boring grey suit that he wore only a few months ago at Wanda and Vision’s wedding. Looking at Tony now, incredibly sharp in his dark blue jacket, Steve wishes he’d bothered to buy something new to wear.
“I--” Steve cut him off, then swallowed. “I think you’re right, and there’s a lot we need to talk about, but…” He sighed. Stark’s words sent shivers of excitement over him, but afterwards, the sheer exhaustion from everything else in that crazy day had replaced it. “But I think we should leave that to next morning.”
“Hi?” he says, a little tentative, before his brain catches up to reality. In his defense, he was getting ready to sleep when Tony knocked. He looks at what Tony is holding – a wet mess that seems to have been a flower bouquet at some point. “What are you doing here?”
Steve’s eyes search his face nervously ― Tony can see, from the corner of his eye, the walls appear wavy, slightly out of focus, though not as glitched as before ― but then Steve nods, walking inside as if he was waiting for Tony’s permission.
He uncrosses his arms, clasping his hands behind his back instead. He gazes over at the display of Steve’s vitals, just to have something else to look at.
Rhodey grins, shaking his head. “You know, for someone who watches the guy like a puppy every time he’s in the room, you’ve certainly missed the obvious.” Tony just stares at him. “He’s completely head over heels for you, man. He looks at you like you hung the moon.”
They start out swaying. Steve is tense, his posture stiff, and for a second he wonders if this was a terrible idea.
“Bruce won’t answer his phone.” Tony blurts. Part of him wants to shake Rhodey off and just go, but the thing about Rhodey is that something about him always makes it difficult for Tony to do that. “I need him to scan Cap for side effects before I inject my nanites in him. We can’t wait until tomorrow, we don’t know how long until that thing starts damaging his brain—”
“Yeah,” Steve says, and Tony can feel his smile against his skin, a soft, smooth line. It’s fucking insane, to think of all the ways he has experienced Steve’s smile today. It makes his head spin. “Why are you asking me these things?”
When he wakes up, he goes straight to his worktable and tells FRIDAY he wants a scan of Steve’s brain.
The image is like a knife to Tony’s chest, but it’s comforting in this sense: Steve would never string him along just for the sake of it. He just wouldn’t.
Ayesha peered at him, clearly trying to see through whatever he was playing at. After a moment, though, she smiled.
“I’m supposed to guide humanity to… be nicer to dogs?” Steve said, half joking, but, as soon as the words left his lips, he realized that actually sounded like a worthwhile goal. “That… that’s not bad, actually.”
him is so gentle, so delicate, and the warmth of Tony’s cheeks seems to mix with the warmth of Steve’s hands and Tony can’t think, he’s just too close, too overwhelmed, nothing but
Steve knows well how – by keeping crazy hours working on projects and only going to sleep when absolute exhaustion hits, completely messing up his biological clock. But this isn’t the time to go into another lecture about Tony’s work habits. “Let’s get you out of these clothes,” he says instead. He loosens Tony’s tie, taking advantage of the way he’s staring blankly ahead to start unbuttoning his shirt.
“Go?” Tony asks with a raise of his eyebrows. His voice is casual, friendly. Steve feels something sink inside him at how at ease he seems, how this is definitely something he’s dealt with many times before. “Go ahead, Cap. I know you’re a busy guy.”
Steve shrugged with one shoulder. “It’s no different from you with cats.” He lowered his hand to scratch the dog’s chin. “What’s his name?”
The man standing in front of him doesn’t look the same as Tony remembers, though. His hair is a little shorter and he’s wearing casual gym clothes, his metal arm (Tony’s stomach twists as his eyes land on it) intact and visible.
A part of him misses Tony so much he’s eager to drink in every second of his presence, even by just staring at him from a distance. He knows better, though – he made this choice, and he knows why he did. If he had stayed in the room with Tony, he would never have been able to keep pretending, to not let Tony know he wanted to stay for good.
“Everybody is staring at us, I hope you know that,” Tony whispers, after a while. Steve doesn’t really care – he leans forward, his forehead almost touching Tony, as they spin. “For someone who shuddered at the thought of moving to a beat, you seem to be doing alright, Travolta.”
“I think you should lie down, now,” Tony said, and Steve, breaking from his trance, opened his eyes.
over and over in his brain, sweet like honey, spilling all over anything even remotely resembling a rational thought. “Are you okay?”
Tony took a sharp breath. He shouldn’t—Steve wouldn’t want him to say anything, for fuck’s sake. In a way, he was invading Steve’s privacy, by listening in to this, and he had no right to even try to—
The interior is, like everything else in the compound, exactly like the its real world counterpart. The entry hall is a huge open room that’s usually used for sparring, and it’s mostly empty, with the exception of a few weight racks and one lonely figure who turns towards the door as Tony comes inside.
“Right,” Steve says. He steps aside, gesturing for Tony to come in, still taking in how drenched he is. “But—but what are you
Stark just stared at him until he finally seemed to get it. “Wait, you don’t need to—Come on, you don’t need to
“If you don’t feel safe, I shouldn’t be here,” Steve interrupted, his voice surprisingly firm. “I’ll make up some excuse.”
Tony cuts himself off with a groan when Steve clenches around him, his wrist flicking, making a corkscrew motion on Steve’s shaft, then moving up to his head. When he increases the speed, he presses a wet, open-mouthed kiss to Steve’s collarbone, sucking a bruise as he keeps whispering, his words growing more and more impossible to discern as Steve’s pleasure builds, culminating when he can hear the broken note in Tony’s voice as he whispers,
If Tony’s brain were a research lab, he’s pretty sure now would be the time when the glowing rock in the study room turned out to be toxic, and every scientist was running around at the same time turning on alarms. “I. What?”
He opens his mouth, ready to spill some excuse to leave, but Tony beats him to it. “Just follow him, Cap,” he says, and the bitterness in his voice is like a slap on the face. “Come on, you want to leave, right? Do what you do best.”
Steve turns. Tony seems focused on the truffles, however, picking one up and looking at it as if it intrigues him somehow. “Dark chocolate, huh? Who’d know,” he says, almost to himself, before throwing the truffle inside his mouth.
Tony blinks, and Steve has to smile at how he looks right now – literally a ball of fabric and covers with a lonely head on top.
Except then Steve showed up, with a button up shirt and a leather jacket and a bright smile, and Tony’s brain promptly melted and leaked right out of his ears, so. They ended up going.
Since Tony doesn’t immediately answer (because there’s a marching band leading what is apparently an eternal fourth of July parade in his chest), Steve then apologizes for sending the memes in the first place, and, look—if nobody
Tony smiled. “Alright.” He gestured to a lab table behind him. “Do you want to get started? Usually I’d offer somewhere more comfortable,” his voice lowered a bit, with an edge of suggestion that sent a spark of heat down Steve’s belly, “but I’d like for JARVIS to gather data during the process, if you don’t mind.”
The next step is the bathroom, which, just like the bedroom, is full of tiny differences, small details that let Tony know it’s not just his. Two sets of towels, two toothbrushes, and so on. Tony sees a shampoo of his favorite brand except meant for blond hair and immediately knows:
“And I’m certain he’s just dying to receive them,” Tony says with an eyeroll. “Oh, yeah, Nick Fury, losing his sleep over whether or not someone is following protocols. Checking his e-mail over and over…”
Tony doesn’t feel angry, not anymore, not like in the bunker. The anger in the bunker had been all-powerful in the moment, but Tony came to almost miss it later, when time allowed the hurt to truly set in. Then, he’d get down to thinking about Steve’s actions, thinking of the
“Are you drinking?” he asks, without thinking, when he comes up to the bar. Tony raises his head and gives him a small, lifeless smile.
And then he felt when Stark’s body curled up around his—a warm, solid presence, unlike anything Steve had ever felt before. Stark’s arm was a light but undeniable weight over Steve’s waist, his hand lying almost over Steve’s belly, though never touching it. His knees found the back of his Steve’s thighs, and his breath brushed between Steve’s shoulder blades, and Steve’s back relaxed against his will, as if melting. His eyes were heavy, and his bones turned to dust, as if he was sinking, and Steve was shocked to realize he wanted it, wanted his body to melt against Stark’s shape, wanted it as he had never wanted anything else for a long, long time. For the first time in years, sinking in the dark didn’t seem scary.
“Wait? He can’t wait, that’s not—he can’t keep coming into the city, it’s not safe.” Tony pauses, nervousness emanating from him in waves. “How long are you planning to make him wait?”
Steve couldn’t help but smile, but his mind was already racing. Both dogs seemed well-groomed, clean and healthy. There was no way they weren’t chipped, and, from the lack of dirt in their furs, Steve guessed they had gotten lost recently, most likely getting loose during a walk. “Your family must be worried sick about you.”
Steve’s response is a full body shudder, and in a second Tony’s hands are on his belt, unbuttoning and taking it off with an ability that utterly shames Steve’s flimsy attempts to get rid of his earlier. He opens Steve’s pants with a similar ease.
The room glitches again, and Steve is shaking right now, his breath sharp and short. Tony turns entirely towards him, cradling his hand in between his, their knees bumping together.
“Maybe we should skip straight to dinner,” he said, fully aware of the way Steve raised his eyebrows in clear disapprobation. “I feel very hungry; don’t you, your majesty?”
Tony finds that it’s hard to talk and smile a lot at the same time. “Well, same here,” he says, and then presses another peck to Steve’s lips – a peck that quickly turns into three, because he can’t help himself. “I’m glad you liked it.”
“No, not yet. Hey,” he says, his other hand squeezing Steve’s. “I’m here. I’m here with you, okay? Focus on me.”
, possibly after a soothing bath – I can reconsider the possibility.” He tilts his head and plants a kiss on the side of Steve’s jaw, closing his eyes. “Now, sleep, okay?”
“Sure you wanna do that?” Tony says in a whisper, leaning in a little further. His proximity does nothing to diminish the growing arousal washing over Steve’s body.
They’re close now, face to face. For a young man, Tony is a little on the short side. It’s a trait he inherited from Howard himself – it’s one of the few things Howard can’t fault him for being.
That’s usually the moment where reality hits, where one comes back to earth, and the problem is that Tony doesn’t. Instead, he sinks his face on the curve of Steve’s neck, breathes in his sweat for a few moments, and then feels Steve’s strong hands stroking his back, as he whispers, “Maybe we should rest a little.”
Tony looks away. Then he runs a hand over his hair, sighing. “I know. I guess it’s just…” He gestures, encompassing the hall around them, the people partying in the living room. “Thinking about… a funeral here, of all places. All of us getting together to…” He shrugs exaggeratedly, though there’s nothing casual about his expression. “I don’t know – I’m talking nonsense, really, I’m probably already drunk.”
“Yup,” Steve says, finally just throwing the duvet over Tony’s body, pulling at the end to leave his face uncovered. “You figured me out. That’s exactly the plan.”
Tony would make light of it, mostly. He’d shrug exaggeratedly, rolls his eyes, make a flippant gesture and say “Who cares?” or “How should I know?”.
“I know it was also my fault,” Steve says, apparently taking Tony’s silence as agreement. “But something like that can’t happen. It’s not right.”
“You enjoy drinking,” he says, finally, and the judgement on his eyes is so clear, so sharp, that Howard is momentarily too taken aback by the sheer insolence of it to even be offended.
That’s not unusual – they spend most days in this manner, hardly ever crossing paths. Howard has his obligations, his duties. Tony… Howard doesn’t know what he does, and, to be honest, he prefers it this way.
It’s when he sees the king-sized bed that reality starts dawning on him, and his breath grows short and uneven. What are they doing?
“I should be going now,” Howard declares, raising himself from the chair. On the doorstep, he stops and turns to look at Tony one last time as he speaks: “I’m telling you the truth, Tony. You should be grateful.”
“They thought I was dead,” he said instead, and although he knew he shouldn’t, saying it felt good, as if a weight was being removed from his back. “In—In Iraq. They—they thought I couldn’t have survived. My whole unit—”
“Like, the actual, physical newspaper?” Stark raised an eyebrow at him. “That’s—well, that’s kind of adorable, honestly, but not the point. What I mean is, how well have you followed news about
Steve shifts, his large frame almost comical over the tiny stool. Distantly, Tony makes a mental note to get bigger chairs. “I suppose. They were… Very. Uh. Very open.”
“Because you already know,” Howard tells him. The burn on his throat is pleasant enough to keep him talking. “The words under our banner – you’ve read them. ‘Made of iron’. That’s what Stark men – you and me – are, Tony.” Another sip. “And iron, you see, it’s quite useful, for many things. It’s strong and it makes great weapons.”
“He’s still adapting, I know, you’ve said it a couple hundred times already. But that doesn’t explain anything, Tony. All jokes aside, okay, he isn’t ready for sex, I get that. But how does him not adapting to the 21st Century stop him from kissing you? Or holding your hand? Or, I don’t know, actually acting like your boyfriend at all?”
There isn’t a bar, so Steve finds the suggestion a little weird, but Tony doesn’t wait for him to reply, taking a step forward and stopping a waiter.
“So Dummy helped you find me,” he said, testing his ground. Stark nodded enthusiastically. “And you were… observing me for a while.” Stark nodded again, though this time with some amount of embarrassment. “But... why? Why did you need to find me—and, uh, I guess, Lola too?”
Most importantly, though, Steve didn’t like how he was holding the dog in the picture. Not only was he treating his pet like a briefcase, his face seemed almost annoyed, as if it was a favor to hold him.
“Then wake up,” Tony says, his own voice shaking as he holds Steve’s wrist. “Wake up, and this will be it. You’re not gonna be able to get rid of me.” He tries a lighter tone, but his insecurity slips in his voice, even as a slow smile turns the corners of Steve’s mouth upwards. “Trust me.”
“What happened?” Tony asked, dropping himself on the couch. The room’s luxury bothered him, because he could tell it was more of a passive aggressive move than sheer generosity. More of a
She seemed to be taken aback for one moment, but recovered quickly: “Oh? Do you have anything to add to the conversation, Captain?”
Steve doesn’t feel drunk yet, but there's time. He twirls the cup in his hand, standing awkwardly in the spot where Thor and Sif left him.
FRIDAY projects the images above them. It’s a scan of Steve’s brain, but not one Tony’s ever seen before.
Howard pulls his arm out of his hold. The anger is enough to sober him up a little, enough for him to stand up straight and stare down at Tony. “Get out of my way,” he grunts, walking past him.
He let it go, crossing his arms in front of his chest. He kept his eyes staring ahead as the floors lowered, sensing Steve’s silent gaze on him, lips still tingling from the touch of his mouth. He could feel Steve’s body heat, too, could remember those strong arms around his waist.
There was a silence in which Steve’s heart sank, and he took a breath to brace himself for the inevitable.
But then the moment passes, and the world doesn’t end. Tony is so close, Steve can feel the warmth of his body. He breathes deeply, enjoying the smell of Tony’s cologne.
And Steve. Through these adventures, Tony found out so much about him – little things like his favorite ice cream flavor (rocky road), the kind of movies he liked (mostly sci-fi and fantasy, but he was also fond of animations), the fact that he liked buying the newspaper to do the crosswords. He learned things about Steve that Steve himself couldn’t tell, like the way he walked, the way his eyes crinkled when he laughed, the way he brushed his bangs off his forehead when he was nervous or embarrassed. Things a person could only learn by spending time with him, which Tony was doing in ever-growing levels – and yet, worryingly, it never seemed to be enough.
.” Howard shakes his head, smiling, and decides: no reason to hold back anymore. He takes the bottle and fills his goblet, taking one long, delicious sip. “You know, if it wasn’t impossible, I’d think you had gotten him pregnant. That’s usually where most of those sudden feelings of love come from.”
Steve, Tony notices with a tight chest, seems to have realized this, too. He keeps raising his eyes to try and see if the children’s behavior has changed, and his disappointment is clear. His performance is a disaster, and he’s clearly embarrassed about it, and Tony’s heart is already in pieces just by watching it for a couple of seconds, so--
“We need to stop meeting like this,” a voice says beside him, and Steve is smiling before he even turns to look.
The five of them – Steve, Anakin, Lola, Monet and Frodo – were at the dog park, which was unusually empty. Steve let them loose, knowing they’d have more fun being able to roam around. The area was fenced and safe, and Steve sat on a bench watching them. Lola had decided to lie down and bask on the sun, and Monet and Frodo were apparently racing each other, both of their tongues happily hanging from their mouths. Anakin was attempting to catch his own tail.
Tony caresses his knuckles with his thumb, drawing a small circle on the back of his hand. “I was so angry at you. That damn phone—I wanted to throw it away when I got it.”
“The fuck?” Tony blurts, because he just can’t help it. Does Steve’s internalized homophobia run that deep? “What the hell are you talking about?”
happiness. It’s the kind of happiness that’s quiet and constant, like a leaf you keep inside a book that makes you smile every time you open it. It’s soft and yet it feels
They don’t speak on the way to the room. Tony says something, Steve thinks, but he can barely hear it, too focused on following his steps, on staying moving before he stops to think about what they’re doing and wakes up.
Their weird sync continues, on the rare occasions Tony whips out the armor to help the team with a mission. Without the sex, though, it doesn’t extend to anything else.
Steve’s cock is incredibly hard, bouncing against his stomach. Steve feels a hot wave of embarrassment when he notices he’s already leaking, but then he looks up and sees Tony’s face.
And Tony may not want this love, but Steve wants him to be loved. He wants him to be loved by someone who’s worthy, someone who doesn’t tense up at the slightest touch, someone who isn’t scared to make Tony love him back.
Steve’s heart raced. He had vivid memories of being mugged and getting into fights with bullies when he was younger and smaller. Nowadays, his size tended to keep ill-intentioned people away, but now… was that what was happening?
Still, the lack of responsive noises eventually become too much for Tony, who finishes cradling two-month-old Dorota (his undeniable favorite) and places her back in her crib.
“Don’t worry about it,” he says, coming closer. He’s sweaty from whatever workout he was doing, so thankfully he keeps his body away from Tony, leaning forward to lightly press his lips on Tony's forehead. “Not like I didn’t know what I was getting into when I married you,” he adds, a playful spark in his eyes, and Tony’s heart rushes pathetically in his chest in response.
Steve smiled, and the dog gave a few soft licks to his hand. His tongue hung from his mouth when he finished, and his eyes crinkled as Steve pet his head and he leaned further into his touch.
When he kneels, Howard studies him. His blonde hair glimmers in the faint lights of the candles. When he raises his head, blue eyes look up, firm and impossible to read. He’s surprisingly young.
“Okay,” Steve said quickly, eyelashes fluttering as his eyes blinked rapidly. His face had softened, even if he had blushed further, and he was breathing unevenly from their completely chase kiss. He inhaled slowly, his lips partially open as if he was saving the spot for Tony’s mouth. “That’s. That’s certainly a habit you’ve got, to shut me up.”
to not understand Steve. It’s bizarre, but he does. People alternatively elude or impress Tony, but they rarely
“As I thought,” Tony says, his voice low as he also comes closer. “So we’re all in favor. That’s a nice start.”
Tony feels as the covers are lifted back to his shoulders. He barely has the time to enjoy the warmth before a small kiss is pressed on his forehead.
Steve laughs this time, shaking his head as if he’s used to Tony’s bad sleeping habits. “Maybe I should walk you to our room so you don’t bump your head,” he jokes, but his blue eyes are earnest and concerned as he waits for a response.
Howard, who wouldn’t stand for such a reply from any other servant, laughs and shakes his head. Jarvis has always had too much of a soft spot for Tony. He spoils him terribly, always has done so.
was having to stay benched on the days after the battle for the ship. He couldn’t help Thor while he was guarding the perimeter just in case more HYDRA agents or aliens would show up. He couldn’t help Hulk and Tony to unload heavy machinery they got from the spaceship in a quinjet. Hell, he couldn’t even sit down to
“I didn’t want to hurt you,” Steve said, and that shut Tony up, his mouth closing with a click. Steve blinked, seeming a little shocked at the effect. Though, being Steve, of course, he soldiered on. “I know that’s what I did, in many ways. But I never wanted to. And I didn’t think it would matter, because it doesn’t change what happened, but after you—After…” He swallowed. “I just wanted you to know I didn’t mean to hurt you.”
, he wants to ask, as Tony pulls merely an inch away, his breath still warming Steve’s lips. But he also never wants to speak again – never wants to use his mouth to do anything that isn’t kissing Tony, feeling the scratchy brush of Tony’s goatee against his chin.
“Absolutely.” She turned towards Steve. Aside from a small glint in her eye, you really couldn’t tell she hoping for a chance to get into his star-spangled pants. “What do you think, Captain? Should I tell my servants to set the table for us?” She said
Through lunch, Steve can’t look away for one second. He stares as Tony eats his salad, as he rambles endlessly, at the way his hand holds the fork, at the blue circle on his chest.
“Sometimes,” Steve agrees. His hand comes up to Tony’s hair and ruffles it. “But don’t go getting any ideas in that genius brain of yours, ok?” His other hand, still around Tony’s waist, gives him a light squeeze. “You’re stuck with me, mister. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
he doesn’t, but even the thought is inebriating, and so is the way Steve leans into the kiss, how he doesn’t seem to mind Tony’s pulling him into an awkward position, how he doesn’t seem to mind anything as long as Tony is kissing him.
Something that Howard can’t quite understand flashes in Rogers’ eyes. “As far as I’m aware, he is your only son, my Lord.”
“I do,” Tony says. Then he tilts his head upwards, leaning in until his mouth touches Steve’s earlobe. “But allow me to tell you—" he presses a kiss that turns into the lightest suction, making Steve let out a tiny gasp “—I’m not the noisy one.”
“Morning,” Barnes grunts, between a mouthful of cereal. Looking now, without the shock from yesterday at the gym, he looks impossibly young. Tony wonders if those are Steve’s memories at play, better prepared to form an image of young Sargent James Barnes than of the deadly Winter Soldier.
Steve lets out an embarrassed chuckle, in all his boy scout cuteness, and, really, it’s a miracle, how this is the same man that rode Tony last night until he came so hard he almost went blind. It’s amazing.
Steve grins, something cheeky in his smile, and his hand goes to the back of Tony’s neck, gentle, but still big and firm. “Are you sure?” He asks, all the blue in the world directed at Tony, completely focused on him as Steve’s voice goes a few octaves lower, dripping with honey and promises. “I’d be willing to spare a few hours.”
“My full name is Antonio,” the man replies. He turns to Tony. “You can call me Stark.” Then he turns towards Steve, eyes taking in his body again, but this time he stops at his face, in a crystal-clear leer. “And—well, normally, I’d say
Anyway. There’s what he needs to do ― wake Steve up ― and what he wants to do ― go after Steve, tell him to leave his workout alone, take him to the couch and just
the heat emanating from Steve’s body, and he knew Steve could feel it, from the way his posture went rigid.
Not that Steve planned to confront the man at all, though. The only thing of value he had on him was his phone, and, though having to replace it would be a significant blow in his bank account, it was certainly not a reason to pick up a fight with someone who could be dangerous. He would much rather lose the phone and deal with the stranger right then and there, instead of risking being followed home.
Instead, though, Tony raises his hand and touches Steve’s hair, tenderly swiping a few of longest locks back.
On the phone, Pepper starts going on about papers Tony needs to sign, and all he can focus on is watching as Steve walks towards the sink and starts washing the dishes. Away from him. Tony sighs.
Steve finds out about Grumpy Cat a few hours before he learns she’s dead. In between, he texts Tony a bunch of pictures of her with a message reading “
But, right now, climbing on the bed next to Steve, he doesn’t feel angry. He just—wants Steve to come closer.
“That’s what I’ve been trying to find out,” Tony replies with a smile. “I think I have a guess, it’s in my notes, but I think I’m gonna wait until tomorrow before I give Shuri her bragging rights by asking.” He places the phone back in his pocket, and then shrugs. “Pretty cool, right?”
He was a moment too late to raise the shield, and, if the ray had been a laser, he would most likely be dead by now.
Part of it is curiosity – regardless of what Tony says, he has no memory of this man’s face, and he has no idea what he could possibly want from him. Another part is just that he longs for the excuse to finally have a goblet of wine. By now, the sun has lowered, and his tongue feels dry, sticking to the roof of his mouth as he speaks.
He feels Steve’s hand relaxing, allowing Tony to lead his movement, and he uses Steve’s fingers to tap the reactor—once, twice.
And to think Tony had naively believed they were doing well. As the first two days passed, they established a kind of routine: play the part while anyone else was around, try not to murder each other when they were supposed to be giving each other heart eyes, go back to the bedroom and ignore each other’s existence for about eight hours until they had to go out and face the aliens again.
Then Steve’s smile grows, and so does the warmth in Tony’s chest, and God, why isn’t Steve this happy all the time? Like, always?
“You don’t—” His expression is shocked. Stark frowns a little, intrigued. Tony gestures to his own chest. “Is your heart—Don’t you have any heart problems?”
“This belongs in a museum, Cap,” Tony argues. He might be a little heartbroken by the fact that Steve is not in a speedo – ever since Clint mentioned the beach vacation, Tony had been strategically instructing JARVIS to include “increasingly revealing swimwear” in the first suggested Google searches for any device used in the Tower, and maybe he dreamed of Steve choosing to break everyone’s expectations by wearing a G-string and making Tony’s day.
He finds Tony by himself, in an emptier part of the hall. He standing with his hands in his pockets, staring firmly at anything but Steve, and Steve wants to touch him so badly.
“Tony,” he says, a little like he’s gonna say something else, a little like it’s just a statement of fact. And it is, he thinks – a statement of the only thing he can think of and see now, overwhelming all his senses. A thousand sensations he can’t name in one word: Tony.
When Stark is only halfway through unbuttoning his shirt, Tony is already kicking his pants off his ankles, and he gets impatient.
Especially because – well. Steve is the type of sweet that quickly becomes dangerous, because it gets addictive. He’s clumsy and alternates between seeming a little shy to being overly enthusiastic, kissing him open mouthed and blushing like a schoolboy afterwards, but this somehow works in his favor, because he keeps Tony intrigued in a way very few people can do.
Then, to Steve’s surprise, he walks past him, to the fridge. “Do you want to drink anything? I have wine that’s supposed to cost a few million here – might be good for a sip or two.”
Steve really has no idea, because the next words are drowned out by his increasingly loud moans, as Tony keeps going.
He never stops tapping the table. He’s practically playing a song on his own, and he’s not even looking.
Steve just stared at him blankly, then spread his paws and slumped down again. His big blue eyes sparkled with something Tony recognized as a challenge.
“Clearly,” the other Tony says with an indulgent smile, his eyes still on Steve, wandering down from his face to his chest. Warmth descends over Steve’s body, following his gaze. “I don’t blame you though, darling,”—he stops at the front of Steve’s pants, where Steve’s undeniable arousal forms a clear tent, and moistens his lips. “You obviously had much more interesting things to think about.”
It’s an impulsive act, and, when he raises his head, he feels embarrassed, worried Tony will find it silly. But there are no words for the look on Tony’s face, when Steve’s eyes find his.
“Actually, we don’t,” Tony replied cheerfully. Steve’s hand was big and heavy on his arm, and the last thing Tony needed was to think of how warm it also was, and how he was going to miss holding it when this was all over. “Things tend to go exponentially better when we don’t.”
? Tony thinks, before he realizes that this is such a standard, basic, couple situation. It sounds almost comically normal, compared to the reality of his and Steve’s lives. He wonders if part of Steve craves that, this simple, uncomplicated domesticity.
Steve feels his eyes widening slightly. He hadn’t noticed anything particular about the sound before, but, now that Tony mentions, it is interesting. “How does it work?”
“No. Go on your run,” Tony says, his own voice gaining steadiness for what feels like the first time since he got inside the dream. He won’t do this, no matter how much he wants to taste the full extent of Steve’s kisses, how much he wants to know how his body shudders and shivers when it’s touched, how much he wants to hear his voice shaken and overwhelmed with pleasure, unable to say anything other than
, from his breath to his eyesight to the angle of his vision, had changed in a heartbeat, and Steve had a hard time figuring out what bothered him the most.
There are tears prickling in the corners of Steve’s eyes right now, and Tony wants nothing more than to lean forward and kiss them away, but he needs to get through this. For both of them, he must.
He forces himself to go through every page before he admits his defeat. Nothing there is salvageable. He hasn’t invented anything in years.
“Yeah.” Tony raised his hands in a surrender motion, but his eyes didn’t yield. “You’re right, he didn’t. I asked.” He stood up, finally dropping the casual act to look at Steve with a wounded expression. “Because you were avoiding me and I didn’t know what else to do. So I decided to surprise you during your doctor appointment. Sue me – you won’t be the first, or the last.”
So instead he went to the infirmary regularly, bore the endless tests Bruce and every doctor at SHIELD seemed to want to do with him, and generally walked around the Tower being useless, watching as his team learned to work without him.
Tony, everywhere – and, when Stark grabs his buttocks, he can only sigh, resting his head on his shoulder and leaving his throat exposed to Tony’s mouth, that eagerly begins kissing up his jaw.
at the mere thought, but he would never do it if there’s even the slightest chance Steve may not want it as much as he does. “And when we get back, we’ll… cuddle. Yeah. And, then, uh…” He searches his brain for something to say. “We can put Lord of the Rings on.”
“Fine.” Tony fishes the phone out of his pocket in a theatrical gesture that he makes sure to make as douchey as possible. “Hi, Pep, my love. What can I do for you?”
, what Tony saw all those years ago in his eyes, when Tony stepped inside a car and out of his life, wasn’t it? He had been… resigned. Tony never knew, and he knows he shouldn’t, because—they should have talked, the two of them. They’re not good at talking, but they should have. “I’m sorry I didn’t—”
“What if I want it?” he asks, and—and it’s seriously scary, how that single question is enough to make air return to Tony’s lungs, to shake him back to semi-solid ground when he previously felt like he was falling down an abyss. It’s terrifying, what Steve does to him.
“Bullshit,” Tony countered, and his words cut through the insistent cloud of Steve’s misery, certain and unwavering. “We need you—your… your leadership, okay? Hell, I’ll build an armor if that’s what it takes. Nobody’s benching you, Cap.”
But he knew how that would look, from the outside. That was Stark’s usual M.O., wasn’t it? With all those men he brought home – men who carried themselves differently, poised as if they were important people, passing by Steve in the hallway as if he was a stain on the wall. Stark would look at them and smile that leering smile, call them
By the time he’s done, all of them are utterly absorbed, and Tony sees more than one pair of heavy eyes doing that slow blink one does when trying to fight sleepiness. He closes off the night by helping everyone clean up the playroom just as Kevin arrives to get everyone to bed.
A wave of raw desire washes over him; he’s suddenly unaware of anyone else on the ship, in the goddamn universe, other than Tony, standing there with his bright eyes and grey hair.
It’s Tony, of course. But it’s Tony in a dark suit and a deep red tie, holding a glass in his hand. He has a smile on his lips, his characteristic goatee perfectly trimmed, and his hair is a light shade of grey, his features seeming more intense by the contrast.
could call me whatever you want, but for the sake of the situation let’s just go with Stark, as well.”
He tilts his head, coming closer so he’s pretty much speaking against Steve’s mouth when he says, “Good."
dramatic.” Stark waved his hand dismissively. “But I think I did want a second chance, and I think I made a promise in exchange for it. Problem was – well, whoever the people upstairs are, their system seems a little flawed, because, since I was forgetting everything, whatever it was I promised was
Tony never gets tired of, but he immediately takes a hold of himself, schooling his expression into something less tempted. “I promised Fury I’d send them to him by noon.”
He opens the door and comes inside, Steve following soon after. The suite is roomy and fancy, not unlike Steve’s own, but Steve is oblivious to any details of the decoration, blood roaring on his ears.
“I—” Tony stutters. He’s still shivering, and Steve hurries to grab two more towels and throw them over his shoulder before he realizes he should probably try getting Tony out of his wet clothes instead. He starts by trying to slip his soaked blazer off his arms, but Tony gestures, still holding the destroyed bouquet. “I’m here. You thought I wouldn’t be, but I am. And I… I bought you flowers.”
To Tony’s satisfaction, a flush bloomed on Steve’s cheeks in response, even as his frown deepened. “This is serious, Tony.”
in silence, unable to say it aloud, and felt something curling up next to his feet – Anthony, he thought, forgetting to feign distance from the cat in his mind, and he sank in Stark’s embrace a little further, emboldened by the dark.
He sat down on the couch to let Tony rest more comfortably. He figured he’d probably let him sleep there anyway, since he didn’t know when Tony would go back to his human form and how confused he would be then.
Tony looks up at him, lips pressed together in a thin line, and Steve just—really, really means it. He wants to take care of him so badly.
This one—it’s not so much of a theory, to be precise. It’s more of a thought that keeps leering, nagging at the back of Tony’s mind, sharp and dangerous like a thorn.
“CIA caught Tiberius on his way to his private jet yesterday evening. See, you’d know that if you'd answered my calls,” Rhodey pulls up a chair, sitting next to Tony. “He claims it’s the greatest scientific breakthrough of the century and that
His words sound ridiculous to his own ears, but something he says must go over well, because Tony’s expression grows softer, and his mouth curls in a small smile. “That’s probably a good idea,” he says. “Walking down the hallway naked is one way to ensure you never get another invitation.” He nods towards a pile of clothing on the other side of the bed. “Your shirt is in there.”
From the embarrassment in his demeanor, Tony guesses this is about the couple, who started sucking each other’s faces pretty heavily as soon as the grateful one released Tony.
he tells himself, and the image of Steve lying on that cold lab table is what does it, gives him courage to open the door and finally step outside.
“Have a seat,” Stark said, as if it was his house. Steve complied, though, because he just wanted to understand something,
Instead Steve’s eyes widened, and his mouth opened and closed, and his jaw clenched again, and he looked like Tony had just tried to kill
Very slowly, he reaches for Tony’s hand across the table. The warmth and the feel of his calloused skin makes heat prickle Steve’s neck. His breath shortens. Holding Thor’s hammer was easier.
“I--” he stuttered. He meant to say everything was alright, to tell Stark to go to sleep, but he couldn’t make the words come out.
“There you are,” T'Challa said, with a smile. He nodded to the crate corridor. “We got a new arrival today that could use some of your magic.”
Except it wasn’t. Instead, it was, according to what Bruce said later, some kind of small, focused time travel device. Bruce’s theory was that it was probably used to study alien specimens, being able to take a single sample of a plant or an animal and transform it into different phases of its life, allowing the species that owned the machine (whoever they were) to properly study it.
He tries to move his hips, desperate for more, but Stark keeps a firm hold, strong fingers digging into Steve’s hipbones as pushes himself even further – and then Tony pushes himself even deeper, and Steve can’t think, can’t breathe, can’t do anything but keep wanting, wanting to live like that, to never again feel anything that isn’t Tony’s cock, anywhere he can feel it.
There are so many moments in between. There are the moments where Tony wakes up in a frenzy, panicked, and Steve has to hold him to calm him down; there are moments when the reverse happens. There are the moments where they fight, driving each other crazy; there are the moments where they bicker in the cheesiest way possible, grinning so hard Steve’s cheeks hurt.
“Yeah.” Tony felt his eyes burning a little, just a little, because that was what happened when you stared too closely at the sun. “So, I heard habits are just—just a matter of practice. Uh. Very, very constant practice.” Steve’s grin widened, and yeah, that was as far as he could take without going back to the kissing. “So maybe we should just, just—”
“To put it simply,” Tony says. Stark’s fingers touch the surface lightly, and Tony flinches – he isn’t used to people other than Steve touching it. Stark immediately recoils his hand. “Sorry. It’s just—”
“Looks like we have an eager audience.” Slowly, he lowers his hands to Tony’s waist, his tongue moistening his lips. It’s deliberate and Steve knows he’s teasing him, but he also notices he’s giving Tony time to back away if he wants to. Tony doesn’t. “We should put on a little bit of a show, don’t you think, darling?”
“What—” Tony forces his eyes to open again, against protests from every part of his body. He manages to half-turn and catch a glimpse of the bedroom.
” Steve whines, and Tony presses a biting kiss on his neck that turns the whine into a loud moan. Steve’s hands go to Tony’s back, feeling his hard muscles slick with sweat, and Tony rolls his hips forward again, and Steve is suddenly terrified of losing it right then and there. “Tony, I’m gonna—”
On a remarkable occasion, Steve sends in a “important Avenger news – waiting for your thoughts, Iron Man” e-mail, and, when Tony opens it, he’s rick-rolled in front of his entire office.
His eyes are closed, but Steve keeps watching him, wrapped in the lines around his mouth, the subtle but delicate curl of his lashes. “Thank you for the flowers,” he whispers, because it occurs to him he should, and he hadn't yet. “And for being a great boyfriend.”
“Hey, Cap.” Clint throws himself on the couch next to him and leans, trying to take a pick at his phone. It’s rude, but Tony can’t really blame him, because he’s one step away from offering actual money to find out what made Steve laugh like that. “What are you looking at?”
“Yes, you are,” Steve counters, voice so fond Tony momentarily forgets how to form words. “But I thought you and Ms. Potts were still together. And even if you weren’t… I mean. Fella like you,” Steve looks down for a moment, leaving Tony to marvel at the fact that his eyelashes cast tiny shadows. “Didn’t think you’d be interested.”
Five seconds, a whole lifetime, just for him to get the chance to look one more time in those eyes. Steve takes the moment to study those irises, the mix of gold and light brown and a few, small traces of green.
“I can see why,” Stark says, sounding strained. “But before he finishes melting what’s left of our supposedly brilliant brains, darling, may I ask where do you keep your lube?”
At the top of the staircase, Tony sees him on the couch, and yeah, he’s laughing. Not politely chuckling or awkwardly forcing a laugh, mind you, but actually, genuinely having a belly laugh, complete with a pink flush all over his face, his eyes turning into tiny blue streaks as he wipes them with back of his hand, catching his breath.
It was only after he worded the question that Steve remembered the obvious: he was the only person in the park.
“Trust me, Captain,” Howard replies, nonchalant. “If you marry my son, you’ll be drinking me off the table in a month.”
“Look.” He stopped walking, turning towards Steve and leaning closer to whisper. “We have five days of this ahead of us, Cap. Call me crazy, but I think if we don’t spend the entire time fighting over every little thing, we might have a chance of actually pulling this off.”
“After you dethrone the king?” Howard asks. He means for it to sound mocking, disbelieving, but Rogers gaze never wavers, and he gives him a single nod in response.
They had enough to worry about as it was, or at least Tony had. He had to be in love with Steve while simultaneously
As he talks, something happens – it’s as if the light bends, the room around them distorting slightly.
. He—He floats?” Steve took a step closer, and the Pomeranian leaned in and touched his cheek with his tiny, cold nose. “How?”
“I… I apologize. I don’t mean to be impertinent,” he says, tentative. “I realize this can come as a surprise, but I’m asking in good faith. I would never mock you or your family, Lord Stark.”
“Wonderful,” he said, after tasting the dish. It probably was, but the taste was neutered by how full of knots his stomach felt, in anticipation of
Back then, the all-consuming rage and hurt felt so huge it was almost overwhelming. It was easier, in those times, to pretend it was still about Barnes, when it never was, not really.
“Captain,” Howard replies, intrigued. He had expected a hardened, grizzly warrior. Instead, the man in front of him looks like a painted image of a knight – the beautiful, almost angelical image dreamed up mostly by those who have never known a real battle. Howard half-expects him to inform him he has just defeated the dragon that kept the princess prisoner. “I understand you wanted to speak to me?”
“Huh?” he says, eyes blinking open slowly, taking in the mostly dark room. It’s that weird, off-putting feeling of waking up:
“Shhh. Let me keep going. I have a point here, I promise. Let me recap: We suck at talking to each other. We fought, and we hurt each other, and in this life you dreamed up, nothing of that ever happened, because if it did, you couldn’t make yourself believe you deserved this.”
Steve takes a moment to answer. Tension builds up in his muscles, his back stiff even against the soft bed. “Yeah,” he finally grunts, because it’s true. He slept better than he had in months.
Stark doesn’t say anything, thoughtful, so Steve leans in and presses a kiss to his cheek. Then he uses his hand to reach down and pull Tony’s naked leg over his waist.
Time goes by fast. For all that Tony complains, really, he loves those children. They’re so ridiculously
Steve, who’s mentally cursing out both his heater for being broken and himself for not having taken up Tony’s offers to fix it earlier, can barely grasp what he means. “You’re—What?”
“When you were talking—” Steve continued, oblivious to the elevator doors opening behind him, completely within listening distance. “I wanted to say something, but I just…” Tony didn’t recognize the two people who stepped outside, but they were both very golden, and, from their wide eyes,
“He won’t say anything,” Tony counters. “Besides, it’s not as if you will be meeting for the first time.”
“I mean, like, always,” he blurts out, speaking very fast because he’s sure if he stops to think he won’t be able to pick the proper words, so it’s better to just test his luck. “Uh, not all the time, obviously, but, like, every day, or, or whenever you wanted to sleep, really. Because it would, you know—it would be your room.” Then Tony stops, both because he doesn’t know what else to say and because Steve’s smile has rendered him incapable of forming words.
Or—on second though, no, he didn’t. For all the old issues he was having to face again, the thing that bothered Steve
When Tony dies, Steve has his arms around him, Tony’s head resting on his chest in a hospital bed. It’s not the first time Steve has held his body, but it hurts just as much.
Tony’s arms tighten around him. Steve thinks he shivers, but it might be just an impression. “You’re welcome. Thank you for being you.” The words float between them, Steve’s heart swelling, and maybe Tony catches on the weight of it, because he adds: “Now, how about we get some sleep?”
“I hope so,” Rhodey says, and the lack of agreement stings inside Tony’s chest, the mere possibility of the alternative too painful for him to even acknowledge. Rhodey lands a hand on his shoulder. “I want him to get better too, Tony. We all do. But you’re just…” He swallows, and Tony knows he’s thinking of how much he wants to spell it out, trying to spare Tony the hurt by not saying what they both know to be true. “You know what he does to you.”
Steve’s eyes widen, and his expression is impossible to read, because just looking at his stupid gorgeous blushed face is already too much for Tony right now. He just wants to turn around and leave.
“Hey, everyone,” he says, and some of the kids break out of their trance, grinning. Tony finds Steve’s eyes, worried that he’s going to be upset Tony is stealing his scene, but there’s clear relief written on his face, so he keeps going. “So, guess what—world-saving emergency.” He raises his eyebrows in an exaggerated warn, and by now all the children are fully awake. Nothing like the threat of mortal danger to kill the spectrum of a five-year-old’s boredom. “Cap is needed to fight some aliens.”
“So what I want to say is that even if our story is not the, uh, most traditional, me and Tony—uh, my husband,” Steve continued, blinking rapidly, seemingly remembering the situation they were in. “We’re happy. And I—”
Tony comes first, this time. He sinks over Steve’s body, boneless, and after a second he’s already whispering apologies, hand lowering to take hold of Steve’s cock. Steve lets him stroke him with those skillful fingers, but he’s stuck on the look in Tony’s face, on the expression he got when his orgasm hit. The way his eyes fluttered shut and his mouth opened. The feel of his body shaking.
Tony spends almost fifteen minutes fidgeting and pacing in the bedroom before deciding that fuck it, he’s already knee-deep in torture, why not just poke the wound where it’s freshest and most sensitive?
Steve couldn’t help but grin. Still, he needed to lay down, and that required some more awkward maneuvering if he didn’t want to accidentally push the dogs off. He tried to shift as slowly as possible, but Tony immediately reacted when he started moving, his paws reaching up in an attempt to touch Steve’s face.
Steve makes a strange face, which Tony guesses is his disapproval increasing, and then leans back, standing up.
The next morning, Tony finds him in the middle of breakfast. His hair is messy and he’s still in his sleeping attire.
Sam doesn’t seem to agree, though. When Steve replies, he rolls his eyes and huffs a breath, saying: “Well, be sure to tell me when it does.”
Steve complies, his eyes searching Tony’s face, blue pools of confusion and pain and a spark of what Tony can only conclude is fear. “Tony—”
Fortunately, nobody asked for details about the alleged divorce, so at least Tony and Steve weren’t forced to relive it anytime they were doing small talk with someone with two heads. It would be a lie, though, to say being around Steve all the time didn’t make Tony think about it.
Steve had a lot of experience fighting with Tony. He knew what Tony looked like while angry—his eyes ablaze, his mouth throwing sharp quips meant to hurt instead of distract. He knew what Tony looked like while hurt—his eyes glimmering, his voice shaking ever so slightly as he whispered,
“I’ll be fine,” he says, giving Rhodey a confident grin. Then he closes his eyes as Bruce starts the countdown, and, before he knows it, he’s gone.
“Like I said,” Steve’s voice sounded icy with fury. “Enough. You’re completely out of line here, High Priestess. I—I thought you’d respect my relationship if I shared with you our—our history.” His hands clenched into fists at his sides. Tony wondered if he wasn’t looking at him at any point to keep the farce authentic, not allowing reality to come through. “But clearly you are not interested in doing that.”
Tony took a breath, but no air reached his lungs. He shivered, unable to look away from Steve, momentarily forgetting to be a genius, to worry about the danger they were in. Surely Steve wasn’t…
“Well, clearly it has, since she’s giving herself one more chance to slip her room number into your pocket.” Technically, the palace’s rooms didn’t have numbers, but Tony didn’t have any time to care about that. He was way too busy trying to pry the mental image of Steve hooking up with the Golden Lady out of his head. “Did you talk about this with anyone?”
“Oh, please,” she countered. “Maybe on Earth people are stupid enough to fall for your blatant façade, Mr. Stark, but you’ll find that higher beings aren’t so easy to trick.”
Tony’s smile grows, sly. “Hmm, yes, I bet you are.” His fingers start moving in a light tease, slick with lube, and God—when did Tony even slick them up? “But not right now, baby.” Steve feels light pressure as the tip of one finger breaches him, and he tenses up a little.
There’s a moment of silence where Steve just stares at him, and Tony feels his face heating and his stomach churning.
“It’s just—well, it’s like you said. Sometimes it’s still a shock. Back in my day, I mean, of course it happened, but it had to be under wraps. There were specific places where you could go, but you had to be careful.”
Steve’s next words were swallowed by Tony’s lips. Which, yeah, it was far from the smoothest kiss of Tony’s life – their noses bumped awkwardly at Tony’s quick advance, and Steve stumbled backwards a little, and Tony kind of had to throw his arms around his neck to stop both of them from falling.
“And, to be honest, I don’t know why you would do something like that,” Ayesha tilted her head, her eyes sparkling with barely disguised angry. “Unless you really thought me and my people to be
Steve’s frown deepens, and there it is, the Captain America Glare of Disapproval, in its purest, most judgmental form. “Tony. You know what I’m talking about. I know I have been… I shouldn’t… ” He looks away, his flush deepening, taking a sharp breath. Almost as if he’s composing himself. “Listen, Tony, this isn’t fair – for God’s sake, you’re in a relationship.”
Steve followed him. He barely paid attention in the bedroom, though; his eyes were immediately drawn to the huge bed in the middle, covered with layers of fancy, red bedding.
“I’m gonna take a shower so you don’t kick me out of the bed for stinking,” he says, rolling his shoulders forward in a stretching movement. Tony feels a little hypnotized by the muscles of his back, so much he barely feels thankful when Steve closes the bathroom door behind him.
Tony scoffed. “I don’t know? To talk, maybe? Perhaps it was different in your time, Cap, but nowadays, when you’re hooking up with someone, it gets a little weird if they just start ignoring you out of the blue.”
“Then we know he’s an imposter,” Tony says, his voice soft as he raises a hand to gently brush back a lock of Steve’s hair. Then his smile grows, almost predatory. “If he’s me, there’s no way he’d ever refuse the chance to have you.”
“Here,” he said. Steve opened his eyes, and Stark raised a glass of water to his lips. The side of his body touched Steve’s, and Steve should have pushed him away, he
Fair enough, Tony supposes. “You know… this. Us.” He gesticulates awkwardly between them, and Steve’s smile grows, fonder, giving Tony some extra courage. “It’s been… so, so great. I want you to know this.”
He’s headed for the last room, from where Natasha sent him a signal when she confirmed that was, indeed, the place they were looking for. As he rushes towards it, FRIDAY shares some readings of tech waves and signals she picks up, but Tony doesn’t hear it. He can’t hear anything right now.
if he didn’t want him. At the end of the day, to Tony’s initial surprise, Steve is every bit as good as the legends said he was – maybe, Tony thinks to himself, watching as Steve patiently demonstrates to Thor how to chop onions, even more.
On his way outside, he thinks of Tony, wonders what is he doing. However, Howard knows he’s either warming the bed of a prostitute, or stuck in his chambers frantically working. Somehow, both options are equally infuriating.
After Peter and Gamora kiss, they’re pushed with everyone else for pictures, and from there it’s impossible to find a moment to speak with Tony alone, since they’re always surrounded by people. Steve doesn’t get a chance to do that until the reception.
They break away momentarily, and even as Steve pants, he can’t help but notice the gorgeous flush in Tony’s skin, how his chest heaves up and down as he breathes.
Tony laughs, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. “Right,” he breathes, slowly. His index finger taps the table in a steady rhythm, occasionally joined by his thumb. Steve tries to see if he can make out where the tune is from, but he doesn’t recognize it. “Nothing better to do, huh? Makes sense. I mean, what else do people even do at weddings?”
Stark stared at him in silence for a beat, then sighed. “Listen, it’s not what it looks like. Well… Okay, in fact, it is a
“Don’t be stupid,” he countered. His hand climbed to his chest involuntarily, where he could feel his heart pounding heavily. “They'll figure us out. You can’t—”
. He looked handsome then, as he does now, but still the difference in setting coils up Steve’s insides, makes something warm and gooey flood his chest.
Steve feels like he’s floating, and he thinks he must’ve fallen asleep, because the light touches of Tony caressing his neck and kissing his face are too good to actually be happening. He forces his eyes to stay open, though, reluctant to miss that sight of Tony, over him, touching him. He’s so beautiful it’s impossible, and since this seems to be a night for impossible things, Steve wants to at least believe he can be Tony's a little longer.
And Tony is cursed. He will hear the echo of these words for the rest of his life, and every sound he hears from now on will pale in comparison, every song meaningless and weak compared to Steve Rogers’ voice saying he loves him.
“I’m the damn dog you’re looking for.” Stark gestured with his free hand aimlessly. “It’s me. There’s no small, helpless ball of fur lost on your block waiting to be rescued by you and your… your… shoulders.” His hand awkwardly waved towards Steve’s chest. “You don’t have to keep looking for it in the fucking rain. I’m right here, and I’m
Steve’s fist slammed against the door again. Rationally, he imagined Bucky didn’t mean for the message to sound as it did –
“Damnit,” Steve said, still looking around. He spotted the doorway to the park – the gate was closed, but the bars were wide enough for a small dog to squeeze in between. “He can’t have gone too far. I’d have seen it if he had ran away—”
The question takes Steve by surprise because of how genuine it seems. It’s as if Tony honestly doesn’t know the answer, and it’s almost bizarre—it’s as if he's asking Steve if he needs air to live, or if water is wet.
“I love him,” Tony interrupted, his own voice frantic, but although he was ostensibly talking to Ayesha, he wasn’t looking at her. In fact, she could just as well not exist, as far as he was concerned. He tightened his grip on Steve’s shoulder, trying to get Steve to look at him. “I do. It might seem impossible, but I, I do, I—”
“You want me to leave?” he asked, hurt piercing through his chest like thorns. He blinked rapidly, schooling that pain into anger, because anger was better, was safer. “
time – stung, a reminder of a time where this was the only voice Tony seemed to have to talk with him. They had been past that for a while, now –
Ayesha tilted her head, seeming both amused and intrigued. “Right,” she said, her eyes impossible to read. “It was quite a miracle that brought the two of you together, as I was told.”
He’s shocked to find himself in his workshop. For a moment, he wonders if their plan failed, but the absence of both Rhodey and Bruce lets him know this is not the real world.
The following dates only consolidated that reality. He and Steve went to the Natural History Museum, to Coney Island, to the Brooklyn Bridge. The city Tony knew since his childhood seemed to gain new life when he was exploring it through Steve’s eyes. Steve had so many stories, and so many interesting insights about how things had or hadn’t changed, that it made Tony feel that New York was, suddenly, the most interesting place in the world. He started to spend most of his time at the Tower, only going to Malibu when Pepper really, really demanded his presence.
“Never,” Steve says, after a moment, his voice solemn and serious, as if he’s never been more certain of anything else. “I would never regret it.”
Then Steve feels Tony come up behind him, his chest pressed against Steve’s naked back, and he can’t help but shiver at the contact with his lean, solid frame. “You know,” Tony whispers, silky voice caressing the back of Steve’s neck, making Steve inhale sharply. “If a kiss gets you like that, maybe you won’t be able to handle this.”
Which is why, when it stops, Tony is aware he has no right to miss it. He’s leaving the team, after all, and, having just come out the Ultron disaster, the last thing he and Steve need is another reason to be tense around each other.
They hadn’t thought of locking the door, but normally, there would be no reason to. Aside from the rare interruption from their teammates, there was no danger of them being surprised in Tony’s penthouse – the security was top notch. Even on the off-chance someone managed to sneak inside, FRIDAY would have detected any intruder immediately and sounded the alarms.
Steve watches as he chews, a little wary. He and Tony don’t speak alone very often, anymore. Not for any particular reason - there’s no lingering animosity between them. Apologies were exchanged, after Thanos; everything else had faded in the dust, among all their lost friends.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Stark sighed. “Listen, I’d transform right now if I could just do it on command, but it doesn’t work like that. I just need you to…”
Bucky had attempted to talk to him, afterwards. He tried harder than Gail did. She only talked to Steve about it once, and though she apologized, when he asked if it would have been different if he came back sooner, she didn’t respond.
They don’t even get to the bedroom. In the following times, though, Tony does tweak things a bit to get Steve to his penthouse, because, well, he’s not 21 anymore, okay? There’s only so many times he can handle awkward positions over the couch or the wall, and he has a king sized bed for a reason--to enjoy opportunities like this.
When he was halfway through it, having just asked a man inside a café if he had seen a Pomeranian walking by, the rain started. Steve sighed, resigned to getting wet, and pulled his hoodie over his head.
“Nice one.” His hand gives Steve’s arm another light squeeze, and he’s closer now. Steve can see the touch of grey in his temples, could count every single one of his laugh lines. “You’ve improved your drinking game,” he says. His voice sounds as if he’s complimenting Steve on something else, bigger than drinking. It’s almost silly, but a purposeful type of silliness, almost directed, almost like…
Now, their current position is way too comfortable for Howard to bother with schemes of ascension. But that doesn’t mean he’d turn it down, if it was offered to him on a silver platter, as it seems to be the case.
Stark gave him a satisfied nod. “Yup. So I started looking for you, and, of course, now I had company,” he gestured towards the tiny Pomeranian, who gave an excited yap as if he understood every word. “I think he’s meant to be, like—a spirit guide, maybe? Anyway, I started calling him Dummy and it just stuck.” He shrugged. “It was really stressful to be around him at first – no offense, but I’m more of a cat person – but soon I found out
“I’m fine,” Steve hissed, finally managing to clumsily get himself to stand up. God, he hated that cane. Hated having to use it, and, more than anything, how helpless he became without it.
“You know people had sex in the forties, right?” Rhodey says once, in the middle of one of their many (
On that particular day, Steve was finishing organizing a few piles of adoption papers when T’Challa, another regular volunteer, stepped inside the reception area.
Stark moved a little closer, and then he stirred, turning towards Steve. In the dark, it was hard to see his face, but Steve could make some of his features, and just that already clutched his stomach, his heart rushing when he felt Stark’s breath brush his face.
So Steve sat there, alone in the medical area, listening as SHIELD’s doctors took his vitals and gave him a rundown of all the ails and health issues he perfectly remembered having. It was like being trapped in a nightmare you already had several nights in a row, and that you thought you wouldn’t have when you closed your eyes to sleep again, but then you did.
There it was – the small, fluffy Pomeranian he had seen at the park, blinking wide brown eyes at Steve, his tongue hanging happily from his mouth. His tail wagged when he saw Steve, and he lunged for him, running to stand on his back paws and jump at him.
“Didn’t mean to wake you up,” Steve whispers, hand caressing Tony’s hair, and Tony doesn’t get it, because, honestly, he’s totally okay with being woken up with kisses. In fact, if Steve keeps them on the area including his forehead and the top of his head, Tony is pretty sure he can easily drift back to sleep again, and he’ll probably have nice dreams. “Sorry.”
Tony chuckles, because he barely remembers this one, and because Steve seems happy and relaxed and this makes it easier for him to laugh.
Next to him, Tony is a lot quicker, undoing each button on his shirt with efficient, fast fingers. When he’s done, he pulls it off his shoulders and tosses it aside carelessly. Steve’s mouth goes dry at the sight of his solid, tanned chest, tinged by the faint blue glow of the arc reactor.
“It doesn’t mean you have to run for Congress, if that’s what you’re thinking,” Stark replied. “It’s nothing huge, really. You just need to do what you’re good at, and encourage others to do the same.” His eyes seemed to soften for a moment, and Steve noticed they had lighter traces of brown, looking almost honey in the faint light of his living room. “And I’ll help you.”
“Okay,” Tony says, hands climbing to Steve’s shoulders, pushing him away lightly. His face must spell out his temptation to do otherwise, because Steve’s expression is amused, but thankfully, he doesn’t question Tony’s behavior, only nodding and still taking a moment too long before finally standing up and turning his back to the bed.
Dying is quick and easy, the complete opposite of getting frozen. For a moment, Steve sees nothing but void – but then he feels warmth against his eyelids, solidness under his back, and he blinks, once, twice, and opens his eyes.
Steve took a steadying breath. He felt foolish – now that he was actually starting to calm down, his reaction to a simple bad dream seemed nothing short of pathetic. The images of the dream dissolved slowly, fading like old pictures, and all that was left was a strong, almost overwhelming sense of embarrassment.
,” Tony argued. Steve shook his head, moving towards the door, and, in an impulse, Tony reached for his shoulder, grasping it. “Look, just—stay, okay? It’s, it’s fine.”
Steve blinks himself awake and glances at Tony. His face is focused, mouth curled, the tip of his pink tongue sticking out as he thinks. He’s frowning, a wrinkle between his eyebrows, but he doesn’t seem upset, just intrigued. His eyes are curious, endless shades of brown and gold, shining with a spark of interest. Sun rays come through the window and bring out the stripes of silver in his hair.
“You know,” Barnes says, grabbing a mug of coffee and taking a sip. He smiles before continuing. “You’re good for each other.”
At the end, when they’re over, breathless and sweaty, Tony wraps his arms and legs around Steve and whispers, his voice frantic and desperate and delicious:
is another thing that shouldn’t make Steve tongue-tied, but it does. He manages to nod as Tony walks him to the bar, hand descending from his shoulder to his bicep, not really pulling him, just… touching him, very casually and very close, as if this is something they do all the time.
Tony nods. “To Vision not asking me to walk him down the aisle,” he quips, and Steve chuckles, rolling his eyes. There’s something comforting, he thinks, about Tony remaining his witty, snarky self, even after they watched the world burn and rise from its ashes. He grins at Steve’s reaction, his eyes so bright that when the saloon’s light hits them, they could be golden. “To Vision and Wanda,” he echoes, clinking his glass with Steve’s, still grinning.
It seems to work – a pleasant shadow comes between the bed and the evil sunlight, and Steve leans closer to him. Tony can’t fully see his face in the dark, but he feels his strong, warm hand cupping his face and the soft press of lips against his cheek.
“Okay.” Tony turns again towards the bartender, still holding Steve’s arm. His free hand points to Steve with his thumb. “And a beer for him,” he says, and—and Steve’s stomach clenches and flutters, as if a hundred butterflies had taken flight inside him at the same time. The way Tony says it, the way Tony is
Tony grins. “Yeah, we are.” He rocks a little on his heels, but makes no movement to touch Steve, which Steve guesses is probably what he should have expected. With their… arrangement, he finds, there’s not much reason for them to touch outside of the bedroom.
He takes a deep breath and sits down at the wooden stool, trying to make some sense of his notes. Heat prickles down his neck and he can feel sweat forming at his temples. He used to spend days here – now, he can barely stand a few minutes.
, anything – but, before any words came out, Steve walked to the bathroom, closing the door behind him.
“Okay, fine, I did.” There’s a strident note in his voice, and a burst of fondness floods Steve’s chest. “I messed it up, okay? It was supposed to be—I wanted to—” He gestures aimlessly with the soaked flowers. “I messed it all up.”
“That’s a weird time to get modest, you know,” Tony continued. Steve’s stomach felt tied up on itself, in a painful knot of anxiety. “I’ve seen a lot from you now, so that ship has kind of sailed, buddy.”
“I… I think it could,” Bruce says, a little hesitant. “But we’d still be putting someone else under… under this.” His nerves makes his voice go slightly softer. “There’s no telling what type of reactions—”
Tony took a few steps closer to him. Steve was still panting, looking at him with sky blue loving eyes.
When Tony turns, Barnes’ image is slightly wavy under the kitchen lights, and his pale blue eyes makes Tony think of another pair of blue eyes, one he has loathed and loved for years and now desperately needs to see again.
A month after the disaster in Siberia, Tony waffles between calling or not calling Steve, twisting the flip phone on his hand.
He stopped, unable to finish the sentence, and Stark gestured enthusiastically to the room around them, where Monet was napping on the carpet, Anakin and Frodo were chasing each other in circles and Lola was still staring at them with a serious expression. Dummy yapped at him happily, then jumped and did a pirouette.
The other one seemed insulted by his diplomacy. “This is a public space! It isn’t proper for anyone to be—”
“Oh, hey, look what the cat dragged in,” says a voice from behind him, making Tony jump, startled. As he turns around, he sees Sam sitting behind the kitchen counter, eating a bowl of cereal.
“That’s one way of putting it,” Tony says, and his voice, casual with the tiniest hint of possessiveness, sends a shiver down Steve’s spine. He crosses his arms in front of his chest, and Steve is a little grateful that he hadn’t been able to take Tony’s shirt off yet, because the last thing he needs in this situation is the sight of Tony’s naked torso. “So, me—Tony—should I call you Tony?”
He runs the comb through Tony’s hair, taming the wet curls. The result reminds him of the Tony he used to see in the news, with his hair slicked back with expensive gel. That was way before Steve knew him as a person, and even longer before Steve started knowing him as
Rogers doesn’t say anything, only watches him in silence. Howard finishes his drink and pours himself another one.
Tony doesn’t need to look at it to know it’s the same one from the wedding picture. He decides to stop searching the closet.
He’s a little clumsy as he moves closer until his cock is only a few inches from Steve’s face. Steve watches as it bobs, flushed, and he can’t help but lean in, his hands going over Tony’s thighs, burying his face in Tony’s crotch. He inhales, pleased by the musky scent of Tony’s cologne mixed in with the smell of sweat and precome all over Tony’s girth.
Tony, on the other hand, is clearly wary. He makes a few quips and Steve can grasp an element of bait in them that would absolutely have worked with him years ago, making them snap at each other within seconds. This time, he doesn’t fall for it, replying to them with a smile, and he gets to watch as Tony’s armor lowers a little, as his grin grows more authentic.
“Your shirt is inside out,” he says. Steve looks down hurriedly, and he hears a chuckle. “Nah, I’m kidding. I wouldn’t let you know if it were.” He winks, and Steve feels himself smiling.
The kiss stretches, growing slow and lazy, and when they pull apart, they’re so close Tony can count Steve’s eyelashes, and he feels hazy. Part of it is sleepiness, and the other part is just the floaty feel of being drunk on Steve Rogers that he’s been getting so much lately.
Steve’s flush deepened, and he smiled bashfully. “I… I thought you were just helping me. You know, spending time with me, making me acclimatize.”
“I don’t know, maybe because you’ve been locked up here for two days?” Rhodey crosses his arms. He’s in his uniform, a sign he’s already dealt with enough shit for today. And he’s been handling a lot of shit to let Tony work on Steve here, instead of handling him over for the CIA to take care of. “Or maybe because you didn’t bother taking any of my calls or answering any of the messages I’ve left you? Take your pick.”
He swallows another glass to stop himself from saying something reckless. Rogers watches him in silence.
Steve scratched Lola’s belly and wondered which one of them could be right, then promptly forgot all about the topic.
Steve didn’t bulge. “Do you have anything that can prove he’s yours?” The man just stared at him, as if Steve’s question was absurd. “A picture? Anything?”
Steve, clearly, didn’t think that, because his hand tightened a little on Tony’s arm, seemingly in a reflex. “
“Gorgeous,” Stark sighs, and Steve’s dick twitches at the praise. He gives Tony’s length a wet kiss and lowers his hand to touch himself, but Stark stops him, holding his wrist. “No, none of that.” He lowers himself over Steve’s body, his chest against Steve’s back, his erection pressed against Steve’s ass as he comes close enough to whisper in Steve’s ear: “That’s for me to take care of, sweetheart.”
Howard stares at him, but Tony doesn’t seem to notice. He crosses the room and stands next to the throne, but he barely acknowledges Howard as he does so, his entire attention on Rogers. His eyes seem even wider than usual, as if his gaze wants to swallow the man whole. He joins his hands in front of his body, clutching his fingers.
Tony sighing, nobody can prove anything, regardless of what the dopey smile on his face might suggest.
“What? Sorry for what?” Tony’s grip tightened around Steve’s wrist, and they had a mini tug war, as Steve tried to get loose without putting his super strength to play. “What the hell are you talking about? Am I supposed to just—”
Steve has no idea what he’s thinking, but then again, that’s the whole thing with Tony, isn’t it? No one has any idea what he’s thinking, ever. No one, and especially not Steve.
There was a pause, and then Tony leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Steve’s skinny, uneven shoulder. “As many as you’d want,” he whispered, his voice reverent in a way that made Steve shiver.
“Hey.” Tony takes his free hand to Steve’s shoulder, tries to make his voice as sincere as possible. “Not sure how this brilliant strategic mind of yours managed to miss this, but anyone with a brain would be interested in you. And I can guarantee this has nothing to do with the serum – not only because you were already pretty hot before, if sepia toned photographs are anything to go by, but because you’re just—you. I mean, crap, I could barely believe it when you agreed to go out with me. I almost rented out the Louvre just because I wanted the place to be good enough for you.” Steve’s mouth falls open, and, okay, Tony is rambling now, he should just stop talking, but he can’t. “Uh, okay, I didn’t mean to say that, so maybe you could just ignore it, but anyway, my point is, you’re just… really, really great.”
“Steve?” Stark called, and when Steve looked up, his light blue eyes seemed hesitant again, and Steve couldn’t find it in himself to ask him to sleep on the floor. It would not be fair, and deep down, Steve couldn’t bear the thought of trying to spend the night on that bed alone.
that Tony could even ask that, because, no—it’s not good, it’s so much more than good, it’s everything and Steve needs more, needs
Tony watches as he goes away, and when Steve turns his head to take one last look, he’s smiling, and Tony can’t help but smile back.
Tony smirks. “Thought I was the one who talked too much,” he says, before diving in to Stark’s mouth. Stark is pushed back a little, and Steve can imagine what he’s feeling, knowing full what it’s like to receive one of Tony’s hungry, demanding kisses. Want curls inside his chest, and it only grows as Stark quickly recovers, his hands flying to Tony’s ass and pulling him against his – God, Steve can barely catch a glimpse, but even then the tent in the front of Stark’s pants is enough to make his mouth water.
A slower song starts playing, and he risks a glance at the dance floor. Sam and Bucky are dancing – they seem oblivious to everyone else around them, whispering to each other what Steve is pretty sure must be snarky comments. There’s nothing snarky about their smiles, though, and Steve’s own mouth curls a little.
“The Captain of the Howling Commandos,” Jarvis announces, as the door opens and a man steps inside. “Former Captain of Pierce’s guard, Sir Steven Rogers.”
Steve just stared at him as if nothing Tony was saying made sense, and his eyes looked very blue and bright and Tony had to look away, snorting.
“I--” Tony starts, but he’s never good at talking when Steve is looking at him like that. He might not even be good at breathing, then. “I--Thank you?”
Tony’s annoyance deflated a little at the look on Steve’s face. “Well, okay, then.” Tony fought to not let that annoyance be replaced by other troublesome feelings, like the warmth that was prickling up his neck at the words
The thought is cruel but tempting, an explanation that doesn’t makes Tony feel like a hurricane is inside his head, and the only thing that stops him from believing it is the memory of Barnes in the gym, Barnes and Steve talking like the best friends they are. Tony is pretty sure no fantasy of his would ever include Barnes in any way.
“So did I.” Tony finger-guns in his direction. His movements are just the slightest bit slower, but it’s a glaring difference from his usual precise franticness. Steve hates it. “But I thought—I mean, it seemed like a good idea.” At Steve’s gaze, he adds: “Oh, come on, Cap. It’s a funeral. Let me assure you: people drink at those.”
“I’m sorry this is so late,” Steve whispers when they pull apart to breathe, but Tony hurries to stop him, pressing a peck to those gorgeous lips.
“Steve, darling?” he asked, and for a moment he sounded so hesitant Steve couldn’t help but frown. He had never seen Stark seem hesitant about anything. “Please don’t take this the wrong way, but… Would you like to sleep in bed with me?”
“Yeah,” Tony agrees, nodding slight, and now his voice carries none of the casual friendly from before. It’s hushed, almost a whisper, and it grows an octave lower when he tilts his head. “Maybe we could go there?”
Now they’re on the same couch, bodies lax and full of carbs, and sitting pretty close to each other already, although Tony does take advantage of any opportunity to slip a little closer. They’re watching as Steve scrolls through a series of images on his phone, all historical pictures or paintings with a photoshopped, photobombing squirrel.
Steve bit his lower lip, relief and comfort washing over him, but there was still one last, gnawing anxiety that he couldn’t ignore.
The door of the throne room always makes a sound when it opens. It’s unnecessarily big and impossible to ignore, designed to make whoever enters through it seem as important as possible.
“You have me,” Tony says, hands tightening on Steve’s wrists, pulling them away. He fights dirty, because the second Steve starts to protest, Tony’s mouth is at his neck, and what comes out is a gasping noise instead. “That’s not in question. What I want to know--” he shifts on the bed, pulling Steve closer by his waist. His hand climbs up Steve’s side and finds one of his pecs, fingers circling around a hard nipple. “--Is
“Also,” Steve hears himself saying, though he isn’t sure of what words are really coming out of his mouth, distracted by the smile that was once his and that Tony now directs to the floor. “If you hand a man a drink, usually, it’s a little impolite to not have a toast.”
It’s a testament of how much of Tony’s life was spent in front of cameras that he’s able to school his features into something that doesn’t transmit the inner turmoil in his chest to his face.
But Steve knew. He knew what he saw, what he heard. He shouldn’t have been having this dream, not anymore, but he did, and he had woken up in a jolt, trembling, desperate to get away, to
at Steve anymore (except when he was, but those moments were getting rarer as time went by, almost worryingly so). It had just… slipped, somehow, and shit – maybe there, in the darkness of the room, Tony could admit that it had slipped because he
“No, really. What if he got into this because he was too polite to turn me down, and now he doesn’t know what to do? Or, what if he changed his mind?”
“You can’t sleep on the floor, darling,” Stark argued. The nickname, as always, fueled fire in Steve’s chest, and he wanted to run away and also to fight Stark at the same time. “Come on. I owe you.”
The compound is empty, it seems, but there’s signs of a lived in space – a loaded dish washer, a wrinkly blanket on the couch, misplaced books and tablets. If he’s honest, it doesn’t seem that different from what he saw the few times he visited, when it was inhabited.
As he waited for Steve to open the door, he made plans. From his mental calculations, they had to take about twenty steps to the elevator and then another twenty to get to the restaurant where breakfast was being served (food was available at all times, as different species had different routines, but it was expected that, as Earth’s representatives, they adhered to a regular human schedule). Counting with the elevator, that was, what – four minutes of awkward silence? Tony could live with that. He really could.
They scramble to get their things ready in time to go meet all the guests who are going in the returning pods (the Asgardians, Thor has told them, can party for weeks in a row, so the ship is going to take a while to return). They barely speak, too busy picking up the pieces of clothing they left scattered around the room.
So Tony was just trying to relieve the tension. Steve would disagree, because of course he would, but at the end of the day, it was the truth. And—look, Steve might never get it, might think it’s the most annoying thing in the world, but Tony just had to handle things with quips, that was just how he was wired. Joke after joke after joke followed by the occasional genuinely mean snide comment, that was just how he survived life’s struggles. And Steve Rogers back on his team, talking to him, looking at him – that was maybe one of the greatest struggles Tony ever faced, Mad Titan included.
He clenches his jaw. There’s no sheet over him, and he feels incredibly exposed, naked on the bed. He’s still watching Tony, who remains unaware that Steve'’s awoken. His mind races through the night’s memories, and embarrassment builds up inside him. Tony had thought he hadn’t been with anyone before – he definitely noticed Steve’s clumsiness and his lack of technique. He'd probably expected something more, maybe was interested in testing Steve’s enhanced abilities in bed, and then all Steve had done was… lay there. Christ - he nearly came before Tony even took off his pants. He hadn’t even been able to undo Tony’s
him, touching and kissing and holding him, Steve grabbing his hand under the table, Steve stroking his hair off his forehead in the morning… The images are impossible to avoid, and Tony wants that so much, it’s suffocating. Before, he could keep these thoughts at bay, but now, his overwhelming desire overshadows his fear, and he thinks, Rhodey is right. It’s time to be honest.
“We’re still working on it,” Bruce replied, and Steve held back a frustrated sigh. “But we think we’ve figured out the ray’s mechanism already – so it’s really a matter of when, and not if.”
Tony presses a deep, sucking kiss on his neck, and Steve lets out a noise he didn’t know he was capable of making. He’s sweating, his body trembling.
Next to the pictures, there’s a pair of reading glasses Tony recognizes as his, a tablet, a pen, and a newspaper wrapped with the crosswords half-done. Tony has never done the crosswords in his life.
The silence that followed was deafening. It would be possible to hear a pin drop, except for the fact that Tony wouldn’t have heard if a meteor came crashing down the ceiling, because he was too busy staring at Steve with his mouth half-open, his eyes strangely hot, blood roaring loudly in his ears.
“Well.” Stark scratched his goatee. “How do I explain it?” His voice sounded casual, but hesitant. Steve got the feeling that Stark was very pleased by how well he had been taking everything so far, and whatever was going to be said next needed to be done delicately in order to keep things running smoothly. “Okay, first things first—fate is a lie,” he said bluntly. “The people upstairs – they can’t control what goes on down here, not really. But they can… well,
Tony stood up. Like an idiot, he just stood up and stayed there, next to the bed in the dark, turned towards the vaguely square-shaped shadow of the back of the couch. He couldn’t see Steve – not even his shadow, his broad and large shadow that Tony had the aching feeling would be all curled up on itself now – but he could hear him.
remind Sam and Bucky that neither of them lived there, technically, but since they weren’t even a hallway away and both had keys, he figured it wouldn’t really be fair. “He’s the last one,” he said instead. “Definitely.”
He loves Tony’s wrinkles, loves kissing them with special care and attention, because he knows Tony’s embarrassed of them. He loves the tinge of grey in Tony’s hair, loves running his hands though the fine silver locks.
“Don’t look so worried,” Tony says, as Rhodey starts plugging the electrodes on his neck. “Or I’m going to start thinking you don’t trust my genius.”
him, for the first time in so long, that knocks the air right out of Tony’s lungs. He feels his eyes burning, and he blinks quickly to hide it, and for one second he thinks:
To Steve’s surprise, it wasn’t a camera roll. Instead, it was a browser with a gossip website open, showing a very clear picture of the man in a different fancy suit, holding the little Pomeranian under his arm as he was exiting a building. The headline screamed
“Oh,” Tony echoes. Then, because he can never just accept a good thing, and his powerful brain has turned to a mush of warmth and sparks and blue eyes, he says: “That’s--that’s nice. I’m… a little curious, though. How could you not know we were dating?”
It was the honesty in his tone that threw Steve off. There was no trace of the occasional flirty demeanor Stark could show at times. Instead, he seemed sincerely worried, and Steve didn’t know what to say. He was not used to having people worry about him. Maybe he should have rejected that – fight against seeming so weak Stark apparently didn’t think he’d manage to sleep alone – but he felt disarmed, caught off-guard by Stark’s kindness.
“It does,” Steve agreed immediately. He angled his head a little, leaning further until their foreheads were touching. “I have this problem where I talk a lot.”
“No,” Steve says, quickly. “No, definitely not. I didn’t go out much. Besides, even if I did, no fella would have looked at me twice.”
“Come for me, gorgeous,” Tony says, eyes a deep dark as he stares down at Steve, his hair sticking to his forehead. His hand finds Steve’s cock, closes his fist around it and starts moving up and down, slicking him up with pre-come. “Come for me—you’re so beautiful, God, I need to see you when you—”
Steve blinks, a little astonished at how casual he’s being, but he manages to give a shrug with a tentative smile. “No better place to be than at the snack table.”
Steve shudders, his own breath lacking, and suddenly he’s the one crying, shaking with hard, painful sobs. Tony, confused, holds him, whispers questions and reassurances,
“Definitely,” he agrees. “But we made a deal, Cap, remember? You meet the orphanage, and I’ll meet the shelter. Ball’s in your court now.”
Tony jumps, unable to mask his immediate, visceral reaction of horror. The only moments he’s seen this man in the past two years were in nightmares that ended up with him waking up sweating cold, the sound of his mother’s last breath echoing in his ears.
too bad to break this to him slowly. He thinks he might just ruin the whole plan by breaking down right there.
“Oh, honey, that’s perfect,” Tony purrs in his ear, and Steve shivers, his insecurity melting away at the tenderness in his words, being replaced by sheer arousal when Tony’s hands go lower, grabbing his rear. “I was hoping you’d say that,” he whispers, and Steve can feel Tony's grin against his neck, but he has no time to reply, because, in the next second, Tony’s hands are massaging his ass, squeezing tightly in a rhythm that makes Steve whimper.
Steve. They wanted to know how he was doing – was he still working at Fury’s? – and they hoped he was doing well.
(Steve. Steve was his problem, as always. One of the biggest curses of being a genius was that Tony couldn’t stop himself from knowing that.)
“I don’t have a pet!” Stark all but yelled. His hand reached forward and grabbed Steve’s wrist, as if preemptively stopping him from running away. “It’s me, okay?”
Tony ran a hand over his face. The spell would be over by the end of the day, Thor assured them. Steve would be back to his usual annoying, infuriating, perfect self in a couple of hours. Right now, though, he was a puppy, and, apparently, one who had picked Tony to look after him, for unknown reasons.
“No reason,” Tony hurries to reply. He settles more onto Steve’s embrace, telling himself the bullshit lie that he’s only doing it to reassure him, and not because the contact makes his body more relaxed and comfortable than he has felt in months. “Just, I don’t know. I think too much.”
His voice is silky, dripping with honey and promises, but the interrogation at the end still poses a clear question, a way out for Steve if he needs one.
After that, Tony sent him other pictures. He didn’t always send things he found online – sometimes he sent pictures of modifications he was making to the nanites, or of a member of the board piking his nose, or even, on one occasion, of a very appetizing plate of pasta.
Tony, by contrast, takes a little longer to start feeling his eyes getting heavy. He kills time by enjoying the contact of Steve’s body, the sound of his breath. He grazes his fingers over Steve’s bicep, up and down until his movements start spelling out letters and words he was afraid to say before.
He’s just grabbed what looks like a salmon roll but smells a lot more delicious when a voice says behind him: “Glad to see you’ve found your designated spot.”
It’s this image, of both of them on the dance floor, that breaks the illusion, because Steve knows better than anyone that, in real life, he’d be stiff and uncomfortable in this scenario, and even Tony’s natural ability would be hindered by his awkwardness. His musical repertoire is badly outdated, too, his mission of catching up with contemporary music long abandoned as he dedicated himself to work - he wouldn’t even know the songs Tony would want to dance to. And he knows very well he’d never be able to keep with Tony’s smooth steps, that he’d freeze at the first whisper of Tony’s low, warm voice and make him regret asking.
to be looking over Tony’s shoulder, even if that seems less and less likely as those blue eyes never snap away from him as Steve comes closer and closer and—
Tony has a very detailed, well thought-out plan in his mind when he goes to meet Steve in the living room. It’s a step by step plan of how their conversation will go, and it’s a remarkable show of emotional openness and maturity, almost a masterpiece of communication.
Steve turned his back to him. Tony’s chest tightened. No matter how many times this happened, he would never get used to it.
wants to do a remarkably long list of things to that ass shouldn’t change the fact that he also wants to make Steve laugh, to listen to his thoughts on 21st century tech, and to hold his hand when they’re walking down the street to get hotdogs. He’s pretty sure those things are not supposed to be incompatible. And he thinks Steve must know this, too.
Steve hums pleasantly and then asks Tony if he’s seen the world’s fastest skateboarding bulldog yet.
Of course, he was completely wrong. The dinner would just be another opportunity for them to fail at seeming like a happy couple, which could have disastrous consequences. It was hard to see all those gold, holier-than-thou pricks as a threat, but Tony had taken a look at their battle ships when they were touring the place, and it was good stuff. Underestimating them would be a mistake.
Though blonde and peculiarly blue-eyed, Steve looked like any other adorable, stubborn Corgi throwing a fit against his owner in the middle of a walk. Only Tony was aware of the dog’s true identity.
“In the kitchen?” Steve asks, and Tony can’t detect what his tone means. “When Ms. Potts called you?”
“Right,” he says, quickly. “Right, yes, definitely. Me and Nat.” He takes his hands to his pockets, and Steve instantly misses the tapping sound. “Giving quite the show, yeah, I think—I’d say that’s accurate. That’s, hm,” he rocks on the same spot, and Steve feels a frantic energy coming from him, though he doesn’t have the faintest idea why. “That’s a thing people do at weddings, right?”
how you choose to—Well, fuck you, Steve Rogers,” he says it through the most beautiful smile in world. “Can I kiss you?”
Steve nodded frantically, and in a second they were both in the elevator. As the doors closed, Tony let out a breath, momentarily relieved until he realized they were alone and therefore there was no reason for him to keep holding Steve’s arm.
“Oh, yeah. Yeah, it’s done,” Tony says. Then, excited for the opportunity, he adds: “It’s just some minor upgrades, nothing huge.”
“What if you turned around?” Stark whispered. Steve’s eyes widened. For a second he thought Stark would… But no – of course he wouldn’t, and Steve shouldn’t even think about that, because he’d push Stark away if he came any closer, wouldn’t he? And yet…
Stark walked inside as if he owned the place, throwing himself at Steve’s couch with an exhausted sigh. “Much better,” he said, propping his legs up on Steve’s coffee table.
it. Tony, at least, doesn’t – all he needs is Steve, one more time. Steve, alive, in his arms. Just one more time.
For a moment, Barnes just stares at him in silence. Then, he throws his head back, making a muffled noise, and Tony can only watch as he fights to swallow the cereal in the midst of a fit of laughter.
Tony, much more awake, shifts his body so he can lay his arm over Steve’s waist and pull him closer. Steve complies immediately, all soft and dazed, and Tony presses a kiss on his cheek, his hand going to the back of Steve’s neck.
Steve blinks, taking in the man standing in front of their door. His skin still prickles where Tony had been touching him until the door burst open and Tony jumped back, thinking they were being surprised by Clint making a stupid joke or Vision being inappropriate or—well, anything else, really.
The workshop is a bit outdated, he notices. Which makes sense, he supposes – Steve hasn’t seen the place in two years, so his memories couldn’t build an accurate copy. Tony sees the lack of a coffee stain on the couch, an old design on the panels displayed in front of him. Even the chair he’s sitting on, he notices, is one he threw away in favor of a model more forgiving on his back.
“Yeah.” Tony wasn’t sure why, but his instincts were not going great, and he didn’t like the idea of Ayesha bringing the focus to Steve. Tony could feel the clenching muscles of Steve’s hand under his, and he ran his thumb over his knuckles without thinking, trying to provide some security he couldn’t actually give. “He’s an old man.”
, Steve feels as if it would be an insult to ask Tony if he’s sure. He tilts his head upwards, towards Steve, and comes closer, his eyes growing bigger every second, his nose brushing Steve’s just slightly before he angles his face a little to the left. The press of his mouth is as light as a feather, a small touch that could easily be brushed away.
(Tony’s nightmares had proven to him, though, that he would never have been able to kill Steve. Barnes, sure – he could’ve taken him out on that uncontrollable anger, even if he would have regretted it later. But Steve? Even the thought makes Tony wake up sweating cold and shaking, unable to go back to sleep.)
He’s unprepared by how Steve stares straight at him. “Maybe,” he says, and his mouth curls into something that, if Tony didn’t know better, he’d call
“Uh,” Tony says, a tinge of embarrassment in his voice, along with… Is it nerves? It’s strange, the idea that he can make Tony nervous. “Maybe I should…”
, Tony’s brain added, and he snorted, half amused with himself, half exasperated that’s where life led him to.
They dance. It’s comforting, the warmth of Peggy’s body next to his. Steve loves her, then – loves her in the same easy, simple way he loved before going in the ice; in the same way he loved when he fetched water for her seventy years later because she started coughing. Steve loves her with the love that filled him with the determination and strength on the many times where he felt as if he had none. Steve loves her with the same love that let him carry her casket.
It would be quite the funny story, Tony imagined. That one time Steve accidentally spilled the beans and ruined a mission because he was too distracted staring at Tony and saying a bunch of nonsense for no reason. Hilarious.
“Hey,” he called, going after him. Steve was clearly still reeling from his speech, because Tony was able to catch his wrist, stop him. “What are you doing?”
what it looks like, but I promise I don’t have a shrine of you in my closet, okay?” Steve widened his eyes at him, but he continued, speaking rapidly: “I—fine, I was following you. But not in like, a creepy way or anything.”
Steve took a sharp breath. Tony’s heart jumped in response, and he tensed, suddenly worried about his courage leaving when he needed it the most.
Tony stops right in front of the bar. The bartender is a young woman, clearly flustered by his appearance, cheeks darkening when he grins in her direction. “One sparkling water,” he says, winking at her. Then his hand goes from Steve’s bicep to his forearm, and he gives him a light squeeze, turning towards him. “What about you?”
“How come you don’t know any of these things?” Steve asks with a raised eyebrow. “You work with tech.”
“Yeah,” Tony interrupts, because he doesn’t want Steve to be sorry, now. He just wants him to be there. “I’m sorry, too, but.”
Steve rested his back against the door. His body was shaking, and his knees bent against his will – so frail now, so broken -, making him slip to the ground. He shut his eyes forcefully, inhaling sharply even as he felt no air reaching his lungs.
“Yeah?” He manages, his breath uneven, blood roaring on his ears. Tony is so close now – leaning towards him, looking at Steve through long lashes, big hand still settled comfortably on Steve’s arm, as if it belongs there. Closer than he’s ever been.
Tony’s chest expands as he breathes, and Steve wonders how long he has been in love with him. How long has he been looking the other way, pretending not to see what was obvious, so glaring it’s almost obscene.
Steve stares at him. Then he blinks, and his mouth falls open, then closes and opens again, like he’s the world’s stupidest, most oblivious, cutest fish. “Oh.”
Around them, Thor and Tony both seem to be regretting their choices as well. Steve doesn’t blame them – it was, to say the least, a surprise when Quill had sent them a video message asking to be his groomsmen. It was a larger surprise when he said he needed them to do it because, when asked, all the Guardians had chosen to be Gamora’s bridesmaids.
“Shut up,” Tony says, in a hurry. Steve’s eyes dart back towards him. “Shut the hell up right now and listen to me. I love you. You—you love me.” Saying it sends a wave of warmth through his chest, and Tony swallows a sob and grins through tears. He rests his forehead against Steve’s, feels his breath on his. “Holy shit, you love me so much, it’s ridiculous.”
“What would we do?” he finally forced himself to ask, keeping his eyes shut as an extra, though illusory, protection. He didn’t want to see the expression in Tony’s face. “If I… stayed like this?”
“I was trying to learn how to use, hmm—Twitter, right?” He pronounces it correctly, which really shouldn’t make Tony want to kiss him in congratulations, but it absolutely does. “And I found this, this page…” His face twists in an effort not to laugh. “You’re not gonna believe it. Here, I’ll show you. You guys need to see this.” He holds up the phone a little higher for Tony and Bruce to see.
Steve frowns. Sometimes Tony does this thing where he’s twisted a thought in his mind so many times he seems to believe Steve can read it, and so when he talks, it’s as if he thinks there’s already a conversation happening.
laugh out of Steve. He grins wide and hard, their noses touching. “Oh, yeah.” He takes a breath before continuing. “This life you made up, this life you think you can’t have—you’re gonna wake up and we’re gonna make it happen, both of us, together.”
“Because… because I need to know,” Tony pleads, his tone confused. “I—I can never please you. And yet… You’re giving me this.” He looks younger than ever, as he stands there, in his sleeping attire, wide-eyed and disarmed. Even then, he attempts to build some armor, crossing his arms. “You don’t care about what I want. So, why?”
Steve took a moment to reflect. That was… a lot to take in, but, every time he felt himself feeling skeptical, he remembered the dog – Dummy, apparently – floating. “And you said you can’t do it on command?”
Tony blinked rapidly, still trying to get used to the new reality of not-kissing-Steve, and looked to see the two Sovereign citizens staring at them, standing in front of the elevator with scandalized expressions.
, so Steve pushes back again, wanting to sink onto Stark’s hand. Stark grabs his hips, though, and Steve doesn’t need to look to know he’s smiling.
“It is,” he says. Tony’s grin widens, his laugh lines showing, and Steve has a strong urge to touch them somehow. He grips the table behind him instead, not sure of what to say to keep the conversation going. “Can I, uh,” he stutters as Tony lifts his gaze at him. “Can I see your notes?”
“Sounds good,” Tony agrees. He knows he can’t avoid Steve forever, especially not in his dream world. And he’s done enough recon work by now – it’s time to start laying the groundwork for what he actually came here to do.
“We all have our habits,” he says solemnly, though a grin plays on his lips. Steve doesn’t want to smile back because Tony can’t just be late for something as important as a wedding like that, but it’s hard to not reciprocate. “Mine is bypassing my alarm clock each morning and sleeping until the bride is five steps away from the front door.”
Everything changed when Pierce’s men were defeated. Suddenly, the tables had turned, and any lord worth his land was scraping for leverage to negotiate with the rebels.
phone rings, sound breaking through the short distance between his and Steve’s faces, completely shattering the moment that was basically given to Tony on a silver platter.
He looks around, taking in the details. He’s gotta hand it to the Stone Industries – it doesn’t feel like a fantasy in the slightest. In fact, it feels like he’s just woken up, and whatever he saw before was the dream.
