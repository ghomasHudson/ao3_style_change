"Sherlock can't talk.  Anymore," John explained.  "Something happened while he was away and..."
John watched him for a while. He wasn't really tired, but didn't want to leave. Once he was sure Sherlock was asleep, he allowed his own eyes to close.
And John didn't know what to say.
“Did you come out here to look at the stars?” Dennison asked.
The violin lessons were nice.  Sherlock had Mycroft send over the size ¼ violin he'd used at that age for him to practice with.  He liked teaching him, even if Dennison wasn't exactly a natural.  He was still getting the hang of reading music to begin with, and occasionally became frustrated with himself, but he was stubborn and Sherlock was just as much so.
'What do you want?' he signed.
Sherlock just looked at him, stared at him, until John’s eyes widened a bit.
That was something they hadn't discussed.  Mary had only met him that once, and John didn't normally talk about him to his girlfriends.
John pulled away and put on as normal a face as he could conjure. “Let’s go check on Dennison.” He made his way back inside, expecting Sherlock to follow. He did.
'What do you want to do?'
When they got down to breakfast, he set Dennison down and took a seat at the table, only to have him climb into his lap anyway.
They were halfway through their meals when Dr. Parson arrived.  He sat at his normal spot at the other end of the table with his usual professional smile on his face.
Once his eyes adjusted a bit to the darkness, he sat next to Sherlock, offering him a pillow.  Sherlock accepted it with caution, placing it behind his head.  The other pillow was put next to his and the blanket thrown over him as John laid down beside him.
‘No,’ Sherlock signed.  ‘Everyone has decided to leave it up to you.’
“I was talking to Sherlock.”  Sherlock glared at him, and John laughed. “Get your coats. We’ll get a snack while we’re out.”
'Goodnight, Sherlock. I'll see you in the morning.'
“You're leaving?” Dennison asked, looking like he might cry again.
Dennison watched with wide eyes as John pulled him close and tried to bring him out of wherever his head had taken him.  “Sherlock,” he said again, “Come on, come back to us.”
Sherlock moved his eyes from the files to her face and gave a small nod (and attempted a smile) to greet her.
'I didn't break a mirror,' Sherlock signed, but wondered where he would go from there. He was upset that Parson lied to Dennison, especially since they hadn't discussed it at all, but he did know why he did it. It was logical, even if he did think it was wrong. What child needs to know such gruesome things? But, Sherlock was learning, lies could be just as bad. 'It wasn't an accident.'
He waited up for hours; he wanted to be awake when Sherlock came home so he could check him over himself.  Not that he doubted Dr. Parson's abilities, but he doubted he'd get anywhere with Sherlock.
Sherlock shook his head.
Around midnight he remembered he'd planned on chatting with John again that night.  He thought about going to get his computer, but didn't want to leave and have Dennison wake in his absence, not after he'd told him he could trust him.
“If you're sure.”
He waited a few minutes.  He didn't know how he expected Sherlock to reply, but he didn't expect him to simply
"It was, I used to go with him on some of his cases.  Most of them, really, after we started living together.  It was amazing."
"I know," she smiled.  "I thought we could have a night in."
'Getting tired?' John asked, glancing at his clock. It was long past when Sherlock would normally be asleep.
The pills Sherlock took to help him sleep were good at getting him through the initial stages. Though he was usually good enough at that himself, able to put himself to sleep as easily as flipping a light switch.
"Give me your arm," John requested.  Sherlock just stared at him, obviously trying to figure out the nature of this visit.  "Give."
“Did Dr. Parson do something bad?”
John arrived at the airport three hours early. Just in case.
“Okay.  Can I read in your room with you?”
"Tell me why."
But before he started unpacking his things, he thought he should go see the man of the house.
Sherlock was awake and sitting up when they arrived.
Sherlock grasped John’s coat, feeling the squish of the mud against the fabric.
'I already said why.  You came back.  And you're my friend, and I know why you left.  And now, I have to trust that you'll make better decisions in the future, that you've learned from your mistakes.  What kind of friend would I be if I just gave up on you?'
Sherlock couldn't help but smile at that.  He hoped it looked happier than it felt, though.
'What did you eat today?' John asked, typical of how he liked to start their nightly conversations.
'Sherlock Holmes. Answer me.'
“Maybe it takes some time?” John said, but the resulting look on Sherlock’s face told him his hope was most likely in vain.
It wasn’t as if Sherlock wasn’t aware of the irony, but, as he was feigning as if he didn’t recall John taking his cock down the back of his throat, he just continued to wait for elaboration.
He didn’t wait for John’s reaction, though it was obvious when John didn’t stop him from stomping down the stairs that he didn’t feel compelled to continue their conversation.
“I can’t possibly keep that down,” Sherlock informed, peeking from under his pillow.
"Son of a bitch!" John exclaimed as a bullet grazed his side, throwing him down to one knee. At the same time, Mary went down in a tangle of limbs, flopping on the floor as Mrs. Hudson continued to zap her.
Sherlock's eyes flashed open, he gasped, and then promptly spent all over the eight hundred quid suit. John had never been so proud.
“Sorry,” Sherlock whispered quietly.
John walked no further than the first few steps into the sitting room, looking from the sofa to the chairs in front of the fireplace, to the mantle.
No matter. It was the most boring, predictable date of all time, there was no question John would be home within the hour. Sherlock would wait up, perhaps find a movie to watch. They could make popcorn and Sherlock would deduce which actors were having affairs. John had shown a strange fascination with that particular ability. Most likely it had to do with John’s own lack of ability to sense chemistry in others.
She glances over at Bea. The girl smiles back, trying to convey support for whatever it is that's got her friend so upset. "Yeah, maybe." She sounds more hopeful now.
Say hello to Victor, Molly, and Irene in this chapter. As per usual I use them simply to drive John up the fucking wall. Hope you enjoy.
"I like this" Sherlock said, afterwards. And it was the same tone of voice he'd have used to declare the results of an experiment.
"Well, ah. There're some people from the media who want to talk to you." he shifted uncomfortably again "You know, hero of the hour and all that."
John was starting to feel his nose prickle in that tell-tale sign that his eyes were going to start watering, so he blinked rapidly.
They got home from solving the Mystery of the Mirrored Murder and they were both laughing and flush-faced. It was wonderful to see Sherlock looking so- carefree again. John couldn't help but grab the detective by the lapels of his Belstaff and bring him in for an enthusiastic kiss.
"Now I know what to do to slow down this big brain of yours" he added smugly.
"Assumptions?" Sherlock interrupted, automatically.
"Homicide, multiple suspects, most likely a group effort" he rattled off. He knew the easiest way to lie was to tell the truth while omitting facts.
And so he said nothing. For as long as he didn't put the cards up on the table, he didn't have to deal with the consequences and he could imagine whatever outcome he wanted. Although, to be honest, he didn't even know what outcome he wanted anymore.
"Sherlock?" John prodded, looking over his shoulders as if to check that no one was paying them any mind.
"John, I'm not- I'm not broken" he said eventually, and his voice was almost diplomatic.
It was a strangely pleasant sensation, feeling the inside of John's warm mouth. And he realized with a pang of both relief and regret that at least they hadn't taken
She stopped when she arrived at a picture that had obviously been taken at Christmas, and by a third party. The two men were dressed in absurd sweaters and were sharing a chaste kiss, the barest hint of a mistletoe peeking from the top of the frame.
"Why do you think, John?"
They stayed in companionable silence for a couple of minutes until Sherlock looked up and put his hands on the laptop with a tired expression. "You know what I really would like, John?"
What they had between them was still in its infancy, but more importantly, the nature of Sherlock's trauma made everything that much more fragile. There was something intensely intimate about sharing a bed with someone else.
Lestrade looked from one to the other, feeling the tension between them. Then he shook his head "He ran when we heard the bullets."
"You're having a panic attack, you're not going to die." She told him very clearly, and then gestured to her own chest, before she breathed in slowly "You're going to breathe with me, ok? We're going to count together." And she stood there with him until he calmed down after twenty three long inhales-and-exhales.
, he thought as he put the first forkful into his mouth, he loved John's cooking.
Sherlock almost, almost lifted his hand to grab the envelope, but thankfully stopped himself in time. "Just put it over there, Graham. What is it, you people forgot how to tie your shoes again?"
"Great, fucking great!" John bit out to no one as he kicked the chair near him.
"That's not-"
He was smart; he was smarter than all of them put together. And he managed to escape his cell enough to send the message, but there was only so much his brain could do against the inescapable reality of four solid walls.
After that first case, Sherlock seemed to stand taller and prouder. His successful attempts at being a detective coupled with his successful attempt at a sexual encounter left him full of confidence.
As he climbed down the stairs to the basemen two at a time, he couldn't believe he hadn't realized it before. The house had wood flooring all throughout, and it all made the same hollow sound because of the basement. But the basement wasn't big enough. It wouldn't be possible for him to walk up and down the main corridor, all the while hearing the sound travelling the exact same way if there wasn't an equally large space underneath.
"I- I- what-" he spluttered, caught completely off guard. "I didn't think you- You want-"
It did not, however, stop the infections that were slowly taking over his entire body. His arse had been abused to the point of never healing back, his hands were swollen and red and he couldn't feel his fingers all that well anymore. His feet were dirty and there were pockets of pus in some of the cavities of his missing nails. He was running a fever that left him delusional and sweating well into the night.
Sherlock rattled off the address, and explained the exact room they were in; if they were going to have to wait for an entirely different crew to arrive and retrieve them, might as well give them the correct directions.
"Honestly, John, it's not like I don't know it's there" he said matter-of-factly in his best everybody-is-an-idiot voice. He'd felt it before during their make out sessions and, granted, he had never pressed against it so clearly like he had just done, but still.
"John, I want to get married." Sherlock said, completely out of the blue.
. That.
And then the screams began.
"Ok. Ok, fine." He said, something like compromise making him deflate the slightest bit. "I am not- I'm not trying to undermine your deductions. But a case like this- Sherlock, you aren't a machine." He told his lover firmly, holding his gaze unblinkingly for a good few seconds. "And the way it's going… can you blame me for being worried?"
He looked at his phone hoping there had been some gruesome murder in the upper ranks that needed to be
"Ok." He said, like he had just accepted a mission.
John couldn't help his amused smile; some things never changed.
"I'm going to fix up dinner. Will you eat something?"
The detective thought about hiding the pictures back into the folder, but John had already seen he'd been holding something and he was coming over to see what it was.
Finally, Sherlock pulled back enough so they could stare each other in the eyes again and he spoke in an almost whisper "I want to be inside you."
And the reservation in Sherlock's voice only confirmed how right Mycroft had been.
"Oh?" his tone sounded just as ambiguous as his expression.
"Well- I mean, the- why are you saying these men aren't rapists? I thought we have already established-"
John's entire demeanor changed as he registered the words, and he promptly placed himself between his partner and the rest of the room.
The low, throaty growl that he extracted from his lover was delicious. He couldn't help but grin against his frustrated detective.
The wool coat fell behind him and he stepped to the side before kicking it across the floor towards her.
Once past its initial stage, their relationship slotted into place like it had always been there. They moved in sync with each other like a dance they had rehearsed and everything simply fit.
"Do you want me to touch you?" he asked softly, trying to refer back to his previous strategy of getting the detective out of his own head.
John had no idea why he was brilliant this time, but he stood up anyway and looked over his lover's shoulder to the screen.
There was a lot of rapid Serbian being spoken and he could only catch certain key words here and there, but he could tell they were terribly pleased with themselves.
But then Lestrade was clearing his throat and looking around a bit before turning his gaze back to them. "Actually, there's someone else who'd like to see you."
"Do you see! These are all consistent with underground facilities, and I knew it had to be industrial storage- it's clearly not a basement. I showed you these marks before, the light had to swing on the ceiling, that's why the wire is falling out in this exact pattern. But we have those windows on top and they don't lead to the outside- it's concrete and-"
The subsequent silence and Greg's taken aback expression left no doubt that both of them had seen it.
"Can't have that" John smiled, shaking his head again. "Sherlock Holmes, with the mind that's like an engine, a train racing out of control, trapped on the launch pad!" he teased, echoing the words his lover had said on many occasions.
"We have another stream from yesterday." He said as the thing came to life. "Anything, ok? Write down anything you can think of." He placed a pad of paper and a pen by Sherlock's right hand and then proceeded to stare at said right hand profusely before Sherlock turned to glare at him.
Sherlock actually looked up from what he was doing to look at the intruder. But when he looked down again, it was clear he was addressing Lestrade. "You're not going to find them in the database. They're not registered sex offenders."
"You can read my mind, now?"
Things started to blur and he started forgetting; he knew he had been waiting- for someone? Something? But it was all foggy and unclear. He would wake up naked and cold and he couldn't remember how he had gotten there or where he was.
"Still want to go after them, boss?" the Sargent quipped, and she looked smug.
"John-" Sherlock started, but the doctor wasn't having it.
"Stay back!!!" she shouted, tears streaming down her face. She was trembling and sobbing, even though she was the armed one.
"I think I'm good at it." He said, seemingly out of the blue. But both of them knew exactly what he was talking about, and it was the most conflicting statement John had ever heard.
He twirled around sharply and held out the boots in his hands. "If you'll excuse me, I need a lab." Another one of his punctuation smiles. "Come, John."
Sherlock looked down and saw John's hand moving inside his trousers, but after another moment John finally pulled himself out completely, stroking himself out in the open for him to see.
Sherlock was staring off blankly into the distance, his eyes unfocused as his mind worked rapidly "The owner of the house." He said, eventually "He's a client. He was watching the movies."
He felt his entire body tense up, his hands tightening on the chart, memories flowing into his mind unbidden- Sherlock's voice as he asked him to
An exasperated sigh came from inside and Sherlock said "Fine, John. Just give me a minute."
“Yeah, I probably shouldn’t have touched it, but at the time I didn’t realize anything was wrong yet.”
"What are you on about? Because I don't want to shag up against the wall in a filthy alley with the cops just down the street, some of whom we know personally, that makes me sexually regressed?"
the first time after such a tense conversation.
“What?" Molly replied, concerned.
John bristled. He hated being backed into a corner, but she was right, he’d burst with curiosity if he didn’t know what they were talking about.
He punched his reply as John exited the loo.
John threw his hands up. “See! That’s what I’m talking about. Why does no one ever think of these things?” He was thrilled Sherlock agreed, as he was adamant that this future never come to pass, and it felt good to have that validation.
In a rare moment of clarity, John watched the gun swing up and stop level with his face. In the background he saw Sherlock’s widening eyes, clear in the floodlight from the steel yard; and in the foreground, the barrel of a snub nose .38 Smith & Wesson just centimeters from his front teeth. He acted accordingly.
“Ta!” John clapped when Sherlock finished. He gave an uneven bow and placed his violin back in its case. “See? I knew you could play well.”
”I told him," Greg admitted. “I told Sherlock John was in love with him."
“Would you be pressing charges for the assault?” The officer asked Sherlock, nodding down to John’s injured fist.
They both fell off the sofa and landed hard on the floor.
John shut up as soon as he absorbed the state of the room, not to mention the state of his new flatmate, which was in shambles. Sherlock had apparently crawled up a flight of stairs on a sprained ankle so he could break a lamp, tear the sheets off the bed and throw pillows onto the floor.
going unsaid.
She scrunched her nose in disgust at the goat idea. “No, thank you. If it’s fake it would be a waste of time and if it was real I’d just cry probably.”
He looked the kid over again. He didn’t even look old enough to be in Uni in the first place. His soft curls framed his face like Cabanal’s Fallen Angel, his high cheekbones spoke of posh boarding schools and summers in Bath, his lips…
“Wouldn’t you be?” He questioned back angrily. “I kinda think you owe me, really.”
John sits in the passenger seat in the silence left over and just stares in the side mirror, waiting on… something, anything.
The crook of his arm itched. Instinctively he moved to scratch it but what he ended up doing was smacking his flatmate on top of the head.
“Just don’t break any beating hearts over the non-beating ones,” John teased, as if the idea of Sherlock flirting back didn’t absolutely devastate him.
The first response to call John an idiot again was stamped down. “I walked Regent’s every day for a week. Waiting for you.”
“And you obviously don’t care what I think. What on Earth would lead you to believe I’d want to come back with you after that?”
He looked John over, noting the tension around his eyes, the miles away he’d gone as he stared at the comforter. “Traumatic experience, obviously. Sorry.” Sherlock turned away in regret for making John upset.
"This plan is insane but it's better than nothing," Greg muttered. "All right, I'll take John first, he's gonna be the hardest to convince."
“So friendly, but not close?”
“Go away!”
Laila closed in on him after that, arms wrapped around his neck, and she graciously let him have a nervous breakdown and hitch brokenly into her hair. He wasn’t crying, not exactly. Just…releasing tension.
John is pleased to see Sherlock roll his eyes at this. It's more like him.
get ants from spilled sugar,
“But that could be hours,” he whinged and squeezed John’s biceps in his grip.  “Lestrade will have us giving statements and filling out paperwork until dawn.”
He swallowed several times before he could croak out, "All right. When you're ready." He shouted when Sherlock took him in hand and immediately lined himself up. "Slow! Go slow, Sherlock, seriously."
The man's gaze flickered to John briefly before answering. “Indefinitely, it seems.”
“I still have to call the housing board and let my roommate know,” John was trying to explain but the landlady was having none of it. She went on about the room upstairs, insinuating it’s possible superfluous existence, which turned John’s ears red, and - oh! - the linens downstairs she would bring up and not to worry about that month’s rent, as Mycroft had already taken care of it. All the while Sherlock stared blankly at his mounted rapier over the dresser, plotting how best to commit fratricide with his bum foot as an impediment. Poison a pastry?
“Yes, well, I don’t believe I was in my right frame of mind when I agreed to this little field trip.” His lips snapped the ‘P’ with precision.
, of all the stupid things.
John turned to his salad, if a bit zealously, and found it to be too busy; the flavours fairly smacking him across the face. Who put mint in a salad?
They both cried out; Sherlock near crying and John with loads more military appropriate swearing.
imagine it, Sherlock was the epitome of graceful when he choose to be but that he would
“I could do this all night,” John mused aloud. “I won’t. But I could. Spend the whole night just touching, mapping each dip. Oh, I’d love to just touch and touch you.”
“You’re secretly relieved by your girlfriend cheating. You were waiting on a better excuse than the issues you were already having to break it off. What was it? She pressured you to change majors even though you just started Uni? Yes. You were pre-med. Strange, her not being satisfied with that…  Ah, she wanted a political figure for a husband. Didn’t believe you could pull off being a doctor. Made you switch to poli-sci with her so she could groom you for office. With the added bonus of keeping a closer eye on you so she could pursue her much larger, meatier side project; one of your rugby teammates if I’m not mistaken. Tsk tsk. You’ll be feeling the sting of that for a while. At least if he were smaller you could have cracked his skull, am I right? ”
“You’re English,” John replies stupidly. He blinks at the man’s smirk. When nothing further is forthcoming John fills the awkward silence. “Well, uh, fancy meeting you here.” He smiles, or tries to anyway; something about the moment seems tense, though he can’t fathom what it is, other than being cornered in a loo in the middle of nowhere...
"Right. I can't keep my mouth shut anymore. This wedding is bollocks!"
“We’ll deal with it,” was his only answer. He looked away as Lestrade’s men caught up with them. The armed units got there first and yanked the accomplice to the ground to cuff him. One of them yelled over the whir of the helicopter, questioning what had happened to Petrov, and Sherlock quickly stepped in to explain. John shouldn’t have just stood back, but really, what more could he do? His heart rate tripled when the constable pulled a pair of cuffs and snapped them onto Sherlock’s wrists.
He frowned. “I’m not sure,” he hedged. “Why?”
“All right,” John went on, “maybe he’s being a bit overly… possessive, but you can’t think he’d ever really follow through with… whatever it is that…” He couldn’t even finish the thought before his stomach clenched in pain.
“Yes,” he hissed and closed the distance between them again.
Suddenly, Donovan burst through the front door. "Sir, he escaped. They lost him behind the refinery, somewhere in the ship yard."
“I know what I did. You know what I did. There’s no need to remind me.”
Greg laughed. "You're completely serious." He scrubbed a hand over his short cropped hair and continued to laugh. "Can you imagine?"
"Thank you, dear," Mrs. Hudson said to Molly as they walked away with their prize.
He’s watching himself propitiate with the person he loves most in the world about his marriage to another.
John wasn't sure if he was hinting for John to use his mouth or what but the posh bastard could get bent.
John was so caught up in his confusion he didn’t even ask why the restaurant was wary of Sherlock to begin with.
“Dammit,” he snarled at the computer screen.
God, how he missed those nights sometimes. But in trade, Sherlock had received John’s undivided attention at home, or out on the occasional case. Why hadn’t they been able to maintain that? If Sherlock didn’t know any better, he’d think John was frightened off. Moving in full time warranted a female buffer? Was he really so opposed to growing closer?
John gathered his thoughts as best he could before answering. "I'm doing my very best not to go off like a rocket here, Sherlock. Can we not discuss this now?"
There was a cramp in John's stomach that refused to go away. He shoved his fist against it and took a few steadying breaths. Tears burned behind his eyes but he refused to let them fall. He’d be goddamned.
“Yes, and I was in Dubai. You’ll have to excuse the delay.” He snapped the briefcase open and pulled out a packet of paperwork. “If you wouldn’t mind,” he drawled with a glance at John.
“But-“
“My parents wanted me to go pre-med. I almost did but… I went with Creative Writing.”
His arm came almost all the way back and sent Petrov’s club sailing out of his grasp with a crash. The man looked stunned and quickly put his hands up in surrender but Sherlock didn’t stop there. In a blur, he managed to slip the pipe between the man’s cuffed wrists and then wrench it sideways with both hands. The man cried out as he had no choice but to turn with the motion. His legs were then kicked out, the pipe flipped up, caught at the end, and then brought down sharply across his temple. John stood aghast as the perp fell, forehead bloodied and eerily silent.
Sherlock glanced down with a small chuckle. “Why do you ask?”
Her knowing smile could have rivaled Mrs. Hudson’s. She reached out and patted his hand. “It’s fine, John. I get it. You’re good to go for the night, by the way. I’ll count the drawers.”
Except a second is all Sherlock gives him before he’s throwing a tantrum.
A full three minutes passed in silence. Sherlock marched on.
“Oh. Yeah, of course.” She looked up at John, who hovered behind Sherlock’s shoulder. “Thank you. How did you find me? Tyler said I’d be here until Monday before anyone found me. I tried screaming but no one could hear.”
listen!”
“Hey, I said you could do what you wanted with me, but
John thinks back to his last sexual encounter - a hasty mutual handjob behind the humvees with his CO, more than a year ago now. The last sexual encounter in a real bed, even longer than that. “It’s fine. I’m sure we’ll figure it out.”
Donovan answered the question while Greg started the car. "She gave us enough. They found the van she described just west of his last known location and we canvased the neighborhood but haven't found anything."
John snapped, anger twisting his face and his words. “Stop it. You know perfectly well why. You’ve known all along. You must have done. You’re a bloody genius and I’m just a fool who leaves messes for you to follow. We’re past pretending you haven’t a clue about how I feel.”
Mrs. Hudson was up out of her seat and rushing toward Mary faster than should be possible given her bad hip. It was clear she was talking Mary down from going after them. The blushing bride seemed more apt to flush in anger than innocence at the moment but she backed down to Mrs. Hudson's motherly, rational advice.
“You like that? Me calling you beautiful? Or was it the brilliant part?”
John didn’t respond immediately; instead he picked through the pieces until he could get a grip on the tiny beak. He studied it in the murky streetlight, sadness etched into lines on his face; lines Sherlock had put there.
“The note, the one I left with the skull?” He asked. John nodded. “Where did I say I found the skull?”
Sherlock didn't seem to find the humor in this, if his furrowed brow and down turned lips were any judge.
John’s head floated off toward the window and bounced around on the ceiling for a bit before he caught it and slapped it back down.
Sherlock gave a tight lipped smile and moved into the sitting room.
John grinned and made quick work of his pants and trousers. “Seems to me like I got over that sexual repression, wouldn’t you say?”
When Sherlock ran his thumb under the cuff of John’s jacket the electric pulse across John’s skin said ‘flattered, very flattered.’
“Ah,” John huffed.
Sherlock stopped and stared at John as if he’d spouted cooking tips in Dutch.
“And why not? It’s nearly midnight, no one will be out in this.” Sherlock waved at the window.
John waited until he felt Sherlock begin to swell before he chanced a questing thumb against his perineum, rubbing hard.
Sherlock sneered at the pointless interruption, jamming the mobile back into his pocket in anger.
Twenty-five minutes later John groaned, stretched, and glared at Sherlock with such disdain one would think he’d chained John to the wall first before making him study.
John knows what a viscosity experiment entails. He snaps, "What have you done to the tub now?"
Sherlock looks up when John holds it out to him.
A black-clad woman of a similar age to John, had her blood red nails trailing down Sherlock’s arm. They clearly knew each other, her smile said as much, and his body language didn’t read as uncomfortable. This must be the infamous Molly, keeper of Sherlock’s precious body parts. What the hell was John supposed to do about that? No one would say no to a woman like that, and she was clearly fishing. Since John had no idea if Sherlock even liked women, his hackles were raised. John had no right to step in, but how could he stand by and let that harpy-
Sherlock’s smug face quickly morphed into one of surprise. It always felt good when he could outwit the smartest man he knew.
John glanced up, looking hopeful, a small hesitant grin forming. Why? Sherlock replayed the moment. Oh.
“You- Oh my god,” Miller snaps and grabs John by the back of his neck, shoving until he can pull the pistol from his waistband. He waves it at his partner. “You’re welcome, you fucking idiot. Mother fucker could have blown your head clean off. I told you he took my gun. Did you pat this one down?”
His nails left half-moon impressions in his palm as he strode away from the flat, his mind whirring at near Sherlockian speeds as he planned ahead. There were possibilities available, avenues open to him if he were brave enough, fast enough.
He would only know about that if he’d been watching the CCTV the night before, as Sherlock hadn’t moved from his chair since he’d sat down an hour ago.
Sherlock suppressed a laugh. “Romany is the term you’re looking for, though my family is mostly from Yorkshire and Lorraine.”
The frown turned into an immediate scowl; hands went straight up into the air. “Oh, that was one time!”
So wait he did...
John rubbed at the bridge of his nose, frustrated but somewhat chuffed to have Sherlock’s undivided attention. Sometimes he forgot Sherlock was three years his junior; he was just so much smarter than John and never hesitated to prove it. This was a different side altogether.
John thought it couldn’t hurt. It would cut into his free time but if he failed his requisite classes, he’d never forgive himself. No amount of experimentation was worth his entire future.
“Ignore him,” Sherlock commanded, to no avail apparently.
“I brought condoms, in my coat,” he flailed his hand to indicate the Belstaff laying half on, half off his person. “Right inside pocket. Get one, no clean up.”
John, admittedly, wasn't as angry as he let on.  It was a great relief, it felt like, to not have to hide from Bill at least.
Fine. He felt totally fine. Better than fine in fact.
“Get Sherlock, silly!” She tore the jersey over her head and paraded around the room semi-nude, picking up her previously discarded articles of clothing. It was a testament to her allure that he didn’t immediately scoff at her statement.
He watched, and felt, as John’s hands slid from his wrists, down his arms, to map the contours of his too skinny chest. What John could even find remotely attractive about it Sherlock didn’t know, but that he did was obvious. The way John’s eyes lingered here and there, his tongue making appearances every few seconds, the flush of his skin - the signs were there and Sherlock didn’t mistake them for anything other than sexual attraction.
John narrowed his eyes at the open doorway. He was hip to Sherlock’s tricks now.
Sherlock held up a finger, digging into his trousers for his phone. “Siri. Find opium dens in London.”
A gallic shrug, followed by, "You're the one with the problem, how is that my fault?"
John blew smoke in Sherlock’s face. “Whiskey would have been better.”
“I’ve been in love with you for roughly the last twenty-five hundred days. I say roughly because I’m not sure when it started, but I’m sure that’s not the bit you’re interested in just now. I’ve kept this information to myself, baring what Mycroft has gleaned, or thinks he has, because I didn’t think it would be welcome. Not after… Well, everything. But you wanted to talk, so there it is. Do what you will.”
She slaps his arse on the way out. John stares at his hazy reflection in the mirror and wonders at himself.
“If you’re truly concerned, I wouldn’t pull up the carpets,” Sherlock announces, causing John to groan at the bedspread. “I’m going to study the local hyphae.”
“Wait,” John blinks back to the present, “did you call me an imbecile?”
Time passed in the back of the panda, voices came and went, easily forgotten in favour of drifting on the sea of innocuous purple cough suppressant. Why hadn’t he discovered this option years ago?
Despite the mess, John immediately gave into the desire to hug Sherlock close. Sherlock didn’t seem to mind, he simply pulled John in, wrapped his long arms around John’s shoulders and let John pant hot air into his ear. Sweat mixed everywhere they touched, but neither seemed to mind, which was a nice surprise. John had assumed Sherlock would be weary of that sort of thing, as fastidious as he was about his appearance.
Sherlock frowned down at his own hand but John paid no mind to the awkwardness.
“For the cut,” he explained with a vague hand motion. “Least I could do.”
“Now they think it’s likely you’ll come back for your things, if only to keep them off your trail. I can track them back to their base of operations this way, or force this one,” he nods up at the man at the rest stop, “to take us there.”
Mary turned to Janine and whispered, "Watch the door. Don't let anyone in here or in there with them before I'm done."
John laughed, a gratifying sound. “I meant, fuck. I meant why did you think I wouldn't want all of you? Of course I want to hold hands and solve crimes and be yours. Of course I want that."
“Do you still-" John slammed his lips shut over his tongue.
Greg nodded once. “Right,” he pointed, “get him out of those cuffs.”
He stared at the woven fingers of his fellow travellers and thought,
“Well now what?” John snaps back, sliding backwards on his stomach, as if slinking further towards the bush behind him will actively hide him better.
“Neither can I, that’s why I didn’t go,” Sherlock explained casually, head tilted up at the ceiling.
Yep. That did it.
John and Sherlock looked at each other first. This was a bit different than lying about how they’d gotten into a suspects flat or how he’d gotten the bump on the head. This was covering up details of a murder. Sherlock gave a small nod and John agreed. They looked to Greg and spilled. An hour later, after explaining that everything they’d admitted to at the scene was true, only the seriousness of the accomplices timing was off. The actual murder had been an accident.
John follows behind reluctantly, only vaguely listening. He’s gotten a better look at the man this time, his ridiculous bone structure, his almond-tilted eyes - a shocking shade of blue they had been - just before he’d perched a pair of sunglasses on his aquiline nose. He was so pale, nearly as white as his shirt; English sort of pale, John muses, like a beacon calling out to him, a sign. Christ, John needs to get a grip. The man is a stranger, a traveler, like himself; just because they’ve crossed paths twice in as many days doesn’t signify anything.
Blessed darkness enveloped him once again and he sighed, curling against the down-filled case to protect it with his body. It was his only ally against the enemy ninety-three million miles away. His stomach roiled and rebelled but he didn’t think the pillow could help with that.
He followed behind, and tried his damndest not to laugh at the twin glares Sherlock and Laila gave each other as she passed into the sitting room to grab her purse. When they reached the top of the stairs, Laila stopped him with a hand to his chest.
He received a frown at that. “Not too badly aimed.” John reached out, like he wanted to touch Sherlock’s cheek, but Sherlock stepped away quickly and John’s hand fell back.
"Good 'ah' then." He gripped two fistfuls of arse and lowered his head again. He worked Sherlock over, using every trick he knew, lightly and rough, pointed and wide, learning what Sherlock liked best when he keened aloud and fisted the sheets. John took a lot of pride in his work, even though his jaw began to ache, he continued to push his tongue against and into Sherlock until he knew the man was about to break.
Sherlock nodded again, just the once, let go of John’s hand abruptly and then sat back in his seat.
John scowled, but it was a teasing thing, and Sherlock’s stomach flipped at the sight of it. He curbed his answering smirk and instead shuffled towards the untouched plate of biscuits, just for something to do with his hands.
Sherlock tensed infinitesimally. John wondered immediately what it meant. Who the hell was Seb?
“I mean, it’s your own head, but you could just scream out loud if you wanted.”
John burst into a fit of giggles, and like that, the tension of the previous minutes was gone. Sherlock hid a grin with the turn of his head.
John stares out into the distance as if he's no longer a part of the universe, let alone the conversation. And to think, he used to like Greg.
"We need a different strategy," Mrs. Hudson suggested. "Maybe we could shove them into a closet together and lock the door?"
a dark clad stranger from her perspective.
“Practical,” John noted. “Tilt-a-whirl it is then.” He moved with a purpose towards it but she stopped him with a hand.
“Hmm, gonna take a lot of practise then.” He did some sort of swivel maneuver that had Sherlock seeing stars. “I can’t wait.”
“Sure. I’ll be up half the night cramming.”
“God no. Since my parents allowed him guardianship he’s been a terror. He thinks it makes him all-powerful.”
“It’s not
John blinks stupidly at the dash. “Yes, I know. How…” He feels the first frisson of uneasy skate down his spine. “Have you been following me?”
Sherlock seemed to hesitate, mouth opened on an answer and then closed again. He finally settled on a nonchalant, “Entirely up to you.”
to be true though.
“No,” Sherlock answered truthfully, not sure why it mattered. John frowned up as he gently palpated the still swollen ankle. “I rarely do,” he went on to explain, “you know that.”
This wasn’t about getting his brother off his back. Sherlock truly wanted John to live with him. How could he have forgotten about the conclusion he’d come to just that morning? He was Sherlock’s only friend…
Sherlock continues to stare off into the kitchen, he’s blinking so fast now it’s like watching a time lapse video, but still he says nothing.
That shouldn’t have mattered to a man who was on the pull but maybe in John’s insane logic it made sense. Another thought occurred to Sherlock then.
“Snogging, necking, making out, smooching, tonsil hockey,
“At least wait until they're done," Janine whispered in Mary's ear. "Nobody wants to die with their dick out."
He rolled and smacked the empty space next to his head. Something about that felt wrong, though he couldn't for the life of him figure out why.
They’re both gasping when Sherlock pulls off, John with the rush of a stellar orgasm, Sherlock with the lack of oxygen. John will feel bad about that in a minute.
“You never said it was your birthday!”
"Sherlock," he groaned and motioned helplessly at the plastic bottle at the end of the bed. When he bent back to reach for it, his torso arched in a way that was not only beautiful to behold, but also angled his arse in just a way that John's eyes rolled. "Hurry. Hurry up, c'mon. Gimme that," he panted in a rush and snatched the bottle as soon as Sherlock turned around with it.
Sherlock had a date.
Sherlock really wanted John to move in. He’d apparently thrown a fit when he thought John wasn’t coming back, had attempted to wreck the spare room, John’s room, at the very thought. John tried not to read too much into it but… was it really that important to Sherlock?
“Hold on,” John interrupted, “your name is really Sherlock?”
“Are you ever going to give me a heads up?”
John shook his head. "All right. Fine." He stood a little straighter. "I am proud of him. Proud of us."
John looked up in time to see Mary level the pistol at him. Sherlock moved to intercede, to John's everlasting horror, but before she could decide to shoot the door burst in for a second time.
“John, text Lestrade, won’t you? Let him know we’ve found Ms. McCurdy.”
Christ, why did he sound so accusing? “No. She said she’s on good terms with Daniel again after the police questioned him, I guess. She swears he’s not a part of the drug ring.” He shrugged. None of his business.
John stared at his phone for five seconds before putting it back in his pocket with a sigh.
a slut.
Sherlock decided to ignore that. John went back to the paper. It took little time to realize internet research was a waste, nothing but low grade pornography. He huffed in frustration. Asking John was out of the question, he’d look like a fool. Although John had been a perfect tutor as far as Sherlock’s particular gap in sexual knowledge went. Perhaps he wouldn’t make fun. He glanced at John, weighing the pros and cons.
Sherlock quirked an eyebrow at him and a lopsided smirk appeared. “Are you going to make me smoke the whole bag as a punishment?”
“The swelling should have gone down by now but I’m not surprised it hasn’t, the way you aggravated it last night.” He frowned down at the ankle in a way that lead Sherlock to believe that wasn’t all John was upset about. When John licked his lips Sherlock knew he was gearing up to start an uncomfortable conversation.
"You're going to enjoy it as I'm walking away if you don't-"
They dance around the loo, trading hooks and jabs. If John’s honest, he’s having the time of his life. The man even seems to enjoy it when John lands a particularly solid blow to his jaw, his smirk doing things to John’s stomach that he tries valiantly to ignore.
John probed at the corner of his lips with his tongue, the tender flesh stinging now that the rush of serotonin had fled, and was grateful Bernard hadn’t pushed him that far. His love of a challenge was going to land him in A and E one day.
Hope flared, though he did his best to contain it before it reached his face. “I-“
“You are not a psychopath or sociopath, Sherlock. You’re one of the biggest bleeding hearts I know.” His lips twitched when Sherlock whipped his head over to stare at John in horror. “You are, you can’t hide it from me. Hell, the only reason you threatened me with crispiness this morning was so I didn’t mess with the evidence from that cold case you somehow weaseled from Greg. Don’t think I don’t know about that. Puzzles, you call them, but I see a man who is willing to help because he’s the only one who can.”
John was turning a vivid shade of red, his body language screaming his intent for violence, as Sherlock approached from behind.
“He’s a grown man, he can handle himself.”
John watched his own eyebrows inch toward his hairline in the mirror.
Sherlock's smirk didn't move at all. "Oh, I don't know. It's a bit flattering really." He slammed back down, hard, and John slapped his hands back onto those now sweaty thighs as he snapped his hips up.
The line would be closing soon. The carriage had been empty for some time when a lone passenger got on and sat directly across from John. He knew who it was before he even sat, before the Yves Saint Laurent shoes slid out to nearly touch with John’s brown brogues.
“For crying out loud, John, this makes no logical sense. What the hell do you need twenty-three centimeters worth of erectile tissue for?”
Mycroft’s head tilt asked.
"With..." Sherlock scowled at his knees. "With the Queen?"
He felt his defenses kick back in, seeing John becoming conflicted. “Absolutely not. It was an accident and there’s nothing at all to discuss. Now, if you’re finished.” He turned to leave but John stopped him again.
“And you’ve thought about this? About us?”
Sherlock sneered again. “Semantics,” he mumbled to himself and continued pacing.
“I could try and guess your second favourite animal if you’d like,” Sherlock offered as they exited the restaurant.
“Point,” John acknowledged. “But my parents have spilt booze gluing them together.”
“Oh, I’ll just take your word for it, shall I?” He asked with a smile.
The notes abruptly stopped and John jumped, sure he’d been caught creeping in the doorway. But when it wasn’t wrenched open he pushed it open himself to peer inside. Sherlock was at the window, his back to the room, just drawing the bow back up when John cleared his throat to make his presence known.
"Is he happy?"
A chirp sounded from the table and John did his best to ignore it the first time. When the ringtone went off he glanced down at in annoyance.
“So proper. Or it would be if you didn’t sound as breathy as a porn star.” John laid a few wet kisses against his already damp skin and slowly worked the zip down. John's hand snaked into the opening with care as the dark trousers were so tight it was near impossible to get inside without fighting. Once he got the trousers and boxer briefs out of the way and got his hand around hot flesh they both groaned in satisfaction.
to cause a scene…
Sherlock gasped, either at the idea or the sensation of John’s fingers toying with him through his trousers; he didn’t know, didn’t care.
“Am not!” He argued petulantly. “I just like to be comfortable. In case you haven’t noticed, it’s hailing outside!”
The harshness of sound and garishness of the lights quickly became more than just a little irritating to John, but he soldiered on for Scarlett’s sake. She stared on with an almost childlike glee as they passed vendors hawking wears and women wearing veils and scarves. He had to admit he was slightly impressed with the fire breathers but, really, he
Lestrade scoffed. “Oh, my mistake. You’re right, ingesting three bottles of cough syrup, perfectly sound life choice. Christ.”
Janine put her hands on her hips and scowled. "You all like to have a go, but my romantic streak has kept you two alive for years. I believe a thank you wouldn't be amiss."
“Speechless?” John teased. His mouth opened and closed comically and John laughed. “It’s all right, love. I can think of a better use for your lips than talking.”
John stopped moving, though he hadn’t been aware of doing so to begin with. It was eerily quiet in the flat. Nothing from downstairs, nothing next door, not even London had anything to say.
The answer to that was beyond John at the moment. “I don’t know if he’d let me even try right now. Maybe tomorrow after he’s cooled down.”
Sherlock wanted to, he really, really did, but he hesitated. John wasn’t ready to hear his deductions on the incident yet; the moment of his possible death was too fresh, clearly.
“Anyway, you never answered my question. Favourite childhood memory.”
“Welcome to Kafé Kerouac. What can I get you?” He asked the next customer in line, with a pleasant smile.
“What about me?”
John rolls his head toward him. “Hmm? Oh. Afghanistan.”
“No. No no no no,” John whispered in a horrified clip. He rushed to tug Sherlock’s trousers up and was slapped six ways from Sunday when he tried to mop up the mess he’d made on Sherlock’s back with the tail of his shirt. By the time they had their clothes fixed Lestrade was casually walking inside. He stopped abruptly and after a four second scan of the floor(pencils still strung about), Sherlock’s shirt(buttons missing), John’s flaming face(cherry tomato red) and the state of his desk, he took a deep breath and let it out slowly in barely concealed rage, one that seemed aimed more at himself than anything, as if he was telling himself he should have known better. John felt his progress had come a long way since being caught by Peter Browning’s father. He didn’t cry this time at least.
He grinned at them both, pleased with the developments. He had yet to knock two out of the park in one go and it sounded like his kind of challenge.
Sherlock waited for further explanation.
"No," Greg said immediately. "We can't let that happen. If they haven't spoken before that we need to pull Sherlock out. He'll make a fool of himself if we let him have the floor in that state."
"There isn't" Sherlock interrupted, not looking up from his slides.
" he looked back at John "Because it's a deactivated station."
He flicked through them like an album. And like an album, every single picture came with a collection of memories. He remembered all of them, he remembered exactly what they smelled like, what they tasted like, what they sounded like, if they were bigger or smaller or rougher or faster- he remembered everything. But they were dead. They were dead and his nightmares were just that.
For a moment, John wasn't going to answer that. He was just going to brush it off and say half-truths like he had been doing so far, but something inside of him was screaming that he had dreamed of this – of having a chance to tell Sherlock everything he'd wanted before the man died – and now that he'd been granted this miracle he was walking away because he was too much of a coward?
Reassured, John started pushing back in just as slowly, and he could actually feel Sherlock relax around him. "You feel absolutely amazing, love" he whispered against Sherlock's skin, because he had never felt anything like this before. He'd never been inside another man, and it was tight like he couldn't believe it.
When his phone buzzed he was drinking his morning coffee and carefully scanning his emails. Surely there had to be something here above a six? Above a five? He was on the verge of taking a four at this point, honestly.
John sighed, rubbed his eyes tiredly and then resumed running his hands through Sherlock's curls.
His nightmares ranged from Moriarty being back to life, to John being killed by a sniper, to John being pushed off the roof of St. Bart's, to Sherlock being forced back into Serbia, to his actual time in Serbia and-
him like no one else.
John had been expecting it, but his heart still jumped a beat when he heard it.
"And the mission?" he asked, and subconsciously noted the priority of his questions- John first, always first.
She shook her head, but it was half-hearted. "If you're one of them, you're just going to bring more of you-"
He smiled the tiniest bit and sat down, too, leaning against the wall.
Sentiment, as if the man even had any- Sherlock was dead and-
"Sherlock? Are you ok?"
In an attempt to get some information- any information on Sherlock's case, John tried to ask the doctor in charge, once, why they were feeding Sherlock through an IV rather than the less damaging feeding tube. He knew very well that the former was used in cases where that was damage to the digestive track. The doctor had simply told him it was the best approach for this case, and did not elaborate further.
"You've used it" Sherlock's pointed out, fixated on that fact.
There was nothing but their heavy breathing for a while, and then it was the consulting detective who moved first. He leaned forward the tiniest bit, their foreheads bumping together for a moment before he captured John's lips with his own. This time, their mouths opened experimentally, tongues finding each other and making contact for the first time.
But he couldn't tell John any of that, could he.
"It's a pretty big bed, John." He said, finally. And that was his answer.
Still frowning, John followed the detective out into the living room. "Did you… not want me to go?" he asked slowly, very confused.
Come August, Sherlock had actually started leaving the flat with John. He wasn't jogging, of course, but they took strolls around the park a couple times a week and then finished the evening at Angelo's to eat some dinner. The detective joked, on the second time, that it was their date night, but it actually stuck and after that those days were known as such.
Shaking his head, John focused and went to the cabinet where they kept clean sheets and procured a new set, including a thick, cozy blanket.
"I'm upset I haven't gotten to the end of this already." The detective said curtly, but at the same time he shifted closer to John's warmth.
He arched again, more deliberately this time, and it cued John into rubbing himself softly against him. But this time, Sherlock also reached for his lover's left hand and interlaced their fingers in a loving gesture. With his head tilted back as it still was, he softly said John's name.
"I know. I know, Mycroft told me. He told me about Moriarty's web, and about the snipers, and everything." John said and his hands were closed into fists. He looked like he was going to say something else, but then decided not to.
Sherlock had stopped working on his puzzle entirely and was looking at John with a quiet sort of interest.
He felt the wall blindly for a light switch and when he found it, he had to squint as the room came to life before him.
He pointedly widened his eyes and shook his head a bit, trying to call himself back to the real world, the room. Scotland Yard. Case.
"I, err, can wait outside" John replied automatically, halfway out the door.
"He spoke some this time" she told him with a smile "He was a bit agitated, but he's getting better"
The room was dim enough that it'd be very hard to see what Sherlock was holding unless one angled it towards the light. No lamps were turned on in the room, but the moon was full and shiny in the sky and it casted a bright, white glow through the large windows.
John looked at her with a closed expression and she looked away.
"What are you grinning about, I'm still making you apologize" he told her very pointedly, running a hand up and down his short hair.
"Sally" Sherlock replied belatedly with fake pleasantness.
For the first couple of seconds, John frowned the tiniest bit, not understanding the question; they were literally touching from shoulder to feet. When the meaning downed on him he felt his heart skip and his cock twitch at the same time.
"When you- was that why you didn't want to eat? When you woke up?" he asked, and he was severely glad his tone sounded almost conversational. That was good, that was normal, normal was good.
When Sherlock found his violin, the absolutely heartbroken look on his face almost made John's heart stop. The doctor hadn't even remembered; hadn't even made the connection before. Sherlock had been robbed of one of the things he loved the most in this world, and John would have given anything – his own hands if he could have – to give it back to him.
He heard a faint "Dr. Watson?" behind him and he managed to shout back "Family emergency!" before he disappeared through the surgery's doors.
She was still sizing him up, her mouth shut, trembling. Her nostrils flared in determination as her tears slowed down. "Kick it here." She ordered. "Don't do anything funny. I'll shoot you."
Sherlock nodded, his expression curious and bordering on hungry.
It was late at night; John was sat in his comfy armchair reading a medical journal when stirring from the bed made him look up.
His past drug abuse meant he had a very high tolerance to narcotics, and so his morphine dosage was through the roof. It was the main reason why he was still so out of it; he was essentially high as a kite twenty four seven.
He kissed his partner's unconscious form and went to sleep with a soft smile on his face.
That same week, Mycroft brought Cluedo of all things and John only wished he had popcorn to watch the two brothers play, it was so amusing.
"Mr. Holmes, I need you to lean on the door frame, can you do that for me?" she asked as she already pushed him towards it.
John propped himself up onto his elbows despite really not wanting to move and looked at his partner worriedly "Hey, talk to me? Are you ok?"
Sherlock sat by the window, and it was equal parts refreshing and intimidating to watch as the scenery went by and he took in the outside world for the first time in forever. He looked a bit nervous, bundled up in a dressing gown over hospital clothes – he hadn't bothered to change and they were comfortable and familiar.
They were talking now, catching up, a light in Sherlock’s eyes speaking volumes. John had seen him sham before, this was genuine emotion. The words didn’t even matter, all that mattered was Sherlock laughing into his cup as Victor sat across, smiling shyly into his own.
Rapid fire thoughts zipped behind Sherlock’s eyes, John could sense his hesitation before answering, weighing the outcome of honesty.
“Five times now I've tried to initiate,” he admitted softly, “and I'll own every one of those pathetic attempts, even the one tonight. I'm sorry for that by the way." Laila smiled, cheeky thing. “But every time I think, maybe there’s something there, like we’re on the same page, he does something-" John remembered the Victor comment again and raged anew, jaw clenched hard in his anger.
John was ready to tear his hair out when Laila pulled him roughly by his shirt front and snarled, “That’s Irene Adler and if you know what’s good for you, you’ll shut up and let me dump you. Ready?” Without any more warning than that she open palm slapped him across the face. “I knew it! You bastard! I can’t believe I fell for your lies! I never want to see you again, John Watson!”
“Criminology?” John blurted out.
There was little in the way of promises to meet again, a half-hearted hug outside the cab, in which Scarlett managed to mostly include the huge stuffed bear as a buffer, and he was back in the cab before she made it to her door. He was a shit for not putting much thought towards her again but he couldn’t stop from picturing those multi-faceted eyes as they’d pierced right through him. They’d pulled out his darkest secrets; things even Ella didn’t know. How could he let that go without finding out
"All over this eight hundred quid suit that you didn't want to pay for I might add," Sherlock grunted and groaned at him, tightening his grip and sending John over the edge.
“All right! I get it! Give me a moment to think, would you?” They just turned the corner onto Baker Street when Sherlock finally answered, “Dancing. I enjoyed dancing.”
“Dogs aren’t bland,” Sherlock continued whinging. “There are over a hundred and sixty breeds-"
“Sherlock,” John admonished, though with less bite than he might’ve under normal circumstances.
“Mmm, Romany Dagger. I do like the sound of that,” he admitted, palming said bit of flesh until Sherlock was panting.
Sherlock inclined his head. “True, but I’d never truly do anything to endanger either you or Mrs. Hudson.”
“Er,” John attempts to articulate his discontent but Sherlock cuts him off.
"It's just that... I think if I'd left them alone they might have... They were sitting awfully close you see. Maybe if I'd just turned Tessa away they might have...let things progress naturally." She wrung her hands in guilt. Greg leaned in and wrapped an arm around Mrs. Hudson's shoulders, murmuring comforting platitudes to her. Molly thought back to the day Sherlock had asked her to come investigating with him, when Molly and Greg had first tentatively broached this very subject. Skirting as usual, never really saying what they both were thinking, that Sherlock had learned some new things while he was away, how very obvious it was that he missed John.
John looked ready to do murder. Perhaps, Sherlock thought,
it was Sherlock playing. Mrs. Hudson had sworn he was capable of playing beautifully, but John had never heard it before; nothing as terribly haunting as the strains echoing down from above. He tiptoed the final few stairs, not wanting to bother Sherlock while he played.
“Look,” John interrupts, “it’s fairly obvious to me that those are the bad guys, yeah? I understand that doesn’t automatically make you good, but you haven’t shot any defenseless animals yet-”
“Oh, John. You’re so beautiful. I knew you would be but I never imagined… I never thought…” Sherlock pants, alternating between staring at their cocks as they slide against each other and back up to kiss him hard.
“This is absurd.” Sherlock tugged on his hair in frustration, turning away to pace some more.
“John!” He called out one last time, tapering off into a groan as he pulsed against the sofa cushion.  Belatedly he knew he’d been having off with the cushion for the last thirty seconds but the sensation had been background noise to the feeling of John behind him, swinging angrily at his arse.
“Nothing,” John is quick to say, “just, uh, wondering what you’re going to do with yours.”
she play the innocent with him.
“Christ,” John breathed.
“Oh, John, this is so sweet of you. I haven’t been to the carnival in years!” Scarlett chirped excitedly by his side as he fished out the cash for their tickets.
Mary gave a sarcastic curtsy. "Margery, how do you do?"
Sherlock’s eyes held no pity, nothing to give away the taboo nature of his next statement.
Sherlock growled in frustration, apparently having had enough, and brought his knee up, hard, into John’s soft bits.
“Yeah, it’s fine,” she waved him on, “go. Tell Sherlock I said hi.”
John starts when his coffee cup is yanked from his hand.
“The roommate called about an hour ago, says Laila has skipped classes before, even called off work but never both and never without letting someone know why. The room looks clean but-“
After he failed to respond to John’s question, the man quit the room in a huff. Just as well. John was too distracting in his sleep attire anyway.
The next morning John did indeed wake up with a massive hangover. He was horrifically ill for the first two hours after waking.  It almost felt like a penance for all the misdeeds he’d managed the night before. He remembered it all perfectly well, despite all logic. He remembered Mike drag/carrying him back to the dorm. He remembered Bill swearing to watch over him but immediately bailing when his girlfriend showed up. And he remembered waiting for the sexual crisis to wash over him and being shocked when it never came. He fell asleep feeling restless but surprisingly okay with the night’s events. John didn’t put any stock in his Catholic upbringing; he’d forsaken that path at the age of nine, irreconcilable differences, but once a Catholic, always a Catholic, so he did his damnedest to call up some form of guilt. Try as he might though, he couldn’t seem to regret sleeping with a bloke. At least, not in the way he knew his mother would want. The idea of it did seem strange in the light of day, he supposed. Not bad, but certainly out of character for the previously straight John Watson. He’d noticed men before, of course, but in what seemed a perfectly normal ‘yes he’s good looking’ sort of way. Never in the ‘I’d like to gag on his penis’ sort of way. So it made sense to feel a bit hung up on that part but, if anything, the more he thought about it, the more he wished he’d gotten the mystery bloke’s name at the very least. Maybe he could clear some of these thoughts and feelings up if they had another chat. Or maybe they could just snog it out.
“All right.” John chuckles at the ceiling. “Time for sleep I think. It’s been a long day.”
He gripped the torch in his pocket and compulsively clicked the button on and off while he slowed his thoughts enough to study each one. “I was explaining, understanding that you don’t have relationships with males, I would appre- enjoy, greatly enjoy, your continuing to live at Baker Street, continuing to solve crimes with me, while being friends... who also happen to... do physical things... and share a significant portion of their time together, excluding other people.” He thought about the couple on the train, and decided on an addendum. “Also, I'd like very much if we held hands and also you can touch my hair. If you want."
"I'll let you in on a little secret," he pulled at Sherlock's belt until he took the hint and lifted up enough for John to get his hands underneath, "not everything we do is for your specific enjoyment." He tugged the leather until it was loose enough to work Sherlock's trousers and pants down over his lush behind, and admittedly felt a little self satisfied when he threw them into a heap beside the bed.
John was kissing Sherlock’s throat as they came back down, and it occurred to him then and there that lovemaking didn’t end with orgasm. He could continue loving and being loved by John as long as he wanted. He tilted his head back down to get at John’s lips again, feeling such an immense welling of love pour out he might as well start writing bad poetry.
"Right. We need to get serious. True love is at stake."
Sherlock looked up at John, who waited patiently for him to explain.
Sherlock answered, “Gladly,” and wedged his hand between their stomachs to hold John once again. Immediately John pulsed in his hand, moaning and rocking harder against him.
“John, stop. John! Seriously, stop,” he begged, clutching at John’s head in near panic, doing his best to scoot up the bed and away.
“You hope to become a doctor, correct?” Mycroft addressed John directly again, who flinched at the abrupt attention.
He turned away and pulled Lestrade far enough from the car that Sherlock couldn’t hear. Try as he might the door to the car wouldn’t budge. He tried the other side but no such luck. How was he to sneak away if he couldn’t even get the blasted door open?
John turned an interesting shade of red and pointed sharply at Sherlock through the window. “You shut your trap! I’ll deal with you in a moment.”
“Whoa, hold on,” he ripped his hand away from her, “what the hell is going on?”
Sherlock nods once. “Yes.”
John’s hand felt heavy in his hair, fingers curling in and scratching against his scalp. If he’d been awake, Sherlock would have moaned.
"Nope."
John chuckled in confusion. “What?”
“Your hands told me you were a doctor. Dry from multiple washings with antibacterial soap, nails clipped short with regular maintenance. You’re bearing, hair and tan told me you were prior military, recently returned from deployment. Discharged from an injury, as evident by your limp. That’s psychosomatic by the way.”
John huffed out a slight laugh. "That's not what I meant but thanks for the visual." Sherlock's scowl said he didn't understand but didn't care to ask. "I'm about twenty seconds away from going off as is. If you plant your arse on me now I'll never last."
“Ah, business,” Victor answered. “My family is nothing but filthy barristers and JP’s, which I abhor, but we’ve the money to throw towards investments so I thought, what the hell, why not get a business degree and see what sticks.”
Sherlock moans, wicked and low, as they meet. His thighs clamp shut around John’s legs and John finds himself pulled down on top. Without breaking contact Sherlock manages to rip away John’s towel and shuffle them the right way in the bed, with John still situated between his spread thighs. He can’t think, between the lush heat of Sherlock’s lips and the evidence of Sherlock’s arousal pressing against his own, it’s pure sensation and little else.
“Yes.”
John narrowed his gaze, disliking the attempt to tell him what to do with his own cock. He gave Sherlock’s a cursory glance, back up to Sherlock’s eyes, back down to his cock.
“Wait!” Sherlock cried out.
"Oh." Mrs. Hudson looked down at her feet, her enormous hat dipped with the movement. "I think that might be my fault."
“You,” he explained, which was no explanation at all.
“John,” a horrifically familiar voice called out, stopping him in his tracts, though he wanted nothing more than to curl up and die outside somewhere, away from prying eyes.
“Dancing, huh? Like ballroom, salsa? What?”
“Have you tried this before?” John asked absently.
, John reminded himself again.
? You practically ran screaming when I kissed you.”
"No mystery there. It would have taken him eight minutes to bleed out, torn as he's managed to get himself. The shrubs acted as a sound dampener and he must have just had the unfortunate luck of maiming himself when no one was around to hear him cry out."
His pocket pinged.
'I'm going to look over some more case files.  We can have a violin lesson if you want.”
Sherlock shook his head as he typed with his free hand.  'I just needed to get outside for a little.'
'I can't help it.'
“As they say,” Sherlock whispered again, “‘Silence is medication for sorrow.’ But I no longer need the silence.”
'It's not the worst pain I've experienced.'
“Good. Sherlock, would you…”
He sat up and rubbed his eyes, then looked over to where Sherlock sat.  “Good morning.”
'I was about to ask you the same thing.'  Sherlock wondered if he'd responded too quickly.
'We'll figure it out.'
"Because none of this was your fault," John reasoned.  "You are responsible for your own decisions, but I understand why you made them.  I do wish you would have talked to me, but we can't go back and change it now.  I was angry.  At you.  For a long time, wondering why you would do that.  But not anymore."
