They didn’t know how fast the time passed, but when Cas looked at the clock on the wall the next time, it was nearing 11pm.
Castiel looked after his daughter and the man leading her towards the slides, then down at said man’s own daughter in his arms. Castiel had to laugh at the picture they gave off. To anyone else they surely looked like a couple with two daughters, going out for a day in the park. Frankly, that was what it felt like to Cas as well. But he knew this was not what was going on. Dean was straight, and only friends with him, and because of that he was so nice with Claire, nothing more. Nothing more at all. Even though deep inside Cas wouldn’t mind there to be more. But there wasn’t.
“Well, I made the best of it. My one brother, Gabriel, and my sister Anna helped me out a lot. My oldest brother is a bit of a different story. I mean, he’s not like my parents, he still acknowledges me as a part of his family, but he isn’t the one to initiate the contact” Cas retorted with a shrug. “You said Emma’s mother walked out on you?” he changed the spotlight to Dean’s own story. Slowly the man nodded. He wasn’t comfortable talking about Emma’s mother, but Cas had revealed his story, so Dean couldn’t very well refuse to tell his.
“Sure we can, Angel. But we have to head home first, so you can change into your outdoor clothes, okay?” he said and the little girl nodded. They arrived at their car and Castiel opened the door to the backseat, lifting Claire into her booster seat and strapping her in, making sure that she was seated securely. Claire moaned that her Dolly didn’t have a baby seat, but Castiel just told her she would have to make extra sure Dolly was safe then, and she’d have to hold onto her tightly.
Castiel walked down the flight of stairs and out of his apartment building. He reached his car and got in, turning on the heat so his car could warm up. It was only April, after all.
“No. Claire doesn’t have any contact to her mother. I have full custody of her” he said, his voice void of emotions. Dean nodded. It wasn’t long until Dean had full custody over Emma himself. At least if everything went the right way, which he was sure it would.
“Yes, it was fun. Uncle Gabe and I tried to make cupcakes, but we ate all the chocolate chips before, so we couldn’t make them anymore” she told her father with a serious face and Castiel grinned. Gabriel and Claire always got up to shenanigans when they were together.
“I gotta go finish that car, but I’ll come and get you once I’m done for today” he said to Sammy and left with a grin on his face. Pie always made him feel better.
“Yes, sure, why not. Claire loves going out. School finishes earlier on Tuesdays, so we would even have more time. Claire and I could come over to your place and then we could walk together. Your house is right on the way” Cas agreed, smiling. The two set a time to meet, and before they knew it Dean was pulling into the lot of Cas’ apartment building.
Chapter two
“Hey, Cas! I can’t believe you are here before 7.30pm. Did Anna kick you out of your own house, or were you finally able to leave without making a huge fuss about leaving Claire with our sister” Gabe said in greeting, his eyes glinting with the joke he just pulled on Cas’ expense. Gabriel knew exactly how very much Cas cared and worried about his daughter, but that didn’t mean he didn’t make jokes about it.
“Hey, Angel! Did you have fun at Uncle Gabriel’s?” Cas asked when Claire leaped up from the couch and lifted her arms to be picked up. Cas did how demanded and perched the little girl on his hip, receiving a kiss and tight hug.
“Angel, that’s because she is a baby. You used to be this small as well” her father explained, and if it was possible, Claire’s eyes widened even more.
And it didn’t hurt that Castiel was on the better looking side of the population. His eyes, these bright blue eyes, seemed to have etched themselves into Dean’s head, following his every thought.
“Yes, we’ll be there, you can count on it!” Cas replied with a smile and got out of the car. He turned to wave at Dean when he backed out and Dean copied the motion.
“Great, Imma be outside” Dean said and the call disconnected. Dean stepped back from the door and leant again his car crossing his arms in front of his chest. It really was still quite chilly in the evenings.
On his way back to his home Dean couldn’t keep the smile from his face. It seemed like he had a date on Tuesday, even if it was only on the playground and included two little girls. He couldn’t wait for the days to pass!
Dean wasn’t worried over the fact he was thinking about another man in this way. He was secure in his sexuality, preferring both men and women. In fact, come to think of it, Dean had had more boyfriends than girlfriends throughout his years of dating. He knew he was bisexual, and so did the people surrounding him. His family was supportive of whomever Dean chose to spend his life with, it being a man or woman wasn’t of important. After the disaster with Emma’s mother, they were happy as long as Dean was happy.
It didn’t take Dean all too long to get back home, his parents’ house wasn’t far from his own, which Dean found to be very useful in situations like the one he was in this evening. He wouldn’t have been able to get to his parents with a short notice had they been living further away.
The door bell rang just when Dean came back downstairs with Emma in his arms. He walked over to the door, breathing in once (why he didn’t really know) and then opened it. It was as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders the minute he saw Castiel and Claire smile at him.
Castiel parked his car in the lot of the bar, looking the doors and made his way towards the entrance. It wasn’t really packed yet, what with it being only 7pm and a Wednesday, but Castiel still liked the atmosphere of it. It felt homely.
“Yes, that’s right, I did call. You know, this might sound really crazy, but Claire has been talking about nothing but Emma the last few days, and she’d really like to have a play date. I mean, I know Emma is technically too small to even have a play date, and I told Claire that, but she insisted on having me ask you anyways” Castiel explained. Dean didn’t know if he was only imagining this or if it was there for real, but Castiel sounded really flustered and nervous about asking.
“So, all the parts that are salvaged from the cars we can’t resell are catalogued and then stored so we have an inventory for whenever someone comes by looking for a specific car part -”
“Oh, sweetheart, you can get me many things, but for now I just need a whiskey on the rocks, please!” Balthazar drawled, grinning at the woman across from him.
“Nah, I wasn’t at work yesterday. Emma had her six month check up yesterday, and I am proud to say that she is a healthy and well developed little girl” Dean said, grinning widely and leaning over the stroller to tickle this little girl sitting inside, letting her erupt in giggles. Dean looked good with a smile on his face, Cas had to admit. But no, this was not the time to think about things like that.
“Hello?” Dean heard Cas answer, his voice questioning.
“Hey! One, my baby would never make weird noises, because I know how to care for her, and second, I would never be this irresponsible with Emma driving in the car as well. I wouldn’t risk her well being. Plus, I know how to look over cars, so I would have repaired baby myself” he defended himself, earning another laugh from his mother.
“Trust me, dear Gabriel, I get laid often enough for that being the problem” Balthazar replied, winking at Meg who had just brought him his drink. The waitress rolled her eyes, but didn’t lose the smile, so she wasn’t offended. She shouldn’t be, she had known Balthazar long enough now to know he was only playing around.
When dinner was done, Cas started running water over the dishes, while Dean settled Claire into the living room with a Disney movie. He then walked back into the kitchen, helping with cleaning the dishes and picking up around the kitchen. Once they were done with that, they settled back at the table, both with a mug of coffee, and continued talking about everything that came to mind and was at the same time in safe, non-awkward territory.
The drive was short and comfortable, Sam as always complaining about Dean’s taste in music, and Dean threatening to throw his younger brother out and making him walk home. That shut Sam up. He might be athletic and jogged more days than not, he wasn’t fond of walking home in his office clothes, though.
“Papa! I had a great day today! And I cared for Dolly really great, because she’s my baby and she needs to be helped, because she is still tiny, like Emma” the girl babbled once she had taken her father’s hand and was led out of the room. Castiel turned back around to wave good bye at Ms Parker, while uhu-ing and ahh-ing at his daughter’s words. He helped her into her jacket, or rather, had to hold Dolly while Claire put on her sneakers and light anorak, and then opened the door outside. He handed his daughter’s ‘daughter’ back to her and together they walked back to the high school and towards their car.
“That’s right, I’m not. This occasion was set up by my father” he simply said, and Dean’s frown deepened. Cas took a sip of his coke, then continued. “He saw it necessary to set me up with a woman to get me back onto the right path.”
“Really? Wow!” she said, looking back to Emma for a moment, then back to her father. “Papa, I’m hungry.” Claire’s father nodded and set her down on the ground.
would stay with her grandparents.
“You be a good girl, alright, princess? Be nice to grandma and grandpa” he said to his daughter, grinning when the girl answered in undistinguishable babbles. He walked with her in his arms towards the front door, where he then passed Emma over to his father.
It was Friday. Three days had gone by since Dean had last seen Castiel and his daughter, and still he wasn’t able to get the two, but the father more seriously, out of his head. It didn’t pass an hour without him thinking about the dark haired man with the uncommon name. Uncommon, but strangely fitting. Dean really couldn’t imagine Castiel with any other name. It was his, and his alone, and that made him even more interesting.
Castiel had talked a few moments on the phone, the conversation actually taking longer than necessary, because his opposite on the phone couldn’t find the right files, when Claire stood up and stood in front of him, her little face scrunched up in discomfort.
“Papa, I didn’t saw him, but I ran into him, but the mister was very nice and helped me up” the girl exclaimed hugging the man tightly around the neck and then motioning to where Dean still stood, looking over at the display while having his pointer finger grabbed tightly by Emma. Dean smiled slightly at her words and shrugged. Claire’s father came towards him, smiling as well.
“Dean, can you take me home with you later?” Sam asked, not even bothering with a hello. The two had always had a close relationship, being best friends as well as bothers. No matter what, Dean would always have his baby brother’s back and vice versa. Dean more than once had beat up his brother’s bullies during middle and high school.
“Well, someone definitely has it cozy” Dean commented when he saw his daughter curled into Cas’ arms, her little hand clutching the man’s shirt and her eyes closed.
When Castiel arrived home later that night, he still wasn’t entirely sure if calling Dean and asking him out would be the right idea, but he would just do it anyways. He had to be daring for a change, and what was the better time to be daring than to maybe make a friend, or something more.
“Who’s that?” she asked loudly, interrupting her father, who was just about to reply to Dean’s words. Dean smiled and looked down at his little girl.
“Hey Cas, how are you?” Dean asked on the other side, and Cas wasn’t too sure, but he could have sworn he heard a sigh from the other man. But this could also just be his head playing games with him.
“Well, Joanna Beth, do you have a table for us?” Dean asked, turning back to the barista. The blonde nodded and led Dean and Cas to one of the tables in the dining area.
“Well, then you should find out! You need to call him and ask if he wants to go out for some drinks. Start talking, digging, you know?” Gabe suggested, holding up a hand to stop him when Castiel started to shake his head. “Come on, Castiel, you have been single for how long? Four years? Five? Except for the little stint in the hays with Claire’s mother, you have been dry humping your pillow the last years, am I right?” he asked. Cas didn’t deem his question worthy of an answer.
In that moment, Cas phone started ringing and he excused himself to take it. It was the school’s administrations office, wanting to know about some of his students change of contact data.
Moving hadn’t stopped his father from interfering in his life though, because he had still managed to get Castiel to agreeing on going on a date he had found for the young man. Back then Castiel had thought agreeing to what his parents said, even though he knew already seeing a girl wouldn’t help in getting him to realize that he was straight after all, would better the relationship he had with his mother and father. It had failed, of course, because when his father had found out Castiel was going to raise his daughter on his own, even though he was gay, he had been furious and demanded for Castiel to leave the family. He had urged Gabriel and Anna not to associate with Castiel anymore, because he wasn’t part of the family anymore, but both of them had told their father that they would do no such thing.
When he really couldn’t do anything else, he picked his baby back up and sat down on the couch with her settled on his chest. Emma babbled happily, obviously enjoying the close contact to her father.
“Yes, nice to meet you, too. I’m Castiel” he answered, his voice taking on a weird twinge. Dean didn’t know what it was about, but Cas didn’t seem all that comfortable.
“Papa!” she said to him, hopping from one foot to the other, this time not in excitement though, Castiel could clearly see that. He held up a finger for her to wait.
“Thanks Mom” he said, taking the cup from his mother’s hands and taking a sip.
“I apologize. This is my daughter. Apparently she is visiting her grandmother today” Mr. Novak said in explanation, but then motioned for Mr. Singer to continue.
“Yes, that sounds good. Give me your address and I’ll pick you up at six, that way you won’t have problems finding the Roadhouse. It’s a little out of the way” Dean suggested. Cas told the other man his address and said his good bye, breathing deeply when he lowered his phone to the desk.
“Yeah, hey, it’s Dean” he answered, his voice more breathy than he liked to admit, or liked it to be. He seriously had to get a grip. “My mom said you called, so I thought I’d get back to you.”
Ms Parker left and talked to one of the students helping out for work experience at the preschool. The girl nodded and walked over to Claire, apparently telling her she was being picked up. Claire stood up, with her Dolly in her arms and made to clean up around her, then took the older girl’s hand and let herself be led over to the door where her father was waiting with a smile.
“Sorry Ms. Milton” they both muttered sheepishly.
“Don’t worry Dean, she had Jo take some pies with her. I’ll make sure there will be enough for you two later once you are finished, alright” she reassured the older man and Dean’s smile was back on his face.
“Why not? If you don’t mind me asking” Dean prodded, feeling a little bad. He didn’t want to talk about Emma’s mother, so why would Cas talk about Claire’s?
“Too bad he’s on a sabbatical this year. I wonder what he’s doing… He’s too hot to spend it researching some boring historical facts. You were in his history class last year, right? Did he say anything about why he was taking the year off?” Candace asked the boys in front of them.
“Hey Claire, did you get something yummy to eat?” Dean asked when the girl arrived next to him. The girl just nodded, her eyes glued to Emma, who was still sucking at the bottle’s teat, trying to get even the littlest rest out of the bottle. Dean looked back at Claire’s father, who wore a grin on his face watching Claire.
“Have you been holding out on me, big brother? Do you have a new boyfriend?” Sam immediately began to tease and Dean shot him a look that could kill.
“Nice to see you, too, Ms Parker” he replied, smiling at the woman. She was very nice, a few years younger than him, and responsible for the girls in this group.
Castiel made his way towards his bedroom, unbuttoning the shirt he wore and changing into flannel pants and a shirt to sleep. He laid down on his bed and sighed. His siblings and best friends probably were right, everything would work out somehow.
“You’re welcome” Allison muttered with a devilish grin. She knew exactly how big Candace’s crush on the popular history teacher was. It was not her fault, really! Teachers should not be allowed to be that handsome!
“Sorry Bobby. Didn’t know you’d be in the middle of a performance” he said, then turned to the gathered group of seniors. “Hey guys! It’s nice to see you all.”
Once the baby was clean, Claire helping with passing over bottles of baby shampoo and body wash, he wrapped the infant in the towel Claire had picked out. He carried Emma over into her nursery, motioning for Claire to follow him. With a foot he pushed over a little step stool towards the changing table, so Claire could see what was happening. Dean changed Emma into a new pair of diapers and her pajama, then held a pacifier in front of her mouth, which Emma immediately accepted.
“Mr. Novak, who else? Who in their right mind would plan a field trip for high schoolers to a salvage yard? I’m way too old for this crap.” Candace had thought she hadn’t heard correctly when her home room teacher, Mr. Novak, had announced that their class would be taking a trip to the local salvage yard. According to him, the trip had a dual purpose. On the one hand, the seniors were supposed to learn about the trade (who of them had the dream of becoming a scrap yard owner, really?!); and on the other hand, they were supposed to pick up materials for their art class. That’s why Ms. Milton, the grade’s art teacher, accompanied them.
Castiel was making his way towards the entrance of the pre-k Claire attended while he was at work. It was just down the road, something Castiel was very glad about. He didn’t like letting Claire stay with people he didn’t know, but she’d have to start getting ready for school sometime. Still, it being so near had its perks. He was able to pop in whenever he was needed with only a moment’s notice and it wasn’t a problem for him to go and get her once school led out.
“That’s alright. I mean, yeah, maybe Emma is a little too young for that still, but if Claire really wants to see and play with her, why not? You could give me some more tips about what to expect with Em while you’re here” Dean reasoned, slightly grinning. The prospect of seeing Castiel again soon really made him happy, and he didn’t dare think about what this might mean to him.
“I have no idea about cars. I always freak out when my car makes a weird noise and immediately drive to the shop to have it looked at. Most of the times it’s nothing and I get laughed at, though” Castiel admitted, grinning slightly.
Finishing up on one of the paintjobs he had been assigned that day, Dean headed inside into the main building of Bobby’s garage, only to find his brother Sam and Bobby’s wife Ellen deep in conversation. Sam helped out at the garage, sorting through paper work every Friday, to earn some extra money. He was in college, and text books were expensive, even though their parents helped out as much as possible. When Dean walked inside and plopped down on one of the chairs in front of the desk Sam sat behind, the two stopped talking and Ellen made to get Dean a cup of coffee.
“I had fun, too, bug. See you soon, alright?” Gabriel replied, hugging the girl back and pressed a kiss to the crown of her head. While Claire put on her shoes, Gabe looked at his brother.
“Listen, is Claire back at your brother’s place on Saturday?” he asked after making sure Claire was safely back on the ground with both her feet.
“Dean!” she exclaimed, wrapping her arms around the man and squeezing tightly. When she loosened her grip she took the man’s face between her hands and placed a kiss smack on his mouth. She then stepped back and smiled even more when she saw the man behind the one she had just greeted.
With a groan, Candace and Allison took out their notepads, intent on actually listening now. If there was going to be a discussion in class later and they didn’t take any notes, they would be screwed.
“Well, that’s a pity, because I’d love some cupcakes” Castiel replied and fake pouted. In return Claire kissed her father once more and took his face between her two tiny hands.
“Stop it, both of you. I don’t even know if he is swinging this way. All I know is that he is a single father of a five month old, really cute, little girl.”
The drive home wasn’t a long one, and before Claire could really start fretting about her Dolly’s safety without a car seat they had arrived in the parking lot of their apartment building.
“Guys, I want you to actually take notes on the tour, okay? We are going to talk about the structure of the yard in class next time. This is not just a field trip to pass the time outside the classroom, you can actually learn about business structures here. I know some of you will enter the field of business ownership sometime in your future, so it will be useful knowing the basics” Mr. Novak instructed the students.
Castiel walked through the room towards the table the three men always occupied. His brother was already sitting in one of the chairs, a cup of coffee in front of him. They weren’t in the bar to get drunk, so they never really ordered any alcohol, unless someone was in some sort of social crisis and couldn’t deal with it without the help of some liquid luck. But because Balthazar was the third in their round, it happened more often than Cas liked. He didn’t like getting drunk, he had a daughter to care for.
“I could take her, if that’s alright, so you don’t have to end the call” he offered and Castiel looked at his daughter.
“Yes, she really is. You have to be careful with your hair, she loves gripping hair” he said and Claire nodded. She waited for Emma to release her finger again and then went to sit next to her father, taking a sip from her glass of juice that still stood on the table.
Dean motioned Cas to follow him as he weaved through the tables and walked towards the bar, where a blonde girl was just serving drinks. The girl began to smile brightly when she spotted Dean and left her customers to their devices while she walked around the counter.
“So, do you have anything planned for Tuesday afternoon? I thought we could maybe all go to the playground again. I’m sure Claire wouldn’t have anything against that!” he asked. He figured it would do well to include the children, so it didn’t seem as if Dean was only interested in Castiel and not the whole deal. He wanted to pursue Castiel, and he knew the man only came in a pack with his daughter.
“Yes, Balthazar was being his moany self again, and then they both persuaded me to call this guy I met tomorrow. I really don’t know if it’s a good idea, I don’t even know if he’s bi or gay anyways” Cas told his little sister, and Anna smiled. She shuffled in her seat and rested her head on her older brother’s shoulder. The two had always a very tight relationship, telling each other everything. It had been Anna who Cas had told first that he was gay. And Cas was the first one to get to know that Anna actually didn’t want to become a doctor like their father expected, but that she wanted to be a kindergarten teacher.
“Hey, you’re back later than usual” she said when he sat down next to her, stretching his legs under the coffee table.
“Everyone, this is Mr. Singer. He owns the salvage yard and is going to talk to us a little bit about his trade and business” Mr. Novak explained once everyone had gathered. The older guy began talking about buying crashed cars and what he was doing with them, but Candace and Allison successfully tuned out the presentation.
“I did not see that coming, to be honest. I mean, who even knew they weren’t straight!” Allison mused, also watching the familial scene unfold in front of them.
“Great, just give me your address and we’ll be there at three tomorrow!” Cas enthused. Dean did exactly that, and after a short good bye he put down the phone next to him on the couch.
“Bye Claire, see you soon” he said. Dean waited until Cas and Claire had opened the door to their building. Cas waved once more at the taller man, receiving a smile. Dean then turned and made his way down the pathway and out onto the sidewalk again.
The three enjoyed their meal together, both men listening to Claire telling them exactly what she did with Emma over the course of the afternoon, agreeing with her and answering at the right moments.
“Right? Whoever puts up with Mr. Novak’s crazy at home deserves a medal!”
After being satisfied by the look of his house, Dean made his way upstairs and into his bathroom, turning on the water in the shower so it could heat up while he undressed.
Mr. Winchester, in washed-out jeans, a plaid overshirt and a baby strapped to his chest in one of those ergonomic baby carriers.
“It was nothing. Have a nice day” he said, waving at Claire, making her grin. “Bye Claire.”
Chapter three
“And Papa, Tiffany said she knows that babies need help with everything, because she has a little sister, and she’s a baby, too. But Tiffany also said that babies always cry, but that’s not true, us is, Papa? Because Emma didn’t cry when I saw her. She was really nice and laughed, not cried” Claire asked, looking at her father with large eyes.
Castiel wasn’t one of these run off the mill people, he was interesting, and interested in things that not many people laid their focus on. At least that was what Dean thought about the man. He was positively intrigued with him.
“I’m sure you’ll work something out. Maybe you just need to get out of your normal surroundings for a bit, go on vacation and clear your head” Castiel suggested, trying to bring their conversation back to the original subject.
“She just turned four. The weeks leading up to her birthday were almost unbearable. She asked everyday if it was her birthday already. I felt kind of bad having to tell her, no it wasn’t her birthday yet. She always looked so sad when she realized she would have to wait another day” he said, grinning at the memory.
“Sweetheart, where is your Mommy or Daddy?” he asked softly again, worrying the little girl had lost her way. The girl looked around herself, obviously trying to find her parents, like Dean had done before.
Castiel looked forward to meeting Dean again. He had to admit, him getting the number hadn’t been entirely altruistic.
“Daddy!”
“Kudos to you, Cas! I don’t know what I would have done if that had happened to me. I was already out of it after Emma’s mother walking out on us, but having a baby put into your arms without any warning and explanation must have been the shock of your life time!” Dean said, truly impressed.
“Yeah, it’s alright. I’m actually surprised she let you pick her up just like that. She’s normally a bit picky with who is allowed to touch her. I’m glad about that though, it’s healthy that she can tell strangers from family. But it seems she had no problems with you” he said, Castiel nodding along to his words. What he said was true. It was important infants learned to be able to distinguish between familiar people and strangers.
They reached the Roadhouse after a while, and Dean parked in his usual spot next to Ellen’s car. The two men got out and walked over to the entrance. The bar/diner was filled with people chattering and laughing, a jukebox was playing music in the background.
“I still want you guys to focus on the topic of this field trip, but I guess we need to clear the air for that to happen.”
“Of course he knows about Claire. He is really sweet with her. He’s got a daughter himself, she’s five months old” Cas explained and Anna nodded.
The man walked through the hallway towards a bright yellow painted door that was slightly open. He pushed it open further to reveal a class room full with little girls and boys around Claire’s age. His daughter herself was sitting in one corner of the room, surrounded with doll clothes, cradling her baby doll in her arms, pretending to give her a bottle to drink. Next to her sat Tiffany, Claire’s best friend, doing the same. It was play time, apparently.
But Dean was fine. He wasn’t all alone with caring for Emma. His mother and father were there whenever Dean needed extra help, as well as his brother and his girlfriend Jessica. Dean had made sure Emma would grow up within an intact family, even if she wouldn’t have a mother, at least not a biological one. Who knew what would happen to him along the way of his daughter’s life. He still had more than 17 years of caring for the girl in front of him, after all.
“Well, Jo has a weird way of showing she likes you. The more she likes someone, the more open she is with affection. I guess I’m her favorite person” Dean explained further and Cas nodded again. It looked as if his shoulders were relaxing a bit more. He started looking through the menu, asking what Dean could recommend. That was a hard question, because Dean loved all food served at the Roadhouse.
“What the fuck?!” was all Candace could get out.
“I hope you’ll have a story to tell then. I’m rooting for you, you know?” Gabe grinned and wiggled his eyebrows, making Cas snort. Sometimes his brother really was too much!
Candace’s head swam as she saw the little girl squirm in Mr. Novak’s arms, sliding down to the ground, only to run across the yard towards the man who was very much their favorite history teacher, Mr. Winchester.
When they arrived in the kitchen they were met with the smell of cooking food. Cas turned around when he heard them enter and smiled.
“Do you ask because of the way she greeted me?” he asked further and Cas shrugged.
“I go to grandma” the little girl explained, her voice steady and carrying across the lot.
Moments later the blond girl came back and after adjusting her clothes, father and daughter, and Dolly, made their way outside again, this time taking the elevator instead of the stairs because of the doll buggy in tow.
“I’m fine, thanks. Anyways, like, I told you last week I’m always open for giving you some more advice, and I though, like, we could maybe go out for drinks or something, and talk. That’s just an idea, though, if not that’s totally fine, really” Cas started, getting way ahead of himself. Really? Cas felt like a complete fool right about now.
“Shut up, Gabriel. I’m never later than 7.30” he rebutted, but smiled when the waitress walked towards their table.
“Yeah, sure, but don’t you have a car of your own” the older brother asked, and received a groan and from his opposite.
“Coffee?” he asked and Castiel nodded. It wasn’t long until their drinks were done and with their mugs, and a cup of juice for when Claire got thirsty, they went back into the living room, to keep an eye on the little girls there.
“Alright then, let me bring you to the door” Castiel relented, ushering the younger woman out of the living room.
“I kinda wish I was back in chemistry class right now.”
“Anyways, we know that Balth sucks at writing, so we shouldn’t continue talking about it I think. We don’t want our favorite English man to be upset” Gabe finally said, earning a slap over the head from Balthazar. “What is my favorite little niece up to lately, anyways, Cassie? Claire is way more interesting than you and Balth combined” he changed the subject gracefully. Sometimes Cas thought Claire had inherited that trait from her uncle.
Castiel hadn’t heard anything from her until the moment she stood in front of the door with Claire in her arms.
“My older sister used to be in Mr. Novak’s class, but in her senior year, he was on paternity leave for the year. So I guess there has to be someone he comes home to every day. Poor woman!”
“Well, that’s really not acceptable, then, huh, making you walk even more” Dean said and with a quick motion whisked her up into his arms and sat her down on his shoulders. Claire squealed at the height and rested her hands on Dean’s head, but was calming down once the man held her tightly around the ankles to steady her.
After showering and shaving, Dean walked into his closet, looking for clothes that were appropriate to wear for this outing. He didn’t want to seem too eager, it was just a few drinks with a friend, after all. He didn’t want to look as if he didn’t care, though, either.
“She’s really cute, Dean. How old is Emma?” he asked and Dean looked up, shifting his attention towards the man again.
“Just leave the carrier base here and we’ll drop her off at your place tomorrow. We are invited for lunch at Bobby and Ellen’s, so you are right on the way” she explained and Dean nodded. He quickly walked out and unhooked the infant carrier base from the seat, then setting it on the ground next to the front door on the porch.
Dean looked back at Emma, the girl still drinking her bottle of formula eagerly, while looking at her father with wide eyes. Emma looked a lot like him, you could already see that. Her hair was a light brown color, thin and soft, and her eyes were slowly changing into the piercing green that he sported as well.
“Shut up, bitch” he said, earning a slap over the head from his mother.
Still, getting to his car, home, and into her outside clothes was done a lot quicker this time around, and Castiel didn’t even have to tell Claire to go to the bathroom either. While Claire put on her shoes, Castiel quickly sent a text to Dean, telling him they were on their way to his place. Only a moment later he got an answer, telling him they’d wait outside the house.
“Thank you. She’s a little over seven months now. At first I thought it would be hard caring for her the older she got, but so far, Emma really is a model baby, not making a lot of fuss” he said, a smile grazing his face. It was obvious he was smitten with his child, like he should be.
“Claire!!”
Mr. Winchester seemed to have the decency to look sheepish.
“Hey, I’m Jo! Nice to meet you!” she said and held out a hand. Dean saw Cas frown, but take the offered hand and shook it.
“Language!” she scolded her older son. It didn’t matter that Dean was 26 years old and an adult living on his own. His mother still had power over him. But she also still made him pie sometimes, so it wasn’t too bad.
“Yes, that sounds good. Claire stays with my brother on Saturday, so I won’t have to worry about her either. How about around six?” he asked, his voice getting back to his normal tone now that he knew that Dean was alright with him asking. It wasn’t as if this was a date, anyways.
He was the first to admit that he used to be king of picking people up when he was younger, but he had become more mature over the years and stopped sleeping around. He was looking for something stable, not for hook up after hook up. Especially with Emma now. He didn’t want to have people going in and out of her life at frequent intervals. He wanted a stable surrounding for her to grow up normally.
“I’m right back” Dean said, leaving the two alone in the kitchen.
“Well, how old is Claire?” Dean eventually asked, breaking the silence that was only slightly underlined with the squeals and laughs from Emma and Claire. At the subject of his daughter, Castiel smiled.
“I’ll have the double cheeseburger with fries and a coke” he ordered, and both Dean and Jessica grinned. When Cas frowned at their antics, Dean grinned wider.
“You ready, Angel?” Castiel called out when he had packed a back pack with the things he had to take with him, and he heard soft feet padding over to the kitchen. Claire was fully dressed, her shoes already on her feet, Dolly in her buggy.
“Yes, I mean, I was here a lot during my late teens and early twenties. Practically every night… It helps when the owner is practically your aunt” he said with a shrug. Cas nodded at that.
“Yeah, she spend every Saturday night there” Cas replied, question clearly written across his face.
“I guess I’m not the only one in a little girl’s good book!” Dean said, just when Claire ran back to them and looked first at her father, but then turned her look towards the other man.
“But you want something else to happen, don’t you? Did you at least find out if he swings your way? And did you make it obvious you were interested?” Gabriel urged, ignoring Cas’ words. Castiel sighed and put down his cup, leaning back in his seat.
“You know you love it when I put pictures like that into your head, Candace. Mr. Winchester, all sweaty, peeling out of a dirty overal, with nothing undernea-”
“Yes! Did you pack something yummy?” she asked and sat down on one side of Castiel, opening the bag and looking through the containers inside. She pulled out one filled with apples and began munching on one happily. Castiel turned back to the man still standing in front of the pair, smiling slightly at the familial interaction.
For the first few moments, no one said anything, both men nursing their coffee. It should have been awkward, but surprisingly it wasn’t. It was as if they had known each other for longer than just the few days they actually did, and as if their relationship to each other was already settled somewhere safe.
“Alright, we are leaving now. Have a nice weekend, Dean. If anything is wrong, call please” Mary announced and motioned for Sam to stand up.
“Look Papa! I’m more tall than you!” Claire squealed and Cas started laughing once he turned around and saw the sight Dean and his daughter made.
figured it didn’t seem as if Dean wanted this to end. Because he really didn’t. He wanted to find out as much as he could about Cas. He wanted them to get close. He didn’t care that he only had known Castiel for two weeks, they were getting on and he wanted to make the most of it. Dean adored Claire and Cas seemed to like Emma, so there didn’t seem to be a problem either. But he’d have to see if Castiel would be up for another meet up.
“Sammy, what are you doing here anyways? You left with your car this morning” Mary asked her youngest while busying herself with preparing a new batch of Dean’s favorite drink.
“Papa! Papa, look, there is Emma!” she said to him, her hands balled into tiny fists, a sign of her excitement.
“Yes, Gabe, we know you are wonderful and better than the rest of us” Cas then heard a voice from behind him, and he turned in his seat to welcome his friend. Balthazar sat down on the last empty chair, smiling at the two other men.
Castiel walked back into the living room, where Claire’s movie had ended and she now cuddled with her angel doll.
“Don’t be sad, Papa, we can buy some at the shop” she reassured him and earned a smile. Claire really was intelligent for her age. People often assumed she was older than she actually was. Cas wasn’t the only one proud of her.
“Jo?” he asked and when Cas nodded, he began to laugh. “God no! She’s my oldest and best friend! She’s the daughter of my uncle’s wife, who owns this bar. Jo and I have known each other since we were babies” he explained and Cas nodded. Dean didn’t trust the calm, though.
“I guess, this is a revelation that has a few of you surprised” the English teacher started, only to stop when Mr. Winchester guffawed next to him. An elbow to the gut stopped his laugh, however.
The girl nodded just when Dean heard a voice behind him.
“Well, I really had a nice evening, Cas. It was a good idea to suggest going out” Dean said when Cas opened his door. “I guess I’ll see you and Claire on Tuesday.”
“I’m telling you, only Mr. Novak could come up with a trip like this. I mean, yeah, learning about business models is important and useful, but why does it have to be at a scrap yard?! Aren’t there more reasonable choices?” Allison muttered while trudging along with the group. So far, she had taken notes on the different areas the yard was divided into: arrivals, demolition, spare parts and an area for sellable pieces and cars.
“Nice to see you again” Cas said to him and Dean looked at him, the smile now directed at the dark haired man.
“Yes, my dear Balthazar, I am wonderful, I know that. Keep telling me this, though, I like to hear myself confirmed” Gabe said with a grin, and Castiel could only shake his head. He didn’t know why he even associated himself with these men. They were eccentric and craved drama, completely different from the way he was himself.
Candace’s mouth dropped open when her teacher’s face broke out in a bright smile and he dropped down into a crouch and scooped up the little girl.
“Papa! Look who I brought with me! Did you see Emma on the swing? She is still so tiny, she can’t use the big girl swing, like I do, she had to take the baby swing, because she is a baby” Claire said, opening a flood gate of words towards her father.
While feeding Emma, Dean looked around at the rest of customers in the café. It was a Thursday afternoon, so it wasn’t too full, and the patrons all minded their own business, probably tired after a day of hard work, just at the shop to enjoy a cup of coffee or a slice of cake in peace and quiet.
“Well, I don’t know if you can really play with her, but you can try. There are a few toys in that bag” he motioned to one side of the mat, where a small bag was situated, “you just have to very careful with her, because like you know, she is still a baby” he explained to the girl and stood back up from where he had crouched in front of both his daughter and Claire. He watched Claire slowly edge closer to the baby on the ground, smiling tentatively, and holding out a stuffed bunny with overly long ears. Claire’s face brightened when Emma let out a squeal and grabbed for the animal. It was her favorite thing to chew on, so of course it had the desired effect.
“Hey Meg, I’d like to have a coffee for now. I think we’ll order food once Balth has arrived” he told the dark haired woman, smiling brightly. Meg had worked at the bar ever since the three men first started spending their time there every week, and she had become some sort of friend to him. She did have a fixation on calling him Clarence, though. Why, Castiel didn’t know.
“Sure, I’d love to give out my mediocre advice about being a girl’s single dad! Trust me, I’d have loved someone to tell me what to do when I first got Claire!” he said and handed Dean the paper to jot down a phone number. “Give me your number and I’ll give you a call, if that’s alright. Maybe we can meet up for coffee or something.” Dean nodded and did as he was told, handing back the paper and pen after writing down the digits.
“Well, I think it’s pretty obvious, Castiel. He didn’t say anything when you said you were gay, because he doesn’t have a problem with it. People only asks about things they are uncomfortable with or don’t know anything about. Obviously Dean neither had a problem with it nor is it new to him. I say he’s bi and definitely interested in you and this relationship that is starting to grow, because damn, if that get together doesn’t sound like a casual date then I don’t know what does” Gabe retorted, grinning brightly. Cas only shook his head and downed the rest of his coffee.
The man opened his front door quietly, trying to make as little noise as possible, so as to not wake up his daughter. He peeked into Claire’s bedroom, smiling when she saw her wrapped into her blankets with her arm around her angel doll. Cas closed the door again and then walked into the living room, where he found Anna curled up on the sofa watching one of her many favorite TV shows.
He woke again about an hour later to Emma gurgling loudly and fidgeting around in his arms. He stretched once and then took the baby upstairs to change her diapers and for himself to change into something a bit more appropriate than his sweatpants and old AC/DC shirt.
After only fifteen minutes Claire and Cas reached the one family home owned by Dean and saw him waiting in front of the porch, with Emma securely in her stroller. Claire let go of Cas’ hand and started running towards Dean, who grinned at her antics and held open his arms, ready for the impact of her running into him. The little girl wrapped her arms around Dean and he lifted her off the ground, leaving her hanging from him in the air, making the girl and her father laugh. Well, Castiel thought, he really didn’t have to worry about Claire not liking Dean, because that much was obvious. Still, there was nothing between them other than a friendship and mutual love for the other’s daughter.
“Impolite, Claire. And I am on my way. We still have enough time” Cas corrected her, chuckling at how eager the girl was to go out and meet the rest of their party. But Castiel couldn’t hold this behavior against his daughter, because she wasn’t the only one looking forward to meet the others. It had only been two days, and already Cas was missing the taller man. To be honest, Castiel wasn’t sure of feeling this strongly was a good or bad thing. He was swaying towards bad though, because 1) Castiel didn’t even know if Dean was interested, and 2) even if he was, it was way too early to feel this strongly about someone.
“As you might have combined, and I’m sure it’s a surprise for many of you, albeit not -”
“Alright Angel, let’s get you into your clothes and go home, okay?” he announced and Claire nodded and hopped from the couch and towards the room she had been sleeping in. Castiel helped the little girl into her dress and tights, then made to pick up all the things she had spread in the room. Castiel closed the overnight bag and took Claire’s hand and together they walked back towards the front room, where Gabe was leaning on the door jamb leading into the kitchen.
Dean motioned for Claire to get up and come closer to him, and when she did, he lifted her up to sit on his lap, so they could look at the menu together.
“Coming right up, Balth, but don’t be too sure about the rest I’ll give you. You never know with people” she said, grinning as well. With Meg it really was always fun and play. Castiel considered her a friend after the years of seeing her every week.
It wasn’t long until Dean’s shift ended, and the young man stepped back into the building to fetch his brother. The two made their way out together and towards Dean’s car, his beloved ’67 Chevy Impala. Dean had put time and money into his car, his baby, and it was his prized possession. Before Emma, his car had been the light of his eye, his most favorite thing in the world. The impala wasn’t just a car, it was a character of its own.
“My publisher. They are just too demanding! I’m not a machine, I can’t just produce something to fit their needs. I need a muse to get inspiration” he moaned, letting his head fall back in desperation. Balthazar was a writer, but he wasn’t doing all that well. He had writer’s block more often than he hadn’t. In the years Castiel had known the English man, he had only published two books. Which wasn’t much for almost ten years. They had met in college, both studying history as one of their subjects.
“But you want to get to know him really well, don’t you, Cas? You want to get to know him inside and out!” Balth continued where Gabe left off. Castiel scowled in the blonde’s direction.
“I guess we know now why Mr. Winchester’s taking that sabbatical, huh? That ‘personal matter’ seems to be that bouncing baby strapped to his oh so muscular chest” Brandon stated drily.
“Alright, Angel, be good to your aunt, and sleep tightly later” he said, accepting the embrace from his little girl, as well as the slightly sloppy kiss to the corner of his mouth.
“Well, someone is happy to see me!” Castiel said, taking Emma’s hand in his larger one, grinning when her little fingers closed around his thumb.
“Just a moment, sweetheart, your bottle will be done in a moment” he soothed his daughter, stroking her soft cheek with his index finger, trying to shift Emma’s focus from her hunger to his motions. Dean was still glad when the barista arrived with his coffee and the now warm baby bottle. Emma eagerly started drinking, breathing deeply through her nose. Dean loved watching the little girl being this comfortable and happy.
“Yes, but you don’t need one anymore now, do you? You’re a big girl now” he said and Claire nodded greatly.
“You have to go to the bathroom?” he asked, not even waiting for an answer from the secretary. Claire nodded eagerly, and Castiel was already making to say his good bye to the woman on the phone when Dean stood up, looking at Castiel.
“Thank you Papa! But now I have to change Dolly, or else her clothes will get dirty in the sand box” she said and moved to her doll chest at the end of her bed.
“Bye bye Uncle Gabe! I had fun with you, even if we didn’t bake cupcakes!” the little girl said, moving out of Castiel’s grasp and hugged her uncle tight.
Looking at the alarm clock on his bedside table, Dean was surprised it was almost 6:30 already. He’d have to get a move on, finding shoes and a jacket, so he’d be at Cas’ place in time. This wasn’t any sort of a date, but he still didn’t want to seem rude and be late.
“I love you, Jess, do you know that?” he said to her and received a whack across the head.
Candace’s head whipped around so fast, she thought she might actually have hurt her neck. She knew that voice - in fact, it had had a starring role in a few of her more ‘nsfw’ dreams.
Together the four walked through the park, Claire holding onto the seam of Dean’s shirt instead of the stroller. They sat down at a table on the café’s terrace. Claire sat down between the two men and looked at Emma in her father’s arms.
“Yes, sometimes she’s a bit clingy, but only with people she likes, so I guess you are in her good books” Cas said, making Dean smile even wider. He set the girl back on the ground and turned to look at his own daughter in her carrier, where she was happily gurgling along to everything she was hearing and was sucking on her pacifier while her hands grabbed both her feet.
When Dean opened the front door of his little house, his face lit up hearing his daughter babble in the living room. He started walking a little faster and soon came face to face with his mother cradling the little girl and talking to her, pausing from time to time to let Emma ‘answer’. When Mary noticed she was being watched, she turned to the door and smiled, standing up and walking over to her sons.
“Bye Claire, enjoy your cookies!” he said and made the girl smile with his words.
The three made their way up the stairs, Dean making sure Claire held onto the banister tightly, and walked through the hallway towards the bathroom next to Emma’s nursery. It wasn’t a large bathroom, but it would be the one for his girl once she got older.
“I will” Cas replied, smiling at the man waiting in the door. He opened the driver’s side of the car, but stopped and lifted his hand in good bye before entering the car. Dean copied the motion and waited to go back inside until Cas had backed out his car from the drive way and turned into the street.
“Okay, I guess. It’s a bit stressful lately, what with graduation approaching, but other than that it’s good. Lately all my students are really into what I teach, so it’s easier to get them to work” Cas explained. He loved his work, but sometimes his students could be the death of him. “What about you? Any cool cars you had to fix up?” It was his time to look at Dean now.
“You’re visiting grandma? And what, did you walk from home all alone?” Mr. Novak asked, all serious, but then looked up to review his surroundings.
“I already said yes, you don’ have to beg any further” Dean replied, grinning brightly at Ellen when she handed over his coffee, along with a slice of cherry pie. Dean loved pie, to him, there was nothing better. Especially Ellen’s pie. Ellen was the owner of the Roadhouse, a well known diner in their town, and Dean used to spend a lot of time there in his late teens and early twenties, picking up men and women almost every weekend. He also met Emma’s mother there.
“Come on, Papa! We can’t be late, it’s unpolite!” Claire exclaimed when she saw her father wasn’t moving towards the entrance door of their apartment, even though she was already dressed and ready to go.
“You have no idea how easy your life is, princess. Daddy is having a bad case of nerves, you know that? And it’s really stupid for Daddy to be this nervous, because nothing is going to happen” Dean picked her up and held her in the air above his head, making her squeal in delight. He then lowered Emma back down, burying his face in her neck, breathing in and placing a kiss on her chubby cheek. Dean was ready to be called a sap for this, but he loved his daughter like it was nobody’s business.
“I love you, too, Claire” Castiel said in good bye and turned out of the bedroom.
With a sigh at his stupidity not to ask about this, Dean pulled out his phone and scrolled through his contacts. He had saved Cas’ cell phone number after he had called that Thursday, just in case something came up. Like it was right now. It rand twice before the call was accepted.
“Nothing specific. He just said it was a personal matter and he would be back next year. Much good that’s gonna do us!”
“It’s alright, I can carry her. I don’t want her to wake up” he said and motioned for Claire to hold onto the stroller, so she wouldn’t run off. Cas didn’t see the smile Dean gave him. Had he seen it, he would have known what he thought about Dean being not interested in him were wrong.
“Yeah, see you on Saturday” Cas replied, taking Claire’s hand into his.
“I’m going out for drinks with a friend” Dean explained, not mentioning the fact that he and Cas had only met about two weeks ago and that he had really weird feeling for the dark haired man. Feelings that shouldn’t be there yet, not after only two weeks.
The two walked out the diner and to the Impala, getting in at the same time. They drove in silence until Dean got up the nerve to ask Castiel out again.
In that moment Castiel heard the voice of his daughter nearing again, and he turned to see Claire talking animatedly to Dean, skipping along next to him. Castiel had to admit, seeing Dean care for his daughter so sweetly made him even more attractive, but the man quickly shook that thought out of his head. He shouldn’t think like that about someone he barely knew.
“Whatever, Gabriel” Castiel dismissed his brother, still not believing what the older man had said. There was no way Dean was interested even in the slightest. They were becoming friends, nothing more, nothing less.
“Well, how about we wait here together until your Papa arrives, alright?” Dean asked, trying to reassure the little girl, who seemed to get a little unnerved with not finding her father near her.
Together the two made their way down the road and towards where Dean lived with Emma. It really was surprising how close they lived to each other. Cas hadn’t realized it while driving to the house the other day, because basically everything in their town was quickly reached by car, but walking the distance made him realize that it wasn’t a real distance after all.
It was as if the time flew by, and before they knew it, it was nearing midnight. Knowing he had to be up at lunch the next day, Dean suggested paying and leaving. He could see Cas trying to hide a yawn, so he
“Do you want to help me get Emma ready for bed?” he asked and his heart swelled when he saw the look of complete happiness in Claire’s face.
“Drive carefully, okay?” he said, standing in the doorway and watching Cas maneuver Claire into her seat without waking up.
From her perch she could see her two teachers talking a little ways away. Mr. Novak was standing close to Mr. Winchester, leaning into the slightly taller man and looking intently at the baby in the carrier. The little girl was hanging off Mr. Winchester’s arm, swinging around like a little monkey.
“That’s Emma, my daughter” he explained and Claire nodded, eyes wide. It seemed she had never been close to such a little child before.
“Ah, yes, I guess I forgot to tell you my apartment number. Well, anyways, I’m right out, just a minute” Cas replied, laughing slightly, at himself or Dean the man outside didn’t know.
“This is a dump.” Candace muttered as she stepped off the bus, but made her way over to the rest of the class that had gathered around the porch of the main building in a semi-circle around an older guy with a frown etched onto his face.
“Yes, you, too. When I saw Claire I asked her if she was alone again, but she showed me you were right there” he said and sat down on Cas’ other side. He lifted Emma back out of her seat in the stroller and settled her in his arms. Castiel looked at the little girl with the large eyes, who was currently very engrossed in the rattle she still had in her tiny hands.
“Mr. Winchester!”
Claire was the result of a desperate try of Castiel’s father to bring out the straight man in him. He had set up the blind date with the woman, a lovely woman, really, hoping she would be able to sway Castiel from his in his opinion wrong ways of being homosexual. Castiel had ended up getting drunk with her, both quickly realizing that there wouldn’t
“Not with her mother?” Dean asked before he could stop himself. He didn’t want to ask, but at the same time really wanted to know. Castiel frowned at the mention of Claire’s mother.
The men continued to talk some more, asking questions about the girls playing next to them. They didn’t stray from that topic, though, Dean deeming it relatively safe territory. Of course he was curious to know about Claire’s mother, but he doubted it was appropriate to ask something like that the first real time they met. It wasn’t his business and he wouldn’t urge anyone to talk about something they didn’t want to. He didn’t want to talk about Emma’s mother either, so why should Cas?
“Well, she’s good. Can’t stop talking about Emma though” Cas relented. He liked talking about his daughter. He hadn’t thought about his answer though, because right then the conversation was steered into a direction Cas didn’t actually want it to go.
“Hello?” he heard the strangely already very familiar voice of Castiel answer. Dean let out the breath he hadn’t known he had been holding.
“Good morning, Cassie, come in!” Gabriel greeted the other man and made way for Cas to step inside.
In that moment Emma began to move around in her father’s grasp again, starting to make sounds of discomfort. Dean sighed and looked down at his daughter, downing the last remains of his now lukewarm coffee and stood up.
The bus slowed and turned on to a property at the outskirts of town. The main building was a dilapidated wooden structure, flanked on all sides by towering heaps of scrap metal and bent out of shape cars.
Dean set Emma down in a support cushion he always kept in the bathroom and set the mini tub into the larger one, turning on the water and adjusting the temperature.
“Well, you seem to know everyone here!” Cas said once they were left alone again and Dean nodded. It really seemed like that to an outsider.
“Well, I think I will take this little one up and to bed before our dinner is ready” he announced and walked around the table towards Claire. “Say good night, Emma” he said with a smile, holding the baby close to the little girl. Claire giggled and pressed a light kiss to the baby’s puffy cheek. Dean then walked over to Cas at the stove, holding Emma close to him as well. “Good night, Cas!”
“Alright then, Cassie, what’s been going on with you? Anything new?” Gabriel asked once the woman was gone, and Cas shrugged. He didn’t really want to tell Gabriel about his budding friendship with Dean yet. He didn’t even know if there was anything to tell. And Gabriel would only tease him about having a crush on someone he didn’t even really know yet. Which would not at all be true. Castiel didn’t have a crush on Dean. Right?
Were Mr. Novak, crazy, awkward and socially inept Mr. Novak, and amazing, goofy and super popular Mr. Winchester actually a couple? And not just that? They were parents? This was seriously the last thing she had every thought would be true!
“What do you work as?” Cas changed the subject, and Dean could have kissed him for it. Apparently it was clear that Dean didn’t want to talk about what had happened.
So it was no wonder that Claire couldn’t wait to be picked up after day care on Tuesday. She didn’t even have to be notified of her father’s arrival, because as soon as Castiel had opened the door to the playroom Claire was in, she leaped up from where she had sat at the colouring table and ran towards him, taking his hand and pulled him towards the shoe and coat rack.
Castiel watched his daughter interacting with the man and baby they had met the week before, pointing back to where he sat after talking for a moment, probably to reassure the man that she wasn’t alone in the park. Dean turned to look at him and lifted a hand in greeting, which Cas reciprocated.
“Yes. Emma was six weeks old when her mother decided she didn’t want to be bound to a family after all and packed her bags. She came back a week later to get the rest of her things and that’s about it. I have seen her in court twice now, because I still haven’t full custody, only temporarily, but she isn’t at all interested in my princess. It was hard at first, I had to stop working from one day to the other, but somehow everything is working out so far” Dean explained, downing half of his glass after finishing. He could really use a whiskey now. He wasn’t upset about being left anymore, no, it was the fact that Emma’s mother didn’t care in the slightest about the girl that made Dean furious.
Like Dean had said, he showed where everything was in the kitchen, telling Cas to take whatever he needed for dinner. He then turned to Claire and smiled at her.
“Yes, sure, I’m not picky” he said, walking over to the fridge and pulled out a premade bottle of formula for Emma. He heated it up with water quickly, then settled at the table, resting Emma in his arms. He could see Claire watching his every move from where she sat opposite him.
“Yeah, she really is cute, and that right there is the usual reaction we get whenever anyone sees her. It helps that she is a pretty friendly little girl, and almost always grins” Dean said, and as if to prove his point, Emma started giggling and reached her arms towards the dark haired man sitting next to her father. She wiggled in her father’s grasp, demanding to be passed over to the other man. Cas received her without hesitation and grinned himself when the little girl snuggled into his side and patted the man’s cheeks with her little hands.
“That’s alright, there was no harm done. I just wanted to make sure she was alright after she fell down” Dean reassured the man. In that moment he saw Claire’s eyes drift from her father’s face to the little girl sitting in the carrier, babbling along to what she heard the adults say and still gripping Dean’s finger.
“Well, it really just started as a joke from my brother. All my siblings and I are named after angels, Castiel, Annael, Gabriel, Michael. And Claire wasn’t. So Gabriel one day bought an angel plush doll for Claire. It was her favorite toy of all time. She still has it in her bed every night. She always chewed on the angel’s wings. I guess it just kind of stuck, calling her angel, so she could be an angel, too.” He explained and chuckled. Dean had to laugh, too. He looked over and saw his daughter with one ear of the bunny in her mouth.
So yes, Cas would tap that, not that that would ever happen. Dean might be a single father, but what were the chances of there ever happening anything between them? One in a million, for sure!
“Hey Balth, what can I get you?” she asked, her voice slightly snarky, the way she always spoke to Balthazar. Castiel wasn’t really sure, but he had the suspicion there had been going on something between the two of them.
In that moment Meg arrived with Cas’ coffee, and she smiled at the new guest at the table.
When Dean was back inside, he sat down on the couch and sighed. He really would have liked to hug Cas in good bye.
“She’s tiny, like a baby” she said, making Dean and her father erupt in laughter.
“Wow, Angel, you are almost as tall as the trees!” Cas replied to her, laughing when Claire nodded and grinned some more.
“I said no” he said. When Dean looked puzzled, he elaborated. “The last time she had chocolate milk was at my brother’s place. I don’t know why, but whenever she drinks it, she gets completely hyperactive and has a sugar rush she won’t come down from for hours. She didn’t sleep the entire night!” he said and Dean nodded.
“I won’t tell if you won’t” Dean called after her, resulting in Jessica turning and pulling her tongue at him. She then left to give the order to the kitchen staff.
Dean quickly finished the slice of pie and emptied his coffee, then stood back up.
“Hey there! I hope we aren’t late” Castiel greeted the man and pushed Claire forward into the house once Dean had moved aside to let them through. He grinned brightly at the little girl in Dean’s arms and stroked over her cheek tenderly. Dean saw Emma’s eyes go wide for a second, but then her face erupted in a smile and she squealed in delight, stretching her arms slightly in Castiel’s direction.
“Mr. Winchester and … Mr. Novak?”
“Yes, I told him what happened with me and Claire’s mother, and I told him I was gay, but he didn’t even react to it! I would have expected at least a bit of a reaction, but nothing! We just continued talking as if I didn’t say anything. And then, on the way home, he asked if I’d like to meet on Tuesday with the girls to go to the playground and maybe to a café later” Cas explained. He really didn’t know what to make of Dean and his behavior. He could not see through him at all, and normally he was really good at reading people.
Candace continued watching her teachers, who, in turn, were giving their students a once over. Apparently, Candace and her friend group weren’t the only students watching the adults in their midst.
“Well, opposites attract, I guess.”
“She’s strong!” she exclaimed, looking at Dean. The man nodded.
“Well, that’s a very cute nickname, too. I don’t really think there is a rulebook of choosing nicknames, anyways. You can call me Cas, by the way, everyone does” Castiel reasoned, nodding along to his words.
“Naah, that’s alright, I’m not too tired. I also don’t have any clothes here, so I’d have to leave tomorrow morning to get changed, and you know I’m not a morning person, so getting up even earlier than usual? No thank you” she said and grinned. She shook her head to get even the last bit of tiredness out of her body, her red hair surrounding her face like a halo.
Like his mother had said, a new number was saved in his phone and he lifted the receiver to his ear, suddenly very nervous. He didn’t know why, though. It wasn’t as if anything was happening between him and Castiel, he didn’t even really know the man.
Castiel climbed the few steps leading up to the building’s entrance, opening the door he stepped through and into the acclimatized hallway leading to all the different class rooms for the children who were divided into little groups.
“Just think about what I said, Cassie. Only because you don’t think it’s the truth, doesn’t mean it’s not true. Just be open minded okay? It will work out, I’m sure” he said, staying cryptic because of the girl beside them. As much as Claire understood for her age, she didn’t have to be bombarded with things that she shouldn’t know about yet.
“Yes, Papa, I know. Auntie Anna and I are going to read this book together before sleeping” she said, smiling at her father. The look in Claire’s eyes made Castiel calm down. He was really overreacting. Like Anna had said, this wasn’t the first time he left Claire in her care.
“I don’t have a crush, I barely know the guy” he said, not exactly lying, at least not about all of it. He really barely knew Dean.
“Well we won’t have to walk too far anymore. You think you’ll be alright?” he further asked, and was met with another sigh.
“So, how was last night? Did you get it on? Did the dirty?” Gabriel asked as soon as both men had a cup of coffee standing in front of them. Castiel scowled at his brother’s crass words.
“What are you up to tonight to need a babysitter?” John Winchester asked while smiling at his wife in thanks for the coffee.
Before he started getting ready for the night out with Cas, he quickly picked up around his house. He had been in a bit of a rush while packing Emma’s overnight bag, so he hadn’t had the time to clean up the mess left in the kitchen from feeding the girl her lunch as well as her play area in the living room. Dean could only imagine what big messes his daughter would make once she would be able to walk or crawl and get into all kinds of places. The older the child the bigger the mess it would seem to be.
Twenty minutes later, the presentation on the scrap metal trade was finally over. Candace was looking forward to getting to move around, even if it was a scrap yard.
“Claire, can you bring me a towel? They are in that cabinet over there, but be careful with your fingers when you close the drawer” he asked the little girl and Claire eagerly shuffled over to where Dean had pointed.
“Just imagine Mr. Winchester working on one of these rusty pieces of crap. All sweaty and dirty, I bet he would make an excellent grease monkey!” Allison whispered into her friend’s ear, and Candace immediately burned up around her cheeks. She did not need a visual like that!
“Great, then I’ll see you on Saturday, alright?” Dean asked once more, and when Cas nodded, he grinned as well. He pulled the stroller closer to him and peered into the carrier, slightly shaking his head when he saw Emma was still sleeping. She really was a sleeper.
“Okay Papa. Can we go to the playground today?” she asked, nodding along to her words. Claire really was the best in changing the subject to suit her needs.
“Oh, yeah, I remember Claire being around that age. She hadn’t ever been a really difficult child, but she became a lot more vocal around that age. I’m sure Emma will be babbling and talking to you in no time” Cas said, looking at Claire on his other side, who was now trying to open her drink bottle. When she struggled, he took the bottle from her and unscrewed the lid, then handing it back to her.
“Mrs Goldstein can you please hold a moment?” he said in the phone and then looked at his daughter.
“Yes, maybe you are right. Anyways, it’s getting late and it’s a work day tomorrow. Do you want to stay here for the night? I don’t want you to drive home if you’re too tired” Cas asked, sitting up straight again. Anna got off the couch as well, stretching her arms over her head.
“Yes, hey, it’s Dean. I’m standing in front of your building, but I have no idea what your door bell is” Dean admitted, feeling slightly stupid, as if he was back in high school and on his first date with someone he really liked. But this wasn’t a date. He didn’t even know if Cas was into men, it had never come up. Why should it?!
In the end Dean settled for a button down open over a shirt and jeans. Casual was the look for the evening. He then walked back into the bathroom to dry and style his hair, as well as put on some cologne.
“Nice car” he remarked when he was inside, stroking over the smooth leather of the dash of the black car.
“Angel, have you been to the bathroom already?” he asked and Claire stopped hopping around.
“I’ll have to keep that in mind. What’s with the nickname, anyways? Why angel?” Dean asked further, starting slightly to feel like a really weird stalker, wanting to know so much about the little girl. Castiel didn’t seem to feel that way, though, because he eagerly delivered an answer.
“No, she’s not old enough to have waffles. That’s food for big girls and grown-ups, Claire” he explained and Claire nodded. A waitress arrived at their table and gave them two menus, then left again with a big smile on her face. To outsiders they really looked like a happy family.
“Cas, that’s Jessica, my brother’s girlfriend. Jess, that’s Cas” Dean explained further and grinned when Castiel smiled at the waitress. It seemed he wasn’t threatened by her. If he even was feeling threatened with Jo. Maybe Dean was just interpreting way too much into Cas’ antics.
At four o’clock in the afternoon that Saturday, Dean pulled up in front of his childhood home. He got out of the Impala and rounded the car to open the door on the passenger side. He unhooked the baby carrier from its base and set it on the ground, Emma sitting in it, smiling and chewing on the ear of her bunny. He then grabbed the diaper bag he had packed with his daughter’s belongings needed for the night she
“Yeah Dean, call if you need someone to look after Emma because you need some alone time with your new boyfriend” Sam teased again, but shut up when he saw his mother’s look directed at him. Dean stood up with them and led them to the door, waving them off when they backed out of the drive way in his mother’s Honda.
Castiel would be lying if he said he didn’t find Dean physically attractive. The man stood even taller than his own 6’ frame, even though only by a bit. Dean had broad shoulders and an all round well built. His facial features, Castiel had noticed in the grocery store, had been both soft and strongly defined at the same time, something he hadn’t ever seen on anyone else before. But the most prominent feature in his face was undeniably his eyes, these bright green eyes. Castiel couldn’t say he had ever seen anyone with eyes like that.
“Oops” she simply said and turned on the spot, quickly running towards the bathroom. Castiel shook his head. Claire always forgot to go to the bathroom before they left the house, so it had become a routine to ask her this question every day. He was glad Claire was out of her diaper days and relatively secure in going to the toilet already. It was only on special occasions, like long drives with the car, that she needed a diaper, and even then it was only as a security net, incase their wasn’t a toilet as close as needed.
“I hope it’s alright I picked her up. She was starting to get a bit fussy” Castiel explained as soon as Dean and Claire where back at his side. Dean just smiled and took his daughter from Castiel, kissing her cheek before settling her against his chest.
The group of teenagers shifted their attention from their private conversation to the teacher at the front of the bus. Mr. Novak wore his usual shirt and tie combination, but also wore a tan overcoat with it. You know, one of those flasher coats. Not the best choice.
Castiel would be lying if he said he hadn’t been surprised by her arrival. He hadn’t expected to see Claire’s mother that one fateful afternoon in front of his door. She had carried Claire in her arms, along with a bag of necessities, as well as a signed paper giving away any custodial rights she had had. She had handed the baby over to the shocked father, put down the bag, and turned on her heels, leaving.
“This is probably gonna be the most boring field trip ever” Candace grouched from where she was sitting in the back row of the smelly school bus. Next to her, her friend Allison nodded.
“I’ll have someone get Claire. She’s been obsessed with her baby doll today. Wouldn’t lay her down, not even during lunch or nap time. She said she had to be fed and lain down as well, because she was a baby and tiny” Ms Parker explained and Castiel grinned. He knew what the teacher meant. Claire had done nothing but play house with her baby doll since the moment she had been home after the last Thursday and meeting Dean and Emma. Claire was convinced her Dolly was her baby now and needed all her attention.
“Yeah, that’s a great idea. Come on, I’ll show you where everything is in the kitchen” he answered, picking up Emma from the ground and helping Claire up to her feet, then ushering her in front of him towards the kitchen.
