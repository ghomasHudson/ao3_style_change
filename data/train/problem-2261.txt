, the amount those two fight. And there’s no in-between either - it’s either Sherlock-and-Rosie like they’re joined at the hip, talking philosophy and science and literature in a mad mishmash of seven different languages - Rosie maintains that it’s impossible to discuss poetry in anything but French, and Sherlock is firm that Arabic is the only suitable language to discuss philosophy, although he’s willing to give German the occasional go - or it’s screaming matches in the sitting room and throwing things.
“It was…a complicated situation,” John says carefully. “I was very confused. Remember I already loved Sherlock - I’ve always loved him, since the day we met -, but I was married to your mother, and it seemed easier, I guess. To tell myself it was his fault, because I already felt so guilty because…”
Before John, I hated feeding. I would delay and delay and delay, until my pale skin turned grey and my too-thin face turned skeletal, until even Lestrade flinched from the red glow in my pupils and my teeth began to misbehave, until I found myself staring at Anderson’s throat and licking my lips. It wasn’t that I was I didn’t want to feed. I wanted to,
He tells the story, the whole story, the lies and the cover-ups and Magnussen, and eventually he comes to Mary’s death. They’re both crying a bit by then.
“It’s not about the case,” Sherlock says, and a moment later the cab is pulling up in front of an incredibly posh restaurant with floor-to-ceiling glass windows, and Sherlock pays the cabby and hops out. He stops John from following. “Pick me up around the corner in ten,” he says, and strides toward the doors.
She laughs and puts an arm around his shoulder, which earns them a stern look from Sherlock.
girlfriends. All of whom seem to know each other, and none of whom seem to hate him. Some of whom call him Holmes, while others call him Sherl.
She does glance at him then, the same unsure glance from the corner of the eye that Sherlock always gives, when he knows what he’s said is not-good, but isn’t quite sure how badly it’s going to be received.
His desire and mine are entwined now, my mind opening to his even as my body does. I am both fucking and fucked, in this moment, I am John and myself, penetrating and penetrated, and when John finally,
And now John is
The room seems to be terribly wide, suddenly, and Sherlock very far. He’s still watching John’s approach with narrowed eyes, but he drops his arms as John comes closer.
Rosie sucks in a breath.
“Had another fight with Rosie, then?” he asks, because it’s
When the blunt head of his cock breaches me I sink my teeth into my bottom lip to keep from screaming. I am invaded, I am
“And the Victor Trevor thing?” John finally asks. “Boyfriend, I’m guessing? Didn’t know about Sherlock’s white knight tendencies?”
Mycroft sits and studies his brother.
It’s not hard to deduce where Rosie is. He hasn’t spent twenty years following Sherlock Holmes through London without learning a thing or two, after all, and it’s only about ten minutes before he finds her, sitting on a park bench watching the ducks.
“Well?” Sherlock asks, not looking up. “If it’s George, tell him I’ll let him know as soon as I find something and not to bother me until he’s found the feet.”
“Claire,” John says. “Hi.”
But I am not a mortal man, and so John takes his devotion southward, trailing fire across my chest, across my nipples which peak for him, begging for his mouth, which he bestows in abundance. He trails kisses along my inner arms and suckles on the tender inside of my wrist, and I make a wailing sound that’s almost a sob, because I am burning up, I am made up of desire and smoke, and there is nothing in the world but John.
Sherlock punches him in the face repeatedly and nearly strips John on the spot to check for wounds.
Sherlock is sitting up now, looking…well, a bit shocked, but that’s to be expected when one moment you’re talking to your brother about feelings and the next you’ve got an army doctor in his forties stripping naked and plopping himself in your lap.
“Dad,” she says. “I think Sherlock needs to adopt me.”
? Who is Sherlock
people’s parties could probably be heard around the world, since he’d leave with a piper’s trail of pretty girls looking for a safe place to sleep it off.
What the hell.
“Sherlock, please. This is not a game, and I could not have told you the full truth. Not then, and certainly not in front of John. Will you listen?” Mycroft waits for Sherlock’s reluctant nod before continuing. “You did not erase your memory of Eurus. Eurus did that herself, and in the process, she did something else to you, something that the best minds in the world have not been able to understand or undo. By the time we realised how she had blinded you, the effects had sunk in and you were actively resisting any attempt to undo it.”
It takes five minutes for Mycroft to get his emotions under control and he gets back to his feet, and turns to face the fireplace/
John sits there for a moment, trying to put ‘goes around rescuing women from creepers’ together with ‘high-functioning sociopath’ and coming up with ‘Sherlock is a goddamn liar’. Also apparently gay as a rainbow, which means that John probably still has a chance of maybe, someday, getting to kiss that long neck and maybe, if he’s very, very lucky, bite that plush arse.
And it might have amused them later to learn that they are thinking the exact same thing at the exact same moment.
“It’s not Greg,” John says. “It just says ‘Botany Bay, Violet’, and an address.”
I come to a stop on the thirteenth step to 221B. Sherlock is having an argument with someone and although I’d love to be able to pretend that I’m giving my friend some privacy, I’m really not. It’s just that steps fourteen through seventeen squeak abominably and unpredictably, and I’ve always been a bit of a nosy parker. I know this about myself, and I’ve accepted it. So step thirteen is the best place to stand, if I want to…okay, if you’re going to be like that,
“I had no idea you even still knew that,” Mycroft muses. “I thought you’d deleted it. Like sex, and the solar system.”
Through the window, he watches as Sherlock fluffs up his hair, pulls up his coat, and takes a deep breath before going in.
But I am not a mortal man, so John takes the lube from my shaking hands and keeps one hand over my unbeating heart, as I gasp for breath I don’t need (except I do need it, need the oxygen like a drug, or so my brain keeps telling me) and open my legs so he can settle between them.
It’s like watching a silent movie, really. Sherlock falls to his knees right there in the restaurant, and John can see the pleading expression on his face from the cab. The woman’s shoulders fall and she reaches out to take his hand.
to me.”
“It might not be,” Mycroft says.
“And if you think that’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve thought about in relation to you, Sherlock, you need to have another think,” I say, and I’m taking off my jumper and my shirt and my shoes. “Two minutes before that I was having thoughts about doing obscene things to your toes, because they’re ridiculous and every time I see them my mouth begins to water. And when you come over all clever I have to tell you, Sherlock, it does
“Mmm, no you haven’t,” Sherlock says. “She works with Grace, I think.”
So when we reach the door to 221B, much as I’d like to, I don’t run straight to the refrigerator, I don’t guzzle down a pint of blood and glut myself on John, on his skin and his touch and his living breathing presence (although I have, in the past, and will again). Instead, I strip myself, revealing my milk-pale skin to his watching eyes, and run a bath. I want to be clean for him. There are candles, and so I light them, admiring the golden highlights they bring to my marble flesh, and I lean back, letting the water seep its warmth into my cool skin.
. Sebastian Wilkes despised Sherlock because after spending quite a lot of money on dinner and ‘improved’ drinks, his date had glanced across the room at Sherlock, caught a shake of his head, and dumped his soup in his lap. The groans and cries of despair when Sherlock showed up at
Sherlock is staring at me over his own shoulder, looking absolutely bewildered.
“Sherlock, are you
Mycroft sighs heavily and takes something out of his breast pocket. A long, thin stick, which he waves in the air. Between their two chairs, a small table appears, bearing a tea service and several small, delicious cakes.
I needed to, and I loved everything about it, except what came after. It was…unbearable. The heightened senses, the visceral awareness. The need to touch, almost as urgent as the need for blood, that came upon me; the euphoria that left me empty and aching and alone, shaking myself to pieces in an empty bed with every inch of my skin screaming for something I couldn’t put a name to.
. He pets my thigh with one hand and with the other, with the other-
Thinking is overrated.
Sherlock growls and there’s a sound – possibly he’s thrown a pillow. So, they’re talking about me then, unless Sherlock is in the habit of going around telling people that he has a girl’s name. Which I wouldn’t put past him, it’d be mad enough, but I doubt it. It makes me feel better about the eavesdropping. Not that I was feeling guilty about it before, you understand…oh, shut up. And stop looking at me like that, you’re a skull, what do you know.
“Up to her,” he says. “Now be quiet, I’m trying to think.”
“Piss off, Mycroft,” I snap. He pats my shoulder as he passes me, and I resist the urge to break his fingers. I have to think quickly now, because if I let Sherlock come to the wrong conclusion, I’ll probably never see him again. The door clicks closed behind Mycroft, and I take a breath.
“Darling, you’re an idiot. John, come sit down. Sherlock, go away.” Sherlock went across the room, where he stood against the wall glaring at John.
, whiting out my vision on every stroke of his cock inside me. I can feel him inside me, feel the clench of my muscles around him, feel his pleasure building with the force of his thrusts until I am forced to fumble both hands up to clutch the headboard before my head hits it. Every thrust
And he points at a book and watches it float into the air.
She speaks before he can.
, and don’t know what I was thinking.”
It’s the third time that convinces him that something else is going on, something beyond the usual weirdness of his life. Twice is coincidence and three times is a pattern, and the third time is really quite spectacular. The third time it happens, Sherlock is at the park with Rosie, teaching her deductions she’s still too young to understand, and he’s buying her an ice-cream and when he turns around there’s someone trying to unbuckle her from the pram. A moment later the man hits a tree twenty feet away with a wet crack like a falling coconut and slithers boneless to the ground.
And after Wilkes, John had rather had the idea that Sherlock was not exactly the most popular bloke in class. Which, alright, if Sherlock was sleeping with every attractive woman in the vicinity back then, actually makes quite a bit of sense.
“He thought he’d killed her. Hell, I thought he’d killed her. I know better now, but he…well. Sherlock’s always been very willing to believe the worst of himself.”
“What’s so funny?” John hisses.
“I know, yes,” Mycroft confirms. “As for expecting this? Hardly. I could say that I have…hoped, desperately, that this would happen one day, but I’m not entirely sure that the word covers enough ground in this case.”
overwhelms, every breath he exhales against my skin makes me shake and shudder, and if I were a mortal man I would be coming right now, just from this.
Mycroft sighs. His put-upon sighs are also an experience, it’s like the concentrated frustration of a thousand frustrated mothers, all condensed into one gust of hot air. And now I can hear him sitting down. Is he sitting in- he is! The bloody tit is sitting in
“And you read it?”
Sherlock still looks horrified, and Mycroft wonders if he should continue.
“Okay, go,” John says, but he keeps watching as the fascinated cabbie pulls away ever so slowly.  So he doesn’t miss the way Sherlock pulls her to her feet and they run, light-footed, to the door where, silhouetted against the restaurant light, they kiss passionately.
The first woman sees them, smiles broadly, and comes over to kiss Sherlock on the cheek. A second woman sees, and does the same. Pretty soon women on the other side of the room are deserting their dates in order to talk to Sherlock, touch Sherlock, hug him, and kiss his cheeks. And Sherlock is…accepting this? John watches, awestruck, as Sherlock hugs woman after woman after woman, smiles at them with crinkly eyes and all and kisses more cheeks than a politician. He’s asking about their husbands! Okay, admittedly he actually gets more than half of their husbands’ names wrong, but that’s par for the course, and they just smile at him about it.
“I’m not upset!” John protests. She raises a perfect eyebrow. “I’m just…confused. About…all that. Sherlock is just so…Sherlock. And…well, I’m confused. How on earth has he got that many women to…”
“No, I’ve studied your anatomy textbooks, and I know where that scar of yours is - I’ve seen it. She was trying to kill you. And if she had - if I’d never known you…God, Sherlock, my life would have been so empty. Do you understand what I’m saying?”
“You need to tell him, Sherlock. This…manly pining…thing you are doing, it’s not healthy.”
“What case?”
"No need, I'm fine," I lie.
Greg kisses me again and now I'm truly despairing. Maybe I am broken. There is no reaction whatsoever.
"Sherlock, darling!" Mrs. Holmes bustles up the path, grabbing her son and kissing him on both cheeks since his hands are full. "Oh, and John!" He gets a kiss too. "And you must be the Detective Inspector who Sherlock helps on cases! Lestrade, wasn't it?" she asks, shaking his hand.
"I understand that your biology is probably making you want to have me within sight all the time right now," John comforts, "but Sherlock, we have no food in the flat, and my biology will not allow my Omega to starve for any reason whatsoever, crazed bombers be d**ned."
“No.”
This is what encourages him to tell John, "Downstairs. Take her downstairs and look after her." John pulls Sherlock into a toe-curling kiss, then demands, "You going to tell me what's going on?" as Mrs. Hudson goes down the stairs. "I expect so, now go," Sherlock mock-scolds. John clumps downstairs without further complaint.
"How generous of you," John comments as he lavishes kisses along Sherlock's collarbone. "I love you. Everything about you. I love your belly," he swoops down and kisses Sherlock's abdomen, then laves it with his tongue, "and I adore the way you're round with my children. I love your scars, they show how strong you are," a lot of time is then dedicated to kissing each scar, leaving no doubt in Sherlock's mind that he means it, "and I love your mind. So much. You're brilliant, and I love that about you. I love that you solve crimes, and I love that you're the world's only Consulting Detective."
“Maybe,” is the dubious response.
"Why?"
"Guys, this is my mother," I say proudly, pulling her out from behind me. She smiles tentatively at the two Alphas.
"He's the socially awkward one," Jim tells his soulmate. He calls for his pack, who both come running.
"I'm sorry," he says quietly. I'm too busy trying to control my breathing to respond. Molly crawls up onto the sofa with me, taking one of my hands and patting it gently, whispering softly in my ear. I can't understand what she's saying, but the tone is soothing and I quickly calm.
“Fine,” Sherlock huffs, annoyed, and he proceeds to tell Mycroft about the case.
"I should leave as well," my mother says, standing.
A few hours later, their four guests had come to 221B. Mrs. Hudson had brought cookies, which was the only redeeming factor of this party in Sherlock's opinion. He eats three quarters of the plate himself, which John laughs at. Molly and Mrs. Hudson sit at the kitchen table and laugh together, while Lestrade chats with Mycroft. Sherlock realizes Mycroft is sitting in his chair, so he storms out of the kitchen on the warpath. At the same time, John offers cookies to Lestrade and Mycroft, then tries to take the plate back to the kitchen, resulting in a collision and cookies flying everywhere.
"What about me?" Sherlock asks. "Do you want me on the floor too?"
.............................................................
"It's fine."
His phone chimed with an incoming message. ‘Big Brother says you were out of town? Back yet?-GL’
"In a few short days, we will spend your heat together. Realistically, I will be moving in with you as soon as we get back because my Alpha needs to be assured you're safe all the time." Sherlock rolls his eyes. "I know this is in no way what you want, but I'm trying to be considerate. I think we should set some limits on our relationship."
"He's a kind man."
Mycroft drapes himself around his brother for just a moment, arranging himself carefully around John. "I was so afraid, Brother Mine," he confesses into Sherlock's hair.
"Possessive," Sherlock observes breathlessly.
Mycroft's phone rings at eight in the morning. "Hello?"
“Yeah. Now come on, there’s some safe places we’ve been keeping in reserve in these hills in case the base was ever attacked.”
"You are one of the only married men I know. Regardless of the fact that your wife is cheating on you, I figured I could talk to you. It was either talking to you or Anderson, and you were the obvious choice because I can actually tolerate you. You're not stupid like the others."
“I’m pretty sure they gave you heat suppressants. It would be cruel to let you go through your heat when your mate can’t take care of you.”
"No John," I reassure him as he bends down to nuzzle his nose in our combined scent. "I had to process what you said, and the processing took a while. I'm sorry I scared you."
Mycroft shoots him a bland look. "Rape, physical abuse, and sexual abuse all make fine charges for this instance."
"I'm certain they will," Mycroft replies, taking the phone and beginning to scroll through.
He meets his brother and Molly, who it seems Sherlock has asked to accompany him, to the morgue. Molly flips the sheet back, revealing the battered face of a woman that might possibly be The Woman. "I can't tell," Sherlock says, echoing Mycroft's thoughts. "Can you pull back the rest of the sheet?" Molly does so, and Sherlock stares at this woman's naked body for a moment. "It's her," he decides, and then he sweeps off.
"Thank you my dear. I'll come see you tomorrow to give you two some time to adjust."
The boys head downstairs and say goodbye to Sherlock's family. Mycroft and Sherlock whisper for a moment together.
“Alright, keep it around your shoulders anyway, just in case.”
“Weren’t you listening? A cab came for him. I watched him get in it and be driven away.”
Mycroft exits 221B and calls his driver around to take him home. Now that he had processed everything he needed to, exhaustion had set in. He crawls into the car and drifts in a half-asleep state, thinking about his brother and his brother's Alpha.
He sweeps out of the room to Anthea's desk. "Ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I must postpone our meeting. I was just informed my father passed away today. My mother is distraught, and as the eldest son I am obligated to be with her. My secretary will reschedule. Good day." Everybody gapes at him, but he ignores them.
As I enter the parlor, I notice Mycroft is sitting with Sherlock on the loveseat. Both look vastly uncomfortable. Jim and Molly are sitting on the couch with a space in the middle, clearly meant for me. Greg is on the left arm of the couch nearest Molly, with Mike on the opposite side nearest Jim. There are two empty chairs, and my automatic thought is 'This won't work.'
John thinks it over. It surprises him Sherlock is seventeen, mainly because an Omega like him should've been bonded at least two years ago, or even more. It wasn't uncommon for wealthy Omegas to be bonded at age thirteen, since they were hitting puberty then. Strange.
John tucks the blanket around his mate and cradles him close, rocking him slightly in an attempt to soothe him. Apart from them, there is a lot of buzzing and a lot of commotion, but inside the ambulance it is silent.
“Thanks.” The clicking of keys is the only response he gets as Lestrade moves into the hall and down the stairs.
"With a pay like that, we should be able to buy that last earpiece soon."
John runs through the door, staring at Sherlock expectantly.
"Pick one, then," Sherlock tells him, swinging an arm imperiously at the shelves. "I bow to your judgement."
Finally Sherlock receives an email that ends their time of no cases. “I should warn you, John, Sebastian Wilkes is possibly one of the closest things I have to a friend. We went to school together. He’s beginning to establish himself as a banker-Daddy’s money is still doing wonders at opening doors for him- and he’s a bit older than I am because I skipped a few grades. He doesn’t exactly like me all that much, but he needs help and he’s willing to pay and I’m bored, so we’re taking the case.”
Sherlock joins them a moment later, carefully put back together. There is a rather large mark from John biting him on his neck, and he quickly fastens his scarf overtop it. John growls low in his throat at the idea of his mark not being able to be seen, and Sherlock kisses him gently to placate him.
"Fine! I will!" The door slams, and Greg is gone.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but within the next moment he is at John's side eyeing the ingredients. "Which ones?"
John takes a quick shower and gets ready, looking over the clothes Sherlock handed him. John typicality doesn't sleep in trousers, and he definitely doesn't sleep in jumpers. He slips on pants and goes out to his mate.
"Nothing's wrong, Mr. Holmes," the doctor reassures him. "The arms and legs of the fetus is right here. And over here we have the arms and legs of the second fetus."
Back in 221B, John wakes up in an unfamiliar environment which he vaguely remembers might be his new flat. As he stumbles to the door, planning on a quick trip to the kitchen for food, another dose of morphine, and more sleeping, he finds the note Sherlock left. The fact that his Omega left is somewhat alarming, though John can’t blame him, if he had the chance he’d leave himself behind too. However, John wants to have his mate nearby-the Alpha in him whispers that since he is injured his mate may also get injured, and John will be unable to protect him-so he decides to haul himself down the stairs and loads into a taxi.
"We brought food," John offers, holding out the plates as an explanation of why he's intruding.
Lestrade drives home without event and parks his cruiser in the driveway. There is a strange car which he parks behind. In hindsight, he should’ve been suspicious right then and there, but he’s exhausted. He wants to go home and be with someone who loves him. He unlocks the door and steps inside.
John chuckles low in his throat. "I know. I'm watching you, remember."
John comes up the stairs and walks into the flat. "What's going on?" His stare moves to the bloody bruised American, who Sherlock has wrestled into a chair and tied and gagged with duct tape as John was coming up the stairs. "What the h**l is happening?"
*End Dream Sequence*
A second later it does, though thankfully it's not intended for Sherlock. "Here's a list of my demands for protection and my security," she tells Mycroft, holding out an envelope to him. Mycroft reaches forward to take it, then pulls back again. He settles himself into one of the plane seats-the only empty one- and begins to read. His eyebrow steadily climbs higher and higher as he does.
"Greg, have you seen John?"
"Leave our backpacks here so they know we were here." John's not going to take no for an answer, he's not letting Jim run around with open cuts that could become infected, so he tugs Jim into the school, stopping first to grab his pencil case. Once inside the bathroom and checking to be sure no ones there, he opens his pencil case to pull out hydrogen peroxide and Band-AIDS. Jim laughs, but it quickly morphs into a scowl as John dabs peroxide on the cuts. "Alright, I'm fine. Okay, stop!" Huffs Jim.
"Loathe it. This is only up for you, enjoy it," he answers darkly.
Right before dinner, Greg finds me to report Mycroft has locked himself in his office. "He won't talk to me, but I can smell him. I know he's in there," Greg tells me tearfully.
"Mind if I check?"
John inhales, trying to focus on drinking slowly. As soon as he catches a whiff of the delicious Omega smell from earlier, he quickly changes his mind, abandoning his drink to swivel on his stool and hunt the Omega.
"Stop pointing your gun at me."
John lets out a humorless chuckle. He's still waiting on the other shoe to drop.
"What?"
Greg Lestrade had had it up to here with Sherlock. Stealing evidence was one thing, threatening to jump off a roof was another, but allowing yourself to be kidnapped by a serial killer had to be one of the absolute worst ideas Sherlock had had in a very long time. It was pure luck that he hadn’t been killed, pure luck and a sniper that might also double as a guardian angel.
John can hear Sherlock on the other side of the door. From the whimpers and scratching he hears the heat is getting worse. "John? Help, please help. It hurts." John's Alpha reminds him that a knot will undoubtedly help the boy feel better, but John is not a rapist, and has helped several other Omegas through heats just like this, this one will NOT be the one to break him, irregardless of how good he smells. He wants this Omega badly, but not enough to risk his career for one bite. Once there is not a consent issue, he will bite the boy then.
This pattern continues on for the rest of the day, which makes John grin like a lunatic. In spite of his Omega's history, perhaps the boy can be happy with John after all.
"Sherlock, oh my god!" Yells Dr. Sawyer.
I know Greg's looking out for me, so I agree and sink back into the chair. Now that he's gone, I've stolen his desk chair, which is way more comfortable than the guest chair I've been daydreaming about the future in, accompanied by the click-clack of Greg's typing.
"In a bit," John tells him.
“I’m mad,” John announces as Sherlock climbs into the bed carefully with him.
"What should we do about the people downstairs? Mycroft would want to keep the party rolling, in spite of this," Sherlock says.
Sherlock stares at the bodies, looking lost.
I stand up, wobbling until Jim lurches forward to grab me. "I'll walk up," I say casually, forcing myself to meet Sherlock's gaze. "Maybe you can lead the way?" Sherlock nods stiffly. "Mike, can you grab my other arm?"
"It's a bit messy, isn't it?" I try politely. He looks around again, frowning.
"You're not so bad yourself." She smiles at him, holding his gaze until he breaks away, feeling a light blush across his cheeks though he doesn't understand why.
Looking around the room, I'm having trouble figuring out what he's so proud of. The room is messy and looks like a tornado went through. Petri dishes with mold are thrown over a table haphazardly, and papers are littered throughout. He has beakers thrown in a sink, some on the floor, and two over by the window. There's a skull on the windowsill, and I can't tell if it's real or not. He has two large bookshelves filled with textbooks, and a chair settled off to the side.
"About what?"
Sherlock pouts, but he doesn't challenge Mycroft.
"Yeah, Greg?"
“That arrogant little- do you have contact information for him? A phone number he’ll actually pick up?” Anthea offers him her phone.
This is so far from the truth I say, "Studying for what?"
"Bless you," Mrs. Holmes says, taking a plate. She kisses him again, and sits down to enjoy the meal. "Please, sit," she orders her youngest and his bonded. Mycroft slides a bit, and all four of them climb on the bed together.
"I need to go back to Afghanistan to fill out paperwork and get my stuff. I'm being honorably discharged, thanks to bonding you. They don't like to have bonded people, in case that person dies, so I'm out. We have a flight that leaves Heathrow at eleven."
"Take my card," Sherlock suggests, holding out his wallet. "And can you cash the check from Sebastian, too?"
"Very."
"Sorry. We'll talk about it later, right now we need to find John. Where's Mycroft?"
Right when he’s made up his mind to address the issue with Sherlock, his phone buzzes. ‘Hi, John, it’s DI Lestrade. Were you guys coming over to give your statement soon?’
Some point in the middle of the night, I dream of my Father. I wake up not remembering the details but terrified just the same. As my eyes fly open I realize my pack and my Alpha's are surrounding me, which makes me cringe-guess I was louder than I thought.
"John, I need you to concentrate," Sherlock demands. "The average human brain can only remember 64% of what it sees. I intend to maximize your visual memory and retrieve the paintings that way." He cradles John's head and begins spinning them in a slow circle.
.............................................................
"You're missing the point. We're married. We live together. What more do you need?" Sherlock asks.
"We insist," Greg tells her. "It's no imposition."
"Back to my house," my mother says.
Sherlock sniffles, and John looks up to see him sobbing silently. "I'm just overwhelmed with hormones, don't mind me," Sherlock jokes, scrubbing his eyes. "They're moving, John. They're alive. We're going to be parents!" There is a moment where they both stand together with their hands on Sherlock's stomach, but Sherlock breaks the silence by saying, "the books never mentioned how amazing this feels. It's a life, John! Our children are alive, and they're in there, and they're moving!"
"Okay, I'll go look at him. Stay here and-"
"No. Just...different spots." I think for a moment, trying to adjust positions mentally. "Jim, pull that chair over by Sherlock. Sit there. Greg, sit on the chair by Mycroft. Mike, sit by me."
"I know it is my decision, but I think this is what I want. I owe it to both myself and him to invest myself in a relationship with him. I can do this, just, the initial conversation idea really scares me. I should explain, just so he understands my history, but I've never fully talked about it before and I'm scared to death."
"Yes or no?" Lestrade repeats.
“John!” Sherlock gasps. John freezes for just a second, realizes that he isn’t being reprimanded, and continues on. He laves the fresh bite with his tongue, then moves to the other side and mouths at the bond bite he placed there months ago. A small, very distant part of his mind notes that this is the first time he’s touched Sherlock’s neck since the day they bonded. “John, I swear if you don’t kiss me right now I’ll-“
‘Anderson.-GL’
"No thanks," he answers, taking a momentary break to straighten his spine and rub his eyes before delving back into the printed pages.
"Detective Inspector. To what do I owe the honor of this phone call?"
Lestrade looks at John. "I think we can lift the ban on Mycroft."
Mycroft smiles a tiny bit. "Between the two of us, he is certainly more attractive. But he hasn't kissed anyone, either. Gorgeousness aside."
............................................................
Sherlock doesn't answer him. All he does is wait until they arrive at the store and then drag John up and down the aisles until he has found construction paper, and then he picks out greens and reds, bright yellows and pinks and light greens. He grabs a container of glue and a sharpie and adds that to the mix.
Far from seeming upset, the man looks pleased. He holds a device in his hand, which he dangles in front of Sherlock as bait. "This is the detonator to your mate's vest. If you shoot me, I will make sure we all go up in flames."
This gets him a blank look from the detective. "Of course we are."
3) His father is drunk enough one and two don't matter.
"Goodness sake's, Sherlock! Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade!"
"Greg, please help John up to my lab tomorrow morning whenever he wakes up."
"Yes, so please accept that I do know what I'm talking about and let me care for you. You're weak, like it or not, and I don't want you getting hurt."
Went to get milk at Tesco's. Love you! -JW
I contemplate this. It's an odd picture, the way my Alpha sees me. Perhaps someday I can see myself this way too.
"Sherlock Holmes."
“Are these human eyes?” Donovan asks, dismayed as she holds up the bag. “Why are they in the microwave?”
"I want to help," Gregory answers.
"I got it John, but thanks!"
“Wolves! Sound the alarm, the base is under attack!”
Sherlock flags another taxi and takes them to get copies of the ultrasound picture. "We'll need a lot," he tells John. "At least eleven."
Sherlock shrugs. “Currently, I’m not sure. I wouldn’t describe what I’m feeling as happiness, necessarily. I’m still adjusting to the idea of having someone else to be around. And of course I don’t really know you, which does make me nervous. I’d like to see you angry, truthfully, so I know what to expect from you. In the future, I believe there is a possibility of my being happy with you. I am open to the idea. I’m done asking questions now. I’m going for a walk. Don’t wait up.”
"You-you don't want me anymore?"
Anthea raises her eyebrows and quickly fires off a text to Mycroft. With a bit more typing from her phone she has confirmation that she is to give back the access, and to leave the case information alone. She does so, then she leaves Greg’s office.
John instantly kneels to clean up the cookies, and after a moment Sherlock decided to help. "Sorry, John," he says softly.
Mycroft hurries off to the bathroom and begins dabbing at the tea on his shirt, his mind whirling like a tornado. He knows he is being cruel to his brother, it is how they interact with each other when others are present, those who cannot know how close he and Sherlock truly are. But now, dear Lord, he was to be an uncle. This is exciting, truly it is, and he is happy, though he means to get his brother on his own some time in the near future so he can discern whether or not his brother wants to have a child. If not, Mycroft will help him, same way as he always does. But if so, then perhaps he had better go look at baby supplies during his lunch break-if he even gets a lunch break today-to pick things for his new niece or nephew. Mycroft puts a stop to that train of thought promptly. 'Better to be sure the baby will be staying, before you go planning a nursery for it,' he reprimands himself mentally. So then, that issue is sorted, the tea is off his shirt, and he makes a mental note to text the American embassy to inform them that his brother is pregnant, and not to do anything to endanger a pregnant Omega. If anything happens to his brother, he will slaughter them personally. Nodding at himself in the mirror, he exits the bathroom, only to be told his brother and mate have already left the palace to engage Irene. Mycroft acknowledges this and instantly texts the Americans his threats.
“Online supplier.”
“Music helps me hone my mind down a particular path.”
“Do you edit music yourself?” John asks.
Without another word, he swings his bag over his shoulder and rushes out the door, shoelaces untied and flapping.
“Philip! Sally! Come over here a second.”
“John’s waited seven years, Sherlock, he can wait another two minutes,” Greg says. “Guys, go ahead and take lunch.”
Your criticism is still welcome! Begged for, even.
Sherlock’s hands appear unmoored, drifting over the sheets as if he doesn’t know where to put them. John takes one and places it on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock takes the hint and rubs his hand down over his ribcage, up again, his palm over his nipple, and then his fingers plucking at it, pinching and rubbing.
I once read that writing about music is like dancing about architecture. I endeavored to do my best, and included links to similar music so that you can judge how good a job I did. You cannot listen to John’s free skate music like you could his short program, as it is an original Sherlock Holmes composition that does not exist in our universe. You can get a general idea of what I’m imagining from pieces such as
“Stranger Things? Really?”
Sherlock almost misses the bus, but scrambles on just in time, tucks himself into a seat in the back of the bus, and continues furiously tapping notes out on his screen. He is peripherally aware that he is humming quietly: “la-dee-da, la-da-dee-day-dah.” It’s the violin line. The piano and percussion are in his head still, but the violin is, at the moment, paramount.
John registers the lack of reaction from Molly, Sally, and Philip.
John slips under the ebb and flow of pleasure and allows himself to be lost in the sensation, in the dark curls under his fingers and the wet fucking sounds. He can’t be loud, but he can talk, right? Surely he can talk.
“You should go to bed as well. Most of Lestrade’s other skaters have two weeks off now that the season is officially over, so we’re going to start really working.”
John boggles at him. “That...was ‘mediocre’ piano playing?”
“Ugh.” A thought occurs to him. “Hang on. Do you have a Twitter?”
“Then pull your seat up,” John says through gritted teeth.
Sherlock is whizzing past just then, working on a transition between two jumps, and has time to lean in and say, “Again.”
Compulsory figures are specific shapes, or figures, carved into the ice using careful, controlled turns. They used to be a part of major competitions, and are where the name “figure skating” came from. They kept a lot of otherwise incredible athletes from achieving (Midori Ito, the true queen of the triple axel—go suck an egg, Tonya Harding—constantly struggled with them) and were just a drag to understand and watch, so they were eliminated in 1990. You can watch footage of them on Youtube, if you want to get a handle on how something can be so difficult to do and so dull to watch at the same time. If you look them up on Google Image, you can appreciate the very pretty shapes in the ice. And before you ask: yes, I have heard from reliable sources that people did use their skills to draw dicks on the ice.
“You do
“Isn’t he good?” Sherlock says to Greg.
“Okay, Sherlock, what are we up to after this?” John says, turning, then stops.
John bites his lip. “Can you blame me?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Fine; I had a—pain.”
“Hang on, he’s nearly got the lutz.”
“Get me out of this absolutely tragic costume first,” John says.
.” He cradles Sherlock’s stomach possessively. “I did that.”
John’s throat is tight.
When John doesn’t see him by the next morning, he privately wonders if Sherlock is peeing in jars like Howard Hughes. He wonders if there’s a mini-fridge in Sherlock’s room, if he’s subsisting off of granola bars, or if he’s eating nothing at all. John’s seen him skip meals, so he knows he can go a while.
“Uh,” he says.
“Molly might have mentioned you were training here.”
Charlotte Holmes's effigy is modeled off that of
John waves back and arranges his face into what he prays is a casual, friendly smile.
Sherlock is in the passenger’s seat of John’s Honda, tapping away on his phone. “Yes.”
He’s gotten into Greg’s and Sherlock’s habit of referring to Anderson and Donovan by their surnames. He’s not sure how it started, or why Philip Anderson and Sally Donovan are Anderson and Donovan while Molly Hooper is just Molly, but it seems right.
“What, already?”
As soon as the earbuds are in, Sherlock raises the phone and presses play.
Sorry for the lack of action here. In the end, I think I'm going to merge a lot of these chapters together. The full thing is just too much to get done in a week, so it's coming out in shorter pieces. You can follow this and the other S4 fics on the
Sherlock shrugs. “I have to keep busy.”
“Can’t wait until I can tell everyone what you make me feel. When I win that gold medal, I’m pulling you out of your seat at the kiss and cry and we’re gonna show everyone why it’s named that way. Gonna show the whole world how much you mean to me.”
His off-ice workout at the gym is also strange without Sherlock on him. John considers trying to get away without doing some of his least favorite exercises, but no doubt Sherlock would be able to tell that John had skipped them based on how he holds his fork or ties his shoes. So he does his whole workout, even the slide board. When he is finished, he is a comfortable level of tired and sore.
“Well, when you act like a massive jackass your entire career, you will find that there are people who celebrate your downfall.”
“As long as you’re not a heavy partier,” John deadpans.
John finds that the public announcement lit something in him. Telling a small circle of people that he was returning to competition didn’t quite feel tangible enough for him to believe it. Now that the world knows, it’s real. It’s happening. He throws himself into training with renewed zeal, and soon Sherlock is shouting at him less and less and he’s landing his jumps more and more.
When Sherlock sees John back on the ice, he excuses himself and skates over to join him.
There is an expression on Sherlock’s face that John cannot quite place. It looks stormy, but as if the storm is clearing to something blank and wide-eyed. Is he shocked? Angry? What should John be doing right now? Is he expected to be saying something?
“It lasted a week.”
“Uh. Pleasure.” While shaking the proffered hand, John looks, open-mouthed and eyebrows raised, over to Sherlock, whose expression is grim and sour.
Greg raises his eyebrows, then lifts his hands in a “go ahead” gesture.
“You don’t move your hips unless it’s absolutely necessary. You need to get them more fluid. Show me again, from the beginning into the combination, and this time let your hips go.”
Sherlock beams.
It’s the salchow, it’s definitely the salchow, but it was the toe loop that John fell off of in practice two weeks before the Olympics.
“You see,” Sherlock says in a rush, “I was influenced heavily by the classic Argentine tango, although the instruments are rather nontraditional. Typically it’s an orchestra with an accordion, but I disliked the timbre of the accordion for these purposes and lacked a full orchestra, which brought me to this more simplistic orchestration. I tried to steer quite clear of flamenco, although I’m afraid that elements may have leaked into the violin part. And—”
“I need you to specify further than ‘some stretches.’”
“Uh, nice to meet you too,” he manages, shaking the offered hand.
There are a few more in similar veins. Sherlock reads them, then scrolls back up and watches the video. It’s truly a beautiful performance, showing mastery of the sport well beyond the age John had been at the time. The musical choice is sound. Unique, but not obviously trying, and it fits John’s skating style. Unfortunate that this was before lyrics in music were permitted. The vocal version of the song is exquisite.
“You’re brilliant,” John says, rummaging around in the drawer.
Sherlock is pulling both legs back until his knees are all the way up to his chest, and he’s still unsatisfied. “Push my leg up,” he says breathlessly.
Sherlock lets his eyes drift shut, tips his head back, and sighs in utter bliss. Sherlock Holmes looking like
"That would be a tremendous mouthful."
Sherlock heaves a tragic sigh. “It’s underscore ‘queen,’ underscore ‘Yuna.’”

“You deserve this,” John whispers. “To ride this high.”
“I’m surrounded by madmen,” John says aloud. “But then, I came with you, so I suppose that says something about me.”
“It’s not you,” John mutters.
“You,” Sherlock says. “ You need to loosen up.”
Sherlock throws back the covers, takes John’s hands, and pulls him into a sitting position. That is...not great, but better than doing it himself.

Without looking at them, he finishes off his water bottle, tosses it into the trash can, and returns to the ice.
He looks genuinely anguished. John’s throat swells up with something more than lust. He squeezes Sherlock’s breast in a vain effort to release some of the excess emotion, which makes Sherlock whimper. His hole twitches around the head of John’s cock. John gasps and feels another surge of emotion, this one almost terrifying in its volume.
“Oh, good, John, you’ve met Mary,” Sherlock says, appearing suddenly behind them and causing Molly to jump and spill her Gatorade. “Mary, have you talked to him about press? We need to organize his announcement.”
music, my love.
“Holy shit,” he says.
“Want you to fuck me,” Sherlock breathes. The subsonic purr of his voice makes the hairs on the back of John’s neck stand up.
Sherlock relaxes slowly, and only partway. The insatiable desperation has abated, but there’s still a lazy wanting in his veins, syrupy and thick, not demanding attention so much as it is intrigued by the promise of it.

As his husband moisturizes his stomach and fetches the paracetamol and cleans him up with painstaking attentiveness, Sherlock privately meditates upon the universe of possibilities open to him for the next few weeks. He’ll not be up for another go for at least two days, to be sure. But imagine everything he can watch John do while he rests up in the meantime. Sherlock, sprawled on the sofa while John eats him out. John, rubbing himself off on Sherlock’s belly, all the time being so, so careful not to jostle him too badly. Sherlock, propping himself up on pillows so he can sit up comfortably while John fucks his face.
“Time for yoga.”
John takes a bite of his sandwich and chews thoughtfully. “Oh, wow,” he says around his mouthful. “This is really good. What kind of bread is this?”
Tenor notes of
They are halfway back to John’s house before some of what Sherlock said starts ringing up odd.
“Massive assholes,” John says, which makes Sherlock grin.
A picture of a teenager with a Pixie Stick arranged like a line of cocaine, straw in nostril and poised over the powder, with the caption, “@sholmes before 2014 Nats.”
“Click?”
Sherlock shoots him a look. “Please.”
“I can see you made this edit of yourself skating to a BTS song. How many of your accounts are teen girls?”
(And if that makes John quietly, secretly excited, that’s all the more reason
Sherlock sighs dramatically and does not look up from his phone. “Although I do my best not to notice anything that Anderson does, the strained tenor fighting his way through ‘Nessun Dorma’ is unfortunately inescapable, and the fool is using the Hugh Jackman version of ‘Bring Him Home.’”
John showers, and they eat dinner, and he goes to bed. The next morning, when Sherlock wakes him up for yoga, he checks his phone.
Snogging is a logistical challenge when an extra twenty-five pounds are introduced, particularly when those twenty-five pounds keep kicking someone in the ribs. They work it out in the end, though it’s sure to prove too great a strain on John's shoulder eventually. John braces his hands on the sofa back on either side of Sherlock's head and kneels with his legs outside Sherlock's. It isn’t ideal, and John still feels like he’s squishing their firstborn a bit. But God, he can’t not touch this man.
I know at this point the last thing you care about is what the damn skating looked like, but if you're trying to picture John's programs here,
“Everyone takes baths.”
Side note: I have made the executive decision to include very few real-life figure skaters in this fic, because it presents the uncomfortable problem of me having to make John Watson a higher-scoring skater than the Nathan Chens and Yuzuru Hanyus of the world. Pairs and dance are largely safe, and ladies slightly so, but for men, do not expect to see Adam Rippon.
John blinks. “How did you—”
It’s been an hour, but the lights and the sounds are still ringing in John’s head. The brilliant shapes in the sky, the thrill of being surrounded by some of the best of the world, the thrill of being one of them! It’s almost enough to warm him up. PyeongChang is cold in February, and between lining up with the other American athletes and then standing outside in the frigid air, John spent quite a bit of time exposed to it. On the ice, he warms up quickly, but not so much in the open air.
By the time he comes up with the tube of lube, Sherlock has drawn his legs up and is gently squeezing his cock again.
He nods towards the hallway. “Room’s down that way?”
This turned out to be clairvoyant. Less than a week after I wrote this bit, Karen Chen posted a picture with Mai Mihara on her Instagram at the rink where Brian Orser’s skaters train, and eagle-eyed fans spotted a man in the background. Twitter blew up trying to guess who could be switching to Orser. For days, Twitter was chock full of side-by-side comparisons of the mystery man’s hair and the curve of his thigh and calf with Boyang Jin’s. They put Setlockers to shame. (It turned out to be Yuzuru Hanyu, who we all already knew trains there. Someone spotted his mom in another part of the background and worked it out.)
Sherlock frowns. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I did actually go to medical school.”
“Yeah, I heard you just fine. How exactly do I have those, what with my total lack of a previous season to earn me them?”
The costume designer pats his arm. “Don’t worry, darling,” she says. “You’ll look wonderful.”
-Your opinions on this Sally?
He doesn’t sound accusatory. He probably even thinks his tone sounds conversational. Coming from anyone else, it would. But John has rarely heard Sherlock sound this flat and tired. Of course he’s tired. After three years of seeing this level of vitriol every day, how couldn’t he be?
“Nice,” John says, leaning forward. “So you’re here to put up all the nice pictures of us?”
Of all of Sherlock’s strengths, he was never famed for his stamina. He tends to expend too much energy in the first half of his program and be left gasping by the end. Consequently, he is in the habit of taking frequent short breaks in practices earlier on in the season. As the season progresses, he gradually lengthens the spaces between them.
“What I’m saying,” John says, “is whatever I accomplish at these games, it’s yours too. I want you to share it with me.”
“So you edit music, you choreograph for whoever lets you...what don’t you do?”
“Oh, uh, thanks,” he says.
John goggles at him. “Sorry, you--of course you helped design them.”
“I’m the luckiest, though,” Sherlock says. “Because I just fucked an Olympic gold medalist.”
Well, his first practice had to be sometime. It might as well be now.
Molly beams. “You’re sweet.”
What? What does it being an Olympic year have to do with…
A Biellmann is a position where the skater pulls their free leg behind them and at the level of or over their head. It is found both in spirals (when you skate on one foot for a really long time) and in spins. There are variations on where you can hold your free leg, but grabbing the blade of the skate is the most common. It’s nearly universal in ladies’ skating, but quite rare in men’s, because of the lower flexibility of most men. Here is
“Oh! I should have said earlier. You’ll be staying in my spare bedroom.”
“So you’re letting the freak coach you,” Sally says with a sneer.
Sherlock flushes. “I don’t settle for mediocrity.”
“You’re behind the ball,” Mary says. “He was in the background in Molly’s Instagram story for a second yesterday, and everyone on Twitter has been speculating about who it could have been.”
After looking for a while, John says quietly, “She posts a lot of you.”
"Fair enough," John says, and saunters over from the kitchen to the sofa to give his husband a proper seeing-to.
His voice sounds very small and timid. Sherlock and Greg both look at him.
. I’m extremely gay for that bit of choreography right on the first “Roxane,” when they both do that thing with their arms. Also that lift when Tessa sort of vaults herself directly onto Scott’s face.
A lutz is a jump that takes off from an outside edge, which is not the edge that you intuitively want to be taking off from. If you take off from the inside edge, it’s technically not a lutz, it’s a flip. When a skater plans a lutz and messes up the edge that badly, it’s nicknamed a “flutz,” a very cute term which I love very much. Similarly, if a skater attempts a flip and takes off from an outside edge, making it technically a lutz, it’s called a “lip.” These are much rarer than flutzes.
"And if I decide.... to not have—- the surgery?"
Besides, beggars can't be choosers. “It’ll do.”
"Right," the blond man says, shedding a pair of paint-flecked floral gardening gloves with one fingertip missing. "Come on," he says to Sherlock, wiping his hands onto a plaid cloth handkerchief he digs out from a jeans pocket.
"And with sincere remorse, I had it very carefully dry-cleaned.

mean is that those experiences couldn't have been traumatic for his husband. The way both you and him have described his regret at the turns your relationship took after Afghanistan tells me that much of his behaviour at home was reactive, too. But it doesn't help either of you to deny its impact on you."
"That doesn't change the fact that I'm the problem. As much as you wax dramatic about it being
Something about this doesn't seem right. The thing with Sherlock is that sometimes, when he most vehemently denies something being wrong, he ends up revealing himself in other actions. On a surface level, he just seems profoundly disappointed by this setback, but the detail of how adamant he was against sedation or a short GA sticks out. He's never had any trouble with or objections to general anaesthesia before; you even know he's declined a spinal block and another nerve block for various fractures before in favour of the oblivion of GA.
"The truck driver was guilty of reckless driving, of endangering the lives of anyone in his path when he ran that red light. He was found to have forged his drive log; he was working way beyond the legal hour limits. He was tired, in a hurry, and he took a deliberate risk that killed three people. Yes, you, Mary and your daughter were there because you were drunk, but that created only the circumstances, not the accident itself."
"Jesus fuck, Sherlock! Just
"––your thoughts?" John asks him, his voice breaking Sherlock out of his reverie.
He wonders if the message he's typed can manage to convey the intended sarcasm. He's never sure.
John hangs up and rises to his feet. "I can't keep mopping your messes. I thought we were past this. Just… just try to manage? I know it's…" He grits his teeth, "…I know it much get on your nerves more than average when things keep changing all the time, and stuff gets cancelled, and you can't get the services you're used to as fast as before, but we're in the equivalent of war, Sherlock. I have twenty per cent of anaesthetists off sick or quarantined after returning from skiing holidays and whatnot, a hell of a mess to sort out with helping organise commute transport for lots of staff, and that's just the beginning.
"I know that the diagnosis of PTSD requires symptoms to persist for some time. I'm not exhibiting symptoms of the preceding form, an acute crisis reaction, to what happened on Monday, either," Sherlock insists.
"They know it was a very difficult surgery, and that the risk of complications was high. As careful as we were, an aneurysm tore during the operation, but we managed to remove the entire tumour. Unfortunately, a blood vessel needed to be clipped in order to control the bleeding, and that artery supplies certain important brain functions," Lestrade recites.
Pichler flips back about a dozen pages in her notebook. "We once discussed the time you spent in a halo vest, during which you and John went through a difficult time. Something you said then stayed with me and I wrote it down:
"If I told you…" Sherlock jokes, and schools what he hopes is a disarming smile on his features.
“Took the liberty how? You don’t know my laptop's password.”
The next morning, they part ways at the staff entrance. John heads downstairs to the lockers to change into scrubs while Sherlock, wearing a dark blue suit and a white shirt today, is bound for to the neurosurgical ward's morning round. The preparations for his first operation will take long enough that he can attend the round, grab a coffee and change to scrubs before his phone will ring with a summons to the OR unit.
Sherlock runs a hand through his curls. His focus is shot to hell right now, as evidenced by John being able to sneak up on him like this. Facts keep slipping off or taking him by surprise, still swirling around on the surface of his consciousness.
"I'll text you," you promise, and he leaves with a nod.
There's a glass of red wine on the table for John, a full glass of water for Sherlock since he rarely drinks alcohol at home, but an empty wine glass just in case he changes his mind. Red wine tends to give him a flush and a headache — he's sensitive to the histamine-triggering substances in it. He will probably pass for tonight, but he’s touched by the gesture of the choice.
"It's John, please," you tell Marsh, hoping he won't be put off by Sherlock's instant dismissal.
When Sherlock wakes up in the morning, he's shivering violently. Nothing but ashes remain in the fireplace and he has so little firewood left he can either get it going or make tea on the wood-burning stove in the kitchen, not both. Last night, he'd also wondered if he could create a wedge that he could hammer into the doorway of the outhouse, which he could then turn so that it would prevent the door from gaping all the time.
"It's fine. You seem less upset so perhaps we can shift that lens."
Mycroft stands up, adjusts his vest and buttons up his jacket again. "Forgive me; there are things which I must attend to, and I would rather make myself useful to my employer instead of waiting and fretting."
"But you were alone. And you're not
"A moment, please," John barks at the door. In protest, he doesn't spring to his feet but takes his time to down the last of his coffee and to wait for his computer to reboot; the dratted calendar app has crashed again. The private sector may provide many cushy perks to specialists, but well-functioning, reliable IT is not one of them. Perhaps it's a pipe dream for the healthcare sector.
"All my life — including through all of medical school and during most of my surgical training — I avoided revealing the fact that I am on that Spectrum. I wanted to pass my classes, to achieve a medical licence without anyone being able to say that I was let off easily, that I wasn't the same as other students or trainees. It was when that first complaint to the GMC was made that I realised that I could no longer refuse to address the problem, and that I had to seek some manner of support to bridge the gap of what was expected and what I was capable of in terms of dealing with people. I disclosed my ASD diagnosis to Doctor Watson before he was appointed my mentor."
, for fuck's sake! Why the hell would you marinate yourself in that shit?” That being said, John marched up the stairs in a more spirited manner than was probably good for someone who’s just had surgery.
"He can be rational when he needs to be," John argues waspishly.
There are also the OR statistics. John receives a set of printouts monthly to assess the cost-effectiveness of the OR units under his supervision. Sherlock is taking longer than he used to, which puts him in the same average operation length bracket as Anderson. And now, he's evading not just risks but his colleagues, too. He attends to his duties at the ward and the outpatient clinic, does his surgeries, but all this happens on autopilot. Even the sorts of cases that should bring out his cockiness — that deserved arrogance of a surgeon at the top of their game — now coax forth little reaction besides a pained silence.
Violet is the first to reach the hall, anxious and tense as she stands waiting for the door to open. John goes to her, lays a palm on her mother-in-law's shoulder. Mycroft has stayed behind in the sitting room.
[23:46] I’m awake nurse has gone to get me more oxy previous one has stopped working
, Sherlock," Lestrade commands. "You're young in surgical years. You've plenty of time to fuck up royally more time than you can count."
"I get the impression that, rationally, you feel it was the right decision for you and George and Sherlock that she wasn't to be a part of your family?" Doctor Pichler suggests, "but the emotional side of things still gives you pause?"
Sherlock looks satisfied, but can you be sure that a test devised by his brother whose profession it was based on will convince him?
"Thank you, good evening, Mister Holmes," Drakan Zezelj replies, and ends the Zoom call.
What the hell's going on?" John puts the kettle he'd been filling on the counter. The tap is still running.
"How was I supposed to know all those things? I was just trying to be… graceful, I guess."
Reluctantly, Sherlock drops into a chair and skewers a bit of salmon. John goes to sit on the sofa, spreads a throw on his knees and tries not to pay attention to how little Sherlock will actually consume of his portion.
"Well,
", Sherlock mocks in a falsetto voice. "Got a wrist fracture repositioned before any of the meds or even the local anaesthesia had kicked in because they were convinced that I was on, I quote, '
He drops the now drained cod into the makeshift tank inside the seat.

"If you can call it that. They died."
"Makes sense." John pours them both a mug full of the tea that has now steeped enough.
I've kept myself together for so long that I forgot how to let go of any of it. I swore as I flung myself off that roof that it wouldn't change me, that I'd come back the same man John buried. It doesn't work that way and realising it as I left his wedding to someone else, the finality of it nearly made me relapse that night.
"Right about what?"
"Yes. He is quite harsh on himself when evaluating how well he has succeeded. As I mentioned, he creates standards for himself which even neurotypical individuals would struggle to reach."
________________
An hour later, while John is brushing teeth in the bathroom, Sherlock texts Lestrade.
"I don't need to placate anyone right now. I can do as much research as I want with the funding I already have. But I don't want to do more. I'm quite comfortable with our current amount of free time."
"Tea?" Mycroft offered but made no move towards where the housekeeper had left a tray.
, you wonder. After the nerve block catheters were removed yesterday, he's needed larger doses of oxycodone. They make him take short naps throughout the day, from which he jolts awake often very suddenly. Falling asleep seems to happen at the drop of a hat, too. "You're fine. Sherlock? It's alright."
Once John has managed to swallow down two tablets with half a glass of water, Sherlock watches him like a hawk as he pulls on the first set of clothes he can find. He has rarely seen John this sick — getting shot notwithstanding, the only occasion this reminds him of is the Dengue fever in Malosa, and that's a memory Sherlock most decidedly does not want to revisit.
. "I've been told that those side effects ease off after the first week."
"They all know, don't they? They know what happened? They know I–– I froze," Sherlock says quietly, eyes averted, throat tight.
"I took lessons for ten years as a child, yes."
Time is ticking away; the patient is in cardiac arrest. "Get me the angio slides on the screen.
"Bed,
"Yeah, Mr Cowie seemed very pleased. I'm Leah."
He had nearly
from Winter." Vivaldi's over-played series of four short concertos wouldn't have been Sherlock's first choice, but he knows it well. It is a piece taught to all advanced violin students.
"Like you said, it was a few years ago, but it's… complicated."
Had John even attended the Coroner's Inquest? Or had he left town once the police interviews were done? Sherlock continues reading the Inquest papers and notices that a witness had been unavailable. The paperwork states that steps to enforce compliance had been refrained from because the facts of the case could be established without, and out of compassion for the surviving victim who was the witness in question.
"Is this the problem, dear?" Violet asks. "Why don't you think you can do anything? I'm sure he appreciates your company. It's rather miserable to be ill like that."
"I like it here," John says, gazing over the moonlit sea. "I was more in the mood for cheap and cheerful than a jacket-and-tie affair, anyway, if I'm honest. Maybe we plan trips too meticulously; it was nice just to act a bit spontaneous this time."
"We all make mistakes––"
"And I predicted you'd be amenable," Mycroft replies dryly and grabs his coat.
The gents is now empty, save for Sherlock. He closes his eyes, leans his back against the wall beside the row of sinks.
"I'm for bed," you say the next evening.
He had worried whether the ancient boiler and the old pipes could even provide enough hot water for a full tub. The pipes began to rattle visibly when Angus had turned the system on, and there was a slightly metallic tang in the taste and an initially brownish discolouring in what spouted out of the tap but all that cleared out eventually. The water had made Sherlock’s limbs heavy, lulled him into a state of relaxation the likes of which he doesn't remember achieving in years. When had he begun living his life in a constant state of high alert, entangled in danger and suspicion, chronically nervously expectant of unpredictable things such as Victor's next visit? He rarely spent an entire evening at home, preferring to be out and about working, but when he was at his flat he often paced the floors like a ghost, playing guessing games and bargaining superstitiously with himself regarding whether it was likely that he’d heard a familiar knock on the door. He would never demand that Victor announce his visits beforehand — it would seem like Sherlock expected more than their casual affair, and he didn't want to give Victor the upper hand like that. They existed in a state of are-they-or-aren't-they because he had convinced himself it suited them both. Why tie himself to a person? A part of him
John twists his torso where he's sitting on a folding chair to see what has caught Mycroft's attention.
Sherlock glares at him.
"Your landlady said something about a case?"
"Because I can't meet them?"
John raises a brow at this just as he had at Edgar's presence when they had arrived, but he says nothing. Edgar is in the front seat of the cab, ready to make some more notes as they make their way home via the NVS Pharmacy at 46 Baker Street. John has been prescribed paracetamol, an anti-inflammatory and oxycodone; Sherlock would have expected co-codamol, which contains the milder opioid codeine. He asks John about it.
"Don't tell them they
It's domesticated; it doesn't protest one bit when Sherlock ties a bit of string to its old collar and begins leading it away from the delicacies of the overgrown back garden and towards the road. It follows him meekly until they're some thirty metres from John's house. That is where the ram stops, drops a load on the road, takes a few steps forward and then arranges itself primly into a cosy heap in the middle of the road. No amount of cajoling can get it to rise, and it's too heavy for Sherlock to lift. All he can do if leave it there and go bang on John's door.
Holmes
His appetite is always the first to go when anxiety takes up residence. If only there was a discernible reason for it, but he cannot work out what that could be. Somehow, it's everything and nothing at the same time. It makes his bow hand tremble, his stomach churn and his concentration shatter.
"I heard about what happened yesterday," she replies amicably, "and wanted to see how the two of you were doing."
"Of course, you can," John counters, his face twisting in concern. "I'm just… I don't want to inconvenience you even more than being sick or injured derails your life by default. You told me it's always hard on you."
Sherlock can't help the snort that escapes. "The Hippocratic Oath must be a burden on your bad days, I suppose."
Sherlock snatches the clip introducer from Jane's hand and shoves it in, hoping for the best because hope and luck is all he has — his skills might help him navigate blind, but he doesn't even have time to consider the optimal angle for the clip.
oversee the proceedings and the use of drones to survey wrecks not identified or explored on their prior trip — will be Sherlock.
"I thought I had a plan, a next step we were supposed to be working on this week for the staged patent application. I knew what it was, but I couldn't bring myself to even open any of the files." He sounds astounded. "I never freeze in the OR. I'm never slow like the rest of you. But today, there was… a door, and it remained shut for me."
She doesn't even attempt to conceal her surprise. "What? Why?" Her first thought is that she'd crossed a line, somehow, in asking to contact his partner when they'd last spoken. Once he'd got over his initial skittishness he’d seemed relieved at the suggestion. At least that’s how Joanna had read it.
"So you're… is this about therapy?"
“What’s with the third degree?”
It's silly, this playacting after being together for years – after being
visiting hours at an ITU/ICU = visiting at these wards is often limited to the immediate family. Mycroft can, of course, get all the necessary rules bent for John. If a patient is close to death, official visiting hours (if there even are any) are made flexible. Family members don’t often stay very long with patients who are sedated and on a respirator.
John completes the circuit between his imagination and his body by enveloping his glans, pushing the foreskin down with his circled fingers and suckling at the tip with his lips and his tongue. The effect is nearly intolerably intense, and Sherlock only barely keeps his thighs from reflexively jerking together. After the initial assault, John slows the proceedings down, pulling away and wrapping his fingers around the base of Sherlock's cock and delivering slow, meticulous licks up the glans. Once he has Sherlock right where he must have decided he wants him, John envelops the tip with his lips again, grabbing Sherlock's wrist as he reflexively tries to shove John away as the sudden, intense pressure building at the base of his stomach almost short-circuits his frantically firing nerves.
"Ya ne'er know, do yer?" Angus says with a shrug and reaches out for the end of the rope which John offers him. Angus tsks at Edward, then starts for the pen.
"Then what do we need to do, Sherlock? Just one word, that's all I need regarding next Monday. Work or home?"
"I packed your new prescriptions," he tells Sherlock in the car Mycroft has sent. "Your passport's in your coat pocket."
pleural fluid = systemic illness, lung disease, sepsis, cardiac issues and chest trauma and cardiothoracic surgery can all lead to an accumulation of fluid in the pleural sac, which surrounds lungs. There needs to be a bit of pleural fluid for healthy lung function.
"Oh." Sherlock's lip quirks up. "Am I to deduce the village GP has a temper, then?" He has the distinct sense that John is making some vague point with this story.
"Yeah," you agree. That's the answer you were hoping for. Whether Sherlock believes the man entirely is another thing. You fear that he might still think people are ignoring and dismissing his concerns because of his past drug history. You don't, and you really hope he knows that.
"Because of his history? They told you about that?" It's imperative that Leah understands that doses of opioids normally used on people will do very little for Sherlock. Or so you are convinced. So you fear.
Nor any more youth or age than there is now;
"Where are you, precisely?" Mycroft Holmes asks without so much as a
Perhaps the limitations EU legislation has placed on hunting have not hit Scotland as hard as they have Baltic islands, where the traditional sea bird hunting habits have had to change a lot in the past 20 years. Bird soup was one of my childhood delicacies; duck-like and mild if the birds shot eat mostly vegetables, pungently gamey if they eat shellfish. Summer guests always considered the latter an acquired taste LOL
as one of the emails had said.
John chuckles joylessly. "Yeah. He basically thinks everything is always his fault."
, anyone would be traumatised by what he's gone through lately, but why does he have to spend all his energy trying to repel anything and everything that could get him through this?! I'm tired, I'm so fucking tired, Joanna, of being told I can't understand shit, that you can't understand shit, because we're not surgeons. There's no holy understanding that'll descend from the heavens when you cut someone with a scalpel because if there were, he should be the bloody pope of that church since he's so good at it. Yet he thinks all of that is worth nothing because he made one mistake.
"Perhaps."
"I knew it had one, and that's why I tried to say no, but I couldn't quite get the words out."
Daring is what this case requires in troves. The anatomy involved demands that a surgeon twists and bends all of the commonly agreed-upon safety rules for combining surgery and angiography unless in an emergency. Sherlock knows that many surgeons would say no even
For the last three days, the research unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital should have offered him a haven away from his King's College worries, but despite his best efforts, he could not focus on his work there. He stared at the graphs, but the data which usually sang to him was suddenly mute.
Your eyes trail Helena as she leaves to make the call. When you turn to face Sherlock again, you're astonished to see that he's heaved himself into a sitting position again. His bathrobe hangs open, the incision uncovered. Helena had promised to bring in something to cover it again. He's taken off the pulse ox, pushed off the BP cuff.
to shame! You rack your brain about relationship stuff that doesn't even occur to me!"
"I'll go to Ormond Street today, then," Sherlock says. "Might as well use this ridiculous impromptu vacation for something useful, if you insist on it." He's addressing nobody in particular.
"Not per se; I will have to start the patient on a broader spectrum antibiotic and an antiviral, anyway."
"He thinks I have a particular… penchant for it. He seems convinced that seeing more men than just him in uniform would be a major incentive for me to attend the reunion. I detest the insinuation that I would be sexually interested in other officers."
"A claim? Made by who?"
me! First, you invited me here, then we went to the Centre, then the meeting, then this before you spring a job offer on me which would tie us together semi-permanently, give me a reason to spend quite a lot of time here. I feel like I was auditioning for something without knowing."
"He was pretty shellshocked. Yeah, that's the best word. He wasn't quite pretending it didn't happen, but it was as though he'd stepped outside of it and didn't understand what he was looking at, if you catch my drift. I don't know if that makes sense, but…"
"And I cannot imagine how I could have been more honest of my faults in that regard. Ever since I was accepted into medical school, I have had to work twice as hard as others to get by. While excelling academically, I have faced many periods during my career when it would have been the path of least resistance to quit. Disability laws are what they are, but patients are not interested in why their doctor or the medical student bothering them is so odd, rude or difficult — they just want someone
What does that mean? Is the family angry and disappointed, after all? Have they lost their trust in King's College's services?
Sherlock blinks.
"Then again, you've kept telling me that I'm illogical and inconsistent and impulsive." The sarcasm falls flat due to his detached tone.
"Yes, yes, balls and pens and she puts things on fork and knife."
"The ENT case I did with Collings is having acute dysarthria, is conscious but won't communicate beyond just the occasional word. I've done a CT and an MRI and an EEG and lab work, and there's no diagnosis."
Regardless of whether he'll go back to King's, he's not going to let the GMC grind into dust all his hard work and the reputation he has built by doing his very best for his patients. If he's managed to convince even Violet bloody Holmes that he belongs in the ranks of neurosurgeons, setting the record straight with the GMC should be a walk in the park.
"I enjoy my work."

He recalls what Violet had said about her and George's social circles. Sherlock wonders if Edgar qualifies as a friend he has gained on his own. No, he's an employee, even if he has sometimes shared personal details with Sherlock. Some people do that at work, which has always struck him as odd.
"––there was no reasoning with him. He had fixated on certain details, namely my involvement and the fact that I hadn't been there to argue my decision when he arrived at A&E drunk and devastated by his wife's passing."
You can't make promises for him that none of those fears, none of that defeat in the face of such an uphill climb is uncalled for because he'd just dismiss your reassurances as the working of an inferior mind. There is one thing you can tell him, however, because you're his friend and a doctor and
Sherlock doesn't smile — if anything, the edges of his mouth pinch straighter in irritation. "I can assure you I'm more viscerally aware of time zones right now than you are." He takes off his jacket, opens the top two buttons of his dress shirt.
"I still felt guilty, even if we just agreed with what the vet was saying."
Sherlock feels better than he has in years. Every day he wakes up and there is work,
to have a Twitter?” John groans.
“Not at all,” says John. “Mind if I…?”
“Says the man with the Biellmann,” John says.
One time while rehabbing from an injury, Yuzuru Hanyu could not seem to land his single or double axel. His coach, mostly just out of curiosity, told him to try the triple axel. He landed it right off. As his coach said, "His body only remembered how to do the triple."
tickets back—another $3,000? What must it be like to be able to drop John’s entire monthly income on a whim?
“I want you to fuck me,” Sherlock breathes, and oh, yes, that is a good idea.
Sherlock moans around his mouthful, and John can feel the vibration in his teeth.
Sherlock flushes bright pink. “I...oh.”
He reaches up, bats Sherlock’s hand out of the way, pinches his nipple between his thumb and forefinger, and tugs
