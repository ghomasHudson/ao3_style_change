“Apparently,” Sherlock hummed.
When they were gone, Lestrade cleared his throat. “Let me know if you… erm… need me,” he offered, half-heartedly, and turned to leave as well.
“No,” Mary choked. “We’re leaving, we’re gone. You can have him.” She shot a scathing glare in John’s direction. “Good fucking luck.”
“How do you feel about Mary’s death?”
And if near-death experiences were what it took... well. Our lives were about to get a little more dangerous.
He somehow managed to stand and half drag him all the way to shore. They were breathing heavily and Sherlock collapsed on the ground while John took off his own jumper. “Get undressed,” John commanded and at the same time started to do it for him as Sherlock was clearly incapable of doing it himself. He pulled off his coat and unbuckled his jeans and pulled them down and took of his jumper and vest. Sherlock was now half naked in the snow with his jeans bunched up on the tops of his boots around his ankles. John took a pocket knife out of his jacket where he kept it always and cut them away. Sherlock was breathing shallowly and he’d stopped shivering. That was a bad sign. “Come on,” John said and leaned down to put Sherlock’s arm around his shoulder. “I can’t carry you all the way, you’re going to have to help me.”
. It made John’s chest feel tight. He clenched his teeth together and spoke through them. “Yes. Well. Good. I’ll go and get some meat to thaw for supper later.” He knew Sherlock was watching as he turned around and left the barn because he could feel his gaze and because he didn’t hear any sound of milk being squirted into the pail.
That was, until the night we’d chased after the axe murder.
Sherlock’s eyes popped open, ridden with fear and anguish. “John—“ he gasped, bringing a hand up to clutch John’s t-shirt. “John—“
Mum turned around and gave me a look, still flipping sausages in the pan on the stove. “I know,” she said, turning back, “but this is his area.”
Instead, he turned back. “I don’t want to leave.”
But then, there had been John.
I swallowed. “You were thinking about me.”
And well. He was older after all.
The lock turned and Lestrade’s mouth curved into a half-smirk. “Still got it,” he murmured, as he gently pushed his way through the door.
“It’s past midnight,” I said in a harsh whisper. Though I wasn’t sure why I was whispering. Maybe I thought Mrs. Hudson might hear us? (Like she hadn’t heard us having sex hours ago.) “You need to leave.”
“What?” Mycroft shouted, his eyesight not quite as good as it once was.
Then, he curtsied.
“It’s not like in fairytales,” John said, as if Sherlock was a child. “There isn’t—it’s not ‘one person for everyone.’ There’s no such thing as ‘true love.’ There’s no such thing as ‘soul mates.’ You pick someone you love and you fucking
. The little street was packed with police cars, ambulances, news crews, the like. John grabbed his bag and flung open the door, not bothering to shut it as he rushed toward the scene.
“Uhhh… yeah,” John said, slowly.
Sherlock knew John would want to leave. He could almost hear him saying it, the clearing of his throat, the shuffling of his feet, the deep breath and exhale before his spoke, without looking up, “I really think I should move out. It’s just too much, Sherlock. I just lost Mary, and the baby, and I can’t process all of this right now. I don’t want to give you any false hope, either… you know that I’m not… you know… and that means I can’t give you what you… it’s just too much, right now. I just need some time.” Sherlock felt his heart contract, an acidic pain spread out from the center of his chest, stinging his stomach, throat, eyes. Those words would be terribly, horribly painful. Just thinking about them had brought a little taste of that pain; he couldn’t imagine what the real thing would do.
This was going to be awkward. Confronting Sherlock about anything was an art in and of itself, but confronting him about this? John shivered. It was going to be a mess.
Anna snorted, trying to stifle a laugh.
“Indeed,” Sherlock continued. “The fact is, not only does your wife know that you’re gay, she also knows about every single
Sherlock must have known what he was thinking, because suddenly he pushed John’s finger out with a “pop” and dropped to his knees. “Sher—“ John started but ended in surprise as Sherlock shimmied his trousers and pants off his hips in an instant. He paused and looked at John’s cock for a moment, already thick and taut, then back up at John’s face.
Okay, so there's going to be a little angst... I couldn't resist!
I hated him for doing that to me, for altering the way I saw the world. I had been better before, when I hated sex, when I didn’t care, when I was a sociopath, when I could devote every ounce of thought and energy to solving crimes. I was brilliant. I was a genius. Now anyone could beat me at a puzzle, even half-witted tits like Anderson. Anyone could beat me, because my mind wasn’t perfectly focused anymore. It kept going back to John, to the sound of his laugh, to the taste of his skin, to the feeling of him under me.
“I know—“
“Sherlock!” John scolded. “Jesus Christ.” He turned to Ella. “So sorry.”
And kissing him, and liking it. That had never happened before. What I had been trying to tell him, so ineloquently, was that I thought I might need to be in love to enjoy physical intimacy. The two, for me, seemed to be inextricably linked; I couldn’t take pleasure in the second without having the first. But as John was clearly not wired that way, so he would have a difficult time understanding.
I supposed four months of “shy virgin” was too many, and John had started to become suspicious. Why he’d chosen this moment in time to bring it up, though, I didn’t know. He acted so irrationally, sometimes. I looked up from my microscope and blinked at him. “Of course I am.”
“And now you have,” Sherlock finally found his voice.
things myself!) until he reached in to wash it off for me. It was a spot on my wrist, just below my palm, and he grasped my hand and turned it over and thumbed the spot under the running water. My hand tingled where he touched it.
Now, he looked over at Anna, who had been given a slice of Christmas pie and who looked as if she’d thought it a hat instead of food. She banged her sticky fists on her tray, yelling nonsense at such quickly varying octaves that it could have only been an attempt at singing. Sherlock smiled and sat back in his chair, listening to the music of her most unique and absurd Christmas carol, enjoying it in a way that only a parent could do.
“John.”
,” Sherlock whispered back.
John looked at him through heavily-lidded eyes and reached out to grab a fistful of his shirt, pulling him in so that they could kiss again. Sherlock’s hands were suddenly everywhere—first on John’s face, then down to his chest, under his t-shirt, up again, the shirt was off, Sherlock’s hands were smoothing the flesh round John’s back, tucking into his waist, a finger slipping down into—
Ella turned back to Sherlock. “John tells me that you two kissed.”
. Honestly, I think the only reason he’s survived this long is that no one can predict what he’s going to do next. Fucking arsehole,” she added, under her breath. Then she promptly flipped the blade closed and came to squat next to John.
, people she
Sherlock thought, again cursing himself for not knowing the proper sex etiquette. He tentatively wrinkled John’s shirt up to his chest and held it there for a while as they continued to snog, until John grabbed it and took it off himself.
“Oh,” I said, as it clicked. “You’re in love with me.”
John had thought about what he wanted to say while he was out in the barn and he was ready now. “Sherlock,” he started and faced him. Sherlock froze by the fire. “The girl in that video is happy. She’s safe. I’m betting she’s loved as well, by the people who adopted her.” John took in a breath. “I’m not coming back with you.”
“She told me the truth," Sherlock growled. "What the hell have you done? What have you
John shook his head. “Well, according to him, that’s all gone now.”
Mary’s body trembled with rage. “This is my
Molly bit her lip, as if deciding whether or not to continue. “Oh Sherlock, I would have done it in a heartbeat, had you asked me. I would have done anything, really.” Her eyes filled with tears, and Sherlock felt a sharp pang of guilt. “I know it was foolish, how I wanted you, but I couldn’t help it.”
Lestrade’s protests were drowned out by Carruthers’ screams as John wrenched down his trousers and pants and grabbed his penis with his free hand, stretching it up as far as he could. Carruthers strained against the handcuffs, banging them on the table, flinging himself about in fear and protest. “Shhhh,” John said to him, digging a knee into his belly to keep him from moving. “I know what I’m doing. I’m a doctor.”
“A lofty aim, I know. But Moriarty was… I thought he wanted all the things that I wanted. He was sympathetic, and passionate. I suppose I got swept up in his grand plan for this ‘criminal network’ that could wreak havoc on the government. What I didn’t realize was that—well, to put it bluntly, Moriarty is a complete lunatic. He doesn’t
John put his face in his hands. “Sherlock,” he said, his voice muffled by his palms, “Sherlock, that’s what I’m doing. I
Sherlock, I’ve been calling you for hours—answer your sodding phone!”
He went back in like a starving man. His hands in my hair, on my shoulders, gripping my shirt once more. I didn’t care this time, about the wrinkles. I clutched at the fabric of his sleeves, trying to anchor myself somehow.
“Sherlock, calm down,” John said, firmly. “Getting angry isn’t helping at all.”
John looked back, surprised. “How do you mean?”
“Well, you’ve got an excellent memory, then.” He stood up and pointed down the beach. “Do you remember my girls? My youngest, Lucy, is only a year older than you. They’re just down there, playing with some minnows they caught in the stream. I’m sure they’d love you to join them.” His eyes flickered to Sherlock as if he was asking for permission, but Sherlock just looked at the girl.
. The sounded nice, sounded perfect right now. He stripped off his wet clothes on the way to the loo, leaving them in piles on the floor (Mrs. Hudson would pick them up later and scold him, but sod it). He sat on the edge of the tub as he ran the faucet, naked and goose-fleshed, thinking of nothing but getting warm.
“So tell her,” Sherlock said, and edge to his voice. He cleared his throat to beat it down. “The truth.”
Sherlock scowled at him from the couch. “Nonsense, I was not
“Oh,” I gasped, from the words and from the touch.
impressively tall—
I gaped at him. “First?” I repeated.
Sherlock considered her for a moment. “Alright.”
“For…” I squinted.
The word stirred Anna to consciousness, her head pounding terribly from the blow Mary’s gun had inflicted. She looked up from the floor to see her mother’s blond hair whipping in the wind, the salty channel spray flying up the sides of the boat with every wave they hit. Mary was searching around frantically for something… and then she tossed the gun aside in anger.
“I suspected you’d be wanting new clothes,” said John, his voice an intrusion into Sherlock’s warm thoughts. He set down Sherlock’s bag of the few he’d had at the hospital. “I took the liberty of washing some of your laundry—it’s folded on the bed. I wasn’t sure where you liked to put them nowadays, and
Mycroft waited a moment, for a reaction that never came. “Erm… did you… hear me?”
“Molly,” Sherlock looked into her eyes, “wait for me here.” Molly’s eyes filled with tears yet again. “I
John stood still in the spot he’d stopped, a nasty feeling pooling in his chest. He watched Sherlock shrug off his coat and open a cupboard door, revealing a wardrobe with multiple lab coats hanging in a row. He searched through them with two fingers until he apparently found the one he was looking for, and pulled it off the hanger in a practiced motion. He turned to put it on his arms, and noticed that John was still standing there, and rolled his eyes. “If you’ve forgotten where the lab is, just say so.”
John was a little crazy.
John Watson had known a few people in his lifetime who, for whatever reason, excreted their own scent so strongly that it would permeate all types of fabrics and linger for hours in room after they were gone. John had dated at least one woman like that, that he could remember, and had thoroughly enjoyed being able to bury his nose into her pillow long after she’d left his bed.
Anna stared at him.
house—that John might come home tomorrow from work and smell it as he opened the door—elicited a little happy pang in his heart that he didn’t quite comprehend.
John stared at me. “You think that because you want to kiss me, that means you love me?”
“Yes,” I rasped. “Yes.”
Sherlock blinked at him. No, that wasn’t… that wasn’t right. Sherlock wasn’t a father, couldn’t be, he wasn’t capable of it. He’d raised Anna, yes, but John was always her father… according to what Sherlock had told her, anyway.
He waited outside the bathroom for close to thirty minutes before he heard the door open again. He looked up and saw John come out, closing the door behind him.
Carruthers’ eyes bugged out, his body convulsing as he choked.
“You may play with her when we return,” Sherlock retorted, sternly. “Now
you! After we had that talk and—“
Sherlock swallowed. “What if that ‘recklessness,’ as you call it, was what made me great? What if I can’t work any cases, anymore, because I’m just too… afraid?”
“Annalise, I know this is a lot of information,” Mycroft said, carefully. “But I need you to accept it, and move on. Because I must get to the present problem before Sherlock arrives home.”
?” Mycroft iterated, pushing Sherlock farther upright so that their eyes met.
Sherlock stepped backwards in reply.
In Sherlock’s periphery, he saw Anna glance back at them over her shoulder. “John, you don’t… I mean you’re not… moving
Sherlock took a deep breath. “It’s a long story,” he said, deflecting. “And you have to get to the cemetery.”
” Mary barked, and with another searing glare turned and rushed down the hall to Anna’s bedroom.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered, speeding up his hand. He could feel John’s fingers gripping the back of his shirt—they hadn’t quite been able to wait until they were completely naked, but they didn’t have to be, not right now, not for this.
The two of them were quiet for a few moments more, watching the baby being passed around from person to person, hearing the muffled “oohs” and “ahhs” and squeaky exclamations of how cute/beautiful/precious she was.
.” And when that was finished, John closed his eyes.
Molly shut her door and turned on the car. “The umbrella?!” she exclaimed, her eyes wide at Anna. “Do you think I give a bloody
is located. If you ever… and I mean ever… attempt to contact my daughter again, it will be the very last thing you do. Do I make myself clear?”
All of John’s muscles were still aching dully, and he closed his eyes, thinking that might help him relax against the pain. No, no, that seemed to make it worse. He opened them again and studied the seams between the bricks overhead. “The bomb,” he repeated, thickly. “Did… is Sherlock…”
Sherlock stood in the middle of the sitting room, his injured shoulder in a sling, looking very, very uncomfortable as John began to cry.
“I suppose you’ll take on that task?”
“You made a vow to them, John. That was never going to be easy, either. You ask me not to give up on us, but by that same logic, you can’t give up on them. That’s why you haven’t told her yet. You’re still trying to decide which life you want.” I took a deep breath. “I’m making it easy for you. Go back to your family. You owe it to Mary, to keep the promise you made on your wedd—“
. Sherlock took a deep breath. Not again. But it was too late, the fantasy was already there… Sherlock stood with one hand gripping the countertop, the other grasping his prick through the layers of his dressing gown and pants. He was still sensitive from last night’s antics… he groaned with the realization that he was going to have to masturbate
Lestrade inclined his head curtly, and hung up the phone. He got out of the chair and was just about to leave when he heard Sherlock bang on the glass. He turned back and saw the consulting detective mouth the words “Thank you,” through the transparent divide.
John moved to stand in front of him. “What the hell was that?” he asked. “How can she… what was she thinking?”
So John told him about Anna’s doctor appointment. He told him about all her new words. Told him about the walk they had in the park, she’d stepped in dog shit and he’d wiped it off her shoe with a tissue, his face scrunching up and him giving a great big “Yuck!” that caused Anna to belly-laugh for the first time ever, and he just kept saying it over and over, and she kept laughing, and he didn’t want to stop. About his fight with Mary over visiting Harry again; he didn’t want to do it, but Mary thought they should give her another chance.
“It will get better, you know. It fades away.”
“No.” Sherlock spun around, his voice overwhelmed by sarcasm. “No, John, I’m not upset. I’m never upset. I’m a sociopath, I don’t feel anything.
“I can’t—“
“Put the gun down, Mary,” Sherlock ordered.
Bullets pelted the observation deck’s windows, and Moriarty and Mary could no longer be seen. The mountain man escaped through the floor entry of the inner glass room and locked the door behind him.
“But that…” John started, in awe. “Why, that’s over five miles!”
“Oh my God.” Mary dropped her drink, didn’t flinch as the stem broke from the base and the champagne inside splashed across the floor.
Sherlock sat across from him and leaned forward, his eyes bright. “Do you remember how we decided that Mary’s endgame must be personal?”
Mycroft looked up at his brother in confusion. “Tossing wh—“ He stopped abruptly, and his eyes grew wide and his face white. “NO!” His voice crackled with rage. “NO! STOP HER!” He rounded frantically on Sherlock and John, knowing full well that they were as powerless as he. “Tell her to stop!”
guard—but he did see her kill the one Sherlock was fighting. She came up from behind just as the man was about to deal Sherlock a heavy blow, launching herself into the air like some feral animal, snarling and spitting as she clutched the guard’s shoulders and slid the knife swiftly across his throat. The guard fell backwards, trapping Anna underneath him, and Sherlock heaved himself up from the ground to lift the body off of her. She stood up again and caught John’s face, frozen in horror. It was so jarring that Anna felt as if she’d been slapped. “I…” she started, suddenly wanting to explain herself, but not knowing why, or how.
“Sherlock?” It was Molly, pushing open his door a little further. He hadn’t realized she was still in the flat.
, Sherlock thought.
“You made one too,” John whispered.
“Which is absolutely preposterous,” Sherlock pointed out. “Please, John, as if you could have seen the future. As if you knew this would happen.”
, Sherlock realized.
“To you as well,” said John. “I can’t believe you walked here. You could have called, or waited for the weather to clear, or—“
Ella recorded his answer. “Have you
All she could do now was hope to God that at the end of the day, Sherlock and Anna came home alive.
“’Succession,’” Sherlock pronounced for her, finally extracting the money and handing it to the man behind the stand. “It means, something that comes after.”
killing, Anna? You like how powerful it makes you feel, taking the most important thing from another human being? It’s a bit like playing God, isn’t it?” He smiled and stepped away. “In that case, I’m going to give you a little welcome present. For the prodigal daughter.” He nodded to the guards behind Anna, and they disappeared for a moment. Then Anna heard scuffling behind her, and she turned around.
Here we go...
A bright light hit the prisoner’s face, making his eyes squint and water. He put up a hand to shield them from the glare.
As John’s body warmed and his mind calmed he began to think of things again, those things that had nothing to do with survival. About being alone in the woods and how Sherlock had come after he’d promised not to. How John was already saving him again just like he always saved him, he always did, and maybe this had been Sherlock’s plan, to put himself in mortal danger and have John save him. It was something he would do. John tried not to believe it but he couldn’t help wondering if it was true and if Sherlock had walked across the ice on purpose. “You’re an idiot,” he mumbled. “If you did that, you’re an idiot.” He tightened his hold around Sherlock’s arms. He decided not to ask him about it later. He didn’t want to know.
Ella’s eyes sparkled. “Well, just goes to show that we can deduce anything we want about other people, but when it comes to ourselves, even the best of us are blind.” She smiled. “I certainly had no idea that my lack of jewelry so blatantly exposed my feminism. Here I thought I just hadn’t had time to put it on this morning.”
Sherlock dropped the piece of cloth as he felt the world start to dissolve, and he sank, weakly, to his knees. “All right,” said Lestrade, from out of nowhere. It hadn’t occurred to Sherlock that the rest of the police crew had been watching him. “That’s enough.”
He just looked so sad, and defeated, that I didn’t know what to do to change his mind. It wasn’t going to be like that. I wasn’t going to just ignore him as he hung around me like an abused puppy waiting for table scraps. (Well, maybe if there was a
“Is that your

.” Molly turned back to John. “
John looked toward the door, and as he did so, spotted two ibuprofen and a glass of water on his nightstand. He stared at them for a second. “Sherlock,” he croaked, feeling guilty and grateful at the same time. He reached over, grabbed the pills, and swallowed them with a gulp of water. He laid back down and closed his eyes, dizzy from the movement.
, she thought to herself as she raced up the steps of 221B. She dropped her backpack on the ground as soon as she passed through the front door, flopped on the couch with a satisfying “
, pure and simple. These were crimes of passion, not selfless sacrifice.” He smirked. “It just so happens that John’s passion took the form of mutilation and torture, where yours was a simple shot to the head.”
Sherlock dodged his open palm. “Did you tell Mary?”
“None,” Sherlock confirmed, looking a little relieved.
. He gritted his teeth and slid his hand along the shaft, faster now, but he couldn’t bring himself past the plateau.
John’s mouth dropped open. “Jesus, Sherlock. I’m so sorry.”
Anna scoffed. “I take offense to that! I’ll have you know I’ve grown a whole inch since last month.”
But then she’d gone and given it all up.
Mycroft was extremely calm as he watched her struggle. “What just happened, Anna? Tell me everything.”
Sherlock took a deep breath. “John, you can’t stay here.”
John thought bitterly.
I actually really like my parents.
John’s eyes were misting. “Probably true,” he agreed. Then, “You didn’t… I mean, you didn’t really feel nothing when… when we…”
“I’m going to give my statement to the police,” Sherlock tried again. “About what happened at the Carruthers’.”
Sherlock continued cutting into the fisherman. “Anna. What did she tell you last night? About what’s been going on with her?”
“Will this help?” asked Anna, after he was gone. She was rustling around for something.
“I told you, I want to be there. When is it?”
All was quiet save for the crackling of the fire. A log fell against the door with a soft thump and sparks flared up behind the glass. The afternoon shadows were long and getting longer.
“And who’s in this band with you?” he quizzed.
. Gotten himself a jacket like that. He eyed John’s pockets enviously.
.” She smirked and glanced at Moriarty’s mutilated face. “Now,” she said, pointing her gun in Anna’s direction, “go and kneel between your fathers.”
He picked up his cup and took a sip, then walked back down the hallway and around the corner to the door of the observation room. He took a deep breath, and entered.
“I want you to... suck it.” It was a phrase I had learned from him. I’d always found that sort of talk too vulgar to be arousing, but with John... well. Things were different with John. He’d used it, earlier in the week, and I’d had a... let’s just say, a
Anna sat stunned, holding both hands on the steering wheel even though the car was parked.
And then he was asleep.
(Also, no offence to Pembridge Palace whatsoever, I just did a quick internet search for a cheap hotel in London that wasn't too far from Baker Street.)
There were no tracks.
, thought Sherlock,
Sherlock was sitting on the ground, his back to the wall, his face on his knees and his arms folded over the back of his head. There was a woman sitting on the edge of the bathtub across from him, dressed in a tan suit, and another police officer standing behind her with a notebook open and pen poised to write. The woman turned to look at them as they entered, and got up off the tub. “It’s not a good time,” she told them, attempting to usher them back out. “I need a moment to—“
) was out of the question. She looked helplessly at Mycroft. “I don’t know,” she said, upset.
“Yes, John.”
… Bloody
Sherlock left them and strode over to where Anna was playing as Lestrade looked up at the other girls for confirmation. “She wants the ‘meat’ or something,” explained the oldest. “She’s a bit of a weirdo,” she complained, lowering her voice.
“I’ll get the drapes,” said Anna, going to the window.
Mary stared at him for a moment, then sighed and shook her head. “A bit less enthusiastic next time, darling, hm?”
During all this time, Sherlock had only watched, his body still rigid and hands poised over the keyboard.
“Yeah, that’s why I took you out tonight. So we could have The Talk.”
He pulled away abruptly, and the room spun. If it wasn’t for the scurvy, I’d have thought I was having a swoon.
I weighed my options. I could tell him the truth, that I “wasn’t in the mood,” and watch his fragile confidence crumble behind his polite and stolid mask. Or, alternatively, I could put up with it for a short time and then he would be happy and satisfied leave me alone for another few days.
“Tell me something, Sherlock,” Mycroft asked, sitting on the edge of his desk and crossing his ankles. “Do you approve of what they did? Do you support it?”
John was quiet, staring at Sherlock again.
“The poor girl,” John continued, shaking his head, “doesn’t she know by now…”
Sherlock took a deep breath. “She’s alive.”
, he said to himself. But he seemed to have hit a wall.
Sherlock clenched his jaw.
“You didn’t,” I said, quickly. “You couldn’t. I was wrong.”
Once he’d lowered himself into the water and laid his head back on the towel, he began to digest the recent turn of events.
. If you’re really that worried, then it’s probably
The other receptionist quickly opened the note, and read it aloud:
Somehow, Anna knew. It wasn’t that she remembered the woman’s hair, or her eyes, or the sound of her voice. She’d been too young, to still remember those things. No, she knew because of the way the woman was looking at her, like she’d been thirsty for ages, and had just come upon a pristine pool of water, and was desperately hoping it was not a mirage.
kitchen. John pushing him up against the edge of the countertop, John’s hands on his face and running through his hair, kissing him deeply. Sherlock licked his lips and squeezed his cock, imagining John rubbing their groins together, feeling John’s erection on his own through their trousers.
wondering if you were going to live or die. Even if she didn’t one-hundred-percent deserve some time off, I doubt she’d be able to focus on her studies right now. For God’s
“But—“ John began to protest.
“I didn’t tell you, because I didn’t want to—“ he smiled a little, bitterly “—scare you off. I knew that you were going to need some time to adjust to everything. Putting you in the middle of a marriage, that’s a lot of pressure, you know. I figured you’d have a hard enough time coming to terms with just being in a relationship, period.” He looked up at me, finally. “Guess I called it.”
Lestrade sighed heavily and continued. “They had this room…” Donovan fumed at him and marched down the hallway, muttering obscenities under her breath. “It was like some sort of torture chamber. I dunno…” He ran a hand through his hair. “When I went in, Sherlock was chained to the wall. He…” Lestrade’s eyes had a faraway look. “He called me ‘Greg.’”
“You’re not gonna say somethin’?” John asked now, lifting the half-filled glass to his lips. “I ‘pologized for s’this,” he pointed at the carpet.
daughter, too, and Sherlock was probably just bringing her round for a “Merry Christmas” courtesy visit. He and Sherlock hadn’t worked out how it would go, them sharing her—but it was just like Sherlock to come up with a plan of his own and carry it out without including John.
John tipped the bottle, roughly, into his glass. Whiskey splashed onto the carpet before John got the right angle to pour it in. “Whoops!” he exclaimed, the word slurring out of his lips. He looked up at Sherlock. “Sorry ‘mbout chur… rug,” he said, then giggled at how poorly he’d articulated those words.
Moriarty grinned again. “How adorable you really are, John! Nice try, but unfortunately for you, Sherlock is not a sociopath. In fact, he’s the farthest thing from it. His emotions are so intense, that he is afraid of what they can do to him. They’re so cripplingly powerful that he’s tried to train himself to avoid them altogether. Tried and failed, I might add.” Moriarty cocked his head to one side and looked at Sherlock with mock concern. “Isn’t that right, honey?”
John watched the steaming milk squirt into the pail. He’d not expected Sherlock to last so long out at the woodpile alone. He admired his dedication. In the old days Sherlock would have thrown a tantrum by now. He would have stomped all the way into the barn and demanded John do whatever it was he came here to ask him to do. Move back to London or help him with a case or however he wanted to phrase it. He wouldn’t have stooped to such tedious work for this length of time.
The dog was a bird dog and so was very energetic but very loyal and it followed John everywhere. But always at a distance. Its breed had been trained to zig zag back and forth over a large area to investigate the possibility of a bird nest. If it found one it would immediately stop and go very still facing the direction of the nest and sometimes it would even lift up a front paw in a true “point.” So when John went for his walks, as he did often at the beginning, the dog would be running back and forth through the trees and when they came to the pond it would run willfully ahead, around the perimeter. Except for during the winter; when the snow came and the pond froze over for the first time, the dog ran into the forest and out across the frozen pond instead.
“I can’t call Lestrade, because then Sherlock will get into trouble—like,
It had been earlier, when they were gearing up for the raid. Sherlock had been off across the way, verbally abusing Anderson for not setting up the surveillance cameras correctly, and John had pulled Lestrade aside. “If something goes wrong,” he’d muttered, low and close to the Detective Inspector’s ear, “promise me you’ll protect him.”
. The sound of water dripping was the first thing John noticed. He struggled to open his eyes, but they seemed to be swollen shut; in fact, his entire body seemed to be swollen stiff. He breathed heavily onto the cold, hard ground, his thoughts and reason sharpening back to existence. He wasn’t dead, that much was certain, but he needed to determine just how injured he was. He started by attempting to wiggle his fingers and toes.
.” He strode back to Anna and grabbed her by the collar, dragging her out from the line to face Sherlock and John on the ground. “But how do I decide which one lives, and which one dies? They both have their good and bad qualities, to be sure… yet if I really think about it, it shouldn’t be up to me to decide;
. “What family is that, Harriet?” he asked, smoothly. “Your parents have been long dead, Mary’s as well, and Mary has no siblings or family of any kind. That only leaves—“
“But that’s clearly not true.”
I sucked his neck again and said, “I’m going to fuck you so hard, you won’t be able to walk.”
“No, you don’t,” he said to me, his smile dropping away abruptly.
“Because I want to hear your side of the story,” said Ella. “So, tell me, what happened after you rinsed him off?”
“Why?” asked Ella.
John whirled and caught the hint of a smile crossing Sherlock’s expression. Gently poking fun, attempting to make light… that was usually John’s job, and he felt guilty that Sherlock had been forced into it, yet again. He sighed and reluctantly plunked down next to his friend. “I hate this, Sherlock,” he muttered, his hands smoothing the tender flesh over his cheeks. “I hate that I can’t do anything.”
“But you just said—you’ve never—that it wasn’t about
“But you’re not angry with me.”
John began to cry.
The three adults drew in three sharp breaths, and none knew what to say. Mary suddenly turned to her husband, a warning look in her eye. “Yes, why not indeed?” she inquired.
John picked up the left piece and heaved it into the wheelbarrow and picked up the right and set it back on the stump, angling it just so to make sure it would receive the head of the axe at the right spot. In the beginning it had taken some time to learn where the cut would be placed, not only because John was unfamiliar with the weight and length of the axe and the size of his arc, but because, as a man who had spent his life in the city, he’d not practice aiming an axe before. There was much cursing and soreness the first few weeks as John learned how to swing and what muscles to use and which not to, and how to strengthen them and how to take all the training he’d had as a surgeon and a marksman and channel it into the act of chopping wood.
who should have said something! Mr. ‘Love is the greatest human weakness.’ What would have been the point of me confessing my feelings to a man who was anti-love?”
.” John shook his head, his expression full of pity. “You’re so bloody
Ella nodded. Then she rounded on John, abruptly. “And now,” she said to him, “I really am going to ask you to leave the room.” John blinked at her, turned back to Sherlock, who gave him no acknowledgement, so he picked up his jacket and waited out in the hall for them to finish.
She was still standing, Moriarty’s corpse lying in front of her, continuing to bleed from its (now unrecognizable) face onto the ground. And the guard who had been aiming his gun at her, he was also lying on ground, his eyes open and lifeless. Anna turned around to see Sherlock and John, who were both still on their knees, both blinking wildly at the dead bodies of the guards who had guns to
“Would you have?” Sherlock challenged. “Would you, Mycroft? After what Carruthers did?”
Sherlock finished climbing the stairs and stood in front of John’s view of the bedroom. John’s gaze remained where it was as he shook his head. “Bloody hell,” he swore, quietly. “She lives here. You…”
he thought to himself.
. He heard Anna bustling about with the tea and smiled warmly in her direction; seeing her back in the flat made him happier than he could have imagined.
John’s lips curved up. “She’s a liar, that one.” He shook his head. “Trouble, is what she is. We’ve had quite a time dealing with it.” He didn’t seem to be upset—on the contrary, he seemed rather proud.
Sherlock immediately noticed her distress. “What?” he asked.
Mycroft’s eyes softened. “No, not until just before he was killed.”
I felt a bit prickly. Hadn’t I explained my emotions enough, for one day? I didn’t even fully understand them yet, myself. “Can’t we just kiss? Actions are louder than words, you know.”
She couldn’t be alive. John knew this because he had seen it happen. He had seen her in front of him sitting on the floor and had heard her crying and seen her reaching to be picked up by the woman who then shot her with the gun she had been pointing at John just before. The woman he was married to but wasn’t really married to because she didn’t exist. The woman standing there killing his daughter with a gun was someone he didn’t know at all who only vaguely resembled the woman who had saved him while Sherlock was pretending to be dead. And after she pulled the trigger and his daughter’s blood was on the floor and his daughter laying in it, silent in a way she had never been, after that the woman looked most completely like a stranger.
Sherlock stared straight ahead. “No.”
I liked pleasing him, I did. I liked the way he responded when I touched him, or made a sound, or said something explicit. The first time I put my mouth on the head of his cock, he let out a whine so unabashed that I couldn’t help grinning with pride around him. If John was pleased, that meant I was proficient; if he was blown away (so to speak), that meant I was stellar. And if I was stellar, in every facet of our life together, he would never want to leave.
“Touch me,” Sherlock ordered, and felt John startle beneath him. “Come on, doctor,” he growled, his own voice unrecognizable to him, “show me what’s good for my health.”
John clenched his teeth together. “What are you doing?”
“The bruises are symmetrical,” Anderson said suddenly. All our faced turned to his. He was staring down at the body, and went over to it, pointing. “Look. Here, and here, on his neck. Three finger-shaped bruises, on either side.”
The teacher clapped her hands together and addressed the students. “Everyone, this is Mr. Watson. Children, say ‘Hello—‘“
. He doesn’t want to bloody
They’d all three come back to 221B, him, John, and Anna, the following Sunday. Sherlock tasked Anna to help him climb out of the car (he was still a bit weak and unsteady) but John overrode him, telling her to go put the kettle on. Anna trotted upstairs as John smiled and laced his arm through Sherlock’s. But once he was standing, Sherlock pulled away. “I think I can take it from here,” he said, slowly walking across the sidewalk.
Sherlock clutched John’s face and gazed into his eyes. There was an intensity there—John was hesitant to call it fear, but there was no other name… desperation, maybe. “I… please, John.”
“It was true, though,” said John, not yet acknowledging the apology. “I suppose I
, thought Sherlock.
Anna whooped again, and Mary’s eyes twinkled. “Happy New Year, Sherlock,” she said, and Sherlock cleared his throat to politely wish her one as well.
“Have you gone to the police, Mrs. Smith?”
Sherlock whipped around to see what was the matter, and saw that the body on the table wasn’t a fisherman….
John felt something constrict in his chest. It was the tightening of panic and fear like when Sherlock had fallen through the frozen pond, but it was also something else that John could not name. He ran and made the turn around the trees, and then the thing in his chest squeezed so hard that his heart ceased to beat. He looked down the road, and stopped.
, Sherlock thought, excitedly. He rang the bell.
“I know, love.”
“Sher…” John mumbled, lifting his hand to Sherlock’s shoulder. Then he proceeded to vomit again, the sick dribbling down his chin.
That was questionable. “Of course not! That doesn’t sound like me.”
again and again. “Sherlock?” he called, and squinted at him in the darkness.
“No!” John roared, and lurched forward, and as he reached out to try to grab his hand the ice broke under his elbows and he sunk in belly first.
left that life, that danger, behind. They’d had to... he glanced down on the floor, where Anna was stacking puzzle pieces one on top of the other, not understanding how they actually worked. He looked back at Mary and, with reluctance, nodded.
“What?” I was annoyed that she was dismissing my problem as unworthy of her time. “Sex and feelings ruining genius intellect? Call me crazy but I figured that'd be right up your street.”
John looked silly with embarrassment. He scratched the back of his head. “Yes?”
I pushed a second finger inside.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock couldn’t figure it out. His brain was too busy trying to process that he lived in a world where John still existed. “You stay there,” he said, warningly.
It had snowed again during the night. John knew not just from the evidence that morning but from the fact that he had seen the snow coming down for himself.
“And then he…” Sherlock paused. “Why are you asking me, if John’s already told you?” he asked, suspiciously.
Sherlock averted his eyes. “Well, there I can’t help you. I didn’t have much of a ‘normal’ teenage experience, either.”
“Oh, goodness no, Sherlock doesn’t solve crimes anymore,” replied Mrs. Hudson, drying her hands on a dish towel. “Not like he used to, anyway.”
Sherlock slid his hand from her chin farther up her face, cradling it. He put his other hand through the space between her waist and arm, spreading it wide on the small of her back and pulling her the tiniest bit closer. He kissed her again, and she made a small sound in the back of her throat.
Carruthers choked out a fresh wave of sobs, moaning the word “
“You’ve never done this before,” I finished for him. I sat back again.
them… so she is upset that you killed them.”
Lestrade was resting against the wall, his hands in his pockets, staring down at the grain of the wooden floor. He’d been looking at the lines for a while now, following as they broke out from each other and then connected again. He wished the whole floor was one continuous grain of wood, and that he could watch it for hours, and push the events of the last day from his mind.
John snorted from his chair. “Probably when she found out you infested the building with ants.”
Anna was a little disappointed. She expected to be taught how to use crazy gadgets, dress up in disguises, that sort of thing. Spy stuff. James Bond. But she supposed that learning how to use weapons was part of that. “Do I get my own gun?” she asked.
to know,” he sighed, and sat up again. “Let’s try a different question. Why, if you like men, are you sexually attracted to your female, teenage babysitter? That one is certainly puzzling me, at the moment.”
Sherlock continued to peer at him over his hands, not saying anything.
The girl was shot in the same place that Mary had shot Sherlock; it was a message, and one specifically for him. To frighten him. And it had certainly done that, had made him decide to go after them—
“Bye,” Sherlock murmured. They got into a cab; Mary pushed Anna in first, then stood up and looked back at him as if she wanted to say something… but instead, she turned and ducked inside. Sherlock saw Anna wave at him out the back window—he brought a hand up and slowly returned the gesture.
Sherlock didn’t look up, and John couldn’t tell for sure.
Sherlock moved the black body bag aside to reveal a small, intricately-placed bullet hole in the chest, right next to the young girl’s heart.
“Sherlock.” John had caught up to me. “Just calm down.”
“Actually,” Carruthers shifted in his seat, “she hadn’t met Max yet. We never bring him to the interviews, you see—we’re very careful because he gets attached very quickly.” He smiled again. “He’s the most loving, trusting child you’ve ever met. I’m sure he and Violet would have got on splendidly.”
to talk?”
"Not far," said Anna, and the three of them went up to the flat.
“Then isn’t it worth it,” she continued, “to risk his getting in trouble with the police, if it would mean saving him?”
“What’s going on?” John asked, sounding quite puzzled. “Is this about—“
“You can let go now,” said John finally, looking down.
Sherlock stared at him for a moment more, then turned back to his computer. “You should go to bed, John.”
Something didn’t smell right.
with you? And seriously,
“Waiting for our extraction, of course.” Mary left John’s side to lean back against the wall across from him. “The trapdoor in your room led under the building, and there was a sewer access point not far down. Moriarty had me pull you down here, before the bomb went off. Got you out just in the nick of time, too,” she added, as if she expected some sort of thanks.

when he’d thought that
“That’s okay,” said John, continuing to stroke Polly’s back. She curled up in his lap, content, and yawned. “Don’t normally like cats.”
Sherlock’s eyes blinked open. He hadn’t made the connection, hadn’t thought about how John must have reacted in a similar fashion when he’d believed Sherlock dead… the thought put a funny feeling in his stomach. He suddenly was no longer hungry for pastries.
“How?”
Sherlock sat up, took a few deep breaths, then lifted his hands into John’s. John caught a glimpse of the deep ligature wounds on his wrists as his shirtsleeves slid back.
Molly opened her mouth, but no sound came out.
Sherlock’s face remained impassive. “Do as he says, Anna,” he said, turning toward her.
“Sherlock.” John tried to meet his eyes, but couldn’t. “I…” He was struggling for something to say.
Sherlock sat back and put his feet up on the table. “You may continue.” He smiled.
“You’ve surprised me, Molly,” he said, walking past her to sit down in John’s chair. He crossed his legs and looked up at her with his usual smirk. “I never would have thought that you’d be the first to figure it out.”
John chuckled once. Sherlock’s eyes reflected gold sunlight and he sat up and ran a hand through his hair. It was matted to the side of his head that had been resting on his arm.
Explain what? “I thought ‘I want to kiss you again’ was pretty straightforward.”
Sherlock laughed to himself, as if he had a secret. He sat up and continued to smile fondly at Anna. She looked up at him, and smiled back.
“Then where will
“But something must have gone wrong,” John continued, noting the intensity of Sherlock’s stare. “I never heard from her after that. When they finally moved me into my cell, Moriarty came to see me and suggested that he knew Mary and I were conspiring…. He never gave any specifics, so I don’t know if he knew the details of her plan. But he was at least suspicious, which would have been enough for anyone in that position to…” John bit his lip. “Two years came and went, and I assumed he had her killed. I didn’t know what else to think, I didn’t know what Moriarty’s plan was, I didn’t know if Mary had gotten the chance to tell you I was alive, didn’t know if I was ever going to see you again…” he trailed off, feeling his throat tighten at the memory. "But if she is alive... she can help us, Sherlock."
“Oh,” I exhaled, as his hand made contact with my skin. I curled forward, over him, my head lolling over his shoulder. I turned my face to his neck as he stroked upward. “Oh.”
John stopped chewing. “Newest? There’s been another body?”
Lestrade smiled, knowingly. “Oh Sherlock, you’re still the smartest damn man in the country. Maybe even the world. I’m sure you’ll find a way to keep solving crimes and step up the game on personal safety. Get a little creative, will you?”
I shook my head and attempted a smile. “Thought you’d do that, Doctor.”
“Stop!” Sherlock yelped, pulling his legs back. Then he looked at John and smiled, registering his words. John smiled back, and Sherlock felt a fluttering in his stomach.
“Anna told me you were here,” John said, by way of explanation. “She… I thought I should, you know, say hello.”
Moriarty placed the crown on his head and smiled a wicked smile. “I’m going to show them all who’s king,” he told her.
, he thought.
Sherlock gaped at him, in shock, not quite believing it.
Sherlock nodded, still put off by their exchange. “Oh—yes. Certainly.”
Molly studied him for a moment. “Would you like a cup of tea?” she asked, almost forgetting her good manners again.
“Oh my
Sherlock looked a bit guilty and didn’t reply.
Though she knew she could do it, Anna didn’t want to lie to Sherlock. But, as Mycroft had logically explained, Sherlock would never give his consent to let her spy on Moriarty.
He didn’t think John knew about that. That he’d gotten sick. It wasn’t the blood that did it, of course. It was the fact that he was utterly unable to do anything; despite that big brain of his, all he could do was just stand there watching Mary die. He’d failed, his vow was broken, utterly

, more like. Isn’t that true, Anna?”
Hours later, when John finally woke up, Sherlock couldn’t even look at him. He heard him stumble to the toilet, heard some rustling around, heard him come down the stairs,
“I don’t think I should—”
Sherlock had done his best to delete the memory. He retained the knowledge that it happened, but without the actual details—the ones that were coming back, now. John’s fingertips making smudges on the glass. His breath circling a fog round his mouth as he said Sherlock’s name. The screams, the blood, as he was being beaten, and the utter hopelessness that Sherlock had felt. The
After Sherlock had gathered several samples from the bodies and had gone up to the lap, Molly’s contented mood faded away. She put down her scalpel and took off her gloves, and, sitting on the floor where not even a week ago she and Sherlock had rested after making love, she put her head in her hands and cried for her broken heart.
he thought to himself, before he was too distracted by physical pleasure to care.
Somehow (hard to believe, I know), he’d found the contradiction. I ground my teeth together in frustration. “I don’t want any of this anymore. How do I make that clear to you?” I stepped toward him, vehement. “I want you to leave. I want you to leave, and not come back, and I never want to see you again. I want to forget you ever existed. How do I make that clear?” My voice was booming now. Probably all the neighbors could hear. “I don’t want you to wait, I don’t want you to try and convince me, I don’t want it, any of it.” I was spitting, practically snarling.
Memories of last night suddenly flooded back to him. Sherlock putting him in the tub, Sherlock holding him, undressing him, John’s head buried in Sherlock’s neck, the way Sherlock’s shirtsleeves were soaked through and his hair and face were damp from the shower spray… and then, the kiss.
Sherlock pushed back from the microscope, obviously at his wit’s end. “There’s nothing here!” he seethed.
Anna’s mind raced. How did Moriarty know who these people were? How did he find them? What had he done to them? Anna’s eyes settled on David’s, and she felt paralyzed with fear.
. And you want me to be
Sherlock didn’t reply.
“I dunno,” Anna began. “All my life, whenever I talked to you, I called you ‘Dad.’”
“What?” Carruthers asked, confused.
The criminal came and put his mouth right over her ear, so that she felt his hot, damp breath on her face. “Because I

make sensible comments,
“Then why won’t you?”
Anna quietly moved over to the couch and opened up her fiddle case. She pulled out the instrument and bow and stood next to Sherlock, noticing his eyes glancing her way as she raised it under her chin. She began to play, and though she’d never much liked violin music, and didn’t know the tune, she found that her band practices had significantly improved her accompaniment skills.
Suddenly, John was leaning down next to me. His shoulder pressed against mine, his hands on his knees. “What do you see?” he murmured gently, right next to my face. I swallowed and glanced at him. He was smirking, clearly one hundred percent aware that he was turning me on just by being close to me.
John pulled away and looked down at Sherlock’s chest.
, when the time came.
I was stunned. Yes! Brilliant!
She made her way to sit next to him, and began to tell a story.
Sherlock righted the bottle and carefully set it back on the table. “For what, exactly? For being
Fact #2: He wanted the sex part, too.
“Baker Street, and the cases, and Mycroft and Moriarty, and even Mary, that was all because of me. Because you met me. Do you deny it?”
“Oh,” John cried, because it hurt. It probably hurt a lot. He was so tight, and the spittle was not enough, and it was nothing at all like the last time we’d done this. In fact, he was probably still sore, from the last time. “Oh, yes, God.”
I righted my head and kissed him with my mouth open and my head tilted sideways, the way I knew he liked. I slid my hand down his belly and over the front of his trousers, squeezing his erection. He groaned softly and licked my tongue with his. He’d had leftover curry for lunch—not a pleasing second-hand flavor. I pulled back to get away from it and dropped down to my knees, unbuttoning his flies as I went. I’d discovered that fellatio was the easiest way to please him without showing how unaroused I was. It was quick, and relatively painless, and there was little mess to clean afterward. And I could tell him I’d orgasmed in my trousers (eager virgin, and all that) so that he wouldn’t try to reciprocate. I’d done this the last three times he’d propositioned me, and it had worked flawlessly.
Sherlock let the map fall to his side with his hand. “You said, ‘Let’s meet somewhere this time.’”
“Took the words right from my mouth!” Mary growled behind him. “What the hell did you do?”
Immediately when John left the cabin he could tell that the storm was coming. The air was cold and dry, and the wind had barely begun to blow. The sky was too dark for that time of morning, even with the cloud cover. The clouds were moving quickly above him.
Anna swallowed and wondered what had happened to her in there. She’d stabbed that man with no hesitation, even though she knew it was practice, that the man wasn’t an attacker but an employee of the British government, there to help teach her. Yet her instinct was to brutally stab him. A kill stab. She was capable of killing someone. The thought frightened her… but it also made her feel a bit powerful.
John’s mouth fell open a little. “I…”
Sherlock wanted to cry out, for “help,” for “no,” for “stop,” or just for a wordless yell against what was happening—but he kept silent.
—what happens if you’re injured or, God forbid,
John’s eyes widened in panic.
Anna snorted and drained her teacup. Mrs. Hudson giggled as well, from the kitchen. “What?” Sherlock asked. “What are you all laughing at?”
Mary let out a loud breath of frustration. “John, you’ve got to stop looking at this as helping
John’s eyes flew to Sherlock’s. He looked sheepish, expectant, worried. “Has he, now?”
. I can’t do that to him.”
and Sherlock remained silent, his narrow, ice-like eyes fixed on Anna’s round, deep, dark ones. Somehow, Anna didn’t think this was part of Plan B, anymore. She felt a coldness overcome her, a cold blanket of
John sighed, continuing to massage Sherlock’s head. “To see my parents, for Christmas. They weren’t able to make it to the wedding, you know, and now with the baby… they want us to come stay with them for a couple weeks.”
“Yes,” John said again. His mouth was right by my ear, he spoke very softly into it. His voice sounded like sex. And the jingling of the belt, hitting his body as I thrust my hips toward him, the rustling of our shirts, and trousers, the breathing, mine and his both. It all sounded like sex. A sex symphony. (Ugh. See what I mean about the metaphors?)
. She was referencing the Agra treasure.”
The children didn’t really care, not when they were really small, but the parents cared. They cared that they had to endure Sherlock’s presence, a man who was shifty-eyed, overly-observant, had absolutely zero filter, would somehow know their innermost secrets and discuss them openly as if he were talking about the weather. Before long the parents were gossiping amongst themselves, complaining about him: “Oh God, another play-date. I’ll go just as long as Sherlock Holmes isn’t going to be there. Last time he talked to me for a half hour about how you could tell a person’s life story from their wristwatch. Their
“Alright,” I said, instead.
But Mary was still pointing both guns, livid with the turn of events.
“No you didn’t,” I said, trying to look anywhere but at him.
John immediately looked to Sherlock, who was heading to the kitchen with their drinking equipment, thinking he would turn around and say
Anna swallowed. “My father.”
“Sherlock’s too into this case to pay attention.”
Sherlock’s insides twisted as he was struck by a thought: if John had chosen
John knew he should be feeling pity, sympathy, heartbreak—but all he felt was a mind-numbing loathing, for the people who had done this. And guilt. That too.
, I thought.
Apparently the door opened to the small, chain-linked area where they kept the bins. I looked around for a way back to the street, and saw that there was a gate—which was padlocked. I jiggled the lock roughly, but it didn’t budge. I banged on the fence in frustration.
Sherlock watched him concentrate on the laces far more than he needed to. “John, I... I’m sorry.”
Molly swallowed again, her mouth gone dry. “He was training her. To… to spy, on Moriarty.”
“Y-yes, sir,” said David.
I felt the giddiness bubbling up again—but now that I was paying attention, there was indeed something else. More than just caffeine. Something I couldn’t compare to any drug I’d ever tried. And whatever it was, it made me forget myself just enough to try and name it.
Mycroft was up out of his chair in a flash, moving faster than Sherlock would have given him credit for. He reached out to grab Sherlock by the wrist, intent on keeping him in the room—but Sherlock yelped in pain, and his brother snapped his hand back as if he’d touched a snake. Sherlock clutched his ligatured wrist in his other hand trying to rub away the sting.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered into the empty flat, trying the sound of it. He wrapped the blanket tighter around himself and closed his eyes, imagining saying it to John’s face. “I love you, John.” And then he felt a warmth in the center of his chest, a tickling sensation that spread out from its point of origin and reached the tips of his fingers and toes in no time.
“Just not to me.”
“I’m sorry, John.”
What I needed to do was convince him of my feelings, separate from my physical desires. In short, to put five years of subconscious emotion into perfect words. No problem, right?
After John had left, I’d made a plan for the next day. I would sit down with him, like a normal human being, and have a discussion about what we were supposed to do now. I’d never had a relationship before, and I wasn’t sure I would be good at it. I wasn’t even sure what it would look like, if it could work, in the conventional way that relationships worked. But we needed to talk about it. We needed to, or otherwise things would just go unsaid, and fester, the way they had previously. When John had supposedly loved me. For years.
, Sherlock,” a voice spoke from the doorway. “Romancing poor Molly when your daughter remains God-knows-where after running away from home? Shame on you.”
, and this thing, it might actually be
John raised his eyebrows.
“I don’t—“ John was clearly overwhelmed. “Look, Sherlock, it’s pouring out, and I—let’s go inside before we get drenched.”
The most bizarre thing about it was seeing John at the hospital the next day. Sherlock had felt shy, of all things, something he hadn’t felt since he was a child. He was keenly aware of everything he said, wondering how it sounded, if John would know, if he would figure it out.
John sniffed and tucked the gun into the back of his trousers, then moved to squat over the rapists’ mutilated kneecaps. He stuck his hand in his jacket and pulled out a pocket knife. “I imagine you’re in quite a bit of pain right now,” he remarked, calmly, flicking the blade open and using the tip of it to point down at Carruthers’ knees. Carruthers moaned incoherently, and John nodded. “Quite a bit,” he echoed. He paused then, staring at the torn flesh below him, and twisted his head to catch Carruthers’ eye, making sure he was paying attention. “That, down there? That’s nothing.” John shook his head, to prove that it was so. “Nah, that’s nothing compared to what I’m about to do.”
However, as recent events had proven, the treasure was still within Mycroft’s grasp. When Sherlock had come to him and told him as much, Mycroft was beside himself with excitement. If he got the treasure, perhaps he could redeem his name within the government circles. He then had two goals in mind: to bring down Moriarty, and to reclaim the treasure. Well, one of those things had happened— and the other one was just a few boat-lengths away.
He’d planned to do it after he’d met with Sherlock’s parents, he really had, but Mary had discouraged him on the ride home. “Don’t do this,” she’d said. “We’ve finally gotten to a good place, you and I. We’re happy in our little life together, with our daughter, in our home. It’s peaceful, it’s normal. And we love each other, John. Neither of us is perfect, but we’ve learned to live with that.”
I stared down at him. “What?”
“I asked you,
” John’s voice squeaked. “Maybe

“No,” I muttered.
“Since you texted me and asked me to!” Sherlock was growing annoyed, bordering on embarrassed.
,” he breathed.
“Mary. You’re looking lovely.”
John looked at the telly, where Sally Donovan was telling the reporters that she had “No comment.”
Lestrade blinked and opened his mouth. “The—the woman, I killed her. She came at me with a knife.” He paused. “The man, Carruthers, he surrendered. So I arrested him.”
When the water began to feel cold John knew it was time to move on. He pushed Sherlock forward and climbed out of the tub. His head was swimming and he felt very tired. He turned around and looked at the tub. Sherlock leaned against the side of it and closed his eyes. “Can you stand?” John asked, and reached out with his hands. Sherlock opened his eyes and lifted his arms to hold them. Everything he did was slow and deliberate. He took a few deep breaths. “Ready?” said John and Sherlock nodded.
“Well…” replied Mycroft, too shocked to deliver his next words with his usual smirk. “You can’t say that won’t get his attention.”
