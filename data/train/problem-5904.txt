“You’re really leaving him in this state?” Steve asks, and then promptly regrets how it comes out low and accusatory. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to --”
“It’s – um,” Tony rubs his eye furiously for a moment before Steve’s mom reaches over and stills the motion, “Oh, thanks Sarah.”
“If it were up to me,” Steven whispers, “I would cut your knot off and make you choke on it. Parade the hills with your guts as a necklace.”
He does actually need to bathe, wants it too, wants to wash off the sweat, blood and grime off his body. It’s been a good session, better than the sessions when it feels as if he’s playfighting, pandered to by the Alpha.
Smoke rises up around him, and he can make out blurry figures around him, but can’t see anything, can’t decipher the musky fog.
The goose dawdles forward before slipping over a bit of ribbon. He honks loudly as he falls. Anthony sputters out a laugh, tossing a hand over his mouth in an attempt to hold it in. Steven kisses him, wetly, on the hand over his mouth.
Anthony turns away from the sight, walks to the four catapults. The wooden weapons were painstakingly dragged up the cliffside at night and built over five months at base camp, America flying almost daily between Anthony and Jane, a young Beta who Thor flushed at hearing the name of and who understood the complexities of Anthony’s designs with an almost intimidating ease.
“Thanks, I’m taking English Literature this year.” Steve says before dumping more soil into the pit.
“I think you believe that you do.” Anthony replies, “But if it goes to hell, as it often does, I will be the one burning.”
Their embrace is a frenzied, passionate scene, lips crawling over each other’s skin, scenting and greeting and reminding.
.” Bucky drawls out as he leaves, picking up the longswords he’d had Anthony work with earlier in the session.
Anthony finally pushes Gregory onto the floor, whips his head to the side with the force of his armoured glove.
His hands and shield are smeared with blood, and he walks with a quick and staggered stride. Behind him trail the few soldiers he’d taken for the raid on the Western Hydra base. They’d been carefully tunneling under the fortress for a month, and had planned to lay ruin to Hydra’s water and food supply tonight. It had been intended to be a quiet and methodical attack; a vicious surprise for Hydra to wake up to.
Sounds of movement stilled Steve's cautious steps, the scraping of shoes against concrete as though they were too tired to lift far from the ground. The sound resonated between the narrow walls of the alley; echoing and breaking the silence. A figure staggered out of the shadows, swift and steady. Accidentally ending up in a shaft of sunlight that penetrated the cloud layer. Each ray of light reflecting every colour on each drop that continued to fall, miniature rainbows forming and then disappearing just as quickly.
Next came the ankle restraints, clipping on around the posts and resting in wait for Steve's ankles. Then finally the drapes, 3 ties, one on each of the three outer sides. They fell open with a shwoosh and Tony became a silhouette in the centre of the bed. By the time he emerged, Steve was panting and dripping, having drawn himself as close as he could without going over. He knew one touch from Tony could ruin that.
"Yeah, just business." He lied, reaching out to take half the stack and resuming his position. It was gonna take Steve a while to get back on his feet and they couldn't wait forever to tell him but it could wait a few days. They'd let both super soldiers get a little healthier before re-introducing them. That was fair, right? Tony tried to tell himself it was.
his brain supplied. He had strong arms, short dirty blonde hair, steely eyes boring into him, glaring in obvious hatred, and...holding a bucket. At least he knew where the water came from. His shirt had no sleeves and he had something strapped to his back that the soldier couldn’t exactly see properly at that moment. He looked comfortable with it so the soldier assumed he wore it often.
"You can do this, I know you can." He insisted, giving Tony the strength he needed to pull himself together. As if Rhodey's words were like a rope being tightened around the shattered pieces of his mind and holding him in one place, grounding him. Slowly, Tony pulled out of Rhodey's arms, bringing his hands to his face and rubbing his tired eyes.
"I have something I need you to attend to..." Tony growled, scraping his nails down Steve's back, making him shudder and arch into the touch. "But first there's something you need to be wearing." He added, his voice light but tone challenging. Swiftly, Tony got off the bed to rummage around in the draw in which Steve could only assume were the toys. When he returned, Tony was holding a small cone shaped plug that was no bigger than maybe two fingers. Steve made a move to sit up but Tony pushed him back down, reaching out and grabbing the lube before resuming his position behind Steve.
All he wanted to do was run away and turn back the clock about a year, maybe just after the chitouri, when they were eating shwarma. Sure there was still something akin to unpleasantness between him and the good captain but it hadn't lasted long.
"You're drunk" he repeated, as if Tony didn't already know. "Where do you live, I'll give you a ride." He offered, although he hadn't yet removed Tony's hand and his voice had softened further, less surprised and possibly even pitying. When Tony didn't answer right away, the man before him sighed and walked away, off towards what Tony could only assume was the kitchen as he emerged with a bottle of water.
"I don't know how you managed to lock this door. Or, more importantly, how a 1940's man like yourself managed to block all of JARVIS' communications... He's and AI, I can't even do that. And I don't want him monitoring me half the time. I mean I don't know what I'd do without him, he's kept me on the relatively straight and narrow for a long time. My best invention, even the iron man suit doesn't top it.... This is ridiculous..." Tony sighed heavily, looking at himself in the mirrored wall. His eyes were bloodshot and the two different shades of grey lining the sockets made them look sunken into his skull. His lips were chapped and nibbled raw, drawn into a thin line. His head hurt, his face hurt, his stomach hurt, everything had some level of pain, 12 hours sleep had very little effect other than an energy boost.
"Sorry, are you alright?" He asked, seeing a bruise begin to form on Clint's jaw where his elbow had struck.
"JARVIS, given your 'brutal  murder' on Steve's floor, could you give me an approximate date when Captain America stopped eating?" Tony couldn't figure out why yet but it was highly unlikely he was feeling fat and self conscious about his weight, maybe he just stopped being hungry. Whatever it was, Tony was going to fix it.
Steve. We're here you know, you didn't have to leave your floor, you could have just called me. Or Natasha, or Sam. Anyone to just help out." He urged, shifting closer so now their knees were touching.
"Tony, your not thinking rationally, you need to calm down... Can you take some deep breaths?-" Tony took a deeper inhale as he could, following orders likes good little soldier. "-thats it, you're doing great, and again... There we go, it's getting easier now isn't it?" Tony nodded slowly against Rhodey's chest. "A few more like that and you'll be able to think properly, Steve will be fine, he knows how important he is and won't put that on the team. No, Tony come on, deep breathing, keep it up." Rhodey pulled back a little so he could stroke the hair from Tony's clammy forehead.
“James, look at me.” Bucky did as he was ordered and realised he was trembling, and not breathing. “You are going to sit in this bath and let me wash you. Do you understand?” She asked. Her words weren’t harsh, not by any means, but they were stern and Bucky found himself instantly calming.
Bucky blinked opening his bleary eyes, the scarce light piercing his cornea and stabbing his brain. The painful
, he thought. Steve absentmindedly rubbed his thumb in small circles over Tony's chest, causing him to break out of his trance.
“Did you find my cat?” he asks as he began eying everyone in the room to try and judge their position and role in this space, he took note of where the doors were and that they seemed to need an access code to enter and leave. There weren’t any windows, underground maybe? Or a room within a floor of the tower. It was white and sterile, maybe to reduce the amount of sensory input. It was a little painful on the eyes initially, but he could see the value of it, it wasn’t distracting him from the more important things in the room.
Bruce’s expression morphed into something mildly impressed. He put down the tablet he was holding and stepped closer, so it was mostly just glass between them. “There was an incident. You woke up a few hours after that first went in,” he gestured to the drip, “freaked out about it and fought us. We’re lucky we took all your weapons as you clearly weren’t in a clear enough headspace to listen to any of us.”
them, not dob me in to Rhodey." He snarked, using the stool to pull himself to his feet with a wobble. Rhodey was quick to follow, one hand on Tony's back to steady him.
Apparently neither Tony nor Steve knew what to do when confronted by so many. There was only five people but when they were all staring it became a little difficult to do anything but be observed.
The room he entered was a large simple bedroom with a connected bathroom. The room had two walls that were full length windows with a city scape of sky-scrapers and office blocks. The bed could comfortably fit three and looked like it had never been slept in. The carpet was soft under his bare toes and the colours were simple whites and greys. Nothing like Bucky was used to, even before the war. Luckily the lights were dim so they weren't too painful and offensive.
eventually recognise the dry, tight feeling crawling over his skin, still, he didn’t panic. It wasn’t painful, or frightening, or… unnatural.
“Well, we’re not going to work any of that out from here.” Tony managed, talking somewhere over Steve’s shoulder. Actually, this hastily derived plan was entirely about getting the hell out of this room – but there was still some logic to it. He could drag some logic out of it. “And I personally think I’ll find it easier to look around without the personal sex narrator – you know, when I can freak out at my leisure, instead of pretending I booked this for our anniversary.”
...And, in reality, someone being protective of him had only ever meant protecting him from himself. Not any of the people who’d hurt him.

head. Tony Stark had never needed anything from Steve, never wanted anything from him, never had a personal problem Steve could help with or any reason to be in awe of
He moved more quickly this time, sweeping his tongue over the curve of Steve’s ass, sucking against his skin hard enough to bruise. Steve began to pant noisily, his bones trembling under the intensity of it, his head full of anguished pleading. He felt Tony’s other hand press against the inside of his thigh, his palm caressing firmly over the soft skin as he traced the tip of his tongue over the line of Steve’s groin, and then began lapping at the little trails of blood that were running over his balls. Steve clenched his teeth so hard it hurt his skull, now gripping the blankets so tightly that his knuckles were white.
“And it didn’t bother you?” Steve asked, tetchily. Tony got the impression that one had just slipped out.
Before they set out on this off-the-books mission, Tony had reminded himself to pay more attention to his reactions - and Steve’s, and Wesley’s. He knew that if he was ever going to figure out what these feelings really were, and what triggered them, then he was going to have to start making better notes at the time.
...Until, eventually, another thought stirred. A vague observation that unsettled something at the back of his mind. Something that jarred with his easy mood - not enough to snap him out of it, but too much to be consumed by it.
earth people who care about that stuff, who wouldn’t just stand by and let it happen. We’re here because we chose to be.”
So, maybe there wasn’t anything deep and meaningful about them. At least, nothing more deep and meaningful than love itself.
The innovator and engineer in Tony, the part of him that was able to see the right patterns and ask the right questions and recognise the right reactions – the part of him that had been there all his life, quick and confident enough to believe that he understood what he was looking at.
He was basically confident that he’d made the right choices - even if he was still slightly uneasy about the drawbacks that he couldn’t avoid.
feel better about dying on this planet because I got to try this,” he made one last attempt to push it toward Steve, who just scowled at him.
He’d never been invited to one before he became Captain America, and after that he always felt more like he was providing the entertainment than enjoying it. He’d never been able to relax at a gala or a charity dinner, knowing that all eyes were on him, while he was actually completely out of his element and had no idea how he was supposed to behave-
He fell into battle stance as he opened the door - and stayed there, even after he recognised Nick Fury.
...He’d sort of forgotten that bad things could happen by now. And, when you take for granted that bad things can’t happen, there is no reason not to eat the flower…
Tony stomped out of the elevator, clenching his teeth so hard it was making his jaw ache. He threw his White House Security Pass onto the coffee table in a little fit of petulance, and then sulkily fell into the couch. There was, as always, a stack of envelopes and legal documents waiting on the table by the door – but Tony didn’t have the mental energy to think about them yet. Instead, he let his head fall back onto the couch cushions, and opened his mouth to call for Steve-
– and who had been good enough to do them a favour. He was also kind of rude, and obviously had a limit as to how far he would go to help others… And beyond that, Steve didn’t know him at all. But he had no reason to think he’d like him, as a person, if he did.
… All the years he’d been in love with Steve. Years of thinking that Steve would only ever see the worst in him, that Steve would never trust him the way he did other people… That he’d never be able to make Steve happy.
“Hey Cap, you awake?” He called, from outside the door. Steve held his breath. He hadn’t meant to, but… Tony called him

always been the same. And Father, he – he just tried to tell the Councils, ever since he was a little boy, that they couldn’t just keep following the same traditions and doing the same things for thousands and thousands of years. That they couldn’t just keep teaching their children the same things, that they had to explore new things – that they had to
And then, just as he was about to round the corner into the main research bay, Steve was stopped in his tracks-
He realised that it was Bucky’s palm pressed against his back, holding him in position so that Steve could help him. That Bucky’s other hand was still holding a bundle of bloodstained fabric to his hip-
Tony sucked another long, slow mouthful, the feeling even more vivid now that there was literally no resistance to it. Steve could feel the blood being pulled through his veins, through every inch of him, bringing every other sensation along with it – tugging that low ache in his groin up through his hips, crushing it under the power of this release. Steve came hard against his stomach, the relief of it simply melting into the rush of Tony drinking from him, the aftershocks running in his blood, like Tony was dragging him climax up through his body, dragging it out. He choked out a sob, cut short when Tony drained another heavy gulp. It was like he was breaking over and over, coming and coming, held at the crest of this wave – freefalling, with no end in sight…
A warm, watery feeling soaked up through Steve’s chest, making him feel slightly unsteady on his feet.
“Ah, if only things were ever that simple…” he smiled, sadly. He saw the little flicker of genuine concern behind Rhodey’s eyes – or, even worse,
“Steve, they’re beautiful,” he breathed. “You’re beautiful. You’re amazing, and I adore you, and I - just, I can’t believe you’re really here-” was cut off when Steve kissed him again, warm and playful this time.
have a vague memory of this, as it turned out “How if you’ve only got a fifty per cent concentration of… the… air and the water, in your blood?” He questioned, frowning at Tony.
get to, I swear. But it’s not like I came out with any of that from nowhere” Tony began – another little twist of affection as he saw Steve drop his head and nod, somewhat sadly. “…Including the bit where I said I wasn’t mad anymore, and I forgive you for all that stuff, and all that.”
The breeze was warm and soft, carrying a fine spray of salt and the sound of children playing on the beach. He was walking with such a spring in his step that he was almost skipping, smiling so broadly that people waved when they caught his eye-
kiss Steve. That it was perfectly harmless to daydream about it, whatever little games he was playing with himself.
“Hi,” he answered that expression on autopilot - even going as far as to extend his hand. The woman’s eyes widened as she took it, an excited smile tugging underneath her professional demeanour.
sitting there, frozen inside a body that he couldn’t control. Those were the moments when Bucky was most aware of the horrors he was living through, and his own helplessness against them. Moments when he felt his own limbs hanging from his body like stone, cold and unresponsive and alien to him… Like an allegory for his entire existence.
“That was the plan before we got here, and I have not got the capacity to reconsider it” Tony told him outright.
Which meant, really, he should get up right now without giving it another thought. He should pointedly refuse to acknowledge the real issue, or plan what he was going to think about later, because he knew that would only lead to nagging worries about it now…
them to be a bit thrown by the question – but if someone asks you whether you support the church, then it’s a simple yes/no question that Captain America deliberately avoided, and what is he hiding-” And Tony was cut short when Steve burst out laughing again.
After that he didn't really know what. He's only ever gotten as far as seeing him, never moved past that and despite the opportunities he never had any idea what to do next. Natalia and Clint were patiently waiting for a response when he could be getting clean. The food and drink were added to Clint's load so Natalia could begin to remove the bindings when he nodded.
"How about we sort them according to person? So any that are Peggy go in one pile, any that are Bucky go in another, etcetera..." Tony motioned to the piles, hoping Steve would follow his lead. He picked up the biggest pile and shuffled to one side of the sofa, facing inwards so there was room between them. Steve grabbed his own pile and copied his actions, he already looked slightly better, the magic of a Stark Tower Shower.
, Tony nodded, figuring it would be best to get it over and done with. A wave of exhaustion came over him, one that he was familiar with but not one he enjoyed. He wasn't looking forward to this. The Assassin won't know what hit him.
"Mr Barton has been subdued my Captain Rogers approximately 34 times now, not including the times he was on the floor. That would increase the number to 46." The AI informed them. Steve felt a little guilty, he'd broken five reinforced punching bags in the last four hours so Clint had offered to spar with him, Natasha wasn't going to pass up an opportunity to tease her partner either.
“I need you to come close to the edge of the tub, make sure you face is not over the water.” Natalia instructed softly. Bucky did so and tried to figure out what was in her hands. She had plugged it in to an output in the wall and placed a towel over the mat. When she pressed a button on the device it whirred to life and sounded as though it was vibrating. James shot back instantly, hitting his head on the wall and making water slosh around.
Tony didn't really know what to do, instead he sort of stayed where he was, shuffling from foot to foot. He was itching to get a look at the arm but at the same time he didn't want to leave Steve, he needed to be sure that he was gonna be okay for a few hours. At the same time he felt like he needed to see Bucky, maybe to blame him, to hit him, he wasn't sure yet. Best not visit him first.
Now knowing Steve was there, Tony was out like a light, the moment he closed his eyes he was asleep.
"Come on Steve. Our ride's here." He said kindly, rubbing Steve's back as he gently pushed him forward, encouraging his lethargic steps. It was awful to see someone as strong as Steve like this, but then his recovery from the ice did seem too good to be true. It would take loosing his best friend since childhood - again - to crack the hard shell and expose the broken man inside.
Steve began to creep forward, holding his hand back to signal 'wait' when he heard Tony follow his movement. There were still a good 25 metres between them but Steve daren't run incase Bucky fled. Instantly Steve could see the difference the fall of hydra, who had needed to keep him healthy and strong, had done to his best friend. The last time they'd clapped eyes on each other, Bucky had been fuller, his shoulders strong, jaw tense but cheeks fuller than the sunken shadows that now occupied his face. Now the assassin was shrouded in light, Steve could see bones. Even through the hoody that, thanks to the rain, clung to his body. At this angle Steve could see his back and one side, Bucky holding his left arm to his chest made it easier for Steve to see the ribs protruding, his shoulder blades sharp in contrast to the smoothness of his back, the only place Steve couldn't distinguish the joints.
Bucky sat himself down on the edge of the bed. He was exhausted. Exhausted of running, exhausted of the constant memories forcing themselves on him without warning. Exhausted of not being able to sleep and not being able to eat. He was exhausted of being exhausted.
"Buck...." Steve whispered, his throat tightening as his breathing became shallow, his fight or flight response battling it out in his blood.
"C'mon James... You know you don't bathe with clothes on." She chastised kindly, a very unsubtle hint for Bucky, clearly sensing his confusion. The assassin nodded and began to tug the buttons of his jeans undone, he began to push them down and ended up kicking them off, having to hold onto the sink to make sure he didn’t fall over. When he was done with that he shrugged out of his boxers with little thought about being naked around a woman and then stepped slowly into the bath.
TW for some: there's some medical talk in this, just a tiny but about needles. It's not too long and its consensual in nature so I hope it wont be a problem.
“You know my opinion on that.” No, he didn’t, James would quite like to know what on earth everyone was talking about and why he couldn’t open his eyes properly. “But it could take over a week just for him to kick the infection, probably another 3 to put on enough weight for surgery, another week to recover from the surgery. If you insist on keeping this from Steve it’s gonna be over a month. I’m not a psychologist but even I know that wouldn’t be good for Steve, or for James.” So, Steve didn’t know he was here. In fairness Bucky didn’t truly know where here was.
"Thanks." He mumbled, licking his lips and relaxing back against the pillows. Tony moved back between Steve's legs, pushing the toy back in place and letting the, now more intense, vibrations do the work. His hand then found Steve's proud standing cock, the head shiny with pre-come. Steve damn near came from that alone, using every ounce of restraint he had to follow orders. He even almost breathed 'yellow' but he didn't want to to slow down to the extent he knew Tony would.
, he wasn't sure he could hold off against this. Tony apparently saw this and withdrew a little, so it wasn't pressed directly against him.
He blinked his eyes open, squinting against the bright light. He groaned a little, turning his head away from the light and squeezing them closed. He heard a switch and tentatively opened them again, seeing the main light had been shut off and a smaller bedside light had been turned on in its place. It was far less painful; he was able to focus on the room. Though things still seemed a little blurry, and his head was pounding as he’d been warned.
Once back in the bedroom, Bucky could feel the tug of exhaustion competing with the pain growing in what was left of his arm. Clint was no longer in the room so that just left Natalia to help dress him in the clothes that he’d left. He dabbed himself dry with the towel whilst sat on the bed, pulling up the thin sweats Natalia handed him and then allowing her to guide his arm through the sleeve of the dark tank top and over his head.
"Okay, not the best way to break the news." Tony muttered to himself, pressing Steve's palm against his chest and trapping it with his own, fingertips covering the arc reactor. "Steve, you need to breath. Follow me, come on. Deep breath in, through your nose... there we go... Slooooowly out through your mouth... And again, we're getting there." Steve tried his hardest to follow Tony's breathing, but he was struggling to take a whole breath in without it rushing out again. He looked up at Tony with fear filled eyes, it wasn't as of this was the first time he'd had a panic attack, he'd had asthma for Christ sake. Bucky used to do something similar when they were kids; getting Steve to mimic his breathing until he calmed enough to control it on his own.
"How the hell did you manage that? Did you weld them together or something? These types of doors aren't easy to replace either, it's not as if it had been long since I put them in either, I don't know why I did your floor differently to everyone else's, I mean really? I have the money but if I'm gonna spend it then it's gonna be on something big, not new doors. I think I might make the new ones glass so we can see in. Not that you'll be on your floor, I should never have left you alone... Or maybe just one set of doors, so you see a dark, dirty elevator shaft. Saves us this trouble anyway. Oh, and while we're on the subject - JARVIS! What the fuck did you do to him? He isn't happy, I wouldn't expect and favours from him any time so-" Tony's nervous ranting was cut off by four loud bangs, not so much knocks this time, more like the door was being slapped or kicked. He stopped, realising his error.
"Last night you said this was you accepting help. We need you Cap, I can't lead this team. Sure I'll pay for it and make weapons for it but I am not a leader. You are, you know how, you're good with people. You carry on like this and you won't be around to boss anyone around. Even if you have to force it down, just humour me and eat the goddamn pancakes would you?" Tony vented, not realising that his hand was now snugly entwined with Steve's until it was squeezed.
"Green." Steve rasped, a small sated gin on his lips. Tony grinned in return, getting up and moving to the foot, releasing Steve's ankles.
"James, we're gonna get you cleaned up okay? You won't be alone but you'll be able to shower and we'll give you clean clothes and something to eat and drink. Even though you're in chains we don't actually think you're a threat-"
"Steve... Please." Tony hated how his voice cracked, he didn't usually show weakness like this but Rhodey wasn't the only military man he had a soft spot for. Tony couldn't help the small whimper of relief when one of Steve's weakened hands emerged from the cocoon of blankets and paper. Upon closer inspection Tony realised the sketches were of Bucky Barnes. He then had to bite down the pang of jealousy when he realise there was the Winter Soldier and Peggy. The one currently in progress in his pad was interesting however; it was himself, only it wasn't. It was Tony's face but he was wearing 40's military uniform, the cap tilted to one side, a playful smirk upon his clean shaven face.
Tony slipped the gauntlet on his arm, flexing his fingers and pressing buttons as he strode over to his 'spare crap' box (at least that's what it said on the side). Digging through until he was almost half inside the box itself. Rising with a triumphant 'ah ha!' when he found what he was looking for.
"My names Steve, Steve Rogers." Steve answered, holding out his hand that wasn't cradling his cranium. Tony lifted his own and shook it, un-phased by the strength in it. He couldn't help but wander what it would feel like holding other parts of his anatomy.
"Hey Steve, long time no see." Sam beamed from his seat at the island, chowing down on a plate full of French pastries. Tony swallowed as he took in the rest of the Avengers gathered in the kitchen. Everyone was there, even Thor (who had dressed down into nothing but pyjama pants covered with mini Molnjr's).
"Hey sleepyhead, how you feeling?" He asked when Steve began to stir, stroking through his soft golden hair. Steve rubbed his eyes and nodded his response, checking the time.
Before moving to a new area, Natalia would warn him, so he knew where the next touch would be coming from. She kept asking him if he hurt, also telling him he was allowed to admit it if it did. He wouldn’t dare. She also made the odd comment about his size. Having not been able to eat a lot, he'd lost a lot of weight and muscle, he'd caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror on the way in to the bathroom; even when he was so poor he could hardly feed Steve, let alone himself, he hadn't been this underweight.
Tony couldn't answer, the basement would be fine, the lab was possible, the medical wing would be okay, his workshop had restraints but it wasn't exactly ideal. The back-end of Bag-end would be good. Anywhere away from Steve for now.
that wasn't an uncommon thought throughout the team. Steve was the first to recover, swallowing and clenching his hands into fists. This was a new low, even for Tony.
Bucky raised a doubtful eyebrow, “I get a choice?” he had to ask, because he could read a room very well and Natalia was giving off some unfriendly signals.
If he wanted to leave this cell, he would likely have to earn it, having proved that he wasn’t always as in control as he wished he was, and that made him a threat. The only way to be free from Hydra for good, he would need to erase the conditioning and he needed their trust to do that. Finally, he straightened his spine and asked: “What do you want to know?”
The words were spoken in a soft, velvety voice, one Bucky had never been able to refuse. Now that he thought about it he realised that the stump did feel uncomfortable. The pain of removing the metal one subsided as soon as he blacked out and the freezing temperatures had numbed it enough so that he couldn’t feel anything.
Once the team was settled, Steve leaning against the corner, Tony's cold toes tucked under his thigh, head resting against Bruce's thigh. Clint and Natasha were sharing the double with Thor, Nat's legs draped over Thor's while her body lay back against Clint's shins, Clint sitting on the arm with his knees pulled up. Sam sat on his own in the single, one leg draped over the arm and the other propped up on the table, a bowl of Doritos resting on the other arm. It was a nice image, cozy, familial. As though they really did belong together.
Steve watched Tony as he span in his chair, standing and walking towards Steve, sketchbook held in front of him. It was all Steve could do not to snatch it from his grasp and hold it close.
"Drink some more, you're still bleeding you you probably still have a lot of alcohol in your system as well so you'll be dehydrated." Tony tried to take the bottle from Steve but his hand was just lightly slapped away. "Let me, you might have a concussion so you can stay here for the night. Don't want you collapsing with no one around to find out." Absently, Tony realised that Steve was talking to save Tony and fill the silence, freeing Tony from his own mindless chatter. "My flatmate, Bucky, is staying with his family for the week so you can crash on his bed. You should meet him, he was there as well." Tony raised an eyebrow and sipped at the water. "You'd like him, you have a similar sense of humour; dry, sarcastic, vaguely insulting..." Steve chuckled, taking the water away and pushing Tony more upright. "I'm gonna check your head, might need bandaging to make sure you don't bleed out all over the pillows. Did you know alcohol thins the blood?" He asked, gently pulling the cloth away, just enough to check underneath.
"Okay spangles, I'm back, make sure you're a good ten feet away." He warned, standing as far back as he could and raising his arm, aiming about 20cm down from the top, a quarter of the way in. He fired, using the laser to cut the metal in a large rectangle, it taking a few minutes to get all the way round. As expected, the metal did not fall away from the surrounding door, which was why he had the repulsor. Angling his body to the other side before aiming and firing dead centre. The smell of burning metal was fresh in his nostrils and he tentatively stepped forward, not sure of what to expect once inside.
Natalia came to sit behind him. Not joining him in the water but sitting on the ledge so she could easily reach him. “James, I’m going to use the shower head to wash what isn’t submerged, I will avoid your left shoulder. Does that sound okay?” She asked, giving him the freedom to choose once again. He nodded his affirmative and heard the tap turn on, quickly changing to a spray that was not yet angled towards him. But he could feel the tiny spray of cool water and realised she was waiting for it to warm. He could hardly remember a time of having warm water to clean with even before the war.
So naturally Steve followed. It took a couple of seconds for his muscles to get into gear and actually move, flight it was.
"James, you apparently don't seem to remember me, that's alright, but I'm gonna try and jog your memory. My name is Natasha Romanov, you know me as Natalia Romanova. We worked together for the KGB, not by choice. My code name was, still is, 'Black Widow'. Yours was 'The Winter Soldier'. You don't need to be afraid anymore James,”
Luckily as leader of The Avengers, Steve was given the access code for Tony's workshop in case of emergencies. While this wasn't exactly an emergency, Steve was going to utilise the privilege he'd been granted "Stark?!" He called angrily, storming into the workshop and stumbling back when he saw Tony with his feet up, Steve's sketchbook sitting closed on his lap, fingers twirling the 2B pencil in his hand.
"Tony. We need to leave. Now." Steve said urgently, resisting the urge to grab his shield and run straight to Bucky. Even it it meant scaling buildings and running through walls. Tony didn't even argue, he just grabbed a magnetic tracker and a mini repulser just incase Bucky became the assassin once more.
"You gonna watch me all night captain handsome?" He asked groggily, his voice thick and deep with sleep. Steve rolled his eyes, moving his hand to rest on Tony's shoulder.
"What?" He mouths, holding his palms face up in an almost shrug. "I heard something." Steve mouths back, really grateful that this time of day and this area is really quiet. Steve thought that it would be nice in a summer evening in the 40's; children playing out on the streets, neighbours talking on the doorstep as they watched friendships being made, young couples strolling along on their way to the cinema or the dance club. Unfortunately for Steve's imagination, summer had not yet quite arrived and now there was a light drizzle coating everything in a layer of water, attaching to clothes and hair, pulling heat out of his body. Steve allowed himself only a few seconds of panic about the ice before the groan got louder, a small whimper escaping at the end.
Tony started by making an 8 Gb iPod classic a 200 Gb storage capacity. He then put a large selection of songs and artists from each genre, putting them in playlists based on decades, with two others labeled: 'Tony's faves' and 'Recommended'.
Tony smiled wide at Steve's choices, taking the others out of his hands, slipping into role. "Im going to go and set the bed up, by the time I'm done I want you naked and close to orgasm okay? If you come before I say so then you're going to regret it" He warned, walking backwards to the bed until Steve nodded obediently. He watched Tony as he began to strip, folding his clothes neatly and setting them by the wall, first Tony removed the duvet, apparently not wanting it to get in the way. Then he slid the bar behind some of the posts until the cuff poked out in the right place, it would lock Steve's hands together and to the bed, his cock throbbed at the thought. Taking himself in his hand, Steve began to slowly stroke himself, refraining from groaning from the recent lack of touch (Tony had been away on business for two weeks and they didn't have time for anything before Tony crashed for 14 hours. They also had a sort of unspoken 'no pleasuring yourself' rule...unless instructed otherwise).
"Maybe it's because I didn't know?" He retaliates, this was genuinely the first he'd heard about it. He stood before Tony, hands on his hips. "You may or may not remember but I haven't left the tower in a week or so." He reminded him with a smile, he didn't feel an urge to leave so he wasn't fussed about being forced to stay.
Tony was lucky enough to have JARVIS wake him before they dug their claws in. Either that or he just passed out into an alcohol induced coma for 15 hours.
It wasn't as if drawing Tony would be hard for Steve, he was an attractive man who was both smooth curves and sharp angles all at the same time. His jaw was defined by his van dyke, lips a deep pink than contrasted the chocolate brown of his hair. His cheeks rounder and fuller than Steve's, more rounded yet still prominent. His long eyelashes widened his eyes and occasionally gave him a childlike appearance, an innocence that he'd never imagined a Stark could pull off, certainly not one Steve could achieve.
"I tried..." He mumbled in response, curling slightly tighter into himself. "Most of the time it just came back up again..." He added sadly, his body feeling the energy drain, crying out for sustenance for the first time in a long time.
Maybe she knew Stark better than he did. Bucky swallowed, keeping eye contact to show he wasn't afraid but being sure to remain as still and non-threatening as possible. Oddly, Stark’s manic eyes flicked down the knife, back to his face and down again. He then stumbled a few paces backward with it in his palm, promptly dropping it as though it had burnt him. Horrified, Stark back peddled and left the three alone. Bucky swallowed again, blinking rapidly in an attempt to understand what had happened, coming back to himself and realising what he'd just asked him to do...
"Er yeah, um. Bring him to the basement, you can restrain him there, leave the arm in my workshop, I'll try to visit at some point and take a look, if he has to, let Bruce look over him but don't leave him on his own, I like me cars the way they are, I don't want any dents should big green make an appearance. I have to go Clint, thanks for telling me. I'll talk when you get back. Bye." He hung up before Clint had a chance to reply, pulling himself up and stumbling toward the en suit so he could splash himself.
! You don't even realise what you've done to Steve do you? You couldn't care less! No matter what he says,
“Oh for god’s sake, it’s not like I haven’t seen it all before” Natalia huffed, turning her back and crossing her arms. “Hurry up.” She added for good measure.
"Granted it's not every day someone crashes through my window but you woke me from a nightmare. I ought to thank you really..." Steve, like before, had gone a little quieter her he still sounded strong and in control, something Tony wished he could pull off. Steve began to rummage in the ridiculously large medical kit, pulling out a few items.
Stark’s words hurt worse than anything that Hydra had done. If what Stark was saying was true, then Bucky had let Stevie down again. And now he wasn't being given the opportunity to make it right.
"Yes sir." Steve squeaked, knowing exactly what was coming. Once under the drapes, Steve felt a whole new level of private, he could still see out but it was just shapes and shadows, even sound was a little muffled, it was almost magical. On his knees, Steve pulled a pillow under his chin and shoulders, making his rear the highest point. Tony emerged from the bathroom, a few bottles in hand and a cloth. He placed the bottles on the bedside table before joining Steve under the drapes, holding a flannel. Steve swallowed when Tony knelt behind him, thankfully everything had been discussed long ago and they knew each other's limits. The traffic light system was in place and they had a safe word. Steve trusted Tony with his life, he knew he would never get hurt by him.
"Yeah... Sure, I can do that..." Tony mumbled, drowsy and not from the alcohol. Mr Sex was only slightly blurry when he re-appeared above Tony, slightly. Just soft around the edges really. Without explanation, the guy gently lifted Tony's shoulders and knelt down behind him, pulling him back to rest against his very solid thighs. The next thing Tony new, he had long fingers carting through his hair, searching his scalp until they came away sticky. They were quickly replaced with a cloth of some sort. Tony didn't care, didn't have the energy to do much else other than sit there and let wonder boy take care of him.
"I killed Steve, I killed him Rhodey. He's dead because of me, cause I let him go to his floor alone, it's against the rules but I. Still. Did. It!" He spat, feeling Rhodey's strong arms wrap protectively around his shoulders, rocking forward and back slightly.
"Do you remember that very special, like it must have been fate, night around oh I don't know: 356 days ago?" Tony asked, light and amused. Steve nodded, smiling softly at the memory of Tony resting on his lap so he didn't pass out.
"Steven, searching in this state will not help you find it any quicker. Please take a breath and describe it to us so we may help you." Thor said, his deep baritone stilling Steve's movements. Compelling him to do as he was told. Slowly, he straightened and turned to the others, taking a deep breath and holding it.
"Mr Stark? Are you - oh crap. Come on Mr Stark you aren't there anymore, you broke into my apartment remember? Now you're laying on my lap with a bump to the head, it's okay. Im here to help you, I'm not going to hurt you." Steves strong voice filtered through the haze and fixed the chaos in Tony's mind.
Tony shifted, sitting cross legged on the bed by Steve's feet. Steve now became more awake, this hasn't happened before and it was obviously important. He heard Tony take a breath to speak, and then let it out again, doing the same and getting caught on the first word, sounded like an 'I'.
“Agreed. Come on then Barnes, I’m guessing you can probably hear us by now, Steve hates it when he has to have this stuff” Bucky felt the bed shift beside him as Clint sat on the bed. “I know it feels horrible, and I really hope you’re not in the middle of a flashback ready to choke me to death when you can move again. I’m gonna touch your hand, try and squeeze it, it’s a good indication of how your body is burning off the drug.” He explained.
To his left was the closest wall, furthest from the drivers exit, closest to the entrance, it was about ten metres away. The wall had a tap jutting out with a drain beneath it, there were a few sponges in a basket to the right and a random set of tools to the left. He could even see a hose poking out behind a plank of wood leant against the wall, he hoped to god they didn't use it on him. He had a brief few seconds where his vision was clouded by the mask they used, the feeling of pressurised water knocking the air out of his lungs, the stones cutting into his flesh.
"How about you go and get a shower while I start gathering all these." He suggested, holding up a mostly blank sheet of paper, running a hand along Steve's forearm. Swallowing, Steve nodded, the movement stiff and jerky. He shed the rest of the blankets and stood, multiple joints popping all at the same time, even then it was a graceful movement - swift motion and completely controlled.
Also, first time submitting smut so please let me know if it's bad and then I won't attempt it again...
"Oh god!" Steve cried as he clung to the pillow, pushing back onto nothing but wanting more. He could feel how close the plug was to his sweet spot and the vibrations were only just reaching it. Tony laughed gleefully, apparently unsure how the added feature was going to play with Steve.
"I should make your voice available for satnavs." He quipped, making Steve raise an eyebrow in confusion. He was hearing one side of a conversation and wished he was a little less interested in Tony and more interested in finding Bucky. To Tony's dismay, JARVIS stayed silent. It was an odd silence, one where JARVIS knew whatever he said would be used against him as he became the new voice of 'turn left' and 'recalculating' so instead he stayed quiet, a subtle 'fuck you' to his creator.
Tony never fucked Steve's mouth, not like they did on porn anyway. When Steve asked why (cause he wasn't to keen either) Tony simply said it was 'because he didn't like the gagging noises.' Steve couldn't argue with that, he already knew how to take it all the way down and he often did, just at his own pace. In fact, Steve was always in control of any blowjob but Tony likes to pet him, like to have the ability to force him to stay if he one day decided he wanted to.
They'd made it to the elevator with almost no issues, the chains were coded rather than key locked, clever...so it had taken less than a minute to get him out of them. Getting into the elevator had been more difficult as Bucky apparently had trouble walking, maybe it was because he felt lopsided and off balance, maybe he had been injured.
"Let's go home, Steve." Tony said softly, his voice caressing Steve's shoulders and tearing the tension to shreds. Home, somewhere Steve belonged.
"Im getting the feeling you won't want to walk..." He said as an explanation, taking a few gulps from the bottle before resuming the kneeling position between Steve's legs. He began to run his hands up and down Steve's chest, working away any strain and leftover tension, he then moved down to Steve's thighs, being careful around his now half hard cock. Steve nodded and Tony reached for the lube, lifting both of Steve's ankles up over his shoulders: their favourite position. Tony quickly coated himself a added more to Steve's hole for good measure. Surging forward, Tony pressed up against his entrance, his lips inches away from Steve's. "I love you." He whispered, slowly pushing in at the same time as he joined their lips, languidly penetrating Steve and swallowing his moans.
"You're close aren't you Steve, I can see how tight you're wound up. I want you to beg, Steve. But if you beg before you really need to then you'll be punished, and I mean it this time. I might even see if we have a paddle, I'll have you crying in agony but still wanting more." Tony threatened, which obviously made Steve leak all over again.
"Ah ah ah, don't be needy. I don't like needy." Tony snarled, quickly pulling the plug out and leaving Steve bereft of any feeling, leaving him empty and wanting more. "Now, if you come before I say you can the you'll go the rest of the night without being able to, and you also won't be able to touch me. I want you to cry out as much as you need to, don't hold back. I love hearing the noises you make Steve, makes me so hard. Colour?" Steve heard the click of the lube bottle again and then something small pressed on his entrance, not pushing in yet.
The ipod became the first in manny gift Tony either chucked into Steve's lap or subtly hid underneath whichever pillow he occupied that night. The most complicated by far had been the StarkPhone. Steve looked in borrow at Tony's extended hand, almost as though he was handing over a dead baby. It took him about six hours to fully explain, until Clint caught wind of what was happening and complained that he still couldn't find the camera function. So the one-on-one tutorial became a full class of StarkTech lessons.
"Tony? You still there....? Tony, are you alright...?" Clint's voice was like a blaring siren in the silence of the room.
"No, I don't know when he last slept, I don't mind waiting until he wakes." He replied equally as softly, looking up to see a knowing look in Bruce's eyes. "Thanks though." He added, smiling lightly. Bruce shrugged, a small 'whatever', and made his way to the elevator where Thor and Sam had been waiting.
A metallic knock shocked Tony out of his thoughts, making him leap 3 feet high into the air and fall on his knees facing the door, eyes wide in shock, a shaky hand pointing in the general direction. After five minutes of listening to his own racing heartbeat, Tony realised he must have been hearing things he wanted to hear...
"I got some last night, but it wasn't very good. Maybe two or three hours but I woke up a few times cause of nightmares, last time I slept without dreaming was last week when I collapsed of exhaustion." He said quickly, probably hoping Tony would miss the bit on information. Unfortunately for Steve, Tony was paying full attention.
“No, it won’t… We’ll have to figure out how to make them both stable before we re-introduce them though. That if Tony even lets us.” Natalia said.
Another couple of hours and they had a food and toilet break. Which steve utilised. He came back to find Tony lifting the corners of his A3 pad, peaking under in search for the sketch of Tony he had hidden in there.
Everything in the tower had been running smoothly and with nary a hitch; any time they were called out the worked as a team efficiently and quickly to reduce damage. Movie nights and team bonding activities became a regular occurrence, they even went bowling once (that had been so much fun for the paparazzi.)
Once Steve was safely out of view, Tony took a proper look at the room, designs and blueprints running through the back of his mind. If he could get Steve onto another floor he could call his R&D team in the morning and set them to work, his main priority was Steve though, JARVIS could wait if there was nothing there for him to monitor.
“Does anywhere hurt?” She questioned, asking him to turn and face her so she could work on his chest. He shook his head slowly. A lot did hurt but if he admitted it then it would have to be fixed. And that usually meant more pain. Truthfully, his arm was starting to get a bit sore beneath the bandaging. He could remember it bleeding before he passed out but after that it was a bit of a blur.
"Twilight saga tonight. The whole team has to be there." He said softly, feeling the palpable tension wash away with Tony's groan.
"Do it again..." He ordered, as though he's just been shown something wonderous and fascinating and amazing.
"I used to have asthma attacks when I was younger." Steve started, his voice rough and husky from crying. "Buck- he... Um- Bucky used to hold me in a similar way to help me regulate my breathing. I learned how to do it on my own and he knew that I could but he was always there, my hand against his chest, in through the nose and out through the mouth. Always telling me how great I was doing, and that I'd be okay and not to be scared. What you did reminded me of it and I guess I've bottled things up again. I feel better now." He admitted, being able to talk more freely once he'd cleared the first hurdle. That was how it had become with Tony though: easy. Like talking to one of the commando's, nearly like talking to Bucky.
"That was uncalled for." He muttered, pressing his thumb into the recognition pad, opening the secondary glass door (designed so he could see who was approaching) and sauntering into his favourite floor in the building. "J, where are my spare repulsors?" He asks, finding the newest suit he had and detaching below the elbow, glad he'd decided to introduce a 'clip on, clip off' system.
"I do like it when you obey, as much as I enjoy you rebelling..." Tony mused, shucking his shirt and wiggling out of his skinny shorts, no sign of underwear. Steve could only nod, the default was usually that he stay quiet or he'd be punished. Tony grinned slyly, reaching over and removing Steve's hand from where it held the base, holding off his orgasm. "You aren't going to come just yet are you? Surely you can last longer? You were a big strong Captain in the army, it must take more than just a little stroking." Tony gloated, knowing full well the situation Steve was in. "You can talk tonight." He added quickly, apparently sensing the resistance within Steve.
Steve nodded to the middle drawer of the unit. "There's some popper folders you can use in there." He informed, turning back to the last remaining sketches. Tony reached over, too lazy to get up, and opened the drawer, pulling out four A3 sized wallets with a folding bit that popped closed.
"Better view point." He said quietly, even though it wouldn't be. Tony would be on his side watching the film so Steve would get the back of his head and his ear.
Usually by this point in their movie nights (often consisting of trilogies or series of multiple films, mostly to keep Steve occupied for long periods of time) Tony's toes would be prodding his thigh in an attempt to get his attention, sometimes he ask what he thought of the film, others he'd simply ask if he was alright. More often than not however it was to make some sarcastic comment about how 'the heroics of the main character were really half-assed in comparison to you Rogers'.
He walks up to the screen and pulls a panel out from the wall next to it. He realises now, that though the room seems endless, it isn’t. It takes several hard looks to see where the floor melds seamlessly into the walls and leaves Steve dizzy with confusion. Tony tugs frustratedly at the wires that come streaming out of the pane.
“What’s with the smiling, Legolas? Have they passed a law to turn all guns into bow and arrows?” he asks grumpily. Steve loves Tony before his third cup of coffee: there’s something infinitely endearing about the way he turns into something between an angry old man and a rebelling two year old when he’s sleepy.
And, for all the bad press this hearing got, it was the one video of Tony that actually made Steve feel like he might like this man. Maybe the way Tony and Colonel Rhodes interacted, even when pitted against each other, made him think of Bucky and himself. An exasperated smile hidden behind closed hands, looks that carry whole conversations…
Strangely, because he’s suddenly seeing it from the wrong side. He’s standing on a large stage, on a disk that turns slowly as if to let him take in the scene. A large crowd is amassed before him, behind him there are fireworks and dancers in outfits so skimpy they almost make him blush. He hates that he still recognises the red and gold bikinis for what they represent: Iron Man costumes. Behind them, between the fireworks and under a glittering night sky are words he’s definitely seen before.
Tony is already getting up and dusting his suit off unnecessarily. There’s an amused look on his face, and when he turns to meet Steve’s gaze it grows into a smug little smirk.
“Absolutely,” says Tony, says Steve with Tony’s voice, mouth moving without his consent. This isn’t any less terrifying the second time around.
“Quiet?” Steve squeaks, while dodging a passing sketch of what looks like a fridge on roller skates, he’s about to look into it more when Tony speaks again.
Suddenly, the warm red gives way to cool, electric blue. It sucks him in, grabs him somewhere behind the eyes, somewhere near the base of his skull and pullspullspulls until he slams, brain first, into that cold, blue wall.
Steve can’t shake the discongruity between this Tony - tapping on his chest, telling government officials where they can shove their opinions, and the Tony and the furious, unstable man he left behind in Siberia.
And in that moment of victory, of pure, unadulterated bliss, Steve does something very, very stupid.
“Not everyone’s brain explodes when they have more than two thoughts at once, Cap,” he says, while signalling for Steve to come closer. Ordinarily, Steve would be offended, as he often is when Tony brags about his genius intellect, but the sheer chaos here is enough to silence him. He moves to stand next to the machine, eyeing it with interest.
That’s enough to shake Steve out of his thoughts. A self-destruct button? The mere idea of it gives him cold sweats.
, right? And Tony Stark? The playboy? Mr. I’ve-slept-with-every-Victoria’s-Secret-Model, Mr. Genius Weapon Builder, Mr. I Shoot Things And Throw Out a One-Liner… He can’t be gay. It just doesn’t track.
Getting into the hospital had been disconcertingly easy; there aren’t many doors a patented Captain America smile can’t open. Still. Steve’s presence here isn’t exactly legal, and just walking on American soil could get him imprisoned. If his smile doesn’t work, Wanda will just have to put whoever is in their way to sleep. That’s one of the reasons he brought her: she’s the best cavalry he has. The other reason is lying in a bed behind one of these doors.
He throws what he was holding behind his back onto the table with such a flourish that Steve almost expects it to be something like the Declaration of Independence. It isn’t, much to his dismay. It’s just a newspaper. Everyone at the table bends over to see what it says that has their friend grinning like a maniac. Steve feels the first tendrils of trepidation curling in his stomach.
“Is this what your mind is like all the time?” Steve asks. He’s not sure if he’s more impressed or concerned. If he had this much going on in his mind it would drive him absolutely insane.
“They’re saying Captain America owns your ass!” Clint tells Tony gleefully, causing him to spit coffee all over the kitchen floor. He’s at the table in two steps, snatching the paper up and reading the headline with narrowed eyes.
Clint turns to him, grin widening impossibly further. Tony just narrows his eyes and starts to aggressively sip his coffee.
Something soft and warm unfurls in Steve’s chest, as if a muscle he’s been clenching all his life has suddenly been released. He can’t help the smile on his lips. Because, he suddenly realizes why he isn’t angry at the news coverage they’ve been getting. It’s because he doesn’t care what they all say. He gets to spend the rest of his life with this gorgeous, brilliant, eccentric man, and he’s looking forward to every single moment.
it! I’m unconscious for half a second and already people are rooting around in my brain! How did you two even get in to see me? Have you been pardoned? I told Rhodey-”
And he would take the violent, frothing man in Siberia over the empty shell on the bed before him now.
The man in the bed looks pale, thin and small underneath the heavy blankets, but someone has been trimming his goatee, and it’s so
After shoving a chair under the door handle, Steve turns to the single bed occupying the room. It looks big and plushy, and not like anything he remembers from his own stays long ago. Wires and tubes snake from the patient to the many machines lining the wall. Soft beeps mark out the staccato beating of a heart.
And then Tony’s hand sliding between Steve’s shoulders and the floor, helping him up just enough to lie in Tony’s lap. His hand curling protectively over the back of Steve’s head, guiding Steve to lean up a little. And then the edge of a water bottle, pressed so carefully to Steve’s lips. Steve didn’t even go to move his arms – he didn’t have to. He just parted his lips and let a burst of cool, clean water wash over his tongue, soothing his dry throat. He was
“Not just yet.” Tony mused “It’ll look weird if we’re just following her around…” And Steve just nodded, and finished the final shot…
But it was too late now. Tony had already fallen into the details of it - which he could remember with the same eerie clarity as that adrenaline fuelled mission. The way Steve had put his entire body into every movement, holding Tony against his chest with such fierce determination, kissing him with a frantic sort of passion, as though he simply couldn’t love Tony enough… The promises and praise that Steve whispered against Tony’s throat, his voice raw and powerful and…
“Oh Steve…” he breathed, running a finger over the barely-visible bullet wound he’d helped to bind just a week ago… He knew how quickly Steve healed. How badly he must’ve been hurt, for there to be any evidence of it now.
“Okay… I’m so sorry about that…” He started – and then, when Bucky’s eyes snapped up to his, full of confusion and anguish, Tony added more forcefully “That was
“And, actually, while we’re giving you credit for being as smart as you are…” Tony breezed on, so naturally…
“Well, the serum enhances human biology more than it changes it… so, yeah, I think that means this stuff can’t make him sick, or whatever…” Rhodey replied, thoughtfully.
But, on the other hand, there was something nice about knowing that they were actually dealing with this thing. As much as Tony would’ve liked to listen to his instincts above all else, there was something more comforting in the idea that they were going to make this work with their lives, and their jobs and their responsibilities. It made everything seem more tangible, more real.
them?” Steve pushed, his eyes alive with interest. Tony was momentarily thrown by the question, and when he hesitated, Steve clarified, “you don’t just make computer simulations, I mean? Or… figure it out on paper, or whatever…”
“...We both have,” Bucky conceded, softening only slightly before he carried on, “but the point still stands! The point is - I know you, Steve. And the reason you can’t answer all these questions is because they all have the
That made this strange, shapeless power feel like something more tangible...something that was making more and more sense, as he replayed that interaction in his mind-
He’d gotten trapped in the occasional spiral, and been briefly overwhelmed by the panic that he somehow had everything all wrong - but, mostly, he’d managed to limit himself to what
Rhodey left a little pause. Then he took a deep breath and rolled his shoulders, obviously gearing up for an in depth response.
Steve fumbled slightly in his haste to unfasten his zipper, the hint of friction already burning through his groin. A jolt of heat cut through his hips, as he wrapped his fingers around his cock and immediately began to stroke himself with rough, fast motions-
It wasn’t everything. There were still as many anxieties about the situation as there had ever been, and that emptiness was still there, and Steve still felt unnervingly emotional, right now… But it had done something for that physical desperation, used up some of that adrenaline.
…Then it would finally make sense why this awful thing had happened to him, why Tony had ended up exactly here, exactly like this.
Which would probably have been the thought that pulled him back into his anxiety, if it weren't for the other thought that stirred at the same time-
He flopped out into his bed with a dramatic sigh, and then laughed at his own ridiculousness. He was well aware of the high he was drifting through, and even aware that it was unusual and unlike him and possibly outright weird - but he was still too soaked through with it to care. Right now, everything in his life seemed to have fallen into some magical, perfect balance-
He strode purposefully to the front door, his temper gathering in his shoulders again the moment he stopped trying to fight it. The memories creeping back to him, like snide whispers in his head,
“Oh, we all know he’s not talking about me,” Rhodey interrupted, in the tone of someone who has been biting their tongue for half an hour. “And he’s not wrong.”
In a weird way, it was like it wasn’t even about sex… Steve had already come. He was already floating in the afterglow of release, entirely physically satisfied, already living the reality of his own perfect fantasy-
Which was so much worse than just accepting he’d wanted it at the time. Of course he’d wanted it at the time – as Tony had been sitting in his lap, it would’ve been humiliatingly obvious how much he wanted it at the time. But he
And he even knew it didn’t make sense. That, objectively, he couldn’t know that, any more than he understood any part of this debacle. That simply feeling very sure of something wasn’t proof that it was right. Even that it was weird to feel a compulsion like that, to hear an internal voice so clear and distinct from everything else….
“That raid you guys went on, when you first found Loki’s sceptre,” he explained, cold and resigned, “she put a vision in Tony’s head of the end of the world, everyone dead except you - you were dying. You told Tony that he could’ve saved everyone, and asked why he didn’t do more, and then you died in his arms. She made him see that and then she let him take the mind stone. It was the beginning of the whole plan.”
“And yet you still have your arm in the sun” Steve reminded him, his voice getting a little tighter. And Tony laughed.
And he thought of Tony’s hands on his chest. A real, physical memory, a moment he could feel and smell and taste. He remembered the thrill that ran through him as Tony pulled his shirt up over his arms…
be doing the wrong thing, that the best people do the wrong thing, that you’ll be letting people down by not doing that wrong thing… Some of that is bound to stick around, even if you figure out it’s wrong. Deciding to do the right thing, and seeing it through, and trusting yourself even when people try to manipulate you,
“I swear.” And he glanced across the table. Andrew had fallen asleep, his head resting on his fist, and Steve was blushing slightly, a strange look on his face…
“It’s one of the things – means whoever is running this place isn’t in it for the money.” Tony explained. “And
tonight. It was perverse enough that he was going to fall asleep alone. And it wasn’t even about fidelity or trust or honour – otherwise, Steve wouldn’t have come here in the first place. It was a very specific instinct, something that wasn’t at all offended that Steve had fucked someone else… but simply couldn’t have him fall asleep next to them.
How could he be honest with Tony about this without being honest about everything? Not even just that he was in love with Tony – about
But if this was his gut trying to tell him that Steve just really needed a hug, having the Avengers crash his meeting probably wouldn’t help…
“Time travel?” Tony cut in - and Steve felt a sharp peak of affection, when he saw that catch Tony’s attention in an entirely different way.
And then he found himself reading Italian place names, and realised that he’d done it again - he hadn’t been listening to any of what he’d just read.
And then he caressed his fingertips into Steve’s muscle, before slowly stroking his palm up, over his shoulder, as he leant into him again. He brought his hand to the side of Steve’s face as he kissed him – deeper, slower kisses now, his other arm wrapping tight around Steve’s waist in a way that was more giving than grasping.
Bucky and I didn’t know anything about how it had happened, and you’d want to know… and I remember thinking that maybe you
He watched Tony think about that for a moment, while a nervous energy started to collect at the pit of his gut…

person who could access the software in the arm, y’know, in case of emergencies?” Bucky carried on the performance, for everyone else’s benefit. “Well, I might’ve accidentally made it so that you are the
Tony gave a low groan in response, his fingers flexing against Steve’s skin. His touch was just a bit rougher when he carried on caressing his way up along Steve’s leg, until he was stroking his hand along the curve of Steve’s ass - Steve arching his back again, to let him.
It wasn’t so much that it brought Steve to his senses, but it vaguely reminded him what ‘his senses’ were. That a whole world existed outside of the reality of this moment, that there were simple worries and human reactions he’d had about things, at one point.
For a start, the research seemed to focus on a few very specific areas – dismissing plenty of potentially interesting findings that fell outside of the scope. For whatever reason, The Facility seemed pretty interested in lowering peoples inhibitions, heightening their sexual gratification, lessening the after effects of traditional drugs, and helping people to feel calm… and entirely
Steve wouldn’t have been able to get as lost in this moment, if Bucky had been standing next to him.
Trying to plan things he could say to Tony, ways he could respond to all the things that Tony might possibly ask.
“…That bad, huh?” Steve grinned, feeling like he was playing a game of Black Jack – actively asking himself how far he could reasonably push this, before he went bust.
He settled himself more firmly, pulling Tony close against his chest as Tony pinned Steve’s hips between his thighs – kissing him the whole time.
Steve might have been able to do any of those things, yesterday. He might have been able to build up to them, at least. Those things might’ve been stepping stones to

wasn’t safe, that he’d thrown Tony’s concentration right before he had to walk into that situation – all because Steve was pretending he wasn’t jealous.
And Tony took a brave little breath, steadying himself. And Steve would’ve intervened again then, just out of instinct. A protective feeling that was growing by the second, a bodily desire to pull Tony against his chest and hush him and tell him everything was going to be okay… But, before he could-
like that. Literally asking if Tony wanted him dead. Talk about dramatic. And entitled – he might as well have asked Tony,
“I, uh… Well, I hate watching the work being done…” Bucky answered, thoughtfully. Hesitating over something.
When he thought of the Avengers, he still thought of an especially courageous little Shawarma restaurant in New York, in 2012. He remembered there being an
sitting somewhere now, repulsed or frightened or uncomfortable with the idea of Tony, was worse than the thought of his secret being announced on the six o’clock news. Tony didn’t care who else found out – which was a worrying thought, in and of itself.
And Steve was always grateful that his body could respond to these orders directly, at moments like these – because he was far too excited to think about it. He scrambled to comply, tugging the sheets behind him, letting them fall away from his shoulders as he knelt in front of the couch-
Of course, it was ‘less inhibited’ that Steve picked up on - but, by now, he could only really recognise it as a familiar reference. An in-joke with the universe.
immediately tried to write lower down the bed, his legs already trying to hook themselves over Steve’s hips-
Bucky’s train of thought was briefly disrupted by a vivid memory of Steve, throwing himself into the couch, and moaning,
JARVIS not to listen to him in the future. If he later demanded that JARVIS lift any block on Steve’s number, or unlock the doors, or disregard
fair to Steve than he would have been to a stranger. He’d not sulked about when Wanda was asked to join the Avengers after Sokovia, the way he had Steve being invited back ‘after what he did to him’.
For a moment, it was so far removed from what he was expecting that Steve couldn’t work out what it was-
There weren’t any words in his head - just this incredible, all-consuming awareness of all the things he’d been trying not to feel…
“Especially if you’re still feeling tired from the trip,” the other picked up, without missing a beat, “but we
your clothes,” the assistant corrected with a performative smile - like they were trying to be nice about a cultural misunderstanding.
“Oh, please Tony…” he breathed, as Tony slowly dragged his tongue over him again, his fingertips still pressing into the curve of his ass. His cock throbbed, drawing all the sensation in his body in a desperate bid to sate this need - this razor-edged pleasure that burned and consumed itself and never quite broke “
And then Steve felt a liquid shiver run over his fingers, as a single drop of blood burst under its own weight.
It still upset him to think of Steve being hurt or lonely, and he did feel that little swell of pleasure when he imagined making Steve happy…
“Well, they’re going to see us anyway, if we stay crouched here like disco armadillos,” Tony countered. “And that’s
“I have no idea what’s going on,” Tony admitted, as contestant number two launched into a dramatic forward roll, “but I don’t think he’s as good as Bruce.”
“Good morning,” Tony replied, with a softness that suggested he already knew something was wrong. “You want some coffee? It’s fresh.”
sorry, for what I did in that bunker.” Tony breathed. “I am sorry that handled the Accords so badly, even if I’d still sign them. And… you know, I’m sorry I’d convinced myself that it wasn’t
And then came the tiny little flinch, somewhere deep in the core of him. That low, irregular tic that fluttered beneath the surface of Steve’s elation, that kept catching on the edges of his attention…
“Okay,” he whispered shyly, dropping his eyes. He heard Tony hum a smile in response, before he rolled onto his back-
“…Hi,” Tony answered, slightly hesitantly. Steve felt his heart stop in his chest, turning to look at Bucky – who was already standing, showing Steve his palms,
He was looking at Steve back in 2012 – and Jesus, even his memories looked different now… He couldn’t remember the old version anymore, with the closed-minded, cocky bully who kept on picking at him… he couldn’t make sense of that version now, couldn’t think how the scenes would all have lined up-
He made endless lists; things he loved about Steve, things he could do to make Steve happy, things he would do to keep Steve safe.
Steve jolted upright, his mind racing to line up details and dates, sure that this was long before Tony worked for SHIELD… And then he remembered Nat’s little stint as Natalie Rushman.
, they weren’t the same assholes actually causing the problems in the first place. If the people calling me an arrogant ideologue weren’t usually in the middle of a plan to
The softness of his lips and the feel of his hands and that sweet little sighing sound that he made…
sorry for that,” he met Tony’s eye and waited for Tony to smile a little acknowledgement. “And I know it’d be hard for your to change your life now, and I know there’s not an easy life for you to change it to – I think you think I don’t get that, but I do. I just… I always thought there were better ways for you to live. It’s not like I haven’t been saying this.”
, lit up by the ethereal glow of the room… Such a human form of perfection… A beauty as layered and complicated and emotional as anything the engineers of Bulsara had created here…
And, okay, yeah – he kept deciding that every part was his favourite part… But there really was something especially magical about those hours they’d spent together afterwards. Maybe even
…Steve was quite pleased that Nick called the room to order before he had the chance to dwell too deeply on that.
Steve’s fierce expression softened only slightly, as the two of them communicated that shared understanding-
“Please Tony, fuck me,” Steve begged, his voice still small and unsteady. Fast realising just how much he wanted Tony to fuck him – that he
Steve froze, his eyes locked on Tony as he hovered, and then paced, his breath occasionally catching as though he was about to say something... and then thinking better of it.
The quiet strength in his shoulders and arms, the sweep of muscle that was usually covered by some form of armour or another…
And it occurred to him to wonder why Peirce hadn’t suggested it - or at least asked how he felt about it…
face he pictured every night before he fell asleep - this younger face, with a different collection of tiny, silvery scars, and that slightly different energy in his eyes.
“Yours, I’m yours, only yours,” sounded as though it was coming from miles away - Tony didn’t even recognise his own voice. He’d forgotten where he ended and the rest of the world began. There was only that thick, pulsing bliss, beating through his body in time with his racing heart.
hadn’t wanted to go with this one, he realised now. He didn’t know why, but confronting the reality of
What if he’d never had the chance to apologise to Tony? What if he never got to hear that Tony also had regrets, and apologies - what if he never got to hear Tony say that he’d missed him?
In the meantime, Tony’s various objections were bubbling up into a shapeless sense of hot, probably disproportionate, outrage-
Steve was gratified when Tony winced at that, glad that he seemed to have the same reaction to it as Steve had.
A hot flush of shame ran up his spine. He’d never done this, in all the time he’d been hidden away. He’d touched himself, of course he had, but only because that bodily, sexual tension became too much to bear. A functional process, designed to meet a purely physical need. He had always relied on generic images, basic fantasy scenarios… some of which might’ve started to look more like Steve, in the last few weeks… But Tony had never inserted
And even if they didn’t. Even if his recent behaviour had tagged him as more of a threat, even if there was a response team on the other side of that door waiting to assassinate him - he still didn’t care.
he recognised just how much he hadn’t wanted to think about work right now. What a relief it was to have dodged that bullet… “Thanks,” he added, softly.
? And each time he remembered it, he came closer to having to acknowledge the truth in it… and everything else Steve had said. And Tony didn’t want to acknowledge that he was being spiteful to Steve, and he certainly didn’t want to think about
He looked at Steve to lead the way, knowing that no one was better at memorising and navigating terrain than he was. He marvelled at the way Steve didn’t have to pause – barely had to glance at his surroundings – to find them a way round to the back of the building… To where they’d successfully guessed that the staircase to the fourth floor would be.
And Steve actually put a hand to his chest, like he was trying to sooth his own heart… while Tony’s began to run away with him…
And then, of course, there were the downsides to that plan. The particular, somewhat queasy risk of going into a situation where they’d
Steve was worried that he might actually burst into tears at any moment - out of which emotion, he didn’t know - so he didn’t dare open his mouth.
just you. I actually wanted to say… I know, it must’ve seemed like you were trying to come up with a solution, and I was just picking holes in it. I know it’s easy to be on the opposition, to have a thousand
“And if I ask you not to move your arms, you won’t,” he said, simply, waiting until he saw Steve’s eager little nod of agreement before he released his wrists.
Obviously, most of that time had been spent perfecting every tiny little detail of his plan. Building his temporary fake identity, securing the specific minimum wage job he needed, memorising the layout of the building and the duty rosters for every department, securing the specialist items he required...
Both Sam and Bucky screwed their eyes shut to think… And then Sam’s brow flickered, and an uncomfortable expression crossed his face…
Every nerve in his body jumped, as he heard the little scuffle of Tony taking something from the top of the cabinet. Every cell seemed to pull closer together, as Tony knelt down behind him-
it began to burn itself out, petering off into a low inconsistent snickering. By then, Steve’s sides ached, his throat was sore, and his whole body felt weak-
moment of sudden empathy, the same gesture of solidarity, like he was every bit as excited to find someone that related to this as Steve was.
A couple of hundred yards away, Tony could just about make out Clint and Scott, organising a large group of humans… behind that, Wanda was standing next to Sam, while he yelled impatient commands. A continual movement of others – human and Varian – forming weary lines that marched through the crowd. The unmistakable shapes of Rocket and Groot, directing traffic.
And then he felt Tony’s fingers dig into the sensitive flesh at the bend of his waist, and a shock of wonderful pain run through his muscles,
have a point, when I said that you made some reckless choices, for selfish reasons, and you should apologise for it… And then I went off on a rant, and gave a whole bunch of examples you could probably argue with, and analogies you could pick to pieces… I did turn ‘you made reckless choices, for selfish reasons’ into ‘you are a reckless, selfish asshole’. Which wasn’t fair – but it doesn’t make those underlying points any less right, or any less important, either.” He could feel Steve nodding as he spoke “So, you know, even if you sober up and think that there were probably a few things you just said that were a bit… over the top, and probably not your best examples – I still know you did have
And Tony simply waited, patiently, as Steve caught his breath, and gathered himself for the big finish.
want to devote myself to you, for the record - that’s still something I want for myself, just so you know…” He refocused on Tony’s face, watching the way his forehead creased with confusion or concern, before Steve clarified, “but I really did just figure out that it doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive, or whatever. That being this is love with you and this devoted to you doesn’t mean I can’t let you in. I think I just figured out how much I want to let you in… That this is what I always wanted, if I’d been brave enough to think that way…”
“And of course, the Irish have a proud history of cooking with corned beef,” Steve added, with a wry smile. “I mean, I don’t know that they
“The drugs you will each be taking are very similar, and share many of the same effects. They both come under the same name. And the primary effects of taking Fantasia, for both of you, will be lowered inhibitions, increased physical sensitivity, and a heightening of basic physical responses…”
...Maybe living together and making vacation plans and even getting married one day could all be a part of it-
between him and Tony, whether it was a rivalry or a competition or a friendship… something that Steve actually felt a part of. Seeing Tony again always felt like it was adding to the story of
Steve thought again of his younger self. He thought of a man who was, by now, a total stranger, about to embark on an entirely different life to the one Steve had known. A man who had the same face and family history as he did… but not much else.
A second too late he realised that he was dizzy. He was forced to let his weight fall into the back of the chair, his body curling in on itself as a swell of panic bloomed in his head-
And Steve didn’t know what about it was so endearing, exactly. Maybe it was simply that it was so very
And then Bucky stopped himself and took a long, slow breath. He dropped his shoulders, deliberately softening his voice before he started again,
have plans for the day - that he was supposed to be meeting what was left of the Avengers that afternoon.
And, oh, how Steve wanted to tell Tony all the things he loved about him, all the reasons he’d be lucky to have him, how proud he’d be if he could call Tony his-
And as he was talking, he could feel Tony’s back getting stiffer – until, eventually, he sat up, his eyes still fixed on Steve. Like he was being drawn into what Steve was saying. And Steve felt the slightest flutter of the old anxiety then… a worry that he was about to say something wrong, a memory of that instinct to shut up…
He felt the air between them crackle, a sudden static sensation all over his skin. Then he saw Tony glance at Bucky, a flicker of thought behind his eyes before he looked back at Steve, apologetically. But Steve just nodded – he understood.
It might still be true that Steve would love Tony in any timeline, under any circumstances - for all the inherent, inalienable qualities that made him uniquely
He kissed Steve again, warm and slow and deep, caressing his arms possessively across Steve’s back. A low, tingling thrill ran though his skin as he felt Steve relax into it – at the way Steve couldn’t decide where to put his hands…
Tony snuggled closer to him again, a silent agreement to listen. But before Steve could begin his explanation, Tony warned him again,
He thought back to his uneasy self-reflection, in those first few days, when he’d first started to wonder if he’d actually been mad at Steve for just not loving him back. When he first asked himself whether it was fair to be angry at Steve because his feelings had been hurt.
reliant on Steve’s blood. Or addicted to it, maybe. And they both knew how much good it had done him… Would Steve feel free to walk away from this arrangement, even now? Would he feel like he was costing Tony something, if he decided he didn’t want this anymore? Would he still pretend to be willing, even if he grew to hate it?
And the basic instinct to fix that was more real and more urgent than any of the many catastrophes playing out all around him. When Tony stepped forward and put a hand to Steve’s shoulder, he
“Well, no… And I don’t think those things would be considered the same, anyway…” Tony continued to muse…
escaping his throat as Tony scraped his nails over his skin, his head swimming as his entire body tensed down towards Tony’s hand.
“You have to remember, most people who end up as the CEO of a major company are more driven than that” Tony threw himself forward in the conversation, like he could literally outrun an intervention from Steve if he got enough words between them in time. “And it
“But did you hear the crowd though?” Nat enthused. And Tony nodded in agreement, because she had a point on that one - even though he didn’t understand the rules of this competition, and he had no idea what marked a good performance out from a bad one, it was certainly true that the crowd had gone nuts for Bruce. Which only made Tony smile more…
“Hey, you’re okay,” Tony reassured, automatically. Bucky turned to face him, his eyes still not quite focused-
about the Accords.” Steve told him, when Tony met his eye. “I’m sorry that I boiled it all down to that, and didn’t think enough about the other side of it, especially since I’ve been back. And… you know,
“So, one group of Varians in helping to enslave another.” Steve summarised, and sank heavily into the couch. “Thinking about it, I don’t know why I’m saying it like it’s ridiculous. People enslaving people from their own species, wow, never heard of that before…” And then his eyes snapped up to Tony, and he seemed to gather himself a little bit. “Sorry, not helpful” He muttered, with a little smile.
wanted to make that part of the plan with you. I wanted to make sure you were a part of everything, this time… But, however we do it, I just don’t see how we’re going to be able to do it any faster. But hey, if we can, then great…” He finished with a shy flourish.
He’d tried to explain that Steve hadn’t done anything wrong in offering… trying to make himself feel better by making Steve feel better. Thinking of how much it would hurt
Steve still felt like a pledge of fidelity was something for him to make, rather than for him to negotiate with Tony. It still felt weird, that they were supposed to have a discussion,
“Yeah…” he nodded, pinching his lips against an unexpected threat of the giggles. “Fury already got in touch, by the way.” Tony’s eyes lit up with a nervous hope, that was, for whatever reason, completely adorable...
Tony could feel the beginnings of that euphoria clouding into his mind as he licked that beautiful taste from Steve’s skin. A warmth and brightness seeping into everything, like a sudden burst of sunlight.
This was that very familiar, perfectly human response to suddenly recognising yourself in the cold light of day - of looking at yourself and asking,
“I don’t know, Nick - the last time I worked with you on one of my dad’s old projects, I got stabbed in the neck with a needle and locked in my own house,” Tony reminded him. “You’ll forgive me if I’m a teensy bit sensitive.”
me what this secret project is” Tony told her, confidently. “I’m going to be getting him to tell me what I need to know, to work it out for myself.”
indoctrinated by the toxic values of Earth, that they feel badly for what they experience here. You know, the mistake all these people are making – the mistake
He felt Steve grip him by the hips, his thumbs curling over the waistband of Tony’s pants and rubbing little circles against Tony’s bare skin… But there was something almost hesitant about it. Like he was being careful of something. Tony broke the kiss and looked up at him, and saw the briefest flicker of a question across his brow.
All the regrets he’d accepted, so that he wouldn’t have to regret other things… The people he couldn’t be there for, if he wanted to be there for others.
Eventually his eyes focused on a very pretty woman, in a long black dress with red lace trim. And somewhere, it did ring a bell.
Which certainly wasn’t the reaction that Tony was actually having - although he was doing his best to hide that from Nick.
But he knew Tony would tell him it was none of his business. That he’d lost any right to ask how Tony was feeling… and the trouble was, Steve knew he had a point. So, what could he say?
– when he saw Tony standing there… A more than human feeling, like his body understood what this connection really was.
“You deserve to rest, Steve. You deserve to let go of all those burdens, to be safe and warm and happy, to feel good,” he whispered. Watching, entranced, as Steve listened to him. “You
to like him as much as that. It was one thing to think that Steve wanted him, that he really wasn’t disgusted by him, that Steve might even have developed a crush on him… and, to be honest, all of that was overwhelming enough.
There was a giddying rush of freedom, something that felt so familiar and so foreign all at once – something he’d known so well, but such a long time ago… It had been years since Steve just
“For a picture of you,” Wesley mumbled, averting his eyes again. Tony made a big show of letting go of a frustrated sigh, and pointedly gathering his patience again.
feel badly about the sort of friend he’d been for twenty years, and he kind of thought it was right that he felt a little bit bad about it – that he actually acknowledged his mistakes, and cared about them, and remained motivated to change…
“No one is going to take this from you,” he whispered, sincerely. “Whatever happens, I promise – we have as long as you want, for whatever you want.”
And Steve swore he could literally feel his heart break. Like his chest had caved in, and he was already dying. It was only the shock of it that stopped him from sobbing-
that Tony had chosen to give him something beautiful, and soft, and indulgent, as a gift for tonight.
And when Steve kissed him, it was like Tony’s entire body just surrendered to it. An immediate, physical response, like some primal reflex that he’d not used in so long… but was still so basically, humanly
But this wasn’t a supernatural impulse. This wasn’t some new instinct that he had no context for - he
The first one came in a plain white box, made of thick, matte cardboard - all the more intriguing for how little it gave away. Steve actually held his breath as he slid the lid free-
He had far more experience, far more prior knowledge and far more warning than he had the first time he took on Hydra. He was far better prepared, and armed with far more contingencies.
, there have been plenty of times that I haven’t been thinking about it, anyway…” he sighed, sadly, taking a breath like he was about to add something… and then shaking his head, like he’d thought better of it. “And it doesn’t actually

do after something like that happened – how they’d end up in that situation in the first place. He was aware, in the abstract, that he wanted it… But it was a bit like being in a hostage situation and just ‘hoping someone would rescue you’. You can’t daydream about it if you can’t think of a plan yourself. If you don’t know what the thing you want looks like, you can’t picture it.
The door at the front of the room opened with a click, and Steve flinched more forcibly than he should have. He was too busy trying to untense his jaw to even think about what the interruption might be – he barely recognised his own name, when the nervous clerk politely enquired, “Captain Rogers?”
So, by the morning, he’d managed to boil all of his thoughts and fears into one question. He’d managed to simplify it all into a single choice.
Ongoing apologies for delays, and to anyone whose comment I haven't gotten around to yet - and continued thanks to everyone that is reading, and feeding back. Honestly, this fic is life giving to me at the moment, and the response has meant so much, so thank you!
But then he saw the way Steve shrank back, and immediately, Tony’s heart broke for him. That impulse to throw his arms around him was still there, stronger than ever, on top of everything else-
“Shhh. Listen. It’s going to be okay, and you can say all of that, and I promise, everything will be okay at the end of this – but you
“Actually, mostly, it was women,” Steve answered. “Meeting… other men, was a bit trickier, back then. But, yeah, there were some.”
There was no hint of malice in anything about him, no competitiveness, or ego, or self-preservation. Everything was soft and kind and reassuring, from the look in his eyes to the way he held his body. The gentle, understanding tone of his voice… calm and sweet and
…This was exactly the sort of thing that frightened Steve, usually. These time pressured, no-win situations, where there was no way of working out the right answer-
And just as Steve was about to lose himself in another round of giddy reminiscing, there came a knock at the door.
And now Steve was worried that Tony might be seriously ill right now – but he couldn’t find the right way to ask him.
“I understand that you must be a little overwhelmed,” Scaramouche placated, “and, of course, you don’t yet know the prize you’ve been given - it’s natural. But you’ll have to trust me. When you
“They’re not being secretive; they’ve just forgotten that those things feel very important when you first get here.” Dev assured. “And we understand that, so, a few things you may be wondering about.” He pointed back up at the screen. “For a start, as you may have gathered, we’re not on earth – I hope you were prepared for at least that much?”
to do at the time. I’ll think about what you’re feeling and why you say these things, and I’ll just do my best not to add to that, and I’ll leave it to your real friends. That’s the deal. That’s the fantasy – so you tell me. This is a Yes/No question, so you can just nod – are you uncomfortable with this, and do you want to go?”
my genuine hurt were probably things that weren’t fair, or real, or really your fault. You know…There are a few things
He felt every sensation more keenly, he saw everything in more detail, he could hear entirely new layers of sound echoing in the building around him. His whole body seemed to burn with a sheer abundance of everything, an energy that was created faster than he could consume it.
“You,” Rhodey answered, gesturing at him. “Being all… giddy. What happened? Did Steve propose, or something?”
there. And, without that, there was just the unexpected delight of finding someone who shared a niche interest. The thrill of having someone
“No, Tony, no, no, no, that’s not what I meant,” Steve interrupted, his confused hesitancy immediately overwhelmed by a desperation to explain-
was happening to him now. Something distinct from the emotional elation and the physical euphoria… A specific feeling of intoxication, of something separate and deliberate shifting his perspective, his senses…
Actually, it was something of a comfort to be able to look over to Bucky and get a sympathetic smile. Even though Steve would have hated for anyone else at the table to know what was going on, he was very glad that there was one person who knew
And then Steve fingertips brushed over that sweet spot, deep inside him. Tony felt his whole body contract around Steve’s hand, every sensation being dragged down to that one point.
And he shuffled closer to Steve, until their legs were touching, before he looked up and caught his eye in a more deliberate way…
Instinctively, he knew he’d have more luck snapping himself out of this if he thought of Siberia than if he thought of Anni-Vara. Which was horrible, obviously, and probably meant that he was a shallow, self-interested asshole – but those were the facts he was dealing with. The plight of a whole alien race probably wouldn’t be enough to tear him out of this moment… if it had been real. But remembering it wasn’t… remembering that moment, when he asked Steve
. You made an effort not to do it again – and you never did. That’s the hard part about being sorry… and you did actually do that… and I never even noticed, because you didn’t say.”
But whenever his frantic thoughts about Tony quietened, even a little bit, there was that tortured scream from his memories. The constant, almost physical reminder that Steve couldn’t rest anywhere, tonight.
Tony barked, as Steve wrapped his fingers around his cock, his hips bucking from under him so sharply that it jolted his spine. And then he felt the slow drag of Steve’s palm over the length of him, and then the electric shock of his thumb running roughly over the head of his cock… and then, almost immediately, that low, urgent ache –
“It’s for special occasions.” The little girl replied, earnestly. “Our parents have to work very nearly all the time, so when they don’t have to work, it has to be very extra special, and that’s what it’s for. Except, now you came, they don’t have to work very nearly all the time anymore. So. You can have this.” And the little girl glanced back over her shoulder, hopeful and enquiring… and Tony followed her gaze to where a group of adult Varians were huddled, teary-eyed and overwhelmed…
and then he glanced back at Steve, a warm confidence in his expression as he murmured, “come on, let’s go.”
“It’s fine, we can handle that side of things” Steve assured her. “The real question is what we’re going to do with him once we’ve questioned him.”
– he’d made that perfectly clear from day one. And Steve could only be in awe of Tony from a distance, because if Tony had known some of the ways in which Steve admired him, then life in The Tower would’ve become just too complicated for Steve to cope with. Steve could never let on that there were things he
Now, after so many nights of terrible sleep, and so many hours of mental exertion, Tony couldn’t muster the resolve to control his mind anymore-
“It’s okay, you’re a terrible liar anyway,” Tony joked effortlessly, and Steve had to really concentrate to keep from choking on his food when he laughed.
Steve looked up at him, watching Bucky’s face as a careful consideration melted into a measure of relief… Steve knew Bucky well enough to read his expression. He could almost hear what he was thinking.
delicious, by the way – they knew that they’d barely scratched the surface, on their little tour. That there were actually at least three levels, that private parties happened on the third floor –
“Okay, Captain Rogers, just take a deep breath for me,” Stape was speaking in the tone of a doctor now, his hesitance forgotten as he rushed over to Steve’s side-
life with Steve was better than being without him - however strange or dark or outside the realm of his imagination.
And then Tony took Steve’s hand, and squeezed, and Steve felt it flood his entire body like a liquid heat. He might even have whimpered softly. He let Tony lead him over to the bed – dragging his step just a little bit, just so that he could feel Tony tugging against him. And then Tony came to a stop, and turned to face him, and Steve damned near bumped right into him. His free hand automatically went to Tony’s arm, to steady himself…
attention to this place if, on paper, it just looks like a new Stark intern has moved in, and they get deliveries like a normal person,” Tony corrected, casually. “And, if anyone looks into it, some guy named Jones is staying here, and apparently he likes Chinese food - Chinese food?” He looked to Steve for confirmation.
use Siberia as the base, then at least it would probably mean the super soldiers got killed trying to stop us…” Steve winced. “Which
Two days later, Steve was strolling into the Joint Dark Mission Facility in Nevada, Nick Fury walking in moody silence just ahead of him, exactly as planned-
He literally bounced on the balls of his feet for a second before he started his run down to the front door. He reached the first-floor landing in three wide bounds-
“Oh yeah…” Bucky squinted. “And then Nat did that lullaby thing, and you kept asking her why she didn’t do it earlier…”
Thankfully, he managed to avoid stepping in anything unpleasant as they crept those final few feet, between a cluster of booths, to far left corner of the room. From here they could see there was actually a gap, between the bar running along the left-hand wall, and the bar running along the back – a narrow walkway that would’ve been entirely invisible, if the little door there hadn’t been open a crack, letting just enough light leak through…
him… But he hadn’t been a part of it. Bucky hadn’t been there to tell Tony the truth, or otherwise… He was stuck in the grey area between feeling responsible and not having anything tangible to apologise for…
something unusual in his features, or whether it was just a vague family resemblance hidden behind a posed expression and a lot of hair product. Seeing as staring at that one photograph for twenty minutes hadn’t helped Steve to figure it out…
the way Steve’s body changed, the strength that closed around Tony like a blanket, the intention coiling in Steve’s muscles…
It wasn’t Clint’s original farmhouse. Like billions of people around the world, Mrs Barton and her children had woken from a deep sleep to find that their home was no longer theirs - in their case, because Clint had abandoned it to become a lone vigilante, leaving it to be claimed by a string of squatters before it had been claimed by the elements.
And then Steve suddenly broke away, his arms immediately tense, and when Tony glanced up he saw Steve’s face creased with concern.
“I think maybe to begin with I just didn’t want to know,” he confessed, glancing down at his hands. “Not even because I thought it would be something bad. It’s just… right at the beginning, it seemed like there was so much shit to deal with… I don’t think I wanted to ask about
He grabbed a washcloth and began to scrub harshly at his arms. He wished the soap at The Facility wasn’t so soft, he wished he had something harsh and abrasive, something that might leave his skin feeling dried out and raw. He wished he
“Seems like it sometimes.” And then he let his head fall into his hands with a soft little groan. “Why would Zan lie to us?”
“Huh,” Tony managed. He was taken aback by how much that affected him - by how surprised and fundamentally
Feeling Tony come over his stomach in intermittent, stuttered bursts as Steve just fucked him harder
“J?” He called out, nervously. He really didn’t have the vaguest recollection of JARVIS announcing anyone, this time.
And then the faint scratch of Tony’s teeth, a shock of friction that tore through him, mercilessly taunting that growing desire. A stab of visceral satisfaction, like finally finding an itch – the scorching frustration of not quite being able to get at it. The torturous ecstasy of teasing
people are all volunteers, in every sense of the word – investors, as a matter of fact. The Luis’, who I believe you’ve met” And he pointed sharply at Andrew, now lounging quite naturally on his bed “have been funnelling money into this place via their daughter for three years-”
. The caress of Steve’s hands, slowly working their way up his back now, the perfect softness of Steve’s skin under his palms, the growing ache of him rocking gently against Tony’s hips.
He thought of stepping out of that elevator instead, grabbing Tony with both hands and pulling him hard against his chest.
of my houses, at least, where we can keep an eye on him - and where no one else would have a right of access to him, or anything…”
And now, in an instant, he had no idea why. He had no idea what he was in the middle of saying, what was supposed to come next – what the fuck he was going on about.
If there was no way to tell the difference between tiredness and temper and intoxication, did it really matter what the cause?
A younger version of Tony would probably have thought it very sad that he was going to spend his birthday alone in a hotel room. He wouldn’t have guessed that one day he’d be making considerable efforts just to be
known what to do with his face – or his head, or his heart. There was just no way to process the hundreds of thousands of things that Steve had just unearthed, no way to rethink his whole entire life as quickly as Steve was just laying it all out for him. He couldn’t place or name or make sense of any of the emotions that were suddenly welling up in him-
. I don’t want to have to tell him no… I don’t know if I trust myself to tell him no, which really means I don’t trust myself not to hurt him. And if he just got caught in the moment, or if he just thought it would be fun or just thought I was hot, or whatever… Then hey, maybe that could’ve just been a thing that happened. And maybe it could just have been… good at the time, and maybe that’d be something, however much it hurt afterwards. But if he wants to keep doing this… If he somehow thinks that we could just get to know each other better, or there’s somewhere to ‘see where it goes’… That just makes the whole thing even more complicated. And… dangerous.”
The pleasure of it throbbed through Steve, right down into the core of his spine, pulsing through his shoulders. He gasped, and gagged, and tried to say something like
He wrapped an arm tight across Tony’s hips, taking his weight completely as he shuffled back towards a nearby sun lounger that was standing at the edge of the pool – thinking only of getting to the nearest soft surface. He sat down on the end of it with a somewhat graceless bump, Tony still held in his lap.
No one wants to be caught unintentionally aroused by the Pack Omega. No one with any ounce of respect (or fear) for Steven anyway.
“You have given him foolish notions.” Gregory retorts, “He has come to believe in... liberal ideology. But he will learn. I will re-make him.”
“I’m sorry,” Anthony rushes, hands reaching out to Steven’s cheeks, where a few tears have spilled, “I’m sorry, I don’t – Steve, I’m sorry, please don’t cry.”
Steven’s mind is racing, trying to stitch this revelation with what he knows. The week after Stane’s death, Anthony had been quiet, almost distant. Steven had worried that he’d shown him too much of his darkness, and Anthony didn’t want any part of it. But the week had passed, and Anthony had been normal again. Steven had been giddy with relief, had told himself he would be patient from then on. He wouldn’t push Anthony again.
“A monster.” Steven corrects, “A monster. And he is mine to take out of this world, burn him until he is but hair and ashes, and even then, scatter them so that he may have no possibility of revival and that his legacy will be --”
He watches Steve meander forward, a warrior at ease. His gaze is warm, a distinct contentedness in the curl of his eyes that sings a clear tune to Anthony. It seems a lifetime ago that the Alpha had seemed like unmarked stone, inscrutable and plain.
It is a challenge, to know how Steven sees him, to know he believes Anthony to be his equal. It is a standard to live up to, but one that Anthony can’t help but crawl towards, dogged and uncertain in equal measure. Anthony had always wished for something brighter to look to, in those high castles with their long walls and his brain cycling through his future like a well-worked wound.
But in those early days, even the tiniest glimpse of humanity, weird and goofy, had been a blessing.
When his phone turns on, Steve pulls up the camera and puts it in selfie mode. He feels Tony stiffen at the sight of his eyes, now black.
“Don’t push me out. Please.” Tony begs, and he thinks maybe it’s wrong, wrong to be so selfish in light of Steve’s pain, but it isn’t as if Steve doesn’t know the ugliness of Tony’s brain, of his self-centeredness and greed and insecurity. Steve’s hands are like brands where they land on Tony’s back, solid as iron. It's the same, he thinks, slightly dizzy, the way Steve holds him, tight and close like he wants to mould Tony to him. That never changed.
The Avengers that surround Steven look to him now, eager for blood. It’s not unlike Schmidt’s people, Anthony realises, finally placing that unsettling unfamiliarity. The gaze of warriors looking to the Alpha for permission to release the beast inside.
“The truth is,” Steven offers, voice low. Anthony blinks back at him in surprise. “I don’t think you’ll want me if you see me for what I am.”
Steven’s breath catches at the quiet worry in Anthony’s eyes, apparent now only because Anthony has let it be seen. It is a more frequent sight now; Anthony letting him see how he actually feels, blooming like a flower only in Steven's direction. His breath still falters every time.
“Maybe I started off with a vision, with hope and dreams of a brighter future, but years of battle have scraped that youth off. And now, I am just a shell, triggered into action only by the rage in me. What I want with you, what I dream – it can not work if you have to, to deal with that. So yes, I hide and I keep things to myself. But it isn’t because I don’t trust you, only that I couldn’t stand it if you found me lacking.”
“Oh jeez, look at the time! Let’s sleep!” Steve says, pushing them both into the mattress and quickly covering Tony with the comforter.
“You were throwing a fit – rightfully, of course – but nonetheless, a fit, about not being touched. What was I to say?” Steven asks, good-humouredly.
All they need is a command, the slightest acknowledgement to let loose. Something about it is familiar.
He goes through the plan, not because they need reminding, but because his brain needs something to ready against.
When the scritching sound resumes, Anthony closes his eyes, letting himself relax fully into the furs.
“...uh...We fight today so that our children will not...not have to. The blood that is shed today will be for...justice..uh...
“I got the mission rundown from Director Carter, and I know, sweetie, you didn’t do anything wrong. What happened to Tony, it wasn’t your fault.” His mom says.
“I think maybe we are in the same boat here.” Thor says finally, words carefully weighed out. “And I was hoping, that perhaps, you have understood something I can’t.”
After a few minutes, Anthony shifts back. His nose is red, and his eyelashes darkened with wetness, but his gaze when it meets Steven’s is dignified.
Steve immediately turns to draw him onto his chest. Tony comes willingly, and rests his head at Steve’s collarbones. Steve puts his arms around his back, keeping him in place. Another mark of their well-oiled routine.
It’s thicker there, somehow, and Bucky removes his Winter mask. He attempts to put it on Anthony, and he scrambles away, shaking his head. Bucky eventually holds him in place and puts it on, arguing that he’s got better lung capacity.
There are days when he keenly feels the difference between his youth and Steven’s, watching how Bucky loosens his fists for Anthony, comes at him soft and slow.
“Aww, good try.” Gregory claps, and then tilts his head at them, “You didn’t think it would be that easy, did you?”
“I think I’ll do that. But, more subtle.” Bucky reaches for his phone, before remembering it’s turned off, “Tones, help me compose the message.”
She lashes out, impossibly fast, finally ticked off. She grabs him by his wrist, pulls him forward and into herself. Knocks his head with the blunt of her dagger.
“Thanks.” Tony breathes out, after a few moments of contemplative silence. The word comes out sincere and shy. Steve smiles as Tony nudges over the second custard donut in silent offering.
“Ditto, you righteous idiot.” Tony says, heart beating like a drum in his chest, “And where do you get off assuming I’m gonna get hurt? I’m the tank of our team. I literally have a tank in my body.”
“I don’t --” Anthony cuts off. “You are a much better person than I could ever be. Just look at what you’ve accomplished.”
Anthony finishes awkwardly, skin reddening slightly, the tint only barely noticeable on his olive skin.
“Then let me take care of you. Let yourself rest.” Tony replies, digging his hands into the meat of Steve’s shoulder. Steve’s eyes widen at the motion, mouth gasping slightly.
“Don’t know, man! The big boss has dinner with him everyday, playing silly games in his room. Can’t tell you where that is, though. Got no clue, honest!”
Anthony looks pensive, sitting by the pond. Steven approaches slowly, notes the moment Anthony feels him coming, the omega turning his head to watch him come nearer with dark eyes. When he’s close enough, Anthony gets up, draws Steven down onto the rock, and then smoothly sits himself on Steven’s knees. Steven wraps his arms around the omega, nuzzling the nape of Anthony’s neck, breathing in his scent and immediately lighter by the assurance of Anthony’s closeness.
Two cannonballs get shot, one to the right and the other to the left. They’re aimed to go over the wall, wreak havoc on the courtyard. Instead, they clang against an invisible barrier, rippling across what seems like empty space before rolling over and off the wall.
“You did it, Steve.” Anthony says, smiling at the shine that makes itself known in Steven’s gaze, “You won.”
Steve waits on the precipice of something. The sky is fighting itself but Thor is nowhere to be seen.
“Maybe, maybe when we bonded.” Anthony admits, “But I had three escape plans within the first month. I could have definitely left.”
Steve’s pretty sweaty, but Tony still crawls onto Steve’s chest, resting his head just below Steve’s collarbones.
Steve had said it then, a secret he’d never admit to anyone else in the years that came. “It felt good.”
didn’t hear anything. It was only when he spoke that we recognised him as Schmidt.” The story pours quickly out of Bucky, the clacking drawl of Brooklynite slicing through the edges of his sentences, a stronger indicator for his panic than any gesture.
“Just let me help you.” Tony finishes, and he feels Steve shudder, his lips pressing into Tony’s temple, an open-mouthed caress that isn’t quite a kiss but isn’t quite anything else.
Natasha occasionally helps out, forcing Anthony into flexible and strange positions that pull at muscles he didn’t know he had. Still, despite their shared designation, she’s a deadly force with an ingrained sense for fighting that is difficult to translate onto others, and it often falls to Bucky to take Anthony through the steps.
There’s been a rubber band in his throat, stretching his throat dry and taut, since he heard the Director’s orders through the comms link after his exam. Carter’s always been unflappable in battle, a ceaseless force that adjusts to temperature and circumstance with ease. But in her call to pack it up and debrief, her voice had been rough, snarling, at Steve of all people.
He goes through every piece of furniture in the room in a similar manner; picks them apart, tears them open, looks through pillows and light fixtures. His breath slows, body thrumming still. It’s about four minutes in that he stops, stands in the wreckage of the room, and comes to terms with the fact that there’s nothing here.
“Hold that thought, in your mind.” Anthony says, drawing a hand down Steven’s torso. The ridged planes, hand tracing lower and lower, reflecting in the dilation of Steven’s pupils. “Keep it there, fully formed.”
Tony mumbles his approval, and Steve breathes in at controlled lengths, pulling the blanket over them both. It takes some re-adjusting but ends with Tony in the cocoon of Steve’s arms, a warm light that Steve holds with ill-concealed glee.
Two minutes later, they’re closing the door behind them, and the guard is staring at a wall, having conveniently forgotten anyone ever interrupted his shift. If someone were to look very closely, they might just see a glint of red in his eyes.
Then the tide turns. Within a week, the media have decided that the Avengers are liars. Wild theories and conspiracies crop up all over the place, the one more outlandish than the next. Some people say there must be blackmail involved, others are saying that the whole relationship is a publicity stunt to make the Avengers more accessible to a younger audience.
“For the sake of both of our lives, I think it’s probably best if we don’t discuss this issue while we’re stuck in my mind. It might have serious repercussions for both of us.”
“I know you’ve had your differences, heck, so have I, but... he doesn’t deserve to die like this. No one does. I’ll find my way out, I always do.”
“Tony…” he warns in his Captain America voice. Unfortunately, that tone doesn’t work on Tony, it only serves to rile him up.
But it’s not just that. No, the Tony Stark that steps out of the limousine isn’t the normal, extravagant Tony Stark. It is an
Around them, hovering in the air, are screens: some with film reels, some with complicated schematics. Numbers scroll past here and there in fast flashes of the brightest blue. Multiple voices overlap and coalesce, echoing disembodied through the space around them.
Tony eyes him for a moment, expression unreadable behind the glasses. Steve’s heart is in his throat, beating a mile a minute. He’s ready for an argument or a fight. He’s not ready for what actually happens: civility.
“CAPTAIN AMERICA GROPES IRON MAN,” he reads aloud, before turning around and winking at Steve, “He sure does!”
One of the interviewers, probably well aware of how good Tony Stark is at dealing with the press, directs his question to Steve instead. The poor man won’t know what hits him.
He gets to his knees and stretches to feel if all his limbs are still attached. They are. A loud groan sounds from somewhere to his right and Steve looks over to see a crumpled heap which vaguely resembles Tony. They both stand up, panting and Steve has to repress the urge to step closer and either check his friend over or clock him in the face.
Cameras start flashing like crazy, there are audible gasps to be heard throughout the gathered crowd. Because, despite the controversy surrounding the supposed hoax and queer-baiting, despite the rumours that their relationship must have been a publicity stunt, Iron Man and Captain America have come as dates.
Steve smiles and nods in return, then runs his gaze over Tony. Bucky is going to kill him for this, but for once he doesn’t really care. It’s time to get his friend back. He shakes off his nerves and then looks back up at Wanda.
“I’m not going to be angry because they don’t think I’m gay enough to grab a man’s ass,” he says eventually, then he winks, “Besides, we both know I do much more than just
care for Tony. He always has, even if sometimes he wants to throttle the man. But it’s the kind of caring that goes unnamed because there are no words for it. It’s deep and all-encompassing, and all the more terrifying for it.
It takes a moment for him to get his bearings. He’s flat on his back, with Tony leaning over him, in a glistening white room which seems to have no beginning or end. To one side he can make out what looks like a white TV screen, and to another he can see a speaking pew. For his part, Tony is dressed in one of his immaculate business suits, hair slicked back with pink hued glasses on his nose.
“Are you going to fuck me at any point?” Tony asks, grinning into the kiss. Steve laughs, kissing him one more time before pulling away.
“Mmm.” Steve closes his eyes in affirmation. He’s present, almost unbearingly so, can feel every point of skin where his body meets Tony’s, where the curves and edges of their bodies soften to accommodate each other.
The Hydra soldiers turn in eerie unison to Steven standing on the edge of the roof. Bucky, Natasha, Bruce, Sam and T’Challa flank him. How they managed to silently approach the presumed best of Hydra is beyond Anthony, but the obviously unnerved reaction of the soldiers is damn satisfying.
Steve wrings the towel out and pads over to Tony, settling down on the bed again. He moves in slow, careful motions over the younger boy’s face, wiping out grime and blood and sweat. He’d found the towel in the first aid kit, and the small square fabric isn’t really thick enough to be of actual use. Still, Steve can’t not do it.
The drawing was something Anthony had learned of in bits and pieces. It is an instinct incongruous to Steven’s warlord reputation; a part of his childhood that stubbornly held onto the Alpha’s heart even through the deepest tragedies. He reaches for chalk when he’s safe, when the beauty around him is true enough that he forgets who he is.
Steve turns to see Tony grimacing, his eyes fluttering awake. Steve drops the burger on the table, and runs over, his hand immediately reaching to grasp Tony’s hand.
The blood unnerves Steven and he turns a sharp corner, starting the route to the barracks. He doesn’t need to turn to know that Bucky is keeping pace behind him, eyes out for anyone following them. They walk quick and silent, uninterrupted through the corridors. The walls are unremarkable, stone, no coverings. Just light fixtures burning in a steady yellow light at the center of each path.
Steven’s army occupies most of the field. Black-clad bodies are strewn across the ground, some of their people too, but mostly Hydra. Above all, red soaks the scene. It is a gory sight, in the bloody heart of which Steven stands, natural as anything.
Anthony should perhaps be self-conscious; he’s dirty and sweaty. But Steven is light in a way almost rare these days with the dark cloud of Schmidt’s return casting an ever-present shade over him.
“It’s true, sweetie,” His mom says, “We’re going to have the brightest minds on this, right? And don’t you say there’s no problem Tony can’t fix? It’ll work out, Steve, it always does.”
Steven had shadowed Anthony when they’d reached camp, and the omega had teasingly asked for space to clean up, a wish that Steven had granted only after seeing the desperation in his eyes. He’d left Anthony with a kiss, long and possessive enough that Clint had groaned his disgust from the clearing.
