Shortly after Dean and Lisa went upstairs Cas walked into the house looking for Dean, he was instantly hit with the foul smell of weed and cheap alcohol, he tried to find Dean but failed, after 15 minutes of endless looking for his boyfriend, Cas began to try and find Lisa's friends. Dean would always stay with people he knew so he must be with Lisa. Cas found Hester getting some beer and went up to her, she always hung around with Lisa so she must at least have an idea where Dean is. "Hester, have you seen Dean?" Cas shouted slightly so his voice could be heard clearly; what Hester did next made him feel sick, she pointed upstairs then began to laugh. "Let's just say that they don't want to be disturbed" she laughed a bit more. Hearing this Cas ran upstairs and heard a noise coming from a room at the end of the hall, which he guessed was Lisa's room, he stood outside for a moment then he heard it, the sound broke his heart, he didn't want to believe it, he couldn't! The moaning, the sound of the mattress springs moving, Lisa moaning Dean's name. Dean was cheating on him. Cas always knew he wasn't good enough for Dean and this just proved it, the fact that he fucked the first girl who offered proved it.
The next morning Dean walked out to the kitchen to get some coffee, he was greeted by Jess and Sam. "Dude, you really had to do it in my house?" Sam was clearly not impressed, he obviously didn't tell Jess what he heard that night as her response caused her to chock on her tea. Dean shrugged, laughing slightly at Jess' reaction "A man has needs". Dean poured himself a coffee and sat down, Lisa walked in shortly after, she looked happy like she had achieved something, Dean decided to ignore it, he was still thinking of Cas. They spent the day going to a bowling ally having a 'double date' this was Jess' and Lisa's idea, Dean agreed to it but it broke his heart, his last double date was when he was dating Cas.
Lucifer offered Dean a cup of coffee and he accepted, Cas told Dean to make himself comfortable, which for some reason made him feel even more awkward. Dean sat on the couch and glanced around the room. There was a huge bookcase which was overflowing with books, 'Cas always loved to read' he thought to himself. Pictures were strategically placed throughout the room, they were mainly pictures of the two of them but a few was of nature. Dean could tell Cas organised the room, the way everything complemented each other, the colour scheme consistent throughout. The way everything matched the description of what Cas told him their house would look like when they bought one. Dean's heart broke a little more, which he didn't think was possible, surely by now his heart was just dust.
"Cas, what happened?" Dean's voice was barely a whisper, his eyes were watering and he felt like he was going to cry any minute. Cas looked back at him, his eyes were dropping slightly, it was clear straight away how drunk he really was. "What's wrong Dean? Never seen a love-bite before" Lucifer's voice echoed around the silent room. Dean looked up and saw this despicable man leaving the house, smirking. The worry he felt instantly changed to fury. He got up to go after him moving a quickly as he could but was stopped by Cas pulling him back. "Leave him alone Dean." Cas' words were slurred but clear, which was remarkable considering the state he was in. Dean looked at Cas bewildered, "as he said, it's a love-bite, there's no reason to get mad". Dean's blood began to boil once again and before he realised, he found himself yelling. "What the fuck is wrong with you Cas? You know that's not a fucking love-bite! He hurt you Cas." Dean felt tears running down his face as he screamed, how could Cas just sit there and not care about what happened.
After the wedding Dean and Lisa went to their room, Lisa wanted to 'celebrate' the night but Dean told her he was too tired, he felt exhausted, the tears and fake smiling really made him feel exhausted. Lisa fell asleep first, Dean was thinking about Ca and this whole messed up situation he was in. He missed Cas, loved him. He couldn't live with Lisa, let alone grow old with her. Before Dean knew it he fell asleep himself.
Dean was on his sofa watching TV when Sam called "Hey Dean, you want to come down this weekend?" "Sure, but can Lisa come, I want her to meet the family" "yeah whatever" Sam didn't sound impressed with that, he told Dean he didn't want to meet Lisa when all this first happened, but it was a few years ago, so he decided to do agree to meeting her through gritted teeth.
"I, Dean take Lisa to be my lawfully wedded wife ..." Dean looked at Cas who was looking at his hands. Dean and Lisa were married two minutes later with Dean kissing her gently and the rest of the room cheering and clapping, Cas was the only one sitting there with no reaction. Dean hadn't spoken to Cas since he saw him after he bought the ring, he wasn't sure Cas was going to come. He went over to say Cas the first moment he got, he wanted to apologise for everything, but something caught his eye when he got there. There was a wedding ring around Cas' finger. "Cas? did you and Balthazar-?" Dean was quickly cut off by Cas "We eloped, we didn't want the whole big ceremony" as he said this he was moving the ring around his finger. "Bullshit! I know you wanted a big wedding, you wanted to have your family and friends there, you talk about it constantly." Dean walked closer to Cas, he was pissed off. "Did Balthazar make you? Cas, this isn't you, you always said-" once again Dean was cut off by Cas "well, I changed my mind, people are allowed to do that Dean." The tone in Cas' voice made it clear he was annoyed, Cas took a deep breath and calmed himself down before going to speak again "Congratulations Dean, the wedding was beautiful." Cas walked away to find Balthazar, he wanted to go home. Dean watched Cas leave again, it felt like that's all he did nowadays, just watch Cas leave.
Cas woke up moments later, trying to get air back into his lungs. Lucifer was still on top of him, but now he was putting his dick back into his trousers. Cas laid his head back, breathing never felt so good. Lucifer removed the ball gag and Cas started to gasp at the air. Lucifer's hands made their way down Cas' torso, Cas could feel nails digging in at his side making him yelp in pain. This only made Lucifer press harder, Lucifer grabbed a handful of Cas' hair once again, he pushed Cas' face to the side exposing Cas' neck. Lucifer then lent down, he kissed Cas' neck before sinking his teeth into the skin. Cas screamed in pain, he felt the blood rolling down his skin onto the white duvet. Lucifer didn't stop, he bit harder making Cas scream even louder. Cas' tears now streaming fast and his cries of pain getting louder he began to beg for Lucifer to stop. Lucifer loosened his teeth and sat back up, his lips stained red from Cas' blood.
Dean first met Castiel when he was walking to class, Castiel had been his usual clumsy self and walked straight into Dean. When Dean turned around he was met with the bluest eyes he had ever seen; that's how the 'perfect' couple had met. It had been a year since Dean finally got the confidence to ask Castiel out, a year since they both realised that they couldn't live without the other in their life.
Cas looked at Dean and smiled slightly, "Dean, I would love to, but I'm moving to Europe, I won't be able to be there for him. I'm sorry." Cas smile disappeared "Sorry" he repeated himself, looking down slightly, he gave a Dean a small nod and headed home. Dean was stuck there, watching Cas leave, unsure of what to say. It felt like Dean was watching Cas leave for hours, but in reality, it was only for a minute, time slowed down when Dean was around Cas. As Dean began to bring himself back a Doctor came out and told Dean that Lisa was awake, Dean went back into Lisa's room and stayed there until Lisa and Ben were released from the hospital.
Lucifer continued thrusting into Cas' mouth, not letting Cas catch his breath. Cas felt his body shaking in fear, he felt the thrusts became stronger and heard Lucifer's moans became louder, Lucifer was close and Cas knew it. He felt a small bit of relief, knowing this all was about to come to an end. When Lucifer finally came he shoved his dick as far back into Cas' throat as he could. He kept one hand one Cas' head making sure it stayed in place. With his other hand he pinched Cas' nose blocking all of Cas' airways. Cas struggled more, trying to breathe. He felt his heart pounding and his lungs begging for oxygen. He felt Lucifer's cum was making it's way down the back of his throat. Even after Lucifer had finished cumming he continued to block Cas' airways. Cas would be crying if he could, instead it was just tears occasionally making their way down his cheeks. After a minute Cas felt himself going weak, black spots appearing in his vision. He looked up at Lucifer's face, seeing the pleasure Lucifer was getting, he was sure, he was sure he was going to die.
The ring Dean got wasn't the most expensive, it wasn't even the nicest looking one he could find, he honestly didn't care about marrying Lisa, he was only doing it so his child could be raised in a traditional family setting. He walked out the shop and started walking to his car, like usually fate was against him. He walked straight into Cas who was walking home from the library. Dean dropped the velvet box which everyone knew had a ring inside, Cas picked it up and handed it to Dean. "That serious huh?" Cas smiled but Dean could clearly tell it was fake, "Yeah, I just ... she's pregnant so I thought I would start the whole 'apple pie' life" Cas smile faded for a second at the word pregnant but quickly came back. Dean saw the pain behind Cas' smile, he wanted to hug him tell him that he was the person he wanted to marry, not Lisa. "Well, congrats" Cas said hugging dean for a brief second, making sure it wasn't longer. "Thanks" Dean said about to put his arms around Cas, but he was too late, Cas pulled away.
Lisa's party was chaotic, over half the people were drunk, the people who were not drunk were high from smoking weed. Dean had no idea why he enjoyed these parties but he always did. Dean had drunk a large amount of alcohol in the short time he'd been there, which was why he was so drunk.
Dean was putting the suitcases in the car. Lisa was still putting on her makeup which was taking forever, so Dean decided that he would start putting the suitcases in the boot of the car. Once he got the last suitcase in the car he turned around to see Cas standing in front of him, he was once again lost to Cas' ocean blue eyes, he couldn't stop staring at them, they made Dean fall in love with Cas even more. "Dean?" Cas looked down knowing that Dean was staring in his eyes. "Sorry Cas, you alright?" Dean put on the best fake smile he could do, why did he mess it up with Cas, why did he ruin the perfection that was their relationship? "Yeah, Balthazar wanted me to drop this over, you left it behind when you moved out" Cas handed Dean his passport and began to walk away
Dean went to find Lisa after he got himself together, Lisa was talking to Charlie, one of Dean's closest friends. He walked over to join the conversation "Hello beautiful" Dean put on a fake smile and wrapped his arm around Lisa's waist kissing her cheek gently. Charlie smiled slightly at Lisa, but when she looked at Dean she gave him a puzzled look, Charlie could always tell when something was on Dean's mind. Lisa walked away once she saw one of her friends Dean couldn't remember the name of. "Okay, what's up?" Charlie asked bluntly "Nothing" Dean replied putting on a fake smile. "Tell me" she demanded and Dean sighed, "I ... I" Dean couldn't get himself to say it, but Charlie knew exactly what he wanted to say. "You don't love her?" Charlie whispered and Dean nodded "then why did you marry her?" Charlie whispered loudly. "She's pregnant, I had to" Charlie rolled her eyes and went to walk away, but before she did she turned to him "you don't have to do anything you don't want to do Dean"
The ambulance arrived shortly later, they rushed Cas into the back and they were finally on their way to the hospital, Dean refused to let go of Cas’ hand, he could feel the slow pulse whilst holding his hand, that was the only thing showing Dean that Cas was still with him.
Dean sat on the steps of the bunker with a bottle of whisky, he was holding Cas’ trench coat, it was the same as it was the day Dean lost Cas. Dean finished the bottle of whiskey in his hand and reached for the one behind him, once that bottle was finished Dean opened his wallet, pulling out a ring, he was going to propose to Cas that night, that's why he was driving that way home, he was going to stop at the barn where they first met.
Cas immediately stood up and started yelling back "Why the fuck do you care Dean? You only care about yourself. Who gave you the right to come to London and make me question my relationship, after what you did to me, after you hurt me more than anyone ever has. Even more than Lucifer!" Cas threw his glass at the wall in anger, when that wasn't satisfying enough he began to punch the wall. Cas felt the pain but didn't stop, he felt his blood slowly coating his knuckles but still continued. Cas didn't stop until Dean grabbed his wrists and restrained him. Cas kept trying to fight against Dean's grip but Dean would let go, he was too afraid that Cas was going to hurt himself even more.
Dean had a whole plan for today, where he was going to take Cas, how he was going to take him to the art gallery somewhere Cas has always enjoyed. He was only taking Cas there for selfish reasons, he just loved the look on Cas' face when he looked at the art it made him fall in love with his angel all over again. That was why he was taking Cas to the art gallery. Dean was sitting in his shared apartment waiting for his roommate Balthazar to come home, Balthazar was the most annoying and loudest person he has ever known, the guy literally screamed at the television when titanic came on, the only reason he was waiting for the nutjob to arrive was he actually needed advice on whether it is a good idea to take Cas to the gallery seeing as he's been so many times before.
Before Dean could answer Lisa spoke again, "That's exactly what I thought! Why else do you think I got pregnan-" Lisa stopped, her eyes widened once she realised what she had admitted. Dean's eyes narrowed in confusion for a moment, then he realised what Lisa just confessed. "You got pregnant on purpose? SO I WOULDN'T LEAVE YOU!" Dean couldn't believe this, what gave her the right to do this, what made her think this was a good idea. Dean shook his head in disbelief, he began to walk away when he heard Lisa yell at him one last time. "Tell me this! If I didn't get pregnant, would you even still be with me!" Dean slammed the door in response, he walked away, he didn't know where to, he just let himself walk. After walking for about an hour he realised he was outside Cas' house, he knocked on the door, he needed to talk to Cas, Cas was always the one that cheered him up no matter what was wrong and so much was wrong right now. The door opened, Cas was standing there in a loose jumper and jeans, his hair was messy and his glasses slightly wonky. Seeing Cas like that made Dean smile, Cas was still the same dork he was when they dated.
Dean began to cry, he missed Cas, he missed his hair, his hands, his smile but most of all those beautiful blue eyes.
Lisa nodded and closed her eyes, she began to fall asleep, she was exhausted after being in labour for so long Dean presumed she'd need a long night's rest. Ben also began to fall asleep on Dean's arm, so Dean placed him in the small cot and walked out the room to get a drink. When he was heading back to the room he saw Cas sitting in the waiting room, Cas stood up once he saw Dean enter. "I came to say congratulations" Cas smiled and handed him a balloon. Dean smiled back "Thanks, Cas". Cas and Dean spoke for hours until Lisa  woke, Dean told Cas that he decided to stay with Lisa, so he could raise Ben the best he could, Cas smiled and told him that it's understandable that Dean wanted to raise Ben that way. When as their conversation ended, Cas stood up and said goodbye. Cas grabbed his coat and was about to leave when Dean stopped him. "Will you be Ben's godfather?" Dean asked nervously
"Well, if he's so stupid he can't see how amazing you then fuck him ... not literally though" Cas laughed slightly, only Gabe would be able to make a joke about this. Gabe smiled at Cas and held him a bit tighter, "come inside, you can stay here tonight, it's too late for you to be driving" Gabe whispered slowly guiding Cas inside, leading Cas to the spare bedroom, getting him a glass of water. "Go to sleep, and we'll talk about his more in the morning" Cas nodded and laid down on the bed, it took him a while to fall asleep, all he could picture was Dean thrusting into Lisa, moaning with her, clearly enjoying himself. When he fell asleep those same images were in his dreams.
"Cas, what Dean did, you can't forgive him, ever. Once a cheater always a cheater" Gabe said whilst moving to sit next to Cas. Cas nodded and lent on Gabe's shoulder. "I know, I never will" Cas whispered.
"Dean" Cas was standing by the door looking at Dean and Lucifer, "maybe it's best if you go" Cas sounded defeated and tired, like he was ready to give up on everything. Dean moved away from Lucifer and instantly went to Cas pulling him aside so they could talk without Lucifer listening. "Cas please, he hurt you, please just come with me please." Cas looked at Dean, saw the desperation in his eyes, the worry. "No Dean, I'm staying here" Cas moved away from Dean and went to Lucifer, kissing him gently on the cheek. Dean couldn't move, he couldn't believe what he had heard, Cas wanted to stay with this monster.
Dean grabbed Cas’ hand squeezing it slightly, he felt Cas squeeze back, causing his to once again let out a breath of relief.
"Cas, wait please" Cas stopped in his tracks and turned to face Dean. "I still love you and I know you still love me ... just stay, we can start again, please" Dean was begging, his voice was cracking and tears were forming in his eyes, he couldn't believe he was actually saying this, he always thought of saying it but never did, he was always scared what Cas' response would be. "You're wrong" Cas whispered turning to walk away, his worst nightmare had come true, Cas didn't love him anymore. What Dean didn't know was saying those words broke Cas' heart, because they were far from the truth, he loved Dean, wanted to be with Dean but knew he couldn't be with Dean again, not after how badly Dean hurt him.
Dean nodded so Cas gave him his car keys, Lucifer was going to give Cas a lift home and Dean was going to drive Cas' car back. Cas gave him the postcode so Dean could use the satnav to get back to Cas' house without any issues. Cas was then led into Lucifer's car and it sped off down the road. Dean walked around, taking in the different buildings, he found himself walking on a bridge over the river Thames, he watched the calmness of the water and compared it to the chaos of the streets. He found it truly beautiful and the beauty took his mind away from the anger he felt at dinner. Dean walked around longer than he expected, he ended up getting back to Cas' two hours later. He heard snoring from upstairs, so he quietly made his way into the spare bedroom and laid in bed. He knew he needed to speak to Cas tomorrow, needed to speak to him without that dickhead around. He began to imagine the ways he could show Cas what he deserves, how he should be treated. Dean fell asleep to the idea that he can show Cas what happiness truly is. The love he deserves.
Dean shook his head, “No, I’m fine” tears once again formed in his eyes “I’m sorry, I should have been looking at the road, this is- this is all my fault”
When the phone call was over Dean went to pack and tell Lisa that they were going down to Sam's. Truthfully Dean just wanted to get away from his emotions, especially as it was now, tomorrow would've been his and Cas' anniversary, it would've been their fourth anniversary. It was also the day that marked when he fucked everything up three years ago.
Dean was useless at noticing flirting, the only time he would realised he was being hit on is when Cas got slightly jealous and if  that happened Dean would assure him that Cas was the only person he would ever love or have feelings for. "Sounds fun" Dean smiled and nodded "I'll be there" Dean then walked into his class not really noticing what was wrong with what just happened.
Dean was waiting to see what Cas would say next he wasn’t sure if Cas would just tell him to call him later or whether he might just hang up. Then he heard the words he didn’t expect “I’ll be there in an hour, wait for me in the Coffee shop, I’ll call you when I’m outside”. A smile appeared instantly on Dean’s face, not only was Cas on his way to pick him up but he didn’t sound annoyed at Dean. Just as Dean was about to thank him he heard 11 words that broke him.
"I hope you have a good life Dean" Cas began to walk away when he was stopped by Dean grabbing his arm, not wanting him to leave again. "I don't love her, I never did" Dean whispers and looks up at Cas "I've only ever loved you" Dean looked at Cas' chapped lips, wanting more than ever to kiss them. "Dean... don't" Cas took a deep breath and pulled his arm from Dean's grip and started to walk away again. He stopped and turned around to face Dean. "Remember when we used to talk about adopting a child when we get older?  You said you always wanted a son named Ben, remember?" Dean nodded unsure where this was going. "If it's a boy, name him Ben, it's a nice name" Cas smiled and walked away.
“Keep fighting Bluebird, we are nearly there” Dean whispered rubbing circles with his thumb on Cas’ hand.
Dean quickly threw on his pants and began to run after Cas, he felt terrible. Cas had warned him not to come, Cas told him what would happen but Dean didn't listen. Dean ran out the front door just in time to see Cas driving down the road at full speed, Dean fell to his knees with his face in his hands and began to cry, why was he so stupid? He loves Cas with all his heart, he would do anything for Cas. He knew he made the biggest mistake, knew Cas wouldn't be able to forgive him, knew Cas hated him.
Dean looked at Cas, who seemed nervous, Dean wasn't sure why he would be nervous about this, Dean was trying his best to be polite, trying his best not to say anything that would bring any tension to the table. Dean turned to face Cas and smiled "Sorry Cas, I never asked, what are you doing in England? Have you become a doctor like you wanted?" Dean saw a sad look in Cas' eye, like he'd given up on his dream, which didn't make sense to Dean, all Cas talked about was how he was going to heal as many people as possible. Before Cas could answer Lucifer opened his mouth and decided to speak for him, "we decided that there was no need for Cas to work, I earn enough money for the both of us." Lucifer leaned closer to Dean so no one but him could hear and whispered "Plus, it means he's constantly waiting for me to come home and fuck him like the desperate bitch he is." Lucifer winked at Dean, like Dean was supposed to agree. Dean felt sick, angry and hurt. How could someone say that about Cas, treat Cas like a piece of meat not a human being. Dean felt like he was about to throw punches, he was about to lift his arm up when he felt a hand on his knee. He looked at the hand and saw it was Cas', he calmed down instantly he went to hold the hand, to check if Cas was okay, surely Cas heard what Lucifer said, and surely that hurt him.
When Dean returned home to Lisa he instantly asked Lisa to marry him, she said yes as quickly as she could. She began to plan everything instantly and all Dean could think about was the broken look on Cas' face when he picked up the ring, Cas' face when he found out Lisa was pregnant. Him telling Dean to use the name Ben, Dean knew how much that must have hurt to say, it was a name they decided together and now it was going to be used for Dean and Lisa. Dean began to contemplate whether or not he should tell Lisa the truth, he knew that he had to marry her either way so he didn't see a point, so he was stuck with his stupid plan of marrying Lisa and wishing it was Cas. Dean and Lisa's wedding two months later, it was rushed but everyone kept saying it was a 'perfect' wedding.  Everyone but Dean, for Dean it wasn't, the one person he wanted to marry was at the back of the church.
Dean leaves the bathroom and heads back to the couch, Cas is still watching the news, seeing if there is any reports that he found interesting. Dean sat down and drank his drink, making sure he doesn't spill any on the clean white sofa. They sat in silence for a few minutes, then Cas turned to Dean "you must be exhausted, there's a spare bedroom, why don't you go to bed?" Dean didn't want to leave Cas' side now he was so close, but he couldn't deny that he was shattered, he needed to rest. Dean nodded and Cas showed him to the spare room, showed Dean where the upstairs bathroom was and gave him a towel so he could shower. Cas then went back downstairs, Dean laid on the bed and fell asleep instantly.
It's been three months since the wedding, Dean and Lisa have found out that they're having a boy. Dean decided to use the name Ben, whenever he hears it it makes him smile,let's him remember how he chose the name. Ben was due any day now, Lisa was getting easily annoyed by small things Dean would do, something like leaving the TV on while going to the shop always result in her screaming at Dean. It got to the point Dean couldn't stand it anymore, the constant yelling the hatred, this wasn't a good place to environment to raise a baby in. "Lisa, we need to talk, we can't raise a baby like this, the arguments. It's not healthy." Dean knew by Lisa's reaction that the conversation about having less arguments was going to lead to another argument. "Dean, if for once you just listen to what I say instead of spending the whole time in a world of your own maybe I wouldn't have to shout!" Dean sighed and walked away, he realised walking away was the easiest way of preventing an argument, that's when he heard Lisa yell after him. "How about you just go back to Cas! We both know that's what you've been thinking about since our fucking wedding!" Dean turned around and faced Lisa "What are you even talking about!" Dean didn't even believe the words, how was Lisa supposed to. "I'm talking about you and him, we both know you still love him!" Dean paused for a second, he wanted to say no he didn't, but he couldn't because they both knew Lisa was telling the truth.
Tell me your opinions and let me know if there is any ideas you have. I'd be glad to hear them - Many Thanks, Clare
"What brings you here Dean?" Cas says with a slight serious tone in his voice. "I needed a break away from everyone, a lot has been going on, and I thought- well I hoped, it'd be okay for to me come see you" Dean wasn't ready to tell Cas the real reason he was here, not after what he heard on the phone. If Cas was happy, who is he to come and try and ruin that. Cas put Dean's bag in the bag and walked over to the drivers side to get in, opening the door for Dean as he did so. Just before Cas was about to get into the car Dean stopped him "Castiel, I have missed you, not in a romantic way, just a friend way- not that I don't miss you in a- no I don't mean- I just" Dean couldn't stop speaking, maybe it was the nerves, maybe it was the lack of sleep but he just couldn't get his lips to stop moving; when he finally did he saw Cas smiling at him. "I've missed you too, now get in the car Assbutt"
Dean woke up eight hours later, it was the longest he's slept in years, he went into the bathroom and had a quick shower. He put on some clean clothes and went downstairs. When he got down he noticed Cas wasn't around, he saw a note on the coffee table with his name on. ' Dean, I've had to go out to pick up some groceries, I didn't want to wake you so I thought I'd leave you alone to sleep. I'll be back soon, there's some food in the fridge, feel free to make yourself something. Lucifer called and said he's books all of us a table at a restaurant for 5, hope you don't mind. Cas'. Dean check his watch, it was 3pm, he had two hours to prepare himself for dinner.
The first year with Ben was the best year of Dean's life, Ben had green eyes like Dean's, but definitely had Lisa's facial features. Somehow, his hair- his hair was just like Cas'. Dean loved Ben, but having Ben's hair look like Cas' was just hurting, the ebony black colour and the neat mess was breaking Dean's heart, reminding him of his one true love.. Lisa was trying her best to ignore the pain in Dean's eyes but she could tell he missed Cas so much. It was Dean's birthday when Lisa gave him an amazing surprise, he opened his card and out fell a ticket to go to England. The last time Dean had spoken to Cas he said how he was living in England. Dean looked at the ticket wide-eyed and his eyes began to water. "Dean, we said we'll stay together for Ben, but I believe that we'll be better as friends for Ben, we will argue less and he won't grow up around whatever this is and think it's love, if he see's you with Cas, he will at least know what truth love is like." Dean pulled Lisa into a tight hug, he couldn't believe what he was hearing, Lisa was allowing him to go after Cas, allowing him to be with the man he loved.
The picture Dean saw in front of him would be forever haunting. The room smelt of sweat and cum, the air felt thick to breathe, Dean wasn’t sure if it was his own breath being taken away from him or just the unsettling humidity in the air. Cas’ face was in a pillow, acting brave, but his shoulders were moving making it obvious that he was crying. Bright pink marks covered the entirety of his back, there was a clear imprint of a buckle between Cas’ still shaking shoulder bone. Dean couldn’t stop the gasp leaving his lips. He wanted to move closer to Cas, to undo the restraints and help him, but Dean couldn’t move. The shock of seeing Cas like this, knowing he wasn’t there to help Cas, to look after him prevented Dean from moving. He felt like his thoughts were going a thousand miles per hour, all he could do was stand and look at Cas.
“Remember how we met?” Dean whispered kissing Cas’ hand once again, Cas nodded with a larger smile on his face “Of course … of course I do- I will never forget it” he whispered in reply. Dean motioned for Cas to tell him the story of how they met and Cas began to do so.
Cas’ hand dropped from Dean’s face creating the illusion of death, Dean felt his heart stop. “Cas?… no, come on please!”
It had been one month since Dean cheated on Cas, one month since Dean's life began to fall to shit. Sam hardly spoke to Dean, which is understandable, Cas ignored him whenever Dean tried to say hello, Dean could tell Cas was trying to avoid him, which was slowly killing Dean. Dean opened the door of his apartment and walked in on something he wished he never saw. Cas and Balthazar sitting on the couch kissing each other, Cas holding Balthazar the way he used to hold Dean. Dean slammed the door shut trying to get their attention and trying to get them to stop. Both Cas and Balthazar looked in the direction of the sound when Cas saw Dean he rolled his eyes and kissed Balthazar again. In annoyance and pain, Dean walked to his room with tears in his eyes, this was his fault. Cas is now dating his fucking roommate because of him, because he let him go. When Dean got to his room he punched his wall, threw all his pictures on the floor watching them shatter as they hit the floor. He didn't want to believe that Cas was actually dating Balthazar now. Well if Cas wanted to date someone else Dean could do the same, he quickly called up Lisa and when she arrived Dean lead her to his room.
Cas quickly grew tired and stopped fighting against Dean. Although Cas had stopped Dean was still holding Cas' wrists, but neither of them noticed, they were too distracted by the feeling of each others breath against their lips. They hadn't been this close since they broke up, since Dean ruined everything. Dean began to pull away, not that he wanted to, he'd love to stay this close to Cas forever, but he knew it was the right thing to do. He was stopped suddenly by Cas' lips on his, he pulled Cas closer, wrapping his arms around Cas' waist, trying to get as close as possible. Cas moved his hands under Dean's top, feeling Dean's skin made him hard almost instantly. Dean could feel Cas' erection against him, Dean responded in the same way, their erections were rubbing against each other. It felt like heaven.
Dean stood up and walked out of the bunker, he walked for an hour before he reached the barn, Dean refused to drive since the accident, he didn’t want to be reminded of that tragic day, but it never worked, every little thing reminded him of Cas.
When Cas turned the corner he fell to the ground crying, he had lost Dean forever. There was no way Dean and him could ever get together now, he should have forgiven Dean sooner, he shouldn't have got together with Balthazar. He should have told Dean how he felt, how he still feels. Cas was knelt down crying in his hands for a good ten minutes before he was able to stand up and walk home. When he got home he sat on the couch trying not to cry, he didn't even notice Balthazar enter the room. "Hey beautiful" Balthazar kissed Cas waking him up from his daydream. Cas kissed back slightly, Balthazar then straddled Cas and started to kiss his neck. "Not tonight Balthazar" Cas whispered moving his neck away from the kisses but Balthazar kept pulling Cas' neck back.
Dean knew that Cas was running out of time, he needed to tell his angel everything before it was too late!
Over the next few years Cas continued to date Balthazar and Dean continued to date Lisa. Dean and Cas were beginning to get on speaking terms again and although they both loved each other Cas didn't want to risk Dean cheating on him again, risk having Dean break his heart again, so he decided he wouldn't be stupid and act on his feelings. Dean moved in with Lisa and Cas moved in with Balthazar. Dean didn't have feelings for Lisa, he just wanted to show Cas that he was moving on even though the truth was he wasn't. He had spent countless nights trying to figure out a way to show Cas how sorry he was, try to show Cas how he was better than Balthazar. Sam had been to visit Dean a few times in the years, he slowly began to forgive Dean, he knew how much Dean regretted hurting Cas, that Dean would do anything to change what he did.
"If you misbehave, struggle, or try anything I deem inadequate, I will hurt you. The choice is yours Castiel, accept this is your life now or face unimaginable pain." Cas tried to stop himself crying, he nodded at Lucifer replying with a broken voice "I'll behave, I promise I'll behave". Lucifer got off Cas and headed for the door. Cas closed his eyes and begged for Dean to come back, begged for him to realised something was wrong and that Cas needed his help.
"Uhm ..." Cas started, "Well I can try to. I'll have to check with Claire's babysitter. Charlie said to talk to you about the hours."
I haven't written a multiple-chapter fic in literal years, but there was sudden inspiration over Christmas break that resulted in this. The first drafts of all chapters are written already, so you won't have to worry about this never getting finished.
"My daughter," he said. "You do everything you can to make sure this doesn't affect her. I don't want her face on any tabloid magazines. I don't want her name anywhere. I don't want her involved in this in any way."
"Don't worry too much, though," Dean said. "I think you did good. And they shouldn't have seen much from you either"
As soon as Charlie and Dean returned that afternoon, she sat down to check the overall reception, and after getting a quick overview she happily announced to everyone in the room that the fans seemed to have an absolute blast over it.
"What, you just offer me a job in the music industry? Me? A teacher with no qualifications whatsoever?"
After some more chatting in the hallway, Dean led Cas into the bigger office and introduced him to Garth, the team's so far only lyricist and another friend of Dean's. Dean did a little introduction, explaining to Garth who Cas was and what he was gonna do, and after that he excused himself saying he'd have to do some of his own work and he left Cas with his brand-new colleague.
I was still only staring at him. The sudden realisation must have been obvious on my face, since his expression suddenly got softer.
Now, Missouri stepped into the hallway, and as soon as her eyes met Cas's, his smile faded. She didn't say anything, but Cas put Claire down after a quick kiss on her little head and told her to go play some more because he had to talk about something with Missouri. Claire happily ran back off into another room, and without a word spoken, Cas followed Missouri into the kitchen.
Then later, they watched Lexie on stage give a quick speech, and after that, it was Dean's turn. Cas was left off to the side, suddenly very alone and a lot more insecure than he had been before on Dean's arm. A few words into Dean's talk, Cas noticed Lexie appearing next to him and giving him a friendly cheer-up smile.
Dean still thought that way about himself, and Cas made sure to tell him often enough that he didn't agree with that, that he thought Dean was amazing, that he loved him, and Claire loved him, and a lot of other people loved him, and that the only person who thought about Dean that way was Dean himself.
"Great," Charlie said, "both of you here, only one explanation necessary. No actually, no explanation needed at all."
So yes, a lot of negative things had come with the attention, and Cas's life had definitely changed ever since he had met Dean. But he loved Dean nevertheless, and he wanted to be with him despite all the rumours and the spotlight.
"No," Cas chuckled, "Not government. As if any top-secret government position would employ a freshly fired teacher"
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean asked, pretending to be offended but not being able to hold back a chuckle of his own.
"... anyway, two people for sure know you'll be there, and I know one of them is very serious about anonymous tips concerning you. So there really should be someone having an eye out for you. You just get an outside table where you can be seen, and get to your acting. If anything goes wrong, call me, and-"
Yes, Dean was a good-looking man, and that made it so incomprehensible to me that he would find me attractive in any way. He was Dean Winchester, after all. And I was just, well, me. Nothing but a nerdy English teacher with a weakness for Shakespeare. I didn’t like my jawline and my nose, I wasn’t happy with the way my hair grew and the shape of my eyebrows, and I couldn’t understand, not for the love of God, why on earth someone like Dean Winchester would even look at me.
The days went by, the album sold well and so did the concert tickets. In the following days, almost all the shows sold out, and the ones that didn't only had very little numbers of tickets left, and those numbers still went down constantly.
And he really didn't know. He continued thinking about that question for a bit longer after dropping his daughter off at school. During his quiet drive to work, he kept thinking. Were they ready? Was
“Yeah, I think I am,” Dean replied. “It’s not that much different from my work with the sports club back home. But I don’t know if I’m made to be a teacher”
“Both,” I said quietly. “You didn’t make me uncomfortable just now, neither did you yesterday. That’s not the issue”
Cas took the card and eyed it for a second, twisted it in between his fingers, then glanced up to meet Dean's eyes again.
"I know that," Dean breathed. Cas felt like he was still looking at him, but he just couldn't turn back to him. He couldn't look at Dean right now, not yet. "I understand that, I really do," Dean now added more confidently. "And I also understand that your daughter got sick and you had to be there. Of course you had to. I just wish that you ... just for a couple seconds, Cas. That you would've talked to me. That you would've just told me ... I don't know, just something. Because you've been radio silent ever since you left that night, and I ..." Dean stopped and swallowed, "The impression I'm getting from that is that I was nothing but a convenient fuck for you"
Cas and Claire usually didn't join the soundchecks anymore after the second one and they instead made good use of their time by doing some sightseeing in the area around the hotel. There mostly weren't that exciting things to see, but Claire was more than happy when she spotted a playground or just any monument that allowed climbing, and they occasionally also found some interesting things like an indoor garden or a few museums that both father and daughter found interesting.
He felt Dean leaning in a bit, leaning closer over the notebook and taking a peek into it, reading the last few words.
"Yeah. Things I can and probably will ask from you. First off, close physical contact such as hugging, having one arm around you, stuff like that." He looked up from the paper and over to Cas. "I'm reading all that to you. If there's something you don't agree with or want defined more closely, please interrupt"
"Kinda, yeah," she said. "But I think ... Well, look at the reaction you're getting. It's all positive. People are so excited about the news, and of course they're curious about who you are, but not in a bad way. Dean is incredibly popular right now, and so are you. Even though they don't even know your name. It's not, like, a bad kind of fame"
Cas couldn't help gasping at the sudden grip of Dean's hand around him. With a grin up at Cas, the man on his knees gave him some quick strokes before he took him in his mouth without a warning.
"Claire, first of all," he said. "I won't go anywhere without her for that long, absolutely not. And Dean said it's not a problem, he said she can come and we'd figure it out, but I ... I don't know if that's the right thing to do with a kid her age. I mean yeah maybe I can bring her to a show or two, but certainly not all of them, and all the travelling and hopping from one place to another and so many people and ... I don't know, Jo"
"Because I'm gay," he answered quietly and swallowed down the wave of emotion that built up in his throat every time the topic came up.
They spent a couple more minutes convincing Ed and Harry that they really weren't being made fun of and that really was what was going on. That conversation ended with the two of them accepting what they were being told, but also deciding that they would have a talk with Charlie later just to be sure.
"Yeah," Dean smiled. "I got you, okay? I'm there all the time, and they're gonna focus on me, not you. So even if you get stuck at some point, I'm there and I got you. It's gonna be fine"
Truth was, I was rather happy about that certain distance. It made hiding easier. Maybe it was kind of lonely that way, but on a positive note, I never was close enough with anyone to have to face questions about love, about women. Things you talk about with your close in age friends. Yes, maybe I was kind of lonely, but at least there never was the risk of anyone finding out about my sexuality.
Dean stood up and offered me his hand that I gladly took. I turned on the radio on the shelf, and we danced through the room according to Dean’s lead. It was by far not perfect, I stepped on his feet a few times, and one time we even fully bumped into each other because of a miscoordination in which direction to go.
Before Cas pushed open the final door to the area where everyone was, he turned to Jo with a grin and asked "Ready?".
"Yes," Dean said hesitantly. "I, uhm ... I mean I'm hella insecure about it just as well. But it's not a bad plan"
"Yeah," Dean shrugged. "I mean, if it was my ice cream, I'd be pissed as well" He made a short pause, then added: "We can get one for Daddy as well, if you want to"
"We're aware that this isn't a regular job and that it cuts deep into your personal life," he said. "I know we're asking a lot of you, and I'm really glad you agreed nevertheless. So, we're of course gonna appreciate your input financially"
Well, he technically could have stayed with me, sure. But we both agreed that the risk of somebody seeing him come out of my apartment the next morning was way too big. If one of our colleagues had seen him coming out my door in the afternoon or late evening we could have explained it. It could have just been two good friends hanging out at one’s place together. But leaving my place early in the morning in his clothes from the day before, when his own apartment was only a flight of stairs away … that would have been a lot harder to explain away.
"There's nothing wrong," Cas said. He wasn't sure if Dean was convinced by that lie. Given the situation of him obviously freaking out in the bathroom right now, probably not. "I was just overwhelmed. No big deal. But thank you for worrying"
the song, you know? You should check him out on YouTube, honestly just get the feeling first hand. But a little advice," she smirked, "watch a live performance"
a teacher. Currently unemployed. It's kind of a long story. Anyways, I ... yeah, I think I'm passionate about teaching. Sharing knowledge, shaping young people's thinking, you know? And most passionate about my daughter. Cos I'm teaching her, every day. 24/7. Scarily close to 24/7, because we really don't like sleeping currently, right love?"
That thought stayed with me for the rest of the day, throughout all my remaining classes. I kept thinking about Dean, the unique beauty that he was, and Shakespeare’s words. About the person that Shakespeare had had in mind when writing this Sonnet, that person that historians didn’t know who it was. It was incredible, I thought, nobody knew who it was Shakespeare had described, and yet he had reached the goal he had declared in the poem. This person’s beauty was living on in the poem, forever, even hundreds of years after their death.
As soon as Claire had let go of Jo, they finally entered the building, and with Cas's approval, Jo led Claire into the kitchen, declaring that she had a little surprise for her.
"Yeah, uhm ..." Dean grabbed Cas's hand and pulled him a couple steps towards the other two. Cas let him, still an embarrassed flush on his cheeks.
All of a sudden, their exciting exploration of the other one's mouth and body got interrupted by the noise of a phone being dropped on asphalt, directly followed by a loud "Shit!"
dating, he had only realized how hard it was to go on a date without being seen. Before, they had always wanted to be seen. And now that they didn't want to, cameras seemed to be around every corner.
Another couple minutes later, Claire was dried off and fully dressed again on the couch where Cas had told her not to move away from while her dirty clothes were soaking in the bathroom sink and Cas was mopping up the paint on the living room floor.
Even though I knew the poem, and I had worked with it and its interpretation a dozen times before, I
"Real, yeah," Dean smirked, "but I'd say, definitely overshadowed by the unclarity about the other one's intentions"
Then, finally, a couple hours later, they were back in Dean's car. As soon as both doors had closed, an awkward silence fell over them. Inside, them not talking hadn't been so strikingly quiet, since there had been lots of other noise around, but now, in the quiet privacy of the car, it became almost crushing.
And then, those three lines, it was almost ridiculous to Cas, because he thought that if someone in their relationship could wonder about how the other possibly one chose them, it would be him. Because after all, Dean was the international pop star, Dean was the rich guy that could have anyone he wanted, and Cas had been the unemployed single father. It had been years by now, but Cas still wondered. He wondered what Dean saw in him, he wondered how it was possible that Dean had chosen this life with him, and he wondered the most about how on earth it was possible that Dean was as perfect and mindblowingly amazing as he was and he still thought he wasn't good enough for Cas.
No more words were spoken after that. It was just the two of them, breathing, just being, Cas holding Dean, for he didn't know how long.
The next morning at work, Cas was alone in the office again. Garth seemed to be working from home again and Charlie was over at Jo's office as they were going through some documents together.
The weekend went by really fast. Cas spent a lot of time with Claire. He had been away a lot over the course of the week, so it was only fair to dedicate Saturday and Sunday to his daughter.
If anyone would have told me that back in October, I wouldn’t have believed a word of it. And yet, here I was, holding Dean’s hand while on a romantic walk around the snow-covered fields after kissing him for the very first time.
"It's turned off," he explained to her, "look. This button turns on the sounds. Do you wanna press it with me?"
I didn’t even know where all that sudden confidence came from. All I knew was, I had enjoyed every second of being that close to him, I wanted him, and I felt safe with him. I was nervous, of course I was, but I trusted him, and I knew it would be magical, simply because it was with him.
"We don't do emergency tickets," Dean chuckled. "But we can still handle that. The one with the confidentiality agreement, didn't you say she's your best friend?"
The next week was focused on solely work on the album as they had to meet deadlines, and even though it seemed to Cas as if there was a lot of time left until the release date, he was told that they were in fact running on a tight schedule, and with the others being the experts, he believed them.
"Obviously not," Cas chuckled. "The way she falls asleep backstage, just like that? I would've never imagined that. At home it's a real struggle to get her to sleep"
That hit, and for a second, nothing happened. There was the intense staring between them, and the rising excitement in Cas's entire body, nothing for a second before everything happened incredibly fast.
"I know," Dean replied softly. "And I'm gonna keep that promise. We're taking care of that, right Charlie? Right?"
Cas wasn't exactly sure what this was. What was happening right now, or what it meant. Or if it was a good idea. Probably not, that much he could tell even with his mind being foggy like that.
None of us said a word for a while, we were just walking, nothing to be heard but the snow crunching under our boots. We got further and further away from the school, were now climbing up a little hill. On top of it, we rested for a moment, enjoying the view we had over the currently snow-covered roofs of the houses down in the village.
“No,” I said and couldn’t hold back a hint of a smile. “He won’t make us break up. It’s okay, Dean. He’ll keep our secret, as long as we do as well”
"Fuck that's hot," Dean panted exactly what Cas had thought as well, though Cas had had that thought about Dean's shamelessly turned-on expression, whereas Dean was probably referring to Cas taking over control.
"Okay," Dean replied. He kept the eye contact with Cas, and mirrored his smile. None of the two looked away, and none of them said anything.
"Yeah," Dean chuckled, "Yeah, she knew. I asked her, actually. You know, if she'd be okay with it, if she wants me as her stepdad"
It was fascinating to him. Claire liked Dean so much, and she had such great fun playing around and making music with him, and despite all of that she didn’t have the slightest idea of who he was. She didn't have a clue that probably thousands of people worldwide would give a lot to be in her position. She spent time with international pop star Dean Winchester at his personal studio, but to her he was just the funny ice cream man who let her pluck on his guitar.
Charlie called him over to show him the final album cover that now had been confirmed with Dean as well.
Claire was on an absolute high after that day at the theme park, and she rode on it for multiple days afterwards. Then, another couple of days later, she had found yet another new passion.
Just like Dean. He really seemed to have made quite the impression on her, Cas thought. And to be fair, Dean had done the same thing to him.
"Mh, you know," she smirked, "the vibes are different. Better. But also, he's really good looking. And he's even hotter when he's working his guitar."
He felt Dean's body relaxing, he heard Dean's breath become calmer, more quiet. With his hand on Dean's naked chest, Cas could feel his constant heartbeat.
"Mh," Jo made. "Okay first of all, I sign a confidentiality agreement, and you don't even tell me there's gonna be a tour? Because I keep up with Dean's social media and I'm very sure there hasn't been a tour announcement so far"
Again, Cas gripped the rubber band tighter. Dean knows what he's doing, he told himself. He knows what he's doing. And Dean did.
What Cas knew, though, was that there had been multiple articles covering the topic of the event in general, and of course most of them had snuck in the picture of Dean kissing Cas's cheek. There also were some tabloid headlines focusing mostly on that photo and speculating if Dean would make that mysterious relationship official anytime soon since he had brought that nameless man to an official event with him and had allowed photos to be taken.
Cas nodded quietly. He wasn't sure how to feel about that. He had expected some attention, some press coverage, but what he hadn't expected was being the reason for a number 1 twitter trend. He had fought the urge to check social media for Dean's name last night, even though he had been curious. He had been just as nervous as curious, though, so he had decided to let Dean fill him in on how well it had worked. And turned out, it had worked
"Mh," Dean made, "Yeah. We can discuss that. We're a family-friendly company, always trying to accommodate parent's schedules," he smirked. "We can figure something out. It would be great if you could make it tomorrow, though. To talk through stuff, you know."
"Yeah," Dean chuckled. He turned his full body over to Cas, shifting Cas with him so that they were now standing face to face, really close. Their bodies weren't touching, Dean had made sure of that, but they weren’t far away from it. "We've been working on it for a while, but recording hasn't really started yet. Song-writing took a lot of time. More than expected"
The photos from the shooting came in, as did the drafts for the album cover. Charlie even called Cas over to her desk at some point and asked him for his opinion. Dean hadn't even seen any of the drafts yet when Cas told Dean he liked the one with Dean's profile on the right side the best. The background of this one was a soft, light shade of pink, Dean's face was kept in different shades of grey, and the placeholder "Title" was displayed in white letters on the left side, vertically going down the side.
"Mr. Winchester!" She said with the most intense talking-to-a-customer-smile Cas had ever seen, "Welcome back! We didn't expect you until tomorrow, though"
The man watched Cas pulling out a band-aid - yellow with tiny bees on it - and carefully placing it on his daughter's knee. The girl's eyes followed her father's hands as well, and she even smiled a bit as he had placed it.
Dean pulled slightly back. He brought his face back to mine for just long enough for me to see his grin. Then he pressed another hot kiss on my lips and was right back at my ear to whisper just one word into it.
He soon got stuck in this train of thought, though, because after deciding that Dean definitely held some sort of trust for Cas and they had become rather familiar with each other, Cas admitted that it simply wouldn't make sense if Dean was just aiming for a sexual relationship.
Dean chuckled. "Yeah, well, it comes with the job. Can't really avoid that. The sunglasses help a big lot, surprisingly. But you can't avoid people recognizing you"
Cas spent some more time talking to Sam that night, about him and Dean, about Claire, but also about other things. They talked about themselves for a bit, he learned a detail or two about Sam's life in California and his lawyer job, and he told him some things about his own life, his former job as a teacher.
"Do you regret your decision?" He asked across the table right after they had ordered and were now waiting for their meals.
"Bullshit, Cas," Dean said calmly. "When we first met, you had stopped already. You told me you were unemployed. You quit teaching before you met me"
"It's ... well it's a positive comment this time. But it made me wonder ... well it basically said that it shouldn't take you publicly kissing a man for people to believe you're really bisexual."
"Oh," Cas made. Was that a good thing? Or a bad one? He really couldn't tell. Because on the one hand, he was really glad there was no visual proof of him and Dean making out that night, but on the other hand, it definitely would have gotten attention. "Maybe they just ... you know, decided to respect our privacy?"
“Mh,” Dean made, “You’re not celebrating? I thought you would, because of your religious background and all that?”
She was insecure about the lyrics of the verses, so Dean sang those for her, and the girl excitedly joined in for the chorus. Claire had so much fun doing that that Dean went right into a second time after he had finished the song.
He greeted Cas with a charming smile which Cas immediately returned, but then Cas didn't really bother any further and turned back to his work while Dean quietly talked to Charlie.
Claire indeed stopped crying abruptly and instead stared up at the stranger with widened eyes. Cas observed with a chuckle how she stared at him in total silence for a moment and then robbed back to hold onto Cas's leg and hide her face from him.
"Yeah, I see," Cas smiled. He didn't say it out loud, but in his mind, he wondered if that would be the case for him as well. If he would still be here in maybe five years' time, able to call Dean his friend?
Generally, after meeting Dean’s colleagues and friends and talking more with him today, Cas felt like he hadn't made a bad decision when agreeing to the offer. Dean made an honest impression to him so far, and he seemed nice, correct, reasonable. He definitely wasn't one of those cliché rich assholes who expect everyone to do whatever they want, and while Cas of course hadn't really seen Dean in a work environment so far, he was rather sure it couldn't be so bad with everything he knew.
Claire didn't see that picture and didn't get to ask questions Cas wouldn't have known how to answer, but the weird feeling of people recognizing him stayed.
"Cas?" He heard Jo's voice from the other side. He sighed. Better Jo than Dean, no doubt of that, but he was still concerned about how much exactly she knew about the last night.
Now, they were lying there in bed, Cas on is back, Dean on his side next to him, leaning on his elbow, smiling at Cas.
"Oh really?" Cas now joined his laughter. "That doesn't quite go with the theme of track number 4 on your brand-new album"
With every hour passing at work that morning, Cas became gradually more nervous. He started nervously tapping his pen onto the desk as he was working through some lyrics, and Charlie tolerated it for a surprisingly long time before she snapped.
Feeling Dean next to him as his alarm rude awakened him, Cas immediately felt a lot better than the previous morning. He just loved waking up next to Dean. He loved feeling his warm body next to him, he loved hearing Dean's little groans and mumbled complaints because his boyfriend was a grumpy mess in the morning, he even loved having Dean's arm in his face from Dean's extensive movements in his sleep. It was annoying, sure. But it also was Dean, and it meant Dean was there.
"Not freak out about it?" She laughed out ironically. "Cas do you have only the slightest idea about how insane this sounds?"
"There's always haters," Jo said calmly, "but they're always there, even if you're just an average person minding your own business. And that's just boring old homophobia. Nothing new, and certainly not suddenly caused by you kissing Dean"
As exciting the waiting for break was, and as much as I loved my job there, I eventually got tired of not being physically close to him. A thing that long-distance relationships unfortunately bring. We made it to two more school years until I finally quit my job to be near him.
“It’s not that far from the dining hall,” I chuckled, “That should be alright. There’s food involved, after all.”
They made multiple pauses of just a couple of minutes, which Dean really seemed to need, and Cas understood that. He wouldn't have wanted to be the one standing there being flashed bright lights at the entire day.
“Yeah, right,” he then started. “Well, as I said, I’m from Kansas. I used to work in the family business”
"What hurts, love?" He asked softly. He now saw Claire, sitting there with her back against the headboard, hugging one of the pillows. Her face looked like she had been crying.
"Exactly that," Dean smiled. "You're really just there to be seen around me. We're keeping it very professional, because if this wasn't pretend, I wouldn't bring anyone to work and get all touchy either. It's like, you're watching, but we're taking the work serious nevertheless."
"He is," Cas smirked, "but I'm only admitting that because you're legally not allowed to tell anyone about this conversation"
"Okay," Cas made. That didn't sound so bad. He'd basically get a free backstage pass to all the shows, and he'd get to do an interesting trip for the price of some hand holding with Dean. But there was something else. "I got a 4-year-old daughter, Dean"
When he arrived at her house that night, he swallowed his anxiety down and took a deep breath before he rang the bell.
"Oh," Garth said as if he only remembered that right now, "yeah, that was the state of play when you left for your break. Dean gave me one more to review like the last second before deadline. I said he's literally insane for doing that, but he insisted"
Cas leaned in to take a closer look at it. Dean had cut out cookies in three different forms. It was multiple sets of two figures – an Angel and a human figure – with some heart-shaped cookies in between. Cas noticed an Angel-shaped cookie cutter off to the side, right next to it a heart-shaped one; that must have been what Dean had secretly bought. The human figures had apparently been cut out by hand.
“Sure,” I immediately said. Of course he could. He could, and I loved it. I would have loved any nickname he could have given me.
"Not nice ones," Cas said quietly. "Calling me the f-slur. Also calling me other things. Homophobic, mostly."
"Your suit," Cas replied. "You were gone fast that night and uhm ..." he stopped himself right there. They hadn't talked about anything that had happened that night, and Cas really didn't feel like changing that now. Den had been in a sudden bad mood, and Cas still didn't understand what that had been about, but as long as Dean wouldn't do anything like it again, he was willing to play along his little game pretending that never happened. "Anyway," he said, "I washed it."
The first time Cas saw Dean that day was during lunchbreak, where they followed their usual routine including some subtle touching and hand holding. Both Jo and Charlie commented on it, and both women agreed that this was perfect as it was and they should just stick to it in the afternoon.
"Dean is really nice," she said, her eyes sparkling, "and he's funny. And if he's your boyfriend, that means he's around a lot, yeah?"
“You’ve missed out on Christmas baking, so that’s what we’re gonna do. You go to the store, while I get the kitchen ready.”
Cas leaned in as well to see that he wasn't in it, and he showed the two girls a quick smile as Dean said "thank you"
Cas had to catch Claire as she tried to run towards Dean when he had just walked on stage, but after a quick explanation she understood that she couldn't go there and there were no further incidents, everything went perfectly fine.
The hall was busy, as they had expected it to be. Lots of rich people in expensive clothes, sipping expensive champagne out of expensive glasses, chatting and laughing, all together pretending to be there for the charity event, but secretly they all knew it was just another opportunity to show off. In the middle of all that, Dean and Cas, chatting to these exact people, Sam somewhere around the round, out of sigh but probably doing the same, and hopefully, a werewolf in disguise somewhere among the guests.
Another thing I had subconsciously done, I had started picking out only the green ones. One might say, so what? The green ones are probably his favourite. But no. No, my favourites were the brown ones. At least those had been my favourites the last time I had opened a pack of M&Ms before a pair of beautiful green eyes had started to become a permanent image burned into my mind at all times.
The music stopped after a few final chords, Cas was rather sure that was the end of the song, and he forced himself not to look over, but he was almost sure they were now being stared at.
"Well," he said, "let's say, I know that there are certain things happening between you and another man. But in favour of you being good at what you do and preventing unwanted rumours, I choose to ignore them. And if you can ensure me that from now on those things will happen strictly only behind locked doors and closed curtains, I will choose to continue to ignore them."
For that occasion, Dean had been invited to a radio show for an interview, and Charlie had excitedly advised him to do it as it was great marketing for the album release.
"We don't really got anything ..." the girl on the right then replied nervously, "but we, uhm ... could we take a selfie with you? If that's okay?"
And when he said that, when he told her that it just kinda happened, he meant it. Not the kisses on the title page of the magazine on the table, obviously not. But his feelings for Dean, and what it did to him when Dean kissed him, or touched him, or even only smiled at him, Cas hadn't wanted that, and it really had just happened.
"No, it’s …" Dean sighed and returned his gaze onto Cas, "I mean, you told me about your unpleasant past, right? It’s only fair that I do the same"
Dean chuckled as he walked over to the two desks and tucked his bag away under the free one. Then he turned and put the coffee down in front of Jo with a charming grin.
“Ah,” I groaned. “Dean. Remember what I said about this not lasting long? If the pants don’t even come off before this ends, I’m going to be pissed”
I was of course aware that I was not William Shakespeare but instead nothing but an American English teacher with a love for poetry and a big crush on my colleague, but the urge of at least trying to write a poem about Dean stayed strong. It didn’t let me focus on anything else. Not even hours later, as I was sitting in the library that afternoon trying to get some work done, it didn’t go away. No, the thought stayed right there on my mind, prominent as it was, stubbornly keeping me from working through the stack of essays in front of me.
No kissing today, they had agreed. And for just a second there, Cas thought Dean would break that promise. Because he leaned in, bringing his face so close to Cas's that Cas was sure - and scared - Dean would kiss him right then and there.
I even like to remember the time I had to spend without him, when I had to return to the school in fall while he stayed in his hometown, still looking for his true passion that he eventually found in being a car mechanic for the rest of his work life. I remember how I missed him, I terribly missed him every single day he wasn’t there with me, giving me silent company in the library or simply smiling at me from across the table. But I also remember the countless letters and phone calls, and the constant anticipation to see him again. The way my heart made leaps of pure joy every time another break came and his car pulled up in front of the school to pick me up.
Then they fell silent for a moment. Cas was trying to make out pieces of the girls' conversation while holding Dean's hand on the arm rest again, whereas Dean was calmly sipping on his coffee.
"No, actually," she said, "I mean I did immediately recognise you when I saw the photos, but that's probably because I knew something like that was coming. I know people who know you as well and who have seen the photos, and I haven't heard any of them mention you with a word. Maybe they have a little thought like
"Yeah but that's the point!" The girl on the right argued. "You got privacy. And I'm just guessing judged by the kissing that they want some as well"
In other cases, Dean would approach Garth with an idea, or they'd come up with one the team meeting, and he then would work out his first draft that Dean then got to review.
"Yeah," he sighed, "sorry. I noticed people taking photos. Just random passers-by, no paparazzi, but they're still gonna end up online. I'm used to that, but I didn't wanna drag you and the kid into it. I'm sorry about that. Shouldn't have taken off the sunglasses"
"No," Cas replied with a soft smile. And he meant it. A couple days ago, that would have probably scared him. But right now, it just felt good. He was okay with it. It felt right.
Of course he wanted to come, he was sure about that, but maybe that was the main reason why he shouldn't. Sure, he wanted to see the final outcome of his work and he wanted to get the concert backstage feeling and see the fans' excitement, but another reason why he wanted to come, and he had to admit that to himself, was that he wanted to be close to Dean.
The first person they talked to, and the only one Cas was properly introduced to, was a brunette woman with a cheeky smile in a dress that seemed significantly more normal to Cas than all the others. This one seemed significantly more ... prom.
"Well, there originally were 13 songs planned for the album," Cas explained, "and after we had those 13 down, I took that break, and when I came back, it suddenly was 14. Everyone thought we were done and then Dean stormed in with that one just one morning and everyone had to pull all-nighters to get it done in time"
“Fine, it’s stupid though.” Dean swallowed then he put his best self-deprecating smile on.  He couldn’t believe he was actually about to say this out loud. “Sam thinks you love me.”  He scoffed.  It was ridiculous.  Cas was going to laugh, well maybe not laugh.  Probably just give that cute little head tilt when he doesn’t quite understand.
“Yeah they can pretty much do anything human’s can.”  Dean was silent for a few long minutes and staring into space without seeing. Sam was starting to fear that he broke his poor brother’s brain.
“You tell them what a dork they are, but that you’ll put up with it anyway.”  When Dean pulled away both blue eyes were now trained on him. Cas leaned forward and planted a soft kiss on his lips.
“Yeah it’s great.”  Dean smiled and took Cas’ hand. “Come on.”  He turned and led the way to his bedroom, Cas close behind.  Once Dean closed the door his hands set to work divesting Cas of his coat and jacket, and shirt, and tie.
“Hey, you’re not useless!  You’re still the guy who wasted all those sorry bastards in hell!  You saved my ass more than a few times.”  This gave him an idea; he pushed Cas back a little so he could strip off his coat and flannel.  Cas’ eyes were red-rimmed and confused.  “Look, you pulled me from the pit.  See right here.”  He rolled up his t-shirt sleeve to reveal the handprint.  The proof that Cas had once been an angel, maybe the only tangible proof there is left.  Cas fitted his hand (his good one luckily enough) over the spot, Dean almost immediately felt warmth spread from the touch.
“Will you lay with me?” He was already moving toward the middle of the bed.  Dean knew he wasn’t talking about anything sexual, he wanted to cuddle.  Dean thought about all the pain he saw in Cas today and the hurt he was feeling at being kicked out of the bunker.  He thought he should be the last person Cas turned to for comfort, but at the same time was glad that his angel still wanted him close.  He didn’t answer, just crawled under the covers and slotted himself against Cas, to which the angel made himself comfortable.
“Why you cast me out.”  It’s then that Dean notices the pain in his hand where the cast is digging in, because Cas is trying to hold his hand tighter.  Hearing him say that Dean ‘cast’ him out, made him hate the decision even more, which he didn’t think was possible.  He was cast out of heaven, was Dean’s betrayal just as bad? “Dean, please, I don’t understand” Cas was crying, so Dean does the only thing he can, He wrapped his arms around him and rubbed his back, trying to say something soothing.  “I don’t know what I am anymore, I try to be human, but it always goes wrong somehow.  I once led an army of angels into hell, and we won!  I can’t…I’m useless now.”  Dean held tight through his short rant, but couldn’t hear more.
“Fine.  Can tells you he loves you, you like the idea of the two of you together, and…ah…apparently you think his big blue eyes are just dreamy.”  Sam called it a win when his brother’s jaw clenched at that, “But that’s all…whatever, you’ll ignore it completely.  Just tell me this; what would be so bad about it?”  Dean paced and sputtered for a few moments before shutting down; arms crossed, brother knows best look firmly in place, and Sam knew it was all over.  He just wasn’t going to get this idiot to admit to anything.
.  He understood now, like somehow his soul was brighter…and he could somehow feel that. Cas kissed him for long minutes again, Dean happy to let him take control.
“It’s when you say sweet things to each other after sex.”  Dean started kissing Cas, but he made no effort to kiss back so Dean moved to his cheek. “You say how good they made you feel.”  A kiss on his nose. “You talk about how devastatingly handsome they are.”  He kissed the corner of Cas’ mouth where it curled up in a poorly concealed smile. “You say how fucking lucky you are to have them”
“Yeah, I mean you fight sometimes, but you always forgive each other, you’ve been together for years now.” Then Dean smiled again, a small dreamy thing that had Sam mentally smacking his forehead.
“I have realized that your…preferences don’t include,” He gestured toward himself, “but it is just a vessel.”  Cas paused and Dean was trying so hard to find the right words, but they were all stuck in his throat. “Though even without it I have always been referred to as he.  Castiel is a male name, though I suppose you wouldn’t know that.”  Cas was rambling and Dean couldn’t get his brain to quiet.
“Well what do you want me to do? Sit together holding hands and watching rom-coms?”  Typical overcompensating, Sam took a deep breath because he wasn’t here to get into it with Dean.  “And what do you mean ‘I’ almost lost him?”
When Dean’s memories returned to him he didn’t remember what had happened during the curse.  So Sam didn’t have to face Dean’s anger at being led to believe he and Cas were dating, but it sat uncomfortably in the back of Sam’s mind.  He could only remember how ok Dean was with the fantasy.  Not just ok, he had been happy to be in a relationship with the angel.  He knew it would go over about as well as keying the Impala, but Sam knew that he and Dean needed to have a talk, a real talk, about this.  If it was something that would make two of the three most important people in the world to him happy, it would be worth it to try.
“Sam thinks you said it because you’re in love with me.”  Cas looked away then, that fidget of his when he knows he’s been caught lying.  “I mean, you know there’s a difference right?”
“About what?”  Cas’ brow creases in concern and he pitches forward a little, still slouched as if tired.  Weary, Dean’s mind supplied.
“Something like that.”  Dean nodded proudly, Sam was surprised at how easily he not only believed, but continued to follow a man he was slowly starting to forget.  Maybe there was something instinctual in there that made Dean know Sam wouldn’t harm him.  Maybe it was just because Sam was the only one around.  “There’s Cas too.”
“And yeah maybe I did it for my own entertainment at first, but I kept it up because it seemed to make you so happy!”  Dean scoffed.
. He really didn’t know what to do now.  Was this a mistake?  What was Dean thinking! Well, Dean hadn’t been thinking. That was the problem, not with his upstairs brain anyway.  Fuck did he just ruin their friendship because he couldn’t keep it in his pants?  Cas stood awkwardly, just like Dean, under the weight of their silence.  Then he reached for his pants.
“No.” Dean’s breath left him in a quick woosh.  The room, the whole bunker, was still in a way Dean had never felt, but all he could focus on was the hands toying with that coat.
“I think your face, this face is very nice to look at.”  Dean hated himself for it, but he could feel his cheeks blush at the compliment.  “I like these spots…freckles, I like your freckles.”  Dean couldn’t take the way he was looking at him, like he was something precious. “And I never knew your eyes were green, they’re beautiful.”
“Yeah, I get it.  Sorry babe, I’ll watch it from now on.”  Satisfied with Dean’s promise he returned to sucking Dean’s brain out of his dick.  Dean had been deep throated a few times before, but this was something else.  He could feel his cock hitting the back of his throat and he just kept swallowing around the length in his mouth.  Dean was helpless, but to grip the back of Cas’ head, surely pulling at his hair. He caught a few, ‘Oh my God’s’ before they had a chance to leave his mouth.  Cas started to pull off only to suckle at the head tonguing at the slit like Dean was his favorite flavor of ice cream.  Dean pulled Cas off, but he couldn’t suppress another whimper at the loss.
“Fuck Cas.” Dean breathed against his lips when they pulled apart.  Cas hummed contentedly all the while running his hand up Dean’s back, over his t-shirt.  One of Dean’s hands was still grasping Cas’ lapel the other hand settled around his waist.  He felt good.  He couldn’t describe it, like a bright light was shinning out of him.  He suddenly remembered what Meg had said years ago after kissing Cas,
“Yeah, I do,” Dean smirked. “There have been quite enough publishers complaining about that over the years”
"Maybe, yeah," she laughed. "Maybe it's also that I like spending time with my best friend and my favourite adorable little Angel"
Jo brought pizza, and the three of them sat down in the kitchen and enjoyed it with great fun. Claire was always happy to see Jo, and having her over for dinner always turned into an event for the little girl.
They had been excited for the upcoming album release anyway, and Dean unexpectedly confirming rumours about him dating had them even more excited. Social media suddenly exploded with tweets about Dean again as fans were excitedly blurting out various versions of
"I told you," Jo laughed, "fucking idiots" Then she turned to Dean and Cas. "I'm glad you figured it out though," she said, "And I'm really happy for you. But to make that clear, I won't sit and listen to you two fucking ever again"
"You ..." she started, then interrupted herself. "No, hold on. So when you asked me about him, and I was teasing you about how he's your type, you knew him already?"
"I haven't made a list," Cas chuckled. "Well, not a physical one. In my head, maybe. The one big pro is of course that I worked on the album and I'd love to see it performed. And being there backstage as part of the crew, so to speak, that's ... I mean come on, when would I ever get a chance like this again?"
