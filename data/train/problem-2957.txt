“ Anytime, darlin’.” Dean huffs out in a small laugh. He waits until Claire disengages on her own and watches as Cas is given the same treatment before the older man eases Claire back under the covers with a kiss to the forehead. “ Goodnight, Claire. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
Dean accepts, his grip strong around Castiel’s wrist. Once Dean is standing, Castiel realizes they are very very close together. Like, kissing distance close. Feeling Dean’s breath on his cheek close. Memories of that one heated kiss only a month ago burst into his thoughts. Castiel makes a concerted effort to not look at Dean’s lips and takes a step back, his sight blurring slightly around the edges as he whips his head around to see Cain sitting between Claire and Jack, staring openly at the other two men.
Dean kicks his brother’s foot as he passes by on his way to the little countertop in the corner. “ I didn’t even have it that long,” he protests as he drops the donut boxes onto the counter and settles next to Jess on the edge of the hospital bed. He offers her the smaller box filled with cinnamon Munchkins.
“ Don't.” Cas spills out, expression morphing fully into apology. “ You didn’t do anything wrong. I --I wanted it. Want it, but…” He reaches behind him and Dean knows he’s touching the baby monitor in his back pocket.
The children have two young women who share the hours looking after them, and Castiel doesn’t know how he got so lucky. Ambriel and Lenore, sisters who share an apartment near the elementary school, are capable, funny, and kind, and attained an instant rapport with both Claire and Jack. The younger, Ambriel, is a full time biochemistry undergrad at MTSU. She watches Jack while Claire is at school during the mornings and every other Saturday when Castiel has his weekend shift. Her older sister, Lenore, works from their apartment an IT tech; she takes care of Jack in the afternoons and picks Claire up from the school just down the road. Together, they keep Claire and Jack happy and safe while Castiel is at work.
Rookie move, indeed. Castiel swipes through his own photos and finds a picture from last year. Gabriel had actually managed to catch a much younger giggling Jack in midstream, Castiel leaning over the changing table with his mouth firmly clamped shut as pee drips from his chin. Castiel remembers that day; he’d been tired, new parent tired, but not emotionally fragile like so many days before and after. He’d felt enough like himself to give his brother an impressive stink eye and middle finger, both perfectly captured by the camera.
Castiel tilts Alex up more against his shoulder, the baby grasping lightly against his sweatshirt. Quiet scritch of tiny scratching fingernails. He glances at the clock on the DVD player near the TV and sees it’s past bedtime for his own little ones. But, they’re having a good time. Claire, singing quietly to Alex. Jack, being helpful down the hall.
Castiel is astounded, as always, at Charlie’s skills. She is scarily efficient. And the way she speaks to her computer, again, puts him in the mind of how Dean coddles his car. He waits silently while the woman works, not wanting to interrupt her thought process.
Castiel stares wordlessly. At beautiful caring Dean who just risked his own safety to keep Castiel and the children safe. Who watched over the children while Castiel dealt with the issue to keep them from worrying. Who asks how Castiel is, instead of politely making his exit back to his disrupted evening.
Castiel stands and moves behind Charlie to better see the pictures. This Ruby is apparently quite the party girl. Most of the photos are of the young woman dressed to kill, drink in hand, mingling with equally well dressed young people, the backgrounds a rotating mix of clubs, parties, and foreign skylines. He remains silent as Aaron swipes through the timeline.
“ But they have a whole bunch of collars and leashes in this drawer in the guest bedroom--”
“ Dating like Patience and Alfie? Kaia says they kiss all the freakin’ time. And they spend all their money on the movies and won’t take Kaia with them.”
tonight?”
Castiel takes pity on her, despite his own problems, and shakes his head reassuringly. “ You were, what I think they call,
Dean squawks. Like a rooster in a dunking booth. Both hands tighten on Castiel, holding on with a death grip that Castiel can feel through his thick sweatshirt and causes his fingers to ache. The slender waist is tense against his arm.
is the only word Castiel’s brain can come up with and it feels woefully inadequate.
Dean bites down his laughter at Jack’s pronunciations. Instead, he ruffles the boy’s hair. “ I look forward to trying some of his leftovers today.” Jack is looking very intently at Dean’s phone again and Dean asks, “ You want to see more pictures?”
“ Daddy.” Jack pulls the book open again and flips until he finds a picture of Cas. “ Daddy, Din. Dat hn Taire Daddy. Siwwy Daddy.” He points to a photo of Cas making a silly face at the camera. It looks like it was taken at Claire’s first birthday.
And then they’re inside. Door locked. Standing in the kitchen with only the nightlight over the sink casting soft yellow light and sharp shadows across the room.
Jack stares at the sock in Dean’s hand for a long moment, then sets his little face in a determined expression, and lunges into the washing machine.
“ Yep. Good morning to you.” He steps aside to let her into the bathroom, but she continues to stand in the hall, confused and squinty eyed.
But someone is knocking insistently on his bedroom door, chasing his precious shut-eye away. “ Ugh, wha’?” His voice is rough and Dean isn’t even sure if the person in the hall heard him. “ What?” He makes more of an effort and is rewarded with Sam’s head popping into his bedroom.
“ Night-night, Din.” Jack squeezes Dean around the neck and buzzes a kiss across his chin.
Then he goes online and finds the Etsy shop printed on the business card. Dean is impressed by the products listed. Raw honey, infused honey, beeswax candles and lip balms, handmade wooden bee decor. There’s a brief moment when Dean’s feelings swarm together and knot up uncomfortably. There’s sympathy and loss and even the ghost of jealousy as he reads over the description of Cain’s lemon verbena infused honey, lovingly labeled
It's perfect.
Jack instantly hugs Dean’s arm, wide eyes and wobbly lip turned up. “ Sowwy, Din.” Apparently, Claire has explained his part in the injury.
Dean doesn’t remember him. It’s awful and nightmarish, what he does remember, but Dean doesn’t actually remember the screams and burning. Not like Castiel does and… And… Castiel makes a smile appear on his own face, not as easy as Dean’s, but passable. “ I’m glad you’re all right now. I’m glad... an angel was watching over you, as Sam believes.” God, he did not just compare himself to an angel. Blasphemy.“ Have a good night, Dean.” Castiel ducks his head to hide the grimace he can feel stretching his face, barely acknowledging Dean’s similar night tidings, and hurries toward the corner of the house where he can safely hide his shame.
A few steps away, holding a jug of lemonade and a stack of multicolored plastic tumblers, are two familiar faces; Castiel Novak and Jack. Holy crap, this is Twilight Zone levels of coincidence.
Dean resists the urge to melt into a puddle. “ Yeah? What’s on your mind?”
Castiel forces his eyes to open to the sight of Dean at eye level over the edge of the mattress. Strong scents of toothpaste and shampoo waft across the sheets. “ Hey, beautiful.”
“ So good, Cas. Christ.” Dean is murmuring softly as his hips rock in tiny motions, his cock sliding carefully against Castiel’s parted lips and tongue. “ But… but you know I’m good with a handjob. You don’t have to--Oh Christ!”
Dean toes off his shoes and throws himself onto his couch, leaving the light off so he can more easily see the view outside. And it makes for better moping.
Then Jack stands on the stool and pushes his belly out and pushes his penis down with his fingers and pees in the big potty. His pee is loud on the potty water, but Daddy says that’s good because it means his pee is getting in the potty instead of on the floor. Jack is really good at peeing in the big potty. He can make his pee hit the little red and white circles under the water almost every time! Daddy is always so proud of him when he hits the circles.
Firefirefirefirefire…
“ Wake up! C’mon, son!”
While Claire and Jack compare driving notes, Cas looks down at Dean through the open door, his smile turning apologetic again as he shifts his weight to his near foot, Jack leaning too far out for his father’s liking. “ I’ll help the next time you wash her, or pay for--”
“ You still have to confirm that she’s been here for each email. In the meantime, let’s see what Google has to say about her.” He minimizes Karl-E and brings up the search engine, typing in the woman’s name and current city and state.
“ I’ve worked with Gabriel in the past.” Cain adds. “ And I knew Dean a--”
“ Yeah, it was taking too long, so I upped the ante. Thought that might set a fire under your tight little ass.” Ruby grins. “ It’s not like I was making it difficult, you know. I’d hang around for a couple hours after I sent them, just waiting to see if you’d poke your head out.” She rolls her eyes and taps a perfectly manicured fingernail- bright red like her lipstick- against the small stack of books on the table next to her. Castiel glances at the spines; all cookbooks. Ruby shrugs. “ I mean, I know you’re not one of these people that’s constantly checking your email, work or otherwise, but I mean, not a single reaction? Ever? Not a single tick or twitch or even a frownier frown than usual? ”
A few minutes later, they step outside into the warm darkness, feet crunching over the loose gravel near the stoop before crossing over onto the paved portion of the drive.  Meg’s little burgundy Hyundai is parked at the bottom and Castiel had eyed it seriously through the window when she pulled up, judging the remaining amount of space in the wide driveway and finally deeming it enough for the Impala to get by with safe margins.
It’s a few minutes before Dean is reminded of his own neglected hard on when he bumps it with his wrist trying to get a better angle. He hisses through his teeth and thrusts forward to get a glancing blow against Cas’ underwear. It’s not enough. “ Cas? Cas, touch me.”
“ Then just make an extra nice dinner at your place. Or hell, I can give you some numbers and you can just have it catered. No work, no fuss, all the yummy rewards. And you two can quietly shag after the kiddos go to bed.”
A rush of bitter wet heat down his throat. A hard body arching off the bed. Rough gasping breaths.
Castiel sighs and answers before the other man has a chance. “
Like now, with
“ Dean, nothing about you is a waste of time.”
Instead of staying with them at Bobby’s. Dean sighs, but honestly, this is better than he’d expected. His first thought when he realized it was his brother calling had been that Sam was canceling the trip altogether. The tightness in his middle relaxes a bit, enough for him to cover with a lame joke.“ Awww, but I put a scented candle in the upstairs bathroom. Just for you.”
It continues until a cold breeze sweeps across the back of Dean’s neck, right between the afghan and his hairline, and he shivers violently. “ Okay. I’m loving this romcom moment, but we need to get inside. Christ, you’re not even wearing shoes! What the fuck, Cas?”
“ Jack’s little kiss is what sent you over isn’t it?”
Pain. Heat. Smoke.
Claire is seated comfortably at the small dining table tucked into a corner just beyond the kitchen’s border, Dr. Moore and Sam flanking her in mismatched chairs. Cain is at the kitchen counter, pouring Kool-Aid into the cups provided, lining them up, as he tells the story of the time his cat, Faulkner, chased a chipmunk into one of his beehives. Castiel knows Claire has heard this story several times, but it’s one of her favorites. He doesn’t interrupt as he takes a cup of drink and finds a spot on the kitchen floor out of the way, happily leaning back against a lower cabinet door. Jack promptly climbs into his lap.
Castiel almost misses the little exhale from across the table, relief flooding Dean’s visibly tense frame. He had obviously been more worried about Claire’s reaction than Castiel had expected. Smiling at the younger man, Castiel replies to his daughter, “ Well, I can pass on the candy to you and Jack, but I do happen to like daisies very much.”
Sam runs his hands through his hair, puppy dog eyes taken down a few notches with Dean’s acceptance. “ Thanks, really. I know she won’t skip a visit, but it really bothers me with how big she’s gotten. But I sure as hell didn’t want to say anything to her about it.”
.” Claire looks decidedly concerned.
Many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, or comments!!!
Claire’s voice echoes back from the bathroom. “ Later, alligator!”
A variety of underwear. A rating upgrade. And an innocently cracky bonus.
, but you very promptly fell asleep.”
Chapter title is stolen from Aerosmith's
Dean refuses the bait. “ Yessir.” Nothing but
Both kids are satisfied and Cas is smiling that big crinkley eyed, gummy smile that makes Dean feel fuzzy inside.
“ Night-night, buddy.” Dean returns the hug and blows a tiny raspberry on Jack’s temple. “ Sweet dreams.” He hands Jack back to Cas, again dazzled by the smile on the older man’s face.
Claire and Jack don't get enough credit.
So enamoured by the image, Castiel almost forgets the actual text message that has apparently been sent by Jess, unbeknownst to Dean. >>
Gift Basket, he gets the most amazing things. Sometimes Cain even gives him off menu items, like the juniper berry and brown sugar syrup last month. So, Dean is more than happy to dig through the heavy duty paper bag, pulling out each thing to inspect, which mostly means opening everything and smelling it. But first, he needs to be a good guest and gathers two bottles of beer from the fridge, popping the caps and handing off one to Cain before taking a swig from his own.
“ Okay, gross.” Charlie wrinkles her nose, but clicks on the link.
r u drunk?
Jack is quiet, but leaning over Dean’s lap and the book. At first, Dean thinks he wants in on the hug action, but then the little hands are clawing at the back pages of the album. Dean slips his fingers behind the last page in the album and flips it open. He feels like he’s been punched in the gut, all the air rushing out in a sharp exhale as Jack points and tells Dean, “ Fafa.”
but it sounds like
Castiel nods, setting his mouth in a thin line. Charlie nods back and brings the live cameras back onto the computer screen. “ She’s in the reading corner. You want us to come with?”
Gabriel himself seems more settled since he and Kali have decided to give it another go. He’s the one who brought out the top shelf whiskey when the children were securely in their beds, but Gabriel has remained uncharacteristically sober; still sipping on his first pour as Castiel slurped up his third. Gabriel looks warm and loose limbed, like Castiel feels, but his laughter isn’t as braying, his jokes not as off color. Castiel realizes this is one of his favorite sides of Gabriel’s. Responsible-thoughtful-adult Gabriel who goes overboard on decorating for someone else’s kids and then stays up late into the night on Christmas Eve helping his younger brother set up the presents and assemble an entire Playskool kitchen set.
He decides on
“ No problem, Cas.” Dean’s voice is breathy, barely heard even in the quiet of the bedroom.
“ Because we have none of our own,” interjects Aaron from the other side of the room, head still down, earbuds still in place.
Castiel flinches at the volume just as the door swings open and a laughing Dean appears. The younger man is wearing unripped faded jeans and a dark green henley. Casual, but neat. Much like Castiel.
He’s grinning when he leaves the bedroom, pulling the door closed with just a crack. The nerves attempt to return as he strides down the hallway, through the living room and back into the den. But Dean is still there.
“ Clarence what’s got your panties in a twist this time?” Meg’s dark voice is oddly soothing over the line.
The noise recedes as Castiel steps through the staff door into the communal work area that bridges the adult and children’s sides of the library. He shares one largish corner with Garth, the younger man happily relinquishing half his space so the new hire wouldn’t have to sit at a tiny countertop next to the printer.
With his folders in hand, Castiel strides through the staff door to the adult side and Aaron sitting at the adult desk. The younger librarian is silently playing solitaire on his computer. “ I’m here, Aaron.”
Jack puts on his frowny face because Daddy’s door is closed. That’s not okay. Daddy’s door is always open. So Jack opens it and sneaks in
Jess appears from fucking nowhere and stands in front of the board in apparent indecision. She smells vaguely of rain, recently returned from a short break outside to clear away her lingering morning sickness. Dean hates it for her. Jess taps the capped end of the blue dry erase marker against her chin before turning to Dean. “ What do you think, Dean? Feeling lucky today?”
“ Yeah,” Dean gathers his wits and gets a head nod in before a twitch of his hips brings their clothed hard-ons into contact and he loses his sanity for another moment. “ Oh, god, Cas, ” he breathes heavily, foreheads pressed together. Dean tilts his chin to land a few kisses before pulling back enough to make legitimate eye contact. “ I’m so okay with this. Are you?”
“ I’ll be in the den.” Dean grunts softly as he rises to his feet, brushing his hand across Cas’ shoulder as he whispers his destination. Cas reaches up and touches his hand briefly before turning back to Claire, singing quietly off key.
The cum is already cooling on his fist, but Dean continues to stroke slowly through the mess, wringing out the last bits of pleasure from Cas’ orgasm. Christ, the man is beautiful. Sexy as hell. Dean attempts to shift, careful of his own greasy hard on straining against tight fabric, and noses at Cas’ cheek before placing a soft kiss on the stubble. Cas gives a tiny whimper and a weak thrust of his hips. Dean grins. “ Doin’ good?”
And then, there’d been Inias. Castiel had been blindsided by the young man’s naive infatuation after only a few shared nights and his clumsy rejection had been met with a shaky smile and more understanding than Castiel felt worthy of. The heartbreaking sight of Inias fighting back tears had been more than enough to dampen Castiel’s desire for any further dating adventures. He stopped seeking out company and gently rebuffed any interest shown him. And happily made do with erotic fiction and his right hand. Risk free satisfaction.
“ That, too. Though I can’t see it right now.”
“ Should look in a mirr-ro-ror y-yourself.” Dean stutters when Castiel begins sucking on his Adam’s apple.
Cain steps around Castiel and nudges him gently with an elbow as he passes. When Castiel looks up, the older man has the same expression as before, softened by a smile.
And, Castiel can admit to himself that it’s mainly because of Dean’s increased presence in their lives. In his life.
“ Hello.” Cain is looking at him with those soft eyes, then he quietly clears his throat and begins adding up the prices, hands steadily placing each container safely into a paper bag. “ How are you?”
Castiel had loved Amelia, in his own way he was certain, but what they had together was more about comfort and expectation. Easy to convince themselves of a deeper authentic connection when everyone around them kept commenting on how well they got along. Easy to fall into two years without arguments, without hardship, without any real passion.  Officially ending it had merely been the natural progression of their drifting apart. And indulging in emotion fueled break-up sex had not been the best of ideas, but he’d never regretted Claire’s conception. But, even without the sharing of a child, he and Amelia would have remained close friends. They seemed made for it. After Amelia, Castiel had gone back to the single life with much less enthusiasm than before.  He scratched the itch when it arose. Did his best to avoid awkward morning afters and any emotional attachments from his partners.
Dean protests, because of course he does. “ It’s okay, Cas. I can--”
Dean takes that information in. “ You didn’t say anything to him?” Maybe this is a bit heavy to start off with. In a Starbucks. On a Sunday morning.
“ Uh, thank you.” Castiel stumbles over the unexpected compliment. From Dean it had made him feel warm and safe, from this stranger he feels decidedly creepy, but he remains polite.
“ That’s how you get mono.”
you managed to do that. I don’t want you in any trouble, especially over this.”
“ I guess that’s the real question.” Castiel mumbles, deep in thought. “ She’s bold, unafraid. She might think she’s helping him.”
Dean catches his amused little smirk and defends himself with, “ I take my sleep seriously.”
“ Cas? Thassyers…”
Jack reaches up to carefully investigate the curl sticking up on his crown and flashes Castiel the brightest grin. “ Tane you! Taire! Taire, see m’air!” He scrambles up and runs after Claire to show off his new look.
Dean listens with rapt attention, letting Claire guide him through the album. Jack occasionally interejects his own opinion, but he seems mostly content to just look and listen to his sister’s running commentary.  Sometimes Dean will ask a question or make a comment to get Claire to open up a bit more, or to smile when it seems like she’s getting a bit too down. That always seems to happen when they come across a photo that has obviously been cropped to exclude a person near Kelly.
Dean doesn’t seem to realize there’s anything odd about Castiel’s wide eyed silence, broad grin stretching across his face. “ Hey, Cas! Whatcha doin’ out here so late?”
Castiel sighs heavily and glances around the immediate area. He can’t escape Rowena’s nosiness, but he can keep it limited to just the two of them. “ He’s not
Castiel smiles at the familiar Gaelic word for love and his daughter’s somber vow. He also inwardly applauds Rowena’s clever ceremony that keeps the toy away from the newborn’s mouth until it can be sanitized again. “ I’m certain Dean will bring the baby home to visit very soon.” Actually he figures it’ll be a few weeks at the very least, germs and all. But he can do what he can to make the time pass by more quickly. Maybe they can make a baby basket or parent care package of some kind to give to Dean to pass on to Sam and Jess.
Bits and pieces.
Meg grins as she drops into her seat and lets Castiel shut the door. She immediately rolls down the window and pokes her head out, glancing at Dean manually pulling open the garage door down the way. “  You deserve to be happy, Castiel.”
“ We were.” Castiel confirms, releasing the children and nudging them forward with his knees in order to get into the house and out of the cold.  He watches as Claire greets Dean with her customary fist bump and Jack demands his hug. Dean returns each with his usual enthusiasm, and an extra layer of affection. After the fist bump, Dean gently ruffles Claire’s outrageously disheveled hair. He snuggles Jack a bit longer, speaking quietly to him, Jack nodding solemnly.
And after he’d gotten his head screwed back on straight, Dean hadn’t thrown out the idea of falling in love again, he just… decided not to bother with it. And it was easy, with nursing school and working full time and helping Ellen at the bar and Bobby at the salvage yard. Dean submerged himself in work and family and those little twinges in his chest whenever Sam talked about Jess like she hung the moon and stars, well, they got easier and easier to ignore. Pushed aside by short flings and random bar pick-ups, no strings attached and no hits to his broken heart. Until those lovely blue eyes showed up in his exam room.
“ Thanks, man.” Aaron quickly exits out of his game, then saves his open documents. Castiel catches a glimpse of Jewish folktale websites and a genealogy chart. Aaron has recently become highly interested in his Jewish heritage and Castiel certainly can’t fault the young man for using the library’s resources to further his research. Or doing it on the clock. A quick glance around shows Castiel a typical Saturday crowd.
Dean nods, brain ticking off his checklist before he makes a diagnosis. “ Okay, so Jack definitely has an ear infection, left ear and the beginnings of one in the right. But since he’s basically been exposed to the virus from the shot and being in here- sad fact, lots of kids catch stuff from waiting rooms despite precautions- so I’m gonna do a swab and check for influenza too, just to completely rule that out before I prescribe antibiotics.”
Castiel watches as Dean frowns, mouth open to repeat his protestations, but Cain raises a stern brow and Dean huffs over to the couch and carefully lowers himself into Cain’s spot.
“ What about emergency vehicles?” Jess asks.
New Year's Day continues with the children and Unca Gay.
“ It’s not that small.”
Dean gets to his apartment much less jovial than when he left it. Sure he's still a bit hot under the collar because that kiss, but the joy is mostly dampened by the fact that they can’t go any further than that one lovely kiss.
lol, really? tell me more abot how gorgeous i am
“ I’ll help. You have a seat, Dean. Recover.” Cain interjects firmly, standing from the couch with a quiet, “ If you’ll excuse me,” to the children.  Jack waves. Claire gives him a thumbs up.
“ Nuh uh.” Claire begins.
Castiel settles on his side (the scarred one),  head cradled in the soft pillow, watching Dean turn off the bedside lamp and letting his eyes adjust to the darkness as Dean settles in, facing him. An arm is tossed over his side, pulling him closer, resting heavy in the slight dip of his hip. Castiel reciprocates with his top arm thrown over Dean’s, bent at the elbow to curve his hand around the younger man’s neck. Their unoccupied arms are trapped between them, hands beneath their chins. Dean’s fingers curl around Castiel’s upturned wrist, gently smoothing over the pulse point on the inside. Castiel hasn’t shared this simple kind of intimacy with anyone in years.
“ Goddammit,” Dean mutters under his breath, unplugging and replugging the data cord. Again. “ Now?”
There’s nothing fancy about the Hunter Hollow Roadhouse, inside or out (much like its distant cousin in South Dakota), though the inside is definitely much newer since Benny had it renovated only four years ago. The building is an old, single story dive that most people wouldn’t glance twice at along the two lane highway that connects Antioch and Mt. Juliet, where there’s constant new growth and the nearest ramp to I-40. It used to be even more rundown when it was a shady biker bar called Purgatory, run by one badass bitch named Eve. Eventually there’d been one drug bust too many and Eve had abandoned ship, leaving her long time bartender, Benny LaFitte, in the lurch. Benny had managed to avoid jail time and purchased the building at foreclosure and sunk his meager savings into turning the place into an aboveboard bar and grill. Now the Roadhouse is filled during the weekdays with the lunch crowd eager to fill up on amazing burgers and fries (Benny had to hire another fry cook just to handle the to-go orders) and on the weekends a slightly rowdier crowd streams in to sample homemade gumbo and either sing off key during karaoke on Fridays or kick back and enjoy whatever local band Benny’s scrounged up for Saturday night.
because he knows regardless of whatever happens next he’s not going to want to deal with anything else tonight and his precious car shouldn’t have to suffer. He isn’t nearly as careful as he should be pulling into the garage (not quite straight, with not enough room on the passenger side) but the car is under cover and that’s all Dean needs. He hops out, door slam almost lost under another cluster of loud pops. He can just make out a shower of red and gold sparks over a distant treeline. People must be firing them off on the lakeshore.
“ You’ll surpass them all, I’m certain.” Rowena grins and nudges Jack toward the cauldron sitting on the floor at her feet. She digs around, looking for something inside, before hiding it in her cupped hands. “ Now, I saved something extra special for you two. These talismans have an extra spell cast upon them. Monster Protection and Nightmares Begone keeps away monsters
Castiel grunts in response but refuses to unwrap himself from around the warm body he’s spooning. Being the big spoon brings a goofy smile to his face. But he still won’t open his eyes, despite the insistent buzz of his phone.
It’s quiet, comfortably so. Soft and easy. Castiel gently wipes away the quickly drying fluid, bending down to place small kisses on the clean skin. The wipe goes into the trash and Castiel grudgingly rolls out of bed to find clean clothing for them both. “ I can’t guarantee we’ll wake up alone.” He hands a pair of soft cotton pajama pants to Dean and pulls on a pair of flannel ones himself; both varying shades of gray.  He hesitates over his t-shirt drawer. The thought of sleeping shirtless with Dean is enticing, but the probability of having to deal with Jack at some point before morning has him choosing a washed thin tee. This one is covered in a green and black whirlpool design, a souvenir from a cross country road trip with Gabriel years ago.
“ Beautiful, ain’t she?” Dean is practically beaming with pride. “ ‘67 Chevy Impala, Tuxedo Black. A 327 V8 and a 4 barrel carburetor; was a bitch trying to find original parts for replacements. My dad bought her in ‘73 and I got her on my eighteenth birthday. Never even owned another car.”
“ On one hand, I feel like he should know the truth since I’m literally next door.” Cas tilts his head to the side, staring at his open hand as though he can physically see the option in his palm.
.” He makes the quotation marks with his fingers, because it’s a quirk he never managed to unlearn from childhood.
“ Why is she dressed like a bee?” Claire pushes off Dean’s legs and leans back against the middle cushion, still watching the video. “ Is it Halloween?”
But Dean is thinking about that moment while they were dancing, when Castiel dipped him and the heat in his eyes had sent shivers all over Dean’s body. But he doesn’t mention that because it was just a fluke. They were just playing. Instead he confesses to the first incident that set the precedent for their relationship so far. “ I mean, we’ve already kinda had a moment, a few months back. And Cas said he couldn’t. Not with, you know, all the stuff going on in his life.”
“ Lightning McQueen, Dad.” Claire corrects absently as she rummages through the book basket under the coffee table.
“ I have that weekend off, and Christmas Eve is Monday, Christmas Day is Tuesday, so the library is closed both days. “ Castiel squints as he tries to remember the exact dates. “ Rowena is back in town, and Benjamina said it was fine for me to take the rest of the week off. If last year is anything to go by, the library is not very busy around the actual holidays. Most gather their items beforehand, to have for traveling. There are no programs scheduled for the entire second half of December, either adult or children’s. So I have a very long weekend. But we’ll be here until the morning of Christmas Eve and come back the day after Christmas to assemble all the oversized toy sets I’m certain Gabriel has so thoughtfully gifted us.” He sighs, but it’s mostly for show. Gabriel’s lavish affection for the children is one of the many things Castiel loves about his older brother.
Well, he sorta wanted to do the stripping, but Dean isn’t going to complain now that he has all this beautiful bare skin in front of him. Tit for tat, Dean pulls off his own shirts and drops them on top of Cas’ sweatshirt crumpled on the cushion next to them. The little gasp from Cas turns Dean’s smile into a wicked grin. He playfully bites his lower lip and runs his hands slowly up and down his torso, hooded bedroom eyes turned on full blast. “ Like what you see?”
Like his boss, Zachariah Adler, who traipses into the work room with his usual smarmy smile, headed straight for Castiel’s desk. “ Good morning, Castiel! How was your time on the children’s desk? “
Castiel snickers, the accuracy hitting his funny bone just right to dispel a bit of his gloom. He waits for the window to fully load and begins identifying each photo laid out in the grid, each a still taken from the cameras. Indeed, his face is the first to show up, then Benjamina and Aaron and most of the staff. It doesn’t preclude staff, but he doesn’t want to think about a coworker doing this to him so he dismisses them for the time being. Frank is high up the list, but despite his kookiness, Castiel doesn’t believe him to be the culprit; Frank has bigger things on his mind than a passive aggressive terror campaign. There’s Chuck and Martin, again, people who have no motivation. A few other regulars that Castiel is only passingly familiar with, and-- “ Can you enlarge this one?”
They’re actually at Dean’s door five minutes early, Castiel carefully holding the towel wrapped pan of brownies as Claire keeps her hand tightly around Jack’s. She lets the little boy knock and Jack accompanies his fist pounding with a shouted, “ Din! Open dah!”
“ Memory foam.”
“ Sam?” Cas looks just as flabbergasted as Dean feels.
Inside Dean’s new apartment, not much has changed since Castiel saw it a year ago when Cain was showing him around. There’d been a fresh coat of paint then, the smell still strong. The colors haven’t dulled, the walls varying shades of cool gray, the trim bright white. The original hardwood flooring is stained a dark walnut, in contrast to the newer composite wood planks in ash on Castiel’s side of the house. It sits over the garage with an addition extended toward the back that contains the kitchen and main entry.
Dean is nothing but understanding, nodding enthusiastically, backing up slowly toward the driver side door. “ Yeah, yeah. I should get to bed, too.” He glances back at his darkened windows.
Dean is already falling apart. He’s fucking shaking at Cas’ husky voice, his confident tone, his intimate description. The last flicker of fear is torched by lust and affection flaring through his body, lighting him up like a damn candle. Dean has an immediate image of the pink sparkling candle from his tart and he chokes on a giggle.
“ Sam, don't. ” Jess gives her husband a warning look.
Dean looks embarrassed, but presses on. “ Sam says it was my guardian angel. He gripped me so tight he left bruises on my arm and when I got out of the hospital and worked through some…
“ Becky’s enthusiasm is great, but yeah, her focus on court trysts is kinda distracting, to be honest” Charlie tucks a loose strand of long red hair back into her braided crown- her only concession to her position as queen of Moondoor- and she’s chosen her woodland gear instead of her queenly regalia. It’s only a half day for her, the teen outreach complete once she puts away her LARP gear and gets the report started. Charlie drops the tote of foam swords on top of the costume bin. “ But, it takes all kinds and as long as she doesn’t actually start stalking the other players I try to give her some leeway.” She plops down into her desk chair and snags a post-it note from the rainbow stack next to her Hermione bobblehead. “ I’m marking my numbers, but I’m not starting the report because I saw Zachariah heading out and you and I both know he won’t be back today. So screw him.”
“ I can understand that.” Sam nods. “ We’ll just make sure to text you ahead of time.”
Castiel and Gabriel have a few drinks, talk about Dean, and attempt to assemble, prep, and wrap a million presents. On Christmas Eve.
And deep down, Castiel knows he only attempted the dramatic hairstyle because he had wanted to impress Dean. With his daughter’s hair. Dear Lord in Heaven, save him from his own idiocy. At the very least, he hadn’t tried to dress the children any nicer than they would for school. Claire is wearing her favorite red Baymax t-shirt and denim capris. Jack’s t-shirt tops dark khaki cargo shorts; the pockets already full of Legos. Normal playtime attire. Castiel glances down at his own outfit, again wondering if perhaps it’s too much for a casual cookout. But his closet has very little that isn’t work appropriate. So he’d chosen his good jeans that are only slightly frayed at the hems and found a gray short-sleeve button-down, faint feather print scattered across the darker background. It’ll do.
Jack attempts to fling himself through the open window, shouting, “ Dife! Dife!”
“ Alright, then. Get yourself in bed. I’ll be there shortly.”
“ Yoo baby, Din?” Jack is still frowning, one hand braced against the back of the couch as he kneels beside Dean. Keeping his eye on the usurper.
Many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, and comments! Y'all are awesome!!!
“ Otherwise, just ask your Dad to give me a call, alright?” Dean leans around Cas and places the Tile on the window sill. “ We’ll leave it right there, where you can reach it.” When he settles back on his heels he finds two varying expressions of gratitude from the Novaks: Claire’s open and practically awed, Cas’ softer and accompanied by the sweetest smile Dean’s ever seen. He doesn’t have long to appreciate it because Claire’s wild hair is suddenly filling his vision, her little arms nearly strangling him around the neck as she hugs him.
Sam and Jess both stare at him, matching looks of incredulity etched across their expressions. Then Jess turns to Sam. “ He really doesn’t know, does he?”
Dean is just coming down the stairs to help Jess pick through what’s left on the trailer when he’s stopped by a girlish exclamation.
But he is worried. This could be just a random stalker, just coincidence. But if it goes as far as Castiel believes it does, it will lead to a very dangerous man and he does not want to expose his friend to that kind of trouble. “ Still, be careful. For my own peace of mind.”
“ Less chaotic than usual, surprisingly.” Dean steps up into the kitchen, easing one tote onto the table and the covered slow cooker onto the counter top. “ I kept it to the basics and just made a whole bunch so they would have plenty of leftovers to take home. Make it easy on them. Alice, Jess’ mom, made her amazing pumpkin pie that she won’t give me the recipe for. Alex slept through most of the day, but I got some good pics the few times he graced us with consciousness.”
What should he do?
Dean has no real sense of how much time has passed when he is jolted out of his own orgasmic chase by a sudden tightening around his cock. Cas squeezes his dick once, a tad too hard, then releases it to put both hands on Dean’s thighs. Not driving the action, not moving Dean, simply holding on as his thrusts become more erractic. Dean doesn’t mind delaying his own orgasm because watching Cas get off is going to be nearly as satisfying.  The older man bucks up into Dean’s lotion slick fist, frantic, and Dean does his best to keep up the strong steady rhythm that is obviously Cas’ ticket to bliss.
Complying swiftly, after a smile and kiss, Castiel leans back onto his heels again. He undoes his top button. Dean follows, sitting up and bringing his other hand to Castiel’s zipper. Castiel stares at Dean’s bent head as he slowly pulls the zip down, metal teeth disconnecting with a low buzz. It doesn’t take long to divest himself of his jeans and boxer briefs, though there is some awkward shuffling and he almost falls over trying to get his last foot out of the leg hole. But soon enough, he’s left in nothing but a smile. Dean smiles back and Castiel lowers them both back down to the comforter and pillows.
In fact, Dean is asleep on the couch, head tilted back against the cushion, snoring softly.
“ Nothing age-inappropriate, but as always, I defer to your father’s excellent judgement.” Cain stands, tilting his head toward Castiel, straight faced serious expression barely betrayed by the upward quirk of his mouth.
Castiel doesn’t have a chance to find out what deep philosophical discussion the two are involved in because Claire is taking the afghan from him as she locks up behind them. “ Uncle Gabe said you and Dean had a lot to talk about. What were you talking about all night?”
There’s a lot of heavy petting, hurried make-out sessions while the kids are occupied with Netflix. They even manage to get a hand down each other’s pants for some quick groping before Jack needs to use the bathroom they’re hiding in and they unlock the door with their shirt tails pulled low.
Cain smirks. “ Now you’re just being an ass. Eat your dinner.”
Dean keeps his attention spread over the area, still wary of suspects possibly hiding nearby, as he ducks through the opening and grabs the handles of the bag, lifting it as carefully as he can over the spikes. It’s not heavy at all, which surprises him, and a familiar whiff of something hits his nose in the cold air. “ Smells like… a food court?” He frowns at Cain as he comes back around the gate, listening to it sliding back into place with a loud clang. “ Orange chicken and french fries.”
“ Dean’d make a good dad.” Claire interrupts her own humming to make her observation.
But Castiel can see the blush again rising in the high cheekbones, notices the embarrassed quirk of those full lips. He sits up, stretching slowly to ease the kinks in his back and shoulders. Dean’s gaze remains steady as he wiggles out of the damp panties, holding them awkwardly until Castiel takes them and tosses them, along with his own boxers, into the hamper in the corner. Another baby wipe because he’s come to love the convenience of them and keeps a pack in practically every room now.
Already nervous about Jack’s unidentified illness, Castiel had been even more anxious when the nurse at the front desk had told him that Dr. Moseley was completely booked and wouldn’t be able to see Jack today. The woman has been a balm to Castiel's frayed parental nerves since moving here and taking on full parenting responsibilities. And as much as he trusts the other practitioners, there’s just something so reassuring about Dr. Moseley’s presence that Castiel had felt in dire need of this morning.
“ And Aunt Meg is coming for dinner.” Claire chimes in.
Dean turns his head to the side, leaning forward to get a better look at the faded damage beneath his fingers.
Castiel checks his work email and decides which of his projects to work on until his desk shift in half an hour as he waits for Ambriel’s reply.
That seems to work. Sam promptly moves out of his way, broad grin back on his stupid little brother face. “ Good luck, man.”
Castiel grins into the dark. Yes, he knows it’s there because he can feel the heat of Dean’s cheek flare up against his palm. It’s a simple thing, but it works wonders on his heart and unashamedly strokes his ego. He enjoys it for a few long moments before whispering, “ We’re both here. Together.”
As his children bombard Dean, Castiel selects a photo of Sam, Jess, and Alex. A photo of Alex deadpanning the camera. And both photos of Dean and Alex. He texts them to his phone and carefully puts Dean’s phone onto the kitchen table for him to retrieve once he’s freed himself from the krakens - going by Claire’s instructions to Jack involving tentacles- attached to his legs.
Cain nods, and replies in his dry tone, “ I believe it was the only thing keeping you from falling off the car.”
They finally decide the stone steps are less likely to end up with property damage and begin taking Dean’s bed and dresser. Jess starts unloading lighter boxes into the garage, while the men curse and sweat and eventually get Dean’s very limited furniture into the house.
Nurse Clif pats his shoulder, bending down to look at Alex. Again, Alex is mildly interested. “ He’s been pretty laid back here. I hope that keeps up at home.” The big man sends his smile toward Sam and Jess, chuckling at they struggle to swallow their mouthfuls to answer. He waves a dismissive hand, the universal
Dean freezes. His first instinct is to pull away, prevent himself from fucking it up worse. But that’s his insecurities talking, so Dean swallows that impulse down and goes with his next urge. He slowly flattens his hand against the warm skin, covering the thin lines sprawled across the back of Cas’ upper arm, and ducks his head to rest his lips against the shell of Cas’ ear. “ Sorry,” Dean breathes.
Dean chuckles, still watching Alex as he puckers his little lips beseechingly. “ You don’t have to whisper, buddy. He’s excited to see you, too. Aren’t you?” Dean grins at Alex’s hard stare, wiping up the strands of spilt milk and saliva, then looks up as his visitors circle around his couch. “ Hey, Jack.”
We’d be delighted, thank you. Let’s see, having dinner at your place, watching you drool over some atrocious 80s film. Makes me hot.
Meg’s tone is almost sympathetic when she asks,” Then what are you actually afraid of happening here?”
“ Dean, in my experience, dealing with children gives one an automatic right to whine at any given time.” Castiel tilts his head slightly, staring at the ceiling in thought. “ Well, maybe not in front of aforementioned children, but any other time is fine.” He glances back at Dean, who does not look entirely convinced, and reaches up to rub his palm against the stiff bristles on Dean’s jaw. “ Hey.” He smiles when Dean lets go of his hair and drops his hand to cover Castiel’s. “ Whining is fine, we all do it. What matters is that you don’t let it keep you from doing what you need to do. Like right now, you should take advantage of our remaining ten minutes and take a shower in the comfort of your own home before being subjected to Gabriel’s overly smug face while I take a shower at mine.”
The generous spiel does get a tired smile from Castiel, his big hand patting the toddler’s back. “ Tissue would be appreciated. I know his nose is sore with all the wiping.”
And there it is. Cas yanks Dean to him, hands dragging around to his back, fingers digging into Dean’s shoulder blades as his hips stutter and stall and his entire frame draws up tight. A long drawn out moment, a nearly pained moan, then Cas slumps back onto the couch, pulling Dean with him.
“ Thank you, Dean,” she whispers in his ear, ever mindful of her sleeping brother.
“ Uh huh.” Dean counters.
And he hears Alex fussing in his seat.
So, I'm posting this "early" for two reasons. 1) I am still overly emotional about this most recent episode and need some happy. 2) I wanted something up in case I don't feel capable of posting on my scheduled Sunday.
But, right now he has another five hours of work; patrons to help and coworkers to deal with.
In contrast, Castiel’s side is rather plain. Over the past year, he has gathered his own set of shelves and bins, and a filing system. His desk is butted head to head with Garth’s, a piece of plywood wedged between to give them a bit of privacy; the top edge, at eye level, is carved into the silhouette of a Bavarian forest, and painted a muted dark green; the piece leftover from a long ago production of puppet-led fairy tales. It makes a nice backdrop to his desktop and multilayer paper trays. And a single framed photo of himself with Claire and Jack, taken by Garth at the library’s Harry Potter Yule Ball celebration. Claire’s smile is a bit subdued, her Gryffindor robes heavily sprinkled with glitter from an art project. Jack’s bright gummy grin shines out of his tiny Hufflepuff robes. Castiel had worn a Ravenclaw tie, in deference to the occasion, his own smile somewhere between the children’s.
“ I know. You borrowed one of Claire’s dolls for it.” Dean slides into the back seat and carefully divests Alex of his blankets until only the footie onesie is left. This one is blue with sea otters playing across it. “ And you diapered it, too. Pretty good for a newbie.”
“ The Rutherford County emergency services have the code. “ Dean waits for the gate to open completely before pulling through at a good clip, and waits for the closing process to complete before pulling away.  “ I’ll ask Cain about giving it to y’all, but I have a feeling he’d prefer not to spread it around too much.” He tilts an apologetic look at Sam. “ I can buzz you in though. It’s the bottom righthand button on the security pad.”
It seems too much and, sadly, not nearly enough.
And another message from
“ Yeah, Cassie. What did you talk about all night?” Gabriel saunters over to the little group, drying his hands on a dish towel, comically wide-eyed and innocent.
Dean makes a big production over what part of the tart he wants for himself, hemming and hawing until Jack points out, “ Iss allda same, Din.” Dean laughs so hard his eyes are watering, Cas is reduced to snorts. Finally, Dean gets himself back together and divides the dessert between the four small plates Cas provides. Claire scoops some vanilla bean ice cream onto each and Cas passes them around.
Now that Castiel is closer and the garage light is bright overhead, he can see the finer details in the non-Disney inspired tattoo. The large handprint curves around Dean’s upper arm, near the shoulder, in a simple thin outline. But within each section of the anatomically accurate shape, are more thin red lines nesting inside each other, growing smaller and smaller, creating a topographical effect.
They reach the last photograph, a full 8x10 in a paper frame, very obviously child-crafted. It’s a close up of Amelia and Kelly, hugging each other tightly, laughing smiles on their faces. Below the paper frame, in the wide margin of the album page, is a simple sentence in silver Sharpie on the black paper, printed in all caps.
It’s been two hours since the children were abed, and seventy-five minutes since Castiel checked to make certain they were both fully asleep in his brother’s guest room. Castiel had given Gabriel an extra tight hug after seeing the decorations the man had put up just for the children. Gabriel had turned his guest room into a winter candyland complete with gingerbread house bed canopy, cookie printed sleeping bags,  six foot tall plastic candy canes flanking the doorway, and dozens of smaller atmospheric pieces that completely transformed the normally gaudy room. He’d even replaced the semi-nude paintings with white tinsel wreaths covered in frosted plastic candy (normally they were just shoved into the utility closet, the walls left blank when the children visited.) Claire and Jack had to be dragged away for dinner and everyone had ended up piled together on the queen sized bed afterward to watch
Much tamer than my household. Gabriel is a bad influence.
, Dean has a lap full of Jack. He’d barely even noticed how long the toddler has been solidly situated in his lap, the little head resting against his chest as Jack’s hands randomly pat and scratch at Dean’s jeans. Dean tries to lean down enough to see if Jack’s eyes are actually closed, but can’t quite make it. So instead he gently jiggles his legs, lightly bouncing his thighs. “ You asleep?”
Dear God, this is Shakespearean levels of coincidence! Castiel keys open the bottom lock on the kitchen door and rushes inside, not quite slamming the door shut. Claire looks up from the TV, frowning, but says nothing. Castiel smiles at her and she returns her attention to the Planet Earth episode currently playing.
on Netflix and Claire comes jogging back into the den in her
“ No, no.” Dean is quick to sit up, shaking his head in denial. “ Just really comfortable.”  He squeezes Castiel’s hand and lifts it to his mouth, pressing a firm smacking kiss on his knuckles. “ And your singing was practically hypnotizing.”
“ Thank goodness,” Castiel breathes a sigh of relief. He remembers ear infections from his own childhood. They're definitely misery makers on their own, but flu would have compounded that misery tenfold. He places Jack on the exam bench, checking the toddler’s hold on the ice pop. Jack doesn't seem very interested in it, but he hasn't thrown it across the room so Castiel considers it a win. He begins packing up as he listens to Dean across the room.
“ Hmm?” Cas murmurs but doesn’t stop nuzzling. In fact he licks along the crease of Dean’s arm and nibbles where it joins the shoulder.
Castiel tilts his head to the side, mildly surprised by Dean’s curiosity in the subject. Most people either already know, or simply don’t care to ask. “ Essentially. I’ve never really been interested in having romantic relationships. And I was close friends with Claire’s mother for years before we began seeing each other as more than friends. Until recently, she was the only one I’d ever really considered… “ He trails off when he realizes what he just said. Castiel clears his throat, attempts to cover the lapse in his brain-to-mouth filter. “  I believe sexuality is fluid and I don’t really label myself, but it is nice to have some general definitions when people are open to being informed.”
“ Hello, Dr. Winchester.” The man’s voice is deep and gravelly; either naturally or due to the fatigue and stress common to new parents, Dean isn’t certain, but he happily listens as the man continues, “ This is Jack.”
Cas catches him before he makes a full escape. “
Castiel stares at the message over Dean’s head and sighs heavily. “ I love my brother, but I may kill him.”
“ Don’t you think that’s odd?” Castiel questions roughly.
“ Brrrrrr, Daddy!”
“ She’ll be extorting all sorts of stuff from me.” Dean snorts. “ She’s already eaten half a jar of that lavender honey. Poured it all over a slab of bread and had it after she’d eaten dinner
“ Stay the night.”  Cas disentagles their fingers and smooths his palms along the planes of Dean’s chest, the softness of his belly. Back up to tenderly cradle Dean’s face.  Intense blue gaze never wavering from green. “ I want you so goddamn much, Dean. Wanted you for so long and we tried to take it slow and be sensible with our schedules but I don’t give a shit about sensible anymore and you’re
Castiel hums in thought, but shakes his head. “ It is very him, but I know he hasn’t been on the premises at the correct times; he’s almost never here past lunchtime.”
Castiel’s mouth drops open, gaping at the sheer volume of vomit spewing from Jack’s mouth. The toddler didn’t even have that much to eat for breakfast. And of course it’s all aimed directly at Dean who’s holding out his scrub shirt to catch it instead of backing away to let it pour onto the floor and make a bigger mess. Castiel can already see the telltale signs of repressed gagging on Dean’s face and not that Castiel had any actual thoughts of pursuing whatever weird thing that seems to be sparking between them, he certainly can’t see himself doing so after this mortifying incident.
Not much changes after their New Year’s confession. They go to work, the kids go to school and daycare. They have dinner together most nights and alternate kitchens. They hang out on the weekends. Dean goes to Clinic Karaoke. Cas has dinner with Meg. Logistically, Dean could be spending every night in Cas’ bed, or Cas in Dean’s bed if they have a sitter. But they’d both agreed that routine was too important to the kids to disrupt, that it would be a big change for them, as well, and in their misguided attempts at easing the kids into a new status quo, they came to the arrangement of Dean sleeping over Saturday nights so they can all spend lazy Sundays together.
“ Of course, I certainly don’t blame you, Castiel.” Cain wrinkles his brow, sincerity marking his expression. “ This is a favor for an old friend, but I wouldn’t even have suggested it if I didn’t completely trust the person in question.” His fingers rub lightly around the rim of the cup. “ I’ve known him for some years and he is, quite honestly, one of the best men I’ve ever known in my life.” His blue eyes level Castiel head-on.
,  if you’re physically making air quotes.”
u had yur heat on in October, i had all my window sopen! my place is like 10 degrees cooler thna yours!
“ I’d tell you the kids are okay and you can sit down and relax, but I don’t think you’d be into it.” Dean smiles sympathetically, eyes soft and teasing.
Dean rolls forward on the stool until his knee is almost touching the other man’s, leaning in to slip a finger into Jack’s loose grasp. “ Hey, buddy.” The big blue eyes crack open. Dean smiles and pulls the otoscope from the wall bracket, slipping the hygienic sheath into place. “ Let’s check out your ears, make sure nothing’s going on there.” It wouldn’t be the first time an ear infection was mistaken for a stomach bug or bad allergies. Dean carefully inserts the tip into Jack’s closest ear, the toddler not resisting in the least. There’s some redness. “ Not too bad. How ‘bout the other?” He glances up at Castiel who gets the hint and expertly shifts Jack to his other side, exposing his left ear. Dean nods in thanks and quickly performs his inspection. Oh yeah. There’s the main problem. Swollen and cherry red. Once the otoscope is free, Jack reaches up and scrubs half-heartedly at his ear. Dean rubs it gently with his thumb, then moves on to the boy’s raw little button nose. Might as well cover all his bases. “ Real quick.” He ducks down to view the inside of the tiny space and indeed there’s some more redness and swelling. Which could just be from the sneezing and sinus drainage. Jack rubs his nose against the tie again. “ Has he been exposed to anyone with the flu in the past week, that you know of?”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “ Jack, say
Castiel looks up to see Dean’s mouth open in a silent scream, eyes squeezed shut, before he slumps boneless onto the bed.
It’s the final straw of an emotional evening.
Cain hesitates for the barest second, averting his eyes, before he contradicts Dean’s suspicions. “ I did, yes.” A hint of what Dean can only identify as shame washes over Cain’s features. “ I shouldn’t have, but…” That clear blue gaze comes back to meet Dean’s eyes. “ But in that moment, you were warm and soft and you wanted me. And I’d wanted you for quite a while. Definitely not my proudest moment.”
Alex mewls softly. Dean accepts it as a yes. “ Awesome. I’m gonna be the coolest uncle you’ve ever had, big man.”
“ Very. I think we should go get some hot chocolate from Starbucks before our movie, to wake me up. What do you think?”
“ No, just some errands.” Dean doesn’t know why he doesn’t just tell Sam the truth. Maybe because he was never too forthcoming about Cain when they were together and now he doesn’t want to deal with this whole protective little brother schtick or talk about his feelings when there’s really nothing to talk about until after he sees how this little catch-up is going to go.
Castiel  pokes Gabriel hard in the side. “ Be nice,” he warns. Gabriel throws his hands up in surrender and goes about helping the others set the table for New Year’s breakfast. Castiel watches a moment longer, just basking in the familial joy before making his way to his bedroom.
Many thanks to everyone who reads, kudos, and comments!!!
“ Thatta boy!” Dean praises. He reaches behind him and grabs the plastic Kroger bag neatly folded on top of the boxes. Sam groans and Jess laughs the moment Dean pulls out the ultra soft flannel blanket and unfolds it for them, distracting them from making fun of his freshly shaven face.
Yes, this is good. He can do this.
Castiel takes his own glass and sits opposite, one ear listening closely to the goings on in the bathroom. “ Not at all. Jack went down easier than usual and Claire technically has another half hour.” He sips his tea and pauses at the toilet flush. The sound of running water begins and Castiel gives his attention back to Cain. “ So, in your text this morning, you wanted to ask me about someone moving into the apartment.”  It’s been at the back of his mind all day, mulling it over. “ I have to admit that I’m hesitant.”
The desk phone rings, shaking Castiel from his thoughts and nearly causing him to knock his waterbottle over. He rights the bottle and takes a breath before answering the phone, scribbling out a reminder on a nearby post-it note to seek out Charlie on Monday.
“ What?” Charlie elbows Benjamina back, but turns around, catching sight of Castiel in the doorway. “ Oh! Sorry, Cas. What’s up?”
“ Did you at least give him a thank you blow job?”
“ Uh,” Dean stalls. He’s actually really good at interpreting pre-English, but his only guess doesn’t make much sense. “ Got grape pop?”
Conversation halts again as everyone’s gaze lands on the partially exposed tattoo on Dean’s left upper arm. Castiel remembers seeing the ink before at the pediatrics office, but he hadn’t had long enough or a close enough look to identify any details.  He watches with intense curiosity as Dean pushes the sleeve up to his shoulder with the opposite hand.
through the years. Her age is irrelevant. And Garth is more than qualified to complete her duties in her stead. “ He takes great joy in watching Zachariah’s smile slowly fall into a disgruntled thin lipped line.” And I am more than happy to assist him when needed.”
“ Shut up. It’s a dungeon whenever we don’t have guests.” Meg throws a pillow at him then launches into a sordid tale of whips and chains that makes Castiel cringe and chuckle in equal measure...
“ Really,” Castiel repeats, following her across the room. He realizes where she’s headed and softly asks, “ Could we do this at your desk?”
“ I’ll get the kids ready for bed, but I’ll keep ‘em up until you get back if you want.”
“ I will. Promise.” Charlie bumps his shoulder and goes back to her computer with renewed vigor. Within thirty seconds she has each timestamp in her system and the face recognition set to the mystery brunette. “ We’ve got a few minutes before it spits out the results, sooooo… “ She raises both brows in expectation and waits.
Some New Year's happenings.
“ And neither do you,” Castiel finishes for him. He pockets his phone and steps around Dean, heading back to the kitchen to heat up the rest of the lasagna the kids had for their dinner. Amazingly, his phone does not immediately ring again. “ I can make a salad, as well.” He looks over his shoulder to where Dean is walking behind him, finishing the cookie in his mouth.
He leads his daughter back into the living room and happily squeezes between the two children on the couch. While their attention is latched onto the scene of a whale shark meandering through the fathomless blue ocean, Castiel shoots a text to Meg, asking her to call him on her break. He needs to talk to someone about this whole Dean mess and get a mostly unbiased opinion.
Okay, so he normally sleeps in pretty late on his days off, but that’s no reason for the suspicious tone. Dean rolls his eyes and gently guides the woman into the bathroom. “ Because. Now do your preggo stuff and let me get by.”
Castiel rubs his eyes, then takes in a calming deep breath to tackle the sudden burst of voices and alarm beeps coming from the kitchen.
Once they'd both managed to get over themselves (and Castiel still wonders at Dean’s initial flummoxing) it goes much smoother and Castiel is assured by the other man’s gentle bedside manner and dedication to his job. It is very obvious to Castiel that Dean loves his work and cares very much about his patients.
“ I think your brother’s filming us,” Dean whispers into Cas’ ear. He’s not certain whether to be amused or angry.
It’s a short drive to the old fishing cabin near the lake shore and Cain is also standing outside, waiting for Castiel. Breath clouding around his head like a dragon. Castiel approaches the porch steps, feeling tired and achey as he clambers up. The cold and the anxiety are taking their toll.
“ Can we bring Kool-Aid? It’s so freaking hot!” Claire exclaims.
Dean gives Cas a questioning raise of his brows, gaze flickering from his eyes to his mouth and back again. The pause goes on so long that Dean is about to back up and reassess the situation, but Cas suddenly goes for it and Dean is too busy re-adjusting the angle of his head to doubt the mutual mood.
“ Come in, Castiel.”
Cain had said it belonged to Colette’s parents, that his late wife had inherited it upon their death and he upon hers. Dean is certain they must’ve had some money back in the day because the surrounding hundred or so acres of lakefront property also came through Colette’s family and he’s been told this is only one of several of the buildings on the property.
Castiel smiles softly as sleep pulls him under, warm and safe in Dean’s arms.
“ … Were you watching the security cameras again?” Castiel frowns.
It can’t be anything other than intentional.
“ Not just Jack.”
As the minutes slowly tick by, Dean shifts several times, seemingly unable to get comfortable.
“  I know, sweetheart. But I’m right here, and Mr. Cain is just a phone call away and Dean is still here, in the den. We won’t let anything bad happen to you, I promise.”
Dean grins at the trio in front of him now, Claire and Jack bookending Cas who is holding a fresh-from-the-oven rustic looking apple tart with a single candle sparkling in the middle.  He laughs at Jack’s wide eyed gaze following the candle flame as Cas sets the dessert on the table in front of him. “ Y’all are awesome, thank you!” He blows out the pink candle to massive applause, and takes a moment to study the pastry masterpiece. It’s roughly a circle, the size of a dinner plate, the crust unevenly crimped up around the edges to contain the pile of unevenly sliced apples spiraling on top. It reminds Dean of the Play-Doh treats he would help Sammy make when they were little. It is, however, a magnificently delicious golden brown all over. “ It’s beautiful ! And smells amazing!”
Cain exits the driver’s side and approaches the control box. He unlocks the metal door and punches in the code. The gears rumble, there’s a tiny squeak of metal, then the gate slowly slides to the left.
Cas insists that Dean pick tonight’s movie since Claire decided on last night’s and Jack chose the night before. After much overly dramatic deliberation and sidelong glances at Claire, he chooses
Dean shivers, visibly, at his tone. Castiel files that image away for later, along with the knowledge that Dean seems to like Castiel’s more
Saturday
I remembered to post on Sunday!!!!   So, I've been extra scattered lately because I have been prepping for surgery next week. Which means, one of two things; I will either be exceedingly bored and get lots of extra writing done over the next few weeks in recovery, or I will be miserable and remain as unconscious as possible until I'm forced back to work :)  I'm hoping for the former *fingers crossed*
Jack needs to pee.
“ Hey, Sam and Jess really appreciated the package you got them.” Dean knows his brother and sister-in-law have sent Cas thank you texts, but he’d like to re-enforce the gratitude for the tote bag of Jack’s barely used hand-me downs and two packs of gourmet coffee for the new parents. “ I’ve got a few outfits here, for emergency changes. Cute as hell.”
“ Daddy’s coming, Jack! Rawr!”
“ I’m not suggesting that. I’m suggesting that you both seem to want this relationship, but you’re both too stubborn and self-sacrificing to take the blatant opportunity for happiness. And I am honestly tired of watching you two dance around each other.”
“ Are those excuses? You’re not interested in single parents or someone who just happens to have things going on in their lives they have no control over?” ”
Okay, a bit weird to mention, but logical. Dean nods and knocks back the rest of his coffee. “ I’ll talk to Sam and Jess about it today.”
Happiness.
Dean watches as she pulls an honest-to-god photo album from the top shelf and brings it back to the couch. She sits on the other side of Dean, laying the heavy bound book into his lap.  “ It’s too heavy for Jack to hold, so a grown-up’s gotta hold it,” she explains.
“ Don’t be. And you’re not.” Castiel moves closer, circling Dean’s wrists and gently tugging until the hands fall away and he has full view of Dean’s damp face, mouth twisted into rueful smile. “ You care about them, about their opinion.”  Dean nods. Castiel slides his arms around Dean’s waist, pulling them closer, enjoying the weight of Dean’s arms across his shoulders as the younger man hides his face in the crook of Castiel’s neck and shoulder. “ I was a bit choked up myself, honestly. Despite Gabriel’s best efforts to ruin the moment.”
There’s a long pause and Dean can see Cain taking his time to correctly word his answer. It comes out evenly, despite the slight hint of uncertainty in Cain’s gaze. “ I didn’t think it was appropriate, honestly. I wasn’t sure how much he knew about our relationship. Or if you wanted the reminder.”
Minor age/timeline correction: Jack is about 2 ½ years old, turning 3 in 2019.
“ I know number one is this whole thing with Nick Adler; the stalking, the threats, etcetera. But since Dean-o’s been hanging around more, even spending the night, couch notwithstanding, you’ve been happier. More relaxed. Not jumping at every shadow like you have been for the past couple of years.”
“ No pop?” Jack puts a hand on Dean’s bearded cheek, puppy eyes in full effect.
Castiel swallows down a little rush of guilt. “ He did, once. In September, not long after he moved in.”
Castiel folds his thumb over the digits, stroking lightly. “ As long as you don’t ask if I’ve read any good books lately, we can talk about anything.”
The stalking is also heavily implied, though not outright written down. Making it harder for Castiel to prove that someone has indeed been watching him.
“ Dean, Bobby called me.”Sam’s voice over the line is even, tinged with mild irritation. “ And he wants me to run this by you first.”
They re-enter the kitchen and Castiel begins organizing the many bowls and covered platters on the biggest countertop. Blatantly avoiding Cain. Cain approaches the dining table and removes the foil from a pan of baked beans. “ Since you obviously don’t want to talk about the attractive elephant in the next room, let’s talk about something less pleasant. Like work. ”
Jack is freakin’ ecstatic. He puts both tiny hands on the big wheel and turns it as far as his short arms are capable. Which isn’t much, especially without power steering.
Okay, that’s actually ringing a tiny bell. Mostly due to the gruesome details.“ Wasn't it that douchey trust fund psycho? I thought they arrested him.” Dean vaguely remembers seeing a few headlines on his social media sites. He remembers Sam hadn’t been on the case, but one of his used-to-be colleagues at the firm is defending the accused.
Dean nods, letting Jack out of the headlock and helping him lean back against the couch arm. “ Bobby and Ellen will come down for the last week of December to visit. So this year it’ll be after Christmas, but they’ll be here the week of New Year’s so we’ll do Christmas then. We all go over to Sam and Jess’. Jo, Ellen’s daughter, and her boyfriend, Victor, should be there since they both work Christmas Eve shifts. Might be a bit less alcohol-soaked with Alex around, but we have a good time.”
Always.
But Castiel doesn’t miss the little cough, or the grin on the younger man’s face as he turns toward his charge. And now Jack is tugging on his pants leg and Claire is waiting semi-patiently nearby for her turn and Dean is taking Alex off for a diaper change and Castiel lets the lingering heat and tension bleed from his muscles as he drops to his knees to be on level with his toddler.
He almost laughs at Dean’s joking tone, but it suddenly occurs to Castiel that perhaps Dean has never had someone to openly discuss his sexuality with.
Dean frowns. “ What? Why?” He turns his curious frown onto Cas who is still on the couch behind them.
“ Oh. Oh!” Dean laughs, too, bouncing Jack up and down in his arms to hear him squeal in delight. “ Well, I’d rather be associated with ice pops than shots. Sorry, buddy. I don’t have any pops right now. Maybe next time.”
Dean brightens his smile and gestures for the man- Castiel- to sit. “ Awesome name. An angel, isn’t it?”
“ Yep, I got Dory and,” Dean traces a finger under the simply inked words trailing behind the bright blue angelfish in the wavy shape of motion lines. “ What’s Dory’s favorite thing to say?”
The Thanksgiving day photos come up and both kids are delighted at the new pics. Claire again points out the people and Jack repeats the best he can. Dean gives them details about his holiday and gets a thorough retelling of the Novak-Kline holiday experience. “ That sounds pretty awesome.” Dean grins at them, closing his camera app once they both get their fill of the photos.
“ Not drunk.” And Castiel isn’t. Barely even tipsy. Not even as tipsy as he’d gotten at Thanksgiving. That had been a bottle of red wine and four Disaronna sours, and two whiskeys neat tipsy. This is just four whiskeys neat
“ Daddy is silly, isn’t he?” Dean smiles at the little boy. Then he remembers that the kids have never seen the photo he keeps in his wallet. “ You want to see a picture of my mom and dad?” Claire readily agrees and Jack seems open to it, so Dean reaches into his back pocket and pulls out his ratty old wallet. The brown leather is cracked and one fold is hanging on by a thread. He should replace it, but it was a thirtieth birthday gift from Bobby and Dean can’t let it go. The kids stare in rapt attention as Dean pulls a yellowed photo from behind his driver’s license. He has several larger photos that he eventually managed to have framed nicely, collage style, and is hanging on the wall in his living room. But this small one he’d kept in his wallet. Alongside an even smaller photo of Sam in his high school cap and gown. “ This is my mom and dad. And that’s me.” He points to the sandy haired toddler in his mother’s arms. A younger, kinder John Winchester hugging them both. Dean holds onto the fading photo just as tightly as he does the faint memories of those better times. Because it hadn’t always been dark and hopeless and Dean needs to remember that, for his own sanity.
“ Waiting is the worst part?” Castiel gives a rueful smile, then exhales and sags under the weight of worry and the platter of assorted cranberry sauces. He steps closer to Cain, though they’ve both been keeping their voices low beneath the happy chatter coming from the den around the corner. “ Honestly, it really is. Nicholas is not going to give up on getting Jack. Even if he is actually convicted and put away, he’ll continue to use his influence on his followers. Sometimes I doubt we’ll ever be left in peace. ” Castiel stares down at the blobs of deep purple-red jelly and feels a sudden wave of sickness. A dreadful certainty. “ I wish I’d killed him that day,” he whispers hoarsely. “ I tried, you know. Not just in self defense or even to protect the children. But in a rage, an absolute wave of fury at what he’d done to Amelia and Kelly. Right before the police intervened, I had gotten the hammer from him, had gotten him on the ground, and I was going to…” Castiel trails off, the memory still overwhelming even after nearly two years.
And here Dean is, actively asking Castiel about things he probably doesn’t feel very comfortable discussing with most people. Not from a lack of trust, but because Dean appears, to Castiel, to be a rather private person who’d rather not talk about his sexual proclivities with his younger brother or coworkers.
Blue eyes and hot air and pain and, “ I’ve got you. I’ve got you.”
What's in the box?!
Castiel sighs heavily, head dropping into his open hands, elbows resting on his knees in defeat. “ Why is everyone so interested in my love life?”
Castiel nods, mesmerized by Dean’s reflection in the windows. He tries to keep his focus there.“ You’ve taken very good care of her.”
Claire wants to know if you eat black-eyed peas and greens on New Year’s Day.
“ All good, “ Castiel replies, returning the slow smile spreading across the younger man’s face. “ Are you tired?” He’ll be a bit disappointed if the answer is yes, but Castiel is happy to get Dean into his bed anyway that he can.
Cain smiles. “ Thank you. So do you… That’ll be thirty-five even.”
“ Well, what did Uncle Gabe say we were talking about?”  Castiel can play this game, too. The satisfaction he gets from Gabriel’s genuine flash of fear makes getting out of bed worth it.
Dean knows the location. Its near the I-40 ramp in a weirdly well off area that Sam has mentioned has been growing rapidly over the past couple of decades. Dean’s hit it up a few times on his way to the interstate. He types back an affirmative reply and only hits send after deleting a smiley face emoji quickly followed by a coffee emoji and finally settles on a colon and right parentheses. Like the dork he is.
Dean glances at Cain, then back to the bag. “ Open the gate or pull it over?”
*dickin
“ Remember what?” Dean reaches out for a muffin with his free hand, carefully placing the candle to the side of his bowl. The first bite causes a moan deep in his throat. Just the right amount of sweetness in the butter melted on top. It distracts him from the candle for a few seconds.
Aaron snorts a laugh. “ Yeah, actually I do. Can I use Karl-E on this?” He points to the desktop that isn’t nearly as busy as Charlie’s laptop. Charlie nods and moves back to give Aaron room to pull up the library back-of-house program and the public computer system. “ She’s been in here pretty regularly for the last year or so, usually on the computers, but sometimes I see her in the reading corner with a stack of cookbooks and her phone.” He types in a first name and last name into Karl-E’s patron query. “ She never has her library card, so I always have to check her out with her driver’s license... And there you go. Ruby G. Cortese.” Aaron stands with a flourish toward the screen. “ Phone number, address, email address, all you need for stalking the stalker.”
Dean plays over it gently, feeling out its width and length and texture. It’s about the thickness of his thumb, thicker than the lines further down, quite possibly the origin point. Tiny imperfections, indentations in the flesh, speak of ragged wounds and stitches. Crossing the back of Cas’ shoulder, there are numerous lines branching off down his back, down the length of his arm.
“ What makes you say that?” Castiel speaks quietly. Mostly as not to disturb Alex, but also because he isn’t certain he can keep his voice steady at a higher volume. Whispering is just easier.
the excess is very gatsby ;)
“ Me, Daddy! Do me!” Regaining their breath, Claire and Jack now demand their own fancy dance moves.
“ Din! GowifDin!” Jack continues to make his opinions known loudly and at high frequency. “ GOOO! WIIIF! DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN!”
I apologize if I misread the situation or ever made you feel obligated to endure my behavior. I want you to know that I care deeply about you, Dean. The children think the world of you.
Everything is crazy. Everything. I needed some worry free smut. We all need some worry free smut. Here is some worry free smut.
Dean sounds like a bear. All growly and snorty and he growls again but then he coughs and wiggles and he’s all quiet now.
“ Awesome.” Dean can’t stop smiling. A big dumb goofy ass smile. He nudges Cas toward the hallway. “ You get the bathroom first. Oh shit, something to sleep in. I could text Gabe, run over and grab something if you want? Or you can borrow something of mine?” The smile is gone. He focuses a bit more on Cas’ clothing peeking between the edges of the afghan. “  Wait, you’re already in pj’s.” He is. Pale blue with bumblebees buzzing among the cloud pattern, familiar university hoodie on top.
This is not how Dean’s extended Memorial Day weekend was supposed to go.
“ I know.” Dean’s voice is close, lips nearly touching the tip of Castiel’s nose. A few breaths pass and Dean speaks up, wide smile evident in his tone. “ You don’t know that reference, do you?”
“ Good point. They shouldn’t.” Dean wiggles his knee to nudge against her side, jostling her in time with the song. “ She can dress however she wants, just like everyone else.”
Castiel glances at the caregivers and children milling about, strollers blocking the aisles and gaggles of nannies clustered together and speaking in high pitched, much too loud voices. “ Not too busy.” Which is true. At least, it was while Garth’s story time was in session. Everyone was in the storyroom and not crowding the rather spacious children’s area. But once storytime finished up, a stampede of shrill voices was released and Castiel had only hoped that Garth wouldn’t take too long gathering his things before returning to the Children’s reference desk.
Castiel merely nods in response and follows Cain into the cabin. He’s always liked the small home, its rustic charm and one or two modern conveniences perfectly balanced and in tune with their eccentric owner. Tonight, he doesn’t pay any attention to the handmade quilt over the couch or the row of photographs beneath the large flat screen TV. Castiel’s eyes are instantly drawn to the bag on the dining table, limp and wrinkled around the shape inside.
His distress must play across his expression, because Garth laughs and slaps him on the back. “ It’s takes some getting used to. The noise, I mean.”
When Dean had first visited his brother and sister-in-law here years ago, he’d been invited along and had been greatly impressed by the camaraderie between the clinic employees and the singing talent on display. Since moving to Tennessee and joining the Hunter Hollow Pediatric crew, he’s been to each karaoke night, happy to have a set date in his calendar for fun with his coworkers and friends. The little coincidence that the place has the same name as his Aunt Ellen’s bar back in Sioux Falls doesn’t hurt none either.
Dean frowns. “ Totally forgot. Tell her I’ll be there in a second, I swear!” He waves as the young woman ducks back out of the room, door left open. Dean turns back to Castiel, smile growing wider and deepening the crow’s feet that make Castiel's’ heart twitch uncontrollably. “ So, yeah. Eventful appointment. It was good to meet you, Cas.” He sticks his hand out again, practically beaming when Castiel accepts it without hesitation.
Except, the children would be going to bed fairly soon after Dean would have arrived. Leaving just the adults. Alone.
“ I like your loud music.”
Castiel bends down to brush a kiss across Jack’s cheek. “ Sweet dreams, Jack,” he whispers into the fine hairs above the boy’s ear. “ I love you, very much.”
“ Work is fine.” Castiel jumps right in, though he knows what Cain is actually talking about. After Ruby’s unmasking several weeks ago, Castiel had decided to tell Cain about the emails and had shown him images from Ruby’s public profile. Just to let Cain know what was going on and to be on the alert for Ruby, in case she decided to start hanging around the area.  “ No emails. No Ruby. No Nicholas.” He takes in a deep breath, calming, as he brings a plate of baked ham and turkey to the table. “ No new forms of psychological terror, as of yet.”
Castiel smiles sweetly as he addresses his immature older brother. “ We’re going to watch a movie. Have fun with Kali.” He hangs up in the middle of Gabriel’s defeated shout and turns back to Dean. “ I’ll heat up the lasagna. ”
Gabriel has also been bugging Castiel for a brotherly road trip. Castiel loves driving, and he loves his brother, but he doesn’t think he could handle being in such a confined space for such an extended period of time with Gabriel. Sharing a bedroom until Gabriel left for college had been a challenge in patience.
“ Dr. Jess!” Claire squeals, flinging herself at a blonde woman that is, yes, Dr. Moore from the pediatric clinic.
Cain is back at the stove, stirring whatever heavenly scented concoction is cooking in the large stewpot. He nods toward the small kitchen table where a double paper bag is sitting. “ Go through it and make sure everything you wanted is in it. Dinner will be served up very soon.”
now live within spitting distance.” Jess sips on her water and burps loudly under hand. “ Especially with everything Castiel’s been through…”
He takes extra time over Dean’s perky nipples simply to revel in the younger man’s little gasps and sighs as he carefully rolls and tweaks the small nubs between his fingers. They’re red and swollen by the time he moves lower and finds a ticklish spot low on Dean’s belly, judging by his sudden giggles. Castiel exploits the weakness, fingertips skittering, but takes pity on Dean after only a few seconds when he almost knees Castiel in the chest during his involuntary jerking.
“ Uh, read the sender address?” Charlie stares at him as though he’s lost his senses. There’s a long pause where they stare at each other and Castiel can see it in her eyes when something clicks in her brain; a quick blink and dilation. “ They’re not normal emails.” she whispers, then they both glance at Aaron. He is still immersed in travel influencers.
“ Get rid of it, however you see fit.”
With the primary cause of Castiel’s anxiety being taken care of, he can now deal with the unexpected secondary cause now that Dean is out of the room. Dean is attractive, yes. Dean is very friendly, yes. But that’s no reason for the weird hit of familiarity Castiel has whenever he thinks about that split second look of… He wants to call it blank loss but honestly, there had been the tiniest flash of unpleasant shock in those pretty green eyes. Which is completely insane and Castiel didn’t come here to flirt with his children’s healthcare providers or question any odd feelings either might have about the other.
It’s nearly midnight before a yawn cracks Castiel’s face in half, interrupting his telling of Jack’s recent discovery of his penis’ elasticity. “ ‘Scuse me.”
It’s dark in the hall but the bathroom light is on and Jack is a big boy so he opens the bathroom door wide and runs to the big potty. He forgot his stool!  It’s a nice stool. Blue and green with whales on it. Jack puts his stool on the floor in front of the big potty. And he has to put the big potty seat up. It is heavy and Jack is very careful.
Dean is immensely satisfied. “ Close enough. Sam used to call me Bean.”
people; people who couldn’t help themselves. Every gap-toothed smile and sticky little hug helped to heal one of the many cracks in his heart.
. Both require him to send out final confirmation emails to the speakers, easy enough for him to do from the information desk. His adult programs in-progress include
“ How was Gabriel’s?” Dean blinks some drizzle from his lashes, shifting his other two bags more comfortably.
He listens happily as he fills his plate with a little of everything and whispers a painfully grateful, “ Bless you,” for the mug of hot coffee Gabriel pours for him. His fingers brush the back of Dean’s hand as he passes the little carton of creamer.
On reflex, Castiel flips them both over, pressing their fronts to the road, his back exposed to the onslaught. The scratch on his back burns hotter, enough that Castiel can’t ignore the pain blooming across his skin and muscles. Not helped when the man beneath begins struggling in earnest, tear choked coughs laboring his breathing.
“ Well, that sounds like a done deal, so what else was there to talk about?” Claire pushes her novelty glasses back up, the huge things wanting to slip down with every movement of her head.
“ No worries there. He’s so smitten with you it’s downright sickening. I can’t believe he’s managed to not make a move on you all these months.”
He’d known. The moment he agreed to come to Dean’s bed, Castiel knew he’d have to decide to take off his shirt. Or not. To lie about the scars. Or not.
Garth lifts a heavily mitted paw and shows his teeth in a very pathetic growl. “ I’mma werewolf.”
Jack turns a very impressive stink eye on him, then crawls off Dean to clamber to his father. “ Tahs, pease?”
Dean nods silently, head still so full of fear and anger. He bends down to grab the bag it came in, holding it open for Cain to place the box inside.
Castiel gives an apologetic downward quirk of his mouth. “ Not yet. Should he be?” He hopes he didn’t mess up Alex’s sleeping routine too much.
Dean watches, fascinated, as the expressions pass over Cas’ face as he slowly jacks him off.  Normally, Cas’ emotions are displayed in small ways. Tiny twitches of his fingers and crinkling around his eyes and quirk of his lips. Subtle. But here, giving himself over to the pleasure Dean is happily giving, the older man’s face is a blatant display of desire, of pleasure. Cas squeezes his eyes shut and flings them wide open again to stare into Dean’s with naked want. Cas grips Dean’s shoulders hard enough to leave bruises and then ghosts a single finger down the bridge of Dean’s nose. Cas’ body tenses on each upstroke and melts on the descent.
“ Are you sure?” But, of course,  Cas still has to confirm.
Cas is the first to pull back and step away. He's staring openly at Dean, a mix of emotions warring on his face. “ Dean… I can’t.”
forced to listen to Claire and Jack enthusiastically wax poetic about Dean’s many positive attributes as Meg grins unapologetically at him above their heads.
Jack is supposed to flush the big potty when he’s done but that will make a loud noise and he doesn’t want to be loud because people are sleeping and Daddy says not to wake up people when they are sleeping and Jack is a big boy and listens to Daddy.
Claire giggles, then shouts, “ Dr. Jess is having a baby!”
Dean doesn’t want to think about it.
Castiel shakes his head in affectionate exasperation, then turns back to his daughter. “ Uncle Gabe was mostly right and I promise we’ll talk about it later, but right now I need to clean up for this lovely breakfast you made.”
Cain squeezes once, then releases Dean’s hand to curve it around his bowl once more. “ That takes time, for everyone,” he assures the younger man. “ And it takes time to figure out when one should try again.” He levels Dean with pointed gaze.
It’s not long before the beers are gone and no one is really paying any attention to the movie. Not even to Sam Elliott’s fabulous hair. Though, Dean would blushingly admit, the star’s deep twangy voice is definitely adding fuel to his fire as he and Cas steadily lose interest in the film and turn their focus on each other.
“ Hoppy berfday, Din!”
“ I did,” Castiel agrees with a put upon sigh. “ I was thinking about where I’m going to hide all your Christmas presents and got distracted.”
Sam eyes the nicer than average jeans, but doesn’t remark any further. He nods, floppy hair swinging over his eyes before he brushes it back behind his ears. “ ‘Kay, we’ll see you at lunch? About two?”
Castiel drops to the ground at the passenger’s side. Broken glass covers the asphalt. The passenger is conscious and shouting at the driver who does not appear to be so when Castiel ducks down to peer through the busted window. He reaches in and grabs the older man’s shoulder. “ Hey! I’m gonna get you out!” Castiel starts pulling on the man’s arm, only to be knocked free so violently he falls on his ass.
Constantine- aka Stan- hangs up the phone and uses orange to check a box under the title ‘Waiting Room’. He throws Dean an absent, “ I believe in you, Winchester,” in his lightly accented voice before heading back to his small lab.
He thinks of it now, as he eases Alex’s small body into the cupped seat. Careful of tiny fingers and loose fabric, Dean buckles and adjusts the five-point harness until it’s perfect and then covers the baby with the blankets, tucking in the edges.  “ There you go, big man. Snug as a bug in a rug.”  He checks the seatbelt anchoring the base one more time, then scoots out to let Sam have his place. Now that he can see Sam’s face, he can see why Jess was eager to kiss it off. Sam has that stupid fond smile and soft eyes look on. The one he learned from Dean but Dean’ll never admit it. “ What? Gassy?”
“ You know me,” Dean replies awkwardly, fitting the bag among their previous purchases in the cart. He’s avoiding eye contact, he knows this, but he can’t stop. Except he really should grow up and get through this like a well adjusted adult. “ You go ahead, I’ll catch up.”
“ Or she’s jealous. Seems the type.” Charlie interjects.
“ He’s only two, Gabriel. How old were you when you stopped wetting the bed?” Castiel chuckles when Gabriel flips him off. “ But yes, his pull-up was wet when he and Dean finally woke up. And Dean was perfectly fine with it.”
“ People suck, “ Castiel offers the oft shared motto of the library staff.
Dean is still standing at the bottom of the stairs when Sam bumps into him from behind, big voice booming into his ear. “ Mr. Novak? Dean didn’t tell me you were his new neighbor. ”
could he
I think becoming “ involved with someone”, “ he does the finger quotes just to irritate. “ Would make that list feel not quite as shit-tastic.”
Cas doesn’t seem to notice Dean’s momentary blank. He looks down at his striped shirt, tugging at the printed fabric. “ Claire insisted I couldn’t accompany them without wearing some kind of costume. I borrowed these from Garth.” He motions toward the headband as well. “ The headband isn’t too bad, but the shirt is a bit tight.
” See ya, jerk.”
Dean also takes this in. It’s completely valid. Due to a variety of circumstances, Dean had kept his relationship with Cain on the down low. Everyone knew Dean was seeing someone, but were very scarce on the details. And they did not part on good terms, despite how hard Cain had tried to keep it civil. Dean had been in way too deep, had been too hurt to salvage anything from the ashes. That’s on him. “ I doubt any time before this would’ve been a good time, so yeah… I understand.”  Definitely too heavy for Starbucks on a Sunday morning. If they manage to rekindle a friendship then they can deal with the details of the past at some later date. For now,  Dean thinks it’s probably best to stick to the present. He clears his throat and blatantly changes topics. “ So, your website is awesome. I can’t believe you actually pulled off the whole beekeeper thing.”
Besides, part of what Castiel enjoys about driving is the solitude. He’s alone with his thoughts, he can mull over work problems, or personal problems or best yet, let his mind go blank and simply exist in the moment, keeping the car on the road and pointed in the right direction.
It’s timed out and Dean deactivates his lockscreen. The picture of him singing to Alex in front of the windows is still pulled up. Did Cas save a copy of this one for himself? The thought brings a heat to Dean’s cheeks and he coughs lightly to disrupt the stupid grin spread across his face. The kids haven’t moved and Dean eases back between them. He scrolls through his albums and pulls up the one dedicated to Alexander Dean Winchester or
“ Claire, it is incredibly rude to rummage through people’s belongings. You know this.” But, first things first. Castiel has to figure out who’s to blame for the blunder.
And then Dean is
“ Are you getting
It starts slowly, like always. They have a bit of a routine, mostly in place so they don’t get too crazy while the kids are around.  Arm over the shoulder. Holding hands. Touching thighs. Small kisses. Half an hour passes and they’re reasonably certain that Claire and Jack are asleep and they won’t be disturbed any time soon. Hopefully.
and there is
Dean smiles, but rests the tines of his fork on the edge of his plate and gives Claire his full attention. After a few questioning glances at Castiel. “ Well,” he clears his throat. “ We did what Gabe said we did, and--”
Claire flops down on Castiel’s other side, wiggling to get comfortable against the pack on her back, and people watches for several seconds before asking him, “ Did you act all crazy like Mr. Sam and Dean when I was born?”
“ Just keep swimming!” Claire answers with a happy shriek. “ Does it really say that?” She leans as far over the table as she can without falling out of her chair,  squinting at the small print on his skin.
The pride and love in his face is painful to see. Because in Castiel’s mind, it is overlayed with the bloody face streaked with tears as Dean watched his father burn up in the very car he’s so affectionately stroking now. Except Dean obviously doesn’t quite remember it, not fully anyway. And that realization slams into Castiel’s gut like a physical punch.
“ Nope.” Jess’s voice is much too smug for Dean’s taste.
Firmly decided, again, Dean sips at his water and hopes he can get through the rest of the evening without anymore intrusive matchmaking.
“ We can hash out all the details tomorrow, well, whenever we wake up.” Dean tilts his face up and Castiel can see his eyes are open now, staring straight into his own.  “ I know the timing isn’t ideal. I know there are things going on I don’t even know about. And I know you’re worried about me, on top of worrying about the kids and your family, everyone in your orbit. I understand there’s gonna be limitations, even more than what your average single parent deals with. I understand and I’m here.” There’s a heavy pause, then Dean chuckles quietly. “ I’m here until you tell me to go. And even then I don’t think you’d be able to get rid of me too easy.”
a puppy for Christmas?”
characters.
Castiel likes driving at night. Not just in the dark, or after sunset. But late night, early morning. Long after the evening rush hour but before the morning traffic. When there’s next to no one on the road and it’s quiet and peaceful and he just sorta zones out and lets the car take him where he needs to go. It’s even better in the summer when he can roll the windows down and there’s music playing just loud enough to be heard over the air rushing in.
When he turns around, Dean is watching him, gaze following his every move. Dark and hungry.  Castiel wishes he was twenty years younger because his own arousal is trying desperately to wake up his softened cock. An exercise in futility, but Castiel appreciates the effort. Instead of raging lust, he is overcome by the need to reciprocate; to give Dean as much pleasure and satisfaction as he gave Castiel earlier. More, if possible.
Jack is awake.
Dean can’t laugh too much at them; he’d had the same reaction the first time he’d driven over Tuesday. He watches as the gate slowly, but smoothly, slides open.  “ He just really likes his privacy.”
Jack dives back in without missing a beat, rolling the drum and peeling socks and washcloths from the sides. He cheers every time he is successful and twists around to hand his prize over to Dean. It doesn’t take long for the toddler to shout , “ Ah dun!,” and wiggle backwards.
Castiel stares coldly at her, jaw clenched so hard he feels he might crack a tooth. There’s so much rage roiling beneath the ice he’s hiding behind. To keep his calm and not be arrested for assaulting this utter bitch.
Dinner with Meg goes about as well as Castiel expected.
“ Yeah…” Castiel lets it trail off because despite all his fears and doubts, he’d really made up his mind that morning with Dean and Jack on the couch. But Gabriel’s blessing is the icing on the cake. And the brotherly encouragement he didn’t know he needed to dispel some of the guilt around his decision. Of course, now he has other worries. Like how he’s going to go about courting Dean. Or, maybe all this time beforehand has been the courting and now Castiel just needs to ask the man out on a date? But when? The timing could be better. The holidays are busy for everyone; between family, friends, and work obligations they actually haven’t seen each other very much in the last couple of weeks. Usually a bit in the evenings, or passing like ships in the night in their driveway as one comes home and the other heads out.  He’ll have to find out when Meg is available so he can take Dean out somewhere. Somewhere nice. First dates should be special.
“ You’re the exception to every rule, Meg.”
“ Love you, too, sweetheart.”
“ Stupid,” Castiel mutters under his breath. How stupid of him. How cruel, after telling the younger man barely two weeks ago that he wasn’t in a place to pursue any extracurricular relationships. And watching a movie after the kids go to bed doesn’t always equal romantic opportunity, but Castiel had wanted it to. Still wants it. Because he’s stupid. And selfish.
He falls under the man’s weight and his own momentum, landing hard on the asphalt and instinctually wrapping both arms around his cargo to keep him safe. Castiel’s heart is thumping so hard he’s certain the man crushed against his chest has to feel it through his thin t-shirt. He takes a deep breath, ready to lay the man down and go back for the other when the loudest boom he’s ever experienced splits the air like earthbound thunder and a wave of heat flashes over them.
“ Habit,” Castiel replies dryly.
“ Who’s coming on Saturday?” Claire practically apparates at Castiel’s side. She blows minty breath into his face as she waits for his answer.
And that reminds Castiel that they haven’t finished breakfast yet and he wouldn’t put it past Gabriel to send Jack after them in a moment to route them from the bedroom. He breaks the kiss slowly, shortening each motion until their lips merely touch and then the space between them increases with each breath. There’s still a responsive twitch in the front of his jeans but Castiel ignores it. Because the children are waiting and Gabriel is probably hatching a cunning plan and a quickie is not how Castiel wants to start a physical relationship with Dean.
Dean dips his head slightly and raises their joined hands higher to rest on the bottom edge of the pillow. Castiel can feel the tip of Dean’s nose pressing lightly against his knuckles. Dean is settling down, relaxing into the mattress, into Castiel.  “ People just want me to diagnose them for free. I can’t tell you how many rashes I’ve seen outside of the office because people are too embarrassed to see their primary physician.”  Dean’s other hand begins moving up and down over the back of Castiel’s t-shirt, idly petting him. “ Or they want my opinions on potty training just so they can disagree. “
Cain pauses the replay and stands, careful not to bump into Dean. His tone is light, but his expression serious, when he says, “ Let’s check it out, shall we?”
“ I’ve already gotten the spiel, thanks.” Meg cuts him off, waving her hand in dismissal. She reclines back into the pillowed corner like a queen on her throne. A perfectly manicured nail taps lightly on the back of the couch, her brow arching sharply. “ Just tell him. I seriously doubt, with all I’ve heard about him already, that he’s going to flip out on you.”
Because he’s reasonably certain he just agreed to a family dinner with Dean Winchester;  pediatrics NP, switch, world class cook and his
“ But you’re both old, right?” Claire is attempting to get a blob of ice cream to balance on a chunk of apple.
As much as Jack does not like not being in Dean’s lap, the little boy is having a good time touching the tiny cloth covered feet and watching Alex squirm. Dean smiles at the interaction and tilts his head toward the other end of the couch. “ Take a load off and stay awhile, as my Uncle Bobby would say.”
I told you about it because it was the day you dropped your phone into the spaghetti sauce while we were talking and you had to use Bobby’s old flip phone to call me back.”
Well, that’s… Castiel doesn’t really know how to feel about that bit of information because honestly he’s still quite confused over anything he feels for what is essentially a stranger. And in the middle of what is the biggest mess his life has ever been and the last thing he needs right now is… complications. Yes, exactly. Complications. Relationships are always complicated, especially for him,  and right now they are doubly so, so Castiel pushes that messy tangle of physical urges and surprising emotions to the side and focuses on getting through this meeting with the least amount of awkward.
He puts his stool back in the corner.
Castiel silently curses his friend’s forgetfulness. Though how one can forget that they keep their guest bedroom stocked as a sex dungeon, he can’t possibly fathom.
Castiel can’t hear anything else over Dean’s burst of laughter at Claire’s use of air quotes and even Castiel can appreciate the accuracy of the girl’s impression of him. He shoots Dean a look, trying for deadpan but it melts instantly since he’s greeted by the sight of Dean wearing Jack’s neon colored paper crown and Jack wearing Dean’s red plaid scarf like a little babushka.
why it works.
“ Distracted driving is bad.”
room.
Fear pinches Dean’s stomach, the once awesome food now settling heavy in his gut. “ Not one anyone’s expecting?” He drops his handful of popcorn into the bowl and carefully sets it on the middle couch cushion.
“ Cool! Stay here!” she orders before scrambling off the couch and heading toward a short bookshelf tucked into the corner beside the fireplace.
“ Dude, please don’t tell me I cried.”
“ Everyone ready?” Dean asks, hoping to dispel his own worries over Cas’ seeming hesitance to enter his car. He revs the engine a few times which distracts Jack’s attention from the horn, thank god. A chorus of affirmatives, one last revving, then Dean puts Baby into gear. “ You got it, Jack. Let’s go!” He eases up on the brake pedal, and taps the gas, sending the Impala up the gentle incline at a very slow crawl.
And tonight, most of those doubts and uncertainties and squirrely thoughts all revolve around one particular blue eyed brunette that lives next door.
