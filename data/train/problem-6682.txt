“I love you more than anything in the world.”
“Don’t.”
“You're working through something complicated, but you don't have to do it alone,” said Papa.
They lowered their weapons. The jet door lowered. Men and women in HAZMAT suits were setting up white tents. Another group set up a clear bubble-like tent at the base of the entrance. Clint, Natasha, and him were pushed into the other tent.
“Agent Barton has taken out engine one. We’re losing altitude,” said Fury.
“Before we get started. I want you to be completely honest with me. I’m not here for self-promotion. Nothing said here will leave this room. I will sign whatever you want to assure you of that.”
"Yes, you can call in Mr. Stark."
“You’ve got a smart girl, Stark.” Fury ruffled her hair.
It only provided her with a short summary of Denmark. It was a Scandinavian country, consisting of the Jutland Peninsula and other islands. The capital was Copenhagen.
"Why keep this here?"
“Twenty-five.”
“Nightmares?”
Lena’s voice was soft, nurturing, and Piper nodded unconsciously.
“You remember that,” said Tony.
“How do you do that?”
“I can’t get back to sleep.”
Tony woke to an empty bed. His newly formed bond let him know his mate was safe and sound.
“Yes, sir.”
“How are they?” asked Tony.
“Piper, I’ll allow you to use this computer freely, if you do something for me.”

Steve groaned. His head was stuffy. Shame washed over him. He’d wet his pants. Steve was a grown man and he’d pissed his pants.
“I can work through it.”
“Alright.”
“Tony."
Tony jolted awake when he felt anger surging through his bond with Steve. Something happened. It wasn’t the panic angered of an episode. This was pure rage. He went to the training room, stopping when he heard Steve beating the ever-living hell out of a punching bag. It took three hours for it to stop. Steve sat slouched on the floor. Sand dusted the ground. The deflated leather casing of punching bags scattered the room. There were several large dents in the wall. He could smell blood. Wincing at the sight of Steve’s hands. Dark purple and green bruises stained them. Several of the omega’s fingers were broken. Two of the fractures pierced through the skin. He quietly moved to Steve’s side, sitting down next to him. Steve rested his head against his shoulder.
Steve woke to the sun shining brightly into his room. He burrowed under the blankets and closed his eyes. Waking up could wait. The bed smelled of Tony. He wrapped himself further within that scent. Then the memory of last night jolted him awake. He was in a sun-bathed room. Waking up in a strange place with no idea of how got there shouldn't be something that occurred multiple in someone's life. Steve whined.

Tony sped down the road, reading over the file as he went. His thoughts traveled to Happy. The man had been swept up in this mess. The corner of the page broke his thought. It was MIA it was AIM. He called Rhodes.
“Then what?” asked Lena.
“Steve Rogers."
“Hmm, now what’s going here,” said Clint from cargo entrance.
“Nope.”
"So you've met."
“I was.”
Piper bared her teeth, growling. She tossed her head, trying to throw off his grip.
Piper started shaking again as soon as Winter moved her from his lap.
“Not sure."
“What?”
“You won’t.”
"The pup is disease-free," said Tony.
*****
“From outer space an alien,” he said.
“Sir, Ms. Potts is calling again. This is the tenth time she’s called,” said Jarvis.
“What floor?” asked Tony.
"Her too," said Maria.
*****
In 1960 the first oral contraceptive was approved by the FDA as contraception. The Supreme Cout in 1965 gave the right to use birth control ruling it was protected by the constitutional right to privacy.
“Steve told me. Did you two ever fully recommit to each other?” Edith chose her wording carefully.
“Watch it!”
Rhodes had to take a moment to stare at his friend. It was unbelievable. Tony Stark was head over heels in love. He would believe it if hadn't seen them together. It was good for Tony. Healthy for him to be in a kind of relationship that made him feel this way.
“An old girlfriend?” said Steve. He encountered too many of his husband's bedmates. None were a threat to what he had. They were an annoyance. It would be the same with this woman.
For the rest of their time together, they went over basic strikes of his combat styles, Winter showing her through example. He wouldn't push her further physically today. She needed time to adjust to this kind of training.
“Get him out of here!” growled Blackwell.
Tony rolled his eyes. “See that red lever. It will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out. Stand by and wait for my word,” said Tony.
“Yes, I’ve trained several agents.” He couldn't recall their names or faces, but he was sure it was something he'd done. They'd want him to pass down his skill and efficiency to others. All those others he'd taught had some baseline. The pup was a blank slate.
Steve moaned when the jets activated. They worked perfectly into his muscles. He shouldn’t get used to this, but it was so nice. At S.H.I.E.L.D, he wouldn’t be pampered like this. When the water-cooled, he got out. He toweled off and put on a pair of fresh underwear.
“Good to know,” she said.
“Steve, wake up."
Tony took a jacket from his chair, pulling it over the sleeping being. Steve nuzzled into the fabric, purring. That sound was addictive in its perfection. He so wanted to join him. Tony pressed a gentle kiss on his temple. Something set his protective instincts on edge. He growled, moving closer to the omega. Feet against the window. His omega didn’t wake. There was a shatter of glass. His armor surrounded him.
“Her parents are out for blood.”
Lena entered the outer room. Today she was wearing a summer dress. It was white with red flowers. She took a seat in front of them. Piper instantly held Theodore’s hand.
“I’ll show, but we need a big open space,” said Natasha.
“Are you okay?” asked Steve.
Maria hung up. After the ‘Incident’, S.H.I.E.L.D. built a small facility in the city. It was open to the public, though it gave away very little about the organization’s actual purpose. But, it was enough to satisfy the average person and make them feel safe. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s offices underneath it was where the real things happened.
“And what was the little baby’s penguin’s name?”
"No, I just want to know my options," he said.
Lena waited for Pierce by the entrance. A burst of cold air barreled inside as the door swung open.
Steve unwrapped his hand. There was only a faint yellowish brown bruising across his knuckles.
She ran to the barrier separating them. The pup was excitedly jumping up and down.
"Yes, ma’am."
Tony tried shielding Steve from view as much as possible. Steve hid his face in the crook of his neck.
“Yes, Sir."
"A bad session with Turner. With the way, I smell Tony won't question it."
“NO!”
“Don’t cry, sweetheart,” said Tony.
“Viking funeral, public execution,” said Tony.
Piper sighed giving up the verbal argument, continuing the conversation may hurt Papa. That was the last thing she wanted. It wouldn't stop her from looking into it though. She would have Jarvis download some books on the brain.
"Mommy?" he said sleepily.
Lena smiled down at them, already thinking of the generation after them. Godly strength and genius intellect. What a combination the two would make. It would be at least fifteen years before they could be introduced to such a matter. But such a creation would be better done artificially anyway, rather than through anything that could create too powerful of a union.
"And otherwise you wouldn't have told me!" he yelled.
“It is, Steve!”
“New York,” said Tony.
"No."
Steve left. Tony groaned. How the hell did he get Steve? Why did he deserve this after all the fucked up things he’d done? He got into the shower. The cold water gave him jolted and helped cleared his mind. He came out of the shower. Still, he wasn’t ready to confront Steve. Sleep, first.
“As almost every parent would be. But I merely have to play the damsel in distress. Say that my family was being threatened. That I had no choice but to act how I did. Golden hearted omega such as Captain Rogers will fall right for it."
"Next time we're driving," said Tony rubbing his temples.
“We’ll just have to find out what he wants tomorrow,” said Steve.
Loki loved to watch an alpha beg.
“What’s wrong with my Papa and Daddy?!”
“Yes.”
"I think it would be best to do it personally. She'll be more impressed if you do," said Bruce.
"I want it to be a speed boat and a submarine," she said excitedly, jumping up and down.
“Steve, take a breath. You aren't alone in this."
“Pull it up, Jarvis,” said Tony.
“Another bonus to moving in with you don’t have to deal with her,” said Tony.
Natasha smirked.
He groaned.
His mouth stayed unyielding straight line. Theodore it was.
A simple black car pulled up. This one wasn’t driven by itself. The driver was a broad slight chubby alpha. He came to greet them.
Tony had no reason to look over the footage. It would be fine. He quietly left the lab and went to make breakfast. Steve settled on cereal. He tried to calm his rapidly beating heart. Jarvis brewed some coffee.
“I love you, Piper,” he whispered.
“Nice, to meet. I’m-
“And what about the suit I’m wearing?”
"What do you have in mind?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Pup?”
“Steve Rogers,” he said, shaking the Alpha’s hand.
“Done?”
“I never said he couldn’t.”
“Nothing,” said Clint.
The pieces clicked together. They weren’t only after his help, but Tony’s as well. Steve remembered reading over some notes on the Avengers Initiative.
Steve twitched in his sleep.
“There’s only one way to do that,” said Rune grimly.
"Go to the lab," said Steve, pushing away the alpha.
June 2, 2016
Tony wrapped an arm around Steve, as Steve unwrapped Piper, checking her toes and fingers for frostbite from the short exposure to the frigid air. He wiped the blood from her hands. Her beautiful hair was jaggedly cut. He tucked her back into his jacket. Piper nuzzled into him and began purring. She whined slightly as the jet took off.
The process was repeated with Rune. He was a bit twitchy but otherwise fine. Dr. Star offered him an array of lollipops.
“You struck me enough electricity to kill me five times over. But my heart kept ticking. You should be impressed, Jason. Not many people come that close to killing me.”
He looked at the doctor. She subtle shook her head.
“There’s no getting out. I’ve tried.” Rune hugged himself. “They do bad things if we try to get out.”
“Stop this bullshit,” ordered the coach.
From outside, Steve and Tony heard someone stumbling through the window. Steve broke down the door. The room was draped in plastic. Duck-taped to an armchair was a beaten corpse, its features too swollen to be distinguishable.
“Shouldn’t you get going?”
Not even ten seconds later Rhodes called.
“She’s only curious about a new face. She's only ever seen you and Tony,” said Bruce.
“Piper.”
“She’s asleep. Maria and Pepper put her to bed.”
Steve jolted, darting to the hall bathroom. Tony followed closely behind him. Piper shrieked when he barged in his shield in hand. Relief swept through him when he saw she'd fallen into the toilet. They couldn't help laughing.
“I visited one of my dad’s oldest friends,” he said.
Tony nodded. Helping his boyfriend move out wasn’t something he ever thought he’d do. There was a knock at the door.
Steve kissed him on the forehead. “I love you.”
“The little boy who saved you.”
“I didn’t see any missions on your schedule,” he said.
He grabbed the box of donuts from the floor luckily it hadn’t spilled.
“Call Tony.”
“That has nothing to do with it! I've never held that against you!”
“What are? Are you a decoy? You’re double, right?”
Steve took his alpha’s hand.
home."
“We’ll you tell us what they say?” asked Steve.
"What do you have in mind?" asked Tony.
Steve and Turner went to Howard’s old office.
"Jarvis, what time is it?"
They told him he was free to do as he wished when he wasn’t on duty. Why did they need to know his location at all times? He wasn’t a threat to S.H.I.E.L.D and was entitled to a private life. They were the ones who insisted on him getting out in the world in the first place. Maybe they needed him for a mission.
“Focus.”
But when he set her down on the thin mattress, she was already out. He pulled the scratchy blanket over her, toy bunny tucked against her chest. Some deep part of him was satisfied at that fact that he could take care of something. It was odd, nurturing life, instead of extinguishing it. And he wasn’t entirely sure if that’s what he was doing. The sad fact was that he was the only one here who would offer her such a thing. Winter wasn't programmed for such behavior and thought he would likely fail.
“How many did you have when I was gone?”
“You've watched it over a hundred times, Tony. If there were anything to find, you would have found it by now. All you're doing, now, is torturing yourself."
“Carl, how much of that did you hear?”
“You do?” asked Thor.
“Stay there. I’ll make you a nest,” said Tony. He gathered the extra blankets from the closet. Tony had gotten the hang of building a nest to Steve's high standards.
“Carl is a wonderful boy. I bet he’s happy you’re home.”
“Now might not be the best time to mention this but you’re on bed rest for three days,” said Tony.
“Hello.”
"Are you done little one?" he asked. Steve brushed the taste of vomit out of his mouth.
“Night, love you,” said Tony.
“I can’t wait to meet her.”
“I’m guessing he’s beautiful,” said Rhodey.
"It’s something a person says when they regret doing something."
Steve playfully shoved him away.
“We’re not doing that,” he said.
“I have to meet with a doctor,” she said.
Steve pulled away from him. "Please, Tony, let's leave get away from this and figure out what to do. We can visit Peggy. I'm sure she'll be happy to have us."
“No, you got yours?”
“How it go, sweetie?” asked Steve.
“Sir, I believe you should patent this. Many parents have difficulty installing car seats,” said Jarvis.
“Looks can be deceiving. Oh sorry, I-
“We fought,” said Rune.
She gently touched his shoulder.
"I know."
“I’ll let you change."
Rory’s expression was one of shock. He was expecting the perfect Captain America answer, but this was better this was human. Rory didn’t pick at why or who would earn the spite of the hero.
"I was an omega with the body of alpha. I was ridiculed by many alphas, made to feel as if I were somehow unnatural, which in truth I was. Science turned me into what I was. But there is still a way to feel human."
Tony pulled a sheet off a piece of furniture, revealing a 40s jukebox. Upon Tony's touch the machine alight. And started flipping through the songs.
When the call ended, Rumlow punched a wall. How was it that crazy bitch got away with murder and was still praised, yet he was the one to get scolded?
She glared at her husband. Gloria and Henry had retreated, taking Carl with them.
"Bucky always wanted me to go. All you needed to get in was a pretty omega. We never tried though," said Steve.
Tony swallowed and took another sip of coffee.
about?"
“How much?”
“Four bullets,” Tony said quietly, unable to contain himself. Four shots that pierced Tony’s heart every time he watched that day’s footage. He had lost count of how many times he’d been hit by those four shots since returning from his own limbo. And how many times he’d cried until he had no more tears because he couldn’t prevent it from happening.
"Wait a second," Rhodes said. "Does Steve know about you and Natasha?"
Rhodes sighed, defeated. "I expected more than twenty-four hours, but apparently, I'm not that lucky."
She then looked pointedly at Steve.
His heart was beating in slow motion, waiting. And then, Steve opened the most beautiful shy smile Tony had ever seen.
"How would I ruin everything?" Tony winced. That was absurd. “
That was what Tony wanted to shout. That wasn’t possible. Steve remembered everything, right? No one had erased his memory.
“A penny for your thoughts,” Steve said after taking a sip from his coffee.
"Actually, it's a lot bigger," Sam agreed.
"I don't think it's going to work with a judge, right?" Steve asked at last.
So Tony was now hiding in the shadows of a chimney, wearing his stealth armor, camouflaging himself in the dark, in the building across from Steve’s in Brooklyn, waiting. It was snowing, but who cares for some snow when the possibilities are so incredible? No lights had been turned on; no movement had been detected. Everything was extremely quiet on that quiet street. Tony was beginning to think that the news was, in fact, rumors, and that espionage was a beautiful waste of time. It wasn’t.
about something that big.”
Tony said loudly.
“Okay,” Steve shrugged. “Don’t you want to show up? No need.” He put his hands in the front pockets of his pants. “But know that I know you’re out there. And I know you can hear me.”
she repeated.
"Were you counting?"
“Do you trust me?” Steve asked.
"I'm going upstairs and call May to tell her the news. And ask her to send me the rest of my clothes.”
"Fair enough," Steve approached, picked up the bottle of water that Tony held out to him and took a good sip that left his lips wet and extremely inviting. "So you're going to finish the story about why no one else knows about this place?"
“If we can’t stop these guys and the Scientist Supreme, and he can detonate the bomb, not only Alaska, but the entire west coast of Canada, sink to Attuma’s kingdom.”
“Help me get back to being myself,” Tony asked, grabbing Steve’s arms tightly. “Steve, please, help me.”
Tony could see everything in shades of red behind his closed eyelids, but he refused to open his eyes.
"It was as if a meteor had entered the atmosphere," Tony said. "Only without going through the air."
“Let’s go!” Liz smiled beautifully and Steve and Tony's heart filled. A third party grew within them, a part that none of them knew was missing, but for which both always reserved a special place.
"Will you give me coverage?" Wanda asked.
I loved you from that first moment, but I didn't know if I was allowed to say what I felt. More than that: I didn't know I was loved back. Amid so many misunderstandings, we did what we do best: we defended and fought. Until we needed to assemble to save the world, together, for the first time.
I'm thinking about the subway
“What?”
Steve narrowed his eyes.
“Underworld?” Clint said. “You mean that place where the dead go?"
Well, I already talked a lot. You can go read now 😄
Tony didn’t remember any of that, of course. But he knew the feeling. That feeling hadn’t been erased, because Tony had grown up with it, with Howard always extolling the perfection of the great Captain America and, as if that weren’t enough, the feeling had worsened after Tony had met and started working together with the real Captain. Everyone around Steve wanted to live up to the living legend, they wanted to prove their worth to the great Captain America, the one who was the inspiration of all who swore to fight for justice and freedom. Of course, nobody did. Of course, nobody
He looked at the table and bet four chips.
Let me know if you like it (know I love your comments!)
“I missed your optimism,” Tony said. “But it’s easy for you to say. You died as a martyr. I was deposed as an outcast.”
“Exactly.”
“And what path is that?”
way, it was the best thing that ever happened to us.”
“And what was it?”
Tony laughed, but the movement made his groin throb and he was reminded of why both of them were there.
to help me?”
stop,” Steve's eyes were closed and his mouth was open, trying to catch his breath, not at all being successful at that.
But Tony actually answered the call, without fear this time, because Steve was on the other side, waiting to hold him and take care of him.
Tony blinked, returning to the present, finding Steve looking at him expectantly and with an amused look. “Sorry, I was just, well, you know, thinking.”
Tony shrugged, pretending not to care, but paying attention to Steve's every reaction. "Not all of my clients are so quick to accept everything I say. Most of them think they know how to do what I do after watching a few seasons of Suits and Law and Order, and start to make guesses and criticize my job before I even start. Having someone who just says 'okay' is ... well, unusual and ..." Tony smiled, but soon tried to hide, without much success. It was ...
“Sir?” Jarvis called. “Captain Rogers is entering the laboratory.”
"And what were they?" Rhodes was still wide-eyed and listened to Tony's story with his mouth open.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Steve said, seriously.
Tony felt his eyes widen.
"I'll make an effort," Steve teased Tony's fingers absently. "Now that you're here, it's going to be easier.”
“No. He only had time to schedule the ship to leave the planet. Where she would fall would be another matter.”
Tony's eyes widened. "Like the one the rat cooks in the cartoon?"
Tony thought, now irritated.
Steve kept his head on the sofa looking at Tony, but he reached out to hold Tony's free hand while Tony stroked his hair.
When it looked like he wouldn't say anything else, Tony motioned for Steve to continue the story. It couldn't end like that. Steve laughed out loud. "So, since I had nothing left to lose, I gave her a chance. And I ended up very happy to have made that decision. We got along really well, in every way. She was my best friend, with who I could talk about everything, and we worked so well together that I saw that I could be a father if it was with her by my side. It was her who made me find the courage to bring Peter home and to realize that he's the center of my universe, especially because we both knew that she wouldn't survive long. With her I learned that I could be strong for me and for him. That I could be what he needed me to be," Steve swallowed. "That's why I left the Army when Peggy died. Peter had already lost his parents once. And he had just lost another mother. No one should lose their mother even once in their lives. He had already lost twice. I couldn't let him lose two fathers too." Steve breathed out slowly and finally looked at Tony and smiled a tired smile, but genuine and sweet, from someone who lived a good life, but with whom life liked to play bad things.
So Steve arrived back in the country back in the modest apartment T’Challa provided him, stripped off his old stealth suit and went for a long, cold shower. Even with the water running, he could still catch glimpses of Nat and Sam’s conversation in the living room, talking about the near world-ending event.
“Because the world’s fucked up, Stark’s tied to the accords, and Coulson’s SHIELD is on the run, just like us,” Sam popped in, bringing a plate of food for each of them. “Eat up.”
He never really could go long without it attached to his person. Sometimes he wondered if Tony would call that pathetic if he’d known.
." Except no words were uttered. Only a single nod and a faint twitch of lips before the man in the dirty black wifebeater collapsed halfway out of the barely running spaceship.
got back.”
Sam was in the kitchen, heating up some food their neighbor offered—they hadn’t eaten since before they finished damage control and then they’d been already on the run back to Wakanda. Nat was on the couch, flipping channels with his legs curled under her. Steve opened the fridge and took a bottle of water, and sat next to Nat on the couch.
They all had spent months training and planning for the day they took Thanos down. They were deliberate and careful and they weren't rushing into anything headfirst until every aspect was ready.
. He remembered himself, a feeling tight in his chest, words he couldn’t say out loud for months and months now:
. His fingers trembled. A second later, the shaken news reporter said, “
Then at approximately 2 AM, one of them would wake up--occasionally, even both of them--from another version of whatever twisted up nightmare their brain cooked up, and Tony would stay in the workshop until he fell asleep from exhaustion at ass o'clock in the morning, or Steve would draw on his sketchpad until his fingers bruised, and then the day repeated like a cycle.
Steve leaned in and let his head fall gently into the billionaire's chest, curling up like a scared child hiding away from a thunderstorm in his mother's embrace. Tony's hand cradled the back of his head and he only shook harder. The grip of their joined fingers tightened, a communication of words unspoken.
Tony. Tony was watching him, red rimming his tired eyes. His eyes were hooded, exhausted, pained, with guilt and sorrow and loss and shame, so intensely Steve thought he was looking at a mirror. Tony's chin trembled as Steve shook his head and let out another sob.
After three lonely months, Steve went down into Tony's untouched workshop, found a mug on the desk half filled with the last cup of coffee Tony brewed, and broke down crying.
How long would it take until someone else attempted it? Where would Steve be then?
A harsh breath, and then, “… Steve,” the voice began and no, no, no, it’s the
It didn't seem real. Nothing was. Tony had been there, earlier in the morning, kissing his lips warm and softly, and Steve had laid a hand on top of Tony's chest, feeling the heart beating underneath the thin shirt. They hadn't said goodbye, just a curt
, the headline underneath her smiling face said in bold. They talked about Pepper finally confirming the rumors, that the engagement had been off for a few months now.
It was short. And quick. And sudden. In a mockery of the Battle of New York with the Chitauri back in 2012, Thanos sent another army of mindless creatures to fend off The Avengers' attempts on stealing the infinity stones through time and space. It should have been easy--they'd fought alien creatures before, they could do it again. And they did.
was going on?
There was no goodbye letter. No last messages. Tony's last direct words to Steve was, "Fury would be rolling in his grave," and Steve's last direct word to Tony was, "Chatter!" Steve had nothing to hold on to except a dirty mug filled with mouldy coffee and a taste of ash and bile in his throat.
"What happened? Steve?
. From Earth. He was safe. He did not go after the alien ship.
and nothing made sense with him gone.
Steve got up to put his half-full plate on the kitchen counter when Nat let out a sharp gasp. “
. Exploded, like a massive firework on steroids, all smoke and ash and debris and heat and fire. There was no escape, no way for Tony to have pulled one last trick and come out of it alive. Iron Man
Steve is on the rooftop of the Stark Tower, the one Tony sold all those years ago, admiring the view as the morning light bounced off of the glass windows of the buildings around him. Some time ago, Steve guesses, flowering vines climbed up the buildings, decorating the stiff, dull skyline with bursts of colors. With his enhanced hearing, he can hear the birds chirping among the busy traffic, flying past the looming trees by the streets.
Thor would wield the gauntlet, Steve and Bruce was on defense while Carol and Nebula were on the front lines of offense, Clint and Nat guarding their backs with Okoye leading their army of soldiers with the help of Scott, Rhodes and Rocket. Nebula fought tooth and nail to claim the killing blow, and they only agreed as long as she kept Carol tightly on her six.
--bed for days. He lay, face up toward the ceiling, harsh breaths escaping his mouth, mind empty.
"Don... eve! No... leave--STEVE!"
Steve's mind supplied.
For so long he'd stayed standing as the numbers on the holoscreen rose and rose and rose and rose. But he stood. Rigid. Stoic. A captain of whatever's left of the team. Feelings pushed aside so long so he could still fight. Eyes dry but blank, mouth open but words choked, body working but tense.
Their reunion was somewhat an anti-climatic moment that starts and ends before he knew it.
Her eyes, as were Sam’s, we’re locked on the TV screen. Steve paled, and the plate in his hand nearly broke. “Is it live?”
They had half of the universe to avenge.
"I'm sorry we didn't have more time."
There was something burning behind Steve's eyelid as he sat and watched Tony sleep. It started out slow, but then all of a sudden, the world began to blur. Something rose up his throat and he choked out a low sob. When he closed his burning eyes, tears fell down his cheeks, and they kept falling. They fell, and he sobbed, until he felt his own shoulders shake. He couldn't hold it in, not anymore.
He smiles. "I know."
All of a sudden, the pain exploded from within him and he jerked in pain, and hands tightened all over him. Just as quick, everything dissipated--the pain, the warmth, the cold, the hands touching his face, Bucky's voice...
It never got better; the pain, the anguish, the regret. But it was what fueled him up and kept him standing for as long as he could.
"I wish we had more time, you and me. All those years we could have had, if only I'd realized sooner that I loved you. I still do. A lot, it hurts sometimes. It never feels real, that you're gone."
“That’s good.” Steve’s hand patted down the phone on his pocket without command. “Think he could’ve helped end the end of the world?”
. His jaw clenched and he took a quick breath. “Then we go get her. Suit up.” To the phone, Steve said, “We’ll be there.”
Fear gripped into every inch of his lungs, and Steve nearly fell on his knees. “Tony’s gone after it. Pepper and Friday have lost all contact with his suit—”
Then for the second time in his lifetime, it had begun to rain aliens, and a Titan had landed a punch on him, and then the world had turned, quite literally, into ash. Bucky. Sam. T'Challa. Wanda. One by one they had fallen into dust and Steve had fallen onto his knees next to Vision's corpse and he'd felt like a wire had clamped around his throat and he couldn't speak or yell or cry or
He remembered Tony, stripped off of all of his armors, wryly telling him that he did not deserve Pepper Potts in all of his lives. He remembered Tony, just weeks before Lagos and Leipzig and Siberia happened, tapping on a still full glass of whiskey in his hands, softly telling him
It was always at the back of Steve's mind: the battle, The Decimation, Thanos. But Steve couldn't get up. Couldn't, even if he wanted to.
, Nat had just said. How could they, when they barely made it in time all the way from here?
,” Steve’s breath rasped. Nat was already gathering her equipment back up, Sam on the phone. Phone, phone,
"I miss you, Tony," he whispered brokenly. "So, so, so much. Always. When I wake up, when I go to sleep. I always miss you."
Steve couldn’t even shut Sam up if he wanted. There, on the screen, was New York going into chaos as the camera shakily pointed at a giant, spinning, circle-shaped object hovering over the tall buildings. People were running all over the street, screaming to get as far away as possible from the unidentified object. Police were already on site, but the object looked too alien for them to take care of themselves.
Six months after Tony had exploded in the sky like a supernova, Steve shakily picked up his shield and walked into the weekly team meeting.
His eyes were still locked on the screen, analyzing, calculating. They were beginning to show more clips of amateur videos taken on the streets. His eyes flicked as the clips changed. There were glimpses of Iron Man fighting a creature in the distance. Where did he go, what were those creatures, what in the everloving
When Steve told Tony "I love you" for the first time, the other man froze. Yet Steve still stood his ground, heart in his throat, ready in case he'd been pushing his hopes too high, in case Tony bolted and decided that maybe this wasn't a good idea after all.
He trained and fought and ran the miles blindly. He'd lost the scent of Tony from their bedroom but he'd managed to coax FRIDAY into letting him watch some of old footages of Tony, just working silently and diligently on his desk in the workshop, nodding to the loud music from the speakers.
But his eyes were dry, and he lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling as Tony's scent slowly and agonizingly disappeared from the bedsheets as days and weeks and months passed.
And Steve’s mind flashed back.
And when he fell asleep, he hoped he wouldn't wake up.
Tony, who seemed to be doing well. Last heard, he finally got engaged with Pepper. Steve had tried to be happy, he really had, but he could only stare at the silent phone on his bedside, wondering if his package was sent at all, wondering if it even really mattered. Steve shook his head and wrapped himself in the towel, getting his mind back on track.
! Oh GOD! SOMEBODY HELP!"
“The video report is just minutes ago. It’s probably still happening right now,” Sam murmured. “Oh, shit. And we
It was long and brutal and ugly, and they'd lost Clint and Bruce, and it fucking hurt but Steve fought with all he had, smashing through Thanos' last army and he jumped back up every time he fell, thinking
“We can’t go on like this,” Steve sighed as he went through his late lunch, breakfast, whatever. “There’s always a bigger threat coming. That’s what Tony always used to say.”
"Ste--stay wi... eyes! Open... wake--!"
And so Steve growled into the phone, eyes still trained on the TV in front of him, still listening to the reports. “Who’s this and where’s Tony?”
"That's true. I would have waited anyway, even if you took fifty more years."
But Steve.
Tony and Steve fell into some version of normalcy in this new world: they'd wake and go on a morning run together, Steve would cook some breakfast while Tony drank some coffee and review whatever he'd worked on the night before, they'd eat together as they listened to the morning news and took a shower together and went downstairs for training, then after lunch Steve would meet with Coulson's old team and Carol and Thor and everyone else to strategize their battle plans while Tony worked with Bruce and Shuri and Lang on the Pym particles and quantum device and all the tech-sciency stuff, working on theories that Tony would later relay to Steve at night before they went to bed until Steve hummed and nodded and buried his face in Tony's neck until the older man giggled and stopped his science talk.
No wonder the Earth had been destroyed, in that other timeline Johnson spoke about. Their small team only made it in this timeline because they had been forewarned. And they’d ended the whole fucking world destruction by themselves while Steve was sipping on a cold tea staring at the kitchen wall.
Next thing he knew, Tony was being whisked away for a proper medical treatment and Steve was back into the dreadfully long talks and discussions and battle plans and the absolute self-hatred and guilt of
ate away at his conscience, Steve would lay down with tears on his cheeks and a burning fire in his chest.
Steve swallowed his dry throat and left for another fight.
. Vision.
A better question was:
Until Tony yelped, in the comms in his ears, and Steve could only watch while he slammed his shield clean off of the last alien's neck, as Iron Man shot up straight into the sky, and Steve was about to yell, "Iron Man!" in question when it happened.
“Yes, Mom.”
When Nat paused on a channel too long and the small TV showed a clip that showed Pepper Potts in a long navy dress, Steve asked not to change it. His breath caught when he listened.
, Steve listened. There was a small sigh from Nat.
Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
It was almost like yesterday that he'd spend the long nights in the kitchen in the old tower, stirring a cup of cold tea numbly after another bout of nightmares, when Tony arrived, rubbing his temples, ready to get a cup of coffee and then leaving again, only to take one look at the soldier and decide to sit down on the barstool next to him. Before everything turned to shit.
.” She pointed at the TV.
Steve's own heartbeat was loud in his ears. His thumb gently caressed the back of Tony's hand like a delicate silk, and he held his breath when Tony let out a quiet grunt and then a contented sigh in his sleep. Steve smiled and suddenly everything made sense, and so he leaned down to press his lips on Tony's warm forehead and turned to leave, only to be held back by a sudden tight grip on his arm.
"Bucky,
He took the hand in his and brought the bruised knuckles onto his lips, coating them with tears that were still falling like a waterfall. And Tony understood, and he pulled his hand close to his chest only to pull Steve's head closer with his free hand.
The screen showed the Iron Man armor shooting up into the sky, right behind the ship. No.
Steve was dizzy--from pain, or exhaustion--but he could feel the world shift as Thor collapsed. Carol ran towards the god and pulled the gauntlet from his hand, and yelled that he was breathing. Steve nodded and looked around, and his vision blurred as he noticed the fallen Wakandan soldiers began to appear out of thin air.
Except Tony was here. Alive, weeks after everyone presumed him as gone as everyone that died in The Decimation or perhaps worse. But he was breathing. His heart was beating. And suddenly there was a tiny light at the end of the tunnel, and through the choked sobs from Rhodes or the open stream of tears from Pepper, Steve could see the resolute light back in Natasha's eyes, a fraction of relief from the tension in Bruce's shoulder, the clenched fist of determination from Clint, a twitch of a smile from Thor, a curious look from the woman who called herself Captain Marvel.
"You wouldn't have wanted me to arrive too soon, anyway," Steve replies, and his chest tingles with warmth as Tony lets out a melodious laughter.
It wasn't supposed to go like this, but when had the universe ever followed their plans before?
Blinding light seeped into vision, and Steve welcomed it.
A couple of days ago, Nat had gotten a call from Fury, calling in a favor to help an old friend. It had been a long negotiation, especially concerning their status as fugitives, but Nat had finally relented. SHIELD had gone too deep in the dark with so few agents left while the situation was going south quick, and they needed all the help they could get. Steve had offered to go, as did Sam, and the three of them flew in for a quick trip, and then left before the US government officials had arrived.
The days and nights were so long now without Tony, and his bed felt cold all the time, and Steve never really slept anymore.
The TV showed a paparazzi shot of Tony, eyes shielded behind his dark sunglasses, a tiny, pressed smile quirking a side of his lips as he got into his car. A clip from several weeks ago, when he’d attended a gala in the Avengers’ name. Steve looked down on his fingers, the ones that had held on his shield as if he was about to bring it down Tony’s neck, and took a sip from his bottle.
Soon the screen switched into a clearer picture of the city.
His fingers shook when he flipped it open.
When Steve looks up, Tony's smiling face stares back at him.
Steve was bleeding. Why was he bleeding?
Steve swallowed hard as water poured over his face. He would have called Coulson team’s story crazy, except he’d crashed a plane and woken up 70 years in the future himself. It wasn’t hard to believe in crazy anymore.
, the aliens had already been dead and they were ready to call it a day and head home and then Tony
Steve ran like a horse on a whip, catching Tony as the strange blue woman staggered. For a moment his throat closed up, thinking the worst, until his finger found the pulse point of Tony's wrist and caught the irregular thrums of his blood pumping.
"Steve?"
As they got closer to The Day, Steve knew their days were numbered.
Warm, sleepy, brown eyes stared back at him with a childlike question. What happened next was almost on autopilot--Steve slipped into the blanket and laid his head on the pillow, next to Tony.
Far in the distance, a star winked. Steve closed his eyes and felt warmth running down his cheeks.
All of the Avengers were still in shock about what had happened. It felt like Tony's death wasn't real. A figment of a nightmare they'd eventually wake up from. The Compound was flooded with
“—Steve, we need your help.”
And truthfully, a large part of him didn't.
“I hope, when the threat comes—and I know it will come again—I hope it’s all been fixed. We can’t afford to save the world by being apart.”
Everyone looked up and Steve squared his jaw.
, Steve had always told himself no matter how many times Sam had reprimanded him for it.
Steve got to live again, and again, and again, and Tony got caught in one mysterious explosion and died, and life wasn't fucking fair but Steve
When they kissed, it was chaste and warm and real.
Silence.
Steve was inconsolable.
Once Steve had finished suiting up, just before he turned off the TV and locked the front door, Tony’s portrait filled up the screen and the headline beneath read,
Steve’s fingers twitched near his pocket. When did this happen, and was Tony okay?
Tony slept away, and Steve watched the warm, somewhat healthy pallor of Tony's face. Relief prodded at his skin to see the gentle rise and fall of Tony's chest. Alive, breathing, stable, no longer half dead. Slowly he stepped closer, and closer, and closer, until he felt himself falling into the plastic chair next to the bed. It took another ten minutes to gently put his warm hand on top of Tony's slack fingers.
Life went on. Without Tony, and by extension, without Steve. The rest of the team slowly stood back up after yet another loss they had to endure, and went back to work. Without Tony... Bruce, Shuri and Lang slightly struggled, but they kept going with what they have. Without Steve, Carol exchanged a nod with Thor, spoke to Nebula and kept the rest of the team together. They all had to.
There was a booming firework in the sky. The cloud was tinted a deep orange, and there was smoke up above, and falling debris, and then something fell next to his feet.
Steve now dedicated half of his days sitting in Tony's room as the other man recovered. Tony was never not working--he had a tablet in hand and FRIDAY in his earpiece, but he was explicitly prohibited from moving even an inch away from the bed until the stab wound in his abdomen completely healed. They didn't talk much, or even at all, but Tony never kicked Steve out, so he guessed that was a good thing. Instead of working, like Tony was doing, Steve just sat, and sometimes propped his arm on Tony's bed, eyes never leaving the man.
“Oh, you listened in. Why am I surprised.” Nat rolled her eyes and unfolded her legs. “What do you think?”
He shook his head and put the phone back down and slipped a shirt over his head. Once he was done dressing up, he paused before his bedroom door, picked the phone up and slipped it into his jeans’ pocket.
“I think he’d do alright.” There was nothing Tony Stark couldn’t do if he put his mind to it. “Wonder why Coulson or Fury didn’t call in the Avengers for help instead.”
And yet he couldn’t have, because he’d known he’d never deserved that chance. Not when he’d still been chasing ghost trails trying to find his lost best friend. Not when said best friend had been suspected to have murdered Tony’s parents. Not when he couldn’t bring himself to tell Tony yet.
"Come on, then," Natasha said. "Vision, you can let her go.”
“Oh.” Tony found himself thinking that Steve looked adorable with that surprised expression on his face, especially when he tried to disguise it.
“Has anyone else survived?” Sam asked.
Steve blinked, and finally their eyes met.
know everything yet," they got to the car and Tony opened the passenger door for Peter, and went on to take the wheel. "But, yes, they already know that you’re the one they’re accusing."
"Last week they found a new clue, a very promising one," Natasha lowered her voice. "A DNA sample in good condition in the garage of the old family house. It was there that the boy's body was found. The police have been keeping it isolated since then."
Steve thought for a moment.
“Any decorations?”
“If it's true, you won't mind if I do this, will you?” Tony's heart threatened to tear his chest apart.
Steve made a face at him.
"No. Maybe," Tony looked away from Rhodes. "Just a little bit. But I
Natasha looked Tony up and down and smiled. "Finally." She handed Tony the microphone and pulled Bruce back to the table.
“Where are you going?”
“Remind me not to do it again without a nice sound-isolator on. My head is exploding,” Tony's voice appeared on the comms, and Steve let out his breath. “Of course the pun was intentional.”
"Great," the pilot said. "Will go Jacques and I here.”
So Tony was now hiding in the shadows of a chimney, wearing his stealth armor, camouflaging himself in the dark, in the building across from Steve’s in Brooklyn, waiting. It was snowing, but who cares for some snow when the possibilities are so incredible? No lights had been turned on; no movement had been detected. Everything was extremely quiet on that quiet street. Tony was beginning to think that the news was, in fact, rumors, and that espionage was a beautiful waste of time. It wasn’t.
“For a master strategist you can be really oblivious sometimes.” Tony smiled.
He took a deep breath and tried to change the focus of his thoughts. His gaze ended somewhere in the back of the lab. “I got intoxicated by sex-pollen.” With the revelation seized by Tony's brain, his stomach turned to the wrong side and he felt like throwing up.
Hope you like it! Leave your comments - they are always very welcome.
“I didn’t know. I should’ve said something, but I was scared.” Steve gave a sad smile. “I wanted to respect your space. That’s when I saw your footprints in the building over there, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you could’ve reconsidered my offer to come in and talk.” The smile was happier now. “It never crossed my mind that you could be coming for other reasons.”
The world outside doesn’t exist, Tony. Neither before nor after. There are just you and me. And that’s all,” Steve smiled the brightest of smiles.
Peter looked at Tony with red, wet eyes. "You saw what they did there, didn't you?"
“I inherited the best of
He was close to his son.
“Your eyes,” Steve said.
And you can't show anything but strength when you get to that police station. They'll want to eat you alive and you can't let them know how scared you are. They feel the smell of blood. They're like hungry sharks. You have to be worse than them, understood?" Steve agreed. "Very well. How are we going to get there?"
"Because you leave clues along the way when you care about someone, Tony.”
“Yes, Captain Rogers?” the AI responded promptly.
Steve shook his head. “No. I couldn’t change the past. I tried, but I couldn’t.” Steve looked away. “I could only go through all those events again and again and again, endlessly.”
“But I didn’t know that,” Tony said, in an accusing tone. “Nobody told me anything about you actually being there.”
“I do.”
to do that?”
Tony already knew where they were going, the perfect place, away from everything and everyone, incommunicable, just the two of them. The image was so incredible that the idea of losing to Steve was tempting. But Tony had other plans.
Tony’s brain was full of cotton. He was numb with that whole statement. Steve saw him as a lifeguard. Steve saw Tony as Tony saw Steve. How was that possible? It didn’t feel right. Steve was the safe haven there, not Tony. Tony was the Bermuda Triangle, sucking everything and everyone around into chaos. He couldn’t be the beacon that led to safety. Tony’s heart was racing, responding for him, propelling him forward, but his legs were still frozen. Something was still missing ...
"To act." Tony said, opening the button on his coat. "And to try to get what I want." Without waiting for an answer from Steve, Tony turned and headed towards the stage, where Nat and Bruce were choosing the next song.
“What did they tell you?” Tony frowned at the seemingly pointless question.
“Yes, my dear.” Tony touched his face and smiled. “
“Tony...” Steve called.
"We're approaching the portal," Natasha's voice appeared on the comms. "And we already have the Dragon's look. He's huge.”
Not until that moment.
“Why don’t you just surrender?” Tony asked.
"Huhmmm ..." Steve tried, but he was paralyzed, looking at Tony, holding the mold in his hands.
Tony swallowed. Of course, it had been his idea. He knew Steve didn’t like big events, especially when he was the reason. Even if the big event in question was his funeral. Tony knew what Steve would have preferred; what Steve would have liked. Also, and that was something Tony would never admit out loud, Tony wanted to say goodbye to Steve
It took a little longer than expected, but Steve and Tony will finally find out that the family has grown.
The same reason that his self from some time ago confessed to Steve’s body after those shots on the stairway, when Tony asked for some time alone with him back at the helicarrier: it hadn’t been worth it. If the cost of defending an idea was to lose his best friend, the person Tony most admired and loved in this and all worlds, then he was not willing to pay. And he wanted to make sure it never happened again. Never.
“It’s amazing how one experience can put all others in perspective,” Steve suddenly said, without looking in any specific direction, and Tony found himself freezing in place, afraid that not even his armor’s camouflage would be able to cover him up there. “On any other day, some time ago, I would’ve said that the night could be better, with less clouds in the sky, to be able to see the moon,” Steve continued in a soft, almost dreamy voice. “But now, after everything that happened, I just feel grateful to be here and to be able to see the sky exactly as it is.”
Steve snorted. “We only argued because we wanted the same things in different ways. We believed that we knew what was best for the group. Sometimes we were able to find consensus and work together. It was incredible when it happened, remember?”
“What happened then?” Steve asked quietly, his voice troubled, any trace of disappointment from before, at the news of Tony’s corruption, gone. Who knew Tony was a good storyteller, even with memories that weren’t even his own anymore?
"Just let you know that all the other Avengers have gone to sleep."
"I love you," Steve said. “That whole conversation about waiting that is worthwhile? How long do you think I’ve been waiting to tell you this?"
“Do you want us to question someone?” Interrogations were not Tony's favorite role, he preferred to create the equipment and leave that part to the experts.
“There is only one, actually, but it is extremely important.” Strange showed the box and Tony had to admit it, it was a very nice box. Golden, full of runes and surrounded by complex arabesques.
"No. We have everything under control.”
Tony took Steve’s outstretched hand, who wasted no time, and pulled him close, holding his waist with his free hand, holding him in his embrace, as if he were afraid that Tony would try to run away again. Tony crossed his arms around Steve’s neck. They both smiled.
he thought.
feel, I need to remember to know why I’m ashamed, why I’m feeling guilty, why I’m afraid to be here.”
"I'm starting to get annoyed," Tony said. "This is taking longer than it should have.”
And that smile was only his, only Tony's.
Steve lightly smiled and intensified his moves, sucking hard now, making Tony shiver, no longer being able to stand on his own elbows, and needing to lie on the counter, moaning loudly and moving his hips toward Steve's mouth in a hurry.
“With me alone.”
"Why don’t you come up here and find out?" Tony gasped as Steve came to the crook of his neck.
"You practically screamed, Cap."
"Nothing that I have in my database, boss.”
Tony began to read the contract while having lunch and worked on the changes until shortly before the meeting, when Friday remembered him about the hour. He took a shower and went down to the hotel's meeting room, where investors were already waiting for him.
The four of them disappeared into the elevator, and silence reigned in the kitchen. Tony looked at Steve.
"Because my wife died and my son needed me."
Looking at it like that, it seems that Tony was there that day, witnessing everything up close, in order to remember so many details. Unfortunately, that day, he was being too stupid, too arrogant, too stubborn and too afraid to leave the SHIELD helicarrier to face his friend. No. Scratch that. To face his ex-friend on his way to his trial for treason. At that time, Tony was becoming familiar with the position of director of SHIELD and being too cool as the leader of the winning side to bother to go to the trial. Besides, it would be too much cowardice to rub his victory in Steve’s face at a time like that, right?
"Don’t look so confident, Katniss," Tony said with his mouth full and sat down next to Clint. "I don’t mean to lose tonight.”
“You weren’t there when I woke up,” Tony said, hurt.
how to separate things and you know it. I'm here because Natasha asked and I promised her and Steve that I would prove Peter's innocence. And that's what I'm doing. If in the process my eyes are blessed with small glances at a handsome man who happens to be my host and father of my client, is that my fault?"
Tony smirked, noticing the change in subject, but let it go. “Yes, he did. He wanted the Superhuman Records that were being held by SHIELD.” Tony saw Steve’s eyes widen and raised his hands, calming him. “That’s why I said at the beginning that, when I accepted to be Director of SHIELD, I believed that I was the best option at that time for the position. I wouldn’t do anything that shouldn’t be done with those Records. So, before handing over the house keys to Osborn, I deleted the entire SHIELD database that contained the Records, including the backups.” Tony smiled smugly.
"I know, my love.
“Nah-ah!” Tony lowered Clint's finger with one hand. “You can only bet if you’re still in the game. And, look, you're not.”
“This is a private service, Mr. Stark. For you only.” Steve smiled. “So, would you mind letting me in here?” Steve touched Tony’s forehead with his finger again.
Tony was so frustrated. He wanted to go back in time and still have his memories. He wanted to go back and find a way to fight to keep them, to remember everything, to
"I think that’s the fun of the whole thing." Nat said from across the table. Steve blinked and swallowed. His face turned red and he looked away.
Tony tried again to step out of the shadows and say something, anything, make any sound so that Steve knew he was there, but he couldn’t.
Steve started out kind of slow, but then he picked up the pace, bobbing his head, giving Tony everything he had, not only because Tony needed him to take that goddamn pollen out of him, but because, damn, Steve had dreamed of that moment, that exact moment when he’d be with Tony's cock in his mouth, feeling his weight, his taste, knowing which way to twist his tongue to pull out a wet cry of pleasure, to take Tony to paradise, to leave him so pliable, squirming with pleasure beneath him, asking for more, and all because of Steve.
Tony looked at Steve, who shrugged and smiled. How beautiful he was. And he was in love with Tony. What were the odds?
“Thanks, J. But I’ll try to handle it myself, don’t worry.” Tony crawled over to a small cabinet with drawers, trying to ignore the friction between his dick and the floor, and how good and how torturing it felt, and opened the first drawer. From there he took a tube of lube and some tissues. He sat down, leaned on his workbench, and unzipped his undersuit enough to free his cock. The breath of icy lab air on his hot skin made Tony shiver, but it reminded him of why he needed to finish that soon.
“Let's wait a little longer, then.”
"It's not easy to leave a party and fight an infernal dog," he shrugged. "But I'm fine.”
And dreams that had never come true
Tony heard all the details that Pepper passed on to him and said goodbye, not without first spending all the amazing adjectives that he remembered to thank the wonderful person that Pepper was.
"Fantastic," Steve turned, unlocked the door and put Tony's suitcase inside, locking the door again. "Can we go now?" They got in the car and headed out towards the police station.
"Ah, Steve," Tony smirked. "Nowadays, your sexuality is more important than your social security number," Tony drank the rest of the wine he still had in his glass, put the glass in the dishwasher and turned to Steve. "I loved talking to you Steve. And thanks, again, for letting me stay here. Good night."
don't need to know that. Not now, at least. Not like that."
“Yes, boss.”
Despite trying to deny it, the urgent sensation grew, taking over Tony's body and bringing the worst headache he had ever felt in his life. Shaking his head -
Steve thought, watching Wanda dodge skillfully from the onslaught of Cerberus to attack him right away with her powers. Sure that she could handle well, Steve ran toward the infernal dog's left flank.
“Good idea.”
“You don’t want to see this." Tony laughed and finished his ... well, who was counting the sake glasses, right?
"I hope the taste is as good as the smell," Tony chuckled. "I'm going to get off of you now.”
Steve looked up but didn’t find Thor. No sign of him around, at street level, either.
- Tony closed the lid of the box abruptly, making the red light disappear, but the spinning head and emptiness he still felt inside didn’t disappear with the light. On the contrary, everything has intensified. Tony got up quickly, tripping over his own feet to get to the vault door, which Tony closed without even checking if the security codes were right. Jarvis could take care of that.
Natasha's eyes widened for a second and she looked at Banner.
Tony couldn’t move. The shadows of that chimney were now his fortress and he wasn’t ready to go out and face the dragon, even if the dragon was the one that Tony had wanted to see the most in recent months.
Natasha thought.
“I guess so.”
“This is a private service, Mr. Stark. For you only.” Steve smiled. “So, would you mind letting me in here?” Steve touched Tony’s forehead with his finger again.
"I see no reason for that.”
can't," he said bitterly, sitting on the floor, all messed up, feeling humiliated, looking at Steve trying to hit him with all the sadness and sharp accusation that his gaze could show. “After all, the great Steve Rogers would
"And you managed to solve them?"
"Yes," Steve confirmed with a nod. "As we're dealing with energy readings, Thor and Vision are going too.”
“But I didn’t know that,” Tony said, in an accusing tone. “Nobody told me anything about you actually being there.”
"I tried, but the investors want the
Tony paused at the bathroom door and couldn’t contain all the butterflies that came to life in his stomach and the huge smile that appeared on his face.
"Believe it or not, I didn't have access to any personal information about any of the family members yet. Chief Ross gave me just the basics about Peter's arrest."
Or maybe it was when Steve flirted with him in Alaska for the first time.
"My God, what happened?" Steve asked, feeling his heart race again.
help you," Tony said, taking a paper out of the briefcase. "For that, I need you both to sign the contract agreeing to my services and the confidentiality of our working relationship," Tony slid a sheet of paper towards Steve and Peter, next to a pen and looked intently at Steve.
Steve looked away, but Tony saw the corner of his mouth drawn into a smile.
“I'm sorry for your loss,” Natasha said quietly.
“I'm free all day.”
Tony didn’t know if Steve was simply referring to his wardrobe. It seemed to be much more than just “you can borrow my clothes whenever you want”. It seemed deeper and more meaningful.
"I... I dreamed about you," Steve ended up saying.
"Who can predict when these things will happen?" He shrugged. "What I know is that the sooner we get used to these interruptions, the easier it gets to deal with them."
“I don’t understand,” Steve ended up saying.
Tony lowered his cup, which was getting dangerously empty. “I’m already getting there. Well, it obviously didn’t take long for Osborn to realize that SHIELD, now HAMMER, didn’t have the Records he wanted so badly, and there wasn’t a single backup in any corner of this Earth. But then, he reminded us of why we shouldn’t underestimate Norman Osborn,” Tony sighed heavily, thinking that it was from that moment that, in fact, nothing would ever be the same again. “He remembered that there was, indeed, one last backup of the Records.”
“And what do you see?” Tony whispered, out of breath.
"Why not? I can do something for you this time.”
I'm so sorry for the delay. I know I told you I'd be posting every Wednesday, but life got complicated this week. Also, this is the longest chapter so far, with so many details and information ... I hope you liked it and that this chapter can make it up to my delay.
“How many days?” Strange asked.
Tony breathed a sigh of relief.
Steve hugged Tony back with his free arm and made the engineer shiver as he kissed the curve of his neck. If it was up to Tony, the party could end there, at that moment. He was where he most wanted to be, inside Steve's embrace, with Steve in his arms, emanating love from every pore and looking. Everything was like and where it should be. But Tony still had one last surprise, and this one needed the right moment.
"We're about to find out if Pete here is ok to continue on the Avengers."
Tony cleared his throat.
"We won’t bet on anything. We’ll play for play.”
“Okay, let's turn this thing off.”
Natasha nodded.
The elevator opened and Tony finally reached his room.
"You heard our leader. Go to sleep. Or I'll call May and send you back to her.”
Tony nodded and took a sip of coffee, for the simple pleasure of taking a dramatic break. "A favor for Natasha."
"Oh,"
“Manageable.”
“Making jokes already, Cap? And we haven't even gotten there yet.” Tony smiled. "A night of surprises, it seems.”
"Tony, you know I can't-"
Tony tried to buy as much time as he could while they were at the police station, asked all the questions he could ask the annoying Chief Ross, ignored the fact that some of them he didn't even need to ask, after all, he was Tony Stark, the famous criminal lawyer from New York, capable of solving seemingly impossible cases. But even then, he tried everything. All to buy time for Pepper, who was running out of time and against logistics, and was trying to find a judge friendly enough to let the boy spend his days until the trial at home. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Peter would spend the night at the police station until his transfer to a penitentiary was promulgated by the prosecutor's office - or until he and Pepper managed to get him out.
"Good morning, Mr. Rhodes," the girl greeted with a smile. "Are you going to order the usual?"
“And how were you born?” Natasha asked.
"First of all, I wanted to apologize to you, Rhodey," Tony said.
Dignity was the last thing Tony had yet to lose completely. Yet.
"That's so unfair," Peter commented as he approached the wall. "Just a hop and he's already got up there." Without waiting for an answer, he began to climb the wall quietly.
The Tower's emergency alarms went off suddenly: an enemy had invaded the building's perimeter without alerting any of the radars.
Steve stopped with his mug in the air, halfway to his mouth, and looked at Tony through the reflection in the window glass. “Can you really?”
“Did you find anything interesting that I should know?” Steve asked after a few minutes. His voice was amused.
“I think that’s it, then,” Steve said at last, when it became clear that Tony would remain hidden and silent. Steve’s face changed. His eyes fell, sad and disappointed, his mouth curved down and he stepped away from the roof rail. “Maybe next time, right?” Tony saw that he tried to smile, but failed. And with that painful scene to see, Steve turned and went into his apartment, leaving Tony alone again.
The world outside doesn’t exist, Tony. Neither before nor after. There are just you and me. And that’s all,” Steve smiled the brightest of smiles.
"You’re in my shirt."
“Everything I wanted most when I saw you that day,” Steve continued, his voice stronger, more confident. “Was to come to you and say that I wanted that fight to end. The problem is that, at the time, we both wanted it, but on our terms. The War blinded us. We talked and talked and talked.” Steve sighed. “We walked through the mansion’s gardens and, after I told you why I thought I was right, you told me that I was a blind man who never saw how inadequate everyone has always been around me. How
“What happened?” Tony looked around and found himself with an IV, which he immediately removed, not knowing if it was important. He looked at his own body and found himself only in sweatpants, shirtless and with bands around his belly and head.
“What's so important here, anyway? Why so much concern about a box?”
"Imagine what the rest of the day holds," Natasha said.
“You gonna get infected too, you know that, right?”
“Hello, Liz.”
“For a birthday party. The most spectacular birthday party New York has ever seen.”
“What happened?” Peter asked as he removed his mask.
gift." Tony managed to find the right words to form a coherent phrase while Steve's hand involved his balls. “It’s you who should enjoy it.”
“I love you so much,” Steve said when he pulled away.
"Tell me more about that."
"Okay," she smiled. "I already sent the invitations. Our friends have already confirmed their presence, only the authorities are missing.”
, it is Captain America who is with you. You’re not completely lost
Tony shrugged. "Everything."
“Twenty-two hours without interruption.”
"Love you too," Steve hung up the phone and went to answer the door. He didn't know what he was expecting, but, well, it definitely wasn't that. "Hello?" Steve greeted, and frowned when the intonation was a question.
"What are you talking about, Steve?" Natasha asked, clearly confused.
Tony couldn't help the bitter laugh that came out of his nose. “You're unable to even say that you would’ve to fuck me, Steve.” The laugh died. “Leave me alone.” But inside, that little voice was screaming a big Stay with me, please. It was fighting, urging someone to let it out, someone to hear, but Tony remained silent.
"Steve will be so proud of you."
"You look for each other in the crowd," she said. "When you and Tony walked away yesterday and went round the party, every few seconds you two looked away from your conversations, scanned the party until you found the other, smiled lightly, and returned to your conversations.”
Tony saw Steve shaking his head, outraged, and mentioning getting up, but Natasha stopped him by holding him by his shirt. "Pay attention." Tony read her lips. Steve didn't sit down again, but his eyes remained fixed on Tony, mesmerized.
"Tony, you don't owe me an apology for anything," Rhodes said after a long sip of his cappuccino. "By the way, if you knew I was involved, would you have dropped the case?" Rhodes smiled.
Steve thought, raising his shield to defend himself from a bite of Cerberus's left head.
Steve stepped back to look at Tony.
So why that affection? Why that understanding? Why was he being so ...
May the countdown to their weekend begin!
"Are you sure?" Tony still didn't seem very convinced.
“Shhh, it's all right now, sweetheart. It's all right.”
Tony still couldn’t get out of the entrance to the room. He was mesmerized. Steve was there, closer than he had been in the past few hours, in the past few months, moving, breathing.
"But tell Natasha I'm home. Only her." He said already inside the Avengers' exclusive elevator. "Tell her I'm exhausted and I’m going to sleep to be presentable for the party.”
“Come,” Steve said, taking her hand. “We'll show you your room, all the facilities in the Compound, and more importantly, we’ll introduce you to the whole team officially.”
"You noticed," Steve said in an amused voice.
While Tony was frantic, Steve was in a trance. “Whatever you want.”
Everyone expected it to happen, but not so fast. The incursion had arrived much sooner than it was anticipated and that was a surprise indeed, after all, Tony Stark never missed his calculations. But now there was no time to think about what could have gone wrong, what comma had been put in the wrong place, or which decimal place had been skipped. Now, the most important thing was to finish the only way to get someone alive out of that incursion.
Before Steve could say anything, Tony wrapped his fingers in his hair and pulled him, sticking their mouths together. Steve wrapped Tony in his arms and slid his hands down his back, finally without shame, without any fear of being caught. It was just the two of them and their desire for each other.
Taking a deep breath and letting the freezing air of that night enter his lungs, Tony turned the door handle that gave access to the apartment and entered, feeling the breath of hot air, bringing in the smell of coffee, clean clothes and the soap that Steve used. Tony let himself smell those scents for a second or two before entering the apartment completely and closing the door behind him.
