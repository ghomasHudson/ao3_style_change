I laughed, “Shut up!”
Sherlock hummed and moved his kisses down my neck. I tilted my head to the side to allow him more access, against my better judgement, but it just felt so damned good. The dressing gown I wore had slipped slightly, exposing my bare shoulder.
He cleared his throat and looked at me briefly before returning his gaze to the violin in his hands, “Listen, John… I’m sorry about last night. I didn’t want you to see that. I lost control yesterday and…”
Wilson nodded, “I couldn’t understand it so I went to the office to check and the building was empty. That’s when I decided to involve the police. I thought something sinister might be going on.”
Once Mrs. Hudson had declared she was going to make tea, Sherlock had turned away from me and pushed himself forcefully out of the desk chair. He fiddled with his suit jacket for a moment, I think mostly to avoid eye contact with anyone in the room, before taking up his violin and collapsing into his armchair. He closed his eyes and began to pluck discordantly on the strings, the dissonant sound filling the flat.
“I feel terrible…” he mumbled, averting his eyes.
I'm SO sorry for the wait but I had some trouble writing this scene. It was hard to get it right but I think it's pretty good :/
“I’m fine,” he said this with such venom that I was completely taken aback. He turned on his heel and moved to leave.
One time I was so close to entering his bedroom when the door slammed right in my face. I took that as a hint that he wanted to me to stop worrying about him and creeping to his door in the middle of the night.
He took a few shaky breaths and rested his head against the back of the couch. He closed his eyes and for a short while he seemed to calm but then he began to become tense again, “Every time I close my eyes… I see him… I’m back there again…”
Sherlock got to his feet and began pacing up and down the length of the living room, “Well, we have been sharing a bed for the past few months and I know that you have developed romantic feelings for me, but what I’ve been trying to discern for a while now is what this means for us.”
He turned and stormed past me to the bathroom, preparing to clean his teeth, “I’m tired John. Can you just drop it?”
“What are you doing?” I asked curiously.
I stood by the laptop, watching the messenger chat, before surveying the different coping mechanisms on show from everyone in the space. I clenched and released my left hand, before excusing myself to get changed into proper clothes. Half of my things had been moved into Sherlock’s room by this point, so I retreated to the downstairs bedroom to find a cosy jumper to wear as though it were a bullet proof vest. Much like Sherlock, I felt as though I was donning armour for battle. It also gave me something to focus on other than the thick atmosphere in the flat.
He nodded and opened his laptop, clearly savouring putting his mind to work, even in a small capacity. I nodded to myself, pleased that he was occupying his mind in some way, and headed towards the kitchen, putting the kettle on. As it boiled, I poked my head around the corner of the kitchen and watched Sherlock as his dexterous digits tapped at the keyboard. The very sight of Sherlock’s mind at work made me smile, but it faded just as quickly as I realised what was wrong with that very mind and what it was researching. As I watched Sherlock’s pale brow crinkle, and I felt a calm resolve harden inside me. I was going to get him better. There was no other alternative.
I felt slightly uncomfortable about our proximity, thinking worriedly that Sherlock might have interpreted the events of last night differently (although I wasn’t too sure how I interpreted last night, but that was a problem for another day) I linked my arm gently through his without even really realising what I was doing.
I looked down at the floorboards and blew a sharp breath out through my nose. He was right, of course… wasn’t he always? The idea of deliberately putting Sherlock in Moran’s path to draw him out made every instinct I had scream in protest… but continuing to live with the shadow of Sebastian Moran haunting us made me sick to my stomach.
Sherlock grumbled, “Stop that, it tickles.”
“Oh, I’m sorry to disturb you dears, but Detective Inspector Lestrade is in the living room and I didn’t want him to barge in here and find you in a compromising position,” Mrs Hudson said, giggling to herself as she said the word ‘compromising’.
Sherlock looked back at me suspiciously, “It was odd. Like it wasn’t me who was controlling my limbs… but it was nice…”
Sherlock nodded and smiled a tiny smile before turning back to the shower. I closed the door and returned to the living room, lying on the couch feeling completely drained, emotionally and physically. I closed my eyes and saw only Sherlock as I drifted into blissful sleep.
He gazed at me in the mirror and I placed my hand over one of his clammy ones, “We can get through this. I promise I will not let him lay a finger on you while there is breath in my body.”
He tensed momentarily before crumbling completely in my arms. He broke down, taking in heaving breaths as my shirt became damp with his silent tears. I then spotted marks on his back; long red marks criss-crossing the pale flesh, and I knew exactly how he got them. He was whipped as well.
“Oh Sherlock, it’s so lovely to hear your voice again,” said a gravelly voice, with a slight hint of an Irish accent.
“No, I meant these,” I traced the small scars with my index finger.
“He shouldn’t be working cases if he’s suffering as much as you say,” Greg said.
Gunfire. All I could hear was the explosions of gunfire. All I could smell was Sherlock’s hair under my nose where my face was pressed against his head. All I could feel was the hammering of my heart in my chest and the throbbing of my leg. The room was dark, and I couldn’t see a thing. This was all I could register for what felt like hours but really was only a few minutes.
‘I’m glad you’re eating,” I said as he went back to his soup. “We need to get some meat back on those bones!”
He then snapped out of it and staggered back a few steps, “Fine! I’m… fine,” he said before I even asked him anything. “I need some air…”
“Aren’t we going to the League’s offices first?” I asked in confusion.
I groaned again but this time more out of protest than pain, “Beauty huh? I can live with that!” I winced as I rolled my shoulder again.
Sherlock let go of me and stumbled backwards into the mantel, eyes wide and unblinking, breathing wildly and uncontrolled. I turned to him, a hand over my mouth in horror, “Sherlock, oh god, I’m so, so sorry! I didn’t mean to… I just, I didn’t think…
Here's the next one with some fluff and a confused John ;)
“Sorry,” I said.
He sobbed again before growling angrily, “Why am I crying?”
“My conclusion is that ever since I got back, you have become more emotionally attached and even physically attracted to me,” Sherlock concluded.
It started off as a peaceful melody and I found myself quite content to lie in my flat mate’s bed listening until it started to take a more disturbing turn. The notes became all minors, flats and sharps, and the way Sherlock was playing becoming more erratic and violent with each stroke of the bow.
The cabbie sped off quickly, as eager to get away from the warehouse as I felt. I wished I could bundle Sherlock back into the warm car and go home to curl up with him on the couch or in our bed. But wishing wouldn’t do us any good. I squared my shoulders and moved to stand beside Sherlock. I grasped his gloved hand and squeezed it briefly. We exchanged a sombre look before I dropped his hand and we made our way into the warehouse through a rusty door that creaked ominously on its hinges.
“Shut up!” Sherlock bellowed.
I cleared my throat and averted my eyes before changing the subject, “So, um, do you want some tea? Or, or maybe something to eat?”
Sherlock’s eyes lit up with the intensity of a deduction, “Yes, it is sick. But it means he was masturbating while we were talking, and he took this photo after he was done. Which means he thought he’d won, and he wasn’t being careful in his… fervour. The arrogance! He wasn’t thinking clearly! And because the photo is from a different device and it was a spontaneous, personal message, it must have been taken on his personal phone…”
Sherlock quirked a non-committal eyebrow in my general direction before looking at his watch. The action prompted me to mirror it; 11:30.
We watched Sherlock play in silence before he quietly asked me, “So, how long has this thing between you two been going on?”
“What is it dear?” Mrs Hudson asked.
Sherlock nodded, biting his lip as though afraid to make any sound. I claimed his lips as I worked his boxers off, letting him kick them to the side. I sat back to remove my own, only to find Sherlock following me as he braced himself onto his elbows. I removed my boxers as Sherlock watched me intently, running a hand over my body to feel my scar on my shoulder.
“Maybe I just don’t care!” I said nonchalantly, walking out the door and into the kitchen where Greg turned towards me.
She snorted, “Okay, poor choice of words, but my point still stands!”
“Okay, clearly telling you was a terrible idea," I grumbled, not liking being teased.
“Hmm, that’s a pleasant response. You like that?” This time when he kissed, his clever tongue flicked out against my hardening nub.
I laughed and shook my head, “It’s just… I’m so confused because I’ve never had an attraction to men before, or at least I don't think I have. Surely it's too late for me to be having an identity crisis! But Sherlock… I don’t know what it is about him but, he’s the most amazing person I’ve ever met.”
“Ugh! It hasn’t helped!” he exclaimed, sitting up to face me and pulling his knees up underneath his chin as he sighed, frustrated, “I thought having more data would help but it hasn’t!”
Everyday his face looked more drawn and gaunt from exhaustion. I tried to talk to him about it but he always shut himself off as soon as I got close to making any progress in obtaining some indication of what was going on.
Sherlock sat up again and averted his eyes, “I would like to research post-traumatic stress so I know what‘s happening to me.”
He said nothing but simply nodded and rubbed at his head with a hand, revealing some of the scars I had discovered last night. I looked away and started the bathwater with a knot in my stomach. As the bath filled up, I set about finding Sherlock a towel, soap and other necessities so that I didn’t have to look at him; because it broke my heart.
He looked at me gingerly, “I… I don’t know if… if I can…”
Sherlock looked over his menu with a cheeky look in his eye. I shook my head before consulting my menu. We ordered quickly and as soon as we were alone, I reached across and grabbed the detective’s hand.
“I’m okay, love. Just a flesh wound…”
I hummed and leant further back into Sherlock’s embrace. He continued assisting me as we played slowly through ‘London Bridge’, but Sherlock began to nibble on my ear, making concentrating very difficult.
We sat like that in comfortable silence, me playing with Sherlock’s curls and him nuzzling into my neck, until he mumbled something unintelligible into my clavicle.
I nodded. Of course, I would never consider springing this revelation on him in his current state. But, it was definitely going to be easier said than done to keep a lid on my new and confusing feelings. I just had to make sure that Sherlock was focused on healing, maybe he wouldn't even notice...
I decided just to let this strange affair unfold without pushing Sherlock for details. He was happy so I was happy. Sherlock placed a hand on my thigh and squeezed, bringing a smile to my face, before returning his hand to his lap and tapping impatiently on his leg.
He pulled away and stated, “Now, let me look at that leg. The bandages probably need changing.”
Then Sherlock whispered brokenly into my ear, “Make me feel John, please. Make me feel something, be my distraction…”
“Jesus,” he muttered, before placing it on the desk for Mycroft to see. “I’ll get my guys on it right away, see if we can trace where it came from. Maybe we’ll be able to get a lead.”
Sherlock sighed theatrically, “As usual John, you are completely wrong! I’m the lucky one. You’ve taken such good care of me over the last months. I was so lost and you were so amazing. You are the most wonderful person I’ve ever met. I’ve never known anyone like you John.”
Sherlock pulled back and cleaned me up too when I heard him sniff and wipe at his eyes.
I looked to Mycroft with what must have been a wild look of desperation and horror because he paled and leaned on his umbrella for support, “Moran…”
“Hello, sorry I was wondering if you could direct me to the London Eye? I haven’t been in town very long, sorry,” Sherlock babbled as though he were a flustered tourist. “Would you mind awfully coming and showing me…?”
Again he shook his head with a shrug, “I didn’t see the point. Seemed tedious.”
When I returned to the bedroom door and saw the man himself dozing with his mouth slightly parted and his dark hair a chaotic mess on the pillow beneath him, I was warmed to my very core with the strength of my affection for him. I was about to go and tuck myself up next to Sherlock when there was a loud and urgent knock on the front door.
Enjoy and thank you for your support!
He didn’t say anything. It was as though he was completely taken over by sensation that he had no words so he just nodded vigorously, grinding down slightly onto my massaging fingers, eyes wide with wonder. I smiled and felt slightly proud that I had this effect on him. Medical knowledge of how to massage the perineum was certainly coming in handy. I kissed and licked at the head of his cock some more, occasionally looking up to tell Sherlock to resume breathing, to which he would reply his usual “breathing is boring” line, but did as I said in order for me to resume.
I shook my head with a sigh, “Okay, whatever you say!”
Sherlock shook his head, clamping his eyes shut. I sighed; he must have been drugged as well, perhaps some kind of date rape drug? I had to convince him to take them, but how?
“I’m okay, John. My body may betray me like this,” he regarded his trembling hands with contempt, “but my mind feels clearer than it has in a long time. We are going to take out this vile excuse for a human being so we can finally move on with our lives.”
Sherlock gaped at me, lips beautifully parted, eyes wide, “My thoughts exactly.”
Only when Moran had been scooped off the pavement, bundled into the back of a police car and removed from my line of sight did I register the pain in my leg and the new throbbing of my knuckles. I also realised that I was shaking, and that Sherlock was saying my name.
Sherlock looked at me, then regarded his already half empty bowl and smiled back pensively, “I guess.”
Sherlock opened his eyes and watched my fingers again, “Moran got a bit excited when he found a branding iron…”
Anyway, a really short chapter here cause it was all I could manage over the holidays (I have been so busy its crazy)
“I don’t know…” he began. He turned away from me and crossed to stand facing the mantle, “I, uh, I don’t know… um, how things like this work, is all. I’m not sure I could… give you what you need…”
Sherlock smiled half-heartedly and got to his feet with a grunt. He placed a hand on my shoulder and we walked to the couch where Sherlock sunk into it. I rummaged around and found his laptop, bringing it over to him and placing it in his lap. I sat down next to him before he could get too engrossed in his research.
“John, so close…”
He shrugged his bare shoulders like a petulant teenager and mumbled, “I don’t feel well…”
When Harry had gone, I went to my armchair and sat down with my laptop, watching Sherlock compose his new piece in contented silence.
I registered vaguely that I should be the one saying that to Sherlock as opposed to him trying to snap me out of my reverie. I lifted my head and registered that all the thugs with guns who had surrounded us were now on the ground, some moving and some not. Men in full tactical armour were moving around the warehouse and securing the scene.
I was sitting in my armchair while Sherlock sprawled on the couch, fingers steepled under his chin staring off into nothingness. I was glancing over my blog and stealing glances in Sherlock’s direction. We sat like this for a while until Sherlock sat up abruptly, eyeing me with his deduction face on.
Sherlock dropped the violin on my armchair, running his now free hand down over my boxer covered hip, down my thigh. In a desperate need for support I grasped around behind me where I found Sherlock’s left cheek, squeezing hard.
I beamed at him and shook my head, capturing his lips once more. This relationship was going to be trickier than I had anticipated…
Sherlock moaned like a grumpy teenager, “No! I’ve been resting and…”
I moved my hands towards my belt and undid it slowly. Sherlock licked his lips and took a step forward, eyes glued to my hands. I threw the belt to the floor and undid my trousers slowly, determined to give him a good show.
Mycroft averted his eyed from my own piercing, rage filled gaze, “For the moment, he is still free but in deep hiding. Our attempts to capture him obviously spooked him. He’s gone underground with no trace… What you must know is that Sherlock is fragile at the moment, mentally and physically. He spent two months in physical rehab and another three getting mental assistance. I want you to be careful John. He’s not in his right mind at the moment and you will have to take extreme caution and care when treating him. I know you’ll take care of him John, you always have, but this time… Sherlock is so… I just hope that we aren’t too late…”
Feedback on this would be great cause this is their first big kiss so it would be great to know what y'all think :)
“I was with two guards and Moran was driving in the front. I was chained to the floor of the van but I managed to subdue the guards without too much trouble but then I had to get out of the chains.
“Oh, John, I think this is the perfect case to get me back on my feet,” Sherlock answered joyously as a cab pulled up. He opened the door for me and then followed me into the cab. “Coburg Square please.”
I have often called Sherlock a child but he had never looked more like one now as he backed away, looking as though he had just disappointed his mother; submissive, shy and scared. I had never seen Sherlock like this and it threw me off guard.
Sherlock groaned, rolling his hips towards me in an attempt to find some kind of friction. The musky smell of Sherlock’s cock was intoxicating and frightening. How could this be so arousing? I decided to leave what I was originally planning for another time when I was more confident so I made my way back up Sherlock’s body, lifting his arms up to rest above his head.
We both chuckled breathing in each other’s breath, resting our heads on the each other’s forehead.
My fingers clenched on the back of the desk chair Sherlock had seated himself in. I kept my mouth shut through sheer force of will, because I knew I couldn’t control the words that would come out if I did. The last thing I wanted was to upset Sherlock further with my rage.
I tried to catch his flailing arms, all the while crooning soft words of comfort. Eventually, his struggles became weaker and weaker, until he slumped limply into my arms, exhausted. His breathing was still laboured, he was shaky and sweaty from his struggle, but I held him nonetheless.
Sherlock regarded me levelly, “I have noticed something lately. About you.”
Both Holmes brother turned to me. Sherlock smiled, looking relieved that I was more alert again. Even Mycroft looked relatively pleased that I wasn’t dying, which from him was equivalent to weeping with joy.
Greg nodded and led them towards one of the conference rooms, “Mr Jabez Wilson came to us this morning with a very curious problem. Considering he thinks you are unavailable for the moment, Sherlock, he came to us instead of to you. He’s in here. I’ll let you interrogate him yourself but I can assure you you’re going to like this one!”
“Oh shit…” I said dazedly, realising that it really was a lot of blood as I slumped to the side, feeling suddenly lightheaded.
As Lestrade’s officers got in place around the door, Sherlock hung back with his mouth set in a firm line. Lestrade opened the door and the officers piled into the vault, leaving us on either side of the door. What we found was a most peculiar sight; three men, one with the most outrageous ginger hair, one was Vincent Spaulding and the other a nondescript plain sort of fellow, all standing with bags of money next to a hole in the floor.
Sherlock smiled a wry smile that didn’t reach his eyes, “I'm not sure exactly, it's all a bit blurry. Nine months, or a year maybe? Something like that. I spent two years hunting down Moriarty’s followers and even though I kept a low profile, eventually I got noticed. Moran found me and uh…”
I nodded, thinking. The fact that I wanted sex with another man at all was terrifying, but I knew that after what Sherlock had been through, the sexual abuse he endured, what I was feeling must be ten times worse for him. He was so timid and new to this, whatever it was we had, so I said carefully, “That’s okay. I’m not sure I’m ready yet either.”
I recognised the same symptoms as before; he was having another flashback but this one was a lot more severe. Sherlock was shaking so badly that his knees buckled under him and he crumpled to all fours.
“It was personal. The photograph was personal,” Sherlock breathed, eyes eager.
Sherlock scanned the street before getting unsteadily to his feet and crossing the road to the bank. I followed close behind, keeping a worried eye on him. As we reached the bank, Lestrade came around the corner and approached us.
I was surprised when Sherlock didn’t complain, merely nodded silently. I looked him over and noticed that he still seemed to have that faraway look. As I began making him some soup, I asked him as casually as I could, “Did you sleep well?”
What if I pushed him too far too fast? It would freak him out. It would probably freak me out too. I had never been with a man before and although the taste of Sherlock still on my tongue was wondrous, my desires towards him were freaking me out a little bit.
“Hmm?”
Moran tutted, “Such bad habits you’ve learned my pet! Clearly Dr. Watson doesn’t know how to discipline you. Perhaps I can educate him…”
He grasped at his head with one hand and clutched with white knuckles to his thigh. I grasped his shoulder tightly spoke to him sternly but calmly, “Sherlock, listen to me. Focus on my voice and tell me what’s going on.”
Sherlock’s openness in our relationship astonished me. I had thought it would be strange to be close to him romantically, like I would be getting disembodied fingers for valentine’s day or something, but he was surprisingly open, even romantic.
Greg spoke up, “I noticed something about the…”
“A robbery,” Sherlock said, as he strode into the bank with what I knew to be false confidence, “an armed robbery at that.”
“It’s okay, Sherlock,” I whispered, not letting go of the far too thin body, “I’m not upset, I just want to help.”
“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Sherlock said quietly. “No promises, there's always consequences…”
“No.”
“Good morning,” I replied as he finished with a flourish right in front of me. I ran a hand through Sherlock’s sleep tousled hair, “That was lovely.”
Boy, this chapter was so hard to write. I have redrafted it many times and I think I am finally happy with it. Only a few more chapters to go I reckon! Thank you all so much for sticking with me to get this far! It looked like I was never going to be able to finish this story for a long time, but I'm so glad that I came back to see it through.
I dont write much of it so I hope it's okay :)
Sherlock regarded me evenly, rubbing against my leg in return, “Why? I don’t understand.”
“Well, I have a little tobacconist’s shop on the corner of Coburg Square but business has been slow lately so when I got this message, well I leapt at the opportunity! So I left my shop in the hands of my assistant, Vincent Spaulding. When I showed up at the given time at an address on the other side of town, and a man called Duncan Ross met me in a dingy little office, telling me what I had to do.
I nodded understandingly, cupping his face supportively, “It’s okay. I understand, but I’m going to and you’re going to watch, alright? For future reference.” I said with a smile before pecking his lips and moving up on the bed.
I pulled back and led him to the bedroom, “Why don’t we just pleasure ourselves instead?”
I smiled and shook my head fondly. Of course Sherlock had memorised my sleep habits. I’m sure most people would find that off putting but I found it rather sweet. I hummed in acknowledgement of his answer and took a sip of tea.
Thanks for the lovely comments and for your patience as I continue this story. I'm really excited about this chapter and the ones to come!
“That’s great John! That sound like a compliment to me, albeit a Sherlock-style one,” Harry said with a grin.
We exchanged goodbyes and I ended the call. I went back to my laptop but only for a minute or so before Sherlock padded shakily into the lounge.
It was clear that Sherlock didn’t really understand why talking about it would help by his unconvinced expression and submissive posture. He was still worried that he had upset me in some way so I did the only thing that made sense to me.
I stopped dead in my tracks before reaching up to Sherlock’s neck where his scarf had come lose. I gently pulled his scarf off entirely and pushed his collar down.
He quickly vanished from the doorway and soon after I could hear the water being turned on in the bathroom. I looked around to see where my cane might be so that I could make my way to the kitchen, only to discover that it was propped up against the table on my side of the bed. Sherlock must have left it there for me, knowing that I wouldn’t want to wait around in bed.
“I think I’m in love with Sherlock,” I blurted. As soon as the words had left my mouth I regretted it. I think I even stopped breathing as I looked at Mrs Hudson wide eyed, hoping that she wouldn’t laugh. I wasn’t even sure what her reaction would be actually, I just hoped she wouldn’t judge me or something.
As Sherlock moved closer to us, he said with a slight tremble in his voice, “Given the nature of his threat, we must assume that he is close by, probably in London somewhere.”
‘No! Ew! I mean to help you both understand what you’d be doing! You both wouldn’t be so scared if u knew what to expect ;)’
, I thought as I shielded the man I loved from the hail of bullets ricocheting around us.
He looked down at our hands and smiled grimly before nodding. I decided to reassure him further, “I don’t have to leave just yet, so I can sit with you for a little while longer.”
“John, surely if he didn’t feel comfortable with you helping him out, you would know about it. I think you just need to get him better and wait and see. In the meantime, don’t feel ashamed of your… I dunno, urges or whatever.”
Enjoy!
I cocked my head to the side as I looked at him curiously, “You’ve thought about kissing before then?”
In need to touch Sherlock, I ran my free hand over his torso, finding one of his pecks and squeezing it lightly, making Sherlock groan around my finger. The rumble of his deep baritone around my finger was a delightful sensation that made me feel light headed.
As I rubbed Sherlock's back, he tried valiantly to get control of his breathing. Eventually, his breathing slowed down but each inhale and exhale was shaky as he tried to regain control of his body through sheer force of will.
Sherlock surveyed the room grimly, before walking to my chair and holding out his hand. I stood immediately and took it without hesitation. He pursed his lips at me in acknowledgement and we made our way over to the laptop where a new message was blinking on the screen:
The next few minutes were fuzzy, but I vaguely registered more voices around me as I was being moved around. I closed my eyes and listened dimly to the voices as my body started swaying backwards and forwards. Presumably, I was being moved out of the factory on a gurney, but I found that I really didn’t care that much. The painkillers were quite nice.
Sherlock’s burnt neck was prominent in the light, as where the ugly red scars around his wrists. There were small scars and cuts all over his abdomen and lower torso but the worst sight by far was the huge, albino-white scar running from his right clavicle, across his chest and finishing just below his left nipple.
I woke up the next morning to soft light emanating from behind the closed curtains. I was in our shared bed in Sherlock’s room and gently stretched out my aching limbs. I closed my eyes again briefly and took stock of how my body was feeling. My right thigh was throbbing with a dull ache and seemed to be aggravating a slight psychosomatic pain in my knee. Or perhaps it was just bruised as the left one also felt a little sore, probably from when I pushed Sherlock to the ground the night before. My shoulder was also stiff, as it appeared that I had hardly moved from the position I had fallen asleep in. Sherlock and I had managed to drag ourselves up the stairs and stay awake long enough to get undressed, before collapsing in a exhausted heap. I had been probably been pressed up against Sherlock all night…
“Where’s Moran?” I asked again, pushing myself upright slightly as the paramedics finished stitching my leg and began bandaging it.
Sherlock grinned and raised his eyebrows at me, saying with a laugh, “Whichever helps you sleep at night my dear doctor!”
As I waited, my gaze wandered over to Sherlock and I began taking in every detail before I even knew it. His cheekbones, his eyes, and his Cupid’s bow lips that looked so enticingly kissable… I wondered what it would be like to have my own lips pressed against his, to ravish his mouth…
He released a shaky breath and said in an unstable voice, “I realise that John. Unless there’s something you can do to s-stop it then… ah, I s-suggest you drop the matter…”
“I’ll leave you to it then,” Mycroft said, heading towards the door. I nodded, not bothering to see him out, before steeling myself and heading towards the bathroom. I knocked on the door to make sure my flat mate was decent, mostly for my sake.
Enjoy!
“So, um,” he cleared his throat, “do I kiss you now?”
I would’ve said more to reassure him, but someone shoved a tube towards my face and told me to breathe in. I inhaled the painkiller that was in the tube and felt quite suddenly as though I was floating on a cloud. I promptly inhaled some more.
“Nothing much,” he said with a sigh. “Just the usual; Moran, chains, a branding iron…”
Sherlock Holmes is on a new case this chapter! Yay! This case is inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's 'The Red-Headed League' story :)
I got up and grabbed his arm to prevent him. When my hand landed on his forearm he shied away with such severity that he jumped back and stumbled into Lestrade’s filing cabinet with a crash.
“Sherlock, we’ve been through this. I can’t help you if I don’t know what’s wrong.”
“Yes, thank you for your assistance but… I need to leave… now…” and with that, Sherlock was off, staggering around the corner of the alley.
Sherlock clasped his hands behind his back and took another step towards me, “And now, I’m thinking that you should come and have lunch with me.”
He nodded, “I woke up and you weren’t here…”
I was jerked awake by a terrible noise echoing through the flat. I sat up frantically and realised where the noises where coming from. I jumped up and rushed to Sherlock’s door and sure enough, I could hear him yelling and pleading in his sleep.
I glared half-heartedly at him before paying the cabbie as we arrived at our destination. The tobacconist shop was small and dark; Sherlock approached and took in every detail. He spun around abruptly, almost flicking me with the tails of his coat, eyes darting around the square and taking in every other building in the vicinity. He walked to the end of the street, looked around and returned to the front of the shop.
Then something churned uncomfortably in my gut as I stepped into the shower and a new thought occurred to me… Moran had used Sherlock in the most appalling way, a way that made Sherlock think he was ugly and broken. The anger that suddenly coursed through my veins was fierce, but I tamped down on it. I wouldn’t let Sherlock see my fury. No, I would save every last ounce of it for when I got my hands on Moran.
“Then what do I do?” Sherlock cried, looking at me with wide, frightened eyes, “I don’t know what’s… I just, don’t… and…”
I let go of Sherlock’s hand hastily as Greg regarded the genius, “Well, um, the Red-Headed League case you gave me? The reason Wilson was contacted was not for his hair but rather his tobacconist shop around the corner. Quite an inventive way to get him off the premises in fact, while Spaulding and his associates tunneled from their basement, under the road to here.”
He nodded but I wasn’t sure I believed him as I looked him over. He looked panicked so I went over to the coffee table and sat in front of him, “Are you sure?”
“Shhhhh, is alright, it will stop, don’t worry,” I rubbed a soothing hand over his back and he started looking even paler than before.
He huffed out a chuckle at that.
I smiled reassuringly at him and led him to the couch where I gently pushed him down onto the cushions, “First of all, I’m going to get you something to eat…”
I noticed Sherlock walking off slightly gingerly, like a dog caught sleeping on its owner’s bed.
Only a short chapter before Christmas. Been busy, sorry guys! Bit of a case and a bit of fluff. What else do you need for Christmas! :)
“I know, you’re right. I just… I hate this plan,” I said through gritted teeth.
Sherlock started shaking his head, “That’s the thing with Moran, he thinks he’s clever enough to get out of any trap we set for him. So, we use his confidence against him and be ready for anything.”
I smiled and nodded ruefully. Sherlock snuggled closer once again, looping his leg over mine. He sighed as he began idly kissing the flesh of my bare chest, “I love the way you taste. Kissing never made sense to me before now, but with you I can’t imagine anything more right…”
Sherlock turned to look at me with a fear in his eyes that hadn’t been there for a while. I touched his face delicately and he took a calming breath. His hands were still shaking though, so I took them in mine and squeezed them reassuringly. They stopped shaking so violently but Sherlock still looked pale.
I climbed the stairs slowly, trying to push all thoughts of what Mrs Hudson and I had just discussed out of my mind so I could focus on talking care of Sherlock and helping him heal. When I reached the top of the stairs I found Sherlock sitting on the couch with his knees tucked under his chin.
True I had wanted this for months. In particular the last few weeks I had been waking up in Sherlock’s arms with a screaming hard on. Not even doing anything, just him touching me skin on skin, was enough to get me hard.
I was shaking my head before he had even finished speaking, “No, Mycroft. Absolutely not. It’s too much of a risk! He’s your own brother, for Christ’s sake, and you want to use him as bait?!”
“Oh… Jesus…” I realised why he had jumped at my touch in that sensitive area. He had been sexually abused by Moran for god knows how long. I could hardly breathe. This was more than I could ever have imagined.
“Hungry?” I asked with a smile, quickly changing the subject.
We both chuckled as I got to me feet. She wrapped an arm around my waist and pressed a motherly kiss to my cheek, “He’ll be alright, John. With all of us looking after each other, it’ll be okay. Just you wait…”
“Hello John,” Mycroft Holmes said, leaning on his ever present umbrella.
Sherlock had been stressed out the last couple of days, at first being even more silent and non-responsive than ever and then growling at himself in agitation and pacing the flat like a caged animal. I had decided to give him his space, if he really needed something he would tell me. The last few nights, he had been coming to bed in the small hours of the morning, I would feel the bed dip and he would drape himself over me like an octopus, but tonight, he came and stood in the doorway relatively early.
I moved away from the bathroom, composing myself and put the kettle on, running a hand through my hair in exasperation. I vaguely heard the doorbell ring, but I was too absorbed in my own thoughts to properly register it. Just as the kettle boiled, an all too familiar voice rang through the flat.
I stood and moved next to him, leaving a safe distance between us as he looked so jumpy, “Sherlock, look at me.”
“I’ll be okay,” I said with a smile. “I am a doctor after all. I am fully qualified to tie some plastic around my stiches!”
“I feel nauseous, my head hurts and I ache all over…” he said quietly.
My eyebrows shot up, probably all the way to my hairline, in shock. I laughed in disbelief and nodded, “If you want to, yeah.”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed in confusion, “But, I’ve seen all the signs of arousal in you, I know you want me that way…”
Sherlock began typing out his agreement to these terms, but I gripped his shoulder to stop him, “Wait! We know nothing about this location, he could pick anywhere! We can’t meet him on his own turf, he’ll have every advantage.”
I thought about my answer carefully before replying: 'Yeah, I’m fine. Just want 2 talk. We haven’t spoken in a while & I need to get something off my chest. I think u r the only 1 who will understand.'
I sighed, knowing that he was still sorry, so I crossed to him, knelt in front of him and spoke earnestly, “Look, I really appreciate that you are being so honest with me. But sometimes… well,  some of the things you tell me won’t always be easy for me to hear. But I need to know so I can help. I’m glad you’re telling me, but I may get upset sometimes… because I care about you. Does that make sense?”
He hesitated and glanced at Greg who looked at me with trepidation, “But you’re not going to like it one bit.”
I smiled, glad to hear that I was on the right track. I licked and nipped at his beautiful hipbones, making Sherlock wriggle beneath me as his breath became more irregular. I moved to the bulge in his pants, breathing hot air onto it and rubbing my cheek across the fabric clad tip.
I tweaked the nipple he had directed me to, eliciting the dirtiest sound I had ever heard come out of Sherlock’s mouth, “Hng, John…”
“What, now?” I questioned. It was just after midnight!
Sherlock smiled and hummed back. He leaned in and kissed the tip of my nose quickly before getting to his feet and heading back to the kitchen. I stood up with a tired stretch and followed him in, putting the kettle on to boil.
Sherlock abruptly stopped playing, “That’s all I’ve got so far…”
A wild look came over Moran’s face as he realised his mistake. His hand moved to click the safety off his gun when suddenly the whole room was plunged into darkness as the lights went out. The room was instantly filled with shouting, the sound of breaking glass and doors crashing open before gunfire filled the air.
She then pinched my cheek before heading back out into the kitchen. I took a bolstering breath and squared my shoulders before heading directly for my armchair, where I drank the rest of my tea.
Banes sneered and spat on the ground but didn’t reply.
Eventually Sherlock’s breathing became steadier and then slowed into an even rhythm. I scooted down on the bed, taking Sherlock with me and I lay there with him, holding him, stoking his black curls for the rest of the night. And for once, he didn’t have any nightmares.
"Please don't let him hurt me again, John, please. I can't, I can't, I can't," Sherlock mumbled over and over into my shoulder.
I huffed a laugh as I threw my boxers aside, “I’m really not. I’m old and broken…”
“Thank you John,” Sherlock whispered into my ear, voice breaking slightly. I stood on my toes and kissed him gently.
Sherlock began to giggle too, “Much easier to explain than psychosomatic pain from a shoulder injury.”
“What?” I asked, confused. “What’s so funny?”
"Great, thanks," I replied sarcastically, burying my head in hands. "That really helped."
“Well? What do you think?” Greg asked with a smile, “Weird, huh?”
I looked into his exhausted face and gave in, wrapping my arms around him gently and kissing his bare chest, before leading him to bed. We got under the covers and I held him tight, combing my hand though his curls and whispering sweet nothings to him until he fell asleep.
Eventually, Sherlock placed his violin down and stretched out on the couch. He slept quietly for a while under my watchful gaze before awaking with a spooked look in his eye. I put the television on to distract him, letting him flick mindlessly through the channels.
“These will go away eventually, with time and the proper treatment…” I said, running the back of my fingers gently over the burn on his neck, “There might be some scar tissue but just small marks…”
I leveled my gaze at those dead eyes unflinchingly, “If you come any closer, I’ll give you a taste.”
I raised a questioning brow at him before looking around to see how much attention he was attracting. Sherlock turned back to the tobacconist’s shop, entering the shop and taking in every detail. I followed him, hanging back as he approached the young man behind the counter.
I understood her point, but guy on guy porn? I wasn’t sure I could do that. I said I would think it over and that I would talk to her later. By this time, Sherlock had closed his laptop (which I think was actually mine) and had gotten to his feet.
Some Mystrade tension thrown in here for the hell of it so enjoy!
I was just about to turn off the light when something, caught my eye. Several somethings. Several, horrible somethings. His porcelain flesh was covered with scars and welts, and his ribs were sticking out much more than were natural.
At that moment, Sherlock burst through the door, “I know who killed them. It was the cleaning lady!”
I got up and put on some pyjama bottoms before wrapping myself in Sherlock’s dressing gown. Sherlock sat up and looked at me with a raised eyebrow as I made my way towards the door, “You’re going to go out to see Lestrade wearing my dressing gown?”
Half an hour later, I was sitting in my armchair with a cup of tea watching the morning news on mute so as not to wake Sherlock who was still sleeping fairly undisturbed on the couch. I kept glancing over at his form, thinking about how I felt about all that had happened in the last twenty four hours.
Holy crap! Six years later and I'm FINALLY coming back to this story! Better late than never though I guess! I had a tough time of it for a little while with mental health but I feel able to and excited about writing again, though I may be a little rusty! Here is the next chapter, and I hope to keep updating when I can and eventually finish this story!
He sat there for a moment before closing his eyes and taking a breath, “Sebastian Moran.”
He trailed off, the words obviously making him uncomfortable. I swallowed nervously, “Um, yeah, sure. I’ll just get my pyjamas and then I’ll be back…”
I drank him in as I sipped on my tea; with the light reflecting on one side of his face from the café, he looked positively angelic. His cheek was in shadow below his cheekbone and his grey eyes were shining. Then I noticed something worrying.
“So why did you bring it up?” I asked confused.
“No we can’t. I’m worried about you and I want to know what happened in those three years I thought you were dead,” I said, standing my ground.
“I have been monitoring Sherlock’s health, mental and physical, and I thought that I should tell you a few things before you proceed with any sort of treatment,” Mycroft said with his usual upturned nose.
He sighed tiredly as I took his scarred wrist, felt his pulse and generally observed him; slightly elevated pulse, more rapid breathing than normal and he looked pale and tense.
“Johnny!” she exclaimed, embracing me in a bear hug.
I took a step towards him. I have no idea what I was planning to do but before I could think of anything, Moran raised a finger and wagged it at me, tutting from the railing. “No, no, I don’t think so Dr. Watson,” Moran said condescendingly. “Stay right where you are. How about I shed some light on the subject, and then perhaps you will better understand your situation.”
Sherlock pulled away slightly and I could see his rational self fall back into place, retaking control of his passion. He took in the situation and for the first time seemed to fully notice my erection pressing into his back and his own straining trousers, “Oh god. I’m so sorry John. I didn’t mean…”
Once I had retrieved it, I went back over to the couch and sat down at the end. I had just settled in before Sherlock swung his legs around and dropped them into my lap. I sat frozen in place, staring at the white bare feet in my lap. I cleared my throat but when he didn’t even blink, I sighed and rested my elbows on his lower legs, opened my book and tried to concentrate. I attempted to read but I found myself reading the same paragraph over and over again as I kept getting distracted by the sound of Sherlock’s breathing. Every so often he would shift his legs a little in my lap, which for some unknown reason brought a smile to my face.
Sherlock smiled tightly as Lestrade, “You said something about a case?”
Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed again and he took a breath, grasping desperately onto my hand, “…Chained up, he’s smiling at me, he… he runs his hands over my chest, scratching me… then… then, lower…” He whimpered and sobbed, before crying out and scrambling off the couch, stumbling over to his armchair before collapsing to the floor.
I hurried up to my room and tried to calm my thoughts as I changed into my pyjamas. Sherlock wanted me to stay again. This was too much for me. My heart had skipped a beat when he had asked but now I realised that this might be difficult.
“Sherlock, I’m more than willing to have sex with you, but perhaps we should take it slower, considering we’ve both been under a lot of strain these last few days.”
I pulled away from him slightly, taken aback from his sudden outburst. Sherlock scrubbed his hands through his hair, “Just, please, shut up…”
“I would give you the world if I could because that’s what I think you deserve. But it’s not about ‘deserving’ anything, it’s about supporting each other and loving each other without holding anything back. Because I do, Sherlock, I love you. I think I’ve loved you since we stood laughing in the hallway downstairs, after I chased you across London for the first time! Come to think of it, the moment I realised was actually down to Irene Adler.”
I was on the verge of tears myself; this was just too much for me to handle. All of these things happened to the person I hold most dear in life and he was doing it to protect me? I couldn’t even process it.
“Alright then, what’s the plan?”
As Harry sat down she asked, “What’s wrong with him? Is he okay?”
“Sometimes I look in the mirror… and I see it and… everything comes back,” he said, the haunted look came back into his eyes and his breathing began to become erratic and laboured again.
I cleaned myself up in a daze. I had just sucked a man’s cock! No, not just any man’s, I had sucked Sherlock Holmes off! A sly grin spread across my lips as I brushed my teeth and thought about how I had made Sherlock come apart. What a privilege it was to be able to experience him like that.
The money was dropped, guns were pointed, shouting echoed in the small vault. I heard a small thud beside me as Sherlock clutched at the wall for support, eyes never leaving the barrel of Spaulding’s gun.
Sherlock started shaking his head slowly, huge eyes becoming watery. I placed a hand on his cheek, “Don’t worry Sherlock, we are going to fix this!”
I backed away from the laptop and collapsed onto the arm of Sherlock’s chair, my knees unable to support me as horror, anger and disgust warred within me. Mycroft hesitated as Sherlock continued to empty his stomach in the bathroom. He looked between the bathroom and the laptop, as though he wished he could comfort his little brother, but hurried over to the laptop instead. When he saw the photo, a cold fury settled in Mycroft’s eyes and his umbrella clattered to the floor. With a growl of anguish, he slammed the laptop lid closed so forcefully that the desk rattled.
I swallowed worriedly, this was the worst relapse Sherlock had had in a very long time. In a desperate attempt to help, I scooted my chair closer and placed a supportive hand on his arm, “It’s okay Sherlock, just close your eyes and breathe…”
The cab ride to the warehouse Moran had selected, located near the train tracks in Battersea, was silent and tense. What was there to say? For about the fifth time in the last 10 minutes I wished I had my gun, but Sherlock and I had agreed that we should follow Moran’s instructions to the letter. We just had to hope that Mycroft and Lestrade had the situation under control.
I shook my head with a laugh, “Do you really think I have any idea what you’re thinking right now?”
I tucked his head under my chin and said, “Don’t worry, it’s okay.” I comforted him in silence for a moment before asking him something I knew he didn’t want to hear, but I needed to know, “Listen, Sherlock, you were examined at that medical facility you were at, right? I mean, with rape tests and everything.”
Sherlock entered after throwing a tiny but excited smile my way, brushing my arm deliberately as he went. I leant closer to Greg before following him inside, “This won’t be too much for him will it?”
I narrowed my eyes at Moran, “I need a word with him.”
When I got no reply once again, I staggered over to the couch and lay down on it. I lay there, counting the patterns on the wallpaper for a very long time and I was just beginning to drift off to sleep when I saw a silhouette at the top of the stairs.
I smiled, typical Sherlock, but it was a good idea. If he put his emotions into his compositions then played them to me it might be an easier way for us to communicate.
“You’re not, you’re with me, you’re safe,” I said quietly. He opened his eyes and nodded, but his eyes still looked slightly glazed over.
As we waited for a response from Moran, Mrs. Hudson took it upon herself to make tea and coffee. The rest of us had no idea what to do with ourselves; the tension in the room was palpable.
She stopped chuckling and looked me straight in the eye, “It’s about time you realised, dear!”
I sat up, “Sherlock…” I began, but he turned and walked straight into his bedroom, closing the door quietly behind him.
She laughed a little but then her expression sobered, “Okay, I'm sorry. It's just... you’re in love! With Sherlock Holmes, of all people!”
“John…” I heard my name float down from upstairs in Sherlock’s deep baritone voice.
Sherlock’s eyes squinted the way he does when he’s thinking, “Okay. I suppose that will suffice for now. Maybe I can research more later… Will you, um, will you kiss me again?”
“It’s okay Sherlock, I’m here,” I said from the doorway, raising my hands in a placating gesture.
We were at a crime scene and Sherlock was standing over the body of a woman, looking around her dingy flat for clues. She had been brutally stabbed and there was blood everywhere. Even I, who had seen this kind of thing before as an army doctor, felt slightly sick at the sight.
I mumbled in agreement, not taking my mouth from Sherlock’s ear. Running my tongue along the edge, I trailed my fingers down his delicious neck, caressing every contour.
“No, I can’t,” I grabbed his arm and turned him around to face me. “That was a serious relapse, more serious than you’ve had in a long time.” I rubbed my hand up and down his arm, “I’m worried about you, love.”
All the breath suddenly left my lungs, the sound of his deep baritone in my ear saying such things took my breath away. I blushed, stepping away slightly with an anxious chuckle.
“John, don’t think so loudly,” Sherlock muttered as he nibbled at a piece of toast, staring intently at me.
Greg made to go after him put I stopped him gently, “No, I’ll take care of this. You go arrest the housekeeper.”
“Leave him out of this,” Sherlock growled, voice dripping with venom.
Once again, I had to convince Sherlock to take the pills before he went to bed. It took some effort but I managed to get him to swallow them before leading him to his bedroom. When I started to leave, he grabbed at my hand.
“And hello to you too,” Greg retorted with good natured sarcasm. “Glad to see you looking better than you were last time you were in my office!”
“Hey, um, I should probably keep an eye on him so…”
Sherlock’s face looked pensive before beginning to close off and detach again. I had to stop him from shutting me out so I grabbed the side of his face, forcefully yet kindly, and angled it towards me, “Sherlock, you don’t have much choice. I’m going to get you through this and there’s nothing you can do to stop me from helping my best friend.”
All around his neck was a light pinkish scar along with various small cuts. I rested my hand on his shoulder and tried to steady myself. I felt sick to my stomach. What the hell had happened to him in those three years?
“Did he have you chained up?” I asked, still caressing his bony wrists gently.
“Don’t be sorry, John,” Sherlock whispered back, voice cracking slightly. “It’s not you. I just, I want you… I want to be close to you but…”
His brow furrowed, “Because, this shift in our relationship, I think needs addressing now that I am making a recovery.”
The corner of Sherlock’s mouth tilted up a fraction despite the fear behind his eyes and the tension in his frame, “That’s assuming we didn’t know where you were. That little gift you sent me truly was quite… illuminating.”
Greg looked just as shocked as I felt before a wry smile tugged at his lips, “Yes I did, thanks very much. Someone around here had to keep a level head.”
He placed the bow in my right hand and lifted it to the strings before arranging my left fingers over some strings and changing little things about how I was positioned, “Arch your fingers more, that’s better. Lighter on the bow, there you are.”
He still looked on edge but Sherlock nodded slowly and whispered, “I s’pose if you have to…”
She cocked her head to the side in confusion, “Why wouldn’t it be? He might feel the same! That’s good, isn’t it?”
Greg cleared everyone away as I rushed to Sherlock’s side. His eyes were clamped shut and he was making small whimpering noises. I tried to get his attention; I shook him gently and called his name but he didn’t respond.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I didn’t mean it like that… I just want to keep you safe,” I said, approaching him slowly.
I sighed, “What is it?” As Sherlock had gotten better, our casual bickering had begun to resurface now that Sherlock was no longer so sensitive due to his trauma.
I turned to Sherlock, who was standing there with his arms wrapped around his torso and his shoulders hunched. While his posture betrayed his fear, his eyes were clear and resolute.
“Well, the extreme suppression of deeply painful memories is making you ill. Your brain is still trying to process all the awful things that happened to you which you have been ignoring. That’s why your body is reacting this way,” I stopped.
Sherlock turned around and smiled at me, continuing to play but wishing me a good morning as he walked closer to me.
Harry nodded with a smile, “I’ll get out of your hair. You really look after him well, I think you’d be good together.”
I rolled Sherlock over gently and kissed him hungrily on those gorgeous lips of his as I shimmied out of my boxers. Sherlock reached down and wrapped a loose hand experimentally around my cock. I gasped and began to thrust slowly into Sherlock’s fist as I moved my kisses slowly down his body until his hand couldn’t reach my crotch anymore and I was kissing along his hipbones.
With that, he walked out of his office and started ordering people around, preparing for the arrest. I left Scotland Yard and caught a cab to Baker Street. I hadn’t expected Sherlock to be there and sure enough he wasn’t.
I chuckled, “Seriously? Bit old for kids songs aren’t we?”
It was my turn to hum in reply as I breathed in the intoxicating scent of him. I ran my hand back up his chest, aiming to tangle my fingers in his messy curls, but Sherlock intercepted me and grasped wrist gently.
He still looked uncertain but he put them in his mouth and swallowed. After he had taken them, he breathed heavily for a second, until calming slightly and nodding at me assuredly. I nodded before getting to my feet and talking quietly to my sister.
“Give him the address, Detective. We shall see whether he agrees to meet,” interjected Mycroft, prompting Greg to place a slip of paper on the desk.
“How do you know if you’re in love?” I asked before even realising what had come out of my mouth. "Oh god, that's pathetic isn't it. A forty-something year old man asking about love..."
I sighed, probably a bit too obnoxiously, and one thought crossed my mind; shit…
She shrugged, “At first I thought he might be bad for you, but now I see he’s the best thing that could’ve happened to you. I see the way you look at him, and I see how happy he makes you. So for what it’s worth, you have my blessing.”
Wilson was astonished at Sherlock’s deduction but took a breath and launched into the following story;
I blinked, “Really? I thought you weren’t keen on Sherlock?”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I was so out of line… I should’ve realised that you wouldn’t want that right now…”
A pause; I decided the direct approach would be best, “You’re right.”
“What?!” I exclaimed. “This is our chance, Sherlock!”
“But now?” I asked, sitting back further on the couch.
“You? Stop thinking? I doubt even sex can do that for you,” I joked quietly, rubbing his back gently.
“Tell me what you see, when you close your eyes,” I said gently, hoping not to scare him but encourage him to describe what it was he was flashing back to.
“Wow,” I gasped.
Sherlock pulled away slightly so he could look at me, but instead of looking me in the eyes, he found a very interesting piece of skin on my chest to examine thoroughly. He started drawing little circles there as he spoke.
I exhaled a shaky breath, “Fine, I’m fine. Better now actually. Sorry… I just, he was just smirking at me with that disgusting face of his and I couldn’t stop myself…” I trailed off as I realised that Sherlock was smiling at me, and he even huffed out a small laugh.
Again, Sherlock nodded, “It’s just that… he…” Sherlock brought his hands to his head and pressed the base of his palms into his eyes, whimpering again and again. Then it hit me.
“Look at you, trembling so beautifully for me. Your doctor did an admirable job of cleaning you up, but I can’t wait to start fresh,” Moran brought his hand up to brush the back of his fingers against Sherlock’s cheek but he jerked his face away from Moran’s touch and glared viciously.
I gulped; I was way out of my depth here. I needed to ask someone’s advice on this, but who could I ask? Mrs Hudson? No, I didn’t think she’d be comfortable discussing something like that with me, nor I with her for that matter. There was no way I could talk to Mycroft…perhaps Greg? No, he was my mate, that would be weird, wouldn’t it? That really only left Molly, who was already in love with Sherlock which wouldn’t help at all, or Harry…
Another short one, sorry! I feel terrible for leaving you all hanging but I'm flat out at the moment!
Later that night, Sherlock and I were sitting in a café across from the bank that was around the corner from our client’s tobacconist shop. I was nursing a cup of tea whilst Sherlock was reclining in his chair and gazing intently across the road.
I couldn’t breathe. Moran. It was Moran, he had found us, crawled out from under whatever disgusting rock he had been hiding under. I knew what I had to do. I whipped out my phone and sent a 999 message to Mycroft and Lestrade, before snapping the laptop shut and throwing both devices on my armchair.
Bit of a short chapter but I thought it best to post something short than nothing at all :)
“I might have let slip that I thought he was beautiful... and then he said he thought something about bees was beautiful, and then I think he compared me to that... honestly it was a very confusing conversation,” I said with a wry smile.
“Right,” Greg replied excitedly, “But he’s cocky, so I thought we should be taking a closer look at the photograph he sent because although the messages where calculated…”
I was awakened from my ponderings by Sherlock saying quietly, “I think you are.”
I began massaging his perineum faster and faster, in time with my bobbing head, trying to hit his prostate every time until Sherlock was thrusting down onto my fingers and then into my mouth, fingers then mouth in an ever quickening rhythm.
Sherlock grabbed my hand and led me into the living room, turning to stand behind me.
“Where is he?” I asked as forcefully as I could, though it came out sounding gravelly from inhaling the painkillers.
Sherlock smiled and chuckled uneasily as if he hadn’t meant to say that out loud. I pulled my pants back up and adjusted them appropriately before leaning in and kissing Sherlock sweetly. He returned the kiss enthusiastically, pulling me closer to him. I felt the wet patch in Sherlock’s groin and pulled away with a grimace.
We entered a restaurant and sat down in an intimate, deserted corner. I gazed around suspiciously as I was handed a menu by Sherlock, “Are we in this tiny corner so we can act like a couple without being seen?”
The childlike innocence of the question and the nature in which it was posed to him almost brought me to tears. Sherlock, my dear, brilliant Sherlock, sounded so scared and unsure. I squeezed him back and thought carefully about what I was could tell him without scaring him.
“Good morning John, dear,” Mrs Hudson said pleasantly as she cleaned up some of the mess that littered the kitchen benches.
Rapping on the door, I said loudly, “Sherlock?
Harry had been a great support for me over the previous years in Sherlock’s… absence, as she had just gotten out of rehab and was prepared to repay me for all the times I was there for her. She still hasn’t had a drink since, but lately we had drifted apart. In this last year, people had sort of left me to my own devices to try and sort out my life, which I had been glad for, as I had spent the better part of two years being asked if I was okay every two seconds.
I smiled at that, noting that he didn’t actually say sorry for this, which hopefully meant he was feeling a bit more like himself now. “How long have I been out?” I asked.
A few days passed relatively quietly, there were no new threats from Moran and Baker Street was under 24 hour surveillance. On the third night with no updates from Lestrade or the elder Holmes about tracing the message, I was sitting in Sherlock’s bed (our bed now) in boxers and a t-shirt, searching the internet for online news with the bedside light switched on beside me.
I busied myself pouring the soup into a bowl and placed it in front of Sherlock, who at the smell of food seemed to sit up a little straighter. I handed him a spoon and sat myself down at the table, watching Sherlock intently as he, rather uncharacteristically, began slurping his soup enthusiastically.
Sherlock turned to look at me, examining my face for sincerity before nodding the smallest nod hesitantly. I smiled at him and he smiled hesitantly back, a warm fuzzy feeling of hope spreading through my body.
I ran my hand over it and could tell that it had been dislocated. I guessed that was probably from the escape too but I didn’t say anything in case he closed up on me completely. I then moved down to his abdomen.
Harry’s brow furrowed in confusion and surprise but she said, “Well, it's not
Moran’s eyes darted to Sherlock and I saw a dark hunger in their depths that made me want to strangle him with my bare hands. Sherlock lips were quivering with a mixture of anger and fear at my thorough frisking. Moran smiled lasciviously at Sherlock and approached him.
Then it dawned on me, “Oh... oh Sherlock… You think that no one will want you if you mind is compromised? Oh, Sherlock… No! Don’t think that! Don’t ever think that!”
I nodded and paused as I considered my next statement carefully, “It is difficult…”
“Oh! Sorry,” she said, quickly letting go.
“No, what I meant was that you don’t need to talk to me like that because I am glad that you told me. About what happened to you,” I said, carefully phrasing my sentences so he didn’t misunderstand me again, “I mean, you’re experiencing something and it’s affecting you which is making me worried. And you’re not going to get better until you let it out and talk about it.”
“And you know,” I gasped out between peals of laughter, “at least now I have an actual excuse to limp!”
“Can I look at your injuries? See if there will be any permanent damage?” I asked tentatively.
Sherlock fell completely silent as I started lapping up the fluid from the slit, dipping my tongue in and out. I glanced up at Sherlock to see him gaping at me wide eyed. I pulled away slightly, squeezing the base of his cock and massaging his balls and prostate slightly harder.
Sherlock laid his violin down gently, “Sorry. I didn’t mean to make you sad.”
“So you’ve noticed that too then?” I asked in an equally hushed tone.
With that, there was a clatter down the stairs and a jumble of voices as both men left in a flurry of activity to get everything set up. The sudden stillness in the flat was jarring, and I didn’t know what to do with myself. The anger Greg had glimpsed began to recede again as I realised just how right he was, the more we knew the greater the risk of discovery.
“It smells weird,” I said with a distasteful wrinkle of my nose.
I respected this extra security Sherlock felt was necessary. After what Moran did to him, of course he was going to be a bit jumpy when it came to intimate exchanges and touching. I was fine with the extra layer of clothing between us at night but I always felt guilty when I would reach out without thinking and touch him in a marginally intimate place, like his thigh or in particular his hip, and Sherlock would flinch away from me.
The change of pace left me feeling a little shocked, as though I had completely misread where the situation was headed. I was hoping we could indulge in some lazy and gentle celebratory sex after the ordeal we had been through last night, but Sherlock had moved to tug the covers away from my injured thigh. It seemed as though he was pretty serious about taking care of me, but I hoped it wasn’t something more than that.
I sobered as I regarded Greg and Mycroft for a moment. I pulled Greg into a brief hug and then patted Mycroft on the shoulder, “Thank you. Both of you. Thank you for taking care of everything.”
We sat there for what felt like an age. I felt a cramp developing in my leg but I didn’t care. I stayed exactly where I was, holding Sherlock, just being there for him. After a while he spoke almost inaudibly.
I paused for a second, gathering my thoughts, “What do you mean? I haven’t noticed any…”
He surged forwards to straddle my hips, moving my roving hand to his back before carding his own through my hair. A breathy moan was his only answer as he bit down earnestly on my neck. I gasped and he started rocking again but due to his new vantage point, he was now rubbing our crotches together, making me hum.
I assumed he would just move into the bed silently and but he didn’t. He just stood in the doorway. So I looked up from my laptop and was confronted with the sight of Sherlock’s pale body leaning against the doorframe, completely nude.
I got no answer but I did hear lots of sniffling and muffled sobs, as though he had put his hand over his face to stop me from hearing him. I knocked again and when still no reply was given, I decided to open the door just a fraction to check on him.
Harry smiled joyfully at the thought of her better half, before a sly expression came over her face, “So, who are you in love with? And why does it involve Sherlock?”
As Mycroft took a breath to argue his case, a quiet voice spoke from the entryway to the kitchen, “Do I get a say in any of this?”
"Listen, just so we're clear, I want you to tell me who you think should know about what you're going through," I began hesitantly, not wanting to say or do the wrong thing again. "I shouldn't have told Mrs. Hudson without asking you first, so I want to make sure we're on the same page now with who should know what."
I nodded and rocked Sherlock gently, trying to calm him down. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mycroft turn to Lestrade and talk quietly with him. Greg swore quietly, running a hand over his face in shock.
I bit my lip to hold back a giggle as Wilson became increasingly deterred.
I pursed my lips as Sherlock and I moved over to view the laptop, “Not exactly an ideal plan, but I suppose it’s the best we’ve got.”
'Sure Johnny, whatever u want. R u ok?'
He pushed his boxers down just enough so I could see the brand Moran gave him, “I want to get it cosmetically removed. I don’t want Him on me, still tainting me from where ever he is. I want to belong to you completely.”
I nodded patiently, “Okay, do you feel sick? Tell me what you’re feeling.”
I approached him slowly, putting a hand on his shoulder, not saying anything. Sherlock grasped my hand in his own and squeezed, as if to reassure himself that it was really me and not Moran that was touching him. I rested my head on our intertwined hands, placing a kiss on Sherlock’s gently, whispering how sorry I was.
“Hey,” I said quietly, sitting beside him, “Did you have another nightmare?”
Despite a slight waver in his voice, I could tell Sherlock had made up his mind. I also knew that he was right, no matter how much I hated this situation. We had a better chance at stopping him now than waiting god knew how long for him to resurface.
The first time I found his prostate, Sherlock bucked again, this time even more wildly and practically squealed. I kept stimulating this area, but more gently as I brought my other hand to grip the base of cock. This was it. I was going to suck cock for the first time in my life. The heady smell of Sherlock was intoxicating, just like the last time I was this close to him. There were butterflies in my belly but my mouth watered, overpowering my nerves as I placed a small kiss to the head, tasting his come.
