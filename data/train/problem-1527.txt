"Yah, it's just me, Sherlock." John let him go but kept a hand on his arm as he turned him to see his face.
John moved him away several inches and shifted such that they were at eye level. In the dim light, Sherlock could see John's expression had softened. His eyes were tinged with sadness, remorse, but most of all,
The journey down the hill was certainly quicker, but no less strenuous, and by the time Sherlock reached the sea, his feet were sore and his hips, knees, and ankles were aching. He removed his sailcloth shoes, being careful to save the used ropes and sailcloth, but discarding the worn leaves. He was proud of the design as his feet had been protected remarkably well. In the dwindling daylight, he rested briefly before continuing down the beach towards his home, full notebook in hand. He walked where the warm ocean waves could lap at his weary feet. He searched the water once or twice for signs of John but he saw none. Perhaps John would be back at their beach when he returned, but perhaps Sherlock would spend the night by himself for the first time. He tried not to worry, but is was difficult, and he was lost in thought as he walked along.
It was an accident. He didn't mean to sleep next to Sherlock all night, what would Sherlock think about John snuggling with him without his consent? The man had been a sleeping emotional wreck for Christ's sake! He pulled his arm away from Sherlock's hip and tried to shuffle back but was stopped by a quick strong hand on his shoulder. Sherlock's calm eyes were now a little startled and confused, and he held John tight to prevent a dignified escape.
Sherlock waved him away. John sighed. The simplest things with Sherlock could be unnecessarily complex. Oh, well, he was a grown man, John reasoned, it wasn't his place to micromanage his flatmate. John put away the groceries and continued his day.
Sherlock rose and built a fire, but John did not bring him a fish. Sherlock continued his morning, turning his attentions to strengthening the roof over the ocean-facing side of his small house, all the while keeping watch for John to return. The sun rose high in the sky and began to decline, and still John did not return.
John was upset. Angry, even. Was Sherlock not permitted to go to the Island's interior? Had he broken a custom or rule that he was oblivious to? Was John still disturbed by what had happened that morning? Sherlock was quite confused, and a little frightened, by John's strange behavior. Octopoda had certainly never handled him so roughly or around the neck before. But, the friendship and trust they had built between them was strong and Sherlock calmed himself, willing his muscles to relax and his mind to believe that John would never really hurt him.
John continued, carefully and quietly. "That's a pretty bad infection, it can't feel good. I'm worried that left untreated it could damage your eyesight."
Despite John's obvious stare, Sherlock paid him no mind. He went about his business, removing the milk and setting it down on the kitchen table. After closing the refrigerator, he opened the bottom cabinet next to the sink and, with a great amount of clamoring around, took out several pots and pans and set them on the table next to the milk. Then he paused, standing still to regard the items on the table, apparently deep in thought.
"May I?" John asked as he skimmed his fingers along the waistband of Sherlock's pajama bottoms. Everything about Sherlock's body language and the noises he was making said he wanted this.
John groaned and leaned in to nibble at Sherlock's ear lobe. "I want to taste you," he whispered in Sherlock's ear, then began kissing a trail down his neck, descending lower and lower towards the prize.
John's head was now sharing the pillow that Sherlock had commandeered. His nose was almost at the back of Sherlock's neck. He could smell his posh shampoo and the moisturizer that he was always spreading on his arms to keep the eczema at bay. There was also something else. Perhaps a faint hint of sweat, or just the smell of Sherlock. It smelled nice.
But Molly never arrived in Australia. The merchant sailing ship was rocked by a great shock and caught fire in the night. She had been hurried into a lifeboat but was thrown from it in the melee. As she was swept farther away from the blazing ship, yelling in vain for aid, she had been certain she would drown. Instead, she was saved as Sherlock had been: stolen from death by the tentacles of a mighty sea beast. However, whereas Sherlock had woken to find himself alone, Molly was left on the shores of the Islander's village. She was received with great welcome and jubilation and soon took a husband, had 3 children, and found happiness among them.
, John thought and fought the urge to smirk. He grasped Sherlock's slender hips with both hands, and leaned in and licked at the side of the head. With no more delay, he engulfed the glans in his mouth. The fit of it against the roof of his mouth was exquisite.
Sherlock had surmised that a great storm was coming and John was bringing him to the Island People. The intense sea sickness and severity of the pending weather considerably dampened the enthusiasm he would have otherwise felt at finally being brought back to see the Islanders.
Sherlock did not reply, which was uncharacteristically rude, as he would often at least give a low hum of either acknowledgement or disagreement when John asked him a question. John transferred his laptop to the side table and turned, looking over the back of his chair to see Sherlock in the kitchen.
Pressing one steady hand against Sherlock's lower back, John guided him along the sidewalk, back towards home.
Sherlock closed the distance between them and gently kissed John's lips. It was a tentative exploration of tongues, breathing, and bumping noses. Sherlock broke the kiss and leaned back, his blue-green irises dark in the dim light.
Sherlock. All of him. He grasped the hem of the t-shirt and pulled it up and over Sherlock's head. He pulled off his own t-shirt, noticing how Sherlock's eyes flashed down to the gnarled scar tissue on his shoulder. John briefly admired the pale plains of Sherlock's chest and well-defined abs, sparsely covered with short hairs.
It felt like a near eternity for the storm to finally pass, but even then, most of the women he was with stayed. As many men and women began to leave, Molly explained that they must remain in the cave until the rains stopped and the rushing streams calmed. He learned that the people regularly fared such storms and they always persevered with careful preparation and much work and rebuilding once the storm passed.
Sherlock raised his hands up from the water, the tentacle wrapped around each wrist had loosened and slid down so they now supported his upper arms, helping to keep him upright. He still had the notebook, wet but hopefully salvageable, clutched in one hand. With the other, he reached for John's face, stroking the smooth cheek before leaning in to hug him. They stayed like that for some time, chest-to-chest, Sherlock resting his head on John's shoulder and trying to convey through the hug what words could not: that it was all just a misunderstanding and he held no ill feelings towards his friend. By the time the sun's light had faded from the horizon, leaving only the silver glow of moonlight, Sherlock had been in the water for quite some time and he began to feel cold.
"Beautiful," John whispered, then he settled back down onto that perfect body, reveling in the sensation of finally being completely bare and pressed together.
Molly frowned. "I do not know. Perhaps I will speak with my grandma, but it is rude to ask so many questions about Sea Brother."
"I am glad to have met you, Sherlock," she said as she reached up to embrace him. Nikau squealed in evident delight at the gesture. "If Wh'an chooses, he will bring you back to us and I will be thankful. The elders say we will celebrate then."
The waves finally subsided as John maneuvered the boat, now half swamped, into the lagoon and farther into the shallows. Without fanfare, John beached the canoe and they were immediately approached by a group of 5 women, all middle-aged, clad only in cloths around their waists. Sherlock climbed on wobbly legs from the boat into the knee-deep water and looked towards John with uncertainty.
him. John had the urge to get up and cross the expanse between them. To perch on the edge of the couch at Sherlock's hip, put a warm hand on his shoulder, and offer reassurances that he was, in fact, not broken and he never was. John knew, though, that Sherlock would misinterpret such actions as patronizing.
He reached down and gently stroked around Sherlock's hole, the warm lube slipping easily. He circled and stroked, stilling his ministrations with his right hand while he patiently waited for
"I'm sorry, John." Sherlock spoke quietly. "I'm sorry I made you worry," he added. He doubted John could understand, but he spoke anyway, "and I'm sorry about this morning," then he rephrased, "I'm sorry about today sunrise." As far as Sherlock knew, the English words
Sherlock understood that his home had likely been swept away by the storm as well. His sailcloth roof and small round hut would be gone. His meager possessions: the knife and dissection implements, the oil lamp, and his flintstones were certainly lost.
John thought it over. He could see now why Sherlock was feeling a bit unsettled. It wounded him, though, the guilt in Sherlock's voice. That he didn't understand how genuinely good he was, how worthy of love.
Sherlock pulled out one of the two kitchen chairs, but instead of sitting down, he carried it over to the hearth and set it facing the fireplace. Then, he returned to the kitchen for the second chair, brought it to the sitting room, and set it alongside the first. Finally, he sat down on the first chair, staring intently at the cold, dark ashes in the fireplace.
Turning back to the ocean he saw the unique silhouette that he had grown so fond of. John's broad shoulders emerged from the calm waters, and Sherlock thought he surely had been there waiting for him below the water's surface all along. Without as much as a thought, Sherlock dropped his bundle of notebooks into the canoe and ran to John, gleefully splashing down into the water with his arms outstretched. He had looked forward to their reunion for many days, and finally, he found himself swept up in the strong arms of the benevolent sea creature. He hugged tight around John's neck and felt the tentacles rise to support his weight and keep him mostly dry from the sea.
Sherlock had lost track of time, how long had he been gone from his usual abode while he explored the hill? What had John thought when he returned to the beach to find Sherlock absent? Clearly, he must have feared the worst. How long had he been searching for Sherlock? Had he searched the depths of the lagoon for his lifeless body, or painstakingly examined the entire length of beach? After considering these points, while looking into John's silent eyes, Sherlock concluded that his actions were driven not by anger, but likely by fear. In that light, John's behavior when he reclaimed the human from the land seemed understandable.
Sherlock listened attentively as Molly described the Islanders' customs and the details of her daily life. He learned they placed great importance on making offerings to Wh'an. They left special foods, flowers, ropes, fabrics, and occasionally traded goods from the sailing ships. The bounty of sail cloth that Sherlock had used to build his shelter had been a special gift. The offerings were always placed in a canoe and left at the point of land east of the village before sunrise.
As Sherlock had hoped, he soon began to enjoy the journey, collecting leaves and flowers to sketch for later, carefully mapping the topography around him, and counting the paces between each turn so that he could track distance between features. The forest was thick and green, replete with fruit trees and colorful birds chirping merrily and showing no fear of him, as they were undoubtedly completely naive to humans.
Sherlock has become much more accustom to swimming in the ocean lagoon with John. He has come to trust the giant creature, who is always nearby and ready to take Sherlock into his secure arms should he grow tired or be startled by a shark or seal. Sherlock feels so safe with his friend that on several occasions they have ventured beyond the relative safety of the reef out into the bottomless blue of the open ocean.
John was in surprising proximity at the edge of the water. Though his features were not clear in the early dawn light, Sherlock could tell John's octopod eyes were wide in surprise, his octopod skin inky and almost black. He had undoubtedly just observed the rather private moment. Sherlock gasped in chagrin and in an uncharacteristic act of modesty quickly covered his softening member from John's intrigued stare. Surely, John must understand the coital actions of human men? Why did his facial expression convey such... shock? Disgust? Embarrassment? Was he offended at the utterance of his name? Did he disapprove of Sherlock wasting his own seed in this way? Did John always watch him in his sleep?
Sherlock timidly regarded his new company. They smiled welcomingly at him and spoke several words, but then returned to conversation among themselves. As with the group at the beach, he was surrounded by women of all ages, from near girls to old women, grey and wrinkled. Many sat with small children on their laps or infants clutched at their breasts. They all had the darkly colored skin, heavy build, and black hair that characterized the inhabitants of the island.
A few moments ticked by before Sherlock glanced up at him, briefly making eye contact before quickly returning his attention back to the view through the dissecting scope. John had noticed it though, the white of Sherlock right eye was not so white. Red vessels stood out against the pinkened cornea.
"Alright. Good." Sherlock was still blinking, he seemed to be coming back to himself. He released his grip on John's hand and forearm and shuffled back up to a sitting position.
He slipped his own pajama bottoms and pants down to his knees, freeing his cock, then kicked them off with his feet. Before he could get back to Sherlock's pants, the detective had slipped out of his pajama bottoms and pants together and cast them onto the floor next to the bed. John wanted to
Sherlock remembered how John seemed to understand the village elder who spoke to him on their first visit. It was almost too perfect. Sherlock had found an Englishwoman who spoke John's language! He had so many questions, but was hesitant to speak impetuously to a lady.
Now, the murderer was in custody, ample evidence had been documented and organized to get a conviction while exonerating the workman who had been framed for the crime. All the proper paperwork had been completed, signed, and filed. John and Sherlock headed home to Baker Street, stopping by the Chinese restaurant at the corner for a satisfying dinner on the way.
Sherlock sat on the coffee table, now their positions were reversed. John held out the bottle of saline eye drops. Sherlock just stared. John removed the cap from the bottle and picked up Sherlock's hand, putting it between his fingers. He laid his head back, looking up to the ceiling.
John had just resolved to get up when he heard a bit of noise in the downstairs hall. Maybe Sherlock heard him yell? He never talked about his nightmares with his flatmate and he didn't want to start now. The git was so smart, he probably knew anyway. He listened as the footsteps reached the foot of his stairs and began to climb. Sherlock
"Sherlock! It's me, John! I'm not trying to hurt you!" he shouted as Sherlock writhed and twisted, arching back against John's chest to try and throw him off balance. The detective continued to struggle, whining in complaint and grunting with his efforts, but not speaking. "Wake up, Sherlock! It's John. Please, I need you to wake up! NOW!"
John turned and leaned on the counter while he waited for the water to boil. He tried not to stare at his attractive flatmate too often, it wasn't exactly typical behavior, but Sherlock seemed so engrossed in his work he was unlikely to notice. Sherlock was dressed in black trousers and a silk navy blue shirt that was straining at the buttons across his narrow chest. His black curly hair fell over his forehead, a stark contrast to the flawless, pale skin underneath. Sherlock had beautiful eyes: green and blue, with flecks of darker pigment mixed in. The sharpness of his cheekbones, gauntness of his face, and delightful upturned nose gave him an aristocratic air that John just loved to admire.
Surprised, Sherlock turned to regard the face of the woman who had so unexpectedly just greeted him. She was perhaps 30 years old, her once pale skin tanned, and her petite features framed by dark brown hair that had been bleached by the sun. Her face was half-lit by the fire as she turned to face Sherlock. She had kind, brown eyes, a pleasant smile, and she cradled a very young baby boy sleeping in her arms.
A quick inhale and sideways flick of Sherlock's eyes told John he had just hit the proverbial nail on the head. He reached out, gently taking Sherlock's hand and giving it an unhurried squeeze. He lay still and patient, giving Sherlock the time he needed.
John quietly rose from his chair and went over to sit in the empty kitchen chair next to Sherlock. In the dim light, he could see Sherlock's eyes were half-lidded and his stare was glassy and vacant.
in people, when I always saw the bad. He liked walking the city with me. The pubs and the back alleys and the parks. Everywhere we went, we met new people. That's when I started establishing the homeless network. I spent so much time with Victor and among people."
On this lazy Sunday morning, John lay in bed listening carefully for the sounds of Sherlock downstairs in the kitchen. This morning he must have been doing something with the microwave. John heard the timer beep, then Sherlock popping the door open, then sometime later the beep again. The air was beginning to take on a not-terribly-unpleasant smell similar to chicken soup, but the scent was undoubtedly being generated by something far less edible.
"Good morning, John," came Sherlock's deep, sleep-rumbled voice, accompanied by a press of his hips.
Probably not direct enough. Also, from the swelling around the lid John could tell it wasn't good, so that was an "obvious" question that he shouldn't bother with. Better cut to the chase.
A twitch of discomfort touched Sherlock's face. John paused, only half in. Oh, how he wanted to thrust forward, balls deep, but that wasn't how this worked. He waited patiently, fighting the instinct, until he felt Sherlock's body adjust to the intrusion. A nod from Sherlock and he pressed in a little deeper.
John picked up the antibiotic eye drops from the table next to him and held the bottle up for Sherlock to see. "See, the cap is still on. Can I hold it above your eye for a second? I won't touch and then I'll take it away."
John Watson wanted all those things. But he wanted them to come about consensually, not from lust spawned by some caring gesture in the dark of night.
"Where...?" Sherlock clutched the sleeve of John's jacket. He looked over the empty street, then at John, then down to the ground. His brow was furrowed in confusion. "Why are we fighting and where are my shoes?"
in the dark, but before he could make up his mind, Sherlock shuffled away and turned over. He snuggled back towards John and fit himself as the little spoon against the older man. John reached over Sherlock's hip, placing his hand over Sherlock's heart and hugged him tight to his chest.
Sherlock reflected on this for some moments, it was sad, but seemed to confirm the impression that he had of his friend. Kind and caring, fierce when necessary, but
"Only when I was quite young. It was a childhood phase and I grew out of it. Telly?" Sherlock reached for the remote controller to switch something on. He seemed very uninterested in continuing the conversation. He was right, it was probably just the stressful case, just sleep deprivation.
John smiled. It was a genuine smile that matched the joy he felt at that moment. The closeness with this cherished man. "Good morning, Love," he responded.
Sherlock leaned back from the side of the boat and returned his focus to the multiple verdant peaks of the neighbor island. He could feel the adrenaline pulsing through his veins, his muscles quivering and weak. Breathe in. Breathe out. He clutched his collection of scientific notebooks, wrapped in a heavy linen shirt, against his chest with one arm and held tight to the side of the canoe with the other. The sky was dark, despite that it could not be much past midday, and a strong and steady warm wind blew from an unusual direction. Another wave broke over the bow, spraying Sherlock with more salt water which ran down his already wet chest to join the sloshing puddle in the bottom of the canoe.
Sherlock was overcome with guilt. The physical intimacy he casually enjoyed with John had never been sexual: the strong tentacles and arms holding him steady, guiding him through the sea, helping to communicate his intent, or touching Sherlock in the inexplicably scrutinizing way that John often did. Never once had John indicated his interest in such relations. Now by himself, stung by the awkward exchange with his friend, Sherlock considered his feelings honestly and felt ashamed.
"I've seen a lot of bacterial pink eye lately, Sherlock. That certainly looks like an infection. No worries, I'll get you some antibiotic eye drops and it'll be cleared up in no time."
Here, though, Sherlock is not lonely because every day he has the company of his one true friend, John. John is the singular specimen of
John was torn between savoring the moment and extricating himself from the situation as quickly as possible. He wanted badly to lean forward and kiss those perfect lips. His reason won out and instead he brushed the curls away from Sherlock's forehead, running his fingers through his hair to gently hold the back of his head and angle it down for a chaste kiss on the forehead. "You're welcome, Sherlock."
He was thinking it was probably time for him to head upstairs to bed when he heard the door to Sherlock's bedroom abruptly open. The barefoot detective, dressed in his pajama bottoms and an inside-out t-shirt, came marching out to the kitchen and went directly to the refrigerator before bruskly opening the door and peering in.
Sherlock, obviously exhausted, had showered and gone to his room by 9 o'clock with no additional conversation. John knew the longer, more complex cases were draining for Sherlock, and the detective would take some time to decompress and process the details. Sometimes he spoke to John about aspects that troubled him: grievances of witnesses against victims who had been so horribly treated; blatant attempts to rewrite the truth into something more convenient; comments from spiteful Yard detectives, envious of the spotlight that Sherlock so often occupied. The attacks from fellow detectives were especially taxing. They were carefully crafted to cut deep into the armor Sherlock wore in public. The detective tried so hard to conceal his humanity, but John knew better than most people that Sherlock was a deeply empathetic and sensitive person. That Sherlock had come to trust John with these vulnerabilities, as well as so many other aspects of their daily lives as flatmates, was testament to how far their friendship had come in the less than 1 year of their acquaintance.
After a period of silence, Sherlock finally spoke up. "It was during year 6. My parents switched me to a new school. I hated it." Sherlock paused. His back rose and fell as he took a deep breath. "I had a... difficult time in school. I didn't get on well with the other kids. I guess I didn't fit in. My mother was convinced I had social adjustment problems and
John waited another minute or two, then rose from the coffee table and held his hand out for Sherlock. The detective sat up slowly and took the offered hand, then stood hesitantly from the couch. John gently led him into the kitchen to stand in front of the sink.
When John woke the next morning, he was alone. He went downstairs to find out that, despite it still being early, Sherlock had already gone out. It wasn't unusual for the detective to go out early in the morning because he preferred the commuter-crowded streets and tube stations for interacting with members of the homeless network. He had a talent for blending in with crowds, when he wanted to.
Events proceeded quickly after that. Sherlock was lead up amongst the palm trees and covered verandas to where more women were preparing parcels and baskets. The atmosphere was tense and somber, the women paying only brief attention to Sherlock before returning to focus on their tasks. Groups of men, none paying any mind to Sherlock, bundled away sections of houses and various goods, lashing them tightly to trees. There were far fewer people than Sherlock had seen during his first visit. Of the perhaps hundred villagers, only a dozen men and women remained, working diligently around him. The unfamiliar language swirled between them and no one addressed Sherlock, but he did receive several reassuring smiles here and there. A heavy basket was placed in his arms and he was urged along with the group as they disembarked up the side of the mountain.
After being so high, the two men, breathing fast and drenched in cum and sweat, took a while to come down. John felt his softened cock slip from Sherlock's wet hole. The tension in his muscles began to relax and he lowered himself down onto Sherlock, shifting to the side and feeling comfortable in his arms. The pair snuggled quietly and John felt the wave of fatigue wash over him.
Sherlock to relax. He pressed in with one finger, just past the double ring of muscle and stilled. Sherlock gasped at the intrusion.
Sherlock never talked about his family or his past. Beyond Mycroft, John knew nothing of the people or events of his mad flatmate's early life. John was a medical man, he saw the signs that Sherlock had a history of drug abuse and likely other traumas. They never talked about it, and Sherlock had been sober and apparently healthy since John moved into Baker Street.
"Henry Booker, I guess Donovan was right. I am like him in some ways. What he did was heinous, of course. Inexcusable. But, I know, a bit, what it's like. Being so alone. I was always alone. It's tempting to just... give up. To get trapped in your own head. I was Henry's age when I started to figure it out. But, I had a friend, I guess he wasn't so... fortunate."
"Delightful, I was quite tired, I didn't get up until near noon," Sherlock responded around a bite of salad. He stopped chewing, and studied John's face as suspicion took over his features. "Why?"
John let go of Sherlock's cock, using his right hand to slick his own length with the remaining lube. He pulled his fingers from Sherlock and crawled back up over Sherlock's chest, bracketing the younger man's shoulders between his hands as he leaned over him. John looked into his eyes then lowered himself for another kiss as he lined the head of his cock up with Sherlock's hole.
He kept gently trying to soothe his flatmate, but despite the passage of several minutes, Sherlock was still inconsolable. John considered whether he should try to wake Sherlock. Speak loudly to him? Turn on the lights? But what was the sense in interfering? Sherlock's brilliant mind was working through something, and he was safe here in his room with John. It was better to leave things be.
Sherlock had found great pleasure and pride in building a simple 1-room house where he keeps his meager belongings. He constructed the round grass walls and palm frond roof in imitation of the dwellings he saw in the Islanders' village, using the plant fiber ropes they had so generously given him. Though the grass house is just large enough for him to lay down inside, he prefers to sleep outside adjacent to the lagoon and beneath the low canopy made of sail cloth. He finds the closed space of the windowless room disagreeable, and he struggles to remember how ordinary he once found the stuffy parlors and classrooms of his former life.
As usual, Sherlock was already up the next morning when John came down from his room. He was lying on the couch still in his pajamas reading one of John's medical journals. A brief word of good morning, two cups of tea, and when John went to sit in his chair and read the newspaper, he caught sight of Sherlock's eye. It was worse than the day before.
Several moments of comfortable quiet passed between the friends. Finally, Sherlock jumped up off the couch and headed to the kitchen. "I have work to do, John."
The weather has shifted. Though it is still plenty warm, it rains heavily for a brief time almost every day. When these downpours occur, Sherlock often sits under his sail cloth, or stands out naked in the rain to clean the dirt and salt from his skin.
John took Sherlock into a firm but brief embrace. With both hands on the sides of Sherlock's head, he touched their foreheads together, allowing Sherlock the opportunity to momentarily savor the smell of John's skin: sea salt and freshly fallen ocean rain. Then, abruptly, John pushed him away into the hands of the patiently waiting women and Sherlock glimpsed the conflicted look in his friend's eyes. Quiet panic gripped Sherlock's chest as he watched John quickly turn and lunge back into the sea, disappearing beneath the rain speckled surface of the strangely placid lagoon. Sherlock wanted to yell, to go after his friend. He would swim out into the deep water and John would certainly return, holding him in the safety of his tentacles as he always did. But Sherlock did not go after John, he remained frozen where he stood, surrounded by these strange women. He watched as the dark form moved away from shore beneath the clear waters until it disappeared in the distance. John had left him behind.
He reached over and grabbed my arm, pulling me towards the mattress. My head slammed back down onto my pillow. It was then that I heard the pitter patter of four little feet and quiet shushing from one girl to the other. I shut my eyes and tried to calm my breathing.
"I am perfectly capable of being alone for a few hours, John." He said, setting Indie down after she had given him a goodbye kiss.
"How can you be sure, Sherlock, do you have x-ray vision now? Don't tell me you ran some crazy genetic testing behind my back."
"Thank you, Mrs. Hudson. Happy Christmas Eve to you." John said, kissing her cheek. He left the flat, a chorus of "bye, Papa!" following him out the door.
Sherlock reached out towards John, beckoning him to come over to him. John walked over and sat on the edge of the sofa, taking Sherlock's thin hand in his.
"We were riding and she stopped and I turned around and there was blood everywhere! She didn't fall or anything, she just was bleeding! Is she going to go to heaven now, Papa, I don't want her to go right now!"
"Happy Christmas to everyone again, I hope you all are enjoying the lovely presents you got this morning. I just have a few more presents to give."
Along with the therapy appointments, Indie was going to more and more doctor's visits, getting her medications adjusted to make her as comfortable as we could as she became weaker and weaker. She was missing school much more often and sleeping longer.
John hadn't realized he was staring at Sherlock in such a way and quickly closed his mouth. "Sherlock," he said, "are you sure you want to go to another case? I mean, with what happened last night…"
"Thank you, Papa!" Indie shouted before giving me a kiss on the cheek. I set them down and they ran to show off their lockets.
A bowl was placed in front of me and I pushed it away. I looked up in surprise as it was pushed back at me, quite forcefully, by a very stern looking Indigo.
We were going off of her cues, she knew when she was ready to stop school, when she was too tired to go out with Aunt Molly and Mrs. Hudson, when her legs hurt too much to walk down stairs and one of us had to carry her.
The case was out in the countryside, green rolling hills flying past them as they sat in the cab. Sherlock sat far away from John, his body tensed and his hands sitting on his lap balled into fists. John couldn't help but stare at him, and for the first time noticed the small details that held a world of secrets. The nose he always thought was perfect was slightly crooked. Sherlock's left arm was just a bit shorter than his right, as if it hadn't grown quite right. His right foot was turned in as if someone had twisted it. A scar peeked out from the bottom of Sherlock's hairline where a gash once was.
Sherlock brought her hand to his lips, gently kissing it before placing it back onto the bed. He straightened up and looked Mycroft in the eye. Mycroft straightened and looked at his younger brother, his face stony. It almost looked as if they were ready to fight each other.
They were all charming, but none of them could compare to the pictures we had gotten of River and Indie.
We hadn't noticed the door open in the middle of our conversation, or the slim figure with a white coat standing in the doorway.
"Oh, this is so lovely, John! Sherlock will be so surprised!" Molly said as she greeted me, handing me a small gift bag.
"My darling…" Sherlock said, getting up and wrapping River in a hug, tears forming in his eyes. He pulled away and kissed her on the forehead, tears beginning to stream down her face.
I thought I had long run out of tears, but they started to pour down my cheeks. Jack whined and licked my face.
"Sherlock, come, sit down on the sofa here," John stepped towards his love, his hands held out in front of him. Sherlock wordlessly nodded, reaching his right hand out to John. He took it, frowning at how cold it was. It was only then that he noticed Sherlock's hair was wet and his body was trembling ever so slightly.
"Her fingers had that brown paint you put on the kitchen table when Daddy made a bunch of holes in it!" River said from Sherlock's lap, hands on her hips and quite proud of herself.
Her lips turned into a smile and she began to laugh, its sweet notes ringing throughout the room. She flung her arms around Sherlock and snuggled up against him, chewing on his t-shirt.
She squealed and began to march around with me. We danced in circles, the ducks following our every move, until she stopped and sat down on the cold rocks.
"And another thing, Sherlock, how incredibly rude of you to just bolt out of that room without even a goodbye or thank you. You missed seeing one of your daughters…"
"I don't want Indie to stay here anymore, Daddy!" River said, with a kick of her foot against the bed.
She smiled at me, obviously proud as a peacock. I ruffled her blonde curls and she leaned into my chest, wrapping her arms around my middle.
I laughed and ruffled her messy curls. I carried her into the front room where Sherlock was already sitting with River and Mrs. Hudson sat next to them, holding two muffins with candles stuck into them, her usual birthday greeting.
"Did the girls find proper dresses?" Sherlock asked as he straightened up and stretched out his arms.
That night we did whatever the girls wanted to do, Chinese takeaway was ordered, we sung along with Frozen, made mountains of bubbles in the bathtub, and read two books in bed.
They spent the next few months in and out of doctors' appointments, Sherlock growing weaker as time went on. River and Charlotte spent more and more time at 221B Baker Street, afraid that he would leave them soon.
I stepped over and took River into my arms and rocked her. She waved over my shoulder as Mrs. Hudson was helped down the stairs by an expressionless Sherlock, his back straight as an arrow.
"You'll do so well, Sunshine, look there's toys and other children to play with, they're already waving to you."
River stopped digging and ran to her sister at the edge of the sea. She took the shell from her sister's hand and turned it repeatedly in her own, rubbing the sand away from it.
"That was fun, Papa!" River shouted as she and Indie skipped back to the car. Indie followed that with a "Thank you, Papa!"
I closed my eyes and tried to ignore the idiotic songs being sung by the equally idiotic cartoon mouse. I brushed Indigo's tiny hand with my finger, the rhythm of her chest rising and falling lulling me into sleep.
I quickly pulled my phone out and went through my picture gallery, remembering a picture I had taken of the girls in early September.
Curse this cruel world that had taken her, destroying my family, leaving only memories and sunflowers behind.
Everyone shuffled about getting ready to go outside, even Mycroft. I pulled down the fire escape and up we went, leaving tracks on the soft layer of snow that lay on the roof. I saw Sherlock's back turned to me and picked up a ball of snow, hurling it him, hitting him square on the head.
"Thank you, Molly, we truly appreciate everything. Well, I think we're here, by the looks of the impatient little girl I see ahead of us." Molly laughed as we hurried to catch up to the others who were already waiting by the door of the dress shop.
"She has strep throat, she'll be alright once we get her temperature down and some fluids and antibiotics into her. Help me get her undressed."
The belt came down again and again, Sherlock crying out for his mother, his brother, someone, anyone that could help him. His cries grew weaker with every lash, until finally, he was silent.
John said nothing, what could he say really? He simply wrapped his arms around Sherlock and pulled him close. He kissed his nose, the spot on his skull that was slightly dented in, underneath the once bruised eyes, on the jutting collarbone that had been broken so many times.
John trotted down the stairs, adding to the landscape of sensual information. It was not an unpleasant addition. John was in a good mood; it was audible in his step.
Sherlock stood up too and arrested John's departure by placing his hands on John's shoulders. Perhaps he didn't understand many of the things Sherlock said or did but he did have a singular understanding of Sherlock himself as counter-intuitive as that was. “John,” he said.
He got dressed, pausing only to check the news again, then ran back upstairs because John hadn't showed up. It turned out John was still in bed, curled up around his pillow, trying to keep sleeping. Sherlock wasn't going to let that happen. He went to John's closet and pulled out random clothes, throwing them at him.
John either ignored it or didn't notice it. “I got there and the man wouldn't let me in, but I persuaded him.” John made a fist with his left hand and Sherlock looked at it, noticing it was bruised. He'd taken Herbert down with his bare hands? “And then… then I opened the door and you acted really weird.”
“Tea, then?” John asked, forcing Sherlock out of his considerations. He was touching Sherlock's elbow again, looking up at him with that expression of pure John-ness that Sherlock could no longer be without.
“Maybe… don't joke about murder?” John shrugged a little at him as he arrived, then made one of those apologetic expressions at Lestrade and Donovan. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
He looked at John. Furrowed brows: anger. Down-turned mouth: disappointment, sadness. Avoiding eye-contact: guilt. Tense body: feeling righteous.
“Clear,” John called out, voice a little muffled. Lestrade was readying himself to go in as well, but that Sherlock wasn't going to allow so he hobbled in and through as gracefully as he could under the limitations of the situation and his own body.
“Thanks..?” John's reply was a little hesitant but he had placed his hands lightly on Sherlock's hips.
And honestly? A personal (semi)romantic relationship with an adrenaline junkie ex-soldier doctor with anger issues was a multi-level challenge (particularly for someone unaccustomed to relationships in general). Granted, their relationship was still fairly new, barely two months. Something bubbled up from Sherlock's subconscious, but took its time to form to a coherent thought. By the time the words were clear they had exited the cab and were standing in the courtyard of Gibson's makeshift murder laboratory.
“Both will be returned to you as you leave the premises,” Mycroft stepped out and then gestured for Sherlock to do the same. “Sans everything you had in your pockets and the pictures you took.”
John glanced at the door to the attic flat, but even he realised it was too obvious. “All right.” He waited a moment for further instruction but there was none, Sherlock had lapsed back into his mind.
Sherlock looked away from John's glare. He had no intention of helping that annoying box of whines and source of mangled English OR her friend. Or possibly whoever had or had not kidnapped her. If her friend was as shrill and mind-numbing, they'd surely either kill her (in which case rescuing her was a moot point) or just quietly let her go (in which case the above held as well). It'd all probably become another point of contention between him and John, which would hardly be a surprise.
He made a frustrated noise and smacked the desk with his palm, then spun away and stalked out of the lab. He'd let the case slip through his fingers (not that it was taken from him), but there had been no way he could've known that it was of interest to the
“A suspect, then?” John lightened up a little, he was a good listener and liked to take part in any narrative, even when he was mostly distracting and not at all helpful. “Had the police already traced the e-mail address?
“It was quite quiet that day, so I heard it over in the office when that man suddenly laughed. He'd been asleep just a few minutes earlier, so I got up to check on him and saw a man in civilian clothing bending over his bed, his back to me. No civilians in the base so I approached them and asked for the man to identify himself. He didn't make any reply and just walked out. I followed, but once I got out of the building I didn't see him anywhere. The layout of the base was very open and it was in the middle of a sunny day, and there was nowhere he could have gone in the few seconds it took for me to get out behind him.”
John had an eye for things like that, but Sherlock moved away from him and across the floor to the computer desk and gave the mouse a tap to wake up the monitors. Both of them revealed a split view once visible. The left-hand side monitor showed two still pictures of the flats where the bodies had been found; the right-hand side monitor showed nearly the same, but the feeds were live.
“Whatever,” Sherlock said and went to squeeze into the garden. John kept confiscating everything sharp-edged he handled. As if Sherlock didn't know how to wield an edged weapon and as if he would even consider murdering someone in such a crude manner (except in self-defence). Then there was a text from Molly.
“I meant, you great big idiot,” (too smug), “that the case didn't happen because you went out, did it?”
“Because I'm male,” Sherlock nodded. He'd known this was coming. Renegotiaton of the terms of their social contract. Was there a trial period in these things?
Sherlock's legs barely worked so John had to drag him down the corridor to the lift. He knew John was asking him something, could sense the vibrations of his voice through his body and knew his ears could hear them, but his brain refused to process anything than the horror. The bone-eating, muscle-tearing fright he'd never felt before. It was textbook fight or flight and he was fleeing.
Sherlock had just been about to ask that, but stayed quiet. “All right, I'll assume the worst. Using the ambient temperature as a guide you'll have about an hour before hypothermia. Up to which rib is the water?”
“You probably have some last words, Mr Holmes, but unfortunately you are not in the condition to speak them, and I'm a bit rushed for time. Do you mind if we just skip to the end?” She was still looking at him, only flicking his eyes towards John once he made a little sound, sliding himself in the opposite direction from Sherlock. “Stop moving, Dr Watson.”
“A little elaboration wouldn't hurt,” John said, glancing at Sherlock. He'd grabbed the gate by its rungs and shook it a little. The hinges were rusty and clearly it hadn't been used in a while, but the same could be said about the house as well. The back garden was even wilder than the one in the front, and quite a lot of ground had been taken over by unpruned hawthorn (
“15th century ink,” Sherlock supplied. “Different from carbon ink in the sense that it penetrates the parchment instead of merely adhering to the surface of it. The Voynich manuscript is from the 15th century. Hardly a coincidence.”
“Yes, but it won't happen again,” Sherlock replied which was a blatant lie and only meant to soothe John. He had no idea what would happen if he came face to face with Alice Waite again. “I know her tricks now.” Another lie.
“I don't regret my decision,” Sherlock continued. “But you regret your indecision. That isn't my fault.”
“Yeah,” John said. “I thought so.” He looked at Sherlock and reached over with his left hand to touch Sherlock's shoulder again. Despite everything it was gratifying to have John want to touch him.
“You're not my doctor.” Sherlock closed his eyes and listened to John's slow tapping of his laptop's keyboard. John probably was his doctor. Even if he wasn't as observant as Sherlock would've liked, he did have some professional ability in diagnosis.
“Gotcha,” John said softly and smiled. He wasn't smug like Sherlock had expected (or like Sherlock would've been). “When did you last sleep?”
“John,” he said hoarsely, having freed himself of the collapse. He turned his head, watching over his shoulder as the junk slowly moved and fell through the floor, causing the sound of faint splashes below. “John,” he said again, louder. “John!”
There was a side door, a fire exit, and Sherlock mimed shooting a gun at the lock, but John shook his head with an exasperated look and tried the door. It was locked, but it bent with John's weight as he leaned against it.
Sherlock grimaced and rubbed his hands through his hair. John needed to learn to stop expecting that Sherlock would listen to him when he was being uninteresting.
Sherlock stopped listening after that, his cognitive processes had more important things to do. The murderer still lived at the house where the wall-paper was from, he was quite certain. Eighty percent. The five suicides and the murder had to have been his work, but like all serial killers, he'd wanted wanted more and had elaborated on his earlier works. Serial killers started killing when fantasising was no longer enough, or when other brutal acts didn't satisfy them any more. The first kill might be enough for months, but then he'd have to do it again and again, with a shorter interval every time because the rush wouldn't last as long as it had before. They lost control.
“Come on,” Sherlock said and tilted his head towards the exit. The autopsy wasn't going to give them anything until the tox screen (and even then it was highly unlikely in Sherlock's estimation; he could tell when someone was on drugs).
John began to say something, Sherlock could hear how he inhaled in the strange soundscape of the brimming house, between the creaks and shifts, and then there was a crack, but not a sharp crack, a damp one. Rotten wood giving up under (years and years) of weight, newly agitated by the added pressure of two people walking over it. Sherlock's personal time dilated. He heard John's gasp and how the walls began to collapse. The rubble cascaded over him, forcing him forward and onto his stomach on the floor while behind him John obviously struggled, starting to say something, but then forced into a breathless yelp instead and then (seemingly ages later) several things hitting water, one of them undoubtedly John Watson.
Sherlock had moved to the door of the building and punched a code into the keypad with some flourish and was rewarded with a click as the door unlocked. He entered with a bit of a prance, feeling the consternation from John.
Sherlock had arrived at the same conclusion. He picked up the hand and put it on a stainless steel tray, then brought it to another operating table to study.
He suffered from boredom and pain, from dullness and aches, from thirst and hunger and from the tediousness of not being physically at his best. He valued the physical side of things as well. Mycroft didn't, which is why he was fat and sedentary and utterly useless. John did, to a degree, though sometimes he preferred being lazy and also sedentary. Sherlock felt hard-pressed to sit down for eating at times, everything everything everything moved about a hundred times faster in his brain and in his body, and he could only tame those electrical impulses in his muscles with physical action. Right now he felt trapped in his body.
“John!” he said, though what he meant was ‘for God's sake, could you be any slower, get on with it or I will!’
“If you set me on fire I will kill you,” he hissed, not wanting to raise his voice because of the oppressive atmosphere.
“I'm bored,” Sherlock replied, once again underwhelmed by John's performance. The man had been a soldier and it was this easy to sneak into his room while he slept and surprise him.
“Yeah, of course,” John replied. “Got it in my mouth, eyes, nose... Probably going to get swimmer's ear.” His voice was quite a lot fainter as Sherlock turned around the corner to the left, only to see another similar passageway leading into darkness.
“He thinks I'm lovely,” she said in a tone of voice that implied she didn't quite believe him. It wasn't surprising, her self-confidence wasn't the best. Then she turned and gave him a look. “You chose John because he said you were amazing. How is that any different?”
“It's possible,” Sherlock admitted. “But I'm not obligated to save everyone, not even everyone who is a client.”
“Not the killer,” Sherlock remarked over his shoulder to Lestrade and John, ignoring her comment. Face-recognition was unavoidable these days. “You were one of the first to move in, but not the first. Who was the first?” he demanded from the lady, bracing the cane between the door and the door jamb.
“If the soldier who died of cerebral oedema had only described seeing his grandfather, you would've dismissed it as a hallucination caused by his condition, yes? However, you also saw the man he recognised as his grandfather. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, thus it could have been the energy that formerly operated his grandfather's body that visited him.”
Sleeping was a skill and Sherlock wasn't very skilled at sleeping. For years he had assumed everyone slept like he did, or rather, didn't sleep. Everyone went to bed and then spent two to four hours rolling around in abject misery*, didn't they? (*Misery, mis-er-y,
“Rational. I can accept that,” Sherlock replied. He'd managed to shift a box enough to shine the light down the hole. John's face was pale against the shifting mass of dark water, perhaps one and a half metres below the level of the floor. “Is there a current?” he asked.
John looked up from his mobile, sitting in his chair. The harsh blue light of the phone screen made his face glow in the dark room. His hair looked white and his eyes colourless. “You left the shower on.”
“Bed? BED?” Sherlock paused, looking at John with his one good eye, and his mind was agitated (Lestrade must pay) with the loss of the (his) case and the house arrest. “John,” he growled.
“What's that?” John asked. He was still there, accustomed to Sherlock's absences and non-sequiturs. Oddly he hadn't demanded Sherlock explain anything yet. Perhaps he was just biding his time.
"I think it's time to be off, girls, tell everyone Happy Christmas." I said, grabbing their freshly washed coats to shrug onto them.
Mrs. Hudson dropped Sherlock's slippers into the corner and, finding nothing else to tidy, came to me and enveloped me in a hug.
Sherlock returned and set the pajamas he had brought with him on the floor. I handed Indie to him as he handed me the medicine.
Then he began to play with his food, putting a green bean on his lip as a mustache, encouraging the girls to do the same, and even slapped a green bean on Sherlock's nose. Sherlock's eyes narrowed as he brushed off the offending vegetable, muttering under his breath. But he was giving that half-smile I knew and loved, only his pride keeping him from laughing out loud. The girls laughed and played with Greg as we all reveled in the joy that had temporarily chased away the sadness and anxiety permeating the flat.
"Bye-bye, Papa!" River yelled from her station at the counter where she was squashing a mitten shaped cookie cutter into dough.
At that point, he flipped the switch and the ceiling of the limo brilliantly lit up with small bright dots against the black fabric of the ceiling. They were the constellations that were in the sky tonight.
The sounds of water lapping against the shore, children laughing, and the wind in the trees escorted us out of the park, saying goodbye to the little girl that would never again play in its soft grass, never again dance at the water's edge.
Sherlock hung up the phone and set it on the table. He leaned forward with his hands steepled, ready to dash up the stairs as soon as he was needed.
I adjusted a sleeping Indie in my arms and said, "There's enough room there for all of us, we can hardly ask Mrs. Hudson to cook a Christmas dinner for 8, and there's grounds for the girls to play on at the estate. We can't keep them cooped up in this flat on a day where all they want to do is run around and play."
"Another nappy change, darling? Hm, I hope you aren't becoming ill." Sherlock said, grabbing a thermometer as well.
The next day, the contents of my study had been pushed into our bedroom and into storage, the dark walls painted over with lavender, a border of butterflies around the top edge. White wooden furniture was placed in the room, her bed against the far corner, and her toys sat neatly in drawers, her dollhouse at the foot of her bed.
We spent another half hour chatting, the girls periodically running to the window to check whether Sherlock and Greg were back.
I drummed my fingers on the arm of the chair I was in and typed in a number on my phone and pressed the green circle.
"Excuse me everyone, I'll be right back," I said, making my way to the bathroom. I could feel Sherlock's eyes following me as I passed him.
The doctor's office was nice. Oak walls with oak furniture to match. Pictures of children decorated the walls. I couldn't bear to think if those were the children she had saved, or the children she had lost.
River arrived home from school with Greg and Molly around 4 o'clock that afternoon, Mycroft arriving soon after. Mrs. Hudson had made us a roast chicken, mashed potatoes, and green beans for dinner. We sat around Indie, who had woken up feeling a tiny bit better, for dinner. She sat up in bed and took a bite of the mashed potatoes I fed her before pushing the plate away with a tired look on her face.
"I feel much better, Papa! Daddy already checked me for a fever and I don't have one at all! And my legs don't hurt today, see?"
"Daddy tried, he tried really hard, but it kept falling down, so I called Uncle Mycroft and he and Daddy built it!" Indigo said, still leafing through a book in Sherlock's arms.
So much more was said silently; fatigue, bruising at a light bump. She was getting a little worse, a little bit sicker.
Grabbing blue popsicles for myself and Indigo, I sat back down next to her and handed her the sickeningly blue confection.
The girls immediately stiffened. They were highly intelligent and sensitive children and could see right through our lame attempts to hide our sadness and anxiety from them.
River Grace was a girl who needed to understand the world in a logical way, always questioning 'Why?'
He kissed her and put her on my lap, the corner of my mouth upturning when I noticed the smudge of flour on his cheek from Indigo's flour covered hands. He gave me a quick kiss and went to River, kissing her as well. Mrs. Hudson hurried into the kitchen and shoved a plate of cookies into John's hands.
Sherlock patted her on the head, his eyes shining down on her with such intense love. I quickly pulled up the camera on my phone and took a picture.
"John, there is no need to treat me like one of the victims you always love to coddle, nothing happened," Sherlock snapped, his eyebrows furrowed in anger, but his eyes briefly flashing with fear.
"There's nothing to worry about," he said, and with that he was gone, his brisk footsteps echoing up the stairs. John sighed and grabbed his jacket, following Sherlock.
"I think we should take her back home, a sea snail is happiest in the sea, don't you think my loves?"
Dear Mrs. Hudson has been in and out of hospital with pneumonia since Christmas. She still insists on making us lunch and dinner, although your Papa has been making more meals for all of us as of late. Throughout the night, she'll tell her favorite stories about you and River. "Seeing those girls was my favorite part of the day," she always says. I am worried about your Nana Hudson. She has begun to speak of seeing you again. She's been with me since the beginning of my adventures on Baker Street and I cannot bear the thought of losing her.
"Now Sherlock, she's sleeping, they gave her medicine to prevent more seizures and it makes people sleep, she's hooked up to IVs and monitors, there's a lot of stuff going on around her right now." I said to him outside of the door. I had no idea how he was going to react.
They told him to look through the telescope and directed him where to look for the constellations I had pointed out.
Mycroft and the girls standing in front of a T-rex fossil, Sherlock and I and the girls sailing boats on the pond on Mycroft's property, the girls and I in front of the penguin exhibit at the zoo, River and Indie lying on a picnic blanket reading a book together. I had even managed a photo of Sherlock and Mycroft standing somewhat near each other and looking mildly happy.
They fell asleep hand in hand as they always did, thin fingers intertwined with rough, calloused ones.
I was furious, how dare he leave at such an important time! It didn't matter what we were having, boys or girls, as long as they were healthy.
The next day, Sherlock and John set out several brightly colored flowers in the planter boxes outside the front room windows. They would watch the butterflies and hummingbirds come and go, always smiling when sunshine yellow wings would appear.
My heart tore with each word I spoke. I wasn't sure if I believed my own words, but, for John, it was always for John.
River was already awake when I walked in the room and was bouncing around Sherlock, asking him when they could leave, again and again. Indie still lay on the couch where Sherlock had laid her down.
"Of no concern? Sherlock, you were so afraid of me, scared that I was going to hurt you," John said, as gently as he could. He took a step towards Sherlock cautiously, hands in his pockets.
He loved us with all of his might, and I knew that he would fear for us with all of his might. I had to tread carefully and prepare my love to see our sick daughter to try and stem the flood of emotion I knew was building up.
"Don't you want to go back to your room, my darling?" I said, brushing back curls from her forehead.
"Well I suppose that's our cue, love," I said, kissing the top of his head and rolling to the side of the bed.
"Yes, Papa, I miss that beach. I think Indie would want me to go back and have fun. She was so fun, Papa, she was my best friend."
But Indie's leg seemed to get better, Sherlock and River seemed to return to normal, and the whole thing was nearly forgotten. I chalked to whole thing up to a sprained ankle, an overprotective father, and our daughter simply copying her father's behavior.
"Calm down, John, they're the most beautiful girls in the world, their pictures will be impeccable." I said as I stood the girls up in front of me and fixed their dresses where they had been mussed.
"I know, why don't we play a bit of charades! River, come here with me and I'll tell you what we're going to act out." Mrs. Hudson said with a clap of her hands.
This morning was no different, my good morning met only with a frighteningly cool glare. He sat at the desk, looking through Indie's coloring books for the twentieth time this week. His hair was untamed and he had left his growing stubble. A crust of crimson lay on his bottom lip and his eyes were sunken, a deep purple halo forming around them.
I was going to take the girls, along with Molly and Mrs. Hudson, out to the shops to find dresses for their party in a week. Sherlock decided he wanted to be surprised and refused to go shopping with us.
He put his hands over hers to stop her from banging the blocks. He looked at her small lip turning downward and immediately regretted his decision. She began to sniffle and he knew he had only seconds before she began to wail. He scooped her up and hurried downstairs.
"Look at this Uncle Greg, there's a picture of me, River, Papa, and Daddy! They'll be with me all the time."
River, meanwhile, was bouncing next to Mrs. Hudson and Molly, the locket swinging in her hand with each bounce.
The girls' tears had stopped at this point, telling them that we no longer had to be in this hospital calmed them enough, their immediate fears were gone. John had a strange look on his face and opened his mouth to say something, but I quickly shook my head.
"Go ahead, John, it's only until 7, plenty of time before the girls will go to sleep. Your patients need you. The girls and I will manage for a few hours." Sherlock said, shutting his laptop and walking over to me. He kissed me gently on the forehead.
"Mr. Peterson, you have tested positive for the flu, and you're past the window for any medication to shorten the illness. Please take time off from work, rest, drink plenty of fluids, and wash your hands to try and prevent the spread of the illness." I said as I opened the door for my 10th flu patient of the day.
"I have to run to the loo, I'll be right back," River said, leaving Sherlock alone with her husband.
Lights and 'Happy Birthday!' banners were strung across the walls, food was set out, and our gifts for Sherlock were wrapped. I put Jack in his red bow tie collar from Christmas as River and Indie handed out party hats and noisemakers of various colors to each guest as they came in.
I gently placed my ear against her chest, just to hear her heart beat. I lost myself in that comforting sound, the sound that meant my daughter was still alive, still with me.
He took a tissue from the table and wiped tears from Indie's face, sitting down on the arm of the chair.
"Sherlock, it's alright," John tried again. This time he sat back on his heels and waited for Sherlock to move. He had evaluated countless victims of abuse and he knew that they needed to make all of the moves. They needed that control that had been viciously taken from them.
I had found Sherlock and Indie in the bathroom, Indie coughing up blood and Sherlock in an absolute panic, his eyes wild with fear. I grabbed Indie from him and ran with her into the front room, Sherlock running behind me.
My inspection ended and I sat at her side, waiting for John to return. I felt a tug at my hand and looked up to see Indigo watching me.
She squirmed against my arms and I set her down. I held her hand as we walked, slowly, to the patch of grass without snow where the ducks gathered, waiting for someone to throw a piece of bread or two.
"Papa, I'm just fine, work has been hectic. There's a little girl there now who I'm about to send home on hospice, she's the most beautiful girl, little brown curls and big brown eyes…" she trailed off. "But, she's a fighter, maybe she'll surprise us and pull through," she finished, a sad smile on her face, eyes distant.
The gravity of that sentence completely flew over River's head, but sent Mrs. Hudson into a new round of crying.
"No, my love, you're safe, you're safe right here with me and I won't let anyone hurt you ever again, I promise you," John said, his hand brushing through swirls of inky curls.
She grumpily shook her head no and she laid her head on my shoulder. Sure enough, within minutes, she was fast asleep. Sherlock smiled at me and leaned his head back, closing his eyes, probably heading into his mind palace for the rest of the trip. Mrs. Hudson and I chatted quietly until we pulled up to the hotel we were holding the party at. She shook Sherlock gently until he came back to us. I scooted out of the car holding River and Sherlock did the same with Indie. We went into the hotel and found a room by the ballroom to lay the girls down to let them finish their naps.
Greg nodded his goodbye to us, and with that they left, hanging onto each other for dear life. The front door closed and I heard Molly cry into the night, her scream echoing down Baker Street.
After a few moments and soft grumbles, she let me change her out of her pajamas and back into the outfit she had on during the morning. She held her arms up to me as we were getting ready to go back downstairs.
"Sherlock, we know that her illness is aggressive, with a rapid decline. Indie will be dancing and playing one day, and the next she'll be too fatigued to get out of bed, too sick to eat, too weak to even move," I said, my voice breaking, "You blocked all the keywords concerning her illness from our web search and hid all my textbooks about pediatric oncology soon after our last meeting with the doctor. You told me that we knew all that we needed to know about what the coming months would bring and we didn't need the temptation to keep researching about it, trying to find a cure that doesn't exist."
Through the crack in the door, I saw him sit on the couch and pull her into his lap. Her head lay on his chest listlessly and her eyes drooped closed, a smile ghosting over her pale face as Sherlock talked with her.
"Okay Sherlock, you know the drill, go into the study and don't you dare come out here while I'm getting your presents ready."
I stepped over to my family, taking a sunflower from the jar and breaking the stem. I placed it behind River's ear, the bright yellow petals framed beautifully by her dark raven hair. John took his phone out and snapped a photo.
Mrs. Hudson and I sat with River on the floor later that day, playing one of those memory card games with her. Sherlock was back upstairs, his violin drawing out that haunting melody. A few more minutes went by before the song ended with a screech and Sherlock was suddenly in the doorway, a lost expression on his face.
We ate with happy conversation, River finishing her stew, Indie left about half. I had managed to get my bowl down to Jack, who dutifully sat at my feet during every meal. I did give him more food from the table than even the girls, and certainly more than John, who playful shook his head at the little dog when Jack began to beg.
He came up a few moments later and settled himself on Indie's bed across from me. River had laid back down with her sister and both were settling into sleep, a routine we had adopted since we moved Indie into the hospital bed.
Papa and I are considering getting another little pug soon. Five years have come and gone since we lost our dear Jack. I know that he is with you now and can imagine him lounging on your feet, keeping them warm as he did when you were here. I see you both frolicking through warm fields of flowers and grass and I am content that you both have each other again.
Jack lay in the middle of the floor, chewing on a stuffed red bone that the girls had gotten him for Christmas, surrounded by a sea of red and green paper and opened boxes. River was sitting on the couch with Greg and Mycroft, telling them how to take care of the egg sitting on her lap so that the little toy bird inside would hatch. Indie sat by the fireplace with Sherlock and Molly, who were helping her pick outfits to dress her new dolls. The girls were dressed in matching long-sleeved red plaid nightgowns and fuzzy red socks. I fiddled with three packages in my hand, wrapped in green paper with a red bow on top. I hadn't put these under the tree, I wanted them to stand alone.
Little hands pounded on the door and I opened it only to have two excited little girls attach themselves to my legs.
River sat and told her about the children in the ward, those who were recovering and those who were not.
I nodded my head and wiped tears from my eyes. I heard Mycroft call for me and as I went into the hallway, I saw Mrs. Hudson sit on the bed and hold Indie's blanket in her hands, rubbing her thumb over the soft fabric. She folded the blanket, small sobs escaping her as she slowly began to straighten up the table next to her, putting dull crayons back in boxes, closing coloring books with pictures that would never be finished, and gathering the dolls that would never be played with again.
His shaking hand reached slowly for the placemat, until finally he weakly grabbed the edge. I took his hand from my arm and gently tugged him forward until he was next to the opened drawer.
"I can't write about my favorite part of summer because none of it was my favorite part because Indie wasn't there," she said, more tears welling up in her eyes.
He glanced up at Sherlock. The corner of his mouth was twitching, his nostrils flared as he desperately tried to conceal his rage.
I felt a stab in my heart. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sherlock twitch, ever so slightly. It was never easy, for either of us, to listen to this wonderful, sweet, intelligent, but dying little girl declare the plans for her future. "A veterinarian, love, that's what a doctor for puppies are called."
If I had a camera with me, I would have taken a picture right then and there. Her smile was almost bigger than her face, her eyes shining with excitement, and her cheeks with a slight blush from all the attention. I hoped that the photographer, or someone, had captured that look on her face that I would sell the world for to see over and over again.
Sherlock picked up his phone when it began to vibrate in his hand. A call? No one ever called him. He glanced at the screen and saw it was from John. His heart began racing, he jumped up and began fiercely pacing back and forth, slamming his thumb on the little green circle.
John had quickly shot down that idea almost as quickly as he had shot that cabbie in their first case.
221B sat quietly for a few more moments, the fire casting a soft glow across the multitude of photographs that decorated the walls. John loved to take pictures of his darling girls, their toothless smiles and chubby cheeks the subjects of most of the photographs. Sherlock loved one in particular, it was one of John, holding the girls in their rocking chair, both of their downy heads resting on his shoulders. John's head was tilted slightly to one side, his eyes closed during a momentary nap.
My heart began to race, the panic closing in on me as I collapsed on the edge of the tub, grasping onto the edge for dear life, tears running down my cheeks. I was already forgetting her, my sweet Indie.
