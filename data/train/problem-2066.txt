"But Hudson!" Lord Holmes looked imploringly at his valet.
It had begun with John approaching his stepfather to ask about the small fund he knew that his mother had set aside for his education before she died. The Major had been furious with John and raged at him about the excessive cost of his keep as it was, let alone finding any extra money for schooling. It was with a sense of despair that John realized the Major had spent the money and had no intention of honouring John's mother's wishes. Feeling sick at heart when he was finally able to make his escape, John had hardly heard his stepfather raging on about how he was a costly burden that the Major could no longer afford.
Amidst the excited buzz, Sherlock stood on the wharf along with the rest of the crew, careful to bring no attention to himself. His eyes were drawn to John though; he stilled in a moment of fascination watching the morning sun, glorious in a blue sky scrubbed clean by wind and rain, reflect the gold of John's hair and light up the deep blue of his eyes, framed by golden lashes. It struck Sherlock in that moment what a beautiful boy John was and not just in his appearance. John appeared to glow with something brighter than sunlight, there was an essential goodness that radiated from some inner light source all John's own, that in Sherlock's eyes for a moment eclipsed even the brilliance of the Mediterranean sun. Sherlock shook his head and blinked at his absurdly poetic thoughts. Good grief! He had always dismissed poetry as ridiculous and now he was spouting it like Lord Byron? It must be due to the head injury...
Hudson's solicitous attention to John resumed in the morning. He arrived in John's cabin at the same time as a pink and blue dawn made its appearance through John’s porthole, ushering in another brilliant day at sea. Delighted with such an appreciative charge, Hudson had outdone himself by procuring not only a full breakfast but also a suit of clothing for John, obtained, he informed him, from the Captain who had purchased it from one of Constantinople’s expert tailors for his eldest son. Seeing John's face upon learning this, Hudson reassured him firmly that the Captain had been generously reimbursed and as his lordship’s guest John was to think nothing further of it.
All of this repulsed Lord Holmes. He was a fastidious man in his private life, in sharp contrast to his deliberately crafted reputation.  There had been few lovers and then only men of his social equal.  The thought of John trapped in some grimy tavern’s back room, terrified and weeping while a drunken patron forced himself on him, horrified Lord Holmes to a degree he had never felt before.  Trying to stay in control of his emotions, he damped down the white-hot rage flaring in his chest and settled for tightening his arms around John and promising him urgently, "Listen to me, John. I know life has been harsh for you and you aren't used to trusting anyone but believe me, I meant what I said when you first came to me, that I will make sure you get safely to England to find your family. I swear that to you!"
Lord Holmes paused for effect. "That is what I mean, John."
Gradually, whether due to his promise or his comforting embrace, Lord Holmes wasn't sure, but to his relief he felt John begin to soften against him.
John could only stand and watch, praying as hard as he could for Sherlock to prevail. He wasn't concerned for his own well-being; he was concerned only for Sherlock, knowing that if Sherlock was badly injured or killed, he himself would not want to go on living. This realization had just emblazoned itself onto his consciousness when suddenly what he feared the most happened; Sherlock, leaping backward, failed to fully evade a particularly aggressive swipe of the knife in his opponent's hand. It grazed across his chest; leaving a slickly glistening red streak in its path. Hudson and John both heard Sherlock's sharp intake of breath as he leapt sideways, this time to avoid a potentially fatal second strike.
“Yes, thank you M’Lord,” was all that John could think of to say, trying to inject as much enthusiasm into the words as he could.
It was here, at Hudson's urging John lay down to sleep in the early evening. Resting in his makeshift bed, comforted by the low murmur of Sherlock and Hudson's voices nearby, he watched the cool dusk creep down from the hills to eventually swallow the sea. He heard a goat bell ring high in the hills as a herd was gathered for the night. Fragrant night blooms mingled with the salty sea air teased his nose. He had never felt as happy as he closed his eyes and slept.
With the late summer storm bringing early darkness there was no help for it but to seek shelter before they reached the city. They spied, not far off the road, what appeared to be an abandoned farm house and made their way toward it. It was derelict; up close they could see boarded up broken windows and missing patches of white plaster on the foliage draped walls. Still, it would provide a modicum of shelter for the night.
John heard Hudson at his side murmur, “The Dowager Duchess of Lewisham.”
Sherlock raised John carefully so he could cut his bonds and free his arms.  This brought a gasp of pain from John as his shoulder took the full weight of his arm again.
"Your pardon sir, it is toward land." The first mate paused and unable to resist adding his own gloomy prediction, said darkly, "Pirates, like as not in this God-forsaken part of the world."
“Hmmm.” Hudson’s murmur was non-committal.
He continued in a softer tone, "Your unusual gift for medicine, specifically surgery, is evident in the skillfully executed sutures done by yourself using your right hand, your non-dominant hand, on the wound to your left arm. The wound has healed perfectly with no infection suggesting advanced knowledge of modern antiseptics. It is at least a year old. Performing surgery on your own wounds at age twelve or thirteen? You show an extraordinary talent John Watson."
“The blood loss was stopped by the bandaging but we must warm him and make him keep still Hudson! He is suffering from nervous shock.  He must stop agitating his mind!  Even if I had the proper supplies I daren’t stitch his wound until the shock is passed.”
Had John been any more alert he would have been surprised by the fleeting appearance of something like confusion or even less likely, bashfulness on Lord Holmes' face at John's exclamation of admiration. Whatever it was, however, it disappeared upon the interruption of Hudson entering the cabin at that moment, bearing food on a tray for John.
"There were two documents of code; one Lady Adler hid on her person, which later I began to suspect was a decoy, the other I found in her bedroom safe. You see, I had a sense that obtaining the first one had been too easy so I decided to search her room. I waited until she left for the Russian Embassy and in her room I did find and remove what I assumed was the real document."
The deadly dance continued, the brigand nearer to Sherlock now, closing the distance between them to only an arm's length. It was at this point that John saw, rather than heard, Sherlock mutter something to the other man. John had no idea what; the words were uttered in a low, pointed tone, obviously directed exclusively to the man he was fighting. Whatever was said though, it shattered the man's focus and he had an unmistakable moment of indecision. It was all Sherlock needed; with a lightning-fast foot, he kicked his opponent in lower leg, leaning back sharply as he did so to avoid the man's stabbing knife. Terrified as he was, John marveled at Sherlock's extraordinary speed; he was like liquid in motion as he avoided the deadly blades of his opponent.
Sherlock took advantage of the distraction to observe the soldiers in detail: unkempt uniforms… slovenly appearance… uneasy camaraderie; there was no trust among them, that was obvious… edgy and wary for some reason… Ah; so a rogue company then, deserters, probably trying to reach Gelibolu to find a ship to take them north to the Black Sea. It would have been too risky for deserters to try to escape back through their army's own lines, where if caught they'd be executed.
It was the last thing John wanted, for Sherlock to see him in this state and to know what the soldier had tried to do to him, so he hung his head limply feeling tears start into his eyes which only increased his sense of shame.
“I find I become most anxious when I do not know where you are, John. Please rest here beside me.”
"Lord Holmes, please!" was all John could choke out, his eyes wide with fear.
Hello patient readers,
But he knew the answer even before he asked the question. It was obvious.  I’ve fallen in love with him, haven’t I?  That’s what all this has been about. Love.  I’m in love with a man who believes I’m a 14 year old boy.  Oh, dear God, what have I done?
Having made provision for the welfare of the crew, Lord Holmes explained to Captain Barrow that if anyone was to enquire after himself or Hudson, they were to be informed that the only men observed disembarking the Wind Shadow in Sarköy were the crew. He and Hudson were to disappear from this moment forward. He then requested three crewmen's uniforms; one each for himself, Hudson and John.
Lord Holmes and John both were silent for a long moment following their exchange, contemplating the magnitude of what had just passed between them. Strange, thought John, how the thought of dying at the hand of Lord Holmes doesn't frighten me. What is it about this man that is so different?
It was in the salon car that they were interrupted suddenly.
Sherlock didn’t think that John was awake but his quiet weeping was rapidly turning into anguished sobbing so, prompted by his newly awakened heart twisting painfully in his chest, Sherlock acted.  Wanting only to alleviate John's suffering, he reached out, rolled John into his arms and cradled him close.
John, in severe distress, clung tightly to his saviour. It was too terrible to find himself in perilous danger once more when he had thought himself safe at last. The threat was made all the worse by having met Lord Holmes whose respect and affection toward him contrasted so greatly with the awful experiences of his former life. The thought of returning to the hell he'd escaped was all the more terrible for this. Now too, held in the security of Lord Holmes' arms, the possibly of being handed over to someone like the disgustingly depraved man who had touched him in his stepfather's study was unthinkable. The wonder of this comfort from Lord Holmes, which to anyone else would have been perceived as merely kindly paternal affection, was a revelation to John. It made the possibility of being pawed or much worse by another man, an incalculable horror. John was utterly distraught and beyond reason.
"Oh," said John faintly. But his heart felt lighter suddenly, for reasons he wasn’t sure of…
John, struggling with shyness at this unexpected praise, nodded and blushed in embarrassment. "I… wanted to help," he stammered.
John ducked his head and stepped back in humility, but Lord Holmes said lightly, with a wave of his hand, "No, no it's fine," and sitting, grinned at John, submitting his left temple for examination. "But I won't promise not to be the worst patient you've ever had."
They both remained awake; Sherlock reveling in his first experience of feeling love for another − and it had to be love, he reasoned, what else could make him feel this strong, this committed and this happy to be the protector and defender of another person? He had never had any patience with snobbery or social elitism, so it bothered him not that he should have become so attached to an unknown homeless boy in such a short time. He knew with a conviction that had been stealing over him for the last several days that John was his to nurture and love and the feeling was pure joy; he had experienced nothing like it before in his own rather lonely life.
“What was the outcome of the matters we discussed yesterday regarding John’s…er… unfortunate adventures in Constantinople, Hudson?”
No one, that is, except Molly Hooper. Molly was the daughter of the doctor posted to the embassy and John's only friend. She had done all that she could to help John during their growing-up years, providing him with meals and medicine from the dispensary as often as she could. They shared a mutual passion for medical science, which provided the only joy John had in his restrictive life.
Glancing over his shoulder at Hudson and Sherlock now, John sighed with relief. Then, reluctantly, because he was enjoying his sense of contentment, he decided it would be wise to rest.  Loath to give up the view, he sank down into the cushioned chair beneath the porthole from which he could still see the starlit sky, wanting to prolong the peaceful spell that the night had woven around him.
"You, Englishman? Nothing−for now. You and the old man can take advantage of our hospitality in the other room. The boy? He'll stay with us." He wrapped a rough hand around John's arm.
The sailing to Lesbos wasn’t a long one; the Lady Rose was a modern P&O liner under contract to deliver the royal mail and captained by an experienced merchant navy man who prided himself on promptness. They steamed into port in the early morning, a flotilla of local fishing and sailing boats bobbing from the shore to meet them.  Glad to be out of the stuffy cabin, enjoying the fresh air, the three leaned against the deck railing ready to go ashore once the Lady Rose was docked.
The claims attributed to Vin Mariani as being a wonder medicine were highly questionable.  It was made from South American coca leaves and contained at least 25 milligrams of cocaine per glass which was hardly good for one’s health as John was well aware. However, in medical circles it was known for its numbing qualities and was valued highly as a powerful painkiller; better than anything known to the medical world hitherto.
Morning's arrival did nothing to dispel the persistent chill in the air; the sunrise was filtered weakly through a bank of heavy grey clouds which had bloomed up from the not too distant coastline overnight. Perhaps another storm was brewing out at sea; the restless breeze that tugged at their clothes as they picked their slow way down the rocky, steep hillside toward Gelibolu certainly suggested it.
Seeing that he was awake, Lord Holmes leaned forward and spoke quietly, "John, I'm Lord Holmes, although I think you already know that. I want to assure you that there is no need to be afraid. I mean you no harm. We are alone in the cabin but there is no one on this vessel who will harm you either, you may take my word for that." When John didn't reply, he continued, "Hudson is not nearly as fearsome as he appears. At present, he is preparing something for you to eat." He glanced at the side table. "I'd like you to try to sit up and take a sip of the wine when you feel able, alright?"
The sun was very hot but the air was tempered by a breeze from off the water. In the shade, the afternoon was pleasant indeed.  Hudson and Sherlock seated themselves while John, who loved the water, chose to stroll along the shoreline.
At Hudson's knock and entrance, Lord Holmes whirled to glare fiercely at him, a sharp rebuke for the interruption obviously ready on his tongue. But at the sight of John standing limply beside his valet, he stilled before narrowing ice-blue eyes and fixing John with a piercing stare.
“You like it rough do you?” snarled the soldier, “So do I boy, I’ll show you rough! I’ll tear you apart!”
But John was so tired that he fell asleep before he could act on his intention to move outside, which is how Sherlock, sometime later, came to be awoken by his quiet weeping. Sherlock knew it was John.  He’d been aware of something dark in John's mood when they had first settled in the cave, over and above the shock and terror of the soldier’s attack. In fact, Sherlock had positioned himself close to John and even placed his own blanket over him once he had thought John asleep.  Now hearing John, he mentally kicked himself for not persisting in finding out what was bothering him because of course, he knew John would never volunteer the information for fear of inconveniencing them.
By then, Hudson had returned with the sterilized items and a jug of the boiled Germander tincture. He poured the tincture in the stream over the basin assisting John wash his hands as best he could.  The linen for the fresh bandages dried in minutes when placed in rays of the midday sun pouring through the open window.
“M’Lord has wired the Marquis,” said Hudson “Lord Bosham had made arrangements for our transportation to England as quickly as possible.”
Despite the hat, it might have been a pretty ensemble on someone less than half the Duchesses’ age, but as it was, the picture it was jarring… But, John supposed, if you were as rich and important as Duchess Lewisham obviously was, you could wear what you pleased…
The stranger was clearly aware of John's discomfort for he smiled knowingly and murmured, "You are a shy boy, John?" It was all John could do not to flinch away as the man then reached out with moist, plump fingers to stroke John's blond hair and smooth cheek. "You will learn to be less shy with me."
“Give me your jacket and trousers, Master John and your uniform too.  You rest while I see to them.  I’ve made inquiries of the innkeeper, a most affable fellow who tells me that a steamer is leaving this evening for Mytilene, Lesvos.  If his lordship is at all well enough, we’d best be on it.  You’ll both need your strength, so rest while I brush your clothes.  It won’t do for us to appear too down-at-heel.”
John, struggling for courage, finally raised his eyes and replied, but in no more than a whisper, "Yes, my Lord."
Although astounded at this speech, John did not question Lord Holmes change of mind. He simply nodded and awaited further instructions; the first of which was to don the ill-fitting sailor's uniform handed to him. He then assisted Hudson to pack the articles that they would need on their journey over the low mountain range that lay between and Sarköy and Gelibolu. John took responsibility for their medical supplies, packing carefully as he knew a fall or other accident could easily occur in the rugged terrain surrounding Sarköy, and there would be no assistance available along the isolated ways they would follow. He then assisted Hudson to pack blankets, candles, matches and rope. Hudson informed John that they would purchase enough food and water from the villagers to carry with them. The trip would take three days. John had little to pack of his own possessions although he carefully rolled up his new clothes and his old canvas coat in a small pack.
Greg leaned across the table and looked him straight in the eye, “No, you daft idiot. I mean Sherlock. Sherlock wanted my opinion about your feelings for him. He demanded I drop everything and rush over.  I thought another bloody serial-killer was on the loose.  You two are the limit!”
Meanwhile the other soldiers, unable to agree on what to do with their captives, had begun to pass around wine – bottles likely stolen from a local farmer or inn keeper. The main disagreement among them seemed to be about the likelihood of obtaining money somehow in exchange for their prisoners.  The wine flowing, it wasn’t long before the most forceful members of the company were shouting drunkenly at one another and paying no attention to the prisoners.
"This will hurt, I'm sorry Sherlock." he said as he applied camphor oil directly to Sherlock's ugly gash with a clean bandage. He tried not to notice when Sherlock's breathing stopped and his torso went rigid in agony. With Hudson's assistance he then applied a clean bandage to the wound and secured it as best he could with the strips of cloth torn from his new shirt.
John looked up at Sherlock urgently, "And you, sir, you need more medical care then I can give you here… stronger disinfectant and stitches …"
Her nephew concurred lazily, “Indeed, Your Grace.”
"Enough, sir!" Hudson's urgent order interrupted the nauseating sounds. The blows slowed but it was several seconds before they stopped.
As it turned out, Lord Holmes was correct, which was starting to be no surprise to John. It was indeed the villagers from Sarköy approaching, not the Barbary corsairs John so feared. Lord Holmes, obviously having anticipated something of the kind occurring, was a whirlwind of activity in the minutes before the fishing boats reached the gunnels of the stricken Wind Shadow. Having engaged the Captain in a rapid planning session upon his arrival at his cabin, Lord Holmes had then emptied the ship's safe and instructed Captain Barrow to distribute the considerable amount of gold and bank notes among the crew members. He explained that once rescued and ashore, he and Hudson intended to proceed overland to Gelibolu as soon as possible but that the crew should wait in Sarköy for the arrival of the weekly mail steamer that would ferry them to Gelibolu. From there, they would proceed by ship to Athens. From Athens, their passage home to England would be arranged by the Marquis of Bosham's agent in London. The Captain was to remain responsible for the well-being of the crew for as long as they chose to remain in the employ of the Marquis. The cash dispersal would assist them to purchase anything they may require before they reached home (the amount of money distributed to each astounded John, who could have lived comfortably for years on such a sum).
Alert again, Lord Holmes looked up, "Were what?"
Lord Holmes cursed the pessimistic temperament of the first mate as he laid a reassuring hand on John's shoulder. "No, John, you don't need to be afraid, it's not pirates. I can guarantee you that; the navy put an end to piracy in this part of the Mediterranean over five years ago. And John, even if it were pirates I would not allow anyone, most of all you, to be taken anywhere against your will."
With an affectionate smile he asked, “Tired John?” At John’s nod, he said, “We are almost at our destination.  Mycroft, Lord Bosham, made arrangements for us some day’s ago, to travel home by rail.  He anticipated our arrival here, it seems.”
“Lord Holmes, Oh Lord Holmes!” A woman’s voice trilled behind them.
Lord Holmes was distant and distracted too. But no doubt the urgency of his mission was weighing on his mind. Indeed, they proceeded from the port to the British Embassy without stopping.
“I shall certainly endeavour to see that no further harm comes to him,” said Hudson with dignity.
“Yes, Master John.”  Hudson disappeared toward the kitchen of the inn.
Nightfall found the three of them ensconced in a small but smartly furnished cabin aboard the steamer RMS Lady Rose and already well underway for Lesbos.  Hudson was enjoying a well earned nap and Sherlock, as comfortably as he was able, was reclining on the other of the cabin’s two beds reading a book on Egyptian archaeology purloined for him by Hudson from the tiny passenger lounge.  John was enjoying the relative calm, gazing out the porthole at the night sky and sea.
Instead, Lord Holmes stopped short and studied him thoughtfully for a moment before saying slowly, as if thinking out loud, "John…yes, you've studied Latin. For medicine. Yes, I believe you can help me…"
Refreshed from even the limited amount of sleep he’d gotten curled in a chair, John’s heart was light as they disembarked; his head full of thoughts of the man he loved, pride at being by Lord Holmes’ side and happy in the knowledge that he was needed and valued.  For now, it was enough. More than enough, he told himself.  It was perfect.
“Damn it, Hudson!”
"A woman? Lady Adler?" asked John timidly.
In the sitting room he found Hudson and Lord Holmes, the latter resplendent in his new clothing and Hudson the picture of dignity in his.
“We’ve come such a long way!” he started, only to be interrupted by Sherlock who said loftily, “Not at all.  It merely appears that way.  It’s an effect of the heat; it makes distances appear far greater than they are.”
For John, who couldn't remember ever being held close by anyone, apart from a dim memory of his mother, this unexpected experience, though blissful, was emotionally overwhelming. To his embarrassment, he felt tears welling up in his eyes, the result of days of physical pain and fear that had left him physically and emotionally weakened. Now feeling safe for the first time in as long as he could remember, the tears of relief wanted to flow. But he fought fiercely to hold them back. First panicking, he thought, and now crying like a child, what must this amazing man think of me?
John looked at his feet miserably, he hated to be a nuisance and a burden but he couldn't under any circumstances bring himself to consider separation from Lord Holmes. "I won't slow you down, I swear. I'm very tough and I can help you…"
Once the soldiers were taken care of, Sherlock swung around to assist John, who he was aware had not been able to free himself. To his alarm, however, John was nowhere to be seen.  His alarm increased when a quick count of the incapacitated soldiers confirmed that one was missing − the stocky man who had had his eye on John earlier. Desperate, Sherlock scanned the area surrounding the fire for evidence as to which direction John had been taken.  He found what he was looking for immediately; signs of a scuffle and drag marks in the sand leading away from the fire. He issued a vicious curse and leapt into the darkness to follow the trail.
Not surprising though, reflected John. He might be handsome but rumour had it that Lord Holmes was more interested in frippery than diplomacy and was sent to various outposts of the empire, not on errands of importance but rather for the purpose of keeping him out of trouble in London. His missions were meant to appease the head of the Holmes family, the Marquis of Bosham, who insisted his cousin should be kept occupied. Such was young Lord Holmes' reputation that when the news of his imminent arrival had reached the embassy, one of the more senior diplomats had snorted out a laugh and commented, "Holmes? That vacuous clotheshorse? We must be out of favour indeed." Lady Adler, however, had perked up at the news of Lord Holmes' visit with a calculating look in her dark eyes. Although what she might want with Lord Holmes, beyond the obvious, John couldn't imagine.
Their arrival forced John out of his melancholy state.  He determined to make the most of the time that he had with Lord Holmes on this journey and do his best to make him proud. It was the least he could do after all that Lord Holmes had done for him.
"Unhand him." Sherlock's voice was steely.
After his walk John returned below deck just in time to be met by Hudson with a tray in hand, and accompanied to Lord Holmes' cabin.  As they had been the night before, books and papers were still strewn about haphazardly.  Adding to the chaos, a large map was now mounted on the wall, stuck generously with clusters of pins connected with coloured thread.  The young Lord himself, if anything, appeared even more dishevelled than he had the previous evening. Had he been working all night John wondered? And if so, at what?
Their cabin was forward of the ship’s belching smoke stacks, so they were able to open their porthole to the cool night air and be unbothered by the choking smoke, steam and soot which plumed from the funnels astern. The porthole was open because despite its relative comfort, the cabin was very hot.  The steam engines below deck were running at full power, producing tremendous heat, noise and vibration.
The two combatants stood in the circle of light. Sherlock fixed his opponent with a hard stare and said, "If I win, the boy stays with us. I have your word on this? Your… esteemed colleagues will not interfere?" He used the term with barely restrained mockery.
Try as he might, however, his was unable to shake the longing that had come stealing over him. It stayed with him the next day as they rode the ferry to Greece.  Then if anything, sitting in a carriage next to Lord Holmes driving to Athens after their arrival in Piraeus, it increased its hold over him.  It was jarring, this glaringly bright city with its crowds of people, carriages, carts, shouts and dust.  John found himself longing for the days when he and Sherlock, and of course Hudson, had been in the hills south of Sarköy or in the intimate space of the Wind Shadow, that first amazing day spent with Sherlock before the storm.  The desire to never be apart from Sherlock was inexorably taking over his entire being.
"What work? We here well know that you were sent by the Prime Minister only for the purpose of convincing the Queen that he is taking her fears of Russian expansion seriously – which he is not. But regardless, your mission is accomplished so let us enjoy ourselves!"
Once the cabin was completely bare of books, maps and papers, in fact, anything that could have provided anyone who came looking with information as to his recent activities, Lord Homes turned to John. With a light hand on John's shoulder, he quietly but firmly informed him that although he himself and Hudson would be leaving as soon as they had obtained supplies from Sarköy to begin their overland journey, John was to stay with Captain Barrow. The Captain would ensure John's safety on the journey home and once in England, he would accompany John to the Marquis of Bosham's residence in London. There John was to wait for Lord Holmes' arrival, at which time Lord Holmes would assist him to locate his family and then accompany John to meet them.
They were very hospitably received by the Ambassador’s wife who evidently had been expecting them.  They were served lunch, after which Lord Holmes met with the Ambassador in his office and Hudson went shopping.  John, for his part, was ushered into a private sitting room, filled with sunlight and prettily decorated with vases of fresh flowers.  He was supplied with the most recent English newspapers and a jug of fresh lemonade and given instructions to ring the bell should he require anything else.
They picked their way back to the main road in heavy darkness. John could feel Sherlock, propped up between him and Hudson, stumbling and slipping on the muddy track. Despite the woollen undershirt and his jacket, Sherlock was shaking from the shock of his injuries as well as from cold.  Hudson and John still had their travel bundles, mercifully, but they had been forced to leave Sherlock’s behind, confiscated by the gang during the fight.
John, full of admiration at the brilliance of the man before him, found himself agreeing eagerly, "Yes, m’Lord!"
That night at The Olive Wood Hotel John had expected to sleep with ease, lying in the cloud-like comfort of his bed, lulled by the splash of playful waves at the beach and the whirring chirp of a Nightjar perched in a tree outside his window. The day had been perfect.  He’d been able to stay close beside Lord Holmes, who had indulged him by allowing him to check his head and chest wounds as frequently as John liked, to ensure himself that Lord Holmes was healing well.  He’d experienced a day of heaven on this beautiful Aegean island, safe and free by the side of the man he loved.  Yet, that night John found himself turning restlessly, unable to settle, his thoughts troubled.
He grinned at John. "She will have discovered the theft by now."
To his immense relief his plan had unfolded without incident. Thankfully, as he had depended upon, Lord Holmes had not returned to the yacht the previous night (no doubt making the most of his last night with Lady Adler thought John with uncharacteristic pique). When the crew members on the Wind Shadow transferred watch at 4:00 AM, John had been able, small and light as he was, to slip over the stern of the boat unnoticed in the darkness and creep down into the hold.
Her companion was a tall, darkly handsome young man, impeccably dressed in exquisitely tailored Rocola evening-wear, which, despite his youth, he wore with a careless ease. He replied, his voice sonorous in the quiet twilight of the garden, "I deeply regret that I must Irene, I wish I could stay." Lord Holmes raised her fingers to his lips, "But there is important work for me to do in England."
Hello readers,
John nodded abruptly without looking up.  He held Sherlock’s hand and listened to him mumble French from between lips that were frighteningly close to the colour of the pillow on which he was lying.
Hours later John awoke with a start to find Hudson entering the room with a tray in hand. It was obviously morning-time judging by the weak light filtering through the grimy window of their room.
John could hardly force himself to leave the room so great was his desire to stay with Sherlock but he knew he must obtain medical supplies; it was vital to Sherlock’s survival that his wound be treated correctly. He thought he detected a flicker of awareness in Sherlock’s face when he bent over him one final time before departing, but when Sherlock’s eyes didn’t open he decided he had been mistaken.
"Brigands!" Sherlock exclaimed, "and we like flies into their spider web! Damn it all to hell!"
But things were different now.  Very different. However, there was no going back or confessing and trying to make amends. The die had been cast.
Landing on the drive as ably as he could, given his injuries, and staying well inside the shadow of the wall John made his way home. He lived with his stepfather, Major Williams, who was in charge of the Guard for the British embassy. The major had reached this disappointing career-low after failing at a series of more important positions due to his excessive drinking. Always cruel, he was now a bitter, violent man who took his frustration out on his gentle stepson. His treatment of John had not gone unnoticed in the small British community in the city but few were willing to openly censure the Major's behaviour. He held what was still an important position at the embassy and, in a time when the threat of Russian invasion was very real, no one wanted to risk crossing Major Williams.
A faint flush appeared on the stranger's face and neck and his fingers shook slightly as they played with the lower buttons of his silk vest. He nodded and stared at John again, dwelling hawk-like on his small frame and peach-smooth chin and cheeks. By now trembling and mute with unnamed horror, John's relief was overwhelming when his stepfather ordered him out of the study to make tea for their guest. John did so, but when he returned with a tray of tea the stranger had gone.
"Hmmmm, yes, the woman," was the distracted response from Lord Holmes as he sat down and sank into thought.
The gang leader was speaking English which wasn't too surprising; the three of them likely weren't the first of their nationality these robbers had intercepted. Since the Crimean War the British had maintained a presence in Gelibolu; manning the gun defenses that guarded the entrance to the Black Sea, a strategically important site in recent European conflicts. At least a few unfortunates among them had likely been kidnapped by these cutthroats.
You could say as you pleased too, he learned quickly.
The ensuing scream rattled the very rafters of the roof but Sherlock ignored it. "The boy stays with me," he ground out, ignoring the involuntary gasps of shock around him at the brutality of his action. When the gang leader didn't answer soon enough for him, Sherlock's face twisted and he trod on the man's pierced shoulder again and ordered, quite murderous now, "Capitulate or you die!"
He wasn’t sure how long he remained lost in thought but his reverie was interrupted by Hudson’s return.  Hudson and an embassy footman were weighed down with boxes, which when unpacked, revealed the finest Athens had to offer in gentlemen’s attire.  Presented with his new suiting John was bidden to retreat to a dressing room and change for the next leg of the journey.
It was two days after the his stepfather's tirade over his schooling that John, heeding a sixth sense, halted in the darkness on the cellar stairs upon hearing a stranger's voice coming from his stepfather's study. Unbeknownst to his stepfather, he was in the cellar to collect a jar of the applesauce that Molly had given him which was to be his mid-day meal. His stepfather had returned home unexpectedly at luncheon; the reason, it was clear, was to meet with the unknown caller who was with him in his study. John strained to hear what was being said, but he was able to make out very few of the words spoken. He heard his name, followed by raised voices, seemingly arguing about money. With the hair prickling on the back of his neck, John tried to hear more of the conversation but he could make out nothing further. Perhaps his stepfather was drawing them into more debt with an ill-advised loan he thought despairingly.
John thought he heard Lord Holmes mutter dryly, “Of course!” which was puzzling but perhaps, John thought, he was mistaken.
It was then with a start that Sherlock realized his mistake: the man was stupid yes, but cunning. His expression dissolved into pure greed when he thought he was unobserved; his eyes locked on John and his face slackened with lust. Sherlock, alarmed, glanced quickly at John, hoping he hadn't noticed the man's attention. But John's cheeks were pale under his tan, his breathing was shallow and his left hand was trembling. He's terrified, realized Sherlock, furious with himself for not observing the situation sooner. He tried now to make eye contact with John, to reassure him, but John had withdrawn into himself, feeling helpless and vulnerable, which he is all too used to, thought Sherlock angrily.
Once the Captain had left to carry out his various instructions, Lord Holmes turned to John and Hudson to request their assistance in removing the maps and papers from the walls, the floor and the desk. Once done, he thrust all of them out through the cabin's porthole where they disappeared rapidly into the sea.
He then continued, "I initially assumed the first paper was simply a decoy to allow me to think I had gotten the real one but it seems that the critical information can only be understood if one has both documents; an ingenious system really. It took twice as long to figure out than these types of cases usually do; 24 hours instead of 12."
"She was on her way to the Grand Duke's apartments at the Russian Embassy with the papers; I merely lightened her burden, so to speak. Ball gowns are cut indecently low in this day and age, don't you agree?" Lord Holmes actually winked at John then before closing his eyes and once more resuming his thinking posture.
It was to the beach they went, after a delicious lunch of cold cucumber soup, chicken sandwiches and lemon soufflé, eaten in a sunny dining room surrounded by potted orange and lemon trees − the first prepared meal they’d had in days. After, Hudson had suggested mildly that, given the long journey still facing them that they should rest as much as they could while they had the chance.

"Well, well, a fine catch we have," crowed the gang's apparent leader. "Better than we expected of this day that's certain! Perhaps worth gold to your employer, we shall see, but at the very least you'll be entertainment for me and my friends!" He made this last statement while looking with unpleasant interest at John. Sherlock hissed under his breath. Both he and Hudson moved imperceptibly closer to John, who fought down the panic which, never far away, rose in his throat and made his heart pound.
John was efficient and skilled with his wound cleaning and stitching.  The only hitch in the operation came when Sherlock refused adamantly to drink any French tonic.  When John would have tried to insist, knowing the agony of sutures without pain alleviation, he felt Hudson’s cautioning hand on his shoulder.  Looking up he took in Hudson’s expression and desisted immediately his pressuring of Sherlock to drink it.
It must have showed on his face too because John hastened to add, “No, no, not like that!  Uh… the opposite in fact.  I’m happier with Sherlock than I’ve ever been in my life, Greg!”
John paused, “It’s just that I can’t tell if he likes me.  I mean, I know he likes me, loves me in fact. We sorted a lot of that stuff out when he got back from Serbia…”
Here he took a moment to look rueful before gleefully announcing again, "We are done John! Excellent," followed immediately by, "You must be hungry. Dinner?"
He spoke for the first time in many minutes, urging between gasps, “Hudson! Leave me here and take John… to the docks. There will be a… steamer there going to… Athens in the morning. Buy your passage out… to London.  Take John to… Ashling Court… wait for Mycroft…”
Lord Holmes gave a low laugh, "You don't flatter me Irene! Nevertheless, although it pains me deeply, I must leave. You know I will treasure, always, the memory of our time together in this beautiful city. Truly, Constantinople is the only city in the world that is a worthy backdrop for your own incomparable beauty."
Here at last is a new chapter.  Thank you for being so patient, faithful readers.
The room was completely dark; no light at all found its way in through the boarded up windows. Hudson, however, found a candle and matches, in either his own or John's rolled bundle, and used them to provide light dim though it was. Sherlock sat gingerly on what looked to be a broken crate, the closest to them of several objects in the room. John could see the pallor creeping into his complexion and the tremor with which he put an exploratory hand to his bloody chest.
“I have, Your Grace.” Sherlock nodded courteously to Westrey.
In contrast, the sea beyond the porthole through which John was gazing was calm and still. The reflection of millions of stars sparkled on the silken black water sliding past the gunnels.  John felt almost as if the universe was celebrating with him, the night’s soft beauty mirroring his quiet elation at having escaped at last, his tormentors and the horrors of Constantinople.
And just like that, everything was well in John's world again; somehow he was alight with happiness although he wasn't quite sure why.
“Hudson, we can arrange for John to be served dinner in his compartment this evening?” Sherlock looked down at John and said softly, “I’m afraid this dinner engagement is unavoidable. Hudson will ensure that you have all that you need.”  Then, unexpectedly he raised a hand and lightly touched John’s cheek. “Sleep well, John.”
John, not fully awake right away, had stared at Sherlock unwittingly, quite magnetized by his good looks. When he caught Lord Holmes eye − and his amused smile, he had been mortified.  To hide his consternation, he had turned away abruptly to fumble at donning the uniform handed to him by Hudson. He’d avoided looking at either Lord Holmes or Hudson until he had brushed his hair into tidiness and straightened his jacket firmly.  It was only after he’d accepted the bread and wine that Hudson offered him, that he had finally recovered his composure.
John managed to rally his fuzzy thoughts and mumble, "I had to leave home in Constantinople and I cannot go back. I was planning to go ashore in Athens and then to take a seaman's job perhaps on a merchant ship and work my way back to England. That's all."
Hudson, it seemed, was equally as pleased as his diners, although given the indulgently knowing looks, discreetly hidden, that he gave the two young men sitting at the table, he was pleased with something more than simply a successful afternoon of code-breaking. He served a dinner fit for royalty with an Asian inspired menu; egg drop soup, spiced celery salad, Peking duck and a lighter-than-air sponge cake with Lychee nut preserves. Afterward he offered both young men brandy and cigars with seeming disregard for John's tender age. Neither young man noticed this in-congruence, happily absorbed in conversation as they were.
"I beg your pardon, John," Lord Holmes said quietly, touching an apologetic hand briefly to the top of John’s head, "I'm merely expressing frustration over a case that is taking far longer than it should to solve."
Sherlock didn't accept the invitation immediately; instead he began with deliberate slowness to withdraw his arms from his jacket sleeves and to hand the coat to Hudson. He then did the same with his collarless woolen undershirt, folding it carefully before handing it to Hudson as well. Finally, bare-chested, with his lean arms loose at his sides; he stilled and stared at his opponent in a calculating manner, his look so intense that the man, despite himself, checked his own stance uncomfortably. John, watching them, thought he'd go mad with the tension of the moment.
“It just so happens,” Greg announced slowly, “that not a week ago another bloke was sitting in front of me in this very café asking me the very same question.”
It was obvious that the man was skilled in this form of combat; as the fight progressed, his lunges outnumbered Sherlock's by a considerable number. There was no doubt that Sherlock was on the defensive. The man's mates thought so too, exclaiming with excitement at each of his attempted stabs, anticipating that victory would soon be at hand.
Despite the discomfort of his back John was able to doze in the semi-darkness of the hold of the Wind Shadow. His torn flannel shirt was sticking painfully to the scabs now forming on the wounds left by his stepfather's whip, but he was now able to rest knowing that the anxiety and fear of the last several days was behind him.
It was all suddenly too much for John. He gave up any pretense of coping because really, what was the use now that he had been caught? Giving himself up to a fog of misery, he heard himself mutter,
Hudson didn’t appear to notice his confusion, “As you suggest then, do what you can, Master John, we’ll await your return.”
Lord Holmes continued as if John hadn't spoken. "And how did you know the Wind Shadow would be leaving for England yesterday?" It was a rhetorical question but before answering it, he leaned forward and plucked a small piece of cedar bark from John's trousers, stuck there by a drop of pitch. "Fresh pitch, still soft, from an ornamental cedar, an English variety, not native to Turkey but found surrounding the embassy gardens, most notably, as far as you are concerned, immediately above the rose arbour where yesterday Lady Adler and I, er….discussed my plans to sail for England today. Am I correct?"
Now though, John said nothing to Sherlock or Hudson of his growing distress, determined as he was not to be any more of an encumbrance or nuisance to them than he was already. Perhaps, he thought desperately, he could creep outside the entrance of the cave to rest once the other two men were asleep; surely it wouldn’t be any colder outside the cave than in it.
"Yes, Sir." Hudson's voice was gentle with understanding and his tone held a wealth of meaning beyond his words as Sherlock stared at him, anxiety and uncertainty written plainly on his face.
The two below John in the garden were now locked in a passionate embrace which caused John to look away in irritation. Of all places, why had they chosen the location that he considered to be his sanctuary for their illicit liaison? Not that he wanted to examine the cause of his annoyance, after all, what did he care who Lord Holmes chose to give his obviously exceptional kisses to? (Obviously exceptional based on the sighs emanating from Lady Adler). The information he had overheard regarding Lord Holmes' travel plans was invaluable to him.
They didn’t stop at the main station but rather were delivered to a quiet siding rail where several very smart coaches, painted in shining black and emblazoned with the royal coat of arms, were waiting.
She continued without pausing, “I am traveling with a companion too, Lord Westrey accompanied me to Malta where I intended to stay for some time but your cousin, dear Lord Bosham, suggested that I may wish to return to England sooner than planned.  If this talk of war is true then it is most inconvenient, I must say! Ah, here is my dear nephew now.”
Greg grinned at him but John almost missed it.  He was up and out of his chair so fast he nearly sent it toppling. He dashed out of Speedy’s to tug open the door of 221B and disappear up the stairs.
John had stopped attempting to date months ago.  There was no point.  Sherlock was endlessly creative in finding ways to send John’s hapless dates flouncing down the stairs and out of the flat in a huff, if John was foolish enough to invite them over.  If he wasn’t, Sherlock would simply show up at whatever venue John had chosen for his date and wreak his havoc there.
John readied his patient, who had awakened upon his return.  Sherlock was alert but weak and in obvious pain.  John encouraged him to eat some of the cheese and figs and drink a cup of the wine that Hudson had procured from the inn keeper.
"I will kill him!" came the almost unrecognizable hiss of Sherlock's voice, sounding frighteningly like the demon John had imagined.
"Stay here, I will check on him," said Hudson and with surprising agility for his age he left the cabin before John could move.
The gang members were ecstatic with excitement at this turn of events, cheering on their fellow to finish the fight. John, sick with horror, felt dizzy and struggled to stay upright beside Hudson. But Sherlock's composure didn't waver; he appeared not to notice the blood running down his torso from his wound, focusing as he was on his opponent's next move.
John blinked. "I have?" he asked weakly.
……………………
"No, Lord Holmes! Pirates…they capture people….to sell," mumbled John, his body beginning to shake.
Boarding the ship had been uneventful.  It had been decided that Hudson would go to the shipping office to purchase their passage.  (John had handed Hudson his remaining money, surreptitiously, when he had returned from the market that morning).  Despite John’s concern, Lord Holmes had not inquired as to where the funds for tickets would come from.  John certainly didn’t wish for either Lord Holmes or Hudson to know of his selling the broach.
John approached the man and opened his grimy hand to reveal the glittering piece of jewelry before closing his fingers over it again and lowering his hand to his side.  The man’s eyes narrowed and he nodded almost imperceptibly.  This was John’s moment of risk; if he handed the brooch over, the man might steal it and there would be nothing John could do.  But he’d come this far and so, with no intention of going back to the inn without what he needed, he thrust the diamond encrusted piece of jewelry into the trader’s rough hand.
John intended to stay awake but of course did not.  Of the three, only Lord Holmes remained awake; no longer reading, if indeed he ever had been, but gazing at John with such an expression of tender affection on his face that anyone of his acquaintance would have been quite astounded to see it.
John, feeling he was in some terrible waking nightmare, heard the start of the fight called and closed his eyes momentarily unable to watch. When he opened them he saw Sherlock's challenger on the offensive, clearly trying to unnerve Sherlock with his aggressiveness. After a couple of experimental sallies, he lunged at Sherlock and gave a vicious swipe with his knife; aiming at Sherlock's left side in a move calculated not to wound but rather to kill. Sherlock would have been eviscerated had the knife met its target. John bit down hard on his lip and tasted blood; unable to close his eyes now he felt himself sway weakly into Hudson. He heard Hudson mutter quietly in anger beside him.
"Enough talk. What do you intend to do with us?" Sherlock questioned coldly.
He started in on the newspapers but, alone with his thoughts again, he soon lost track of what he was reading and instead, gazed out the windows at the view of Athens below him. He could see the low mountains surrounding the city, taupe coloured in the distance.  The bright green treed hills within the city itself stood out against the white buildings and the cloudless blue sky above.  In the distance was the brilliant blue glimmer of the Gulf of Saronic where numerous ships were visible surrounding the busy port at which they had arrived only hours earlier.
The ruffian's leg crumpled but he didn't fall; he staggered and regained his balance. Then, like the proverbial bull before the red flag; bellowing in rage and pain he threw himself recklessly at Sherlock. With the man barreling into him with both knives raised, one ready to stab and the other to slash, Sherlock kicked again, this time high on his opponent's body with another movement so fast it was a blur to those watching. Before the gang leader could recover, Sherlock drove his knife into the man's left shoulder and pulled it out again, dodging out of the way as the man howled in pain and swung wildly at him with his uninjured arm.
In this manner the morning wore on, the boat floundering in the now sluggish waves of the dying storm. John and Hudson, in between caring for their patients, worked to put the cabins to rights and clear broken glass and crockery while Lord Holmes, back in his own cabin once more, dragged out and began to study a stack of maps and charts with single-minded intensity.
"I believe so, Sir."
The port of Mytilene with its small harbour was charming.  It was edged by a glistening white sand beach upon which the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean lapped invitingly.  This was the pretty beach of Tsamakia, known for its variety of sea shells and delightfully warm water.
Major Williams had spent all of John's education funds on himself leaving none of it for John's benefit. That he was now financially broke was entirely due to his own drinking and gambling habits. He was so much in debt, in fact, that he had had to sell most of their possessions and John knew of little left that was of any value.
When Lord Holmes finally spoke again it was to say, "I need more information, John. What was the reason for your stowing away on this vessel and what did your plan specifically entail?"
Before John could open his mouth in protest, Hudson responded with a cool and unhurried, “Certainly not Sir, John is safe enough here for now and you need his physician’s skills if you are to recover from this injury.”
Greg sat silently.  John, the anxiety he’d been feeling for days beginning to drain away now that he had done it − finally gotten up his nerve to express his feelings about Sherlock aloud,  allowed the rattle of coffee cups, the chatter of patrons and the odor of wet umbrellas wash over his senses in a soothing wave.  Speedy’s was busy for a Monday morning.
Sherlock’s wellbeing was the only thing that mattered to John.  Of course it was a loss to give up his mother’s precious brooch but he took comfort in the knowledge that both his mother and his father would have approved of what he was doing and why, and without question, they would have done the same thing in his place.  John loved Sherlock with all his heart and, even if he didn’t already owe Sherlock a great debt, he would give up anything including his own life if it meant saving Sherlock’s.
“You must join us for dinner tonight! In the dining car at eight o’clock? Perhaps a game of rummy after?”
“Please Sherlock, consider allowing me to use it topically, at least. Its effects will be localized on your skin so its side effects will be far less than if you imbibed it.”
At least John’s fear of re-capture had been allayed. Hudson had reassured him that it was unlikely the gang would search for them once it was discovered that they had escaped. The gang members would be too fearful of arrest to follow them, ruffians such as they rarely sought out people to rob; they usually victimized those with whom they happened to cross paths. Also, they would be pre-occupied with their leader’s dire condition.
"It's alright! Whatever it is that's upset you, it's alright, John…"
After a moment of profound silence, Lord Holmes said in a mild tone that belied the stare, "Ah, a stowaway, Hudson. Interesting." Then sharply, directed at John, "Who are you?"
That night, determined to learn what his stepfather was planning, John stayed home. He intended to search the study for anything that would indicate what business his stepfather had had with the repulsive man who had visited that afternoon. In doing so he had been unable to escape the Major's anger and had suffered yet another beating. Mercifully, the Major had succumbed to liquor earlier in the evening than usual and knowing it was urgent, John had forced his pain-seared body down the stairs to his stepfather's study. He searched thoroughly but found nothing among the papers in the desk or the Major's files. He then searched a cabinet and a side-table also to no avail. Finally, in the wastebasket under the desk he found the answer he'd been seeking: it was a draft bill-of-sale bearing the seal of a well-known market trader in Constantinople. And as John had read the document, it became sickeningly clear what his stepfather was intending; for there, crumpled but visible in bold ink was John's name alongside which had been written the sum of £1,000 and below this the unmistakable signature of his stepfather, Major Williams. The shock and fear John had felt as he realized the danger he was in had paralyzed his breathing to the point that he'd had to struggle not to faint.
Throughout the night as the storm continued, the Wind Shadow drifted at the mercy of the wind and waves. Without a mast and sails, there was nothing else they could do. John did not dwell on their dire situation; he was kept busy ensuring all his injured patients were comfortable including Lord Holmes. Apparently tired, Lord Holmes slept, lying down in the bunk where John had bandaged his head. With Hudson busy trying to allay the damage to the cabins and assess emergency supplies, John removed Lord Holmes' boots and slicker while he slept and covered him with a blanket. He was about to settle himself for a short rest seated on the floor beside Lord Holmes when a gentle hand reached out and guided him down on the bunk beside Lord Holmes, where he then felt the blanket pulled over him. In words so low he almost didn't hear them, Lord Holmes murmured, "Please rest here John, where I know where you are."
"John Watson," in response to Lord Holmes' question and, with almost a sense of relief, felt himself begin to slide to the floor in a wave of darkness.
When Hudson returned with another tray a couple of hours later, he saw the two heads, one dark and one fair, so close together they were almost touching, bent over the large desk, studying the books before them in complete concentration. He allowed himself a small smile before returning his face to its usual composure and announcing coffee.
Sherlock continued, “When you are feeling up to it, we’ll continue across the valley. But before that, Hudson, shall we have some food?”
"I simply raise the point, Sir. And there are two of us to protect him…"
John, feeling sadly unwanted but determined, said nothing.
He slapped a filthy paw against John's throat and began to squeeze while he used the other to forcefully tear the front of John's trousers. John felt cold air and then the rough wool of the man's uniform against his belly and with fresh horror, he felt the man scrabbling wildly at the buttons on his own trousers in an attempt to free himself now that John was exposed. But still John fought and, even as he weakened from the hand squeezing his throat and black dots crowded across his vision, he managed to thwart the man's clumsy attempts to turn him face down in the dirt and mount him.
There was an unpleasant round of laughter from the men surrounding them at his furious curse. Lamps were lit and sure enough the men turned out to be a frightening lot; rough looking and armed with knives and cudgels. The uncouth laughter increased when the brigands got a good look at their captives; in their eyes merely an old man, a thin Englishman and a boy, the three almost as dirty and ragged as themselves.
He tried to reassure her, "Don't worry. You know how careful I am Molly. I will be fine. I'll send word as soon as I get to England, I promise."
John secured a carbolic acid soaked gauze and bandage to Lord Holmes' head, relieved to find that the wound was not deep. He knew the importance of keeping wounds clean, however, and made sure that Lord Holmes gash was thoroughly disinfected before he bandaged it.
Sherlock observed this turn of events with satisfaction.  He couldn’t have planned a better diversion to keep the men’s attention away from himself, Hudson and John. They had simply to wait now until the right moment to launch their escape presented itself.
Sometime later he was awoken again but this time not by the soothing motion of waves but rather to the frighteningly loud thud of the hatch door being opened and dropped and footsteps thumping down the ladder into the hold. Clearly someone was entering his hiding place. As John listened, to his alarm, whoever it was didn't restrict their search, as would be expected, to the main storage area. He could see lantern-light approaching him as they worked their way up to the rarely used space under the bow where John had hidden himself. His heart pounding, he shrank back behind the coils of rope he had chosen to hide behind and held his breath while whoever had entered his hideout searched among the boxes and supplies stacked around him.
“Much improved Master John, resting peacefully with no more tremors.”
"Sit!" said John, more sharply than he had intended.
Lord Holmes raised one eyebrow, locked his gaze on John once more, and began to speak. "You've run away from home due to threats against your life and grievous violence perpetrated against your person. You are an only child and motherless; nearly friendless too by the look of it. No more than thirteen perhaps fourteen years of age, judging by your appearance although you project a maturity beyond your years, probably due to your being forced to look after yourself at a very young age. Your father holds an important position at the British embassy. He is almost certainly militarily trained…assigned to the Guard perhaps? You have an interest and an unusual talent for medicine, specifically surgery…You haven't given me your real name, obviously you fear being returned forcibly to your home. You are trying to reach England, most likely in search of your mother's family who you hope will welcome you. And you have no money likely due to the fact that your father is a drunkard and a gambler."
John just let Sherlock burrow and pressed a quick kiss into Sherlock’s hair.  He felt Sherlock shift under the covers and then he was kissing John’s chest.
Merry Christmas!!
“I’ll move,” said John.  “Surely there’s work for a doctor in Aldovia.”
Sherlock looked pensively out the window.  He seemed on the verge of saying something but finally, he just shrugged.  “This way, John.”
Two hours later, the plane landed in Aldovia.  At security, John thanked Christ again that the UK was still in the EU, at least for the moment.  The Aldovian airport was shut down and dark as his was the last plane to land.  He raced passed the rest of the travellers to the taxi stand.  He was in the taxi, pulling away from the airport by 23:15.
‘Sources close to the Royal Family have reported a noted absence of Prince Sherlock, younger brother of the King, at several events over the past few days,’ John read.  ‘The Christmas season is typically a busy time for the Royal Family with charity appearances, balls, dinners and gatherings.  But Prince Sherlock has been conspicuously absent since appearing at a press conference following the Christmas Ball.  According to our source, who has requested to remain anonymous, this period of reclusion began when the Prince proposed to and then cut ties with one John Watson, a British doctor and ex-soldier.  “The Prince has always had trouble with personal relationships, so it makes sense that he’d take this hard,” said our anonymous source.’
“John!” she said in a cheerful voice that had a false ring to it.  “So lovely to see you!”  She threw her arms around him and pulled him in to a hug.  Then she turned to face the rest of the room, her arm around his shoulders.  “No need to make him feel self-conscious, everyone.  As you were.”
“Just the tea’s a bit sweet,” said John.
After a few hours, the snow began to pick up again and, though it was still lights, it was beginning to get difficult to see.
The speech ended with the royal family and the assembled crowd singing “Joy to the World”.  In the distance, just a few seconds before what was being broadcast on the tele, John could hear the actual voices singing outside the palace.
Sherlock brushed past John and out the door, but he paused before he pulled it shut.  “Goodnight, John.”
“Is there anyone else coming to breakfast?” John asked after a moment.
Sherlock snorted and sneaked a glance at John, grinning.
“Piss off, Mycroft,” said Sherlock, not looking away from John.
“Whiskey?” asked Sherlock.  He went to the drinks cart without waiting for a response and poured a glass.  Then he took a seat on the sofa, indicating that John should sit as well, and handed him the drink.
“But poison, Sherlock? Are you sure?”
“So, what exactly is your plan?”
“John, I-“
That comment pricked at John.
“Oh, none of that here when it’s just us,” she said, reaching out a hand for John to shake.  “You may call me Violet.”
“Hmm,” hummed Sherlock, as he flipped a page.
The footman walked off quickly, and John had to follow him or be left standing stupidly in the entrance hall.  John walked up the stairs and through the winding corridors that he thought he’d never see again.  The footman stopped in front of a door and behind it, there seemed to be a party of at least fifty people.  John could hear talking, laughter and the sound of clinking glasses.  He felt frozen to the spot, his heart hammering in his chest.  He looked at the footman.
“Sherlock!” said Violet while John glared at him.
“Whose this, then?” asked the man, pointing his chin at John as he appeared in the hall.
John wrapped his arms tight around Sherlock and slid forward as far as he could.  The more inappropriate connotations of this position were in the forefront of his mind, but it seemed that Sherlock was the only secure point in the moving, swirling darkness.
“What are you laughing at?” asked Sherlock, moving quickly from confused to angry.
John stopped a few feet in front of Sherlock but even that wasn’t close enough.  He looked up at Sherlock’s face.  He may have been imagining it but there seemed to be dark circles under Sherlock’s eyes that hadn’t been there before.  They probably matched the circles under John’s own eyes.
Eventually, he got out of bed, found his clothes, and made his way back to his room.  He spent the morning fiddling with his phone, scanning through the books on the shelves and staring out the window.  Around noon, Mrs Hudson came in with another sandwich.  “The king and the prince are going to make a public statement soon,” she said.  “You may want to watch it, dear.”
John reached the end of the corridor and stopped to consider which way to go next.  Then he heard a violin playing in the distance.  It sounded like it was coming from the right, so John went right to follow it.  Two more corridors and a few turns later and John found himself in a large sitting room with parquet wood flooring.  He crossed the room, following the sound of the violin.  He peaked his head passed a sliding wood door into what must have been the music room.
“And I could die in a car accident tomorrow.”
John felt his stomach lurch.  Sherlock was sending him back to the hotel.
Then John noticed that Violet was also wearing the mittens he’d given her.  She wore a black, no nonsense coat and a red scarf but the mittens added just a touch of whimsy to her ensemble.
Mycroft gave John a small, conspiratorial nod before he was swept into the conversations of those around him.
Sherlock snarled and yanked his arm out of John’s grip.  John took a quick step to the side and put himself between Sherlock and the exit.  Then he crossed his arms and glared up at Sherlock.  “You’re being ridiculous.”
After a few minutes, John was awake and his dream had dissolved, leaving a warm feeling in his chest.  He got out of bed and pulled back the heavy curtain.  Outside, deep snow covered what appeared to be an ornamental garden and more was continuing to come down.  Unless the snow stopped soon, John wasn’t sure it he would make it back to the hotel that day.
The cab pulled up in front of the palace and John nearly stayed in and told the driver to take him back to the airport.  But he got out and watched the cab pull away instead.  Then he was standing alone in front of the palace with no choice but to move forward.
John followed Sherlock upstairs.  By the time John made it up the stairs, Sherlock was already in conversation with a silver haired man.
“Oh no, let me,” said John apologetically.
After this chapter, I won't be posting for a few days since I have yet to write the last few chapters.  At this point, I'm thinking there will be about 8 chapters total.  But I thought I got it to a nice little resolution where this story can rest for a few days until I get the next part done.
“Icicle lights are traditional?”
The press conference came to an end in a cacophony of reporters and the screen switched to a news studio where two reporters were analysing the events related by Mycroft and speculating about John.  His picture flashed up on the screen and John felt queasy.
“And there are the royal groupies.”
Shit.  John had just walked in on the Prince doing something odd to a large chunk of a dead animal.  Because of course he had.
The snow became tiny, blazing white sparks as it was illuminated by the snowmobile’s headlights.  Sherlock swerved around the trees, coming close to them but not close enough that John was too worried.  It was clear that Sherlock had driven that path many times.
“Excellent.  If you need anything, just let him know.  He’s the prince.”
“Yes, Simon. I was able to be of some small assistance to the police,” said Sherlock.  He tried to move past the group but Simon stepped in to his path, forcing him to stop or squeeze past the garlands surround the door to leave.
“I don’t have one.  We met-“John paused.  He knew it had only been yesterday but it seemed so much longer. “Yesterday.”
“Not at all,” said the man, turning.  And, yep.  That was the Prince of Aldovia.  John recognized him from his large painting in the portrait gallery.  There was no mistaking him for anyone else.  Nobody else could possibly have that remarkable combination of height cheekbones and wildly unruly hair.  Though the portrait artist had toned down the hair and given the painting a blandly pleasant expression which was miles away from the analytical scowl the prince was currently levelling at him.
“I thought Mycroft was the crown.”
Matilda looked about ready to open her mouth when Mycroft spoke over her.  “Very nice.  Matilda will appreciate these.”  Matilda shut her mouth and nodded, smiling.
As John and Sherlock went back through to the sitting room, the passed Matilda carrying a stack of binders so high that John wondered how she could see where she was going.  All the binders said things like, ‘Christmas Party’ and ‘Party Plans’ along the spine.
John opened the door and the entire room fell silent.
"Precisely,” said Sherlock.  “Thus, we have a serial killer.”
John found that he was panting, and his voice was a bit higher and a bit louder than he’d intended it to be.  It seemed to get Sherlock’s attention though because he finally focused his eyes on John’s face.
John followed Sherlock into the room and stood awkwardly near the door.  Sherlock was on the other side of the room.  He picked up a stack of paper and was looking through them, putting them back down on the desk apparently at random.
They stood there, staring at each other for several long seconds.  John was awash with mixed signals.  Every part of him was telling him to take a small step forward, grab a handful of Sherlock’s ridiculously posh white shirt and snog him senseless.  Every part of him except a very small but loud part of his cerebral cortex which was shouting, “Bad idea! Bad idea!”
“Your phone.”
In the hall outside his room, he came across Mrs Hudson.  “Oh, there you are, dear,” she said, breathlessly.  “Sherlock sent something up for you. I laid it out in your room.”  Then she was off in a rush again.
They walked in companionable silence through the halls that were once again dimmed and lit only by Christmas lights.
“Why are you texting her?” asked John.  “Do we even know where the phone is?”
“You know I’m breaking enough rules as it is letting you in there,” said the man.
“Fine,” said John.  “Have a nice life then.” He yanked the door open and slammed it behind him.  It wasn’t until he was back in his room and some of the anger had seeped out of him that he wondered what had caused Sherlock to say those things and act that way.  ‘What ifs’ and ‘Maybes’ swirled around his head but in the end, he kept coming back to Sherlock wouldn’t do anything he didn’t want to do.  Maybe he was torn on kicking John out but on some level, he must have thought their relationship or friendship had gone as far as it could.
“Someone could try to kill me again and you could get caught in the line of fire.”
“Well, technically your brother and the prime minister and the members of parlement,” said the man, without much conviction.  Clearly, they’d had this debate before.  “Go on in then.”
Sherlock pulled away far too soon, looking a little dazed.  “I need to- the Christmas address.”
The street in front of the house was crawling with police officers and there was police tape across the pavement and the front door of the house.
“Just because he’s royalty, he thinks police procedure doesn't apply to him,” John heard Donavan mutter under her breath.  John looked over his shoulder at her, not meaning to glare.  Clearly, he did though because Donavan seemed to back off and go back to watching the street.
“George!” he said, cheerfully.  “Would you hold these for us?”  John was surprised to see a smile on Sherlock’s face.
“You do know it is my brother who makes the rules,” said Sherlock.
John mostly spent the next few days moping around his flat.  He forced himself to spend a few hours each day searching for jobs and filling out applications and he left the flat to go to the shops or get carry out Indian food from across the street but mostly he stayed in his flat and watched crap tele on the tiny screen, sitting on an uncomfortably springy chair in his dull flat.
Mike Stamford invited John out for a drink at his local with his wife and a few friends for New Year’s Eve.  John accepted because he couldn’t stomach the idea of sitting alone in his flat and listening to London celebrate the new year around him.
“What is your connection to my brother?” he asked.  He was still smiling, but the smile didn’t meet his eyes.
John yanked back, bring Sherlock to a halt.  He put his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face, holding him place so John could look at him.  “Sherlock, we don’t have to do anything you’re not comfortable with.  We can sit and talk, or we can do more of what we’ve been doing.  It’s all fine. Whatever you want.”
Sherlock continued to stare at him after John finished speaking.  The light from the firelight shone off his eyes, changing them from pale ocean mist blue to the dark grey of a summer storm cloud.
“Oh,” said John, not really sure how to respond to that.
John should have felt uncomfortable with the situation, and there were one or two questions that John certainly wasn’t comfortable with, like the question about his thoughts on Harry’s drinking.  When he pointed out to Sherlock that his sister’s self-destructive habits were not his preferred topic of conversation, Sherlock shrugged and moved on, seemingly unbothered by the rebuke.
“Not today, Donavan,” said Sherlock, lifting the tape for John and then leading him in to the house.
If you have read all the way to the end, I sincerely thank you.  I feel like I have to appologize for any typos, weird formatting and that tasteless Brexit joke but this was just something fun for me to entertain myself with during this most unusual of holiday seasons.  I hope you enjoyed it too.  And if you noticed any glaring errors that bother you enough to point them out, please do.  I won't be offended but I will fix them.
“For that, I apologize,” said Sherlock.  He reached out and gently took John’s left hand and slid the ring from it.  “I should have been paying more attention to my surroundings, but I was,” he paused for a moment. “I was distracted.  I didn’t get a look at Mr. Tregennis’s face and there were several servers of the same height and hair colour there tonight.  I needed to orchestrate an event that would hold everyone’s attention except the murderer.  He would see that commotion as a chance to escape, which he did, while everyone else would stop everything to watch.  Especially given that it has long been supposed that I would be unlikely to ever get engaged.”
Sherlock looked down at John, giving him his full attention for the first time since they come into the room.  Sherlock was studying him so deeply in fact, that John was afraid to breath, afraid with this level of scrutiny that even a breath would give away how John was starting to feel about him.
A young waitress scurried over to them as they stood by the door.  The waitress curtsied gamely.  “Your Highness,” she said.  “We didn’t know you’d be in tonight.  But, um, thank you for coming in.  I’m sure Angelo will be pleased to know you’re here.  Can I-“
They passed several other guests with their attendant footmen.  Several of them stared as he passed.  John did his best to smile and nod unconcernedly at each one though each time it happened he became more and more concerned that he was getting into a situation that he really didn’t belong in.
“I know you would never let a glass leave the kitchen looking anything less than spotless so when I saw debris on the glass, I knew something was amiss. Lestrade,” said Sherlock, turning to him.  “Have samples been taken from both glasses?”
“And the ring?”
“Do you think the roads are passible?” he asked.  “I could call for a cab back to the hotel.”
Finally, Sherlock blinked.  “There’s no possible advantage for you to associate with me.  So, I know your motivations are selfless.”
“Wait a minute,” said John, watching as Sherlock typed the number from the bottom of the card into John’s phone.  “Is that the pink lady’s card?”
“Was it poison?”
“Sister!” said Sherlock, the grin returning to his face.  “There’s always something.”
He woke sometime later to darkness.  There was movement in the room and John tensed until he realized it was just Sherlock.  Several seconds later, John felt the cover lift and Sherlock get in to bed with him.  At first, Sherlock lay still on his side of the bed.  John waited a few moments but when it seemed Sherlock wasn’t going to be moving any closer, John reached out a hand.  He felt Sherlock’s elegant wrist and stroked a finger up and down and long the fragile bones in the back of Sherlock’s hands.
Inside the palace was warm and quiet.  The corridors were lit only by Christmas lights and the occasional wall sconce.  The windows at the front of the castle glowed with warm yellow light of the strings and strings of lights adorning the castles that were reflected in the snow.  As they moved towards the back of the castle, the windows shifted to a muted purple.  John couldn’t help but stop and stare out a large picture window at the end of a corridor.  Though the storm and the clouds and the complete lack of lights stretching out into the distance should have made it pitch black, the scene was suffused with an omnipresent light.  John could clearly see a large pine forest spreading out behind the palace and a mountain range in the distance.
The cab started to pull away as they exited the pub.  “I’ve got the number,” said John.
The corridor was empty, so John took his moment.  He dug in his heels and pulled Sherlock to a halt.  “Please explain, and it had better be fucking good, what the hell just happened?” he said in an icy, low tone through gritted teeth.
“Why?” John asked without thinking.  There was probably protocol for royal interactions like this that John was certainly in the process of cocking up but having the prince this close was very distracting.  It wasn’t even entirely the way he looked, which appeared to be entirely designed to be eye catching.  It was more that having this man’s entire attention and intellect focused on him was exhilarating.  Like seeing some force of natural destruction, a bolt of lightning or the wave of a tsunami, that is so arresting that you can’t look away.
They were in a large, grand sitting room and every single surface was covered in clutter.  A skull sat on the mantle and an ornate slipper filled with cigarettes was sitting in the middle of the coffee table.  On the wall was hung a large deer skull with a full rack of antlers and an old pair of headphones positioned over its head.
John woke once in the middle of the night. He’d rolled over in his sleep and ended up with his nose buried in a puff of curly hair.  The surprise of it jolted him fully awake and the previous evening came flooding back to him.  Sherlock was already moving in concert with John, pressing his forehead to John’s chest and putting a hand on his hip.  On of Sherlock’s feet tangled with John’s.  John relaxed in to Sherlock’s grasp.
“Sherlock, shouldn’t we be heading back?” asked John.
“I’m staying,” said John, forcefully.  The last thing he wanted to do at that moment was let Sherlock out of his sight and into the path of more avenging siblings.  John settled himself in an armchair by the window.  He watched Sherlock pulling on protective gloves and goggles and begin measuring out liquid from the glasses.  Every so often, Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at John as though wondering why he was still sitting here.  Watching Sherlock work was unexpectedly soothing, and he began to feel his anger at Sherlock draining away.  Yes, there was probably another way Sherlock could have handled the situation and yet, John couldn’t think of one.  And he couldn’t deny that Sherlock’s way had worked.
“Merry Christmas,” said John.
“Come inside,” said John.
“Sir, is fine,” clarified Sherlock.
“What do you think?” asked Sherlock, his voice closer to John’s ear than he had expected.
Sherlock opened his mouth and then closed it.  Then he opened it again and said, “It’s been a pleasure getting to know you but it is clearly in everyone’s best interests if we go our sperate ways tomorrow.”  His voice was oddly formal, and it was breaking John’s heart.
“John,” he said, blinking at him.
“There’s a snowmobile?” asked John.
As they walked, John asked Sherlock about the piece of music they’d been listening to and was still in the middle of telling John about the composer’s life as a Catholic priest in Renaissance Spain.  He was expounding on the architecture of the cathedrals of the period and the acoustics they used to project music and create a spiritual atmosphere by the time they arrive at John’s door.
He followed the now familiar corridors to Sherlock’s room, walking fast, resisting the urge to run.
Sherlock finally found his left shoe and put it on.  Then he turned to properly look at John.  “I’m sorry for rushing off like this,” he said.  “Christmas day is terribly busy for us.  We have a quick family gift exchange but then we have to get ready for the Christmas address in the afternoon and the ball tonight.  I should have mentioned when I invited you for Christmas at the palace, I would be busy much of the time.”
John gave him a curious look.
John opened the box and pulled out another ornament.  It was a gingerbread house but as John looked more closely, he realized it was familiar.  Then he noticed the police tape across the door and a figure in the upstairs window.  It was gingerbread depiction of the crime scene that Sherlock had taken John to on the first night they met.
John reached for his phone and opened his texts without thinking.  Then he realized that he’d never actually texted with Sherlock, so he went to his contacts to find the entry Sherlock had made there.
Sherlock kissed with the same intensity of focus he brought to everything else he did.  After a very long time, Sherlock stared kissing down John’s neck.  He hit a spot just below John’s ear and John gasped.  He could feel Sherlock grinning into his neck.  His fingers kept straying to the buttons of Sherlock shirt and eventually he stopped holding himself back.  He opened the first button.  He felt Sherlock go still in his arms, but he didn’t step back.
“He didn’t though!” yelled Martin.
“Yes,” said the man in a nasal American accent.
“Oh, god yes.”
“It could be another Sebastian situation,” said the second man.  “Friendship with royalty does have its perks.”
Sherlock’s eyes flashed to John’s. He slid his hand up to cup John’s jaw and angled his head to stare directly into his eyes.  John felt like Sherlock was seeing into his brain and reading his thoughts in the electrical impulses there.  “Have you really thought about this?” he asked.  “Have you really considered what this would mean for you?”
“Nonsense,” said Sherlock.  “It was a gift.”
All I want to do is go on a walk through a pine forest in the snow but I can't so I'm letting the boys do it instead!
“Excuse me,” said glasses.  “I just think I see…” He trailed off, turned and walked away into the crowd.
“She’s clearly from out of town, there’s a receipt from today from an airport in France.  She hadn’t checked in to her hotel yet.  She matches her nails to her shoes.  She wouldn’t leave the hotel with her hair looking like that.  I would say she’s in town for one or two nights, judging from the size of the suitcase.”
John looked at the glass and noticed a line of white powdery film running from the lip down into the bubbling, golden champagne.
John’s cab pulled up next and a third footman came down the steps to get John’s bag from the boot.
‘Of course,’ was John’s first thought and he was shocked, knowing that this had to be fake, that Sherlock was up to something, that they’d only known each other for four days for God’s sake, by his reaction.  Everyone was looking at him.  Sherlock was looking at him with the most hopeful, tearful expression on his face.   John’s knees were shaking and there was a lump forming in his throat but his hand was steady.
"Dearest Sherlock, do not play with me! Gerald isn't to return for at least another week. Why must you leave tomorrow?" The woman, elaborately attired in a shockingly low-cut and lavishly trimmed blood-red ball gown raised her face appealingly to the gentleman standing close to her under a rose arbour in the garden of the British Embassy.
Here it comes John thought, the sympathetic chiding, the kindly advice to ‘give his head a shake’ and look elsewhere for that sort of relationship…
John paled. "How far back, Hudson?"
“You were amazing tonight Sir, simply amazing!” John’s voice betrayed awe as he looked down at Sherlock.
Watching the expressions cross John's sensitive face, Lord Holmes prompted softly, "John?"
Lord Holmes was aware that men, women and children who were unfortunate enough to be captured by Barbary pirates were sold to slave traders. Corsairs, as the pirates were called, had been known to kidnap adults and children from not only the Caucuses but the coastal villages of Greece, Italy, France and even, on occasion, as far north as Ireland. Lord Holmes also knew that a portion of the trade was for sexual slavery. The boys captured often became köçekler, youth who performed provocative dance in Turkish taverns. British travelers had written descriptions of the boys, who, after their stage performances, were made sexually available to the highest bidder. The practise had been outlawed in Turkey in 1837, but it continued to thrive in secret, all the more lucrative for the boys' owners because of it. Other boys worked as tellaks or masseurs in hammam, the Turkish baths or as sāqī, servers in coffee houses where they were sexually available to paying customers. Fair haired, light-skinned youth were seen as the most desirable.
And soon it did get worse. Very much worse. The rolling and pitching became violent enough that Hudson suggested to John that he might be more comfortable in his cabin. But John refused, shaking his head, wanting to stay with his host who was steadfastly attempting to ignore the disturbance.
The small fleet of fishing boats approaching the lolling, stricken Wind Shadow was comprised of a rather haphazard band of wreckers; men and boys far too cheerful to be threatening and just as pleased at the prospect of a visit and news of the outside world as they were to salvage wrecked ships. They happily agreed to tow the sail boat to shore, making quick work of it. Within minutes the Wind Shadow was securely tied to the village's longest wharf. The village elderly along with women and children had crowded onto the wharf to greet them. They were welcomed more like family come from afar than the English strangers they were. The injured men were tut-tutted over and assisted ashore by concerned hands and there appeared to be stiff competition as to who among the villagers should get to play host to the interesting visitors.
Sherlock had said the family was gathering for drinks before dinner in the sitting room next to the music room.  After John had finished making himself as presentable as possible, he made his way there.  He paused outside the door, suddenly nervous.  Though he’d already met the king which should have been the thing to worry about.  But instead, he found himself wanting to make a good impression on Sherlock’s mum.
“Well, thank you,” said John.  They lapsed into silence, their eyes still locked.  John was beginning to feel that magnetic pull that he felt somewhere in his ribcage every time Sherlock looked at him with his undivided attention.
Sherlock grinned at John and then looked out the window.  “Mycroft did once ask Mrs Hudson to restrain herself.  But Mrs Hudson is a force of nature and nothing short of a signed and sealed royal decree can keep her from doing a thing once she’s set her mind to it.  And sometimes not even then.”
Another place setting was set in the seat nearest Sherlock complete with a cup of steaming tea.  An extravagant amount of food was set out on the buffet table but then, John realized, he did know who else might be joining them.  In fact, the king could come walking in at any minute to grab a coffee and a scone.
“Well, nothing usually because they’re not allowed to say the thing they’d like to say.”
“Sherlock,” said John, his heart breaking a bit and sending wavers through his voice. Sherlock was receding into himself, his lips set in a line and his eyes downcast.  But the hand that was clutching John’s was still held tight as though he couldn’t bring himself to let go.  John brought his free hand up to his chest, pressing over his heart.   “Sherlock, love.  You really are.”
“So, what am I doing here, exactly?” asked John.
“Sherlock.”
Sherlock took off down the corridor.  John stood still for just a moment, debating whether he should follow or just go back to his room, pack his bag, and leave.  But it really wasn’t much of a decision. He jogged down the corridor, catching up with Sherlock, just as he pulled open a door.
“It’s lovely,” said Sherlock, softly.
The winding approach to the castle at night was even more stunning than during the day. Every surface was covered in lights so that the white stone walls seemed to be glowing.  It should have been tacky but it was charming in its way.  John wondered if he would meet any of the rest of the royal family.  He couldn’t imagine what sort of family could have produced a man like Sherlock.  Were they all  brilliant and eccentric or were they all mundane and normal as though Sherlock had taken everything interesting and kept it to himself?
John finished scanning the article, which listed the various events that Sherlock should have appeared at, and then slammed his phone down.  He was seething at this “anonymous source”, though John had a bit of an idea who it might be.  The face of that smarmy bloke, Simon, flashed before his eyes, causing him to see red.  But then, John picked the phone back up and looked at the picture at the top of the article again, at Sherlock’s downcast face during the press conference.
Sherlock explains everything.
“I play the violin when I’m thinking.  Sometimes I don’t talk for hours on end.  Wouldn’t that bother you?”
“Nothing you don’t want to do,” said John.  “But if you’d like, I think we should move this to the bed.”
“Sherlock,” said John in a tone of voice that immediately drew all of Sherlock’s attention.  He was smiling but in a way that reminded Sherlock that this small man was not as harmless as he looked and, being both a doctor and a soldier, probably knew at least seven ways to incapacitate him with just the dessert spoon sitting on the table.   “She was nervous.  She just met the brother of her country's ruler.  You could cut her some slack.”
“Not him,” said Sherlock.  “Tourist on a skiing holiday.  No idea why the cabbie was taking him through the village though.”
“Well, I did,” said Sherlock.  “Except when I was at boarding school and uni.”
Sherlock was staring down at the scarf, running his longer fingers down the lines of knitting.  The ends of the scarf were decorated with a pattern of pine trees, knit in black yarn that was only visible when viewed up close.
It was this last thought that made John step back and open the door to his room.  It was much better to not overstep the bounds and potentially embarrass Sherlock in to never opening up to anyone else ever again.
“How’d he do it?” asked John.
“Oh, sorry sir,” said the waitress.  “Thank you, sir.  I’ll just-“ She curtsied again and left them, practically running back into the kitchen.
“In case you hadn’t noticed,” said Mycroft.  “I was having a private conversation with your friend.”
Mrs. Hudson smiled indulgently and patted him on the arm.  “Don’t worry,” she said.  “Everyone here is very liberal minded.  In fact, Sherlock’s cousin, the Lord of Farthingham just had the most beautiful gay wedding last summer and-“
A conspicuous throat clearing to John’s left reminded him suddenly that they were at a party.  He looked and saw Mycroft standing there.
“Want to see some more?”
Sherlocks thumbs moved in a blur and then hit send.  He set the phone down on the table.  “With the murderer, I expect.”
Suddenly, John felt the urge to punch Sherlock in the nose. Why was he holding John here yet keeping him at arm’s length?  If he wanted John to leave, if he wanted to pretend the last few days hadn’t happen, then why was he making it more difficult for John to go?
And then they were kissing again.  In the distance, John heard muffled cheering as the party down the hall began the countdown to midnight.
“There’s been a murder,” said Sherlock, gleefully.  “Not just a murder.  Four murders!  John, we have a serial killer on our hands!”
“No,” said Sherlock.  “The palace ran a background check on you.  Standard protocol.”
“Even the hunting lodge that nobody visits is decorated for Christmas,” commented John.
“Poison,” said Sherlock, stepping closer to John and leaning in to speak into John’s ear.
“You are,” said John, softly.  He leaned up to kiss him again, but Sherlock pulled back.
“We can warm up here for a bit and then take the snowmobile back,” said Sherlock.  “And we’ll be back to the palace in time for dinner.
“Very well.  The new diet must be working,” said Sherlock as he followed Mycroft into the dining room.  “Your buttons are under considerably less strain than they were a few weeks ago.”
John leaned over and saw the mud, just as Sherlock had said though he’d never have noticed it if it hadn’t been pointed out.  “Brilliant, breathed John.
And John couldn’t even enjoy it.  His mind was spinning, trying to figure out what Sherlock was doing.  This obviously connected to the poison in some way, but John couldn’t see how.  He gently disentangled himself as soon as he reasonably could, and Sherlock let him go easily.  John rested his forehead on Sherlock’s chest, and he felt Sherlock’s hands come down and press in to his shoulders.  Then John pulled away completely and turned to look at the crowd.
“You never were one to let anything get between you and a good meal,” said Sherlock.
“Do you think-“ started John but Sherlock was already running from the table, swinging his coat around him as he went.   John was behind him before he could even consider it, pausing only to grab his coat from the back of the chair.
“How can you possibly know about the drinking?”
“Yes,” said Lestrade.  “They’re on the way to the lab now.  We’ll let you know when we have the results.”
“Yeah, I think I’ve met as many rich socialites as I can handle for one evening,” said John.
John would have been happy to just keep kissing and save the talking for the morning, but Sherlock eventually pulled back.
“It’s fine,” said John.  “I didn’t mind. It was actually relaxing to just sit quietly for a while and not have people talking my ear off or the tele going in the background.”
John was about to ask Sherlock what he was doing when he felt Sherlock’s fingers intertwine with his own.  “What-?” he started to ask, but Sherlock cut him off.
It will be another two or threes days until I can publish the next chapter most likely.  Ooh, but the next ones going to be a good one!  I'm already working on it because I have some PLANS for these two!
Sherlock swept up the two champagne flutes before striding out of the room.  “Come on, John,” he called over his shoulder.
John opened his door and pulled Sherlock through.  He shut the door and turned to face Sherlock.  The room was dark except for the Christmas tree and Sherlock’s face glowed gold in the light.  Sherlock was looking at John again with all his focus, his eyes roving around his face.  John waited for a moment, letting Sherlock take it in.  Then he couldn’t wait any longer and he stepped forward.  He put his hands on Sherlock’s chest, sliding them up to his shoulders. Sherlock seemed frozen, his eyes fluttering shut as John ran a thumb over the bare skin of Sherlock’s clavicle.  Then put at hand on John’s check, cupping his jaw and leaned down to kiss him.  They started slowly but very quickly, Sherlock began leaning in, pressing insistently until John’s back was against the door.
“You,” said Sherlock.  “A doctor and a soldier.”
“You should stay here tonight,” he said in a rush.
John felt an enormous sense of relief when they arrived in his room, though he was surprised to find that he thought of it as his room.  There was a small card on the accent table by the door with the palace logo on the outside.  Inside, there was a note from Sherlock which read, ‘John, The dress code for the evening is casual so a nice jumper should suffice.  I’ll come by your room around 8pm.  It is typically prudent to eat before these events, so I’ve asked Mrs Hudson to send you up a sandwich. -S of A’.
It's Christmas morning in Aldovia!  Time for presents and cinnamon rolls (a traditional Aldovian food).
That left Sherlock and John alone in the room, sitting together on the sofa.
He was on the verge of opening his texts and texting Sherlock when he remembered his last unanswered text and the conversation they’d had after.  He put his phone down and laid back down in bed and spent the darkest hours of the night trying to convince himself that he really was better off without Sherlock, out of the public eye and living the life that had been intended for him.
Sherlock looked at him for a moment.  “Well, if you need anything, you have my number.”
“Mycroft’s,” said Sherlock.  “I’ll make sure he gets it back.  Now, I need to work on this analysis.  It will take some time and I’m sure it won’t be interesting to you.”
Sherlock reached into his breast pocket to retrieve something that he held tightly in his hand. He looked up to John’s face.  His eyes were red rimmed making the blue even more vivid and there where honest to God tears gathering at the corners.
John spent a few minutes looking around the room before he picked a book and settled down to read.  It was only a few minutes later when he heard the door open and the approach of some posh sounding shoes.
In the time it took John to find a fresh sweater in his suitcase, Sherlock was already dressed in yesterday’s clothes.
“What?  Did you think I was lying to you when I said I liked your music?”
As he entered the station, a quick glance at the screen told him a Gatwick train was leaving in two minutes.  He ran forward, people yelling at him as he pressed through the crowds.  He stepped on to the train just as the doors were closing.
“Yeah,” said John, his face suddenly softening.  “I supposed it would be.”  They both looked out the window for a moment as a light dusting of snow fell in the square.  John watched as a mother and her young daughter stopped to look at the tree in the square.  The mother picked the girl up and leaned closer to the tree so the girl could gently touch one of the large red baubles that was nearly as big as her head.
“I’m so pleased you decided to stop by this evening but you did give poor Dorothea quite a fright,” said the man as he shook Sherlock's hand.
“Yes, I cleared his name in a drugs charge,” said Sherlock.
“You said I’ve got a therapist.”
“Sherlock,” Sherlock practically growel.
John looked at the gift, stunned for a moment.  Then he burst out laughing.
“John, what are you doing?” he asked, his voice rough.
“John, I need to start my analysis of the poison.  I allow Mr. Tregennis to go free because the technicians at the lab can’t do a simple analysis.”
John felt a crack somewhere behind his sternum at Mycroft’s words but the tiny, incandescent spark was still there, glowing brightly, and would be until he heard those words from Sherlock’s lips. John stared at Sherlock.  His face was blank, his eyes still fixed on the floor and a small crease was forming between his eyes.  John couldn’t read his expression, couldn’t tell if the sentiment Mycroft relayed really came from Sherlock or if it had been forced on him.
Sherlock nodded, silently.
“Oh but it is exciting,” said Sherlock.  He stopped short, just in front of John.  He was standing very close again as though he didn’t fully understand the concept of boundaries and personal space.  “Serial killers are all just waiting to be caught.  They want the appreciation.  And this one in particular is very clever.  He’s made them all look like suicides.”
It'll be a few days before I get the next chapter out but we are in the home stretch!!  Happy New Years!
“Much as I am loathed to come between you two, Mummy has requested that you come talk to Mr Tuner, the head of the Agricultural Committee.  He has a bit of a mystery for you and we all know how you love your mysteries.”
“I can tell after just a few moments in your presence that Sherlock is infinitely the better man between the two of you.”
When it seemed that Sherlock wasn’t going to break the silence, John cleared his throat.  Sherlock looked at him and set the papers down.
The looked at each other for a few moments and then Sherlock cleared his throat.  “You may as well get some sleep in an actual bed,” he said.  “Mine’s just in the next room.  I won’t be in for a while yet.  I need to call Lestrade and give him my information.”
“I think it’s for the best, John.”
“I didn’t have time,” said Sherlock, turning away from John back to his workstation.
Sherlock’s iron grip wrapped around John’s arm.  “Come on,” he hissed into John’s ear.  He pulled John through the doorway into a circular room with a small stage at one end.  They took a seat and the choir filed on to the stage.
“Harry Watson.  Clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone.  Not your father.  Could be a cousin but you’re a war hero who’s spending his first Christmas home alone in a foreign country.  Unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to.  So, brother it is.  Now, Clara.  Who’s Clara?  Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment.  The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend.  This model’s only six months old. Marriage in trouble.  Only six months old, he’s just giving it away.  If she’d left him, he would have kept it.  People do.  Sentiment.  No, he wanted rid of it.  He left her.  He gave the phone to you.  That says he wants you to stay in touch. And he just gave you this trip rather than try to get a refund which you took him up on, so you didn’t have to spend the holidays with him.  That says you’ve got problems with him.  Maybe you liked his wife.  Maybe you don’t like his drinking.”
“Your present really was perfect.  I don’t think I’ve ever received anything as thoughtful,” he said and took a step closer to Sherlock.  Sherlock took a step forward as well so John tilted up and pressed his lips to Sherlock. It was just like the previous night, the tension draining away from Sherlock as John’s lips moved over his.
“I shouldn’t be too long and in the meantime, help yourself to any of the books,” said Sherlock.
“Only the CEO of one of our largest corporations and the head of the number one media organization.”
John managed to wait for almost an hour before he left and began roaming the palace.  He checked the family’s quarters where he’d eaten dinner with them and opened presents with them. He checked the music room and the ballroom.  He even checked the kitchen where he’d first met Sherlock.  He saw no one save a few servants who nodded to him and then averted their eyes.
One more chapter to go!  And it is written and ready to be posted.  If you've stuck with me this long, thank you!  This has been a really enjoyable part of my Christmas season this year and I hope you've enjoyed it too!
John hesitated before lifting the woman’s hair.  Sherlock looked up at him then and gave him a little encouraging smile and nod.  John lifted the woman's hair and inspected her face, mouth, neck and hands and even went so far as to lean down and sniff her breath.
“Sorry, did you just text a murderer with my phone?” asked John, slightly incredulous.
“Wow, Sherlock,” said John, laying a calming hand on his arm.  “Ok.  It’s ok. We don’t have to talk about it right now.”
“Sorry.”
Eventually, they heard a clock strike eleven o’clock in the distance. Sherlock shook himself and looked up at John.  John glanced down at his book quickly so he could at least have plausible deniability.  Sherlock stretched, his back arching away from the chair and John was staring again.
Every time his mind wandered, Sherlock’s face floated through his head and he was seized with the urge to text him or Google him and see if there were any new news stories about him that would give John some idea of how he was doing.
John pulled at his tie and the cuffs of his jacket.  He hoped he wouldn’t stick out too much from what was likely to be a very posh crowd.  He was glad he’d brought the suit with him.  Part of Harry’s trip had included a reservation at a very fancy restaurant that couldn’t be canceled.  But the suit was at least five years out of date, certainly from before his army years.  Well, the worst thing that could happen would be getting thrown out and he wouldn’t be any worse off than he was and he’d get a good story out of it.
They stopped at John’s door.  John put a hand on the door handle.  “Goodnight, Sherlock,” John said, turning to Sherlock.  Sherlock was standing nearer than John expected, staring down at him, looming really.  John’s heart was suddenly in his throat, pounding fit to beat the band.
“I believe I owe you dinner,” said Sherlock.
John looked up at Sherlock and caught his eye.  Sherlock gave him a small nod.  “Excuse us for just a moment,” he said as they made their way to the edge of the crowd.   Sherlock pulled John through a door into the kitchen.  He kept a tight grip on John’s hand and pulled him through the kitchen and out into a service corridor.
“Don’t worry, John,” said Sherlock.
They stood there, grinning at each other like idiots in the doorway for several long seconds.  Standing and staring at someone for so long without saying or doing anything should have felt awkward but John found that he didn’t really want to move.  Neither, it seemed, did Sherlock.  John was in the middle of wondering if he could get thrown in the dungeon for trying to kiss the prince, and if it might be worth trying anyway, when there was a sound behind them.
John turned again, reaching for his phone while Sherlock moved on to pressing kisses into John’s shoulder blades.
“Sherlock!” said John again.  He grabbed hold of Sherlock’s forearm and held him still, forcing him to turn to face him.
The shouting of the reporters roared out of the speakers, making John cringe.
“Drink?” asked Sherlock, taking two glasses and a bottle of whiskey from the liquor cabinet.  He poured them both drinks and then sat down across from John in a dark, leather armchair.
“Of course,” said Angelo, finally releasing him.  “Anything you want, on the house.  Sherlock here got me out of a tight spot,” he said, turning to John.
“It’s alright,” said Sherlock, looking down again and breaking his intense eye contact. “So, dinner?”
John turned to see a man in a chef's jacket, with his long hair pulled back coming towards him.  Sherlock stood and extended his hand for the man to shake.
Sherlock shrugged again but he kept his eyes on John’s face.
“Sherlock!”
The car pulled into the drive and stopped before the palace door.  The snow was falling heavily now in glittering puff balls, reflecting the light from the palace.  Sherlock put his hand on the doorhandle but didn’t move to get out of the car.  He looked out at the snow and back at John.
Sherlock turned back to look at him.  Fluffy white snowflakes were gathering in his dark hair and on his eyelashes and his cheeks were already going pink from the cold.  “It’s not there, John,” he called.  “You left it at Angelo’s.  Don’t worry, we can get it back.  Not that you need it.
John’s suit had been pressed and his dress shirt had been laundered while they’d been out.  John was incredibly grateful to whatever domestic fairy that had done that, though it was probably Mrs. Hudson.  John made a point to thank her if he saw her.
“It’s more fun than room service,” said Sherlock softly, with a smile.  Then he stood and faced Lestrade.  “You are looking for a pink suitcase.  Whoever has the suitcase is the killer.”
Sherlock just looked over his shoulder at him and grinned.
The half hour journey up the mountain to the palace was the longest half hour of John’s life.  The dark pine trees outside the window seemed to crawl by.  By the time the palace came in to view, John felt like he was going to throw up or cry or punch something but instead, he had to sit still in the back of the car with shaking knees and buzzing hands.
“That… was brilliant.”
“You first, John,” said Sherlock, softly.
“I honestly have no idea.”
“How on Earth did you have this made in a single day?” asked John, still laughing.
“We heard you’ve been helping out the police again,” said Tall, Dark and Smarmy.
John tilted his head, confused.  “Aren’t princes allowed phones?”
“Alright, you’ve made your point,” said Sherlock as he put the violin back in the case.  He turned back around to face John and his face had gone from stony to stormy.  “I imagine you’ll be wanting breakfast.” He stalked across the room and tried to get passed John and through the door, but John grabbed his arm.
John felt Sherlock shudder, his face still hidden in John’s neck.  Then Sherlock’s arms wrapped around him, pulling them close together.  Sherlock took several deep breaths, then pulled back and stared pulling John to the bed by the hand.
“Everything should be stocked.  Toiletries and a fresh toothbrush are in the cabinet.  Towels under the sink.”
“I don’t know, I see. Your haircut, he way you hold yourself says military. Your face is tanned but not tanned above the wrists.  So, you were abroad but not sunbathing.  Your limps really bad when you walk but you haven’t asked for a chair and you stand like you’ve forgotten about it.  Your therapist thinks it’s psychosomatic, quite rightly I’m afraid.  That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic.  Wounded in action then.  Wounded in action, suntanned. Afghanistan or Iraq.”
Sherlock led John down the hill and into the lodge.  John stood just inside the doorway, brushing snow off his coat, and kicking it off his boots while Sherlock ran around the lodge, tracking snow everywhere.  There was already wood in the fireplace and Sherlock knelt to light the kindling.  A blazing fire sprung up so quickly that it almost seemed like magic.  There was a large Christmas tree on the far wall and garlands along the railings and banisters.  Sherlock flipped a switch, and the lights came on, bathing the inside of the lodge with a warm glow.  The lodge was much more casual than the palace and John could actually see himself feeling at home in it.
They also discussed John’s background in the military and his medical career.  Violet asked many of the same questions Sherlock had though in a much less intense and probing way.
The cab pulled up into the snowy, circular drive.  It hadn’t snowed in the two days that he’d been in Aldovia.  Why was there still snow on the royal drive?  He opened the door and stepped out of the car, putting his foot, in his nicest pair of shoes, in a pile of slush.  John was just reaching into his pocket for his wallet when he heard a commotion behind him.
“Do you interrogate all of Sherlock’s friends?” asked John.
“Sherlock,” asked John, catching him between sentences.  “Do you want to come in?”
John pulled Sherlock closer and kissed him into the new year.
“How on earth did you know that?  Was it a callous on my left thumb or something like that?”
“That not what people normally say.”
John leaned in to the open cab door.  “Everything alright?”
“No, I couldn’t,” said John.
“But you can’t have serial suicides,” said John, mystified. He was leaning heavily on his cane as his left foot slowly went numb in the snow.
Sherlock gave him a look that John was beginning to think meant Sherlock thought he was being an idiot.  “I have an entire palace at my disposal.  It wouldn’t be an imposition.”
Sherlock was still talking as he flitted around the room picking up pillows only to replace them and moving things on the mantle slightly to the left or right.
“That’s not necessary,” said the King in an oily voice.  His voice was higher than his brother’s and, though he spoke softly, he had a presence that could clearly command the room if he needed to.  “Sit down, John.”
As the cab drove away, John looked at Sherlock and they both broke out laughing.
“I have,” said John, breathlessly.
“It’s so nice of you to take an interest in community matters,” said Simon.  “And it’s so kind of the detective to allow you to tag along.”
“Yes. I put it in your phone before I texted the murderer.”
“You think so?” John caught a pleased expression on Sherlocks face before he turned away.
“Wait,” said John, turning towards him.  “What am I supposed to do? Just ring the bell and say I’m here to see the Prince?”
It was fully dark by the time the fire had died down and Sherlock announced it was time to return to the castle.  They bundle up into their cold weather clothes and went out in to the darkness. Sherlock handed John a helmet and pushed his own down on to his head flattening his curls.
“You shouldn’t be alone on Christmas Eve,” said Sherlock.  “Stay here at the palace.” John opened his mouth to respond but Sherlock cut him off.  “If you’re about to say you’re concerned out imposing, that really isn’t necessary, I assure you.  There are always far too many people here for Christmas Eve and Christmas day.  It would be nice if there was one among them whose company, I don’t find repellent.”
He passed behind Matilda, talking animatedly to a woman who looked somewhat familiar, as he circle the room.
John watched as his words sank in and Sherlock unclenched his teeth and his shoulders lowered and he uncrossed his arms.  “Royal pain in the ass, was the expression I believe,” he said but there was the faintest hint of grin, just around the corner of his mouth.
John brought a hand around to rub up and down Sherlock’s back.  “It’s fine,” he said.
John eventually dozed off but was woken by the feeling of a hand on his knee.  Sherlock was kneeling in front of John’s chair, shaking his knee gently.  John smiled lazily at Sherlock and stretched in the chair, arching his back to get the kinks in his shoulders out.  “What time is it?” he asked.
“We believe so,” said Lestrade.  “Mrs Hudson here says she does not remember hiring him.  We’ve looked through payroll information as well and his name doesn’t appear.”
“I’m sure it wasn’t important,” said Mycroft, turning to leave.
As the train neared the airport, his heart rate gradually began to increase until he was bouncing his heel and feeling queasy.  When the train pulled into the station, John was positioned at the doors and he took off like a sprinter at the pistol when they opened.  He raced through the nearly empty airport, thanking Christ for the light New Year’s Eve traffic.  The security line was short and after a quick race through the terminal, he was at the gate.
John goes to the Christmas party and gets quite a surprise.  And there's a murderer! John, it's Christmas!
John’s stomach twisted at that and he gripped Sherlocks arm where his hand still lay tighter.  “I can think of many advantages to knowing you,” said John softly.
“Celebrating Christmas is traditional,” said Sherlock.  “Aldovia’s main exports are nutcrackers and blown glass Christmas ornaments.  The palace is meant to reflect our national pride in our artisans.”
Sherlock was looking at him with his piercing blue eyes and John thought he could almost see the mechanisms of Sherlock’s brilliant mind moving behind them.  “Thank you, John,” he said softly.
John tapped Sherlocks foot with his toe.  When Sherlock didn’t look at him, he leaned forward, hesitated for a moment and then put his hand on Sherlock’s knee.  That got Sherlocks attention and he swung he head round to look at John.
He followed Sherlock down the hall and into the room he pointed out.  In comparison to the sitting room and the study, Sherlock’s bedroom was as neat as a pin.  The bed was made, and the surfaces were clear of clutter.  The room was decorated in the same ornate style as the rest of the rooms in the palace had been.  But the bed was a simple four poster in dark wood with a grey duvet and sheets.
Sherlock turned at the sound of footsteps in the hall.  His face was stony, but his eyes were wide.  He took a small step forward as John approached.
“You were in the army.  Saw a bit of trouble, I expect.”
Instead, he said, “Open yours.”
The waitress looked at him like he’d sprouted antennae and was speaking Welsh.
“This is Dr. John Watson,” said Sherlock.  “He’s with me.”
John stood alone again by the tree, unsure if he should feel triumphant or not.
“What for?” he bit out.
John sat in the chair across from him.  He waited for Sherlock to say something, but Sherlock only stared in to the fire.  Eventually, John gave up waiting and picked up a book that happened to be sitting nearby.  It was a memoir of an old Aldovian war hero from the 19th century.  John read, his attention half on the book and half on Sherlock.  As he read longer and the hour grew later, he lost focus on the book more and more often until, eventually, he was just watching Sherlock as Sherlock watched the dancing embers in the fire.
“That too,” said Angelo.  “But I was talking about setting me up to cater the big garden party up at the palace every summer.  It’s done wonders for my business.”
He was the last person on the plane, but he made it.
Inside, the pub was bustling and warm.  The Christmas decorations were much more subtle, limited to garland, lights over the bar and several strategically placed sprigs of mistletoe.  There was a noticeable dip in the sound level as they entered and people began to notice that the prince had just entered the pub.
The library was a large room on the ground floor with floor to ceiling bookshelves that even had rolling ladders to get to the top shelves.  It looked out on to the decorative garden that John had seen from his room.  There were several soft looking arms chairs by the large windows and a fire had been lit and was crackling away.  It looked like a perfect place to spend the morning.
John entered a small dining room, or at least what John took to be small for the palace.  The table looked like it could seat about twelve.  Sherlock was seated at the head of the table and was perusing a stack of newspapers while he picked at a piece of toast.
“Why did you come back?” asked Sherlock again and he looked so thoroughly confused that John couldn’t help but smile.
Sherlock ripped the back door open.  He looked in for about half a second and then stalked away.
“I can’t imagine what he’s trying to achieve by befriending Sherlock like that,” said the first man.  “There’s little enough Sherlock can do for someone who’s not even a citizen of the country.”
“Thank you, Ma- um, Violet,” said John and he could tell he was blushing again.  He made the mistake at looking at Sherlock how was looking down at him with the smallest, sweetest smile.  It seemed to John that Sherlock had a wealth of different smiles for different occasions and John was surprised to realize how much he enjoyed discovering new ones.
“Why?” asked Mike, concern pooling on his face.  “Are you alright?”
“I don’t know,” said John. “I don’t think I’d have anything appropriate to wear.”
“It was worth it,” said the man, tied to the chair.  “You would have deserved it and so much the better if someone you cared about got hurt too.”
“He was spotted dumping a pink suitcase in a tip behind a restaurant.  The owner thought it was suspicious so she called the police and they turned up immediately and arrested him.  Boring.”
“Go on,” he said encouragingly.
By this point the snow was beginning to fall more heavily.  Sherlock hailed another cab and they settled in for another long drive up the mountain to the castle.  The castle was visible long before they reached it, the plethora of Christmas lights shining through the trees.
“Can I borrow your phone?”
“Of course, of course,” she said, shooing John through the doorway.
“You’re lost.”  It was a statement, not a question and it came from the man who was beating what appeared to be an entire side of pork with a riding crop.  He hadn’t turned around, but he seemed to be too well dressed to be staff and why would a staff member be tenderizing meat with a riding crop?  “You could have kept up with the tour group, even with your limp.  Fancied a look below stairs, I take it?”
“No time for that,” said Sherlock.  He closed his eyes and scrunched up his face.  “This way!” he shouted, running off in the opposite direction.
“Let’s go,” said Sherlock grinning.  “Mycroft can’t abide tardiness.”
“Good morning, John” he said, his back still turned.
“It wouldn’t be an imposition,” said Violet.  “Hundreds of people will be there, so what’s one more?”
The Prince stared a John for a moment with a deadpan expression.  Then John’s face split into a grin and the Prince grinned back at him, ducking his head like he was embarrassed.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock.
“Excellent,” said Sherlock, grinning again.  He leapt out of the car and started bounding for the door.  John moved to follow him and then noticed that he didn’t have his cane.  He looked around the floor of the car, thinking maybe he’d set it down without realizing.
“I should go,” said Sherlock, standing.  “You can make yourself at home.  You know where the library is or your welcome to explore the grounds or the sitting room and music room are open to you-“
The train car was nearly empty, and he sank into the nearest seat, panting heavily.  Then he looked at his phone.  The last plane of the evening headed for Aldovia was leaving at 21:10. He had 55 minutes.  He bought the ticket.
“Shall we walk back together?” asked Sherlock, doing a very good impression of nonchalance.
“Well,” said John.  “You got the army service, you got that I was here on my own, you knew all about Harry and Clara and the drinking.  The only thing is that Harry’s my sister.  Short for Harriet.”
As they were clearing away dessert, Violet turned to John and asked, “You are planning on coming to the ball, aren’t you?”
“Thank you,” said John.  “To the best Christmas I could have imagined having.” He clicked his glass against Sherlocks and then raised it to his lips.
“For being there.  For not judging me.  For accepting me.”  And this time, it was obvious Sherlock was moving towards him, hovering just above him.  John couldn’t look away from Sherlocks eyes.  He was pretty sure the palace could start crumbling around them and he wouldn’t care.  “John,” said Sherlock in a near whisper.
“No,” said the king slowly.  “Of course not.”
Mycroft sniffed and set the mug delicately on the table.  “Too kind, John.”
Sherlock pulled a small card out of an inner pocket and placed it on the table.  It was pink with darker pink letters spelling out the name Jennifer Wilson.
“I’ll think you’ll find that he did,” said Sherlock. “Don’t worry.  You’ll be joining him soon enough.  If you’re lucky, they might even let you share a cell.”
“What did you text him?” asked John.  He unlocked his phone and read the latest text.  ‘What happened at Lauriston House?  I must have black out.  Meet me at 10 St. Michael's Square.’  John was half curious to see what would happen next and half furious with Sherlock for apparently texting a murder asking him to meet them at the pub.  The two halves warred for a moment but the curious part won out.
Merry Christmas Eve! I hope you're doing something to make you happy today!
John filled his plate and sat down at the table.  It was actually rather cosy, despite the grandeur of the room.  John took a sip of his tea and grimaced.  It tasted like it had about three tablespoons of sugar in it.
The anger that had been bristling along John’s neck suddenly broke free.  He stepped between Sherlock and Simon.  “Don’t you know you shouldn’t comment about things you don’t understand?” he asked, smiling the smile that didn’t reach his eyes but left them cold and glaring.
“Yes,” said Sherlock. “Hold both these glasses but do not drink.  Stay here.  I’ll be back.” Sherlock shoved the other glass into John’s fingers and took off across the room.  John saw him stop and exchange a few words with Mrs Hudson before the crowd obscured Sherlock from view.
“Ok,” said John, uncertainly.  “I supposed I can just-“
“We have loads of time,” said Sherlock.  “We don’t have to be there until nine.”
A man was sitting in the middle of a storage room, surrounded by shelves piled with bags of pasta and flour.  His forearms tied to the armrests of the chair he sat in and a uniformed police officer was sitting nearby, keeping her eye on him.  DI Lestrade and Mrs Hudson, were standing to the side, talking.  On the self-nearest them, sat the two offending champagne flutes.
Several hours later and one delicious sandwich later, he was dressed and pacing around his room, fiddling with his phone and wating for Sherlock.  John hadn’t been this nervous for a date in years.  But it wasn’t a date, as he continually reminded himself.
Sherlock froze for a moment and then leapt out of bed, throwing off the covers and rampaging around the room looking for clothes.
“So the murder does have the phone,” said Sherlock, grinning again.
The prince came to stand directly in front of him again, even closer than before.  He put a hand on John’s shoulder.  John looked up because the Prince was standing close enough that John had to look up to see his face.
John blinked, considering the question. “My aunt had cancer when I was young, and my mum went with her to appointments for more support.  She took me to a few of them and I guess, I was always just struck by how the doctor seemed to have all the answers.  Mum and Aunt Karen would have all these questions and be really worried about thing and then the doctor would come in and explain everything and put them at ease.  I just thought that would be nice to be able to do.”
“It’s quite alright,” said Sherlock.  “It was your attention to detail that tipped me off in this case.”
Greg chuckled.  “Best of luck to you,” he said.  “Go on.”
“Ok,” said John.  He was not particularly interested in walking through the maze of corridors back to his room when he could stay right here.  And, though the danger seemed to have passed, he still wanted to keep Sherlock as close as possible.
Sherlock was standing in a shadowy corridor, looking out a picture window at the dark and snowy forest.
Mrs. Hudson wrapped his hand in both of hers.  “Did he? That was very kind of you, Sherlock,” she called over her shoulder at Sherlock, who was already going into the other room.
Sherlock nodded once, curtly.
Eventually, John began to turn slowly, wanting to see Sherlock’s sleeping face.  As John settled on to his other side, he saw Sherlock peaking at him with on eye opened just a slit.
He stood uncertainly near the door for a few minutes, realizing the only people he knew were the royal family and they were likely to be too busy for John to be hanging on to all evening.  He walked around the edge of the room, looking for an out of the way spot to watch the dancers.
“Is that what you really want?” he asked, his voice soft and rough.
“How do you know I’m here alone?” John asked.
“Is the Prince gay?”
“This is mad,” said John.
Happy 2021!  May it be infinitely better than 2020!
Lestrade gave Sherlock a smile.  “Thanks, your highness.”
John was stopped with his hand on the door handle.  Sherlock was holding on to his arm, his grip like an iron vice.  John was forced to turn and look at Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock smiled a Cheshire cat grin.  “Oh, we are not nearly as important as your British royal family is, John.  Though, technically I should have alerted someone before I left the palace.  But Mycroft will have had eyes on me from the moment I got into the cab with you.”
“I really don’t think I can stomach another minute with those imbeciles in the other room.  I think I’ll retire early,” he said.
John couldn’t handle it any longer.  Did every single person in this room automatically think the worst of Sherlock?  He stepped around the tree and the two men turned to face him.  John would have laughed at their expressions if he hadn’t been so furious.
John opened his mouth and then closed it. He was about to say something very cutting when he heard the library door open again and this time it was Sherlock.  He walked past his brother, completely ignoring him and slid into the armchair across from where John had been sitting.  And then he kept sliding until he was practically hanging out of the chair and his legs were stretched out almost to John’s chair.
“It’s already late and it will be at least another forty-five-minute drive to your hotel in this weather.  Longer even.”
John reached up and put a hand on the back of Sherlock’s neck pulling them together.  John paused, his hand on Sherlock’s neck, Sherlock leaning over him and he watched Sherlock’s eyes fall shut.  John took a breath and leaned up to press his lips to Sherlock’s.
“They’re all so fake,” said Sherlock.  “It’s revolting.  They only show interest when there’s something for them to gain.  And they’re all so self-serving, only concerned with their own estates and staff and ponies.  It disgusts me.”
John was barely listening as he stared around the room.  They were standing in a sitting room with a massive fireplace and a Christmas tree in front of the picture window. John actually had to look around the corner to the next room to see the edge of a large, four poster bed.  Everything was done up in pale blues, and greens and creams and gold.  John was fairly certain his entire flat would fit in this room.  Twice.
Sherlock still hadn’t moved as though he was waiting to see what John would do.  John suddenly realized he had no idea what to say or how to explain his presence.  But his body was screaming at him that he was this close to Sherlock and not touching him.
John spent the rest of the morning in the library, reading by the fire.  Mrs Hudson came to fine him around just after noon to tell him there was lunch in his room and the royal address would be broadcast soon.  As John passed one of the large windows on the first floor on the way back to his room, he looked out and saw a sea of reporters in front of the castle steps.
“I should have thought that was obvious,” said John, still grinning. He leaned up for another kiss.  Sherlock kissed him back for a moment but pulled away again quickly.
“I’m not,” he whispered.
“Because it would be much more comfortable to sit and talk in my room than to stand in the corridor.”
He smiled as he ran a hand over the jacket and then set about getting ready.
Sherlock was already sweeping through another door and down a short corridor.  John followed him into what must have been intended as a study.  It had large windows and floor to ceiling bookshelves.  A work top had been placed along one wall that was clearly not part of the original design of the room.  Sherlock set the champagne flutes down on the worktop and began pulling out beakers and test tubes and burners.
“I will,” said Sherlock.  “But first, let’s meet our assassin.”
John ignored them all.  He was scanning the room for one face.  But before he could find Sherlock, Violet approached him.
“Why? What’s going on?” asked John.
“What do people normally say?”
“Ok, do you want to tell me what your problem is?” he asked in a voice that made it very clear that it was not an actual question but a demand. “Because you are acting like a royal pain in the ass this morning.”
“I’ll show you to the library,” said Sherlock.
He lay awake for a while, not in any particular hurry to fall back asleep. The last few days had felt like a fairy tale, like he had stumbled in to a world not his own and at any moment, he could be yanked out of the story and back into his own mundane life.  A moment like this with Sherlock might never come again and he wanted to appreciate the silence and stillness and the feel of Sherlock’s hand at his waist and his hair tickling John’s nose.
“Lint,” said the Prince.  He had a very large piece of white, fluffy lint, pinched between his leather gloved fingers.  “This is clearly from the robes at the ski lodge up the mountain.  You had your coat hanging in the same closet.  If you were with someone, they would have noticed it and picked it off.  If you’d have planned this trip, you would have stayed in the village.  Much more convenient and you wouldn’t think yourself up for skiing, though you would be.  Your brother and his wife planned this trip but when their marriage fell apart, your brother gave you his ticket.  And you, having been in the army for the past few years, had no one to ask to come with you.”
John made himself as presentable as he could in his yesterday’s suit before venturing out of his room.  He had no idea where to go or even what he should be doing.  He considered texting Sherlock, but he thought if he wandered long enough, he’d find a servant or someone who could help him.  He went back up the corridor the way he’d come last night.  The palace was very still as though the snowy quiet from outside had made its way inside.
“That was amazing,” said John.
“Mrs Hudson would never allow a glass to leave her kitchen in that state.”
“A pink suitcase?” asked Lestrade.
John took a deep breath and began walking towards him.
“There was a murder at the ball.  He nearly poisoned both you and me.  But he’s in custody now and- “
John glanced over at Sherlock and Sherlock immediately looked down at his phone, his lips pressed together in a tight line.  “Do you mean, when you deduced everything about my life based on my tan, my limp and my phone?”
“No,” said Sherlock. “I’ll go and leave you to your evening.”
He approached the large, carved double doors and knocked.  The door opened and John recognized the footman who had helped him with his suitcase.  The footman grinned.
“Are you ok?  Can we talk?” John typed and sent it before he could rethink it.  He sat and stared at his phone for a few seconds, hoping to see Sherlock’s response pop up right before his eyes.  When it didn’t, John stood and began pacing the room, his phone in his hand.  He kept checking the phone every few seconds.  He forced himself to wait, to try and distract himself.  Sherlock was certainly busy, and it didn’t mean anything that he hadn’t texted back.
“Is it because he’s in line for the throne?” asked Lestrade.
“Thanks, Mrs Hudson,” said John.  He flicked on the TV and picked at his sandwich until the Aldovian Royal crest filled the screen and a blare of trumpets pulled his attention with laser focus.
He looked up at Sherlock who had that small, uncertain smile on his face again, just briefly enough for John to see it.
“Just after two,” said Sherlock.
After the address, John went for a walk in the grounds, winding his way through the snow-covered ornamental gardens.  He made his way back to his room as the sun was beginning to set over the pine trees.
Sherlock’s shoes tapped against the hardwood floor as he walked back down the corridor to where John had stopped.
“And my skull.  I won’t give up my skull.  And I hate Cluedo.”
Then he took a step back, released John and sank to one knee.
Sherlock placed John directly in front of a woman with pure white hair set into a perfect bob and, oddly, eyes the exact same indescribable shade as Sherlock’s.  John gave a small bow.  “Your Majesty,” he said, feeling incredibly awkward.
Ten minutes later, as John lay in an incredibly soft bed, his half-asleep mind kept replaying images of Sherlock’s face, his hands, his smile, his eyes.  At first, he tried to force them away.  It felt like overstepping some sort of boundary to be thinking about this man, who he just met that morning, as he fell asleep.  He quickly gave it up as a lost cause.  What did it matter anyway?  He would maybe see the prince in the morning and then he’d be back to his hotel and back to England in a few days’ time and he’d never see him again.
“These are beautiful!” exclaimed Violet.  “Thank you, John!”
“Technically, yes.  But Palace PR has confiscated mine again.  They seem to think that tweeting about the kings crash diets and resulting mood swings is unseemly.”
The sweet sound of voices suffices the room, the sound slowly washing over John like the lazy waves of a river washing over stones.  The sound warmed him from the inside out.  He chanced a glance at Sherlock who had his eyes shut and his head tilted back.  John listened to the rest of the concert with half an eye on Sherlock.  He didn’t understand the word of the music, it was in Latin or maybe Spanish but he though he understood the message of hope and joy the music conveyed.
Half an hour later, John found himself in borrowed boots and gloves, wearing snowshoes and following behind Sherlock through the pine forest.  He’d been hesitant about the snowshoes, unsure if he could yet fully rely on his leg for balance and support.  Sherlock had insisted that it was the only way to manage the deep snow drifts and John found that an insistent Sherlock was difficult to deny.
“Shall we?” asked Violet, coming up to John’s side and giving him her arm so that he could lead her in to the dining room.
I hope all you lovely readers are making the best of this Christmas Day!
“Piss off.”
“Thank,” said the man, clearly puzzled.
As Mycroft enumerated the royal families many good deeds throughout the year, photos and videos of the family meeting with everyday Aldovian citizens flashed across the screen.  In most of these, Sherlock was standing, bored, in the back of the group.  But in one video of Mycroft meeting with a group of police officers, Sherlock was in the background, clearing investigating something in an evidence bag as two police officers stood by.
They exchanged gifts as Christmas carols played in the background.  John was touched to see that everyone had thought to give him a gift as well.  As the mountain of presents dwindled down, John had acquired enough glass baubles and wooden ornaments to trim an entire tree.  He was still nervous to give his gifts, but he was glad that he at least had something to give to express his appreciation for his warm, yet bizarre welcome into the royal family.
“And what’s that?”
The dinner was much less awkward than John had expected it to be.  Much of the dinner was given over to discussing the upcoming Christmas ball.  There were a lot of last-minute details to be finalized that John would probably have taken care of earlier.  But what did he know? He’d never planned a ball in his life and clearly Violet had planned many.  Still, he would have thought details like the musicians and the flower arrangements would have needed to be settled weeks in advance.
“They caught the killer,” he said morosely.
“Merry Christmas,” said John, looking up at Sherlock.  Because Sherlock was looming again, pressing into John’s space as much as he could without crossing the boundaries into ‘inappropriate in public’.
Instantly, everyone turned to the people they’d been talking to and began talking again but this time at a furious pitch and with many, no so subtle glances at John.
“Mrs. Hudson,” said Sherlock appearing at the door again.  “Stop talking John’s ear off.  His tea’s getting cold.”
“The engraving.”
Instead, he went to look at the Christmas tree.  It was the grandest tree he’d seen in the palace and he’d seen a lot of them.  It was covered in gold and cream ribbon and decorated with handblown glass bulbs and carved wooden ornaments.  John made his way around the far side of the tree, looking at the ornaments and he was just looking at a large acorn when he heard voices on the other side of the tree.
“Happy New Year!” he said cheerfully.
The whole group laughed at that and the sound sent a surge of anger through John.  He took two deep breaths and moved away from the group, instead of getting right in the smarmy, dark haired man’s face and telling exactly how much Sherlock had done in that case and exactly how amazing he’d been.
The bed was empty when John woke.  John tried not to take the emptiness personally, tried not to let it in.  But the warm glow that had been growing over the last few days was shrinking down in to a small, cold, black pit and the space that had been left behind felt empty and gaping.  Tomorrow John would leave, and he would never see Sherlock again.
Towards the end of the meal, as John was finishing a piece of chocolate gateau, Sherlock suddenly cut off in the middle of explaining the Aldovian legal system.  “John, outside.  No, don’t look,” he demanded as John turned his head.  “There’s a cab outside.  It’s stopped but no one’s getting in or out.”
“I’m sorry,” said Sherlock.  “You must have had a very dull evening.  I was thinking about a problem and sometimes I get so caught up in my own mind that I forget there are other people around.”
“I agree with you, ma’am,” said the Prime Minister.  “It’s only a matter of selling the idea to parliament.  But if we have the backing of the royal family, it would certainly help.”
“I’d like your opinion, Doctor,” said Sherlock, breaking the silence.
“Mmmphf,” said Sherlock, closing his eyes and ducking his head under the covers and closer into John’s chest.
“Mine was confiscated.”
“I shall treasure it always,” said Mycroft, with an oily grin which shifted to a grimace as he sipped his coffee.
John leapt to his feet.  He considered bowing but he hadn’t bowed to Sherlock and this was only his brother.  He settled for standing at attention.
“Yes, well,” said Sherlock, staring out the window.  “It’s enough to make some people lose their tiny minds.”
John kept moving, not wanting to interrupt what seemed to be an important conversation.  He found a spot at the edge of the room and settled in to watch the dancing and listen to the music, hoping just to say hello to Sherlock at some point during the evening.
“Who’s in charge of the palace Christmas decorations?” asked John.
“Pills.  One poisoned and one safe.  He made the victims choose one at gunpoint and then they both took them.”
Sherlock was still asleep, now clinging to John’s back.  John must have rolled again in the night and Sherlock followed him so that they were both on the edge of the bed, pressed together front to back.
Eventually, John gave up and went to Sherlock’s room.  He knocked on the door and then tried the handle.  When he had no response, he decided to wait.  He stood by the door and then leaned on the door and finally slid to the floor and sat with this back against Sherlocks door.  He focused his eyes on a spot on the wall and let his mind drift, trying so hard to think of nothing that eventually, there were no thoughts passing through his mind.
They sat for a moment in silence and Sherlock’s gaze returned to the window.  Suddenly leapt up.  “The snows letting up,” he said.
“Both the glasses will contain the poison,” said Sherlock.  “John certainly wasn’t the intended victim in this case.  He was trying to poison me but he was not afraid of causing some collateral damage.”
John shut the door and rapped on the roof.
A server with a tray of champagne flutes passed by and Sherlock plucked the remaining two off the tray, handing one to John.
Sherlock looked taken aback.  He released John’s arm and backed up a step.  “For being you.  For being kind to me.”
“John,” said Sherlock, breathlessly.  John could feel himself leaning in, like Sherlock was one tall, beautiful magnet.  He couldn’t be sure, but he thought Sherlock was leaning imperceptibly down as well.
Sherlock looked John in the eye.  “I trust you, remember?”
“Are you sure?” asked John.  “The glass could just be dirty.”
John pushed himself back to sit upright.  He cleared his throat and said, “No signs of strangulation. Asphyxiation, I’d say.  Choked on her own vomit. Pills though, not alcohol.”
“I still think he was making it up most of the time,” said the man John had seen that afternoon getting out of the sports car.  “Did you hear he was involved in the serial suicides?  The inspector on the case mentioned in the press conference that Sherlock “assisted”.  Can’t imagine how.”
