Cas stopped abruptly and Dean could feel the tension from the other side of the wall. He let the silence stand pregnant between them for several heartbeats before he broke it.
“Damn it, Balthazar, you did not just break the fucking stairs,” Cas grumbled. He looked down at his brother sprawled out on a flight of stairs. One foot had gone through a water damaged step. His head had crashed nearly through another step.
Cas thought frantically. How should he respond? He wasn’t good at this stuff. He didn’t know how to flirt in person let alone over a damn phone. He couldn’t wait too long or it would look like he didn’t feel that way. But did he feel that way? Cas was overwhelmed and fought to keep level headed. It didn’t help that he was feeling rather tired and would rather text Dean to meet him at his place to watch some movies and maybe snuggle. He could handle that but not actual emotions. Those took way too much work and dammit he still had to respond!
He arrived at a bar called Changes an hour after picking himself up off his apartment floor. Cas managed to make himself presentable. He didn't want to make it obvious he’d been crying against a wall. Now as he stood outside the building, he felt some of his courage slip away from him. He might have overreacted. Dean had been so nice to him that it didn’t seem too unlikely for Dean to have reacted the way he did because of something else. Cas thought fleetingly of going back home but he refused to turn around. He was done with being pathetic. Done with crying alone in an empty room. If Dean could ditch him without hesitation then why couldn’t Cas do the same? Why was it so difficult for him to let Dean go? He shook his head, deciding to go ahead with his original plan. With his mindset, he went into the bar. The beat of the bass immediately hit his body. The smell of alcohol overwhelmed him, along with the number of people that were in the building. Amazingly, there was a spot open at the bar. He hurried over to the lone empty bar stool. Ordering a double shot of tequila when the bartender came over. A few seconds later the shot glass was in his hand. Cas downed the drink, wrinkling his nose with distaste towards the bitter harsh taste, but ordered another one anyway.
Cas restrained himself from shouting at him. It wouldn’t do any good with the state of mind his brother was in and he knew not a single word would get through to him, so he opted for the simpler route.
Cas shook head, knowing his brother wouldn’t leave him alone about Dean. Part of him didn’t care about what Balthazar thought. The other part of his mind only seemed to care about how Balthazar perceived Dean. Balthazar hadn’t talked to Dean. Didn’t know his character at all, so what right did Balthazar have to judge him?
“Are you going to join me for breakfast or keep staring down at your phone?” Balthazar’s question startled him out of his inner turmoil. He nearly dropped his phone. “Are you still stoned, man?” He heard his brother ask.
Cas’ mind raced. He didn't know what to say. Only a few days ago Dean had bolted out the door, and now here he was talking about being Cas’. The very idea of having Dean all to himself both made his heart beat faster and caused him to wonder if Dean meant what he said.
Dean suddenly felt deflated, all of the anger rushed out of him and curled into the wall separating them.
Cas’ feet started moving to the beat more. He didn’t stop himself from getting up to dance a little. It was slow and not at all very good due to his illness, but even with how his body ached, he’d never felt happier. They continued to sing along together. Dean made him laugh by trying to impersonate Elvis’ voice. Cas didn’t want the song to an end, but alas it had to come to an end and when it did he was sitting on the floor with half his body resting against the wall. He was out of breath and more than tired, but it didn’t matter to him right now.
He set his phone down and looked to the clock that showed he had a few hours left or he could always close up early. It was hitting into the slow hours anyway. His phone gave a buzz and Cas grabbed his phone, pushing away his excitement as just being happy to have a distraction from being bored.
Happy fourth of July! Hope this chapter adds to the celebration. If you like it, please comment. Tell us what you think.
“Stop bullshitting me, Balthazar. Why the hell would Dean bother coming over anyway?” Cas couldn’t help but interrupt. The very idea of Dean wanting to see him sent a thrill through his body before being followed by a churn of his stomach.
Get ready to listen to some classic rock. For this chapter, I recommend listening to Every Rose Has Its Thorn by Poison. It really fits the mood and it is what inspired this scene. I know this chapter was a bit late. I had a bit of trouble getting onto some wifi, but happy belated Christmas! and we hope this chapter brightens your holidays :)
“You can’t talk to him!” Balthazar exclaimed. Had he not been laughing his ass off, maybe Cas would’ve been able to take him seriously. Then again, he was too stoned out of his mind to take anything he said seriously.
. And although Cas wanted to believe that the words were true, he couldn’t find it in himself to accept them as anything less than meaningless words. Part of him felt guilty for thinking that way and the other reminded him of why he was in this room, to begin with. Hadn’t he opened up to Dean just to get shut down? That’s not fair, his rational side spoke up. It wasn’t that Castiel didn’t know this. He was well aware of it being a tad bit selfish to blame this on Dean, and in complete honesty, Castiel laid no blame on him at all. It was on himself, but the thought of Dean also poked and chipped at the barrier. To Cas, no matter the action being selfish, Dean was too much of a reminder of what happened last night and he wasn’t ready to face those memories.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter :) I know it's been a while since the last update, however, I do hope this chapter was was worth the wait. Please comment below and let us know what your thoughts are on this latest chapter or hit that kudos button. Thank you so much for reading!
“Couldn’t imagine living on the streets... That’s so fucked up, two years isn’t long enough for something like that. God, I’m sorry Dean. He’s an asshole for what he did.”
There were a few more meaningless details exchanged and that was it. There was something grim about how quickly everything can be handled after a death. The whole process was set up for maximum efficiency so there was room for the corpses that would surely come the next day.
“I knew you’d come to your senses.” Castiel let himself be lead outside to Jorge’s car. The frigid, chilly air did little to snap Cas out of his drunken haze. He clung to Jorge tightly, due to the fact that his feet refused to walk in a straight line. They made it to Jorge’s faded black Prius. Cas nearly falling to the ground when Jorge removed his arm that had been wrapped around him, to open the passenger car door.
He got the sleeping bag, made himself as comfortable as possible and fell into an easy sleep. He wouldn’t remember what his dreams contained when he woke up the following morning but thoughts of Dean were ever present.
“You know that you’re pervier than Dean, right?” Somehow this felt like a justifiable response. It had sounded a lot better in Castiel’s head.
What seemed like a lifetime later, he and Cas made their way to his bedroom. Dean’s heart was pounding in his ears, pounding so hard his hands were shaking. He had never done this before and he was scared to screw it up. He didn’t want it to be fumbling and awkward. He’d read and read about it, learning the best techniques and everything, but he didn’t want to hurt Cas.
“God, Cas, why can’t you just wake up, baby? Why’d you have to go and crash your car? You weren’t even supposed to be home for a week!”
Cas complied. Though they kept it more chaste this time, it lasted for several seconds. Dean was sure he must have imagined the look of want on Cas’s face—either that or the angel had become a much better actor than he’d been before. Either way, Dean enjoyed the kiss and looked forward to having at least one more of them when they saw Gavin again for whatever reason. He was going to get as much out of this charade as he could. It might be the only way he’d ever get what he truly wanted, after all.
“Cas did all the hard stuff. I just held what he said and hammered when he told me to. He did all the sawing and measuring and sanding and everything. Looks great, though, right?” Sam asked.
When Dean didn’t answer immediately, instead choosing to stare at Cas with wide eyes that were half aroused and half terrified, Cas inched closer. “If you don’t want this,” he whispered, “Then you need to stop me. Otherwise,” he said, only a hair’s breadth from Dean’s lips, “My tongue is about to sweep through your mouth and make me forget where we are for a minute.” His voice was barely audible.
Dean, that funny feeling turning squirmy inside him at the idea of Cas being called his sibling, yelled, “He’s
“Thanks, but I’ll wash my own underwear, man,” Dean said with a smile to show he appreciated the offer. “Anyway, I need to learn how to do it for next week when you’re not doing chores or whatever, right?”
Before he was ready, he was done with the barn and headed for Mr. Davidson’s wagon. Jacob Davidson was waiting for him there. They were meeting the Englisher at the far gate, by the road, rather than in the village itself. Castiel didn’t know what to expect. He’d met one or two of the English teens who had come here before, but neither of them had the same history of misbehavior as this one did.
“No, we are allowed to read about the world. Just because we choose to live outside it, that does not mean we are ignorant of it.” Castiel thought perhaps he sounded defensive. He was not offended by Dean’s question, he was simply blunt by nature. “I can understand why you would be confused. I know that your movies and television portray us differently than we are.”
“No, I mean, Henrickson is straight. Moriarty was bi like me. So, how about you, Castiel? Which team or teams you play for?”
“No, we have a special system. The kitchen staff is paid for by money made by selling the food and goods we make here. The food is provided by all the farms equally.” Cas pointed toward the line and Dean stepped that direction.
“Sure, no problem. He was kinda clueless. I’m curious, though. If you’re straight, why are you in a male strip club?”
Cas rolled a fat joint, lit it and took a deep drag. He didn’t have any appointments today, so he figured it was a good time to indulge in nature’s memory-blocker. He’d had too many weird visions lately. Too much bad juju going on in his head. He hadn’t had sex in months, either. Neither of those things made for a happy Cas.
Evidently, that was exactly what Cas needed to hear in that moment. He surged forward and kissed Dean, and, though it felt more like gratitude than intent, it soon became a lot more heated than it had begun.
“No, I don’t think you really do. It’s not just a word, it’s part of who he is. It’s his whole life.”
Cas and Dean avoided eye contact for a full minute and then had a staring contest for another two. Finally, Dean sighed and grabbed Cas’s shoulder, pushing him toward a chair as he himself sat down.
Vaguely concerned, Castiel knocked and called Dean’s name. When Dean did not immediately answer, Castiel started to worry, but calmed himself with the idea that Dean might have simply fallen asleep, unused to the rigorous activities of the day or he might be washing his hair. He called Dean’s name again and heard a splash this time.
“Whoa, hey, no, man. Yeah, okay, I was borrowing your internet when I first got here, but I haven’t done that in weeks, okay?”
. He would have gladly stood their for hours, though he would eventually have felt guilty for Cas’s poor knees, which had already withstood more floor time than they should’ve.
“We normally bathe about once a week, but you may take a bath as often as you’d like,” he told Dean as they made their way back to the dormitories.
Dean looked at him in shock. “Dude, how do you know all this shit? Are you some famous survival guru or something?”
“Yep!” Dean said, ruffling Sam’s hair affectionately. Today wasn’t a fighting and annoying your brother kind of day.
“He was angry when I first came back, and we did not part well. Then I was forced to marry and the first year I was too busy keeping up the pretense and working harder than ever as a kind of penance for what I saw as my sins.” Jacob shook his head. “Do not think that I rejoiced when I lost my wife. She was a dear friend and I had looked forward to fatherhood just as most men here do. I mourned her death and the child’s deeply.”
Obviously moved, Jacob’s “Thank you, Castiel,” was very gruff. They sat in silence for a few minutes and then he said, “I’m thinking of leaving the village, too.”
Dean kind of thought he must be hallucinating when Cas brought out the next thing. No matter how many times he blinked, though, there was still a burger sitting in front of him.
Cas looked confused for a moment before her face cleared. “Oh! Oh, yes. I also get you diva cup, just in case you want to try to save planet.”
When the food was mostly gone and all the presents opened, Castiel insisted on helping Bobby clean up. Dean and Sam were volunteered by Bobby instead. So Cas sat on the couch with Bobby and watched the brothers bicker good naturedly. His brother was still working on a huge slice of cake and Bobby was nursing a beer. He realized for the first time as he sat there among them that these people were his family.
For a split second Dean looked disappointed, but it passed so quickly, Cas thought he must certainly have imagined it.
Cas had once again found his prostate. This time, with his cock trapped between their bodies, Dean couldn’t stop himself from coming. He barely had time to yell out a choked, “Cas!” before the feeling swept through him, curling his toes and bowing his back and spurting hot fluid all over his belly.
"You're... oh, god. You're actually wearing chaps!" Dean looked up at Cas in awe. "Goddamn, I love you."
The rest of dinner went well, with Sam out of his shell and talking more freely. The interplay between the brothers only became more fluid as well. Castiel was caught up in it, like he was in any other subject that intrigued him. He wanted to study them, learn everything there was to know about them. Dean, of course, in particular he wanted to know more about.
Cas rolled his eyes and huffed. “I use an orange tree chew stick to brush my teeth everyday and I chew mint leaves because I like the taste.”
"Fuck me, Cas. Please!" He didn't care how needy and desperate he sounded. He wanted Cas and he wanted him now.
The single life was not encouraged in his clan, but neither was it forbidden. He had expressed to his guardians—his parents having died long ago in a flood—his lack of desire for marriage and they had been supportive. Mam and Pap Shurley had told him not to worry. They’d said he might yet change his mind, but even if he didn’t, he need not take a wife if wife he did not want. He’d been so grateful.
, at least not as far as Cas was concerned. As far as Dean was concerned the place belonged to Cas from the moment he first stepped into it and filled it up with his presence, but Cas didn't see it that way.
“All right, Cass, spill,” she said as she turned off the ignition. She turned in her seat to give Cass her full attention.
“That’s sexist, Sam.” Maybe that would derail him long enough for them to get around to the point of Sam’s call.
Dean looked contemplative. “Maybe partly? Mostly, by that point, I was used to living on my own and not having rules and I was mad at everyone. Sam was at the Campbell’s... wait. We’re getting ahead. Let me go straight through, okay?” Cas nodded. “Um, it took about 6 months for me to get busted the first time. We had found this awesome abandoned house way outside town, nothing around for miles, and there were old bikes in the shed, too, so we could get into town.”
Mary smiled. “Well, that’s nice of you. Castiel, I hope the boys are making you feel welcome. I know it will take some getting used to, but this is your home now, if you want it.”
Cas sighed. “This is only a theory, but…well, I’ve been reading up on adoption among the English because of your situation. I wanted to learn all that I could.” Cas looked like he was about to explain further, but then shook his head. “I have read that once a child reaches a certain age, they have a say in whether or not an adoption continues. Just as adoptive parents can reject the child, the child can reject to be adopted by the parents. I do not know if their adoption is finalized, but even so, I think that Sam could opt not to be their ward anymore.”
He felt bad for how he phrased his message, however, he was still terribly upset and shaken from the fight he’d gotten in with Balthazar. He was still pushing away memories from the night with Jorge, but some still managed to get through and he could remember the malicious gleam in Jorge’s dark eyes as he stalked towards him with a belt in his right hand. His body shook and he nearly screamed when a car backfired and broke him out his daze. Going home no longer seemed like such a bad idea. His phone buzzed again and Cas looked down expecting to see it be another text from Dean, but it was just Balthazar calling him. He let it go to voicemail and went on walking down the sidewalk.
Hey, we're back! A big thank you to all who have stuck with us and continued reading our story throughout the years. Hope you enjoy this chapter!
Thinking of someone else making passes at Dean left a sour taste in the back Cas’ mouth. He didn’t like it but amounted his feelings up to it just being because the girl was being rude. Cas didn’t even have a reason to be jealous. So why was that sourness still there?
Dean did a half chuckle, wondering what the hell Cas was talking about. It was probably best not to know anyway.
Samson was sitting on the couch blissfully unaware, eating a microwaved breakfast burrito and watching Scoobydoo. These were the last moments, Dean thought, that Samson was going live in a world where he still had a father.
“Alright, we’re going to need to send the remains to a funeral home for cremation in that case, do you have a preference for where you would like that to be?”
“He was right,” Cas gasped out. He’d made himself vulnerable to Dean and he’d left him. Hadn’t wanted to deal with his sorry ass anymore. Cas had known all along that Dean hadn’t truly wanted to be friends with him. That Dean had only talked to him out of obligation and pity, but Cas had hoped that he was wrong. That Dean might’ve felt something for him too. Now he’d run out on him. Castiel wiped the tears away with the back of his hand. His body shaking terribly as if he’d been dunked into the Atlantic ocean. One clear thought passed through his mind. He could go to the bar and drink away his problems. Go to a bar and forcefully make himself forget about Dean.
it. What Castiel had seen on Dean’s face was arousal. Arousal that Castiel himself felt also in watching. And remembering.
She didn’t delay return to her post a second longer than she needed to, slicking up her fingers and going back to work with her mouth. She waited until Cass was writhing again before slipping her fingers inside, moaning slightly at the wet velvet feeling of being inside Cass for the first time.
He and Sam had been having this same non-conversation for the past half hour. He would tell Sam to leave it alone and Sam would start again with another reason, another argument. They were talking about Cas, of course. What else? Sam was a smart kid and he knew his brother. Dean wasn’t exactly shocked that he could see how much closer they were now.
“I’d like that, ma’am. I’m sure Sammy will, too.” He smiled at her and then at her husband, who squeezed Castiel’s arm gently before reaching out to shake Dean’s hand.
“Dean, is Cas okay?” Sam asked in a small voice as soon as Cas’ bedroom door was closed. “He seemed bummed at the store and now he’s napping? That’s weird, right?”
He twitched slightly as he came fully awake and realized it was morning—and he had not been dreaming. Dean really was rubbing himself with Cas’s hand and rocking back against Cas’s dick.
Castiel hummed and licked little circles around Dean's rim. The little whimpers Dean was making were like the world's sexiest symphony. He swirled and swiped his tongue in all the ways he knew to make a person weak, and he felt Dean relaxing as a reward for his diligence. The sounds grew more frequent, more desperate, and Cas knew Dean was probably ready for a finger.
On the fourth floor, they walked down to unit 17 and Dean took a deep breath. “All right, here goes nothing,” he said as he opened the door.
“Oh. Okay. Yeah, I’ll do that.” Dean made ready to leave, but Cas stopped him with a hand on his elbow.
The song stopped and he heard a ring. Another one. He didn’t want to look at his phone, he knew who it could be. Holding his breath, he checked anyway. John. Ring. He shouldn’t answer it. John has been out of his life for eight years now, and there was no reason to bring him back in. Ring. Maybe he should answer, just to see what he has to say. It can’t hurt, and if something happens he can just end their relationship again. Ring.
Cas looked up momentarily to see his brother’s look of distaste. His brows furrowed further when Castiel looked down towards his phone.
It was only a few seconds after Cas released the smoke he’d been holding down in his lungs that he began coughing. His throat burned dully with each grating cough that couldn’t be contained and his eyes started to water with the force of his hacking.
He took both objects out of his brother’s hand while mumbling, “Just one hit and then I want you to tell me exactly why you gave out my information to Dean.”
“How dare you fucking throw that in my face! I didn’t get trapped there on my own free will. I didn’t choose to be beaten to hell. I don’t need you to remind me of what happened! All you talk about is how it affected
Dean's mind drifted back to the image of John’s black gremlin parked in front of the house. He thought it was a piece of trash at the time, and apparently, he was right because it had done nothing to prevent John’s brain from ejecting out of his skull.
, Cas thought. How was he supposed to respond? How would anyone respond this? He kept going over possible responses in his mind and even attempted to type out some of them, but all of them came out sounding lame. A simple ‘okay’ wasn’t something that someone would text back. ‘Hey, no worries, I’m an idiot for even saying anything’ Just didn’t seem like the best answer either.
His phone vibrated, breaking Cas out his little dream. He glared grumpily at the screen, waiting for it to come on and show him who had messaged him. He had missed a call from Balthazar, must’ve happened when he was cleaning, and the newest notification showed a text from Dean. He didn’t let himself give any thought as to why he immediately grinned just from seeing his name appear. He read over the message.
“I missed you too. I’m sorry for how I acted. That wasn’t how I wanted things to go when I got home. All I could think about when walking here was what I was going to say to you, and I completely messed it up by reverting back into a brat. I did like that song that you were singing though. I’ve heard it played on the radio once or twice.”
Dean got up and stretched out his limbs, trying to work out the stiffness of the night. In the moments in between being asleep and being fully awake, he almost forgot the night before. Just as he was about to head to the bar to meet Eric, Viv, and Stacy he got a call from his father. Really he knew it was ridiculous, but talking to his dad, no, not his dad, John still triggered something in him. Every time he heard his voice images of screaming and drunken fights washup to the forefront of his mind.
Thank you all so much for reading! I hope you've enjoyed this newest chapter and as always feel free to comment and let us know what you thought. My co-writer and I had a lot of fun writing the last conversation between Dean and Cas before the chapter ended, so we hope you guys got some laughs out of it too :)
Cas bit his lip as he instantly thought about McHotpants. Lord, did he really want to start describing him to Dean? He hadn’t really scored away his feelings for Dean yet. They were up in the air for all he knew. Still, he almost felt guilty for having thoughts about the guy and talking about it with Dean. It was silly of him, he knew, but it was difficult to describe exactly why it made him feel that way. He got on with it, though. What harm could it do?
“I’d rather the accent. I don’t share all that well,” Cas said, thinking to himself that if he ever did get to see Dean in person he would die of embarrassment.
Cas steadied himself, locked up his mailbox, and turned around not at all expecting for his eyes to get immediately drawn to the man that stood a mere few feet away from him. Their gazes locked, as the other man had been already looking at him when Cas had turned around. He didn’t know what to do. His cheeks became warmer when the guy gave him a look over, a sexy grin playing on his lips when he returned his focus onto Cas’ face.
Jorge let Castiel lean against the hood of the Prius, as he locked up the car. Cas resisted the urge to sleep, even as his eyelids grew unbearably heavy. He felt a bony arm wrap around his upper torso once more. Saw the blurry view of the grey sidewalk under his feet. Cas leaned into Jorge’s side but immediately felt repulsed. Jorge smelt of cheap cigars and beer. The two scents mixed together to make one overwhelming smell that reminded Cas distinctly of spoiled, sour milk.
In the morning, Cas woke up to the smell of bacon and coffee being made, and a stiff pain on his lower side. It was another chore of shifting onto his back with grunts to accommodate his movements. As he huffed in relief when weight was finally off his side and his body sagged more onto the bean bag, the back of his hand bumped against his phone that was starting to slip down behind his back. Reaching for it, he took care to move slowly to save himself from more pain, while also trying to remember the last thing he did last night. A passing thought on smudges was the last memory he could manage to pull up.
real name and have it be another thing to shake the wall in his mind. Having interaction with Dean was doing enough damage as it was.
Balthazar merely laughed at him. Not at all holding back his teasing comments as Cas reached for the bottle of Mountain Dew and took a heavy drink off of it. Meanwhile, Balthazar picked up the bong from where Castiel had placed it once he’d started coughing, and lit up for another hit. Taking in the smoke with ease and blowing out the smoke without the slightest hint of a cough. Cas could see his smug smirk out of the corner of his eye.
His mind drifted to Samson giggling and climbing over the play equipment with the other kids. Maybe he needs to let the past be the past. This John was not the same John that got into the accident. He wasn’t the same man who let his anger stalk the halls like a hungry wolf looking for any life to consume and who drank to try to fill in the gaps in its stomach.
Dean shook his head. He knew Brian would be late again tomorrow. “You know, Frankie came in early today.” The good old manager trick of pitting employees against each other.
“Yeah, I uh, I decided that being home was the best place for me right now. Plus, I need to get back to a routine, you know, and to start working at the flower shop again.”
Cas shivered, a chill going up his spine at the idea of being corrupted to anything by Dean. His mind carried on with how exactly Dean would corrupt him with classic rock. Right about now he’d be okay with snuggling on the couch with Dean listening to one of the band's he liked. It’d be even better if Dean, by chance, looked like Hottie McHotpants.
After a bit of thinking on how to word out his response without coming off too hostile, Cas typed out,
“I would still lo- I would still care for you even if you were blind and brain damaged. You’ve become a very good friend to me, Dean. That’s what I was going to say. You’re the one that pulled me back out of a dark place,” Cas couldn’t control the words spewing out of his mouth. It wasn’t that he was lying. It was the mere fact that Cas hadn’t meant to make himself so vulnerable. He had only meant to tell Dean that he was a good friend, and fuck, Cas nearly told Dean that he loved him. Cas didn’t know if that bit was true. He’d only just started talking to Dean, and they hadn't even seen each other face to face. But I do care for him, Cas thought. He knew that to be true, but….but what? He sat there in a whirl of emotions, trying desperately to place a finger on what exactly he was feeling and how he felt about Dean. Maybe it's because of how much he's helped me. It's simply gratitude I’m feeling, He worked this thought around in his head. It seemed to fit. It was only natural after all, especially since Dean was the one that had sat down and listened to him. No one had done that. He’d only meant to express his gratefulness.
I know it was a long wait for this chapter but I hope you guys find that it was worth it :) Check out sapphic_writer, she writes awesome Supernatural fanfiction and she has one up right now that is fantastic. I highly recommend it for you destiel readers. She has significantly helped write this story, it would not be what it is now without her. She, in fact, helped with many ideas in this chapter including Balthazar's 'stoner' room. We both had a laugh about that one when creating it. We hope you enjoyed this chapter and please feel free to comment and let us know what you think.
There was a pause on the other side of the wall. Dean crawled onto his creaking bed and pressed his ear to the cool plaster of the wall.
Dean got up from the bed and grabbed his phone. He plugged in the speakers and started blasting Let’s Put the X in Sex.
Cas tried to fight back a blush and kept his head down as he made his way over to his plate. He didn’t have to look up to know that his brother was frowning.
“Just replacing the timing belt.” He thought that maybe just this once she would take the hint and leave him alone. No such luck.
The call was casual, too casual. The woman on the other end of the line had obviously been doing this too long to get emotional about it now. This was just another day for her and he was just another family member caught in the crossfire of someone else’s fuckup
Cas forced himself to search for his keys, letting out pitiful noises that could only be made by someone who was getting sick. He found them in the pockets of a pair of jeans that were strewn across the floor. It was 8:00 am. Already Cas felt like he’d done a day’s work and the fire in his throat raged on. He started noticing how his nose was becoming congested. His body ached whether standing or moving. He felt downright miserable and a bit pathetic.
“Yeah right. Put me in a pair of heels along with those panties and I could rock that better than anyone, but I wouldn’t be against seeing you in some lace.” Cas grinned smugly to himself while he heard Dean’s nervous laughter.
Cas just smiled shyly and said nothing until they were finished drinking. “Everything is gone from the icebox?”
“Ah. Well, I can understand your concern, certainly. However, I can assure you that I would never let our personal relationship interfere with our working relationship—or vice versa. I am very good at compartmentalizing.” He moved closer again, reaching over to stroke Dean’s fingers where they still rested on his arm.
Too late he remembered the eggs, but there was nothing to be done about it. All he wanted was to jump up and down on kale to vent his rage, so he yanked one bagged bunch of it out of the sack and threw it down in front of his feet.
Cas said it from far closer than Dean was expecting and having those words said so close to his ear almost gave away the game right there. Dean had to think about that time he’d walked in on Sam in a compromising position to will his dick not to rise and give him away. It worked like a charm and he was able to yank down his skivvies and turn around.
Cas was staring at Dean now, blue eyes wide with something Dean couldn’t name, but it looked like shock and something else. Shit, had he said any of that hot stuff out loud?
Still, as he rolled out dough for pie and made small talk with the kitchen staff, he wondered if he could handle doing some volunteer work at the hospital. He’d like the helping aspect of the visiting, as well. He thought maybe he would enjoy visiting sick people in the city, too. The pie making got busier and his mind became occupied with making sure he was measuring properly.
Dean tried to get more out of him, all the way to the motel, but he remained silent. When they finally got to the room, Cas spotted the whiskey right away and made a beeline for it. He opened the bottle and took a swig before Dean even managed to get the door closed. Cas immediately started spluttering.
Cas looked confused for a minute, eyebrows pinching together in a way that was adorable, but then the lines smoothed out. “Oh. I believe it is a mutual feeling. You’re not worried?”
Cas stepped closer, gaze scanning Dean’s face. “Dean? Do you—did you mean that? You... you love me?”
The three retreat personnel eyed the cake slice warily. Mortie was again the first to taste it. He immediately made a face.
“It’s great, man. I like how that feels.” Dean shivered as they skittering down his spine. “That tickles, but I like it.” One feather brushed the crack of his ass and he made a distinctly yip-like noise in response. “Dude, warn a guy!”
“Aw shi-oot, I forgot to ask him,” Dean said, patently ignoring Cas’ smirk at his near slip-up. “But he was cool with me getting my own place and he knows I can’t do that on my own, so I don’t think it’s a problem. I’ll call him back tomorrow to make sure, though, okay?”
Dean thought the whole thing was ridiculous, so he wasn’t quite sure why he was actually doing as Mortie asked. Then he lost concentration and felt his arousal at this naked proximity to Cas building and that got him re-focused on the task at hand in a hurry.
Dean, moving more on instinct than any practical experience, wrapped his hand around both their erections. He stroked them together and he thought his brain was going to go offline, it felt so good. The pair of them were making noises that neither had made before.
“Dude, she was totally hitting on you,” he broke in at one point, laughing—and not at all, even remotely, jealous.
“Dean!” Cas shouted into the phone. “Dean, we have a situation. I need you to come back to the bunker as soon as possible!”
Cas backed them toward the bed and then flopped backwards as he pulled away from Dean. “Then you should get undressed for me.”
“Then I will take you there with my wagon, as well, if you like, as I must go beyond there,” Jacob offered.
“G’night, Cas,” Dean said in a low voice that crackled with emotion. It was not showing on his face, however.
Dean wanted to believe him, but, like Cas himself had pointed out, they held control over Sam. They may as well have the kill switch to his beating heart. With one simple action, they could ruin his life as surely as stabbing him in the chest would do. Then he noticed that Cas looked apprehensive, like he was nervous about saying something else.
Despite his haste to begin, Cas’ muscles were tense under Dean’s. Dean pressed gentle kisses to Cas’ lips over and over again, while stroking up and down his side. He felt Cas relax beneath him again. Then he pulled back to stare down into those blue eyes.
Dean’s smile was huge. “Yeah, Cas. I’d really, really like that.” His smile faltered. “People might mess with us, I don’t know,” he warned.
If asked, he'd have denied he was trembling inside by the time he pulled up at Cas's house, but he felt like his insides were vibrating. He didn't remotely approve of his body choosing to give in to its Omega instincts, and he sure as hell didn't understand why it had chosen now to do it, but he couldn't really deny that he was enjoying it, just a little bit. Cas did things to him that literally no one had ever made him feel before.
They’d been kissing for about 10 minutes when Dean felt Cas’ hand slide under his shirt. It was a shock of the best kind. Up to this point, Dean had always been the one who pushed things farther. Cas’ hands would roam, but never over an erogenous zone and never, ever under the clothing.
Cas had been unprepared for what the sound of Dean saying his name could do to him while he was in a vulnerable, aroused state. The instant Dean had called out to him, Castiel’s orgasm had swept through him, unexpected and intense. He struggled to keep silent, though he wanted to yell out with the power of it. However, when it was over, it was obvious Dean was already long gone. Cas had called his name just in case, but there was no response. Castiel hadn’t even heard what he’d said after “Cas”, so he hoped it wasn’t important.
He’d said all these things before. To Cas. To Sam. To himself in the empty bedroom where he was supposed to sleep next to his best friend until... well, now, he guessed. Until death. And Cas was dying.
“Dean, if I don’t pass this math test, my parents are going to ship me to boarding school for the rest of senior year and then we won’t be able to talk about anything except on the phone or Skype.”
“I’m gonna stay here and look around,” Sam told them. “Maybe catch a talk. I’ll have my phone if you need me.”
"Don't think you do get it, Cas." Dean reached out and put a hand on Cas's arm when Cas tried to stand. "I never got over you either. And if you're moving back here, and you're willing, I'd really like for us to try dating again. Now that we've both had therapy and at least one more adult relationship each. Now that we've grown up into what I think are better people with stronger self-esteem. I'd like to try again and see what happens."
It wasn't about control at all. Not with Dean. With Dean, Cas just wanted to know Dean was as crazy with wanting Castiel as Cas himself was with wanting Dean—even if he had to cheat a little bit to make that happen.
“Okay, well, maybe there’s a less supernatural way to figure this out. I mean, you still want to know for sure, right?”
Dean gave Sam his flattest, most “you’re a fucking idiot” look. “Sam, you really think I could’ve been a homophobic douchecanoe
Dean barely felt the stretch. Cas’s fingers kept hitting the sweet spot and taking him to a higher place, where he was no thought and all sensation. He’d though that place was a myth, regardless of how great sex had been in the past.
“So the territory is not entirely uncharted for you, then?” Cas asked, and seemed more curious than anything.
Dean felt his heart start to pound as the patrol car started to slow down to pull into the drive. He could see a wagon parked there and two people—in the clothes he associated with the few Amish he’d seen—sitting in the front of it.
Dean decided not to press him on it. The guy was entitled to his secrets, after all. “Nah. Well, actually, how do I wash the clothes? I should probably do that, after supper and the milking and everything.”
“Still wonder if I’m sure?” Cass asked, taking Deanna’s hand and rubbing the middle finger of it against the prominent nub inside her panties.
“Hey there, sugar, what can I get for ya?” She motioned toward their table, where Dean still sat, with an upwards nod. “Aside from the love of a fair not-so-maiden,” she said with a knowing wink.
“It was great, all of it, until my parents found out about him,” one young man said. “They weren’t going to shun me until I slipped up and told them.”
Dean denied the twist of jealousy that burned in his gut at the thought, but he couldn’t stop his mouth from reacting on his behalf. “Dude, stereotyping much? They’ll think you’re trying too hard and make you in the first ten minutes.” He looked at Cas. “No dude, straight or gay, could be that into yoga.” Dean didn’t actually believe that at all, but if it meant that he and Cas got to pretend to be a couple instead of Sam and Cas, he’d say almost anything.
“Well, okay. I mean, if that’s how you want it to be, whambamthanksma’am, you know, I won’t fight you, but, I was kind of thinking maybe we could do that again sometime.”
Jacob smiled his tiny smile and led them out to the waiting cab. Once inside it, he handed Dean his cell phone with another of those smiles. The thing had long since lost its charge, but for Dean it made the end of his time in Amish country real in a way not even the judge’s verdict had done. He felt more of a pang than he’d expected – and not just because of Cas.
“Well, I’ll tell you, Cas, as somebody who once turned a bendy weekend into a two year relationship, I can testify to one thing. Humans can convince ourselves of whatever we need to in order to get by.” Dean took a deep breath. “You deserve to do more than just get by. You deserve to be happy.”
This was not the story I intended to deliver today, but it got away from me and wasn't going to be finished, so instead, have a story that's almost entirely smut.
Dean spotted Ben in the hallway about to leave with his friends. “Don’t forget to call if you’re gonna be later than eleven.”
He heard Sam call out a goodbye and he headed out the door. He patted Baby’s hood as he walked past, wishing—and not for the first time—that she was a little easier on gas.
Dean had trouble catching his breath, but he finally managed to say, “Yeah, Mom. Stopping hitting on the guy I’m in love with.” Cas’s look of surprised joy gave him the strength to continue. “And in front of your husband too. You should be ashamed.”
It was different, kissing in private. For one thing, they held eye contact as their faces moved toward each other. There was more hesitation as well, on both sides, and Cas could for the first time see a mix of fear, excitement and awe on Dean’s face. Hope sprung up in Cas’s chest at the sight. Maybe Dean did return his feelings, he thought.
“Get a room!” Jess shouted as she and Sam came walking up the sidewalk. She was grinning from ear to ear.
“Hey, Cas. Um, Bobby wants to take me to see some land my parents kinda left me. You wanna go with us?”
“Yeah, man, sorry, we got sent straight to class and then we had, uh, l-lessons.” Dean ignored the frown Cas sent his way. “We haven’t heard anything useful yet, except one guy said the lights flickered before a couple left early.”
“Fuck.” Dean finished the rest of his beer. “I might have to crash at your place for a few days after I talk to her. That gonna be okay?”
“I’m not sure. The bartender called it ‘Aphrodite’s Clitoris’ I think, but she could’ve just been fucking with me.”
He took his time, tasting and teasing with tongue and lips and fingers. He reveled in the gasps and breathy sounds he earned with his ministrations.The head of Cas’ cock slipped just past where it was comfortable and Dean swallowed automatically, earning another groan from Cas, as deep and throaty as the blowjob itself.
He pulled off the virtual reality goggles and blinked as reality—which was a dirty back room of a seedy bar—resolved itself around him. He never seemed to get past the spanking. He always spent too long on the build up. How much money had he wasted on this fantasy so far? he wondered. Too much. He needed to give it up.
“Five? I think five sounds about right.” Cas barely got the last word out before he closed their mouths together again. Five kisses later, he said, “I guess it’s a date, then.”
“Hm. Well, I was going to pay you a hundred thousand dollar yearly salary, but I suppose room and board plus silence is much cheaper,” Cas said. “Best to be frugal, don’t you think, sweetums?”
“I know, I know! No sex before studying. This isn’t for that.” Dean pulled the silk rope out of his pocket.
“Oh, no, I definitely want to have sex with you. But if you have sex with me, I want it to be because you want to and not because I’m bribing you with a favor for your brother.”
“Yes, sir. I was actually in a position perhaps a level or two below your own with a different company for a few years, but with the economy being what it is....” Dean let his voice trail off as he handed over the signature form and a pen.
Dean got a faraway look on his face that Cas couldn’t really interpret. When he didn’t immediately snap out of it, Cas put a hand on his arm.
“He hates everyone. But, yes. The question.” Those green eyes pinned Cas in place, despite his best efforts.
“I don’t mind. I have been given to understand that pepper spray is useful in defending oneself from attackers,” he explained.
“Here, give it,” Dean huffed, amused. He rolled the condom on and pulled Cas back for another kiss. “How was that for you? No pain or anything?” He looked into Cas’s eyes as he asked.
Cas let out a small huff that might have been a laugh. “No, I’m not quite that pathetically hard up for dates, thanks.” He smiled to show he was kidding. Then he sobered and cleared his throat. “No, she felt bad because I got fired this morning.”
Dean rolled his eyes and left the room. When he came back, he had a phone in his hand and he was frowning at the display. When he closed his eyes and looked pained, Cas knew he was correct.
The sink was wide enough that they could stand together to wash their hands. Castiel ignored the strange sensations that he got when their shoulders brushed each other. He concentrated on lathering his hands and upper arms with the homemade soap. When they were all clean and dry again, he asked Dean if he wanted to change his shirt before supper.
Ava turned to Cas with a look that said she thought Cas was long-suffering and patient. “Someone didn’t read much of the brochure, did he?” She turned back to Dean then, just missing the rolling of his eyes. “A sleep counselor comes into your room at bedtime, to give you some cuddling instructions and make sure you’re maximizing your intimacy. Don’t worry. He won’t stay all night. Just about twenty minutes.” She nudged Dean with her shoulder. “Then you can get down to whatever intimacy you want with your handsome partner here.”
“Well, that’s enough chit-chat, you crazy kids, some of us have work to do!” Gabriel scurried back to the store’s office, out of sight.
“I, um... I gotta... go to the, um... figure out what to... and you just... wait here,” Dean stammered, practically stepping on his own feet in his haste to vacate the counter area.
“You looked so beautiful on that bed, Dean.” He said it softly, so as not to spook Dean. “I’ve rarely seen anything sexier than you looked pleasuring yourself like that.”
He considered calling Sam back, but decided against it. He also considered downing a whole bottle of whiskey like the old days, but ever since Benny had become a counselor it just didn’t seem right. He could go to a bar, pick up someone to fuck his mind off things, but that hadn’t been his style in a long time either.
Dean winced. “Yeah, I, uh, I don’t really like Charlie’s friend Dorothy? So I kinda... lied to spare their feelings.” He didn’t like lying to Charlie, but he really,
He thought he might need to distance himself for a while. He needed to clear his head. He might be wrong about what he was feeling or it might just be the newness of having a person interact with him so closely. He had never really had a friend before. Perhaps it was merely affection he was feeling.
Then he pulled back and looked searchingly into those electric blue eyes. “You mean it, Cas? You’re staying?” He knew his voice was breathy and a little broken, but he didn’t care.
“Yeah, all right, fair enough.” He blew out a breath. “So, do we tell anyone? Or keep it to ourselves? I mean, mom knows how
There was a moment of silence from beyond the door. “I just wanted to make sure you were all right.” He seemed to start to say more, but then stopped.
Dean was headed to answer the door for the delivery person. His new box of porn and sex toys was arriving and he was so excited he couldn’t wait to try them all out. Then a voice called to him from the bedroom.
Cas sat in the back of the courtroom and listened proudly as well-deserved praise was heaped on Dean’s head. He watched Dean with a swell of emotions almost as strong as the night before. Today had come at last and Dean had even thought to apologize to those he’d wronged. Cas was incredibly moved by his accomplishments. He had never met the angry Dean, but he’d heard about him enough to know what a transformation this truly was.
"Well, actually, I did. I was going to surprise you and then ask," Dean said, turning off his phone as he reached Cas's spot on the sofa. He really was wearing a suit. "But then I had a better idea." He smiled sweetly and dropped to his knees and held out a jewelry box with a small white gold band. "But maybe I should ask again, now that Steve gave his blessing. Cas, will you marry me?"
Castiel started walking toward the dormitory and motioned Dean to follow him. “You will be working with us and learning our customs. You will be given more appropriate clothes to wear and you will be assigned a list of chores and tasks to complete every day.”
“I found myself standing there in that store, looking for domestic items and… I found myself wishing that I did not have to go.” He held up a hand, as though to stop Dean from reminding him of the obvious fact that going was his own choice.
He was jerked out of his misery, however, when he realized that his boxer briefs were... not clean. In fact, he would say there were kind of...
“Well, I’m actually doing what I normally do, but you think very loudly, so I’m still getting some of it. I can try harder, but you should know, it may affect my sexual skills.”
Then Cas’ eyes flicked, just for the briefest second, to Dean’s hand on his shoulder and Dean realized, all at once. It wasn’t just the girls now. It was Dean touching him that was a problem. Yeah, so, probably asexual. He removed his hand immediately. Dean wouldn’t be Dean if he didn’t feel a little hurt at the sort-of rejection. Still, Cas had allowed hugs and other physical touches, so Dean thought it was probably just the prolonged contact that was a problem.
Since it was time for Dad’s procedural cop show that Dean wasn’t allowed to watch, he and Cas were relegated back to their room. Mary had put Castiel’s things away while they played outside, so he had his own drawers in the dresser and his own space in the closet.
The problem came a few minutes later, when they both declared that they were getting sleepy and it was time to air up the mattress so Cas could sleep. The first problem was that it took half an hour to find the box with the mattress in it. By the time they had actually removed it from the closet, Dean’s whiskey had brought him to a state of inebriation not conducive to reading instructions.
Cas nodded. “My job means nothing to me. I’ve got some money saved to live on until I find a new job. And my house can easily be sold. Or I can rent it out for steady income. I can stay with you, Dean. I want to stay with you. I’m
Dean finished his pie as memories flooded through his brain. It was several minutes before he spoke again, but Cas just finished his own pie and said nothing. “Then Sam begged me to stop. He said he’d talked to the Campbells and they would take me in if I’d promise to behave.”
So they watched some TV and joked around with Sam until Bobby arrived and they put the table in and added the coasters to it. The stone looked great on the wood just like Dean had suspected.
“We’re in luck, come on. You go first and then I’ll go. When you get through, go straight into the woods and don’t—”
“It’s a pie, Dean. Would I bring pie that wasn’t for you? I like my face the way it is.” She was smirking the whole time she talked.
,” Charlie said with a grin, dragging out the name. “Xena, huh? Nice.” She gave Dean a look over Cas’s head which said, “I might be a lesbian, but even I know this man is super hot. And not even because he’s dressed like a hot chick.”
Dean’s smile was slow and triumphant. “Oh, you like that idea, don’t you, Castiel?” He was practically purring. “Liked watching me get slapped into these cuffs too, huh?” He leaned forward again. “So, how about it? Wanna spank me a little? See if I talk?”
He was a little scared of how much he had grown to need those little touches. Hugs, hands sliding down backs, and little shoulder squeezes had all become more important than he could’ve dreamed. They were the highlights of his day, second only to Cas’ smiles and Cas’ kisses. He didn’t know how he’d give it all up when it was time, but he was glad it wasn’t time yet. Right now, he needed those things like he needed air and he couldn’t get home fast enough.
Cas latched onto one of Dean’s nipples, biting softly. Dean had always had sensitive nipples and his back arched now, driving his chest closer to the touch. He keened and writhed as Cas licked and sucked at the hard little peak. Cas removed one of his hands from Dean’s wrists and used it to skim a trail from Dean’s face to his hip as Cas’s mouth continued to torture him with nipple play.
Dean took the statement literally and pulled Cas back in for another kiss. It was nearly 15 minutes later when he forced them apart to get ready for bed. He went to sleep a short time later with a persistent smile on his face.
Castiel would have offered to go with him and hear the news first hand, but he got the impression that Dean wanted to do this alone. So he smiled and nodded and finished his meal before getting up to do the dishes.
“It’s a location on our body where energy concentrates, and each one correlates to specific systems in the body, like the heart Chakra or whatever.” Ed’s eyes flicked to Dean and quickly away, as if worried Dean was going to embarrass him for knowing the answer.
“Actually, I think I have somewhere to stay, but since I lost all the food in my apartment when you turned off the power, could you give me cash for food?”
“So... wait,” Michael said. “The ad said you didn’t drink. What the hell did you do with all those cocktails you took?”
The weather had turned nasty on Castiel’s walk from his office building. A perfect “cherry on the shit sundae” his day had been.
“No, wait. I wanna go down on you first. Straddle my face?” The question, though filthy, was delivered almost shyly.
“You know what? I’m gonna just....” Dean cleared his throat. “Yep. You trust me, I trust you, nobody talks about what happens in their... um... Deal?” Dean asked.
“Would it be possible to have nine of everything?” Cas asked, looking balefully at the very attractive bartender. At least the view would be pleasant.
“I can do my woodcarving as easily here as anywhere else and I’ve nothing else pressing for the day. Besides that, the weather is supposed to turn nasty before too long and I didn’t want you having to walk back in that.” Jacob finally set aside his carving and grabbed the reins.
“I used a spell Rowena gave me and it had... unexpected side effects. Without actually working for its intended purpose.”
Dean was a little disappointed not to hear it back, but he grabbed his socks without another word. When he stood back straight, he was surprised to feel Cas pressed up against him.
“Why did we wait so long to do this?” Cas breathed against his mouth. “We’re so stupid, Dean. Fuck, I love you so much. You have no idea.”
Soon they were seated at their table, with glasses of ice water to occupy their nervous hands and mouths. They didn’t have an easy time making eye contact, so the awkwardness had ratcheted up about twelve notches once they sat down. Cas was just about to say something when Dean beat him to it.
His voice sort of squeaked in the cutest way when he said it and Dean allowed himself a smile, since his face was hidden from Cas’s view.
“That is the dumbest thing anyone has ever said in the history of words,” Cas growled, trying to come forward again.
Dean looked after him, confused. He didn’t know what he had said that had caused Cas to look so stunned, but he hoped it was a good kind of stunned. Shrugging, he grabbed some fresh clothes and made a mental note to ask Cas where—and how—to do the laundry. Looking at the clock, he knew washing the clothes had to wait until after Sam got here.
Cas looked adorably like a deer in headlights. “I had not realized there was a need before, but yes, I can make a table for us. Would you like me to do that, Dean?”
Cas felt his anger begin to deflate as Dean started pacing. “I was hurt, Cas. Heartbroken. And being angry was easier. Hurting you back was easier. So I said the first thing I could think of to hurt you.” His back was to Cas now and his breathing was shaky. “I never intended to follow through with it.”
Not for the first time, Cas questioned whether getting a more traditional voice work job had been the right move, since he could no longer travel with the brothers on their hunts nearly as often. It was a job he enjoyed more, it paid even better than phone sex, and they were now able to afford a small house, so he supposed he had made the correct choice, but had his absence on hunts ultimately driven Dean away?
Dean couldn’t put his finger on it, but Cas was different on the ride to his apartment. Really, since before that, he thought. Asking to come back to Dean’s place was out of character. Normally, one of them would just say, “Let’s go to your apartment” or “We’re going to my place” or something like that. Apparently getting the better of Crowley had done something to Cas. Dean only hoped it was a good thing.
“That’s awesome, Dean! I knew you’d do good, though. I’m proud of you, you know.” This last bit was said more quietly than the rest and Dean knew he meant it.
He started to walk to Cas, but he need not have bothered. Cas was coming to him in a hurry. To Dean’s shock, Cas got right into his space—the way he hadn’t done since the Apocalypse—and took a deep inhale near Dean’s neck.
“Cas, you weren’t kidding. Man, your, uh, guardian makes freaking awesome cheese.” He took another nibble before forking up more pie.
Dean ignored him and instead worked at getting Cas’s arm unstuck. When he was done, the two of them were vary close and nearly holding hands. When Cas realized how close their faces were, he turned toward Dean slightly, suddenly needing to
Sam groaned. “You know, for a genius hunter and an angel with nearly infinite knowledge you two are pretty fucking stupid.” He roared and then huffed. “Okay, look. I’m gonna go try and get Cas back in here because I don’t see how else we’re gonna be able to lift this curse. When I do, you will
Castiel was surprised to find another laugh bubbling up. Dean was ridiculous, but he made an odd kind of sense. His grin was infectious, as well. “Shall we read, then?” was Castiel’s only answer.
Instead of answering, Cas reached up and put his hands exactly where Dean had shown him. He looked into Dean's wide eyes, searching for consent. Dean closed his eyes and leaned in and then those lips were on his again. It was Cas who made a noise this time, a deep, frustrated growl, as if he was angry about how much he liked the kiss.
“Oh, you don’t get along with your folks? That’s too bad. Our mom is awesome,” Sam piped up from the back seat.
“I’m afraid it is. I actually have to get back and prepare for a meeting,” Cas told him with great regret.
Cas forced himself to clarify, “It would only be temporary, Dean. I intend to return to the village at the end of the three months, but if you are willing to agree to those terms, then yes. I would like to kiss you again when we move into the apartment.”
At first, Cas’s predicament had him getting huffy with annoyance at Dean’s levity. It happened to hurt when your arm slammed into someone’s pelvis and also concrete at high speeds. However, seeing Dean laugh—especially in this place and after the year they’d had—it softened Cas’s annoyance into fondness. He decided, however, that some teasing of his own might be in order.
Before Sam could continue, Dean nodded toward where Cas was walking toward the dorm for lunch. “Let’s leave it, okay? He’s on his way back. Help me plate up lunch.”
Everyone else followed suit, finishing loading their plates and digging in. Dean could tell Cas loved the food, and that made him stupidly happy. Of course, there was little about Cas that
Castiel was furious, but he kept his voice level. “I think perhaps a bit longer in the woods will do him good.”
He shaved and then figured the water was hot enough. He ran the tub full and slid in, letting the soreness of the day evaporate into the warm water. He rushed through scrubbing his hair and skin because he wanted to have time to jerk off without taking a super long, Cas-worrying bath again.
Deanna rolled her eyes. “Give it here.” She took the bag from Cas, then set it next to her on the floor. “Thanks, man, I owe you.” She cleared her throat as the staring got awkward. “And as for the, um, suggestion... maybe after my bath?”
He padded into the living room and shuffled to the door. He looked into the peephole, but all he could see was something dark in the way.
He was glad they had handcuffed him to the man by his right arm, rather than his left. It gave him a better shot at reaching the lockpick he kept in his boot. He carefully pulled his foot onto the bench, also grateful they had underestimated him and left his feet free. It took him only seconds to get the pick and no more than a minute to get it angled just perfectly to start working on opening the middle cuffs.
Cas let out a noise that was something like a growl, but he released Dean’s arm from his grip. Dean grinned and kissed him on the forehead, surprising them both. Cas gave him a shy sleepy smile that Dean wanted to keep forever.
Castiel was having no luck with getting over his feelings for Dean and his own mind was betraying him now, offering him all the things he wanted but dared not think about while he was awake – offering it to him while he slept and could not object.
for this ridiculousness. They wrote about there being more practicing kissing fics and this happened.
It didn’t help that there was a party he’d much rather be at. Still, he squared his shoulders, put on his glasses—prop ones made to look like the real ones he still wore at night—and trench coat and went out to play his part.
“Okay, no big thing,” Dean said, nodding. “We just go in like we did with that whole pishtaco deal, right? Get hired on as instructors or something.”
What he heard made his heart pound in his chest. He was unsure if it was fear or exhilaration or something else entirely. All he knew was that his face was flushed and he could not seem to get his breath. Dean never did answer Sam’s question directly, but the answer was there in what he said and did not say.
Victor Henrickson—Castiel’s FBI partner and some time friend—had roughed Winchester up... and Winchester had
He wasn’t the kind interested in small talk, walking away before Dean had even finished speaking. Whatever, he wasn’t here to have more social interaction, right? The guy brought his beer over and Dean spun on the stool slightly as he sipped it, scoping the room. His movement – and his heartbeat – was arrested by the sight of the profile of a Xena cosplayer standing across the room.
Dean nodded and reached for Cas’s cock, drawing another gasp from him. He fastened the snaps on the leather strips firmly in place. Unlike the collar, he tightened the cock ring as tight as it would go. The small harness had the duel effect of keeping Cas from being able to orgasm and also presenting Cas’s testicles front and center for Dean’s enjoyment and whim.
He’d been at Cas’s for about fifteen minutes, and so far all he’d managed to do was piss the guy off more by spilling a glass of wine on his carpet. He’d apologized for
“I would be shunned and lose contact with the Shurleys and with you. I would only be allowed back if I walked away from Dean.” Castiel did not need to ask, he knew the answer. Still, his heart sank at Jacob’s nod.
"No. I mean, I can see how he might come across that way sometimes—and believe me, his views on bisexuality are archaic and I've been working on that—but he's been through a lot and it's just a defense."
“No!” Cas said forcefully. “I find your current state vile and repugnant. However, I am attracted to your body regardless of the state of your soul and I don’t want a distraction causing us to fail in your cure.”
He didn't say what the “please” meant, but Cas could guess. Still, it wasn't exactly begging. Not yet. Castiel knew his tongue could do more. He lapped at Dean greedily, then backed off slightly, making the strokes of his tongue barely-there caresses that soon had Dean keening.
“So we can fuck like rabbits and jog my memory some more,” Cas said, dragging Dean back in for another kiss.
Castiel had a vague recollection of one of Dean’s early days in the village and talk of a rock band that had been displayed on his t-shirt. He was not sure what to expect, but he watched Dean pull a small silver disc from a slim plastic box and insert it into a slot in a machine Cas didn’t even know Dean had in the apartment.
He moved to get the crab off him and it startled immediately, running off in the other direction, heading for the water. He stood up and laughed at its antics and then sobered when he looked out to sea and realized he had no idea what had happened to the other people on board the boat with him. The storm had been sudden and nasty. He was lucky to be alive.
Dean’s smile fit just fine this time. “Thanks, man. I really appreciate it.” He clapped his hands and rubbed them together. “Now, what’s the first course? I’m starving.”
Cas made a disgruntled noise in his sleep, but didn’t wake. Dean wanted to stay and stare at him, but his bladder was insistent that not happen. He rushed for the bathroom instead, thankful for Cas’s quick tour before they’d started making out. Once he’d finished and washed his hands—a quick check of the mirror showing that he had a sleep mark across one cheek and his hair on the same side was a nightmare—Dean walked back to the bedroom and stared up at the sky and then back down at Cas.
“Fuck, Cas!” He made a quick decision and pulled back slightly, painful though it was to do so. “Look, undressing each other is romantic and shit and ordinarily, I’d be totally down for that. Next time, I swear, we’ll take our time and do this slow and easy, but right now, I just want to get naked together as fast as possible so I can feel the maximum amount of your skin.”
“Dean? That’s the dinner bell,” Cas called out and Dean realized he had tuned out the really loud clanging sounds somehow.
The staff meeting had been going fairly smoothly for the most part. Around the halfway mark, though, Dean noticed people were starting to lose interest. He wrapped up his spiel on quarterly earnings and rushed ahead to the small little video the boss had wanted him to show.
“You think I’m going to just put out before we wed? What sort of man do you take me for?” Cas asked, raising that eyebrow again as if he
He showered in a fog and got dressed, not worried for once about how he might look. He just grabbed his favorite T-shirt and jeans and headed out. The drive to the park was quick. Cas was picking up the food, so Dean could just meet him in the parking lot. Dean pulled up and turned off the engine, suddenly more nervous than he'd been since seeing Cas in the grocery store a few days before.
Dean barely waited for Cas’ nod before he was heading out to use the phone. He hoped Sam was done with dinner, but the phone was already ringing now. He also hoped it was Sam who picked up this time, but it hardly ever was, even though he knew they had caller ID and must know the number by now.
When he finally looked up from his worries, he saw how late it was getting. Even though Sam was only 12, he had a way of steadying Dean and making him feel better. So Dean picked up the phone and called his little brother.
Just like that, Castiel was sliding inside him. Nothing had ever felt so perfect. He felt hot and full and so hard he ached. Cas alternated his rhythm for a while between slow and deep or fast and shallow. The deep thrusts were hard ones. The shallow ones were gentle. Then Cas pulled out completely, leaving Dean whining.
He clenched down hard on Cas as he came and that put Cas even closer to his own orgasm, but not quite close enough. He looked down at the glistening drops of semen painting Dean’s belly and growled. He flipped Dean onto his back and pressed forward, taking Dean’s thighs up with him. He thrust wildly, still staring at Dean’s now blissed-out gaze, chasing the pleasure. He felt the deep tingling that indicated he was on the brink and pulled out quickly. He took himself in hand and splattered his release on top of Dean’s, mingling them on Dean’s body. Then he leaned down and kissed Dean deeply.
"Oh! Oh, wow, great! I was starting to think nobody was gonna answer the ad! When can you come see it?"
“Oh, honey....” She sighed. “I have always called him your brother because I wanted him to feel included, but I’ve always sort of known there was something else there between you two. Neither of you are with each other the way you are with Sam and you never have been.” She reached out and hugged him close. “You need to go talk to him.”
“Oh, I see.” Ava smiled. “Well, D, Cas, this is a simple process, but it can help so many relationship issues, you wouldn’t believe. I’m just going to sit back and observe, unless I see something that needs attention. Otherwise, just do as Aaron says and everything should be fine.”
into Jo, she got it in her head that he was one hundred percent right. She packed up her stuff, quit her job at the bar, and moved out to Montana to study to be a forest ranger.”
“Well,” Cas considered. “I am pretty taken with him. I suppose this is the best compromise,” he told her with a wink at Dean as he drank his tea.
Castiel offered a quick prayer of thanks and a grace for the meal. Then he raised his head and opened his eyes, offering a quick smile to Dean as he did the same. “Thank you for cooking breakfast, Dean. It all smells delicious.” Castiel could see that Dean’s posture straightened under the praise.
"Dean, I don't know what to tell you, but for a non-presenting Omega to suddenly want to present... that's what all the medical books will tell you is happening. You're trying to pair with him because your brain recognizes him as your perfect match."
And he was. More careful too, asking between each finger if Dean was all right. At first, Dean worried that the pain was going to linger, but after Cas had worked a single finger inside him for a minute or so, Dean no longer felt the sting. Two fingers didn’t bring it back and Dean could feel himself begin to melt again.
They went back to the dormitory for lunch and Castiel put together some sandwiches for them with the ham, cheese and lettuce that had been provided. The ham had not been sliced, but he was adept with a knife. It was one of his few skills in the kitchen. He was happy to see that the cheese was some of Mam’s. He wondered if stocking the icebox was her doing and he resolved to speak with her after supper to find out.
“Starla, sweetheart, I’m sorry, but I’ve gotta send you back home.” He tried a sympathetic smile, but he had no idea if it worked. He hoped she didn’t turn into an angry drunk.
Castiel—when he trusted no one else—but he praised Castiel and told him that what Castiel did everyday was brave. Castiel knew he had to get out and away. He had seized on the eggs as a likely sounding excuse to leave.
“Yeah. So, being that I was between jobs, I thought, why not? And the next thing I know, the videos are featured on the site and really popular and he offered me a more permanent sort of gig.” Dean rubbed his cheek, seeming a bit self-conscious again. “It’s a little strange because porn calls for a lot of things I’m not that used to. You can’t do the same video over and over, you gotta change it up, keep it fresh... which is how I ended up with a tentacle in my ass,” Dean finished with a laugh.
He’d been dreaming of tasting those plump pink lips forever, but the reality was so much sweeter. They were soft and warm and he felt arousal zing through him to the tips of his toes. A tug low in his belly told him his erection would soon be aching from the intensity of his wanting.
detect intentions, at least in some people, though not with 100% accuracy. He sighed as he heard the knock at the door. He supposed he’d just have to play it by ear.
“Wow.” Watching Cas’s mouth work was... well. If he’d thought the cherry sucking thing was hot, the stem thing topped it by a mile. Especially since Cas never broke eye contact the whole time. “Um, I get off shift in about twenty minutes, but let me know if you need anything.” Why was he getting so flustered again?
“While we do not approve such language, you will not be punished for it, Dean. We will appreciate your continued attempts to censor your words while you are with us.” Castiel thought he saw the corners of Jacob’s mouth twitch, but he wasn’t certain. “Castiel is correct, however. Our way of life is about serving God and helping each other. We cannot make you do the former, but you will be expected to learn the latter.”
Realization had Cas blushing. “I can’t really say anything. I knew the day that asshat dinged the Impala and you were talking to her, telling her it would be okay.”
“Knew I wanted you, but damn. I didn’t know how much,” he whispered against Cas’s ear, in between soft open-mouthed kisses to his neck. “Feel so good, baby.”
Cas, half asleep already, made noises of complaint, but Dean just shushed him gently and told him he’d be right back. Now that desire was no longer the most pressing thought, Dean’s mind tried to give over to fear. Cas still had to go back to the village, after all. He might change his mind about staying.
Dean was coherent enough now to turn twist the truth enough to protect himself. “It was a one night stand. The dream. A couple hours, maybe. The beginning is kinda fuzzy, like it didn’t bother with a back story. Just made me think I’d gotten too wasted to remember.”
That was just about the last thing Deanna had expected to hear. It wasn’t unwelcome, it was just unexpected. And given her track record with relationships and feelings talks, she wasn’t sure how to proceed.
Castiel looked at Dean and thought that Jacob spoke the truth. Dean did look better than he had the day before and Castiel didn’t think it was merely that he knew him a bit better. His face had more color and his eyes were brighter. He was not as tense. Castiel was pleased by the effect their village had had on him already.
It was Sunday night now and Dean knew he had been brooding since Sam left. Not for the reasons he usually did, though. It was a lot like last time. He realized he never had told Cas the rest of his story. He wasn’t sure he wanted to, but a part of him really did. If only to see if Cas would still see him the same way.
The smile that broke across Dean’s face was huge. “Yeah? Dude, that’s awesome! Sweet!” A shadow passed over his face then, but he shrugged and smile again. “That is really great. We can make plans tonight, what do you say?”
Dean, Sam and Charlie all stood there stunned for a moment. Cas looked pained, but he took time to explain to them what had happened.
Once in there, he braced his hands on the basin and took a deep breath to steady himself. As he did, he detected traces in the air of the soaps he had smelled on Dean the first day they’d met. He looked up, noticing new bottles on the side of the tub. He turned on the water, then picked up one of the bottles, inhaling lightly. It was a good scent. He picked up the other bottle as well. Also a good scent.
, Dean always told himself, when the ache in his chest was so strong he thought his arms might reach out for Cas on their own.
“Like two days ago. At the grocery store. We, um, exchanged numbers. We haven’t texted or anything though.”
“Keep it up, Chuckles. See if I let you come over this weekend.” They both knew the threat was empty, though.
“My head hurts... why are we in bed? Am I dreaming again?” He sounded a little loopy and barely there.
“Ohhhh,” Cas said knowingly. Then he leaned down and asked, in a conspiratorial whisper, “Is this about your tiny penis?”
Dean didn’t seriously consider shouting “Check!” like they did in romcoms. At least, not for longer than twelve seconds or so. But he did get the check as quickly as he could and get directions for Cas’s apartment as they walked drove back to the grocery store lot for Cas to retrieve his car.
“Well, yes. Fruit pie is one of the easiest things to make a vegan version of. All I have to do is substitute vegetable oil for butter in the crust and the rest is simple.”
Dean felt like he had heated liquid running from his neck up into his ears and his spine was tingling, but he heard Sam’s oft-repeated advice ringing through his head.
“You’re disgusting.” Sam made a face and left, probably to go back to the library and get his nerd on.
“Well... I mean, I suppose it might be bad form to sleep with the chef for your brother’s wedding and have it go south. Chefs are very vindictive people.” He sounded sincere, but there was a twinkle in his eye.
Dean had been minding his own business, silently pretending that his crush on his best friend wasn’t a problem, when his phone chimed and completely fucked up his whole world.
“Ma’am, in gratitude of your well-made meal, Dean would like to offer his services to the kitchen for the evening,” Cas told her.
Novak blinked at him, looking surprised. “I’m finished. Have a seat.” Novak gestured toward the chairs in front of his desk.
He stole a glance at his companion and damned near did a double take. The guy was hot. Like, seriously hot. He had the whole tall, dark and handsome thing down to a science.
Cas was lying on his side, next to a tree, his head facing toward the direction he’d been coming from. When Dean got close, he could see a nasty purple lump had formed on Cas’s forehead. That was actually good, he knew, if the swelling was on the outside. Still, he also knew getting knocked out wasn’t as easy in real life as it was in the movies, so it had to have been a hard hit. Then he looked around to see how Cas might have hit his head. He noticed a branch that was probably about the right height.
“Cas, I’m not gonna leave you if you stay with me. How could you think that?” There was hurt in Dean’s voice, but his words made Castiel see red.
There were reasons why he’d never pursued anything with Cas. Lots of really, really good reasons that his mind had decided to fix in his Djinn dream and now he couldn’t stop thinking about Cas in ways he couldn’t have him.
Cas looked relieved and even gave that tiny hint of a smile Dean loved so much. “So you don’t mind if I...?” He leaned forward slowly, drawing out the final syllable.
"No," Cas told him with a small smile. "I haven't. But knowing there are things out here for me besides you... it makes it less frightening." He looked back at Dean then. "I know it's a lot to ask, but I would prefer it if we didn't discuss it until I've made my choice. I don't want anything to sway me and I know you'll do that, even without meaning to."
“But nothing! I don’t care what kind of order he’s got! He’s not being taken off life support! I’m his fucking
“I’ve never done this before, Dean.” Castiel’s eyes were soft and sincere. “I’ve never even been tempted. After I saw you this morning, I took the liberty of picking up some supplies from the drugstore during my lunch break. Just in case.”
love with Cas. There was no denying it—and it was gonna hurt like a son of a bitch when he had to give him up at the beginning of the fall. Dean would take it, though. Dean would take whatever Cas was willing to give him. He would steal all the moments he could manage.
Dean and Cas left her and walked to where they had a choice of elevator or stairs. Dean correctly guessed that Cas had never been on an elevator and insisted that, at least this one time, they take that instead of the stairs. Cas was partly awed and partly afraid, but he said he didn’t’ regret the experience. Dean just grinned at him.
“Cas, hey, wait. I didn’t start liking you just because you lived here, all right? If I’d met you any other way, I’d have liked you just the same. Sam would have too. And all our other friends.” He blew out a breath. “But I know I was being a jerk about Meg. I’d never make you give up a friend, man. I’m not some psycho asshole, I swear, I just... I’m scared you’re gonna outgrow me when we get to college.”
Dean watched as Cas’ chest rose and fell, so very slowly. Each time, Dean expected it to be the last. Dean held his own breath in anticipation of that moment, but eventually he had to breathe again, however little he wanted to. He didn’t feel the urge to cry yet, which surprised him. He supposed he’d be overcome again once Cas’ chest had fallen for the last time.
Cas smiled in reassurance. “I’ve taken no offense, Dean. My brother is a good man, underneath it all, but he’s also a colossal pain in the ass, sometimes. Anyway, there’s no need to stand on formalities with me. I’m used to my brother’s antics.” His smile widened. “You’re a refreshing chance of pace.”
He got up and paced for a few minutes, doing his best to get his breathing under control. He managed to stop crying. Then he wiped his eyes and nose with some tissues he found on a table in the corner. He looked over at Cas, lying there. Realized he might never feel those lips again. Knew, suddenly, that he had to, at least once more.
They had both opted for water, since the carpentry work had been intense and made them both break a sweat. Dean paused to drink most of the rest of his in one go as he waited for Castiel to answer and Castiel had to tear his eyes away from the way his throat worked on the process. He did not even understand why he was drawn to the sight, but he knew it was something he could not pursue.
When they were introduced, he dutifully stepped forward and reached out to shake Dean Winchester’s hand. Dean clasped it firmly in his own, never breaking eye contact. His skin was warm and rough in Castiel’s own. Castiel shook once and let it go, not liking the strange tingling sensation. It was like the air before a storm and it frightened him.
“A guilt trip is not what I need right now, Balthazar. I realize it was hard for you to care for me when mom and dad separated. It was hard on all of us and I appreciate you always being there for me and continuing to still be here, but I really can’t talk about what happened. I need time Balthazar, please. I’m not saying I won’t ever tell you the full story, just not right now. Right now I just want a few laughs with you. Can you do that for me?” Cas knew he had put his brother in a hard place. He was forcing his brother’s hand and he was well aware of it, but he had no choice because the second he even started to think of that bar, he could feel the wall begin to crumble. It was weak enough as it was due to the mentioning of Dean.
His voice sent a thrill up Cas’ spine and unconsciously his immediate response was to start smiling. He grinned like a fool and couldn’t be bothered to care. He joined in singing the next part with Dean now that the initial surprise had worn off. Their voices blended together as they sang, “I'm in love. I'm all shook up. Mm mm mm, mm, yay, yay, yay”
With a long and heavy sigh, Cas reluctantly nodded his head and walked into the room. He shut the door behind him. Taking a look around the room, he noticed the stereo system in the corner that was now playing a much softer tune than before. He also saw two pinball machines standing next to each other against the left wall. One themed as the movie from Jaws and the other of The Doors. When he got closer to his brother, he couldn’t help but see a large amount of chip bags surrounding the area from which Balthazar sat. The majority of them being Dorito bags. A half-full liter of Mountain Dew was perched near one of these bags. A box of Lucky Charms cereal laid on its side on the floor next to the table, and next to it was a bowl that only contained the rainbow marshmallows. On the opposite side of the table from where Balthazar sat was a few more bean bags. It wasn’t until Cas looked up a bit more, that he saw the many posts it notes scattered around haphazardly on the walls. Each showing a sketch drawing or boldly written letters. One of them showed a rough drawing of Mr. Clean with biceps the size of Popeye's, and underneath it read: Mr. Clean, but sexy.
They finally reached the room and Dean slid the keycard home. No sooner had Dean stepped in than Cas shut the door and had Dean backed up against it. Only then did Dean realize that Cas was much more solidly built than he himself was - and Dean wasn’t exactly a lightweight. Cas was thick and solid from head to toe, except for his wrists and ankles. Dean hope that translated to his dick, but at this point, that would really just be a bonus.
“Really? Man, that’s cool! I know you were worried about being on your own, Cas,” Sam said, smiling at their mutual friend. “Do I get to come visit?” he asked Dean.
“You are welcome to read whatever you wish while you are here.” Castiel hesitated, then stepped closer and grabbed a book. “Here, try this. It is one of my personal favorites.”
As they got up and gathered their clothes, preparing to leave for the showers, Dean said, “Hey Cas? You, um... you know I love you, right?”
“The party starts at six, but you will probably want to stop and buy your own beer on the way, since he only drinks what we sell at the store.”
Dean felt like an ass, continuing to act like nothing was wrong, but then again he didn’t want to ruin the party Lisa had been looking forward to for weeks. He really did want her to be happy and this was at least something he could give her before he broke things off. He hoped it wouldn’t make things worse in the long run, but he couldn’t worry about that right now.
“He and Jacob are friends, as you know. I believe we are all to have lunch,” Cas answered, not thinking much of the arrangement.
“What? That’s crazy, of course I do.” Dean sighed. “It’s just... Sam made it really clear that he didn’t want us to hookup and I just... you’re really hot and I didn’t know how else to keep myself from making a move.”
They used Dean’s ruined shirt to clean themselves up and then awkwardly started getting dressed. They pulled up their pants not a moment too soon, it seemed.
“I’m not, Cas.” Dean dared put an arm around him. “Look, I’m sorry, man. Next time, maybe I should help you screen the ads or whatever. These guys were obviously some very specific kind of furry, man.”
Dean shivered, an effect of a mild contraction in his groin at Cas’s words and voice. “Yeah, that sounds good,” he whispered.
The Alpha & Omega Air Conditioning van was not quite as big as his own, but he was somewhat mollified to see it had sustained more damage than the good ole Lube Mob had. Their windows were too darkly tinted to see inside and he wrapped sharply on the driver’s side.
“Yours,” he managed to croak out as he finished the rest of his beer in a hurry. He slapped some bills on the bar and gestured for Cas to lead the way.
Dean squirmed learning that Cas's voice got twice as rough and hot when he was annoyed. He forced himself to laugh instead of begging Cas to come home with him.
His expression was one of mild horror and only the fact that Dean knew Cas was pansexual kept him from thinking Cas had developed some sort of anti-LGBT sentiment. Didn’t mean it felt good to be on the receiving end of that face, however.
Then he was gone, carrying a small bag with him. Dean watched him from the window and was gratified to see Cas looking up in search of him. He waved down and Cas waved up with a smile. Then he was in the cab and rolling away.
Dean blinked at him in surprise. Then he licked his lips and swallowed. “Well, I don’t know about just watching, but, if, um, if you wanted, you could, um, help.”
“Yeah, well, my brother’s an asshole, what can I say?” He seemed to realize how close he was standing to Cas and cleared his throat as he backed away. “Um, but anyway, as you can see, I have my own Wi-Fi.”
“We’re returning to our room now,” Cas announced to the room at large. He grabbed Dean’s wrist and dragged him out of the kitchen.
Dean closed his eyes, making a face Cas could not interpret, but it looked pained. “That was really thoughtful, man.”
“Okay, so my family, they’ve always been hunters, as far as I know. At least, that’s what my dad said. I never really liked it. It didn’t seem right. Some of the monsters were killing people, sure, and they needed to be stopped, I got that.”
