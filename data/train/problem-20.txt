“Sherlock, I am not really as selfless a man as you think I am. I would never have kissed you, true, if I hadn’t thought it was the end. But not because I didn’t want to, and not because I’m so morally upstanding that I would never do that to Mary. I’ve only held myself back all this time because I thought
Perching on the arm of the chair, he tucked his feet under my knees and handed me a small black box. It was embossed in silver with the name of the jeweller at the end of our street, which we passed often as we made our way to Scotland Yard. I looked at it, and back up at him.
John had always thought of them as a sort of impossible solar system in which each of them was simultaneously a sun and a planet endlessly and helplessly orbiting each other.
John watches him struggle for a moment, then walks, floorboards creaking under his bare feet, over to where Sherlock’s standing. He runs his hands up Sherlock’s stomach, his touch sure and comfortable.
“I do too.” Sherlock ducks his head down while John’s still looking up, steals a kiss from that perfect mouth. John licks into Sherlock’s mouth, curling his tongue around the end of Sherlock’s. The toe of John’s trainer catches on an uneven line in the sidewalk, and they both stumble forward, laughing against each other’s lips. Two women walking past give them a disgusted glare, all bunched foreheads and thin mouths. One mimes
"Good." John says, and it's not half of what he wants to say, it's not even close. He wants to say that he's been waiting for almost five years to have Sherlock's hands on him, and he knows he can't ever live without this ever again, and they haven't even begun yet. He wants to say that Sherlock's hot mouth on his makes tears well up sore in the back of his throat. He wants to say that he's spent two years trying to imagine how this would feel, mourning what they’d never had, and that none of his fantasies ever came close to the reality of this, of them. He wants to say,
“So. Plans for today?” Mike pours milk in his coffee and takes a bite out of the giant pile of fried potatoes that take up half his plate.
A tear threatened, caught in Sherlock’s lower lashes, and then dropped, rolling down the smooth curve of Sherlock’s cheekbone. He shook his head, more tears following the first. “No. You’re the best person I’ve ever known --”
They're both quiet for a long moment. They've never really discussed their sexuality. In some ways it's completely inconsequential, because they'll never be with anyone but each other again. This first time, though, John needs to assess, to know Sherlock will be alright with everything, because John was a slag long before he was sleeping with prostitutes, and Sherlock's sexual experiences are terribly limited comparatively. John doesn't want to make any assumptions about what Sherlock will be alright with.
The scope of his own lack of self awareness is staggering. What a completely arrogant and self-serving prick he’s been washes over him so hard and fast it nearly knocks him to his knees.
. Sherlock’s never wanted to kiss anyone before, not really, but he wants to kiss John right now, see what those pink lips feel like pressed between his own, taste the salt on John’s skin. A blush blooms across his cheeks, he can
An enchanting pink blush rises on Sherlock’s cheeks. He voice is stripped completely raw when he husks out, “Why don’t you show me?”
The wind whipped up stronger, blowing right through the corduroy jacket and thin tee shirt. He shivered a little and turned his collar up around his neck.
“You always fall asleep.” He heard Sherlock say fondly, and he tried to open his eyes, but he couldn’t.
Sherlock smiles in John’s direction, but it’s fleeting, his restless eyes flicking back to the London rush hour traffic as they wait to cross the street. Something’s off. He’s not being convincing enough. Sherlock’s not buying it, he knows
Sherlock obediently flipped himself, pushing pillows out of the way and flattening his hands against the headboard. He felt the weight shifting on the bed, John’s knees on either side of his thigh, and then John’s calloused hands rubbing up his back and down over his arse, his legs. He heard John suck in a deep breath as he scooped forward, the hard length of him pressing into Sherlock’s lower back, and then his lips were pulling at Sherlock’s earlobe gently but insistently.
“There’s not really precedent for this, but then - there’s not precedent for any of this. Yeah, alright. I’ll have to get you booties for your shoes, and you’ll have to shove off the minute anyone objects, but - Scotland Yard. That’s. Impressive.” She turned down the corridor. “Come on then.”
. Sherlock nods again, and John can feel the roughness of evening stubble against his face, the humidity of Sherlock’s breath billowing down into his collar.
"I am. I really am." The kettle screams and John stands up. "Let's go back inside. I'm fucking freezing out here."
Sherlock eases the navy blue cotton down over John’s legs, watching his cock spring free, thick and flushed, glans shining wet. Sherlock whispers
“I know, I know. Shhhh. We’re taking it slow, remember? I’m showing you. Showing you how much I absolutely
A frisson of pleasure rolled down my spine at his praise and I settled myself more comfortably between John’s legs, draping my bent arms over his knees so that I could lean all the way in and take him as deeply as possible. The moment my arms came up, however, I felt the soft touch of his fingertips on my bicep, tracing a strikingly gentle path down to my elbow.
"Roll to your side...it'll be...easier on you that way." Sherlock's not even sure he'll fit this first time, and hurting John is unthinkable.
"You know. We don't have to say everything tonight. This is just the start, right? We're going to work this out together, and we're married. We have our whole lives. Don't we?"
I’ve never seen anyone more beautiful in my entire life. And I am going to tell you everyday from now until you believe me, and then I'll keep telling you anyway, just because you deserve to hear it."
"You - get a condom on and I'll - " Sherlock pants, barely coherent, and pushes at John's shoulders.
Overcome with emotion, I surged up to kiss him, cutting short his nervous babbling, and curled my arm round his neck tightly. “Of
“I’m sure you can think of some way to repay me.” Sherlock winks and spins away, hips wiggling slightly.
“Sure. Course I do.” John smiled his most innocent smile, making sure those blue eyes were twinkling, and pulled out his wallet. After the man had left, John had sat in the diner, chewing his rubbery omelet, and counted the money in the envelope. Tucked in with the most cash he’d ever held in his hands in his entire life was a Wisconsin driver’s license with his picture, in the name of John Winston. He supposed the first name was kept so John wouldn’t forget his own name.
Sherlock tries to conjure up the necessary anger to fight back, but panic is weighing him down. His limbs feel like custard, thick and impossible to move properly. He lets himself sag into the seat. He’s been here before. Just get it over with, let it happen, and then he can go and forget about. Score.
something. For the first time in almost two years, he wants. He desires. Something, anything. No. Not anything.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped up to John’s, brimming with desire and nervousness and love and a thousand other emotions that Sherlock could barely name or understand. Affection surged up viscerally in John, and he reached out, grasped Sherlock by the nape of his neck and pulled him down so their foreheads were touching. “You know what? I haven’t even kissed you yet tonight.”
The words hit John in the chest, right under his sternum. That was the thing he always feared. Feared and in some secret part of himself wanted. Sherlock being submerged in this, in him. And here he is saying thats exactly what's happened. Acid surges up in his throat even as he feels tears spilling hot down his face. "I love you."
“Hmmm. Now.” John scratches his eyebrow and looks at the ceiling, pretends to think about it. “Now, you text Montague and tell her not to send any more cases our way. I don’t want any interruptions tonight. Then, I’m going to get my pyjamas on, and you’re going to make us drinks, and then...then we’re going to do whatever the hell we want. Because we can. Sound good to you, darling?”
His mouth ticked up at the John-ness of that statement, and nodded. He stepped into the hallway and put the phone to his ear.
Sherlock shifted enough that he could reach across his chest and take John’s left hand in his. It was less swollen than it had been yesterday, but blacker now, and looked so small and delicate laying atop Sherlock’s much larger one. The fingernail on John’s ring finger was missing. He put John’s hand to his lips and kissed it gently, then laid it back on the sheets, afraid to cause him pain.
“It’s so good, John,” Sherlock whispered, barely audible, his chest tight with arousal and affection.
"So where's your infamous other half, eh, John? Thought he'd be at the match, since he's been to nearly every practice." Owen Franklin, one of the team’s biggest forwards and John’s most reliable nurse at the surgery, slammed a pint down in front of John. He smiled through newly chipped teeth, his twisted potato nose crinkling at the bridge. “For you, Doc.”
“Because I thought you would - be upset. I thought you would try to convince me to keep taking cases, because you - because you love this.”
“I’d noticed.” John settles back against the stiff cushioning, the sig nestled familiar against his spine. “Ah, that does feel better. And safer.”
Sherlock’s watching Jim, doesn’t see immediately the flash of silver in the darkness. By the time he does, John’s already doubled over. The goon pushes him to the floor, he lands with a dead thump, his head skidding limply. Sherlock’s allowed to struggle free, rush to John’s side. There’s a pool of dark blood spreading across the tile. John’s face is ghostly white. The goons disappear up the steps behind Jim, neither having uttered a word the whole time they were there.
“Yeah. Who’re you anyway? Minion?” John dragged on his cigarette, sipped ice cold coffee. Christ, it was only thirty minutes old. The Buick didn’t have the best heat, however, and it was nearly 10 below zero today. It was cold as a witch’s tit here all the time.
"Still alive then?" John crosses his arms over his chest, Sherlock's note crumpled in his left hand.
All he thinks about is that they belong to each other, that they always have, and that they've simply done everything all wrong. It seethes within him, the question of what they could have been. What they could still be, if John only had the bollocks to say something.
John grins and pulls his fingers out to a disappointed groan from Sherlock, runs his hand up the back of Sherlock's thigh into the crook of his knee and hitches Sherlock's leg up over his good shoulder. "I'm going  to do better than that."
“Fine.” James picks at a fingernail, feigning boredom, though he makes no move to leave. “John. Watson.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, closed his eyes. His thumb stroked the inside of John's wrist. "John. He's - he's connected to Moriarty somehow. Mycroft's not got all the details yet, but -- "
Sherlock wrapped his hand around his cock and pulled, the tightly wound ache of pleasure that had been thrumming deep within him all night suddenly spiraling through his body with a tornado like ferocity. It coalesced low in his belly, sharp and bright, just waiting for that final push into release. John hoarsely whispered
The casualness with which Sherlock says it, the ease, cuts right to John's core. He puts a hard kiss to Sherlock's forehead. "I love you too. Right. Eight. Okay. Okay."
, do you hear me? John, goddammit.” There was a pull between them as strong as a line pulling a ship to shore, anchoring him to the man between his hands. Sherlock’s head tilted, he pushed forward, crushed his mouth to John’s, pulled the ruined raw flesh between his lips, tongue hot and insistent. Possessive.
“What I mean to say is that we’ve not witnessed anything.” Sherlock said smoothly, changing tactics.
"No. He'll be - he's not really. We don't. Not while we're on a case." John was starting to have trouble with sentences of more than five or six words. He didn't really drink like this anymore. He and Sherlock would often share a bottle of wine over the length of an entire evening, or sip scotch slowly in front of the fire, each of them with a book open on their laps. Slamming pints in quick succession was something he hadn't done since active duty. They'd won the match, though, their first match, and he should be reveling in it. He picked up the cool glass, damp with beads of sweat, and ran his thumb down through the moisture. "He'll be busy until late."
“Sure is. Now...uh, I hate to ask, since you’re paying in cash, and I hate to lose a sale, but uh...you got an American driver’s license, doncha, mister? I’m not supposed to sell to anyone who doesn’t, you know? Cause…” The man twisted his chubby fingers together, peered nervously at John through greasy thick glasses.
, John’s stomach had fluttered with anticipation, nerves tingling. Something was happening, and he would never be the same. That’s what was going through his mind as they walked squeaky-shoed down the white corridors at Bart’s, winding their way to the lab where it all began.
." His anger died as quickly as it had flared, leaving John sinking back against the bed, looking drained. Lips pinched in a tight line, he shook his head disbelievingly and murmured in a low voice, "Do I love you? Are you fucking joking? Do you
This time it's a serial killer. Five bodies in two months. Gruesome and disturbing. John -- brave, strong John - chokes and gags at the first body, turns away. He's silent and brooding when they get home, and Sherlock smoothes his hair and tells him it's alright, he'll find the bastard and this won't happen again.
"Wasn't planning to. Bit hungry, actually. Want to get cleaned up and go downstairs, get some breakfast and more coffee? Like a date." John realises as he's saying this that an hour ago they were not a couple and now they are. Now when they go to Speedy's for eggs and toast and sit across the table from each other, John will hold Sherlock's hand next to the salt shaker, and Sherlock will rest his foot in between both of John's, and they'll be
“Hey.” John’s voice was gruff, his mouth moving lazily against Sherlock’s lower back, dipping into the top of the crease of his arse occasionally. “You okay? You’re awfully quiet.”
“Oh, right. Yeah, so, anyway, I dunno. I sort of miss rugby, and a few of the lads at the surgery are really after me about it. Practice starts next weekend.”
"Mmmm." Sherlock wriggled a bit, knowing he was already lost. John could turn him down, not be in the mood, but Sherlock always wanted John. Every second. There was no turning him down. Still, he could tease a bit. "I don't know. I'm rather tired, honestly."
Sherlock hums and lets himself relax, sinking further into John’s embrace. John rubs a flat hand up and down Sherlock’s spine and breathes slowly, letting his body remember how it feels to have Sherlock here, with him, against him. The way they’ve only really been for such a short time in their long friendship, but it feels to John like it always was this way.
angry. I’m the angriest person in the room, all the time. I hate everything. I hate everyone, and mostly myself.” He paused, nose twitching to the side, and blinked away tears. “I’ve been blaming myself for two years, Sherlock. I’ve walked around for two years thinking I failed you. That it was my fault you were dead. That I’d lost you before we could even…”
“I know. I want you, too.” Sherlock pushed John back against the pillows and stood up, swallowing down his own need with a shiver and trying not to look at the sheen of water on John’s bare chest. “But you’re quite the mess at the moment, if you hadn’t noticed. And we’re not exactly in the most private of places.”
Sherlock liked to think of John that way, raucous and mischievous, playing practical jokes on his rugby mates and slow dancing with pretty girls in a darkened gymnasium on a Friday night. It gave Sherlock a thrill of victorious possessiveness that only Sherlock was privy to knowing the inner turmoil that had been going on within John while he was playing the girl crazy athlete. That while he was wooing every girl in his form, he had in reality been pining over the captain of his rugby team since they were fourteen, and that while he pretended to hate schoolwork and studying as much as his mates did, he harboured the desire to become a doctor, and worked secretly to be at the top of the class so he could get into a good uni.
“Good. Me too.” John clears his throat and runs his hand slow and steady over the bumps of Sherlock’s rib cage, over the swell of that ridiculously lush and perfect arse. “I thought about this all the time, you know. Me and you. Like this.”
They washed up and made breakfast together - toast and cold cereal and coffee - and Sherlock settled in his chair with his laptop on the arm.
amazing.” His face breaks into a wide grin as the spotlights above the dance floor start flashing white and purple, falling across his glimmering body in ribbons of colour and reflecting brightly in his luminous eyes. He shakes his head and trills a laugh, catching his bottom lip in his teeth again.
John gasped brokenly, licked hot and wet at Sherlock’s mouth as he rocked into Sherlock’s fist. “I know, love, I know. Oh, you feel so good. God, your
So glad you won. Yes, case moving. Sorry I didn’t get back to you right away. I’m at the lab now. Molly’s gone off home, leaving me with soggy chips and a dessicated corpse. Jealous? I’m guessing you’re out with the team. If you’re not, could really use you here.
“No, I don’t feel dizzy. My head hurts a bit, but I’m okay. I’ve had concussions before, Sherlock. I’ll be right as rain after a few days of bad telly and long naps.” John reaches for Sherlock, making to draw him in to kiss that perfect little nose, but Sherlock sweeps up off the floor before he can and whirls away toward the kitchen.
"Sherlock, god, I never thought --" John leans forward, sliding up Sherlock's body without dislodging his fingers and puts his lips to his sternum, his collarbone, licks a wet messy stripe up his throat, and Sherlock moans and throws his arms around John's shoulders.
Soldier Boy sucks in a breath, his cheekbones colouring a lovely coppery red. The space between them sparks silver with electricity, and Sherlock nearly wraps a hand around his neck right there and kisses him. Instead he licks his own lips, wetting them shiny with saliva, and lets them fall into a pout, never breaking eye contact. Sherlock's heart is hammering against his ribs.
There's a subtle tensing along the ridge of Sherlock's shoulders, where they're laying under John's arm. He remains silent, though.
"Because sometimes you don't want to be, or aren't capable of being, the one who holds all the emotional burden. The adult, for lack of a better term." Sherlock had his deductive voice now.
“Yes. Much.” Sherlock smiles softly, more to himself than to John, and picks up John’s hand, threading their fingers together. “Now we should have this discussion. However - difficult - it may be.”
“I died the first time you did. How could this be any worse?” John says, his harsh whisper so quiet he’s not even sure Sherlock hears it, until the train car goes eerily silent, broken only by the sound of his own ragged breaths. He’s looking at the floor, at his own shoes, thinking how they’re going to be melted in a matter of minutes - blobs of smoking rubber and curled blackened leather. He wonders briefly whether he’ll actually be blown right out of them.
, like this. You’re not the only one who can deduce people.” John wiggles his eyebrows in such an exaggerated way that it takes them both out of the intensity of this moment, fractures the pressure that had been building inside of Sherlock into something relatively more sustainable.
Sherlock runs his hands over his chest, slides around his back, dives his arms over John’s shoulders and nuzzles against his earlobe. “Relax, John. Loosen up.”
Sherlock shifted down on the bed so they were face to face. He looked the way he always did after sex, softer, younger, the lines in his face gentled, and his eyes bright and affectionate. “John. You’ve reminded me time and time again that we make our own rules about this. We aren’t bound by arbitrary ideas about dominant and submissive roles. I think we’ve discovered tonight, and in the last week, that you occasionally require me to be more dominant. You need - a break - from the mental and emotional responsibility of being in charge of me, of our relationship. We've also discovered you have more than a passing interest in pain and blood play. In me hurting you."
The bartender backed away with wide eyes, clearly excusing herself from the rising tension, and started filling pint glasses.
The day Sherlock brings home the bees, John shakes his head and tries to glare at Sherlock over the top of his half moon reading glasses, but he can't quite manage it.
He nods to himself, sucks the cigarette down to the filter and flicks it into the struggling patch of grass next to the bench. The mid morning sun is hot on his back as he trudges up Ludgate Hill toward the hospital, calm in his certainty that no matter what happens to him, Jim won't hurt John again.
“There’s nothing.” Sherlock says tightly, side eyeing a young couple bustling through the door with an armful of shopping bags. His knee pushes marginally against John’s.
All the air goes from his lungs in a rush, like a fist to the gut. It hurts more than anything Sherlock's yet said. To be shut out of what brought them together in the first place, to be excluded from the most important part of Sherlock's life; it's unimaginable. The thought alone creates a chasm in him, an aching emptiness. A sob escapes him. "Sherlock. I didn't mean to --"
I took him finally into my mouth, moaning at the familiar salty weight of him on my tongue. I shut my eyes, allowing my other senses to guide me. I could feel every ridge of him, every centimetre of silk over stone. He was leaking onto the back of my palate, thick and bitter and perfect, and I could not help but sink even more deeply forward, allowing his cockhead to bump the very back of my throat. I had long ago taught myself not to choke on John’s girth, but to allow the musculature of my throat to open to him as eagerly as the rest of me did.
. I really do.” John’s eyes flick to the alarm clock. “Shit. It’s nearly seven. Look, can we just - can we talk tonight? If we’re up for it after today, anyway.”
Thanks, as always, the the beautiful, brilliant, devastatingly talented, and gently honest Caitlinfairchild/caitlinisactuallyawritersname, without whose advice and suggestions I would be half the writer I am. Her beta-ing and her friendship keep me right. Thanks, love! <333
It turned into a foggy day, temperature dropping continuously as Sherlock wound them northwards and toward the coast. Sherlock shuffled through the music on John’s phone, finding quite a bit of cacophonous grunge from the mid 1990’s that he knew John must have downloaded very recently. Nostalgia for his teen years, perhaps. This trip had awoken quite a lot of nostalgia in John. Sherlock had found him a few days previous, sitting cross legged on the bed with a falling to pieces scrapbook spread across his lap.
Sherlock's writhing now, he can't stop moving and shifting and arching against John's body, his face and his neck blood red, his chest mottled pink and white with arousal. "Kiss me now."
John reads all day and makes long phone calls to Greg. Sherlock hunts for fossils on the beach and goes through a box of magazines about animal husbandry they find in the shed. They make love every night, as they haven't done in years. John cooks them eggs and toast in the mornings, potatoes and meat in the evenings. They both gain weight.
“I agree. You’re right. I realised that’s a real problem for me. And what we do, well. It’s not a traditional...anything. That’s been hard for me to accept.”
"No, baby. I don't." John could see Sherlock was in the mood to have his dom, to be John’s little poppet, his good boy. Alright then. He smoothed his hand over Sherlock's hair, fingers falling to his ear. He rubbed the lobe between his thumb and index finger, knowing Sherlock's earlobes were a particularly sensitive spot, and watched with satisfaction as Sherlock's eyes fell closed and he nudged his face into John's touch. "What good boy you are, my sweet one. No corrections. I'm looking forward to something much more interesting tonight. I've been going spare since I got home, waiting for you. What took so damned long?"
John falls into pace beside him as they jog down the stairs. Jim’s watching them. He can feel his glare on the back of his neck like sunburn. He’s never going to let Sherlock have the last word. Never.
John fucks into him harder now, faster, the grip on Sherlock’s cock faltering as his own pleasure heightens. His head bows, rolls to the side, as his mouth drops open. “Ah, fuck - I'm so - close - ”
,” I moaned, more than half serious. I felt as though I had never in my life gone so long wanting to come, and I was becoming frantic.
John fumbles for it, Sherlock grabs at the bag first, rustles inside until he finds the bottle of lube. John watches, transfixed, as Sherlock deftly unscrews the cap and tears off the tiny aluminium paper seal, and dips his finger in the top, tugging his pants off with his other hand.
Sherlock smirks at him. "Why do you think I had to eliminate it all those years? Sex is rather -- addictive. For me."
"Tired. My stomach aches a little. I'm okay." John turns and looks at Sherlock, a flicker of heat in the backs of his eyes. "Glad to have you next to me somewhere other than in that damned hospital bed."
“Whatever you want, baby,” John murmurs, thumbs pressing possessively into Sherlock’s hipbones. “If you want, I could - “
Sherlock's eyes widened, bright with worry in the struggling winter light. He raised his hands in a calming gesture, palms outstretched toward John. The panic was blinding, blurring that beloved face into every prostitute he'd ever used, their pink hands and black curls, their faces a mash of bitten lips and desperate noises. He shook his head, tears spilling over, and tried to make himself see Sherlock as he really was. He couldn't. He gagged, tasting tobacco and sour sweat on his tongue.
. He couldn’t take the inertia. When the car dropped them in front of 221B, John just turned on his heel and started walking. Sherlock wordlessly fell into step, sweeping along beside him, occasionally taking his hand reassuringly. They’d stalked though Marylebone until they hit Oxford Street, where John hung a sharp left, passing quickly through the gleaming hordes of posh shoppers in Mayfair, winding them through the tiny crooked lanes of Soho and down through Covent Garden. They’d stopped to use the loo and get cappuccinos in a tiny hipster coffee shop on Monmouth Street, sharing a rich chocolate croissant under the awning as they waited for a rain shower to pass.
“Pants, too.” John says roughly, and stands up, taking his own off. He’s half hard, cock standing out straight from his body. He looks at Sherlock steadily, almost challengingly. “Lay down.”
“I want to hold you.” John puts his hand on Sherlock’s hip and tugs gently, encouraging him to roll. “And it will feel
“You wore pants to bed?” John pulls back from the kiss and shakes his head fondly at Sherlock. “You really
“Not particularly. I’m sure lots of people are this height.” John loathed any comparison with this weasley little bastard. He was quick to change the subject. “Tell me again about these two guys who tried to kill you. They think you did something that Lorne did? Tell me. In detail.”
"Damn right you will. That's better. When I woke up and you weren't here, I felt a bit lost." It's supposed to sound like a joke. Why does it not sound like a joke?
“Oh fuck, oh god, I’m gonna come, Jesus…” John’s thighs shook, stomach clenching, as he spilled hot into the condom. His hips jerked forward a few more times, fingers gripped tight around the man’s waist, and when he’d caught his breath, he grabbed the base of the condom and held on as he pulled out.
“I love you so fucking much, Jesus Christ, Sherlock. When you were so angry with me last week, I really thought -”
"Um. Okay." John sat down in his chair and sipped his coffee. "I'll have to check with Aunt Aileen and make sure she's able to see us. That's rather short notice."
“I - um - ” Sherlock swallows, weighing his options. One, he tells John to stop and John gets angry, stops entirely and they have a fight. Two, he tells John to stop and John’s feelings are hurt enough that they just have to stop because neither of them wants to anymore. Three, he doesn’t tell John to stop, and he gets his legs nearly bitten off. “I don’t want you to stop. I - I liked the first one. Just...a bit gentler?”
He nods dumbly, mute and sick inside. His mind’s on a loop. A flash of a knife, John falling limply to the floor, the sound of his trainers slick with John’s blood squeaking up the steps, the flip of the old woman’s phone opening. Jim’s vile grin as he walked past him. John’s eyes glowing with laughter, John’s arms warm round his waist, John cross legged next to him in the alley.
Without even really thinking about it, Sherlock slams back the rest of his gin and tonic, sets the glass down on the nearest flat surface, and begins winding his way through the thrumming herd on the dance floor, pushing through with a single minded determination. Soldier Boy is pouring shots, unconsciously moving to the thumping beat of the music, as Sherlock approaches. He doesn’t look up as Sherlock steps up to the bar and drapes himself across it.
“Come on then. I promise I won’t take advantage of you.” John nudged at Sherlock’s thigh, encouraging him to sit on his outstretched legs.
“Talk about you going back to your sleaze ex boyfriend and wearing a wire and putting yourself in absolutely the most horrible danger possible in the hopes that he might maybe say something incriminating before he figures it all out?” John huffs a laugh and rubs his thumb over Sherlock’s chin, slow. “Not really.”
“You’re right.” John shakes his head and exhales, chews his tongue. “I have been so blind in all this, Sherlock. Jesus Christ, I. I don't even know what to say. I -- I’m always hurting you and not meaning to. I told you. When we started this, I told you how afraid I was of hurting you, and now here we are. Shit. I’m so sorry, love. I’m so sorry. I have acted like a complete arse. I have. I don't want to, I didn't mean to. But -- I don’t know if I know how to fix this.”
“Don’t want to sleep.” Sherlock stirs and flattens his hand against John’s stomach as if to push himself up. “You need to rest, you need food and hydration and -”
Another forward, a burly black haired Northern Irish pediatrician named Tommy Sheehan, sidled up between John and Owen. His pale skin was ruddy, his normally sharp eyes unfocused. He draped an arm around each of them and grinned at John. "Not so bad for the oldest bloke on the team. Bet you'll be hurting tomorrow, though, old man."
“If he fucks with you tonight…” John sends Sherlock a warning glare, threads his fingers through Sherlock’s. “Last night was different. Now we’re --
He swallows, his mind scrambling to catch up with his body’s sensory messages. Right. It seems unlikely John’s managed to replace the sofa right out from underneath him, even while he was deep in his mind palace. And while a lamp is more portable, why would John have moved it? A shiver of alarm rolls icily down his spine.
"Why ever not? I've dressed up as all sorts of things for you. I have a cat costume, for goodness sake, John." Sherlock cocked a eyebrow at him. "Do you think I didn't feel absurd kneeling at your feet with a bloody tail coming out of my..."
It’s been three weeks since Greg asked Sherlock to help. It’s never, ever taken him this long before. He thumps his head against the wall. Pain radiates down through his eye sockets, and it feels good. He does it again, harder. Braces his hands against the wall and pounds the top of his head into it as hard as he can.
"Alright then. I'm going to keep going." John eases the clear glass stretcher into him, the transparent flared base allowing him to see how Sherlock's spread wide open around it, the skin red. The visual is dizzyingly arousing, as Sherlock keens and clenches his arse. John runs a fingertip over the smooth cool glass, tracing the outline of Sherlock's hole around the toy. "Jesus Christ, baby. I'm going to keep this in you all the time. I'll come in you and plug you back up, keep you open for me until I'm ready to fuck you again. How would you like that?"
“Well, let’s remedy that, shall we?” John breathes out, dragging his fingertips along the inside of Sherlock’s knee, dipping them under the hem of his pants. He nuzzles under Sherlock’s jaw and sucks, hard enough to leave a mark, hard enough that Sherlock can feel capillaries popping, his skin moulding round John’s teeth. He gasps, shocked at how much it stings.
, which is nothing short of completely infuriating. No one’s ever had an effect on him like this. James Moriarty tried, god knows how he tried, but in the end Sherlock just couldn’t feel this way about him, which was the death knell for whatever friendship they’d had.
John moves his way up Sherlock’s abdomen single-mindedly, leaving no inch of Sherlock’s bare skin unkissed. When he’s finally at eye level again, he brushes his lips so gently against Sherlock’s mouth that it could almost be chaste, and taps the ends of their noses together.
Sherlock caught on, and sat up, helped John move, propping him up with gentle hands and rearranging the IV lines and cords leading to various monitors, until John was settled in the cradle of Sherlock’s arms. He wasn’t surprised at how comforting and right it felt, to have his head against Sherlock’s shoulder, breathing in the wintry smell of his skin, the earthy scent of his woolen scarf still lingering on his neck.
Sherlock smiles back, his eyes as brightly intelligent and twinkling as they had ever been. His face is a bit weathered, laugh lines etched deeply at the corners of his eyes, wrinkles round his mouth, his jaw gone a bit jowly, but he’s as dangerously handsome to John as he had been nearly thirty years ago. John crosses the room and lays a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder as he bends to drop a kiss on silvery black hair.
“Agreed.” Sherlock squeezes him tightly and John can feel the weight of everything they still haven’t said, but it’s alright now, because they have time to say them.
John slowly turns his head and blinks confusedly for a moment, then licks his lips and smiles at the sight of Sherlock standing there. “Hey gorgeous. Was wondering where you got to.”
“That’s right, my lovely creature. Trust me, I've got you.” John whispered hoarsely, slithering his way down Sherlock’s stomach and kissing the crease of his groin. He gently parted Sherlock’s cheeks with two slicked fingers and pressed them against the tightness of his hole. “Tell me. Tell me how it feels.”
"No." Sherlock smoothed his hands over John's chest, lingering over his scar, bumpy under his shirt. "Well, maybe a bit, yes. But…” He sighed, uncharacteristically fumbling for words, “I just don’t tell you enough, how gorgeous I think you are. How much I want you, all the time.”
He’s still shaking when Sherlock takes his hand off John’s softening prick and puts it sticky on his hip, wrenching him backwards. "Fuck. Fuck, you feel so good." Sherlock only curses when he's viciously angry or when he's about to come. Sherlock drives into him, so hard, harder than he’s ever done before, and John feels used, knows he’s purely for Sherlock’s pleasure right now and nothing else. That thought is obscenely and confusingly erotic. John allows himself to get lost in sensation, the rhythmic smack of Sherlock’s thighs against his, the pressure of Sherlock’s fingers between his own against the wall, the scrape of the uneven bricks against his knuckles.
“I am a very serious athlete, Rose. I need to keep up my strength,” John says with mock solemnity, and then his face crinkles as he bursts out laughing. “Ah, shit, I’m going to take a nap. Wake me when she comes with the trolley, yeah?”
Sherlock opens his eyes slowly. His eyelids are sticking together, the edges stinging, sandpaper rough. His mouth is horribly dry.
John tilted his head to the side, eyes skyward. His mouth ticked to the side in a half smile as he listened. “Jesus Christ. Even when we’re on bloody holiday.”
“Okay, Lester, just call me John, okay? We’ve been over this. First of all, my last name isn’t supposed to be Watson right now, so you say that to the wrong person, and there’s going to be some awkward questions I don’t want to answer, yeah? Also, fuck, we’re the same age. Don’t call me mister for fuck’s sake. It makes me feel like I’m your fucking father or some shit.” Lester winced every time John cursed. It gave him a perverse pleasure, made him curse more than usual.
They share a long look, the kind that only couples who have been together forever can share, the kind that communicate everything without making a sound.
into those luscious curls, and Sherlock just hums and twists their ankles together and burrows into John’s side as he falls asleep. John lays there, rubbing his fingertips over knobs of vertabrae and sliding them in between Sherlock’s ribs and stares up at the ceiling. He watches the flashes of car headlamps sweep across the ceiling and down the wall, and wonders why. Why Sherlock, who is in all other ways
"Well, alright. If you want to be boring about it. Us being enemies doesn't mean we can't have a little fun now and then..." Jim's eyebrow cocks up, in that expression of bored amusement that used to make Sherlock's stomach flip over.
“I never thought you wanted this - me - “ Sherlock’s mouth is everywhere at once, hot wet dragging tongue across John’s throat, his chin, dipping into his ear, gentle over the cut along his hairline.
This was the sort of motel you could ask questions and no one would care what you did with the answers. He threw on his jacket and went to the front desk.
"John, please, god, please," He was babbling now, he knew it, but he wanted it. Wanted to be taken, to be owned, to have John fill him up, with his cock, with his come. Oh god, how he wanted it.
"You see, Holmes," Watson drew back, panting slightly, his pink lips wet with our shared saliva, "Did I not tell you that absence makes the heart grow fonder?"
The sound of it burrowed down inside the dark places in John, all the places he'd been living for two years, and expanded. It pushed at the darkness, poked holes through the veil of misery John had draped himself in for so long. He couldn't deny it, as much as he wanted to. He was so angry and confused, but this was all he'd been wanting, just Sherlock, alive and sitting next to him.
"What? What?" John's voice so raspy and desperate, Sherlock's bottom lip laying between both of his.
Every time I see a bee I think of you, the stack of beekeeping magazines under our bed, the abandon with which you slather a piece of toast with creamed honey so sweet I can’t even stand a teaspoon of the stuff, but you eat a half a pint and don’t even flinch.
"Alright then. Let's get you outside. Come on." She slips an arm though Sherlock's and pats his hand. “Don’t drop your tea.”
John hums around him, sending sparks of electricity up Sherlock’s curving spine. He press the tip of his tongue against Sherlock’s frenulum, traces his foreskin, sucks harder and then gentler and harder again and skates a palm up over his belly. Sherlock grabs at his hand, and John laces their fingers together and squeezes.
John leaps from his seat again and grabs the bottom, stabilising it and helping Sherlock shove it up into place.
Not this. He didn't deserve this. He'd forsaken this comfortable, good life with people who loved him for something dirty and debauched. He didn't deserve to be standing here. His chest closed tightly. He couldn't get any air suddenly, black spots swimming in front of his eyes. John's knees buckled without warning and he grabbed at the lapels of the Belstaff as he felt himself sliding to the carpet.
John shakes his head, his teeth scratching just perfectly hard enough over the Sherlock’s frenulum to make Sherlock shiver down to his toes, clench his thighs against John’s ears, and moan John’s name to the ceiling.
Sherlock perched on the edge of the sofa, his smile tremulous and unsure. "Yes. Home. I even carried you over the threshold."
"I'll take care of the fare, thank you." She pulls thirty quid from an artfully embroidered little change purse and shoves it into the cabbie's hand. "Put your money away, Sherlock."
I pulled off my filthy travelling clothes and scrubbed my face and body perfunctorily with the stone cold water in the basin next to our bed, then took my clean dressing gown from the hook on the back of the door and wrapped it round my nude body. I did not plan to long have a need for clothing.
“Aren’t we? Our dates have always involved a threshold level of violence and the threat of imminent death. I’ve always found it quite an aphrodisiac.” Sherlock grins against John’s hand, his eyes flashing with mischief.
"Okay, baby. Okay. That's enough for now, for our first time with this. All done now." John leans over him, brushing his lips so gently over Sherlock's slap-reddened stomach. He darts his tongue out soft and soothing, lapping at the ridges of his ribs, over his nipples and along his sternum. He brings Sherlock's bound wrists to his mouth and kisses them, too.
“You’re not alone.” John whispers again, and takes Sherlock’s still mostly soft cock between his lips, digs his fingers into Sherlock’s hips.
John’s foot flexed and pushed against Sherlock’s back, his bollocks resting warm and soft against Sherlock’s cheek. “You -
, and I imagined I could see the baring of his teeth, like an animal in its heat. The thought of that, of him mounting me like a rutting stag, coaxed a howl out of me the likes of which I’d never heard before. The sound of it spurred John on, and I immediately felt him parting me, the blunt wide head of his cock pressing into me.
John’s sleepy smile deepened at the corners, his rarely seen dimples making a brief appearance as Sherlock reached over him to turn out the bedside light.
Sherlock ignored him. "Cairndow. There, I already rented us a cottage. Right off the A83, should be easy enough to find."
“You could trip on the bath rug.” Sherlock breathes, nudging his cheek against the side of John’s head.
“It’s getting much thicker now.” Sherlock ran his fingertips though the ginger curls on John’s cheek. “It’s softer this way.”
“Yeah.” Kiss swollen lips, John bites into the lower one and sends Sherlock a look rife with meaning, blazing hot. “You’re not going to get like you were last night, yeah?”
thing I’ve done right?” He’s already pleading, the nasal tone he loathes creeping into his voice. He just needs to hear it so badly. Needs to know that there’s something he’s not made a total bollocks of.
I responded in kind, curling my tongue along the slick underside of his and unconsciously rolling my hips against him. My neglected prick bumped into his belly, leaving wet marks on the soft cotton of his nightshirt. I shivered at the contact, at the tug of my foreskin against the fabric, and breathed a soft sigh into John’s mouth.
She smiled warmly at him and shook her head. “No. You’re fine. We’re not really supposed to, you know...you’re supposed to sleep in the fold out chair, but, this one. He needed somebody real bad. I guess you’re that somebody.”
The cabbie twisted and looked over the seat, frowning. “As long as he doesn’t puke all over my cab.”
The conversation stutters to a halt. They're both struggling. With how to get this going, how to talk about all these awkward and ugly and painful things face to face. All John can think about is touching Sherlock, feeling his body heat, his weight against him. There's too much space. They're never like this - separated - they're forever in each other's personal space. Personal space is barely a concept that exists between them. It's always hands brushing, hips bumping, resting the lengths of their thighs together, leaning over each other's shoulders with their cheeks pressed together. This distance is foreign, and disconcerting.
you asked. Always so careful with me. I nodded, I think. I don’t remember the in between parts. Your mouth was soft and hungry and your tongue was parting my lips so hesitantly I couldn’t stand it. I let my wine spill on the floor when I put my hands in your hair. Neither of us noticed. You tasted like kimchi and jasmine and you smelled like rain.
. Something out of a bad romance film. But as Sherlock’s hand slowly curves around John’s, he sees it. Their
"John. I've never seen you like this." He can feel his cheeks burning, arousal flushing his neck and chest.
For men so hopelessly bound to each other, they can sometimes barely speak to each other without stammering.
"Your turn, John?" Sherlock danced his fingers over the inside of John's wrist, and unfolded his legs so they were resting on top of John's thighs. He inched closer, arse against John's crossed calves. "May I?"
Everything reminded him of Sherlock. Breathing did. Every inhalation, exhalation. Every expansion of his lungs was something Sherlock would never do again.
it a game?” Sherlock languidly tongued at John’s navel, wetting the sparse trail of curls beneath it. “I thought you were quite serious about fucking me right into this floor until I can’t move.”
He sits cross legged across from John and John immediately straightens his legs to put his cold bare feet in Sherlock’s lap. It’s chilly out, the sun low in a brown sky. Sherlock passes around the pack and they all fumble to light their cigarettes, the wind whipping fast through the narrow alley. Harry takes a long drag and blows the smoke out of the side of her mouth.
die, but as long as he solves it, fixes it, makes sure the criminal gets his due, he can live with the fact that he can't possibly save everyone.
“Thought about what we’re getting yet?” John was allowing Sherlock to choose what design they were getting, since he honestly didn’t care, and it seemed important to Sherlock.
"Let's go to bed." John says, low and dark, mouthing wet kisses over Sherlock's jaw. "I want you right now."
They were going to be alright. Sherlock would make sure of it. John had always been there for Sherlock, and now it was his turn. Now it was his turn.
Their eyes keep meeting heatedly across the small house, promises caught in the full swell of Sherlock’s pouting mouth, in the way John licks his own. Their hunger for each other has gentled only slightly over the years. Most nights still end with panting breaths and entwined fingers against the pillows, with John smoothing curls away from Sherlock’s sweaty brow as they fall ragged and spent against each other.
"JOHN!" Sherlock tilts his head back and glares up at the windows of 221b, as if by willpower alone, he can make John appear at the curtain.
"Welcome home, John." Sherlock smiled so softly and fondly, his eyes alight with warmth, laugh lines crinkling round his mouth. He looked happier than John ever remembered him being.
John crouches down to build the fire, seemingly unconcerned about being two feet away from open flames and completely nude. Sherlock rolls to his side, watching him hungrily, because he’s allowed to. Allowed to want him, allowed to let his eyes roam over the movement of his back, the way his shoulder blades knit together when he reaches for a chunk of wood, the tension in his slim hips as he shifts his weight.
John leaves Sherlock to think, toes off his shoes and pads into the kitchen to make tea. He’s attuned to every detail - the slightly cardboard smell of the teabags, the grease spatter on the side of the electric kettle, the loose piece of countertop he’d always planned to fix but had never gotten around to.
Sherlock’s phone rings, the noise a shrill and unnerving noise in the quiet pub. Sherlock answers it quickly, his eyes never leaving John’s.
"So much for no strenuous activity." John laughs and rubs a hand over the incision low on his stomach.
“Ah, you’re lovely,” John whispers, slicking his cock with petroleum and shivering hard, curling his shoulders as his touches himself. He exhales a long calming breath, his cheeks very pink, and takes hold of Sherlock’s hips, tilts them up so Sherlock’s shoulder blades press into the mattress as his arse slides onto John’s bent knees. He leans down over Sherlock, bracing himself on one arm. “Lovely. I -
, and already he can’t imagine ever wanting anyone else, ever having anyone else twined around him at five in the morning, sleep sweaty and pink cheeked and beautiful. If he’s honest with himself, he hasn’t wanted anyone else since he met Sherlock. They waited so damned long, made every mistake it was possible to make, and still somehow miraculously ended up here, grinning at each other like teenagers over their morning coffees and trying to remember that crime scenes aren’t really appropriate places for impromptu blow jobs.
Sherlock looks up from his tented hands, his eyes wide and black, startled. He holds John in them, as surely as if they were physically connected. “Do you understand now?”
Sherlock sits back on his feet, and puts the parcel on the floor in front of him, carefully undoing the ribbon. He's so wantonly beautiful. His cock standing up hard and crimson against his pale stomach, those wicked lips already puffy from arousal alone, carefully opening his present like it's Christmas morning. John feels his own face going hot.
getting out of this? I need you to tell me what I’ve done right, because. I feel like I’ve done every fucking thing wrong.” The quiver in his voice can’t be helped, emotions rising high already, and John clings to Sherlock’s hand in his like the anchor that it is.
Don't exclude me, yeah?" John's been home at Baker Street for four months, four months of tiptoeing round each other, of aborted conversations and John trying not to stare when Sherlock walks nude out of the shower with a loose towel hanging on his perfect hips. Four months of awkward accidental touches, John's knee resting against Sherlock's on the sofa, a brush of thighs in the kitchen, Sherlock's arm draping behind John's shoulders in a cab. Four months of  carefully
.” Sherlock doesn’t sound unsure at all. Eyes sparkling, half a smile playing on his full lips, he twirls his wrist gracefully and takes John’s hand in his, palms pressed together.
“I’m going to want to kill you when I’m not trapped in a hospital bed. Do you have any fucking idea, Sherlock? What I’ve….the things I’ve done. I’m not a good person anymore.” He wanted to shout, to rip into him, but it just wasn’t there. The righteous anger he thought he’d have was tempered by awe. He started crying in earnest again, a surge of emotion caught in his throat. “I’ve done awful things, so many awful things...I can’t…”
.” John emphasises the last word with a long gentle lick up the side of Sherlock’s throat, and runs his hand down to still the now insistent roll of Sherlock’s hips against his body. “You want me to show you how I feel, then let me show you. No rushing.”
Sherlock finds himself temporarily lost for words, watching the strong straight line of John's back, the way he squares his shoulders and crosses his arms. The soldier, the doctor reemerging. Unflappable. That still rooted strength that Sherlock's always admired and that's been notably in short supply recently.
"I do actually. It's...not fancy, I mean, it's still not...but...it's safe. I sleep there every night. You could. If you wanted." Sherlock feels inexplicably nervous. He's going to say no. He's going to leave.
“What are you two doing out here? Curfew began fifteen minutes ago.” Professor Longbottom’s normally cheerful face is now suspicious. “Go on, get to your dorms.”
“One thing? There are more than one, I promise you. First one.” Sherlock’s head tilts marginally to the side, and he wrinkles his nose that way he does when he’s thinking. “You make me feel safe.”
"I was. She was...fascinating. In certain limited ways." Sherlock's hands skim up John's back, and down again. He curls a foot around John's ankle. "I was in love with
Sherlock nodded again. “But...I want to do what we talked about, I do. I really do.” He paused and bit into his lip hard enough to make the flesh around his teeth go white as the blood rushed away. “I want to...cut you, and I want you cut me, and I want to get our blood tattooed into each other skin. I haven’t changed my mind about any of it.”
The laugh bubbles up from deep down, and he turns to grin at John, yells in his ear, “I know, you don’t have to. You just stand there, alright?”
Allowing Mycroft to pull all the strings, make all the decisions, had clearly been a miscalculation. Sherlock would have found a way around Moriarty’s network from London, with John stalwart at his side, as always. He knew that now, understood there could have been a different way.
John takes a drag and blows it out slowly, hands it back to Sherlock. “So what are we going to do today?”
The sheets had been changed. God knows what the cleaning staff thought about all the blood. He lay down on the made bed and tucked his palms behind his head. It couldn’t be possible. Even if Sherlock was alive,
"Sherlock. You're very serious. Don't you want a hand job on our lovely new sofa? It's like a christening. Of sorts. Just not with holy water."
God, the last place he wanted to be was in that doilied and flowered hallway, heavy with the scent of twenty years of Mrs Hudson's cooking. "No. Just. I need to. Just stand here. Just for a minute."
“And I you, my boy.” John’s hand found the side of my face, his thumb stroking a path deliciously slowly over the whorl of my ear, the line of my jaw. He tipped his face up and met my mouth finally with his own, and I nearly sobbed with the relief of it.
John made a horrible choked whimper, and Sherlock couldn’t not touch him then, twisting so he could slip his arm back behind his shoulders and gather John to his chest. He stroked his fingers down the side of his face and kissed his forehead.
The memory of his father almost doesn’t hurt. It’s...fond. Like he might see him again. Be welcomed back with a clap on the back and a hot cuppa.
He doesn't know how long he stands in the middle of the sitting room, staring at the back of the door. It's long enough that his leg starts to hurt. He realises there's snot all over his mouth. His shirt is soaked. His knuckle is bloody and sore from where he tore the skin on the key hook. He stumbles into the bedroom and collapses on the bed, too numb and sick to even cry anymore. He doesn't even care enough to wipe his face. He gathers Sherlock's pillow to his face, breathes in the smell of his shampoo and his skin, and shakes and shakes.
They lapse back into silence. Walking past full skips, overflowing with trash, little kids playing cricket in the street with ragged balls and pipes for bats, far too late for them to be awake. Parents sitting in stairwells smoking and drinking out of plastic cups. It's steaming hot, the air smells like rubbish and stale piss. John’s looking around warily, his lips pinched in a tight line.
“Yeah. Saw the Prophet this morning. I suppose Potter isn’t happy about Angelina Johnson's wife Poppy - since Johnson is an old friend of his.”
Throughout dinner, their eyes meet frequently, and every time they do, it’s as though Sherlock’s entire body is alight. His limbs go wobbly, his head floaty light. Sherlock eats mechanically, knowing somewhere in the back of his mind that he’s hungry, but his entire focus is solely on John.
John sees a quick shadowy movement beyond the solid form of Sherlock flattening himself against the brick, but it’s not enough to take the shot. He throws one arm across Sherlock’s chest, and raises the barrel of his pistol to his own lips.
Sherlock eats the pickle in two bites, salt and celery seed tart on his tongue. John's watching him out if the corner is his eye, elbows on his thighs. Sherlock wipes pickle juice on his jeans, goes back to counting his money. Fuck. Not enough to get him through the night. One more trick, just one more. There’s always that greasy little fuck who always hung round the edges of Hackney Downs, watching the boys playing rugby. Maybe he's watched John before. He’s always up for it. Easy mark.
Heart hammering out of his chest, choking. He’s choking on his own breath, panic welling up in his throat. No one will even notice if he just...
That’s all he ever says, when he’s confused, upset, lost. Just John’s name. As if all he needs to ground him is John telling him it’s okay. It’s always awoken a fierce possessiveness in John, and now is no different, despite the circumstances.
“You look like you’re about to leap out of your skin, John. Are you alright?” Sherlock flops beside him and John immediately leans over and presses his lips to Sherlock’s.
“Oh, you’re back, Mr Holmes!” She turned as she set our breakfast down and beamed at me. “Well, welcome home, and I’ll have to go down and bring up some more scones, there’s only enough for Dr Watson and myself.”
"I'm sure that's not true." She tosses her cigarette and takes Sherlock's out of his hand, crushes it with her shiny green pump. "Now let's stop all this wallowing and go see how your young man is doing. What's his name, dear?"
’s and ridiculous pet names pour out of John with a rapidity and an earnestness he never imagined himself capable of. He’s never
“I’m not good here anymore, okay? I just...I can’t. I can’t be here without him. It’s eating me alive.”
He makes the tea strong, letting it steep until there’s little swirls of oil from the leaves spinning across the surface, and settles in his chair. There’s some random rugby match on the telly, and he stares at it, washing down soggy bites of bakewell with scalding tea. He sets the plate on the floor and pulls the little red journal off the side table, opens it to a blank page. He doesn't address the entries to Sherlock anymore, though Sherlock reads every one.
Sherlock can’t move. The flood of dopamine is making him feel drunk all over again. He lets John kiss his hand, wriggle back into him, twine their legs together. He remembers he wants to smell John’s skin after they have sex, rubs his nose against his neck where there are two blooming purple red bruises in the shape of Sherlock’s mouth.
"Well, so are we. So it's appropriate." John's reached his daily limit with Sherlock's strops. "Now help me find the box with the kettle and tea and biscuits in it, so we can at least eat before we collapse."
Sherlock stands in the doorway thinking of all the vile insults Mycroft would throw at him if he saw the depth of sentiment he had allowed himself.  He watches John sleep for just a moment, and then crosses the room stealthily, climbs silently into bed with John, the bag of money still pressed against his chest. He'll probably never even see Mycroft again. It's just himself and John now. Just the two of them against the rest of the world. He likes that thought.
I then took the other ring, and he held his hand out to me. I slowly pushed the ring on, watching as it slid over his knuckle, wanting to catalogue every second of this exchange in my mind. After the ring was on, John took my hand and laced our fingers together. I couldn’t think of anything to say that would be adequate for the situation, so I remained quiet, content to hold hands with this extraordinary man I had somehow been gifted with, and watch the fire burn down to cinders.
"...Mycroft. I've told you already. I don't know any Malvo. I met some weasley little man named Lester. That was it. No, John and I haven't discussed it...well, he's a bit fragile, Mycroft. Yes, fragile. Shall I spell it out for you? He had a small panic attack when we got home this morning, and he's been asleep for nine hours." Sherlock paused, pacing. He went and leaned a hand on the mantel, his silhouette tense and agitated, shoulders in a tight line.
“You fucked up with Moriarty, and you know it. Sherlock knows it, too, whether he wants to admit it to himself or not. But there’s no good reason Moriarty should have been allowed to do what he did to us, not with you being who you are. Something
John’s watching them with a crooked grin. “I told you we’d find her, Sherlock. Or, rather, she found us.”
He supposes every student must feel like Hogwarts is truly home, whilst still at school, but he knows Muggleborns feel it more acutely. Children of Wizarding families leave between terms and go to homes filled with spellbooks and brooms, magical creatures, shelves overflowing with potion bottles. While they’re still not permitted to perform their own magic, at least they’re surrounded by it.
A sliver of buttery yellow sunlight slants through the bed curtains. Alchemy’s gone, probably run off on some adventure with Thom’s black rat Midnight. Stretching, he feels the crackle of parchment under his thigh.
was right on the tip of his tongue, but he could feel Sherlock's eyes on him and he swallowed it back. Trying to be the old John. Old John would not shout at strangers. He smiled again. "Okay. I think I can -- Let's go inside."
“I’m supposed to take care of you.” He rested his forehead against Sherlock's, stroked his legs gently from ankle to thigh.
“Hi.” His voice was hoarse. He struggled up on one elbow and grabbed the glass of water he’d set on the bedside table hours ago, sloshing some on the floor as he gulped it. “How long have I been out?”
“No. I just…” He doesn’t want to tell her he’s only known John for little more than 48 hours. “Where the hell have you been, then? Why didn’t he come to you?”
Now this one with his strident Midwestern accent was the worst yet. He looked right enough, but the minute he spoke...John couldn’t bear him one more second.
They eat Indian food with their fingers, bits of naan and samosa crumbs spread across the coffee table, and share spicy chai tea in front of the fireplace. John forgets to call Mary and they fall asleep practically on top of each other in bed and wake up the same way, Sherlock breathing sleep sour into John’s mouth. John pulls Sherlock down and Sherlock pushes up, up, up, close and hard, his belly shivering, and they ruin their pyjamas and have to take another shower. John can't stop smiling.
Sherlock doesn’t believe in god. He’s a scientist. Even now, still the scientist. He’s never prayed, he doesn’t see magic when he looks up at the sky, just burning gases and infinite emptiness. But as John Watson falls asleep on his shoulder, humming little noises that have no right to be as welcome familiar comforting beautiful as they are, he looks up at the stark white ceiling and whispers
“Thank you.” Sherlock didn’t know precisely what he was thanking her for, but it didn’t seem necessary to. He sank back trying to get as comfortable as he could, his tailbone bruised from a night spent sitting up on a thin mattress in the same position.
"Shhh, okay, I know, baby." John slithers forward, dips his head and licks at the crease between Sherlock's thigh and hip, the musky scent of arousal filling his nostrils. Sherlock tastes like sweat and pheromones, dark and intoxicating. John pushes at the backs of Sherlock's thighs, bends his legs back until he's spread obscenely wide, with his knees at his shoulders. John runs his hands all the way from the perfect arch of Sherlock's pointed feet to the luscious soft swell of his hip. He can hardly believe this incredible person belongs to him. "Christ."
“I know.” Sherlock licked around the base of John’s now fully hard cock, pressing his tongue hard into the velvety smooth skin, and rubbed the end of his nose against it, inhaling the sleep sour musk. Delightful. He pushed John’s bollocks up against his body, kneading slowly, and John jerked hard, reached the hand not in Sherlock’s hair down to thread his fingers through Sherlock’s between his legs. He squeezed, tightening their entwined fingers around his bollocks, and let out a long
“I wish more than anything that I could have told him what happened. But I can now.” Molly squeezes Sherlock’s elbow. “I will now. I promise.”
.”  Sherlock ruffled his hands through his own hair and bit his lip in a way he knew made John a bit squirmy. “Everything about you is fascinating, John. I don’t know how you manage it.”
When they walk into Speedy's to order their fried eggs and toast, their fingers are securely twisted together and they kiss while they wait for the food, Sherlock leaning over the table to press his mouth to John's while he twines his ankle around John’s calf, and they smirk at each other and don’t speak, because there’s no need, because whatever walls existed between them no longer do, because it was always about this, always about
He smelled like sleep and perspiration, still faintly like alcohol. John hummed and shifted, tensing his back muscles against Sherlock’s now nuzzling face. Sherlock’s shiver had nothing to do with the cold room. It occurred to him that they hadn’t made love in more than ten days. John had been late at work and at rugby practice, and Sherlock had met him at practices, and then stopping for quick dinners on the walks home. By the time they got back to the flat each night, John was sore and exhausted, ready for a hot shower and a soft bed. Mornings had been hurried, both of them waking late and John rushing out the door to work.
“Are you alright?” Slightly alarmed, wondering if he hurt him, if he’s upset, wishes they’d waited. A thousand anxieties rise up in Sherlock’s throat at the sight of tears on John’s face.
Sherlock didn’t know what he was supposed to say in this dead air. Anything that didn’t sound like judgement, like a rejection. “Alright.”
Sherlock fixes John with a glare and shakes his head free of John's hands. He rears back as far as he can with the counter behind him, pushes John back. Away from him. "I would appreciate it if you didn't
“John. John, what’s wrong?” Sherlock closed the gap between them and took his hand, heedless of who was around them.
“Well, hello. Is this your idea of fashionably late?” John set his half drunk beer on the coffee table and cocked an eyebrow at Sherlock.
Kissing turns into half sleeping, legs folded together, holding hands. They're sticky and sweaty, and John's bare feet are hanging out of the bottom of the blanket and freezing cold, and he doesn't think he's ever been more content in his life.
“Nope. You.” John leans down, drags his mouth gently along Sherlock’s throat. Sherlock’s arms close around his back automatically.
Sherlock touches his fingertips to them, but doesn't smile. He pecks a quick kiss on John’s cheek. “Yes. Thank you.”
The nurse came in, Lester retreated to a corner as she cleaned up the vomit and checked John’s vitals. She crossed the room and closed the window, twisting the lock firmly. Then she returned to John to remove the thermometer from his mouth. She patted him on the arm, her eyes lingering on the cuts he’d given himself. Their eyes locked, and she allowed her sleeve to hitch up a little, showing purple and white shiny lines across her wrists. They stared at each other, and John felt something dislodge in his chest.
There’s a thunderstorm brewing outside, the result of weeks of unseasonable heat and moisture, and now the onslaught of suddenly cool autumn air. The thunder rumbles and a flash of white streaks across the window almost simultaneously. The lights flicker. Sherlock gives John a wicked grin, and John returns it, a knowing glint in his eyes. John's so in sync with him, even as different as they are, Sherlock understands for the first time what
"Something like that." His voice comes out thick and rough. He turns away from her and stares out the window as the bus pulls away from the curb.
Sherlock peers around the bedroom doorway and into the loo as Jim shuts the front door with a profoundly final sounding click. Sherlock fights against the panic rising in his chest.
John turns slowly, on his good side, and melts into Sherlock’s chest, his body heavy and chilled. His hands are freezing. Sherlock wraps his arms around his shoulders, and tucks his face into his hair, rubs his nose back and forth. Sherlock's wracked by long shuddering exhalation, relief, and fear, and guilt making it hard to breathe properly.
"Yes, John. Thank you." Sherlock's voice trembles, his head dropping back against John's. "How did you know I would - ?"
“Sorry I was out so long, love. Why didn’t you wake me?” John yawned and dragged his hands up and down his face and through his hair, making it stand on end.
“Okay.” Sherlock allows John to help him up, and he leans against him, watching his face in the dim light as he bends down to pick up the torch on the floor. “You’re so beautiful. I want to go dancing with you. I love to dance. Did I tell you that?”
“You don’t need to be in a spy movie to have your house monitored.” John locked eyes with him. “And I’m not having you say a fucking word about what this is all about until we’re sure, yeah?”
"I could help you there, gorgeous." John's nose parted the curls at the nape of Sherlock's neck, lips wet and hot against his skin.
was the variable, the one singular requirement in John’s life. It would have been exhilarating spending the last thirty years managing a second hand bookshop in Yorkshire if Sherlock had been at his side.
Sherlock reaches down, palms up, and John takes his hands, lets himself be pulled up to standing. Standing quickly after laying down for hours makes his head swim and he wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist to steady himself. Sherlock responds immediately, smoothing his hands up John’s back with a throaty hum and pulling him against his chest. Their height difference is always the most obvious in this position, John’s head fitted perfectly into the gentle curve of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, smelling Sherlock’s deodorant, their laundry soap, the lingering scent of garlic and peppers from cooking.
At least if we were caught in those circumstances, I could pass for a girl and John would get in much less trouble than if I were dressed as myself.
“I told you the other night, do not fucking call me that, that is just...weird.” John makes a face, scrunching up his nose endearingly, and pokes at Sherlock’s thigh. “We’ve known each other for a week today, you know.”
"I can't believe you're real." He traced over Sherlock's face, mapping it, memorising the feeling of his skin, drifted his hand down under his jaw. Sherlock swallowed against his fingers, and John kept his fingers there, the feeling of Sherlock's esophagus moving the most wondrous thing he'd ever felt.
