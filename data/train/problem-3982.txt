"Do you?" Castiel squeezed Dean's hand, "cuz the Dean Winchester I know would be blaming himself for my pain."
“Lailah, please.” Castiel laid a hand on her back, careful not to send over any of his grace just yet. She calmed but continued to say nothing as she glared at the nephilim. “Let me take you back to the motel.” He offered. “If we can’t heal you then we still need to treat the wound for your vessel.”
He lifted his eyes at his name being shouted close to his face. A blurry Sam was in front of him now, hands gripping his shoulders. When did Sam get in front of him? Sam looked behind him and shouted. Or well, he looked like he shouted, he couldn’t actually hear anything anymore. When had that happened?
“No...not go away, that was the wrong words, I mean...” Dean raked his hands down his face. “Fuck, I don’t even know what I mean.”
Everything felt amazing. With each soft swipe of fingers over the head of his cock, arousal coiled deep in his groin. His cock continued to twitch as Michael played with it; he hadn’t grabbed it, he just used soft touches and gentle brushes along the vein underneath. Every breath and gasp that passed his lips seemed too loud in the small space, Michael’s touch threatened to overwhelm his senses. He was finally relaxing into the arousal, succumbing to the desire stirring within him.
Castiel closed his eyes and laid his head back as far as his neck would allow. The tension in his thighs slowly released as he submitted to Michael's ministrations.
Castiel looked out the window of the new back door Dean had replaced while he was in the hospital. It didn’t quite match the rest of the house, but according to Dean it would once they finished the renovations Dean kept talking about. The snow was falling slowly through the back porch lights and, from what he could see of the backyard, had been for a while.
"Dean, I didn't say anything because I wasn't sure what was real. I-I needed to solve my crap before I threw you into it."
“Fuck.” The omega moaned, his hips pressing back against his alpha. Castiel smiled. He began pounding into his omega, grunting with wild abandon. He slipped his hand back towards his omega’s cock again and gripped it tight.
Dean looked him in the eyes and just stayed there. He wasn’t sure what exactly Dean was trying to find, whether it was an answer to the mess in the kitchen or how the once angel wasn’t capable of wrapping his own hand. Castiel, though, found sympathy in his green eyes as they searched. He’d grown to understand human emotion better and better as the years dragged on, or better yet he had grown to understand Dean’s emotions better and better. Ninety percent of the time he spent with other humans was with only Dean so he wasn’t quite up to par with other humans, but he was up to par with the hunter. Right now, he didn’t like the sympathy been thrown at him. He was a human, not a child.
Castiel grabbed a couple beers out of the fridge while Dean filled his plate with another burger and brat (his third plate). Once they were both happy with what they had, they went back outside.
Man did this chapter kick my butt!! I put in about 15 hours of overtime this past week and of course it was also memorial day weekend so I didn't have as much time as I wanted to do this chapter. I'm not sure if I like it but I'm just glad it's finished!
Out of frustration, he took the steps too fast and tripped, slamming his non covered toes into the next stair. He yelled out in pain, hopping up the remaining step. The frustration from the day and the now very human pain throbbing in his foot sent his anger into overdrive. Curling his fingers while he spun on one foot, he drew back and threw his fist into the back door; shards of wood exploding into the home as his fist went through it. He grunted as his body kept moving forward from the momentum and he ended up shoulder deep in his door. The surprise caught him off guard and his shoulders relaxed, a new pain slowly trickling up his forearm. Tilting his head forward, he pressed his head against the door and took a deep breath. He would say “what could be worse” but he already knew the answer to that question.
“Uh, nothing that I can remember.” He lied. Jack didn’t need to know about his odd dreams, especially when they revolved around him being dead. There was no telling how he would react.
Sweat dripped down Castiel’s back as he continued his daily workout, the shade from the giant old oak tree doing nothing to protect him from the unforgiving sun. Milo stayed sprawled out a few feet away in the most shaded patch of grass beneath the tree, eyes wide as they chased the gnats flying around him. The cat normally spent his days wandering around the property, usually only coming around for food, but today was different. On days like this one, Milo was known to stick close to Castiel, as if he was his personal body cat. He would never admit it out loud to Dean, but he was almost certain the cat knew what he was doing. That Milo could sense when he was distressed and knew that just his presence would help keep him calm. At least that’s what he likes to tell himself. Having a companion cat usually made him feel better, today was different; it always was.
“I still think the tree is leaning to the right.” Dean said, his head tilted trying to figure out the tree.
This was meant to be much much longer but with this chapter being over a day late and it starting to drift over 5k words, I decided to cut it off here. Sam and Human!Cas to come in the next chapter! Don't be afraid to let me know what you think :)
It made sense. Separate them from their packs and do experiments on them? Why else would they seperate them as they had? Although, why had they captured them at all? Sure the nationalists believed humans like him were feral and dangerous, but he never ever imagined they’d do something like this. Or maybe he had known and just refused to see it. Balthazar had been trying to get him to go to marches and protests for Alpha and Omega rights, but he never did. He hadn’t seen the point at the time. Some people were just going to hate him and people like him and no amount of marching would have changed that. At least that’s what he had thought then. Being captured and thrown into a dome as a prisoner changed his views just a little bit. He wished with all his heart he could go back in time and listen to Balthazaar and join the protests and march in the streets with an Alpha flag in his hands. He was a human fucking being and deserved to be treated as one.
"Thank fuck." Dean stumbled forward into Sam as the one guard threw him forward. "Here. Don't let him get away."
“Jack,” Lailah started, “can you sense which direction the soul went next?” Jack closed his eyes again, turning towards the lake.
Milo went nuts, meowing and circling around Castiel's feet as he grabbed the food and trudged towards Milo's bowl to fill it. “You act as if you've been starved to death.” Milo ignored him and nudged his way past the pouring container to get to his bowl causing some food to spill onto the floor before Castiel has a chance to pull away.
He could hear someone whimpering now. Flicking his eyes behind Dean, he saw Sam standing there, eyes fixed on him, but not crying. He looked back at Dean and saw that he too was not crying.
Amelia chuckled, her eyes warm. “I sit all day. Plus, feeding Claire certainly comes with perks." She lifted and flexed an arm. "I’ve more muscle now than I’ve ever had before.”
Dean cleared his throat, grabbing both Sam and his attention. “Guys, I know talking about Jack is hard but…”
Castiel shifted in his seat as he was pulled back from his thoughts. The nephilim was always very blunt and, at times, he appreciated that. This time he had wished there was a little more warning.
Thank you so much to those clicking in and reading this fic. I don't have a beta reader so all the mistakes are mine and mine only. This chapter was so much fun to write! I cut it off early since it was going on for a lot longer than I had intended. We're finally getting into the main plot point and its exciting!
Castiel's optimism was short-lived. By midday, he was feeling the inevitable rage seeping through his consciousness. His skin constantly damp, his heart rate pulsing rapidly in his chest, his mind consistently chanting
Michael's hands stopped above his belly button, only his thumbs caressing Castiel’s middle. "You're shaking," he whispered.
Castiel gave a small wave back. “I will. Promise. And say hi to Sam for me!” Castiel stayed where he stood, listening as Dean climbed into the Impala and started the engine before backing out of the gravel driveway.
"Pleasepleasepleaseplease." His need for release grew stronger and stronger until he was teetering on the edge of orgasm. Castiel could feel sweat dripping all over his face as he bucked his hips and thrust into Michael's tight fist relentlessly.
Dean shuffled to face him on the couch. He slipped his hand into his pocket and pulled something out. “I need you to understand just how much you mean to me. How important you are.” Dean opened his hand, a small silver band sitting inside his palm. “I love you, Cas. I love how adamant you are to drink coffee before facing the world. I love how you can’t sleep without tea at night. I love how much you love that stupid cat,” Castiel gave a wet laugh, “I love how you can never let me leave for work without saying goodbye first. I love that you hate jeans and prefer wandering around in those ratty pairs of sweats you refuse to throw out.” Dean laughed through his own tears. “I love that you get excited to eat the new recipes I cook, and I love how you hold me close on those nights when I have nightmares.”
Jack/Haley nodded. “I’m fine for now. I only have a few minutes before I get stuck. I just wanted hug you for the first time.”
Sam continued to push him down the curved hallway. "The founding company, Morningstar, has started a new program and we can’t figure out what it is. The group i’m with, our methods are changing to try and keep up, but-” Sam paused long enough for Dean to turn and face his little brother. “-the plan to get you out hasn’t changed. No matter what, in the evening of day three, we’re moving. You’re getting out, Dean. All of you.”
Castiel sighed, sitting down on the bed across from the nephilims. He wished he could do more for Jack than just ease his nightmares. He'd been through enough as a new soul, with losing his mother, being trapped in another world with strangers, then being tasked with killing his father. He was only a year old. Castiel didn't remember his first year very well, but he knew he never had come close to dealing with the things Jack had.
So, Dean is figuring out what the scent bond means to him. Was it a good idea that he eavesdropped on his and Inias's argument? Think he'll ever actually talk to Cas about it?
His breaths started coming out in pants. If he could just focus on the logs then the thoughts would go away. They had to. The color of the flames that engulfed them. The sounds they made as the fire burned in and around them...
Dean's pulse thumped heavily in neck. They hadn’t done that last time. Had Cas not pulled out quick enough? Was he? Bile started to rise in his throat. He couldn't be pregnant, he just couldn't. Not here. Not like this.
“Maybe I should call into work. Stay here with you in case it happens again?” His eyes met Castiel and they stared at one another for a moment. He was letting Castiel choose. For some reason that realization made a warmth build in his chest. For the second time today he was reminded why he loved this man.
“Hey, are you okay?” Castiel looked over and saw Dean staring at him, his green eyes shining with concern. He looked away and down at Dean's hands, a washcloth lightly dripping through his fingers.
Jack turned back to Tanya as she cried. “She...she has more to say.” The woman sniffled, giving Jack her full attention. Castiel squinted. Something was wrong.
Castiel sighed as Dean ran the cold cloth over his skin, cleaning up the now dried cum on his chest. His skin felt alive as the sensations from the cold water and the cloth moved over his body, as if these feelings alone were going to piece him back together.
before I graduate, and heard about you and thought, maybe this would help me find… confidence? I don't know. Does that make me strange?"
Castiel missed them like this. The two of them laughing and spending time together. Sure they worked together five days a week and every once in a while Dean would come home late after going out to dinner with Sam or just going and getting a few drinks, but this, sitting in their backyard, talking, eating, laughing, and having a few beers; he knew it had been far too long. In fact he couldn’t remember the last….
There was a tremor in Castiel's hands as he started to remove his hoodie. Michael's eyes stayed locked on him. He watched as Castiel pulled the hoodie up and over his head, folded it, and laid it at the end of the futon. The hunger in Michael’s eyes made him even more anxious. He tried to go slow, toying with the hem of his shirt for a few moments to buy him some time to regain his composure. Eventually, he knew that he'd have to drop his pants, and they'd get down to business.
Micheal shrugged. Castiel was shocked at how casual he was being. He wondered if it was because Michael had done this many times, with many different men, or if that was just how people who enjoyed sex were? Balthazaar never seemed anxious when he brought back his one night stands, and those he brought over never seemed to be apprehensive either. Maybe his friend was right, and he was overthinking the matter? Sex was supposed to be fun, right? So, why worry?
“The Winchesters. You’ve spent most of your time with them. Why does their opinions of you matter so much?” She asked genuinely. He knew that most of the angels disliked the Winchesters, but having them actually ask why, that was new.
A familiar sting spread through his neck and shoulders before Castiel dropped to the ground. The last thing he saw before everything went black was the look of panic on Inias's face.
Michael winked, and Castiel blushed. "Don't apologize; it's fine." Michael studied him for a moment before clapping his hands against his thighs. "You want water? Soda?"
Dean squeezed him tighter. "I don't know yet, but I'm going to do everything I can to get them back to you. All of them.” Dean stepped out of Castiel’s grasp. He placed his hands on either side of the alpha’s face and brushed a few tears away with his thumbs. He was giving the alpha false hope, but Dean still planned to deliver as best he could.
“I don't know.” Castiel shook his head. “One moment I was drinking my coffee and the next I was having a panic attack.”
The laughter died within him. Oh no. He did remember the last time. It was last year at the same time. How could he have forgotten? This was the worst day of Castiel’s year and he had forgotten already? What did that mean?
“I am aware of that.” Dean scolded quietly, scooting closer and taking Castiel’s hand anyways. A part of him wanted to fight back and wrap his hand himself, but another part of him knew he’d been sitting in this bathroom for the past hour failing miserably to do just that.
"Always, alpha." Inias purred. Castiel watched as the boy shifted and sniffed at Castiel's wrist. "You smell good."
"I know,” Dean pulled the alpha back into a hug, eyes hard as he tried to think about what his next steps would be, “and I keep my promises."
He spotted Amelia rocking Claire not far behind him. Her eyes were watching him, a strange look on her face. Plopping a strawberry into his mouth, he decided to head over to her.
He glanced up at food in the pantry as he put the broom back, his first instinct being to grab some food and eat it. When he first became human he had a hard time knowing when to eat and when not to eat, just waiting until his body hurt. Dean had gotten upset with him far too many times so he had done some research. The internet told him to eat periodically throughout the day but to also eat at least 3 full meals. Building a routine had helped him through the years but today had broken that routine. He wasn't necessarily hungry, but shouldn't he eat something? The thought of Dean coming home and learning he hadn't eaten all day made him cringe. Best to just eat something than to have Dean be upset with him out of worry. Sighing, he grabbed the box of Raisin Bran and pulled the milk out of the fridge.
"Look," Dean started, his voice low and gruff, "I talked to Sam and he told me that I shouldn't push, but, " Dean paused, his fingers grabbing a few blades of grass and pulling, "I gotta understand what happened, man."
The feeling of Milo laying on his back pulled him out a little bit. Forcing the panic down, he focused on the weight on his back as the cat climbed up and laid down. Milo started purring, the vibrations acting as a sooting massage, melting away his panic as the cat purred in his ear. Everything felt like too much and yet not enough but the purring ball of fur was helping.
Slowly extracting his arm from the door, the pain from his toe still throbbing, he surveyed the damage. Lines of pink and red scratches covered his arm, small beads of blood scattered along almost every one. His hand was the the worst. Blood coated his hand from the much larger cuts, a small piece of wood protruding from it. He whimpered as he carefully gripped the piece and slowly pulled it out, more blood pooling in behind it. Using his good hand, he opened the door and headed inside. A rag that was left on the counter from the laundry caught his eye and he grabbed it, wrapping it around his bleeding hand as he made his way upstairs towards the master bath. He was sure Dean had a medical kit around somewhere.
Castiel shook his head, blinking as he became aware of his surroundings. Dean was standing right in front of him, one hand on Castiel's left cheek. “W-what?”
"Good boy." Castiel inhaled in surprise at the sensation he felt from the praise; this guy was going to be the death of him. Michael kept his chin hooked over Castiel's shoulder as he whispered. "I'm going to walk you through what's going to happen, okay?
Neither man said anything as Dean cleaned his hand, seasoned fingers caressing the broken hand carefully with every hiss and grunt from the non angel. Every once in a while when Castiel would shift in his chair from the pain, Dean would softly shush him or slide his thumb comfortingly along the side of his hand. The actions helped keep him quiet and from pulling his hand away. He knew it needed to get done and whining or being difficult wasn’t going to help. Dean barey flinched at all, practiced movements almost predicting every flinch or hiss from the damaged once angel human.
Sam turned in Castiel's peripherals and joined him. There were multiple different kinds of these icicle lights and Castiel admired the photos on the boxes.
“True,” Lailah started, “but we also were walking along the road. It wasn’t until we got close to the tracks that we started to sense anything.”
“Cas?!” Castiel looked up from the discarded ace bandage still hanging half wrapped around his still bleeding and now throbbing hand as he sat on the toilet seat. He had wanted to get it wrapped before Dean had come home but he clearly had failed.
She cood in his ear and pulled him into a hug. He instinctively put his nose right to her scent gland, taking in the calming scent of mother and home.
The omega lifted his head as Castiel continued to pound into him. His knot was starting to catch at every push providing the perfect amount of friction, but his omega needed to come first. The omegas cock was hard in Castiel's fist and he could feel the heat emanating off his omegas sweat-soaked skin.
Dean laughed a groan as he plopped down onto the couch. “Oh man, you guys aren’t gonna play Scrabble are you?”
Sitting down, Castiel looked up at the horizon just visible through the line of trees at the edge of the property. The sun was just starting to finally set, casting the scattered clouds in an orange-ish, purple-ish hue. If he didn’t know better he’d say the sky was actually a beautiful painting, one made just for them by their missing friend.
"What?" Dean’s pulse raced as he processed the new information. The pups being taken must have been what Sam had tried to warn him about. If the people responsible for capturing them were taking pups, then it made sense that plans would be changing.
Dean threw his arms around Sam’s shoulders and pulled him close. He couldn’t fully scent Sam through the black turtle neck and uniform, but the possibility was close enough to calm him. Sam embraced him tight pulling a small laugh through Dean's lips.
THANK YOU SO MUCH to those who have commented. Your input kept me motivated to keep digging to figure out what was wrong with this chapter. I hope it was worth the wait!
The souls he had helped round up the past few weeks were not as active as this one seemed. Hopefully Lailah would have some ideas when they meet in the morning.
Eventually Dean looked away and grabbed Castiel's coffee mug out of his hands and set it down on the counter. “Well, maybe you should lay off the coffee and take a nap?” He offered, eyes round with question as he met his gaze again.
Castiel pulled Dean into his chest tighter. He didn't remember the last time he felt as happy as he did with Dean. Not since Balthazar, at least. Being with Dean was the happiest he had felt ever since that awful night. Sweat started to bead at his forehead and he sighed, his fingers lightly grazing Dean's shoulder. With them both being awake now, his rut was making itself known more. Though, he was surprised just how calm it was still being.
Christmas music crackled through the speakers as they meandered through the Christmas decorations in the local Farm N Fleet. Castiel followed Sam, quietly contemplating the use of the fake tree branches pulled into circles with bows. He'd seen them in years past, the homes in town all sporting at least one on their front doors, but never knew why. Humans had interesting decorative ideals.
Dean took his hand back and wiped both on his pants."No, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to make you feel bad. Sam was right, I shouldn't have said anything." He stood up and started to walk away.
“Thank you, for healing me earlier.” She said, shoulders slightly more relaxed than they had been. “Perhaps when all this is over, finding the souls, we could work together.”
Michael chuckled and stepped away from the door. There was nothing outwardly intimidating about him; under his plaid shirt was a white undershirt, he wore ripped dark jeans and socks with smiling pizzas on them. However, there was something about the way Michael carried himself and held Castiel’s gaze that made him want to drop to his knees and do anything Michael asked. It wasn't the first time he'd found a man attractive. Still, it was his first time feeling aroused by a man he was going to be intimate with--especially someone as ridiculously hot as this man who he had literally paid to do things to him that he’d only ever fantasized about.
Dean swallowed. “For not teaching you poker. For not celebrating christmas. For not paying attention when you needed me the most.”
“Yea..”, he cleared his throat, trying to find an excuse Dean would believe, “I didn't sleep well last night, I'm just tired is all.” Looking back up at Dean he gave a small smile. Dean continued to frown at him, eyes flitting back and forth between Castiel's eyes as if studying his answer. He always did that and Castiel loved him for it.
"Yes, alpha! Please!" The omega whined, rolling his hips back on Castiel's cock and thrusting forward into Castiel's fist.
The sound of crunching rocks had all three of them looking up. Jack was making his way towards them. There was a new energy surrounding the nephilim but he couldn’t quite make out what it was.
Castiel removed his hand as the nephilim slowly turned more before walking back towards the tree line. The two angels followed silently, uncertainty pulling at Castiel’s own grace. It wasn’t that he didn’t believe the nephilim, he just wasn’t sure what to make of the new information. Jack being able to sense more than him concerned him. How was he supposed to help the nephilim navigate his powers if he didn’t know what the nephilim could sense?
Amelia looked to Kelly, who sighed and looked towards the guard’s entry door. The door was barely visible through the surrounding trees, a perfect hiding spot from their watchful eyes. "The guards delivered our rations."
Michael slowly slid his hands side to side over Castiel's abdomen. "You're going to sit in this chair," he indicted the desk chair to their right, "and, I'm not only going to give you the best handjob of your life but edge you until you're begging me to let you come."
"Come on, alpha. You need to finish eating before your rage takes over." Castiel sighed, his smile still on his lips. "Don't give me that sass." Dean chuckled, kissing his forehead before pushing up on his shoulders.
“Stop,” Dean whispered, curling in on himself and screwing his eyes shut, as if that would help end the voice in his head.
Dean stood in front of the shower. He had been there so long that he was pretty sure that most of the hot water would be gone. He needed to be clean, to be rid of Michael’s stench, even though deep down he knew that a simple shower couldn’t fix that, yet he couldn’t bring himself to get in the water.
“It’s okay,” Dean whispered, putting his thumbs over the top-facing muscles of the little blue heart. It calmed under his touch. He now held it almost entirely encapsulated by his hands. “It’s okay, Cas. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you……...”
The moment those words came out of Dean’s mouth, Castiel realized something vitally important: Dean Winchester was the biggest idiot alive.
Over, and over, and over, and over—both for real and through some fucked-up time loop. Over and over and over. I’m tired of coming to the same conclusions, and I have been for a long time. But……but how was I supposed to know? How was I supposed to know that I….? That you……?”
Dean looked up and tried to look off into the distance. It was like he was looking with his eyes closed. They could gain no purchase on any beam of light or anything real. The magnitude of this
Here he was. He’d reaped what he’d sown, and here he was, watching it flutter in his hands as if it wasn’t going to be taken away with the wind like the rest. It shrunk down to something dim and small, moving erratically, like the wings of a butterfly trying to gain enough wind to fly. Dean was struck with the fragility of it all. Maybe Cas’ heart had always been this way, underneath the scar tissue of being alive. Maybe he’d always been something small.
He couldn’t remember a time he’d ever passively let his sadness consume him. He’d always met it with resistance and rage, struggling with it until the very end. Life had put through him every possible trial and he’d always come out the other end, but losing Cas for good was the one thing he couldn’t stomach. There was no way he’d ever come out of that a whole person. Not anymore.
understand, Dean?” Castiel asked simply, flicking his gaze to meet Dean’s once again. “Your love. Your heart. I can give you everything you want, but if you don’t understand, I’ll be screaming myself bloody. I’ll always bleed for you, but that on its own won’t make you happy.”
It didn’t make a sound when he pulled Cas’ heart out. He’d expected it to. He’d anticipated the grisly sound of flesh ripping away from flesh, the sickening sound of blood breaking free from its veins; a lifetime of senseless murder and irrevocable violence preparing him for something that never came. The heart stopped oozing as Dean pulled it free of its confines. In an instant, all the blood that’d entrenched it a moment before had dried and cleared, leaving behind the soft pink exterior unmarred.
He turned his eyes back up to Cas’ intolerable face and grabbed ahold of it, his thumb resting opposite of the rest of his fingers, cupping the part of his face he assumed to be his jaw. He couldn’t see his facial construction clearly, as the vision of him was ever-changing, but he got the impression in his mind of where to touch. He simply knew.
It was like talking without saying, in a sense. This time, however, was different. You see, the world had started anew on this night. Things were starting over. The throne was passed down, the lineage of the Creator transferred down, and the two men had been thrust into the real definition of
“I can’t, Cas,” Dean heaved. His mouth felt so dry. He knew exactly what Cas wanted him to take, and he was scared. He didn’t feel strong enough. “You need it. I don’t want to. I need you to come home. I can’t touch it. You…. You need to understand. Not with……. N-not…” Dean trailed off. He looked down at his own hands, and the one Cas held.
It was a cold December night. The bunker creaked and groaned under the weight of the snow outside and the freezing metal of the pipes. Dean should’ve been asleep, but he wasn’t. He never was. He was instead sitting at the little table in the kitchen, hand grasping an empty glass. All the lights were off. He stared blankly over at the fridge. He hadn’t stayed up to get anything done, like he would have done at a different point in his life. He simply sat down and stared at nothing at all.
this massive force that could help everyone, but….but no hands. No way of picking it up, and no way to put it down, either. It took me so fucking long to understand what it was, but when I did….it-it-it didn’t make anything better. It made it all worse. All this love, this care, this
If Dean Winchester looked back over his life, he wouldn’t see many things he liked. Hell, he wouldn’t be able to watch most of it without feeling sicker than a dog. Every step he’d taken since the moment he was born had felt like a never-ending fight to take his last. Walking here, in the Empty, with an actual supernatural force weighing him down, felt no different than every morning he’d woken up and stared at whatever godforsaken ceiling had been over his head; but he couldn’t do it this time. Dean had found a way to live for the little things in the spaces in between, but he’d been lying to himself in a way he simply couldn’t comprehend. To finally let go- to finally understand the previously incomprehensible feeling in his heart, to come to terms with his life as it was when it came down to the bare bones of things- was simply too much. He’d seceded his will to go on countless times before this, in life and in death, but this was different. This was more personal than that. This wasn’t him forfeiting his will to live, but his right and duty to live as a whole. His essence, as it were, could wither no further.
When Dean came back to himself and opened his eyes, he saw something. Out of the darkness of the Empty, a light- blue, flickering, swirling itself into existence like a fine mist slowly coagulating- sprung forth from the chaos of Nothing. Slowly, other colors and lights began to appear and join the first, rearranging itself into something more palpable than a thinly spread apparition. It gained two legs and four arms, then attached themselves to a torso of swirling, incalculable proportions. A heart, visceral and as living and palpable as he’d ever seen one, grotesquely formed itself in the middle of the being’s torso, right where its stomach should’ve been. Wispy lines of spider-silk veins sprouted from the heart and wrapped around the rest of the body in elegant brambles of pure energy. Behind the being sprung an unknowable number of wings, all feathered and incorporeal and undulating with a sort of restless power he’d never known. He couldn’t tell their color, for they weren’t a color at all, but rather, a mass of stars and raindrops and every quaking moment before a lightning storm. Lastly, from the brambles of energy sprouted a head, and a face grew forth from which Dean could not fully comprehend. He imagined that there may have been a time where setting eyes upon this face would’ve wiped his existence off the map, and he would’ve looked away before he had the chance; he didn’t do that now. Dean gazed upon this face like he’d been hungering for it for eternity. Maybe he had.
“Sure. You can tell me anything Dean, you know that right?” Sam leaned on the counter, leaving the whole island between them as space.
Taking care to avoid people, even if it meant using roundabout ways, Dean made his way to the library. True to his word, Cas was there, sitting in a plush leather chair in a secluded corner and reading a book. Quietly, Dean walked over and settled down on the floor, resting his head on Cas’s knee.
Let me know your thoughts in the comments! If you'd like to see a continuation of this, or another fic in general, leave a prompt in the comments, the more specific, the better! (I do have thoughts of doing one on Lebanon)
But Sam just turned around and smiled, as if that was the first time he had greeted Dean that morning, “Hey. Are you okay?”
Dean was silent. So much time passed, that Cas had given up any hope that he would talk about it. But then came a faint reply, “Philip mostly.”
Dean looked up at him, “Yeah, yeah. I think – I mean, I’ve spent the last however many weeks, trapped and alone. It’s nice to have some company, especially someone who… cares, for me.”
Dean’s lie may have been believable, had it not been for his unconvincing smile and his all-telling muscles that – after Michael – would flinch whenever he was anxious or stressed – or panicking; that and the fact that Cas hadn’t felt that from him before, at least not that strongly; not even when Kevin or Charlie or Bobby or even Sam had died.
“Oh,” Cas responded. There was a beat. And then two. Dean was about to break the silence, despite having no words, but Cas beat him to it. “Do you
“Okay, I’m literally going 80 to deal with it. How can I be running away from something when I’m racing toward it.”
From the kitchen came the slight sound of the kettle whistling. “I have to go, Dean’s waiting on me.”
and he will accept you no matter what. I am sure of it.” Cas pulled away to look him in the eyes, “You can do this, Dean. I know you can.”
Sam shares a glance with Mary and Bobby. None of them know what to make of Michael’s departure. “Okay. Come on, let’s get you home.” Sam wraps Dean’s arm around his shoulders and slowly stands.
Dean met the man’s gaze for a second before once again dropping his eyes to the floor, “He just… He just left.”
? I just slept in the same bed with another man. Dad would hate me for that. He would never want a f–, he wouldn’t want
The anger slips from Dean’s face and is replaced with pure fear and confusion. “No… I didn’t… I-I don’t…”
For the second time that day, Cas confused Sam. Cas abruptly took on what could only be described as a ‘pissed-off’ mood, accompanied by a sudden change of topic. “Where is Philip? The hunter.”
Dean just stared at him, conflicted between wanting to reassure him and lift one of Cas’ many burdens, though it likely wouldn’t do any good, and being honest for once in his miserable life, screaming at the top of his lungs that
Shouted Sam, immediately attempting to pull Cas away from a beaten and bloodied Philip. It proved harder than expected, Cas
Dean nodded again, laying back on the bed. Before Cas left he made sure to pocket Dean’s lighter, and then focused on the task ahead: Philip.
Cas shrugged, “I didn’t before I became human. Ever since then, even though my grace is back, I found that it was easier. If I really wanted to, I could usually manage it. Especially if I haven’t for a long while or have been injured in a fight. Plus, being with you… well, it made me feel safe.”
“Absolutely,” Dean affirmed, “It’s alright that my head’s on your leg, yeah?” Consent went both ways, after all
“Okay, okay,” Cas instead held Dean’s hand, “I won’t unless you want me to.” After everything, the last thing Cas wanted was to do something against Dean’s wishes. “I would like to at least bandage them, is that alright?”
Dean however, sped down the hall to where Cas lingered. The angel’s arms immediately engulfed him. “I can’t – I can’t do it Cas. He’s gonna hate me… he’ll never want me as his brother–”
“I know…” Turning on his heels, Dean visibly steeled himself, and headed for the kitchen. Peaking inside he saw Sammy still there, sitting at the table sipping a cup of coffee. “Hey…” he started, feeling awkward after he ran out from the conversation.
did - with me, because, because I was underwater, drowning. And that I remember. Clawing, fighting for air. And I thought I could make it out, but I-I-I couldn’t, I wasn’t strong enough. And now he’s gone, and he’s out there, putting an army of monsters together and he’s hurting people and it’s all on me. I said yes. It’s my fault.” While he was speaking, tears began to roll down his face. He sipped his tea, unsure of how Cas would react.
He trailed off, clearly not done with his train of thought, so Dean prompted, grabbing his bag from the back, “What’s up angel?”
Dean took another step into the water and reached for his soap. He washed his body as fast as he could, but still being careful to keep his head out of the water. He almost succeeded, and would have if it hadn’t been for his shaking hands.
“Your brother,” Cas squinted in his usual thinking face. How much would Dean be comfortable telling Sam? “Dean is… dealing with some stuff, but he will be ok, someday.” Sam nodded; he should talk to Dean later.
, I let him escape, and then back in again; do you know how many people that hurt? How much damage I’ve done? The others are right, I’m pathetic, worthless.”
“Hey Sammy,” Dean replied hoarsely, before his legs could no longer hold him and he slid to the ground. Sam had grabbed his arm, steadying him, and suddenly, Dean is aware of everyone’s eyes on him. Taking the time to finally look up, he saw Bobby and his mom staring back at him, cautious hope written on their faces.
Dean’s response was so quiet Cas almost missed it. “I don’t want to… do this anymore,” Dean hadn’t spoken in two days and it showed.
Dean’s lip quivered, but he was determined not to cry anymore today. “Thank you,” he breathed. In response, Cas gently ran his fingers through Dean’s hair
Dean took a shaky breath and nodded in understanding. His attention turned to one of the hunters who had paused uncertainly a few steps away. “Yeah, not Michael anymore.” Dean explained. The hunter smiled, continuing about his business.
Cas was troubled, how could Dean think that, “You have not disappointed me, you never could. Do you understand? I love you Dean. You are so kind and giving, why would you think you hurt people?”
Dean bit his lip, panic creeping up when Sam wasn’t responding. Suddenly, strong arms were wrapped around him, “Dean. I am so
“Good,” Cas said, placing a kiss on Dean’s forehead before walking behind the counter, “because we need to get a move on these pancakes.”
Sam sighed, shifting on the chair, “I just… I’m sorry Dean. I should have known, I should have stopped him, I–”
Dean turned to look at Cas. “What?” His voice came out stressed and exasperated. They had, after all, been there for an hour and were only halfway through their list. Partly because Walmart was extra crowded on Saturdays, partly because it was Walmart, but mostly because Dean would see the name of an item on the list and immediately go there, rather than follow it top to bottom. Sam had gotten good at listing the items needed in order after taking so many trips.
Cas practically ran through the halls, colliding with Sam, who promptly slammed into the opposing wall.
Admittedly, this ending was hard to write, and ill likely come back someday and edit it. I really hope you enjoyed, thanks so much for reading, it means the world to me.
Sam blinked, “Uh – last I saw he was in the armory?” Cas turned on his heels, trench coat flaring, as he walked out of the kitchen.
Paradise. An omega was whining and moaning in front of him, his knot buried deep. Sultry smells and emotions swirled around him while the sound of Castiel’s body slamming into his omegas echoed in the small hut. Slick slipped past his knot and onto the floor. His omega smelled amazing. He couldn’t have asked for anything more. He was in paradise.
If you've come back to read the new chapter, THANK YOU SO MUCH. It means the world to me that you would come back after all this time. Please believe me when I say, I plan to finish this fic! Baby steps as I jump back in. Chapter 9 is still in the works but I'll be working on it a TON this week since I won't really be working.
Castiel stood slowly, feeling awkward. Michael regarded him carefully before gesturing at his chest. "Take off your clothes, but leave your underwear on." Castiel stalled long enough to grab Michael’s attention. "You okay?"
Castiel's eyebrows shot up as Dean turned his gaze down and away. "Oh, Dean, hey." He reached out and placed a hand along Dean's cheek, coaxing Dean to look at him. The last thing he wanted was for Dean to think he didn't want to be with him. Dean didn't move, but he allowed Castiel to keep his hand on his cheek.
Michael picked up his pace, pumping faster and harder. Castiel groaned, arching back against the hard body behind him. He was approaching the edge, and it wouldn't be long before he'd tumble over. He didn't want it to be over yet. He never wanted it to stop. Not now. Not yet. Michael pinched his nipples again, and Castiel shuddered.
"Good boy.” Michael squeezed his tip to coax even more come out of his spent cock. “You did so good."
A hand that was lightly slapping his face pulled him back. Sounds, touch, emotions, they all slammed him back into reality. Dean was kneeling in front of him, two hands cradling his face.
He allowed himself time to take in what she had said. She believed he was a good boy. Knowing what he really wanted, he asked.
Jack nodded in understanding, taking a step forward again. “I know, that's why I was hoping to work with Castiel. He could help me and teach me about my powers.”
Okay, so this chapter is a little bit shorter than the others as I officially decided to cut out the non con touching scene. It still happens, but you won't have to read it. I didn't like it and it wasn't written well either because I didn't like it. However, it is mentioned briefly
The air in the kitchen was thick with humidity as Castiel made his way in, the afternoon sun beating down on the earth reminding the world that it may be October but it was not quite fall. The sound of birds filtered through the small fan that was mounted in the window above the kitchen sink. Taking a moment, Castiel stood in the open doorway of the kitchen, closing his eyes and taking a deep breath as he allowed himself to shed the last bits of tension still in his shoulders from the latest panic attack. He could get through this day, he had to. The last few years were proof of that. A nagging feeling in the back of his mind, though, reminded him to stay away from thinking about his nap dream. No good could be had by remembering him. Not right now. Not again. Not yet.
She sighed. “We are neither younger nor older than each other. All angels were created at the same time.”
Dean's hand slid around to the back of his neck and pulled him down for a kiss. Leaning in, he deepened it, desperately trying to feel something. Sex had never been like this before and a small part of him was starting to worry. Was this that thing he had been reading about? When couples started to get bored? He wasn't bored, at least he didn't think he felt bored. Life with Dean was challenging and even difficult at times, but it was also always exciting and invigorating. It took them awhile to find their groove as a couple but once they had, well, they couldn't figure out how they'd gone this long without one another. And the sex? They had been doing that, what, a few times a week at least. Bored was far from what he felt.
Dean nodded his head against Castiel's chest. "Same. I've been known to get heat haze for a few days halfway through. It's only been two days, but still. I don't think I'll black out either."
Dean sat across from him, his plate already empty except for a few stray pieces of meat that would be thrown into the woods for the critters. Castiel’s own plate had barely been touched. Deep down he knew he needed to eat to keep his strength up during his rut, he just didn’t want to.
“We should go.” Setting a hand on Jacks shoulder, he attempted to turn them away to walk out of the cemetery. They still needed to find the soul.
“It doesn’t make sense for the soul to backtrack,” Jack’s shoulders slumped, “but then again we didn’t sense anything on the way here.”
Oh shit. Was Cas's rut not over? His eyes hadn't been red that morning, Dean was sure of it. Or what if he got hurt? Dean's pulse hammered in his throat. “Sammy, what happened? Is he okay?”
Michael’s hands continued to move reassuringly over his thighs before he sighed. "We're gonna stop for a sec, okay?"
Ishim was a pain in Castiel’s side. Anytime the guards did anything different, no matter how big or small, Ishim was on his case. The alpha just didn’t know how to let go of control, a personality trait that got many packs back in the day in trouble.
Castiel hummed a laugh. Dean was being extra cuddly at the moment and, for some reason, he found it adorable. The scent of vanilla was mixing with the overwhelming sweetness of honey. He assumed it meant the omega was feeling much happier and his inner alpha preened at the thought. All he wanted was to make the omega he was trapped with feel less like an animal and more comfortable around a strange alpha.
Dean nodded, his gaze already having dropped to his lap while Castiel spoke. Nervous, Castiel dropped his hand and took Dean's. "No matter what version of myself I am, I would want to be here with you, Dean."
So looks like I just refuse to keep a schedule. 7 of the 8 chapters are fully complete so I guess i'm just ready to get Part 1 completed and posted.
He closed his eyes again and sighed. He could finally feel the stress from the day drift off his shoulders allowing him to sink into the chair. Maybe everything could be okay after all.
Castiel made his way to Lailah, eyeing Jack as he went. She pulled back her burned jacket sleeve to reveal burn marks on her skin in the shape of a hand.
They sat in silence for a while, both men trying to gather their thoughts; to say things out loud they never had before.
Dean finally met his gaze. "Shouldn't I?" He growled. "You've been suffering this whole time and I've done nothing to help you!"
Dean sighed, but nodded. “Alright.” He stood up and pulled Castiel into a hug. “Just promise you'll call me if you start to feel it happening again, okay? I can be here in 10 minutes.”
Once they were all the way in the kitchen, the hand still on his shoulder pulled, a sign that meant he wanted him to turn around.
Ever since the battle with Lucifer, Jack had been having a hard time sleeping. Most nights he found himself perched next to the young nephilims bed at night, ready to block out any nightmares that may pop up. Jack never mentioned not being okay with it, so he continued to do so. Well, that was when he wasn't sleeping himself, apparently.
From the moment his mother died when he was a pup, multiple moments throughout Dean's life forced him to feel overwhelmed. Watching his father drink himself into oblivion from the grief of losing his wife. Presenting omega in a motel alone with his tired little brother pup. Watching the news as Chicago went dark. The feeling of helplessness never got easier no matter how many times he was forced to deal with it. Being dragged down the hallway of the prison he was in, two guards on each side of him grabbing his arms tight, was one of those moments.
Milo crawled into Castiel's lap and snuggled down. It was now or never. Time to be completely honest.
Michael immediately removed himself from touching Castiel anywhere. Castiel pitched forward in an attempt to complete the near-orgasm that was slipping further away. He had been so close to finally experiencing what he’d waited so long to try, and to have it ripped away without warning, left him reeling. He whined and tried desperately to catch his breath.
“...I just figured, until you were ready, we wouldn’t talk about him. Especially after you destroyed that door.”
The demon tightened it's gripped and raised him up onto his knees. Someone screamed in front of him. A glance to the left showed one of the other demons had grabbed Jack and was throwing him across the yard into another gravestone. He tried to yell Jacks name but the grip around his neck was too tight. The demon that had him started to chant in enochian. He recognized the spell immediately. It was the same chant that Alistair had tried to use to banish him all those years ago. How had a low level demon like this one gotten that spell?
Castiel assessed the pallets behind them. At first glance, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. The omegas had already gathered the rations for each person and spread them into small piles of food next to the shipment. “How much is missing?”
Castiel felt like he was floating. Michael’s hand slowed, and Castiel whimpered as he started to settle down. Once his ass was back on the chair, his vision began to blur. He felt very lightheaded.
“Castiel.” Lailah grabbed his attention, pointing at the cemetery that came into view. He noticed a car was there now, parked next to the headstone of the missing soul. Why would a human be out so late?
Before he could lean forward and chase Dean’s retreating lips, a cough sounded from the front door. “Am I interrupting something?”
“Jack.” The nephilim turned to look at him. Just as he thought, the toothbrush was still hanging forgotten from his mouth. “Toothbrush.”
His inner alpha relaxed. There was a heaviness building in his chest that both he and his inner alpha felt. Castiel imagined them resting in the dirt with them, howling along with the words as they sank into the safety of vanilla and cinnamon.
That voice. It pulled his attention forward. Sitting in front of him was a red omega, sweat soaked and panting. He was gorgeous, mouth hanging open, eyes closed.
"How about this," Michael sat up straight and regarded him closely. "I'll change up my plans for you. The moment you feel uncomfortable or wanna stop, you tell me right away, okay?"
Lailah’s warning had his head whipping up. Lailah had her blade out, squaring up to something behind him. Turning quickly he saw five demons making their way up the drive behind Tanya’s car.
It was only a few seconds before Castiel could feel the omegas cock and channel throb. Cum coated his hand while more slick dripped down his cock and thighs. He fucked the omega through it, inching closer to his own climax.
A cold sensation shot up his arm from his hand. Seconds later cold hands were cradling his face. The sensations shot him out of his mind and he gasped. He realized that Dean was talking to him and looked up into his eyes.
"Perfect." Michael stopped the movement of his hands but kept contact with one of his hands. Castiel took a few deep breaths, which allowed him to think clearly. He just needed a second to breathe.
Cas jumped up, Milo jumping out of his lap with a wine. "Dean, please." Dean was halfway to the house when Cas felt tears well up. "Stop."
"Everyone please calm down." Cas directed, eyes never leaving Dean’s as he slipped put of the omegas grasps and met Dean on his approach.
Sam eyed his neck. “You understood the mates part, obviously. What else do you need filling in on?” Sam cast his eyes down the hallways again.
Castiel shook his head. "Don't mistake nostalgia for my grace as being resentment towards you, Dean. It wasn't your fault that I lost my grace and it's not your fault that I'm grieving it's loss."
He hates it here; hates the scentless; hates their prison. Five hundred years of progress thrown away all because these humans chose to round them up like ferals and experiment on them.
Dr.Adler grinned. "Fine. Take the bitch to his knot. He can have a few more nights of fun. They don't have long anyways."
"What if it was just an accident?" Hannah tried. He wrinkled his nose at her sudden stench of old fish. She always stood closer to him when she was worried and a part of him wished she wouldn't.
He watched as Impala shut the door and turned toward him. The room was small, definitely not a shared room. Instead of a bed on each side of the room, a bunk bed was on one side, a black futon on the other, and a compact desk with a wheelie chair between them. Castiel had barely stepped into the room, and he was practically in the middle of it.
Sam looked away as Dean covered himself up. “It’s a long story. Did Castiel fill you in on the plan?”
“Sometimes, our own actions can surprise us. So long as you remember that you saved the world, then there's no shame in not feeling regret.”
Just like the first time, Michael removed himself from him. While Castiel was still trying to catch his breath, Michael leaned against him, causing him to cry out at the sudden physical contact.
In an attempt to keep her spirits up, he did his best to look as unbothered as possible. "Hello, Hannah."
“I would bet you a million bucks the kid doesn’t show monday.” Sam grinned at his brother, Dean still shaking his head with laughter.
I couldn't quite make it a full week. Here's chapter three! Dean and Cas get to know each other a little bit more. In the...biblical sense ;)
She kneeled next to the rock he was on and offered him the bowl with her arms outstretched before her. Her long brown hair was matted to her forehead and her ratted thin cloth top drooped on her chest from sweat. Hannah's usual flowery scent was weaker, overwhelmed by the fear she always felt since they arrived. Hannah was an excellent omega and she deserved much better than their current circumstances. They all did.
Finishing his cereal, he stood and washed out the bowl, placing it in the half full dishwasher. He glanced at his phones time again, it reading 12:52pm. Dean would get off of work at around 3 and be back by about 3:30. If he stayed on task he'd have enough time to clean out the garden, do some laundry, and get his workout in. Closing the dishwasher, he decided to ignore the mailbox and headed up to grab the laundry basket.
Cas stared him down but didn’t move as Dean inched closer. “This is far from okay, Dean. You could have-”
Anxiety fluttered under his skin, remnants of the panic attack he had before he left. His roommate, Balthazaar, had talked him down, reminding Castiel that the whole plan was his idea; no one was forcing him to do anything, and he really wanted to give this a shot while he was still in college. In fact, he wanted it bad enough that he was willing to pay a stranger to try it. Who had he become?
Turning his head and meeting the gaze of all three in his company, he made sure no one else had any more questions before continuing. “With heaven back in working order, alternate universe Michael dealt with, and Lucifer finally…” he paused, cautious of Jack's reaction, “...not a threat, I was planning on taking Jack to finish rounding up the lost souls from heaven.”
Castiel blinked as cinnamon penetrated his senses. He found himself standing just inches in front of Dean, who was facing him concerned. In an instant, everything came back to him. His rut, the humming, his mother, the song.
Castiel reached a hand out towards Jack, placing it on his shoulder. “How are you doing that, Jack?”
Castiel frowned, feeling as if the conversation had been disappointing to the nephilim. As if he had missed something Jack had been asking. “Your mother would be proud of you.” Jack looked down into lap before looking away through his window.
“About him being a nephilim?” Sam cut him off, “No. I just said that he was a kid with a messed up past.” Castiel nodded at nothing since Sam wasn’t looking at him. “Talking about him helped a lot.”
His cock hung hard between his legs, throbbing from the lack of stimulation. The need to be touched was suddenly driving him insane; he had never felt like this before, had never wanted to be touched by someone else so badly. Castiel dove headfirst into the longing and pressed his chin down against Michael’s fingers and closed his eyes. Michael trailed his fingers slowly along his jaw before turning his wrist to rest his palm against Castiel’s cheek. Castiel leaned into the touch and sighed.
Castiel whimpered as the hand slowly pumped up and down. Hips still thrust forward, Castiel’s toes still curled against the hardwood floor. Michael pumped his cock a few times before letting go completely. Castiel whined and fell back onto the chair. He swallowed in a lame attempt to calm his racing heart, praying Michael would touch him again.
Dean studied his brother's eyes. He was still so young, but had clearly grown in the months they’d been apart. He was only twenty-four years old and planning to storm the death star.
Castiel stood, the two omega females still clinging to him. Dean pushed down the wave of jealousy bubbling up. They were probably Cas’s pup's mother's. Cas had said he prefered male omegas so It was fine. Everything was fine. Dean took a moment to wonder why he even cared. They weren't mates or anything.
I wanna say THANK YOU SO MUCH for every ones support in this! This is the longest fic I've ever worked on and your constant support has been my fuel for my motivation. You're angels!
Life after the hospital stay was strange. While Castiel understood his actions had hurt those he loved, he hadn't expected them to change much. He also hadn't expected to learn that there were many different ways to ask certain questions by only asking one. If Dean or Sam asked him how he was doing one more time, he was going to smash another door.
Dean held the alpha tight as he fell apart. The anguish and pain surrounding him brought tears to his own eyes. "It's gonna be okay, Cas. I promise. We'll get Jack and we'll get Claire."
Castiel turned back to Sam, Dean still pouting behind him. “I was briefed on a case in Wisconsin. I'll take Jack and if…” he raised his voice as Dean attempted to protest, “ AND IF something goes wrong then we'll come back here and find a different way to help Jack.” Jack smiled at him while the brothers both just stared. Sam eventually sighed with a shrug while Dean rolled his eyes and nodded.
This was very dialogue-heavy but with it being fast-paced, I didn't want to slow the tempo of the read. I hope it didn't read TOO fast though.
Dean slid his hands up Castiel's arms and cupped his face making him look down at him. Staring into Dean's eyes, he tried to remember how he got there but just couldn't. The last thing he remembered was sliding into bed the night before, next thing he knew he was here, fucking Dean into the King sized bed they had been sharing the past 3 years.
. Dean wanted to be concerned, worry about that tiny voice, but he was more worried about whether he'd see the alpha again. The alpha that had taken care of him. The alpha that had almost died for him. The alpha that was currently growing further and further away as he was pushed ahead of Dean. The escape plan, as far as Dean was concerned, required him being brought to Castiel’s pack. They did everything Sam asked, and now all they could do was pray the fake bite was believable.
Castiel continued to breath in Dean's scent, his face still buried in Dean's neck. He knew Dean had asked him a question but he just couldn't find the energy to answer him. Eventually, Dean continued to just card his fingers through his hair when he didn't answer, the feeling being the only thing keeping him from falling apart.
Jack looked up at him again, an argument in his eyes. “Castiel…” He tightened his grip on Jacks shoulder and turned him to leave. Jack hesitated, “Please. I can help, I know I can.”
“Hey, wake up. I know we're comfy, but my hips are starting to hurt and I'm starting to feel gross.” With a sigh, Castiel allowed himself to be rolled off of Dean and back onto his own side of the bed. He could hear Dean slide out of bed and move into the bathroom as he kept his eyes closed hoping to fall back asleep.
His first test with this new information came a few days later. Sam was tasked with picking up decorations for the house and Castiel decided to tag along. Dean had decided to work on a new dining room table for Thanksgiving and the noise was driving Castiel insane. Plus, they'd never decorated for Christmas before and Castiel was beyond intrigued.
He made his decision as he watched his daughter eat. “Kelly, make sure the food gets rationed properly. Whatever is going on, we need to make sure we don’t overindulge." Castiel looked away and made eye contact with Kelly. He trusted her more than any other in the pack. "This could be an accident, strategic, or a test. Let’s try not to fail.”
They breezed past the nurses and guards without suspicion. "I was by myself then," Dean argued once far enough away, "and I couldn't even get myself out. Now you're asking me to rescue an entire pack?"
There it was, the big question. Castiel had to look away to answer him. "I guess I’ve never really been interested in sex before, and I've never been in a relationship long enough to feel comfortable doing anything. I wanted to try
Lailah stopped this time, just a couple feet away, turning to face him. “Perhaps it was them that wasn’t good for us.”
“Believe it.” Sam pulled away first and looked around. Dean followed suit and relaxed further when no one was milling about. "I brought you this." Sam produced Dean's soiled loincloth and he reddened. He'd forgotten he was still naked. Dean grabbed the cloth that still wreaked of his own slick and even some of Cas's spend, and started wrapping it around himself.
He sighed and shook his head before looking away at the counter. “I want to be…” Dean dropped his hand and set his empty paper plate down on the counter. “...i just….it’s hard today.”
Jack looked toward Sam, who gave him final confirmation that yes, this was really Dean, before Jack wrapped his arms around the older man. Moving away, he realized that Castiel was now standing beside him.
He was vaguely aware of footsteps approaching, and he looked up, blinking rapidly to bring the people into focus. “Dean?” the nearest person asked, sounding hopeful.
“Sam is approaching,” he warned, remembering Dean’s want to keep their relationship a secret for now. Judging by how content Dean had seemed, Castiel was surprised by how fast Dean shot up, looking remarkably – normal.
Castiel, in the form that he was- the form that he’d always been, minus the body he’d been forced to inhabit for so long- slowly kneeled in front of Dean. It felt wrong to watch his knees touch the sopping ground, as if something so pure shouldn’t be able to touch something so dark and dank. He reached out with one of his hands and placed it over Dean’s filthy, scarred hands. Dean didn’t have it in himself to want to pull away.
Somewhere in this universe, or maybe the next, there resides an open meadow between this world and the next. The sky above it is always sunny and blue. The field extends on for miles, across gentle hills and rolling river valleys, unmarred by any mark of civilization or unnatural divide. The meadow is spotted with smiling yellow poppies and blue-and-white wildflowers reaching up towards the sun. The grass grows on its own accord, but never reaches past the mid-shin. No animals live under the grasses of this place; no burrows mark the smooth ground. Every living being who passed through here found somewhere better to be eventually.
him, a man with just the same. The moment they’d connected, their raw souls had become irreversibly intertwined, if only for a fraction of a millisecond. Dean had seen the whole of Creation, funneled down into one speck of energy and one shaped of an angel.
“Cas, about….about what you said….” Dean started again, then trailed off, as if he expected the angel to interject.
Despite himself, Dean felt a deep, rotten anger bubble out of the depths of his gut and into his bloodstream. He slammed his fists down on the ground, causing a ripple of some unknown liquid to splash up at him. He didn’t know when it’d started, but at some point, he realized that the terrible, heaving whimpering he heard was coming from his own mouth, along with a line of saliva and salty tears down his chin.
This is where Castiel differed. It was a careful dance they’d crafted- Cas assuming and Dean refuting, over and over again like clockwork- and while he didn’t want to fall into any new traps, there was a time when he needed to decide to swipe the cards to the floor entirely and jump across the poker table.
The silence of the Empty was deafening. It was like the Empty itself had left its own domain, leaving behind this inky black pocket dimension void of anything.
He remembered feeling this way when he was nineteen years old, on a hunt down in Georgia with John. He’d fallen hip-deep into a sticky bog when chasing after a shapeshifter. He’d remember feeling panic unlike anything he’d ever known when he tried to claw himself out and the water simply swallowed him back in. The slimy bottom of the pool only encroached on him further when he moved.
“It was never supposed to be like this.” His voice shook. He sucked in violently. No one responded. “None of this was. None of it. I--  I know. I know that I can’t change what was. What
More silence. It went on for so long that Dean was almost convinced they were going to sit like that until the sun came up. He wouldn’t’ve minded.
“You knew me,” Dean said, “you knew me. And I knew you. That’s all there is, right? All there ever was.”
The other man, Dean Winchester, was not the first to look away. This simple, seemingly innocuous fact had been the amalgamation of every single thing that had happened to them, good and bad, and landed them here. Dean Winchester had always been the first to look away. He’d always been the one to pull the reins. He’d always been the one to duck his head. He’d always been the one to be
If Dean Winchester were an honest man, he would’ve noted the way his heart squeezed painfully in his chest at his words. He wasn’t an honest man in any way except for when it counted, however, so he cleared his throat and closed his eyes.
Sam wisely decided not to answer. Dean felt it again—that unutterable grief somewhere deep inside of him. They both knew that that wasn’t true, because Cas had to have been somewhere to come back from the Empty before, but within this, they also both knew the true answer, which wasn’t much better; Cas was as close to
Unimaginable. There wasn’t a single ancient text or archaic spell that could instruct them on this in such a way that would ensure a safe return on either Dean or Cas’ part; but it was
Castiel repeated, his voice even softer than before, yet more firm. He moved the second of his right arms up and cupped Dean’s face in his hands. Castiel wiped away the tears that Dean hadn’t realized were still coming.
The man with the veteran edge and year-worn soldiers, Castiel, had made some concessions to get here. Hell, he’d made them all. He’d given everything for this, and now that it was here…...well. It felt big.
Maybe the world wasn’t as big as Castiel felt. Maybe the world, when stripped down to its bones, was made up this; two souls, love, alienated under the washed-out streetlights and forced out from under the rock it hid. Maybe it was as small and as simple as their feet on the ground and their
to stop remembering him. He remembered when Cas first rode beside him in the Impala. He looked like he couldn’t decide to put his hands. He remembered when Cas sent him to the wrong building when trying to help him on a hunt; he’d apologized like he’d just killed Dean’s mother. He remembered when Cas, his mind high-jacked by Naomi, beat him bloody and blue, each hit a merciless jab, and he remembered the way his eyes cleared when Dean finally got through to him. He’d never looked more calm.
“You were wrong,” He breathed out into the dark. He took another step forward and set his jaw. “You were
The heart still rested in his hands. It began to beat slower. With every beat, it changed color—the pinkish, fleshy hue it had once taken on began to fade away, overtaken by the effervescent blue light that Cas’ ethereal body had given off. Dean watched its transformation with calm acceptance. He held it so gently that he felt he might drop it.
Dean remembered a dream he’d had many years ago. There’d been this light surrounding him—enveloping him more like, as it was as if he was being embraced—and something moving towards him that he couldn’t quite see. It was as if his vision warped and blurred the figure before him as to keep him from seeing it clearly. It’d been blue and yellow and white and vaguely human-shaped, and it had moved unlike anything he’d ever seen before. It was Creation walking. Perhaps its humanoid figure had taken form by chance, or perhaps it was a learned state of being from prowling the Earth constrained, but regardless, it’d struck Dean as something familiar, even if he didn’t know what it was.
“Cas,” Dean said, his tone a bit more forceful. If he’d never gotten the angels attention in the past, he prayed he’d be able to capture it now. When Castiel didn’t respond, Dean grabbed his shoulder and forced him around, bringing them both to a halt. “Goddamnit, Cas, are you listening?”
Somewhere in this universe, or maybe the next, there resides an open meadow between this world and the next. The sky above it is always sunny and blue. In it there remains two men—one with green eyes, one with blue— spending their countless days together, under the light of eternal youth.
There was a shuffling sound. The lights didn’t come on. Sam came into the room, walking resolutely over to Dean, then paused. After a moment, there was more shuffling. Dean assumed Sam was going to sit across from him at the table.
John had saved him that day. Afterwards, on the ride home, he’d told Dean that he wouldn’t save him next time he decided to get himself into something so stupid.
Lailah sighed heavily. Finally deciding to relieve her from the onslaught of questions, he placed a hand on Jack's shoulder, having the nephilim slow to his own pace and leave Lailah to lead.
He chuckled at the grimace that fell across Sam’s face. “Well, thank god I left early then.” Shucking his boots at the front door, he headed towards the two men still sitting in the kitchen.
Castiel smiled as the last bits of panic fell off his shoulders, clearing his mind. “No.” He raised his hand as Dean opened his mouth to protest. “I'll be okay. I think I'm going to just rest today instead of work in the shed.”
He wanted to tell Dean no. No he wasn't okay, he was far from it. He wanted to cry and bury himself in his lovers embrace but the words got caught in his throat. For some reason he just couldn't translate his emotions into words that would make sense to Dean, especially when he barely understood them himself. Plus, why worry him when it could be nothing at all? He didn't sleep well and now he was exhausted and still hot from the lack of air conditioning. Imagine that, needing an air conditioning in Wisconsin in October.
“One weekend I was bored and decided to take a walk. I saw it and just decided to walk in. I had no reason too, I just did.” Sam never looked over at Castiel once. He kept his eyes straight ahead at the fire. “Once I did, I saw a sigil on a door inside and she caught me admiring it. She made a joke about it keeping demons away and I must have made a look or something because she knew immediately that I was a hunter. We got to talking and she told me she had an office in back that she used to help hunters having a hard time dealing with the life. She told me to come by the next day and, for some reason, I did.”
The group continued forward and onto the grass of the cemetery. A breeze gently blew in from the south, blowing Castiel’s coat around his thigh as a few birds whistled away in the shedding trees. The trees lining the property were spotted with different hues of red and orange, the leaves shining brightly under the intense sun. They made their way over the piles of leaves and onto the main property. The site wasn’t very big, signs of an always small community ever present in the smaller than normal number of gravestones.
Castiel fumbled around for words. "That's the problem, I don't know. One moment I was an Angel, and the next I was here, human. Then I'd fall asleep and be an Angel again."
Opening his eyes, he found Milo perched next to his food bowl, staring up at him with hope. Hope that any second his bowl would be filled by the sleepy non angel that normally had his bowl filled already but had failed to do so. He gave a small mew as if to say “My bowl is over here, remember?”. Castiel chuckled as he made his way over to the pantry.
“I don't feel upset. My mother didn't trust him, you didn't trust him, Sam and Dean never trusted him. He was…. bad.”
Thank you so much for sticking around for this fic! It means a lot to know that there's some people out there interested enough in this story to read over 30k words of it. This is a planned out 3 part series. Part 2 is still a WIP, but the first 2 chapters are practically done. My stay-cation starts in less than 24 hrs and I plan to spend most of that time writing Part 2 and will plan to start posting Part 2 Feb. 11th. Oh, and Part 2 is in Dean's POV so we'll get to see how he felt about Cas in their first 6 days together.
Castiel allowed himself a chuckle. He couldn't remember the last time he truly laughed. "I agree. I would love to spend time with you."
Sam shook Dean’s arm to get his attention back. "You have three days. After sunset. That's when we move."
Castiel gasped and pressed down, arching up high against his tiptoes and gritted, "Michael!" through his clenched teeth.
That got Castiel's attention. He looked up and met Sam's gaze. He was smiling, but it didn't reach his eyes.
Sam looked around again. Dean glanced and saw a nurse standing not too far away, facing away. “Come on, we should hurry." Sam whispered.
The omega stayed a moment longer before he retreated to his hut. Castiel would visit him later, as promised. It had been far too long since he’d gotten to spend his rut in the company of another male. He couldn’t be happier it would be spent with Inias.
Which world is Castiel about to wake up in? Who is 'She'? What's real anymore? Tell me your thoughts and theories!
“They were archangels.” She supplied, “God made them first to help create the universe. When he was done, he made the angels.”
This chapter was a bit of a challenge for me. I'm still not 100% happy with it but sometimes you just gotta let it go.
Dean exhalled, leaning forward to rest his head on Castiel’s shoulder. He shifted his head to accommodate Dean’s and glanced towards the front door to find Sam standing there, his brow raised in a questioning smirk. Castiel couldn’t help but smile.
The nephilim opened his eyes, looking up at him. “I’m not sure. I can just feel it. There’s energy that I can sense, like you I think, but there’s more. I can just tell that she’s a she and that she’s young. She’s looking for something, I think.”
Almost instantly, the alpha fell into Dean’s arms and gasped a shaky breath. "He was so scared and alone, Dean.” he cried, “and I couldn't - I tried to - but Sam-"
The sound of the mail truck stopping outside had Castiel looking up from his bowl of cereal. Every once in a while the Men of Letters would send them mail asking Castiel to join their cause. He had no interest in working for men that never lifted a finger to stop anything since he had first come down from heaven all those years ago. Plus, he knew the only reason they'd want him was to pick his brain about angels and heaven. The last thing he wanted to do was remember, it was painful enough as it was. To be reminded every day that he was the last of his kind, and not even OF his kind anymore, they could, as Dean would say, shove the letters up their asses.
Night time in Wisconsin wasn't much different than Kansas. The bugs still sang along with the trees as they swayed in the evening breeze, the air smelling slightly of rain to hopefully come in the early morning. Every few minutes the sound of a passing car on the county road would filter through the window drowning out Jack's soft snores.
He looked up to see Hannah walking towards him, a makeshift bowl in her hands and a frown on her lips. It wasn't unusual to see the omega down, a fact he wished he could change and had tried. Hannah desperately wanted a pup, but it never seemed to work out. Since she had been taken away after her last heat, he knew they still checked her for pups. It made his skin crawl.
The kitchen wasn't very big, but the two of them had managed to get by with what they had. There were days when he knew Dean missed the old bunker kitchen and they had been saving money to renovate it, but Castiel couldn't help but love what they already had. It was very human of him, but wasn't that a good thing? He was going to be human for the rest of this mortal life, might as well find something worth appreciating.
Cas shook his head. "Sam showed me. They were doing something to the pups, Jack was th-" Cas stopped and tried to gather himself.
Michael's hands started softly, stroking his thighs again. Castiel found that he could relax into the feeling, getting used to being touched by someone. Michael was right; he was doing this for a reason, so why not enjoy himself? Why not allow himself the one thing he wanted more than anything? He needed to do this, for his own sanity.
Dean’s arms gave out and he collapsed against the table. Tears welled in Dean's eyes as relief flooded through him. He wasn't with pup. Cas kept his promise and Dean no longer had to worry about raising a pup in the sex torture dungeon he’d found himself in. Couldn’t do one thing right?
It was only a few moments later when they walked up to the last seen location of the possible soul. The three of them wandered down towards the tracks that had curved further back past the trees and towards the lake.
“Let’s split up and look.” Lailah suggested. Jack and Castiel nodded in agreement before heading off in different directions.
I hope you enjoy this chapter! We're going to get a little more info on this strange guard promising escape and what's been going on "behind the scenes"
Castiel nodded in agreement as they headed back down the winding back road. “There’s no telling where he went. I already checked the motel room and did a search through most of the town.” When he found the nephilim, they were definitely going to have a talk about the flying off.
Castiel finally looked away at the fire. He couldn’t quite make sense of the feelings fluttering around in his gut, but he knew they weren’t good.
“Cas?” Dean asked, the ring held up between them. “Would you do me the honor of being not only my best friend, but in human terms, my husband, for the rest of our mortal lives?”
So, it's been almost 2 years. In all that time I have to say I never stopped thinking about this fic. Life threw me a massive curveball and I backed away. This fic has meant a lot to me as It's the biggest fic I've ever worked on for SPN and know how I want it to go and how it will end. This chapter and the following chapters have been in the works the entire time. This chapter alone having been basically done for the past 10 months. I guess there's 1 good thing that's come out of this "self-quarantine" days we live in currently. I have all the time in the world to focus on this fic and my other works Fanfic and original content.
Castiel did as he was told, grabbing the chair and twisting it to straddle the seat. Michael's hands wrapped around Castiel’s torso and rolled him back until the chair stopped when it hit the couch. Castiel wrapped his feet around the base to keep it from moving while Michael settled behind him, his hands roaming Castiel's chest.
"It's hard to explain-" Castiel paused. In a sense he knew exactly what had happened and why he had acted as he did, but in an other, what if it had all been fake? The depressed imaginations of a fallen angel grieving his son? Where could he even begin?
Dean continued and, for just a moment, Castiel could forget where he was. He wasn't a prisoner in a fucked up world. He wasn't miles and miles from his home, and he wasn't being treated like an animal. For just a moment, he was Castiel Novak spending a lovely evening with an omega named Dean. The omega, who was effortlessly taking care of an alpha in rut even with his own heat flaring within him. What were the chances?
The reality of what he was about to do, in addition to the attractiveness of the man before him, made Castiel’s heart kick into overdrive. "Hello," he replied.
"I-" there was something Dean was missing, he could feel it. His instinct was to not give any more hope than necessary. For their sake, and for his. If he couldn't deliver on a promise, he'd never forgive himself.
Jacks eyes lit up in understanding, as if reacting to the sensations physically. “It feels familiar somehow. Is that normal?”
"Of course, man." Sam chuckled. "You're my best friend and best friends hang out together, right?" Castiel smiled with a nod. "Don't get me wrong, I'm glad you and Dean are together, but he's hogged you for long enough."
With every breath he took, the frustration built. He never needed to work out as an angel. His vessel was never something he needed to worry about. Now it was. Four years later and he still wasn’t over it. He was not meant to be human. He was not meant to live a life like this. To need to eat, exercise, sleep...it was too human. He had been human before and it was just as awful then as it was now.
Castiel shivered at the memory of his capture. The wood pieces that scattered across the foyer as the deadbolt forced through the door frame. Electric currents that forced his chest to clench as they washed threw his body. Muffled screams as he fought for consciousness while the zip ties around his wrists tightened. He had been stripped of his dignity, forced to stand naked with other alphas and omegas. The cries of the young and the whimpers of the omegas weakened by their heats still played behind his eyes like a movie that wouldn’t end. He remembered having to throw alphas in a rut rage off of the omegas in heat as he barked orders at the sterile alpha’s to help protect the omegas. The ebb and flow of scents and emotions that forced them all to submit, or allow their minds to slowly go mad while locked up in the cages for weeks before being transported.
"Mmm," Castiel reached up with both hands to take the steaming cup of what smelled like honey and vanilla tea, "thank you, Dean." It was his favorite.
Castiel deflated. He knew it was coming, he just had hoped Dean would have lasted a bit longer. "Dean-"
Sam stepped away once he was sure the star would stay and joined them to admire their work. “Not too bad, guys.”
Dean's heart rate picked up again the closer Cas got. He could feel himself leaning forward towards the alpha and had to actively stop his feet from moving. They hadn't mated. He was being ridiculous.
He watched as his brother retreated and the doors closed between them with a heavy thud. “Three days,” Dean mumbled to the closed doors. With a heavy heart, Dean turned back to regard the small crowd down the small hill. There was no going back.
“I...I think I feel something.” Jack looked to both angels. “I can feel a sort of vibration, like it’s under my skin.”
This chapter went down MANY different paths but i'm beyond happy that I finally settled on this one. I hope you are all happy too and that it was worth the wait!
The angel woke with a start, Jack standing above him gently poking his shoulder. Slowly he sat up, his body feeling heavy as the effects of his dream self slowly started to melt away.
Castiel chuckled. “You should teach me then.” When Dean didn’t respond right away, Castiel turned to look at him. His head was down, a frown etched across his face. “Dean?”
Dean’s eyes were always green, but now they had a gold ring around the pupil. His alpha knew what it meant, but what little self control he still had pushed the alpha back. He could follow a simple order. "Okay."
Michael rolled his head from side to side. "Well, I wouldn't exactly call this sex, but no, they don't." Castiel sagged in the chair.
Jack turned back to her and stepped closer. Lailah shot Castiel a look, frowning in confusion. He simply shrugged in response.
Castiel glanced up and down the tracks, searching for a light, a sense, to try and track where the soul had gone. “I didn’t sense anything on the way here, did you?” He asked Lailah.
Castiel sobbed as he finally let his orgasm wash over him. Come spurted against his stomach and chest as euphoria spread through his body with every continued stroke of Michael's hand.
Jack tilted his head back and sighed. The strange energy that was around Jack suddenly grew, spanning out across his entire body. Castiel started to grow panicked.
He had to look away at that. What could he say? He wasn't okay, but he wasn't not okay enough to make Dean worry. Right?
Castiel took the opportunity to walk up again. “We really do need to get you back, Haley. You don’t want to be stuck as a spirit.” Haley nodded this time, unwilling to fight. Castiel was grateful for the change in heart. He was terrified that she would fight back or that something would go wrong. Castiel stepped back, allowing them their last goodbyes.
Castiel beamed as he turned into Inias's space and slipped a hand onto Inias's cheek. The omega hummed and closed his eyes as he leaned into the touch. Inias always seemed to crave his touch, even whimpering from time to time. The omega never said much, but Castiel had seen enough to know that, whatever had happened to Inias back in Chicago, had traumatized him.
Castiel wrapped his free arm around the omegas neck, gripped his chin, and pulled him back just enough to steal a deep filthy kiss. The omegas back arched beautifully, both hands still planted on the bed while Castiel kissed and pounded into him. His knot was throbbing at the base and he was inching closer and closer to no return. His omega was going to feel it for days. He'd make sure of it.
Castiel stood from the table and headed over towards Jack. Gently, he placed his hand over Jack's forehead sending grace out to help him sleep. After a few seconds the nephilim relaxed, his breathing pattern returning back to normal.
would’ve died too. I wish we both c-could’ve stayed dead! Maybe then some of this would make fucking sense—t-then I wouldn’t have to feel this, goddamnit! I wouldn’t have to be here, begging for you to be here, to be
After the last time the fought, Sam didn’t speak for him for two weeks. The halls of the bunker had grown even more quiet than they had been before. Sam wouldn’t even look at him. They ate separately; they worked separately. They coexisted like two ghosts caught in their own defunct endings. Dean had never felt so forsaken.
“I can’t remember a time that I didn’t have you around,” Sam started again, “not actually, anyway. You were always somewhere, Dean. I’ve always known my brother was
“You spineless bastard,”  Dean breathed to the ground, his voice crackling around the edges, “I hate you. I hate you so much. You never cared, Castiel. You never once cared about yourself.
Dean was overtaken with a far off, mournful feeling he couldn’t quite describe. He took his eyes away from their fixed point on the fridge down to Sam’s head. He couldn’t see his face. Sam’s ridiculous mop of hair covered it. He was reminded of a time when they were young, and Sam was too small to understand much of anything at all, when they’d huddle together for comfort and warmth when John was gone. Sammy would cry sometimes. He didn’t understand where Dad went. Dean would coddle him and let him cry in his lap and reassure him that Dad would be home soon.
He wasn’t making any sense. Dean could tell he wasn’t making any sense. He’d be grateful that he was talking to empty air if he actually believed the air around him was empty. He didn’t, however. He didn’t have the energy to withhold his faith anymore. It spilled from him grotesquely and without control, spreading its sickening resoluteness down Dean’s face and onto the floor. It leaked out of his eyes. It oozed straight from his heart and into the world, screaming its descent into absolute devotion.
Cas. As he is. His true form. He’d seen him far above, thrashing through the hellfire towards Dean, deep at the bottom of the cesspool. When Cas touched him, Dean felt him completely. He
Dean visibly softened. His own heart and brain had been disconnected for as long as he could remember, but something in Castiel’s eyes coaxed out a yearning to understand in a way he hadn’t quite felt before.
Cas bowed his head slightly, leaning it in and leaning his forehead against Deans. The dizziness of Cas’ ever-changing face and the pulse of his energy rocked through Dean’s skull and down to his core. He didn’t even breathe. It felt as though the energy was now his own. He couldn’t remember where he started, and Cas began.
Not wanting to make Dean worry, he looked back up at Dean and smiled. “Yea, it's just too damn hot in here.”
"Well, hello there," the man, who he assumed was Impala_67, drawled. He stood with one arm propped up against the half-open door as he looked Castiel up and down.
After a few moments he pulled out, burying his face in Dean's neck. Trying not to place all his weight on Dean as his arms gave out beneath him proved fruitless, giving up and trying to shift to a comfortable position being all his body would allow. Sleep threatened to take him over, his exhaustion hitting him hard, but the feeling of Dean carding his hands through Castiel's hair as they both panted against one another kept him in the present. How was it that he could be wrapped in his lovers arms and still feel nothing?
“I told Dean not to bring up Jack because I knew that you were having a hard time with his death and being human…”
Her smile and shake of the head were enough of an answer for him. “Good, alpha.” Amelia stepped closer, and Castiel turned his head as she lifted to her toes to kiss his cheek. “Now, go check on the others.”
He had to tell him. Maybe he'd understand, or maybe he'd get mad. Not telling him wasn't exactly lying, but it wasn't entirely truthful, either. Would Michael be mad? Would he make him leave? Castiel sighed and closed his eyes again. Regardless, he had to tell him the truth. Michael needed to know. "I'm a virgin."
"DNR rescue woman stuck in rocks. Davichou claims she was chased by a glowing orb down the railroad tracks before slipping and falling down into the rocks below. This is the third claim of a glowing orb hanging around WI-113 between the ferry and County V."
“I’m sorry it took me so long to realize, or maybe I already realized and it just never clicked, but,” Dean paused, took a deep breath, and met Castiel’s gaze. “I need you, Cas.”
“So did I, and so did heaven. As it turns out, not all of the souls have returned like they were supposed to.”
The cold and wet thing in his hand started to drip through his fingers. Opening his palm, he looked down and saw the last bits of a melting ice cube. It slid around in his hand as he tilted it side to side, watching as the melting piece moved around in the growing puddle. Some of the water began to drip down the sides of his hand as he slowly closed his grip again, the feeling drawing him back into his body. The more he stared at his wet hand the more he realized how not wet his other hand was. Closing them together, he interlocked his fingers waiting for the last bit of the ice cube to melt away.
Lailah stepped forward lifting her arm to grab the soul and release it. “I’m sorry.” She said, no sympathy in her tone. Twisting her wrist to grab the soul with her grace, the soul started flickering violently.
“Omega.” Castiel whispered gruffly. He was out of his seat in an instant, grabbing the omega and lifting him up bridal style. “Mine.
"Y-yea, but you can call me Cas.” He hoped the guy didn't notice the quiver in his voice. “Are you Impala_67?"
She still hadn’t noticed the two angels behind her. Not wanting to spook her, Castiel signaled Lailah for him and her to fly into the dark behind Jack. She nodded in understanding and they flew off, landing just a few feet behind Jack. The woman didn’t notice.
The omega trusted him not to break that promise. It took every inch of self control available to him that he pulled out and spent himself over his omegas ass and thighs.
“So I look at Joe, honestly not believing what I’m seeing…” Dean opens his mouth to laugh but can’t due to the massive bite of burger still half chewed in his mouth, ”...and I said, ‘but you killed the engine right?’. I kid you not, the kid just stared at me like I was a ghost.”
BIG BIG Thanks to everyone who has stuck with me through this. We're almost at the end of Part 2! I'm excited and nervous to see what you guys think.
Michael stood up from the chair, then pushed it to the side. He crowded into Castiel’s space, leaving mere inches between them. With a soft voice, he murmured, "Turn around."
He nodded. “Yes. When I took on those souls, I changed, and not for the better. I killed those angels, all of them.” He sighed, looking away from Lailah. “If I could go back and change things, I would. I would have listened to Balthazaar when he warned me. To have given back those souls immediately when Sam and Dean had asked me to.”
“Okay then.” Putting the food away, he grabbed the broom and dustpan, cleaning up the spilled cat food and tossing it away.
"Get moving, mutt," Sam growled loud enough for the guard to hear. Dean rolled his eyes and turned back around allowing Sam to continue pushing him down the way.
Amelia shifted Claire in her hold and stepped closer to him. “Of course she does. But so do you.” Castiel sighed. “You’re the only one of us without a mate.” She pressed on, using her eyes to gesture towards the direction Inias had disappeared to. “Perhaps it’s time.”
Castiel took a deep breath and knocked. His heart rate sped up as he listened for movement behind the door. With each passing second that he heard nothing, his anxiety skyrocketed. He was thrumming with the need to bolt and never look back. Unfortunately, or not, before he could make a move, the door latch clicked. He swallowed hard as the door slowly opened, then froze as his eyes swept over the man in front of him. He was tall, but not much taller than himself. His light brown hair was cut short on the sides with longer locks at the top that were perfectly coiffed. He was clean-shaven and had the most mesmerizing green eyes Castiel had ever seen.
“Alpha, please.” The omega whimpered in his ear. Castiel was on a mission. He kicked open the front door and hurried over to the small cot. Careful, he placed the omega down. “You promised.” He whimpered.
“And that’s why you care so much. They became your family. Your new garrison.” She offered in understanding.
Trailing behind the other two as Jack continued to ask questions to Lailah, he tried some much needed meditation. Taking a breath, he allowed his vessel the chance to take in all the universe had. The energy from the sun as it beat down on his exposed skin. The breeze from the sky as it cooled the warming skin. The sound of the lake as it washed up against the rocks. The crunching of the rocks and dirt under their feet as they made their way towards their destination. The blending smells of grass, trees, and the algae that washed up against the rocks below.
The memories of his dream flashed through his mind as he finally pinpointed the taste. The coffee he had drank, the panic attack, the house, being human, Dean, the sex...
"The plan. It's practically fail-proof." Sam pushed him to keep moving as more doctors, nurses, and guards rounded the hallway.
The nephilims face faltered for a beat, looking away and shuffling his feet before meeting his gaze again. “I managed to get a few hours.”
He nodded his head. “Yes. I think…” He closed his eyes and placed his other hand against the side of his forehead. “....I think her name is…..Haley.”
Michael's lips around him? Castiel was beginning to think he did. The thought had never crossed his mind before, but those lips and mouth were starting to elicit feelings he'd never given much credence to. Castiel could almost picture it. Michael, on his knees, his green eyes staring up at him with a hunger Castiel wouldn't be able to resist. Would he grab his hair and-
“I assure you, Ishim, everything is going to be fine. It’s just a little less food.” Castiel looked beyond Ishim’s shoulder to his pregnant omega, Lilly. Castiel didn’t like that she looked away, as she always seemed to do. It made him feel uneasy.
Dean gripped his face tight and lifted the alphas gaze back to him. "Listen to me. You made me a promise when we first met. You kept your promise when every instinct told you not to.” Cas sniffled but kept his gaze. “I'm going to make you a promise right now. I'm going to get your pup's back and I'm going to help everyone here escape."
“Dean,” Castiel interrupted, “It’s perfect the way it is.” The eldest hunter shrugged. “Our first christmas tree.”
Dean lifted himself up fully and threw his leg over Castiel's lap. Castiel very much liked where things were headed. "I think I'm being adorable."
He shook his head. “No, but it must not have been too long ago.” Jack headed up the road, feet moving swiftly on a mission as the two angels followed behind.
Castiel hummed in agreement. Being in a rage was typical for most alpha's. "That's usually been the case." Castiel started, his hand still raking across Dean's skin. "Stuck in a sort of rut rage for a few days and completely blackout for one a few days in. At this rate, I'm not sure I'll blackout at all."
Castiel grinned at Amelia but didn't miss the tension in her arms. His daughter's tiny fingers were wrapped around the cross that hung from her mother's neck --something she’d been doing since birth-- while she fed. “You should sit, mother." He said. "No need to strain unnecessarily.”
Down the way, more guards appeared through an open doorway that looked similar to the dome entry points. Dean frowned at the nearly twenty guards milling about, half holding up assault rifles. His time with his brother was up. There was no choice but to take his brother's word and pray the plan went off without a hitch. Sam continued to lead him towards the doorway and passed all the armed guards.
Castiel acknowledged the sound of Michael standing up and the couch cushions groaning as they settled back into place. When nothing immediately happened, Castiel’s nerves got the better of him, and he started to quiver with his renewed anticipation. Michael stayed distanced for what Castiel could assume had been hours. Perhaps, even an eternity, far too fucking long for Castiel’s sanity.
“He honestly hadn’t even thought to kill the engine,” Sam continued, “he just let it keep bouncing around until I ran over and did it myself. Bill was furious, and you know how calm Bill can be.”
Trying to force down the panic, he slumped back in his chair. The burning logs, that he couldn’t actually see anymore, became fascinating. They had to be. He could outsmart the panic attack, if he could focus on the texture of the logs...
The guards took a sharp left and pulled Dean into the same room they had been ever since his heat had started. It looked like any other doctor's office, but that table in the middle of the room was far from as welcoming as his actual doctor's had been. A nurse was inside, slipping gloves on and directing the guards on where to put Dean. He barely had time to process what was happening before the guards threw him face down, legs spread, and presented onto the freezing examination table. The nurse's unfriendly hands violated him in ways he tried to convince himself was okay no matter how many times he'd gone through the examination. His legs and arms trembled uncontrollably as the nurse shoved some sort of tube up his ass and cringed at the familiar burn as they were never careful. His heat was done, it had been sometime during his and Cas’s last romp, but there was still anxiety bubbling up the longer he was stuck in the room.
"Dean," Castiel's deep gravel voice soothed the remaining tension in Dean's gut. A wave of sadness washed off the alpha nearly doing him in. "Are you alright?"
A rubber band was pulling and pulling, growing taught while a small voice in the back of his mind repeated
Castiel closed his eyes and tipped his head back as Michael's hands started to roam gently across his stomach again. One hand slowly dipped down to his boxer briefs, his fingers teasing the waistband. Castiel held in the groan that threatened to pass his lips.
"I don't understand," Castiel said as he stopped to frown at the shelves of outdoor lights, "icicles don't emit light."
Dialogue is my nemesis, I SWEAR. It's shorter than usual, but I had to stop where I did. Things are going to get CRAZY next chapter, so prepare yourselves!
They both shook their heads. "We're not sure." Amelia responded. "They don't seem to be acting any different than usual. Just the amount of food."
Castiel pulled the hoodie tighter over his head as he glanced down the dormitory hallway one more time. It was mid-day, so there wasn’t anyone around, thankfully, but there was still a chance someone could see him walk into the room. He inspected the text on his phone to double-check that he had the right room number. ‘Room 401’ glared back at him and, when he looked up, a gold ‘401’ placard was affixed to the door.
They stared at one another for a while before Dean finally nodded. "Okay. Yeah. Sure." The omega started to stand. "Come on, alpha."
He led Dean back towards the entrance and to one of the many huts surrounding the clearing. While the hut he shared with Cas had been just a cabin in the woods, this new one was an entire campsite. Each hut looked like a tiny cabin built for no more than two people on a few day long trip. The wood was old and some logs were warped, but they seemed sturdy enough for having still stood tall after a few years in the dome. Once again, Dean had found himself wistful of a yearned life of camping trips and equality; a life he hoped he’d one day get to experience. Though, if they made it out safely, he wondered if he’d ever look at camping the same again.
Castiel had started to notice the sweet scent of honey wafting off the handsome omega not too long before the sun began to rise and wondered if Dean would require a third round. He wouldn't be opposed as his own rut had been growing at around the same time Dean's scent had intensified. Though, he was beginning to think his rut was only part of his reasons for concern. Rut or not, he knew he’d be more than happy with another round with the whirlwind omega.
Dean stumbled as they hauled him off the table. Fear surged through him. Anything called “The Pit” wouldn’t be promising and, after his time spent in the hell hole of a prison, he knew nothing good was about to happen. Dean tried to struggle in the guards hold as they carried him towards the door.
"No!" Dean almost choked as he waved his hands and shook his head. "I'm not with pup, it's not that."
On the far side of the clearing, across the fire pit, was a series of picnic tables. The whole village sat in their usual places as they ate and chatted away. Castiel's two pups were with Hester, slurping away at their honeydew melon as Amelia and Kelly talked nearby. Castiel was lucky to have Amelia and Kelly as the mothers to his pups. They were strong women and even stronger omegas. Both of them had similar ground rules when they had helped each other, a strategy the rest of the village was unwilling to do. After around six months of being in this hell hole, everyone had agreed they needed to mate. It brought more peace and order to the village, but it also brought despair. Many of his charges didn't like their mates; they simply needed a mate to survive.
Dean smiled and Cas finally relaxed. The scent of rotting meat slowly drifted away, replaced by Dean’s favorite scent of a salty sea he’d grown accustomed to mean Cas was content. "I got to speak to Sam.”
So, I was planning to have this done and posted on time, but, last week I made a last minute decision to quit my job with no backup plan. Obviously that sent my weekend and past week into CHAOS. I've got everything, sort of, worked out on the personal end and am so very happy this chapter is FINALLY done. It didn't quite turn out the way I wanted, but I can only edit so much before I just have to post the darn thing.
Sam had taken a folding chair and retreated out into the yard next to the bonfire he had just started. Castiel attempted to balance 2 beers and a plate of 2 burgers and brats while Dean grabbed them both a chair and set them up next to Sam’s.
“I... “ Castiel started, swallowing as he made himself try to speak. “...I had promised Kelly that I would take care of her son. Him dying...I…” He paused, those all too familiar human emotions building in his chest.
This is a short one, I apologise. I've struggled how I wanted this chapter to play out and where it ends felt like the best place to stop. This fic was Not Supposed to be as emotional as it has been but here we are.
Castiel gave a nervous chuckle as he looked down at their feet. He could feel a building pressure in his chest, his breath starting to slowly quicken. Why was he freaking out? There was no need to freak out. Was there? The sides of his vision began to blur as his heart rate started to pick up. He felt like he was being chased and was running for his life. He knew he was standing in his own kitchen but couldn't shake the feeling of being in danger. Something was wrong. Something was very wrong.
Dean found himself relaxing in the rotting meat scent of rage that filled the small space. His alpha was upset at the mere thought of him being hurt and he did his best to stop his inner omega from preening. “Hey, alpha, it’s okay,” Dean soothed quickly, hands up as he stepped closer. “I’m okay. I made it here. It’s going to be okay.”
Castiel felt strange, as if he was floating just outside his own body. He needed to feed his inner alpha, but he also wanted to address the powerful memory he had just experienced. It had been years since he’d last allowed himself to think about his mom.
The nephilim had wanted to jump right into their mission but Castiel had refused his pleas. He had noticed how Jack would periodically rest against the car door and knew the nephilim must have lied about sleeping well the night before. Souls were unpredictable and he didn't want Jack getting hurt because he was too tired to focus. Since the motel was only a few miles away from the soul sighting, they stopped, Jack only surrendering after Castiel mentioned wanting to do research before hand anyways.
Dean underneath him, gripping his arm as Castiel slowly but steadily thrust in and out of him. The sounds of Dean's quiet whimpers and his own heavy breathing as they moved together joining the sounds of birds chirping as they filtered through the window, the sun just starting to shine through above their bed. Dean's hand squeezed Castiel's forearm as he gave a high pitched whimper signalling Castiel to shift his position, both so used to one another they no longer needed to verbally communicate. Castiel paused his thrusts, shifting his knees up closer to drive in deeper, just how Dean liked it. Dean sighed in content as Castiel got comfortable and continued his steady thrusts.
