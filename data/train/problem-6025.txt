“My own brother, and I lost track of him. I didn’t know where he was, what he was doing, because I was so concerned about getting myself a good life, a life where I didn’t have to struggle or fight for what I needed. And then, I got the call, one night, in the middle of the night, from one of his friends. I was sleeping, and the call woke me up. They tried three times, because I hung up the first two, thinking it was just some scammer, because I didn’t recognise the number. And then, I finally picked up, and this stranger was telling me how my brother had checked him into hospital because he was having stomach pains. He went in for an angiogram, and he never woke up. They had him on life support.”
James sighs and turns back to the stove, where Steve is stirring a wooden spoon in a spot. “Please tell me you at least
“But you have,” Steve says, simply, smiling. “And I’m going to explain to you why. You see, my name’s Steve Rogers, and I’m datin’ this… smart, beautiful, kind, funny, fierce,
Steve lifts his eyes, almost defiant in the tilt of his face. “I’m just saying that I hope you had good time with the bastard, you know. I’m hoping he gave you what you wanted, especially considering that you left the kids with our friends to go and get on your back for that asshole-”
Tony takes it from him, his hands suddenly hot. He drinks some of the scotch in an attempt for artificial courage.
A month later, Tony forces Steve to come out with him to dinner. He accosts him just as he’s coming in through the door, dumping his shoulder bag on the couch.
And in the picture, there is Steve and there is James, and they have their arms around each other, looking much younger than Tony has ever known them, maybe as they were still in high school, and they’re smiling at each other, and Tony knows that smile, it’s the smile that both of them give him, it’s not the smile of friends, and Tony’s lungs stop functioning.
“There’s no time for this!” Tony snaps. “There’s a fucking terrorist after me, and something tells me that a guy who’s part of an organisation that was willing to poison an entire state’s water supply to cause mass panic and casualties is not above using two four-year-olds to get to me.”
“We have to find those tapes. How the hell do we do that? We can’t go back to our parents. They’ll never help us. They were trying really fucking hard to make sure that any mention of Obadiah Stane died with him. They don’t want us to remember.”
Bhim nods. “But Satyabhama already had three suitors – Akrura, Kritavarma, and Shatadhanwa. They were angered by the fact that Satrajit had given Satyabhama to Krishna and not to one of them. Shatadhanwa, in his rage, killed Satrajit while he slept, and stole the Syamantaka gem from him. On realizing what he had done, Shatadhanwa left the gem with Akrura and fled from Dwārakā. Krishna and Balarama, Krishna’s brother, gave chase and killed Shatadhanwa for his crime. Not finding the gem on Shatadhanwa, Krishna knew that he must have left it with Akrura for safekeeping. Krishna approached Akrura and requested him to tell the people of Dwārakā that he possessed the gem, otherwise the people of Dwārakā would think that Krishna had killed his father-in-law in order to possess the gem. This, Akrura did and Krishna's name was cleared. The final condition was that Akrura would keep the gem, but that the gem would remain in Dwārakā.”
“Nothing…” he licks his lips. “I mean, nothing’s happened. We’re just… we’re just going through a rough patch, that’s all. It’s not…” he closes his eyes. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I know you said that you weren’t interested in hearing-”
She was always polite with his father’s lovers, even if a part of her died on the inside with every new pretty face that she saw.
James shrugs. “We’re all adults here. I think we’re fully capable of making this choice, and we’ll deal with the consequences once it’s done, like adults.”
James with some difficulty and a few winces, manages to take his shirt off, revealing a familiar muscled chest blotted with deep bruising and a few cuts from what Tony thinks is a serrated blade, scouring the planes of his abdomen.
Obadiah brings his hand up, and when it comes down, Tony swings with the machete in his hand, slicing Obadiah’s arm at the elbow. The half-limb hits the ground and rolls across, the knives making that high-pitched, sharp sound that metal makes.
Ms Lewis closes her eyes, and then finally, sighs. “Okay, so, I don’t know if it’s anything to worry about just yet.”
Tony’s throat flexes. “After you left, I didn’t take it so well,” he explains, smiling a small, unhappy smile. “I drank a lot; I dipped into drugs-”
“Steve–Steven Rogers. I would like to speak to Omega Stark if he has not already retired for the night.”
“Ah,” Eshe says, finally. “I understand that the two of you have feelings for him, and I must say, it’s refreshing to see a couple so open to the concept of adding someone into the relationship, without jealousy.”
Tony swells up with indignant pride, and the two of them are staring at each other, and Tony’s torn between punching him again and throwing himself into Steve’s arms and kissing him until neither of them know what day it is.
The bed feels far too big, without Steve. It’s already too big, too big for a normal, human being, the sort of size that they make special for you because you’re a billionaire, but something he’d always found a little comfort in before, before Steve and the kids. He’d always liked the space, and now, without Steve’s weight, his radiator-like heat beside him, the quiet snuffle of his breathing and snoring in the middle of sleep, the bed yawns around him, like a gaping mouth, cold and uninviting and listless.
Tony nods and he rests his head against James’ chest, as his hand stretches, the joined pair with Steve’s, flattening against Steve’s pectoral, where he can feel his heart beat in a steady, inexorable rhythm under his skin and bones and muscle.
He smiles when Steve comes home; he kisses him goodnight and goodbye in the morning, and he pretends like he’s not dying on the inside.
Tony twists his hand, and Pepper, who always has his back, who knows his mind even before he knows it, presses the band into his hand, the same time as Steve is turning, with his ring clutched between his index finger and thumb.
Pepper switches on the television. “See, I’ve got a cousin who lives near the airport, and Mom said it was okay for me to stay over for the night. So, I figure, we replay the airplane noises from a movie while I’m on the phone with her, so she knows that I’m there.”
, but that would only scare him away. He smiles and moans, when Steve moves lower, biting at his hipbones, before running his tongue over the dip in his pelvic bone.
The kids end up becoming the greatest obstacle that they have to tackle. They are kids, after all, and when they don’t get what they want from Tony, who has somehow become the strict parent, they go to Steve, and when Steve doesn’t budge, just as stubborn as Tony is, they go to James, believing him to be a soft touch, an easy mark.
“Coils are at peak,” Tony muses, staring at the readings. “Levels are 100%. We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we’re ready. As we’ll ever be.”
“No, we know, thanks to your own testimonies that she was locked in a room with another girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag,” Coulson snaps.
“Steve wanted to apologise,” Natasha explains. “An insurance emergency came up, and so, he doesn’t think he’s going to be back until really late.
Steve’s hand cracks down on his ass, leaving a red-hot sting in its wake, and Tony cries out, not having expected the sudden action.
It all comes to a head, when one day, he walks into the library and is greeted with Grant bending some serving boy over one of the tables.
Tony turns to see a beautiful woman, with dark auburn hair, a round face and green eyes, beautiful and clearly also an alpha, approaching them.
His tongue traces the hot, throbbing vein beneath the head, which makes James groan and clutch at his hair. The sting of his firm hand against Tony’s scalp spirals down his spine and settles in his cock, making him agonisingly hard between his legs, and a sudden wetness makes him peer down to see that he’s left streaks of pre-come over the underside of his belly.
Steve seems to realise that he’s said something to upset him, and he doubles-back, the colour brighter in his face. “I’ve… I’ve upset you–”
Tony feels the rage like the last, dying embers of a fire being set alight once more. “Yeah, because you were spying on a good, decent man who hasn’t done anything wrong,” he snarls.
“Mouse didn’t like it, yesterday morning, when she saw me come out of the guest room,” Tony says, quietly. “She blamed me; she was more concerned about her Daddy sleeping alone than me. She even apologised to him on my behalf.”
Tony shrugs. “I’ll sleep in study hall. You know I know everything already. Besides,” he hesitates, “I’d rather keep busy if I can.”
Finally, Steve lands on his knees in front of Tony’s chair, and he’s ripping the ropes with his bare hands, the muscles in his arms flexing, and Tony’s pulling his arms free, as they slip to the ground. His shoulders scream in response, but he’s too busy pulling the gag from his mouth.
He’s practically shouting at this rate, and then, he starts running, searching every room, every closet, throwing open every cupboard to see if the kids are somehow, hopefully, hiding inside, waiting for him to come and find them.
It all happens so quickly that Tony doesn’t even know what’s happening; it also doesn’t help that he’s fifty feet in the air, fighting against murderous, giant rabbits with lasers for eyes (honestly, for someone who hates humans like nothing else, where does he come up with shit, because there’s no fucking way that he could come up with this kind of creativity on his own, and Tony doubts that other alien civilisations are capable of the shit that humans are capable of).
Steve’s face falls, and he looks suddenly uncertain, and Tony can’t imagine what it’s like for him, to stand opposite the man who he’s so convinced is sleeping with his husband, but at the same is his oldest and dearest friend, the friend that he was so sure that he’d lost in the desert in Afghanistan, and is now standing in front of him, alive and whole but can’t remember him at all.
Tony kneels over his pelvic bone, keeping his eyes fixed on Steve at the foot of the bed, and angles his mouth around James’ cock.
“What does maturity have to do with oatmeal?” James asks, his voice sliding high, edging into a hysterical tone.
Agent Carter hauls off and punches him in the face. Hodge goes down like a sack of bricks, dropping down in a heap, eyes watering, blood streaming down his face.
He hasn’t forgotten how Steve threw him away because Howard and his professional respect meant more to Steve than Tony and his love.
He dies a little inside at every sob, every scream, every scrape, because those two look at him like he can fix everything in the world, make everything in their lives, good or bad already, better. When there’s a problem in their life, they run to him, they reach for him, knowing that he’s their hero, their greatest shield, their greatest protector and their greatest champion. Even if it’s painful and scary and brutal and he doesn’t know what he wouldn’t do for them, and he knows that he’s capable of terrible, inhuman things if it would keep them safe and happy, it’s not something that he would give up for anything in the world.
“Doesn’t matter, anyway,” he sniffed. “Everyone knows that the slut opens his legs for everyone that passes by. Who’d want sloppy fiftieths anyway? He’s probably loose as fuck by now.”
James’ lower lip trembles, and he ducks his head. When he lifts it again, his mouth is stretched wide in a grin, but his eyes are over-bright, too bright to be anything else but tears.
“Hey,” she says, softly. “Those kids love you, love you very, very much. I don’t think it’s fair to say that they would throw you over for Steve. Do you have any idea how much they talk about you when you’re here? Do you have any idea how much they talk about what invention you’re making, or what you taught them the day before, or what you read to them, or what song you sing them to sleep? I can assure you, I am a piss-poor caregiver compared to you, as far as they’re concerned.” She chuckles. “They just tolerate me. Hell, when Steve dropped them off yesterday, the only thing they wanted to know and they bugged him with it until he left is when you were coming home and whether
“He inserted himself between me and the frat boy; he was this huge wall of muscle in a thin white shirt that didn’t leave much to the imagination, and he said in this low, grim voice, ‘Is this guy bothering you, sir?’”
“I can’t imagine anyone better,” Natasha’s voice is passionate, strong with confidence (she’s always thought him so much better than her, so much more stalwart and righteous and honourable; the compass of integrity when she couldn’t get hers to quite work – he’s not, and now, he’s broken, and she’s always been stronger than him)
“What, you think they left me in a good way? There wasn’t a rupee left when they were gone. Guess how I lived, Mister Rogers? I worked here, in this fucking bar, and I wasn’t the bartender.”
“Tony,” Steve says, frustration bleeding through his voice. “Tony, I’m not going anywhere.” His voice softens. “I could never leave you, Tony. Where would I go? You’re my home.”
For a moment, Tony thinks it’s done, that Steve is dead, and the moment stretches into eternity, but then, Steve appears out of the darkness and the dust like something vengeful and unnatural.
There’s laughter in the background, dark, mad laughter, the slamming of hard doors. A lamb skitters past him, running off into the dark. Tony watches it for a moment, and then, he hears another sound, a sound that digs deep in his belly, a high-pitched scrape of metal against metal, and it sets his teeth on edge.
Steve’s hands fly to the belt buckle of his slacks, and he pulls it from the loop, quietly. He unzips his slacks, the sound cutting through the air, and he looks down at Tony, sitting primly and obediently on his knees in front of him, before fishing a hand down his pants to grab at his cock.
Tony nods. “Bucky Barnes was Steve’s best from Brooklyn. They grew up together. I’m…” he hesitates, “I’m pretty sure they were in love with each other too, at some stage,” he says, quietly, “but… Bucky joined the army right out of high school, and he disappeared in Afghanistan on his first tour. They never found his body.”
“Huh,” he says, wrestling with the words to thoroughly describe his surprise. “I was not expecting that. God delivers when you least expect it, I suppose.”
“You have no honour,” Tony rasps, grinding his teeth as Grant replaces his fingers with his cock and begins to thrust.
them. I don’t hit the gym as much as I should or used to. I’m flabby. My skin is sagging, and I have wrinkles, okay? I was just convinced that you were seeing what I was seeing in the mirror, and it was turning you off.”
James’ face is hot with colour. “Actually, I’ve never had anything up in there,” he confesses, almost shamefully.
“Tony,” Steve says, his voice gentler than Tony had ever imagined it being, especially when considering the context, “what happened?”
Steve sits up a little, his eyes hot, his brow damp with sweat. “Only if you want to,” he says, dazed.
Dr. Zola wipes the spit off his face with a look of disdain, and with a surprising amount of strength in his small hand, he punches Tony in the gut, causing him to grunt and double over, the only thing keeping him on his feet being the Nazis holding onto him.
His eyes track upwards, and there, in the sky, he can see Pepper and Rhodey working like a well-oiled machine even if this is the first time that Pepper ever wore the Rescue armour – the only thing better would be if Tony were up there to fight
“This greedy fucking hole of yours is just mine, isn’t it? You’d never let anyone touch you the way that I touch you. No, of course, you wouldn’t. I just worry sometimes, because you’ve got such a pretty cunt, and you take care of me so good, always, and you look so fucking beautiful like this, you look like you’ve been fucked good and hard and put away wet, just like I wanted you to be. It’s not what I wanted,” Steve growls, “not the way I wanted to do this, but you’re right, watching you take my fingers like a fucking pro, watching you swallow me in and tighten up around me and fuck back like you want everything that I can give you, well, there’s nothing sweeter than that. There’s nothing sweeter than you.”
Tony lowers his eyes, pretends as though his shame is not colouring his face – what a terrible thing it is to be trotted around like a whore, like an omega for wares, as though he is not the child of a great lord, a trueborn child with the lands of the Stark at his back.
He used to swear like a sailor behind the wheel, sometimes even flip stupid, teenage drivers off, when they pissed him off.
“For fuck’s sake, even after all of this, you can’t admit it, can you?” Tony asks, hurt. “I just… I guess I thought you weren’t telling me because you were trying to spare my feelings, but apparently not. Apparently, you’re just the same kind of coward that I’ve been desperately trying to avoid my entire life.”
Tony deflates and wrings out his hands. “No, you’re right. I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.” He looks away. “Let’s go.”
The kids are at the kitchen counter, wrist deep in raw broccoli, and when they see him, grins brighten up their face, and they’re rushing up to meet him at the same time that he is. He catches them in his arms, presses his mouth to their hair and then, their cheeks in turn, smelling their warm, clean scent.
Tony watches the way that she touches him, touches him like she owns him, smoothing down his collar, touching the shade of stubble growing on his jaw, and feels something curl in his belly, hot and mocking and feeling a lot like jealousy.
eyes too, and there’s nothing in them. “He skipped town. Left before the cops could make an arrest. Because you were a child, everything was kept hush-hush. Your father cut him out of everything to do with Stark Industries, and well, that was that.”
. This is proof. I have this, and no one can take this away from me, because it’s not just a story, not just a myth. This gem is real;
“Where have you been?” she demands. “We searched all over for you. You can’t just disappear from the damn hospital like that. Your arm was sliced open. You needed treatment.”
Right now, the stone is bigger in his intestine than it has ever been before, and a realisation that Tony had previously been willing to ignore digs further and further into his mind than ever.
He makes his way up the stairs to the bedroom that he shared with Tony, and his bones feel like old bones. The bedroom is just as they’d left it when they’d gone to the Compound that last day, and he turns back the sheets that are so cold.
“Here,” Tony says, roughly, when he withdraws. He removes the chain from around his neck. “This belongs to you. If it wasn’t for this, for
The killer’s attention is diverted when Natasha rolls up on an elbow, making a soft little noise into her pillow. The instant that he does this, the killer fades into the shadows of the cell.
“Is that so?” Grant murmurs and walks over to him. “Are you really pretending that you don’t want it, after all of these moons?”
Steve strokes Tony’s side, his arm long enough to reach around James’ body, as he eases into James’ body, his voice strained as he asks, “how are you doing, sweetheart?”
Tony makes a muffled noise when Steve surges on top of him and seizes his mouth with his own. For a brief moment, Tony thinks about fighting him, knowing that Steve would let him go as if he had some disease if he thought, just for a moment, that Tony didn’t want him back. And then, he lets himself melt into the kiss, lets him grip at Steve with both hands, dig his nails into his skin to lay his mark on this man who can never be his.
It’s been almost a year since Steve picked the kids up from school; hell, he didn’t think that Miss Lewis even knew what he looked like, having only met him at orientation.
“She… she doesn’t know about Bucky; she doesn’t know about anything personal to do with you, I promise. And she definitely doesn’t know I used to be a total shrimp when I was younger. She thinks I was always-”
. They have taken up our whole lives; they have… become the entirety of our existences, and that’s okay, because that’s what they’re supposed to do, but it means that Steve and I, as a couple, are in a rut. We’re just fathers, you know? We just have kids. That’s our identity, and that’s not sexy, and we should feel sexy, so maybe the only way that Steve feels sexy is when he’s…”
“How will we find them now?” Tony asks, shooting James a flinty look over his shoulder. “Wanda needs us to do something for her now.”
Steve laughs, nipping at his throat, as the next thrust drags the air out of Tony’s lungs. “You-you know that I’m not talking about the damn couch, Tony.” He spreads Tony’s legs wider, as much as the couch would allow. “I never want to leave you. I want to spend the rest of my life inside you; fuck, I’d forgotten how good this feels, how good
“It would be nice to be kissed by someone who wants to kiss me and whom I want to kiss,” Tony says, honestly.
“Why do you think they sat us at the back?” Tony whispers, conspiratorially. “So, passers-by won’t think that
“If this sort of situation comes up again, do you think you can be strong enough to talk to Steve about this, without having to resort to the massive arguments that you’ve had in the past?”
“It’s important to know,” Tony interjects, “that I agreed, when he came to me,” he tells Steve, without flinching (he’s not going to apologise, to deny the choices that he made where James is concerned). “He came to me, and I agreed to help him, because I felt like he had to be helped.”
Tony looks at his husband one night over dinner, a rare event where Steve is at home on time to join them, even helps out when Maushmi and Peter would prefer to chat about school rather than eat the food on their plate, making noises and telling strange, fantastical stories about the fictional Captain America and Iron Man that Maushmi and Peter have been listening about since they were in diapers.
Tony is practically running, his bare feet skidding across the floor, and he rounds the kitchen door, and he’s immediately assaulted with the smell of chilli and boiling pasta.
He has more decency than that, and he loves James, he does, he doesn’t stop loving people even if they hurt him, as evidenced by Steve himself, but he’ll never touch him, never let James touch him, as long as Steve is there.
“He found the bugs, of course, put them in a little glass jar, and asked me to meet him in a park, so that I could destroy them without warning SHIELD. So, I pretended like the call came from Pepper, my PA, because something had gone wrong at Stark Industries, and told Steve and the kids I had to leave immediately.”
“I love you,” Tony blurts out when Steve gets off him and drags him to his feet. “I love you. I don’t… I don’t want to die here making you think I hate you, because I don’t. I love you.”
Maushmi stares at the photo, a rapid-fire sequence of emotions passing over her face, before it twists up, mutinous.
Their earlier argument lies forgotten, as Tony takes advantage of his husband’s full, undivided attention on him and his body in what seems like a hundred years.
“And when I go on a mission, I look at that video, and I get myself off in the jet’s bathroom.” Steve chuckles. “Believe me when I say that you turn me on.”
“After all, Steve and I are brothers, and brothers are meant to share; so, what if we shared an omega between us? If you’d grown big with my child, Steve would have no other option but to claim it anyway; after all, it would be his kin as well, and no one would ever be able to tell that we’d put horns on him. There would be no shame, because there would be no risk that the child wouldn’t look like Steve.”
The picture on the TV now shows a camera shot of a dark rubber body bag being carried into a coroner’s van. Just before the bag is lifted inside, Pepper’s bloodied, white arm slips from its zippered side and lolls into the dark night air.
“You might’ve gone back to Stone,” James retorts. “And then, I would’ve had to kill him, and that would’ve been messy, and I would’ve had to clean all of that up without any of it falling on you-”
“It’s just,” Steve drags his hand over his face, looking exhausted, “you get enough people telling you you’re a hero, after years of them telling you you’re nothing.” He looks away. “All I dreamed about was coming overseas, being on the front lines, serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted... and I’m wearing
Tony gnaws on his lower lip. “They arrested Natasha this morning,” he says, subdued. “It was my fault. She… she wanted to talk to me; she cornered me in the bushes on my way to school. But my dad okayed it with the police to trail me, just in case she decided to contact me, which she did. So, they arrested her. I’m sorry, I didn’t know–”
“I could,” Tony reminds him, and he doesn’t know how to explain this knot in his belly, the desire to be named the villain in this story so that he can finally be at peace. “I might have taken him into my bed willingly, and at the thought of you discovering what we have done, I killed him so as to spare me further dishonour.”
Steve drags his hand over his face. “I’m hoping that they’ll just think it was an awful nightmare,” he tells him, exhaustion showing through his eyes. “How’s Wanda?”
Tony feels the need to compensate. “I talked to Thor, though. He said that he’s not an expert in the things that Loki can do, but his mother is and he said that he would consult with her, to see if there’s a way to reverse it,” he says, quickly, hurriedly, reassuringly, stretching out a hand.
. I thought… you’d used me, that you just wanted sex and I was stupid and needy enough to think that you wanted more than that with me, and I was so fucking wrong.”
“I just,” Steve drags a hand over his face. “I wish you’d told me that’s all you wanted. I wished you’d been honest with me. I know that I’m not… I’m not the alphas you know, or you grew up with. I’m not, I went to art school, and my ma was a nurse, and I… I was barely making ends meet when I enlisted,
“I was so focused on my life and what I wanted from my life and what I had to do to get there, so I’d never have to sleep in a car again or have to get dressed before the creepy, pervy janitor caught me in the showers or have to choose between buying food or buying pads, that I didn’t realise that Pietro was struggling, that he needed me. By the time I realised, it was too late. I’d graduated, I’d got a job, I’d found Sam and married him, and honestly, I lost touch with him.”
There’s clearly a diamond attached to the band, and he brushes the pad of his finger over the sharp edges of the stone.
The blades are inches away from Tony’s face, and the man drools onto his face, making Tony screw up his expression in distaste. But just when the points of steel are less than an inch from his eyes, the old-fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to Tony’s head goes off with a jarring sound.
“Steve, wait,” Eshe’s voice is quiet but it’s firm enough that Steve does as she tells him to do. “I want Tony to talk. Is there any reason why you feel that way, Tony?”
There’s a knife-edge of suspicion in his voice, as if he doesn’t believe that Tony’s done all of this and had to wait to hear it from the horse’s mouth before he realised that Steve had been lying to him all these years.
of honour,” Rhodey stresses. “That doesn’t mean that I am suddenly an expert on what your clothing should be.”
“Are you the doctor?” the alpha asks, confused, looking Tony over up and down, before spots of colour appear in his cheeks.
The kids are at school, and when James knocks on the door, Tony thinks that he waited until they were gone before coming anywhere near the house.
Tony looks up at her, panic etched into his features, as he tries to wrench his arm away from the nurse. “Wait, wait, will it make me drowsy?” he demands. “Will it make–”
“Look, I have to be honest here, the concept of polyamory is… a complicated one. It’s not easy, I will warn you right off the bat. You both have the first step sorted; you’re willing to let someone into the relationship and be equal partners with the two of you. That’s where a lot of people fail. But things are more difficult for you from now on,” Eshe tells them.
“I can’t bear the thought of anything happening to you,” Steve says, fear casting a deep shadow over his face.
“I am afraid that your lover may need to come to terms with his… metamorphosis, because there is not anything that can be done to change him back to what he was earlier this day,” Loki says, slyly.
“You’re all either in the prime of your life, or you’re enhanced in some way. In any case, you’re all exceptionally beautiful, young, powerful, and I hate to be the one to say this, but you’re white. If you don’t think that I feel like the ugly cousin, well, I do.”
Two, three thrusts later, Steve is panting against the notches of Tony’s spine, and Tony knows that he’s going to come.
Rumlow approaches the chest. He stops a few feet from it, holding onto an ivory road, which he intends to place under the lid of the chest itself.
After several moments of the mine car totally out of control, far ahead, Tony can see a circle of bright daylight.
He’s waiting on their floor, pacing around the living room, in a pair of sweatpants that ride low on his thin, slim hips and a t-shirt that can only be Tony’s, considering that anything that fit his prior physique would have probably left him swimming inside it.
“It’s not enough,” Steve says, shyly. “Sorry, I should, uh, I might just get something from the vending machine, like a candy bar or a bag of chips or something.”
Steve nods to himself for a moment, his jaw working, as he considers it. His eyes slide over the decrepit bar, and then, suddenly, Steve is reaching for Tony, dragging him out from behind the bar and sweeping him into an embrace that crushes his bones, keeps their bodies pressed together so close, so tight that Tony doesn’t know where he begins and where Steve ends.
Peter and Maushmi stop playing almost immediately and turn to look at him in an eerily similar action.
, and Tony jolts, realising that they knew, HYDRA knew who Steve was, who James was, who Tony was, even things that Tony didn’t know until today, but Steve,
Steve groans and sits back on his heels. “She came with me to the jewellery shop. She… I thought she’d know better than me, you know, about what to get you for your birthday. She has better taste than I do, and I was so worried that I’d get you the wrong thing, really fuck your birthday up, so I asked her to come with me. And when we were there, I… I thought it would be a good idea to buy her something, you know, because she came with me all that way to the gold shop, and Tony, Tony, I have no fucking clue about gold, I really don’t, and Natasha-”
“Nothing. It’s just the, uh, the arc reactor…” Tony licks his lips. “I moved in a way that I shouldn’t have.” He smiles, wryly. “The unfortunate side-effect of fucking an old man like he’s a rent boy in his twenties.”
Lord Steven is at the head of his party, and he brings his horse to a stop, a great, heavy courser, almost as large as a destrier but looking much swifter. Lord Steven jumps down, briskly, feet landing in the dirt, and he sweeps his hand down the side of the horse, soothing it as it rears up in bad temper.
He guesses that’s him, and the two on either side of him is Peter and Maushmi, one with short hair and two, thick scratches as pants as Peter, and another with a triangular sort of dress and long hair flicked out in the ends.
Steve climbs onto the bed, sitting up on his knees, and then, he shuffles forward, leaning back between Tony’s thighs. He reaches out and curls his arms under Tony’s thighs, dragging him forward, so that he’s half-seated in Steve’s lap.
“You thought that by telling him about the neglect that he was causing you or the awful things that you felt about yourself and about your marriage and about him or your suspicions regarding his relationship with a colleague, it would… push him over the edge and he would leave you. Is that correct?”
“You should have told me,” Tony rebukes. “I got full around the tenth dumpling or so. I would have given you the last two.”
“We do, Peter,” Steve says, his voice grave like he’s swearing a vow. “We love you so much. We already think of you as ours.”
James groans, his head falling back, as Tony gets a good grip around him and starts stroking upwards, the heel of his hand rubbing over the head of his cock, where the pre-come starts to bead. Once he’s completely firmed up, Tony drags his teeth over his lower lip.

It is very much like the real one, except that the colours are off, brighter, and the furnishings look much newer.
tired now, because you didn’t care enough to tell me the truth as to why you were tired. Instead, you let me go on thinking that you didn’t want me anymore, that I had to beg for your attention, that you were screwing someone else, that you wanted pussy now that you’d had your taste of cock.”
issues, Steve. About love and trust and fidelity and self-esteem and self-hatred. Because my father used to cheat on my mother
Steve shuttles right out of the window, and Tony dives for the bed, jams off the light, disappearing under the covers. The door opens, and Jarvis appears in the open frame, bleary-eyed, and he flicks on the light by the door.
“Hey, you taught me how to fight, remember?” Tony points out. “I just used that skill and expertise and technique against those dumb frat boys who were roofying drunk chicks in college bars because they couldn’t get laid with consent.”
He is just as surprised to see them as they are to see him, but he recovers quickly, swinging a monkey wrench at Steve, deciding that he was the more pressing threat. Steve manages to grab the swinging arm before the wrench can make contact with him, and then, Tony is pressing himself against the wall, remaining hidden, moving fast among the crates, as Steve and the mechanic tumble out into the open, wrestling with each other.
There’s a man there as well, a man that Tony doesn’t immediately recognise, wearing a fedora with his arm slung around Howard’s shoulders.
Steve just sends him an obscene grin and crawls towards the edge of the mattress, opening up the drawer of the bedside table and fishing out the lube bottom, squeezing out a generous amount onto his fingers.
Sam sighs and rubs at his temples. “I don’t fucking know anymore,” he says, his voice flat, gravelly. “I am
It takes a while, but between the two of them, Tony and Steve are able to open up a cavity in that last chamber, where the sunlight was peeking through. Steve offers his hands, linked together, for Tony to put his foot on so that Steve can shove him through. Tony grunts, gripping onto the edge of the cavity, heaving himself over and onto his knees into the sweltering sun of the desert. He turns out, stretching himself out, on his stomach, his arms dangling over the edge of the cavity into the dark chamber below.
“Just wait,” James soothes. “I remember, okay? I remember how much shit we got back then, when we were young. They used to call us fags and beat the shit out of us, but we were brave, and we stood up to them. Pete
But no, Tony now knows why it has dwindled, and it’s because of a beautiful redhead named Natasha Romanoff.
He slips out of the embrace, and somehow, Steve remains as dead to the world as he ever was. He gathers his clothes, dressing quickly, keeping his eyes on Steve the entire time, just in case his eyes would open.
“Everything’s going to be fine,” Steve reassures. “I promise. I will be gone for a few moons, deal with this rebellion, throw Alexander Pierce back in the sea where he belongs, and before you even begin to miss my absence, I will return.”
!” he says, his voice all but a shout, as his eyes drag uneasily up to the ceiling, waiting for a long, terrible moment where he fears that the kids will wake up from the noise and start screaming.
The threats escalate. Guns are shoved in his face, and they threaten to cut off parts of his body. They scrape knives against his ankles and stomach and chest and between his legs, reminding him that he only needs his tongue to talk – the rest of him is expendable.
James blushes. “They, uh, HYDRA, they did stuff to me, injections and other experimentation crap that affects my testosterone levels.”
Tony sets his legs wide open, planting his feet squarely on the mattress. “Now, what are you going to do?”
me, over your kids. I don’t know if you did it on purpose, if you got sick of me flaunting my religion, my culture around, asking you if I could raise the kids Hindu and vegetarian, whether you baulked at the idea that your kids looked more like me than they did you, or whether it was subconscious, the fact that you wanted to be with someone who shared your life experiences, more than just the whole SHIELD agent thing, but someone who grew up the same way that you did, and colour
It takes a while before Peter and Maushmi feel safe to let Tony leave, and even then, he’s loathed to do so.
“Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma,” Dr. Banner explains. “Don't worry, they go away.”
“I don’t know if I get a say in this,” James chimes in, awkwardly, hands in his pockets, rocking back on his heels, “but I don’t think you should come.”
Natasha has to leave, though, one day; she has to leave because her sister, Yelena, is ill, and Natasha is the only one to care for her. She promises that she will return as soon as possible, and Tony allows her to leave with a smile, even if the dread is opening a pit in his belly, as he embraces her goodbye.
“This is… you don’t know what this means to me,” Tony says, his voice rough, like his vocal cords are dragging on gravel. “You don’t… this is
Tony and Steve look at each other – honestly, Tony would much rather be going home with Steve instead of to that mausoleum he calls home.
Phillips throws his hands up in the air. “When you invited a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide because I assumed he’d be useful to you. Like a gerbil. I never thought you’d pick him.”
James pulls back, and Tony turns the key into the ignition, pushing his foot down against the gas and driving away, his heart lurching in his chest.
Wanda laughs, high and lilting. “You know, my husband is a counsellor at the VA. You pick up a few things along the way.”
Tony nods, shamefully. “I know, I know it was bad. I know… you know, I’ve given Steve a lot of shit for lying to me all these months, and I know became just as bad as he did when I lied to him about James, but-” he rubs at his temples, “I met James at the park, and I didn’t destroy the bugs. I made it so that the reversed the connection, so that James would be able to hear what they were saying on the other end. I came home, and Steve knew, he knew that I’d lied, because he called Pepper, and she told him that she hadn’t spoken to me, that there were no issues with any of the orders going through. He accused me of having an affair; we got into another fight, and when I woke up the next morning, he wasn’t in the house. I came over to your place, because I was intending to pick up the kids, but Wanda and I got into talking about this, a short-form version of this, and I came to the realisation that I needed to speak to Steve about our marriage, to clear up the air.”
Tony feels the smile stretch across his face. “It could be,” he says, vaguely. “How did you want to spend your extra-special weekend?”
Tony has fucked up his kids so much that his son, at four, is already worried about what people would think of him so he wanted to protect himself from that, protect himself from the judgment of people around him, keep up appearances by making another drawing that seemingly displayed his happy family.
Their eyes widen with fright – wow, he’s going to hell for deliberately frightening children, isn’t he?
Tony grabs a flashlight lolling on one of the chairs and bashes the pilot on the back of the head. The pilot drops down into the cockpit, his body falling on the throttle, and the engines roar louder, revving up.
Tony smiles after them, unable to stop the fondness to curl in the empty spaces in his ribcage. “Yeah, they are,” he says, unable to drive the affection from his voice.
weapons, know them in my bones, know them like they’re my heart. I know how to use them and kill people using them.”
Tony grips the phone tight. “Thanks.” He presses the cool metal screen against his chest, where his heart thumps in his ribcage. “I guess I’ll, uh, see you later?” he says, chewing on his lower lip.
Steve shrugs. “You start running, they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back, can’t say no forever, right?”
“I thought I’d changed it up for once,” Steve closes the menu with a flash of his pearly-white teeth. “No reason to get complacent with food choices.”
Then, he hears it, feels the cold first, feels it seep into his bones, like he’s just been stripped naked, standing in the darkness. He shivers, and he wants to turn, wants to run, but it’s as though there’s some connection not being made between his brain and his limbs.
to leave. And you didn’t just leave; you resigned from the university; you dumped your apartment, and you dumped
“I think I know what it was about,” Steve says, grimly, rubbing his hand over his face. “God, we shouldn’t have even come to school today.”
When they’re done and lying on the bed, panting, with Tony’s arm thrown over his shoulder, as sweat dampens his entire body, he turns onto his side and surveys Steve with all the sterile gaze as one might a solid eggplant he was going to roast over the stove.
“Look, I know that you’re the kind of guy that likes to avoid emotional problems, and surprisingly, it hasn’t caused any major problems in our relationship yet, but I have a feeling it’s going to cause problems
This is the first time that he’s seen Tony and Steve in their element, how they fight like animals, clawing and biting and stripping each other of hide and defence until they’re both laid bare, and they don’t spare each other, they never
“I don’t need anyone to reward me. All I need is for you to know that you have me on your side. Just tell me the truth, Tony, and everything will be fine. You don’t ever need to hide anything from me in fear of judgment.”
“These two have declared their consent to be married before God,” the priest says, grandly, “and what God joins together, let no one put asunder. I assume you have rings.”
Men like Tony’s father find girls who aren’t their wives to get off with, so they can feel young and handsome, instead of old and sagging. Men like Tony’s father screw as many people as they can because they
Toni scowled again and held the ring box close to her chest. “Look, if I wanted big diamonds, I would buy them for myself. I don’t need you to do it for me. I like this ring.”
Tony sits in the wheelhouse on their way out of the Stark Lands; he would have ridden his horse, but omegas are not supposed to ride like alphas; omegas are supposed to prefer the propriety of the wheelhouse, so he takes to the wheelhouse.
Steve grabs the remote off the bedside table, flicking the television directly opposite the bed on. “What episode were we on again?”
Steve took her hand in his and started rubbing her knuckles and the tendons in the back of her hand.
“Steve,” Tony says, slowly, wrapping his tongue around the word. “Steve, I want you, I want to be with you in that way; I want to be your omega in all the ways possible.”
She reaches for him, but Tony dodges her, cracking his jaw. Jarvis is there, thankfully, still having his back even in this moment, and Tony reaches for the box that he’d dropped on the coffee table.
He is handsome enough, tall enough, strong enough, all the things that omegas want in their alphas, but he wonders if the lord is kind.
Beside him, Steve’s scent is thick, warm, comforting, heady, an alpha that he likes, that he wants – not all alphas smell like him.
Pepper looks as though she is about to protest, and Tony shakes his head. Pepper sucks on her teeth, disapprovingly, with a cold look Lord Steven’s way, before she disappears around the corner.
“I…” Tony looks at Steve, something gnawing in his gut. “I want to build something that lasts, something that doesn’t break as easily as our marriage did at the first sign of… I don’t know, trouble.”
If he were braver, he’d leave the bed, find a spare room and make his displeasure known, but Tony has always settled for scraps from those he loves the most. Steve is nothing new where that is concerned.
“Because I thought at first, if I confronted you over it, you’d stammer a bit, you’d deny it, but you’d finally have the fucking dignity to admit it to my face, not like you seem to be doing right now, of course,” he says, derision lining his voice. “I thought, actually,
Howard looks at the police officers, staring them down, and they all leave – money buys silence and obedience. Sarah rushes over to Steve, enveloping him in her thin, pale arms, pressing her lips furiously to the top of his head; Steve clutches at her as well, and Tony aches for that kind of comfort, until his mother walks over and places a hand on his shoulder – it’s the best he’s going to get out of her.
“I’m sorry I didn’t realise that any of this was happening. I’m sorry I… was so preoccupied with my husband and my family-”
Tony doesn’t know what prompts him, but he reaches out to take Steve’s hand. Steve’s fingers flex underneath his, but he doesn’t pull away. Tony squeezes it.
“Why? Because I look like this?” The look in Steve’s eyes turns caustic, and there’s a dash of furious colour in his face (Tony’s already worried; his heart is already hammering in his chest). “I didn’t realise you were so fucking shallow, but what should I have expected from playboy Tony Stark–”
He sets them down, his hands falling to the tops of their heads, threading his fingers through their hair.
“You looked guilty as hell when I showed you that bracelet,” Steve says, stonily. “You lied to me that day, didn’t you? He was here, your
“I’m on leave,” Tony explains. “My sire doesn’t like me to be too far away from the roost. Unbonded omega travelling the world with alphas and all. Too much scope for something horrible to happen, which, as you already know, can easily happen.”
At the end of the dead-end, they can see it, a large farmhouse repurposed into a school, with a sign out front.
stretched very much to the Stark household as well (not that it mattered in the long run, because Tony became terribly competent in getting away from the assholes who were willing to kidnap little children, and it usually ended with the kidnapping location burning to the ground). He barely remembers how she did it, but there’s a ratty old notebook with every page in his mother’s handwriting in his bedside drawer that should help him out.
There’s a speeding sedan on the screen, a screech of brakes, and a last-second scream as someone goes crashing through the glass window on the screen, ending in a horrible collision. Tony grabs the remote, trying to find the right button to turn it off or change the channel.
“Steve is an archaeologist as well. He came looking for this,” Tony says, pulling the medallion from under the neckline of his shirt, handing it over to Bhim.
Obadiah growls and slashes him with those knives on his hand, cutting deep into Tony’s arm, just below the burn. Tony yelps and kicks him hard in the stomach.
“Well, the two of you have only recently started getting your marriage back on track. I have to ask whether it is wise adding another element to your relationship right now.”
, in our religion is, I suppose, the span of the universe, how long it takes for it to begin and then, end. There are four
, and I fucked up. I let this asshole near you, and he hurt you, and I will have to live with that for the rest of my life, and when I saw those photos,” Howard’s voice cracks, “when I saw those photos, I wanted him dead, I wanted him to suffer the way he’d made you suffer, I wanted him to be scared and hurt and feeling like shit the same way he’d made you feel, because you are my
“What are you guys up to?” Steve looks at him, and then, at Natasha, who looks just as displeased, and over Natasha’s shoulder is Pepper, lingering in the doorway.
One of his hands tighten around Tony’s throat, and he’s choking, his lungs burning, his body hot all over, and he can’t breathe, and he’s swiping at Obadiah with all of the strength he can possibly muster, but it doesn’t seem to be enough to remove his hand, to force him to withdraw.
“You coming to bed or what?” he asks. “Cause you were the one who was very clear about me needing better sleeping habits.”
“Did it bother you, Steve, when you came back that day with the kids, and I wasn’t there?” Tony mocks.
“Because you have a lot more heart and a lot more perseverance than anyone else that I’ve ever met, Steve Rogers.”
Grant chuckles, a dark sound that has the pit in his belly opening wide. He comes closer, and Tony has the sudden urge to back away.
Tony can’t take his eyes off Peter, off Maushmi, these two beautiful creations in his arms, and his heart swells with love, making his chest burn and ache.
He would never have expected it from her, the image of the redhead, with her gleaming green eyes, like a cat, and her sly little smile and the way she tossed her hair, every angle of her body like an invitation, fitting into his vision.
Of course, it all goes to shit when she finally gets to the front of the aisle, and just as Thor begins to officiate the ceremony, Bucky and Steve’s phones begin to ring, shrilly.
“Okay, so, let’s look at this log, which should help us sort of muddle our way through the… well, what the curriculum sets as the benchmarks for kids that Peter and Maushmi’s age,” Ms Lewis offers. “So, they both can identify and write their letters.”
He screams at the same time that Obadiah’s knives pierce through the glass, shards flying, through the back of Howard’s head and out through his eyes, blood spraying and gushing everywhere, before Obadiah’s other arm reaches out, grabs Howard’s limp corpse and drags him back into the mirror.
But Tony can’t be fucked feeling any sympathy towards his husband’s mistress, and he can’t ignore the similarities, at face value at least, between him and Natasha Romanoff, because this might not just be an affair.
“I know,” Maushmi admits, grudgingly. Her eyes widen. “But why did you sleep in the guest room, Appa? If I had your bed, I wouldn’t leave it at all,” she says, definitively. “And what about Daddy?”
“Yeah. I can make another one, or I’m sure I have like a hundred sitting in my drawer in my workshop, but DUM-E always rearranges everything,” Tony mutters.
But Steve looks at him with no less affection or lust in his eyes than before he’d decided to give him a hand job.
HYDRA, so I justified it to myself, and he asked me not to make a scene. Even pointed me to the guy’s phone, which had some…” he closes his eyes, “let’s just say that the guy that James killed liked kids, kids younger than ten.”
Tony processes the words, and his face twists with revulsion, his stomach actually rebelling against the words.
Tony covers his face with his hands, as if that would scour the image of Pepper’s brutalised corpse from his mind. And then, he’s running, his waist curving around the open windowsill, so that he can throw up the contents of his stomach into the bushes.
“You don’t have to be,” Tony tells him. “Contrary to popular belief, an erection is not needed to have an orgasm. Just… do you trust me?”
Tony flies down some stairs and starts to round a corner, searching for Steve. Suddenly, he throws himself backward, out of view. Three uniformed Nazis are clustered near a cabin door holding one of Rhodey’s men. Two more come out of the cabin trying to maintain their grasp on a struggling Steve. More Nazis clamber onto the deck and head toward Tony, slamming open doors, rousing pirates, shouting out racial epithets that make Tony cringe and rage curdle in his gut.
want to be with me. Which means that everything that I went through, the humiliation, the sense of worthlessness, the misery, all of it was for nothing. I put up with so much shit from you and from my father, and it was all for nothing. You made us
“No,” he sighs. “No, that didn’t come out right. It didn’t… I didn’t mean it like that. I didn’t… I’m not having an affair,” he says, stubbornly. “There was… before I met Steve, back in college, there was this guy. James. He and I were… we were really good friends, and then, for one night, we were more than just friends. I was… I was crazy about him, I loved him desperately, and for one night, I was so sure he loved me too. And the next morning, he was gone.”
Tony’s on his back, and Steve pulls him forward, so that his legs are splayed over Steve’s lap, his ass resting on his thighs, as Steve crosses his legs underneath him. Steve’s hands are huge on the insides of his thighs, as Steve spreads him open to look his fill, his eyes dragging down from Tony’s bitten, swollen lip, to the flush over his chest, his hard cock straining upward towards his stomach, and his hole, still empty and grasping and sloppy with streaks of Steve’s come.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees a Nazi take off after him. Tony runs along an alleyway and soon encounters a wall, looking around five-foot-tall.
“I do,” Maushmi pipes in. She leans forward, almost toppling out of Steve’s arms, if he hadn’t grabbed onto her before she fell to the ground. “Are you going to stop them from coming after us again?”
take it slow, remember? We let James go and see his therapist, deal with the conditioning and the brainwashing and so, he could get his memories back in a safe space, without having to worry about we think or what we’d say. James, what do you think?”
“The right partner,” Steve says, after a moment, and when their eyes meet, it’s like a livewire rushing down Tony’s spine, settling between his legs. “I meant,” he says, breathlessly, clearly affected as well, “I meant you could do anything? Why join the army?”
“Come on, let’s go,” Tony says, curtly, ripping his hand out of Steve’s and moving down the corridor.
Steve brings him dumplings, and a box for himself. Tony props his set on his lap, thankful for the thick blankets that he’s lying under so he can’t feel the burn from the bottom of the takeaway container.
“I…” Tony shakes his head, comes closer to the kids so that he can crouch in front of him. He holds his arms out, and they come closer, close enough to touch his knees. “Where did you… where did you learn that word?”
, Steve. It’s by virtue of the fact that you’re white and I’m not. It means that you having an affair is made even worse by the fact that you chose a white woman
. She, who was so interesting, and where you didn’t have any responsibilities. You could just be any red-blooded man, and I would think about you fucking her and laughing with her about me, and it would just… I would want to threw up. I’m pretty sure I did throw up a few times actually.” He shakes his head. “And that night, at the restaurant, I felt
Steve has his bullwhip in his hand before Tony can even open his mouth (and it’s on the tip of his tongue to point out what kind of weapon is a fucking whip).
, and yes, you’ve tried very hard to explain your actions, but you still ran away from you. No, you didn’t
Once the food is done, and the kids are full, Tony begins to pack away the boxes to be thrown out in the rubbish later on.
. I wanted a fucking partner in all of this. And I love how you’ve forgotten every fucking time that I made a move and you rejected me.”
you, I love you more than anything else in the world, in my life, except for my mother. You, you’re all I have, you and Ma. I know I fucked up, but you can trust me, Tony. You can trust me with your life, and I will protect it. Tony, I would kill for you, I would
Steve stops moving inside him. “What?” he says, sounding breathless himself. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
Tony opens his mouth, about to say something either incredibly stupid or incredibly heart-warming, but he doesn’t get a shot to even push a word out, because Steve’s expression is shuttering over, closing off to everyone and anyone, and he lifts his head.
Tony rubs the back of his neck, awkwardly. “My father thought you might need my assistance,” he offers.
White cliff falls away into the turbulent sea, which spits up a waterfall of water, sending birds screeching and soaring away from the land that looks like it might not survive the impending destruction.
Tony crawls over, his hand dripping with lube, and he smooths another hand over the dip of his spine, the small of James’ back, before his fingers find his rim, tucked between his cheeks, and he prods his fingers against the furled skin there.
“I guess… I guess I would’ve thought that I was a rebound,” he says, recalling how earlier he’d said those words aloud, even in the present context. “I guess I would’ve thought I was second choice, that he was just using me to get over his first love, that I would always come second to him. I probably would’ve thought I was the consolation prize. I… I have settled for a lot of shit in my life, and I probably would’ve settled for being Steve’s rebound, but it doesn’t mean that I would’ve been happy about it.”
Tony sighs. “I can’t, I’m afraid. I can’t do a good Bullwinkle impression.” A grin blazes across his face. He pats him on the shoulder. “You got a phone number I can reach you on?”
Tony shakes his head, his mood dulling. “All day long, I’ve been seeing that guy's weird face, and hearing those fingernails…” he trails off.
The nurse looks at him, shocked. “Honey, this is liable to be very painful without it. Take it from me. You want this.”
“I can live without the adrenaline rush,” Tony says, sternly, pulling away to look him in the eye. “I
“You had concerns about him and the danger he presented, but you didn’t have those conversations with your husband? Why?”
Steve’s hand cups the slope of his hip. “Did you want me to treat you rough, sweetheart?” he rasps, his voice dark and promising.
AI, and he does whatever you want him to do, say whatever you want him to say?” Steve points out, his voice sharpening at the edges.
“Now,” Steve smiles, pain etched in all of the lines around his mouth, “now, I know that you can’t love me, that you’ll never be able to love me, and that’s fine, I understand that, I understand–” He closes his eyes. “I have the same face as the man who brutalised you for months. How could you possibly love me? But I know when you asked me to come to your bed, you were asking me out of duty. I want you to love me, and if you can’t love me, that is fine. Your… your value to me is not based on how often that you spread your legs for me, Tony, or the number of children that you bear. I do not see such things when I look at you, and I am fine. You do not need to feel bothered or required to attend to me in such a way. It would be unfair for me to expect such a thing from you. I
Tony closes his eyes and bites his tongue against the urge to punch him in the face. “Steve, I need to know something. Do you have any pictures of Bucky?”
Tony looks around, and Steve is no longer in the room. “No, where’s Steve?” he mumbles, fear bright and sharp in his chest.
Toni’s brow knits together. “I don’t think I’m unhappy because I think you’re going away from here to cheat on me with someone else. I think I’m unhappy because I’ve been waiting for this day for a while, and I don’t want it to be… you know, put off or reduced in any way, but if this girl is in danger, well, that’s more important, okay? You should go.
Coulson purses his lips, staring at Tony, and then, Steve, and then, finally, sighs, “Make it fast.”
“Hey, Petey-pie,” Steve says, cheerfully, pressing a smacking kiss to the side of his head. “What are you and your Amma building?”
“Such a pretty cunt you’ve got, baby,” Steve says, approvingly. “Takes care of me so good, just like you.”
run; you fucked me, you left me naked in your bed, and then, you ran, and you left me some shitty note that didn’t explain anything. So, you don’t get to come back here, after all of these years, and judge me for the choices that I’ve made in the time being. You don’t get to judge me for moving on without you, for having a life
“If I fall asleep after this, you’re not going to sneak out of bed, out the house, are you?” Tony demands, his voice stronger this time around.
The bell rings, and they’re swallowed up in the crowd before Steve can address Tony’s latest conspiracy theory.
They make their way along the side of the center court, both of them straining to pull the chest. One Nazi stops directly in front of them, looking at them queerly. Steve doesn’t hesitate to knock him out with the butt of his Luger just as Tony is about to fire.
Steve shifts so that Tony can rest his head on his chest, his hand cradling the crown of Tony’s head. “I never doubted you,” he says, honestly.
“Tony, at seventeen, you’d already accomplished more than what most people accomplish in their entire lives,” James tells him, softly. “At seventeen, you had more bachelors’ and masters’ degrees than anyone. You had
Tony doesn’t return the favour, chews on his lower lip until he hears Steve’s breathing slow, and desperately tries to claw back the tears that sting at his eyes.
“What is it?” Tony asks, the anger lighting up like a wick in a vat of oil. “You not turned on by me anymore, is that it? Is it because I’ve put on a little weight, or is it because I have wrinkles now, and I’m getting old? What the fuck is it, Steve?”
Tony smiles. “A very good thing,” he promises. He kisses Steve, softly. “I’ll never forget this night, Steve Rogers.”
Steve gives him the finger over his shoulder, without taking his eyes off what’s cooking in the pot.
“He is, by all accounts, a very quiet individual. He doesn’t not talk much, struggles with the courtesies that you have been raised in, shows that he is lowborn with his speech. He does not have much respect for the highborn. He is a man who has worked with his hands, my lord–Tony,” she amends when he sends her a glower over his shoulder. “He is not the perfumed lord that your father and mother may have bonded you off to, but he does not appear to be one that would treat you unkindly.”
“You gonna come for me, honey, come inside Tony, make him all wet and sloppy and open with your come?” Steve says, his voice almost as a taunt, as he pounds into him like he’s on a mission.
Stone isn’t some guy who drugged a college girl during a frat party and raped her; Stone isn’t a guy who got controlling and thought his girlfriend was cheating on him in high school.
Or are they a hotel couple? Does she invite him for a cheese platter and a champagne bucket in a four-star hotel room that smells like new, breakable things and tastes like opulence and they have sex on a million-thread-count sheets and Steve feels like he’s in the lap of luxury without the tiresome existence of adulthood and marriage and children to spoil his fun? Tony could give him that, if that’s what he wanted. He fails to see any possibility where Natasha Romanoff could buy Steve luxury that Tony, being one of the wealthiest people in the world, could not. Or maybe it’s a cheap motel room, with the cockroaches and the semen stains all over the walls, a Dateline special in its making, where they feel as tawdry as the sin they’re committing on dirty sheets, watching grainy porn on the television set that hasn’t been seen in a household since the early 90s?
Tony has beautiful children, twins, for one, who are kind and smart and polite and healthy. When he looks at Peter and Maushmi, he can’t believe he ever thought he was capable of love, because anything he felt before the moment where they laid the two babies in his arms is nothing compared to what he feels now. It’s the sort of love that makes his lungs stretch to impossible limits, like he’s about to break apart, like he’s going to be unstitched and all of his insides will spill out, because a mortal, flesh and blood body is just not enough for this sort of love. It’s a terrifying kind of love, one where his lungs and heart are perpetually in his throat, because he’s constantly afraid, constantly worried for them, waiting for the moment where the bough breaks.
Ms Lewis smiles, as if she already knew that. “They’re good with their sounds, and they can rhyme words. They’re already ahead of the class in their reading. In fact, I saw Peter reading James and the Giant Peach, the other day?”
Steve tells her about when he and Natasha were put on the Winter Soldier’s surveillance. He tells her about the day that he was in his car, outside James’ apartment, and watched as Tony drove up and entered the apartment and didn’t come out for hours. He tells her about the primal fear so raw, so intense that it had taken his breath away, how his hand had gone to his gun, ready to intervene and to get Tony away from such a monster, and then, he’d watched as the door opened and Tony reacted like he knew who the Winter Soldier was, that it didn’t bother him, that somehow he knew in his bones that the Winter Soldier, scourge of free nations all over the world, whose kill counts linger somewhere in the thousands, probably the most competent assassin of all time,
But men like Steve don’t do that, don’t resort to casual things to make themselves feel better. Men like Steve find life partners, people to share everything with, to build a family with, to fall in love with and to have picnic lunches out in public with, and Tony knows this, because Steve did all of those things with him.
“Tony,” Steve says, gently, landing on the ground beside him. “Tony, what’s wrong? Why are you crying?” he asks, desperate and half-wild, unsure of what to do.
, which is unfair because James has clearly been hurt so much to the point where he doesn’t even remember what his name is, what his mother looked like, or his best friend’s face.
that with me right now. I was fucking worried about you, okay,” Steve growls. “You weren’t here; JARVIS didn’t know where you were. You might have… you might have had an accident or ended up in hospital or something terrible might have happened to you, and I wouldn’t have known, so, yeah, I was freaking the fuck out. You don’t get to stand there and pretend like I’m overreacting.”
Tony stops, when he hears the sound of something clawing at the window. He looks over into the dark of the kitchen, seeing the killer prying at the glass with his knife-fingers, trying to crack the window from the frame.
“I am sorry for your loss,” Lord Steven says, immediately. “I… I suppose this is my lowborn way of thinking, but I thought we should speak before we spend the rest of our lives together, and I wanted to hear your thoughts on the match before we go ahead with it.”
“You don’t have to thank me,” Wanda huffs. “They are just children. What sort of human being would I have been if I allowed them to get hurt? And those men, the ones that broke into my house and took the kids and hit me, they’re dead, right?”
“I’m done,” he says, briskly, and climbs out of the bed, taking the towel that Natasha hands him, drying himself, rubbing where he’s already raw to make sure he wipes up any dirt that he didn’t catch.
The plane begins to roll, rotating around its one still-blocked set of tires. Tony tries to push the pilot’s body off the throttle, but to no avail, as he’s a heavyset fellow.
“Take this,” Steve says, urgently, and from his neck, he pulls his chain, the shield pendant glinting in whatever light there is in this dysfunctional boiler room.
Maushmi approaches him, her hands thrust out like she’s surrendering. “I told you this already,” she stammers. “I told you, we wanted you to grow up normal, Tony. We wanted you to forget. We didn’t want you carrying this for the rest of your life; we didn’t want this as a burden on your head, and you didn’t… you seemed to move on with your life,
“Steve, we don’t have to do anything that you don’t want to do,” Tony soothes, even as his lungs begin to deflate in his chest, out of disappointment. “If you don’t want that fantasy, we can just, uh, we can just have sex and go to bed? Or-”
The way that Steve is looking at James now, this is Bucky Barnes, the Bucky Barnes that he was before Afghanistan happened.
On the back of his right hand is a thin streak of blood where the knuckle on his index finger sits. He rubs at it, insistently until it becomes pink and he can explain it away as paint, listening to Toni tell him about all the awful things her board of directors said when they thought she couldn’t hear them with an appropriate sympathetic smile on his face.
Everyone falls silent, when there’s a distant scraping against the house, just outside the window. Something multiple, thin and sharp, like a claw made of metal.
But this was his doing; if it wasn’t for him, if he’d been able to anticipate anything like this, Wanda, his friend, would never have been hurt, would never have ended up in hospital.
he told me that tonight’s the night that you don’t cook and that he brings take-out, and so, I offered to bring it over for you, because I knew you’d be busy with the kids.”
He starts stroking Steve’s cock, even if the flesh is limp between his fingers. It’s an odd sensation for both of them, Tony admits, and he makes sure to use his left hand to rub over the head of Steve’s cock with the heel of his palm.
Natasha shakes her head. “There were some… experimental medical procedures used, so he was kept in a secret facility for a while, and we were all told that he was dead because… well, honestly, they didn’t know whether he was going to survive after those experimental procedures.”
“Tony,” Sam says, in that patient, fearless way that Tony has always appreciated from him, “Tony, you know that’s not as odd that you think it is, right?”
Peter doesn’t say anything, but he’s shuddering, shivering in Tony’s arms like he’s cold, and Tony tightens his arms around them.
They make their way through the preschool hall to the office, with Steve watching every door at once.
That look is like a blow to Tony’s face, as he realises what those dreams were about, and the pained, hopeful look mirrored on Steve’s face has the added effect of twisting a knife in his gut and pulling his insides out.
Tony’s throat flexes. “I was looking. I got a few hits on a birth certificate from back in the sixties, but nothing else.”
with it, you dumbass. I was okay with it all. I would’ve gone anywhere and everywhere with you, because it was
,” Toni says, breathlessly, one hand gripping his shoulder, the other on the headboard. “God, you’re such a fucking freak, I swear. You look like a nice boy, but you’re just fucking filthy in all the right ways.”
this marriage, clearly I was a fucking idiot,” he says, furiously. “Because you threw me away for someone else.”
. You don’t want me. My own fucking husband, and he wants someone else more, and I have spent this whole time
He turns, seeing a platoon of tired, wounded soldiers gathered in a group, while an ambulance rolls up to the hospital tent. Corps alphas unload the wounded on stretchers.
He drives very close to the speed limit on his way home, his mind unable to ease, and when he throws open the door to his house, his heart somewhere in his throat, he calls out for JARVIS sharply, asking where the kids are.
“Oh, come on, Tony. All of your moves worked. For fuck’s sake, you used to sit on my lap, and yeah, I got hard. It took everything in me to not kiss you every time you opened that stupid, gorgeous mouth,” James says, derisively. “And all those assholes that you touched so easily in front of me, God, I could’ve clawed their fucking guts out for putting their worthless hands on you.”
Dread, awful, grisly, dread sinks low in his belly, like a sack full of stones. “I… I told you, I had to go to Stark Industries-”
Tony gets into the backseat of his car with Ana, while his mother and Jarvis sit up front, with the latter in the driver’s seat.
Alpha do as they please to their omega brides; if Steven Rogers wants him dead, wants to beat him black and blue for some perceived slight, he does not need to be a bad man to do it.
“But your father left for a few weeks on a business trip, and you were still scared, still terrified, still being hurt, so it wasn’t him. I thought, I went through everyone that we knew, even your mother, Steve, and it wasn’t any of them. That left Obadiah. So, I came to you, and you were in tears, and I asked you if it was Obadiah doing this, hurting you, and you nodded. You told me it was him, and I told you that I would make everything better.”
,” Tony says, pathetically earnest, but it’s the truth (he knows that, he really does; at the end of everything, even if Steve has gone so far away from him and the life that they were building together, he knows that Steve loves him, will never stop loving him; Steve just isn’t that sort of person). “Things are… things are bad, they
in my life right now, not when she made me think-” He shakes his head. “She made me think you were sleeping with someone else,” he whispers, “and I know that it’s not fair to blame her, but I can’t help but associate her with everything that’s gone wrong all these months, and to hear you defending her, scolding
Steve chews on his lower lip. “So, how do you want to play this?” he asks, carefully. “You go first, and then, five minutes later, I show up?”
James looks down at his feet. “What I meant before…” he hesitates for an agonising moment, “I saw you with the kids… a lot. That’s all I really saw at the beginning: you taking them to school, you bringing them from school, you taking them to lessons. It was just the three of you. And then, sometimes, I’d see him. Your husband. He usually shows up at home really later, after nine at the very least. And he leaves very early. Six, normally. He very rarely comes out with you and the kids. He never comes out with
“I don’t know what to think anymore,” Steve says, furiously, throwing his hands up in the air, his fingers clenching and unclenching around air, as if he wants to fist them in his hair. “I just don’t. You… you’ve been lying to me constantly, you disappear from the house and no one knows where you go, you’ve been acting so differently, and I don’t know what to think anymore. Today, today, after all the shit you gave me about my attitude when we fucked last night, you took a call from this guy that you’ve had sex with before, and you came up to me and you came up to our children and you
It’s just him now, and this house, the one that Tony had left behind, like this undefinable tribute to him, the one that doesn’t know how to live and breathe without him (the others are different, Rhodey and Pepper and Peter, they’re all capable of living and breathing without him; once upon a time, Steve thought he could too, and then, he loved Tony and married him and made a life with him and then lost him and realised,
“Kids do that. They get so attached to their parents being a single unit, and from what you’re saying, your children already some indication that all wasn’t well between the two of you, so they decided to keep you together the only way that they know how, because they can’t understand the issues that go on behind closed doors,” Eshe says, gently.
Steve purses his lips. “Then, this is the guy, right? He’s the guy who killed them, who killed Pepper and Natasha. Obadiah Stane. Do you know who he is?”
“I have four years on you,” Lord Steven replies. “It would not… it would not be right. It would be immoral and irresponsible.”
“–and what, I fucked her?” Stone offers. “Is that why you’re doing this? Because I meet a lot of girls, Rogers, and a lot of ‘em don’t wear wedding rings and they give it up ‘cause I’m rich, and I’m sorry, man, I’m sorry if I fucked your girl or whatever, but hey, maybe I did you a favour–”
Steve takes it, his palm dry in Tony’s, and it causes his heart to lurch a little in his chest, but then, he tugs, and Steve is climbing to his feet.
Tony shudders at the next thrust, the coarse pubic hair at the base of his cock rubbing up against the insides of Tony’s thighs. Steve’s fingers bite into his hips, tight enough to bruise, and Steve dips his head down, mouthing at the tender, warm spot where his pulse throbs fast and wild. Steve bottoms-out and Tony cries out when the next thrust brushes his prostate, digging his nails into Steve’s shoulder blades, raking thin, red lines down the length of his back.
Steve sets a harsh rhythm, hands tight on Tony’s hips, fucking in fast and hard, and Tony’s nails dig into the brick with no purchase. He reaches behind, gripping at Steve’s shoulder, trying to pull him in closer, and Steve’s nudging his nose at Tony’s shoulder blade, pointed even through the material of Tony’s blazer. He fucks him with enthusiasm, and Tony pushes his hips back, determined to get as much of him as possible. There’s no skill to his movements, no grace, just vigour, lacking finesse, a frantic roll of his hips, and a frantic roll back from Tony.
