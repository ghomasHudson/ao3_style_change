“I said,” Cas repeats. “Did you want help with that?”
She moves her hand back, and Dean closes his eyes and waits for the killing blow.
Jody and Donna, each carrying one of the girls, also came to stand on the platform.
“I'm sorry.” He says, the shame in his voice loud and clear despite being muffled by the pillow. “I'm sorry, I tried to wait…”
“I dunno, man, coupla days maybe.” Dean rubs the back of his neck, and looks back at Cas in the passenger seat of Baby. “It smelled ripe.”
What's more, he doesn't want to be.
he supposes it’s only right that Cas claimed him in turn.
“And you know what? I’m taking that iris with me. And I’m willing to bet your little angel friend over there’s been cursed by it, hasn’t he? So what’s going to happen when I take it away, hm? What...unfortunate accident will befall him? A car hitting him as he crosses the street? He trips over a crack in the sidewalk and brains himself on the curb?” Her hazel eyes glint with malicious mirth. “Or maybe I’ll just take him with me? He may not be an angel anymore, but I’m sure he still has...uses.” She laughs lowly, and Dean feels dread permeate through the haze her grip on his neck has left him wading through at the thought of this bitch hurting Cas. Rage builds with it, swelling into the corners of his instincts, and he snarls at her.
“And now you’re telling me that you sold a prize winning iris to a nameless shmuck?! Do you know how
Balthazar was right, of course. It
Dean has never worshipped anything in his life, never given over his mind, body, and soul to something much bigger than him, until this moment. But right now, he whispers praise into Cas’s skin like it's a prayer, a benediction. He touches the former angel like he's something precious, something that could crumble to dust with a single breath, something holy and beautiful.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “What’s so bad about wanting to marry for love?”
“I’m sorry.” Dean said, sincerely.
“I believe I may have hurt my wrist,” he admits. “And bruised my knee, but I am otherwise unharmed.” He looks at the floor and grimaces. “I’m sorry about the pies, Dean.” His voice is soft, and Dean’s heart constricts for a moment at how forlorn he sounds.
on the hipbones Dean longs to sink to his knees and mouth at. Dean schools his gaze to Cas’s face.
“Let me make it up to you, then.” Cas said, completely throwing Dean for a loop. “It’s the least I can do, for the way she treated you.”
Bela, on the other hand, complained the entire ride from the airport back to the palace, from everything like the upholstery of the car, to the color the fire hydrants were painted. The one that really grated on Castiel’s nerves, however, was how she would snootily remark on the architecture of Celestine, and make snide comments on the people they saw walking the streets.
Castiel nods, and reluctantly steps from Dean’s embrace. The hunter smiles at him, and Castiel tries to smile back.
“I like it better than ‘buddy.’” He says.
That's all Dean needs to hear. He grabs Cas by his t-shirt and hauls him into the room. Cas squeaks in surprise, and the cart with the iris nearly tips over as he pulls it behind him. Dean takes the cart from him and places the iris in the corner of the room, where it remains at a safe distance for Cas to move about the room. The last thing he wants are stubbed toes and smacked foreheads while they do this.
He let Castiel lead him into the room adjacent his bedchamber, into the steaming baths. Castiel took his time undressing him, pressing kisses to as much bare skin as he dared, before he eased Dean’s sore and bruised body into the warm water, anointing him with soap and scented oils and rubbing it into his skin before he washed his hair, Dean moaning appreciatively at the feeling of his fingers against his scalp.
Dean smiled and a faint blush crept across his cheekbones. Immediately, Castiel wanted to see it again and again.
(Also kudos to anyone who gets the “kale is an abomination” joke.)
Dean was, Castiel could tell, a sweet soul. He blushed whenever Castiel praised his food or the way he decorated his apartment, which was endlessly adorable, in Castiel’s book.
Do you know how much eye sex I had to sit through between the two of you? Too much, guys, way too much.” He suddenly looks shamefaced. “And I...may have accidentally seen the two of you making out in the bathroom.”
He wanted to scream,
“Well…” Cas muses. “Irises
“What is this?” She said, calmly, a strange edge to her voice.
His orgasm, already boiling deep in his belly, doesn't take long to swell towards completion. Dean is near the point of goddamn
Castiel nodded. “Good. And, if you see Master Crowley, you are to inform him that I have a royal command that this man be treated with dignity and respect until the time of his demise draws near, and if my orders are disobeyed, I will see to it that he receives the worst treatments Perdition has to offer for himself.”
“Because,” Dean said. “I don’t think heaven can be any better than this, right here.”
“Just like Dean,” Sam said, shaking his head. “Self-sacrificing until the end.”
“I don’t make promises I can’t keep.” Brandie laughs. “But I hope to see you both around on market days.”
“This is delightful.” He said. “What is this?”
“Everything okay there, sunshine?” He asks.
“Hey, by the way, has anybody ever told you you look a lot like the prince?”
“I did a little digging,” Sam explains. “Turns out Marjorie was a master gardener, and entered a flower contest right before she died.”
“Well,” Dean says as he kills the ignition, looking behind him at the hailstorm. “That was lucky.”
There's a scar, about an inch long, just beneath Cas's jugular, where he'd cut his Grace from his body during the ritual that cured Dean of the Mark. The skin is silky smooth, with a silver sheen whenever the sunlight catches it just right. Dean rubs his thumb against it, trying not to think about the sacrifice it symbolizes, how it embodies the humanity that Cas welcomed with open arms, all for Dean’s sake. Cas swallows, Adam’s Apple bobbing, and after a second he bares his neck, and the sheer amount of trust in such a simple gesture leaves Dean
After a moment, Castiel looks away
“Thanks for the gift.” She says. She delivers a swift kick to Cas’s stomach, and he doubles over with a grunt of pain. “Now you just sit tight while I take care of that nasty Winchester problem, hm?”
“I trust you.” Cas says gently, once again carding his hand through Dean’s hair. “As I have, and as I always will.”
“Good.” He was somewhat surprised, but also relieved to hear that. He had told Sam he wanted him to keep living his life, but he knew how stubborn Sam could be. He would call Sam as soon as he got off the phone with his dad, and he hoped his brother was actually at school.
Gabriel smirked. He was really looking forward to watching these two fumble their way forward, with a few nudging course corrections from him, of course.
“Just a moment, Dean,” Cas called back to Dean from the kitchen.
“Cas!” Dean stopped reaching for his weapon and was standing, staring at Cas, blinking, trying to adjust to this new reality in a half second, then in the next he was across the room, grabbing hold of Cas, feeling him solid and real in his arms. His breath hitched, and he tried to fight it back, but this time he couldn’t. Cas’s arms came around him and held him tight, grounding him.
Dean gets acquainted with Gabriel and learns what his place will be.
The magistrate gave the young man one last vaguely sympathetic glance, nodded, and walked away. It was a shame to see a strong young man turned into a bitch by an angel, but Castiel Novak had the right. It was done. The boy had been legally bitched.
“Do you have to ask that question?” Castiel said. “I came to see you, make sure you’re alright.”
“Naomi,” Gabriel said. “Just let him go.”
“It has half the carbs of potatoes.”
“Not yet,” Sam admits. “Still working on it. I was thinking about calling in a favor from Crowley, see if he could get Rowena in on it and see if she could find anything out about her. If she’s the witch we’re looking for, they’d know.”
“No harm is to befall this man in the time between now and his execution, is that clear?” He said sternly, voice bordering on cold. “He has been freed of his bonds and he is to be allowed to rest until he is to be taken to the block. You are
“I’ll grab a broom.” Dean declares, dumping the pieces of glass in the trash can. He points at Cas. “Don’t move until I get back.”
The woman shrugs. “It came with that sign stuck in the pot. Your guess is as good as mine.” She pulls a sale pad from inside a lockbox on the desk and starts filling it out. “Either way, it's a gorgeous iris. I'm kind of sorry to see it go.” She smiles at Castiel. “Are you giving it to someone? Your mother, maybe?”
Luke stopped the car, and another guard stepped forward to open the back door. Castiel steppes out, followed closely by Gabe.
“C’mon, make up your mind, dude. Clock’s a tickin’.” Dean says, not without good humor.
Dean is putting the bags on the counter when he hears a clatter and the distinct sound of a body hitting the floor. He turns to find Cas sprawled out on the floor, the bag containing the pies he’d been carrying next to him. One of them - the cherry one - had fallen out of the plastic container it had been packed in, sending its contents smearing across the floor in what would be an impressive arch, if it didn’t call to mind blood splatter so easily.
Castiel’s fists clenched, and he ground his teeth.
- for so long, I can't remember what not wanting you feels like.”
to dance?” He teased.
Castiel nodded to them both and entered the cell.
It isn't long before sleep takes him, too, and he doesn't dream.
“What, not even going to give me one dance?” Dean countered. “Just one, and I promise I’ll leave.”
No further words were needed. One of the guards fumbled with a set of keys attached to a thick leather cord at his belt, and slipped the key into the lock. They yanked the door open, the rusty hinges screaming in protest.
Dean hummed, and sleepily traced his fingertips across Castiel’s brow.
“It’s alright, Dean,” Cas assured him. “I’m not offended.”
Tessa grinned. “Oh yeah. I’m going to school to be a mortician, AND I spent thirteen years in jujitsu classes. I can handle her, if she tries anything.” She gestured to the salad on the floor. “She even steps foot back in here and she’ll end up like this poor, defenceless salad.”
Dean turned to look at him, and Castiel noticed how his breathing had gone ragged. His green eyes were wide, and Castiel knew him well enough to know he was terrified.
He wanted to say it aloud, for all to hear. He loved Dean Winchester, bandit of his own heart, as sappy and cliche as that sounded. He knew Dean would hate it, but he didn’t care.
Still, Dean couldn’t deny that he’d felt the familiar flutter of excitement when he’d realized it was Cas sitting in front of him at the table he’d blindly walked over to, too preoccupied with trying to find a blank page in the little order notebook from the counter and not spilling the glass pitcher of water to notice just who it was that he was even approaching in the first place until it was too late. He’d completely forgotten, for a moment, that Cas hadn’t come alone.
He takes the handle of the cart and follows Sam down the hall, through the library, and back towards the garage, where they walk through the side door into the scrubby field outside the bunker. The usually dusty earth is still wet and muddy, but just as Sam had said, it is no longer raining, the thunder no longer audible as lightning flashes in the darkened distance.
“He’s a lying, treasonous
Masquerades even more so.
“Thank you.” He said. “Good luck, Haley.”
He pulls into the first gas station he sees.
“Absolutely.”
Dean nods. “Good deal.” He pats Sam’s shoulder. “Good job, Sammy. I'm gonna go make coffee. Cas and I will head out after we've had breakfast.”
Cas’s blue eyes are bright as he smiles at Dean again.
about watching the spectacle, of Dean being held down as a sword was raised above him and—
Castiel had casually dated several people during his time in university, though he had never told his mother that. Despite the fact that it’s
“Thanks, Emmanuel.” She said.
“Thanks again for cleaning up that salad, Tessa.” Dean called as they walked out.
did.”
“Dean?”
Cas doesn't say anything, but he smiles, and Dean wishes he could make him smile like that all the time.
“Yeah, yeah.” Kevin waves him off. “I’ll be right back.”
. That's just his luck.
His apartment was nothing special; it had nice hardwood floors and an open floor plan, with arched doorways and a wide, open bay window facing out over the main strip of road. When Sam was in undergrad, he would often sit on the seat and study for his exams. Even Dean sometimes sat there to peoplewatch.
“Yes, Dean.” He said. “I will be with you. I will not let you die alone.”
Castiel laughed. He’d missed his brother.
Dean’s green eyes were wide, and he blinked, his mouth slightly parted. He licked his lips before he gave Castiel a small smile.
Naomi released her son, and looked at one of the guards in black suits with earpieces standing behind the vehicle. “If you wouldn’t mind grabbing Prince Castiel’s bags?”
“Killing you will be an honor.” She whispers silkily, pressing harder with the blade. “Maybe now I’ll finally be good enough.”
“You doing okay? Your flight alright?”
Swallowing against the pain in his chest, Castiel dropped a kiss to Dean’s temple and gently, oh so gently, extracted himself from the bandit.
Dean feels a pang of regret for raising his voice. He pats Cas’s shoulder as he passes him to grab a cup from the shelf and fill it with water from the tap. He hands it to Cas, who mutters his thanks and chugs it down in three gulps.
Dean deserved to be saved.
“Don’t hesitate to call Jody if you need to.” Dean said, untying the back of his apron and slipping it over his head, using it to towel off his still coffee-damp hair.
“I saw this man sneak into the ballroom a half hour ago and make a beeline for his highness, and thought it best to investigate.” Bela explained. “I would know the hands of the man that stole from me anywhere.”
The need to find Dean, to make sure he was alright, to touch him and see him, if only one last time, was overwhelming. Castiel knew that there was absolutely no chance for a jailbreak; Perdition was the most heavily guarded prison in all of Heaven, impregnable, sinister, and deadly. The keeper, Fergus Crowley, was known for the way he ran the place like a well oiled torture wheel; Crowley often boasted that it wasn’t called Hell for nothing. Castiel shuddered to think of the stories he’d heard of Crowley’s cruelty towards the prisoners; to him, dealing with criminals such as Dean was an art.
As he walks towards the closet where the broom is tucked away, Dean ponders what just transpired. Something about this whole thing is ringing wrong in Dean’s head, like a gnat in his ear, and it's driving him nuts. Cas was fine earlier! It was like as soon as they'd walked into the bunker, it was like he'd seen nothing but bad luck—
Castiel isn't sure what, exactly, drew him to the iris in the first place; he and Sam had dragged Dean out of bed to drive up to Hastings to the farmers market with them, with promises of pancakes at a local diner should he do so. Dean, unable to resist food, had begrudgingly trudged out of bed at 7 AM - or “ass-o-clock” as he called it - to blearily down three cups of coffee before they all loaded into the Impala.
“I believe I owe you an apology,” Castiel said instead. “It seems you can dance, after all.”
“You promised,” Castiel reminded him, but it was not nearly as heartfelt as it had been before he’d agreed to a dance. Castiel wanted another,he wanted Dean to stay, even though he knew he couldn’t; there was no bottom to the chasm of want that coursed through him whenever he was near Dean.
“Well, at least your commute is short.” Dean laughed. “I roll out of bed, throw on some pants, and head downstairs. It only sucks when I’m hungover.”
title?!”
Bela’s jaw dropped, and she huffed out a laugh.
“Are you going to refuse a direct order from your prince?” Castiel growled, voice low and menacing, full of righteous fury, much like the angel he was named after.
Gabriel gave him a half smile. “Well, I feel the same way about you, little brother. So maybe we should just believe in each other, and call it good. Yeah?”
“You see, Dean,” Natalia says as she stalks towards him like a lion hunting prey in tall grasses. “I’m not like all those other little penny witches you’ve killed in the past.” She grins. “I’m smart. I play my cards right. I live under the radar. I’ve been here in Hastings for the last ten years, and I never tipped any hunters off, did I? No, because
Sam and Dean can only watch as they sign back and forth to one another, grinning like loons all the while.
“I forgot to read it,” he admitted.
Castiel hissed. “Oh.”
Cas chuckles and kisses him one last time before he pushes himself into a sitting position. He stands and walks over to where his clothes lay haphazard on the floor, and he stoops to pick them up. Dean gets a good look at his bare ass, and takes a moment to appreciate it as Cas uses his already come stained boxers to clean off the excess of Dean’s spunk from his chest.
Dean sat at the table in the bunker kitchen, huddled over his coffee. It was a lifesaving manna from heaven today. He was tired, tired to the bone. After Jack had…become God? And had brought back all the people of the world again, he disappeared. Dean…well, he was happy, of course he was, that Chuck was gone, Jack was in charge, and Jack was a good kid. They could trust in him. Cas had.
Gabriel frowned and cocked his head at Castiel’s declaration and request. It was unusual, but – she must have found something- something really interesting. He couldn’t imagine what about Dean’s situation would require all of them to be present, but he guessed he was about to find out. He called his brothers then flopped back on the couch, claiming pride of place to wait for the expected entertainment to unfold.
Castiel blinked and nodded. He set his hand on Dean’s other shoulder, then used the other to brace the human’s back, ignoring the stiffening of his body. He looked at the Registrar. “Ready.”
This difficult, terrible part was over, but sorting out this mess had not even begun. The fact that he had never had any clue that this was how his brother thought, that this was what his brother was capable of – he knew it would be a long time before he could begin to reconcile that. In the meantime, however, he needed to see that his word was upheld. He needed to take the evidence of Raphael’s actions to the court and get Dean’s conviction reversed. He needed to ensure Dean’s magical bonds to him and to Gabriel were severed. He needed to look at the details of what Raphael had done and attempt to make whatever amends might be possible to those left behind. And he needed to see if he could make amends with Dean. If Dean…if he was amenable to being courted by an angel…by him. He felt tired even thinking of everything he had to do – with the exception of Dean. Thinking of Dean, he felt many things, but tired was not one of them. Thinking of Dean, he felt regret for hurting him and an aching, terrible void in his chest for his misjudgment, something he knew he could not change. Nothing would change what he had done. He could only try to make it up to him, try to show him that he could be better, that he was worth a chance. And if Dean did give him a chance, he had to make sure he never had reason to regret it.
During their talk, Dean had come up on his side to face Gabriel, propped up on one elbow so he could face him.  His hand reached out and gently pushed him so he was face down on the mattress again. Dean’s jaw clenched and he stiffened, but he didn’t resist.
Castiel and Gabriel sat facing each other over the kitchen table, mugs of tea in their hands. As one, they stopped talking and turned to look at him even though he knew he hadn’t made a sound.
“I met their brothers, and maybe we’re not gonna be besties, but at least their youngest is a cool kid, you’d like him, Sam. And they have this woman, Charlie, working for them – she’s smart as hell, she’s like a tech genius – she kinda saved my life, and she’s helping to find out what happened with the trial and all that.”
Dean closed his eyes for a moment. Maybe they were telling the truth about not hurting him; maybe they weren’t. It didn’t really matter, since there was no way he could give up a child of any kind to these three, not if he could help it, and right now he could. He again mustered his best give ‘em hell smirk, and said, “There’s no kid here, buddy, but even if there was, I wouldn’t give you crap.”
“They…asked me to think about staying. After I’m free.”
Bobby frowned, “What the hell? Nobody’s talkin’ to me about it.”
Sam had called and left a voicemail for him after Dean’s arrest, but he’d been so caught up in the job, it had been a couple of days before he listened to the message, then another couple of weeks before he could finish the job and get back home. The trial had been quick – it was all over and done by the time he made it back.
“Dean,” Castiel said and waited until Dean looked up to meet his eyes. “After you are proved innocent, after you are free, I am going to ask you to stay here, with us.” He saw Dean’s eyes widen, but he didn’t know what that meant, either. He looked at Gabriel.
So, it had crossed his mind that the Novaks, as former associates of the victim, might want him as their Restricted Laborer. He hadn’t thought it likely, given Browne wasn’t an angel, but it was possible. Seeing the Novaks in his cell – well, he knew he was screwed. The ass-kicking that followed wasn’t a surprise by that point, either, since Dean was never one to expect sunshine and roses, but then – that last bit, that was a surprise. Laborers weren’t supposed to be abused – that wasn’t the point of any of it. Dean was adrift. What was happening?
Gabriel had told Dean all this, answering his questions easily as he showed Dean where food and supplies were kept and told him what their daily schedules were. Dean had seen Castiel only in passing, quick glimpses in the morning before Dean made breakfast for Gabriel and him, and in the evening after Dean made dinner. He wasn’t quite sure what to make of it all. Gabriel seemed to be sunny and open and direct about everything, including his unabashed enjoyment of fucking Dean deep and hard every night, filling his ass with his hot come, before leaving for his own bed with a grin and a “you’re such a good bitch for me, Dean, thank you,” thrown over his shoulder.
As Sam got older, he had rebelled against their father’s strict orders, training, hunting, and moving from place to place. He wanted a home and friends, a school that he could go to for more than a year. The fights got longer and louder, the older he got, until he finally broke away from hunting and got into Stanford last year. Dean hated the fighting and tried to mediate, but sometimes he just had to stand back and let them go at it. He saw both sides, but his first loyalty was to Sam. When he saw the direction things were going, he helped his brother as best he could, supporting him when he applied for admission and scholarships. He didn’t want to see him go, but Dean knew they couldn’t go on the way they were. Sam and John were just too alike, too hard-headed. John’s mission was not, and never would be, Sam’s. Sam wanted to live his own life, and Dean did everything he could to help him, even though it tore at him, that his brother was leaving him.
“Fuck it,” he said, abruptly fed up with his own crap. He finished descending the stairs and made his way to the kitchen doorway, uncomfortably aware he was standing in the same place he had been tortured in not that long ago.
“But you believe him? I mean, he’s not lying or anything?”
The magic washed over Dean, warm and fuzzy. Yeah, that didn’t make a whole lot of sense, but that’s what he felt. The Registrar was a tall, blond female angel with piercing gray eyes. She was solid and muscular, built like Dean imagined a bodybuilder or maybe blacksmith would be. Her fingertips were rough but her touch gentle as she laid her hand on his forehead. A minute later, the warmth slowly faded, and he opened eyes he hadn’t realized he’d closed.
Gabriel reached out and laid his hands on Dean’s chest and belly, feeling for his energies. He blinked and looked up at Castiel. “I’m going to need your help, Castiel. He’s…” he looked at Dean then back at his brother. “Keep him here while I mend his body.”
Sam had grown up and away from Dean, and Dean knew it was normal; more than that, it was a good thing, that Sam had become a strong, independent young man. But he did miss it sometimes – that look of love and faith in Sam’s eyes. This wasn’t the same, of course, but it reminded him of the good times, and Dean allowed himself this taste of a good thing in the chaos his life had become.
Castiel jerked his head toward the door, and the man blinked and followed the silent order, stepping just outside the cell, where he stopped to turn and watch along with Gabriel.
Castiel ran his hand across Dean’s buttocks, gently caressing him. Gabriel settled on the bed near them, his hand reaching out to stroke Dean’s warm skin, reassuring him.
“Ramiel, Joshua is in the bathroom. Please take him back to our office, if you will. Michael and Luke, these three have information we should have. Please take care of it,” Castiel directed confidently, and the three nodded, and moved to make it happen. He turned back to Dean and glanced at Gabriel, the best healer among them.
Dean glanced at Cas again. He was so grateful Jack had rescued him from the Empty almost as soon as he landed there - new god powers, after all. Cas had helped Jack get started with…everything, then he’d asked Jack to make him human again.
“Where’s the boy?” Moe demanded.
Dean blinked a few times, looking back and forth between the two angels, finally settling on Castiel again. His mind scrambled, trying to fit this into the narrative. Finally, he just asked, “Why now? Just because I wouldn’t let Joshua get kidnapped?”
“Listen, Dad, the Novaks want to help prove that I’m innocent. They want to help get my conviction vacated. They’ve got an electronics expert they think may be able to help. Her name’s Charlie Bradbury. She’s gonna be calling you soon for more information about that email. Answer her questions, okay?”
And then there was Castiel. Dean hadn’t seen much of him since they brought him back from the binding, other than at meals and in passing. He got the impression Castiel was avoiding him, and he didn’t know what to think about that either. He knew someone on the outside looking in would expect him to hate Castiel for beating him and for…what happened after. Dean…well, he couldn’t say he liked getting beat, no that, that had sucked big-time. But considering that Castiel thought he’d killed a friend of his just because of his species…well, he could put that on pause and wait to see if the guy was ever gonna talk to him about it. The other part – Dean could barely touch, even in the privacy of his own mind. Unfortunately, it was kinda like an injury – it hurt to touch, but it was nearly irresistible at the same time. He had to keep poking at it.
“Say it, Dean,” Castiel demanded. “Tell me you’re my bitch. Tell me you’re glad to be my bitch.”
As the phone rang once, twice, three times, Dean closed his eyes and tried to figure out if it would be better if Sam didn’t answer or if he did. Talking to his dad was easy – short, fact-based, and direct was how that had to go. His dad didn’t do anything else. No difficult questions like how was he doing or how had they treated him. Dad didn’t do anything but hard. Sam, on the other hand. Well, Sam was gonna have a lot of questions, Dean knew, and he hadn’t the slightest idea what he was gonna tell him, other than the bare-bones report Dad had received. Sam wasn’t going to be satisfied with that, oh no, that much Dean was sure of.
“Castiel.”
“Joshua is doing well, if a little shook up. He wanted to come back here and see you, but we’ve convinced him to wait for a bit. We wanted to talk to you, first.” Gabriel said.
“No, we’re not doing that. You guys gotta tell me - what do you want, first? Then I’m gonna ask a metric fuck ton of questions, and you get to answer them all.”
The Registrar’s hands dropped away, and then, a moment later, the angels’ hands left him as well. There was an indistinct murmur from the crowd as they saw the glowing outline of hands where Castiel and Gabriel had touched Dean. The Registrar gently turned him to face the people watching. Dean flushed, self-consciousness and embarrassment filling him. He wanted to keep his eyes down or closed, but he refused to be a coward. His gaze swept the people in front of the stage then the ones in the back. He heart skipped a beat as he saw his father and younger brother, standing on the left in the back. John’s face was blank, but Sam’s was pale and strained. Dean met his brother’s eyes and gave him the slightest nod and wink, trying to tell him he was okay; he was going to be just fine. He wasn’t sure that was the truth, but he didn’t want Sam to worry – well, worry too much, anyway.
“Sorry to hear about your boy, Winchester,” one grizzled older black man said. There was a general murmur of agreement from the others.
Nearly a week passed. Castiel started going out for longer and longer periods as they all waited for something to happen. Dean’s initial restlessness had slowly subsided. When Castiel did work at home, Dean generally stayed close, mostly reading a novel that he found on one of his wanderings around the house. They exchanged a few words here and there, but nothing serious, nothing that came anywhere near the topic Dean was sure they both had front and center in their minds.
and watches as Cas’s bare ass bends over to pull on his sweatpants from the night before.
It was a pain that never left you.
“I don’t think so.” Dean steps closer, gun still leveled at Natalia’s forehead. “You ain’t gonna get that far.”
Cas nods. “Yes, you’re right.” He says. He looks at Dean with a hopeful face. “Does...does this mean that we’re…?”
“Who goes there?!” Castiel demanded. The gardens were off limits to the ball attendees, reserved solely for the royal family so as to not invite midnight trysts in Naomi’s prized rose bushes.
Cas’s nose wrinkles adorably, and he groans. Ever since his fall, Cas has had a predilection towards being a morning person, often rousing early to practice meditative yoga, or to go running with Sam. However, most days he's been known to take a page from Dean’s book, and is a grumpy little shit until he's at least one cup of coffee in.
“Everything will fall into place.” Chuck continued. “If you keep trying to force everything on him at once, it will be nothing but chaos. Let him go at his own pace. He might surprise you.” Chuck smiled warmly at Castiel over his wife’s shoulder.
Dean feels his heart
“Son of a
Dean is stunned.
He wouldn't trade it for anything in this world or the next.
He smiles.
“Cas, wait.” He manages to gasp out as Cas presses his hips down into the mattress with his hands to keep Dean from thrusting up. “Gonna...gonna come if you keep doing that.”
“What, persay, does staying imply?” He asks, smiling as he cards his fingers through Dean’s hair.
“Now, how about you be a good boy and clean this mess up?”
He could feel Dean trembling against him, fingers pressing into Castiel’s back.
It wasn’t until the mortician had begun preparing for the body to be embalmed some days later that it was discovered she’d been pregnant.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Are you okay?!” Sam steps closer and sets the ace bandage on the counter.
Should have known you’d show up eventually.”
Dean huffed. “With an attitude like hers, I’m not surprised she didn’t let you get a word in edgewise, man. Don’t sweat it.”
He wants to spend the rest of his life with Cas.
“‘67,” Dean corrected. “You know your classics. I like that in a guy.” He winked, hoping he wasn’t coming on too strong.
“There you are,” Dean says. “Sammy ran into that organic food store for more of his rabbit food. I told him I'd come find you. You almost ready to go?”
Castiel knew they’d be keeping Dean in a cell without bars; they’d be keeping him in the lower cells of the dungeon, rather than the prison proper. Castiel found the nearest staircase, and headed down. The stairs were slippery from a thin layer of algae growing on the perpetually wet stones from water that trickled down the mossy walls, the smell of damp earth and stagnant air growing stronger the farther he descended.
“You love it.”
Another guard, hooded to protect his identity, came forward and brandished the sharp execution sword Castiel had seen them experimenting with earlier.
“Give me your number.” He said. “And I’ll text you the next time I’m free.”
Over a fucking
“You gotta tell me,” he says hoarsely. “If you wanna stop, or anything hurts, ‘kay?”
“Yeah.” Dean agreed. “Yeah, Cas, I’d like that a lot.”
Still, no one comes to the door.
Castiel laughed. “I get that all the time.”
Cas is nowhere to be seen.
“And me.” Said Jo. “I’ll go, too.”
“What am I going to do without you?” Castiel asked, finally breaking the silence. He felt his heart beating soundly, breaking a little more with each press against his ribcage.
that dates back hundreds of years, Gabriel!” Castiel snapped. “I would never disgrace our family like that!”
“Breathe, sweetheart,” Dean whispers. “I got you.”
“It...feels good to hear it.” Cas’s tone is shy, and he smiles down at Dean.
Cas moves as instructed. When Dean tosses him the ball, he misses catching it completely, and has to run after it as it rolls away from him. When he throws it back to Dean, he throws it too hard, and then it's
“Karma’s a bitch, bitch.” Dean grates out, wincing at how hoarse his voice is.
much.
He resolved that soon, he would go back to the Roadhouse. He just had to get through Bela’s visit first.
“Can’t.” Dean yawned. “Wanna remember this.”
“So, Castiel,” Naomi said, snapping Castiel back to attention. “I’ve arranged for Hannah to meet with you today to begin going over the preparations for the coming weeks. I just received word this morning that Lord Talbot will be arriving with his daughter Bela Wednesday afternoon at 1 o’clock. You and I will meet them at the airport, and you will get the chance to get to know Lady Bela a bit better.”
“I'm sorry, Sam.” Castiel apologizes.
Gabriel shrugged. “Last time she was here I literally saw her pull the tail of one of the grounds cats. For no reason.
Cas isn’t a fucking pet. He’s a goddamn
Castiel frowned. “That can’t be right, you drove much farther than just a few miles.”
vacuuming her out.” Dean gripes. He glances in the small folding cart Sam had taken from the trunk of the Impala. He points to a grayish lump sitting snugly on top. “Dude, what even
The percolator stops, and Dean pours coffee into the three mugs. He puts a napkin over Sam’s, and scoops up his and Cas’s mugs, heading back towards his room.
The title from Shinedown song "Follow You Down."
Dean gave Tessa a salute before he turned his attention back to Cas. “Follow me this way.”
Gabriel winced. “Shit,” he swore. “She’s seen you, what, nine hours and she’s already trying to hook you up?”
“Sure it has.”
“Be safe.” He said instead. “Please, my friend. Don’t make me lose you both.”
This is
Castiel nudged his brother in the ribs with his elbow. “Shut up.”
CASTIEL: Not yet. But there’s still time.
126 Lakeview Drive is a lovely ranch style home on the north side of town. It's painted a calming sage green with terracotta trim, and a long driveway fringed with neatly trimmed shrubberies and rose bushes. There's a huge magnolia tree in the front yard, in full bloom, and Castiel can smell it from down the street as they approach in the Impala.
Castiel had more tears after all, as it seemed.
“Cas,” Sam reached out and clasped his shoulder. “It’s not your fault. We’ve always known that, eventually, we’d be taken out.” He ran a hand through his hair, pushing it away from his forehead. “Oh, G-d, what am I going to tell the others?”
Dean scratches at one of the flakey pieces on his own stomach. He reaches into his bedside table for the wet wipes he keeps there (next to a bottle of Überlube and a dildo he's had for years) and shows Cas.
Cas gives a single grunt in reply, and Dean shakes his head. He leans down and moves the sheet away from Cas’s hips with a finger before he tongues at the hickey on Cas’s sharp hipbone, sucking at it gently.
Castiel huffs, but allows Dean to help haul him to his feet. Mud covers his jeans and t-shirt, and he wrinkles his nose at the sucking sensation it causes when he moves. Sam comes over to the two of them, wheeling the iris behind him, and Castiel feels a flare of relief at its close proximity.
“Well then!” She said. “I would say that this ball has turned into a cause for celebration! The thief Dean Winchester has been brought to justice!”
Cas pulls him in for a bruising kiss, hands smoothing over his biceps.
“I...I need to wash my hair, but I fear that if I remove the ace bandage, the pain will be overwhelming.” Cas admits. Dean tries not to roll his eyes, and practices an understanding smile onto his face; ever since he’d given up his Grace for good, and had become fully human, Cas was still struggling to develop the pain tolerance that Dean and Sam had cultivated their entire lives. Dean vividly remembers the papercut Cas had nursed a few weeks into his humanity; he’d griped about it the entire time, unable to understand how something so small and ultimately inconsequential could
shows.
“Awesome.” Dean smiled back in return.
“Shit,” he said when he saw Gabriel’s name flashing across the caller ID. “It’s my brother. I should probably take this.”
Castiel gasped as Dean was yanked away from him, breaking the kiss. He watched, dumbstruck, as Dean was thrown to his knees by two guards, his arms twisted behind him. A pair of shackles were snapped in place onto his wrists, and the guards pressed down on his shoulders with grips tight enough to bruise to keep him in a kneeling position. A hand was twisted into his hair, and a blade was held to his throat to keep him from moving.
“Yeah, that’s him. And his
Dean smiles and reaches over to swipe at Cas’s hair, windswept from the open window.
Cas. You know
“Unfortunately.”
Everything from that point on seemed to slow down, as if time were wading through water. Castiel, unsheathing the sword at his hip, jumped up onto the dais and rushed forward, towards the executioner. He was aware of nothing around him; even the sounds of gasps from the crowd were lost to him as he set his sights on Dean, and the sword above him.
“I’m fine.” Cas says. “But...Sam, I think something is wrong. This...is highly unusual behavior for me, despite my brief existence as a human.”
Bela did not look pleased as she rolled her eyes. “Plants on walls invite pests and vermin.”
Dean isn't blind; he'd seen the way a few of the burly trucker types had looked their way when Dean had called Cas
or the hybrid tea rose, which is what most people think of when they think of roses, as they are the most popular in floral arrangements due to their fragrance and long stems.”
Sam huffed out a breath, the corner of his mouth twitching up, and he reached out an arm to pull Castiel into a hug by the shoulders.
Sam levels him with what Dean calls his “bitch face”.
Dean couldn’t help but watch him as he walked away. A flash of heat crossed his senses as he noticed how good the prince’s ass looked in those dress pants.
“Last time I was involved with a luck curse, I lost a shoe, and nearly
“Bela, that’s enough.” Cas said, voice hard and steely.
“Sorry about that.” Dean apologized, and plastered on the very charming grin that Castiel hadn’t been able to get out of his mind the last few days. “What can I get you, ma’am?”
“Mother, you can spin this any way you want. I understand it’s tradition, and you know I’d never do anything to disgrace our family, but you have to understand how stressful this is for me. Surely you recognize how anachronistic all of this is.”
“I can imagine.” Castiel agreed with his brother. “I’ll be home as soon as possible.”
Kevin wrinkled his nose. “Why?”
“Dude, forget
Sam clicks at his phone for a second before he shows them the photo of a woman. Natalia Jennings is petite and curvy, with long, wavy chestnut brown hair and way too much makeup. Her smile is somewhat predatory, just this side of too sharp. She looks like she could be one of those tressed up bitches from one of those
He vowed to make it up to him when this was all over.
When Dean wakes up the next morning, it's to the warm body of a former angel in all his naked glory half laying on top of him, his face pressed into Dean’s neck and one leg and arm thrown over him, hugging him close like an oversized koala bear. Sometime in the night, the sheets had gotten kicked down, pooling around their hips, though one cheek of Cas’s ass still shines for all the world to see. He's crowded Dean against the edge of the bed, and he's snoring, which Dean finds adorable but will never admit to.
He tosses the shirt onto the floor, and gestures to the chair.

in a suit if she could get away with it.” Gabe said, and Castiel laughed.
Brandie smiles at their joined hands. “You guys are cute together.” She says.
“I am not.” Castiel said firmly. “The fact that I was attracted to him does not mean I’m smitten. I barely know the man.”
“I'm just sayin’,” Dean continues. “That your right hand will only get you so far, buddy.”
If Natalia Jennings had lived here, she’s long gone.
“Then what the hell do you think you’re doing here?”
BALTHAZAR: Say the word, darling, and I’ll hop a flight with a shovel to help you bury the body.
“Why?” She asked.
Dean did not look her in the eye, keeping his own lowered. “Yes.”
Alright. So Cas wants to smite kale.

to do so.”
Dean laughed. “Don’t blame you, man. Thanks for all your help.”
Dean smiled. “I guess I hadn’t thought of it that way.”
“This the place?” She asked.
“Cas, what’re you doing?” Dean calls to him. Cas turns his head and sees that Dean is standing at the door, his hand on the handle; he must have successfully picked the lock. “Come back over here; I got it open.”
“Thank you again for saving my ass,” Brandie says.
think I could find someone to fall in love with in that time? Someone who would be willing to give up everything and marry me less than a year into our relationship?” He shook his head. “I hate that I have to force this. I remember when you first starting dating Kali.
“Thank you, Sam.” Cas says. He sighs and looks at the mess of pie on the floor again. “I really am sorry, Dean. I don’t know what happened. One second I’m fine, the next I’ve lost my footing and I’m on the floor.”
“Soup’s on!” Dean proudly proclaims as he sets the large bowl of spaghetti on the table. Cas follows close behind with the smaller bowl of garlic toast, and Sam hands each of them a knife and fork.
“I bought it at the greenhouse.” Castiel explains. “Dean thought it would be a good addition to the garden I'm planning.”
“Hello, Castiel.” Naomi said. “May I come in?”
“You just don’t get it, do you?” Natalia says, hands going to her hips. She paces in front of the desk slowly, her eyes never leaving the terrified woman behind the desk. “I was the
“You've been hexed. It all makes sense.” Dean presses on. He looks at Sam. “Remember the rabbit’s foot?”
“Hello, Gabriel.” He said.
Dean realizes he'd been staring, and shakes himself out of it. He holds out the change of clothes, awkwardly.
“Just need to unwind is all.” He answered.
“How soon before?” Dean asks.
, rather than just a friendly get together that happened to involve coffee.
Later, after Dean had return the favor and the two of them had emerged, pink skinned and warm, from the baths, Castiel had led Dean back to his chambers, and the two of them had slid, naked and still slightly damp, under the warm sheets, facing one another with their legs tangled together.
“Fuck ‘em.” Dean whispers.
Dean felt himself fall just a tiny bit harder for the handsome prince in that moment. Not only had he come to Dean’s defense like an knight in shining armor, but he was also saving Dean’s ass by making sure his friend’s livelihood was protected from the consequences of his words and actions, no matter how staunchly he would defend them.
Footsteps came closer, and Dean tensed, pain flaring in response. A man stood in the doorway, not too tall, not too broad, with longish, sandy hair and sharp features. He looked down at Dean, meeting his eyes.
“Dean, Castiel is an extremely dominant angel. You might have wondered at the fact that he is the youngest of our adult siblings, yet he is the one who led us out of the angel community. He is the one who worked with another supernatural first – Silas. He is the one who established this business and brought us into it. He is the one who leads, Dean.”
His hand went to rest on Dean’s bloody forehead, and he finally allowed his grace to unfurl and reach toward the human. Dean’s eyes had been closed tightly against the pain as they held and moved him. Now they opened and met Castiel’s.
“I know,” Cas replied, smile widening to a grin. He pushed forward and hugged Dean again with strong, human arms.
“Dean!” his dad growled out in surprise. “Dean, are you okay? Where are you?” His voice was rough, urgent.
This time there was complete silence for a bit, then Castiel asked, “Please explain again, Charlie. Step by step.” His face hadn’t changed expression, with the exception of a slight tightening around his eyes. He didn’t doubt Charlie, but he had to have all the information before he went to accuse his brother of murder - the murder of a friend.
Castiel and Gabriel flew to their house while Michael, Luke, and Ramiel raced to get there mundanely, in one of their SUVs. Flying was a huge drain of their energy, and it was a risk if they needed to use too much magic when they got there, but they couldn’t risk all of them arriving too late. Arriving at the house, they were violently rebuffed by an invisible shield. Gabriel took a breath and expanded his awareness. There was a flicker of energy nearby. There. He looked at Castiel then nodded across the street where they could just see the silhouette of a man in the passenger seat of an SUV.
His eyes met Dean’s yet again, sharp and focused this time. Dean saw him swallow and inhale deeply. “Your soul is…the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, Dean. It is…wonderful and…unmarred.” Dean could see that Castiel was picking his words very carefully.
“Yeah, Cas, you did it right.”
“Yeah, of course – they’re gonna let us call each other?”
“I am a dominant angel, Dean. I know Gabriel has explained something of what that means for angels. What it means for me, is that I need to dominate my partner, and I need my partner to need to submit. It doesn’t work if it’s not mutual. Certainly it can feel good,” here he gave Dean a quirk of his lips at their mutual remembrance, “but the ultimate satisfaction for me comes when my partner and I work together to please each other.”
Castiel had watched as he went about his morning routine. He had been planning this since mid-way through the trial, but he still felt…off balance with the human in their house, disturbing the energy of their home. He had felt so triumphant yesterday, when he was finally able to demonstrate his dominance over the unruly young human thug – to begin to make him pay for killing Silas – his first friend outside of the angel community. They had met nearly fifteen years ago, when Castiel had first emerged from the angel community as an adult. Silas had taken a liking to the quiet, reserved angel and had gradually become his mentor, both socially and professionally.
“Gabriel! Charlie called. She’s on her way over, and she asked for all of us to be here. Call the others, please.”
“He’s still at school, right?”
Embarrassed and ashamed and…naked…as he was right now, Dean also felt the tiniest, strangest curl of warmth in his belly at the thought of all of it – being forced to submit to these two angels, getting on his hands and knees and spreading his legs for them, taking their cocks inside him, feeling them fuck him deep and hard and spill their seed inside him, being their bitch. He could barely allow himself to recognize any of this…alien feeling…as his, much less begin to think about what it meant about him. Well, whatever this was, he had no time for it now. He firmly pushed any weird feelings and wayward thoughts out of his mind and concentrated on getting through the next minute, and then the next, and then the next. One thing at a time.
“Yeah, I’m good. Just thinking about everything - getting to see everyone again, you know? Brings it back.”
Gabriel took Joshua’s hand and turned to go find Castiel and the others. He looked over his shoulder at Dean and said, “Finish your chores, Dean. Please have dinner ready for all of us in three hours.”
The memory of Castiel’s strength and power, his…dominance (thank you for that, Gabriel, he thought acerbically) …as he maneuvered Dean where he wanted him and then pushed into him and took him, fucked into him, grunted and came inside him…even in memory, it did something to Dean. Something weird that warmed his belly and gave him a hollow, shivery feeling in his gut. Castiel wasn’t an especially big or powerful man at first sight, but it was there. And his voice – deep and gravelly, yeah, it did things to Dean as well.
Dean had known from childhood that he was attracted to boys as well as girls, and he had also known that he was different from everyone else in that respect. Growing up on the road with his father and his little brother, he learned early to keep his mouth shut, keep quiet and listen, and to do what he was told. He knew of no one in the human hunter life who admitted to being anything other than a “normal” heterosexual. Maybe it wouldn’t have been a big deal to admit, but the fact was that Dean just never wanted to take that chance. His life was tough enough, he didn’t need to deal with that, too.
“Tell me, Brother, what’s holding you back?” Gabriel asked, a small smile remaining on his face after seeing his brother’s reaction.
Castiel was shaking his head before the Dean’s final words. “No, Dean.” He cocked his head slightly and his eyes unfocused a bit, as if looking at something behind Dean.
“Dean, what do you know about angels and sex?”
“I love you, Cas,” Dean said. It was surprisingly easy to say. Dean hadn't said that often in his life, and it had always been a struggle, always. He hated making himself vulnerable to anyone. But Cas - Cas was different. He always had been.
“Yeah, well, we’re…uh....” Dean tried to figure out how to describe this part of it. “He asked me to stay, so….”
Gabriel nodded at the three angels in turn. Michael was a tall, dark haired man, almost startlingly handsome, with warm brown eyes. Luke was about average height, with sandy hair, and a sardonic grin on his face. Dean resolved to be careful of that one. Ramiel was the shortest and slight of build, with dark hair and eyes also.
Castiel turned his attention back to Dean, laying unresisting under him, his breathing harsh and raspy, shuddering with pain. He shifted his knees wider to give him stability, and started to fuck into him, thrusting deep and hard, pulling out nearly all the way, then powering home, making sure Dean would remember this forever – the first time he had taken a man’s cock up his ass. It certainly wouldn’t be the last. His cock belonged here, buried deep inside his newly taken bitch. The tight vise of Dean’s ass felt like heaven squeezing his cock as he drove in again and again. He took his time, enjoying everything about this. Dean belonged to him now. Castiel would make sure he felt that, all the way to the core, each and every day for the next five years. Finally, he pushed home one last time and came hard, yelling out his release, his triumph, his dominance, spilling his semen deep inside the boy, marking him forever as the bitch he was now and would always be. After a few seconds to make sure he had emptied everything he had into Dean, he slowly pulled out, satisfied for now. He would fuck him again once they got home. He straightened his clothes and reached down to grab Dean’s arm.
Castiel emerged from his office finally and went into the kitchen. “Dean, would you like a beer?” he called out. “Gabriel?”
“Hello, Dean.”
Castiel shook his head as he started the car toward home. He was glad this part was done. Dean was theirs officially and publicly, to do with what they chose. While he wasn’t quite sure what that was yet, he was ready to move on to the next step.
“Suck my cock, bitch. That’s it, that’s amazing, you’re a natural….” Cas sighed and came, filling Dean’s mouth, spilling down his throat inside and out. After so long resisting his beautiful boy, he couldn’t last long this first time.
Castiel didn’t reply, his steady look answering for him. Castiel Novak didn’t appear tall, but it was only because his muscular build disguised it. It was only as he approached the magistrate that his true height became apparent. His body was solid, and he radiated a commanding, unyielding presence. His clothes were expensive and obviously well-made. He wore dark slacks and a button-down white shirt with a slim black belt and black dress shoes. His hair was short and dark, his face broad and handsome, his lips full, and his eyes cool and strikingly blue – and now they turned to pierce the older human functionary.
Dean barked out a surprised laugh. They were on the same page there. After being on their own for so long, he had no doubt all the energy was going to be a lot. Getting to their cabin and kicking back would be a nice retreat, for a few hours each night, anyway.
Gabriel gasped for a bit, catching his breath, then chuckled. Finally! He kissed Dean gently on the shoulder and pulled out slowly. “Thank you, Dean. That was amazing. You took my cock so well, as always, I’m so proud of you.” He hugged Dean from behind, holding him through the reflexive flinch until he slowly relaxed and trusted Gabriel with his weight. “Beautiful,” Gabriel repeated, looking up at Castiel.
“It’s alright Dean, just relax. I’m not gonna hurt you. Just relax for me, that’s it. That’s beautiful, Dean, you take my cock so beautifully. It feels so good, having you wrapped hot and tight around my cock.” Gabriel was finally all the way in, penetrating Dean fully, the way he had wanted to since he saw Castiel fucking him earlier at the jail.
“I mean it, Luke. Touch him and you’ll regret it.” Gabriel’s tone was unyielding.
Cas’s eyes were warm and faintly crinkled. “Jack, of course. Jack is…changing the universe…fixing the universe.”
many words.
Castiel inhaled sharply as his cock abruptly filled at the thought. He imagined Dean on his knees in front of him, where he belonged, his beautiful lips wrapped around Castiel’s big hard cock, sucking gently. His hands tightened into fists, and he slowly breathed out. Gabriel was such an ass.
It was hands-down the best day of his life.
“Why were you killing human hunters, Brother?”
Cas left the house, the last pie in one hand, and he turned and locked the door, then set the pie in the backseat with the other two and closed the door. He looked at Dean over the top of Baby and said, “I’m ready now, Dean.”
“Castiel,” Gabriel called out.
Gabriel’s fingers left him and he felt something big and hot and hard slowly push into his ass, stretching him wide, but the fingers, along with the earlier fucking, had stretched him enough that this time it didn’t really hurt. Knowing that Gabriel was pushing his cock into him, sent a weird curl of heat through his belly, but he couldn’t really identify it. Didn’t want to identify it. Soon enough he felt the angel’s body press fully into him, which meant that cock was all the way inside. He sighed, and his body slowly relaxed. It was weird, and it was uncomfortable in a way, but it didn’t really hurt.
He used his fingers to gently fuck Dean, feeling for the right spot. A sudden stiffening accompanied by a surprised grunt showed him when he found it. He smiled. Gabriel wanted Dean to enjoy this as much as he possibly could, because he intended to spend as much time as he could with his cock firmly lodged inside Dean’s ass.
Cas gave him a small, gentle smile. “I helped Jack get his bearings, then I asked him to make me human. Jack heard your prayers, Dean. I heard your prayers.”
Dean turned to see a young dark-haired boy, maybe around ten or eleven – or at least he would be, if he were human. The boy grinned at Gabriel and launched himself into Gabriel’s open arms, hugging him, his face alight with pleasure and joy. Dean couldn’t help but smile at the sight.
Dean didn’t know how long they stood like that, but eventually Castiel slowly stepped away, keeping hold of his hand as he pulled him toward the table and then held the chair for Dean to sit. He moved to fix another cup of tea, setting it down in front of Dean before he took his own chair again.
Dean groaned as Gabriel pushed one last time into him and came, filling him in hot, wet spurts. Gabriel rested for a few moments, draped over Dean’s body, enjoying the feeling of his balls emptying into the young human under him. One hand reached for Dean’s cock, finding it hard and leaking, as he expected. He smiled into Dean’s shoulder and stroked him gently for a few minutes before pulling his hand away. He felt Dean’s aborted move toward his retreating hand and smiled a little bit more, before his smile faded and he sighed.
The bathroom here on the ground floor wasn’t spacious by any means, and Dean felt his heart fall as he took in the space, but Joshua slid between the toilet and shower, pushed at the narrow wood panel there, and it popped open, revealing a small empty area. Joshua turned to look at Dean for approval. He didn’t know what was going on, and he was scared, but he trusted Dean.
He saw the smirk was still there, maybe even a little bigger. Hot anger welled up behind his eyes, but Castiel fought it back down. He had no time for that right now. His anger would be appeased soon enough. His right hand whipped out to slap the young man’s cheek, staggering him and leaving a white imprint that slowly flushed red in reaction. The boy pulled himself back upright, then flicked out a punch that thudded into Castiel’s midsection, then another that crashed into his cheek, then two more quick blows to his body.
Dean was a fully grown human man, tall and well-muscled, and he projected a confident cockiness, even as he was being beaten by Castiel. But Gabriel had seen beneath the physical mask – the boy’s cool green energy had flowed and given way before Castiel’s dominant, icy blue energy even before the first punch had been thrown. By the time Castiel had mounted him, Dean’s energy had surrounded and gently smoothed the icy spikes of Castiel’s energy. Dean was born to be a submissive – it was obvious to an energy-worker like Gabriel. And it was equally obvious he was no murderer. Castiel would realize sooner or later where Gabriel’s certainty of that came from, and maybe then he would use his talent to See Dean as he was.
Gabriel turned back to Dean. “Well, now you’ve met the Novak Brothers.”
Uncle Bobby stood next to his father, grizzled and solid, his face unreadable as well, but Dean could see the stiffness of outrage in the way he held his body. Dean saw a few others he knew in passing, but the vast majority of the crowd were strangers, humans and magicals alike. Most watched with detached interest. Some of the humans wouldn’t meet his gaze, embarrassed for him. Some of the magicals watched with enjoyment; some few watched him with hot, evaluating gazes.
Shifting into a squat next to the young man, he quickly and efficiently stripped off his jacket, shirt, and t-shirt, tossing them to the side. Pulling out his knife from the scabbard at his waist, he sliced the laces on the young man’s boots, tugged them off, and tossed them as well, along with his socks. Finally, he stripped off the young man’s jeans and underwear, leaving him naked and bloody on the concrete floor. He turned the young man onto his belly and then reached down with both hands and unbuckled his own belt. He unbuttoned and unzipped his pants and shoved his underwear down, freeing his hugely erect cock, giving it a slow stroke as he did so. Demonstrating his strength and superiority over the young human had stoked his need to totally prove his dominance in this most basic of ways.
Castiel Novak nodded in response to his older brother, his cool blue eyes clear and determined. On one hand he wasn’t looking forward to what was about to happen, yet on the other hand, he had been waiting for this for days…weeks even. Revenge – no, that was not what this was. Revenge was petty and beneath him. This was justice, and it had to be done.
The magistrate pursed his lips. It wasn’t usual, but it was legal. He looked at the thoroughly beaten and defeated young man lying under Novak, his asshole stretched wide around the thick cock that speared into him, and he nodded. “Witnessed. His paperwork will be amended to reflect his new status. I’ll send a copy over to you within 24 hours. Please make sure to have him marked appropriately as soon as possible. Is there anything else we can do for you, Mr. Novak?”
Dean smiled. It seems they had successfully navigated his coming out as bisexual and blew right past to the details. Sam was all about the details. Love for his brother and his analytical mind washed through him. “Hey, Sam.”
“Make sure you do it right, Castiel,” Gabriel stated, his face solemn as it rarely was.
“A convict can be assigned to a victim or a victim’s heirs as Unrestricted Labor if the crime was either sexual or had serious physical consequences.” He met Dean’s eyes once again. “Such as yours.”
“Tell him what you
Their arms eventually got tired, and quiet, reasonable, sneaky Curly came up with the idea to start using a belt. Moe grabbed a knife and cut the shirt off Dean, pulling the scraps from his hanging body. The bruises and then cuts bloomed across Dean’s body as the belt continued to fall with a crack, over and over. Dean was still conscious, barely, and he saw them start to get more and more anxious. They knew this was taking too much time.
“Go, go, go!” Dean motioned, moving aggressively toward the boy and following him as he got with the program and ran for the bathroom.
So what the hell, he wasn’t a coward, Dean thought. He was attracted to the angel. He wanted to feel that strength, that power focused on him again. He had a feeling next time would be different. Next time would be…clarifying. He hoped.

Dean was getting overwhelmed with all of it - the sensation of Castiel in his mouth and under him, firm and hot, the sensation of Gabriel slamming into him, laying over him, and the curl and buzz in his head and his belly and his cock as Castiel called him a bitch with approval and delight. One small part of him was telling him that was bad and wrong - he shouldn’t let Cas talk to him that way, he shouldn’t feel pleasure at it, he shouldn’t…there were so many things he shouldn’t feel or do. But the biggest part of him was just feeling it all, and it felt so good he wasn’t able to process it all. He coughed a little when Cas came, spilling his hot come down his chin, and Cas met his eyes, as he lifted them, and a couple blunt masculine fingers gently swiped up the come and guided it back into Dean’s mouth. Dean opened up for it and closed his mouth around the fingers, gently sucking instinctively.
Dean had prayed to Jack to save Cas, and he had prayed to Cas, to…well, to tell him all the things he had never been able to in life. It was easy, that way, to tell him everything, to say he loved him, always had, always would. To thank him for everything he’d done for Dean, for Sam, for the world. To let him know he was valued, angel powers or no. It became a bit of a habit for Dean, praying every night, letting them know what he was doing, and talking to Cas. Then one day, one beautiful, amazing, glorious day - Cas had turned up at his door, still in his old tan trench coat and said, “Hello, Dean.”
Dean was undeniably, unmistakably human, but when his soul had touched Castiel’s grace, they had recognized each other, reached for each other, intertwined and tasted each other as only those who are meant to be Soulbound do.
“Joshua!”
Castiel flicked his eyes to the magistrate standing next to the young man. “Take off his cuffs, please.”
Dean heard Sam’s sincerity, and something tight in his chest eased. It had been hard watching Sam go away, head out on his own, but he knew the kid had to go after his own dreams, and he was proud of him, he was. But it had been hard watching him go and not look back. This, knowing Sam still wanted him around, hadn’t been trying to ditch
He should have known. Dean was meant to be his, after all.
With that, Cas lifted his hand and brought the flat of it down on Dean’s waiting ass, gently at first, then a bit harder, then a little bit harder still. He watched Dean’s reaction closely, seeing him squirm and then relax into it. He felt Dean relax at the same time he felt his hard cock against his thigh. His own cock wasted no time hardening again. Spanking Dean was irresistible. When he judged they’d both had enough, he helped a gasping Dean lay face down on the bed and gently lifted his hips, propping a pillow under them. Nudging his legs wide, Cas spread Dean’s buttocks and pushed inside with one slow, deliberate thrust.
The hard choice would require him to try to explain why to his dad. He wouldn’t get it, Dean knew that. Sam – he wasn’t sure what Sam would think. He was a pretty smart kid, and he knew Dean in a way that his dad didn’t, couldn’t. He might understand. Even worse, the hard choice would make him admit to himself what he wanted, what…fulfilled him…in a way nothing else ever had. But it would give him Cas. The hard choice would give him Cas, and an interesting, fun life with the angel he loved.
“Do it, Gabriel,” one dark, gravelly voice ordered, “you know you have to establish the relationship now, before we register him.”
Well, he knew that wasn’t exactly right, but that was how it felt sometimes. Sam had been gone for around seven months or so when he came back for spring break – and this crap happened. The time hunting alone with his dad – well, it hadn’t gone great, to be honest. John just didn’t have a lot of…well, anything, really, to give to Dean except for orders. And it wasn’t enough. Before, Dean had Sam to take care of and hang out with, joke with, tease. After, he had a lot of silence and a few random hookups when he couldn’t take it anymore.
Gabriel nodded at Castiel, and he wrapped his arms around Dean as gently as he could to support his weight while his brother took care of the binding. They lifted him and carried him over to the couch and laid him down.
“Cas, what…how…? Dean asked, unable to put together a real sentence.
The beating kept going, pulling deep groans out of the young man now. “Castiel, stop. He’s done.” Gabriel’s voice was louder.
Angels were few but they were powerful - physically, magically, financially, and politically. No one knew where they came from, but since they arrived over two hundred years ago, they had rearranged society and human laws to suit themselves. Dean knew some history – he knew that in the old days, convicts like him were sentenced to be locked up, not to do labor. Angels saw that as illogical and wasteful, and so the labor laws came into being. And they had the magic to make the whole thing work. After sentencing, Laborers were magically bound to their supervisors in the case of SL’s or assignees in the case of RL’s, by the Registrar, a city post always filled by an angel. The magic ensured that Laborers would not escape and must obey basic commands.
