Their foreheads met and Dean couldn’t interpret Mr. Novak’s expression, so in the end he simply closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Mr. Novak’s smell, coated with just a tiny bit of sweat from the heat of the night, was intoxicating. He wanted to do nothing, but bury his nose into the crook of his neck, and never come out of there. He hummed at the thought, and the hold on him tightened. Dean moved his hand up from Mr. Novak’s shoulder, where he had placed it at first, to the nape of his neck and started to play with the soft hair there.
Is that the best you can do? Tell me how to come in here, and then tell me to not talk to you this way, just because, what?
He quickly rinsed and stepped out of the shower. He grabbed the towel off the rail and started to dry himself up. He put his underwear on, and hesitated only for a moment, before he grabbed his clothes in his hands and walked out. Thankfully, the only person that was in the room was still the nurse. She eyeballed him for a moment, before she turned her head and started arranging her tray by the bed.
Crowley didn’t really have any sort of news, just some updates over the attacks that happened. There were some casualties, even kids that had been in the middle of the crossfire. Castiel closed his eyes as Crowley went into details as to how many people were just injured and how many were dead. He rested his forehead on his open palm and tried to control his breathing. They had to head back as soon as they could. He had to go back and take care of this.
He lifted his glass once more to take a sip, but stopped short, when Dean’s eyes landed on him. Dean seemed to freeze, his eyes widening. Nothing seemed to exist for them both as they stared at one another. The noise seemed to disappear for Castiel, people seemed to disappear… Castiel’s eyes were for Dean to stare into. There was no one else in this house, but them. Only them for Castiel. Dean seemed to heave out an air, his shoulders relaxed down, and his chest seemed to deflate from it all. Dean stared at him a bit longer. His eyes moved to stare at her, for only a moment, then he swiftly moved away from Amara, who spared him a glance, and then went back to her conversation. She didn’t seem to have noticed that Castiel was there as well. She didn’t seem to care about where he was going. She has, probably, thought that he was going to go back to her like a well trained dogs did with their owners. She did own Dean. In every sense of the word.
After a moment of silence, Sam said, his voice had a gentler tone to it, which Dean really appreciated, but he’d never say it out loud. “It’s gonna be okay. If you feel like that his men are keeping an eye out on you two, then it’s great. Amazing, actually. And it… by the looks of it, he’s better of a man than I gave him credit for.”
“Wow, this is… this is actually pretty amazing,” Emilio said and Dean swallowed in relief. “I have some vintage cars in the garage that need some working on. Do you think you can take a look at them while you’re here?”
“Dean, please. I missed you. I’m not like-I’m not like myself. I’m not. I’m a bad person. Worse than I could ever be. I just shot a man on the-on the shoulder. It won’t be serious. You know how I am with my shots. I aim to kill, or not. I know where I shoot. I shot Alastair in the head. I shot him and he died. And I killed so many of them. I have blood on my hands, Dean. I killed all of them because they laid a hand on what was mine. It was you Dean. You. They touched you. They did. They did unspeakable things to you. So I killed them all. They broke us apart, and-and I let them. I didn’t know and I let them. I know better now. Please Dean. Please let me just…”
It didn’t take long for Castiel to reach his destination. It really was at the end of the hallway, just as the girl said in the kitchen. Castiel had dropped the knife back in the kitchen and had taken hold of his own gun. He had dropped all of his other weapons behind. His shotgun was too bloody for him to use anymore. So he only had the gun that was tucked away in his leg, and one of the side-arms. He was slow in his footsteps.
Castiel’s heart started to beat erratically in his chest, just when Dean leaned his head forward and grabbed Castiel’s lips into his in a small kiss. “I like the way your lips move when you talk. There is something fascinating about them,” he whispered as he moved his lips to his cheeks. “I like your cheeks when they get a bit stubbly, and it grates on my skin. I like your eyes,” Dean kissed Castiel’s closed eyelids. There was a tightness in Castiel’s throat that wasn’t there before. “I like how intense they look when you’re angry, or when you’re about to do filthy things to me. Or when you think I can’t see how soft you are, underneath all the Don mask you wear for your people to see.”
“Let me do it, sir,” Alfie was suddenly there, pushing away Castiel’s shaky hands and taking care of the buttons. Castiel took steadying breaths in and out of his nose as he regarded the steady hands and fingers on his chest. They moved fast and in a professional way which gave Castiel something to concentrate on. Alfie took the vest off of Castiel’s body and their chests bumped a bit, their faces getting closer than usual. Castiel’s breath left his body in one big whoosh as Alfie pulled back slightly and looked into Castiel’s eyes. The moment happened in a heartbeat, but they didn’t acknowledge it.
“Where exactly is it going to take place?” Castiel asked in a low voice, but it was strong enough that it quieted down the buzz.
It was different when he was told that Dean was doing drugs, to seeing it in a photo. Castiel wanted Dean to be safe. That’s what he wanted the most out of this whole thing. He wanted Dean to be alright again and he wanted to get him out of that witch’s clutches. Even if it meant that he wasn’t going to have Dean in his life, he still needed to get Dean out that hole.
Castiel sighed and he took another steadying breath. He pushed back from the counter and made his way to the door, but then he heard a whimper behind him. Right. That’s right. One of the girls wasn’t dead. He turned back from the door. He grabbed a knife from the counter; it was a butcher’s knife. He shrugged and went to the girl that he punched on the throat. She was staring up at the ceiling, wide eyed, and she was so young. Way too young to be working for these people.
Castiel’s torturous heart galloped in his chest. Dean stared at him a moment longer, before averting his gaze. He continued his work on the map and that was the end of it. Whatever that was.
“I’m going in alone,” Castiel got out of the car. He heard Crowley scrambling up behind him to follow.
Samandriel was propped up on pillows, and he looked paler than usual. The florescent lights of the hospital didn't help the matters at all. He was stacked up with tubes which were coming out of his arms and a nose-oxygen was attached to him. He looked half asleep, but he turned his head and looked at Castiel.
“Yeah. Sorry, I just kind of zoned out,” Dean said. Choosing his words carefully, Dean added, “I’m just worried about you, sir.”
“Let’s get you into bed, yeah?” Dean suggested some time later. Maybe it was just a minute later, or an hour later, Castiel didn’t know. Castiel nodded and tried to get up, but his legs wouldn’t support him. He tried again but he just toppled over some wet stuff on the floor.
Once they’d go back home, Castiel would let Dean know how much he appreciated this small distraction.
Mr. Novak looked down at Dean’s bare chest, his eyes glazed over as he thought about it. After a moment of silence, he said, “I want to experience the real one.”
His hands were nothing but that. How could anyone want to be touched by these hands and feel good about it?
His neck burned with embarrassment and his mouth didn't seem to work. He wanted to apologize, and explain that it just happened out of nowhere, but at the same time... he didn't really feel like he should be apologizing because what he did wasn't really wrong, right? He was here to keep Mr. Novak a company and to comfort him, so really, it was okay. Right?
“This life is always dangerous,” he replied, finally looking up at Dean. He was once again struck by how piercing blue this man’s eyes were. Dean could drown in them, if he wanted to.
“Liar,” Castiel pointed his other gun to the boy’s leg and shot. The boy howled in pain and doubled over.
“Do you want to learn about their house with me?” asked Mr. Novak after some time of no words being shared between them.
“Nothing yet from the day. Sorry, boss,” Balthazar said. He sighed and placed his phone back in his pocket.
“So, ah, it seems that we have a mutual friend? Or, friends?” the man said, grabbing the wine from the cooler.
“I want you to not come,” Castiel said. “I’m going to be gone for the most of the day…” He waited for a moment before he said, slowly. “You will be alone.”
?” He mocked the words as if they were the most disgusting thing he ever had to say. “He was pretty. The pretty little slut wanted to have a life, wanted to have a family. I told him to remember what he was, because he would never be able to get out of it fully.”
“Yup, uncle Dean. You’re going to have a nephew,” her voice was thick with emotion. Dean kept on hugging her, until eventually she said, “Air. Need. Air. Yup.”
“I'll wait for you,” Dean said, and his heart might've skipped a beat with the way Mr. Novak's eyes crinkled at the corners as smiled.
“Good boy,” Castiel whispered leaning forward, his face inches away from Dean’s. Dean let out a small, desperate sound that Castiel etched in his brain. He loved how responsive Dean was to anything that Castiel would do to him.
Dean didn’t have a lot of people coming over to his place. And the only ones he did allow to come over were usually people he dated or knew from somewhere. But one-night stands, or new people he didn’t know; never. So this was a first. And he didn’t know how he felt about it.
“Oh,” Castiel turned to look at Dean. He was still pretty much naked, but he had put on boxers sometime during the night. “I guess you’re okay to come to bed.”
Even after all this time, Lora had never forgiven him for the things that had happened between he and Dean. She has never told him in the face about how she felt when Dean had left, but her silence did speak more than words. Castiel felt guilty over her sadness as well. They had become friends, after all. Castiel was going to try and talk to her one of these days. He just didn’t know how to start the conversation.
“Hi,” Dean whispered, his hands uncurling from Castiel's shirt, and smoothing out the slight wrinkles in the fabric.
He has left the house about 40 minutes ago. Balthazar had asked him where he was going, and then demanded Alfie to go with him, but Castiel refused to budge. So then he went and gotten his car from the garage and left the building in a record time. The streets weren’t icy, but the snow kept on coming. It seemed that it didn’t stop coming since it had started to snow yesterday. And by now the sidewalks and such were filled with snow.
His phone rang and he literally threw himself at his nightstand to get to it on time. The screen ID said
He finished his food off and went to his drawers where he kept his clothes. He rummaged through them and took out a pair of jeans, and another soft-knitted sweater. This was a gift to him from Eileen last year. It was soft. He got ready and went to the bathroom to brush his teeth and do his hair. He had a short-beard thing going on, and thought for a moment to shave it off, but thought against it. He wanted to get a full beard soon. He shaped his hair, and while he was doing that his phone dinged again.
“We can try and-Charlie,” Castiel said, his mind starting to work again, as he grabbed a shirt to put on.
“I know,” he nodded. “I know that. But I can’t be with him right now. He won’t be there, mentally, to be with me.”
“So, Dean, how have you been?” Jessica asked as they sat down comfortably on the couch. She leaned her back to the armchair, stacked up with pillows and her feet were crossed close to her body.
“Some of them can,” Mr. Novak replied with a defensive tone to his voice. Dean snorted, and he heard a huff of air in his ear. And then Mr. Novak said, “I only know the things that you will, personally, share with me.”
“Mr. Novak, as you can see, I'm not making enough to be able to give you back... Business isn't thriving as it used to.”
Dean shook his head and just then he spotted Mr. Novak walking to them. He was talking to Emilio. And knowing him, he was probably talking about his work. Dean rolled his eyes at the man; he could never stop working. And Dean had to learn to accept that, one way or another.
“Let me get a cloth and clean you up, before sleep. You don’t want to wake up all sticky,” Castiel said as he got off the bed.
Suddenly, there was a warm hand on his knee and Dean looked to his right. Mr. Novak was looking at him with worry and concern in his eyes, but his face stayed neutral. Dean was so lost in his own thoughts and didn’t even notice that the food on the table had been replaced by dessert and his wine glass had been refilled. He wrestled the dryness in his throat and breathed out through his nose. He hadn’t realized how stressed he was, until he felt the calming presence of his dom’s hand on his knee. He placed his hand over Mr. Novak’s hand and squeezed it tight. Something loosened in his chest when Mr. Novak squeezed his hand right back.
As the thought passes through his head, Dean looked at Mr. Novak’s thoughtful face; he was reading something from the book and he seemed to be deep in his thoughts. He seemed to be unaware of the turmoil that was going on inside Dean’s head.
Castiel heard screaming and people running out of the diner. Azazel stood up with a roar and went for Castiel; he wasn’t fast enough and Azazel managed to knock him down to the ground.
Not wanting to look like a slob, Dean ironed his white button down shirt. His dark blue jeans were a little rough on the edges but it looked clean to wear. He grabbed his best looking boots and his favorite belt. Once he was done wearing his clothes, he rolled up the sleeves of his shirt while staring at himself in the mirror. He looked nice. His hair was a bit windswept, which was the best he could come up with. Not like it could get any better than that, but he still looked nice. Okay he looked real good. He took a steadying breath as he checked the time and it was already 9:30. He was supposed to meet with Gabriel at his club by 10.
you have someone. Because you hooked me up with one of the best clients I had for a week, and I made tons of money by just being a helpful hand to him. And also, you’re Gabriel freaking Milton.”
“Why are you the one that is treating me?” asked Castiel, trying not to snap at her. “Are you the most idiotic one out of them all?” Castiel flipped his hand at the general side of the hospital.
Once inside, Castiel realized that this table wasn’t just set up for people who have bunch of money laying around and came here to spend it in gambling. It was sort of an All Star type of table. Castiel sat at an empty chair and nodded once, while looking at some of the people. He recognized the champion of WSOP 2016 Tommy Gun and some actress from SNL. He wasn’t close with any of them, or knew them personally, but he has played some rounds with them from time to time and they were great competitors.
The silence that followed was something he was going to bear on his shoulder. The weight of it was already crushing enough.
“So, Dean, tell me more about yourself. What do you do for living?” Mr. Novak asked as he delicately cut through his meat. Dean, absentmindedly noticed how long and delicate his fingers were.
“It's a mix of everything, really. A strip club, casino, with an open bar. Also, it can be used as a disco club too. He used to throw parties, almost 2 times a week, once he got his father's job.”
Castiel was staring at the old door with mild impatience. Impatience, that was directed at himself. It seemed like his body was going against him as he tried to lift up his hand and knock on the door. But his arm didn’t move, and by default, his hand didn’t either.
“I don’t think I was made to create food,” Castiel said looking at the contents in the bowl. “This looks awful. Do you want to just have some cereal?”
“Can I sit with you?” Castiel asked. He waited for the consent from Dean to sit, but there was nothing but shock on his face. Castiel hesitated, unsure of what to do. So he sat at the bench that was the closest to Dean.
Dean opened the truck and placed Natalie’s suitcase there. Then he went to the backseat’s door and got Natalie in. “Dad, can I watch some cat videos please?” she said as Dean started to strap her in. Once secured, Dean sighed and pulled back.
Cars were easy. They didn’t talk. They didn’t move. They didn’t do anything other than be able to transport people from point A to B. Easy. They didn’t whine, didn’t complain. They just sat there and waited to be put to work.
“I see how you look at yourself in the mirror,” Dean said, just as Castiel closed his eyes. So it was that one. “I saw how you were looking at yourself just now.”
“Whatever hides underneath your shirt,” Dean continued, his fingertips leaving electrifying shocks after their wake. “I will still want to be with you,” Dean passed by something there that made Castiel twitch. But he didn’t stop, didn’t ask. He continued. “I will still want to be your sub. To be your boy. To please you however way you want me to… I’m not going to leave you, Castiel.”
Castiel got comfortable back on the bed and when he rested his head on the pillow, he looked up at her, but she wasn’t asleep. She kept staring at him with her green eyes that were so like her father’s that Castiel was having a hard time looking away from them.
“Shut up,” Dean mumbled and then looked down at Castiel’s hands, which were clutching at the towel. “May I?” he indicated to his hands. Castiel took turns by letting Dean take his hands to inspect. He would hold the towel with one hand, and then the other. Dean looked at his fingernails closely.  They weren’t the cleanest, but they looked acceptable.
“Yeah, we can,” Dean said with a smile on his face, as Lisa walked back out and handed over a small suitcase with the Avengers on them.
“For allowing me to come here,” Dean said, letting his lips brush up against Castiel’s. “For coming with me here.”
The three of them stood in a tense silence, but Castiel snapped back to action after he took labored and calculated breaths to calm down. “I need you to track down where this image was sent from, Charlie.” He held out Dean’s phone to Charlie.
“Yes, I have. Where is Balthazar?” Castiel asked, looking around, even though there wasn’t anyone here.
“What do you mean?” she asked. “You love him like nobody’s business, and he wouldn’t be here if that were not true.”
This time he went in without a hitch and Dean moaned again. He wrapped his arms around Mr. Novak’s neck and pulled him close for a kiss. Mr. Novak was grunting into his mouth as he started to move his hips, slowly dragging out, and then pushing in just as slowly. Dean moved his lips down to Mr. Novak’s chin, where he bit at it, and kissed it, and mouthed along to his ear. Mr. Novak was grunting and moaning, and he dropped his head down to Dean’s neck. Dean turned his head to the side and gave more access to Mr. Novak.
They all stopped, stared at one another and then, one of them went for Castiel. He didn’t hesitate to throw his gun at the man’s head and kick him on his solar plexus. The other two went for him but Castiel was faster. He ducked down and struck out his leg. One of them toppled over with a painful grunt, the other one got a hold of his shirt. Castiel struggled to break free at first, holding onto the forearms of the men, but he wouldn’t budge at all. Castiel, feeling reluctant, grabbed one of his sidearm and pointed it at the man’s head. He shot and watched as the man’s eyes rolled back into his head, his mouth hanging open. He released Castiel and went down with a heavy thud.
“Yeah, I do. That’s why, my men are out there now, going after Sam. And then they’re going to take him to the hospital, to get him checked.”
A man came in with a personal problem; his wife was cheating on him with the gardener and he wanted that gardener gone. Castiel stared at him so long that he had to run out of the office. “We don't get rid of people just because they're sleeping with your wife. Call a lawyer and get a divorce.”
That shut Castiel up faster than he was ready to admit to anyone. He worked his jaw for a moment, but then he relaxed and breathed out through his nose.
. If I find out he’s one of the many that is a traitor to me I will destroy everyone to the ground. Am I clear?” He ended the call, and opened his text app.
Nobody said anything as they processed this new information about the arrangements; Lora sipped at her tea and looked up at Balthazar from the corner of her eyes. He was pursing his lips, he looked like he was contemplating whether to say anything about this, or not. But he thought better off it, and just frowned.
Now, it was night time, and Castiel made his way through the club; grinding hot bodies surrounding him, but his men made a small barricade around him so he could walk through the people without any of them touching him. Castiel walked up to the bar and the bartender immediately walked to him.
Now, Dean drove down the familiar lane towards the mansion. He stopped his car by the curb and gave his keys to Jared who smiled at him in a greeting and got inside the car, looking excited. Dean smirked, knowing exactly how Jared felt while he was inside the Impala. He walked around the car, opened his trunk and got his bag out. Once he got it, Jared drove his car towards the garage.
“I’m not here to dine and wine, Azazel,” Castiel said. “I’m here for information regarding my employee.”
When they arrived, Castiel nervously fiddled with his phone in his hands. He didn’t know what was waiting for him inside the building. He hated not knowing. His men were out of their cars already and they were waiting for him outside of his car. Alfie was his designated driver for the night, and he was still in the car, waiting for his move. Castiel noticed him shooting glances at him from the rearview mirror, but otherwise, he kept silent. He was waiting for his orders.
“You’ve the audacity to lie to me?” Castiel snorted angrily and shook his head. “Gabby, Gabby, Gabby…” Castiel had a moment of regret, and it wasn’t about his brother. He was surprised that he realized that he didn’t care about his brother’s life. What he cared about was that his white shirt was getting bloody by the second. He hadn’t realized it; but his hits had brought blood, and it was splattered all over Castiel’s shirt.
What he did want to know was the recent activities Dean had had with Amara. And who was his dealer. And what he had found left him shocked and exhausted.
Lora nodded and said, “Yes. Mr. Novak has a big family.” She didn't went into details there. “The basement is mainly used for entertainment, though.”
“I’ll have the lamb, please,” Castiel said, without leaving his eyes off the person sitting in front of him. Who still hasn’t said a word to him.
“Why the fuck not?” Dean snapped at him, taking couple of steps closer to the desk, which was the only thing separating them. And Castiel needed that imaginary wall gone from between them. But he didn’t move. He remained in his chair.
His phone vibrated again with another message. Castiel stared at the picture a bit longer then he went to check the message. It was from Lucifer. He swallowed, licked his lips and clicked on the message icon to read it.
About 30 pages later, he got a text message on his phone, which he ignored. Few pages later, he got another one. This time he, reluctantly, closed the book and grabbed his phone from his pocket to read the messages. It was Balthazar.
The question hang open there, but Dean knew what he meant. If he needed Mr. Novak by his side right now, he’d be here before Dean would be able to end the call. But… talking to him on the phone was starting to relax him in a good way. “No… no, thank you, sir. You talking to me on the phone is helping me relax, actually.”
He didn't even pause by the living room, where he could hear voices, talking to one another. He walked right out of the house and down to his garage. There was no one around, so he walked to his car, got in and rode out as fast as he could. With one hand, he texted;
“I’d like to know what I’m dealing with,” Castiel said, turning his head to look at Dean’s profile. “I’d like to know what you look like these days. And if necessary, have you checked out by my doctor.”
He hadn't even called to see if she was doing okay. Was he allowed to, though? He didn't know how much privilege he had now, but he still would like to be able to call her whenever he wanted. Natalie was basically a godsend to him. Dean didn't know what he was going to do if he didn't have that small miracle in his life. The choices he made for her, right now, weren't appropriate, and he sure as hell was going to make sure that she'd never find out about it, but... He knew that if he didn't have her in his life, he wasn't sure where he'd be right now. Dean had a feeling that Lisa would've still wanted a divorce, either way. No one in their right mind would want to still be connected with a former, professional sub.
Gabriel finally looked at him with a calculative look in his eyes. Dean stared right back and it seemed something had slipped on his face that Gabriel's eyes cleared in understanding. It seemed like they were on the same page now.
the kid. Nor did he know if it was a boy or a girl, or what the name was. He didn’t know what Sam was up to these days, either…
That was the reason why Dean was feeling this way, wasn’t it? That they didn’t find anyone in the house… maybe he got burnt to dust that’s why they couldn’t find him. The thought that maybe Castiel wasn’t in the house; that maybe he got the message on time and left the house unattended; that maybe he wasn’t in the house when the bitch decided to attack; was overwhelming.
She turned around and looked at him with cold eyes. “Who are you to tell me what to do?” she demanded from him with equally cold voice.
“But we both know that we won’t be able to really keep a hold of who will buy this stuff and who will actually use it,” Aaron said as he drank his beer.
Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean, and rested his cheek on Dean’s temple. Dean had his head right underneath Castiel’s jawline, and he was breathing in and out deeply. Castiel closed his eyes and tightened his hold on Dean’s body. He felt so warm and soothing that Castiel wanted nothing more than to just live in this moment. To have Dean for himself, all the time, and to never let him go. Close out the world outside of this bedroom, and just live with Dean in a quiet life, with no troubles and worries.
Mr. Novak seemed to notice his hesitation and his eyes cleared. “Can I have the room, please?” he addressed his servants and the man. The maids left quickly from the back door from which they entered from originally, and the man looked at them both for a moment,
“No, Mr. Novak. No,” he said and he took a step back. Castiel traced the movement with his eyes. Dean’s hands were shaking again as he said, “I’m here to keep you company, right? To make you feel better. To make you feel… feel
When Castiel went back to his apartment, it was quiet. He walked into the kitchen to see Lora working in the kitchen, with her headphones in. He left her there without bothering her. He walked to the living room and draped his coat and jacket over the sofa. He sighed as he walked up to the windows, which usually overlooked down at the city, but it was covered up in a fog and slowly falling snow. They were going to be hit with another snowstorm it seemed.
“Yeah. It’s going to be okay. Not right away, but soon,” Mr. Novak replied with a slight nod. His eyes went out of focus, and Dean didn’t like seeing that. So he grabbed Mr. Novak’s other hand and pulled them closer.
It didn't bring him the calmness that he searched in his soul, but his heart felt lighter after trying to patch things up as much as he could. Even if a lot of the families wanted nothing more than to see him dead.
“I can’t believe he’s still around. You’d think that him being your, -practically, - right hand and lawyer, they’d take him out…”
“You don’t want them to be on you for…whatever you’re planning on doing,” he said, his mouth feeling heavy. He knew that he was going to black out soon, but he needed to be sure that she wouldn’t do anything.
“Hey, Mr. Novak,” he said, and there was little to no accent to his voice. The guy was born and raised in New Jersey, so of course he had no accent. Castiel rolled his eyes at himself.
When Alastair came, Dean’s insides were coated by his seed. His mouth hung open and a silent gasp left them. He stared down at Dean’s blank face and smirked down at him.
“I understand where you are coming from,” he said and he squeezed her arm before he let go. “I, uh, I saw him today.”
“You are absolutely right,” the first one replied back. “But his partner is an eye candy, don’t you think?”
It took Dean a moment to realize that his brother stopped talking and Castiel was at the end of his stare. Well, he was at the end of the redneck’s stare as well. Castiel tried not to swallow, but it was damn hard not to. He never felt nervous before, but now he was feeling a bit… uncomfortable.
“I’m wearing these glove like, hand sponges, so I can wash you up without touching you,” Dean said in a low voice, but the quietness of the bathroom made it sound like he was screaming.
“Can you blame her, Sammy? With the way I was, and am, I'm surprised she even allowed me to see my kid for at least three days.”
Jessica looked at him for a moment, before she placed her hand over his cheek and said, “You big softie. Let’s go. We have about an hour to eat that chips and have our drinks before Natalie wakes up and Sam comes home.”
“Yeah, I know,” Castiel whispered. Castiel dipped down and kissed Dean’s exposed neck. Sucking on a pulse point, he tried to work his finger in, but Dean was clenching a bit. “Hmmm…” Castiel growled against his neck. “Lube?”
He praised Dean’s participation to the act, it was remarkable just how well he was trained to be obedient to Castiel. How in tune he was with Castiel’s need for something. They had an amazing time on their way to here, and in the end, Castiel suggested they take their small…play time to the outside world.
“No, no, no. I’ll take this. And you, go to the library. A certain someone’s been acting as if his puppy died.”
“They’re going to attack, but not in the way that you know. I have no answers to your questions, but protect what’s yours before it’s too late. This phone will burn when this call ends in 5… 4… 3… 2… 1…”
“Uh…” Dean looked at him, confused. “Yes. We were in bed, sir. Together. Being… you know,” Dean sounded awkward. That didn’t sit well with Castiel.
“Today, at the park, when I couldn’t find Natalie,” he said. “It was because I wasn’t paying attention to where she went off to. Or where she was. I turned away from the playground for just a moment, and she was gone.”
“I didn’t know the man was boss’ man, dude,” the guy said, his voice thick. His mouth was bloody and he kept on choking on it.
Anna had ginger hair, wide green eyes and a smile that blinded Dean for half a second. She was wearing a black summer dress with heels that looked almost impossible to walk on. She had a soft tinkling laugh and her eyes sparkled whenever she’d speak about how excited she was about her wedding.
Dean turned his head to look at Castiel. He reminded himself to keep breathing because Castiel looked angelic. Even though he still looked tired, even though he didn’t look like the composed self that Dean was used to seeing, but he still looked so…beautiful.
“You’ve a back plan if it won’t, right?” Dean asked casually and was pinned on the spot with a glare that would ravel her brother’s.
“Hey,” Dean tried not to bark at the kid, but he couldn’t control his emotions. He was becoming jittery and it was never a good sign. The kid startled at the sudden appearance of an angry parent, his face freezing in terror as he stared up at Dean. “Where’s she?”
“No offense, Mr. Novak, but we don't know each other that well,” Dean said, his eyes cautious, but his cheeks were flaming.
Castiel stood back up as Dean sat up and started to get his phone out of his pocket. His breathing was uneven and his cheeks were warm with an aroused blush. As he looked down at the ID, Castiel saw him swallow before he looked up at Castiel. His pupils were blown wide and he seemed to be having some sort of internalized struggle with answering the phone.
“I know that. That’s why I’m not going to spend the night there. I’m just going to talk to him and come home.”
Dean bit down on his lower lip and pushed back. Castiel frowned at the gesture. “Actually, I have to leave for work. So I need my car.”
Sam had told him, excessively about what he was going to face when he’d agreed to go with Mr. Novak. Dean had flapped a hand around, dismissing Sam’s attempts to make him see why it was a bad idea in the first place. Dean was more concerned as to what the next course of action for them was going to be. Them, as in, Dean and Natalie’s monthly visits. He had to make a legal document
It was loud in here. Classic rock music was playing throughout the garage, and there was the occasional banging around and metal clacking against metal. It smelled like cars, obviously, and dirt. And sweat. But Castiel didn't concentrate about that, because 1. Not appealing, and 2. He would be able to describe exactly how Dean smelled like when he was covered in sweat. It sounded creepy, even to himself, but he had a great sense of smell. And it was something that he wouldn’t mind smelling for a long time.
Drink by his elbow, and jacket over his thigh, Dean continued to scan the bar for Castiel. There, all the way in the back, sitting between two other very colorful individuals was Castiel. He was talking to someone, and he was laughing. Dean grabbed his glass of whiskey and made his way to where Castiel was sitting at.
Castiel looked down, sighing through his nose. He wanted to take a step back but Dean grabbed onto his T-shirt to prevent him from doing so. Castiel looked up and into Dean’s eyes, before he looked down again. “Lucifer’s dead. I saw it happen. And I couldn’t do a damn thing about it. I needed to be here so I could clear my head before I’d go after the son of a bitch who did this.”
“Okay, okay,” Mr. Novak said, nodding his head. “That’s good. Now, take a deep breath. Relax your muscles. Your face muscles, too. Because they are here.”
Yes, they weren’t together, and he was with Amara now, but… knowing that Castiel was out there somewhere, being aware of him, made Dean feel secure in living his life. Being able to go out at ass crack of dawn and be safe. Knowing that he still had protection of the people, knowing that he was untouchable.
Dean’s heart clenched; he always thought that he was free from Alastair’s clutches. That he would never hear from him, even if he thought, that he was Azazel’s right hand and his name being mentioned anywhere in the world would just be that. But here he was, almost in the middle of a war with his number one enemy. Being caressed by the said enemy, being taken care of by him… Being a target. An easy one. Alastair never liked it when people even looked at his ‘toys’.
Castiel rolled his eyes, pecked him on the lips, and walked to the bathroom. He closed the door after him and started to change into different clothes that he had stored in here. He didn’t look at himself in the mirror, because he knew what he was going to see. Castiel was feeling great and he didn’t want to ruin his mood. Once dressed, he grabbed a towel, got it under the faucet to get it wet, and walked back out of there.
“With chocolate cookies and mint?” Natalie asked, twisting around Dean’s arms to look at Jessica with wide eyes and a smile already working its way to her lips.
Castiel threw himself back into work. Balthazar proved to be a good consigliere. He had been ruthless in his attacks and his planning. Castiel admired it a lot. It took them about one month and a half to clear up the mess that had been left behind the Italians. Some of the people who worked for the family had thanked him and pledged their loyalties to Castiel. Some of them wanted nothing to do with the world.
“Please don’t kill me,” she sobbed openly. She shivered, from cold and fear, and Castiel felt like he was going to get sick.
Castiel stood up, his chest heaving with breathlessness. He heard a crunch and fast approaching footsteps, and he internally groaned. He got his shotgun ready to aim and fire, when he heard a familiar voice yell, “It’s me! Don’t shoot!”
“Dean!” it was Lora’s excited voice. Dean looked at the front door as she came out of the house and walked down the stairs. She hugged him in a greeting and Dean returned the hug.
In the morning when they woke up, both of them went to the kitchen and Dean had decided to make something for them both. He had asked Castiel to help him out, and poor Anna had to stand back and observe the cluster fuck that was Castiel in the kitchen. They were going to make the
“Looks nice, doesn’t it?” Mr. Novak asked him as he sat on the bed. Dean looked around for his clothes, but he didn’t find any. He looked back at Mr. Novak, who in reply raised an eyebrow at him. Dean got the message; he was to remain naked and he had no problem with that. He sat beside him and grabbed one of the sticks. He bit down into it and moaned. They never failed him.
He opened his eyes and was greeted by the grey clouds and raging rain that only got worse by the hours of the day. In a way, the day was representing everything he was feeling today. That’s why he was on the matt, bare feet planted firmly at the edge of it. He lifted his arms once again, stretched his back and then went down again, pressed his hands on the matt, and moved his legs back on the matt and into downward facing dog. He held the position for a minute; moving his hips this and that way, stretching his back by pulling his hip and leg down. He felt all the right types of stretching that his muscles went through as he moved around slowly.
“Is this Dean Winchester?” an unfamiliar voice said to him with an accent, and Dean sat up a bit straighter.
“What do you want?” he asked instead, ignoring the jab at his choice of clothe wear. He was, indeed, in all black. And he did look like he was getting ready for someone’s funeral. Knowing how the evening was going to pan out already, he was sure that someone was going to die.
“Punishing you like this, won’t make a difference,” Amara said finally. Dean didn’t know what she was thinking, but the way she worded it, made Dean’s skin prickle. “Physically damaging you, won’t make any difference. I have to do something else, for you to get the message…”
“Just thought I’d come by and see how you’re doing,” Castiel said, slowly making his way to the drinks at the far side of the room, and pouring him some whiskey. He didn’t ask if Gabriel wanted any.
Castiel took a step back and gasped in a sharp breath. He never liked killing people, but there was no other way to go through than this way.
Waking up in cold sweat was something that Castiel had gotten used to in the last couple of years. He would have nightmares. He would have pleasant dreams. And he would have dreams that were memories. This one was a memory. It was about a week before Dean left him. They had this fight because Castiel had come home, stumbling a bit, and covered in blood. A deal had gone awry and there were some words exchanged that were not pleasant. Wild gestures had been made by both sides and then the next thing Castiel knew guns were being drawn and people were dying left and right.
“What is it?” Castiel asked. He frowned at Crowley who didn’t know how to respond, it seemed. “Fuckin hell, Crowley. The fuck’s wrong?”
Castiel’s eyes fluttered open and he blankly stared at the ceiling. This was something that he had forgotten. He was 9 when he witnessed that meeting. Barth was the head of the Italian mob family then. He was Alastair and Amara’s father.
Balthazar nodded and walked out of the apartment to get their men. Lora excused herself to her bedroom, not wanting to witness the display that was going to take place soon. Castiel sighed and sat properly on the chair. He was tired. He was too old for this already and he was tired. He had been trying to be a better boss for them, and to maintain a personal life, and to keep afloat even when everything was falling apart, but now, he was sure of it, he couldn't have one thing while the other was in crumbles.
Castiel made his way to him, trying to keep his breathing steady. He stopped when he was a bench away from Dean.
“Oh god,” Dean moaned as he felt Mr. Novak sniff under his arm, his face buried in. A low rumble started at the back of his throat, and Dean feeling it through his body, started to sweat a bit more. Mr. Novak nuzzled his face there some more, kissing and licking. And Dean… well, Dean wasn’t feeling weird about it. He was actually enjoying it. He was enjoying the extra attention he was getting. And from it, he was getting harder in his pants.
Dean went limp as soon as he was done. His whole chest was covered in sweat and spunk. He let out a soft whimper when Mr. Novak held him up with one arm and released Dean's arms from the rails and rested them over his shoulders, the handcuffs still on. Dean quickly snuggled closer to him, and Mr. Novak enveloped him in a tight hug.
“I can wait for you here,” Castiel offered and Dean looked at him sharply. Castiel had a moment of fear where he thought Dean was going to agree, but then he shook his head and held out his hand.
Castiel licked his lower lip as he thought about it some more, before he stood up from his chair. Crowley gave him a look that was full of satisfaction. Castiel rolled his eyes as he made his way out. “Get the cars ready. We leave in ten.”
He knew that he had to go to her soon when the sun would come out. He needed to know what the next step was, right? Because he was still part of her… family, if you’d call it that. Dean needed to pull himself-
Natalie left them. Natalie died right in front of Castiel’s eyes. She had been running to him, and Castiel wasn’t able to help her. She had been too young for this. She had been too pure for this. She had been, in some ways, Castiel’s also. Castiel had accepted her as part of him because he was involved with her father. Even when they wouldn’t have worked out in the end, he was still going to take care of the girl as if she was his own kid. But he couldn’t do that anymore. He wasn’t going to have that anymore. She was gone.
Dean laughed at that as he polished off the plate in record time. He asked if he could have another piece, and Anna was more than happy to give it to him. When he finished his second piece, he asked for another piece to bring with him up to his room. Anna was pleased by this and placed another piece in his plate. Lora moved to grab it for him, but Dean took it and claimed that he wanted to eat it on his way to his bedroom. In reality, he was never comfortable with having maids taking care of him. He wasn't anyone special. He was an employee just as much as these ladies.
“Hello, Mr. Novak,” she said, her voice shaking slightly. Her eyes were red and puffy. She had been crying. “What can I get you?”
Castiel had a feeling. And when he had a feeling, he usually acted on them. And when he acted on them; there was always blood. And if it meant that he was going to get his hands bloody again, for Dean, then he was going to gladly get his hands dirty.
Dean shook his head and said, “Nothing. I’ll tell you later on today. But right now, we need to get out of here.”
What were the chances of him meeting the man who has written so many amazing books that the whole world was reading? And were, understandably, obsessed with them. He started reading them first when he was in the army, and the nights were long and dreary, and very hot. His comfort had been reading these books. And now he was sitting, and having a drink with the man who kept him from losing it all.
“Look, Castiel, it’s your life, and you make these decisions, but…” she sat forward and didn’t continue until he was looking at her. “I just want you to be truly happy.” Anna’s red hair was framing her face beautifully. They were sibling, and where Castiel was exactly like their father, Anna looked like their mother. Who wasn’t in the picture anymore… He didn’t want to remember, or think, as to
“Dean,” Castiel breathed out. Almost collapsing in his haste to get to the men on the pipes that looked like a cross. Castiel stood up before the man that he loved, the man that he did all of this for… Dean looked so different. He was bloodied, and he didn’t open his eyes even when Castiel touched his cheek. He didn’t even say anything. His breathing was hard and heavy. It didn’t sound like a healthy breath.
Castiel went into a plank position for another minute, breathing through the spasm that his body went through, and then he slowly lowered himself on the matt and then went up into a cobra. He breathed through the stretch, his face looking up at the ceiling, his eyes close as he stopped thinking altogether.
Dean followed this action with looking at him through the same expression as before. Castiel sat and rested his hands on his lap. He was wearing gloves, of course, but it was a bit chillier than usual. They sat like that for a while. Dean staring at him, and he staring right back at him. Castiel didn’t even care that they weren’t talking. The last time he had seen Dean, was nothing compared to what he was seeing right now. If someone were to say that Castiel had missed seeing Dean’s face, that would’ve been an understatement of the year.
Thankfully, they arrived to Castiel’s house and he refrained himself from running up and into the house while dragging Dean behind him. His pants were doing nothing to hide his erection from the people who worked there, and frankly he didn’t give a damn if they saw how hard he was. Really, he was around Dean almost every day, and Dean was an extremely attractive man. So it was obvious that he was going to support a hard-on even just by looking at Dean.
“What year?” Emilio asked, looking interested. The conversation picked back up around him again, but it didn’t disrupt their ongoing one.
Mr. Novak’s face hardened and he trailed his hand down Dean’s back and placed it over his waist. He squeezed the skin there and tried to relax. Dean turned around in his lap and scooted closer to him. Dean leaned up against him, and wrapped his arm around his neck. Out of mind, Dean placed a small kiss on Mr. Novak’s temple. Mr. Novak tightened his hold on Dean’s waist and he sighed out from his nose.
The ceremony didn’t last very long; the couple was asked to kiss each other and as they did, they were blessed by everyone cheering them on. Their smiles were blinding to the people. Dean even sniffed a couple of times, and subtly brushed at his eyes with his fingers. Weddings made him emotional, okay?
Even if the afternoon sky was casting shadows over the trees, and the soft light of it was playing over Mr. Novak’s features making him look angelic, and his intense blue eyes were even bluer in this light… he was not going to be dragged into the forest to be introduced to the wolves.
After hours and hours of playing with Natalie, making dinner for them all, being convinced to spend the night over, Dean finally relaxed back on the couch with a beer in his hand. Natalie was in bed already, Ray by her side, after taking his walk around the garden and taking care of his business. Sam was sitting with Jessica on the loveseat, tucked close together. Jess was having tea and Sam was having a beer. He had an important case to take care, hence why he went to the office on a Sunday. It was something big; about some sort of company being accused of selling fattening products and it was Sam’s job to prove them all wrong. It was more of a headache than anything else, but if Sam could win this, he was going to get bumped up from his current position at the law company.
Once in his bedroom, Castiel went to take a shower. He let the warm water cascade over his body as he hung his head forward and squeezed his eyes shut. He wasn’t going to break down here. That would seem incredibly cliché and a B-rated movie where the main character always ended up crying over hurt feelings in the shower. He wasn’t going to be that character.
Mr. Novak pulled back and looked at Dean, with his eyebrow raised that made Dean want to drop to his knees and let Mr. Novak take control over his
It was Mr. Novak’s turn to hum at the gesture, and Dean huffed out through his nose, his lips turning up into smile. He opened his eyes a fraction, and saw the soft smile on Mr. Novak’s face that made his heart go into overdrive.
“I don’t think it’s wise to leave you alone like this, right now,” Dean said in a gentle voice and how Castiel wished he could will himself to let Dean be in the same room as he was, right now. How he wished he could allow Dean to see him like this. But he couldn’t. He wasn’t allowed to show Dean his weaknesses. Not all of them. Certainly, not this one.
“It is,” Dean said nodding. Anna moved away from the girls and started taking out the cutlery for the dinner table. “Wait, Anna,” Dean held up his hand towards Anna, but he walked to where Mr. Novak was standing. In a low voice between them, Dean asked, “Do you think we can eat in somewhere private?”
“You still feel the need to… to talk to him,” Amara said, her face clearing. “You still need him. Just like he needs you.”
“You’re gonna love this,” Dean as he presented it to Mr. Novak’s lips. He grabbed Dean’s hand and bit down into it. His eyes closed and he moaned as the first taste hit him.
“Hello?” he answered his call. There was a rustling breath on the other side of the call. Castiel’s heart started to beat faster. “Hello?”
His bedroom was vast and the whole house was far warmer than his one at the States. The bedroom held knick knacks from over the years that he had spent in here. His bed was luxurious and big. The blankets were silk and cotton, and it felt incredibly nice on naked skin. He couldn’t be able to enjoy it this time around, unless he’d explicitly tell Dean to sleep in one of the guest bedrooms.
“Castiel,” he replied, reluctantly tearing his eyes away from Dean’s to give his full attention to the kid.
“You don’t get to speak to me like that,” Castiel said to his back. Dean shook his head, and without looking back, he made his way out of the bathroom. Castiel stumbled after him. His mouth didn’t want to cooperate with him though. “You don’t get to talk to me at all. I’m not your brother, or kid, or whatever. I’m your boss. I’m the one who pays you to get fucked by me,” he spat, and he didn’t even have it in him to shut up because his words were stabbing at Dean. He was literally going to wreck him if he continued, but he couldn’t shut up. “You’re nothing but a whore to me. And you’re nothing but just a good fuck for me. Nothing more.”
“Thank you. Your brother thinks so too,” she said and Dean grinned at her. She smirked at him and finished her drink. “Now, don’t change the subject.”
Dean looked down at her feet as he kept massaging them. He was sure that Sam had already told her about his life, but she would pretend that she didn’t know anything about it. Just to be sure that Dean could trust her anyway.
“Sshhh… I got you. I’m here now…” Castiel moved his head forward and took Dean into his mouth. Dean let out a sob and he started to cry. Castiel’s hands moved from his chest to his hips to his sides, and back again. He was trying to apologize to Dean, silently, about this mistreatment.
an ordinary looking guy, Dean Winchester, meet wolves. Actual live wolves. The gorgeous man was crazy.
“I dint- I dd-nn-uh,” Gabriel was trying to say something, but Castiel didn’t listen. His ears were ringing. He was raging.
Balthazar smirked at him and then he turned away from the table. “Okay, boys,” Balthazar said and he clapped his hands together making the two guys jump from the noise. “Time for some unpleasant changes.”
“Can I talk to you? In private?” Dean asked, as he stared at the others. There was a young boy, that was sitting close to the table. He looked young enough to be a teenager. And Dean had no idea what Castiel had been thinking to recruit this person. But it wasn’t his place to ask such things. So he just ended up glaring at the boy, who quickly turned his stare away, and directed it at the table. Good. Maybe he’ll learn his place.
Castiel stared at Balthazar's profile, and then peered at the two men, who barely kept their heads high. “He has secretly started a war against me. So I'm going to, publicly, accept his... advances.”
Dean didn’t answer. Castiel could hear him puttering around the kitchen. Castiel walked toward the window and stared outside. The streets were quieter here, even though it was only around 10 pm at night. There were some people walking up and down the streets, though. A pack of stray dogs passed by, and Castiel smiled to himself, as one of the people on the street, got scared of them. It made him remember his pack, and before he could feel sad about it, there was a tap on his shoulder. Castiel turned around and Dean was standing there, with two mugs of steaming…
“Of course it’s okay,” he said, his lips turning up into a genuine smile. Dean’s happiness was contagious. “I’ll drive you there.”
Few minutes later he was opening and closing the backdoor and making his way around the kitchen. Anna was working on a soup, and Lora was on her phone. Both of them straightened a bit when they saw him, but he waved his hand at them as he passed. They had been talking about something but they got quiet as he passed. Castiel, of course, had a feeling as to what the subject of their conversation was. They had been doing that for months now.
“I may have some ideas on who may be at fault in here,” said Crowley, after staring at Castiel for a bit.
The threat that Castiel placed on him was a clear indication as to how serious he was being. The silence from Sam’s side was tense. “You find them. Alive. Get it?”
Once they were ready to leave, Anna hugged him goodbye and asked him to stop by again to help her out with some preparations for the wedding. Dean gladly agreed. Although, he didn’t know if he should’ve agreed to spent more time with her, considering his position with her brother.
They ended up exchanging phone numbers. Dean found out that Castiel was living in Manhattan, too, and they agreed to get coffee together one day.
from the bag next, with its leg holster. He secured it on his calf and placed the gun in there. He took out two
It was starting to get dark outside, the sun setting at the horizon, giving a nice glow to the area. There was a slight wind in the air, and it was soothing on their heated bodies. Dean was dancing with a little girl when he heard the planner call out for order; it was time for Anna and Emilio’s first dance. Dean told the girl to go and find her mama, and turned around to move back to his table. Only to find Mr. Novak’s chair vacant. He frowned and looked about, but there was no sign of him. He was probably in the bathroom. He shrugged and walked back to his table. He sat down and fetched out his phone to check for messages. There wasn’t any from his brother, or Jess. He locked his phone and placed it back into his pocket.
Dean looked down at his bloodied shirt, at his hands, and then back up at his face. He dropped to his knees in front of Castiel, licked his lips and said, “Tell me how to do this.”
“Charlie,” Castiel said. “You… I will do this whether you like it or not. You’re lucky that it was me who caught you. Somebody else, wouldn’t have been this generous with you. Trust me.” He put a heavy emphasis on the words he spoke so she’d get it. Few seconds later, her eyes widened as she understood what he was saying.
“Take care of the bills,” Castiel finally said. He kept staring at Balthazar to gauge his reaction to what Castiel was telling him to do. Maybe he’d get it without having Castiel tell him about it explicitly. “Make sure that the guys get at least a week off. Let them go and do whatever they want. Only for a week. When they’re back, we have work to do. We still need to take care of a lot of stuff that has been left behind Alastair and Gordon.”
“How often do they check these places?” Castiel asked, his eyes lingering on Alfie a bit longer, then moved up to look at Dean.
Dean’s face cleared, although, his mouth twitched up into a tired little smile, “I wouldn’t expect anything else from you.” And before Castiel could answer that, whatever even that meant, Dean turned around and walked out of the room. Opening and closing the door after him, with a soft click, the room was silent, safe for Castiel’s heavy breathing.
“No, let me talk,” Dean said, with a shake of his head. His hair was white from the snow. His eyelashes had some snow on them, but they melted away as he blinked, only to be taken by more snow. Castiel swallowed, but nodded. He kept his mouth shut to let Dean speak his mind. He owed him that much… “From the moment I got to know you, or even before that. Probably, I don’t know. But when I started to get to know
Despite having so much paper strewn around the table, Dean was sure that Sam knew exactly where everything was. He remembered when they were kids, just to screw up with Sam, he decided to mix up at least 3 papers. When Sam tried to get the right paper, he ended up with an entirely different paperwork. It took him hours to find the right one. He was so stressed out, he actually started to cry. It was an awful thing to do by Dean to Sam, so it just stuck to him as something that he would never do himself.
Castiel pulled back. Azazel went down to the floor like a rag doll. Castiel breathed out through his nose and went to retrieve his gun from the floor. It was covered in specks of blood. He wiped it on his pants, but it didn’t help much. He clenched his teeth and shook his head. When he was about to leave, he noticed Azazel’s leg twitch. He clocked his gun and pointed at Azazel’s forehead and shot, once. The man stopped twitching.
When they were done with the call and Castiel nursed a whiskey in his office, Castiel realized that it had been disappointment. He knew why she had sounded like that. Castiel sighed through his nose, and drunk the rest of his whiskey in one gulp. And then poured himself another glass.
his ass to move Dean's boxers down with his hands… Down his legs and to the floor. He tapped at Dean's legs and Dean helped him to get his boxers off. Dean's dick was half hard, but it was going to get steadily hard because of how Mr. Novak was touching.
For the first time in years, Castiel’s throat tightened. He didn’t say anything as Dean knelt before him once again, and started to take off his shoes and socks. Then Dean helped him up and started to unbutton his shirt. He took it off and dropped it on the floor. Next, he undid Castiel’s zipper and pulled his pants down. Castiel leaned on his legs in turn as Dean took his pants off. Castiel tried not to shiver with the realization that this was the first time both of them were naked. Even though Dean couldn’t see his body, Castiel had never felt this exposed before.
“My kid got killed,” Dean yelled, spinning around. Bobby’s expression shifted from anger to sadness in a second. “I got my kid killed because I knew better than to introduce her to someone who was a danger to all of us.”
Castiel nodded at him and helped him to gather up his papers. He thanked Castiel one more time and then left.
He closed the first drawer and opened up the second one. This one had ropes, thin silk fabric to use if they preferred that, and handcuffs; leather, metal, and fluffy. He opened another drawer and it was filled with more toys. His eyes caught on gag ball and nipple clamps. He closed that and took a step back.
Castiel walked back around the desk, and situated himself in between Dean’s legs. He grabbed onto Dean’s hips and pulled him over the edge again. “But I have plans,” he said as he pushed Dean’s legs up and towards his chest. He grabbed his dick with his other hand and guided him into Dean.
“Bobby’s here,” he said once Castiel stepped out of the car. Suddenly Dean looked nervous, running a hand over his mouth. Castiel leaned up against the car, his hands going into his sweatpants pockets. He was wearing casual clothes, with a black T-shirt that was a bit tight on him, but he liked feeling the stretch.
“I can’t push you into doing this, where I can feel that you’re not comfortable with it,” Dean said. “How about, I turn off the lights, leave one of the curtains open for a bit of a light to get inside, so we won’t trip and break out necks-“ that earned him a small huff of laughter, “-and we can take care of this in the dark, hm? Will that be okay for you? Will you be able to do it?”
Dean felt flustered, and his chest filled with the warmth that only his baby could fill with. “Yeah…” he cleared his throat and said, “Say goodbye to your mom, so we can move.”
“No, no,” Anna said with a smile directed at him. “You can tell him to come and pick you up, if you want to.”
But before the doors slid close he saw Gabriel run a hand through his hair and heave out a defeated sigh.
“10 bedrooms?” Dean asked, unable to leave out a note of surprise from his voice. His eyebrows shot up and his hand stopped midway to his mouth.
His reply was a smile and a tightening of Mr. Novak’s hands on his thighs. Next thing he knew, he was being thrown on the bed and a lean body following up. Dean grabbed on to Mr. Novak and pulled him down on top of him. Spreading his legs wide, Mr. Novak situated himself in between Dean’s legs.
Dean wasn’t around. He was still missing. It’s been a day since Castiel got the news. Crowley suggested he get some shut eye for a while, but he didn’t have it in him to sleep. Because he didn’t know where Dean was, and who he was with, and if he were well and alive, and just…
Dean clenched his jaw, but didn’t disagree. He shook his head and turned away from Castiel. He walked to the coffee table, grabbed their mugs and walked to the adjoined kitchen. “You’re right,” he said as he washed the mugs and placed them to dry. “You are right. But…what I was trying to say is, I wouldn’t be here with her today if I didn’t… if we didn’t break things off. Not in the way that we have.”
He quickly got another bullet in the bazooka and got in position. He looked through the hole to see if there was anything left of them, when he saw some of the men limping their way to the other SUV that was a little bit way off where they had originally stood at. They were close to the car, when Castiel didn’t even think twice as he aimed his next shot at the car. This time he was ready for the impact and Castiel looked upon them as the car exploded and several men had blasted right fuck off the sight.
Castiel walked up to the ones that he shot first, writhing in pain and grunting, holding to the parts where they were bleeding from. He pointed his gun at the first person closest to him. “Where’s Alastair?”
“Come here, baby,” Natalie went to her willingly and she even hugged her mom extra, and promised to be good and listen to her dad.
“Anytime, brother. And hey,” she grabbed onto his shirt as he started to move, holding him in place. “If you need some advice on how to make him swoon, just let me know.”
He waited about five minutes, and the door that was right next to his bedroom opened, and Mr. Novak walked out. He quirked an eyebrow at Dean and said, “Ready?”
“She's the second important Anna in my family. The other one is my little sister. She doesn't live here.”
Castiel didn’t wait for an answer. He just bolted out of the room, and leaned against the wall outside of the door, which clicked shut after him. He breathed heavily in and out. This was going to be complicated and awful. He was going to tell Dean everything. He slid down the wall and sighed out. He placed his arms over his bent knee and closed his eyes. He was pretty sure that Dean was going to kick him out. He was going to break things off and he was going to tell Castiel to never contact him again.
Castiel dropped his hand from his face and said, “Yeah. I have offered it.” Castiel rubbed a hand over his face again, and whispered. “Fuck.”
"I thought so too. But I guess he wasn't," They were silent for a while. Sam was staring down at his covered hand with a distance look on his face. Castiel waited a moment longer before he asked. "Can you tell me what happened while you were captured?"
Dean blushed a bit, a warmth that had nothing to do with the lovely weather blooming over his chest, and settling down in a contented hum on his heart. He ignored it as best as he could, as he leaned a bit forward and said to Mr. Novak, “I have no idea who we’re sitting with.”
“You can sit anywhere you want, doll,” Mr. Novak pulled back slightly, bent Dean’s head a bit forward, and placed a small kiss on his forehead. Dean’s inside got flooded with butterflies.
Days passed by. Dean didn’t wake up long enough to hold on a normal conversation. Sam would come in early in the mornings, check up on his brother, not even acknowledging Castiel’s presence in the room. He spoke to the doctors, the nurses. But never to Castiel.
Why would Dean want to love him? He wasn’t anything special. He wasn’t anything. He was a killing machine and that’s it. That was it. He was just a mindless killing machine. And Dean, pure, simple, beautiful Dean wanted to love him. Wanted to prove to him that he was something worthy of having. He wasn’t. Why wouldn’t Dean just leave?
Lucifer snorted and rolled his eyes, his smirk wiping off of his face in a second. “Right, because our father was so amazing that he not only named me after the devil, but he made sure that I became one as well.”
“Do as I say,” Castiel commanded him. Dean knelt beside the bed and rested his chest over the bed. He had his arms under his head. Castiel jingled the handcuffs and Dean quickly placed his hands over his back. Castiel handcuffed Dean’s hands behind his back and he could see how Dean was relaxing back on the bed. Castiel felt at is himself when he saw it.
Dean walked into the room and had to stop. Mr. Novak basically had his own BDSM room that Dean was familiar on seeing at the community clubs. Dean walked in a bit further and looked around the room. It was in darker colors, compared to the other rooms in the mansion. It had darker lightning to it, which gave the room a sultry look. Dean turned around and eyed one of the walls that looked the busiest. The whole wall was dedicated to floggers, canes, paddles, and, Dean gave a small shudder, a whip. It was one of his favorites. The pain was sharp and lasted long, but it gave pleasure that Dean couldn't get from anything else.
Castiel threw his glass right at Gabriel’s face. The glass shattered and Gabriel let out a howl of pain as some shard cut through his skin. Castiel didn’t allow him to push himself away from the desk; he just leaned forward, grabbed him from the neck and pulled him over the desk. He flipped Gabriel over to his back and tightened his hold over Gabriel’s neck.
“I think you've had enough, don't you?” his voice was hard, an authoritative tone to it. He was testing the waters, to see how much power he had here.
Dean looked at her and saw that she was pale as sheet. Dean flicked his eyes to Castiel and his heart clenched. He looked terrible. He looked drawn out, and he looked like he hadn’t slept for days. He looked extremely tired. He was drunk. Too drunk.
Somebody said in a panicked voice. And it took Castiel a moment to realize that it was his voice. He didn’t realize it was his voice until now.
Their eyes met; Dean’s eyes were wide, and before Castiel could only see worry and confusion, now it held honesty in them, and something more that Castiel couldn’t place his finger on. They stared at each other for a minute more, and then Castiel relaxed back on the bed. The tension that was in his body the minute he walked inside his house, left him in a rush. His body turned into liquid as he placed his head, face down, on Dean’s chest. He breathed in and out, through his nose, trying to calm down his wildly beating hard, but he couldn’t. It was too hard. It was hard to breathe.
“Then what is it? What's so great about this?” Sam asked. He did sound like he didn't want to yell at Dean for this, and wanted to understand this as much as he could. So Dean thought that it was better to be true about this whole thing.
“I was hoping we'd have dinner together before I'll give you the tour of the house,” Mr. Novak said as he indicated to the table. But Dean's attention was snatched by the gorgeous scene outside. The big windows were something that Mr. Novak seemed to love, and it was worth it. The windows were looking out at the backyard which seemed to be endless. The setting sun was visible from here and it painted a great view, shadowing over the tall trees.
“You’re not as discreet and quiet about it, as you think you are,” Dean replied with a shrug, as if it didn’t matter. He said so, too. “It doesn’t matter. I want them all dead.”
“Out,” Castiel said to the girls, his voice a low growl. The sloppy sound that the girl made as she retracted herself from his lap was lewd. She wasn’t wearing anything. Both of the girls grabbed their robes and quickly left the office. The elevator doors hissed shut after them.
“Alastair has them,” Castiel said to the room at large. He was wearing his sweat pants and a t-shirt. His hair was all over the place, his scruff looked awful compared to the tired eyes. He didn’t look, or felt like himself. He was tired.
“Can you add more syrup to my pancakes?” the question was so out of the blue and so not the question that Castiel was expecting her to ask, that he closed his eyes, hung his head forward, and shook it in disbelief.
“You care for him,” it wasn’t a question. It was a statement, and Castiel turned around to look at Dean; who was talking to Bobby. They didn’t look upset, which was good.
Dean walked down the hallway, and after a moment Castiel followed him. The tall man spotted him first and his face transformed into one of happiness. They hugged tightly and then Dean moved on to clap the redneck’s shoulder, squeezing it hard.
. His heart clenched at the image. He quickly changed that into his wallpaper and locked his phone before he’d start crying.
It was a pure torture being here when he had that memory and despite the sourness the memory brought itself with, Castiel missed Dean. Missed having him around, arguing with him, laughing at him, or with him, he simply missed Dean’s presence in his life.
“No,” Castiel said, pinching the bridge of his nose. “No. I can’t…. I can’t do that. You know that I can’t, Anna.”
