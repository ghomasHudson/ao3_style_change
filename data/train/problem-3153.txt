"Maybe you just have too small ears." Cas didn't even realize he was taking Dean's side until Penny looked at him with an exaggerated glance of betrayal. They continued fighting over, this the way friends do, when Penny started rolling a cigarette. Dean asked if she wanted to grab some coffee with them after smoking, and he noticed Taylor, the lead singer, coming out of her trailer behind Penny. He didn't mention it to her since they were already bantering, and he didn't need to add any more fuel to the fire. Taylor looked around, taking a cigarette of her own from a pack, right from the pocket of her shirt. She looked for a lighter but, realizing she wasn't carrying one, looked over at the group. Penny was still chatting with the boys, waiting for her, her lighter in one hand, which caught Taylor's eye. She went over to ask for light and lingered on, asking Penny for some photo stuff from earlier. Dean and Cas saw this as a good opportunity to leave them alone, playing a little matchmaking. They excused themselves politely and headed to the coffee area, giggling halfway there.
Dean's smile turned even more mischievous, assuming Cas found the scenes hot as he did. He slapped his friend on the shoulder, jokingly, "Way to go Cas. I'm telling you, there's only one reason to watch that movie and it ain't the plot."
It was a small place with a rustic vibe, the wood was predominant, but Dean liked that to some extent. Sam had picked the place - obviously - it was way fancier than what Dean was familiar with. Not that he didn't have the money for it, he was actually quite stable, but he didn't really care for fancy restaurants. Now fancy baths - that was something else!
After the coffee, already feeling a bit more awake and cheery, he decided to go outside and join the others before the craze of the load-in would start. Finding his way outside he saw Penny, the photographer, standing outside the bus, gear in hand, getting ready to out and capture the tour life.
Dean left his things in the guitar tech assigned dressing room and readily got to work, leaving Charlie to attend to her duties.
Sam, who was browsing through his phone while waiting, says, without looking up, "You're in a good mood." Putting his phone away, he notices the keychain dangling from his brother's hand, "Dude, is that Han Solo?"
"Hey! Come on, there's nothing wrong with it." - he puts a hand on his brother's shoulder, trying to comfort him - "You've had boyfriends before. Mum and dad know about it, and they will always support you. I mean, you heard mum teasing you about Cas, so what's the problem?"
Sam was a little uncomfortable but answered, "Well, I just... in psychological terms, we want to know how much it actually affects kids. On the law side of it, we want to protect them... So no kid ever gets to the point we did."
The flight was quite stable and went by surprisingly fast. Before long, Dean found himself at the airport searching for someone carrying a sign saying "Dean Winchester". It wasn't hard to find, though, her ginger hair standing out in the crowd.
After opening the cardboard box, he found another, smaller one, inside - which was weird as hell - and he took it out, getting annoyed with the heavy amount of paper around it. After struggling for a few seconds, he looked at the box design, and his face lit up. Taking it out, he admired the adorable keychain - a big head and a little gun on Han Solo's minuscule hand. Further down the original box, he glimpsed a card - on closer inspection, Dean noticed it was a store-bought birthday card for a 5-year-old birthday, which made him laugh uncontrollably - It read, "We only watched one Star Wars movie together, but Charlie reassured me you would like this. Plus, he looked just like you!"
Halfway through the song, Anna gave up while each of the participants struggled to keep up with the song.
"Dean. Calm down. You didn't do anything. Yeah, you texted a little, but I stopped you before you could ruin things too much."
"Dean, does me walking like this seem to you I have the time to talk?", it comes out a bit aggressive but Dean's used to managers behaving like that since they're under a lot of pressure.
An entire ordeal is prepared for the entire crew, the band, managers, and everyone else to arrive in London as early as humanly possible. They are flying with the usual bus crew, plus part of bus number two  - which Charlie is in - while Penny travels with the band.
Castiel starts helping Dean out, he has visibly had some experience before even though Dean has to help him in a few things and correct him in others, which is normal because every band is different.
The next morning they left for the airport, stopping at the 24h hotel bar for Dean's cup of coffee - "I'm already afraid of planes, Cas, you want me to be annoyed too?"
"I just got some very exciting news!" Dean looked at the woman intently, waiting for her to reveal the news.
Cas squints his eyes as if their efforts to defend the movie choice were completely unnecessary to him.
"The new guy from work. He was the one who got me that.", he said - tilting his head towards the ring on his mother's hand, at the word that.
They arrived at the O'Hare International Airport, buzzing with people already. Dean was dropped off behind a neverending row of cars in the Departures section. Leaving the driver with a thank you nod, Dean shuffled inside, trying not to bump into anyone.
"What?" Dean stops in his tracks to look back at his brother's suggestive face. "Oh, c'mon, man... Not you too."
Dean sat down, saying hello to everyone: Garth, Anna, Rowena, Gabriel, and Crowley. Rowena and Crowley were actually cousins, and they were the biggest helpers of Dean's "rock trade" in school. Garth and Anna were, like Sammy, theatre kids, and that's where they met. Oddly, Gabriel was part of both groups and brought the gang together with his fun personality. Though they had several other friends in common, most of them were out of town, so they fell apart a little.
"At work? They're testing the speakers, but the venue has their own sound techs." This made sense - often, the local sound techs set up certain venue equipment before the guests arrived.
Dean was set to return on the last day of the US leg so he could settle in and travel with the rest of the crew. They were going to Europe the next day - which didn't appeal to him that much - but the thought of being back on the road (or the air, in this case) had him on cloud nine.
"Trust us. He'll come around. it's the boyfriend you have to look out for." Penny says, working her way through the bag of chips.
"Hey! That was Charlie, she's joining us in Seattle." Before Castiel had the chance to ask who Charlie was Dean started picking stuff up while saying "Let's go, time for Soundcheck."
It was getting nearer to 11 a.m., and Dean was getting nervous each minute. The night before, he had taken Cas' help, and they both made a playlist so he'd have something to listen to on the plane. Just before boarding, another text came in.
Dean pulls up at the restaurant's parking lot, where Sam is already waiting, leaning against his car. He parks in the vacant spot next to Sam and gets out of the car, grinning.
"Morning sunshine" - Dean said in a friendly way, they had been together on tour for quite some time and he liked that small woman. She was very similar to him in terms of personality so they got along well.
Brushing the thought off, he grabs his bag and his old leather jacket and leaves the bus quietly. He crosses last night's venue parking lot, getting to the next block where his Uber must be waiting. He checks the app while walking, trying to remember the car model.
His last few days in town were spent between family and friends. Bowling, having brunch with Sam (Dean didn't want to admit he actually liked that), going out for drinks with the gang, family activities with Harry and Ruth, going to the movies (he missed that so much). But what he had missed the most were the little things he didn't have on tour. His mother's homemade meals, staying in one place for a while, the sense of familiarity, hanging out with his dad and hearing his jokes, chilling out in the back garden without the rush of tour life.
Dean finds his way back to Cas, walking slowly, sadly. Cas is now sitting on a table, waiting, checking his phone, and knows right away something is off. "What's wrong?"
Castiel was nervous walking up to Michael, he was highly talked of in the music business and this was a big job after all so being requested after the Load-Off was concerning to him. Michael cast him aside, a drink in his hand, the other on Cas' shoulder. "Listen, I liked your performance tonight! I noticed that bass problem and how promptly you solved it, I think this is great for Dean and takes a great load off him. He hasn't gone home for a while and family means a lot to him so I wanted to hire someone soon long-term to be able to help him on the road, do you think you can handle that?"
Dean chose to open the small box before he had his coffee, which he actually could skip afterward because of how cute and thoughtful the gift would turn out to be.
"Well, you know I can't give you a lot of details on the cases, but I can tell you I'm thinking of starting an investigative work - and since Eileen might be joining the team, she might even help! She fights domestic violence, and I wanted to start some research about kids in abusive households... you know. Because of us."
Cas smiles a cute resigned smile and sits back down on the bed. Penny crawls to him and gives him a friendly hug from the back. They keep on eating and chatting until it gets too late.
He finally emerged from a sea of bodies onto an ocean of people with signs carrying various names. Even though Sam was tall, it took him a while to find him but, alas, there he was, looking the same as ever.
"Yeah, I've been working locally. This is my first big gig though.", Castiel answers happily. "Why did your friend Nick leave?"
Dean wakes up, cranky as usual. He gets down from his bunker, puts on some black jeans and a black t-shirt. He starts walking down the bus, saying a small hello to everyone he passes, getting his shoes and a shirt on the way out. That's how tour life is: busy, from the moment you wake up until you go back to sleep. As Dean steps out of the bus he sees some of his co-workers and friends chatting, smoking, or drinking coffee near the venue. Dean walks inside the building and finds Alejandra, the tour manager, setting up signs to where everything is. He mumbled a quick "Morning" as he thought "I need to get some coffee, fast". Fortunately for him, Alejandra had already set up the signs for the bar area and he quickly found some coffee to ease his morning moodiness. He knew this was the quiet part of the job, only having small moments of rest throughout the day. Dean walks around, familiarizing himself with tonight's venue, looking at the stage, crew members already up and ready, looks up where each area is, and starts to mentally note everything while finishing his coffee. This is the little routine he has, in a place where things change every second.
This is kind of a filler chapter just to get to the next part of the story. Nevertheless, I still hope it was somewhat enjoyable.
"Yeah, we got new gear. They're beautiful. There's a metallic black guitar over there with golden details and another dark one. Look at it, you can even see your face on it."
At first, Sam thinks he is joking. Upon looking at his brother's face, though, he understands he's actually worried about falling in love with this guy.
But as the month came to an end, and even though he had talked to Charlie and Cas a few times, his heart missed the tour life. He was happy to go back to that frenzy, at last.
Later in the evening, after Load-Off, Cas and Dean are alone on the bus, which is rare, and Dean looks uneasy. Castiel, who was getting ready to change, sets his sleeping clothes aside and sits next to him, waiting. Dean glares at Castiel, himself getting ready to go to bed as well. Understanding Cas won't let it go until he tells him what's bothering him, he yields and speaks up. "It wasn't nothing... Back at the show."
They sat down at one of the wooden tables, the menu placed on each of them in an organized manner. It seemed like one of those places that even had a website and online bookings, whereas Dean was more of a walk-in diner kind of guy. Still, reluctantly, he picked up the menu and went through it, eventually picking up one of the burgers Sam had recommended. Sam himself chose the house special brunch menu. After the waiter took their order, Sam got back to his former teasing about Castiel.
"Morning," he said, planting a kiss on her forehead. She smiled and pointed to the coffee pot, brewed not long ago.
"Hey! How's my girl?" Dean answered happily. Castiel saw a redheaded woman on the phone and felt bad for glancing over. He saw that she was very beautiful.
If his condition had already improved so far that he could leave the hospital, Castiel wonders, maybe he let him have that win.
He pulls Dean closer all the same, curling up flush against him and burying his head into his stomach. Dean, resigning himself to his fate, lets himself be molded into a human cushion.
“We should really go,” insists Sam, who apparently needs a fresh reminder of who it was exactly that dragged him out of perdition, and that getting into his good graces wouldn't hurt.
But it’s Anna who saves him. Strong, clever, lovely Anna who steers him away from the crowd of atrocious angels and sits him down at a table. “Give him a break.”
He glances at his watch. If he doesn’t want Sam to give him the stink eye for pissing off their patient, he’s gotta work on fixing this before his brother is back.
And then, before Dean can voice his confusion, that exact space between the feathers splits into something like lids and Dean’s staring at a perfectly almond-shaped hole right in the middle of the wing. What takes the cake: the hole stares back at him.
Then it gets to the point where Cas himself gets lost in the act – and afterwards Dean can never, for the life of him, tell what exactly he did to reduce Cas to that state, the answer to that question he’s sure is the answer to the truth about the universe because something between Dean moaning and thrashing like a pro and letting Cas take everything he has to offer’s gotta to do the trick. In any case, Dean knows to start the countdown to the big O when spurts of electrifying grace light up his entire being which Dean can only describe as several orgasms wrecking through his body all at once.
Dean does something with his face that makes Cas want to punch him. “Please, you’re way too boring for puddings.”
Cas, meanwhile, is standing there, feeling little more than a tickle in the area of his stomach, and wondering if being surrounded by fucking idiots might be a just punishment for all the sins he's committed in his life. If so, he'd rather rot in hell if Chuck asked him, but of course he never would.
But patience is a virtue and Dean’ll gladly call himself a saint if only to reap the rewards of this divine service.
Cas frowns. Slowly, he tries to stand up, but Dean’s at his side in an instant, hand pressing against his shoulder in a silent command to take it easy. With no protest except for the scowl on his face, Cas lets himself be positioned against the headboard.
“When?” Inside his head, he was already calculating all the ways he could mitigate Dean’s anger, downplay the situation to something Dean would be agreeable to.
-smiles and though he’d never said anything, Dean’s still rather wary about displaying his love for his best friend in front of other people. Even when those other people are his brother.
The voice was familiar, but unexpected in this setting. Even without being aware of his surroundings, Castiel knew that much. The last time he’d seen him, Benny couldn’t wait to be wherever Castiel wasn’t. And the feeling had been mutual.
For a second, the constriction in his chest was his own, and then he didn’t fall anymore. It hadn’t been a long fall after all, and Cas sighed in relief. The surface against his back was solid and warm and it held him well.
When Cas just eyes the plate in suspicion, she rolls her eyes. “Come on, Cassie, we’ve just returned from the dead, let’s enjoy the perks of human life for a little while, hm?” Anna says, miracling herself her own slice of chocolate cake.
“What happened?” Cas asks, voice rough with sleep, rougher even than normal. He looks around. “Where’s Sam?”
“Yes,” Cas smiles, pleased. He leans forward so that their noses almost brush to get a close-up of Dean's eye-roll when he says, “I told you so. Your beautiful, welcoming heart is not toxic. On the contrary, it is giving and considerate and good ”
“What, you think I sleep with every angel I stab at first sight?” Dean laughs, but it's a quiet thing, still earnest in its carefreeness. “I love you.”
Dean’s brain needs a moment to recalibrate and his voice a glass of water to return. As though Cas read his mind, he’s producing one out of thin air and placing the rim of the glass to his lips. Greedily, Dean swallows it down in one go.
If he turned his head to the side, he’d see Dean’s eyes flit from one side to the other, unseeing, as he tried to piece together various shreds of information.
With a happy sigh, Dean curls deeper into the sheets, his arm draping across Cas’ chest as he lets the angel’s familiar scent lull him to sleep.
Somewhere at their periphery, Eileen responds to Sam's laments about how much time they've wasted with, “I'm actually happy all this happened.”
“You know, it’s okay if you feel hurt anyway,” says Sam, and really, his voice is starting to sound so grating again.
He moves to put the gun onto his nightstand and out of direct reach, and then turns to look at Cas – at all of him.
“I’m… practicing an exchange of energy,” he began. “When I heal, I channel my grace into the wounded body, and instead of laying waste of the broken parts, I… I channel them over to mine.”
“Benny?” The name leaves Dean's mouth like a plea. Cas looks at him. From all the losses Dean had to suffer, he hadn't realized the disappearance of the vampire had hit him this hard.
“We're here to save your ass,” confirms Donna, who has plastered on an encouraging smile that stands in contrast to the sour expressions all around.
Charlie blows up her cheeks, excitement only seeming to increase. “Only a true love’s kiss can awake him. Or, er, give him back control over his nervous system, I guess?” She hits Dean on the clothed arm with the book. “Go kiss him Dean!”
His boss gives him a string of instructions and Castiel struggles to note them down on a stray piece of paper which crinkles on the unreliable surface of his blanket-covered thigh. “Alright, I will… get to that,” he promises, not knowing how he’ll manage any of it in his current situation.
Touched by an angel, Dean feels as pure as it gets. There’s not even any spunk left on their skins: yet another angel perk, go figure.
“Anytime, buddy,” Dean promises, and lifts his hand to Cas’ right shoulder, squeezes once. “Anytime.”
Dean scrunches up his nose. “What the fuck have you been drinkin’?” he asks, because Cas smells like a whole goddamn liquor store.
Half-blindly from the exhaustion that seeps into his bones at the thought, Dean wanders his way through the hall towards his bedroom. When he closes the door, a staggering shape in the darkness almost makes Dean draw his gun. But he realizes quickly enough who that shape is, Dean would recognize it anywhere, that one-of-a-kind smell that reminds so much of the raw energy of the elements that clearly shouldn’t be perceivable in the form of smells but - how else to describe it?
Castiel glances at Sam and Dean, who appear to be so perplexed that they are unable to close their mouths.
Cas just shrugs exaggeratedly. “Felt like it.” And then he looks behind Dean like there’s anything to see there besides a closed door. “Did you, uh, 'grow some tail’?”
“Sure,” Dean says, not very convincing. At Cas’ pointed look he relents, “I guess Anna’s okay. And that customer service angel. Alfie.”
So he turned his attention to the survivors, the humans that had been abused as prey for the vampires to feed on. They looked like death; the side of it that was merciless and brutal and excruciating. Crusted blood glued the strands of their hair together, large gashes separated the skin on various parts of their bodies and when Castiel looked more closely, beyond what was visible to the human eye, he recognized severe internal damages as well.
When Dean looks up at him, a frown painting his expression one of confusion, Cas’ hand finds its spot on Dean’s right shoulder and he squeezes once. “Then
“The book,” continues Dean, a little red in the face, which could be attributed to their previous physical activities but Cas knows better. “With the spindle. That kind of sucked man – I mean, that you weren't able to move was terrible of course, but I'm actually talking about that other thing right now, uhm...,” he sighs, deciding to just spell it out. “I didn’t wanna have a curse make me admit my feelings to you. Or the fact that I have no fucking filter during our stupid arguments. I wanted to do that myself, on my own terms.”
Cas is sitting inside. His booth’s purpusoley facing the door but his gaze is equally purposely focussed on his plate.
“Oooohh!” Gabriel singsongs in delight. “Don’t tell me, I wanna guess! You rode a rollercoaster! You went to Disneyland!”
Closing his eyes, he gathers enough tendrils of his courage to say, “You don’t have to pretend for my sake.”
Shrill and undignified and nearly pissing himself while he’s at it, and it takes him a few more embarrassing seconds to think of grabbing the gun from under his pillow and point it at the friggin’
Rowena excuses herself to catch up on her “beauty sleep” in one of the guest rooms, and Garth seeks out some privacy in the kitchen for a phone call with his wife.
He cuts off this train of thought before it affects him in inappropriate ways. Instead, he stands up and rummages around the room to have at least something to do. Since he can’t leave the room without throwing his friends in a panic, he’ll make do with evading Dean’s hovering and Sam’s worried glances and Charlie’s strategic positioning of the library furniture into an arrangement that’s supposed to be helpful in warding off threats towards him, though Cas fails to see the how in that.
He sounded at least a bit angry, but his tone was lowered to a strangely soft growl. It was nice, his voice.
All the while Cas is drilling into him, pouring him full of divine grace and wrath and purpose and all those good things, and Dean could live like this forever. Let Cas take care of him like this ad infinitum.
He hasn’t noticed the deep sigh that presses out of him until he finds Winchester’s eyes on him. “Family call?”
Something in the way he says it gives Dean the urge to look down to his shoes – no need for his brother to see the unmistakably mushy grin, nor the embarrassing blush that’s taking over Dean’s face. His very new and tentative relationship with the angel had been cause for enough of Sam’s teasing
Winchester’s attention feels like a headache all by itself, his eyes that of a vulture, just waiting for the right moment to peck Castiel’s own eyes out. He doesn’t know if it’s genuine concern or malicious glee at seeing Cas like this. Doesn’t know which he’d prefer.
And then it’s back on him in full force. That icy stare that would burn Dean’s eyes right out of his skull if it could. At least that’s how it looks to Dean.
“Maybe,” Sam pipes up between their quarrel. “Uh. The curses are kind of contradictory, right? The first one, Cas dies if he gets too close to Dean-”
His confrontation with the cursed spindle book has had it’s perks that way, he muses. Because now Dean has abandoned any and all qualms that made him keep his distance. In fact, he has deliberately chosen to sit in the back seat beside Castiel while Sam drives the Impala.
Cas perks up at the mention of his name. For a while there, he seems to be genuinely confused at the question, but opts for a matter-of-fact reaction. “Oh,” he says. “I don’t sleep.”
In fact, Dean could spend hours just staring at the other side of his bed that it is now occupied by six foot of trenchcoated angel. By
Driving for hours and opening himself up to another person, Cas pondered. Even if that other person was Dean?
“Does it hurt, baby?” Dean asks, probably not even noticing the new pet name that just rolled off his tongue. For a moment, Cas forgets to be annoyed with him and revels in the attention Dean gives him so generously.
At that, Dean barks a laugh. “No can do, buddy, it’s an earned title.” The fact that Dean presses another quick kiss to Cas’ lips smoothens the frown of discontent on Cas’ face, however. As does the way Dean’s arm drapes over his shoulder, pressing him against his side as he moves them towards the general direction of the door. “You ready for a ride home?”
“Nothing we couldn't take on, though,” says another woman who must be one of Sam's acquaintances because he identifies her as 'Alicia'. (He stutters out an unnecessary and quite incomprehensible explanation involving post-hunt adrenaline and one-night-stands). “Thankfully, we had the help of an, uh. King of Hell?”
But Cas' mind is still stuck on what Dean said, a specific sentence that has the wheels in his head turning. “Wait a minute,” he says. “Is
save Cas momentarily. At least that’s what he expects, but then Dean fishes his phone out of his jeans pocket, lifts it in the air for Cas to see and presses the decline button.
Dean’s by his side in an instant, checking for injuries with the air of someone who thinks having watched all those episodes of Dr. Sexy automatically gives him the qualifications of a health-care professional. While Dean frets over him, Sam and Charlie check the book carefully, only daring to touch it after producing some gloves for safety.
“Right there, huh,” Dean teases. His damp hair is sticking to his forehead, the tattoo on his chest stands out bright against the flush that has spread there from exertion, and he is beautiful.
“I mean, you guys basically just fight all the time,” he goes on. “Imagine that on an eight hour car ride where neither of you can escape when things get rough.”
And for good measure, he extends his other hand to the lion head and starts to pet the mane – carefully, because that’s still the head of a friggin’ predator that sticks out of his best friend’s neck for fuck’s sake, that shit’s terrifying!
Cas just huffs. “Please. My existence has been full of life-endangering situations before any of you were even so much as a thought in my Father's mind. This,” he gestures from the dying fire on the floor to his damaged skin, “has nothing to do with Dean's penis.”
He doesn’t get that that’s exactly what excites Dean about Cas. Cas keeps him on his toes, keeps the flame between them alight, and Dean craves the way that makes him feel alive. With Cas, the grocery store becomes a war zone. Movie night a court case.
Castiel sighs out an exasperation he doesn’t really feel and lifts a forkful of cake to his mouth. His eyes close at the rich taste. When he opens them again, Anna is watching him with a smirk on her face.
He regards the human head with his adorably mussed hair where it’s flattened from the pillow on one side, as well as the lion head that looks a little less like the zoo animal Dean is familiar with, and more like a very old, very distant ancestor of the good old Twentieth-Century-lion, his mane a dirty shade of gray and so long that it reaches down to Cas’ shoulder.
thing is coming. I demand equality,” argues Cas, angling his body to shield the laptop from Dean’s contemptuous gaze.
“He was so fortunate to grab onto a balcony railing a story below,” Cas relays. “That way he could break his fall more elegantly than I managed.”
It was late when they drove back home to the Bunker and Dean was so looking forward to his bed that he didn’t even crack jokes in reply to Sam’s prodding. Yes, he hadn’t gone with Gina when she’d made obvious advances and even straight-up asked him if she wanted to “come up for a coffee”, but that was just because he didn’t feel like it.
“Cas”, the surface said, and it didn’t sound like a surface at all. It sounded like Dean. “You dumbass. You shouldn’t jump right into this, I said – goddammit, Cas.”
Benny shrugged, entirely unapologetic. There wasn’t much to betray between two beings who had never really shared any form of bond in the first place.
And beyond all that is the way they understand each other. How Cas lets Dean take care of him in the gruff, understated way of his, and how Cas thanks him with his stupid snide remarks that do little to hide the softness around his edges. Sam knows nothing of the times Cas tries to cook meals for him that end up tasting like rubberband when Dean’s back aches too much from work to get back up from the couch. Or the times Cas nuzzles his neck like a touch-starved kitten as they huddle close in the afterglow.
“It worked!” announces Charlie, quietly, as though she doesn’t want to disrupt the solemnity of the moment.
“Nice try,” Dean says. “This thing’s not coming with.” And he pulls the laptop out of the bag by thumb and forefinger, as if the merest touch could infect him with workaholic-itis and transform him into a bore just like Cas.
Castiel is very persistent by nature. He was venerated by his garrison as the angel with the best “pokerface”, as Dean would say. Never twitched a feather no matter the distraction, no matter the pain inflicted on his form by foes in the futile attempt to sift out Heaven’s secrets.
It’s a bit awkward, trying to hug both heads and the body they’re attached to at the same time, especially when there’s also wings involved, but Dean tries anyway. After Cas wraps his wings around the messy pile of bodies they’ve created, it’s actually pretty cozy. Dean could happily stay like this for a while.
Choosing Castiel, he thought, meant saying sayonara to that special kind of excitement in bed and hello to married missionary sex with your socks still on.
Castiel lifts his own lips in a smile that probably looks constrained. “Yes. Uh-” He opens his mouth, closes it again. “It’s good to see you too. Is Sam-”
Cas wants to step back into Dean’s orbit but he’s frozen on the spot. “You–” he starts. Tries again. “You want that?”
Dean’s pretty sure his ears are ringing, or maybe that’s just Cas’ grace singing to him, prophesizing Dean’s Second Coming. Or Third, or Fourth, who can keep count?
Because it's starting to feel like Dean needs to prove something, and this is definitely not how this should go. This thing between them should be slow and sweet and
It's thanks to this closeness that Cas notices a change in Dean, some air that's stuck in his lungs and pressed out in a long exhale.
But he’s barking up the wrong tree. Baby is Dean’s territory, and he’ll defend it against anyone, even the one who gets him laid spectacularly on a regular basis.
The strong hands that gripped Cas by his forearms were also quite nice. Castiel leaned his head against Dean’s chest, letting the man carry his weight, and tilted his head back to get a glimpse of Dean.
Jody resumes with her report. “This bad boy here has made it his life mission to kidnap every, well,” she coughs awkwardly but pulls through, “every
After a long and sating session in the bed with a very naked Dean, Cas rolls half on top of the human again and draws little unintelligible circles onto his bare chest.
Cas rolls his eyes – yes, again, all of them. But it’s a common reaction to their banter, so Dean takes it as a good sign that Cas is more at ease now, and trusts that Dean is saying the truth about liking his morning look.
One minute Dean is bouncing enthusiastically on Cas’ lap, the other Cas finds himself alone on the bed, the weight above his body replaced by nothing more than cool air.
Deeming the situation sufficiently diffused, Dean dares to drag Cas back against him (Cas lets him) and tucks his chin over the other man’s head. “You probably won’t remember this once you’re sobered up, but dude, I hope you’ll appreciate the irony one day, because you-” He presses a soft kiss into Cas’ hair. “Are exactly what I want, buddy.”
“I’m not an idiot, dude, don’t disrespect your queen like that!” Charlie puts her hands on her hips, and it’s curious how she can make herself look taller than Dean despite her actual physical height. “But this is our best shot right now – at least it’s something we can do!”
So Dean does the only thing he knows to do in such a situation. He leans forward and drapes the blanket back over Cas, ignoring the signals of irritation Cas tries to broadcast so intently towards him.
, but all the words in his throat and in his mind and in his heart are swallowed up by Dean’s mouth that crashes into his.
“I can give you that, y'know?” Cas blurts nearly incoherently, so Dean has to pay extra attention to catch every word.
The vampire snorted, and now Castiel could open his eyes wide enough to notice the strain around Benny’s jaw, the tension in the arms he had crossed over his chest. “You should thank me, ya know,” Benny claimed. “Could ‘of been any other day that I’d come collect my blood ration. Any other hospital. But no, it’s on the same day, the same hospital that you crazy bonehead decide to – what the hell’ve ya been doin’ in there anyway?”
“No, you don’t hold it like – give me the–” Cas dives forward to catch his dearest possession before Dean can accidentally let it slip through his fingers. Cas cradles the thing in his arms like a fragile baby.
It stays empty until breakfast arrives, stays empty while Castiel swallows down his meal, and it is still empty when the nurse comes to pick up the tray again.
“I don’t sleep either.” The angel’s voice is very faint now, nothing of that mighty warrior pitch left in it and Dean’s heart aches for him. It must be terrifying, he thinks. Teetering so close to the edge.
It's the wrong thing to do, apparently, because Dean panics. “DON'T POINT SHARP THINGS AT HIM, YOU MORONS!”
“Not all of it, no. Think of this,” and here he makes a gesture that encompasses all three of his additional body parts, “As a three-dimensional projection of a multidimensional object, the object being myself. The three-dimensional level isn’t capable of reproducing the whole image, but what does come through is tangible and true to the original. I suppose it is for the reason of this incompleteness, that the sight does you no harm,” he pauses, training his with contrition filled eyes directly on Dean. “I would never have forgiven myself, had I hurt you, Dean.”
Furrowing his brow, Cas attempts to figure out what causes Dean’s hesitancy, if it’s regret or doubt or something else.. when he realizes that he just furrowed his brow and that’s his eyelids fluttering in reverberation of the pleasant dizziness that comes with Dean’s kiss. Which means he has regained control over his nerves and muscles which means that –
He can only imagine the affronted face the man puts on after this. But he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t care. Lifting the phone back to his ear, he tries for another call.
“Fuck,” Dean says, more than a little breathlessly, because that’s what his train of thoughts has been reduced to – an angel’s ceaseless pounding will do that to you. “Nice guys don’t fuck like that.”
As Dean ushers Alex over to take a look at Cas' legs, Sam and Charlie divide everyone into their stupid groups. Although Alex can't do much more than cool the area of the burn with cold water and put gauze on it, Cas is grateful for the treatment. Holy fire is one of the more painful angel-harming weapons, and the wound will likely take a while to heal.
They were fine overall, he observed, just the usual injuries that came with a hunt, nothing that couldn’t await its healing.
“Come on, Cas,” she says, mirth in her eyes as she elbows him gently in the side. “Live a little.” And with that, she shoves his plate with chocolate cake closer towards him.
“Well,” says Jody, who sets to quench the little fire and wipe up the mess with the joint effort of Sam and Charlie. “Maybe you need to reconsider that, Castiel.”
Dean’s always been better with actions rather than words. That’s why it’s easy, so easy for his hands to come cradling the back of his head, fingers tangling in his hair as he dips Cas and gives him the hell of a kiss he deserves.
“’Course it is,” Winchester protests. “Dude, that’s messed up, he’s your brother.” A look shot towards his brother Sam says everything Winchester thinks of Michael’s management strategies. “He should care more.”
Castiel shouldn’t let his current weakness fool himself. No, his weight was his own to carry, and no one else’s.
His patience is being tested, yes, but Cas must remind himself that a delay is better than a definite
But before he can say anything else, Charlie pipes up. “Uh, hey Scooby Gang? Sorry to interrupt but there's kind of thing going on over in Wichita,” she holds up her phone for everyone to see, which shows some kind of red alert that Cas can't make sense of.
Everyone drops their weapons immediately, but the safety on Garth's gun must not have been on anymore, and upon hitting the ground, it shoots out one bullet which lands, as if perfectly aimed, in Cas' stomach.
But the boy and the girl – siblings, Castiel noted after a brief skimming of their consciousness – were writhing on the floor, faintly crying out the pain and sorrow that was finally, finally heard.
It only makes sense that a man as loud as Winchester would be coming from a family of the same temperament.
So Sam, casually ignoring any and all of Cas' complaints, explains: “Charlie and I have established a schedule for the teams that keep an eye on Cas. Since most of us are human and we need to eat and sleep, we should take turns.”
“With the oh so thrilling book series 'The Winchester Gospels' as source, I've made a statistic including any of Sam and Dean's casualties as a whole, see.”  Charlie worries her lip, careful to phrase her observations in a way that doesn't add to Sam and Dean's feelings of guilt too much. She opens a file on another tablet and hands it to Cas. “89% of victims that died in relation to Winchester activities, directly or indirectly, were in a romantic or sexual relationship with either Sam or Dean, or both.”
“Sure, I can see you not-caring all over the pub’s shrinking stock of booze,” Sam huffs at him. “Cas, you never drink.”
So Cas straightens and fumbles at his crooked tie to restore the relative neatness of his appearance. The fact that the tie is put on backwards doesn't stop him.
He doesn’t notice the tear running down his cheek until Dean wipes it away with a calloused finger. Cas takes that same hand and presses a kiss to his knuckles, still swollen from whatever recent physical fight he had and Cas
Cas moves to cradle Dean’s face, and it takes Dean a moment to realize that the touch doesn’t come from Cas’ hand but from his wing. He presses his face against the feathers, soaking in the feeling of comfort that is just as strong like this as it is coming from human limbs and skin.
Since sharing a room, Castiel has met Winchester’s brother Sam, what Cas assumes is his father Bobby, his sister-or-girlfriend Jo (Cas is at a loss in that regard) and her mother Ellen. Cas also learned that the Winchester family is acquainted with a morally questionable hacker named Charlie-something, a conspiracy theorist with the name Frank, and Pam the medium and Kevin the next president and – at this point Castiel had finally caught on to the fact that Dean was messing with him.
Winchester scrunches his nose up, and Castiel finds similar expressions of disbelief on the others’ faces. “He not know that you’re, like, out of action?”
“Yeah, sure.” Benny raised an eyebrow, indicating that he’d been teasing. “'Seen what you can do, remember? Seemed much more steadfast in good ol’ Purgatory is all I’m saying.” He shrugged. “Look you don’t have to tell me. The babysitting’s what I called the chief for.”
He feels Cas’ glare on him, hot and vengeful. “I can drive,” he repeats, and his tone allows no argument.
(And it is indeed just the head of a lion, Dean observes, and not the whole animal, which makes it all even weirder.)
It’s a transparent lie, but it works because Dean’s eyes are wide when they turn to ogle Cas‘ profile. “You didn’t!”
When Cas tilts his head and makes to demand for a clarification, Jody interrupts. “Okay, guys, how about we start from the beginning.” She takes a deep breath as if to steel herself for the conversation that follows.
It hit him as a wave. The evidence of human fragility, multiplied by two. Castiel welcomed it into him, soaked himself in it, his veins burning hot with it and his eyes filling with tears.
The paper bag lands on Cas’ lap while Winchester plops himself down on a nearby chair. Castiel stares at him owlishly, unable to believe his own eyes.
At that, somehow, the whole room is rendered silent as though everyone is holding their collective breath.
All at once, the rush of the feathers stills completely, and Castiel turns to blink owlishly at him. “What?”
Dean’s spotted him already when Cas walks up to him, and he’s watching him approach with an unreadable expression on his face. His feet seem glued to the spot.
Crowley once said – in an attempt to remind him of their ‘summer of love’, how Sam so hilariously put it – that the angel was never gonna be enough to satisfy him.
“Mom? Dad?” Castiel called out, heading into the kitchen, then poking his head through the open doorway of the master suite just beyond. His mother’s purse lay on the bed, as though she’d been rummaging through it and tossed it aside, but the room was otherwise empty. He went back out into the hallway, checking the front parlor and Mom’s sewing room before finally heading toward Dad’s office. The door was closed, and years of ingrained habit had him knocking before he threw open the door.
“An amicable parting of ways,” Castiel finished. He looked up from the paint spots,  a small, rueful smile flickering briefly. “It turns out that we were better off as friends after all.”
“Road,” Dean decided, pulling his gun free from his thigh holster. “I have no idea how to gallop or whatever, but let’s figure it out fast.”
Perhaps Dean should have found it a greater consolation than he did, being let down so gently yet clearly. “I totally get that,” he responded, barely hearing his own words. “Hey, I’m going to get myself a beer. You…uh, you probably don’t want one. Because you’re working. Which…yeah.” He was rambling, but he didn’t care. It wasn’t as though Castiel didn’t know the reason for it, or that he wouldn’t be sensitive about that, too.
Dean shrugged. “No alligator I’ve ever seen, but I swear, that’s what the whole shape kind of looks like to me, with the big long jaw and all those…really frigging sharp teeth. An alligator with crazy long legs that bend backward like a dog’s.”
“Clearly, there was no way I was ever going to be able to deliver the bag to Benton. Probably he was killed, anyway, and it doesn’t matter. Hell, maybe he was even Patient Zero, like they used to talk about in zombie flicks. I have no idea why I’m still carrying the thing around. Maybe I just feel guilty. If I’d just gone right away when Dad said, without demanding that he start explaining, he’d still be alive. Mom might be alive. It’s my fault.”
“I’m sure it will,” Castiel affirmed. “I have to admit, though, that I’ve enjoyed at least one aspect of our enforced solitude. I’ve had you all to myself, storytime parents aside. I’ll miss that.”
Donna was blushing, but her grin was as bright as ever. “Doc’s still checking him over, making sure he doesn’t need quarantined, but he seemed healthy enough to me, once he realized I wasn’t gonna bite him and he let me get closer. I figure he’ll be out soon enough, and you can check his
“An American way of looking at things, perhaps,” Castiel had mused dryly. His voice, deep and rough over the phone lines, had been a huge shock to Dean the first time they’d spoken on the phone; he’d been expecting something much more delicate from a “Principal Records Specialist.” “Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps, is it?”
“South border, Bobby!” Sam interrupted, flinging a hand toward the tops of some trees on the east side of the highway.
“Huh.” Dean considered that for a moment, feeling unsettled. “Well, he was probably trying to compensate for missing any signs that I’m into guys as well as chicks. Maybe he was just focused on that, trying not to screw up any more than he thinks he already has.”
His eyebrows flew upward. “I only showed Meg,” he said with surprise, “and that was out in the parking lot, before we even made it into the building today. Seriously, do you have a network of spies or something?” Pulling his phone from his pocket, Dean swiped to unlock it and pull up his photo album. Mrs. Tran plucked it from his hands to scroll through the stored images.
In the distance, Dean was starting to hear faint noises of approaching footsteps and murmuring voices. If it came down to a fight, with Castiel sitting there looking poleaxed and him with just a handful of foot-long needles for weapons, Dean didn’t like their odds of success.
examining himself in profile, from his reflection in the bedroom window, poking at his gut and wondering whether a jog in the morning a couple times a week would actually kill him or just make him wish he was dead.
Cursing, Dean pounded down the hall in the opposite direction, hearing shouts and rushing footsteps behind him. His mind was racing as fast as his legs, hoping wildly that these other angels in Castiel’s dream were just placeholder figures who didn’t actually have real mojo of their own. Seeing one door slightly ajar down a side corridor, he lunged through it, then ducked into the shadow behind the door.
“Thank you for coming. Seems my bitch is in heat,” Castiel says, adjusting the vibrator and turning it up higher. Princess cries out, releasing a desperate moan. “She needs a good breeding.”
He tucks the rope under each cheek and around his thighs, leaving a knot in the rope just behind his balls. He pulls up ever so gently and moans at the stimulation. Its overwhelming and he can’t help but imagine it’s his dom pulling his strings. He ties off the loose ends and relaxes out his muscles into the firm hold of the rope. It feels great as he settles down gingerly on the mattress, letting his eyes fall closed, one hand wrapped around his half hard cock lazily stroking.
“It’s gonna be dangerous, you know. This demon, it…well, it’s killed a lot of people. We're gonna do whatever we have to do to end it. But if killing this demon means losing the people I care most about then it can fuck off for all I care, okay? Nothing is more important to me than you staying safe, than Sam staying safe.” He rested his chin on the top of Castiel’s head. “If we're gonna do this, I need you to trust me, okay? Let me keep you safe, as safe as I can.”
Castiel slides into an armchair, scrubbing a hand over his face, feeling dejected. “What am I supposed to do here? The harder I push, the more he lashes out. But I’m afraid if I don’t keep trying, he’s going to just…”
Dean feels frozen to the floor, feet made of lead and stomach twisting. He knew his dad would be home, and that he needed to talk to him…but faced with it, he’s filled with nothing but dread.
He turns to leave but Castiel pulls him by the shoulder, Dean spinning back around quickly. “It’s fine, Dean. I’m sorry we didn’t discuss a cover story more thoroughly beforehand, but I’m fine with keeping things vague for the staff.” A pain shoots through his temple and winces, rubbing a hand across his forehead. “As for your appearance here, in my bedroom, did Missouri not mention that the west wing normally isn’t open to staff?”
“I agree. Let’s get you comfy.” Castiel helps him to lie down on the couch, his head resting on a pillow in Castiel’s lap. The TV turns on and he smiles when he sees it’s an old Scooby-Doo episode. He doesn’t even make it to the “meddling kids” line before he’s fallen fast asleep.
“Oh, right.” Dean divides up the scrambled eggs onto two plates, then does the same for the finished bacon. “Second of all, we both know that you, plus this old-ass stove, equals instant cabin fire.”
“Okay, so say the system gets rigged and it actually says I am good enough a match for you. Then what? Do we live here in the facility? Do we move back to my home? Do we just start out dating, but god, that would feel weird seeing as you already fuck my brains out on a regular basis.” He glances up to see a small, lust-filled smile on Castiel’s face.
He spears his tongue inside sloppily, loosening up the tight ring of muscle, imagining his cock being there instead. He hadn’t planned on fucking his sub tonight, not during public play, but at this moment nothing sounds better. He pulls away, gasping for air.
“Sure, just like I bet his slick tastes like sprinkles and whipped cream,” Lucifer snaps sarcastically. “Is he your little omega unicorn, Cassie? Bet he can get away with anything.”
“Things are going well with my new dom, like really well,” and fuck is it ever, he’s never felt so turned on in his life. “Do relationships ever work out with other club members?”
Castiel’s mouth hangs open in surprise. He’s irritated by Dean’s insistency, his level-headed bossiness, but if he’s being honest he’s also a little turned on. “Give me my phone. Your brother is under my protection, and I need to make that crystal clear.”
Dean swallows hard, keeping his face as neutral as he can. “Sam, you're presenting right now. You're feeling so hot and disoriented because you're going into heat.”
“See if she’ll come first thing in the morning. That’ll give you time to take a shower and get some rest.”
He looks rightfully confused, so Castiel grabs a slip of folded paper from his portfolio and slides into the man’s palm. “You may not have noticed, but our weather pattern for the next two weeks is quite…varied. Boston in the spring is unpredictable. So every night in bed, or every morning in the shower, whenever and wherever you have the urge to come, check the temperature outside. I’ve written down instructions for you.”
“Impala, and no scat or watersports, no blood, condoms are a must, and no permanent damage. Those are the big ones anyway,” he had his answer ready and he is pretty open to trying most things.
Dean licks his lips, eyes still closed—not daring to open them, to believe that this has not all just been a fever dream. But he can taste his alpha on his tongue and feel his warmth against his cool, damp skin. He’s never felt so scared and so safe in his entire life. Ragged breaths are shared between them, and when he finally opens his eyes, he feels Castiel lift his head away. Fierce and pained blue eyes are staring back at him, and Castiel’s hand reaches up to cradle his face. Dean leans into the touch, reveling in it. Castiel’s thumb brushes over his lower lip, and Dean’s mouth easily parts in offering. He thinks at that moment there is nothing he wouldn’t give to him.
Dean’s mind stops whirling and he feels his heart thump in his chest. He’d hoped this might happen, even prepared a little for it, feeling all too aware of the silk slide under his jeans. He’d checked up on Castiel too, talked with Meg and few others in the community. He was a good dom, practiced safe play. Dean looks at the cool, blue eyes watching him, waiting to see what he does. He knows he can walk away at any time but he also thinks this man could deconstruct him just the way he needs.
"Oh come on, not you too. Balthazar hates that movie.  Well he really hates the Celine Dion song and therefore the movie."
A finger under his chin makes him startle, but he turns to look across the seat at the warm, hungry eyes taking him in. “Dean.” Castiel says his name almost reverently. “You ready to do this?”
We know that chapter was rough, we wish we could have held all your hands through it. My coauthor and I have been writing literally around the clock so as not to make you guys wait too long for the next chapter. We are still working toward our happy ending that we do promise you, the boys just need to find their way there. Sending you all love and hugs.
When ‘67 doesn’t respond right away, Castiel has no choice but to engage with his brother. He tries to consider Gabriel’s question, but the only image that returns to his mind is…his sub from earlier. He had been watching and wanting that gorgeous man for longer than he’d care to admit. Everything about him had captivated Castiel since the moment their eyes had met across the bar. If they had been anywhere but the Black & Blue Club at the time, he would have approached the handsome stranger, maybe even placed a hand in the curve of his back as he whispered, “What are you drinking, handsome?” He can imagine the man shivering at the words, turned on by the command in Castiel’s voice, and it’s enough to make him wish he
“No, Master.” His head is hanging down now, eyes cast down, which is a good start…but Castiel wants him whimpering. He debates on asking his sub to keep track of the number of hits, but decides the anticipation of not knowing his dom’s end goal will keep him jittery and tense. Plus, though this is serving as somewhat of a punishment, he knows his sub absolutely
“There we are. Let's get you all dried off and dressed for me.” Castiel’s voice is warm as silk and Dean just nods in agreement again. The collar is fastened back on, and he watches with a surprising lack of concern as Castiel slides his gold cock cage back on. He doesn’t need any prep for the gold plug, either (not that tail…oh my god…he wore a tail!). It slips right back into place.
“Well, come in, it’s cold out there.” Mrs. Tran steps back and both men slip inside so she can shut the door behind them. “Would you like some tea?”
“I think it's a good idea, Dean, just to be done with the whole thing. You never should have had to sell your contract in the first place. Maybe now we can set it right.” Sam juts out his chin and puts a steadying hand on his brother. Dean looks at those hazel eyes, simply awed at the man Sam is becoming.
“Listen, Cassie,” Gabriel says, his voice softer than it’s been in a long time, “I know you live, eat, and breathe this stuff. You basically grew up in the weird, isolated womb of Purgatory. But you have to know that not everyone has such blind faith in those registry results, right? Hell, most people don’t even have access to it because of the cost. Plenty of people just meet the good ol’ fashion way and figure out through trial and error if they’re an okay match.”
“Cool. The guy can’t be half bad if he leant you his coat,” Sam gives him a side grin, “I’m heading to bed, I have a calculus test in the morning.”
“Alfie, did you find the whip?” Castiel tries to clear his head of Dean, realizing he’s giving a lackluster performance and hoping the presence of the whip will help ground him. Even so, his dick softens just a little when he remembers who he’s thrusting into. Or more accurately, who he’s
The first few days with Castiel were strange to say the least. Dean struggled to adapt to the new normal, though he really was trying. Castiel was the biggest riddle Dean had ever encountered. He was family to his Master, and the way he talked with Nick you would assume he held the same feelings about slaves. But when they were alone he was… different. He was compassionate and kind and sympathetic and the first person that had seen and treated Dean like a person in over a year.
“What do you want from me anyway?” he shoots back, hoping they can stop dancing around the subject and get down to it. He feels the thumb on his knee start to rub back and forth over his knee cap. He’d almost forgotten the hand was there. It somehow settles him and his muscles unwind a little. He lets out a shaky breath, looking back up into those blue eyes.
Castiel glances at him with a raised brow. “There’s no tub. You should be able to soak.” He can hear the frustration in Cas’ voice and feels a twinge of guilt that they are stuck in the cabin for the duration of his heat.
Dean had never been so happy when Sam suggested they get out of the house Saturday. He’d been moping around the house all week, feeling downright sorry for himself. He tried hard not to let Castiel see how upset he was by the rejection, but judging by the constant look of pity in the alpha’s eyes, he hadn’t done a great job of it. He really had no one to blame but himself—Cas is so out of his league. A small amount of attraction couldn’t make Castiel actually want him. For just a minute though, by the candlelight, he’d thought he’d seen something more in Castiel’s eyes. A flicker of intense desire that stirred something deep in Dean’s chest. Unfortunately, the moment had passed and Castiel had made his interest—or lack thereof—very clear. By Saturday, he just needed some time away from those scrutinizing blue eyes to clear his head.
“How dare you,” Castiel growls at him, eyes growing dark. Dean lifts his face in shock at the tone as his alpha storms toward him. “Don’t you ever say such a thing, you foolish, stubborn man. How dare you think that's all your worth? How could you possibly think that you aren’t everything to me? That I wouldn’t give up everything for you?” The air swirls with the thick, possessive scent of his alpha and Dean’s inner omega stirs in his chest.
Final thank you to TheArcaneRaven for inspiring this fic and setting me off on this journey, hope it was all you wanted <3.
“Ay, there’s the wee boy now,” she says in a charming voice, noticing Dean passed out in Castiel’s arms, “perhaps we won’t have to sue you and your facility for abuse, neglect, assault, battery, and medical malpractice…though I have to admit it
still won. He imagines the pain Castiel felt with Dean gone all those weeks. How much he must have been hurting while Dean figured his shit out. Cas waited for him, and he never gave up on Dean either. Suddenly the sweatshirt Castiel leant him makes a lot more sense. He must have known that the t-shirt's scent was soothing to him and wanted Dean to have that, too.
Dean’s gaze is intense, peering into him as if he’s trying to solve a puzzle. “You had another nightmare, huh?”
“Easy there,” Castiel cooes and holds firm as the horse begins to settle a bit. He eventually breaks to a walk and lets the rein out so the horse can stretch. “Hello, Dean,” Castiel calls, riding over to him.
He hands Dean a small stack of papers and he pulls away, out of Roman’s grasp, eyes scanning down the pages. So far, he’d managed not to have to do this. Few family alphas turned the papers over to the omega when they came of age. Most just sold their contract to the highest bidding alpha. There were some more progressive families who signed contracts over to the omega themselves, just like his dad had done on his eighteenth birthday. How was that the same man standing behind him now?
“So good, baby, fuck me hard,” he pleads, gasping when he feels two fingers sink into him with a wet sound. “Ah, fuck,” Dean groans reaching forward to grab the edge of the desk for leverage.
Okay, here it is, a rite of passage…the first TCB/CB cliffhanger of this fic! Haha. Come share your feelings in the comments.
He takes that warm fuzzy feeling with him when he retreats back to his desk. He spends the rest of the morning sorting emails and cleaning up files before sending them to Cas. He’s glad the alpha keeps his door open so he can catch glimpses of him while he works. Being close to Cas has him feeling more at ease, even with his looming plans for the afternoon. He wants to try and get the alpha alone so he can get a look at what’s under that suit and tie.
“They can stay if they want,” he says with a shrug, like it's no big deal…even if it makes him shift in his bed a bit.
“Well, tough shit. Go again.” Dean sighs, raising himself up and straddling Castiel’s thigh. The weight of him feels amazing, solid and enticing, and he leans in close. “I’ll pick for you then. Truth,” he whispers decisively. “Cas, is there a reason you’re scared to have sex with me?”
“Oh.” The sub sounds almost pouty about this revelation, as if he’s pissed off at his past-self for setting such a rule, and Castiel smiles and runs a hand through his hair. “Well, maybe there are non-visible places you can leave them…”
“Yes, now, Dean. It can’t keep going like this.” Sam sighs, dropping heavily into the chair next to him. Dean seriously considers bolting back to his room, but Sam will only follow him.
“I should go now,” Castiel announces, looking at Gabriel and Becky. Pam nods her approval beside him.
“I’ve just been more and more stressed lately. I work long hours at my job, and even with overtime it barely covers the bills. I’m taking care of my brother, who is still in school, and my dad, he…well, he’s not around and when he is… It's just a lot of weight on my shoulders sometimes.” He bites his lower lip, feeling embarrassed with how much he just said. He hasn’t even been here five minutes.
Shuffling back into the manor, holding hands and grinning excitedly, Dean and Castiel tiptoe through the kitchen. They had stripped outside as much as they could, leaving behind their soggy shoes and socks, letting their slacks and button-ups air-dry over a lounge chair. Castiel had been half-tempted to ask Dean to keep that wet, white shirt on—it was skin tight, obscenely sexy, his boyfriend's nipples pointed and perky…visible through the soaking fabric. But then Dean had shivered and his protective instincts kicked in, helping Dean shred his drenched layers and rubbing his bare arms for warmth.
“Turn right up ahead,” Dean instructs as they come closer to the location of Sam’s party. Castiel follows dutifully, even though his GPS is taking him a different way. When the automatic voice resets, it tells him he’s added an extra mile to his drive. “Taking the scenic route?”
Castiel smiles, feeling like a weight has been lifted off him. Pleasing a sub brings him an intense feeling of satisfaction, and he adjusts a little in his seat, his erection growing uncomfortable against his zipper.
dominating this beautiful sub. But of course, someone else will. Castiel is too busy to take on a full-time sub, especially one in need of such constant care.
“That’s what I call a successful intervention,” Gabriel says, standing up and opening the office door. Castiel begins to pack up his briefcase, but then decides against it, leaving his laptop and notes on the desk. He’ll email Victor from his phone once he’s in Sioux Falls. Tessa seems shocked to see him—not only leaving voluntarily before seven o’clock, but without his briefcase in tow.
“That means a lot to me,” Dean tries to give her a grateful smile. He looks up again at the mantle and sees a picture of a young Kevin grinning holding up a hotdog with ketchup on his face. It sits right beside his framed flag from his funeral, which Dean had been too injured to attend. “Man that kid liked hot dogs,” he chuckles.
“Oh, uh…sorry. Thought you were Sammy,” he answers, getting his thumb stuck in the tie and tugging at it like an idiot.
“Morning boys!” he hollers at the horses. Only Decaf lifts his head at the sound of his voice but is quick to return to his grass. He shakes his head and makes his way down the drive. He can see dust kicking up from the arena and wonders who is riding.
His sub moans with excitement and takes Castiel fully into the hot wet heat of his mouth, and as astounding as the sucking motions feels, Castiel reaches for the man’s hair and tugs him off roughly.
“It’s my pleasure. But before we begin, I should remind you that you cannot come without permission. For this particular scene, however, you have my permission to come…but only
He frowns but turns to make the latte. He hasn’t seen Cas yet this morning but they had planned to meet up that evening. He even got Benny to cover him at the Roadhouse. He needs the money but with Cas leaving soon he figures he can stand to miss a shift or two. He hands the coffee over silently, seeing as if he opens his mouth something less than polite will topple out.
He snatches the ticket from the woman and grabs Sam’s sleeve, dragging him inside. Maybe if they move fast enough they can get in the theater without having to see Castiel and Inias again. He all but drags a very bewildered Sam through the groups of people and he sees an open concessions vendor, beelining it to the candy case.
He whimpers as he wraps a hand around himself and instantly knows it’s not enough. He feels the slick between his cheeks and he quickly lays down in the tub, water pelting him as he spreads his legs. He sinks two fingers into himself in a harsh, burning push. It’s slick, but the muscles are tight—and god, it feels amazing.
“That’s…good to know,” Dean mumbles, eyes glazing over a little. Castiel hands travel up Dean’s thighs, kneading the tight muscles there. He works his way up, holding Dean’s hips before slipping a hand under his flannel and feeling the hot silky skin of his back. They stare at each other beyond a socially acceptable amount of time before Dean surges forward, crashing their lips together, all teeth and tongue and desperation. Castiel parts his lips, inviting Dean in, enjoying the feeling of his omega seeking his own pleasure. Just as he’s starting to feel his own cock stir, the sound of the front door opening and closing makes them freeze.
Castiel’s eyes glisten as he smiles at him, and Dean would tease him if not for the tears blurring his own vision. He’s not alone anymore, and neither is Cas. They found their family, found their home in each other, and no one can ever take that from them…
“If no one hurt you, then why are you wearing blockers?” Castiel says, voice beginning to shake. Someone hurt Dean, maybe several someones, and the rage he feels now makes his heart pound in his chest. “I thought they gave you your own cell!”
Castiel feels a spike of adrenaline course through him. It’s been forever since he’s been with a submissive this resistant, this inherently bratty. He generally dominates the upcoming graduates from the facility, to both ensure they’ve been properly trained and to fulfill his own intense, biological urges. Dean’s unyielding attitude is unusual, both angering him and making his cock twitch with interest. It’s been a long time,
He looks around the room, a handful of faces seemingly skeptical. Crowley is pointedly ignoring his gaze, which he’s thankful for. He takes a deep breath and plows on, piling on the lies—anything to keep Dean safe.
“So gorgeous for me, my love,” he whispers, thinking Dean might be asleep—but then Dean clenches down on his cock again, somehow forcing
Dean blinks hard when he pulls back. Shifting uncomfortably, he feels a plug in his ass and something fluffy there. He’s
CB here bringing you this monster of a chapter. I know we're posting a bit behind schedule, but we simply couldn't stop writing. We are thinking there are maybe two more chapters after this (I know, insert tears). We will try and post as quick as we can, but we may not be able to stick to a strict posting schedule. Just know we are working to bring this to a sexy, sweet, and satisfying end.
He also has several texts from Bobby and two voicemails he doesn’t want to answer. He was hoping to put off talking to him about all this, knowing Bobby would have tried to fix the situation even if it bankrupted him. He wonders if his dad called him, but then he remembers they aren’t on speaking terms at the moment. Must have been Sam who ratted him out. He sends a quick text to ease Bobby’s mind, telling him he’s fine and he’ll call him later. Not a phone call…he’s sure as shit gonna get called an “idjit” at least twice before he gets a word in.
“No, dear boy, we have a lot to get through. Now I hope you have your signing arm ready?” She pulls out a stack of papers from her bag, laying them out on the table before him along with two black pens.
“Sam!” she runs and nearly tackles Sam where he’s sitting at the table. Dean stands back a step as Sam hauls them both to their feet, offering to take her bag for her. She turns then and looks at Dean and suddenly skinny arms are wrapped around his rib cage and pulling into a tight hug. He manages to suppress the hiss of pain and after a second of shock he hugs her back. “Thanks, Dean,” she whispers to him as she pulls away.
Dean snarls, batting the hand away as Roman jumps back laughing, looking far too pleased with himself.
“Dean,” Castiel gets his attention with a squeeze to his knee. “This is going to be a really fucking hard thing...but you can do hard things.”
“Letting loose a little.” He winks flirtily, giving Castiel’s outfit a once over. “And rockin’ the hell out of that monkey suit.”
“Shower I can do.” Castiel lifts him to his wobbly feet, taking a few tissues to wipe him down before pulling up his pants for him. Dean looks at the mess on the desk and some on the floor and scowls.
Dean groans as he slowly begins to orient himself to his surroundings. He wiggles his toes and fingers, glad to see they still move. He blinks his eyes open, despite the pounding sensation in his head. He takes in the hospital bed, gown, and the woman in scrubs reading a clipboard by his feet.
“Is that surprising?” Castiel asks, unable to prevent himself from probing even as his client is in the process of leaving. “That you’ve enjoyed talking with me, I mean.”
Castiel grips his mug so tightly, he wonders if it’s possible to break the ceramic. He swallows a dry lump in his throat and looks away, trying his best to stay professional in the face of this impossible situation.
?” Dean reads dubiously, shaking his head with a laugh as he slips the shirt on. “No way this is mine. Might as well put on a ‘we just fucked’ t-shirt.”
“She has a blog for her favorite TV show. I don’t really even know what a blog is, but it makes her happy,” he says with shrugs. He clears his throat, then says, “Dean, may I be blunt for a moment?”
“Oh, are you referencing that absurd contract?” Castiel schools his expression. “You’ll be waiting a long time, I’m afraid. I have no interest in the man.”
Castiel quickly unties the rope from his chest to his legs and then the rope holding him up and guides him back to sitting on his heels while Cas is kneeling behind him. He settles back into the hold, letting out little breathy gasps as the vibration from the plug shifts, hitting his prostate.
John stirs more quickly then, his eyes opening. His feet knock over the empty beers and Bobby swears under his breath. A moment later there’s a creak at the top of the stairs, and Bobby mutters, “Well, he
Castiel holds a finger up to his lips gesturing for Dean to be quiet, and Dean nods, placing the coffee on the desk. “I told you, Michael, the molds failed, so we are planning to do a test batch on Saturday so we can meet the Monday validation schedule. Things are still on track.” Dean moves to step out but Castiel steps forward, halting him with a hand on his arm. His fingers are cold, and the firm grip sends a shiver through him.
funny.” She shakes her head, blonde curls rustling behind her back. Castiel marvels, not for the first time, that someone so attractive can be so hideous.
Castiel, though he doesn’t have a praise kink, still enjoys being complimented. “Good. I want to make you feel good, Dean. I want to make you scream my name. I want to ruin you for anyone else.”
Posting a day early because I want something good for today and posting always makes me feel good. Now I know I am taking my time getting to the smut with this fic but bear with me, its in the next chapter and the ground work needs to get laid before the boys can get laid (apology for the dad joke). As always I love to hear from you and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. If you don't wanna leave a comment you can email me too at the address below.
“Okay you guys are good to head home now, Amy I’ll be by to check on you next week and you can call me anytime,” Missouri gives the girl a warm smile.
“To Dean,” Castiel says evenly, feeling Dean shift beside him, their arms brushing. Ellen and Jo echo him, but Dean just turns bright pink and takes a long swig of his mug. Everyone comes up from their drink with a rough cough except for Dean, which Castiel finds curious. He guesses that Dean’s likely been drinking since a very early age.
“Fuck, that hike is no joke,” Dean huffs, putting his hands on his knees and catching his breath. He looks up to see Castiel standing near a cliff’s edge, backpack by his feet and camera raised. Dean stands drooping his own bag and watches Castiel for a second—his hair shines in the diminishing light of the afternoon. He looks even more gorgeous now than when they were young, and that's saying something.
Castiel chuckles and rolls his eyes. Sometimes he thinks 67 is flirting with him, but based on his personality, he thinks his friend is just flirty by nature.
“No!” She folded her arms across her chest, and color rose alarmingly in her cheeks. “I’m not going up the mountain! I want to go to the lake!”
Dean glowered. “Yeah, it’s real entertaining, how you’re making him relive all his worst memories, now that you mention it. Was I not supposed to pick up on that? It wasn’t subtle.”
And right then, with a flash of sick clarity, Dean knew exactly what the “running theme” was that the Empty had mocked him for not being able to see.
Thus resolved, Dean stood on the patio by the back door, waiting as the contractor approached. “Okay, can we start over and try this again?” he asked, holding out a hand. “I’m Dean Winchester, the homeowner.”
They quickly swept all the costumes they could find into their bags, then topped them with the math and history books that had been the primary reason their mission request had been approved. The brothers were much slower as they moved out, but their grins were irrepressible. Dean felt lighter than he had in ages, imagining the looks on the children’s faces when they saw the outfits. Too many of those kids were scarily serious, staring somberly at the playground instead of running and giggling.
Thank god, the floor in this room was wood, not concrete. Not even unfinished subfloor—real, honest to God, hardwood. It was about time for a pleasant surprise, he’d figured, and he was definitely feeling more positive about this whole venture now that there was at least a plan in place. The strong odors of the cleaning solutions Castiel had sprayed and sponged over the basement wall and the concrete in the office were wafting through the entire house, and it smelled like progress.
” Dean said, pointing firmly at the nail gun. “What the hell, man? ‘Professional Nailer’? With a dial to adjust ‘driving power’? I deserve a damn medal.”
“Shut up.” He still stood by that argument. “And who said anything about running? Weights are a thing, Sam.” A thing about which he had only passing familiarity, but he didn’t need to give details about his imaginary workout session with his imaginary boyfriend.
; that was for sure. The oily, molten face that snarled at him from less than a foot away was obviously not the creature’s own, but it was nothing like the way a demon or angel wore a meatsuit. The biggest difference between them was that the Entity apparently couldn’t decide what sort of image it wanted to wear, and it had infinite possibilities from which to choose. Dean suspected it was searching for the form most likely to unnerve him. The face shifted wildly, flashing from male to female to monstrosity and back again, and the rest of the body almost shimmered with the speed at which it changed. The only constant factor was the pure loathing in its eyes.
“Castiel, please, calm down,” she said, and he realized he was almost hyperventilating. “I’ve already checked your blood.”
“Okay, fine, you tease. Keep it in your pants and get back to turning this shack into a house,” Dean said, throwing his hands in the air goodnaturedly. Taking a few steps backward, he plopped down on top of a packing crate and crossed his legs at the ankle.
Jimmy gestured toward the hair above his left temple. “As I was saying,” he sighed, and they all laughed.
“I’m not a children’s librarian,” Castiel lamented. “I’m capable of doing this, but I don’t even have any picture books here at home, and Naomi was very firm about the building doors remaining closed to us, so I can’t go grab any.”
“Hmmm?” Castiel glanced over his shoulder without stopping the steady feathering movements of his drywall knife.
Obliging both the drink order and the request for explanation, Balthazar said, “I have an acquaintance who would be quite capable of demonstrating for your neighbor both your unhappiness and your enjoyment of a good joke.” Dean’s raised eyebrow and thoughtful expression was sufficiently encouraging for Balthazar to explain his idea.
“And, I mean, I do have plans for something of my own, someday,” Castiel continued. “I just have never reached the point where I’ve been able to say, definitively, that I know where I can see myself in ten years. Every time I’ve tried, there’s been something in the way—something that has me saying ‘not yet.’”
“It’s my turn,” he said, bending over and bracing himself with arms on either side of Dean’s head. He kissed Dean deeply, claiming his mouth and stealing his breath until Dean felt light-headed. Breaking the kiss, Castiel began slowly but inexorably working his way downward, humming and moaning as though he’d never tasted anything better on his tongue.
“No,” both Sam and Billie said in firm unison. When Sam glanced back at Billie, startled, she rolled her eyes at him.
“You’d think, wouldn’t you?” Dean muttered to himself, shaking his head at the memory of his first inspection fiasco, then waving a dismissive hand when Castiel made a questioning sound. “Good, then. We’re on the same page,” he said more clearly. “This door leads to the kitchen, and we can start there.”
The last box was smaller than his fist, and it would have been easily missed under the larger pile of gifts. That is, it would have been missed had it been there from the start, and had Dean not, in fact, slipped it into the mix early on in the happy confusion of the unwrapping. Now he palmed it, tossing it lightly into the air. “This one’s making me nervous,” he said. “Scary things come in small packages, you know. Here, Cas, why don’t you take a guess about it before the paper comes off?”
By the time he was clambering out of the driver’s seat—harder to do with an out-of-commission left hand than he had anticipated before getting hurt—and climbing the porch steps, he’d changed his mind a dozen times about what he was going to do or whether to do anything at all. As he reached for the doorknob, clumsily trying to support his messenger bag under his left arm, the door was suddenly opened from the other side.
The earnest plea in Castiel’s wide blue eyes had Dean weakening, despite his reluctance. “How many of these do we have to do?” he asked, and Castiel beamed.
“I’m aware of the situation, Castiel,” Dad interrupted tersely, examining something held in his hands. Outside, one of the neighbor’s dogs punctuated the sentiment with a series of snarling barks that ended in a piercing whine.
“Shut up, I’m…” It was impossible. The signals from the camp’s repeaters kept getting amplified over the antenna, and the voice he really wanted to hear sounded quieter than usual. Maybe somewhere to the south?
Dean blinked as Castiel took a large step forward to abruptly place himself deep inside Dean’s personal space. The first thought to flash through his brain was one of mild surprise:
“…and then it doesn’t really matter, because no way am I getting authorization to take a vehicle more than a day’s trip out for this,” Dean muttered.
Sam chuckled, and they stooped to lift the shelves and carry them the rest of the way to Sam’s waiting truck.
“Claire, that’s enough,” Amelia said sternly. “We do not yell at Daddy, and we don’t throw tantrums.”
“Hey!” Castiel heard the shout from behind him, and he knew he was about to die. Suddenly, he was full of rage. All this time, all the tragedy and death and terror and loss, and he was going to be killed by a couple of…of common
Now that he was taking stock of the situation, Castiel slowly became aware of muffled voices, maybe in the next room. He opened his eyes just a crack, blinking in the brightness of sunlight slanting in through the old-fashioned blinds before shutting them again. He was apparently in some sort of medical clinic, the blood pressure cuff and the jars of cotton balls and other paraphernalia on the counter identifying it as such. The voice he had been hearing belonged to women, he determined, and they were arguing. He couldn’t quite make out everything they were saying, but he tried his best.
“That is the last time I listen to you!” Dean’s voice reached Balthazar before he’d even turned around to greet the patron entering the bar. At the sound of the angry words, Balthazar groaned to himself and took his time turning around, forcing a cheerful smile. The smattering of other patrons seated around the bar made no effort to hide their interest in the blossoming confrontation.
No, that wasn’t fair. Sam had a real right to be upset, didn’t he? Dean was, after all, the one who was at fault, and he deserved every bit of the hurt anger coming his way. He bit his lip at the thought of the look on Sam’s face when he found out the truth.
“I don’t suppose there are,” replied the soon-to-be-homeowner, following along behind. Dean wasn’t paying much attention to the prattling aimed in his direction; he had been too busy allowing his eyes to wander around the dusty rooms with peeling paint, making plans and visualizing a very different house in his future. Unimpressed, Miss Talbot (“Please, call me Bela,” she’d said with a toss of her hair and a coy tilt of her chin; flirting seemed to be one of her primary sales techniques) sniffed at his obvious distraction. She turned toward a document-covered temporary folding table with far less swing to her hips than she’d exhibited during most of the closing walk-through.
Mourning all those sweet, sweet scenarios-that-never-happened, Cas lets out an exaggerated, drawn-out, long-suffering groan.
He’s be more relieved if that weren’t the exact same time when Winchester’s whole entourage pays him a visit.
Once they’ve closed the door behind them, the anticipation of the first night they’ll spend together as a couple hits Dean unabatedly. As he attempts to deal with the roller coaster in his head, Dean can barely do more than stand there and stare.
Dean’s loose and lax in more than one way once Cas finally gets this show on the road. It feels like forever until Dean has taken all of him, it always does. His asshole deserves a goddamn award just for that.
“Never mind,” he says. “Point is: You’re showing me a side of yourself you haven’t dared to show me ever before, that’s a huge ego boost for me! And look at me, dude, I love what you got! The wings, the whiskers – the whole nine. So there’s the ego boost for you. It’s a win–win.”
His head begins to throb again and he lifts a hand towards his temple in a desperate attempt to alleviate the pain through physical pressure and sheer force of will.
“What?” Dean can only ask, because drunk Cas turns out to be even more complicated than regular, sober Cas.
When he lifts his eyes to meet Dean’s again, there’s yet another unreadable expression on Dean’s face, and it nags at him that he can’t decipher this unspoken language broadcasted by the man he knows best in the world. Dean’s looking at him like… like he doesn’t understand him either.
Dean's grin turns soft. “Yeah.” His gaze is directed down to his shoes when he drops Cas' hand, and the insecurity he suddenly emanates evokes the urge in Cas to reach out again. But then he spots something over Dean's shoulder and he doesn't catch what Dean says next.
“It’s not actually a lion,” corrects Cas helpfully. “It’s… well, to be truthful, its Enochian name wouldn’t be perceptible by your ears, so there is not much point in lecturing you about it. At any rate, the
Cas orders apple pie to-go and hands it to Dean. Dean hands him the car keys in return. As they leave the diner, Cas hooks an arm under Dean’s and rests his head on his shoulder briefly.
Dean steers Baby to the side and jams on the brakes so hard, they’re both catapulted forwards before the seat belt throws them back into the seat. Behind them, someone yells obscenities and a car honks angrily as it passes them.
Through the litany of curses he internally hurls towards Dean, he hears a series of quick little steps, and the turn of pages.
Only when the burger is placed in front of him and he’s taken a sip from his glass does he break the silence. “So, you know where to go now?”
Soon, his Grace would work on defeating the foreign matter, and in the meantime, it would put his consciousness into a sleep-like state, or as sleep-like as Castiel could get fully powered.
At least Cas gets what he wanted after that because the room is covered in silence. The discrete shuffling of fabric tells him that the brothers are probably doing this nonverbal conversation thing that Castiel only knows in theory.
,” he gasps out, and he would not beg in the face of Raphael’s wrath, under Naomi’s meddling hands or Lucifer’s taunting but he begs now.
Dean seems to agree, because once all eyes land on him with an expectation that’s almost palpable, his Adam’s apple bops and he lifts a hand to rub at the back of his neck in an awkward motion. “Uhh…” He plasters on a grin that might fool strangers but certainly not anyone in this room.
Sarah smirks at the surprise on Sam's face. “What? You think we can't have our fun without you, Sam?”
He thanks her profusely, distracted with his thoughts full of Castiel as he gets dressed and meets Sam in the waiting room. His brother is unusually quiet, and Dean figures he got an earful about omega biology from his doctor’s visit. He fills their prescriptions and makes the drive back up the windy mountain toward the cabin.
“Follow me, slut,” he mumbles, nodding goodbye to the other doms and heading in the direction of their platform.
He coughs sharply then, sitting up in bed and grimacing as his body aches. Dean’s face is full of concern as he slides a water glass into Castiel’s empty hand, watching as he chugs. Cas sighs, passing the cup back to Dean to return, then settles further into his pillows.
"Hello, Castiel." Her voice was warm like honey. She had auburn hair artfully pulled back in a twisted bun and thin-rimmed glasses perched on her nose.
He swallows hard before grabbing his keys and stepping out of the car. Castiel takes a step back, looking him up and down. He reaches up a hand, cradling Dean’s chin, his palm feeling over the spot he had just lightly smacked himself.
“What are you doing here?” Dean finally finds his voice as Roman stalks closer. Edgar just leans against the wall, looking bored as usual.
“You can touch me all you want, remember?” Castiel makes a show of clinking the handcuffs against the bar. “For one night only. I’m at your mercy.”
Gabriel inhales sharply. “None of this is your fault, little brother. It’s just a shitty situation that a bunch of fucked-up alphas caused.” He pauses, then asks in a quieter voice, “Where are they, by the way? Still tied up in your basement, you kinky little bastard?”
“You hear those people, getting off to the sight of you? Watching my cock fuck you, going in and out of your tight hole? You taking my dick like you were born for it?”
Dean wonders what on earth that means when Edgar moves from the door, walking behind him with a smirk on his face. Dean yanks at his chains and goes to yell for help when Edgar’s harsh hand slaps over his mouth, the other one sinking in his hair and yanking his head to the side. Dean tries to yell behind the hand but he can’t break free, his body still weak with dehydration and no sleep.
Dean sighs, crossing his arms, his expression unreadable. “I dunno, it seems really fucking weird, Cas.”
“I assure you, Dean, I can and will take what’s owed to me.” Roman sighs with a mock look of pity on his face. “There is, however, another option.”
“Sam! It’s me—Castiel!” Cas shouts, watching Joshua recover his grip on the shovel and bring the flat blade against Azazel’s stomach. “Stay inside until I tell you. I’m not going to let anything happen to you!”
Dean can’t argue with that. They assemble their tents, though Castiel puts up a tarp over his, which didn’t occur to Dean. He’s fairly certain it’s not gonna rain and the tent is waterproof. By the time they finish, the sun is almost set and they get to work starting the fire.
Dean shrugs like this is no big deal, though Castiel knows it’s quite the opposite. “Your blockers are fading a little,” he says, as if that explains it. “Looks like not even the prescription stuff can handle a hard run, huh?”
“You’re sofuckinghuge,” he slurs reverently, and Castiel slides a pillow under Dean’s hip, still stroking his erection. Castiel lines up his dick and slides inside Dean’s slowly, watching Dean’s eyes roll, eyelashes fluttering as he’s penetrated. “Ohmyfuckinggod—”
It’s only a week before he sees Castiel again. He’s wearing jeans and a long sleeve black tee as he stands in the aisle, staring down at Dean, head cocked to the side. Dean’s on his hands and knees reaching under one of the shelves for a set of buckets that got shoved way back. He certainly does not arch his back or widen his knees for Castiel’s benefit, it’s just easier to reach the bucket. He grunts as he pulls the buckets into position and sits back on his heels, turning to look up at Castiel.
Dean makes a grimace, shaking his head. “No can do, sweetheart. I’m pretty sure it’s only gonna take you an hour or two to come up with a better plan than cussing your brother out and burning all your bridges. That’s when you’ll get this back.”
“Yeah, well…” Gabriel swirls the sucker around in his mouth. “I didn’t think you’d blow up your whole life for no reason, but here I am like the good brother I am, ready to pull your ass out of the fire.”
Cas freezes, staring down at his hands and trying not to look guilty. He hasn’t, not technically, but their relationship is fair from platonic at this point.
“That’s true,” Castiel concedes sheepishly. “I meant that more for my other brother, the one who lives locally… But I suppose there’s no harm in being thorough. Thank you, Gadreel.”
Dean feels as shocked as John looks. He hadn’t noticed that part of the contract, having been far more focused on what he was going through. “Cas, is that really true?” he asks, clearing the roughness from his throat.
“Yeah, I don't. It was stupid to get that close.” He watched Castiel fumble with the money and turn to give Dean a soft smile. He felt every bit the loathsome creature he was, watching that beautiful, funny, perfect person throwing their life away on him. He looked over and Sam was staring intently at him. “What?” Sam still just stared, a small smile growing on his face. Dean felt his face heat under that knowing look. “Would you stop?” he grumbled.
“Love you too, Cas,” he whispers back against his lips, before Cas pulls away and heads to the garage. Dean watches Alfie and Jo already out by the car, and they all wave before piling in and driving off.
Gabriel softens and exhales, a gust of breath leaving his lips. “Fine. But don’t fucking dawdle, okay? We finally have the upper hand on dear ol’ Dad, and that happens… Well,
, and tailor your scenes to their needs only. This is not an outlet for your own desires—the role you play is to provide adequate healthcare and training for submissives in need.”
“Good girl, Princess,” Castiel says softly, tugging on her leash and leading her to the door. They take a nice leisurely walk around the facility, staff members pausing to pet Princess and exclaim at how pretty she is. Castiel teaches his dog a few basic tricks—sit, spin, roll over—and gives her a treat every time she learns something new. After their walk, Castiel lets Princess nap in her dog bed, curled up at her Master’s feet, and Castiel can’t help but watch as she rests. When it’s time for lunch, he wakes her up by rubbing her belly. They play fetch that night with Princess’s favorite dildo, and he watches in arousal as she licks and gnaws on her toy with an animalistic zeal.
Dean lets out a long, shaky breath. Castiel always seems to know what to say to make Dean feel safe. “I wanna try, Cas. I still think you're a crazy fucker for wanting to shackle yourself to me, but I’m not gonna stop you.”
. Seriously, this is the fastest my heat has ever broken, so I wanted to celebrate that with my true love…” He pauses and shoots his alpha a wink. “Bacon.”
Castiel frowns in confusion. “I don’t understand that reference, but if you mean how did I get everyone to work together, well…that was less about me and more about you.” He offers up a small smile. “I went to Bobby’s house late last night, after I saw you in the facility. He called Ellen for backup, and I called Rowena so she could be your legal counsel. Everyone wanted to help, so we decided to meet up as a group as soon as the facility opened. Together, it didn’t take us long before we were able to get you out.”
His Master keeps up a litany of words as he smacks him, “Beautiful skin pinking up for me...perfect little whore...love getting used don’t you… so good at taking everything I give you.” The praise mixed with the taunts makes his cheeks flush and heart sing with approval.
“But you like being trussed up, don’t you? Being pressed down so I can do whatever I want to you?” his master taunts, running a solitary finger up his side and making his skin flinch at the sensation. There’s a sudden hard smack right to the inside of his thigh that makes him howl at the shock of it. “I didn’t hear an answer.”
A cool gloved hand reaches up to grip his jaw. “Open up, pet.” Dean complies and feels immensely glad he brushed his teeth so well. “Hmm, nice wide stretch to the mouth, soft supple lips. Bet those feel lovely wrapped around your Master’s cock, don’t they, pet?” Dean nods as best he can, envisioning the weight of his dom on his tongue, filling up his mouth, and it’s so fucking hot. “Good, now let’s test that gag reflex a bit, shall we?” Two fingers slide over his tongue, gliding back into his throat. He works hard to swallow against the intrusion as he feels knuckles press against his lips. It’s a force of will to just take what he’s given and keep his throat lax.
“It’s…you,” he whispers, eyes wide. His old sub looks an equal combination of nervous and terrified, but for some reason, he doesn’t look that surprised.
“Yes, I actually opened a restaurant when I finished my last tour. Lafitte’s Pub. You come down anytime and your meal is on the house.” Benny’s warm, confident voice is calming to Dean’s frayed nerves.
There’s a sudden snarling sound as one of the guys goes flying backwards. Dean looks up to see the wild blue eyes of his alpha…
“Yes, for nearly a decade now. Being able to help people is a passion of mine, and the adrenaline certainly keeps things interesting.”
“Yeah, I know how that feels—I’m kind of a daydreamer.” Dean gives him a small smile, and it feels like a burst of pure light surging through Castiel’s chest. “Uh, anyways… Just came in ‘cause Missouri said your brother and his associates are here. They’re waiting for us in the conference room.”
“Hot as fuck riding breeches,” Dean adds and gets a smack to his shoulder for his trouble. “Apparently we have dinner plans,” Dean announces and watches as Castiel’s brows lift in question.
He leans back in the chair, spinning left a few times and then right, just for good measure. He wishes he brought a book or something. He still can’t get over how big this place is. There’s a whole north wing to the house where Kevin, the VP of research and development, works on his projects. He’s seen Kevin a few times at dinner but he’s a pretty distracted guy, mumbling to himself and bolting up mid-meal to go back to his office or whatever. Missouri has been held up in there helping him with some new project the past two days.
Castiel closes the distance between them, kissing Dean long and slow and sweet. When he pulls away, their foreheads are touching, and he whispers, “It was no fun for me, either. Watching you with other girls…thinking I could never have you.”
His body wanted Castiel so bad it physically ached. He’d never been around an Alpha who wasn’t family during a heat before. Certainly not one who smelled so amazing. He’d never wanted anyone's knot like he wanted Castiel’s right then. It took all his self control not to stick his ass in the air and beg the man to fuck him already. God, he wanted it so bad, but he also knew that was likely just the heat talking.
Castiel’s heart is pounding, his fingers flying on the screen before he has a second to doubt himself.
“Oh fuck,” Dean breaths out, feeling a little lightheaded as he imagines just what that could entail.
“If Winchester pays the original debt, with interest, all of this goes away and the contract is null and void.”
“Nope, you’ve had the sub and I’ve had the dom. And those times were fucking amazing, don’t get me wrong. But we’ve never done this as…you and me. Cas and Dean.” Dean exhales shakily, then plants a kiss on Castiel’s neck. Then another. “C’mon, Cas, I want you. Not a persona, not a dom, not a scene. Just you.”
Castiel stands then, helping Dean to his feet but not letting go of his hand. “Well then, no time like the present?”
“He’s getting there,” Castiel says with a chuckle. “You did a great job with him, Dean. You should be very proud of the man he became.”
“Bye, alpha,” he whispers low in Castiel’s ear, lips brushing his neck. He hears the sharp intake of breath before he flees the scene. The last thing he needs is to leak through Castiel’s borrowed trousers. Certainly not until he’s somewhere he can get the trousers off, preferably with Castiel’s teeth. Dean hurries down the hall with his mind swimming with thoughts of those cool, blue eyes.
When they pull apart neither says a word. Sam just gives him an embarrassed, watery smile before trudging up to bed. Dean collapses down on the couch in the stillness of the house as tears come to his own eyes and for just a minute he wishes that there were strong arms to hold him, maybe just this once. He chokes them down and buries them deep as he lays down right where he is and falls fast asleep.
“I…I’m sorry. I’m actually looking for someone,” Castiel admits, with some embarrassment. He never thought he’d run into his beautifully handsome sub in public, but of course, it had to be when he’s waiting for another man to arrive. Not to mention that “beautifully handsome” hardly begins to cover it…Castiel has never seen the man in the daytime, never outside of a scene, but his sub looks wonderful in the bright sunlight. Standing up straight, shoulders thrown back, eyes meeting Castiel’s without wavering. The intensity between them is still there, the heat and chemistry that made their scenes so unforgettable. But Castiel has to think with his heart right now, not any
“I certainly hope we're friends...otherwise you're a terrible businessman, working for free,” Castiel adds.
“Don’t wanna get you in trouble,” Dean forced the words out in a hoarse broken voice. He hadn’t used his voice for more than begging or screaming in so long, talking felt foreign. He felt another hand on his shoulder and turned to see Tessa next to him.
, not a scene, and he has to keep a clear head. He’s about to open his mouth to say as much, when he hears his name being called from behind. He glances up, unable to stop from gaping with dread.
“I know you were just watching last night, and being new to the scene can be… intimidating.” Castiel pauses a moment like he's picking his words carefully. “If you ever want to explore, I am available. Someone like you deserves to be well taken care of.” Is this guy really offering him what he thinks he is in the middle of the goddamn office?
Here we are, at the end. I feel both like this happened so fast and took so long. All of you WIP readers who have stuck with me so far have meant the world to me as a writer. I hope you enjoyed following this journey as much I did sharing it with you. Couldn't have gotten through this fic without my friends EllenOfOz, waywardjenn, and TrenchcoatBaby, who were there to help me with edits, advice and love. My fics tend to take a village so thank you all.
“So, does that mean it’s ‘unacceptable’ to fuck an omega?” Raphael asks. “To split ‘em open on your knot? Oh, I forgot. You wouldn’t know, would you, Castiel?”
He was in one of the last waves of his heat as he pictured strong arms holding him safe and tight. Pink lips wrapped on the nape of his neck and imagined sharp teeth sinking into him with a growl as a knot swelled within him, and he came hard, crying out “Castiel!” at the top of his lungs. As he came down from his orgasm, muscles aching, he realized what he’d done. A thought occurred to him then… could Castiel be his mate?
Hey loves! TrenchcoatBaby here! We know things are dim right now, but as they say, it's always darkest before the dawn. To all 700+ of you who are subscribed to this story (isn't that an INSANE NUMBER holy smokes!!!) and especially those of you who leave comments, we love your passion for this story. It's so rewarding to share a piece of ourselves in this way, and to have the opportunity to foster and communicate with such an awesome community. (I'm feeling really sentimental today, sorryyy, haha. I totally imagine my coauthor shaking her head and laughing at me right now…yep, she's definitely doing it.)
“He told me it was his house and his money. Then Gordon jumped in, telling me I should be grateful that my dad puts a roof over my head. That I better show Dad more respect, cause if I present omega my dad might just sell me off like he did you. Spouting shit about you, and…I took a swing at him.” Sam shrugs, looking nervously over at Dean and back down at his shirt.
Dean looks in the rearview mirror—Sam is still asleep, but he keeps his voice low. “Yeah, I was hoping to lay low there for a while. I just need somewhere safe for us.”
“Hello, Dean,” he greets lightly, standing up behind the desk, though he doesn’t know why. What exactly did he plan to do—hug Dean? Shake his hand?
Eventually there’s a knock on his apartment door, startling him out of his self-deprecating thoughts. He removes the deadbolt and slides the door open, Hannah sporting a fresh uniform and holding a large pizza box.
Cas nods and follows her down the hill toward the paddocks. It’s a more of a planned dance bringing them in then most people would realize, needing to try and follow the pecking order to avoid any dinner time drama. Cas looks over each horse as he brings them in, checking for any fresh cuts or anyone walking funny. Fly masks get hung up with halters, and soon the barn is filled with the sounds of horses munching down their hay. He loves when the barn is full, all the snuffles and shifting and munching sounds are soothing to him. He and Ellie grab grain buckets and make their way down the aisle.
“He’s such a little bitch, I bet he has milk like a real heffer,” Abaddon purrs, rubbing the front of her chest and winking at Dean. “Trade you, gorgeous.”
Castiel moves onto his thighs and ass, and he gasps as a few strands hit his sensitive inner thigh. His cock is well and truly leaking, bouncing for attention where its being held. He bites his lip as Castiel finally hangs up the flogger and runs a teasing hand over his reddened skin.
He wishes suddenly for a little more liquid courage, but thinks his nerves might be a bit too obvious if he suggests they have a two a.m. pint of whiskey.
“Fine, have it your way, but you gotta drink something, okay?” a Gatorade bottle comes into view by his face. He rolls over onto his back and catches his breath before he sits up and opens the bottle.
“Is there always this much… work to doing this kind of thing?” He wonders when they will just get to the fun part.
“Thank you, Michael. Dean, they will take good care of you. I am sure this will be an educational experience for you,” Cain reaches down and takes off the dreadful red collar. Cain hesitates only a second before strolling out the door. Another Dom is leaving him in the dust.
“Dude, I don’t even have to look those up. They were the talk of the office last week!” Charlie exclaims. “Anything over eighty-five percent is like, so rare, you have no idea.”
“Listen, I don’t like to get involved in my brother’s love life, ‘cause…gross.” Sam scrunches up his face, reminding Castiel of the awkward, gangly teenager he’d been all those years ago. It’s a fond memory, a reminder of their deep bonds, and he smiles softly. “But if you’re not interested in Dean, you should tell him. And soon, Cas. I’ve seen him go through enough bad relationships, and I just want him to be happy.”
Castiel looks up at him. He pulls the glasses off his face, a small, relieved smile on his face. “Dean.” Just that one word, said like it's a prayer on his alpha’s lips, makes Dean’s heart thump in his chest.
“I’ll say whatever the hell I want to my son in my house,” John growls back. They both look like angry dogs with their hackles raised.
“Gonna have to disagree with you on this one boss,” Dean turns his head to admire the tight lines of Castiel’s legs.
He spins on his heels, clutching the gift bag in his left hand like a lifeline, and comes face to face with…
“I read through your profile carefully, Dean. I felt connected to you right from the beginning. Kindred spirits, if you will. You and I are very much alike. I am willing to give this a try if you are?” Cain again gives him a warm smile, and Dean can’t help but wish it was Castiel sitting across from him.
“Hopefully with some proper education and training we can convince you otherwise.” Castiel sighs again, typing away on his computer. “And how often do you achieve light or heavy subspace?”
Dean grinned a little and Castiel returned it. They both parted, heading for their respective cars, and Castiel thought letting him go this time was going to be even harder than before.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean says with a wave of his hand. Castiel glares at him dangerously, and Dean looks sheepish, elbowing him lightly in the ribs. “Aw, c’mon, Cas. Just lightening the mood. Besides, I already got the riot act from my dad, and Bobby, and Sammy—”
Dean bites his lip but nods, watching his movement to make sure he doesn’t seem to be injured. Castiel lowers himself on the bed next to his knees.
, how Castiel wants to claim him that way, too. How he wants to sink his teeth into the spot where Dean’s neck and shoulder meet, to pump him full of come at the exact moment he sinks his teeth into Dean’s tender flesh. He imagines that Dean would come untouched from the intensity alone, like he has so many times tonight already. But Castiel can’t bite him like this—not in the throes in passion, in the middle of his heat when they’re both operating on animalistic instinct. And not before talking to Dean, a
“I have a reward for you, if you can make it ten times for me. You can tap out at any time it becomes too much for you, but I want you to try your best to reach ten.”
With those administrative tasks in motion, Castiel sifts through his inbox and replies to his messages. He reschedules two afternoon meetings for the following day, makes sure there’s a playroom reserved for him and Dean at two o’clock. Then he orders two salads from the cafeteria, thanking Alfie when they’re dropped on a silver tray outside his door. Even though the blood sample results haven’t been processed yet, he knows Dean’s sugar is low from the intense drop and adrenaline rush from this morning. He toasts a piece of bread and then covers it with peanut butter, bananas, and granola, then drizzles honey on top.
“Can you imagine if we both end up falling for people at the same time? Won’t be the bachelor Winchesters anymore,” Sam says, and there’s a mix of excitement and sadness to his tone.
“A little,” he said, taking a few bites and then his stomach was just not having any more. He did drink some proffered water and Castiel ran his fingers through Dean’s hair again before heading back down stairs. Dean’s gut screamed at him to call after Castiel to pull the man into the bed with him. He bit down on his lip hard enough to bruise to keep the words in.
“I do not blush,” Castiel says, feigning grumpiness to make Dean chuckle. He does, smiling and brushing Castiel’s check with the pad of his thumb. He grabs unexpectedly at the collar of Castiel’s button-up, the other hand tugging on his tie, and then Dean smashes their lips together greedily. Castiel lets out a small groan as Dean fills his senses, pulling him in closer to the mattress. As he starts to put his full weight on the bed, Castiel realizes his mistake.
In less than five minutes, Cas is just lying there in his boxers, the room heavy with his scent, and Dean’s chest is rising and falling at a rapid rate.
“First things first, you need to go in there and take a cool shower. I’m gonna get you some fresh bed sheets and something to eat, okay?” Dean stands up, offering his brother a hand.
TCBaby: I would say you, but since we’ve unofficially assumed the POVs we write, it would be up to dom!Cas to break the news, right?
He cools a cup of coffee down with some ice-cubes and then places it on the floor, watching as Princess licks the rim, moaning softly when the flavor hits her tongue. Castiel has felt a low-burn of arousal since yesterday, and he presses the heel of his hand against his erection. Princess blinks, watching the motion with interest, then crawls over to her Master and lets her tongue hang down.
“Oh, sure, rub it in, why don’t you?” Dean retorted, and just that quickly, they slid back into their familiar banter. Like this, it was almost easy to forget the worries and the stress over any feelings that might or might not be unrequited. Almost, but not quite. When Castiel quickly grabbed the bag before it could slip from under Dean’s arm and fall, and his hand brushed against Dean’s hip in doing so, part of Dean almost felt like crying at the inadvertent contact, demanding that he reciprocate the touch. When Castiel asked, rather sternly, whether Dean had taken his evening antibiotic yet, Dean wanted to melt under the thought of how Castiel might care for him in other ways. Meg was right; if Dean didn’t speak up, this tension was going to end in brains spattering against the damn ceiling.
When Castiel kept his hand cupped over Dean’s grip, fingers laced together as he guided Dean toward the marked spot…well, how could Dean be blamed if he decided that it wasn’t all that important to set this particular record straight? After all, it
“Castiel, you better be done,” Dean yelled, shoulder pushing against the desk. “We’re not getting back out this way, so any other suggestions would be fantastic right now.” He ducked just as Sam hefted the wood frame of a sofa from another office on top of the desk. Meg was shooting through the broken window, next to the younger soldier.
“They’ve probably already seen us,” Castiel said. He felt strangely detached, as though the part of his brain unconvinced that this was real had therefore concluded that the danger must be equally imaginary. He could see movement in the shadows at the base of the nearest silo, and a moment later he was able to pick out the shapes of the first zoms heading unmistakably in their direction.
Instantly, Dean presses a hand to Castiel’s chest, shoves at him in a gesture that urges Cas to look at him. Their eyes lock, the warm earthy green around Dean’s pupil shining with wonder.
Cas sighed deeply. He was thankful for the position of their chairs. That way, he didn’t have to look Dean in the eyes when he told his story.
He receives a glare for that, but with his leg trapped in a cast there is no other way for Winchester to protest. Getting up on his own would be even more of a process for him than it was for Castiel. Which is what he is counting on.
Instantly, he felt bigger, sturdier. Readier to take Dean’s repressed disappointment and Benny’s unabashed judgment. He didn’t remember having taken off his coat, so maybe Benny had, when he’d carried him into this room and deposited him on the bed to recover. Speaking of-
It’s not an ideal thing to say, because it makes Cas restless again. He tries to squirm out of Dean’s embrace before he decides he wants closer and not away, and then just buries his nose in Dean’s shirt, fussing into it because apparently he’s reached the stage of whiny drunk. Which would be cute, if it wouldn’t threaten to break Dean’s heart. “Please, Dean,” he lets out, a pitiful sound. “I can do that for you too, you don’t need to look for uh, these women or, well, men, in these bars or diners, I can-”
When Doctor Milton stops by to let him know his ribs are healing well without posing any more danger towards his lungs but she’s still worried about his head trauma and would like him to continue therapy with a physician, she has a smile on her face the whole time. It’s not good news to Castiel, so he doesn’t know why she would be so excited for him.
This time, Cas gives back as good as he gets. His hands travel from Dean’s shoulders over his back up to play with the hair in his nape while his lips move against Dean’s in desperate frenzy and he’s glad Dean’s holding him up because phenomenal cosmic strength or not, his knees can and will give way under the weight of finally getting what he’s wanted for so long.
There was something poetic to it, Castiel thought. That the destruction of one was salvation for him.
And this is when his new drink finally arrives in front of him, allowing Cas to wash those words away, along with the irksome
Still, it was nice. Cas closed his eyes and absorbed Dean’s warmth into himself, breathed in the familiar scent of leather and motor oil and Dean. Absently, he wondered if this may be a better way to deal. It felt nice, anyway. And the world seemed just a fraction more bearable.
Castiel closed his eyes, suddenly missing the solidity of the mattress against his back. He sacked into the chair which had held his coat earlier, not bothering to keep in a deep sigh.
“Unlike you,” quips Dean. And then he completely butchers Cas’ name, stretching the ‘ie’ until it sounds more like Ca-steelle than anything remotely correct.
“Hmmmm,” murmurs Cas. He sounds sleepy, or as sleepy as an angel can get. Dean wonders if his attention span is still big enough that he’s listening.
Dean gets nailed into the mattress like he’s an effigy Cas needs to get absolutely right and all he can do is grip the sheets between his fingers and hold on for dear life. He doesn’t even need to do anything. Just lie there and take it.
Wide-eyed and accompanied by at least ten chorused screams of alarm, Cas throws himself to the side. In the blink of an eye, the whole puddle of holy oil has caught fire right at the place where Cas had been standing mere seconds ago. He stares into the heat, willing his heart to slow its rapid beating despite the image of the dancing flames that burns itself into his retinas.
”, he just enjoys this lightness and the smile seeing his friend puts on his face. That stupid weight that’s been dragging him downim during Cas’ absence is shoved far away for now, letting him breathe a little easier.
In a way Dean’ll dispute to his dying day, a string of embarrassing giggles rushes out of his mouth at that. “Shit, Cas, you well and truly rocked my world.”
Cas extends a finger to Dean's forehead and in the blink of an eye, they're in Dean's room in the Bunker. Dean will complain about constipation later, but it will be worth it since they're finally getting laid.
“You don’t know him.” Cas doesn’t know why defense is still his first instinct, when Michael hasn’t paid him a visit a single time during all his stay in the hospital. When Sam had been there for Dean whenever he could.
This side of death was not absolute. Where there was suffering, there was still life, and so the end of theirs could still be averted.
Castiel snorts. “I’d like to see you try, with that thing keeping you back,” he says, pointing at his cast.
Not all of the eyes have their attention focused on Dean, though. A few are glancing into random directions that probably aren’t random at all, knowing Cas, and some seem to be gazing inward. Whatever they might be seeing there.
, huh?” He’s quoting Cas’ words, translated from the Romanian that slipped out of Cas’ mouth in the midst of ecstasy.
Sam doesn’t get the relationship he has with Cas. He’d been totally dumbstruck when Dean told him that his asshole hospital roommate was now also his asshole romantic partner. He’d been seconds away from suggesting his head be scanned in case his leg wasn’t the only thing damaged in the car accident.
Dean chuckles. “So, I’ll just–” Discarding the book, he strides back to their bed and plops on his back, makes a move to drag Cas over him. But Cas protests.
“Hate to interrupt but… we got a text from our little group of wayward gals,” Charlie regretfully informs them, waving her phone through the air for emphasis. “They say they’ve found something ‘very interesting’, and they thought we should come see it.”
He doesn’t look, but he thinks Winchester may be rolling his eyes. “Told ya he’s a robot,” he directs at someone among his visitors, or maybe all of them. Castiel doesn’t know. He’s had enough of their intruding eyes. He rolls carefully over to his left side, swallowing the grunt that threatens to escape him at the wave of pain shooting from his ribs, and stares at the door.
“And we're not so bad on our own,” points out Eileen, whirling a blade around in her hand in a very convincing display of power.
Cas’ scowl deepens, and his hand twitches as if he’d like to move, do something, but his slumped pose against the headboard tells Dean just how exhausted he still is. That settles it. Guy needs some care.
Cas isn’t normally a drunkard. At all. Only when circumstances really demand it that he must become, as they say, ‘wasted’, and he seeks to apply the distraction methods Dean taught him to forget about how awful he’s feeling for a while.
He’s made peace with it. He doesn’t think he can stomach hearing the rejection out of Dean’s own mouth.
Castiel’s jaw worked against the words that dreaded to spill out of his mouth. That what Benny explained was exactly why Castiel went to that hospital, away from Sam and Dean’s watchful eyes. How could he have thought
It’s the wrong thing to say, Cas knows instantly. Because Dean pulls out and skips out of Castiel’s reach to access the big array of dictionaries he’s set up in the corner of their room, leaving Cas staring up at the ceiling and brooding over where he went wrong in his life. Waiting has never felt so long – and he spent centuries watching the formation of the Vatnajökull glacier.
Dean, who may or may not have made quite an impressive, panicky leap into the air somewhere in the process between grabbing his gun and directing it at his unsuspecting partner, finally relaxes back against the mattress.
The cheerful spirits his innocent little flirt had put him into have vanished completely after Sam’s running commentary about his “promiscuous ass”, and Cas wasn’t anywhere to be seen either since they left the bar. Looks like it’s gonna be another night of the guessing game as to whether the idiot’ll be back in the morning or if he’ll be god-probably-doesn’t-know-either-where.
“I put my guard down,” he says. “I didn’t mean to confront you with this sight, I truly didn’t, but it was warm and comfortable, and you were here by my side, sleeping soundly and…,” He pauses, grasping for the right words.
Dean slides onto the seat opposite him without a word. The waitress comes over and he orders a bacon cheese burger with chilli fries and a coke and waits for his food to arrive.
An awkward cough puts an early end to their erupting argument. “How about I take the girls, and Team Research takes the first Cas shift?” suggests Jody.
Then Benny blinked and the expression was replaced by a much more neutral one, and he said, “But you can talk all that out with Dean now, huh.” A grin appeared on the vampire’s face that Castiel very much wanted to punch off of him. “Hola, brother.”
“I did, in fact,” Cas says back, calm as anything, as if his heart isn’t beating like a jackrabbit against his ribcage from the unexpected halt. “And since you pulled up already,” he continues on this perilous path, unbuckles his seat belt. “We can now find someone to give us the directions.”
Cas frowns. Clearly, complimenting the physique of your lover’s brother crosses some kind of social boundaries he had not previously been aware of. He takes a mental note of it, but decides that avoiding a repeat offense isn’t a priority since the good (making Sam feel good about his body image) outweighs the bad (annoying Dean) in this case. Maybe Cas’ judgment stems from his frustration towards Dean’s unwillingness to resume the new intimacy of their developing relationship, however, and he is doing wrong by Dean.
He flashes Cas a grin that’s too powerful to be defeated by Cas’ scowl. A fact that’s proven true when one corner of Cas’ mouth lifts in a reluctant half-smile.
“I’m not a-” Cas tries to protest, but is interrupted by Dean brushing his fingers through Cas’ mane, which causes the purring to grow louder.
ask about that. Later. But right now he just sends a spurt of Grace through the hand and savours the shudder that sends through Dean as well as the shy smile that paints Dean’s face even redder.
A shaky laugh escapes Sam at that, and before Cas can blink, he's got the woman wrapped in a crushing hug.
“I told you,” Cas growls. “I told you I’m not as strong as I once was and that carrying both of you as additional weight would weaken me further!”
By the way he slides a little closer on the bed, pressing his knee against Dean’s, though, maybe it’s a good thing after all.
Cas turns to look at him with his earnest, blue blue eyes and responds with his usual, “Hello, Dean.”
Another perk of angel sex? You don’t play by the rules of human libido anymore. One spark of Cas’ grace to Dean’s pelvis, and the show can go on.
“It wasn't a resurrection,” comes the explanation from a voice Castiel had hoped to never hear again. “Because we were never dead in the first place.”
Absently (because his consciousness is preoccupied with ogling Dean), he overhears the conversation going on in the front seat.
Said hunter-slash-werewolf looks like a deer in headlights who just realized what he thought was a car racing towards it had in fact been the moon all along. “No,” he says, exhaling a heavy breath. “No, I didn't even know there's such a thing as angel killing bullets! Phew, Cas, I'm so glad you're healing. We really both escaped death there, huh, because for a minute there I thought for sure, 'Dean's gonna kill me for this', ha ha!”
Dean looked at him. “Where did it go all the times before now, then?” he asked. “Don’t tell me you always had to take on their –
“Guys,” he says, raising his Voice into a higher frequency for all his brethren to hear. “We don’t have time for this.”
to hide part of my True Face from your capacity of perception. And then you woke up, and it was too late. It is incompetent and unforgivable, and I apologize for my sluggishness. It will not happen again, I promise you.”
Dean didn’t even get to change into his pajamas, before he got attacked by Mr Blanket-in-Angel-Form. Surrounded by Cas’ warmth, he doesn’t much care.
“You,” Cas says. “Shouldn't even be here. I'm not any of your concerns, I'm sorry for wasting your time, Claire, but you can all go now.” Maybe if Cas can corner Dean alone in his bedroom, a repetition of last night's events doesn't have to be completely out of the cards yet.
