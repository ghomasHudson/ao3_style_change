Sam was only half paying attention to their lesson, watching the minutes tick down.
Nodding to Benny Cas went to sit next to Charlie on  a log by the fire. “Well hello there Castiel,” A slightly tipsy Charlie laughed out with a drunk grin, “Where's your boy?”
“This is everything I thought it would be,” Cas said with a grimace as they saw two people lying on the grass making out.
“Hey Dean, wait,” Dean sighed, pausing at the bottom of the staircase, waiting for his little brother to catch up.
He walked through the house, spotting his mum in the sitting room, "how were they?" Mary asked without any pleasantries.
He clambered onto the dirty mattress and examined the barely-warm body on it. His hand shook when he felt for a pulse and found it; weak and thready but still wonderfully present.
“What’s her favourite type of candy, Jordan?”
Cas liked him, and he liked Cas back. They were going to make this work.
“She’s heading north, Sam. What’s up north over there?”
A soft snort. “Yes Dean, I know.”
“Why yes, yes I have.”
He was divided between jumping for joy in the middle of the hoodie aisle, and sitting the both of them down and giving them The Talk. He had a sneaking suspicion that Cas still thought ‘protection’ meant his angel blade.
This knowledge didn’t stop Sam from blowing out a relieved breath when he glimpsed a tuft of wild black hair over by the fountain. Then his relief was punched out of him by the thought
“I was trying to find a Christmas present for my little Rudy - such a nice boy, always so polite, nothing like those hoodlums you see on the news these days - and I seem to have gotten myself turned around. He likes dinosaurs, you see, and I was so hoping to get him one of those pretty four-legged ones, with the horns you know, not one of those horrid rexes or whatever they’re called. . .”
“That can be arranged.”
Dean watched him with his mouth half-open. He went red and finished off his own beer when Manny’s raised eyebrow made it clear that his ogling wasn’t as subtle as he thought it was.
He was somewhat proud of the way he had handled that revelation. Sure, maybe he had taken a decade off Sammy’s lifespan when his little brother had found an unconscious Dean in the kitchen, with an empty whiskey bottle cradled against his chest and his shoes stuffed in the toaster.
Manny blinked. The man blinked right back at him. He looked as surprised at having said that as Manny felt at hearing it.
The first sign that alerted Manny to a possible change in his Monday routine was when he stumbled into a sleepy-looking man in his subway car.
“You know that wasn’t a marriage proposal, right?”
She tasted like ash and rotten meat.
“Gummy bears!” The boy pulled out a crinkled packet from his pocket. “I’ve got some right now!”
He learned about the man’s love for pie when Manny baked him one as a housewarming gift.
He wished he had some way of getting a message to them, a warning. Manny knew firsthand
Dean blinked, but he didn’t need Cas’ ‘don’t mess this up’ eyebrow to know not to laugh. Instead he pretended to think.
“Deal.” Dean snarled, before yanking her forward into a kiss.
He had originally wanted there to be more of them, maybe in one of those fancy mason jars with a cheesy note saying ‘Will you be mine?’, but had ultimately scrapped that idea.
A yawn. “Can we discuss this in the morning, Dean? I’m exhausted.”
So what if the kids department and the check-out counter were both on the same floor? It was still a pretty big-ass floor for little legs to walk across. Cas was probably ooh-ing over those cool miniature spaceships and had just lost track of time.
Dean raised his hand and held it in the air for exactly 34 seconds before dropping it. He glared at door number 27 and sighed.
Dean looked up, frowning. Sam looked frazzled, with two bulging bags hanging from each hand and a third over his shoulder.
It was now Cas’ turn to glare. “Yes, because you tossed the orb into my face.”
“Hmm. Well, what kinda flowers did you get her?”
Crowley’s snickering hadn’t helped either. Slimy bastard.
He spat it out while the demon reappeared five feet away. His fingernails dug furrows into the dust as he pushed himself to his knees. He bared his teeth at her.
when Rowena bustled past her son and made a beeline for Cas. Dean immediately bristled.
“Some grandma needed help with her Christmas shopping and Cas volunteered.” Dean didn’t know why it felt like his stomach had a rock in it, but he didn’t like it. “I’ll go get him, I bet he’s still in the toy aisle.”
“Well, I’ve only heard rumours, but apparently Yellow Eyes fed baby Sammy his blood to make him into the perfect general. Guess that was a bust.”
“Decided yet?” Her lips were going to reach her ears if they stretched any further. She actually hopped on the spot when Dean nodded.
Because that wasn’t him. At the end of the day, six green lollipops with a blue one in the centre peeking over them, all held together with twine, was more ‘Dean’ than any frilly store-bought crap could ever be.
Across from him, Dean pouted. Sam sighed.
“Yeah, Cas is right kiddo. Not every chi - uh, girl likes the same things. So you gotta ask yourself: what does
“Yeah, that. . . that does sound kinda nice.” He looked around the kitchen once, twice, before leaving his little brother with the wise parting words of “Don’t drown in all that green, Sammy!”
Oh, and his name - Manny also learned that his name was Dean Smith. Which he had
He also knew that Cas would sooner voluntarily kiss Crowley than go out with the guy who had basically got him personally escorted out the Pearly Gates. Which meant that those newly-discovered feelings had to be bundled away into his mental wardrobe labelled ‘Things Dean wants but can’t have'.
Dean had mauled four pens before giving up.
Dean was almost too terrified by that thought to even notice that they had reached another door. The glimpse of pale skin through the metal rails of an old cot, however, jolted him back to life. Dean was barrelling through the door as soon as he saw him, heedless of Sam’s cries to “Wait, Dean, let me go first, it could be a trap!”
Hello again! I know you already got one chapter today, but this one isn't that long, and since it's the last one, I thought I'd post it too.
“Proposal by gummy bear. That’s a new one.”
Jordan nodded, surprisingly solemn.
Blue eyes blinked behind their transparent covering.
Sam knew they had the right place as soon as he cracked the front door open.
Right into Cas’ face.
know?”
It was the freckles that did it for Sam.
Sam, aka the interrupting moose, chipped in with his two cents. “It’s not funny, Dean. You heard Rowena, Cas is lucky he didn’t get an overdose of that pink powder stuff. He could have been deaged to
Sam nodded, clearly still distracted, and Dean was off.
that?”
before sailing right into the heretofore lost city of
Incidentally, if Sam had taken off his headphones at that moment, he would have caught the tail end of an oddly high-pitched argument: “Dean, don’t
Dean was too shell-shocked to even think of disobedience.
He had beamed when Dean showed him his spoils from Sam, a huge gummy grin Dean couldn’t remember his adult self ever wearing.
It wasn’t.
And Manny had agreed.
But considering the fact that Cas had his head ducked down and a blush on his cheeks, he thought he could make an educated guess.
Manny could only nod dumbly.
Sam peered over his laptop screen at his brother, half convinced that he had reverted to full-size when he wasn’t looking. Kids didn’t typically snarl when they spoke, after all.
“She has helped us numerous times in the past, Dean. It would serve her no purpose to betray us, especially considering the fact that we now have the new God on our side.”
“As if yours are any better.”
His blossoming panic attack was neatly averted by the shrill voice of Poinsettia Lady’s daughter. “My mommy says you’re holding up the line Mr. Giant.”
They moved into the factory as one.
Dean froze. “That - that wasn’t the deal! You said -”
how charming Dean could make himself appear to be; if he turned that charm on Jimmy as he picked up Claire from daycare, maybe with some sob story about his car having broken down. . . Well, Jimmy was a lot of things, but overtly paranoid wasn't one of them. If he put his mind to it, Dean would probably find it easier to take them than it had been to take Manny.
That night, in Dean’s bed:
” Dean glared across the table at Cas, who was working through his own slice of pie with considerably more decorum than Dean. “And it’s gonna be two weeks for
Dean smiled and closed his eyes, content.
“Oh isn’t he just
But he hadn’t collapsed outside Cas’ door or sent him any drunk texts or voicemails along the lines of ‘Hey Cas, I’m in love with you, wanna make out?’ so he considered it a win.
Jimmy never put it so bluntly of course, but Manny could read between the lines.
Dean bit back a sigh at her rambling. He still couldn’t help but smile when Cas spoke up. “The toy aisle is back that way, ma’am. I’d be happy to show you.”
“Honey, you could offer to stake yourself on the spot and it still wouldn’t -”
Then he stared expectantly up at Dean.
If possible, Sam’s smirk only grew. He reached down to ruffle Dean’s hair.
Manny couldn’t remember his driveway being so
The sudden movement startled the ex-angel. His water bottle jerked, splashing them and the tiny sphere in Dean’s hand.
“This had better be the wackiest dream I’ve ever had.”
nowadays, so easy to get lost in, aren’t they?”
“Someone is crying,” he announced. “A child.”
He patted the cold granite headstone in front of him.
“You look decades younger, Squirrel. Can I ask what moisturiser you’re using? Oh come now.”
“A joke item, Cas. I got shrunk by a frigging
Sam blinked once more.
Not one twitch or flutter of eyelashes.
But that was then. There was nothing stopping them from making it official
It happened on a Saturday.
Sam made sure to keep smirking as he piled every bit of change he could spare into Dean’s tiny hands. “You’re not gonna drop them, are you?”
And now that patience was being tested by none other than Dean Winchester, older brother and Asshole-Extraordinaire.
“We’ve got enough time to finish off the drinks. Might have to skip dessert though. Shame, too.” Dean pouted and Manny wanted to nibble at that pooched-out lower lip. “The pie was what sold me on this place.”
“Hmm?”
He knew Amelia didn’t really like him, not even now, after almost fourteen years of having known each other. He didn’t blame her for that - he possessed sufficient self-awareness to recognise that most people found his particular brand of awkwardness to be an acquired taste. Very few wanted to stick around for a second helping.
Any onlookers would have considered it a bizarre parade: mini-Dean at the front with his constantly moving shotgun, covering the much bigger Sam behind him. The younger Winchester had Cas cradled in one arm and walked with his upper half curled over him protectively, another shotgun held in his free hand.
This was my first time writing a fic, and honestly, it's been a lot more fun than I imagined it would be. Thank you to everyone who's been reading this and subscribing and leaving kudos and comments.
time, Dean. Can we do this again?” He didn’t know where his new-found confidence had come from, but he hoped it stuck around for a while.
The mother-son circus act might have left the bunker nearly an hour ago, but he was still fuming. Whatever he had to say about Rowena, there was no denying that she was the best witch around. So when she had taken one good look at that damn sphere and burst into chortles, he had been. . . miffed, to say the least.
Manny flipped himself upright. “I usually grab a donut at the corner cafe. You really needn’t fuss, Jimmy.”
“Roses, but Lily said she - she don’t like flowers. But - but my mommy said every girl likes ‘em and Cas says that everyone has their pref - prefen. . . ”
His legs crossed as he straightened outside the car. He was saved from face planting in the dirt only by Dean’s arm around his waist. “Whoa, guess that last beer really took, huh? Just a little further, buddy.”
“Love you too,” came the almost indistinct reply.
Rowena shook her head. “All I can sense are two perfectly healthy, human children. Though I could still examine them, I suppose.” She moved towards Cas again, and predictably, Dean stood close enough to step on the hem of her gown. Knowing him it was on purpose.
She nodded brightly, "I got full marks on my spelling test, Mummy said she was proud of me."
Sam let out a sigh of relief. Thank everything that's good, the lesson was over.  He could not deal with any more of Lisa and Marve trying to set Cas up with someone, not Cas being too oblivious to notice.
Sam just rolled his eyes, "I don't know why you decided to join in the lying but it's not going to work. I won't fall for it."
"I'm so sorry I had to cancel," Cas started, "but we need this money. If Gabe and I ever want to escape to Uni, we need the funds."
Just the Cas walked in, cutting their conversation short. "Okay class, I hope you've had a good day."
Around noon people started to arrive, his friends all came with their families, Jo bringing along the meat for the barbecue and Benny bringing along some desserts.
"But she isn't your sister?" Sam continued. He was confused, he felt like they were trying to tell him something but had no idea what.
After a bit, Cas reluctantly pulled back, “As much as I like hugs, I still have an essay to write, and I don’t think your work is going to do itself either.”
Sam sat back in his chair, tiredly rubbing his hand across his eyes, "Two girls in my class have decided they need to set Cas up with someone. Somehow they thought Zachariah Being-Nonbinary-is-a-Fad Alder was the best place to start. They were trying to see if you'd ask him out on a date Cas."
Sam threw himself into the day, making the salad for lunch and washing the chairs so people could sit outside in the sun.
Dean grinned at him mischievously. "Do it."
Looking in the mirror they decided they looked good enough and added some quick eyeliner to finish the look.
But Cas knew.
He walked over to the Impala, leaning against the boot as he waited for Dean to get out of class and drive them home.
For one, Sam was able to stay in the classroom with Cas while they packed up, instead of having to go to the car to avoid suspicion.
He had short blacky brown hair but had a colourful flower crown perched on top, as well as wearing a lilac sundress. Definitely not the kind of boy Sam though Dean would date, not that Sam ever thought Dean would be dating a boy.
---------
Benny: She actually exists?
It didn’t take too much coaxing to get Dean from the party to his dorm room, the real problem was leaving again, Dean was apparently a clingy drunk.
Sam nearly snapped the ruler he was putting in his pencil case he was gripping it so hard. He hated the image that was just planted in his mind of his sibling on a date with Zachariah Alder. It was disturbing.
“And I use they/them pronouns.”
John snorted -when had he arrived?- in faux amusement, "Joke. Sure. Great. You'll see."
But even they had to admit Dean looked good.
He couldn't wait to finally catch Dean in his own lie. He wouldn't let him make any excuses, not this time.
“Something doesn’t add up,” Sam muttered.
Pulling them fully onto his lap, Cas kissed their forehead before responding, “Of course you aren’t broken, you’re you.”
"Hey Sammy," Dean smiled as he walked over, "how's your day been?"
And it was there, from a few feet away he heard Lisa whisper to Marve, "He's kinda hot." They both giggled while Sam tried not to gag.
Sam: Second she had too much homework so couldn’t come.
Glancing back down to the table they laughed softly, “It’s not that I don’t want to come out, not really, more I already know they won’t accept me, they’ve had too many conversations around me about how everything about me isn’t valid, about how trans people should go the therapy, how non binary people don’t exist and gender neutral and neo pronouns are too confusing and shouldn’t be used. They even think asexuality is a choice and aromantic people are psychopaths, and it hurts, to hear them discuss what I am, without them realising its me, and to speak so negatively.”
They thought she would be the perfect fit?
No, they didn’t have time to stare at the man sitting opposite them, they needed to work on their paper. They dragged their eyes away from Dean and forced themself to continue writing.
Den rolled his eyes as he finished putting his shoes on, "just out Sammy. Even if I did tell you, it's not like you'd believe me anyway."
Literally.
Lisa muttered quietly under her breath, "Damn they would have been good together."
Sam had known Professor Novak, Cas, since they started dating his older brother. Dean was ten years older than Sam and had been dating Cas for almost longer than Sam could remember.
They really should say yes, or tell the person to find a new seat far away from them, they prefer studying alone and they don’t even know this person.
"Sam," Mary called from the kitchen, can you get that, we're kinda busy in here."
Sighing again, because they really didn’t want to do the paper, they pulled their coffee cup closer, gulping down one last, long sip, and opened their laptop.
“Heyyyyyyyy Cas.” Dean started, “You’re realllllly beautiful. Did you know that.”
Gabe: I swear he loves you more than me sometimes.
"Oh," Cas continued, "some of my students asked me a really odd question today. I don't know why?"
Dean just laughed, his forehead falling to Cas’ shoulder, “We’re idiots.” Dean said with a smile, “We could have been together so much sooner if we just spoke about our feelings.”
---------
"Hey Sammy," Dean said with a smile as he walked into the classroom. "You left your text book here."
Asexuality is the lack of sexual attraction to others, or low or absent interest in or desire for sexual activity. It may be considered a sexual orientation or the lack thereof.
Cas took their hand under the table in silent support.
Sam had almost forgotten about Marve and Lisa until he heard whispering from the front row. "You should ask them now." Marve hissed, elbowing Lisa sharply. "Go on. I dare you."
Because the whole reason he'd never shown Sammy a picture before was right in front of him.
This time Marve started, "Professor, do you know Professor Hanscum?" She asked, a seemingly innocent expression on her face.
“Sorry Sammy,” Dean shrugged, “Their brother needed them to cover his shift at work, what can I say man, they’re so sorry not to be able to meet you this time, hopefully they can make it next time.” They both climbed into the impala and Dean started driving down the road, driving home.
Gabe: I can always make time for you deano. ;))
'Her.' Dean had never used any gendered pronouns for Cas, because they prefer gender neutral pronouns, but Sam straight away assumed they were a girl. Stupid hetronormative society.
He shrugged as he threw his books into his locker, “Her name is Cas. Apparently.”
“We, um” Dean started, “We match,” He gestured to his own computer as he spoke and Cas noticed the stickers, a Spiderman trans sticker just like theirs. He also had a pair of cowboy boots in the bi flag colour and a piece of pie saying “Pie is better than sex” in ace colours.
Garth: I supposed we have to wait until he either admits it, or she finally turns up.
“Deeeeean, whyyyyyyyy," They gasped out in between laughs, “Thank you, for making me feel better.”
He was still trying to figure Cas out.
Cas had been excitedly planning their plan, how to get Dean into their classroom and if Sam wanted to be included in the reveal.
Cas' flashed a shy grin up at Dean, "maybe next week then? I got my last test score back today and I only lost two marks, my parents aren't happy but they decided so long as I do better next time they won't ground me."
“Good, ‘cause I can be a lot more romantic than that.”
) and. . .knocked.
“Oh? Do you enjoy it when I speak in perfectly structured sentences, Dean?”
Cas had been an odd angel. As it turned out, he made a pretty weird toddler too.
The lines around Dean’s mouth, which had tightened at the mention of hunting, smoothed away as he grinned.
“I don’t know, just - I saw his door open and his room was empty. . . so I thought he went back to heaven, y’know? Or something, I guess.” Dean studiously kept his eyes on his empty coffee cup as he answered.
Dean was so focused on Cas’ face that he nearly brained Sam with his shotgun when he popped up on the other side of the cot.
Dean merely gawped at him. His mind had been slowly travelling down the thorny paths of ‘Does he mean. . . Does that mean. . .?’ and that final question had made it crash into the mental equivalent of a hedge.
Dean felt bile rise in his throat at the image. He swallowed heavily, then looked over at the demon.
Manny had never been able to decide if it was truly his wife’s influence that had made Jimmy cut back on their monthly board game nights and random weekday lunches, or if he had just wanted a plausible excuse to distance himself from the brother who embarrassed him at company parties.
Somehow, Cas managed to sound threatening when he ground out, “I am
Sam sighed, but this time it was Cas who spoke up.
Sam interrupted Dean’s musing of
“Wait, does that mean - you can’t sense anything weird? There’s no, I dunno, magical residue or aura or something around them?”
Sam: First she was grounded.
Jo: Is that the best he’s got?
Cas' eyes snapped over to Dean and their expression instantly lightened. "Hello Dean."
----------
They waited until everyone had food and was eating, and then decided they had procrastinated enough.
Dean smirked at him from across the room, walking closer to Cas. "And why's that Sammy."
Dean sunk fully into his embrace, “I think, I think I want to tell Sam. About being Biro-Ace, and being enby, and about using they/them pronouns.”
Shaking his head he dragged himself out of his musing, grabbing his book out his locker, “I’ll see you guys later, I have to get to chemistry.”
Dean was their first kiss, but he was also their first hug.
Sam laughed, “Next you’ll be telling me you don’t like sex.”
Pulling out their phone they considered not for the first time whether cancelling would be better. Dean would be disappointed but wouldn’t he be more disappointed if they embarrassed him in front of everyone at the party?
Sam: Guess we’ll have to wait.
Slowly he creaked open the door, letting out a sigh of relief when there was an unarmed Garbiel on the other side.
Sam was not surprised to find out he was right. Almost as soon as they stepped through the doors into the safety of their home Cas was glued to Dean’s side.
Jo: So, did she turn up?
Dean was in a much better mood when he made it home, Cas never failed to make him feel better.
Sam was trying so hard not to laugh, this was it. "You're not fooling anyone. I know the real reason you're here."
"Wait what?" Sam asked, confused, "off where?"
This could go so wrong.
Now that Lisa and Marve had realised Cas did not, in fact, need their help to find a partner, they had moved on to their next victim, who luckily was not married.
He pulled them tightly into his side and they just sat there for a few minutes, Dean with his face resting on top of Cas' fluffy hair.
And then, sitting in the dark room with Dean a warm weight against their side and the film quietly playing on the tv, Cas suddenly realised they had caught feelings for their best friend.
There were a few mumbled answers, a few yesses, a few nos and a whole lot of indistinguishable groaning.
Sam: The fourth.
The speaker looked to be a person around their age, holding a giant stack of engineering text books. Cas couldn’t see them from behind the text books but they didn’t recognise the voice so it was probably a stranger.
After that first day, Dean and Cas became fast friends.
Dean looked between them, looking bemused, "what did they ask babe?"
It was quarter to six and they had no idea what to wear. They hadn’t really been to a party before, but they’d promised Dean, they couldn’t pull out now. They couldn’t let him down. He was their best friend.
It was nearly time.
Gabriel furrowed his brow, "I don't have a sister."
Dean smiled at his phone happy to see Cas being confident. When they first started dating they would flinch away from compliments and had very low self esteem. They still had bad days, but they were working on it.
-------
Sam didn't really know what they were talking about, but he did know Marve and Lisa had been working together to set up teachers all around the school for weeks. He enjoyed sitting in English and listening to their plotting.
"Maybe I did." Dean leaned against Cas' desk, turning towards them, "any excuse to see my beautiful partner."
-------
Lisa shrugged, "I guess we could ask if they like anyone on staff? Say we are trying to figure out if the English department all get along? I don’t know, just think of something."
Asexual
"Hey Cas?" Sam asked, turning from where he sat on the chair to look towards Cas who was cuddling with Dean on the sofa. "You could have just told the girls you were married. It obviously makes you uncomfortable, so why didn't you stop them?"
He thought that would be the end of it, but of course he underestimated the sheet power of two teenage girls on a mission. The very next English lesson they were back at it again.
Sam didn't even try to stop his momentum as he threw his head into his hands with a slam. "Ugh don't remind me."
"Their shift over ran slightly, they'll be here soon." Gabe supplied.
Cas just snuggled closer, "surprisingly enough, I don't want to go out with anyone else. I'm quite happy here thanks."
It wasn’t brought up again for a while, Dean was still trying to process the new names he suddenly had for the parts of them they always thought were broken, they were still trying to process the fact they apparently weren’t broken at all. Cas was content to let them have all the time they needed to get their head round their identity, but always made sure they knew they weren’t alone.
They made eye contact from across the room and Sam made his way over. Luckily he already knew what he wanted to do with his future, so he didn't need to pay attention to the fair.
Dean smiled happily from his perch on the porch at the sight of his partner and brother laughing together. After a rather messy beginning they had really hit it off, they were both such nerds.
------
Marve took over, leaning forward in her chair, "we were wondering if you had to take Professor Alder out for a meal, where would you take him?"
------
Dean groaned. "What did he do this time?" Safe to say, no one in the Winchester/Novak household liked Zachariah Alder.
Now that got a real reaction from the students.
Sam nodded, "Hi I'm Sam, and I'm this idiot's brother." He stuck his hand out.
Jo: Idk man, if she exists why did we only start hearing about her a few months ago, why have we never met her before, how come we only learnt her name this morning.
-------
Just a little longer.
"He doesn't." Dean said with a sigh. "Cas isn't his sister, they're his sibling. His sibling who is late?" He directed his question toward Gabriel.
"That makes Sam," the boy started.
"Hey Dean," Cas said, a mischievous smirk on their face. "Aren't you coming in for the career fair next week?"
Sam could already guess what he was going to say, “Let me guess, Cas very sadly just called last minute to cancel on us. Just like last time, and the time before that.”
“Great, I’ll pick you up from your room at 6.”
10 minutes.
Dean: yeah Gabe, listen to your sibling. They're the only one for me.
Dean just blinked at him, staying quiet. He didn’t know, he couldn’t know, not about that. Could he?
A knock on the classroom door broke the silence of hard working students.
It just didn’t make sense, if Cas is homeschooled, how did Dean meet her.
Gabriel had got an A in Biology, and his parents decided it just wasn't acceptable so he had been grounded until his grades were back up. That left Cas to cover his shifts at the shop.
Almost.
Gabe: and then make sure Dean was being loyal to you.
"Hello Dean," the boy- Cas? Cas was a boy? -said walking into his arms for a hug.
"Thanks Mum." He thanked her while pulling out his phone, pulling up his group chat with Cas and Gabe.
------
"Heya Cas," Dean said with a smile as he came closer.
Maybe, maybe they weren’t alone. Maybe they weren’t broken.
Really not soon enough. The girls again started talking about who the perfect partner would be.
Dean just smirked and messed his hair up, "Sure Sammy."
------
Cas had had enough, “Sam.” He nearly shouted, voice stern, “Listen to your sibling or so help me, I will make you.” His voice left no room for argument, “Carry on Dean,” He said at a much more reasonable volume.
“Hey, no Cas I like talking to you, sorry, just a bit of a sore subject.” He sighed before continuing, “My mum took it really well, she pretty much worked it out before I did, it was my dad who was a bit more of a problem. He wasn’t the most accepting. In the end I just figured I could wait for him to accept me, or I could move on.”
“I’ll go tell Sam food is ready, you just breathe, it’ll be ok. I promise.” Cas said reassuringly, pulling them into a hug and dropping a kiss on their forehead.
They saw the confusion blooming on Sam’s face, he didn’t get it.
A boy from the back was the first one to pick his jaw up from the floor enough to ask a question, "Wait, aren't you Sam's brother."
Marve just laughed, "we're not that desperate, not yet. Also I don't think the engineering guy would be a good fit for Professor Novak."
“I’m sorry, truely, I wish there was something I could say to them to make them see they’re wrong. But just remember you're not alone, you have me, and my parents, and Sam, probably, once I convince him you are real.” This drew a shaky laugh from Cas.
“Yes? You, you love me?” Dean loved them. Dean. Loved. Them.
Dean fake gasped,  "I try to do a nice thing for my baby brother and this is the thanks I get. I came all the way here for you."
Cas sat up straighter in their seat, turning towards Lisa with a smile. "Yes Lisa?"
Garth: Maybe she actually does have work?
That's where Cas found themself one Monday evening, working on their English paper in the back corner. It was their favourite seat, close enough to the coffee shop for easy access, but far enough away not to get distracted by the sounds drifting from the café.
“I think we should discuss this in the morning,” They said softly, brushing their hand through his hair, “And I think I should probably get you home now.”
He threw his hands up in the air, "Exactly what I thought."
Dean smirked at them, "actually no. Since I came to this here fair. I'm free now."
“That’s because they don’t go to this school,” Dean commented, appearing behind her to get to his locker. “They are homeschooled. Their parents are very… strict. Want them to be a certain way.” He looked down, lost in thought, “They’re perfect I just wish their parents saw that.”
"You deserve all the love in the world."
“Apparently he doesn’t believe in what he can’t see.” Dean laughed, a confused smile on his face. “He’s going to hate it when he starts to learn about atoms.”
"Mummy said that I was so good this week, we can have ice-cream for pudding!" She was almost bouncing out her seat in excitement.
Jo looked between the two in confusion but decided not to mention it. "So. How did you meet?"
"They both said they'll be there, so hopefully nothing will come up." Dean informed Mary who smiled happily. She really did love Gabe and Cas like her own children.
"You know you don't have to ask," Mary said, shaking her head at him, "they are always welcome here."
It was only an hour later, and two pages through their paper, when Cas got pulled away from writing by a voice, “Hey is this seat taken?”
He just shot them a fond smile, “Of course, I love you Sunshine. Don't ever change. You're perfect."
Dean laughed as he caught on what his spouse was planning, "I like the way you think sweetheart," he chucked, pulling Cas in for a kiss.
Sam talked to Dean for a bit longer, staying at his table while the others made their way slowly round the hall.
Cas looked confused for a minute before answering slowly, "I know she teaches law."
Sam sighed, anger flowing through his veins, “You know. Something is starting to make me think you made her up. She always cancels at the last minute. We can make plans weeks before and she will still find some way to pull up, this time a job shift, last month it was tonsillitis, what's next? The plague? Honestly Dean, just say you lied. I’m getting sick of your half assed lies.”
And although hearing them try to set people up was annoying, he really didn’t need to hear who the sexiest person in school was or how to lock teachers in a room together to get them to talk, it was nice not to hear who “the perfect partner for professor Novak” was, after all, they had already found him, and they were happy together.
Charlie wacked Dean on the arm, hard.
Dean struggled for a moment with what to say, whether to tell the truth or to lie, he eventually decided to bite the bullet, "Cas. Cas and Gabriel are coming over next Saturday for the barbecue."
Jo: too many things don't add up.
They glanced at the pile of clothes on their bed; jeans, suits, dresses, skirts, clothes in all colours of the spectrum and beyond. They must have something. Anything.
“Hey Cas, Do you want to come to Benny’s party tonight?” They got pulled out of their thoughts as Dean kicked their feet from the other side of the table.
Cas took a deep breath in. Here goes nothing. “Did you mean it?” Ducking their head they forced Dean to make eye contact with them. “Did you mean what you said?”
Drunk words are sober thoughts right?
Was Cas right, were they Biromantic, Asexual, Non binary?
He flinched as he got clipped around the head by his Dad, “He don’t be mean, you don't know the full story.”
“And yet her life never seems to line up with ours, you sure she isn’t just dating you for a laugh, she never makes time for you.” He knew he had gone too far, even before Dean slammed his brakes on, pulling the impala to a stop at the side of the road.
“Sam,” They said, voice not as strong as they wished it was, “I’m not a guy.”
"Hi Dean," Gabriel said with a nod in his direction.
People didn't know Cas and Sam were siblings as it just never seemed important to bring up. Cas treated him like any other student. They had always been his sibling, but had become his legal sibling two years before when Cas and Dean had finally got married.
Mary looked over with a sad smile, “Because it's true.”
"My day was kind of boring," Sam replied, "I had a math test, learned about molecules in chemistry. Not much happened."
Sam was confused. Cas is a boy? Cas is a boy? "Cas is a boy?"
Cas: Ha everyone loves me.
"They. They aren't a boy." Dean corrected, still holding Cas close to his side.
Did they? Not really, parties weren’t really their scene. But Dean had that look on his face, and they could never say no to him. “Sure.”
"My brother in law, yes," Cas finished.
Cas looked rather shocked at the question, and they stared at her for a few moments, blinking in confusion. They tilted their head to the side, tapping a rhythm on their desk. "Yes?" They answered, still sounding confused. "He is my colleague and I work with him. Why do you ask."
Of course, the best part of everyone now knowing Cas had a husband, was the lack of whispering from the seats in front of him in english.
He also didn’t hold much stake in her coming round after school, every time he had tried to meet her in the past something always came up, Dean making excuses for why his girlfriend always cancelled at the last minute.
Above Sam the bell rang and he and his friends all scrambled to class, but he couldn’t concentrate, why would he listen to his teacher ramble on about matrices when he could try to solve the hardest problem of the year. Cas.
Sam shook his head at them fondly. This would be fun.
“He still doesn’t believe I exist?” Cas asked, wiping their tears away. Dean had told them before about Sam’s disbelief in their existence and it always made them laugh.
Garth nodded his head to the side, weighing up the option, "he seems very smitten, which I'm not sure he's good enough of an actor to fake, although the fact none of us have ever met her is a big red flag in the possibility of her existence." He continued to ponder his options, "Meh, could go either way." He eloquently finished.
“Noooo Cassssssssssssss,” Dean groaned out, grabbing at their hand, “Don’t leave meee,”
"Thanks, Dean." A pause, then "thank you, for everything. For giving me a family I can actually turn to, a family that actually loves me."
Lisa glared at her but nevertheless slowly raised her hand into the air. "Professor?" Lisa asked, sounding slightly unsure.
“Wh- what?” Dean didn’t kiss them, but he didn’t pull back either, his eyes were filled with confusion, as if he’d heard them but couldn’t compute their words.
------
“I. I don’t. Well, I don’t hate it, but I don’t crave it, or even want it all that much. I’m a biromantic asexual non binary.”
"Alright class, have a good weekend and I will see you all next week."
“Dean said anything more about this girlfriend of his?” Jo asks as soon as he’s in ear shot. All his friends knew about Dean’s imaginary girlfriend, although none of them had ever seen her either.
Sam rolled his eyes, “Apparently she had a shift at work. A very convenient shit at work.”
“No but-” They tried again, but Sam interrupted again, “No stop it Dean, I thought you had got over this, stop being sexist.”
But one night, while cuddling in bed, Cas finally confronted them. “Why do you hide who you are? You are beautiful, all of you.”
Sam stared at them for a bit, “What do you mean you aren’t a man, of course you are.”
“Why do you hurt yourself by forcing yourself to sleep with people you feel nothing for. Why do you hide behind a fake person when who you are truly is so perfect. why do you hide the beautiful soul of yours Dean Winchester.”
Cas, sweet, oblivious, darling Cas, just looked confused. "Why am I taking him out to dinner? Are we having a lunch meeting?"
"Ow," he whined pitifully, what was that for."
If Cas was real, how come he didn’t know what she looked like, how come he didn’t know how old she was, didn’t even know her eye colour, her eye colour, anything.
Cas smiled up at Dean before turning to the class, "This is my husband Dean."
Sam stepped aside as a group of his class came up to Dean's table to talk about engineering, keeping his distance so Dean could actually do the job he was there for.
Dean was his brother. Did he not trust him? Was he that untrustworthy? They always told each other everything. Why didn’t Dean trust him with this?
Cas sat up straighter, pulling out of Dean's embrace slightly. Dean let out a grunt of annoyance at losing his personal heater. "If I told them I was married. They'd want to know all about my husband. And they would eventually figure out his surname and they would ask about why you share a surname. I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable or have to tell the other students you're my brother." Cas looked over at him seriously, face alight with passion. "I wouldn't do that to you without asking first."
-----
It was worth it to see Dean’s face light up with a smile.
"I love you Sunshine."
Fair.
A biromantic, asexual person is romantically attracted to people of multiple genders, but experiences little to no sexual attraction.
Sam was pulled away from his phone by the sound of his parents car pulling into the drive and his parents bustling into the kitchen with shopping bags.
“Yes,” John started hesitantly, “We met them a few weeks ago at the shop they work at, Dean introduced us then.”
Now eighteen he lived in a small house with Dean and Cas, studying at the local college. Dean, now twenty eight, was an engineer and Cas was an English teacher at Sam's college.
It had been a long day and Sam was happy to be home. He threw his shoes to the shoe rack and dragged himself up stairs, yelling out hello to Dean. He threw his bag onto his bed and then went to find his brother.
The Campus library really was a god send for over worked, stressed students who had things to get done.
The careers fair was finally upon them. Sam was happy that after today he wouldn't have to listen to Lisa and Marve planning on setting his sibling up with teachers from all around the school.
Dean was in the kitchen cooking tea, Cas glued to his side, their face buried in his neck. Cas was always clingy, but especially so after a long day of school.
---------
"He was wearing a pin that said ‘fuck your pronouns’," Cas replied with a grimace. "He even came into my classroom to show it off."
“So we do,” Cas smiled slightly at Dean, “I hope your parents were more accepting than mine.” At Dean’s wince Cas realised they may have overstepped, “Sorry, I’m not known for my social skills, we can talk about something else,” Stupid, why would Dean want to talk to them at all, “or nothing at all, if you don’t want. You came here to work” They were rambling, “I should let you work,” They finished quickly, trailing off at the end.
"And they," Sam wondered back over to Dean, "are the girls trying to set your spouse up with seemingly any teacher at this school."
Benny: What were the reasons?
Soon.
Cas took it and shook it, "nice to meet you Sam, I'm Castiel, although most people call me Cas, and I'm this idiot's partner."
“It’s just…”  Cas continued, “I always wonder what would happen if my parents actually cared, or at least accepted me and Gabe for who we are. Gabe having a boyfriend, me dating you, me being non binary, shouldn’t change how they feel about us. I just… I wish they loved me.” Their tears were flowing faster now.
They saw his flaws, his problems and downfalls and loved him.
"Wow," Dean said with an exaggerated gasp, "you must have been a really good girl then."
“I understand you don’t love me back, it's fine, I don’t mind, just please don’t cut me off, I love you, but you’re also my best friend. I couldn’t bear to lose you because I was drunk and I didn’t hide it. We can ignore it and never mention it again, I promise it’ll go away, I’ll make it go away, I-”
He didn’t know what to make of it.
Benny: SAM
Their plan was surprisingly simple.
"Because they are a very busy, very important person and," he looked over at Cas and seeing the hesitation on their face quickly added, "I wanted them all for myself."
The lesson flew by and everyone did indeed finish their work before the end of the lesson, leading to Cas letting them all talk for the last 15 minutes of class.
------
They finished stacking the shelf and walked back to the counter. Dean followed them. He would follow them anywhere.
Dean just laughed, “If I’m not wearing it, you’re welcome to it.”
Jo: What’s she like?
Cas smiled slightly, “I’m glad your mum accepted you.” They dragged their coffee towards them, taking a sip of the now cold drink, they didn’t particularly like cold coffee, but caffeine is caffeine. “I actually,” They stared at the table, not wanting to see Dean’s expression when they told him, “I actually never came out to my family.”
They hid the fact that they weren’t a dude. They hid the fact that although they didn’t mind he/him pronouns, they didn’t make them happy in the same way they/them did. He/him just wasn't, it wasn’t quite them. They hid behind exaggerated gender norms and a fake macho man persona.
"You could have just given it to me at home." Sam shook his head.
They had started dating his brother in college when Sam was only seven and they and Dean had practically raised him after his father died in a car accident when he was nine, seven years before.
Cas looked down, catching on to what was happening quicker this time. "She and her wife live near me. So yes, she is my friend."
“Take that back or get out.” He hissed. “They have a hard life. Harder than you can understand. They don’t have the freedom you have always had. It’s not my place to say, not my place to explain. I love them and they love me. So live with that or move on.”
Cas was frozen, Dean was hugging them, they hadn't been hugged in ages, but slowly they returned the hug, pulling him closer and wrapping their arms around his waist. It was nice.
The girls never got to answer because just then the bell rang, cutting to conversation short.
Mary and John all flinched slightly, so slightly Sam almost missed it, and he just passed it off as them being surprised as being called out.
Jo scoffed, “What sort of a name is that?”
Cas had started the lesson on the English text.
Charlie: SAM
Sam wanted so bad to shut them up, to tell them the truth just to make them stop. But he couldn't. Not yet. Only half an hour. It would all be worth it in the end.
Non-binary is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine—identities that are outside the gender binary.
They were just grabbing their phone to check the time when they heard the sound of the impala pulling up outside their dorm block. No going back now.
Dean seemed to finally pull himself out of his stupor as he surged forward, pulling cas into a kiss.
"What do you mean?" Sam was confused why would them telling the class he was married make him uncomfortable?
Hunters responded to that warning rather differently. Sam’s eyes met Dean’s, which were alert and awake again.
“Yes. . . no, wait, I meant - yes?” Manny had never wanted to duct tape his mouth shut more than he did then.
“Yeah, about that -” Sam was interrupted by Crowley, who had been steadily edging closer to a horrified Dean during his mother’s monologue.
He must have dozed off, because the next thing he knew, Dean was shaking him awake. “Come on Manny, time to get to bed.”
“Excuse me ma’am, do you require assistance?”
Cas, even in toddler mode, seemed to have a knack for knowing when Dean was spiralling into self-loathing.
“Hello Sam.” Even in a voice higher than his own, the inflection was undoubtedly Cas'. He was smaller than Dean, around four maybe. In his ankle-length white shirt, he looked as solemn as ever, regardless of his chubby cheeks and fluffed-up hair.
Dean was still untangling that, trying to figure out if it meant what he thought (hoped!) it did, when Cas turned to face him. He looked determined.
“I hope you’re not implying what I think you’re implying.”
becoming on you.”
to say that wasn’t
“No thanks to those stumpy twigs of yours.”
He looked. . . cute, Dean decided. Well, actually he thought Cas looked adorable, but fortunately that train of thought was interrupted before it could get any further.
That wasn’t out of the ordinary for him. Ordinarily the victims of his clumsiness would either smile awkwardly at his attempts at apology or call him a few creative names, before invariably turning away.
Cas had then proceeded to carefully add up every coin, before plopping them into the fountain one after the other.
Manny tilted his head to the side. “Do you often flirt with strangers on the subway?”
He started up his car with a smile. It was nice to know that he was still capable of making friends.
The bitch smirked. “Had a nice chat?”
But no, Sam continued listening to ‘Shake it Off’ and thus remained blissfully ignorant for another forty-two seconds. It was during the opening chords of ‘Fight Song’ that he felt a tug on his jeans leg and automatically looked down.
“Something wrong?” Dean jumped, before continuing to read whatever message had upset him.
Rowena in his kitchen. Two for the price of one. Yay.
“We were yelling ourselves hoarse down there! Where the hell were you?”
After a successful negotiation for sundaes - Cas had been transfixed by the sight of a teenager fixing hers - the three returned to the children's department store on the first floor.
Dean’s visible horror at this bit of news brought her smile back, bigger than ever. “Sammy never mention that to his big bro? Wow. Guess that raises the stakes a bit, huh?”
They had worked their way through each floor of the three-storey building. The corridors were narrow with four separate rooms on each floor, most of them completely empty.
Sam hummed non committedly. Cas, human or otherwise, could polish fine china with one hand while fending off a horde of demons with the other, but Sam didn’t offer up this little nugget. He knew what was coming.
By the time Baby pulled up to the fourth and last factory, Dean was paper-white and staring blankly out the windshield. He only stirred at the soft clang of Sam’s door closing, then trudged silently behind him to the rusted sign labelled ‘Heavy machinery inside. Proceed with caution.'
Said gorgeous hunk seemed to pull himself together at that.
True, some of his current discontent could be attributed to the woman in line behind him, who kept poking his hip with her plastic poinsettias. But the majority of it was due to Castiel and Dean Winchester, who had disappeared from view for the nth time that afternoon.
“I like lollipops,” he murmured.
“I merely asked if I could help you with something, Dean.” Cas lifted out what looked like a jumbo-sized Easter egg from the chest, but his gaze remained fixed on Dean.
He followed the sniffling and soft murmuring to a rack of mini army-style jackets. Cas was nestled in the bottom most layer with his arm around a blond boy a tad bigger than him.
He managed to sneak a photo of the woman pinching Dean’s cheek.
All of that was okay, because for the first time Dean realised that he actually had a chance with his angel.
The girl hummed as she made up his total. “Kids are weird, aren’t they?”
He learned that he didn’t like talking about his family, because of the way he slammed his front door in Manny’s next-door neighbor’s face when she asked about them.
Of course.
The lift their childhood antics gave his mood was brief, however, lasting only until Jimmy sped away in his Prius.
Sam’s question, although seemingly casual, was actually carefully thought out and worded. This was the long-awaited next step in the mating ritual between the Cluelessly Pining Angel and the Foot-In-Mouth Hunter. Sam planned to take copious notes in between snickering like a loon.
“There you go.” Dean smiled approvingly. Cas patted Jordan’s arm to get his attention.
As he dodged shoppers, he told himself it didn’t matter that it had been almost thirty minutes since he had last seen Cas.
“Remember this Jordan, because it’s very important. You may offer those to Lily and promise her your undying love and eternal loyalty.” Dean grinned when he noticed Jordan mouthing the words after Cas.
“Which are?” Dean had now passed
“So. Uh, where’s he at?” Dean’s attempt at nonchalance would have been pathetic if it wasn’t so adorable.
He reminded himself that Rowena had picked up the joke sphere last week. He and Cas were both six-feet tall again - or nearly, anyway; Cas remained shorter than him.
After Dean had scrubbed through the devil’s trap, he touched the demon’s arm before it could leave.
“I’ve got the artifact that did it over here.” Sam lifted the plastic baggie containing the gold sphere off the table. Rowena merely murmured a distracted-sounding “That’s fine Samuel,” before lifting her arms.
“No - I don’t - why?” He managed a somewhat coherent question while his brain was still buffering.
The two Winchesters continued glaring at each other.
Dean gritted his teeth. “Fine,” he growled. “Five years then.” He was getting desperate and the demon could tell, because she smiled.
She then proceeded to drag him downstairs to show off her workplace. Apparently, she worked in the firm’s IT department, though Manny wasn’t certain exactly what her job entailed. Her desk was cluttered with action figures, with one lone bobblehead doll standing tall over them. Manny was relieved to be able to recognise her as Hermione; Charlie was delighted to learn that they both agreed the books were much better than the movies.
He closed his eyes and turned over, burrowing his face into the duvet to dry the wetness on it.
“Dean?” His voice was very small. The boy huffed.
Something about the demon’s phrasing niggled at Dean. “What do you mean, my soul for Sam’s? Hell doesn’t have his soul.”
Enjoy!
Dean reminded himself. He inhaled deeply, then strained his ears to hear anything that sounded like. . . there.
“Why does that not surprise me?” Manny raised his beer in a cheesy toast and gulped it down.
“Nah, I got it covered. Thanks Sammy.” With that, Dean lifted up the excess material of his flannel over the coins and vanished into the crowd.
Now Dean was huddled into a tiny ball on a chair outside an office. Sam had disappeared inside with the command to
The demon sighed impatiently, turning back around to face him. “Well, of course he’s not topside
They had even sent out a store-wide announcement through the mall speaker system, courtesy of mall security.
“That you’ll take Sam’s place in Hell and that Sam will come back. Never said
“So I’ve heard. Frequently.” As far as first words to gorgeous hunks went it wasn't an
“His crush rejected the plastic flowers he offered her for her hand in marriage. Lily then informed him that she planned to marry Thor when she grew up.”
It was nice while it lasted.
She gave him a wrinkly smile. “Oh thank you, young man, I do think that might be for the best, these stores are so
“Uh, Rowena, if we could just focus. . .” Sam’s voice was understandably wary, and Rowena straightened immediately.
Dean stopped moving to take a good look at his oldest friend.
He had no doubt that that was what had happened. Cas would never have left Sam and Dean voluntarily, especially not when Dean was still so vulnerable.
that did it? But nooo, Dean Winchester didn’t get the legendary sword or the cursed idol. Instead, he got a ball that was, according to Rowena, the magical equivalent of itching powder.
(As it turned out, his brother had a lovely soprano. Sam’s only regret was that he had failed to record it.)
“Hey there.” Dean made sure to gentle his voice. He remembered how jumpy older kids had made him at that age.
“Oh, sorry. . .” Sam shook his head to reorient himself. The worry still bubbled away under his skin, before it was overtaken by another out-of-the-blue thought.
Jordan pursed his lips and squinched his nose in deep thought. “Um. Candy?”
Sam kept one eye on the coils of violet light that she wound around Cas’ body while he addressed Crowley.
Dean coughed. “Uh, come again, Cas?”
A lot of things had changed after Amelia.
“No, 'cause you’re the. . . one who’s implying. . .
During the next two hours, the only sounds were the scuffing of their boots on the floor amid the odd “Where’s this one go?” and “Chuck, this is disgusting.”
And once the both of them were awesome-size again, boy was he going to take it.
Dean gave a jerky nod. “Let’s get back to the bunker.”
The demon looked genuinely surprised. “You think Heaven would touch a soul tainted with demon blood? You Winchesters really are delusional.”
“I’m not particularly religious, if that’s what you’re implying.” Manny mopped up the sauce on his plate with his garlic bread, hoping that wasn’t a dealbreaker.
The events that followed could have been lifted from the script of a nineties comedy show.
Cas was now holding the small lollipop bouquet he had spent nearly two hours perfecting (he may or may not have accepted pity advice from Sam on how to tie them together, but that was beside the point).
“Cas is lookin’ at the fountain again.” Sam could barely hear Dean’s mumbling but when he did, he smirked.
He woke up cuffed to a bed.
Because Cas liked him.
Last chapter!
“You’re my brother Jimmy, not a guest. And you’re only four minutes older, not years, so give it a rest.”
“Nothing,” Dean assured him. “Just,” he paused, as if to select the right words. “You don’t really look like a ‘Manny’, you know?” He gestured towards him with his hand.
Which was why he was currently gaping like a fish.
He felt like he had been living in a shiny soap-bubble for the last few hours, and then that bubble had popped to reveal his real world - one where the Winchesters’ kid angel couldn’t stroll through a mall without getting snatched.
Dean toed the floor in front of door number 27 with a distinct sense of deja vu.
“Hello lovelies.”
That didn’t stop him from wanting to kick door number 27 in its smug little face. It was taunting him, he could tell.
“That an invitation, sweetheart?” His voice was low and tickled up Manny’s spine. That, combined with the tongue Dean darted out to lick his lower lip, had Manny leaping out of his chair.
This man seemed poised to take door number one - before his green eyes widened and his jaw dropped.
“Looks like there’s been a change in plans, Dean,” the demon purred. “My boss seems to have a soft spot for you. I’ve been authorised to offer you a one-time-only deal.”
“Anyway. Screw her. If Hell ain’t gonna do it, I’m gonna find another way. You just hang in there, ‘kay?”
“We donated almost twenty dollars, Dean!”
“You’re gonna change that deal and bring Sam back
Dean wriggled in his seat.
“We’re all good to go, just need Cas. Where is he anyway?”
Now, Dean looked as if he were preparing to storm a castle instead of going downstairs to see his angel. After fifteen minutes of psyching himself up - Sam discretely timed it - Dean nodded decisively and got to his feet.
She smiled at him again, amused by his obvious confusion.
So it took Dean a while to come up with, “Marshmallows?”
The homey little restaurant had been Dean’s choice. It wasn’t what Manny would have picked for a first date, but he had to admit that the interior was nice, with quaint wooden tables covered by checkered tablecloths and dim gold lighting.
He glanced behind him to make sure he still had the miniature happy couple in tow, and relaxed when he spotted them chatting with a lost-looking grandma.
to a boat named
He hoped Dean didn’t think about it either but he knew that was a fool’s hope. Especially after the first, and then the second and third potential sites turned up bupkis.
“Um no, not really,” Dean hedged, trying not to call to mind a certain something he’d really like ‘help’ with. “Just, uh, Sam said you were down here so I thought maybe, y’know, that I could help with the organising and stuff?”
Rowena said I’ll be back to normal in half that time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He knocked and a deep, slightly muffled voice from within called out, “Come in.”
“Will let you live your life before we come to collect, yeah. Your soul for Sammy’s. Like I said, it’s a one-time offer. And the clock’s ticking, kiddo. So. . . we got a deal?”
Thoughts like these had become so commonplace that Manny barely batted an eye at them as he sipped his mocha cappuccino. Even if his throat did feel tight for a few moments.
Dean had just drawn breath for an extremely overdue rant about how he was
Maybe Mondays could be good days after all.
Cas ‘hmm’ed beside him. He looked pensive.
“Hey Cas?”
Manny sighed. “Yes mother?”
Dean kept glancing at Cas out of the corner of his eye. Every so often he would catch Cas doing the same, then the both of them would look away and blush.
“Sure I will, pipsqueak.”
He clasped his hands around Cas’ face. “Cas? Buddy, can you hear me?”
Crowley gave a shark-like grin. “Adult or not, I could pick Squirrel’s scowl out of a lineup, Moose.”
“Give me that!” The younger Winchester lunged across the table. A short scuffle followed in which Sam’s arm length proved superior. Satisfied, he dropped back into his seat with the offending writing instrument in hand.
He kept muttering as he formed a fist for the seventeenth time (no he wasn’t counting,
She paused to wink at him. “You should be honored, you know. Crowley’s dealt with kings and emperors, and you’re getting bigger perks than any of them ever did.”
He learned about his devotion to Metallica and Led Zeppelin, because they were blasted out into the neighborhood every time the man got out of his car after a drive.
“Ask you out?” Dean shrugged and leaned back on his couch. “Yeah, I did. Is that a no?”
Enjoy!
At that, Dean rolled his eyes and gestured to his right. Sam slowly leaned back in his chair to look around the corner of the table. . . and met a pair of brilliant blue eyes.
When he returned after actually using the toilet and splashing his face with water, Dean was frowning down at his phone screen.
Dean grinned boyishly. “Awesome,” he announced. “I’ll pick you up at seven tomorrow night, okay?”
“I’d very much appreciate that, Dean. There are extra suits over there.” Dean obediently trotted over to the lumpy pile and began pulling one on.
Rowena’s eyes widened. She glanced between Sam and the kids, obviously trying to make sense of what she had just heard. “But. . . those. . . they’re
Desperate for distraction, Dean fished around in the ‘uncursed object’ crate next to him. His fingers closed around something smooth and round, and he held it up in Cas’ face. “What do you think this is?”
This prior knowledge was probably the only thing that kept him from breaking down when Sam reappeared with a grim face.
“I’d like that, Manny.” Dean’s voice sounded wistful, but Manny was too happy to take much notice of it. His usual anxiety and insecurities had quieted sometime during the date, and the silence in his mind was peaceful. He melted into the passenger seat and yawned.
“C’mon Sammy, move move
scattered throughout the narrative.
“Just to clarify.” She moved close enough to Dean to place a hand on his chest, looking up at him through her eyelashes. Her smile was sly. “Sammy back, you live a good long life before taking his place. One brother for the other. Deal?”
Content warning for moderately graphic depiction of branding and non-graphic mention of animal death.
Sam sighed, clicked the pen still in his hand and returned to paragraph five.
Unfortunately, that interruption was the sound of the bunker’s door opening. Which right now, could only mean one thing.
Sam reminded Dean of their agreed-upon ground rules -
It was now his turn to flush.
Or. . . not. Evidently it could mean two things, because instead of just Rowena, there now stood both Crowley
“I’ll get you out. Promise, Sammy.”
At that, she bent down and squeezed his cheek. Over her shoulder, Dean could see Sam hastily stowing a phone-shaped something in his pocket.
“What demon blood? What are you talking about?” Dean could feel ice creeping through his veins.
Dean groaned when the shtriga used him as a launching pad to leap at Sam, who fell backwards with a yell. Spotting his shotgun, he grabbed it as he crawled towards Cas and crouched over him. He growled when he realised he couldn’t get a clear shot with his brother in the fray.
might have taken a backseat for a while.
His voice was underlined with sarcasm so when the adonis replied, “Nah, only with the hot ones,” before
“Ain’t that the truth.”
Because next to his chair stood a boy, probably no older than six, wearing a much too-long black undershirt and apparently nothing else. He was scowling, though it looked more like a pout with his bottom lip pooched out like that. His sandy hair stood up at the front, and he had green eyes and a splash of freckles across his nose.
“Uh. Hey Cas.”
Two hours later, Dean was still pacing from one end of the kitchen to the other. He had a sneaking suspicion that he didn’t look as intimidating as he was aiming for.
Now, in his hands, he held his last and only hope.
“-and then she just up and left,” Dean finished. He sniffed, then rubbed his nose before continuing.
She sang the last part gleefully. Dean gave a roar of rage and launched himself at her, only to receive a mouthful of dirt when he crashed to the ground.
“Hey, you seen Cas?”
Manny managed to hold onto his cautious optimism all throughout his workday. It slipped a bit from his grasp when a young redhead spilt her coffee over his suit jacket during break. Then it gained a more secure foothold once he realised the girl - Charlie, according to her name badge and introduction - was actually very nice. She spent at least five minutes apologising for the stain on his white shirt
“I suppose congratulations are in order?” Her smile was sly. “Those two nincompoops finally gave in, hmm? It’s a bit too soon for wee ones, I daresay, but at least they look like their papas.”
He learned that he was a fan of
“Sam, where can I find more suitable attire?”
stopped with all the eye-sex.
Forty minutes later that rock in his tummy had sprouted numerous siblings.
attempt, but Manny still would’ve preferred to start with his name.
(Alright, so a very small part of his mind may have jumped into the gutter with thoughts of other situations where Cas could hold that pose, but he managed to fish it out and dry it off. No harm done.)
stamped on his forehead.
“Guess I’d better go help him then. For an ex-angel he can be pretty clumsy, y’know?”
Back at the bunker, it took Sam a laughably short time to hack into the security cameras on the stores surrounding the mall - much faster work than the police, whatever the mall staff may have advised.
“Will you
a special case, aren’t you? We’ve waited this long, a few more decades won’t hurt.”
The granny looked a bit startled at such eloquence from a four-year-old.
And with one last malicious smirk, she was gone, leaving a stunned Dean kneeling where he had fallen.
As he spoke, Dean’s smile grew steadily until he was beaming like the setting sun. Sam resisted the urge to snap a quick photo for posterity.
“I’m a guest, and your older -”
Dean found Cas in the tenth room they checked.
“I propose we change the subject.” Despite himself, Dean snorted.
He put his phone away. “Nah. Just. . . an old friend texted. Said he was coming up my way tonight. I might have to get that guest bedroom ready earlier than I thought.”
Sam hummed tunelessly as he typed away on his laptop.
Either that, or the shtriga had drained Cas dry and dumped his body in a ditch.
Following the excitement of Cas’ kidnapping and rescue - plus the discovery of two other kids, weakened but alive in the basement on Sam’s second walkthrough (and taken care of with an anonymous tip to the local police) - certain. . .
Dean resisted the urge to melt into a puddle. He needed to stick to the plan if he wanted to survive this unscathed and sane.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh as he dived at Cas to pull him into a kiss.
At that, she clapped her hands. “Welp, pleasure doing business with you Dean. Have a nice life, and see you in about five decades.”
She beamed at him. “Thank you for the suggestion, dearie, I think Rudy would like that very much. Such helpful young men, the both of you.”
Sam didn’t mind as much as he should - kid or not, Dean was still more capable than most grown hunters he knew - but he did worry. About his brother and about Cas.
The shtriga certainly had got Sam, pinned him to the wall to be more accurate. It provided Dean the perfect opening to give it a faceful of consecrated buckshot while the bitch attempted a dementor’s kiss with Sam.
It was only when he was safely behind his own front door that he really processed the events that had unfolded during their now-nightly movie marathon.
He couldn’t wait until they were back at the bunker and he and Cas could have a good, long talk.
But Sam had gone to Hell. Because of Yellow Eyes, he was probably screaming on a rack right this very second.
Dean could barely hear her taunting over the ringing in his ears.
Cas was blinking rapidly at the candy. “You brought me lollipops.”
I hope you had fun making your way through this. Thank you again.
“Yes mother, we all have eyes.” Crowley rolled his. Sam attempted to direct the conversation again.
Because there was something cracked inside him.
His good mood lasted through his microwaved dinner. He hummed as he brushed his teeth, making foam bubble up around his lips. He brought the latest novel by his favourite author with him to bed, and managed to finish chapter three before he placed it on the nightstand after carefully marking his place. His eyelids drooped pleasantly as he stretched to switch off the bedside lamp. He fell asleep in seconds.
“Hey angel,” Dean whispered into soft dark hair and tightened his grip. He could feel Cas smiling, confused but pleased, into his collarbone.
Until next time.
“Uh, highrises mostly and - hey, an abandoned factory. Another one here. . . aaand there’s a third. . .”
And see, this was why Dean’s heart had never stood a chance. Not because of how drop-dead gorgeous his angel was - but because even now, after all the death and destruction he had seen and dealt out, Cas still got excited about donating twenty dollars to a children’s hospital.
He accepted his drink and exited the cafe with his donut, still pensive. His day wasn’t going to improve - the needle on his mood-o-meter already cemented at ‘Unsalvageable’ - so he had no qualms about wading deeper into the thoughts that sometimes kept him up at nights.
“Oh.” Blue eyes widened, again behind protective covering. “Hello Dean.”
Logically Sam knew he had no reason to worry. Cas had proven himself an expert tactician time and time again, and Dean was the best hunter he had ever met. Stick them together and they could probably take down the entire building if they wanted to, even now.
“‘Cause you’re cute and funny and smart, and you made me pie?” Dean shrugged again. “So if that ain’t a no, is it a yes?”
a cherub.”
“Enjoy yourself?” Manny nodded enthusiastically.
“It’s a kids’ store in a mall. In the Christmas season. Crying kids are practically a requirement, Cas,” Dean countered. He dropped the bag at his feet and began piling in clothes by the handful.
“Don’t tempt me, Dean Winchester.
And so it began.
Dean took a deep breath and. . . knocked
“So what’s the deal with your name?” Dean carelessly wiped ketchup off his chin before taking a big bite of his burger.
They left the building together after clocking out in the evening, he to his Lincoln Continental and she to her banana-yellow Gremlin. She bade him farewell with a “Catch you later, alligator,” which accompanied a vaguely familiar hand gesture. Manny was fairly sure it wasn’t an insulting one.
Sam surfaced from a fascinating section on compost, intrigued. Dean looked much happier with this discovery than he did when he had strolled into the bunker’s kitchen with
“Room’s clear,” he murmured after checking Cas’ pulse for himself. “We’ll stash him in the impala and come back for the shtriga.”
He continued towards the subway.
I’d bring him back, did I?” She laughed. “That’s what happens when you don’t read the fine print, kid. Crowley’s gonna
Dean was pissed. He was eating pie, and he was pissed.
Sam Winchester considered himself a patient man. During the last fifteen years of hunting, he had interviewed dozens of confused, oftentimes distraught civilians. He had sat through countless stakeouts and spent hours upon hours sifting through dry-as-dust manuscripts.
On that particular gloomy Saturday morning, Dean was lying on his bed with his hands folded underneath his head. He had already cleaned his guns, emptied the wastebasket in his room, swept out the dust bunnies from beneath the bed, and created a sock drawer.
- “in that dinosaur phase.”
He blinked. Then he blinked again.
This was it. Dean had to do it
discovered was much easier to moan in the shower than ‘the god with green eyes and freckles’.
“Um, yeah sorry, that was a shitty excuse for flirting; I haven’t had my coffee yet. What I meant to say was, ‘Come here often?’”
The sphere warmed and Dean yelped in pain before instinctively tossing it away.
“Cute kid. Is he yours?”
“Look at that. I suppose that answers my question. And by the way, pink is
and Dean was pretty sure that Sam had realised what was up - but he didn’t give a damn.
Sam hurried after his brother and caught him by his new hoodie. “What do you mean ‘us’?”
Once again, Dean strode through the doorway. This time however, Cas immediately straightened from his crouch when he saw his visitor.
A blush spread across his freckles and he toed the ground with an oversized sneaker.
After reminding Cas to meet back up with them by the checkout counter, Dean waited until he and grandma were out of view before stomping over to Sam.
Cas sounded surprised when he answered, “Of course, Dean.” Thankfully he waited until he had stepped outside and closed the door to remove his helmet.
A classic Dean move, if you thought about it.
That anticipation had given way to despair by the time door number eight rolled around. By door nine, he was becoming increasingly certain that this factory, like all the others before it, was a dead end.
Sammy was in Hell.
Dean thought he was cute. And smart and funny. Dean thought he was all of those things and he had asked him out on a
I was sorry. Plus, it’s not like it’s a huge change, you’ve always been shorter than me. It’s just a lot more obvious now.”
- and was unnerved when Dean merely nodded, shotgun at the ready.
Dean picked up his beer, still blushing. “Screw you, Manny.”
“But if she rejects your proposal again, you mustn’t bother her anymore. Understand?”
Sam flinched as the pen clicked again and finally snapped.
The demon shrugged. “They do when the King of the Crossroads tells them to. And no,” she interrupted Dean when he opened his mouth, “I don’t know why he’d make an exception for you. But then again, you
“I admire him. He was brave enough to go after what - who - he wanted. Even after experiencing the pain of rejection, he still risked it. I’ve noticed that children are much braver than adults, in that sense.”
She paused and her eyes - hazel again, instead of black - unfocused slightly, as if she was listening to something far away. Abruptly, she blinked before grinning widely.
Sam immediately collapsed into a chair by the changing rooms. Dean, who had already picked out his clothes prior to their lunch break, kept an eye on Cas as he drifted from rack to rack. Sleeves and hems trailed behind him from the selections he carried over his shoulder.
See, whatever Dean might tell his brother, he wasn’t stupid. He knew things.
Dean swallowed. “Yeah Cas,” he croaked out. “I did.” His hands were clammy.
“Huh? Oh.” Sam had somehow moved to the front of the line and the vendor, a young brunette, was smiling at him. “Oh no, he’s. . . my nephew. I’m just babysitting him and his best friend for the day.”
“It’s actually short for Emmanuel.” Jimmy was the one who had coined his nickname; the ‘s’ in his first name had proven to be too much for his lisp as a toddler. He had outgrown the lisp a few years later, but ‘Manny’ had stuck, to the extent that he was sure most of his co-workers weren’t even aware it wasn’t his first name.
“Dean, stop insulting Rowena. She did the best she could, it isn’t her fault that we received a large enough dose for the effects to last a fortnight.”
So. Last chapter, or epilogue, really. Big moment. Here we go.
Thankfully Cas was immune to awkwardness, because his eyes crinkled the way they did when he smiled.
“Right, apologies Samuel.” She spoke briskly but still cast curious glances at Dean and Cas.
!” Cas seemed nonplussed by the redhead now smooshing his cheeks. His eyes widened when the witch crouched until their faces were level. “Oh Fergus, he looks just like you did when you were this age! All big blue eyes and knobbly knees.”
The former angel was lying on his stomach on the kitchen table as he paged through a dusty tome, head propped up on a chubby fist (only his eyes had been visible over the table top when he sat in a chair). He now wore one of Dean’s old Zeppelin shirts. It still went past his knees, but the short sleeves stopped at his wrists instead of trailing behind him.
It was during their second water break that disaster struck. They were sitting with their backs against a cleared section of shelf, water bottles in hand. Dean had just removed his protective helmet when he happened to glance to his left and nearly swallowed his tongue.
Manny preferred to use the time to consider his life and the changes Jimmy’s marriage had caused in it.
, he thought his blush could be excused.
So he was understandably impatient when the narrow aisle was blocked by a tiny lady with fluffy white hair and dainty gloves. She was peering over the racks forlornly, and Cas predictably stopped to help.
Cas smiled and tilted his head closer. For the first time Dean could recall, a flush of pink decorated his cheeks.
“I haven’t really been looking, to be honest. I mean, it’d be nice to have a vacation, right?”
, because he looked scandalised when Manny admitted that he hadn’t watched any of them yet - a problem that the man remedied by gruffly shoving a set of DVDs into his chest the next time they crossed paths.
“Your eyes are really blue.”
Though that wasn’t the start of it, of course. As most things did, it started with Dean Winchester.
Guilt turned the taste of apple filling in his mouth to ash. It wasn’t enough that this whole mess was basically his fault. No, he had almost been responsible for literally wiping his best friend off the face of the earth.
Which was not the reaction Dean had been expecting. He moseyed ever so slightly closer to Cas’ side of the table.
For instance, he learned that the man had recently rented out the little cottage across the street from him, which helped explain why Manny now seemed to bump into him every time he left his house.
“Uh, here you go.” He might have almost shoved the bouquet up Cas’ nose instead of just handing it to him, but the important thing was that Cas was now holding it.
She tsk’ed. “Touchy, touchy. Well, if you insist. . . According to this new deal, I can bring Sam back. . . and wait until you die naturally to collect your soul. Neat, huh?”
If he had to be reverted to a kindergartner, couldn’t it have been something
“Look, Dean,” he began, mind already more than half on his article on green living. “Why don’t you go annoy Cas for a while?”
“Take me. You can have me. Gimme a decade, then you can come and collect.”
Dean reminded himself. He could look into the ‘special case’ part once Sammy was okay. “So this deal. . .”
Every time he thought that, he’d feel a brief flush of shame.
Dean said as much and Crowley, who had been busy needling Sam, jumped. Dean was petty enough to enjoy his bewilderment when the King of Hell finally saw him.
“You should have left for work by now, it’s already seven-thirty. Have you even eaten yet?”
specify a good long life for you. That means no suicide and no throwing yourself willy-nilly into hunts just to bring Sam back earlier. All that will do is nullify the deal, which leaves Sam’s soul burning downstairs for eternity.”
“Nope Room. He’s archiving all the shit piled up in there.” Dean grimaced at this, and Sam privately agreed.
“Alright then, kiddo, go get her.” Jordan grinned at them, then sped off to parts unknown.
sweetie. That happens after you die. Then yeah, he’ll come back good as new.”
Dean’s blush had faded by now, and it was replaced by a smirk. He leaned forward confidently.
When he raised his head again, Cas was gone.
If he had raised his head, he would have caught a glimpse of the odd glint in Dean’s green eyes. There was a pause before he elaborated.
The kid hid his face in his arms but Cas answered for him.
All this time Dean had been able to comfort the screaming in his head with the thought of his baby brother kicking back on a cloud upstairs, even though it was too soon for him.
“So it’s done? Sammy’s topside?”
Dean’s mouth automatically opened. His brain, sensing imminent disaster, frantically cast about for something,
“Yeah well, you’ve got. . . fuddy-duddy ancestors. . . too.” Dean muttered. He chewed aggressively.
The shtriga had knocked the breath out of Dean and was now lying over him, facing Sam. His brother had tripped over the monster and remained huddled on the floor above Cas, trying to aim and protect simultaneously.
It had been more than two hours since Dean had gone downstairs. Which meant that Dean and Cas had been in an enclosed space for that long and their antics (or lack thereof) had left the bunker still standing. Small mercies, Sam mused, but he still would have taken a smoking crater if it meant that the two dimwits got together and finally,
“Preferences,” Cas prompted and Dean nodded.
And they were. Or at least, they were until Manny asked about seeing Claire or Jimmy started insinuating that he was wasting his life at the firm. He particularly liked to remind Manny about how
Well, nothing besides Dean’s usual embargo on anything resembling meaningful speech when the ‘f’ word cropped up in conversation. As a result, the wastebasket in Dean’s room was filled to the brim with the remains of brave notebook pages, sacrificed in his quest to compose the perfect love letter to Cas.
For instance, he knew that during the past eleven years, his feelings for Cas had sprinted from
He turned to Sam when Dean flipped him off. “Is that what you’re teaching your young impressionable older brother, Moose? I’m very disappointed. Next you’ll have the little cherub imitating him.”
“Nah, just that it sounds -
Bad things happened when Dean Winchester was bored.
Dean had been unbearably smug as he cleaned his sawed-off shotgun in the passenger seat.
He fingered the small packet of lollipops he had picked up on a whim in the candy aisle and stuck in his pocket, most likely melted by now.
Because he was still an accountant at age thirty-four, in the same position he had held and despised ever since he had started at Lesley and Sons. Because he hadn't been able to make it through a single one of the dates Jimmy set up for him without the other party storming off in a huff before dessert. Because his nightmares continued to persist, even after numerous doctor’s visits and sleeping aids. Because he had turned to alcohol when those sleeping aids had failed. Because he had cursed and railed at Jimmy when his twin had paid his way through rehab ten years ago.
“Unfortunately.” Manny didn’t really mean it; over the years it had turned into something of a ritual to the twins.
“Hello Dean.”
“Great, multiple potential lairs for us to check out.” Sam looked up at the screech of a chair leg. Dean was already striding out of the map room.
Dean was still smiling as he moved to sit next to Cas.
To summarise, Dean Winchester was bored.
“We’ve got an angel to find.”
She paused, as if realising something. “Now, where are the lovebirds? I assume it’s on their behalf that I was summoned?”
The demon in front of him laughed. “You’re kidding, right pumpkin?”
He knew all those things and was fine with them. His chest just got a bit tight and fluttery when he saw Cas. He could handle it. He
And for a while, he could believe that. They’d have the occasional dinner or stay over at each other’s houses like they did last night. They’d just be Jimmy and Manny, the Novak twins.
“Jack left for heaven this morning. Said he’ll sort out everything up there.” Sam paused to take in the full effect of the next words on his brother. “Cas told me he’ll stay here for a while, since he’s got a room and all. Not like there are that many cases out there now.”
