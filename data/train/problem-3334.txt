If Castiel ever thought Dean was unpredictable before now, then he was wrong.
Now Dean pulls Cas closer, his hands holding him firm; he brushes his lips against Cas’s hairline, his temple; he presses himself tightly against Cas until there’s no room for air.
There’s too much blood.  It’s everywhere, on everything.
A too sharp laugh from Dean is all it takes for Dean to start coughing again.  He pounds on his sternum, failing to loosen the mucus in his chest. “You’re an angel, you asshole, you’re not gonna get sick from kissing me.” He forces the bar of soap into Cas’s hand and turns around.
“He said it wasn’t the music making you drink.” He accidentally swallows some toothpaste and tries to hide his coughing. “Something about the scene of the crimes being too much for you.  Are you getting a weak stomach, Dean?” Sam teases, joining his brother in the bathroom.
“Sure, that won’t be a problem.” She pulls out another sheet for him to fill out. Dean puts down the number of the PO box they have in Lebanon. “Will that be all then?” she asks. Dean confirms, handing over his card, then getting that and his receipt back. “Thanks for coming in, happy holidays!”
RECORDING SEVEN
The History channel is showing a documentary on the black plague.
Dean doesn’t even startle at Cas’s touch.  Something about that makes him smug.
Dean twists his wrist as he pulls on Cas’s cock, feeling the muscles in his stomach contract.  His thrusting picks up as he listens to Cas’s moans, right in his ear, unable to hold himself back from the pleasure that comes with them.
He washes his hands and grabs a bottle of whiskey from the fridge. “C’mon, Cas, you need a drink.”
Dean needs
Another hunt?
Dean’s hands loosen minutely. “Look, Cas, listen, I don’t give two shits about the fucking Bunker.  I’m just glad you’re back.”
That evening they go out to dinner, stopping in the small diner across the street from the post office.  They have cherry pie tonight, so Dean splits his piece with Cas, letting him eat most of the ice cream.  As they kiss outside the restaurant, shrouded in shadow, Dean leaning against the Impala door, he tastes the tartness that lingers behind in Cas’s mouth.  He’s grateful to have the chance at this not-so-normal-but-still-normal-anyways moment.
“It was definitely voodoo.” Dean’s looking more carefully at the marks of blood surrounding the alligator now, he recognizes them from the spell books.
About five months after Sam left, when things finally began to feel normal between Castiel and Dean again, Heaven calls.
Dean finishes chewing on the bite he took. “He didn’t wait for me?” He puts as little emotion into that sentence as possible.
Later that night, Dean’s in the motel bed, on the phone with Sam, while Cas stares at his reflection in the mirror.  He knows he’s been in here much longer than necessary, and Dean must have noticed, but he can’t tear himself away from the haunting image in front of him.
“Good morning, Agent Ashley…” Dean sits through the boring details of the information the officer gives him, about the “miracles” reverting and people coming into the station in a fit, demanding answers.  Dean just wants to talk to the mom one last time, tell her what happened and comfort her the best they know how, then hit the road.
With that said, Dean strains to turn them over.  Cas on his back now, arches into Dean’s hand as he again grips his cock. The hunter’s other arm wraps under the angel, still stretching to claw at his back.  He has an idea why Cas enjoys it but he’ll ask about that later. Now, in this exact moment, Dean turns his rapt attention to Castiel’s cock, a mere foot from his face. He wraps just his index and thumb around the base and starts a slow pull to the top.  The reaction is immediate, Cas’s legs shake and his hips come off the bed.
It is a Thursday morning when Sam leaves the bunker for good; when Dean barely comes out of his room in time to hug goodbye.
But he finds himself in front of his bedside table opening the drawer before he knows it, pulling out lube that is God knows how old.  He flicks the cap open and turns it over, squeezing some into the trash can.
Cas searches for the medication he bought for Dean, placing it on the nightstand next to the cough drops and glass of water he put there not long after Dean fell asleep.  He thinks about withholding the takeout until Dean swallows another dose of pills and about a liter of water.
Dean’s mouth falls open slightly, for some reason he is shocked by this news even though he knew Castiel didn’t have
“Dean, I…” But Cas doesn't know what to say.  Again, he has to stop and marvel at how the human continually renders him helpless.
Suddenly Cas’s anger is reflected right back at him. “You damn well know why we had to do that Cas!  It was for your own good!”
— in less than six months.  He is determined to make Cas cum like he’s never cum before.  Then there’s the tug of Cas’s hands in his hair, igniting something low in his belly he hasn’t felt before, and he kind of likes it. That slow heat gradually builds into something he can almost put a name to.  Finally, there’s the echo of both Cas’s thoughts inside his head and the low vibrations of his moans in his ears.
“We’re fucking.”
As much as Sam likes to say he’s healthy (“No, no, see, I can add avocado because it’s a fruit, same with tomatoes and pickles.  And mayonnaise doesn’t have any trans fat, so it can’t be that bad for you.  Three cheeses just means more calcium.  And, look, I’m adding lettuce, so it’s almost a salad.”), he’s still a hunter and a Winchester. That means burgers cannot be avoided forever.
The kids approach the table again, beers in hand.  Dean and Cas both immediately stand, Dean now effectively blushing behind the glass of whiskey he’s drinking.
“What did you make?” he asks, trying to read Dean’s expression.
Cas perches his chin on Dean’s shoulder.
Dean knew, he obviously knew, but still it startled him to see Cas’s half-naked body. He wasn’t expecting the usual, the small shoulders, round breasts, narrow waist.
“Like what? Hunting stuff?” Sam’s staring straight ahead, his expression still unreadable.
Sex still comes easy though.  The first time after Sam left, two weeks or so, Dean comes up behind Cas as he is sitting in the library, editing a book on demon physiology, and kneads his shoulders, not the first touch since Sam left but definitely one of the more intimate.  He is talking about dinner, a neutral topic, but Castiel isn’t listening, instead focusing on properly adding to the possession habits of South American demons.  Then Dean’s hands slide around to Castiel’s chest, tugging at the tie and popping a few buttons open so his hands can roam inside the shirt.  Castiel can’t focus on the habits anymore.  He leans back into the touch and tilts his head into it when Dean bends to kiss his temple.  Soon, Castiel finds himself standing and turning in Dean’s arms, pulling the other man closer.  The resulting sex leaves them both bent over the table, panting into the wood, sweating on the books and papers.
Castiel laughs, Deans sounds like a kids asking for the answers to a magic trick. “I might have learned a couple more tricks from Gabriel,” he jokes.
He’d never really had to address his sexuality before.  He always just defaulted to being attracted to women. Easy, simple, normal. And it’s not like he’s had the time or emotional availability to think about it.
He groans quietly, hoping Cas takes that as an answer.  He’s staring at the hunter intently as Dean finally looks up from the spine of the book he’s trying to translate. “I told you, I don’t like when I get ‘zapped,’ it just isn’t my favorite way to travel, feels too much like flying.
Cas presses his face into the crook of Dean’s neck and takes a deep breath, before he slides out of Dean’s loose hold, only one hand absentmindedly touching his shoulder.  He bends to pull his pants back on, then throws a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes over his shoulder before slipping out of the room.
“Did you figure out the case?” Getting back to business.
A knocking on the door rips Castiel from his thoughts.
He steps in the shower, the water too hot, but he lets it pelt at his shoulders anyways.  It’s a good distraction, the burn.  It takes his focus off of his faults, off Cas’s absence, off of the emptiness filling the bunker.
It starts early, around six o’clock the hunter wakes up and kisses an already wide-eyed Cas next to him.  Their mouths almost lazy against one another’s as their fingers trail over sleep-warm skin.  Seven o’clock rolls around, the sun just starting to stream through the tiny window in the motel bathroom, drawing a streak that finally reaches across the foot of their bed; they decide it’s time to get up and leave.
Dean keeps blaming the grace.  He continues to tell himself that he’s thinking so much about Cas because he saw the angel’s grace in its true form.  That because he was exposed to his life force that he’s bound to care more about him now, like his energy found its way into the hunter’s veins and now he needs to make sure it survives.  But his dark eyes and broad shoulders have nothing to do with his grace.  The way he curiously tilts his head when Dean exposes him to another human phenomenon doesn’t prove he is healing and yet he notices every time he does.
Cas smirks and looks Dean directly in the eyes.
“I didn’t say anything,” he replies, confused.
His body drapes itself over Dean’s, filling all the nooks and crannies Dean so carefully leaves empty.  Dean’s hands are soft on his skin despite their calluses and cuts (Castiel reminds himself to heal the cuts later but not the calluses because who would Dean Winchester be without his roughness?).  Castiel can actually feel real sweat dripping down his neck.  He mentally traces the drop’s path until it drips onto Dean’s chest.
Cas only gets as far as that recording before Dean blearily opens his eyes and presses his face into his chest.  Dean quickly turns over and starts coughing into his elbow, kicking the sheets away.
, they’re dirtier, they’re messier,
“Yeah, angel, yeah, like that.  Beautiful. Like that, c’mon, so good for me, baby, so good on my cock.”
“You had five drinks, you are hopeless.”
The music gets louder as the song continues, Dean can’t hear anything but the singer’s voice from the stereos and he’s grateful.  It means he doesn’t have to try and have a conversation with Cas. The song switches to something with a heavier drum.  Finally, Dean gathers enough courage, or maybe the bourbon finally kicked in, and turns to Cas, his hips and shoulders still in time with the song.  Cas’s awkwardly standing next to him still, bobbing his head slightly, off from the beat of the music.  Dean sighs.  Cas notices the staring and turns to him.  Dean grabs his tie and pulls him closer; Cas stumbles against him, catching himself on the hunter’s shoulder. Once Dean’s undone his tie, he shoves it into his back pocket.  He undoes the top couple buttons of Cas’s shirt, spreading it to reveal his collarbones.
Cas bites into the pepper without a second thought, too trusting that Sam wouldn’t play a prank on him.  He grabs a handful of the peppers and tosses them on his plate before popping three more in his mouth. Sam’s gawking. Cas smirks in reply. “You really think I didn’t know what jalapenos tasted like, or that they were even remotely hot compared to the spices they use South America or East Asia?”
Dean swallows his nerves, soaking them in the alcohol sitting in his stomach. “I was remembering a time Sam got a wedgie when we went to a water park,” he answers truthfully.
“Dean.”
Dean can feel his face heating up, but he just stares down at his hands, trying to let everything Sam says soak in.
“I was entrusted to watch the human race for millenias; I know without a shadow of a doubt I would not hesitate to spend the rest of my remaining days on Earth.”
“Wait, my olive oil?” Sam notes, heaving the other crate out and following Dean to the door.
-Also Claire hadn't been reintroduced yet (okay well yes she had, but her character hadn't been as flushed out yet and I didn't know they were going to do the whole Wayward Daughters angle), but you bet your asses I would have written her in and Cas/Dean would have totally been overprotective parents (same goes for Jack).
Cas laughs, looking down at their feet, his hand coming up to his neck again, rubbing it before his hands fall almost dramatically. “I might have used a little trick Gabriel taught me a long time ago.”
They reach the door to their motel room.
“Cas is…” He doesn’t even know where to begin.
it felt.
10/23/16: Beta'd!
It was a quick and dirty case in rural Missouri.  A few djinn were feeding on the small town population.  Unfortunately, it had taken months for the news of the staggering death toll in the one-stop-light-town to gain any sort of media attention and near a dozen people had already been murdered.  Dean lets out what seems like every ounce of his frustration and anger on the three djinn hauled up in an abandoned horse barn on the south side of the town.  He guts them, rips them to shreds, makes sure not to leave until their blood is cold.  Afterwards, once Cas stows his angel blade, he walks up to an exhausted Dean.  He takes the man’s face between his hands and pours some grace between their bond to fade the fatigue and heal any physical damage.  They stay in their motel room for one more night, Dean curled away from Cas as the angel strokes his back.
He squints his eyes. “I meant, I can
He walks back up to the counter, looking anywhere but Paige’s face.
, Dean swallows, licking his lips as his nose brushes Cas’s,
It’s not like Dean could ever completely forget the hunter life when making up a backstory for some girl in a bar.  Behind his tales of detailing expensive cars or being a stuntman for movies, the current case was not forgotten.  No matter how far he tried to separate himself those nights, he couldn’t, not fully. A hunter to the bone, as John would say. Dean knew that he’d forget that poor girl’s name by the next morning, deserting her bed while his heart was still pounding and his legs were still soft.  He couldn’t actually like the girl, not when he knew in a few hours he’d leave and reenter the world of hunting.  The demons never really left, literally or figuratively.
. He presses his tongue to Cas’s tentatively, as if this were his first time doing so, and feels a thrill shoot through him when Cas sucks it into his mouth.  Feeling light headed and heart beating insistently against his ribs, because he’s so overwhelmed, Dean turns away, his lips trailing along Cas’s cheek, catching on the stubble there.  He concentrates on sucking a bruise onto Cas’s throat right under the hinge of his jaw.
He folds the paper up, placing it on top of his jacket. “I know we do but it doesn’t hurt to know what the town is thinking when we go in.” Finally, he eats, spearing his salad with a fork.
His nails bite into his own palm as the note crumples in his hand, bringing him back to the present.
More and more moans fill the air as the pair finds their rhythm. Occasionally Dean will crook his fingers, finding Cas’s prostate, and stroking that bundle of nerves extra hard for a few thrusts.  Once three fingers are sliding in and out with ease, when Cas is barely able to speak, huffing out low moans muffled in the sheets, does Dean think he’s prepped enough.
“I am not a car, Dean.” He thinks it was an attempt at a joke, but his body isn’t able to respond to humor while looking at the battered vessel of Castiel sagging in front of him. He lets Dean guide him to the kitchen to start patching him up.
Cas almost breaks down right there, the relief cutting through him like a knife.
“Loser buys. Deal.”
“What the hell?” he coughs, as the smell hits him.
Why couldn’t Cas actually be a tax accountant?
of this is your fault— how many times do I have to remind you?  Metatron was going to find a way to seal off Heaven no matter what!  And you already tried to help those dicks once!  They turned their backs on you once they realized you didn’t have the answers they were looking for!  You don’t owe them
The waitress sets down their lunches with a smile and the normal, “Here you go, boys, anything else I can get y’all?”
“I’m not.” He leans heavier into the angel, knowing he can carry the weight.
Cas is once two fingers are buried to the knuckle. Right now he really can’t imagine his cock fitting in Cas, but—
“Wait,” Dean speaks up, his head spinning from how close to puking he feels. “Can you engrave the journal too?”
He looks up at Dean as he gathers the bloodied supplies from the tabletop. “Not as much as when they were tearing me apart.” His eyes are incredibly distant and Dean has to look away, almost overcome with the pain in them.
A tip off from one of Bobby’s old friends leads them to a wendigo close to the Canadian border in Minnesota.  They’re practically going into this blind it feels like.  The last wendigo they hunted was almost a decade ago and they have to keep referencing John’s journal, which stirs up loads of nostalgia. It feels like they’re on a mini vacation because out in the middle of nowhere they found some family’s fully-stocked cabin and have been using it as a base while they hunt for this damned monster.  While Sam’s outside trying to find cell reception one morning, Cas corners Dean in the bathroom. They make out for longer than it takes Dean to do the rest of his morning routine.  That night, he tries not to think about it because his stomach still twists in uncomfortable ways when he imagines Cas’s lips trailing over his chest.  Turns out, the cabin wasn’t a seasonal getaway for some family, it was their home. The wendigo was actually the matriarch of the family and had long since eaten the rest of them, coming back to the cabin sometimes in hopes of finding more people who stumbled across it. Unfortunately, it met the Winchesters and Cas instead.
It would be so much safer.  It would mean less hunts, the more hunters that know about them.  It wouldn’t be that hard to get the signal out, they already know so many people in the business.  With all of the lore and research and information so readily available in the bunker, it’s actually a crime that they aren’t sharing it with the rest of the hunting world.  It would be about damn time that there was an actual network started too; Cas would fucking love being in charge of the whole strategy of running the thing.
“With all do respect, ma’am,” Dean counters, finally finding his voice, “We’re just going where the boss says.  Now can you show us to the crime scene?”
has. He coats his fingers one more time in the extra oil pooled in his other palm.
It’s not that Cas doesn’t know how to give Dean time or space or just sit there when he’s having a bad day.  But those days when his shame hits the tipping point or his guilt overrides any other emotion or his memories are remembered too sharply, Cas can’t empathize with.  Some human emotions still fly over his head, not able to comprehend the shame that comes with actions, desires, or thoughts.  Sure he feels his own guilt for the mistakes he’s made in the grand scheme of trying to fix Heaven and Earth, the mistakes involving Dean’s trust, but never has he been ashamed to feel for Dean the way he does.  He wasn’t there for a large portion of Dean’s life, the most defining years, he was stuck in Heaven watching over but never interfering.  He likes to think that if he interacted sooner, Dean would not have to experience a fraction of the fear or self-consciousness he now feels day to day, sometimes overwhelming him.
Dean has to force himself not to panic.
“We didn’t state rules in the beginning, who says we can’t change them now?”
Dean can’t help the anger that seeps from his lips, even if it is misused.  All of his vulnerability comes to the surface, and he fights it how his instincts tell him to:
He knows he should call Sam, but as he tries to take his phone out of his pocket, his hands are shaking too badly, and he ends up dropping it on the ground.  Defeated, he doesn’t even move to pick it up, he starts pacing, unable to stay still while he waits.
“Is that...so?” asks the kid Dean approached.
Cas is just barely grinding his hips into the bed, a slight thrust as he mouths silently at the pleasure.  Dean has a sneaking suspicion that Cas’s hand is fisted around his cock.  The air thickens with desire the moment Cas realizes Dean is in the room.  He only noticed because Dean couldn’t hold back the moan bursting in his chest.  Cas’s head rolls on his shoulders, his breath quickening when he doesn’t stop touching himself.
Dean swallows hard, not knowing how to reply. So he doesn’t. He rolls his bottle in Cas’s direction and hears him pick it up as he lies back down. It’s almost worse when Dean can’t see the angel because then he starts to think about how his throat would jump when swallowing such continuous amounts of alcohol.
For as attentive as Cas is, he’s only half listening.  All morning he’s been fighting with himself to listen to more of Sam’s recordings.  It seems ridiculous, so badly wanting to know just a fraction more about Dean that he’s not listening to Dean speak now.  But he is only able to understand Dean from his own point of view, and to a smaller degree, from Dean’s as well.  The insight that Sam would have on Dean would be extremely helpful in navigating their relationship.
“I like when you’re here,” Cas whispers.  Cas must sense Dean’s confusion because he continues, “You always try not to think about us when we’re together, it scares you too much.  But, just so you know, I like having you here, mind, body, and all.”
Cas bows his head towards Dean and whispers, “I tried to think of something no one else would have.” Dean nods, still too awed to talk.
Dean smiles. “Okay, so…”
They all stare at one another in a tense and electric silence for a long moment.
“But— and I couldn’t tell you what— something sparked something in you and now I think you’re finally comfortable not always being in your box. And, if I say so myself, I think you’re happier this way.  Everyone needs to push their limits, everyone needs to find themselves. I’m glad you found yourself.” At that his face breaks into a huge smile and he looks like he wants to hug Dean, so he does.
Cas rubs a hand over the back of his neck, he sees Dean trace the movement with his eyes. “Since we got here.  I wanted to know as much as possible for tomorrow, when we go talk to the cops.”
He grace hums with a dull dim that has not recharged itself since the battle.  Part of him does not wish it to.
of Dean’s knife chopping the various vegetables and he barely notices the movement out of the corner of his eye before hearing Cas ask what is for dinner.
“Live a little,” Dean shouts into his ear, pulling him close so he can hear him. Cas pulls away, squinting at him, and Dean’s heart stutters out an uneven beat. “C’mon, man, loosen up, it’s a concert!” Again Dean’s shouting into his ear, their faces brush and he pulls away instinctually.
Halfway through the night, when rain starts to slowly fall outside, and Dean’s hand moved to clutch his pillow, Castiel grabs a sleep shirt and his boxers from the corner of the room where they reappeared.  He pulls the laptop from Dean’s bag and bunched the pillows so he could lean against the headboard to continue his research.
If Dean thinks the sigh he just released doesn’t sound close to a sob, then he’s lying to himself.  He screws his eyes shut, hoping that will be enough to keep the emotions he’s feeling—
Dean sits between Cas and Sam, his knee pressing firmly to Cas’s. “Youngest first,” he chides, definitely not wanting to open his presents first.
“Anything, angel,” Dean says, pulling at Cas’s hair to better expose the hollow of his throat.
Cas sighs, the rain drops peeling down the window getting bigger by the minute. “I was thinking about all the important information I know about you.”
After the third commercial break starts, Dean decides he should stand and clean the dishes, or at least take them to the kitchen.  Once Cas understands what the hunter is doing, he tries to help, but Dean shoos him away, stating, “It’s not a lot, Cas, I’ll get in done in no time. Don’t worry.”
A tense couple minutes follows before Cas huffs in frustration.  He picks up the pot he threw and puts it on the counter before walking down the hall.
Edit 12/26/15: has been beta'd!
Dean watches as Cas pushes away from the table and leaves the room with tight lips. “So that’s it?!” Dean yells at the doorway, fuming.  He glares at Cas’s coffee cup again, like it will apologize to him.
He is doing laundry while Dean showers before they watch a movie.  Never mind the fact that they just got back from the movies.  Also, never mind the fact that they sat in the back row of the empty theater and made out like a couple of teenagers the whole time.  Dean wants to watch another movie and Castiel wouldn’t mind sucking more bruises into Dean’s shoulder before the night is over.
He yanks the blade from their chest, then plunges it back in again and again.
It’s still strange taking as much time in the bathroom as he needs, not worried about having to share one with Sammy anymore. Being able to fully look at himself, or not look at himself, in the mirror. His eyes trace over his body, still riddled with scars no matter how many times Cas heals him. The burn of his handprint is still stark against his skin after all these years.
“You’re so beautiful—”
Dean turns over, clinging to the side of the bed because the center is still warm. Uncomfortable while it’s empty. He doesn’t even bother with the covers, he wants to fall asleep as soon as possible.
Once Cas sinks all the way down, he braces himself, hands framing Dean’s head. He rolls his hips again. Dean’s positive he feels his stomach drop out.  Hips roll again. Dean moans, pulling at Cas, lips searching.  Hips just keep grinding down, steadier than his own heartbeat.  He grabs Cas’s ass to help facilitate the thrusts.  Precum leaks onto Dean’s stomach as Cas’s cock rubs between their bellies.
“So you don’t have any mojo left, not even enough to teleport?”
“I’m an angel,” Cas smiles gleefully.  Dean looks confused, so Cas continues, “I could have willed us and the bags into the car with nothing more than a thought,” he laughs, as if it’s one of the most hilarious things he’s said.  He turns his face to the sky, marveling at the beauty of nature in the raw.
“Thirty dollar deal?” The kid asks, and Dean pulls out his wad of cash, making sure the kid sees that it’s value.
Dean takes a deep breath.
It’s then that Dean realizes their faces are about six inches apart. He swallows.  Cas’s lips are turned in a slight smile, his teeth exposed, and his navy eyes bright with mischievous excitement.
Sam shakes his shoulders, loosening up some; Dean still feels a charge running through him. “And?” he asks.
.  Dean was completely honest when divulging, he didn’t skirt around the matter.
He helps Cas sit against the wall and then goes to lie in the middle of the floor himself, staring up at the window. The only window in the entire Bunker. He forces himself not to look at Cas, but that only works until he hears him pick up the bottle and take a long swallow from it. It’s empty when he pulls it away from his lips. His lips shine with the remnants of the liquor before he licks it away.
Before I didn’t want to be an angel.
. “Thank you.”  She turns on her heel and reenters the apartments through a different door.
“It’s just a cough, Cas, jeez,” Dean complains, turning Cas around to scrub at his back.
Dean wants to smile, it tugs on his lips, but he doesn’t. “I figured...I know you’re not a spur of the moment kind of guy.  You’ve always got a reason.” He holds to Cas a little gentler now.
Dean thinks.
He thinks it before he can stop himself.
Every time he tells Cas he cares or doesn’t know how to live without him, the words spark both fear and need inside of him.  Sometimes he feels every utterance of devotion to Cas only makes it more destructive if something were to happen to Cas.  Other times, Dean can actually see a life full of happiness with Cas every time he speaks his adoration.
The first thing Cas notices is that the clipboard is in the same place he left it.  As if his entire world has shifted on axis and broken apart.  He wants to yell, to release the pressure that’s still building up inside of him.
“What?” Cas bites, frustrated and confused. His eyes lose the softness that flashed briefly when he said Dean’s name.
, for once content to be present in both mind and body.
Eventually, Cas started showing signs of leveling out.  Once, when Dean slid his lunch into the room, Cas grabbed his wrist and started whispering nonsense.  Dean tried his best to comfort him with hushed noises in response. The next time Cas ran his fingers over Dean’s palm as alcohol was passed under the door.  Then he stroked the hairs on Dean’s forearm as breakfast was served.  And like that, the touches and the compassion started to come back to Cas as the weeks wore on. In between all the misleading searches and dead ends when hunting for his grace, Dean could still find hope in the fact that Cas was improving.  He started speaking again, English that now made sense, that Dean could understand even if he didn’t know the source.  Cas was quoting books and documents,
“Yes.”
“Alright, I’ll take Denver,” Sam says.  That leaves Dean with Lincoln. “Where you going, Cas?”
Dean’s annoyed Sam isn’t on his side. “Fine,” he grumbles, “I’ll go get supplies from my car.” He turns on his heel and walks to the tunnel where Baby is parked.
The grip on Cas’s arms has gotten so tight his knuckles are white, fingers still shaking.
“Dean, I’m doing this for both of us.  I want you to understand, even though this decision is partly about me and my relationship with Heaven, and my choice to break that connection…  The other part of this is for you.” Cas fucking blushes now, and Dean’s legs would have given out if he weren’t laying down. “I’m also doing this so that you know, that no matter what happens, I’m staying right here with you.”
.  That thought alone gives Dean that little boost he needs. “We’re doing stuff.”
Dean pulls a glass vial no bigger than his index finger out of his jacket pocket.  He starts to open it, but Castiel stops him, “You will not want to be in here when my soul bonds with my grace again.” He takes the vial from the hunter, looking softly at their hands as they brush.  He feels warmer than Castiel has ever been.  Dean’s eyes meet Castiel’s as he looks up again.
Sam looks anxious when they find him; he’s sitting outside a restaurant with a table full of manila envelopes.  He’s quickly flipping through each one before deciding which pile to put it in. “Hey, guys.” He looks up as we approach. “How many scenes did you get to? Did you know there’s actually six different crime scenes, that’s three more than we thought.”
Cas is too close in the tiny restroom, which suddenly heated a few degrees when he entered. Dean can’t take it anymore. He grabs the lapels of the angel’s jacket and brings their bodies together, brings their faces together. He knows he looks angry.  Cas’s breath hitches but his expression remains unchanged.  Hopefully Cas interprets this as a drunk and angry Dean that doesn't want another guy in the bathroom with him and they can leave the bar all together.
They’re only interrupted once, for a nurse to check his charts and stats, to see that everything is progressing as it should be.
He wants to scream; so he does.  The sound bursting and bell-like as he swears in Enochian; any close windows shaking with the force of it.
. “I’ll come find you when I’m whole again.”
He does this to everyone he’s ever know.  He pushes and pushes and pushes until they’re gone and there’s no resisting force because they
(See the end of the chapter for
He reassures, “I’m not going to leave, Dean, not again.” Cas seems to sense the desperation and fear Dean’s been trying to hold at bay.  Cas softens a little bit.
Cas closes the book, resting it on the seat between them.  He clears his throat. “So that I didn’t interfere with your hunting— your pursuit— of my grace.”
Several thoughts run through Dean’s mind at once.  He’s surprisingly smug about how good he’s become at sucking cock—
?  You’ve been human before— you know what it’s like—”
“Morning, sunshine,” Sam laughs over the brim of his cup, not taking his eyes off the newspaper article he’s reading.
When they finally did start hunting again, it wasn’t even really hunting.  It was training.
Dean wipes his hand off on the blanket behind him— briefly noting he’ll toss it off the bed before he falls asleep— then cups Castiel’s neck. Dean slowly traces his fingers over his shoulder, counts every rib as his fingers travel downwards, squeezes his hip briefly; then his hand reverses the journey.  This continues a few more times before Cas grabs his wrist. He brings it above Dean’s head, gently rolling them until he’s now lying half on top of Dean, his left leg hooked over Dean’s right.
His hair’s a fucking mess, he can barely hold himself together, and his body— not to mention the entirety of his being— is weak.
“We’ll find your grace.” And he means it. Because if he doesn’t then Cas would know and that would mean he would leave again. “You don’t have to go.”
Dean hears the deeper confession between those words.
The report calls for heavy thunderstorms with mild winds; nothing they can’t handle.
Cas leads the way back to the motel, and in Dean’s stupor he swears he’s taking the long way there.  The angel will stop sometimes and look up at the sky, to let the hunter catch up to him or catch his breath. Navigating the roads and sidewalks from the motel was hard enough with the crowds, but now that it’s later and there are less people, a drunken Dean finds it just as difficult.
He doesn’t know about the dancing.
Sometimes, Cas feels so large and so full with everything that is Earth, the life he’s living, being with Dean, that he doesn’t know how he’s expected to possibly fit more.  But
“If the symbols are small enough, sure we can do that.”
“I have been speaking to Hamon about certain spells...  He owes me a favor, so he’s willing to help.”
Dean catches his reflection in the rearview mirror, the confusion and desperation all too obvious in his eyes.  He immediately recalls last night’s activities, the hairs on his neck automatically standing on end.
Dean laughs with Cas now.
Suddenly his heartbeat distracts him.  It’s still pounding too fast.  His heart rarely deviates from the standard seventy beats per minute.  It’s going at least one hundred beats per minute now, and though he knows that’s still average, it’s fascinating to see how his vessel’s body changes when his grace isn’t a barrier between it and its humanity.
Dean hopes, in the most brotherly way possible, that a sober Sam will joke about how he’s hungover so he can throttle him.
Fun fact: my friend Erin (my beta) and I bought tickets to go to PittCon this summer!! I might be mildly (read: utterly) freaking out over the idea that I get to meet the actors!
“This one.”
“Yeah, well, it’d be nice if you actually said it for once, Dean,” he says coolly.  The anger that’s been knocking around inside Cas is fighting it’s way out, slowly bleeding out of him, too tired to continue fighting.
“You can’t work in the field anymore then.”  Dean knows it’s a low blow but it’s the only argument he can think of at this point.  His brain is shutting down, quick; panic setting in.  It’s fight or flight time, and his body’s forgetting everything but how to argue with Cas.
Dean bites the inside of his lip, scrubbing his face with one hand. He sighs.
Dean slams his fist down on the counter out of frustration.
He definitely hears the bitchface this time. “Fucking make this right, Dean.” A beat of silence. “And sober the hell up.” The line clicks and Dean is left alone again.
Unbelievable as it may be, I'm posting this chapter already beta'd. Shocking.
“You do?” Dean’s throat is dry.
Cas knows this is just Dean pleading with him not to help Heaven without saying as much.  But he can’t stop the anger that flares up inside him despite that. “So you just want me around to help with cases?” Dean stops pacing. “How many months did I ask you to let me hunt with you and Sam again before you finally let me?  How long did you make me
“I want to remove my grace.”
Dean’s delirious with the thought of being
“See you then.” Dean hangs up. “Looks like we can go to the motel, not much else we can do tonight, Sam is going to the coroner’s then he’ll meet us,” he relays to Cas as they head towards the main street and the bustling crowd.
For months they’ve been not saying a damn thing to each other, always ignoring what was blatantly in front of them.  Or maybe Dean was just ignoring it and Cas had been feeling just as alone as he had. Dean realizes, finally, after months, that he can’t think of Cas from his point of view, but has to see things from Cas’s side.  In trying not to think about someone besides himself, he ended up being selfish.
Dean chuckles, thinking about how weird it was to see Cas dancing in the beginning last night, his uncoordinated feet and untimed hips. “Yeah, dude is weird.”
How human he feels right now.
Castiel turns his head enough to see Hannah and Hamon out of the corner of his eye. “I will give you my answer in seventy-two hours.”
Despite the anger that the two harbored for each other during their argument, neither could deny the physical desires that weren’t being fulfilled in that same time.  Even if all Dean will get when they go back to the bunker is a kiss goodnight as Cas lays beside him,
Dean feels his chest compress itself, his heart swelling, his stomach churning. Being scared may have saved him from a lot of other situations in life, but right now he doesn’t think it will. He has Cas; whether this is Cas giving himself over or Dean finally being brought up to speed on everything, Cas is with him.  And having Cas is worth pushing past the leagues of fear inside the sea of his mind.
“Dean, please, your face— your face—” He can’t continue, not with the way Dean’s pulling on his cock.
Castiel pushes the laptop onto the tiny side table and lays back down, putting as much space between him and Dean as he can.  The other man’s chest rises and falls slowly, becoming a point of focus for Castiel as he remembers,
Suddenly every insecurity Dean has ever felt melts away from his very being, everything inside of him seems to turn to mush, and it’s all replaced with the light Cas’s lips radiate.  It fills Dean.
, Dean thinks. “You know,” he says, half turning to Cas as they walk back onto the busy street, “it probably does.”
His face softens incrementally. Cas thinks over what Dean said, taking his time to formulate a response, his thumbs soothing over Dean’s skin.
First it was the research.  Sam and him would pour for hours over texts, manuscripts, news articles, and the internet.  Sam would teach him exactly what details to look for, how to sort through the fake supernatural cases and narrow in on the real ones.
“Dean, that’s not the right tribe,” Sam notes, looking over his shoulder.
-I haven't watched the show in a couple years now but you bet your asses I was there right after the 15x18 Confession and I suffered the Spanish Dub Tumblr Crash of November 2020 and I watched the finale and will say nothing more than it was a worthless piece of entertainment that did nothing to further the character growth over the previous seasons, resolve any open conflict, or satisfy the story in a meaningful (hell, even a typical) way. And so I finish this story with a renewed love for the show that lives in our hearts and not on the screen.
“I no longer wish to be connected to Heaven,” Cas interrupts, his voice strong and soft.  Dean knows there’s more to it, but the hard line of Cas’s mouth tells him that the angel won’t say anything more.
Well, I moved again, I'm back in Austin again!
“Alright, boys, we’re going to Louisiana,” Dean announces, walking into the kitchen as Sam eats lunch and Cas stirs his coffee. “Been some hushed news about zombies. Local reports keep playing it off as overzealous Evil Dead fans but my gut tells me otherwise.”
No, Castiel found another liquor store and drank it.  Then, he came across a trio of hunters, and could tell they desired a monster to hunt.  He offered himself up.  The angel doesn’t know what he was trying to prove to myself, or disprove.  Being without his grace has given him little caution for his wellbeing and no concern for outcomes.  These hunters had never come across an angel before, didn’t have a clue what they were doing when they were trying to take him down.  Yes, all the blades hurt and the bullets stung as they punctured his weak vessel but he was still laughing when they tried to perform an exorcism on him.
“After being an angel and having spent time as a human, I know I’m capable of living without a grace.”
The car is loaded up, all the cursed objects safely nestled in the trunk, when Sam finishes getting ready.  Dean’s outside warming up the car as Sam returns their roomkeys and throws his bag in the backseat. He gets in, knocking snow off his boots per Dean’s demand.
“Sure, I’ll just ‘poof’ right out of the bunker right after I promise to suck your dick.  No, I didn’t realize you wanted that.  I was too busy doing angel things to care about your blue balls.” Cas hears the drawer to Dean’s dresser scrape open angrily. “Oh?  Were you expecting to have sex with me after your shower?” Cas stands in the doorway to Dean’s room, amused as he listens and watches Dean ready himself for bed. “I’m an angel, I do important angel-y things— that involve me leaving right before we do important sexy things— like fuck.” Dean punctuates the words by throwing back the covers on his bed.
Dean takes a deep breath and finally says, “You know why.”
Dean internally groans. “And a stupid fountain pen and paper to go with the damned wax seal set.”
Dean makes a face at his back as he picks up the turnover.  It is apple.
Cas sighs, but he tilts his head and smiles at Dean anyways.
He needs to remember what it’s like to feel unwavering hope, as he once did, years ago when he first stepped onto Earth.  He had no other choice, he had to believe Heaven and the other angels would win in the battle against Lucifer.
“Cas, I’m—” Dean’s words get cut off as the angel’s thighs spread further and his ass presses back. “Fuck, Cas, fuck, fuck,
“We know that,” Sam interjects. “But you can’t just keep doing stuff on your own because you think we think you’re weak or whatever— by the way, we don’t think you are— because eventually you’re going to do something too big for just yourself and we won’t be there.  Dean and I have been a team for a long time, that’s the only way we were able to make it this far.”
The gurney passes through a door, and everyone’s in a smaller room as they begin assessing Dean more closely.
He knew he’d talk to Dean about everything one day, even talk about the two of them, but now that the conversation is here…  He’s dragging the words out of Dean; Dean fighting back tooth and nail, trying to keep his hardened exterior in place, all his defenses coming up.  Cas didn’t want it to happen this way at all, with Dean and him spitting hostility between each other.  He wanted Dean to finally feel safe talking about this, and right now he knows Dean is unmeasurably scared.  But Cas needs to hear it, he needs to hear Dean say it.
Cas runs his fingers over the handprint etched on Dean’s skin, sending a shiver through him. “Well.” There’s something teasing in Cas’s voice. “I’d like to do it before people start mistaking you for my father, which already happens often enough as it is.”
“It could just be a serial killer then, you know?  Some crazy bastard that just has it out for the people in this town.”
Dean blushes but pushes past the nerves. “Castiel, I promise I’ll make it good for you, baby.” Dean allows himself to think about it. “God,
, he thinks,
Cas looks at his bloodied hands again, understanding what she is asking. “He attacked us...he’s still in the...alley.” Cas has to remember to go back and get his angel blade and…
Dean opens his mouth to reply but stops when Castiel’s eyes sharpen. “Listen to me, Dean. For once,
And so Dean takes.
Another stab of guilt, completely Dean’s own fault.
“I think it’s relatively the same area though, that they went missing in,” Cas comments.
Cas hums in response.
The long ride to the bunker is much the same.  Cas rereads the book he brought with him, still marking anything wrong he missed the first time around.  He only puts it down when Dean starts humming along with the Aerosmith coming from the radio. Then it’s back to not interacting. Dean knows he should do something, say something.
The catalyst of change in Dean’s life is a day as normal as any other.
This hasn't been beta'd yet (again), but once it has, I will post it again. Enjoy!
Cas can’t get a grip on Dean, his fingers slipping on the blood soaking them both.
Suddenly it occurs to Dean that Cas hasn’t even said
“Castiel, wait, please,” this time it is Hamon who speaks.  Castiel does not turn around, he only slows down. “I have not forgotten the debt I owe you.  That is why I came here…  I ask you now, Castiel, on the behalf of this garrison, please, consider leading us against Metatron.  We will not ask anymore of you after this task is completed.  Please, Castiel, one last victory.”
, but in a good way and he tries not to think about it. "I have been trying to understand since before Purgatory.  Since...I rescued you from heaven, from Zachariah."
“The dude doesn’t have anything with his name on it.”
“How many times have we seen this, Dean?” He pulls a couple beers out of the fridge before sitting back down.  Sam knows what Dean needs before he does.
Cas pulls back again, Dean immediately feels dull without Cas’s light filling him. “You said you didn’t want me ‘zapping’ us anywhere.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean swipes at his eyes.
“Yeah, well, it’s always ‘one last time,’ Cas.  They’re never going to stop bothering you if you just keep saying yes to every one of their pleas.  You don’t have to always solve their problems, you have your own life to live.  Besides, c’mon, you know we’ve got a case to handle anyways.  You can’t let me take on a pack of vamps by myself.”
“They’re not all human remains,” Cas reassures Dean when his face contorts.
Cas smiles when Dean’s mouth falls open against his t-shirt, his snoring quieter now.  He places his headphones back in and starts the second recording.
“Castiel, we need your knowledge and guidance about the matter at hand.”
He sighs, tired of his brother's remarks about his ‘rabbit food.’ “It has cheese on it already, besides there’s bacon on it too,” he notes, jokingly offering his brother one of the so-small-barely-passes-as-bacon bacon bits.
Cas stands awkwardly, trying to remember how Dean’s shoulders were more relaxed when walking as he pretended to be drunk.
“Turn over, on your stomach, Cas?” Dean asks, looking up.
Dean asks a couple more questions about the case, to make sure it’s finished, then tells Cas he’s going to catch a few more hours of sleep before they slip out, the exhaustion becoming too much.  Cas nods, telling Dean he’ll have everything ready to go when they need to leave.
Edit 3/21/16: has been beta'd!
“Dean?” The hunter flips the page in the book, trying to hold onto reality. “I want to remove my grace.”  Another page, and another, and another…  He keeps flipping pages, as if he’ll find the answer to Cas’s
“Woah…,” he breathlessly whispers.  Cas uses the pads of his fingers to draw trails back up Dean’s legs, feeling every movement, and the twitches that become too obvious once he reaches the line where boxer briefs cover skin.  Fingers itch underneath the hem, searching.
to help, my grace was not being resolutely directed by Heaven anymore…  God gave humans the ability to choose, he did not do the same for us angels.  But for whatever reason, and many of us have theories as to why, my grace’s function has become less purposeful to Heaven.  Some think it is because of the time I have spent as a human, when I was given the power of choice and free will, and that somehow has “infected” my grace.  Of course, there are surely ways to reverse it, if I wished.  But that’s not what I want.
An image of Cas and Dean laying on the couch actually watching a damn movie flashes across Castiel’s mind.
He doesn’t reply because no matter if he says he has or he hasn’t it won’t be the answer Cas wants. He needs his grace, not Dean’s sympathy.
Dean picks up his, cracking it open and drinking before answering, “It’s my favorite movie, man, let me have this, it’s Christmastime.” He does his best impression of Sam’s puppy dog eyes.
It almost feels like a normal day, normal by other humans’ standards even.
“You wanna play, Sammy, see who the better player is?  Or how about darts?  I always beat your ass at darts.”  Dean appreciates the easiness of the banter between him and his brother.
“Stop moving him, Rucker!”
His brain skips town once he steps out the door, the fresh air wiping his mind blank.
“Deal. Night, Dean.”
He leans against the table next to Dean, ducking his head and waiting for Dean to look up.  The hunter shakes his head and does so, his knee starting to bounce.
The game tapers to an end, Sam passed out on the couch since the beginning of the fourth quarter and Cas focused on rolling the empty beer bottle between his palms. Dean hasn’t even been watching, he didn’t even notice when his team scored with a hail Mary pass. He cleans the dishes alone tonight. He comes back into the television room, throwing a blanket over Sam (
.” Dean gags on the word. “We’re just together, okay, god…” He feels himself about to puke again, his stomach heaving.
“You don’t understand.” Cas harshly punctures the darkness with his words. “You’ve never had the power of the universe coursing through you all to be taken away in an instant.” He’s angry but Dean’s pushing out the sympathy in him; he’s pushing it out so he doesn’t have to deal with the thought of wanting to get up and hug Cas. “You will resurrect Sam however many times you need to but the moment I want help finding my grace you lose motivation.”
“I taught Cas how to hustle pool, we got a little plastered in the process.” It wasn’t a lie; it just wasn’t the truth.
fucking soldier or savior or whatever.
Dean looks over his shoulder at Cas.  His eyes are sad and the angel wishes they weren’t.
Cas wants to reach out and comfort Dean but he feels rooted to the spot, Dean’s words rendering him motionless.
“And I care about him.”  Dean’s definitely going to puke.  He pulls Baby over to the shoulder of the road, punching on her hazard lights.  Pushing open the door, he hangs his head out the side waiting for the bile to come up.  The rush of icy air hits him hard.
“I do have wings,” Cas says naively, not understanding.
The angel looks up at Dean and he sits down on the bed next to him.
.  The sun visor’s mirror doesn’t lie— there’s the bruise of a hickey peeking out from the collar of his shirt.
“I found two more cases in my research last night,” Cas admits finally.
Three beers later for Dean, two for Sam, and none for Cas, all three men are yelling at the screen as the ref doesn’t call another foul seconds before the opposing team makes a home run.
Cas hums, looking up from his book.
“Soup. Lisa used to make it when Bed had a big exam at school.”  Dean looks up at Cas but he can’t read the expression in his eyes.
Cas bites his cheek at the words, digging his nails a little more into Dean’s back.
He’s felt so helpless since he’s come back from Heaven.
I'm doing something a little different with the next chapter, but I hope y'all will enjoy it.  Stay tuned for more information.
“Also,” Cas pipes in, sitting down across from Sam, “voodoo is clearly involved, but there were no clues left at the crime scene.  Maybe at the rest there will be.”
“Cas,” he whispers, and the angel feels the excitement radiating from his body though he gives nothing away physically. “We got it back.”
Edit 10/6/15: has been beta'd!
Cas was his salvation then, and still is now.  He keeps Dean together and moving forward without Dean even realizing it.  Cas will keep his hand on Dean’s thigh while he drives, calming the nerves he still sometimes gets heading out to a particularly strange case.  He will listen to Dean’s rants about “no good bastards” when they figure out the monster’s motive, his patience far exceeding Dean’s.  He’ll help Dean cook whenever he asks, their syncrosity in the kitchen surprising Dean until he remembers how well they fight together, both when cornering a monster and arguing with each other.
Cas swallows thickly.  It’s difficult. “He was— there was a fight, he was stabbed.”
He keeps his distance from Cas while getting ready, averting his gaze anytime he feels himself searching for those navy eyes.  With his bag packed and roomkey returned, Dean decides to wait in the car while Cas finishes dressing.
” Cas repeats into Dean’s mouth as he continues tiny thrusts, as if he can’t seem to make his hips stop. “C’mon,
The question rests on his tongue, straining against his lips.  If he asks the question, then it will be real.  If this becomes real then it can be lost.  Dean doesn’t want to lose this, so he doesn’t acknowledge it.
“Dean, I want to remove my grace,” Cas says, as casually as possible, while both their heads are bowed over books.
Dean coughs again, the truth seeming to erode his throat in its efforts to escape his lips. “Uh, Cas.  Cas, Sam and I were scared.” He doesn’t want to say why but he has to. “Scared of you.”
?  The whole concept of hunting revolves around its inherent danger.  No one, no matter how good a hunter, knows exactly how a hunt will end.  The possibilities are endless when it comes to cases; Dean has been sidelined by a thirteen year old girl, he’s mind-melded with a dog, his life was turned into a television show, he’s had to babysit a shapeshifter.  Not knowing what to expect from a case, at one point, was thrilling; now with the thought of Cas’s mortality in mind, it’s terrifying.
Dean freezes like a deer in headlights.  He barely grabs a dish towel to cover himself before Sam comes bumbling in, a yawn stretching his mouth wide, not even attempting to turn the light on. Sam stops, eyes still half shut as he opens a cabinet, hands reaching into the darkness searching for the pills.
The hunter can tell he is being stared at intently. “I remember you distinctly telling me, not but a few hours ago, that I still had a lot to learn in the way of hunting Winchester-style.”
“Dean, we’re home,” Cas tells him, opening the back door.  Dean rubs his hands over his face as he wakes up. “C’mon, let’s get you some food in you and a memory foam mattress under you.”
Sam looks at Dean with an expression he’s never seen before.  He should stop now before he says too much.
The angel perches himself on a stool, opting to watch Dean finish cooking instead of responding.
The body crumples in a heap, and Cas flings it up into the air, relishing in the sound of the bones cracking as it hits the asphalt.
“Dude, you look stupid.”
“C’mon, lets see what she was talking about.” They step inside the building, the entrance looks normal enough. “I wonder what she meant by ‘whole damned building.’”
Cas is looking down at the book, shame radiating from his body, his shoulders carrying the brunt of that pain. “No, I don’t remember.”
Sam and Dean trade a worried glance. “What the hell did you do?” Dean says, the words tumbling out of his mouth much too quickly.  He’s worried.  The coffee and donuts were only meant to butter them up, not to celebrate god-knows-what.
Dean shifts against Cas’s chest, one hand coming up to cover Cas’s. “Uh-uh, I wasn’t saying a thing.  I’m just getting ready for bed since you didn’t appear to want to watch a movie,” he mocks.
●	The Mark of Cain subplot is thrown out the window (this has nothing to do with how it was a horrible, poorly planned, careless plot by the writers, with a less than ideal solution)
One night he’s lying under the window as Dean did when he first brought him here.  Staring up at the stars, looking for the ones he visited so long ago.
Cas sits quietly while Dean unwraps the slender box encasing his present.
As they lay in bed later (after Dean comes twice from Cas’s mouth alone and repays him with fervent hands and fingers), Dean finally allows Cas the opportunity to explain.
And I just want you to be here as long as possible,” he rushes out in one short breath.
“No, it’s not.” It sounds like he’s shouting Dean knows he’s not. “Fine, I’ll just leave again until I find it.” The thought of Cas leaving again scares Dean, and he can’t pinpoint why.
“Yes, that was a joke.” Both men laugh.
“We didn’t say you were, Cas.” Sam is exasperated, already tired of this conversation because he’s had it with his brother so many times. “We just need you to understand, in this line of work, this life, it works out much better if you are on a team.”
Dean trusted him; he told Castiel and trusted Castiel not to let that happen again.
Dean coughs again. “You weren’t thinking about sausage biscuits.” He gestures to the list then flips his turn signal on.
Cas ignores it for the first couple minutes, not understanding where his thoughts are, not knowing how he could possibly answer.
He grabs a twenty-four pack from under the shelves in the kitchen and two more bottles of whiskey that he’d had hidden in the back of the freezer. It’s going to be a long night for the both of them.
Now Dean sits in a back table explaining the finer points of hustling pool to Cas, who seems to understand.
“I’m gonna go rub this in Garth’s fucking face— that idiot thought his team could beat mine. As if.” With that said, Sam saunters to his room, already practicing his “winning song” that poor Garth will soon be subject to.
“And now Hamon has agreed to help me.  There’s a spell, not much unlike a ceremony, that would allow for my grace to completely detach from my soul with little ill effect.  Because even when I was human before, my soul still yearned for what my grace had to give, it knew it was was missing something.  With this spell, it would no longer feel the connection.  Hamon said he would alert me when he has everything he needs for this spell, and that I can decide to complete it when I am ready.”
,” he breathes.
Dean can’t remember the last time his nerves felt as raw as right now. “Cas, how long did we fucking look for your grace?  This shit all of us went through to get that back!  And now you’ve had it just over a year and you want to rip it out again?”
consumes Dean again, having only ever felt it for the first time last night.
Sam calls him as he’s heading to bed.  Whispering into the phone, he confirms where Cas is, “What the fuck did you do to make Cas show up on my door shit-faced and pass out before even crossing the threshold?” He’s not whispering by the end, clearly angry.
In the middle of the night Dean wakes up, and it’s too dark to see anything but Cas sitting at the foot of the bed, the desk pulled up to him with the laptop on its surface.  Dean’s covered now and his shoes are off.  Slowly, he moves his foot until it’s pressing against Cas’s thigh; Cas looks at the shape of the leg under the sheet but not up at Dean’s face, then he goes back to work on the laptop.  Dean falls back asleep, still clutching Cas’s tie.
He nudges Sam out of the way, to fix my own tie. Dean quirks my eyebrow at him, a silent question he understands.
After a moment, “Is there anything else you’d like to know now?” Cas asks, stretching under Dean, his hands pressing to the headboard and back arching.
Cas is trying to remember if Sam dropped any hints about these recordings over the past year.  He probably thought Cas would find them sooner…
all in the little box reserved for what he wants engraved.
“It has spirit, man,” he says, to no one in particular.
“What if I—?”
(See the end of the chapter for
.  And his breathing is finally not only gasping.  Dean’s body is fascinating as well.  The blush occurs sometimes, like right now his chest and neck are flushed the color of sunsets from the Hadean eon, pink and blue and orange and magenta and gold and beige all at once.  The freckles that Castiel counted once but hadn’t told Dean because he knew the reaction would not be the one he was hoping for.  The stubble growing on his cheeks, a welcome scratch as Castiel’s mouth lazily licks across his jaw.  All these marks that make Dean the man he is even though other humans have them too.
He pulls his fingers out and grabs his cock, instant relief flooding him as he forces himself not to stroke along its length. “Cas, babe, I think—”
“But...I’m— well...you’re it for me,” he grumbles into the crook of Cas’s neck.
He rolls off Cas now, nervousness and uncertainty taking center stage as he thinks about what he’s said.
The door opens as Cas slides back in the room, clutching two bottles of bourbon in the less injured of his arms. Dean sits up, extending his hand, and Cas knows to give him a bottle. Dean closes his eyes as he takes more than a couple swigs from the bottle before his throat tightens too much to continue. Cas has almost finished his bottle in the same time.
Cas recognizes an apology when he hears one.  He unfolds himself from the bed and pulls on a pair of sweats from the floor.  He half-expects to open the door and for Dean to be gone.
— he’s focused on the laptop he pulled up in front of him.  A few more minutes of deep breathing, and Dean thinks he can take on this bowl of cereal.
Angrily, the angel flips on to his back, cursing the ceiling and heavens above him.  His grace slowly finds its way to his surface, licking at the edges of his vessel searching to heal.
“Yeah, I guess,” Sam agrees. “But, up until this point, he’s been living a nomad’s life, hasn’t he?  I don’t think he’s used to keeping stuff, y’know?” His expression is still unreadable.
“Dean, I asked if we had any tylenol in here?”
The angel purses his lips at this. “You cannot hear my thoughts.”
Dean catches his friend’s expression and sees the pain still echoing behind those navy eyes.
The ugly voice inside Dean tells him to shut up, to not listen, to find the lie between the words.  But that light that Cas shines so bright in Dean’s life silences it before it starts to make sense.  Dean wants to cry, somehow it feels appropriate in this moment, but the curve of Cas’s smile stops him.
— at bay. Just because Cas initiated what happened tonight...doesn’t mean he actually enjoys what they’re doing.
“Cas and I—” Dean literally has no clue how to say what he needs to say. Sam is willing to talk right now, and so is some part of Dean, so he should just get it over with. If he waits any longer, it’ll only going to get worse.
But Cas finally understood when he caught the expression on Dean’s face one day they were working a case in upstate New York.  Dean was fighting so hard with himself, he wanted so badly to let Cas touch him when they were in some bar, three drinks in their system, but the anxiety quelling inside Dean was palpable.  He wanted to, but society said he couldn’t, society was telling him he should ‘man up’ and ‘act like a man.’  And it hit Cas, in that moment he was able to relate absolutely to the fear of doing what was considered wrong, what was considered abominable, no matter how
Dean turns left instead of right and follows the directions Sam gives him until they’re in front of an antique shop.
Cas knew not to expect one certain reaction from Dean when he finally told him about what the angels were asking of him.  But after arguing about it for the past forty minutes, he’s regretting telling him so nonchalantly in the first place.  He should have given Dean some warning first.
One time in particular, while Sam was out picking up dinner, and he was finishing up his fighting training with Dean, Castiel had had enough.  Dean had been going easy on him the entire time, worry behind his eyes ever since Castiel had mentioned something about a sigil he noticed carved into the hallway.  As they were finishing up— on Dean’s command because Castiel didn’t feel done yet— Castiel pushed Dean against the edge of one of the workout machines.  Dean’s back pressed against the steel frame while Castiel pushed against his chest.
