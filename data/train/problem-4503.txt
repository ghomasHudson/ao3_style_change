It took three days and nights for Dean to appear better. He woke up feeling back to his usual self. One of the girl’s had opened a window, and the soft breeze felt cool on his flushed face. He could detect the sea air and hear the soothing waves on the seashore.
“Stay close,” commanded Kedi, his eye alert for any movement in the lingering shadows of darkness that shrouded them.
“I had the strangest feeling come over me, so I went back into the other room. Everyone, creature, was still. None moved, but I could feel there gaze upon me. Then I noticed this woman; she was going to stab the commander, so I ran and stabbed her. We never got to talk about it.” Joe shrugged.
“This is killing you, Dean; can’t they understand that?” Charlie sniffed, touching her friend’s hand.
“Yes, Dean, sit down.” Castiel pointed to a seat near his desk. “I just received the word; Samandriel will watch Sam. I can trust him, and he’s looking forward to the task.”
Gabriel gets Dean out of the agency for the weekend. The angel investigates and gets to the bottom of whos been targeting Dean.
John Winchester stood near his car, the 67 Chevy Impala that Dean loved. John never took care of baby, never treasured her like he and his mom once did. The man had a ratty coat on and what looked like a dirty tee-shirt underneath. His jeans were halfway down his ass, and pooling at his feet. The man’s hair was long grey and lank like he had not had a shower in months, his face unshaven and twisted into an ugly grimace.
“Watch out,” called Dean in horror as John rushed the angel. They both fell back on to the road. They tussled and rolled over each other, trying to gain dominance of the situation. Their grunts and shouts could be heard over the rain. Uriel bashed John’s head on the road and he stilled. Binding his arms with his grace. The angel, however, had the blade sticking out of his chest cavity, not quite killing him, his grace leaking into the ether.
Castiel lifted the man higher of the grown. The angel’s other hand enveloped his neck, pressing tighter. John’s hands still chained to the floor, and the chain went taught. John gasped for breath, like a fish out of water.
Dean turned around to examine at the older girl. His forest green eyes were listless. Charlie noticed that his hair needed cutting, and she tenderly brushed it out of his eyes.
“Cassie, it’s time to celebrate, and I want to try your cake.” Dean giggled at the delighted look on his friend’s face.
“What on earth are you doing, Dean? I will have the commander after me.” Harry pushes Dean hard, falling he hits his head on a table.
My brains got ideas but can I get them down on paper or computer. Frustration, if it's not clear let me know, I've re-written it like five hundred times.
Mertha replied in a bemused tone. “Okay, Michael, pick Dean up after breakfast tomorrow. Take him home after your done for the day. Tell him Castiel wants to spend some time alone.”
Dean sat staring out at the San Francisco Peaks. The day was pleasant, and he could see the Aspen groves. The swirls of colours greeted his eyes greedily. Orange, reds and yellows painted the distant vista. Dean walked along the lively thoroughfares; people were meeting families, busy working and meeting old friends. He wished he had that, someone, that wanted him. Strolling past a baker’s the smell of fresh bread and baked goods penetrated the air. The loud siren of a police car struck his senses. Dean flew again and settled at meteor crater.
“John Winchester appeared in court today. The van stopped, and the guards murdered. He was the sole prisoner on the truck. Johns, missing we have no clue of his whereabouts.”
Castiel saw Adam and Joe swiftly move forward. Joe reached for the fallen angel blade, Adam had one from his mate. They reached the Fate together and stabbed her in the back. Her pained screams rang out, her eyes wide with the implication of the fact.
‘ Castiel grabbed his blade and hoisted it high, crying out a celestial battle alarm, and started hacking at the hangings on the wall.
“You can; you’re my good boy, so good for me Dean.” Castiel drives into Dean’s hot tight hole, pounds, hard and fast, long and slow, his cock catching on his walls, dragging out the pleasure, catching the little bundle of nerves inside his boy.
They sat and ate their lunch, talking about the shops they had been into when Dean gave his angel the present.
“You’re most welcome.” the angel went away, and Dean placed his textbook down and glanced at the letters. One was a silver and gold envelope, and one was plain white.
“That’s awesome.” Dean beamed, he felt so happy after everything that had happened, but sad that Uriel had to die. His face dropped, and his smile vanished.
Dean let anybody else off first and snaked his way to the front of the bus. The driver stood up, blocking his exit. A sense of dread slid down his spine, and he clutched his bag.
“Dean, tell Castiel about your dreams. He would appreciate how you possess the knowledge of the handprint.” the God coaxed softly.
With that, the light vanished, and God with them. In his place, there was an angel. The angel was tall, with short blonde hair and steel-blue eyes. Castiel almost cried with joy at seeing his older brother.
Castiel’s eyes were a luminous red. Deans’ eyes would not answer him until he had his first heat, but that did not matter to the angel. He was going to mark him, so everybody knew on God’s green earth and in the Heavens above that this wondrous creature was all his and his alone.
“Nope, I kid you not. I think Gabriel’s acting on that, making it safer for us. Raz says there’s a way to get around everything in life. Like a loophole. I guess that comes from having a dad as a KOH.”
“Yeah, it is. Grab your bag. It’s time to leave.” the brothers went down the stairs, and Missouri was waiting for them.
“Not got your protectors anymore, Winchester,” smirked Joel, laughing with pleasure to have the boy alone.
They spent much of the evening eating hot buttery popcorn and candy supplied by Mertha. Making the common area look wonderful for the ceremony. They established a large stage by the far wall and chairs in a semicircle. Dean decorated the podium in blue and green, the agency’s colours. Everything was clean, shiny and ready for the next day’s ceremony.
Castiel smirked, going into stealth mode. He was a warrior after all, and his alpha relished this chase. Days ago, he thought he had lost his home for good. Dean was his everything. If the world ended tomorrow, he would continue to Heaven a happy angel, if he could share Dean’s Heaven, even better. Dean was half-human after all and would require one.
Anna had made up tiny bouquets for all the girls keeping with the soft colours of the dresses. Making buttons holes for the men in the same colours to match the theme of the bonding ceremony. She had researched human culture to get this part right.
Castiel did something he had not done since he was a fledgeling. He gathered his older brother into his arms.“Thank you, Gabey, I love you.”
“Where the hell is my son? And where the hell is my money?” yelled John. Hated being treated like he was nobody.
Castiel chuckled, liking how he affected his boy. Holding on to Dean a little tighter, his fingers pressed into his lover’s bicep.
Dean could not hear what Castiel was shouting. Every word, barb and name slashed his skin, broke his bones, and tarnished his soul. The pain was worse than anything his dad at thrown at him. Dean had known his dad had hated him. It was far worse because he loved Castiel, so the words stung because the angel truly meant every word he was saying.
The alpha angel takes his tee-shirt, jeans and socks off. Leaving his boxers on, leaving little to the imagination. Dean’s eyes become large when he discovers the outline of the angels think cock nestled in the thin material. Castiel pulls Dean towards him and strokes his hands up and down the other’s side.
“Thank you, thank you Cas.” Dean sniffed, kissing his angel on the cheek. The omega looked around and turned red. “Whoops, sorry commander.”
Dean whistled when he saw all the banknotes. “There must be five hundred dollars here, Adam. I can’t take this.”
The angels just grinned. “Let’s show Dean his present first.” laughed Michael out loud. All three angels grabbed their corresponding mate, and the world spun.
“He’s a busy angel. Don’t assume for one moment Castiel does not cherish you, Dean.” admonished Cam.
Before you shout, the next chapter is coming. Remember there is no MCD in this story, I love our boys just nope. I could never go there.
Hannah smiles at him and ushered him into an extensive white room. It bears a bed and a table with medical equipment on it. There are scales, a height chart, and a bank of lockers.
Dean laid back on the bed and closed his eyes. Fingers carded through his hair tenderly and the mattress sagged. Castiel hummed an Enochian lullaby, soothing Dean, and he sighed in blissful contentment.
“No worry’s Kiddo, it gives you, Thursdays, to work on the projects I give you and if you need me for any help, you know I’m around that day.”
“I wish I could communicate with Castiel. I feel cut off here.” Dean hated the feeling of the oppressive dark, wanting to touch his mate.
Twenty minutes after Charlie had gone, she did not look happy when she came back.“The parasite squad is about, let’s walk you to the elevators.”
Castiel walked over to Dean. The angel peered into the Omega’s soul. It was like peering into a supernova, shimmering in golds, reds, and greens. The brightest soul of a righteous man he would become. It took Castiel’s breath away, and he didn’t need to breathe.
Castiel knelt next to Dean. “Little omega, I’ve loved you from the first moment I saw the pain in your jade green eyes. Dean, your soul, burnt so bright it blinded me. I wanted to take your pain away and replace it with happiness. I want to fill your days with joy. I will forever love you, Dean. The answer will be forever yes.”
Castiel came strolling through the door and enveloped his mate into a tight embrace. “I have missed you love.”
The angels thinking no human was that advanced in their language; ignored those around them. Dean understood, and when the short man with honey eyes finished the joke, the younger boy had to laugh.
Hannah smiled. “It means human appointed guard, Castiel will appoint one for you in case he can’t take you out.”
Gabriel went still and tipped his head to one side like he was listening to someone. “Hannah’s calling for us; says its urgent brother.” With a flurry of wings, the two angels flew to the lobby of the agency.
Castiel reaches and kisses Dean’s hand, pulling him in for an embrace.“We will have time to get back to the real world, for now, I just want it to be us.”
Dean spots Adam near a group of bushy trees and the boy waves. The older boy climbs between them, and Dean follows. On the other side is a rotten fence. Adam moves the fence, and the older boy jumps through. On the other side was a dusty road, it's quiet, and does not have much traffic moving along it.
“Thanks for breakfast guys. Will it be okay if I shower now? I smell awful.” Dean sniffed at himself and pulled a face.
“Castiel and Dean, as your hands are bound, now, so your lives and spirits are joined in the union of a bond. The bond, of love, trust and always. You are now mated for life, only seeking each other’s comfort, in solace and happiness. Above you are stars and below you are earth. Like the stars, your love should be a constant source of light, and like the earth, a firm foundation from which to grow. May this bond be blessed on this day and forevermore. May you always have the strength to hold each other during the storms, stress and the dark of disillusionment. May this bond remain tender as the hands that bind you, nurture each other in their wondrous love. May those hands that bind the bond heal, protect, shelter, and guide each other.”
“The Necrophile, breed, and that’s how we have vampires, shapeshifters, and all manners of ungodly creatures plaguing the earth,” Castiel told his mate.
“You took it and ripped that up? It was a gift, you, dick.” Dean pushed the bully down onto the floor. “Leave my friend’s alone, that’s your only warning.”
The bus pulled into the station, and he let most of the people get off. The bus driver eyed him with curious caution.
I did google search on the names of the areas, if I get anything wrong please let me know. With Kindness x
“Cas, no,” Dean yelled out. Mallory chuckled and moved her hand, and he flew at the wall, breaking the plaster. He could not move, she had immobilised him. Her diamond eyes glinted with indefatigable glee. Castiel was still down for the count. She stomped on his hand with ten-inch black pointed heels and laughed aloud.
Dean also changed his food allowance; made clear he could eat anything. Castiel put a restriction on dessert and candy, but he had taken that off. The angel was not interested in him, so who was he to say what he could or could not eat.
“We need to walk back through to the angel side. No angels can fly out of this site anymore. We have imposed more stringent security measures.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes and huffed, but stood down. “Chuck, you dare come into my nest after we’ve just mated? Do you have a death wish?”
“Thank you, Dean. Castiel, for keeping him safe. I will always be in your debt.” Michael bowed low in respect.
Castiel cleared his throat. The brothers were studying him with amusement. “I would have told you, love; it’s- I was getting there.”
“At first I assumed nothing of them. Most of my life I have experienced visions in shadows like old black and white movies. Then over and over I saw stars, not unlike the night’s sky but with five points like a splayed hand. All I could see were wings and a sword. I puzzled over this but could never understand what I was seeing. Until Cas left a mark on my skin.”
December arrived peppered with frost and ice. The night’s cold and the days warmer in comparison. The angels and the humans got ready for the Feast of the East. It was the celebration of life, family and the bond between mates. No one missed Christmas; it was roughly the same. Mertha was busy in the kitchen and Dean and a few other omegas who could cook offered to help. The varied fares available fascinated Dean. Although angels did not eat, humans and Nephilim alike needed food, and Gabriel had announced he liked the food, so why not indulge?
There came a knock on the door, and a female stepped in with a stethoscope around her neck. “This is Pam she’s our physician, specialises in human health. Dean, I’m going to talk to Pam just for a moment in angel language it will be swifter, I don’t want you to think we are rude.”
Everyone ate, and the chatter grew boisterous and merry. Smiles and love for each other were at the table that night. Dean’s heart hurt, so he slipped away, not choosing to bring anybody’s mood down. No one saw him leave, that his clothes were slightly bulky. The moon was high that night, its white fingers showing him the way his only shadowy companion.
Dean stood glaring at Castiel, his fists clenched by his sides. He moved as if to step forward, and Charlie seized his arm. Castiel turned his head and shook it lightly. The angel’s piercing blue eyes were boring into his skull. The omega closed his eyes and exhaled a single tear rolled down his freckled cheek.
Castiel turned red eyes on to his mate. His alpha voice was leaking out slightly. “You will do what I tell you. Flee if I’m not back.”
The next day Adam left with his mate, and Dean was now undoubtedly by himself. He had made friends, but not as close as Adam and Charlie. No one’s he could trust with his secrets.
“Dean sweetie?” questioned Hannah, studying the child with sadness in her brown eyes. “What’s wrong?”
“We will amplifier your voices,” Galgalliel told the brothers, helping Castiel to hold Eremiel while the commander swung his sword to protect the omegas.
“I have foretold the apocalypse in every culture on this planet since the world began. The book of revelations is one book of the bible that has it correct. Well, part right, it speaks of stars and angels. This is the two of you. You’re in this plan so you can stop the Fates. There is no battle of an evil creature; it’s the humans that are doing this to the planet I created. They have pillaged and killed, themselves, and animals. The seas are rising, and the air polluted. The Fates want the humans gone, eradicated. They want hell on earth and nothing left but themselves.”
“What now?” Bobby turned his head between Dean and Cas. Castiel showed them his unique ring, and they both admired it.“Well, that’s different, good for you for putting both traditions together.”
“Nice to meet you, dude. So, Charlie tells me you take an Enochian class. They’re kicking my ass to take something on a Tuesday and Thursday morning.”
“Charlie, everyone seems to fear Castiel. Why?” Everyone, even Jace, seemed to have an odd reaction to him.”
“That won’t be a problem. My best friends aren’t at the school anymore. They are the only ones I trust with that kind of information.”
To Dean, Castiel smells like dark chocolate, smoked black coffee, and cloves. There is invariably a sense of danger with his angel, but an edge of sweetness that alone he understands. It’s a taste he knows he could not survive without. Dean holds on for dear life, grasping on to the thick black silky hair of his angel while long nimble fingers trace his thigh and get deliciously near their intended target.
“That we do.” Castiel laughed and hugged Dean tight, kissing his forehead. “I have missed you, darling boy.”
“You don’t know that Mr Winchester, they can’t test for it yet.” snarled Jody, staring the man down.
The next day the omega avoided his friends. He had completed his homework, preferring to accomplish that in his room. Going down into the common area, Dean saw the angel again speaking to Joel, Raz and Zad. They did not look overly happy.
“Dean, its fine, I will always love you never forget.” rasped the angel bravely in front of his adversary.
“They can identify if we have equipment like that, it will flag on the system. Even Anna as access to the sites I access you have to be careful.” Charlie tells her friend. “I have a spare, I can get it now, and it’s an iPad. I can switch the censors off for your room.”
“Cassie, you did the decent thing in sending Charlie to Dean. He’s not been doing fantastic, this last week or two. He’s been feeding off your mood, your emotions.” Castiel was about to protest, but the archangel stopped him. “Hear me out. Why would Chuck be testing you? Keeping you away from Dean? That boy is special, and so are you, baby brother. Why do you think they take notice of you more than they do, Michael?”
“Not to worry, love, it will be my pleasure.” Crowley cackles, and his eyes flicker red. The demon picks John up like he weighs nothing. “Come, son, we have an interesting lesson today.”
“No, brother, he’s placed a sigil on the door. It will injure you. There is no way out for you. You would just be a light ricocheting off the walls.”
The garden was empty. Dean could hear the soft trickle of water. Tall trees towered up high into the brilliant bright blue forget-me-not sky. The scent of flowers fills his nose with wafts of perfume. Dean walks over a bamboo bridge. A crooked pond lays beneath, and he sees fish’s swim to the surface catching flies.
The others watched on with determined faces, never to let Dean’s birthday pass with him being alone and feeling unloved again.
“You were correct, sir. Hael, Jace and Uriel sneaked Joel and Raziel into the agency. They are both Jace's and Hael’s mates. They carried out a trade, they did not want to mate, the angels nor the humans. Heal, and Jace paid them off. Uriel joined the fray because he demanded punishment on Dean after what the commander did to him. It sounds like we have another rogue angel in his garrison.”
“Nonsense, Castiel’s older than you.” the angel chuckled at the absurdity of the age gap. “It would be a sweet touch, bringing both angel and human traditions together.”
“Yes, I can use my arms,” Dean mutters sarcastically. The omega opened the door and wheel his way back to his room.
In a slight daze, he found a laundromat. Washing his clothes an hour passed, and he folded his clean clothes back into his bag. Looking around for accommodation, he found an omega hotel. More costly than a motel, but after what transpired today, he felt spooked and just wanted to feel safe. He could get more money out if he desired. If only he knew his uncle’s contact number being this close, he could pick him up.
“Sorry, Mertha, but Adam, Charlie and I are having a food fight at suppertime.” Dean grinned cheekily at the angel.
“No, Dean, we have to take the right tunnel, that will lead us to the human Hell. I have no inkling where the left tunnel will lead us.”
Soft, blue eyes glanced down and wiped golden tears from his young lover’s face. “You love me; it gives me the strength to carry on. We will have time, for now, let us go make Earth rejoice.”
The young Omega looked around the foyer; angels were milling around, dressed in varying styles of clothes: some business suits, some casual jeans, and t-shirts, dresses and sandals. They were busy, but they don’t seem angry or dicks like his dad said they would be.
Sam pulled Dean towards the house, but even with his family by his side, he still did not get that sense of home his soul yearned for.
Dean turned around and dropped the blade. It went with a clatter onto the road. And he falls into Castiel’s arms.
The archangel leaves, and Dean’s left puzzled. “We set all levels of tasks for our mates; they can’t move on until they have fulfilled them. You’re the first in the higher ranks to have achieved level one.”
“Pleased to meet you, Dean my names Hannah I’m a Thrones angel. I need you to come with me to test your health,” Hannah holds out her hand, and Dean looks wondering if he should accept it.
“I’m just so excited, I never considered what I would do when I left here. I felt like I was drifting out to sea on the widest ocean. Then Castiel came and threw me a life raft and pulled me in. You’re my family, I get that now. I get that Sammy and Uncle Bobby loves me. Adam and Charlie have always been there for me. I don’t know how I missed that. I feel like I have just woken up after a long sleep. I’ve walked out of a dark tunnel, and I can see a light flicker. I want to move towards it now.” Dean gasped for breath after such a long speech.
“Hannah, there was an incident this morning, Dean’s missing, and we suspect he left out of the front door.”
Hannah looked at Pam and sighed. “Sweetie, he will want you and will take care of you. I promise you that.”
Gabriel stood with John in the holding room. Crowley materialised with Zad. They both bowed in respect.
“Pam, inform me when he’s awake I need to talk to him, but only when he’s stronger. I need to advise Michael. Adam needs putting under scrutiny until we get both Charlie and Dean’s side of the story.”
“That’s your new project then. Now be good for Missouri, she’s a white witch, so maybe she will teach you a thing or two.”
“I thought you lost to me, Joe. I have wronged you, and it will take a lifetime for me to make it up to you. You are brave, a hero from what others sing.”
Dean glanced up, tears in his jade green eyes. “I don’t know what to say Cas.” He whispered, words failing him.
“When all our jobs here are complete, we ladies are going shopping,” Mertha told the group. “we need flower girls.”
There was dialogue inserted in the wood: it was Aramaic, the language of Jesus. They were armchairs, some high back, others leather, all overstuffed. A fireplace sat in the middle, with large candles arranged around it.
Dean watched as they called his friends up on stage, the angels’ mates looking on with proud smiles. He clapped and cheered but felt a sense of sorrow that he would lose his best friends. His mood took a steady downward spiral, and he could not shake the melancholy he felt.
“Dean, I have to collect blood from you,” Dean responded, and he turned his head aside when Pam got to work. “Sharp scratch baby, that’s it relax. You’re doing great Dean well done.”
Dean could tell his words had hit their intended target. Castiel’s shoulders sagged like he had given up. “Fine, Dean, I can’t put up with your childish tantrums.”
“Aim it away from the second cave opening; that’s what it's protecting.”  hollered Sandy, who had remained very stoic until now.
Castiel edged closer. “No, sweetheart, he did not kill you. But he will take so much more away if you do this. Stand down, my good boy, my darling mate. You’re my everything, Dean. I can’t lose you. Please don’t let Uriel’s sacrifice be for nothing.”
Castiel's garrison hunt for Dean and find him. Castiel finds and helps Dean, with his demon problem.
Dean just glowered at the four creatures kept his back to the wall, trying to keep his breathing calm.
Beth pulled a pad and ink out. “Choose which finger; then we imprint your fingerprint onto the ring. Your partner will have a part of you to carry with them always.”
“I can’t believe my brothers and sisters became so corrupt and could not understand what was going on.”
Warnings: Underage drinking and reckless behaviour. Reference and acknowledgement to self-harm. Language. Abusive behaviour toward others. Angel powers are used.
Charlie and Anna got Dean the Harry Potter book collection. Adam and Michael had got him a selection of Marvel comic books and a Tatty teddy bear. Dean stroked the bear reverently. He may be seventeen today, but he never had a furry friend before.
Castiel was not sure if Dean was pleased, or saddened about his dad. Emotions were still not natural for the angel to understand.“I-I smote him; he’s gone.” Castiel suddenly had an armful of omega, trembling in his arms.
“No, unavailable, so they informed me. Guess I will have to become used to that,” Dean tries to limit the sting from his statement, but he knows he fails when the two women glance at each other with sorrow in their eyes.
They arrived on Bobby’s doorstep. Castiel said they could not simply appear in someone’s home it was rude, even if they knew them. So Castiel knocked on the door.
I just want to thank those that have been on this incredible journey with me. I have had so much support and love it's been magical. Thank you sincerely, I will always keep your kind words inside when the dark ones come to bite.
Dean started sneaking out, doing odd jobs around the neighbourhood. He also found a different location to stash clothes in case something happened with Adam. Dean also thought about getting a bag and buying items for his travels, but not yet had time.
“Dean, I just want to say I’m sorry for yesterday,” Charlie tells her best friend. Dean pulls her in for a hug.
“Daft angel. We have to chat about everything that’s happened. Why did I go into heat Anna? I have never heard that happening before?”
“Deans a bright one, that’s for sure. I’m not positive how you will track him, Cassie, without his bracelet.”
“I agree, keep close guys,” Joe spoke in seriousness, observing every shadow in case it jumped out at them.
Later, they stood in a corner by themselves. “Dean, can I say, how amazing you look today? You shine like the star you truly are.”
Dean felt bruised from the force of the push, but he stood and touched Castiel’s arm. “Baby, we need to know. I demand to know. Please stand down. He won’t hurt me. I have you to protect me, right?”
Dean nodded and put the blade into his jeans. Dean knew it could not kill him, but it would hurt a hell of a lot, he was positive of it.
A groan passed the lips of his lover. Dean squinted harder, grasping the remote so he could turn it up.
Castiel knew where Dean was. Could find him hidden among the twinkling stars themselves. No, Castiel had committed his smell, unique only to Dean. The angel sniffed and followed his nose: figs from the garden of Eden, and the powerful aroma of earl grey. There was something gentler in his mate’s depths, violets and jasmine, cinnamon and vanilla. It reminded him of summers learning to fly in the meadows of the earth.
“No, he’s going back into therapy. I told him I would get someone to be a HAG. I can see him drowning if he’s left alone.”
“You need more fluids. Normally we won’t let any up into the dorms, but with you, we will. Water only through.”
Pulling off Deans boxers, he hisses when his cock jumps, grazing his stomach. Castiel shimmies out of the confines of his shorts.
“Dean takes after his mom. Sweet, kind, fearless and brave. He would not leave someone to die by themselves, even though he realised it would hurt him. I’m glad he gets none of your DNA, truly.”
The after-party was fun, laughter, food and avoidance. Dean had to stand by Castiel’s side, but he stayed away from him. He watched how enchanted Anna was with Charlie and how tender Michael became with Adam.
“Oh, angel, I love you too, so very much. I know I’m young, but you complete me. I’m not scared when you’re near. I feel a thousand feet tall like I can fight for my dreams.”
.’ Castiel whispered through the angel radio. Dean dug his angel blade out for safe measure; the battle was imminent. The angels surged upon the foul hell beasts. Dean saw others near the entrance they had just arrived. The omega pulled some team members back and fought the humans before they could get at his garrison.
Dean stared at the God. There it was, talking in riddles. His skin still felt tight. Something was coming, and he felt sure it would not be flowers and rainbows.
“No, this is not real. Love.” spittle ran down her face, “Love can’t beat me, love is nothing. It’s a chemical reaction.”
Meanwhile, Castiel had scrambled towards Dean, hugging him securely. Like he had not seen him for months. He quenched his thirst like a man lost in the desert.
Michael dropped them off a mile down the dirt path that leads to Cain’s house. Stating it was a beautiful day, so they should stretch their legs. Dean had spent little time with his brother-in-law since he finds the angel easy going and that he has a fondness for cars. That’s why he learnt to drive. They talk about new and old vehicles. Dean found him admiring the older angel a lot more.
“What the fuck? What’s going on?” the man appeared to panic now, his face going white with abject fear.
“Lord, Dean, I’m sorry. I realised I was doing this all wrong. Shit, I thought if I were the top dog then Michael would notice me. And the only time I got his attention…”
Dean smiled at his friend; he knew what the archangel was alluding to; every mate had to pass tasks and advance the levels. He had never figured out why, but it kept the angels happy, so he went with that.
Dean opened his eyes and jumped deeply into his mates’ fathomless blue eyes. “I don’t want you to be mad at me, Cas. Just my mind always seems to go there and…”
Saturday came frostily. Dean glimpsed out of the window at seven o’clock that morning. Making patterns with his breath on the screen window, he wished he could leave for a run. Trusted angels were a little thin on the ground, and he knew with certainty that Castiel would not let him out of his sight.
The next day, after a hearty breakfast of eggs, bacon and hash browns, Missouri dropped Dean off at the bus stop.
“Dean, are you okay? Did you fall?” Came the smooth voice of Cam. The angel held his hand out and helped the omega up.
Castiel switched back to English. “Now if you’re all finished there is something, we would like to show you, Dean. Charlie and I realised we had to make up for yesterday and she came up with a magnificent idea.”
Anna hugged her mate, and sent her on her way, then ran down the corridor and at the human entrance flew to the lobby.
The boy’s turned when there was a clearing of throats. Mertha, Castiel and Michael were standing there. Eyes blazing, arms crossed, looking pissed at them.
“Here you go, son.” Paul placed a generous mug of hot chocolate and a plate of chocolate cookies next to him.
Dean glanced over at the God, searching out a question he desired to ask. Still crippled with low self-esteem and self-doubt.
“I know Gabe; I understand why Chuck needed to keep me away from him now. If we were the angel and human they talk of, that would help stabilise earth; he would test us, make certain we were strong enough to weather any storm.”
Charlie groaned and closed her eyes. “That’s Camael he’s a cherubim, Dean. You know, one below Castiel’s rank. Anna informed me. I can’t give too much away.”
The boys wandered into the bank, and Dean received a shock. Sitting down on a chrome chair, he glanced again at his passbook. He handed it to his friend.
They were standing in the common area. Anna was speaking to Mertha and had her mate’s bags by her side.
Dean stood near Flynn, Harry, Kate, Joe, Charlie, and Sandy. The omegas he knew from the agency. The only Nephilim he could sense was himself. The others predominantly were angels and a few humans. Dean rolled his eyes, and Charlie giggled.
“I know this must frighten you Charlie, but I had hoped Dean, may have mentioned something last night that would help,” Castiel asked kindly, not wanting to startle the poor omega.
There came a steady beeping noise that disturbed his slumber. Groaning, Dean searched around and realised it was the alarm clock. The numbers were stating it was precisely seven in the morning. Slapping the alarm, he slipped back under the covers. The alarm rang out repeatedly, moaning he got up and whacked it with his hand. Jumping out of his warm cocoon, yawning. Walking to the bathroom to pee and then deciding on a shower.
They walked another corridor, this time a dark blue carpet covered the floor, and the corridor washed in a baby blue. Hannah knocked on the door at the end of the passageway and waited.
Dean is shown what some of his power he have accomplished in the world. Castiel and Charlie get into a fight and Deans not happy with them. They soon put it right, but the angels have a surprise up there sleeves for the three omegas.
Dean went out and raked up fallen leaves. The guttering was hanging off, and the boy knew he had to fix that, or he would have issues later on if the weather turned worse. Getting a ramshackle ladder, Dean ascended. In one hand, he had a bucket to clean any blockage; he wanted to see if he could fix it. Dean worked around the household, cleaning the muck out.
“No Cas don’t you even. I swear you’ve become worse since you’ve been spending time with Lucifer.” Dean huffed and marched out of the room tramping loudly up the stairs.
Castiel nodded at his brother in reassurance. Dean’s golden eyes glinted with playfulness, and he grabbed hold of Castiel’s hand and pulled him along.
“Aww, Deanie, did I hit a nerve? You know I’m right.” laughed mirror Dean chillingly. “Why don’t you do us all a favour and put yourself out of your misery.”
“I have bequeathed that message to Gabriel.” The angel grinned smugly and went about making waffles.
It puzzled Dean, he never mentioned his name. Shrugging his shoulders, it lulled him to sleep, the rumble of the car soothing him.
“Angels live together they aren’t solitary creatures. We thrive on family, community. I have assigned Anna a new task back in the agency, and so has Charlie.” Castiel told the eager mates.
“So, child, you want to play with those dicks with wings or come and play with the big boys? We can bring your mommy back, you know. They can’t.”
Castiel handed Dean his handkerchief out of his breast pocket and took hold of Dean’s quivering hand. The angel sent warmth, comfort and joy in droves down their shared link.
On Saturday Michael handed the boy’s money for a movie, the arcade and dinner. Dean took his bank book and went to check money in the account. Before they went in, Adam handed his friend a white envelope.
“No, there are clues, but we have no idea. Castiel was the only fledgeling that qualified these standards. He was a quiet little thing, always had his head stuck in a book.” Mertha smiled fondly. “Angels are born will all means of different coloured wings, but Castiel his was black at midnight. They shimmered like a rainbow, you could depict, greens, purples, and reds, but predominantly they were black, and he had six wings.”
“Not your fault Cas it’s his, you; should have a normal mate, not a big mess like me.” Dean spat out, meaning every word he spoke, his heart heavy with grief.
Charlie came through the doors and when she saw her mate, the commander and the doctor, it shocked her. “Am, am I in trouble?” the redhead shook.
“I need to sort my garrison out, please monitor things while I’m gone, Gabriel.” Castiel looked at his older brother, and Gabriel nodded in understanding. Castiel walked away and went towards his office.
Dean searched for Castiel’s hand and they both sort comfort from each other. Dean forgot that not only had he lost his mom. The angels had lost a sister.
They could discover no defined body, but the creature’s long appendages. The slithering creature tried to grab on to their arms and legs, trying to render them immobile. The angels were struggling in vain to hack them off. The monster was here and there, and it corralled them into the centre of the cave.
“Okay,” the redhead pulls Dean to an adjacent table and grabs water and makes her new friend drink it.
“Come on, let’s leave before the big bad comes,” Adam told his friend, wanting to protect his family the best he could.
“I have one more year here. You will have the entire floor to yourself.” sighed the boy like he wished he had that.
Castiel swallowed hard, but the car stopped, and the chauffeur opened the door. Cameras clicked and flashed, and he placed on a fake smile on his face. Dean stood beside him, looking so lost he felt distressed for the boy. Twining their fingers together, he turned his mate around.
“I’m here about John.” Crowley’s eyes flicked over to Castiel’s briefly and then back to the omega. A slight nod of the angel’s head and the demon carried on. “I have the information.”
Castiel takes Dean to there nest and worries what he will think about it. Dean gets upset when Castiel as the talk with him about the rules he has to adhere to.
“Adam, talk to him. This has gone on far too long. He can’t keep treating you like this. I know you made mistakes, but it was partially because of how he was acting.” Dean told his friend.
Dean went to bed; it took him time to fall asleep. Making certain he had Castiel’s feathers under his pillow. He finally succumbed to the fatigue of the day.
Dean grinned, he knew his baby brother would be an alpha. Full of protective concern, even at a tender young age. “I promise Sammy, and anyway we need to catch up. I don’t know the laws about family and the nest, not learnt that yet.”
There was a large dining area just off the kitchen with a table running down the centre. A sideboard with tableware and light blue dinner service sat inside. There were cups and cake plates decorated with a bee pattern on them, with little cake forks with cartoon bumblebees on the handles.
Dean walked along the blackened tunnel. He could see by the bright, green light on the rock face. The walls dabbled with orange slime. The constant drip of water in the background was like an out of tune melody.
Cries of astonishment went up, and Castiel turned his gaze to the rocky roof. Heavy mist covered most of the bats, but the ones on the lower levels were crashing into each other. They slashed, bit and maimed, their kin. The swarm got faster and faster, flashes of red flared from their dripping eye sockets. Like a mini funnel cloud, the bats flew so fast to the naked eye no one could make out a discerning shape.
That night Kate and Flynn and a few others brought bedding down to the common area. Mertha had hugged Dean and made sure they had all got snacks. Kevin had set up a television and as many DVDs as they wanted. Dean grew tired, but he had to play this out. When midnight struck, Dean brought the water and vodka out. Only he would be drinking. They played spin the bottle and have you ever. Dean winked at Katie, and as she got up, the others knew that she was going to call her angel.
The creature rolled his eyes and clapped its hands, turning gradually into its pure form. It was a wispy white shape, with its hot red coal near its heart. It pulsed, and its light became brighter.
Castiel sorts John out, making sure he knows, he knows his power. John as a plan but it does not pan out. Gabriel looks after his family.
Mertha laughed. “I will bring the plastic plates and cutlery out then. Think how to push him, Dean, this may not be enough.”
“Uncle Bobby, where did you get the one you gave me from?” asked Dean his green eyes grew wide with fear.
Dean tiptoed towards the stone and placed his hand firmly upon it. His angel and Mallory had a stare-off, so he did what felt right. Suddenly, he was transported to a faraway destination.
“I can offer you a ride, Dean, but I’m going to visit my girl.” the skinny man laughs at the prospect.
“Your uncle’s fine, Dean, he will recover.” Castiel moved the man to the couch and placed a blanket over him. Castiel put hands on his mate and healed him.
Dean audibly gasped, wings answering his mate’s call. He was feeling different. The omega turned and heard Castiel cry out in astonishment.
“Dean, you’re an intelligent boy, you know what will happen if you harm that man. He’s half-demon, half-human. You kill him, you pay the price.” Gabriel told his friend.
Dean finally gets sorted with lessons. Meeting Charlie, he happens upon some new kids and gets help from Adam.
The angel strode over to the omega pile and stroked Deans hair. “It’s over now; you can all come out.”
“Hey, guys.” Adam bounded over to his friends. “Happy birthday, Dean.” Adam shoved a brightly wrapped present under Deans’ nose.
Crowley grinned, looking like a predator ready to pounce on its prey. “Nothing, love. Though I can’t take you to Bobby’s,”
Mallory pulled Castiel to a sitting position, her back to the north wall. “Shame, your cute, what pretty eyes you have.” The Fate took an angel blade from around her brown belt. “Say goodbye to your love, Castiel.” she giggled in childish glee.
Dean feels low but gets a surprise visit. Castiel goes to Gabriel for help and they both get bad news.
“Nice try,” growled Castiel. The angel aimed his trusty sword with his grace into the glowing coal, the heart of the creature.
Castiel smiled that gummy grin that Dean loved. The one that made his nose wrinkle. He slipped his small hand into the angel’s larger one and squeezed it tight.
“Commander, we are losing,” exclaimed Eremiel blood was dripping down his eye. Suddenly a bat crawled along the leader’s shoulder and bit into his neck. Yelling in pain, he dropped to the floor and shook.
Dean scratched his head and studied the stone; it was only half visible. The smaller handprint clearly on display. Looking down again, he wondered if this was a lock that operated the stone, and if it was, how could they open it? The circle that represented the Earth locked into place. But how did that happen? Dean groaned this was giving him a headache.
Uriel smiled for the last time, his hand falling limp by his side. Dean closed his eyes, and he could still see the bright glow from the angel. Sobbing into the angel’s head, he felt the burn, but he did not let go. The sounds of wings, soft winds blew on his cheeks. The soulful songs of angels calling to their lost brother. The sensation stopped, and Dean blinked water out of his eyes.
Dean continues to his first lesson and met with Enochian tests. Not saying a word, he diligently spends the next hour working through them. When class is out, he retires for a laydown, his head thumping with overuse? Falling asleep and missing lunch, entirely.
“This way to the food hall, you can choose what you want unless your angel or doctor says otherwise,” Charlie confided to Dean.
Chuck glanced at the boy intensely, trying to convey the important message he was trying to deliver. God hoped that one day Dean would believe in himself as they did in him.
“Charlie offered me the box so we can chat freely. Michael’s staying close to the agency. He’s accepted work here so; we don’t live far.” Adam drew a crumpled scrap of paper out of his pocket. “This is the address if you require it.”
“Deans missing. We’ve only just noticed because of the feast.” Gabriel announced, ashamed of himself. “I let you down Cassie I never watched him.”
“The spare room was a compromise of sorts. You can still have your room here at the agency if you wish until you come of age. So, leave a change of clothes. I want you near me.”
Pam took Dean down for x-rays. His rib’s cracked, his arm a former fracture that had not repaired. She took pictures of his bruises, scars and burns and pictures of his self-harm injuries.
Castiel marched up to them with certainty and authority in his every stride. The angel had his hand on his trusty sword, poised to strike.
Michael and Adam were not there, wanting to have their first feast as a mated pair. The same went for Anna and Charlie. Gabriel sat with his mate Amy at the top of one table and asked everyone to unwind.
Castiel smirked, his lips thinned, his long fingers gracefully holding John tight. Bringing him slowly down, placing his other hand over Johns’ head. Castiel’s halos sang out, the music so loud it rocked the cave walls, his feet planted firmly on the ground. Castiel could see and hear Johns screams, the monster’s ears bled. The wrath of an angel smiting and by Chuck this thing he held in his holy hands was evil, he felt it in every core of his body.
Dean went for a shower after a morning full of weapons training and school work. The warm water soothed his aching muscles, and he felt a lot better. Getting dressed in a tee-shirt, sweats and a hoodie, the omega went for a stroll in the gardens. It was cooler now winter had established in his world. The trees had surrendered most of their foliage. Their skeletal fingers reached up to the pale blue winter’s sky. Dean was positive the concealed panel was not obvious and inhaled with a sigh of relief when he could not spot it.
Castiel and Eremiel led the assault; they had over six hundred angels at their back. The rest stayed topside to guard the countryside around and the gate itself. They ended up in an immense cavern, stalactites clung to the rocks, and they glowed a faint blue, lighting the dull cave in an eerie glow. Few stalagmites rose from the ground they were short but easy to catch one’s feet on.
Dean puts his arms up, and Castiel takes the tee-shirt off and throws it to the floor. His wings bend somewhat, to skim his lover’s skin — miles of tan, blemishes, and muscles that are turning hard. His boy will grow further in the years to come, and he can’t wait.
“Angel, please, I need you,” Dean begs again, needing his mate, requiring this bond to click into place.
Charlie suddenly jumped up and did a tiny dance. “I have it. Castiel told us many times that omegas were not treated great down here well it’s the same on Earth. Its only in Heaven was the story is different.”
It shocked Castiel that this five-foot-nothing omega was challenging him. Holding hands palms up trying to appease her.
Anna, Mertha, and Gabriel ran toward Castiel. “No, we had no clue he had harmed himself. It should not have happened this way,” shouted Anna, who was sobbing into Gabriel’s shoulder.
Grabbing his fellow omega’s hands, Dean giggled in glee, knowing in an instant what to do. They ran through the corridors, rejuvenated by the light. Castiel took a controlled breath, though he did not need to breathe, the beauty of his mate astounded him.
Sensing she would get nothing else out of the omega, she nodded, “Let me heal you first before you leave.”
Crowley had been to visit. The higher up demons that sought out souls had gone into hiding, not wanting to be a part of the war. Zad and a few other crossroads demons helped the angels plan their attacks. The best places to enter Hell and a few magical ingredients they would need. Crowley knew a white witch that would help them, and she made hex bags. It would help the angels and omegas with hell-bound creatures.
Castiel’s palms felt sticky; he had memorised most of the tunnels, so knew which direction they should head. They arrived at a fork where the tunnels split, and they paused. Dean looked back at him with bashful contemplation on his slightly dirty face.
Castiel’s lips twitched as he half turned towards Dean. “All names have a meaning. Dean is an old English name; it means valley. Mallery means unfortunate or Ill-fated.”
Dean could see John held something in his hands. Was that holy oil? Yes, when lit an angel could not get out of the fire, but it could still burn an angel in liquid form.
“I would like to see you try angel.” John chuckled, not at all anxious that the angel was now glowing with blue, white grace. The humans behind him took one look at each other and ran. The angels behind Castiel swept past, giving chase.
Running into the long-forgotten coal mines, the angels passed into the thin portal that separated Hell from Earth. The angels could not fly into the entrance because it would disintegrate their wings. The temperature changed, and the rush of evil would render them ineffective.
“They are, but ranks are respected, and they have their place. With an archangel, I would regard them differently to lower ranks, not inadequately, but with that level of respect, they deserve. They are different procedures to greet them.”
Dean doubled up, and his belly laughs, rumbled over him. Castiel’s eyes sparkled in the distant light, loving the unbridled elation running through his young mate’s body. So, he joined in with him.
Dean gets bulled but Cam comes to the rescue. Dean finds out who really sent the angel to look out for him.
Dean says goodbye to his friends. School work becomes harder and he finds an interesting book in the library. Castiel goes to his big brother for help.
Everyone clapped and cheered. Well, the bully’s looked affronted. But many people loved Dean in his year at the agency.
Dean pointed his ring finger, and Beth promised to call him when it was ready. Hopefully, before graduation. They met with Castiel, who was a little flustered because they were slightly late.
“Let me out, you won’t win. I have my Dean. I am not alone.” The angel shouted, the sword slicing through layers of material. Suddenly all went dark, and a flash of light lit up a cave system. There stood at the bottom of the cave was his Dean. Castiel’s arms had grown heavy, tired even. Putting his sword away, he ran to his mate.
“Excellent, we have flight clearance so hold tight to me, and we can get out of here,” Dean held onto his angel, and that feeling of weightlessness ascended on him, and they arrived at the nest. Dean looked around and spotted the other two cabins nearby. Glad that his family would be close, but not on top of them.
“Dean, you were a baby, you did the best you could. We angels don’t punish children struggling to feed their baby brothers.” Hannah told the boy.
Castiel rolled his eyes at the over-enthusiasm of his brother. Lucifer chuckled and went with the bouncy archangel.
“Right from the start, you told him you did not want a human mate. Dean was so confused. If you did not want him, why did you not walk away?”
Dean nodded, fighting back the tears. “Thank you, sister, but can you please call Castiel? I desire him like the air that I breathe.”
“Yes, exactly, and they must tip back, that’s how the universe works. Good and bad must balance no one should be more than then another. The Fates ignored omegas; they loathed them, thought them weak. We are the birthmothers, creatures of all life. That is why angels adored us and kept us safe, worship us.”
With Charlie and Adam had gone for the weekend, Dean was lonesome, so he sneaked out. The bullies were throwing food in the canteen, and Mertha was giving them a telling off. Getting outside was easy, and he continued to his spot and changed. He was just a sixteen-year-old boy doing odd jobs for pocket money, after all. The weather was turning cooler, and winter would speedily be there.
“I need to cook, and everyone has to keep their lips buttoned. Operation get Dean bonded is in progress.”
Then he spotted his angel, his unruly black hair a mess. His breastplate was azure, and his tunic was bronze. The angel had gold stars on his shoulder to denote his high rank. He had black leather pants and brown ankle boots. His six black wings, shining from his back, flickering and flexing, and his three halos shone brilliantly. Dean looked down and saw the bee socks, and Castiel winked at him. Dean showed his Marvel socks, and he got a grin from the angel.
“You did not answer my question. What do you want with me?” Dean asked again, irritation showing in his voice.
Dean was over at the nest for the weekend. Castiel had pampered his mate, and Dean felt loved and special. The angel had some work to accomplish in his office, so Dean wondered about the house. He flicked the television on and caught the world news station. Dean had not understood until that moment in time what his mate had meant. That his powers had delivered a shock wave through the world’s omega population. They were standing tall, standing up for themselves. No longer choosing to be oppressed fighting for discrimination in the world.
“You did. But I believe in my mate, I believe in my friends they would not abandon me.” Dean told the shadows firmly.
“Did you not know of Mary and the Campbell line?” Castiel queried, puzzled at his dad’s lack of knowledge.
“Oh, yeah. I’m ravenous, and everybody keeps putting stuff into my hands.” Dean grinned back at the tan face in front of him.
“Well, that must have been some phone call. I agree Castiel has no clue. I like you, Dean.” Charlie holds out a hand. Dean shakes it. “Friends.”
Castiel was for the better word pissed. That filth in the basement had sought an audience with his Dean. No way was he going to grant that. Yes, he had told Dean about it, in all goodness he could keep nothing from that boy. The look of panic and dread that crossed his face said it all.
Castiel not wanting to miss any of this vista flew to be near his mate, the Star bond connecting instantly. The angel gripped tightly to Dean and grinned, bringing them close together, kissing the cherry lips of his young mate. Castiel called for his brother and sisters, and Dean shot up higher, to the Heavens and sang to the stars. The sky became half-day and night, not like an eclipse this was different. The actual sun and moon stood side by side in the sky, blinking down at the Earth below. People ran out of their houses, running on to the streets, cars stopped, looking skywards.
“My lips are sealed.” Joe checked his watch. “It’s just gone eight, breakfast time. Then we better get dressed.”
Castiel kissed the back of his neck, caressing the skin there. “I have been a warrior, fought wars, seeking the truth. I had no time to locate a mate. I was not interested in what humans called dating. Sweetheart, this is new to me. Let’s work on this together, whatever seems natural.”
Dean made certain he seated the furthest away from Chuck. Castiel sat next to him on the couch. Pressed so tightly, Dean felt slightly smothered.
“That’s not my rule it’s the schools, made over two hundred years ago. Also, you need to keep that point quiet that I can scent you.”
“Castiel’s my wings, and I’m his protector? I can’t understand why. How can I protect a warrior angel? I can’t do anything for him.” Dean shrugs and hides his face in shame.
“You smell better.” laughed Charlie. “Let’s show them I can perform miracles.” she winked and grabbed her friend’s hand. Although she worried about Dean, the omega knew some of this was to do with Castiel.
Dean stared at the blue-eyed angel. No reprimand, no telling him to stick to the schedule, no asking him if he was okay. Can I go now, sir?” Dean asked, knowing this angel did not want him. What was the point in following any orders? No one cared about him, and no one ever would.
Castiel held on tightly to Dean’s hands and searched into those mesmerising green eyes. “Good things happen, Dean Winchester. I promise you. Remember when I told you to open your eyes, sweet boy, its time.”
Dean came back with a tray of sodas and a plate of cookies. "I just put the kettle on for Cas, he said he would be home shortly.”
Dean giggled, loving that he had made his mate feel better. Hoping his friends and family would not tease Castiel too much.
over again — their mates handing them bottles of water to lubricate their parched throats. Marcus took a long pull of water and sang again while Isaac took in the cooling liquid.
“Or we have an older brother that’s a badass Archangel. That happens to live in the very place you plant the get out of jail free card.” Grins Dean in glee that they can beat the Fates they need to get to the stone.
“Would not miss it for the world. About time this boy got some happiness. Now let me go check on dinner.”
The demons vanish in a puff of black smoke, and Gabriel sighed in relief. John had gone through the lingering echo of his actions will haunt them for years to come.
Castiel spotted Lucifer hanging back. “Brother, come and meet Dean. Dean, this is Lucifer, my big brother.”
Dean gets a surprise after meeting not one but two demons that night. He walks along the highway and finds shelter but does not notice the gift he was left.
“I have been helping Lucifer’s garrison to the topside, he’s hurt Commander his wing, but he’s okay.”
Castiel knocked the metal chair aside like it was not magically reinforced to the ground and hammered in with silver nails. His strength was so magnificently powerful. “I told you if you touched Dean again, there would be consequences.”
“I hope so too, man.” Dean waved goodbye as Jimmy turned off. Looking through the envelope to identify how much money he had left — a little over one a hundred dollars. That will get him a bed for the night in reasonable accommodation and food. He needed a scarf and gloves and maybe a book, so he continued to the store and got what he needed. Finding a nice-family run motel, he got into a warm shower, and flopped onto the bed and promptly fell asleep.
“Slightly nervous. What if I move wrong?” Dean worries his lip between his teeth, but Castiel stops him.
The man watched as Dean went inside, and his eyes flashed blue as he mended the gutterings with one thought. Fixing the ladder and putting it away in the shed. Keeping the boy safe was not against any rules after all.
“Castiel, you stumbled into my life like a shadow, hovering just out of reach. I thought you did not want me, just like everybody else in my life. Then you vanished, yet you never truly did. You were there watching out for me, making certain I was safe, cared for, loved. You gave me a family, and for the longest time, I did not realise that. I thought I was alone, but I never actually was. You held my hand and guided me. When I left the agency, you never let harm occur, not once letting me fall. I have grown to love your company, your extensive knowledge and your guidance and your family. I love your nest you’ve created for us and kindness you show me. Ever patient and thoughtful, letting me stumble, and being my safety net.”
There was no mention of the angel. Charlie kept giving Adam strange glances, so Dean knew there was something wrong. How could he trust them if they were hiding stuff from him? He listened to them talk and let it wash over him, trying to come up with some explanation for their strange behaviour.
Dean loved the space it was not too big or unduly small, and unlike Adam did not need luxury. Adam talked about his room as being large, but this was acceptable for him. The commander if he controlled the place had excellent taste.
“The rooms change up here, not sure what will become of it. Gabriel mated with a girl, and so did Raphael. And the top rooms over in their dorms are no longer in use. We will be the last two. How old are you anyway?” Adam asked Dean, wanting to get all the information from the boy.
Gabriel put his arm around his baby brother, not liking this at all. Wanting to squash anyone who had hurt him so badly. “Talk to me, Cassie.”
Jody had heard enough. “John Winchester, I am arresting you for the abuse of your son Dean Arron Winchester and the abuse of Samuel Henry Winchester.” she acknowledged her two men standing by the door. They placed John Winchester in cuffs and led him away.
Dean knew the threat was an empty one, and he wished the angels a pleasant evening. Dean could not wait to get up to his room and look at the ring. Opening the door, he pulled the velvet box from its red home. The little box opened with a creek and Dean stared at it with awe.
“Yes, it is. I told Dean, and he will tell Sam. The boys don’t need to worry about having parts of you in them. That’s why you hated Dean so much; he acted like an omega, so your little brain assumed he would not have your DNA. It does not work like that. Dean is strong, stronger than any alpha, even I fear him.”
“Yes, you’re correct, let’s get going.” Castiel nodded his head in agreement. Castiel winked at Dean and straighten himself out, getting back into his commander mindset.
“Thanks, man.” Dean plastered a fake smile on his face and got off the bus. His heart was beating fast. Walking to the toilets, he did his business and walked out. The omega noticed the bus driver was still watching him.
Dean rubbed his eyes as tiredness swallowed his head. He yawned and closed the book, putting it under his hoodie. There was something familiar about this text; he had no clue why. Trusting no one, he sneaked upstairs and went to his room.
Dean glanced over at the clock on the mantelpiece and realised that Chuck had made time to stand still. It was early morning, and they had a day and night together.
“We’re very sorry, I had no idea you knew our language; that was remiss of me,” Hael said babbling, looking at the youngster’s badge and then the computer screen and her eyes becoming large. “Your Castiel’s mate?”
Anna clapped her hands. “We wanted to talk. I know Charlie’s been sad, not been herself. Since we moved elsewhere.”
Mallory picked up along twine of string from her bag, and pulled it, leering at the mated pair by the wall. Her long silvery hair hung loosely, kissing her shoulders. The creature’s powder-white face, stark with her black lips, and diamond silver eyes. She wore an ankle-length black dress with a thick brown belt around her waist with the infinity symbol entwined into it. Dean became mesmerised at how her eyes sparkled and caught the light in the bright room.
“Well, your man will cherish this. Those types always do. Long as your both happy, that’s all that matters.”
“Yeah, it is, but what if…I end up like my dad? What if I’m a dreadful person and all this crap was for nothing?”
Tables lined up and music blared into the common area. They had placed green and red decorations around the room. There was even a blue spruce at the end of the tables that had gleaming white lights upon it. They scattered gifts underneath, from mates and to their angels. Dean knew for certain his angel would not have sent one and had not bothered to get Castiel one. Well, that was a lie. He had brought his angel a gift, and it was sitting on his bed where it would remain.
They ascended the stairs, and Castiel opened the door with a flick of his wrist. They entered a hall of pine; it made the place have a lighter touch to it, more so than the outside. There was room for boots, coats, which led to a laundry area washroom and sink.
Gabriel turned his nose up with utter disgust. “Sami put this idiot back into his cage. Revoke Dean and Castiels rights down here,”
Dean grew angry he needed to get out of this building. Had they cut off all routes? He could hear the elevator rumbling up the shaft. They were coming for him, going to hurt him.
Leaning on his angel, humming softly under his breath, not to disturb his mate’s musings. Dean closed his eyes feeling it more than hearing it at first. Hairs on the back of his arms raised and a sudden chill ran through his body making him shiver. Castiel suddenly went stiff next to him, though he ignored this at first.
The angel nods and snags a grey scanner from a rack near them and picks Dean’s pass up. The scanner beeps, but the angel frowns and sighs. Dean thinks this is an odd concept for an angel to do.
Mertha watched Dean leave and sighed, having faith in her two-favourite people. And the trouble tomorrow would create.
Castiel must have realised that his mate was asking a genuine question and meant nothing by it. “You can ask me, anything love.”
“There is no mention of him, that’s odd. Uriel refused to take a mate. No idea where he went. They dumped Joel and Raziel in the human world. After Hael paid them and finished their task of hurting Dean.”
“Sorry to disturb you, Castiel, but Deans test results came back. We need him in the infirmary for some healing sessions. His blood levels are not satisfactory.”
“It’s commander to you, show me respect. I don’t want to hear nor see you today, Dean, got it? I discover you have not completed your tasks it will be so much worse.”
“I agree with Dean, the commander and the archangels, want us to land there,” Charlie told the group.
The door flew open, and Gabriel stepped in. “Brother set him down he’s not worth it. Dean needs you; he’s been calling.”
Uriel reached out and stroked the boy’s face. “One day, when it’s your time. Come to see me and tell me your news.”
Dean went into the hotel. The lobby was bright and adequately maintained. Going up to the receptionist, who eyed him with caution. The woman seemed stern, with her silvery hair and gold-rimmed glasses. She wore a cream blouse and a black skirt.
Marcus and Isaac glanced at each other, nodding in silent agreement. The brothers ran behind the commander, pushing their long blond hair out of their wintery blue eyes. Their mates followed in their wake, giving them a reassuring presence of support. Passing through the portal, they could already hear the screech from the bats and the yell of angels in battle.
Jody Mills did not get called to the Angel Agency very often, but when she did, she knew it was going to be atrocious. She stared at Dean’s x-rays, not requiring a medical degree to see broken bones and bones that had not healed.
“I think your right red. It will only become worse. I will piss Castiel when he encounters the state; I left the nest. Also, Cam was there when he finds that we had a food fight. We will have one particularly angry alpha angel on our hands.”
“Castiel can’t see you, so I’m passing on the message. Level three of the angel tests is about stepping away from a situation. Even though you could have employed force yesterday, you refrained.”
“Listen to me both of you, there the enemy they will pot all the others against me. You don’t have to stick by me, but they will try to divide us, put me in the corner and then strike. I can’t go to Castiel, he won’t care. They will count on that. I think Uriel’s got something to do with this and those demons I found in the alleyway.” Dean told his friends.
Dean opened his eyes and grinned; he materialised his wings. Looking into the mirror and stepping up to it.
Dean stood no longer fearing the beast who had now retreated to the back of the cave, turning he shuffled forward and fell. Dean felt like he was floating and arms grabbed for him. Someone was screaming his name, but that to just brought silence. The darkness suffocated him, and he lost consciousness.
“It petrified me, on my first day. I don’t know him well, but we had become friends. I had no clue about his past but sensed they had harmed Dean.” Castiel nodded, and Charlie sighed. “I know one thing, people underestimate Dean, he’s got brains, and if I know him, he will head right for the front door. Look in trash bins or plant pots for his lanyard.”
Sometime later they started walking again and followed Castiel’s lead; he knew most of the tunnels and paths. Had the maps memorised in his photographic angelic brain? The two omegas grew tired, and Castiel knew he would have to make camp soon.
Chuck grinned and nodded his head. “Your uncle has always had a great perception of our kind and how our universe works. He knows you’re special, but not sure in what way. Bobby made sure you could exorcise a demon, fight and speak Enochian. All tools will be a great asset to you in the last days of your journey.”
“Well, Dean, it’s nice to meet you.” beamed Jimmy, who was fiddling with the radio. “Let’s put some music on.”
“Cas where you cleaning the nest the entire time? Anna said you had gone into hiding, would speak to no one.”
Dean knew that book might be rubbish, but his mate had given it to him. That meant something to the older boy. With everything that had been going on, Adam must have felt kinda lonely. He knew what that felt like.
“Buddy, Uriel was unhappy down here, he’s in a place where he will be content now. His sacrifice will not go unnoticed. He would want you to carry on with your life.” Gabriel told his friend.
Castiel stayed until he could no longer spot his mate. Thankful that he could make up for some loss of his childhood and bringing joy for a fleeting moment to his troubled world.
“You underestimate my brother, Kevin. Cassie could kick my ass. The only archangel that could cause him any harm would be Lucifer.”
They both stood at the foot of the bed. Castiel sunk further into moody green eyes. Castiel reverently traced Deans jawline with the pads of his fingers, visibly making Dean, shiver.
“Close friends and family only. Charlie, Adam, Bobby, and Sam are family. They can’t come into the second floor, but everywhere else is okay. There is a stairwell that will take them past our room.”
Dean feels irritated after all that’s happened. They talk about that little snitch, Adam. Castiel’s not asked once about him. So, Dean tells them everything. Though he’s not even bothered about his disobedience.
“I’m not positive you understand who I am.” Castiel, eyebrows rose “But please make my day, do something because I would love to come up with a plan to kill you so gradually you will discover how it felt when you hurt your son.”
Dean got up and shakes the angel’s hand and leaves. The omega goes to his room and works on his body, building up his endurance. Meeting Charlie and Adam for lunch, telling his friends about his day.
Commander its Charlie, Dean rang me. I had a hit. He was just outside the agency. I guess where he and Adam met. Maybe he got comfort in the location? Dean claimed he had seen his dad. Castiel, he’s terrified. Dean told me he loved me, and he was born wrong. I think he’s in self-destruct mode. I’m going to urge Anna if she can bring me over; maybe I can help?”
“Give me your phone. There are codes I want to give you the angels can’t crack them.” Kevin fiddles with the phone. “The app installed can decode your lanyard; you can reprogram your timetable, food, just about anything. Don’t get caught.”
Dean got his best black jeans out and pulled a white tee-shirt over his head. Over that he put a green button-down on. Dean wore his leather bracelet and his star pendant. Castiel had changed into jeans and a white dress shirt and a blue jumper.
“You’re a wicked boy, Dean Winchester.” Mertha had a feeling the Dean would get his wish. Would give everything to make the omegas world a happy one.
Michael opened the box. A light flickered, flourishing brighter. Oranges, whites, pinks, purples, reaching for the Heavens. A host of butterflies twisted up into a spiral up to the ceiling, their wings creating a whooshing noise. They disappeared and then appeared two white turtle doves. The birds flew around the circle, over the heads of the watching people. The flames of the candles jumped high, and there were gasps of surprise from the crowd. The birds flew up to the Heavens and vanished. Michael then closed the box.
“I get my best friends back. I have a family. I don’t get happiness. This is just too good to be true.” Dean stammers, not believing any of this.
“Thank you, family, for joining today, to enter the celebration of the spirit of our fallen brother Uriel. We all make mistakes in life, and we can only endeavour to rectify them. Some have no plan to do, so, others sacrifice themselves for others. We are all, perfectly flawed, examples of our father’s work. Yes, even angels. It’s what we achieve in life that matters, what we, say, how we conduct ourselves. Your life, no matter how harsh, or how magnificent, shapes you, it does not define you. You can turn to greed, lust, vengeance, just a few examples. Or merely learn kindness, charity, love and forgiveness. These concepts are monumental you must be pure of heart and rise above all evil. So, let us now send our brother Uriel to his resting place, into the Heavens.”
“That’s easy, Dean. Angels are extremely protective of their fledgelings. If John had a nefarious reason for wanting to harm you or use you, she would have killed him.” Crowley told the omega.
Pam looked over at the young boy laying on the bed. “He’s special alright, Hannah. I will get the test done right away. I will carry out the full works. That will take longer you need to take that off his price.”
Mertha put their trays away, and Dean got up. Castiel gave Dean a quizzical expression. “I’m just popping to the bathroom.”
Charlie ran up the stairs and saw Dean was lying on his front head buried in his large fluffy pillows. At the sound of her entrance, he lifted his head, red puffy eyes, and cheeks stained with tears.
Dean closed his mind to the digs and brutal words. The omega remembered what his Cas said to him. When there is dark, look for the light. Dean bought up the memory of their bonding day, the smell of the flowers, his angel’s face, and the warmth he felt so cherished and loved. He had friends, family, people that appreciated him; he tried to rush towards that feeling. Sammy and Uncle Bobby were there waiting for him; he still had that familiar connection.
“Your clothes will be in your closet in a bag. Don’t worry, Dean. We have to have breakfast at eight, then back up to change, don’t be late.” Charlie scolded, poking a finger into his side.
Meeting Charlie in the games room, they play until midnight, and they go up to bed. Adam is not about, but Dean goes by himself, knowing war had broken out.
The archangel went through to the passageway where Jace’s desk was. “Hello, sister, you busy today?” Gabriel sat on the edge of her desk and unwrapped a sucker and popped it into his mouth.
Castiel scoops Dean up and takes him back to their nest. The angel got Dean undressed and tucked him up in bed. Castiel watches over him like he knows he should have done all along.
“Yeah, look at that kid over there?” nudging Dean to study the boy with a glower on his face, he had vivid red hair and an even brighter red face. “Tries it every time.” the redhead said, shaking her head. “Ty’s prohibited from all things sweet like desserts, pastries, and candy, but he tries, and his angel will punish him for doing it repeatedly.”
Castiel’s tongue now fucking his hole, the angel lapping it up like it’s the best buffet he’s ever tasted. Castiel drops Deans legs and rubs a finger in the wet heat of his pulsing hole. Then a second, making sure he’s stretched.
“I think it would be best if we split up and met in the middle. Now I know about all this that plan has merit. Dean and I can communicate they have no clue about our abilities. I have the plans set out, so we won’t get lost. I will go through these maps with you brother you know Hell better than anyone.”
“Adams fine Dean. Hurry up and eat. Castiel tells me you’ve had no time to see your car. I will give you driving lessons. I have nothing else to work on today, and Castiel wants you to rest.”
“Cas, why did you get jealous? I only have eyes for you.” Dean stroked his fingers over the angel’s jawline.
“Brother, I brought Dean’s bracelet,” called Anna, her brilliant red hair bouncing on her shoulders as she sprinted towards Castiel.
“Darn it. Let me speak to Mickey over angel radio. Kevin, I met my mate over three hundred years ago. In the days, we did not have security as we do now. The elders are all targets. They took Amy from me, so now we put bracelets on our mates so we could track them. They classed Castiel as an elder when he became the commander of Gods own army. Has the same rights as an archangel, so they gave Dean the bracelet.”
“Dean, can you explain why they called me here? Hugging another omega without their angels’ permission, you would learn that on your first day here. Or are you too stupid to take that in?” Castiel growled, his eyes were flashing red.
Dean’s feeling much stronger in himself. The omega had not realised how fatigued he was and how his skin itched before the angels healed him.
Castiel pulled away, his grace slowly retreating, his eyes simmering down, the red leaking out and returning to the cool blue of the sky. Upon looking at his mark, raised and red, but like most marks that had a meaning to the mated couple Deans was unique like himself. A new star was born today, a spiralling constellation, one with meaning. Castiel traced the star that showed wings and a sword, the angel and his protector.
“Let’s ask Mertha, she will know.” Charlie pulls him along to the front of a window near the kitchen. A tall woman with grey hair, looking slightly frazzled, spots the two humans, and she smiles.
“Oh, I told Batman about you. I was anxious about your safety. I honestly did not think he would listen. He sent Cam, to monitor you. I doubt you will have any further issues with the bullies.”
Dean turned, and his breath hitched. Charlie was sporting a wine-coloured floor-length dress. Her cloak was navy blue with constellations dotted around in silver. Nestled in her flaming hair was a headdress of Camellia, Daffodils and Violets.
“I would say he has about an hour until he needs help. So, you either get his permission to bond or take him to Anna’s and Charlies. They will tend to him. Then I will be back; we need to talk Castiel.” the God vanished, and it was dark once more. Castiel had not noticed how light it had become with his dad nearby.
Dean moves to the nest. They go and see Sam and Bobby and Dean finds out some interesting information about omegas.
“I require your assistance, Dean. Castiel can’t feel you. I work for dad, God, we can call him Chuck.” the older angel laughed. “Pick a seat, Dean.”
“Yes, join us, and we can offer you the world. One kiss will be all it takes.” the demons looked at each other and chortled.
Mallory stalked closer, tapping her black fingernails onto the table. Castiel narrowed his grace fuelled azure eyes and met her in a head-on challenge. Dean saw Joe and Adam skirt around the edge of the room, but the Fate took no notice of them.
“I know brother, but I truly did not want to drag anyone else into my mess.” the angel cried, hiding his face in his hands.
“I don’t like little pricks.” he snorted and stared at his mate who stood with his arms folded, raising that eyebrow. He knew meant he was going to be in trouble any moment now.
“That will anger Castiel. Yes, Harry, but we both need to report to Tula. We don’t want Dean to be in any danger. Dean, we need Cam in the picture, you took him into the nest today?”
Paul continued to serve a couple that had just come into the room. Newly mated from the way they could not stop touching each other, Dean thought.
“I saw a text to say she had arrived, but that’s all. I assume she’s gone into heat, only explanation.”
Castiel glowed, his eyes dark blue with grace, Dean edged to the open door. They petrified him. Once out of the room he, ran. When he was in the hall, he recognised the way to the lobby. Making sure Hannah or Pam was not around to spot him. Dean slipped in with other families milling near the exit. Slipping his lanyard into a garbage bin, he raced out. The family went left, and he continued right.
Hazel eyes stared at Dean with such anguish the older boy’s heart broke, “Dee. I’m sorry if I said or did anything to hurt you.”
They all stopped fighting and sunk to their knees. The beast slithered over them, its suckers making popping noises, but made no further attempt to harm them.
“We have taken ion for his punishment, along with Hael and Jace. I thought you worked alongside them brother?”
“We can talk about this angel, come to some agreement?” John begged for mercy but found none in the angel’s blue eyes.
Castiel’s internal monologue went around in his head. Wondering what was important and what he needed to fix it.
Castiel opened his mouth and closed it, his cheeks going crimson.“You passed the first task, say nothing to Adam. Please take care of yourself this time around.”
That night Dean clung to Castiel like a limpet. Told him repeatedly that he loved him, that he was his everything. Hoping the angel would remember the words in the harsh light of the new day.
Castiel turned to tell his brother he was fine when the stone lit up, and a bright blue light engulfed him. The angel found himself in a small room, alone with just his thoughts for company.
“Dad asked me to watch you when you were just a fledgeling. He mentioned you were special. Cassie, you were like no baby angel I knew. Into books, had an appetite for knowledge, like no other. But you’re a badass when you want to be.”
“They will wonder why the cameras are not working. We will meet in here at different times. I will send a note to you both. You have your phones?” Charlie asked the boys.
The truck rumbled beneath him. The man had a craving. Knowing it was time to dissipate the bloodlust before it became overwhelming. From the top of the hill, he could see down to the bottom. The solitary figure was trudging along the side of the road — a younger person from the look of it. A grin lurked on to his gruesome face; his hands tightened on the wheel. He could pick up this person and no one would report them missing. Well, they could, but by then it would be far too late, and he would be miles away. Thinking about all the ways he could have them, how he could pull screams out of them and watch the light vanish from their eyes. Palming at his erection, laughing at the simple joy their death and destruction would bring him, he pressed the gas pedal down heavier.
Chairs got pushed away and a dance floor set down on the lush green grass. The music lifted the occasion by the angels who played several instruments. Their first dance was ‘
Bobby stepped out of the room and came back, handing Dean a silver blade. He had seen nothing like it before’. To the touch, it was blunt, but it hummed. He could hear it calling to him. Like it was otherworldly.
A shout went up, and everybody stood to attention. Dean heard Castiel’s voice thunder out. “We have a green light; all troops raise arms. May the light always be with you?”
“You are sorry. Unlike John, who cares nothing for the consequences of his actions. I think you wiped the slate clear tonight.” Dean pronounced hunching over, trying to ward off the rain from the angel.
Gabriel saw the boys depart, making certain they were both safe. He received the message from his big brother, Gabriel started his search for the truth, and he knew he had one angel inside the agency, he could turn to for help.
Castiel moved Dean closer to the sidewall away from the door in case she tried anything. There were ten angels in all stood in the room. The Fate lifted her hands, and they all shot through the door, and iron bars slid in place.
Dean heard whispers about how he was disrespectful towards his mate. He could feel eyes on him constantly. He needed to get out of there so ran off towards the elevator.
Dean held tighter to the angel and wiped the water off his face, the rain coming faster, the storm not abating.
“Goodbye Lucifer, see you soon.” Dean waved, Castiel gave him a peck on the lips, and the angels were gone.
“What does that mean?” frowned Dean, studying this beautiful angel before him. The blue eyes and black bed hair, leather jacket and a glance of a tattoo showing under the angel’s collar.
“I love my brother and my uncle, but I have loved no one like I do my angel. You’re asking me to break my world apart.” tears slip out of Dean’s eyes, not holding back because this was breaking his heart. “he will never forgive me.”
“We’re keeping her here, so when you want you can take her for a spin. After you get your licence, we can teach you. My friend Cain will look after baby for you.” Castiel announced to his mate.
Dean knew in an instant that this was what he had been missing all his life. Home was in the arms of his angel.
“The treaty says you cannot take an angel’s property. Crowley will slaughter you.” the demon vanishes and the others snicker.
Dean stands with his arms at his side, his stance wide, poised like a coiled spring ready to strike at any moment. Charlie, Adam, and Joe stand behind him, much like the other angels that followed.
Dean chuckled and kissed his mate’s burning cheeks. “Hey, babe, don’t sweat it. I guess the lakes got bigger now, which is excellent. They wanted to create that but worried about the beauty of the area. You carried out a remarkable job. I mean, you even increased the trees.”
The other demons try to assault him, but the angels have grabbed them. Castiel walks up to Dean and tries to communicate with him.
Dean held a glass of orange juice in one hand and a plate of food in another. How on earth was he meant to eat and drink and balance all this?
Dean followed the angel until they came to the elevators, and they parted ways. The omega had a second shower and changed into his pyjamas and read until he was sleepy. Not bothering with anything to eat.
Dean sat at the agency working through weapons. The human agency had changed into a training ground. All angels were becoming ready to engage in the forthcoming war. The omegas were helping their mates. Everyone’s knowledge put to excellent use, from plans of Hell to the Fates to various weapons.
“I can, Aggie. This way Dean.” Paul was tall with flaming red hair that reminded him of his best friend. Dean followed the man into the common area, hoping he would be with his family soon.
“Yes, sir.” Anak closed his eyes, and in moments Galgalliel and Ophaniel arrived swiftly, holding their mates between their arms.
Their main aim was to neutralise the demons, this way they could not spill on earth and start attacking the humans. They needed to make sure they were safe. The fight for heaven and earth would begin, and the people they needed to save could block their efforts.
Chuck smiles tenderly at the young Nephilim. “Not everything about protection is about weapons. The sword could be symbolic, Dean. Castiel can’t give you his wings, now can he?” Chuck raised an eyebrow, and it struck Dean with deep thoughts that hurt his head.
“As long as the family is there for the ride, we will be okay. I know it will be hard. I have to have patience, understanding and love him.”
Dean responded, and his small wings vanished. Castiel gathered his omega in his arms and flew back to the top. A man was waiting for them. He was around five feet six inches with curly brown hair and bread. He wore a white dress shirt and a navy-blue jacket with brown leather elbow patches. He had on blue jeans and brown loafers.
“I never thanked you for looking out for me.” Castiel squeezed Gabriel’s hand. “You taught me so much, brother. I would not be what I am without you.”
Castiel raises an eyebrow, still holding on to his weapon, his angel blade never far from his mind. “What do you want from me and my mate?” Castiel asks again, not playing her game.
Dean and Zeta garrison are stuck in Hell fighting a beast. Castiel and his garrison, face an uphill battle from demon bats.
Castiel rolled his eyes at his brother’s antics. “Come, love lets mingle and then get you some food.”
“I’m angry with you, so please be quiet. If I have a problem, I will tell you. I will come to you. You tell me I should share my feelings, yet you do the complete opposite.”
