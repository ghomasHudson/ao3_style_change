Though he can feel himself blushing fiercely when the blankets are pulled back to reveal his bare body, Castiel doesn’t bat an eye. Dean supposes that having one mate, possibly another (at least another attempt, anyway), and caring for a pup would all combine to make someone damn near immune to being embarrassed by naked flesh. Dean, however, is still mortified.
John has never been an overly protective father, but Dean never really thought that when push came to shove John would ever land on someone else’s side.
Time passes, or it doesn’t. Dean can’t be sure.
Mr. W is singing, his voice low and whiskey-rough.
They’re more than a little late to Calculus.
a bit of a wild child, Dean.” Before Dean can even open his mouth again, John goes on. “Now, they haven’t
you out so he could keep his job!”
“Sam is a bright young man,” Castiel replies. “He deserves it.”
“Be back in a few,” Dean murmurs. He takes another kiss, then two, then leaves with Colonel trailing behind him dutifully.
They step out into the night. It’s quiet and cool, a blessing. A gentle wind takes the scent of dead vampires away and replaces it with the scent of grass, cars, humans, and darkness.
He feels Dean press his face into Cas’ leg and whimper, so he flips his book page side down and turns all of his attention to Dean.
“You didn’t,” Cas is saying while Dean is thinking about maybe kissing him senseless. “Adam is an adult, he’s not your responsibility. We can put him up in a motel for the night, if you like, and send him on his way.”
Castiel realizes that he’s grinning fiercely. “Charlie, you are truly remarkable. Indescribable. A miracle.”
“Thank you,” Cas says softly, finally.
The only vampires who drink blood, for example, are from the Ruby Court, and the elders of that Court know how dangerous they are, so they are extremely few. Any request to make a Ruby youngling is heavily regulated and must be approved by all elders of the Court, which happens very rarely. Only one new Ruby has been created by law since Castiel himself was reborn, and Meg is still angry that she wasn’t allowed to die on her own terms. Any other Ruby vampires made any more recently than in the last century are unregulated, being hunted down by their own kind as well as human hunters.
Dean’s eyebrows go up in surprise. Sam usually tries to ignore the family business like he thinks if he doesn’t acknowledge it, it doesn’t exist. Dean’s always thought it was kind of a naive strategy, but he respects Sam’s wishes.
There, he sees Jack sprawled across the counter, still sitting on the stool behind the register as if he was seeing to a customer. The blood trickling from his temple, framed by a rapidly darkening bruise, is vibrant, terrible proof to the contrary.
but he’ll need to eventually. And, more importantly, he left the job that had Cas walking into his office for the first time to discuss the future of HLSC.
While he’s standing there, lost in his own thoughts, certainly not helping himself or the boy, the door to his left opens and a short woman with dark skin wearing lavender scrubs walks out holding a clipboard. She doesn’t quite startle when she sees Castiel standing there, but she comes close, and she noticeably relaxes when she sees the badge on his chest that declares him a visiting doctor. She comes easily when he motions her over and holds his hand out for her to shake.
“I wanted to say thank you for the advice,” she says, fast and breathy.
It’s easy to miss. But Mr. N cares.
This is about sending a message.
Cas’ head tilts back, needlessly defiant and clearly a bit embarrassed, himself. “I could help you shave, if you like. I don’t have a hand mirror, but I have a razor, and I could help you shave.”
Cas’ eyes sweep across the house, and his eyebrows climb to his forehead steadily. That shocked blue gaze takes in the tidied kitchen living room, and dining area, takes in the neatened piles of laundry, Claire’s dolls and their dresses (all handmade) put away, and the swept fireplace. Cas’ eyes finally land back on Dean and Claire, sitting at the table with a third plate next to Claire, complete with Cas’ own sandwich.
Dean blinks, now also showing some confusion. “Because you don’t want me to go?”
Cas heaves a happy sigh and cuddles closer while opening the bag. “You’re a godsend.”
“You’re a guest.”
“Shh, shh, you’re all right. Hush, now. You’re all right.”
“I chose a new name from the books he kept about angels, the name you call me now. Gabriel kept his, because he was, as he put it, ‘already an archangel, how much better could it possibly get?’”
and she looks in the mirror every day, thankyouverymuch.
“I just… You’re so busy, always working while I sit here and watch the days go by. I feel guilty, Cas, sitting here like a useless jackass-uh, sorry, useless lump. Is there something I can do to help you?”
“Just for the house, is all,” he says, fooling no one.
Except for Anna.
Dean draws up every ounce of will he’s ever had in his
Benny coughs lightly behind him. “I think she means right now, brother.”
- Hi. Sorry about the wait, y'all.
When Mary asks Castiel to call her by her first name, John knows that his wife approves of their son’s boyfriend. Which is nice, because John does, too.
Dean, however…
Castiel himself was only allowed to invite one guest. There was no contest.
Cas goes about the same routine the next day. Dean struggles.
Dean thinks faintly. The words slice into him neatly, deeply. Dean worked
“Dean, you’re
has Cas been perfectly gracious and lovely, he quite handily saved my life when I rode up. I’ve grown quite fond of him and his pup, and I don’t think I like what you’re implying...
Dean’s face is slack with surprise, his eyes nearly glowing with a dozen emotions Cas struggles to put a name to.
The corner of Mr. N’s mouth goes up at Anna. “Thank you, Anna,” he says.
When met with her wide-eyed stares, she just shrugged. “What? Like I wouldn’t investigate the dude bangin’ my bestie?”
Instead of his usual work shirt and breeches, Cas is wearing a
they wouldn’t like him marrying Cas, and now he’s paying for it. The only real job he’s ever worked, the only thing he’s ever done with his life, the only thing he’s ever even
“Whatever the reason for it, my resolve broke. I said ‘yes.’
Lucifer shrugs, waving a hand dismissively. “Nah, I get it. What were you gonna say, ‘A bunch of vamps wanna meet with your vamp boss? Put us down for four-o’clock?’” He chuckles. “This was probably better. Come on! Sit, sit. It’s been so long since I had talked to another vampire, how long are you guys staying?”
He doesn’t need to look over to see the bitch face Sam is making to know that he’s making one.
And so Dean and Cas became Dean-n-Cas, a whole unit, rarely apart. Dean became a fixture at the diner, Cas became a fixture at the end of the bar. They bought clothes and dishes together, Cas researched better quality dog food for The Colonel, and Dean discovered that Cas can’t cook worth a damn.
“... Hey, you mine, Cas?”
Cas feels like he’s going to throw up. “Oh… Okay.”
“May I begin by congratulating the graduating class? Guys, we did it!”
A pin could drop in the ensuing silence and Dean could hear it from across the room.
on one another, and when Mary died, she took a big part of John with her.
Dean wipes the sweat from his forehead. “I reckon you’re right,” he says slowly, “but I was hoping to start pulling my weight around here.” He brightens as if it’s just occurring to him. “Maybe you can help me!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, is he…”
This is a risk. Dean has been laidback about Cas being controlling, but there’s a chance this may be too much. Cas can’t stand by idly, however, and watch Dean throw away his chance to graduate, to further his education.
“That’s… Kind of a lot to take in, Cas.”
Dean’s answering smile is almost painful in its brilliance. “You and me, Cas. All the way.”
be getting longer after this one.
Castiel smiles wickedly and adds a second finger when he thrusts again into Dean. He watches hungrily as his lover cries out and arches into the stretch. Castiel leans down to press a kiss to the dimples just above Dean’s ass. “So beautiful.”
Dean’s surprise brings another almost-smile to Castiel’s face, and he manages to open his eyes now. He can’t read the expression on Dean’s face, but he curses himself for keeping them closed for so long. If this is to be the last time he’s able to openly study this beautiful boy’s features, then by God, he should be trying to soak in every moment.
Cas thinks, a bit beyond the ability to actually be surprised.
He thinks about Cas, about what Dean assumes he’s been through. About the kind of person someone would have to become to make it, to be able to raise a daughter and keep a roof over their heads.
Sure enough, the other alpha is growling and shouting and turning his horse to follow Sam. Dean snarls, but the pain in his leg is starting to make him dizzy and he’s only in the saddle by the grace of the gods and Impala’s blessed intelligence. There’s no way he has the coordination to pull his gun out to get the mark to go after him instead. He’ll have to trust in Sam to keep himself alive and unharmed.
Castiel smiles.
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, Dean is taking advantage of the opportunity to turn Castiel into a sweaty, strung out, needy wreck.
“I did my best to wear her out quite thoroughly. She’s asleep.”
and prepare any animals that were snared. Only then does Cas come inside for the night, and Dean still barely sees him. He can hear him, speaking to Claire or humming in low, rumbling tones, but Cas is presumably working on whatever sewing he has from town. He works long after he sends Claire to bed, and is often only just putting everything away when Dean himself finally drifts to sleep.
He gets to Anna’s desk and stops. She looks up with a fading smile on her face. Her fingers are poised over the keyboard. Dean notices that her nails are painted a royal blue. He likes it.
“I couldn’t
Hysteria bubbles up in Cas’ throat and he has to force it down, down. His mind somehow feels like it’s both moving at a million miles a minute and like it’s stalled completely, unable to accept any more input.
Cas’ eyes were wide and delighted. He was frozen. “Yes?” he asked, excited and breathy.
what he looks like.
He feels a twinge of guilt, he does. He reasons that this will benefit Castiel, too, in the long run. And it’s not like it’s for forever, or like it’s
The relaxed humor on Dean’s face, along with the easy way he stands in the shop and effortlessly includes Jack in their lunch plans, makes Dean radiant, enthralling. Cas’ poor heart has never beat for someone like it beats for Dean.
“Dean,” Claire says between hiccups of laughter, “that’s silly! Alphas don’t really belong in the kitchen.”
He’s helping Cas sort through last week’s donations, a practiced hand now at eyeballing what’s what quickly and efficiently, when he tells Cas as much.
Castiel doesn’t have the luxury of time dulling the memory of his turning. Of his mother, a woman he had once loved, screaming in Russian as she hit him over and over, the way the ground felt beneath his bare knees, the sound his ribs made as they cracked in his chest. The soft, distressed cries from Anna as his sister called out to his mother to try to stop her.
Dean shrugged. “Cas wanted a club, so Cas got a club.”
A gentle but surprisingly calloused hand on his arm pulls him out of his spinning thoughts once again. He looks up from where he was sweeping and into Donna’s warm, concerned brown eyes.
“To get married.”
smell rather delightful.
Dean’s eyebrows go up. “Yeah? Who?”
Dean’s lovely green eyes shine with emotion for just a beat before he gives Cas that cocky grin that he hates/loves/craves.
Despite his internal reassurances, the wet-dog scent of upset alpha would still be hard to miss when Castiel comes back in. He frowns and tilts his head, squinting at Dean like he’s trying to puzzle him out.
nice tailored suit in a deep navy blue that makes Dean glad he wears suits to work himself, because he would feel shabby in comparison. He’s well-spoken and smart, and he put together a presentation that’s easy to follow. He’s said things like “gosh” and “my word,” which are ridiculous, but which seem to fit in his lush mouth perfectly.
A silence that he can only interpret as tense drapes over them until Cas reaches over and frees one of Dean’s hands before folding his fingers in with his own.
“So you’ve… What, you’ve got someone lined up for me?”
“Hello, pup,” he rasps, smiling. She doesn’t make a sound, so he tries again. “My name is Dean. What’s yours, darlin’?”
Castiel, I was
“Boss?”
He ends up on a lower level of the asylum, below ground level, certainly. He’s moving slowly, following the agony that brought him here. He feels twitchy, restless. His inner monster doesn’t like being caged underground this way, but as a man, he’s horrified that
Dean tries to push the fact that he’s naked with this
Plus, Dean’s the boss. He does what he wants.
Without saying a word, Dean lets his head fall to one side. He’s panting as he does so, and his fangs are visible in his enticingly open mouth.
Cas tilts his head. “Are you all right, Dean?”
“I spoke with your… ‘Charlie,’” Anna is saying. “She helped to scramble the security footage before any human authorities were alerted. She is… Very strange.”
He follows Gabe at a much more leisurely pace. Gabe has never put much stock in trying to be subtle - he does not keep up with current fashion trends, he does not try to keep his slang up to date, and he does not, in general, try to be quiet. He begins to regale Castiel with a very loud story about his time in the Philippines in the nineteen-twenties with no regard for if they’ll be overheard. He’s wearing honest to God
Cas’ face is worryingly blank. “You…” He looks at Dean. “You know you-”
“What if…” Dean swallows hard. “What if he says no? Or he bails after getting to know us? Know
real, as does the strange, manic gleam in his eyes as he takes Cas in.
The first and, obviously, most important difference is the warm, firm body snuggled up to his side. Cas is all long legs and pale, warm skin tangled up and pressed against Dean, sleeping soundly with his head on Dean's shoulder. Dean's arm is numb from being curled around Cas and keeping him close.
“How are you feeling?”
That’s how Cas finds them. Claire is sitting across from Dean, laughing at the funny faces he’s making at her. They both turn to look at the omega when he comes in. He stops in the doorway and stares at them, blinking rapidly but not saying a word for almost a full minute.
Balthazar and Gabriel are out of sight. They’re sneaking in through the back to cut off any attempt of escape or, hopefully, ambush. Castiel also would rather die than let Naomi be in the same room as Gabriel again, but that’s a thought he keeps to himself as they get to the door.
Dean’s hands grip his hips and he starts a fast, hard pace, jolting Cas with each thrust and hitting his prostate head on every second or third thrust. Since they’re alone, Cas makes no attempt to smother his cries, and it seems to drive Dean mad.
Dean’s expression is no less predatory, but it does soften a bit. “Not tonight, Cas. You just lay there, baby, let me do all the work.”
He flips the movie to an old episode of Star Trek, smiling when Dean perks up a little. Colonel hops on the other side of the couch to rest his head on Cas’ shins.
Kevin transitions smoothly into the next song, the crowd keeps dancing, and Dean keeps watching.
Bela lays a perfectly manicured hand on Dean’s arm to laugh flirtatiously up at him. Even worse when Dean smirks down at her, though Castiel knows the dick only does it to rile him up.
The man looks Dean up and down, much like he had Impala, and doesn’t smile. “Hmm.”
and they are not, by any means, forced to subsist on the emotions that feed their kind.
She just… She
Dean blinks, dark thoughts stalled as he stares at her. “I-is he, now?” he splutters.
Lucifer nods. “Yes. I’ll help however I can.”
Cas hums as he marks something down on his list. “That makes sense, if you think about it. There’s something soothing about the endlessness of retail, about knowing that you’re probably going to be doing something close to identical as you did the day before.” He looks up and smiles at Dean. “You can work for me forever, you know.”
He wakes when he feels Cas straddle him. It’s still very dark outside and he’s still on his back where he flopped down when he came to bed, so not much time could have gone by. His mind is still foggy and slow-moving, so while he knows he’s hard, there is no urgency to his arousal.
Most importantly, Naomi takes care of her own and has taught her children to do the same.
Just like every other high school, however, it runs on cliques and factions among the teenagers teeming in its halls. They’re not so obvious to
John hadn’t given him any breaks within the company, so Dean at least feels that he’s earned his current executive position. Even if he suspects that he looks just as uncomfortable in a suit as John himself always has.
It can’t be for sex. Dean says shower sex is unnecessarily complex. So…
Charlie, quite true to form, ignores him. “Did he say the big ‘L’ word yet?”
Dean is not an idiot, nor is he blind. He is well aware of how pretty Castiel is, with his pale skin, slender frame, and bright blue eyes that have already shown such an array of emotion. Despite the marks on his neck, he still smells like healthy, fertile omega. He’s been pretty feisty so far, threatening Dean and keeping him in his place, but Dean’s always liked omegas with spirit.
“Where?”
The boy is smart, strong, confident, and obviously head over heels for Dean.
“Claire, bring me the bag of finished sewing, please.”
Saying yes to Cas’ wish to own a nightclub with him.
Adam swallows hard, then lifts his gaze to meet Cas’ and speaks.
Before he can speak, however, Lucifer answers.
Everything falls into place, then. The exhaustion, the trouble focusing, the increased caffeine intake.
On occasion, their shared shower gets a little handsy. But shower sex is complicated, and they’re both getting a little too old to ignore the king-sized bed in the other room.
Cas tilts his head in confusion. “Tended bar? Applied for employment? Attempted to secure an interview? Whichever applies most to what’s making you nervous at the moment.”
“Dean,” Cas growls. “I need you.”
Cas smiles. It feels wan, but it’s genuine all the same. “Yes, of course. Just… Thinking about tomorrow. Woolgathering about it, I suppose.”
Dean knows that there’s a possibility that all of this is just a result of being so tightly wound for so long, that the unspooling of tension from his spine is unlikely to be permanent, but somehow he doesn’t actually believe that. It occurs to him, as one, two weeks pass without noticeable disruption of their new day-to-day, that this is how his
He is not, however, laid-back about Cas.
Silence reigns for several moments while everyone absorbs Gabriel’s idea, until Sam speaks.
Uriel, for God’s sake, man, we’re
They’re loud and biting and itching. If Dean was able to, he’d swat every one he saw.
Charlie is also using her peripherals to watch Jo arrange the bar the way she likes for busy nights like they’re expecting tonight. Charlie and Jo have had a few good nights between them, flaring passion and solid friendship between the sheets. She’s not in love with the fiery blonde or anything, but she’s starting to wonder if Jo wants to get frisky after closing when the corner of her eye catches on something else.
Their group has taken over 3 of the booths in the back of the restaurant. Benny’s dad doesn’t mind, he says it keeps them out of trouble. Dean loves it here, at the center of the action with Cas, it makes him feel like a king.
He wanted a birthday party, of course, but this is all about networking. He wouldn’t have let Sam come near this party with a ten-foot pole, but some people Dean trusts almost as much have their eyes peeled. They’re building alliances tonight as well as gathering intel, making friends while simultaneously taking note of who’s misbehaving and how.
He nods. “I’m… Relieved, then, that she feels safe talking to you about such matters.”
You never realized our potential, James, the
are precious, and that he should do everything in his power to help and protect the ones he has.
“I don’t know what it was about that day, Dean, or that beating. Maybe it was the hunger, the thirst, the aching, the exhaustion, or any combination of all of those things. Maybe it was none of them. Maybe it’s because I was weak, because I was always weak and always will be. I don’t know.
“Is it your beard?” Cas asks, mercifully not drawing attention to Dean’s attempted deception.
This infuriating boy who has completely consumed Castiel’s thoughts just smiles, tugs Castiel close with an insolent arm around his waist, and murmurs, “Whatever you want, gorgeous.”
the room with alpha pheromones, with want, desire, and heat as he growls at the feelings swirling in his chest. Cas whimpers quite fetchingly and moves his hips in a way that Dean frankly thinks should be quite illegal, grinding himself against Dean. His scent, too, is thick with arousal and want. Dean wants to eat him alive.
“I know you weren’t going to steal from me, Dean,” he says finally. “Quite frankly, what would you even steal?”
“And I was kinda wondering…” Dean finally glances up to meet his eyes for a breath before looking back down. “What’s, uh. What’s the plan after that?”
not just college.
What he
After lunch at a cafe that Cas adores and Dean doesn’t hate, they divvy up dogs to take to the park. The Colonel always goes with them, and today it’s Golem and Phoenix who join him.
"Oh, Dean," Cas murmurs. He cards his fingers through Dean's hair as he shakes and pointedly doesn't mention that they'll both smell like ashtrays after this.
“Dean’s face is real itchy, Papa,” Claire says cheerfully from where she’s leaning against his side, trusting and too-warm.
“-won’t, of course, fix things, but over time, once you’ve gotten this taken care of, I really think-”
- (In case anyone was wondering, SIL and baby are doing very well! I've crocheted out some of my anxiety.)
sure?”
Dean hooks a hand around the back of Cas’ neck and tugs him close to kiss him hard. Cas comes alive, a wildcat in Dean’s arms, biting and scratching and desperate. Dean’s so hard he can feel precome making his boxers stick to the head of his cock.
Charlie’s eyebrows go up. “What? Where? Why?”
Cas moans. “Yes, anything, dearheart.”
Beneath the snarky armor, there’s relief in Cas’ eyes. Cas trusts Dean, somehow, to make him feel better, to make him relax and enjoy himself. Damn if it doesn’t go straight to Dean’s head and make him feel ten feet tall.
let anything happen to you, little one. He loves us too much.”
He keeps his own face impassive, though he can’t control the anger in his scent. Not at her, never at a pup, but at whoever made little Claire, with her cute braids and neat dress, know how to scent an alpha so young.
“Why didn’t you already have the market cornered on this?” Asa asked once, waving his hand around to indicate the atmosphere of his own bar.
Sammy and I, we’re…” Dean takes a deep breath. “We’re grifters, Cas.”
There are a few spots, Cas knows, that his boyfriend goes to hide and chain smoke when he’s upset, regardless of how Castiel feels about the smell. That eliminates any indoor hiding spot immediately. He goes to the bleachers to no avail. The small patio off of the band room, similarly, yields no results. The other side of the school, which for some reason doesn’t have nearly as many security cameras as the rest of the school, is empty.
“My shop,” Cas breathes, his panic receding as realization washes over him in cold waves. “You vandalized my shop.”
Dean just nods, reserving judgment.
“Cas,” he says, and the omega stiffens. Dean wishes he wasn’t so wary, so angry, even as he knows the reason for it.
which Cas would have killed him for anyway. The moment he raised a hand to Claire, though, he deserved much worse than what he got.
announces that Naomi has put her fork down.
Gabe scoffs. “Look, we’re all hard to kill, but I wouldn’t-”
- I gave myself cavities there at the end of this chapter, no lie.
“It was evident to me that this was different, more brutal. She still didn’t hit my face, didn’t dare scar that, but she beat every other part of me mercilessly. I know I was crying, but I don’t remember much else. The pain was… Huge, unimaginable. I don’t know how I stayed conscious.
Sheriff ketch holds his hands up as if in surrender. “Now, now, no need to get heated, I’m not implying anything. Just saying that alphas seem to have
(See the end of the chapter for
For the midday meal, he manages to put together simple sandwiches by slicing beef thinly (with a knife he makes a mental note to sharpen after they eat) and layering it with even thinner slices of cheese on thick-cut bread. Claire munches away on hers happily while he tries to catch his breath enough to eat.
Dean insists that Cas let him do the dishes, so he’s treated to the way Cas gets done with the day’s work even earlier than he has been and gets down on the ground to play with Claire.
Cas looks up at his entrance. His face is unreadable, but his eyes are unearthly in the low light of the lantern on the table. The omega’s hands have paused on the cloth they hold, and Dean has no idea what to make of Cas’ scent.
“I woke up in a dungeon, before which I was not aware we possessed. I was chained to one wall, Anna to the opposite. I was horrified, and the moment Naomi came down to us, I pleaded with her to release Anna, that I would do anything she asked if she would let my sister go.
The eyebrow doesn’t waver. “I’m sure you made every attempt to persuade her.”
Anna cocks an eyebrow at him when he grins at her. “Good morning, boss,” she says with a smile. “Good night, too, I assume?”
Dean hums. “Pick you up at seven-thirty?”

“He doesn’t have a job.”
“Well,” Balthazar says, “we don't really know any of that yet, I believe.”
just never been able to see it. Lucifer, however, the First, he will lead us into the light. He will lead us into ruling over humans, as is our birthright.”
“I’m not-”
“I… I panicked. As much as I loved Naomi, Anna and I were… Inseparable. I loved her more than I had ever loved anything. It was my d-duty to p-protect her.” Castiel lets his eyes fall closed and swallows hard. “That night, I took Anna and tried to flee. Naomi caught us easily.
“Hiya, squirt,” Dean says easily. “What’s up?”
Dean snorts a little, and though the sound is rude in the silence, Castiel agrees. Naomi can hardly be considered “young,” although, from the First’s perspective, he supposes they’re all just babies.
The moment is broken when Cas comes into the room. His back is ramrod straight and his blue eyes are spitting fire, but his words are gentle when he speaks.
“No, the only other thing is the fields on the other side of the house. You’re in no shape to do farmwork, though, and I daresay you’ve never done any such thing a day in your life, anyway.
Supper passes like a dream. The lantern light flickers perfectly, emphasizing how lovely Cas is and how much Claire looks like her omega father. Everything ends up tasting absolutely perfect. Claire is so well-behaved that Dean would think she was in on his plans if he was so inclined to share them with a five-year-old.
Ketch, too, snorts a bit.
Then he realized that Cas was nervous because he wanted this
"Sooner," Dean rasps. "Much sooner. Now. This weekend." He turns enough to whisper in Cas' ear. "We're eighteen now, gorgeous. We don't need 'em. Nobody but us, baby."
Also heavy in the air is the peaceful, clouded-over feeling of being medically sedated. After careful consideration, he discards that, too. While it’s certainly possible to feel pain under sedation, nothing has softened the blow of the pain he so clearly heard last night. No sedatives for this person.
Dean’s eyebrows shoot to his hairline, and his eyes go hard and flat. “Is that right?” he drawls.
The bass is loud enough to rattle his sternum pleasantly, but the music isn’t turned up so loud that his eardrums are suffering. Kevin knows what he’s doing and the dance floor is packed.
Castiel doesn’t hesitate. “Something came along and showed me a better way.”
The light in Uriel’s light is manic, unsettling.
She nods and holds it out silently. Mr. W takes it, winks, and makes his way back down the hall to the offices.
deal. Real estate is always a good bet, and with guaranteed tenants, it’s an even better one. He comforts himself with the knowledge that it’s sound business even as he knows he’s going to sign whatever the pretty man puts in front of him.
“I heard.” He smooths a hand down her hair, left flowing in the deference to the unusual day ahead of them. “I have to take care of a few things, but I’ll join you and your papa as soon as I can.”
Cas nods, relieved beyond belief that Dean is here, that Dean can take care of things. He leans against his husband’s strength and wonders idly how the hell he’s going to deal with the last fifteen minutes of his life.
Cas is quickly gathering up the brush, bowl, towel, and straight razor, but he manages to shoot Dean a tight smile. “You’re very welcome, Dean. Sleep well.”
Dean’s own eyes are steady, pleading. “What do I do here, Cas? What’s the right thing?”
Cas is covered in a fine, lovely sheen of sweat. His hair is fluffy and messy, as always, with strands sticking to his forehead and neck here and there. His eyes are huge and dark, staring up at Dean with just as much hungry gravity as Dean is looking down at him with.

“I’m glad,” Dean says fondly. “Now get outta here. You’re gonna be late, squirt.”
“I wouldn’t have told you, but I knew you were beginning to worry,” Mr. N says. “I would appreciate it if you kept this to yourself, Charlie, please. It’s very important to Dean.”
Still, though. “Cas, I can’t sleep in your
There’s a simple set of drawers in one corner, as well as a neat little vanity and mirror. No decoration adorns the walls, but Dean can see a handwoven rug on the floor from where he’s lying. He wonders if any personal touches were taken out of the room before a strange, injured, unconscious man came in.
real, at least to some extent. Whatever this thing is that’s taken up residence in Dean’s chest also lives in Cas now. Sure, they have things they have to talk about - their situation, how to come clean to their families, and what their longer term plans will be now that things have fundamentally changed, but they’ll be doing that

“I have perfect faith that you’ll be able to locate him.”
Claire nods solemnly, as if Dean is reacting exactly as she suspected he would. “Papa says so.”
With a jerk, Castiel is pulled from the nightmare loop he was trapped in. There is a weight pressing down on him, holding him in place. He bucks in vain to get it off until warm hands land on his bare shoulders and Dean comes into focus, hovering over him with worry written plainly on his face. Castiel immediately stills, though his chest is heaving.
to try to find him. The stories I’ve heard have documented his disdain for humans well. It would be disastrous, should he walk the earth now.
“Because I forgive you.”
Castiel nods slowly, trying to think through the frankly absurd circumstances he finds himself in. His brain feels like molasses, thick and slow. “And what would being ‘married’ entail, precisely?”
Cas lets his own fangs descend, still having more control over them than Dean has over his. He wastes little time, especially when Dean seals his mouth at Cas’ neck and bites down.
“No,” Cas murmurs, “No, I’m not hurt. He only… Oh,
Castiel is well aware of the effect Dean has on others, though. It’s not the first time someone has been taken in by Dean’s green eyes or his dazzling smile. Castiel isn’t truly worried, because, after all this time, he knows that Dean will never waver. The bond they have is profound, unshakable. It’s not the first time something like this has happened, and he is not worried. It’s not even the first time someone has questioned their compatibility.
Cas shudders and wraps a hand around the back of Dean’s neck, kissing him hard. Dean arches and moans. He gives as good as he gets and before Cas knows it, Dean is pulling them up the stairs, one hand in Cas’ hair and the other fisted in the front of his shirt. It’s easy to forget that Dean is as strong as he himself is now.
Dean was under the illusion that his cheeks could get no hotter or redder, but he was clearly mistaken.
Again, sleep is a long time coming
Mr. W sits forward. “What’s up, Charles?”
It’s the first time Castiel can ever remember avoiding Dean’s gaze. It’s more difficult than he anticipated. Looking into his lovely boyfriend’s eyes has become more a part of him than he realized, and he’s struggling to keep his eyes forward, even as Dean keeps shooting him pleading looks as he drives.
This time, he blatantly ignores Dean. “She became enraged, vicious in her anger. It was the second time she beat me so severely. I tried to… You must understand, I did everything I could to put up a fight, to restrain her, stop her, but I… There was nothing I could have done. She was a vampire, and I was a human. She beat me into unconsciousness.
She sniffs haughtily. “Damn right. But don’t thank me yet. I mean, if the entire group of lunatics you’re chasing can’t find him, I don’t know what makes you think we’ll be able to do it.”
Dean’s eyes are intent on his face, and his slow smile is predatory enough to make Castiel feel every inch prey as Dean leans closer to him.

a pup, Dean still wouldn’t feel right about waking up next to Cas only to run shortly after.
here, he wants their little pack to
He thinks about Claire, about her innocence, what she’s lost and what she’s kept of it. About her pretty blue eyes and her cute upturned nose.
Something runs through his hair. “You’re doing so well, dearheart,” the voice whispers. “I’m so proud of you.”
“Come in,” he calls.
Dean blinks. “Oh. Uh. To Cas?”
“I do not need your help today,” Cas says stiffly as he turns on his heel. “Please stay in the bedroom. I’ll bring supper when it’s ready.”
“I just…” The omega shakes his head. “As I said, we have paid for being too trusting before. I cannot let it happen again, no matter if I think you are who you say you are or not.”
trust you.”
Dean doesn’t bother mentioning that he was ordered to be here, not invited, and does as he’s told.
“I know you’re frustrated,” Dean says softly, “but we’re gonna figure this out, Cas, I promise.” Dean lays a gentle kiss on the back of Cas’ neck. “Let's get a few hours of shut-eye, then we’ll get back to it in the morning, okay?”
started with a dumb little idea I had one night while watching TV with my husband, and now here we are. I loved this fic so much, and this series. Thank you so much, all of you, for loving it right alongside me.
Dean can’t protest in the face of that, of an omega who’s protecting his pup.
Dean’s type. Just a shade too muscular to really be a twink, but still slender. He’s tanned, but it’s more likely the result of honest time in the sun than a tanning bed. His dark hair is combed neatly, but Dean is willing to bet money that it looks good untamed. He’s got bright blue eyes that are warm and wide, and of course, his
“Yeah, all right, point. But you’re stalling.”
“Well, I am the First,” Lucifer says, like it’s not an insane thing to say, “but I’m not leading anyone anywhere.”
“What’s this about, sir?” he asks as he settles into the quite frankly uncomfortable chair in front of the desk.
“Okay,” Cas says, forcefully pulling his head out of the clouds. “I’m meeting with Winchester Motors tomorrow. We’ve put together a proposal for a modest increase in rent, uncontested, for another twenty-five year, minimum contact contract. We will continue to provide our own maintenance and repairs, pay our own utilities, and uphold our own code of conduct. In return, they’ll keep up on any property taxes and receive the increased rental rate.” He looks up from his notes. “Am I missing anything?”
This is different.
“Outside, behind the bleachers.” Dean cocks an eyebrow and Cas sighs. “I was trying to do Professor Tran a favor.”
Even though it’s technically Benny’s job, Kevin has nowhere else to be, and they both know there would be hell to pay if Dean got here to find Cas by himself, Kevin and Benny both nod. As fierce as Dean is, Cas is a force to be reckoned with all on his own. No one argues with Cas.
- Fuckin' Zeke.
Dean doesn’t hesitate to go to Cas an immediately starts getting into his space. Cas melts back into him in a gratifying way. Dean nuzzles at his neck and wraps his arms around Cas’ waist, pressing his chest to his back.
“Indeed. After that night, after I recovered… Nothing changed but Anna and I. We were expected to keep up appearances and we did. We attended balls and the opera, got high marks on our studies, all while knowing we were under the same roof as a monster.
Jobs go bad, of course, and there’s nothing for it sometimes. The life of a grifter isn’t always an easy one, either, or safe. Not to
Cas nods woodenly and lets Dean lead him out of Naomi’s
you’re leaving once you’re healed up.”
It’s something Castiel has considered. “Perhaps.”
Castiel is a bit ashamed to admit that, while they’ve still been keeping an eye on any obvious movement from the Lightbringers, the urgency has faded in the last few years. With Dean graduating, Sam starting college, the move to California, turning Dean, and letting him adjust to vampirism, they’ve been… Busy.
“Ugh, gross. I thought we were another block down. Let’s go back, Cassie.”
Heaven’s Light Shopping Center just means so
“If you don’t mind, Cas, I’d be much obliged.”
“Castiel Novak. There aren’t any details beyond that.”
Castiel hasn’t believed in God since he watched his father waste away slowly before dying surrounded by sycophants and reeking of death and his own sickness. If there is a God, He certainly doesn’t take very good care of His people, and Castiel can’t put his faith in someone like that.
Unfortunately for Michael, Castiel has a trigonometry test to study for, and he’s agreed to proofread one of Dean’s essays for him. He quite literally doesn’t have time for Michael’s bigotry.
Dean doesn’t have a job, whereas yesterday, he definitely did.
Perhaps there was the
and I-”
his parents, and that his brothers are on his Christmas card list and not much else (also that Cas has a Christmas card list). The struggles he had with finding the drive to get out of bed sometimes, much less find a job and keep his apartment.
With that, Castiel leaves the bedroom, never looking back at Dean to see how his words were received.
omega gave
She waves her hand at the podium. “What about hostessing?”
Dean blinks. “Anna, I don’t have a job lined up. It’s kind of… Spur of the moment.”
Cas smiles again and it comes easier this time. He finishes helping her tidy up, then makes his goodbyes. As he starts his car to drive home, he prays to the universe that this Dean Winchester he’s supposed to meet with is as kind as his mother was.
“What?”
“Cas, I-”
Dean doesn’t know how he missed the sight of the massive copper tub they keep in the shed for baths. A few wisps of steam are still rising lazily from the water, so Cas must have continually boiled water and added it back into the tub until Dean got home.
“Mornin’.” His own voice is hoarse, too.
The Colonel crowds close and lies along Cas’ back, his rump pressing against Cas’ tailbone and his big chest moving rhythmically against Castiel.
“It is.”
Claire looks up at him again, her icy blue eyes imploring and sad. “You’re not just pretending to be nice, right, Dean?”
Castiel puts his en down and turns in his chair to fully face his brother. “Of course.”
“We were so worried, and no text!” she scolds as she brings them big cups, black coffee for Dean and strong tea with sweetener and milk for Cas.
“You’re awake,” he says in a deep voice that Dean assumed was a hallucination, “that’s excellent.”
“Mick wants to mate Papa.”
Finally, an eternity and a third finger later, Cas loses his patience.
It's utterly terrifying, and her heart is frozen in fear for the first half of their dinner with the Novak boy.
me: *tells y'all on tumblr that I won't be able to post a new chapter for a while*
“Jack?” he calls. “Are you all right? Dean?”
Finally, John speaks.
He’s not sure how much time he loses to that particular line of thought, though it can’t be terribly long, since the Chinese place isn’t
desk.
Cas purses his lips but eventually nods. “I suppose that will be all right.”
he reminds himself firmly.
Cas doesn’t seem to notice. “Gods, Dean,” he says on a loud exhale. Are you all right?”
Overwhelmed by the breadth of emotion in his chest, not to mention the tightness around his cock, his voice comes out a bit strangled. “You can let me call you lovely as many times as I wish,” he says, shuddering as Dean sinks down completely until his ass rests on Cas’ hips.
Cas shudders at Dean’s dark tone, and by the time Dean has finished speaking, Cas has relaxed completely. His pretty eyes shine up at Dean when he looks at him again.
He also suspects that Sam would have complained more about being trailed to California, but when the final information came through about what his scholarship would cover and housing wasn’t on the list, he quieted his grumbling and moved into one of the guest bedrooms of Cas’ California home, conveniently only a few miles away from Stanford.
But creatures who are as good, as good as Castiel would like to believe himself to be, do not need control. They do not need as many rules or boundaries as Castiel has laid upon himself. They are good by instinct, reflex.
“Why did she ask you rather than come to me?”
Castiel says instead of asking when Uriel lost his mind. “We’re not supposed to exist. We’re
“Dean Winchester,” he replies coolly. His name has never been attached to any of his crimes since he uses an alias, and he doesn’t want to start off this interaction by lying to the sheriff of Cas’ hometown.
Here, in the space between them, the space that’s quiet and just for them, before the outside world can intervene, Dean whispers, “You did great, gorgeous.”
the pup asks reverently.
Cas is busy checking the contents of the basket. “I need you to take Claire to the bedroom and hide with her when Mick comes.”
you. You got a place to stay?”
Castiel shares wary glances with his companions before he follows the girl down the generic hall.
“No,” Cas says slowly. “I was going to sleep on the couch.”
Dean splutters, eyes darting over to look at him incredulously. “What are you talking about?”
a new feeling?)
things.
“Dean,” and now Dean knows it’s bad, “there’s no easy way to say this, son. I know that you and Castiel moved things up because of the promotion, that the wedding didn’t happen the way you wanted it, necessarily, and for that I apologize.”
The door opens to reveal Claire in her nightgown, a miniature of Cas’ own, her hair a wild cloud around her tear-streaked face. Arousal has never fled Dean so quickly.
Dean wraps an arm around Cas to hold him close. “All right, sweetheart. Whatever you say.”
“Dean, are we going to the bathroom?”
It’s Halloween, though, so Castiel doesn’t begrudge his brother his fun. Not that Gabriel has some sort of deficit of fun in his life, but All Hallow’s Eve has a special place in both of their hearts, and has for the last hundred and fifty years.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I most certainly am not.”
Unfair.
The truth.
Dean’s hands are resting on Cas’ hips now, and they tighten infinitesimally. “Yeah?” he rasps, eyes almost glowing up at Cas with adoration and devotion.
“I love you,” Cas murmurs softly where his face is pressed to Dean’s neck.
“Why, Cas, if you keep feedin’ me, you’re never gonna get rid of me.”
John cocks an eyebrow. “You know you don’t have to be in love to get married, son.”
“Just checking to see if you would be at Lafitte’s tonight, but I suppose your attitude has already answered that question, hasn’t it?” he asks, one blonde eyebrow arched.
Castiel really has always been best in a battle of strategy.

It’s quiet but for the soft clinks of silverware against fine china. It’s always silent at the dinner table in the Novak family.
Despite the ease of his kill, his chest heaves in excitement, in the muscle memory of kills before he became immortal, became
“How?” he rasps. It’s all his overwhelmed mind has to offer.
Something about preparing a meal for Cas and Claire
He does some damage to the garden, but it’s unavoidable. The garden is big enough that the hit it takes won’t be too noticeable, anyway, and Dean will do his best to make it up to Cas.
Anna is frowning. “‘She?’”
guy, and I was so
Dean scowls, but there’s no heat in it. “You know what I mean. I just… What the fuck am I supposed to do here, Cas? I didn’t ask for this.”
They both turn to look at Claire. She’s standing just in front of the little fireplace, her wide blue eyes imploring, a book clutched to her chest like a shield. Dean feels his own heart clench, he can’t imagine how Cas feels at the sight.
the face that Balthazar makes at their “obviously just got out of a shared shower” appearance, but he hears it in the other vampire’s voice.
the idea of kids. He just hasn’t met the right person yet.
Something in her must sense the gravity of the situation, because instead of arguing she just nods.
Cas is sitting in a big wingback chair situated next to the couch. There’s a massive basket next to the chair that’s overflowing with different colors and styles of yarn. The crochet hook is a blur in Cas’ long, skilled fingers. Now that the cold weather has passed, Cas makes blankets for a local orphanage and foster program. The blankets are beautiful, and once they land in a child’s hands, they belong to that child forever. There are teenagers who write Cas through the orphanage, thanking him for the first thing they ever owned.
“Huh?”
Cas stops, stunned.
Cas opens his mouth to say so when Dean frowns.
“I love you,” Cas says, all sweet and rough and sleep-slurred.
His focus right now, however, must be on Dean, not revenge. He pushes the anger to the back of his mind.
Intent on cheering himself up, he sticks his head out of his office. “Anna, do I have anything pressing to do before lunch?”
He shakes away his fast, anxiety-ridden thoughts and sits down across from John. “Sir, you wanted to see me?”
“I said I’ll take care of everything and I meant it,” Cas says, smiling and cupping Dean’s face in his wet hands. “Go lay down, alpha, I’ll join you when this is done.”
Dean quickly fumbles his own pants off, shoving them down just far enough to release his cock from their confines. With the pup in the house, he’s pushed his luck quite enough already when it comes to time.
Castiel sighs and lets the playful moment drift away. “Do you think he’ll be the enemy, truly?”
“Cas, the first night I was here, you threatened my life and I
“Get your shit, then. You’re coming with me. We’ve got a spare bedroom. You allergic to dogs?”
“Oh yeah?” Dean slowly starts to sink down, enveloping Cas in warmth.
He’s too grateful to ask, though.
Anna nods. “Yes, of course. This way.”
Mr. N is smiling warmly, an expression rare enough that Charlie has only seen it a time or two.
“I do believe you have yourself a deal, Dean.”
And it’s not like it’s a
“It’s cold,” he’ll say to the baffled, usually tipsy guest. “You must keep warm.”
“She declined, told me that she had always planned on turning both Anna and I. That we were to be the first of her army, the first of the revolution, though I didn’t care to try to understand what she was saying at the time. She kept us down there, in that dark dungeon, chained to the wall, for… I don’t know how long we were there. She beat us regularly, tortured us mercilessly. I was waterboarded, burned, and starved. Never enough to scar, but she had other ways. She dumped cold water on our heads and left us shivering for hours. She would neglect to feed us for days, then leave fresh plates of food in the middle of the room. She told me often that if I were only to say yes, our suffering would stop. It was… Well, I imagine it is the hell I will return to when I die.”
Why are you nervous?”
A vampire.
“Zeke, no, it was Michael that-”
John tries to contort his face into something… Well, Dean’s guessing that he’s going for “fatherly,” but he sort of just looks like he’s in some sort of mild pain.
Balthazar, brooding on Gabe’s other side and dressed in very stereotypical all black with his trademark deep v-neck shirt, apparently has no such qualms. “You’re a very difficult being to be seen with often,” he says to Gabriel.
She smiles. “Good. You boys hungry?”
Dean can smell his own scent go flat with surprise before absolutely
“Thank you for your kind wishes,” he says instead.
(He’s too busy wondering why he cares.)
“How can we believe that?” Balthazar demands. “How could you even prove such a thing?”
from there.
“Very sore. Tired. Like I’d like to stuff these donuts down my throat and sleep for a year.”
(Not that Cas particularly cares one way or another, really, but Dean has set college up as some sort of holy grail that only Sam is worthy of. Cas is determined that Dean will get there, too.)
Dean hates hiring, but after two weeks of interviews, he decides that he doesn’t mind Nick.
“The hell was that?”
Any worries that Dean had regarding young Charlene finding out about the supernatural was misguided at best. Cas doesn’t know how, but Charlie already knew. During a scheduled board game night that ended up lasting until morning, Cas had winced when a beam of sunlight hit his arm. He and Dean both panicked, but Charlie simply stood up, closed the blinds and curtains, and sat back down again.
The night ended well, if predictably. Gabe found two women (both sober and well into their thirties, his brother has done quite a bit of growing up in the last fifty years), and Castiel went back to his hotel room alone, as is his preference. Normally, he’d shower, eat, and fall asleep reading, grateful that he’d spent the day with Gabe, and also grateful that he was back to his solitude.
Charlie is hella confused, so she just follows Mr. N. When they get into the building, they follow a long hallway into a big room that must dominate most of the space in the building. It’s an open area, with chairs lining the walls and another row or two of people standing behind those. All in all, there must be almost two hundred people here.
“Yeah, I bet you are. Love you like this, all desperate for me. Think you can come on my cock, baby?”
Instead, Castiel dragged Dean off that horse, cleaned him up, treated his wounds, fed him, and sheltered him. He took care of Impala and let Dean rest. All while not knowing if Dean would be dangerous or not, and not expecting anything in return.
“C’mon, darlin’,” Dean growls directly into Cas’ ear, making the omega whine again. He lets go of Cas’ hip to grip his cock and starts stroking him hard and fast, relishing the way Cas’ entire body clenches. “Come for me.”
She glances at her screen again. “No specifics, just says contract renegotiation with a Castiel Novak.”
As soon as he’s there, he sweeps Cas into his arms and kisses him hard and filthy. Cas responds in kind, the hand not holding his violin case twisted up in Dean’s shirt to keep him close.
like this to yourself,” he says as he tugs at Impala’s reins. “Wouldn’t want anyone to get the idea that you’re picking and choosing which citizens of this fine township you’re here to protect.”
There are dogs
Dean, enthralled with the act of feeding and being fed from, has stopped moving. That’s all right, though, because it means Cas can roll them over until Dean is on his back. He’s careful to keep Dean’s legs from twisting awkwardly and to make sure neither set of fangs is dislodged.
Charlie frowns and stops counting money.
So it’s Cas’ turn to get his ear talked off by the weird little dude who delivers the groceries once a week and Dean’s turn to pout in bed until he gets up.
anyone like Cas, much less involved with them. Cas is so unabashedly open, affectionate, and loving. He heaps physical touch onto Dean like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do, and Dean soaks it up like an abandoned puppy - needy, shameless, greedy for it.
“Thank you,” he rasps instead of voicing his thoughts. “Dunno if I’ve said it yet.”
Michael is deathly white, save for two high spots of color on his cheeks. Castiel leans even closer to whisper in his ear.
Dean stares down at this little girl who is so much older than she should be. He shoves away the knot of vile emotions that ties itself into his chest when he thinks about Mick mating Cas and focuses on Claire.
Dean’s eyes are somehow hard and understanding at the same time. He nods once, sharply, and Castiel continues.
“He was raised by his mother, who he says worked very hard to provide for him. He’s pre-med, and credits her with getting him that far.”
- Whew. That one was a doozy, y'all.
He will never be able to tell them out loud how much he appreciates it that they’ve come, the loyalty they’ve shown. Not only because they wouldn’t hear it, anyway, but because there are no words.
Cas just hums his agreement and watches as Dean finds a rhythm. For now, Castiel is content to watch as Dean chases his pleasure. He is, as always, fascinated by the way Dean moves, the way his muscles shift beneath his skin. The urgency of his own orgasm fades as he lies in awe of Dean.
Regardless, he feels Dean’s lips against his skin. “You don’t have to say anything,” Dean murmurs. “We’ll take care of it together, okay?”
with one hand weakly and pressing his teeth to the flesh to draw more of the liquid
“Official diagnosis?”
“Papa?”
Dean’s own eyebrows raise. “You, too? What are y’all so busy with?”
Donna beams again, which looks natural on her open, pretty face. “Well, don’t you worry. Everything is gonna work out great!”
“Claire,” Cas says from the bedroom doorway where he’s appeared again. His voice is a bit strained, his eyes worried. Dean does his best to project an image of “harmless, injured alpha.”
He’s a snake in her Eden, and Anna doesn’t like him.
That’s all right, Dean just needs to him to listen.
“Good night, alpha.”
“Hmm?”
beneath Dean. Where Dean has thick, hard-packed muscle, Cas has some give. Not a lot, he has some lean muscle of his own, but there’s enough softness to highlight their differences and it drives Dean wild. Where Dean’s scent is heavy and thick with arousal, Cas’ is airy and sweet with the same, though no less heady.
Cas whispers, eyes darting up to meet Dean’s then down to stare at his chest, “but my bed, and we can-”
He’s through letting Naomi control even that much of him, however. He will not let her or fear of her determine what he shares with his friends, his family.
pups. He adores them, really. Outside of his subgender, the thought of harming a pup is so thoroughly abhorrent to him it makes his chest tighten and ache.
Zeke nods, satisfied. “I was waiting for you, and then…” And now his face darkens, anger clouding his expression. Cas’ spine feels like ice and his legs are tingling, whether with the need to flee or warning of collapse, Cas doesn’t know.
He tries, for the sake of his own conscience, to go slowly, but Cas is having none of that, either. After the first few tentative thrusts, Cas
The floodgates were open after that.
Donna’s eyebrows raise, but she rolls with the surprise admirably. Dean is unspeakably grateful. She nods once, decisively, and pats his shoulder.
“Why?” Benny had asked. “Gotta be easier people to hire, brotha.”

Sam protests, “I can’t-”
“Hi,” Cas whispers, soft in a way he can only be with Dean. “How are you feeling?”
of Dean fucking Winchester. It drives him crazy, makes his skin feel too tight and twitchy. He wants to inhale Dean, to absorb him to get close enough that they’re so entangled that they’re basically one person.
There’s no hint of shyness in Dean as his hand starts to move faster, his chest heaving as he strips his cock. He’s lovely, hair wild from their shower and Cas’ fingers He almost glows, and Cas loves him so intensely at that moment that it hurts a little.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well, Dean Winchester, you and Impala are welcome to stay here while you recover enough to travel the rest of the way to meet your brother.”
(Somehow, they manage to fit in talking about the demons Anna carries, too.)
Colonel barks happily and bounds to Dean’s side, tail going wild. Dean grins down at him. “You wanna go with? And leave your liege lord here?”
“Have you done this before?” he asks.
No, Dean wants the body gone and somewhere Cas doesn’t know about so it’s no longer a burden Cas has to carry.
A little more than an hour later, Dean manages to stumble and limp his way back into the house. The meat has been salted and the hides are ready for tanning, although that’s a bit beyond Dean’s energy right now.
Cas, too, is watching her. “So it seems that it won’t,” he replies, clearly distracted.
Cas sobers quickly, his brown furrowing.
“I… Don’t really know, actually.”
And when they started being

students of Pontiac Prep, a double-whammy of academic perfection and intimidatingly well-done orthodontia. Castiel and his siblings enjoy a bit of privilege because of it, he knows. He has little shame about using that privilege to further himself.
Cas has become, all on his own, the most important person in Dean’s life, and Cas doesn’t care about Dean’s job at all. Actually, Cas might actively dislike the job, but that’s only because he thinks they ask too much of Dean without giving him enough in return.
Everyone is shaking their heads and murmuring, but it’s Gabe who’s looking right at Cas, gaze softened where it’s normally hard and mischievous. “You did great, Cassie. There’s no reason for them not to sign.”
Claire chews on her bottom lip. “Are… Are you done workin’?”
Like her father, Claire doesn’t return it. “You’re an alpha.”

Claire whispers back, her own eyes wide as she stares up at him.

Dean winks across the table at Cas, who’s blushing furiously again and smiling down at his own plate.
“Joshua has been murdered.”
“We’ll have to be quick,” Cas whispers hotly, his mouth pressed to Dean’s cheek, “and we’ll have to be quiet, but I want you, alpha. I can’t stand it anymore, I-”
“Dean!” Claire says between peals of sweet, innocent laughter. “That’s silly!

“Okay there, Cas?”
- Chapters should start getting longer after this one.
Dean Winchester is, of course, devastatingly handsome, and Castiel is so, so weak, so he’s predisposed to say “yes” to whatever the other man wants, anyway. Add to that a touch of nerves and the shine of vulnerability in those lovely green eyes? Ah, Cas is
Though they had the night before and Dean knows the feelings are mutual, he’s still nervous when he leans down. That trepidation is banished immediately when Cas meets him halfway, morning breath be damned, and kisses him back.
That’s quite true. If Dean wants Adam to stay, Cas will warmly welcome him. If Dean wants Adam out, though, Cas will send him on his way (with a hat, some cash, and a hot meal). It’s not as though Castiel has any contact at all with any of his own family, he would be throwing stones from a glass house, should he choose to throw them.
Castiel is hissing whispers into the pup’s ear. Dean only catches snippets.
“... Uh, no? Why would it?”
Nick is standing next to her
Dean chuckles, but insists, “C’mon, Cas, there’s gotta be something I can do to lighten the load a little.”
With a whimper, she throws herself across the room. She clambers up onto the bed and collapses into Dean’s arms. Blindly, she flails behind her so she can get a fistful of Cas’ nightgown and tug him close until she’s squashed between the two of them.
“I don’t have words for what Joshua did for me, Dean. He helped my mind, body, and spirit heal from the damage Naomi wrought. He told me…” Castiel’s voice breaks. “He told me that I made a brave choice and that I was my own man. That the choice of mortality was taken from me, but not of humanity. That I could be whoever I wanted to be.
Dean can’t spend one more godsforsaken moment without his lips on Cas’. He kisses the omega gently, tempering his own need by reminding himself harshly that Cas isn’t ready, that Cas doesn’t want to anything more than kiss and be held. Dean is
Dean leans forward and stands slowly. He’s pleased that he’s able to without stumbling - his legs feel a little numb.
Sam comes in and closes the door behind him quickly. By force of habit, Dean checks Sam over for blood or injuries, but the kid looks fine, if a little shaken up.
Dean's green eyes are shining, imploring when Cas meets them.
When he looks back at Cas, there are high spots of color on his cheeks. He pulls the door shut behind him and murmurs a soft, “Good morning, Dean.”
He has a right to his suspicion. Claire watches the window, the ghost of a devious smile on her lips, and tells Dean as soon as her father is out of sight. They leap into action. Or, as much action as a five-year-old and an injured man can possibly leap into, anyway.
Dean’s voice cuts through his haze like butter. He whips his head around to see Dean diving for the gun, then standing and pointing it at Zeke, his eyes wild, his chest heaving.
It’s because of this that he forces himself to relax. There’s not a lot he can do about his pained scent, but he forces his body language to abandon the defensiveness he took on when Cas whipped his pup out of the room like it was on fire.
“Gabe,” Cas says with a sigh. “Please do shut up.”
Cas snatches the phone up, answers it, and presses it to his ear in less than an entire second. “Hello?”
“What are we going to
“Then, we come back to Pontiac, use my mother’s influence and money to gently but quite ruthlessly and thoroughly execute a takeover of your parents’ business.”
“Not the time, Sam!” Dean barks.
Cas wraps both of Dean’s hands in both of his and leans forward until their foreheads are pressed together. Dean closes his eyes and presses into the comforting touch of Cas, the love of his life, his rock in the hailstorm that his life sometimes is.
He doesn’t need him. If he needs family, he’s got Cas. If he needs blood, he’ll call Sammy up and they’ll go to dinner. If he needs a parent, he’ll call his mom (and cross his fingers that she answers, but still). He doesn’t need an abusive, neglectful bastard in his life.
Dean’s mom comes to the door, drying her hands on a towel. Dean knows very well what she does for a living, but dressed in ratty jeans and one of his dad’s old flannels, it’s hard to think of her as anything but “mom.”
The weeks after Anna’s call quickly blur together in a haze of reports, false leads, and chasing any information they can get their hands on.
Uriel sneers again. “You always were too attached to those…
of them trusts him, and they have no reason to. Something terrible happened on this pretty little farm, something that left Cas to care for the both of him on his own however he could. And maybe Cas didn’t do it on purpose, but Dean didn’t miss how the omega made sure to mention that he’s expecting someone to come see them. Someone is expecting Castiel and Claire to be alive an unharmed, and Cas made damn sure Dean knows it.
Dean stands next to him, tall and proud, and doesn’t look queasy at all. He’s relaxed as they observe the deceptively plain building in front of them. His leather jacket looks good on his broad frame, and it’s almost impossible to tell that he’s hiding a blade in each of his sleeves. If they weren’t in such a dire situation, Cas would find it unbearably attractive.
(See the end of the chapter for
It made little sense to Castiel at the time, but then, so little got through his haze of denial.
about giving you coffee,” the omega says archly. “Until then, you’ll have to content yourself with water, I’m afraid.”
Dean is unhappy, his usually carefree smile darkened and tight as he steers them toward their next class.
- I missed these guys and this 'verse and you guys. ❤
The people here are dressed to the nines, which kind of freaks Dean out. He ditched the leather jacket and is wearing a dark button-down and a pair of dark-wash jeans that only have a hole in one knee, so he got a little gussied up, but he’s seeing evening dresses, for God’s sake.
“I was in America when Hannah, an old friend, reached out to me about Alastair… And the rest, as they say, is history.”
As the silence spins out between them, Castiel sits back on his heels and closes his eyes for a final time. He doesn’t know how he feels. He expected, maybe, to feel lighter, to feel better, but he just feels unmoored without the weight of his secrets, of his shortcomings.
He also wants it far away from Cas.
“If Papa is caring for you, then you cannot be a stranger,” she continues carefully, “so it must be safe to give you my name. Papa wouldn't care for you and not let me tell you my name.”
Claire nods happily. “Uh-huh. It didn’t burn, and Papa helped me stir it.”
“Almost done here, chief,” Benny says, wiping his hands on a rag. He’s called Dean “chief” since the moment they met. Cas is “Mr. N,” a marked improvement from the formal “Mr. Novak” Benny insisted on using until recently.
He wakes up, he and Cas have coffee and breakfast together, and then they load Colonel up into Baby, who’s finally back from the body shop, and go to Needs Must. While there, he does whatever Cas needs, be it stocking shelves, cleaning, organizing, or general small repair. Regulars of the shop start to recognize him, and he finds himself embroiled in friendly chats about cars, politics, business ownership, and dogs. He wears t-shirts, jeans, and boots every day.
Once there is nothing but crumbs left, Claire takes the plates carefully to the washing tub and places them in one by one. Cas watches this with a wide-eyed bemusement before turning to Dean with an arched eyebrow. Dean grins and holds his hands up in surrender.
Dean gives her a rueful smile. “Don’t be, I’m the one scheduling meetings and forgetting them. What’s the meeting for?”
Dean doesn’t move from where he’s buried his face in Cas’ neck. “They’re hiring someone else.”
Cas nods slowly. “... Yes?”
Dean is growling deep in his chest as Cas starts fucking him again. His long, bowed legs come up to wrap around Cas’ waist, limiting his range of movement but allowing him deeper. He sets a brutal pace, one that would hurt Dean if he was still human. The growl in Dean’s chest changes pitch until it’s a hitched whine. Castiel feels Dean’s ass rippling around him and knows he’s close.
“You can see, then, why Naomi seemed like such an angel.”
“Well,” Cas says, “I thought we’d start the day with a story over breakfast, how does that sound?”
“For a while,” Dean agrees with a grin. It’s enough for now.
Once Naomi falls, the rest resolves itself rather simply. Or so Castiel assumes. He is consumed by watching the remnants of pale blood ooze from her neck far too slowly to be human.
Claire’s sweet pup scent has evened out. It goes sweeter with relief and happiness, and she manages a watery smile.
“Now, I don’t expect that you’re ready to say it back,” Cas is going on, “but I wanted you to know. You’re so good to Claire and I, and you’ve been wonderful from the moment you woke up, you’ve been so patient, and I just wanted you to know how I-”
“This is Dean Winchester. The poor boy’s family admitted him when he was very young. They visited a few times in the beginning, but it’s probably been over ten years since he had a visitor.”
Dean takes a moment to lean back and drink in the sight of Cas, letting his own desire mount even more as he does so. Cas’ cock is a good handful, maybe a bit bigger than the average omega’s. It’s hard, as hard as Dean feels, and curved up towards Cas’ flat belly, framed by the way the fabric of his nightgown is creased and crushed over Cas’ abdomen.
“Where did this come from?”
Without the gang, though, he was lost, aimless. He did some drugs, slept around, and let his life lose meaning. He was prepared to die that way without his Andrea.
He washes Dean tenderly from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. Each of his muscles is given a thorough rub down and washing until Dean is a puddle in Cas’ capable hands.
Dean shrugs on his way to the kitchen. “Cas and I are doing something beautiful and natural, Sammy, nothin’ to be squicked by.”
Cas hmphs. “Not today, it doesn’t,” he murmurs defiantly as he buries his face in Dean’s chest again.
Cas’ mouth is firm, warm, and everything Dean has been daydreaming of. They kiss for a long time, slow and gentle, tender and sweet. There’s no heat in it, not now, with both of them so emotional.
When he turns, Cas is staring down at the pile of fabric in front of him in consternation. From what Dean saw while he and Claire were sorting, all but one or two were fairly simple projects, and from what he can see now, they all look to be done.
“I don’t know if I trust myself.”
The gun is
“Cas,” Dean whispers, “are you certain?” He would have to go dunk himself in a cold river to do it, but if Cas told him to stop, he’d find the strength to do so.
just-fucked wild this time, sticking up at all angles while Cas squinted angrily at a cup of coffee. He was wrapped in Dean’s threadbare bathrobe and one hand was absently stroking Colonel behind the ears. Dean loves him so much it hurts.
seeks it out.
And it is strong. Even the brief dip he experienced has him reeling - he feels lightheaded and he can feel his heart racing  unnecessarily. Gabe’s dilated pupils and accelerated breathing say that he’s feeling much the same.
“You close, sweetheart?” Dean growls.
Dean sits forward, leaning his forearms on the edge of the desk.
you, I would never be able to live with myself.”
“What’s your name, son?” the sheriff asks, though he’s probably not nearly old enough to address Dean that way.
Sam sits on the bed and pushes his shaggy hair back out of his face. Dean turns in his desk chair to face his little brother and give him his full attention. Sam is one of only a few people who warrant Dean’s regard like that, and Dean takes pretty much everything Sam says seriously.
Claire’s brow wrinkles in concentration. “Papa says I’m too little for more chores. And I shouldn’t feel guilty, because it’s his job as a Papa to take care of everything.”
doing with his life, and now it’s in shambles because he couldn’t just let it be.
It occurs to Dean that the omega staring at him warily from across the little bedroom is more courageous than he’s ever been in his life.
Lucky for Dean, blood and violence were his first languages.
“I meant every word,” Cas says earnestly, his hands resting on Dean’s muscled thighs.
Colonel’s growling grows louder, more pointed, and Dean says coldly, “One word outta you and I shoot, you got that, pal?”
Sleep is a long time coming. He’s too busy thinking about where Cas’ alpha is.
He’s holding a tray with a covered dish, a cup, and a pitcher on it. He looks surprised but not upset to see Dean awake as he kicks the door shut behind him and approaches the bed.
“Are you ready?”
“Love you, alpha,” she whispers, then falls back down and burrows herself under the blankets.
“The First is a
“I don’t,” he croaks. He winces, clears his throat, and tries again. “I don’t suppose I can convince you to stay in the car?”
Dean smiles wide. “Yeah, babe.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Thank you," Cas whispers.
“I won’t say that this isn’t shocking, or that I don’t understand why you kept this a secret all this time.” Dean winces, but Cas just strokes his jawline gently and keeps going.
Instead, he says simply, “I love you, too.”
The whole crew at The Bunker wears crocheted beanies all through the colder months. Benny’s is a solemn grey, Anna’s is black with subtle glitter in it, and Charlie’s is an eye-smarting shade of yellow. Bal’s is black, too, and Jo’s is a deep purple. Kevin’s own is his favorite (obviously), a dark shade of maroon, and Mr. N. and Mr. W wear hats that match one another’s eye colors, as gag-inducingly cute as that is.
Because, again, Dean is a giver, he always goes to him when Cas gets like that. Oh, he’s still more dominant than not, especially because Cas is always begging and needy like this, but he lets Cas have what he wants.
A full week after Cas agreed to let Dean stay, Dean makes supper for the three of them.
“Absolutely not, Cas,” Dean says firmly. “I know what you’re going to say, and just… No.”
Castiel nods. Dean will find his way to a point eventually. “It is.”
Gently, Dean brings the covers up to just beneath her chin and makes a show of tucking them around her shoulders until she giggles. He smiles down at her and smoothes her hair away from her face.
Cas’ blue eyes are wide with surprise and his hair is wilder than usual, flattened on one side and sticking straight out on the other, but that’s not what has Dean’s tongue tied in knots.
As Dean is thinking about his brother’s clean getaway, Sam pulls out his own pistol, lets out a (ridiculous) battle cry, and shoots wildly at their pursuer.
Cas feels so
The crowd doesn’t obviously part for them as they make their way to the dance floor, but they don’t run into anyone, either. Dean wraps his strong arms around Cas’ waist and pulls him close. Cas drapes his own arms around Dean’s neck, and he can’t quite help the way his lips quirk up into a tiny smile when Dean presses his cheek to Cas’ and starts to sway them gently from side to side.
busy from before sunrise to well, well after dark, and Dean can’t help but feel guilty as hell.
It’s not that Castiel Novak has been anything but perfectly polite.
He waits until it’s late enough that he knows for sure that Claire will be dead asleep. It really wouldn’t do for him to be interrupted now. He might lose his nerve.
165lbs
Cas swallows hard. “And if one of us… Meets someone?”
Instead, he’s sitting next to Dean, who’s hunched over his cup of coffee like it holds the secrets to the universe. It was a late night last night, with their long conversation and the trip back from the interrogation, so they didn’t end up getting much sleep. Castiel himself is quite refreshed, but Dean requires more rest than he does. They didn’t even get dressed more than throwing on old t-shirts and pajama pants again before coming downstairs.
“Maybe when you can hold your own bowl, I’ll
Cas is a study in contradictions in every aspect of their entwined lives. Normally, he wants rigid control over both of them. In bed, though, he gives it up, lets Dean tell him what to do and what to say and when to come It’s mind-blowingly hot, really.
He roasts the bird in the cookfire until it’s crispy and brown. He also roasts a few carrots and long green beans in the juices from the bird until they, too, are browned and flavorful. The bread has, of course, already been baked. The only thing he’s missing is wine, but the cool, clear water from the well is almost as good.
A rustling sound, one body moving closer to another. “Baby,
Mr. N’s chuckle cuts her off. “Charlie, please,” he says with a smile. “Just come with me.”
Claire’s shriek sets Dean’s ears to ringing, but he smiles down at her when she turns in her seat to beam at him.
Relief almost bowls Dean over. “Thanks, Sammy.”
“What-”
Without another word, Claire darts out of the room.
Cas feels like his head is underwater, making sound and light seem far away and unreal. “Oh?”
He carefully pulls all of his clothes off and leaves them in a pile at the door. He’ll burn them in the morning, they smell to high heaven and are stained with any number of unnameable things.
“You mine, Cas?”
“Well, desist. There’s no need.”
“... Did I even know you then?”
Dean is standing in the kitchen, just out of sight of the crowd. Jo’s a master bartender (not as good as he himself is, in his oh-so-humble opinion), and her hands blur as she pours and mixes. Balthazar is giving him the stink-eye for taking up space, but it's a nightly ritual that lacks any real fire.
anything from me. You’re our guest, and still injured to boot. I quite insist that you have the bed.”
It’s been a stressful week. With Cas’ nightmare recurring early int he week and Dean’s search for a bartender, they both needed some peace today. With the birds singing, the sun highlighting the dark browns and so-black-it’s-almost-blues in Cas’ messy hair, and the three dogs behaving like angels, Dean feels like they’re getting it.
Anyone with two mating marks is bound to be sore on the subject, and hadn’t he already thought about how Cas doesn’t smell mated?
They draw Benny’s attention
As soon as he thinks it, Naomi is in front of him, a sword in her hand that’s remarkably similar to Castiel’s own. Her blouse is torn and there’s a cut high on her cheek that’s sluggishly oozing pinkish blood. Her eyes are crazed and manic, but focused enough to settle on him. Her mouth firms into a solemn line.
he thinks. Then,
He manages to get the car unlocked just as Cas loses whatever patience he had. Cas bites Dean’s lower lip hard enough to draw blood and send excitement skittering down his spine. Dean pulls the back door open and laughs when Cas shoves him into the backseat. Cas just growls and crawls in on top of him, slamming the door shut behind them.
“I haven’t seen
Cas bursts into laughter, and he’s so lovely that Dean forgets to breathe for a moment.
Dean thinks at eleven forty-five,
There are few moments in his life that Dean can look back on and definitively say, “I did the right thing.” Cutting ties with his father as soon as Sam graduated high school. Following Sam to Stanford and helping his little brother out. Taking the German Shepherd puppy from the shady dude in the Wal-Mart parking lot and refusing to pay him for the little dude.
He thinks of Sam, going to the nearest town on the river from where they last saw one another, waiting and waiting, finally accepting that Dean wasn’t going to be meeting him there like he was supposed to.
want to submit the proposal to Winchester Motors, you’ll stuff it and listen to Cas.:
Besides his scent, though, Cas gives no hints as to what he’s thinking. His fingers are calloused on Dean’s newly exposed skin, and when he uses a towel to dry Dean’s face when he’s finished, his touch is gentle. He still barely looks at Dean, though, and they haven’t spoken a word to one another since Cas came into his own bedroom to help Dean shave.
“Have you given any thought to what you’d like to do?”
polite might actually be more accurate. He complimented Anna’s blouse and did the same for Dean’s office upon entering. He’s wearing a
“Cas,” Dean gasps, his hands instinctively landing on Cas’ hips, “I-”
Castiel wonders,
The omega nods, but Dean can’t be sure if his story is holding. Before he can try to lay it on a little thicker, the omega is speaking.
Cas is frowning down at his inventory book (he’s
When she finally slips back into slumber, Cas leans up to kiss Dean gently, chastely. A reminder of the affection flowing freely between the two of them.
It’s common knowledge/not knowledge that the Winchesters are high-ranking members of the local organized crime enterprise. Castiel has heard that John and Mary have their hands in any number of shady dealings. He knows for a fact that they frequently socialize with the Crowleys, who are definitely less than savory.
“It will be difficult to imagine, because you are so young, but there was no paperwork involved when she adopted me, no background check. I doubted they even questioned her intentions. I was simply one less mouth to feed. There was some money exchanged, I assume, and then I was being sent home with her.
“Not to the company,” John says quickly. “No one is questioning your loyalty to the company.”
Dean surges upwards and presses their lips together, and just like every time, Cas flashes hot and cold a the touch.
The warehouse is generously named as such. It’s more aptly described as an enormous shed, really. Castiel has no idea what its original purpose was, but there is only one giant room. There are no offices and no second floor. Just one room, metal walls, and a rusting tin roof.
Dean Winchester enters his father’s office with trepidation making him queasy.
Dean runs a hand along his scruffy jaw. “‘s itchy,” he mumbles a little, embarrassed. In for a penny, though. “Don’t suppose you have a razor I can use?”
Dean’s not here for some pissing contest. He’s here for Cas and Cas alone.
Naomi’s face could be carved from granite for all that she gives away. “Are you, now?”
Castiel keeps a stiff, formal smile on his face as another board member from a local university wishes him a happy birthday. The man is short, round, sweaty, and inexplicably smells like sausage.
“Hmm?”
It ended up being quite true. With careful and shrewd planning, Henry had grown the business steadily. He’d died shortly after Sam was born, but by then, they’d been the owners of the biggest automotive repair company in the Midwest. John had already stepped in as the head of the company.
After they clean up, Cas goes into the office to start logging the new inventory. Dean and Kevin work on the schedule or the stage, what nights they’ll have live entertainment and what nights Kevin is available to work. The Colonel lies at their feet, content.  Benny is making the security rounds, keeping an eye on the back alleys and front walkways.
out of the ordinary, but the third time he has to drag his mind away from cheeseburgers and French fries, he has to at least acknowledge the problem.
Charlie is bopping her head to Billy Joel as she helps Anna wipe down the tables as they ready the club to open. Kevin is going through his music choices for the night with Dean and Cas up on the dance floor, but for now, Dean has the controls, so old music it is. He may have a point, though, because Bal is humming from the kitchen as he preps for the night. Even Benny is drumming his fingers against his thigh to the beat.
The realization that he doesn’t regret Cas, even if it cost him his promotion, is like a soothing balm over the raw, open sore that is his heart right now. They may have taken his job away, but he got Cas on his own. And sure, maybe he got married for them, but he fell in love with Cas all on his own, and Cas at the very least likes him a whole lot, if last night is anything to go by. That happened without the goddamn board’s approval, either. Or John’s, or Winchester Motors’.
Dean squints suspiciously at him even as he cuddles closer and wraps a trembling arm around Cas’ leg to keep him still. “Promise?” he demands, so unlike his usual easygoing self. Castiel wonders if he needs to make it clearer to Dean that there is nowhere he’d rather be than right next to him, or if Dean already knows that and it’s just his medicine making him hazy.
And then he claimed it as his.
He comes back to himself slowly, and as soon as he’s able, he pulls his fangs from Dean’s neck and gently licks at the wounds. The magic in his saliva has them healing in moments. Once he’s satisfied, he begins whispering in Dean’s ear.
When Dean wakes again, it’s to the bland, sweet-milk smell of
Watching Cas play with the pup, seeing a little bit of his raising of her and how good he is at it, makes Dean’s scent thick with contentment. From the way Cas meets his eyes and smiles, he can tell that he’s stinking up the place, but he doesn’t try to stop. He
Dean just stares at his father for a beat. “You…
Castiel buries his besotted smile in Dean’s hair and fairly drowns in gratitude. “I’m sorry, dearheart.”
Until a familiar twink sat down next to him at a bar, introduced himself as Dean, and talked about a job offer with no long-term guarantees. He talked about loss, how he and his partner were familiar with it, and how they wanted to help Benny get back on his feet if he’d come to work with them (always “with,” never “for”).
As his exhaustion finally drags him into slumber, Castiel thinks that he doesn’t need Dean to say the words out loud to him. He knows how Dean feels about him, it’s written clearly in every move Dean makes, in how Dean has stayed by his side, trusted him with his most vulnerable secrets.
Cas meets Gabriel's eyes. “Naomi.”
He comes in through the back (heh) and makes his way to the bar.
Dean once again takes the lead out of the building and Cas keeps his eyes on the back of his head instead of the death around them.
“No,” Cas cuts him off, “I’ve let you say your piece, and now I’d like to say mine. He waits until Dean nods to continue.
She nods and pulls the strap of her purse over her shoulder. “Good. It’s about time. Where are we going?”
“Uriel,” Castiel breathes.
Cas is moving around the front counter before he realizes it. “Dean? What’s wrong? What happened? I-”
It’s not easy to keep his hands to himself, to keep the kisses he and Cas share short and sweet, but he does it. Mostly because he wants Cas to be in control, to lead the way for every step they take together.
The room is the picture of elegance. Opulence without overcompensation. The walls are a dark, rich red. The wood on the crown molding is dark, too, and polished to gleaming. The tablecloth is pristine, no food would dare stain Naomi Novak’s linens. The wine (one glass is permitted for each child after the age of fifteen) is full-bodied and heavy. The food is magazine-quality, both aesthetically and to taste. The lights are rather low, and candles placed periodically on the table make up for the lack.
“It’s a private matter, but I’ll tell you before we leave so you can feel more comfortable getting in the car with me.”
Castiel smiles. “Thank you, dearheart. I cannot tell you what it means to me that you’re here with me.”
“It’s all right. Shh, it’s all right. You’re safe now.”
Later, after Cas bids him goodnight and shuts the door, Dean glares at the dark ceiling and wishes he had a mirror so he could be glaring at himself, instead.
than nothing to him, he was already way too into whatever this thing with Cas was, but she was cute, and her family was wealthy, no harm in keeping a friendly connection), and when his eyes met Cas’, those blue depths burned with a barely contained fury.
“Am I sleeping in your
Dean rouses a bit. “Cas, the water-”
It’s just he and Dean when they leave. Sam has class the next day and Dean refused to let him miss, but Castiel refused to let him be unprotected. He bribed Gabe and Balthazar with promises of frequent updates (and, to Gabriel, a promise that he would be all right) to stay behind.
Dean had shrugged. “Well, I told Cas a little bit about you, and he’s got a big heart. He wants to help. Thinks it’s ‘destiny’ that we knew each other, and that we need someone to help with security and that you’re a little lost right now.” A smile had graced Dean’s lips. “Cas is real good at finding lost people and bringin’ ‘em on home.”
Cas’ smile is tight and disingenuous, but Claire doesn’t seem to notice, thank the gods. “That’s right, little one. No chores
Cas is staring up at him defiantly, bashfulness forgotten. His hands are on his hips, emphasizing how slender he is, and his bare feet give him an air of vulnerability.
Joshua taught him that real love is precious and certainly not to be played with. He also taught Cas that
Cas makes a keening sound that’s barely human, raw and animalistic. He takes a beat to adjust, then plants his hands on Dean’s bare chest and starts to ride him like a man possessed.
“You’re not going to deny it?”
A short time later, Dean finds himself in Cas’ bed, his chest pressed against Cas’ slim back where he’s curled around the omega. Cas fell asleep rather quickly, but Dean finds himself fighting the urge to drop off into slumber. He wants to savor every moment of having Cas in his arms, replay every part of the last several days, relive the way Claire whispered that she loves him. Just in case it’s all a dream.
Dean slumps a little in what looks like relief.
he vows, as serious as promise as he’s ever made to anyone.
Once he has his cup, he ushers Cas to the table, murmuring, “Come sit down, rest a moment.”
Before Balthazar can respond to Sam’s sass, Gabe saunters into the dining room. He’s wearing what Cas is relatively certain is a women’s pink silk robe that barely hits the middle of his thighs. It’s also only sort of tied closed, so more of him is on display than is not.
“No complaining, pup,” Cas says firmly, but not without fondness. “Go now, please. The sooner you’re done with work, the sooner you’ll be able to play.”
“Mhm.” Cas thinks he might drag Dean to the library. There’s an essay due in one of their literature classes in a couple of weeks, and he wants to get a head start on it.
moments before Dean follows Cas over the edge. He remembers, barely, to pull out and come across Cas’ softening cock and belly instead of knotting him. A deep, primal part of Dean is going
Naomi raises one beautiful, sculpted brow. “I’ve heard some… Disturbing rumors about you and the eldest Winchester boy.”
Dean forces himself to focus on Cas again. He reaches up to cup Cas’ face. “Hey, I know. I don’t want you to hurt yourself is all, baby.”
Especially when he sees an opening and takes it, slicing deep enough and fast enough into her leg that he can feel the tendons snapping beneath his blade. Naomi goes down on one knee and her blade rests in her hand as she pants, staring up at him with crazed eyes.
The guy is charming, into classic cars and classic rock. He’s objectively good-looking, Dean guesses, and a shameless flirt. He fills out the plain black tee he wears with obvious muscle, too, which will be useful if Benny ever needs backup.
Castiel hates it on sight.
Descriptions/implications of Castiel being admitted/kept in a psychiatric facility, as well as drugged and enrolled in drug testing trials, against his will as a child.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean feels a bit frantic as he rocks all of them gently back and forth, but Cas is remarkably calm.
“She’s awfully cute,” Dean says with a smile.
At first, they were taken warily. Now it’s common knowledge. If you come to The Bunker, the owner will make you take a hat to stay warm.
“You’re… Gonna talk to Cas about this.”
- Dean is a huge simp and I, for one, am
“Impala is her name?” The omega smiles, just a quirk of the corner of his mouth. “Fitting, I think, to name her after an animal with no master.”
“I don’t-”
“I was asking what you want to do for lunch? We didn’t pack anything,” Dean says, still smiling. “I’ll go get whatever it is you two want, I just gotta know what that is.”
Cas was in an impossible situation even before Michael laid a hand on Claire.
Claire darts over to where Dean was just folding the dish towel again to put it away. She throws her little arms around his legs, her splint bumping him just this side of painfully, and stares up at him imploringly.
“Claire, go play outside for a bit, please.”
Only long practice at hiding his reactions from his mother (something Naomi absolutely despises, which is at least half of why he bothers) keeps Castiel from stiffening in surprise. Instead, after a beat, he hums thoughtfully.
His noble, painful, self-sacrificing thoughts are interrupted by Dean’s confused, plaintive voice.
Cas looks like shit. The left side of his face is one giant bruise. His lip is split and still bleeding slowly. His shirt is dirty and torn, and one of the knees in his slacks is ripped open from seam to seam, almost an imitation of Dean’s jeans.
So he’s taken quite by surprise when, instead of pressing his back into Dean’s chest as he’s done every time they’ve slept side by side, Cas’ front is pressed to Dean, and he’s looking up at him with a mixture of determination and trepidation that has Dean’s thoughts scattering immediately.
Castiel stops, only a few steps from the door. He doesn’t turn around, he just freezes. “Yes?”
Tangy, like oranges!”
“She turned me instantly, drained me there on my knees and forced me to drink her blood. As I lay on the ground, trying to grapple with the new input of every sense I had, I was forced to watch, with enhanced hearing, sight, and smell, as she turned my sister into a vampire, too. My weakness had broken Anna, and she agreed so easily after that.”
something to him, I believe.”
Castiel smiles a bit, rueful but not apologetic. “It’s almost time for supper, anyway. Are you hungry? I’ve made a stew, I think you should be able to stomach a small bowl of it if you feel up to it.”
“Yeah,” he said, cutting Cas off mid-sentence. “Let’s do it.”
“Hiya,” Dean says softly.
“Just like that, huh?” Dean asks, a smirk starting at the very corner of his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s just that, well, Cas smells so
Dean leans forward to rest his head on their clasped hands. “Goddammit,” he rasps. “Cas, I don’t know what to do.”
Castiel must be
But it’s
“Don’t do this,” she says, soft and cajoling. “James, don’t do this. Join me. You know I’m right.”
But when her apartment got broken into, she called Mr. W first. He came at once, angry and protective and loud. He called a few more people and they packed up everything she owned that very night, stored her boxes in Mr. W and Mr. N’s garage, and Charlie stayed with them until Mr. W helped her find a better apartment in a safer neighborhood.
Dean opens his mouth to reply, but his throat seizes around dryness and he goes into a coughing fit, instead. The omega sets the tray down and pours water into the cup before hurrying to sit next to Dean on the bed. Very gently he cups the back of Dean’s head and presses the cup to his lips, urging him to drink slowly. The water is cold, soothing, and Dean drinks all of it gratefully. The omega quickly pours another cup without prompting and helps Dean drink that, too.
Castiel notices the way Dean’s arm stiffens around his shoulders, though his voice remains light. “They’d be crazy not to bump you to the top, kiddo.”
Castiel can feel Dean still staring at him, eyes boring holes in the side of his face, but he resolutely keeps his gaze on Sam until Dean sighs a little and looks away, too.
personality, that one, but she’s been behaving quite well. Your tack and saddle has also been cleaned properly, and is out in the barn for you.” He stands and goes to the vanity, removes the cover from the dish there, and brings back a bowl of broth and a spoon. He sits and looks Dean in the eye again.
John stands, too, seemingly letting it sink in how serious Dean is. “Dean, son, think about this for a second, now. We can bring the board around if you’re not willing to get a divorce, it will just take-”
"Love you," Dean rasps softly, almost a secret in the nonexistent space between them.
to do?”
Dean scoffs from his place at the table. “That’s ridiculous!”
She’s wearing a simple, worn dress in a pretty dark green. It’s clearly handsewn, but well-done and clean. Her pale hair is done neatly in two braids that fall well past her little shoulders. She’s a pretty pup, and she’ll be quite beautiful when she grows into her own, he thinks.
- Let's all pretend it hasn't been two solid months, yeah?
because he clenches around Dean, sending his self-control and his thoughts and possibly his soul all to hell.
“Sure am, pup,” Dean says, his voice rough with the wild ride of emotions he’s been on in the last hour.

“Well, let’s fight about it!”
the one who’s really vulnerable here. He’s essentially an invalid right now. He can barely move to get to the chamber pot much less to harm anyone. He’s as weak as a newborn kitten, for the sake of the gods! Cas has to help him
On Thanksgiving every year she ends up on the floor with the dogs piled around her. She buys stocking stuffers for all of their stockings at Christmas. Last year she borrowed Chupacabra to be a dwarf to her Bilbo for Halloween when she, Jo, and Kevin went in a Hobbit-themed group to a party.
Cas rolls his eyes. “The test hardly took you forty minutes.”
Castiel doesn’t talk about them, though. Dean doesn’t know if the omega knows that they’re visible, but Dean also gets the feeling that not much gets by Cas. He doesn’t
Cas assumes that she thought she’d be around to re-up the contract herself.
“Dean, please,” Cas’ chest is tight with apprehension, and he knows he’s breathing too fast. “I’m the same person you knew this morning. I haven’t changed at all.”
As the bullet slams into Dean Winchester’s upper thigh, making him cry out and Impala whinny and huff in alarm even as she continues her dead gallop, he can’t help but think
“So pretty for me, Cas,” Dean whispers.
“That’s… Actually not that bad of an idea.”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “Regardless. Naomi was, and is still, apparently, quite unbalanced. The First is a fairy tale that vampires tell one another to assure themselves that we had a purpose, that we weren’t just created to be… Evil. To be predators. I don’t know why she’s still searching for the First, or why she ever started to, but she’s not in her right mind.”
Dean hates hiring, but he loves Cas more. He’ll just cover the bar shifts until they find someone.
Cas doesn’t believe that off-leash dog parks are safe, and Dean agrees, so they end up going to a pretty popular walking trail. The day is brisk but sunny, the feeling of spring finally waking up the world around them. The dogs all walk easily side-by-side, and Dean holds Cas’ hand because he knows Cas likes it as they walk.
Strangely enough, it’s this thought that allows Castiel to move forward. With each moment, each step that brings him closer to Naomi, a feeling grows in his chest. His back straightens, his shoulders tilt back in defiance, and his chin comes up.
She obeys, and Mr. W’s eyebrows go up when she carefully shuts the door behind her. She sits in the threadbare chair in front of the big desk, nervous but determined.
It’s a tone of voice, hard and loud as a gunshot, that has always made Dean back down. He’s bent his neck and submitted more than once, every time, really, except for that brief period of rebellion as a teenager. He wonders if Cas would have liked him if they’d met then. How different would he be now?
take his eyes off of Zeke. Everything happening is so surreal, he feels as if he’s on the other side of a thick-walled bubble, witness to these events but not an active participant.
“That’s right, sweetheart, come for me, that’s it.”
Dean has never expected anything like that for himself. He’s seen too many other marriages rot from the inside and fall apart. He doesn’t think the all-encompassing adoration his parents had for one another is in the cards for him.
(And isn’t
"I'm sorry," he says gravely, trying to put as much sincerity as he can into the words, "that that awful person lied to you about how beautiful and brilliant you are."
Okay, what can we do? Can your father help? No, I don’t know why I asked, he’s probably part of the problem. That’s okay, we can do it ourselves! This is nonsense. Oh!” He snaps his fingers behind Dean’s back. “We can start a letter-writing campaign! Donna writes the
but I-”
Cas just holds onto Dean’s hand and waits.
It’s only a day or two before Dean can stand and walk on his own. Cas scolds him if he tries to do more than walk around in his room (“You had a severe infection, Dean, you must let yourself rest.”) and Dean tries not to enjoy it too obviously. From the baleful look Cas gives him, he misses by a mile.
The pup chews on her lip. “I suppose if I was helping you, it wouldn’t be so bad.”
Dean thinks for a beat, then shrugs. “Point.” He examines his younger brother with a frown. “Coffee?”
Now, however, it appears that the gloves have come off.
He pulls himself back with an effort. Cas looks flushed and sated, looking up at Dean through heavily lidded eyes with a soft smile on his face and making no effort to move at all. Dean is helpless to do anything but lean down to nuzzle at him, scentmarking him even more and kissing all across his cheeks, the bridge of his nose, and finally down this mouth.
- "You're hot, then you're cold, you're yes, then you're no..." These boys, I swear.
Mary recognizes him, though.
Cas frowns harder. “I don’t?”
Almost best of all, this will be the perfect way to stick it to his dad
“Nah, I’m sure it’ll be fine.”
“I- Wh-What?”
As such, he manages to not fall completely off of the king-size bed they share when Dean bucks him off, but it’s a near thing. Instead, he rolls to his back and watches hungrily as Dean turns and knee-walks over until he’s straddling Cas’ hips.
if Dean were a different kind of alpha himself.
“I don’t mind and I’m feeling quite up to the task,” Dean says, cheerful in his victory. “If you’ll just help me outside I can get started.”
far away. Across town, perhaps, but certainly no more than a thirty-minute round trip.
Dean groans and settles back on the pillows. The coughing exhausted him, and it’s becoming a struggle to keep his eyes open. His chest aches, and the way he hunched over to cough set his leg to throbbing again.
- Don't worry, the cover art is only going to be on this first chapter. I'm way too lazy to do all of that hyperlink bullshit for more than one chapter.

“Castiel.”
Dean’s heart gives a heavy, painful thump, but he can’t dwell on how much it affects him that this sweet pup has been so hurt. He probably needs claire’s help even more than he wants to pretend or admit, and he’ll need to recruit her fast if he doesn’t want her running off to share her suspicion with her father.
And then there’s Cas and Dean.
Cas smiles warmly. “Thank you, Gabe.”
I do, you big idiot, I can’t-”
Lips slapping against his own stop his fast words, and he manages to catch Dean’s hips in his hands when Dean shoves him back against the van and kisses the hell out of him. It takes him a beat, but Cas manages to catch up and kiss back, clutching Dean closer.
He wants to watch Sammy grown up, he wants to harass Bobby. He wants to be Charlie’s best man at her lesbian wedding. He wants to watch Ash take over the world.
“I just don’t think you’re a good fit, Nick. I have your last paycheck here, tonight was your last night with us.”

today.”
“Like I said, you won’t be walking away with nothing.”
Dean, who worries about Castiel. Who makes sure he eats and rests. Who has taught him how to have fun for the sake of fun, be it watching movies or making out in a hallway like teenagers about to be caught by their parents. Dean, who loves his brother and surrogate father fiercely, who protects the little family they’ve created staunchly and without apology. Dean, who came into Castiel’s rigid, structured world, with tears in his eyes for his mother’s doormat and a quip on his tongue for the dangerous being in his living room.
“Indeed. She kicked him out, and since he was planning to take a semester off to work and save up, he has nowhere to live until he goes back to school,” Cas says as he finishes taping the gauze. He places a gentle kiss on the back of Dean’s hand and raises his eyes to Dean’s.
“Cas, babe, are you okay?”
“Dean! Did you hear that? Papa’s going to read us a
when he has Cas next to him. Castiel, second eldest Novak son, certified genius, master manipulator, so goddamn pretty it’s hard to look at him directly? Yeah, walking down the halls with his arm around Cas makes Dean feel like a king.
Cas stumbles into the kitchen in the early morning, rubbing his eyes and frowning. Dean has learned that despite the early hours he’s kept for so long, Castiel
His protest is cut off when Cas, who obviously prepped himself already, sinks down onto him all at once The way the hot clench of Cas’ body engulfs him immediately overwhelms his ability to speak.
Dean has never felt like this before. This intense connection, need bordering on obsession, this belongs only to Cas.
As he is in everything, Dean has been remarkable through his adjustment to this faux-afterlife. He’s already able to be around humans without posing a threat, but when they feed on one another during sex, he sometimes loses himself.
the board while also giving them exactly what they want.
Cas blinks. “Well, of course I have a razor, but I… Ah…” His cheeks dust pink again. Dean tries not to be enchanted. “Well, I-
When he presents the question to Cas, Cas gives him a gentle smile. “Have you, though? Dean, you take such good care of everyone around us, you always have. I will support you regardless of what you decide as far as Adam goes, but let’s not lie to ourselves, now.”
“Uh… Yeah?”
This, however, is unacceptable.
“I failed.
He doesn’t get the first word out before she moves, and then they’re fighting. She’s been doing it longer, and probably more recently, but Castiel is stronger, faster, and has the gift of leverage. They fight like a dance, moving too fast for eyes to properly take in, and Castiel loses himself in it again.
Gabriel’s voice has them pulling away from one another, but not all the way. Cas keeps his arms around Dean when they both turn to glare at the shorter vampire.
“They’re not giving me the job.”
Dean shrugs. “Dunno. We’ll handle it either way. Worst case scenario? He knows what’s going on and he likes it, is actively encouraging it. That would be bad.”
“I just thought… Well, you’re a bartender, and I know how to run a restaurant, and it’s already pretty much set up as a bar. I was thinking how nice it would be to have something of our own.” He takes a deep breath. “And you could bring The Colonel in and he could hang out in the office, and eventually, we’d hire a few people, and there’s room for a dance floor in there, and I know you have ideas at the bar that they’re not letting you utilize, and I-”
Worst of all? Dean feels the same.
Dean, however, was unwilling to let Sam go alone when he got accepted to Stanford,
Dean is trying to figure out what to say when Claire does it for him.
After years of getting to sleep with his lovely Dean, Cas knows his partner inside and out. He knows how far to push Dean and how far he’ll push back. So he also knows how Dean will react to being provoked.
“I don’t… Know?”
“I think it’s the routine,” he says, “the rhythm.”
"And I, you."
“Of course, Dean.”
Cas looks him dead in the eye. “Azazel and his shitty little gang. Talley did most of the damage.” He indicates the eye he’s covered with the ice pack again.
“You have
Adam’s eyes widen a little again, Charlie laughs, Cas sighs, and Dean thinks they might be all right.
“Goddamn,” he says, breathy and excited and maybe a bit overwhelmed. “That was quite a speech, Cas.”
“He made you lie, Castiel,” Zeke says again, pained, agonized, really. “Just because you weren’t ready to be out was no reason for him to do that. And then he
Without turning, Cas leans back, resting against Dean’s chest. Dean holds him close and presses a gentle kiss to his shoulder.
He’s sure his scent is just as wild as Cas’ is before (thankfully) rationality reasserts itself. Cas is not his omega, or his to provide anything for.
“So, what’s the deal with Dean and Castiel?”
He wishes he could wake up next to Cas every morning (afternoon), but someone has to be there to meet the delivery guy, Garth. It’s the kind of thing that they can probably trust one of their employees with, but Cas thinks it’s unfair to expect that much of them. Especially when the truck gets there at ten in the morning and the club doesn’t open until seven at night.
Tension tightens the small of Dean’s back, making him sit up straighter. “What can I do for you?”
Dean can barely hear his brother over the sound of the air whipping past them as they race past the last few buildings on the main street of whatever two-horse town they stopped at (he can’t even remember the name of the place), but he nods in the affirmative. He can’t keep his lip from rising in a snarl as the pain from his left leg starts to throb in earnest.
He falls asleep listening to Cas’ and The Colonel’s slow, gentle breathing, just like he does every night, and feels luckier for it every time.
It takes them both a very long time to fall asleep, but the new silence is easy, comfortable. Cas runs fingers through the silky hair at the base of Dean’s skull, and Dean occasionally turns his head to brush a kiss against Cas’ chest.
“In many ways, my life with Naomi was exceptionally privileged. I had stellar tutors, excellent food, I was allowed to bathe once a week. We were frequent guests at highly sought-after soirees and balls. I was dressed in fine silks, linens, and wools. I had my own books, my own room, even my own horse.
“Dean,” Cas says softly, “I love you.”
The meal passes in an almost comfortable silence. Castiel seems to be caught up in his thoughts, somewhere between confused and suspicious (like father, like daughter, really). He hums in surprise at his first bite, and Dean ducks his head to hide his smile.
- Cas just blushes this whole damn chapter. I'm trash and I have no regrets.
Claire’s eyes are as wide as dinner plates the next morning.
fingers out of Cas. He nuzzles Cas face, besotted with the way that, even when Cas is irate with him, he still presses into each touch and wraps his arms around Dean’s neck to keep him close.
Which is how she finds herself knocking on the office door when she knows Mr. N is out front and it’s just Mr. W in there.
“Cas?” he whispers, his voice tight with nerves.
Dean leans close enough that his lips just brush the shell of Cas’ ear.
Dean has to fall back on the training he got from his mother and father to heed Cas’ advice, but heed it he does. Any time he hears Cas’ name spoken loud enough for him to hear on horseback, he cocks an eyebrow but doesn’t make more of a fuss than that. He ignores the muttered accusations he hears and rides straight down the main road like he owns the whole damn town.
So instead, Dean smirks. “Hey, Cas?”
Dean shrugs, apparently all right with this. “Startin’ to look like he really is the First.”
“But they’ve heard of you,” Castiel says. “They think you’re the First, and they want you to lead this new world.”
Cas smiles at the gruff woman. “Thank you, Jody.”
“Cas, I told you that Sam and I did a lot of travelling. That much was true, but I… I’m not a farmhand or a salesman. I’m…
At that point, Cas had been playing it pretty cool. This proof that what they had between them was just as intense for him as it was for Dean?
The omega raises a dark eyebrow in doubt, but he places the cup back on the tray before coming back to sit next to Dean on the bed.
“You know that Dean is our alpha, right?” Cas asks, voice low in Claire’s ear. Dean feels his heart skip a beat at that, then again at the way Claire nods without hesitation.
“What would you do if it were you, Dad?”
The room blurs around him with the speed he uses to attack Uriel. His prey is already tied down, hardly even a challenge, but it matters little. The beast inside Castiel’s chest, the one he keeps on such a tight, short leash, is roaring for vengeance, for blood. It does not matter that Uriel is at a disadvantage, because Castiel would kill him anyway.
kernel of doubt in Castiel’s heart, but Dean’s words banish it completely.
Dean raises his voice at his father for the first time since he turned eighteen.
“Yeah, you were kinda flailing around,” Dean says with a teasing smile as he climbs off of Castiel and lies back down at his side, head propped up on his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel pulls one of the chairs from across the desk around so he’s sitting next to Dean. As he’s pulling the first aid kit from the bottom drawer of the desk, The Colonel goes to flop onto his bed gracelessly in the corner.
“What about now?” he snarls in Dean’s ear. He doesn’t give him a chance to answer before he pulls his fingers out and savagely thrusts them back in. He angles them so he’s brushing against Dean’s prostate.
It’s immediately overwhelming, and he almost involuntarily takes a step back and glances at Gabe, who has also stopped and is making a face.
Zeke corrects with a frown, and Cas finds himself too numb to argue, “which I, of course, regret, but you weren’t where you were supposed to be.”
Amy likes mixed drinks, but she has a special fondness for tequila sunrises.

Never one to turn away from trouble, Dean grows bold. He limps forward and takes Cas’ hand in his. It’s rough with callouses and there’s still dirt from the garden around his nailbeds, nothing like the omegas Dean has met in the city. He finds he quite likes the difference.
While they were in training, Uriel was good, but Castiel was better. It satisfies something deep within in that he is

Dean feels like the lowest type of snake as he settles uneasily back in the bed.
“You ever make out in a dark corner with someone your parents don’t approve of?”
“All right. I’ll come by later tonight, yeah?”
“Are the two of you completely devoid of shame?”
Mr. Alastair Rack, the biology teacher who to all appearances despises children, has taken a vicious delight in singling Dean out all year. He’s gone out of his way to tear Dean down, to belittle or demean him in any way possible. Cas was out for blood immediately, wanted him fired, but Dean insisted he stand down, that it wasn’t worth it. Castiel honored those wishes, albeit quite begrudgingly.
It only takes a few thrusts before Cas is coming with a wail. Dean watches, rapt and adoring, his own orgasm almost secondary to the way Cas’ chest and belly become flush with pleasure.
More than I’ve already obligated you, that is. So, listen you can… And the contract, it’s secure, you’re good, Gabe raked Sam over the coals with it, the kid’s got a lot to learn and Gabe’s a shark, and so Heaven’s Light will be safe no matter what, and-”
Understanding finally dawns. Castiel puts his book aside and scoots down the bed until he’s sitting in front of Dean, his knees on either side of his boy’s legs. He rests his hands on Dean’s slim hips and stares up fondly at him.
Once he’s signed in and down one of the hallways leading to the patients’ quarters, he steps to the side to try to organize his thoughts. His senses are more than capable of leading him, but there’s so
As a teenager, resentful of the expectations put on his young shoulders, Dean had turned to petty crime. Small stuff, shoplifting from convenience stores and getting into fights. He’d gotten caught, got some therapy, did his community service, and put it behind him.
The ghost of a smile touches his lips, and Castiel feels marginally better. “Together, then, dearheart.”
That, however, is a conversation for a time when Cas’ thick scent isn’t coating Dean’s nose and throat, when Dean isn’t hard enough to pound nails, and when Cas’ mouth isn’t begging to be ravaged as much as the rest of him.
Before he can do much more than wonder, the bedroom door opens.
As soon as Cas is close enough, Dean takes one of his hands and wraps those long, elegant fingers around the steaming mug he poured as soon as he heard Cas shuffling around. To his amusement, Cas doesn’t even properly open his eyes, just stands too close for propriety and slurps down the first half of the cup.

Like a miracle given form, Anna appears next to her, becoming the second person making Charlie jump and squeak in a ten-minute timespan. Anna seems unperturbed.
Anna is barely a year younger than them, but that’s not what has Cas frowning.
Dean’s breath catches when bright blue eyes meet his. The man is tall and lean, his skin tanned and smooth-looking. He’s dressed simply in dark green breeches, a white shirt, and worn leather boots. There’s the shadow of a beard along his jaw and his dark hair is untamed. His lips are soft and almost made for kissing. A light, sweet scent marks the man who saved Dean as an omega.
Once they drop Charlie off that night, he turns to Dean from the passenger seat of the Impala.
too?”
“Cas, sweetheart?”
“Papa?”
Cas positively
“Please, call me Mary.”
Time, quite simply put, grinds to a halt.
“What if,” Dean says, holding his hands up in surrender when Cas scowls, “I take the bed until my leg is healed? I’ll move out to the living room and you can have your bedroom back. I’ll not be a guest then, will I? Once I’m helping out more? Around the farm?” He asks quickly when Cas opens his mouth to argue.
“Into what?” Dean asks. Castiel doesn’t bother, he already knows.
Cas frowns down at the cotton swab he’s using to clean Dean’s wound. “There is no wrong or right way to handle this situation, Dean.”
The post office worker, at least, is polite enough to his face. A mild-mannered beta, the man’s eyes are knowing when he posts the letter, but he doesn’t say anything offensive or cruel outright.
The idea certainly has appeal. He’d be his own boss, he’d get to be in the thick of things instead of behind a desk all day. He can see a vague outline of it in his mind’s eye. Dark blue jumpsuits, a tiny breakroom in the back. Anna, in a t-shirt with the shop’s logo on it instead of a blouse, answering phones and taking no shit from asshole customers.
Castiel thinks, belatedly dropping his grisly trophy to the ground,
With that thought, the sudden awareness of who he is, what's he becoming, and where he is comes flooding back to him.
She tilts her head at him. “Papa says not to tell my name to strangers.”
Cas’ face does some complicated things that Dean has trouble figuring out before dropping into resignation.
Cas stiffens minutely, but doesn’t pull away or speak. Dean takes that as permission to continue.

would quail in the face of it.
His legs are spread wide, and Dean has two lubed fingers gently rubbing against his prostate. It’s making Castiel shudder and see stars as he fights the urge to thrust, either up or down, he’s not picky.
His handsome face is flushed and sweaty. His hair lies flat in some places and sticks up wildly in others. His green eyes are glazed and bright with fever, but he manages a shaky smile for Castiel. Cas’ heart squeezes in his chest and he brushes his fingers through Dean’s hair again. Dean has taken some heavy-duty medication given to him by an in-home nurse who came by, so he's rather incoherent. Even high, sick, and out of his mind, though, he’s the most lovely thing Castiel has ever seen.
“Whatever, jerk.”
about him, anyway, and Zeke isn’t here to listen to anything he has to say. His stomach turns when he wonders what Zeke has done to Meg to come here, because she surely would have come looking by now if she was able to.
“Hey,” Dean says softly, bringing Cas out of his study of the boy. “You all right, Cas?”
“Did it help?”
“If you have any questions,” Castiel says, “I would, of course, be happy to answer them. Or any proposed changes! The HLSC has given me full authority to sign off on any alterations to this contract. Or any concerns you’d like to hash out.”
Castiel has been saying the same thing for years. Somehow, long enough into their relationship that it was strange but early enough that Dean was still human at the time, Charlie found out that Dean had never expressed his exact sentiments aloud to Castiel. Once she knew, she was like a dog with a bone. She somehow knew that it bothered Castiel, even just the slightest bit, and had been running a campaign to get Castiel to confront Dean about it.
“Dean, I would, in every aspect, like to protect you. If I had my way, you would never face a moment of doubt or danger again. Unfortunately, that’s not the world we live in, and I cannot possibly protect you from everything.
Gabe was a lawyer in the not so distant past, and it’s kind of him to reassure Cas like this. He also knows Cas better than anyone else on Earth, so he probably knows how dreadfully

Cas is stiff and formal, especially if you don’t know him as she does. His impeccable manners hide a sweet, kind soul that Anna adores, even if he has a few of his own demons, too. He says his people skills were too rusty before he and Dean were together, that he had too hard a time connecting to people, so he just never put forth the effort.
Cas’ head is spinning with the hypocrisy and lack of accountability in that sentence, but he hardly knows how he’s standing, he definitely doesn’t have the ability to argue right now.
Joshua is even more lifeless than he was before the sort of afterlife vampires live in. His skin, so dark in life, is strangely pale and waxy in the moonlight. He’s wearing work jeans and a dark shirt with a vest over it, the same clothes he’s been wearing for centuries. His heavy boots have dried mud on them, as do his hands.
(See the end of the chapter for
That evening, after an afternoon of Dean following him around meekly and looking lost and confused, Cas sends Benny and Jack on their way, takes him home, and makes a simple dinner of grilled cheese and tomato soup. Dean’s still subdued after he changes out of his suit and meets Cas in the living room.
John holds up a placating hand. “I know, you’re past all that now. And I’ve done my best to reassure the board that you’ve changed, but they’re not… Convinced,” he finishes lamely.
gratitude.
“What is this?” she asks, her voice filled with wonder.
That night, while Cas is gently rubbing salve on Dean’s wounded leg with hands that somehow manage to be calloused and soft at the same time, Dean can’t hold his tongue any longer.
The omega takes an uncertain beat to answer. “... Yes, and I save the pelts for trade, too. The rabbits, I mean.”
At the end of the day, he helps Cas close up the shop, collect Colonel, stop by the back to make the nightly deposit, and then go
Eventually, the students are released and they start to come down the steps at the side of the stage to meet their families. Cas is one of the first down, and Dean shamelessly hops over the first row of chairs so he can get to Cas before Naomi does.
“... Goddamn, Cas.” The response is breathy.
Not to mention the mind-blowing, spine-melting blowjob Cas used to show his
Cas is having a conversation with Charlie sitting across the booth from them while Dean returns from the counter and slides into the seat next to him, slinging his arm across the back. When Dean places a milkshake in front of Cas, he expects the flat look that he gets. It’s a vanilla shake in a tall glass, with two cherries resting on a mountain of whipped cream and two straws poking out from the top.
Time goes haywire, soupy and sticky, and Dean only knows
“It was sweet, so I didn’t say anything,” Zeke goes on. “But it was hard, believe you me. And
“I know-” he croaks. He swallows hard and tries again. “I know who ‘she’ is.”
“So I’ll stay in the chair.”
“I do,” he rasps. “I promise, pup. Nothing’s going to happen to you or your papa as long as I’m around, and I plan to be around for a long, long time.”
Castiel is still tense, nervous, and doing a garbage job of hiding it. Dean is hopelessly endeared.
Since Joshua’s murder, however, their fervor has returned tenfold. Castiel and Dean are rarely far from research of any kind, and Balthazar is in the field, tracking down leads and following any suspected movement. Gabriel keeps them as coordinated and fed as possible. Sam and Charlie help as much as they can, but they have school and work, so their available time is limited.

Despite his fear, Cas keeps his gaze steady and his voice hard. “I won’t date someone who isn’t planning on graduating, Dean.”
Before he can move away, she surges up toward him and throws her arms around his neck. Her splint hits him on the back of the head, but he barely notices because she also presses a wet, clumsy kiss to his cheek.
He burns for Cas. All of the shady, bad shit he’s done, he would do again for Cas in a blink. He would level cities for Cas, destroy people and demolish buildings. He wouldn’t betray Sam for Cas, but at this point (and he’ll never tell
He kisses Cas again. “I love you,” he whispers.
He never got to meet her, but his father spoke fondly of her. Of course, Joshua spoke fondly of most everyone he met, so that maybe wasn’t indicative of much. The contract she put together, however,
Dean finds a kind of peace in the next several days that he’s rarely known before, and never for as long.
-  Why is Michael the bad guy in so many of my fics? I might have some unresolved issues.
Dean has seen all of the ugliness that lives in Castiel’s mind, and he has met it every time with kindness and warmth.
“She will lead us into darkness, and her followers will walk the earth without fear.”
Cas rolls his eyes, but to Dean’s delight, he doesn’t move away when Dean crowds into his space. Cas just tilts his head back and smiles.”
“Wake up,” Cas hisses. “The chemistry test is tomorrow and we both know you need to study.”
“Dude. You’re not the one who’s about to
Castiel sighs. “... No, but he doesn’t need to.”
Bartholomew and Naomi married shortly after graduation, and Bartholomew started preaching shortly after that. They became quickly (and quietly) rather influential (and absolutely shamefully wealthy).
“Mrs. Novak,” he says politely, looking at the printed program in his hand instead of her.
Like Cas, he doesn’t know they became
at the thought of marking his omega in this way, and it prolongs his orgasm until he’s shuddering and gasping into Cas’ neck.
A few days later, they’re sitting in Dean’s bedroom on his bed, studying for a physics test coming up later in the week. Dean likes this, he likes the way Cas’ pressed, snazzy slacks look alongside his own worn, torn up jeans.
and he starts wrapping, too. “What’s the story there?”
“Why?”
you guys: "Haha! Michael is totally under the roses! Teehee!"
you, and I lost my temper again. I don’t feel bad about that one, though.”
The lights, the crowds, the buzzing, electric energy about the place. Castiel has put forth an incredible amount of effort to put away his own sin, to force himself to be better, to make better choices. For someone like him to be in a place that so openly and brazenly accepts sin seems… Blasphemous, almost.
take me. I’m already yours.”
Or the way he sees red when that
“Of course, my apologies, ma’am.”
“But what if I want it to hurt?”
“Sure thing, Cas,” he says easily. “Stick it in the cart.”
Castiel doesn’t smile back. “She’s my whole world.”
“He didn’t even have a weapon,” Cas says, a bit shaken.
The only people who would be calling Cas are in this room. The only people who know this phone number at all, with precisely two exceptions, are in this room.
After the night before, everything that happened with Uriel, Castiel’s confession, and Dean’s casual acceptance of what Castiel considers to be his most heinous acts, it’s incredible to Castiel that everything seems to be the same as it was. The weather, however, cannot affect his buoyed spirits. If they weren’t still searching for the Lightbringers, and now Naomi, he’d be floating on air.
Claire giggles and writhes in happiness. She cuddles close and pulls Cas with her. She doesn’t stop pulling and pushing them to her whim until she’s satisfied, which leaves all of them hopelessly tangled up in blankets and one another.
Before he can think much more on it, Dean is tugging him around to look at him properly. The frown doesn’t mar his handsome features, but makes them more intense, serious, masculine.
Slowly, Adam smiles a little. “Yeah, yeah. That sounds good.”
Everyone here is a stick in the mud.” He glares around at all of them. “If no one’s going to mention how wonderful I look today, will you at least tell me if we’ve made any progress as far as Crazies ‘R’ Us?”
Uriel,” Castiel insists, hoping against hope to get through to this vampire who was once a brother in arms. “Uriel, this is crazy. The ravings of a madwoman. Naomi has always been just this side of insane. How could you
Finally, unexpected but a blessing, Claire’s dark, watchful mood dissipates.
Dean gives a blatant, proprietary once-over that sets Cas’ blood on fire. “Yeah?”
Castiel snorts, but he’s unsurprised by Gabriel’s enthusiasm.
It’s true, and Castiel feels a stab of guilt. It’s not Gabriel’s fault that he’s been so very tired lately, so disenchanted with his entire existence. Gabriel has never felt that way - Gabriel thinks every day is a new chance for mischief and mayhem, both things that fuel him.
“My ass,” Dean grumbles. “Look, I know it, and so does everyone who matters. Just because you’re weird doesn’t mean anything.” He reaches across the bench seat to tangle their fingers together. “You’re still the best person I know, baby, and the best thing that ever happened to me. No matter what anyone says.”
He has no idea how long they’ve been here. He’s sitting on a bed, leaning back against Cas. They’re not in his bed, he doesn’t think so, anyway. He doesn’t remember. They went somewhere for this, somewhere safe, but the knowledge is slipping away with his lifeblood. The only thing he knows for sure know is Cas, Cas’ cold chest behind him, Cas’ strong arms holding him up, Cas’ lips at his neck.
A comfortable silence falls between them as Dean finishes undressing and steps into the hot water. He shudders as the warmth begins to sink into him. He goes down far enough to dunk his head, then leans back, rests his arms along the sides of the tub, and lets his head fall back, too.
The man has extremely dark skin, with dark eyes and hair to match. His hair is cropped close to his head, as it has been since Castiel has known him. He’s wearing a business suit, which is jarring for some reason Castiel can’t seem to put his finger on.
at the door. Cas turns to frown down at the dog, instead.
“My name is Claire,” she says decisively. She drops into what is probably the most adorable curtsy Dean has ever seen. “It’s very nice to meet you, Dean.”
Cas’ thighs cling to Dean’s hips and his fingers are still scrabbling at his back. Dean finds an angle that makes Cas absolutely
“It’s just Claire and I,” he says tightly. He quickly gathers up the mostly-empty dishes and gets up from where he’d sat on the bed. “I’ll come back in at midday, once the garden has been tended,” he says before fleeing the room.
hometown, now.
Dean smiles, but he knows it’s strained. He’s glad Cas is looking down at his pastries. “Well, I got the donuts covered, and I can offer at least eight hours of sleep. Sam and Anna are covering for us, so I can stay with you ‘till morning. I’ll sneak out the window and swing Baby around, make your mom think I’m picking you up for school.”
“Yeah?”
They stay like that for a few moments before Cas gingerly crawls off of Dean and steps off the bed. He gets the rag from the bath and cleans both of them off before unlocking the door and bringing Dean a set of pajamas. Once they’re both dressed, Cas gets back into bed and cuddles close.
“Yeah,” he rasps, smiling so wide his cheeks ache. He nuzzles into the palm of Cas’ hand. “Yeah, that’s all right with me, sweetheart.”
Dean is glowering at him, his green eyes alight with fury. His arms are crossed in faux relaxation, but the muscles in his biceps are bulging with tension.
Castiel smiles. “I believe you are correct on all counts, Ms. Bradbury.”
out on Novak’s farm?” His eyes squint as if trying to see through Dean. Dean has always found this particular habit rather amusing. In his experience, one has never had to go any further than looking at the surface to know if a man is lying.

one out to scrub before Claire wakes up.
Dean smiles and reaches across his desk to shake Nick’s hand. “I think you’ll fit in here just fine.”
Cas wants to strip him bare and ride him on the buffet table.

Dean blinks, but the omega isn’t done yet.
Caucasion
“Shh, alpha, you’re all right. Just lie there and let me take care of you.”
Cas doesn’t look surprised to see him. He’s sitting on one of the raised exam tables, holding an ice pack to one swollen, blackening eye. The other burns with an otherworldly blue intensity as it devours the sight of Dean.
He sits behind Castiel again, and then a warm, damp cloth is tenderly washing away the sweat on his shoulders, neck, and temples. He feels Dean behind him, all warmth and leashed strength, and Castiel leans back against him shamelessly.
As he drifts into a fitful sleep, Dean tries not to think about why he
“There are some… Concerns.”
“There is no requirement to memorize the regulars at the club, Adam, Dean is just being difficult.”
When Dean asked his parents about renting out the big rustic barn and having a few drinks for his birthday party, they agreed after only a cursory explanation. Sure, it’s a little different than what these rich kids are used to, but Dean’s got a plan.
Some of what he’s feeling must be in his voice, because Dean whips around to look him in the eye.
“Don’t you people have
Cas smiles. “Welcome. My name is Castiel, I own The Bunker with Dean. Please, come have a seat while we wait for him to come back.”

Castiel hasn’t taken his eyes off of Gabriel, who he’s sure would have gone quite pale by now were he possessed of any blood that might drain from his face. “She’s a… Terrible creature.”
When he goes downstairs to the kitchen, Dean is already there, along with Sam and Gabriel. Their talking and laughter fade when they see him. He must look as troubled as he feels.
their bosses (surrogate fathers?). Her slim hand is covering her mouth, and her eyes have gone misty with emotion. When Charlie looks over at Benny, he’s looking up at them, too, mouth quirked up at one side in a smirk.
“Dean, the board-”
Cas looks back up at him, notices his pause, and smiles at him.
he thinks. Some vampires are entirely too fond of the way they’re depicted in movies and literature.
if Claire stumbled across the body where she was playing someday, so he wants it
After supper that same night, Dean is sitting on the floor with Claire. She’s playing with her dolls, who are taking over a town full of “bandits and bad alphas,” and he’s sorting laundry. Three neat piles of repair, hemming, and embroidery requests are stacked in front of him. When it’s required of him, he provides voices for Claire’s game, usually for the bandits (but never, he notices, for the group of bad alphas). The sun has almost dropped completely from the sky, and while it’s still swelteringly hot, it’s also serene. It’s been a long time since Dean felt this peaceful.
Once he’s far enough away, he starts to dig. He falls into a rhythm that allows him to ignore his burning muscles and he loses time rapidly. Eventually, he realizes that it’s closer to dusk than afternoon and he’ll have to find hand- and footholds to pull himself out of the hole.
Castiel’s smile is gentle, almost… Sweet. Though the bandage on Dean’s leg is already wrapped, Cas is still stroking over the material slowly, which may or may not be entirely distracting.
from up front. Frowning, Cas leans back to try to see the front of the shop. It appears to be empty.
“Cas, she’s a
“My name is Castiel.”
“Papa!” she says happily, her feet swinging under the table. “We helped!”
Dean’s eyes narrow. “Tomorrow. The plan. Confronting Naomi.”
Sam nods. “I know.”
“Cas, wha-”
“Come now, dearheart, come back to me. That’s it, you’re doing so well, love. Come back to me, Dean.”
They get to the Wilbur D. May Center in just under four hours. The sun has set completely and the parking lot is empty when they get there. Dean pulls them into a space, parks the car, and looks over towards Castiel. His incredible bone structure and long lashes are dramatically highlighted by the bright light of the parking lot lamps and the dark shadow provided by the night.
Dean smiles. Would he give up bacon for Cas? Oh, he’d bitch and moan about it, but yeah. In the end, if Cas wants it, Dean will do it.
But Dean asks for so few things, and he’s still struggling after the biology final debacle. So Cas scowls, but he squeezes Dean’s hand and nods his assent.
And, impossibly,

so when Cas started talking about his lease coming up due, Dean thought nothing of offering the other side of his queen bed. If he had had any reservations, the way Cas’ face lit up and his blue eyes softened would have banished them immediately.
His heart warms, and he gives her an honest smile, the one he saves for her and Dean alone.
There’s literally nothing natural about it.”
Cas smiles, sweet and soft. “I am not without my faults, Dean, but if you still want to be here, still want
Sam’s bickering is cut off by the sharp sound of another gunshot. It goes wide, as far as Dean can tell, but a bad shot still gets lucky once in a while. The bullet in his leg is proof of that.
“You mean… Papa, you mean
“That was lame,” he chides gently.
He thinks.
Dying is a lot colder than Dean Winchester thought it would be. He probably should have expected it, but as his limbs fail and his eyelids grow unbearably heavy, he’s surprised at how cold he is.
he thinks firmly.
He thinks of his father, as he so often does when he’s in a dilemma. Joshua Novak was a strong, steady man who took a chance on a strange, solemn little boy. Joshua had loved Castiel fiercely and without reserve, and Castiel had loved him back the same way. He thinks he would never have gotten out of the system alive if not for Joshua.
good,” Uriel sneers, not missing a beat. “It’s the traitor James.”
They don’t open the shop, but they do end up in Oh, You Betcha for lunch. Donna’s fussing has become so familiar that it’s a balm, a soothing blanket that settles over Dean’s shoulders.
Claire’s tinkling laughter and the sweet flash of relief in Cas’ scent are worth his restraint.
Benny immediately frowns upon laying eyes on Dean. “Y’all right, brother?”
“Bitch.”
(because God bless it, they never fucking
Last night was like a hazy, lovely dream. The cookout, where he somehow found himself slotted in amongst the people of HLSC like a puzzle piece that finally found its place. He was surrounded by good food, good people, and good beer (Meg knows how to brew for sure). Cas was a sweet, warm weight up against his side, under his arm, and for the night Dean was able to pretend it was real - holding Cas, nuzzling at him, pressing gentle kisses to his cheek, and dancing him across the parking lot like Dean wants to spend the rest of his life doing just to make the other man smile.
“Cas, sweetheart,” he says with a smile, “it’s almost nine. The shop opens at eight.”
- Another chapter inspired by
without me!”
Castiel scowls, because he almost made it out, but he stops and turns to look at his friend. “Yes?” he bites out.
Mr. N nods. “Dean is not a practicing Christian anymore, as you well know, but he keeps some of the lessons he was taught. He believes that to be true charity, it must be anonymous. His name is nowhere on the fundraiser, and if it weren’t for the time he has to spend organizing all this, he wouldn’t have told me, either.”
They’re old instincts, of course, but he can’t help but preen a little when he’s able to lay everything out on the table.
Cas frowns. “That’s a bit antiquated, isn’t it?”
Gabe sighs, irritated.
For the most part, Dean has always liked cities. As far as his job went, cities typically meant more marks, more work, and more opportunities for money. Personally, too, he’s never minded being in a crowd. He’s a big man, a handsome one, too. His scent is that of a strong, fertile alpha. He’s never had a problem in crowds or cities.

“It was disturbing how accommodating they wished to be,” Castiel agrees dryly as he puts his suitcase on his side of the bed next to the nightstand. “It makes me even more skeptical that he’s who we’re looking for.”
“We don’t, but I believe she will be expecting us,” Castiel says grimly. The girl in front of him is a vampire, and he would honestly be surprised if she didn’t recognize him.
Hell, he thought he’d at least get to make his own
“Well, I managed to dig the bullet out of your leg and get your fever down. Your clothes have been washed and repaired, although I wasn’t able to do very much for the staining on your breeches, I’m sorry. Your wound looked good this morning when I checked it, but I’ll need to change the bandages again before supper.”
So why, then, does he feel so bad about burdening one wary omega and his pup? Cas and Claire aren’t marks. In fact, something about the idea of anyone taking advantage of the two of them, even
“Hello, Dean.”
Dean leers at him, and Cas’ thoughts derail neatly and with finality. “Wanna make out in the back of Baby? Maybe be even a little late to Calculus?”
“Charlie,” he says, voice tight. Dean is sitting up, right next to him, eyes intent on the side of Castiel’s face. “Do you have something?”
The song switches to a slower, more romantic tune. Castiel wouldn't notice at all, he's watching Balthazar try to wheedle Bela into dancing with him, but Dean squeezes his hand where they're entwined between them below the table.
“You’re welcome to stay here while you recover, though I do believe it will be a while before you’re on your feet again. Your horse, too, can remain, though I daresay she’s more than capable of caring for herself.”
The SUV that brought them here is parked right out front, across several parking spaces. Gabe is leaning against the back of it, not looking at them, his phone pressed to his ear. Though he appears to be engrossed in his phone conversation (Being berated by Kali for recklessness, if Cas’ own ears don’t deceive him), the way his shoulders relax almost unnoticeably betrays his relief.
“... My apologies.”
Finally, Dean comes back to himself, straightens, and crawls off the bed with a soft command to Cas to stay where he is. He does so, and moments later, Dean comes back with a warm washcloth. He cleans both of them of come and lube, presses a gentle kiss to Cas’ hip bone, and tosses the cloth into the hamper.
“I love you, too, Cas.”
“My first memories are of an orphanage in Russia. My name was James. I’ve no way of knowing if the woman who gave birth to me named me, or if the orphanage did it. It’s not a traditional Russian name, so it must have been her. That’s neither here nor there.
Sir, it’s like you said, I’m not even in a
Dean likes Nick, and so does the crew. “It’s nothing.”
Try as he might, Castiel can’t get the idea out of his head.
Dean can’t help the smile that spreads across his face, but he still shimmies a little to get Cas to wake up. Cas groans grumpily and looks up at him.
“Well, a wife has a way of… Setting a man down, smoothing over his rough edges. You’ve put the time in at the job, everyone knows that, but how are you really
Dean leans forward to ruffle Sam’s hair. “Thanks for telling me. I’ll figure it out.”
he thinks.

Dean is his saving grace (as usual). Dean hasn’t stopped making fun of this spectacle since he walked in the door, raised an insolent eyebrow at Naomi, and made a beeline for Cas. He smells good, looks good, and feels good, smiling at Cas’ side with his arm tight around him. He steadies Cas, somehow, makes the sting of disappointment less bitter with his tender touch and sharp words for Cas’ mother.
