Dean looked down, but Sam caught the way his lower lip quivered as he got to his feet. “And it wouldn’t… wouldn’t break anything?”
Dean was on his second beer and considering joining in the pool tournament that was just waiting to have better stakes attached to it when he noticed Crowley sitting on the stool beside him.
Sam was about to leave on a milk run when he opened the door and found the dog, who stayed sitting but stared as though it had been waiting for him.
Countries started blaming each other. Conspiracists blamed aliens. A lot of religious types blamed God.
“Ok, I’ll get to editing then. See, this is why I brought you along. And yeah, because you’re about the only person nearby that I have a number for.”
“Fair.” Getting a good amount on his fingers, Cas dropped the bottle and went back to twisting Dean’s nipples, already finding the smell too much, but looking for one last good reaction.
“Oh… nothing,” Cas managed eventually, on a hiccup. “Only that... I think you might have accidentally saved the world, Dean Winchester.”
“…Yeah.” Dean shrugged again. Maybe it was partly the sickness, but it was different, talking to Dean like this now. All of his usual confident exterior was completely stripped away from him, and suddenly Cas felt like the one who was sure of himself in the room. It was an unusual shift. “It’s cool getting to meet this Dad of the Year now, I just wish he’d turned up a bit sooner, y’know.”
The glare Sam turned on him made Dean finally remember that his brother really was older than him now. Though Dean had never told Sam about what any of Cas’s last words had been, it had been partly because he’d known it wouldn’t surprise him much and his pity would have destroyed what was left of Dean. “Dean. If Cas is here, then Cas wants to talk to you.”
Jack breathed out slowly. “Yeah, I do. Just like I knew that you’d try and make me feel better if I freaked out for a second.”
Feeling merciful, Cas turned away towards the kitchen counter. “It’s not an insult, Dean, you don’t have to throw it back at me.”
“… and you were totally surly-polite about the whole thing. But then he left – and, ok, even I was relieved about that by then – and I just caught you muttering to yourself.” Dean lowered his chin into itself, a sure sign he was about to attempt an impression . ““Fucking finally.”” Starting to laugh at the memory, Dean’s free hand reached up to clasp Cas’s carefully in his own. “I had no idea what a bitch you were!”
But generally Cas had found Dean’s brother to be, as Dean had advertised him to be, a cautious character at all times. He had carefully kept his knowledge of Cas close to his chest. Dean wouldn’t have agreed to go out there with Cas at all until he’d been entirely straight with him from the start. But Sam seemed prone to keeping his own secrets and accepting of others holding closely onto their own.
, and she was finally getting to listen through one of the albums that she’d meant to get around to listening to for months.
“Cas, I don’t wanna push you into something… but she’s right. We’re hot, we’re right here, and we’re both very, very broke.”
Dean wasn’t asleep. Cas hadn’t exactly been hoping he would be, but it was difficult walking up towards him and seeing those purple eyes guiding him in like tiny twin lighthouses. Sam had told him the eyes had dimmed back to their natural colour, but apparently that hadn’t lasted.
“Why do you trust me?” It was something that had been bugging Cas that felt impossible to keep down any longer. “You know I’ve been lying to you since the start – about everything. You know what my brother’s done, what my family’s done. You’ve seen what I am. You know how I -” he swallowed, and stared at the flame. “You know how I hurt Dean.”
After stepping out of the room, still smiling, Ruby stopped at the sight of the big family photo in the hallway. The kids were both a lot smaller whenever this was taken, which made sense. Jess held Jack in her arms and stood tall next to Sam with a smile like sunshine. The woman looked gorgeous, and Ruby imagined that she was probably straight, and naturally maternal and went to the gym when she said she was going to and had a good relationship with her parents. Ruby wished she wasn’t the sort of person who hated the dead woman in the picture on site.
Sam was relieved when his gesturing at the bench they were about to pass by had her following him in sitting down. It was trickier to sign with a dog lead in one hand and he wanted to show off that he’d been practicing.
Cas didn’t sleep, but he’d been starting to doze when Dean gave a cry of delight a few hours into the drive. “Jackpot,” he hissed, causing Cas to blink wearily at him and the open glove compartment.
“I’m charming,” Dean pointed out, flashing Cas a smile and tried to ignore the strange twitching going on with his passenger’s lips in reaction. “And… well he might not, but it feels weird being back in the states and not driving, y’know? Spent half my childhood in a car, carted around the country.”
Michael killed his twin in almost exactly the same manner. The device fell back to the basement floor with a hard thud, and was left to glow dimly there.
Cas looked up and for a moment Dean felt like he didn’t know him at all. Panic gripped him, and he forced himself to sit completely still. “Cas?”
“And I was fine with that, I was, I got used to it. But now you’re all with the touching when it’s not supposed to be an intimate situation, and I’ve never been very good at reading people, Dean, and it’s – it’s too much. But in a good way. So, I’m sorry I walked out earlier, you’re, you’re right, there are a lot of things that can and should be said about Antonio Banderas when he was young.”
A Ruby chapter (as the even numbered ones will all be) but with a lot of the Dean details seeping in there
“Hey,” Cas said, unable to stop himself from smiling a little at the sight of Dean, a brightly-jacketed Ray Bradbury book resting on his crossed-over knee, and Cas’s wide-rimmed reading glasses slipping down his freckled nose.
Dean let his head sink back into the pillow behind him. “Didn’t make it. I know.” He’d been too slow, he’d made the wrong call. Rudy always had a problem with his left side vision and Dean should have remembered.
He’d made some sort of excuse, which she’d barely listened to, and the next day he was driving back over to Dean’s – to Ruby,
Dean concentrated on his breathing, concentrated on his grip on the machete in his hands. He wished he knew what had given him the strength to rip limbs off of people and how he was supposed to tap into that.
So maybe he should have guessed or said something. But he’d been having the best time of his life and as far as he’d known then the world wasn’t wired to have monsters running through it. Or, apparently, angels.
“I didn’t know what I felt either. I mean I did. But.” Dean balled his hands into tight fists and resisted the urge to start punching his leg. “I knew I wanted to tell you in Purgatory. But there was never any time. I guess that’s why Heaven looked like that for me. The idea of having just… endless time to just know everyone was okay and have time to figure this crap out – that was nice. But I don’t – I don’t want nice. I just want you.” He felt his mouth dry. “I love you, Cas. Even if you’ve worked out now that it was a mistake, that you don’t want me after all… I’ll still want you. And I know I don’t have forever to get over myself and figure out the best way to do this, but you saved me again, so I have time. You gave me that. And -”
“But your brother doesn’t want to. You want him to leave it and behind, to be safe, almost as much as you want him to track us down. You don’t want to be forgotten.”
Done now officially with his attempt at running, Dean slowed himself down to a quick walk that was rapidly threatening to develop a limp. This was pathetic. He wasn’t even sure why he’d even attempted this other than that you were supposed to do things you never got around to when you were on holiday and… oh yeah, because a hot guy came over and found Dean in the clothes he’d been sleeping in and with no good explanation and for why he was there and he’d wanted to feel
He wasn’t too surprised when Jack wandered back in. He really didn’t need much sleep, and besides, Cas had probably left him with too much of a weight on his shoulders, asking him to keep the existence of his deal with the Empty a secret.
They didn’t kiss, not in that first hour of realising that the other one was still alive, had suffered just like they had, and that didn’t feel wrong. There wasn’t any soundtrack swelling behind them pushing them towards each other. It felt natural to keep apart. Kissing, hugging, no single gesture seemed like it would cover it anymore.
Dean wanted to laugh, but he had to keep going, even if he had to keep looking at his feet to do it. “You said a lot, before you did.”
Sam’s soft smile at that made her want to die a little. “Well you should come around here again, Mary loves teaching people.”
Mildly disgusted with himself, Dean pocketed the blank postcard and wandered out again, letting the tinny echo of Cas’s music guide him back again.
“Why not? You’ve got a literal captive audience here.” He scoffed. “You know I can hear you through the walls anyway.”
Rufus paused and looked away again, as though stung. “He’s eighty-seven. If you told me he was doing good I wouldn’t be believing you.”
Cas had his legs crossed now, and the dog seemed to be considering climbing into his lap. Sam had guessed that it was barely older than a puppy, but despite its age it seemed to carry itself with a weary dignity worthy of an old wizard.
Dean’s grin widened, though it was rattling his how quick Sam was figuring this out. “When is anything we do ever either of those things? Jeez, Sammy, don’t look the gift horse in the mouth.”
angel,” he said, eyes glimmering with that same sad laughter as he continued to stare at Dean as though he’d never seen something so interesting in his life.
“That’s not better!” But Dean could feel the weight of Cas’s despondency reach out for him across the cage. It really was infectious. What
But it was just… true. Dean was always attractive, but he never normally looked like this – like he was completely vulnerable in ways that had nothing to do with how naked he was. Exposed, and revelling in that.
It was like waking from a dream when they eventually emerged out into sunlight – real sunlight, which was brighter and colder than Dean had remembered it. They were still somewhere in the fields of the Midwest by Dean’s estimate, but other than that he had no clues. He could be totally off and be in a different country to Sam and his Dad and he’d never know it.
“I don’t know. Something else. For fun. With your life. Chuck and Amara fucked off, Lucifer’s crammed back in the cage, the British douchebags are all back across the Atlantic… You ever think about doing something else?”
But the truth was that he remembered all of it. He remembered the sinking lurching feeling in his gut the first time the truck ran out of gas. He remembered getting to the end of a day of going hungry and knowing he was going to be hungry tomorrow again. He remembered feeling like a coward when Sam started talking one night about his college girlfriend and Dean didn’t mention anyone he was hoping to find. He remembered passing through towns he could remember driving through and finding nothing alive but feral dogs. And then Bobby going out with his shotgun and announcing they were having a dog’s dinner that night. He remembered getting handy with a liberated sewing kit fast, and never missing the internet so much as he did whenever he came across a berry and wasn’t able to google it.
“It’s not that I’m not going to let you go at all,” Sam said. Dean grunted and continued to stare at the dark road ahead. “I will – I can. It’s just… that was just stupid, Dean. Rowena was right, if we’d been near a hospital even -”
Sighing, Dean turned the in the lock and walked in to find his brother arranging at least fifteen different kinds of beer around three pizza boxes on the table.
There was only one logical way to finish that announcement now, Dean reminded himself. But he still winced when he heard it.
Dean usually enjoyed naming things. But their ugly, slightly listless little pet had lasted three days with them and was still nameless. It was hard to get behind the naming of something you didn’t want around.
And now he’d known he had to come back, because the world needed him. His family needed him, and he’d been able to regain his soul, so that meant something. And because he could. But maybe Cas was right – he hadn’t felt ready to make himself vulnerable in the ways that mattered.
Cas sat very still, but it seemed to Sam as though he was working which direction it would be most beneficial to spring off in.
Shuddering melodramatically, Dean strolled into Cas’s room, like he thought it had twice as much floor space. “Too twee. So what’cha doin’?”
Narrowing his eyes, Cas handed Dean the hanger and moved to sit down again. “I’ve never seen you become such a perfectionist about anything.”
“I think you vastly underestimate how binding these ‘spells’ are. They’re agreements which we all entered into willingly - ”
Deciding that their normal unspoken decorum of distance could definitely be abandoned now, Cas put the back of his hand to Dean’s forehead. “You’re burning up. I think you have a fever, Dean.”
After apparently taking a moment to calculate the likelihood of any of this in his head, the man gave a long sigh. “So, she’s… on holiday?”
But coming into the centre of Dundee in the sleet-to-rain monstrosity still raging outside was still a bit of a heartbreaker.
She shrugged, her lips tugging up in a smile she only looked a little uncomfortable with. “Well, you promised me a dog.” Her mouth split into a much wider grin as she looked down. “And he’s just
“I just think it could be something to, y’know, think about. Pay’s fast, you’re good with a camera, we have absolutely nothing to do for over a fucking week, and your chipmunk cheeks are bound to go down soon…”
Afraid of what he’d see, Sam forced himself to look down. But against all his hopes there was no compassion, no recognition showing on Dean’s face when he sat up a little straighter and told Sam, “I think you should stop trying to save me.”
“I can go – later, maybe,” Anna said hurriedly. “But now that Michael’s – I don’t think I can run this time. I think I need to be here.”
Smirking at him briefly before turning back to the clothes, Dean fiddled with the sleeve of Cas’s shirt, almost like he hadn’t noticed it was something being worn and not hung up. “…I’ve got a plug in a drawer somewhere. Figured that might add some extra levels.”
Dean snorted, but he didn’t, to Cas’s relief, make a big thing about it, and continued to look himself over in the mirror. He was wearing Cas’s waistcoat, and a bow tie that he’d found somewhere, and, for once, had left his hair down, though he seemed to be fussing over that decision.
“Not exactly. Yeah, it’s literally just me and my brother these days – Dad didn’t exactly keep track of family when he hauled us off to the other side of the world. So we’ve never had issues following any fall-outs our second or third cousins might be having or whatever.”
Dean smiled, and bit down on his lip like he wished he wasn’t. Then he turned to the TV. “Nah, I’m too tired for movies anyways. I want dumb TV.”
“I think,” Dean started as he followed him. “I think for me it was when you had to rescue me from Zachariah. When he caught up with me and sent me into the creepy fake future. I was just so relieved you were there like you said you’d be, and that you weren’t future you.”
Defeated, Dean laid his head back down on the couch, shivering slightly under his pile of blanket. “I didn’t sleep last night.”
Thinking about it that way, Dean was starting to feel considerably less pathetic. And then his phone buzzed.
Cas sighed, slumping down towards his laptop. “Well, then he gave me a hug and said he never wanted to push me into something I was uncomfortable with.”
Cas thought, a little frantically as he pulled his duvet cover back over his rapidly tenting pyjama pants. But, weird as this was, he’d been wanting to show Dean what he was watching… And things weren’t supposed to be weird, right? They’d made a deal. No weirdness.
Dean opened his eyes again to better be able to glare at the man sitting next to him. “Think I’m ok. ‘nks.”
some more trigger stuff for mental health not being talked about great and suicidal tendencies and mild gore?
He made it a few miles away from his kill before spotting the fire. His eyesight served him better now than it ever had for him as a human, so he could see it was Cas – warming his hands over a fire like a real human person who was spending a few days camping.
That wasn’t true, Dean thought, like Cas had already walked away from him, like he’d already watched it happen. Why would he stay? Nobody stuck around. His Mom had been raised from the dead just to see him and even she didn’t want to be around him more than a few hours every few months. Cas especially, he wasn’t ever gonna –
“No, he didn’t, he went home early,” Mick confirmed. “Cannot hold his drink any better than he could as a teenager.”
Cas was working when Dean called him. He shouldn’t have been. Technically this was what he’d designated as his day off, but he’d found himself at his piano that morning, hardly aware of what he was doing, but decided that Meg’s new final girl needed a new theme for her moments of triumph amidst the tragedy of her life.
“I’m sure you’ll come to your senses soon, but, until then, you will be kept restrained,” Michael informed Cas as he secured the gag in Cas’s mouth, his voice as steady and helpful as it had been to teach Cas how to tie his shoelaces.
Cas placed the bowl of popcorn down on the coffee table with great ceremony. “This is our last bag of popcorn. Please tell me we’re not honouring it with you attempting again to make me watch the
“Foot fetishists are everywhere,” Dean said knowingly. “People will pay good money to get their hands on a photo of a sexy subject like this.” He narrowed his eyes playfully. “And if you’re one of them, then I’m afraid I’m gonna have to start charging for this session.”
That almost sounded like a Cas Dean knew. Like the arrogant, bored kid back in his college lectures who didn’t even know how sheltered he was.
“New me isn’t sure either. I’ve met a whole bunch of different creatures, but I’ve never seen anything like you. You smell…
“Dean, I’m… I’m sorry about earlier. I behaved -” Cas flapped both his arms up uselessly, feeling oddly like a penguin.
Or, maybe the fact that she was implied that she should be pulling the breaks on whatever it was going on between them. Holiday flings shouldn’t lead to unpacking her feelings about her Grandma. No one usually got those stories out of her. But Sam had just by smiling at her gently and buying her garbage food.
“And I need to get back to…” Cas pulled himself back up straight. He’d promised himself that he wasn’t going to wallow. Plenty of people had it worse. He’d remained blissfully ignorant of his entire family’s updates since his teenage years so he had no idea which of them, if any, he should be worrying about, he had no health issues to worry about personally, and this hadn’t cancelled a wedding or anything on him.
Even in the low light, Cas could see the tears in Dean’s eyes, but he didn’t seem to be aware of them himself, and just let them fall down his face slowly. Not, of course, that he had hands free to wipe them away. “I… I remember.”
“What’s so wrong with the work I’m doing already?” It didn’t matter that Dean had a whole list of answers to that question. What did the people he worked for, the people he was supposed to be protecting think he was doing wrong. “Is Jo gonna be ok?”
After a few moments Cas responded. At first Dean thought he was crying, but eventually he recognised the strangled sounds as laughter. “And you… you’re the eldest brother?”
Moving to flop down on his unmade bed, Cas smacked his forehead. He really was cursed with the most infuriating, ridiculous of roommates.
It was good to have somewhere to be at night now. He suspected that had been more than a little of Dean’s motivation in setting up the room in the first place. Cas didn’t require a room to sleep in, but he knew it had become important to Dean that he understood he had somewhere it was safe to exist, to relax.
Dean picked up the glass filled with pink liquid which had materialised next to him and downed it in one, then continued to clutch at the empty glass, concentrating on not allowing his hands to shake.
“With the other shit that he used to nag about I’d take his side sometimes. But not with this one.” Dean shrugged. “It’s like I said already. We have trouble enough looking after ourselves.”
A hand that had held his face as Dean had stopped fighting the way he was sure he’d once promised he’d never stop.
When Dean saw a limb start slipping through the crack Dean didn’t even think about it as he stood in front of Cas, shielding him from whatever was coming through there.
Sam usually struggled with remembering how to hug people a lot smaller than him, but with Eileen she seemed to fit in his arms like she belonged there. Even if everything else about their interactions had gotten more awkward.
And then the long number for a bill someone uninsured had received for their coronavirus treatment rather rudely appeared on his screen.
Screw self-care. The best she was coming up with for looking after herself was a bath. And she’d already showered that morning – no one needed to be that clean.
The bright light shining out of Cas’s eyes as he descended on them didn’t look like it had ever been human.
Dragging his eyes back to follow Sam, Cas started moving off again in the direction. “Was it wearing shoes?”
“No,” Charlie said with assurance. “They do something to us every time that they let us out of the cages.”
Meg was probably his closest friend, and she’d often teased him about having a thing for a roommate, so he thought she’d have something to say about being proved right. He wasn’t exactly looking for advice, because he wasn’t sure he trusted Meg to give him any, but he was needing to hear at least an indication of what she thought of the whole situation.
So, genius, that Dean had already known, but the guy was also… very, very nice to look at, Dean allowed himself to think again as he desperately forced his legs to keep moving. People like Sam did this for
Dean made a face and considered lying or having to leave this guy on the side of the road out of principle. “Ex-boyfriend getting married.”
Dean’s grip became a little tighter. Then he pulled away enough to look at Cas, fear swimming to surface of his eyes, and leaned in for a kiss.
Shaking his head, Dean waved the remote at Cas in annoyance. “Why are you always so against the suggestion?”
Dean awoke feeling more rested than he could remember being in a long time, as well as unsure of what day it was and even less sure that he cared. He knew it was during
Dean took his time turning around. Just like his long drive, maybe he finally wanted to savour things.
Sam looked around the room. Of those who had joined them inside them inside and not keeping watch elsewhere, this did not seem as unpopular as his own idea had been.
Sam forced himself to stand his ground. This was new territory for him. He’d killed a lot of monsters in his time with Dean out in the wastes. He’d rarely stopped to have a conversation with one, and an awful fight/flight response was threatening to overwhelm him. “You can have the kids. We’re keeping Dean.”
He and Dean might have never had any kind of Conversation about it, but he’d seen what both Dean and Cas looked like without the other. It wasn’t easy to live with. So, when he couldn’t find any trace of either of them, it only made sense to start walking to his brother’s bedroom. When his knock got no answer from Dean, he walked in.
Sam was ready for him to lunge, but he still almost wasn’t quick enough in getting his blade out. They both circled each other, and Sam felt a slight sense of relief. This he could do. He was about to make a feinting move forwards when Benny was distracted by something. The look of horror on the monster’s face told him he should look too.
Cas said nothing, and reached down for the lube left down on the floor. “Letting me do whatever I like to you but constraining my freedom of speech, interesting…” He looked at the bottle in his hands. “Wait,
It took some effort, but Ruby sighed and collapsed back into her chair instead of staying yes. “Not exactly.”
“Come let me love you, let me give my life to you, let me drown in your laughter, let me die in your arms -”
Turning back to smile down at the little girl, Ruby now found that there were two small children looking up at her, and this new one was even smaller, with blonde, curling hair just like the photo. Adorable.
“I can’t believe I never really thought about who funded it all.” Sam shook his head, as though, out of all people, he was mad at himself. “I think I was so happy to be safe I never even thought much about the politics of how the whole thing had started. It’ll be a project moving past things when he’s gone…” Sam seemed to catch himself. “I’m sorry. Were you ever… close?”
Sam didn’t need him. Cas didn’t want him. The only thing that made him feel alive was getting out there into the wild, into the real world where things were simple.
Dean pretended to look chastened, but he was still paying a lot of wide-eyed attention to Cas. It was unnatural, and Cas knew what had to be coming next.
“But if or when you do, at least you’ve got someone to look after you, right?” Anna beamed. “I’m glad you two are getting along. I wouldn’t want to think of either of you being stuck on your own in this.”
“Do you think -” she seemed unusually unsure of what to say next. “Do you think it would have been me you brought back if it wasn’t for…”
Sam felt a little choked up by how easily those words seemed to come out of Dean, an effect only slightly ruined by his rother turning his face up to him. “Am I going mad? Are we just talking to a dog here?”
Sam sighed and clenched his jaw. Dean was clearly going through something, he should probably just leave it alone – But he’d spent too long, too many years, being put through the wringer by his brother by doing too much, by not doing enough.
“Sam, this is for you,” he said, fingers sore from the pressure of holding down the button, of keeping the channel open. “This is it for me. I had a good run. If I have anything it’s yours, alright? And tell -” Dean swallowed and released the button to laugh at himself. Tell who? Tell him what?
Sam felt his face spasm from the effort of holding back the laugh, the sob, that wanted to burst out of him. He didn’t really want to leave – Eileen would probably never forgive him. But the idea of fighting this hard for the last of his family only to let him go for an unknown length of time – and to maybe never see him again –
Obligingly, Cas got to his feet and leaned into the closet next to Dean, inhaling in the scent of his aftershave. He’d never liked this one much, but it was starting to grow on him.
As a teenager, Sam had devoured whole libraries worth of apocalyptic fiction. He’d enjoyed the thought exercise of what humanity might start to look like after all its known structures and habitats were destroyed, he’d enjoyed the appearance of monsters, something to draw them all back together again.
, I’m her uncle. And thirdly, I may have introduced you, because that was situationally the polite thing to do at a
When whatever had happened to Dean had happened he’d been entirely alone. No Cas, no Sam, no team of friends or comrades. Just himself alone with his thoughts –
Cas had been sure Dean was just going to curse at him for that, but, for some reason it was all too effective as a line. Unable to hold back any longer, Cas came moments behind him. If it hadn’t been for Dean’s rapidly flopping legs, Cas would have collapsed on top of him.
“Aliens,” Dean said, a smile threatening to pull his lips right up as he bucked right up into Cas’s palm.
“So we can assume then that this is a form he chose. Perhaps unconsciously – if he was worried about seeing us again…”
“We’re not reporters. We want to talk to you about Bobby Singer.” Feeling grateful that Cas hadn’t tried to shut down that “We”, Dean noticed that Rufus had stopped moving.
“I don’t think it’s too late to run,” Cas pointed out. He looked like he was doing his best not to move anything but his lips. “He’s not – Ah.”
Dean knew exactly how fast angels were – he was fresh off fighting Michael, he didn’t need reminding. They were fast, unstoppable, strong –
Rolling his eyes, Dean leaned back against the kitchen unit, hand groping around for the coffee he’d left beside him. “Routine salt and burn, Sammy. We got it.” Dean took a slow drink to hide his smile. “Cas stayed up and found where our guy’s buried.”
Like, she’d known it was winter when she booked, she had, but… really? Constant rain and darkness? Because
“It’s uh,” Dean said, mouth doing its best to cover it up even though his brain was screaming to leave it alone, “it’s kinda fun seeing an angel all covered in dirt.”
Ruby followed them into the kitchen smiling and trying to imagine her own father ever offering to make her hot chocolate, never mind with trimmings. “Oh, I’m open to most things, you know me.”
Not that she should really be comparing Sam to Lilith. For one, Sam was strictly a fling and Lilith had been someone she’d lived with, had been someone
Cas shook his head, still staring at Dean, knowing that, for once, he had permission to do so as much as he wanted. “I still can’t relax.”
I don’t even know her – I mean I do,” Dean hastily added at the man’s sternly narrowed eyes. “We met like… yesterday. Online. We swapped houses.”
Behind her, Dean squinted his eyes as he noticed Fergus Crowley beelining towards them, looking uncharacteristically rattled, and in a hurry.
Dean might have been putting himself in unnecessary danger all the time, and some of that would still have been Cas’s fault for how he’d driven Dean to feel. But that wasn’t what had changed him. There just wasn’t any research that monsters took interest in other types of monsters, except possibly for food. So…
“I mean you play good when it’s your own songs. It’s just your choice in covers I’m questioning. And, rightly.”
Everything went pretty much as it had the first time, bar the few additions. Cas saw Dean sitting there, wearing his clothes, his glasses, and he melted. Dean leaned up into Cas’s kiss like he’d been sitting at home missing him, and not sitting no further than 30 feet away from him for the better part of ten days.
Sensing Dean watching him a good deal more than he was expecting him to and enjoying the attention, Cas took his time pushing a syrup-laden mouthful onto his fork and bringing it up to his face.
Crowley’s lips pursed disapprovingly around his straw before he sat up straighter. “You alright, squirrel? You seem… twitchy.”
“Neither did you,” Sam bit back immediately, and Dean wanted to laugh. This was so familiar, so meaningless. None of it mattered now and yet a few years ago, a lifetime ago, it might have meant the world.
Ruby walked into her office that morning holding a very large, very sparkly wreath, which she dropped down onto Charlie’s desk like it was roadkill.
“Sure.” Dean shrugged. “Dude, I have no plans, and I am so jetlagged I am currently not sure what day it is.”
Cas, who was throwing away a safe and comfortable life of helping people just like he’d always wanted for some
“Why?” Dean’s lips curled up slowly from one corner. “Not like you’re keeping any secrets much longer.”
? You’re not exactly giving me a whole lot of details here. Maybe I was wrong about not wasting you,” Dean added when nothing he was saying seemed to encourage a response.
“It’s too much to ask, I know. But you said you wish you could’ve stopped him leaving. So, stop him slipping away from us, please.”
Cas smiled, looking down bashfully, as though Dean had just gifted him with some kind of great and lofty compliment. “Well, I suppose it’s worth a try. Though, I’ll confess I’m possibly not the best at looking to deal with healing old traumas.”
But he’d gone anyway. So now Sam was more sober, he was mostly feeling… proud, which he’d told Dean eventually after several preceding colourful texts.
Cas laughed, surprised enough to start easing himself out. He really was getting too old and stiff for clinging on to the backs of couches.
Cas moved before Sam even noticed that’s what he was doing, and moments later Dean was peacefully asleep, gently held in Cas’s arms. “I’ve got him,” he said to Sam, ignoring the glares of the rest of the team. Many of these people had worked with Cas for years, looked up for him for direction, and yet Cas had completely obliterated everyone’s impression of him, revealed himself entirely, just to save Dean pain, to save Sam a fight.
“Neither of us know how to fly a plane, Dean.” Cas said, frowning at his attempt at an Americano. “And you
There was sniffing at the door, and though there were none of the words that Dean had heard them use already, he was sure there was more than one of them out there.
“I’m coming in to raid your clothes,” Dean announced, opening Cas’s bedroom door. “Oh, dude, you still look like you swallowed two jawbreakers down pipes you don’t even have.”
When they’d managed to make contact with Anna about Michael she’d promised to look into ideas about helping Dean, but she hadn’t sounded very optimistic. Mostly, she too had sounded angry.
Absently, Dean dipped his hand into the blood from the corpse beside him as he thought back to one of those memorable times that Cas had known exactly how to drive him insane.
Hand delving deep into a bag full of M&Ms, Dean stopped in his tracks when he saw Cas walk into the room. “Fuck, that swelling really hasn’t gone anywhere yet has it?”
“You really weren’t in this for the money or fame, were you,2 Meg said dryly, continuing to shake her head. “Have you spoken to him yet?”
Then he noticed the unnaturally poised way Dean was holding himself and realised that wasn’t it at all. Both groups about to clash were people he took responsibility for, people he felt he had failed – people he considered his family. He would do nothing to direct them into destroying each other.
The afternoon coffee with his career idol really hadn’t hurt either – but that didn’t count for feeling more productive, because even hours after Cas had left,
“You’re wrong,” Sam said, feeling tears prick at his eyes. “I do need you. That’s why we’re out here.”
Rufus gestured down at his gardening outfit. “Do I look like I’m planning to be there? Now how many times do you need to be told to git?”
It was going to be a big, overbudgeted, dumbass movie moment, just like their first kiss in the rain. But not raining. And with music swelling behind them. Like John Williams style triumphant levels.
Looking characteristically puzzled, Cas strode in. Lilith had a big family, and Ruby had met a lot of her other cousins in the time they’d been dating and then living together. But Cas was the only one Ruby had ever found attractive, had actually been trying to get with before she’d ever met Lilith.
And even with the joy and heartache of seeing Dean, his Dean, alive and well, now all that Cas could think on was what Sam had just asked him.
Reaching for a glass of red wine on the shelf they’d once used for keeping gardening appliances, Michael smiled up indulgently at her. “I know. And I’ve actually come around to agreeing with your point.”
He went home that summer expecting it to be the last time he ever went back; the last time he ever climbed the long, stone staircase of his family home.
Cas noticed that Dean was staring at him, but unlike most times Cas tried to talk through TV that Dean had on, the look he was receiving for this infraction was painfully fond.
“Get weird when I bring up my brother.” Much as neither of them had become major sharers, they had spent enough time trapped together to have no sense of modesty, or secrecy, or so Dean had thought. They’d talked through politics, what Cas thought about the dinosaurs, what Dean thought about Patrick Swayze’s dance moves, and what they both thought about their fellow inmates. But anything approaching the topic of Dean’s childhood or the reason Cas had ended up in here and the conversation took a turn and usually died out.
It was probably an accident, just an awful coincidence in this new life not ruled by a story. But Sam couldn’t shake the feeling that Dean had let this happen. He’d been putting on a good face of it. But he’d put a good face on it when he’d been bound for Hell, too. Sam should have been watching him better, he should have known –
He wanted to think something dumb really hard but he didn’t really have the energy. When they told him that they were safe, that they’d dealt with Michael, he wasn’t going to stick around. Nothing had changed, and Sam was being eaten by hippos in a river in Africa if he didn’t see it. Cas too. They had lives to get back to. Especially now they didn’t have to grieve, they didn’t have to feel guilty.
Somewhere behind him, there was a small gust of wind that hit his back along with the familiar sound of wings.
Dean blinked a few times as he took in the sight of the company’s chief design editor and her girlfriend. “Eileen. Bela. That’s… a lot of tinsel,” he managed as he clumsily signed out, “
The children were both sitting up when Cas walked in, like they were trying to listen to something going on outside. Their eyes both glowed purple, which Cas now believed was a defensive look, but they didn’t seem concerned by his presence. He’d observed some monsters with the ability to heal – did they have.
Distantly, Cas was becoming aware that they were taking things too far. But it was almost a relief – there’d been such a strange tension between them for so long that it felt good to relieve some of that – even if it was in anger.
“That makes sense,” Cas heard himself say. “But I don’t know if I’m going to be able to relax enough to make this work. I - ” he laughed, physically pained by the irony of it all. “I want to live, Dean. So, I’m stressed about dying. But I… well, I need to.”
Bela didn’t smile. “Well,” she said, “It’s always nice to meet the new talent.” And with that she walked away, allowing Dean a long look at the swishing tail emerging from the back of he skirt.
“And if there’s anything else I can help you… practice, while you’re in town?” There was mild panic in Dean’s eyes now, but Cas was enjoying the thought he’d put it there. “Let me know.”
“Guys,” Sam said, clearing his throat as he stood up to give her a hug. She smelled good too. Damn it. Why did the others have to be here? “I’d like you to meet Ruby. We uh, met last night.”
Not because he missed his cooking, which he hadn’t known about then. Not because he missed the casual way Dean touched him, reached for him, because that hadn’t been something he’d done then. It definitely had nothing to do with the sex, because he’d had no idea then that he might have been lucky enough to get to have that with Dean.
But even if it was all fake, he had to know. “If I’d… Cas if I…” Dean moved forward, not trusting his words, because they’d always let him down, and he held Cas’s hands like Cas had gripped onto his, earlier. “If I kissed you,” he said, the words tumbling out sounding more wrong than this whole fake bunker was, because it all looked perfect, “and I… I asked you to come with me to bed. Would you… could you even…?”
Cas’s mouth twitched up suspiciously. “You’ve, uh,” he touched a finger to his own lip, “there’s red…”
Looking grumpy, Dean finally flung his blanket-laden body over the couch, not seeming to be aware that he was essentially cuddling in to Cas now. “Nobody’s paid me yet, can you believe it?”
When he woke up, it was still dark. He was lying in the middle of the park Cas had only recently told him he didn’t love him in, and the dew of the grass soaked into his jeans as the blood on his hands dripped onto the grass.
He’d been abandoned. The sting of that truth still reverberated painfully enough to stop him from forgetting that much. He may have been loved, but no one had fought for him. But he had people who would fight for him now. Whoever that happened to be.
Inhaling deeply, Dean looked down at his empty glass. “Maybe I do need to get away from the place. Not to quit,” he added quickly, “fuck that, I like my job.”
Eventually he had a carefully curated casual home outfit to leave the room in, but hearing Dean’s voice stopped him before he could leave the room.
Cas and Anna started living in a small apartment space together. Sometimes they would talk about the years of the other’s life that they’d missed, and sometimes they would cry together. One day, Anna pointed out that since neither of them were dead, and they both felt so guilty, that they should be out there trying to help.
“Worried about you, mostly.” Sam smiled, apparently kind enough to finish his interrogation. “But things have been ok. Eileen moved in.”
“Hey, Sunshine,” Dean said, flashing a smile and holding out the spare holiday themed coffee he’d picked up on his way like a carrot in front of a horse. Cas took it with only a small glance of suspicion – the larger he saved for Dean’s car.
Jack turned to smile at him once, and for a moment looked exactly like himself before he disappeared in a shower of yellow light.
There was something comforting about watching the wind and the waves and the rain from the warm comfort of the indoors, and the house really did get a good view of that, so staring at it killed some time in a soothing sort of way.
Dean shrugged. All of this felt surreal in a way that made him want to burst out into nervous laughter. “Been worse. But I thought you went and
.” Wishing again that she could blame this on her now ex, Ruby went back to staring at her screen. “It bounced back and hit me in the face, ok? Lili thought it was hilarious.”
, exactly. It was scarcely a shade darker in lipstick than she’d normally do for work. But Sam had scarcely seen her out of pyjamas and sweat pants since he’d met her… so maybe a cute woollen dress with the cuter boots was pushing things a little far, but maybe she needed a little far. She was after all turning up at the guy’s house after stalking his self-owned business to find his home address. (Or what she was hoping was his home address. God, if he’d put his mother’s address on here instead or some shit she was going to curl up and die.)
He smiled. “I think she’d actually be pretty disappointed if she saw where we ended up, so, selfishly, it wasn’t actually on my mind. Much,” he added.
Dean’s new travelling companion nodded thoughtfully. “Don’t have any way to help you get inebriated there, compadre, but I can lend you my fidget cube if that would be of any help to you…”
Sam was getting worried over how his friend was reacting to everything going on, but he couldn’t allow himself to dwell on that now, he reminded himself as he sat down across from where they’d tied his brother’s hands together and left him at the edge of the camp. As Sam had asked, he wasn’t currently being guarded.
1:45 and the announcement came through on the tannoid that the library would be closing in fifteen minutes, and could everyone still using the facilities start closing down their machines… That was when Dean started to panic. He
“What? No. I just… I don’t want to feel like I’m – like we’re holding you back or something. You could go do
“The everything was definitely great,” Sam agreed, taking his cue to stand. “For the record, your ex is nuts.”
Even as he glanced down at his bloodied hands, Dean rejected the possibility. Monsters ate when they were hungry. He wasn’t.
“Well, it’s private business of two women I’m close to, so I probably shouldn’t say. But since I’m currently annoyed at both of them… Ruby invited Lilith to live with her, despite all warnings from me, and apparently Lilith has been cheating on Ruby for months, which Ruby found out just yesterday.”
“Get outta my head, kid,” Dean said, firmer now but still not unkind. He hoped. He was so goddamned tired, and maybe he was tired of being the bad guy too.
But he’d invited her out to meet his friends and, surely, he wasn’t about to do that unless he was single. Unless, of course, his friends were also liars and scumbags.
He still didn’t know what he wanted to say to Dean, but he needed to say something. Being a coward until Dean inevitably started speaking to him again and they found some new kind of awkward normal wasn’t enough.
Cas was already spinning the dog around to face him, saying nothing as he anxiously took in the dog’s whole body.
One last desperate hope he’d had was that Michael, the family Cas was so certain he didn’t want Dean to meet, was some kind of awful person who was forcing Cas’s hand. But the guy seemed normal. Nice, even. Not a religious psycho, not a judgemental type…
Dean must have noticed his expression because moments later he was rushing to explain – “no! I mean… please come in. I’m just hosting a movie night for a friend I met yesterday.”
“Ah yes, your paramour.” Michael gave a little smile, as though amused by a private joke. “Cas won’t continue fighting when you’re gone. He didn’t before. Why do you think I worked so hard to send you away?”
Dean’s face twitched, like it was on the way to a smile he wasn’t sure he was going to allow himself. “Well, see what happened is before I started killing people, I had this pretty major breakup. And, apparently, it started interfering with the way I worked.”
“Now to figure out what makes me happy…” Cas muttered, still clutching the chain Billie had left him with. Someone with Jack’s power could apparently use it to make it out of the Empty – if some poor idiot was able to get it to him there.
Cas smiled. Out in the natural light again, seeing Dean’s clean and clean-shaven face really was something. “I was distracted. And I didn’t notice the music playing – I was trying to listen to what you were thinking. It got so frantic when you were trying to pluck up the courage. Like television static.”
And this sight was worth savouring. There was Cas, just as he’d been when Dean had last saw him, barring the blood and the tears.
They moved off in opposite directions, getting their people up and moving. Usually they might happily stall to find what was approaching them – they were all well-prepared, and it could be useful research for later. But now, wordlessly, they were in agreement.
Moaning a little at the taste of the blood on Cas’s lips, and a lot for the feeling that he’d finally come home, Dean only relaxed into it when he felt the pressure of Cas pushing back. Maybe neither of them deserved each other, or deserved to be the ones left standing here, but now Cas was tugging his lower lip away, and making him groan again when he buried his lips, his teeth, into the crook of Dean’s neck, just above the spot Benny had once sank his much larger teeth into.
It didn’t really matter that he now had a working knowledge of most popular culture. Having the experience itself was different – as it was with most things.
“She’s just a kid, man. And I know you care about her. Don’t let her live and die in this hellhole just because you can’t get over your own issues.”
“According to my brother I’ve started sounding it when I’m drunk but yeah no, I’m from Kansas originally.” Dean smiled as he opened the door and did another
than the look in Dean’s eyes as he’d told Cas to leave him alone. And Cas understood. Dean was aware enough of who he’d been to be frightened of who he’d become. He remembered enough and now knew enough to feel a double sting of betrayal at the sight of Cas.
And now Dean was standing apart from him again and Sam looked like he didn’t want to believe what was going on but also like he wanted to cry and Cas’s face was next to his.
The second time Dean prayed he was not sober. He was stumbling home from the usual place, knowing that again he’d be coming home to an empty bunker because Sam was slowly getting a life and a happy ending and that was so
Sam met his eyes steadily. The purple glow had faded now. “Safe. They are inside the tent, being kept warm. We found them some new clothes.”
“…would like to make a very special announcement. Please join me in welcoming one of our senior writers, Arthur Ketch!”
have something to do with the sex, but it was ultimately about realising this project together with Dean. About working on something that mattered to them both.
“Anyway, you are aware of the fact that technically, I do not have a gender. My ethereal being, my trueform...it is genderless.”
“Let me be perfectly clear, Dean. We have been in this room for 4 hours, 9 minutes, and 22 seconds. For that amount of time I have kept you here, naked and on the brink of orgasm without even touching you.” He catches Dean’s eyes and holds his gaze. “Know this. I could have caused you to orgasm before we even entered this room.”
there it is. Dean could put both his hands beside each other on that cock and it may barely cover it, and he’s aching for it, practically drooling over it. Cas pushes his slacks down around his thighs as he holds his cock in one hand, and Dean can see the pearly bead just glistening on the end. He licks his lips.
His cock has been standing at attention for what seems like hours now, and as far as Dean can tell through his sex-clouded mind, it may have been that long. The head is red and swollen and literally throbbing, at times actually painful, wet with precome and dripping to the floor.
Cas shook his head as Dean pulled back and grabbed him by the wrist, the effort to pull the stubborn angel upright way more than necessary for a man his size.
“Nothin’s changin’, Cas,” Dean shrugged, shaking his head. “Doesn’t matter if this is weird as fuck and we decide never to do it again, you’re still family, you’re still my best friend, and that ain’t gonna change.”
Dean stared at him, looked back to the hall, back to Cas again. His eyebrow ticked upward another hair and he clicked his tongue. “It’s late. Why don’t you just meet me in my room in ten? We’ll get at this thing in the morning.”
Jack and Sam’s eyes met and Jack shrugged innocently. Sam furrowed his brow and turned in his seat, laying an arm flat on the table. “It’s just feathers, Dean. Cas told us he’d be molting. Apparently it happens to angels from time to time.”
“I, um,” Cas coughed, his face red, and Dean was having a difficult time deciphering if that was due to the fever, his restraint, or embarrassment. “I understand that...there are times in which feelings don’t sync with the desire to...um. Fornicate.”
Cas bites his bottom lip, and Dean knows him well enough to know he’s not even intentionally trying to be sexy, but
Cas silently turned to his side to face Dean, propping his head up with a hand. “Dean, I’ve wanted to be like this with you since we were together in Purgatory. Through the Leviathans and Naomi’s mind control and the Mark of Cain, through the Darkness and the British Men of Letters, and yes, even now. More so now.” Cas paused, tonguing his bottom lip absently. “When I came to Earth, I thought it was for one specific purpose. I had to save the Righteous Man so he could fight in the battle of Armageddon...a fairly uncomplicated task. But then I got to know you and your brother, and things became complicated. You’re the greatest men I’ve ever known. I look up to both of you, I’m in awe of both of you, I love both of you...but after some time I knew I was...
The hold releases at the same time as Cas’s hand makes contact with Dean’s cheek again and he chokes and
The two small bulbs casting low light in the room burst loudly, sending sparks flying and shrouding them in darkness. The feeling that followed Dean could only describe as a super intense healing, a warmth flooding his entire body, spreading outwards, until the tips of his fingers and toes tingled with it. He could feel Cas’s cock still pulsing orgasm into him, twitching against his rim. Cas turned his head to mouth at Dean’s jaw, his neck, until Dean offered him his lips, and Cas gratefully accepted the invitation.
Cas looked at him again, as if this was general knowledge every normal person knew. “Yes, also the same as the canid mammals on Earth. I'm currently in an unmated rut with no one to-” he coughed and shivered. “It doesn't matter. It will pass. It always does.”
"Wouldn't be so sure," Dean responded breathlessly, his weapon in front of him defensively, ready for the next attack. Instead, another leviathan hit him from behind, knocking him to the ground, and the knife flew out of his reach. He heard another scream as his knees hit the forest floor and pain shot up his thighs. A body hit the ground with a thud, and while Dean didn't have the opportunity to look, he hoped to God it was any of them but Cas.
They kissed languidly for several minutes with no real finesse, tongues tangling, teeth scraping against pliant lips. Cas still clung tightly to him even after they stopped, and they laid wordlessly together, Cas’s forehead pressed to Dean’s shoulder.
“Yeah. And see…according to the lore, angel molting is just that…and none of this other stuff.” He flapped a hand at Cas, indicating his feverishness and general rough appearance. “But I did read a small passage about how angels could molt if they had other issues going on, or were in severe distress-“
“Since the beginning, I defied orders for you. I risked my existence for one human, because you inexplicably had this hold over me, and I couldn’t stand to see you hurt or upset, and suddenly instead of concern with disappointing my father, I was afraid to disappoint
Dean paused momentarily before pressing his lips together and setting his jaw. Cas looked too exhausted to argue but shrank as far into his chair as he comfortably could as Dean approached, stiffening when he laid a hand on his arm.
"Well, now...it hasn't taken yet." Lox smiled a feral smile, his thick dreadlocks falling haphazardly around his face.
Cas pressed his lips together and nodded, and Dean jerked his head to the side and arched slightly up off the bed, pushing himself down against Cas.
“That’s not-” Dean couldn’t bring himself to say it. Couldn’t tell Cas that wasn’t the reason they were there, together, back in Purgatory, looking for a fucking
It was just the way Cain had said, all those years before. The way it was written. First his friend, then his lover, then his brother.
Dean swallows, his Adam’s apple bobbing under his stubbled neck. Cas moves his hand, giving Dean a nod, permission to speak.
Regardless, Cas was kissing him back with the same fervor that stirred Dean into it, and soon they’d stumbled back, Cas grunting lowly as the air was punched out of him when his back hit the firm trunk of a tree. His hands eventually came up, too, holding Dean around his collar, but instead of what should have come next, Cas pushed him away, hands still buried in his flannel.
“Um.” Dean looked around the room quickly, chewing his lip. “I don’t...I don’t have any, um. Anything to make this...a little easier.”
“God, Cas, you- fuck!“ Dean pants hard, finally cutting his eyes up at Cas, gritting his teeth so he could speak, “you’ve made your point.”
“You know this time is different. Dean-” Cas grabbed his arm and pulled, yanking him back, holding him in place. “I didn’t...I’m sorry about Mary. If I’d had any idea, Dean, any idea what Jack would do-”
“Maybe,” Sam nodded to him, then looked back to Dean. “I mean, we can clean them up, but there’s hardly a point until he’s done. I just swept the hallway last night before bed, and…well.”
Dean leaned in and, before he could think too much about it, pressed their lips together hard. He felt Castiel’s fingers tangle in one of the sleeves of his shirt, his muscles clench under Dean’s hands, the tenseness in his lips melt away after the initial touch.
Dean’s breath catches, the beginning of a tearless sob, a rush of excitement. He feels the grace pull him back a little from that edge, letting him teeter, but definitely less forceful than before. So Cas can
Cas nodded and got to his feet with some effort, the two of them working to relieve him of his shoes, socks, jacket, and shirt. Cas's hands moved to his belt and he paused, pulling his bottom lip between his teeth as he looked down.
. Dean gulps again, not sure if he’s relieved or disappointed when Cas lets the belt fall to the floor.
But then Sammy got Eileen back; someone in the life, someone who could take the punches and keep getting up. She’d come back from the
Dean mumbled to himself as he pushed feathers into a pile at his feet, some small, some up to a foot long, dull black things tinted blue at the ends, some dry enough to flake apart when touched.
Dean spent so long being so careful. Long before they knew about Chuck, or God, or whatever. Back when things were simple; just the three of them, working cases, fighting monsters, saving people. But then he was careful because they lost everyone. Then, he was careful because he couldn’t afford the liability of caring about someone else as much as he did Sammy. He was careful because he’d felt that feeling before, goddammit, and it was the kind of thing that would get you killed in their line of work.
Dean’s hands barely hovered over Cas’s sides as they rutted together, and he allowed himself to just
He was still sweating, what Dean would consider profusely for him, since the only other time he’d ever seen Cas sweat was when he was human and sick. He never had a problem meeting Dean’s eyes and now is no exception, but there was worry in his eyes and the hands on Dean’s knees were shaking slightly, the tremors still consistently wracking his body.
Cas paused and slowly moved his hands to the outside of Dean’s thighs, pressing his fingers into the skin. A warmth coursed through him, starting on the surface of his skin and soaking into his pores, invading his veins and tumbling through his blood. He let out a breath and relaxed, his body loose and comfortable under Cas’s touch.
Dean almost laughed, but the realization hit him before he had the chance. “You can’t...you can’t say it either.”
Dean took the opportunity to grab the back of Cas’s head and crush their lips together, licking at the seam of his lips until Cas finally opened for him. Cas hurriedly worked Dean’s pants open and down his thighs, and they dropped the rest of the way once they hit his knees. He stepped out of them and kicked them to the side, a hand on Cas’s waist guiding him toward the bed. They awkwardly tumbled to the bed when the backs of Dean’s knees hit the mattress, and Dean winced as their teeth clacked together.
Dean recognized the voice. They were Leviathan, all three of them, and Cas and Dean had spent a year fighting them off in Purgatory all those years ago.
do, want you, that- what I meant was, I...if we were to...I wouldn’t want it to be forced. I want...with you, it’s different. I-”
“Molting, yeah. Right.” Dean sighed and knelt down in front of the chair, scraping his teeth over his bottom lip. “Thing is, Cas…I looked up angel molting.”
” but of course he can’t, so he prays it, prays it as loud as he can as he looks up at Cas with tear-filled eyes as Cas soothes and rubs that side of his face and rubs a finger over Dean’s spit-slicked lips that are wrapped so beautifully around his girth.
Cas groans loudly and pushes himself deeper, rocking in and out at a breakneck pace. At this point Dean can’t even breathe anymore; Cas is actually in too deep for him to draw in air, and he knows Cas is going to oblige him, finally,
“I feel the same way, you know,” he said gruffly, fiddling with the buckle before moving the the top button of Cas’s slacks.
Cas furrowed his brow and cocked his head to the side. He reached up, wrapping a hand around Dean's wrist.
“...and disappear, leaving us wonderin’ where the hell you went? Let us think you left on your own?”
Cas blessedly didn’t press him for an answer, instead flexing his hands comfortingly over Dean’s thighs and slowly,
They finally located the fields and Cas picked one of the ugly- and quite frankly, phallic- tentacle-shaped blossoms, immediately turning and motioning to Dean. They started back at a brisk walk, as the forest began to darken around them.
“I see it too,” Jack said simply as he walked into the kitchen, giving Dean a smile as he sat down across from Sam. Sam wordlessly slid his plate over to him and Jack began eating without preamble, looking innocently back up at Dean as he chewed a bite of bacon.
“The hell,” Dean muttered, furiously dusting off the counter, holding his mug far away from the mess. He frowned and turned to lean against the counter, sipping at his coffee. Sam was sitting at the table, too immersed in whatever was on his computer to eat his breakfast- which was surely cold by now- that he hadn’t noticed Dean’s miniature fit.
“Chuck has been punishing me since the beginning. Although I…” he looked around, “I’m not sure, of all the hells I’ve been through, why he chose this one. Naomi’s hell was much, much worse.”
“Come on,” Dean said gruffly, gesturing him forward, rolling his shoulders back to brace himself. “Before I lose my nerve.”
They were both quiet for awhile, not awkwardly so, even while the situation was. Cas’s knot slowly went down and he slipped out, laying on his back next to Dean. Dean stretched the muscles in his arms and legs, the sound of a few satisfying pops filling the silence. He blinked and the wings were gone again- well, technically not
Dean hadn’t realized how hard he was squeezing his eyes shut until he opened them, blinking away black spots. He didn’t meet Cas’s gaze though, swallowing hard.
is by far, without a doubt, the most stupid combination of words that has ever left Dean Winchester’s mouth.
Dean pressed his lips together and nudged Cas's elbow with his own. "You tried to tell me before and I didn't listen. And...fuck, I'm really sorry, Cas. I really am."
“I'm expected to...” Cas paused, swallowing hard, “do my part. To find an unmated Omega and...procreate.”
God, his cock is so hard it’s painful, but he can feel Cas’s hold starting to slip a little, and so Dean grabs his hips with his hands and holds on for dear life, pushing Cas’s cock further into his throat of his own accord. His own cock is bobbling wildly between his legs and he just feels like if he can throw Cas off, just a bit more, just a little…
Cas stared at him for a solid few seconds before the corner of his lips finally quirked, and his eyes softened. “Never.”
“Oh,” Dean said dumbly, unclenching his muscles. “I thought...that you, uh…” he gestured vaguely toward Cas’s crotch.
“Yeah,” Dean chuckled softly, “uh, for awhile now. And...after seein’ you- or, I guess, who you would’ve have been had I not become who I am now- it, uh...makes me realize how far we’ve come. How important we are to each other.”
Dean hasn’t seen Cas for a while now. He’s using some weird combination of grace and invisibility to drive home his point, and damned if it isn’t working.
Cas pressed his lips together and half rolled his eyes, ultimately closing them for a long moment. He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, looking back up at Dean. “You wouldn't believe me if I told you.”
“Were you...you were just going to leave one day? Or...I don’t know, laugh at a joke or feel good about solving a case or-”
“I’ve always wanted to know what your lips would look like wrapped around me,” Cas says, low and gravely, his shoes shuffling against the concrete as he moved forward. “I think it’s time we find out.”
“Dean,” Cas continued, dropping his hand. “They’ve been using it against us the whole time. Everything with Naomi, before...last time we escaped from here. When she worked to brainwash me. I never told you what she did. I never told you...what I had to do.”
Cas is maybe a mere inch from his face, so close his hot breath tickles Dean’s lips and all he’d need to do to get a taste is stick his tongue out, but he doesn’t. Instead he trembles and desperately and secretly wishes Cas would hit him again.
He never should have made this bet. Subconsciously, he knew he would lose. Perhaps that’s why he made it. Always the glutton for punishment.
“It’s okay if you don’t want to...do this. I didn’t expect...you to…” he paused, clearing his throat. “I’m aware of your preferences, Dean, and I don’t wish to force you into a sexual encounter with which you are uncomfortable-”
,” Cas growled, grabbing Dean's wrist. “Believe me when I say that there is nothing your hospital can do to help me. It would only cause unnecessary chaos.”
“He’s just...just testin’ me,” Dean muttered. “That’s all. He’s fuckin’ with us. He knows this is...this place...it’s important to me. You know that. You know him. He wants you to die here, he
“I understand you’re angry. And if you need to be angry at me, that’s okay. I’m angry too. I’m angry at Michael, at Chuck…” he huffed a laugh, shaking his head, eyes downcast. “At myself. It’s only right I be sent to the place I served my own penance once before.”
Cas rolled his eyes before grabbing Dean’s hand, but just as they were about to step through the portal, they were both yanked back with enough force to pull them to the ground. They both landed hard with pained grunts, and Dean was quick to his feet, his back to Cas as he squared up against their opponents. He could hear Cas getting to his feet behind him.
“Exactly like that.” Cas sighed, tiredly, like he was finally feeling every second of his inordinate amount of years. “Here we are.”
Jack watched him with a blank stare as he chewed his food, and Sam fixated on his computer screen again. Dean huffed and topped off his coffee, kicking feathers out of his way as he exited the kitchen and made his way to his bedroom.
Dean looked down and cleared his throat. “So what happens if you don't, uh...y'know. Take the edge off.”
He felt him before he saw him, which is a phenomenon that neither of them can quite explain, just an overwhelming feeling of presence that feels like it’s wrapping Dean in a cocoon of static electricity.
Dean chewed his lip. “Amara. She...she knew. She used you to get to me. Used you to make me come for her.”
Cas hums and stands, cocking his head to the side in that way he does, his eyebrows drawn together. Dean actually sighs a little when he slips his strong hands in his own pockets. He hopes the disappointment isn’t too obvious.
I want you too, and I’m on board for this. It’s...not exactly how I imagined, but uh, you need it, and...truth is, I’d rather us do this now than you needin’ to do it with someone else.”
“What did you expect, Cas?!” Dean said finally, a little louder than he intended. Loud enough that Cas snapped his own mouth closed. “For me to just accept it and move on? When have you ever known me to do that?”
“I think we can do better than that.” He pursed his lips and raised a brow. “Whaddaya say, big guy?”
He opened his eyes and looked around again, scoffing and scrubbing a hand down his face as he plopped down on his bed. It was rare that Cas didn’t answer a call from Dean almost immediately, and even more rare when he didn’t at all. Dean had called him several times each day since the molting started, so finding out the damn guy was in the bunker on and off for days and never checked in really chapped his ass. They were best friends, for chrissake.
weakness, his stupid fucking brain giving Chuck all the ammunition he needed to destroy everything he loved. Chuck knew exactly what things would hurt Dean the most, and he was using them against him.
Dean stopped hard and spun on his heel, setting his jaw. “What do you want me to say, Cas? ‘Oh, nice night we’re havin’? I don’t care where we are, long as it’s together?’”
He was definitely hard. The outline of his cock pressed against the fabric, jutting out far enough that it wasn't subtle. Dean swallowed, his throat dry.
But once Cas started in with his grace, that feeling of power just soaking through his pores and dancing through his veins, rising and falling with each breath and Dean could almost see it, pushing him toward climax, dangling him over that edge only to laugh and pull him back.
“Mhm,” Dean said quickly with a nod. “Right. Well, I mean, it's not like I'm the one getting' naked.”
Dean had turned a bright red only a few words in, but he scrubbed a hand distractedly over his face anyway. “You sap.”
He flattens his tongue and lets it run along that vein, and Cas hisses before he lands another hard smack on Dean’s cheek, the sound echoing off of the bare walls of the dungeon. Between that and the huge cock in his mouth he actually chokes a little, tears springing to his eyes as his cheek begins to sting, and
“Understood.” Dean pulled his hand away and held both of them up in surrender, giving Cas a small grin. “Oh. Oh, shit.”
He’s coughing and sputtering whenever he does get air in but he doesn’t care because Cas is pushing in and pulling out of him with such concentration, the noises Dean’s pulling from his lips absolutely erotic, and he can’t even complain. Dean is sucking the cock of a fucking
Dean scoffed and raised his arms, looking around the kitchen. “Oh, are we just ignoring the fucking mess in the kitchen now? Or the hallway? The library? Am I the only one seein’ it?”
Dean’s throat constricted and he swallowed through it, suddenly hyper aware of Cas’s cheek pressed against his. He cleared his throat and shifted, and Cas pulled back to look at him, lifting some of his weight. Intense blue eyes met Dean’s, searching, reading, concerned.
Cas grabbed his wrist as Dean moved to stand, his grip tight. Dean looked down, breathed in, out again. Looked back up at Cas.
Cas stared after him, and as he heard Dean's voice down the hall filling Sam in on their run, blunt and authoritative, he began to smile.
Cas nodded. “That's not the entire truth. I do have a gender, but not in the traditional sense. In the scope of your species, I present myself as male. In Heaven, I'm simply an Alpha.”
do. You’ve never done what you were supposed to, not in Heaven’s eyes. Don’t you dare try to go out any differently.”
” Cas said desperately, shaking his head, laying his hand over Dean’s to still it. “I, um...I’ve been…” he trailed off, frowning.
“You think Chuck wrote this?” he asked, a little disbelievingly, whispered for just the two of them. “Dean, I can assure you...Chuck didn’t write this. No matter how many different ways he wrote it...none of them were meant to lead to this. Yet they did, in spite of him. It was a constant, through all timelines. Through all universes.”
He didn’t look at Cas at first when he pulled away, keeping his eyes downcast before closing them and taking a deep breath. He finally opened them again and slowly looked up, exhaling a little shakily. Cas’s expression was unreadable at best and Dean floundered, transitioning easily into nonchalance.
He barely gets time to recover before Cas lands another hit, this time on the other side, and he cries out around the cock in his mouth, followed by a long, low moan. The tears are falling openly now and he doesn’t care, because this is the most turned on he’s ever been and he needs this, he can’t explain how or why, all he knows is he just
“Since when are you ashamed? Of...anything? Ever?” Dean gave an awkward laugh. “I thought nudity didn't affect you guys.”
Dean opened his eyes, blinked against the shimmering black and blue of the appendages. Whole, healthy wings. Unlike the feathers they’d been wading through in the bunker for the past several weeks, these were soft, strong...razor sharp when necessary, as Cas had shown a time or two.
“Very well.” Cas sat up as straight as he could, and Dean took a few steps back, sitting on his bed with his hands clasped between his legs. “Once every millenium or so-”
Sam shrugged and returned to his computer. “Dunno. I saw him last night before bed, but I think he left again.” He gestured to the screen. “I’m tryin’ to find out what I can about whatever he’s got goin’ on, see if we can help. He seemed…real uncomfortable.”
Dean huffed irritably and stepped forward, locking eyes with Cas only a few short inches away as he hooked his thumbs into the waistband of his boxers and slid them down. He straightened again and reached up with one hand, thumbing at Cas’s chin before leaning in hesitantly and pressing their lips together. Cas’s were chapped, like always, and a little rough, but he kissed like it was sacred, like he was savoring it. Dean liked that. Too many people he’d been with wanted to skip the intimacy altogether...and he’d been too afraid to admit that he needed it. Cas didn’t need an admission; Cas knew him, and it might’ve helped that Cas sort of needed the exact same thing, in his own way.
Is it cheating that Cas is using his grace? Dean isn’t sure. Nor does he care. Because right now, kneeling with his hands behind his back in the middle of the dungeon, his head down, cock hard and heavy between his legs, the thrill that anyone could walk in on him at any moment… Dean’s living for it. He’s more fucking turned on than he thinks he’s ever been, and really, that’s saying something.
His clothes were soaked through with sweat, dark nipples hard under his white shirt- not that Dean noticed- his hair wet and matted to his forehead, skin red, eyes bloodshot. It looked like every small movement hurt him, going by his wince as he shifted in his seat. His wings were only visible in Heaven, unless Castiel decided otherwise, which begged the question why his stupid feathers were all over the bunker, but Dean decided that was a question best saved for later.
“We aren’t done talking,” Dean shot back, but Cas was already up and moving again. Dean scrambled after him, gripping his knife at his side, scanning his peripherals. “You can’t just...walk away because you think the conversation is over.”
Dean faltered, mouth opening and closing again. “I’ll...I’ll talk to Billie. Me and Sam. Maybe she wants to take Chuck out just as bad as all of us. He’s messin’ with the natural order of things now. Freein’ hell souls, waking the dead. Maybe-”
“Why didn't you come to me, man? I could've found you somebody. Not like, an Omega, but I coulda got you a chick-”
Cas was losing. He was pinned to the ground, barely holding the leviathan at bay, whose ridiculous Pacman-meets-Alien teeth snapped just inches from Cas's throat. Dean didn't waste time swinging the blade this time, either. The thing's head flew off and tumbled across the forest floor, leaves crackling in its wake. The body went limp on Cas's, the blood soaked through his clothes, drops coating his face and neck.
“No. I would only get temporary relief from knotting someone. Preferably an Omega, but...” he trailed off, looking at the floor, over at the wall...anywhere but at Dean.
After a brief struggle, Dean's pressed against leaves and dirt, the weight on his back was lifted completely and Dean jumped to his feet, immediately launching himself at Lox. He unsheathed his backup blade and plunged it into Lox's shoulder as they fell to the ground, the leviathan growling beneath him and clawing at the knife buried in his skin. Dean pressed his palm to the end of the handle, pressing it deeper as he stretched over Lox's head to reach for his Purgatory blade. He gritted his teeth as he moved back, sliding it toward him, and pushed himself to his feet. He raised the blade up and swung- effectively separating the leviathan's head from his body.
He’s not sure how much time has passed but it can’t be long, because when his eyes open again he’s back on his knees which are now screaming with protest, surely bruised by now, and Cas is above him again with his massive hard cock back in his hand. He’s jerking himself and Dean’s eyes widen, watching that beautiful hand clenching around that equally beautiful cock, sliding up and down the shaft and occasionally burying the head before letting it poke back out of his fist, red and leaking.
“That's not entirely true,” Cas said quietly. “And I imagine feelings are something that effects, um...physical-”
“I love you,” Cas said, as if it was the next logical thing to say. But he seemed so sure of it, Dean didn’t argue.
“Look, you want me. That much is clear.” He pointedly looked down, and Cas actually looked flustered. “I’m
Cas looked down, clasping his hands in front of him. “I’m glad you...um. I’m glad that’s okay...with you.”
“Hey, look, it's...” Dean shook his head, waving a hand. “I'm cool, Cas. No judgement or anything, you know? It's...that's, um...it's awesome. I mean, not the whole...” he swallowed hard, “rut thing, or whatever. But you...tellin' me, that's cool, I mean-”
“I caught my guardian angel when he fell after rescuing my righteous ass from Hell,” Dean singsonged, grinning widely.
“I know, Cas,” Dean said, tonguing his cheek and nodding. “I already know. And I...I’ve just been trying to own my shit, you know? Cause I wasn’t...wasn’t ready to accept that yet. And...I dunno...after seein’ dad again, for some reason I feel like I can finally be all the things I told myself I never could. I feel like I can finally be happy. I feel like I finally deserve for someone to feel about me the way you do.”
Dean held out his arms with a cheeky grin, and Cas clenched his jaw, meeting Dean’s eyes as he ripped the flannel from his shoulders and pulled the black t-shirt over his head. He hooked fingers into Dean’s waistband and pulled him roughly forward, their chests bumping, noses brushing.
“Before you say anything else,” Cas interrupted, casting him a serious look, “there’s something you have to know. Something else I should have told you.” He swallowed, cleared his throat. “When I went to Heaven, when I found Jack… the Empty found us. It wanted to take Jack, claim him for his angel side. I stopped it.”
Cas nodded back and pressed his lips together, laying his hands on Dean’s knees and closing his eyes.
Dean dragged his teeth over his bottom lip, nodding slightly. He took a few steps forward, reaching up to gently pull Cas’s hands apart, looking down between them as he moved to his belt.
Dean whipped around, finding Cas in the chair by his bed, looking…well, if he was being honest, the man looked like shit.
He cries out as the slap snaps his head sharply to the left, and suddenly Cas is in front of him again, and
Cas tongued the back of his bottom teeth as he pressed against Dean’s rim, and he let out a long shaky exhale when he began opening him up. Dean tensed, dropping his head back against the bed again and squeezing his eyes shut.
Dean stared at him, then huffed a laugh. “You're tellin' me Chuck activates a species preservation button?”
Dean held his arms out to the sides, some of his coffee sloshing over the rim of his mug. “So everyone’s seen him since this started but me?”
- a Winchester rite of passage, in his book- and damned if it hadn’t been the happiest he’d seen Sam in
Cas licked his lips and nodded slowly, squeezing Dean’s hand back. He slid his hands down to Dean’s thighs and used them to pull Dean flush with him, and he looked up at Dean as he reached down between them. The head of his cock slid over Dean’s slick rim and he inhaled sharply, closing his eyes and grabbing the sheets by his sides. He heard a wet sound as Cas slicked his cock with the substance now leaking out of his body, and damned if it wasn’t turning him on. His own cock was hardening between his legs, and he smirked when he opened his eyes to find Cas staring at it.
It was gradual enough that it took Dean awhile to realize what was happening, and once he did, it came with a ton of questions, none of which he wanted to audibly address.
Without moving, Dean felt gentle tickling at his sides. His gut reaction was to jerk away, but Cas shushed him, and the tickling turned to a caress, then a full embrace. And Dean knew it then, as he was shrouded in a cocoon of safety and warmth.
Cas huffs a laugh and shakes his head, offering his hand for Dean to lick off whatever’s left, which he happily accepts.
Dean gritted his teeth and shot him another glare before turning and starting again. Leaves crunching. Branches snapping. He could feel Cas close behind him.
So Dean has never been the best at gambling, and he mentally makes a note never to challenge Cas to anything ever again.
with you. I didn’t even think it possible, but…” he huffed a laugh, shaking his head, “I suppose each year I remain on this Earth I become a bit more human. And that affords me the opportunity to love you more and more each passing day.”
"Lox...didn't think you ugly bastards would still be living." Dean smirked, entirely more confident than he felt. Cas was close by, their knuckles occasionally brushing as they both surveyed their threats. Dean bristled. It'd be easier to feel brazen and cocky if he wasn't so goddamn worried. "You just won't be happy 'til we kill you, huh?"
“He was shaking, like he was cold,” Jack said slowly through a mouthful of food, frowning at the bacon in his hand. “But he had his jacket on, and he was sweating.”
Dean held Lox at bay with both hands, unable to see what was going on behind him with Cas, though he could hear him artfully swinging his blade. Occasionally one of the leviathans cried out, which Dean took as a good sign, even as he struggled against his own aggressor.
Cas full on starts fucking his mouth, assaulting his throat, his hands on either side of Dean’s face as he thrusts into his mouth over and over. Dean is gasping, making those guttural, throaty noises that all the porn stars make whenever they suck dick, only those guys are maybe half the size of Cas, and Dean’s honestly feeling pretty fucking proud of himself because he’s pushing through and he can tell Cas is starting to lose himself a little bit.
