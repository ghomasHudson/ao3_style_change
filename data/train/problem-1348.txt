During the three months after Irene, I find myself needing him more and more — reaching for casual contact with every chance I get. It is an involuntary reaction; I’ll catch myself nudging closer on the sofa or leaning back into him as he passes behind, and have to stop myself. This isn’t a relationship. We aren’t
With a delicate flourish, John lapped up the trickling release from Sherlock's slit before letting his length slip from his mouth as he took in the sensual noises of his lover post-orgasm. He hummed softly, enjoying the uniqueness of Sherlock's taste before pressing a gentle kiss to the crease of Sherlock's thigh. It was a delicate sort of kiss; there was no sexual pleasure to be gained, not even the slightest hint of personal gratification. The kiss was solely for Sherlock, a caressing promise that John would always take care of him no matter where life managed to take them.
I finally close my eyes, giving in to the brilliant sensation of John’s hand on my cock, working me to the very brink of disaster.
“My phone.” He interrupts, swiping a hand across his face and pressing his fingers beneath his eyes. I oblige, padding into the bathroom to find his jeans, abandoned on the floor. I pull his phone out of the back pocket and pass it over, squashing the curiosity that’s bubbling in my stomach.
The eager desperation in Sherlock's voice sent a shiver down John's spine and he couldn't help feeling chuffed with himself. He was the reason the great Sherlock Holmes was writhing on his back, aching for release; he was the reason the coherent thoughts of that brilliant mind were unravelling faster than a fraying ribbon. Yes, he -- John Watson -- was the only person in the world to see the world-renowned detective at his most fragile, his most vulnerable. The power that came with that sort of recognition filled him with an intense desire to stake his claim and, this time, he wouldn't brush it away. He might have been feeling the pull of exhaustion, but he didn’t want to deprive himself of such a gift. This time, he was going to devour him. He was going to take him apart, inch by beautiful inch until every fibre of Sherlock's being was consumed by the overwhelming sense of what it was like to be owned by another human being… and John was going to relish every second of it.
Carefully, I climb out of the shower, groaning when I realise John has stolen the last towel. I squeeze the water out of my hair before slipping back into my bedroom, cursing as carpet sticks to my sodden feet. I pull a clean towel out from my wardrobe, drying off my skin and stepping into clean pyjamas. It’s early, but I climb into bed, staring at the ceiling. I need the barrier of time — the dawn of a new day before I can face John again. Last time was intolerable — trying to maintain a normal facade as we carried on as usual. Now, I’m not sure I have the self-restraint; the ability to keep my hands to myself as he tries to ignore what has passed between us. I’m unsure of what the rules are here. Is he the only one that gets to initiate this? Do I have to sit back as he takes what he wants, but refuses to yield any level of intimacy?
The fabric of my shirt rustles softly as it's pushed to the floor and I hear a rough, strangled sound catch in the back of his throat. It's strange really, having the evidence of my torture on display like this, but I don't feel as exposed as I usually would. Perhaps it's the years of familiarity between us, or maybe even the more recent physical and emotional developments coming into play, but either way, it isn't as awkward as I would have imagined.
I let my tongue venture past my teeth, caressing John's cautiously, a little unsure just how much of me he actually wants as my body follows wherever he moves me. The result is more than satisfactory as a deep moan rumbles up through his broad chest. The sound is throaty and masculine, and I find that I'm desperate to hear it again.
A soft snort signalled Sherlock's indignation but John ignored it, waiting instead for a real response. "It's a seagull feather," Sherlock said finally. "But not just any seagull feather… You picked it up the last time we were down on the banks of the Thames with Lestrade for that homicide case… Sentimental, as always."
I stay silent, stunned by the admission. Of course I played for him — that first night, it was the only thing I could think of to wake him slowly; to save him from the depths of his night terrors. I never realised he knew.
“You think I didn’t notice, Sherlock? You play for me whenever I have nightmares. Now it’s the only thing that calms me down enough so I can fall back asleep.”
The question shouldn't have been as suggestive as it was, but Sherlock knew John better than anyone else in the world. Knowing how seriously he took his reputation concerning his military rank, and how careful he was with the way he carried himself brought a whole new aspect to the table. His willingness to steal something so simple yet seemingly sultry from the monarchy was definitely outside of John's comfort zone, but Sherlock had stolen that ashtray for him all those years ago, so it was only fitting that John returned the favour on their visit the previous morning.
His short fingers tease up the side of my body, brushing gently over the nape of my neck before sliding up to take their place in my hair. His touch is light, to begin with, tugging my hands out of the way and replacing them with his own as he works the lather into my scalp. As if our first encounter hadn’t been strange enough, this experience is even more so. The way his fingertips press against my skull is a whole new level of eroticism that I know I will be dissecting later once I’m alone. It’s possessive, yet dizzyingly intimate, almost as if he’s trying his best to leave the very form of his fingerprints embedded in my skin.
Sherlock's cock nudged against the back of his throat and John flushed as his gag reflex was tempted to trigger. It had been quite some time since he'd done this but if he played his cards right, it wouldn't take him long at all. Sherlock was in no mood to drag this out any longer than necessary so John curled his fingers around the thickening shaft, using his own saliva as the perfect lubricant.
His grip tightens slightly and I wrack my brain for clues in hopes of distracting myself from the intense waves of pleasure that threaten to break the walls of my mind palace wide open. If only he would say something, make a sound, do anything at all that might give something away — clue me into whatever it is that he’s thinking. Perhaps then I might know, might be able to deduce his heart over his body, and gain that coveted bit of insight that I so desperately need in order to set my mind at ease.
He takes a step backwards, and with one last cursory glance at my body, steps out of the shower as silently as he arrived. John is gone and, once again, I’m left alone with my thoughts. I throw a hand out behind me, steadying myself against the wall; knees weak. I close my eyes, committing every second to memory. The heated gazes and insatiable hunger leaves with him and I’m not exactly certain how I feel about it. It’s somehow worse than the last time, and Irene’s sultry voice echoes behind my half-lidded gaze as I lower myself to the bench seat in the corner of the bathtub.
After a conversation with his father goes awry, Sherlock finds himself even more frustrated with the state of his future. As part of his aristocratic duties, he reluctantly attends his father’s garden party with his childhood friend turned fiancée with every intention of sneaking out into London as soon as he gets the chance. However, a chance meeting with a handsome soldier alters his plans and promises a very interesting development as the evening progresses.
My flight lands back at Heathrow in the early afternoon, and I’ve barely made it back up the stairs of 221B when John accosts me in the hallway, blocking the door with his body.
With only the slightest hint of disbelief, John shook his head fondly, the amazement on his face growing more with each passing second. "Ridiculous, you know? And just how do you know the feather was the first thing I picked up, hm? I could have collected a couple of things before that."
He's beautiful like this, breathtaking even though I can't see him properly, and when he finally comes, I feel every inch of my body surrendering to the push and pull of his very existence. The broken whine that rips through him shatters me completely, and I lose myself to the intensity of his pulsing cock. Following him over the edge, I find that I am no longer my own man. I do not know where he ends and I begin, but I find that it doesn't matter. It will never matter as long as I have him in my life. If every aspect of John Watson consumes me completely, leaving no trace behind of the man I used to be, then so be it. If I were to die tonight, wrapped in the tender embrace of the man I love — the only person in the world I could ever have the desire to die for, then I will die knowing my life had a purpose. I will die with my heart on my sleeve and with every emotion I've ever kept hidden laid bare at his feet. I will die knowing that I have finally found the only thing in life truly with living for, and that will be more than enough for me.
The word hangs in the air, a near-perfect echo of everything I refuse to say. We lie in silence; both in mutual acceptance of our reluctance to be alone. We need a reminder that we’re alive; no longer caught in Moriarty’s games.
What feels like an eternity finally seems to pass, though I’m vaguely aware it’s only been about twenty minutes. His breath starts to even out, each muscle relaxing, his arms falling to rest on his ankles. Then, the sobs begin. Each one cracks its way out of his body and pulls at my heart. Each tear sounds loud as it drips into the base of the bath. I swallow my own tears, a useless response, and inch my hand forward on the side of the tub.
Hours later, I lie awake in my bed; staring at the ceiling. My body aches with exhaustion, but each time I close my eyes red dots dance behind my eyelids, and John stands before me, arms wrapped around Moriarty’s neck — prepared to give his life to save mine.
He didn't care that it had only been a few minutes; he didn't care that he'd already come. He just wanted to please his lover. He wanted to make this time memorable by giving Sherlock something special to save in his Mind Palace -- something he could keep to analyse forever and ever… something more than the sloppy first-time blow job he'd given him back in the old alleyway behind the Met.
“Good morning.” His voice is husky with sleep, and it sends a jolt of heat straight to my groin. Perhaps this is it; the start of a new chapter. Now, instead of ignoring the sparking electricity between us, we can acknowledge it — find comfort in each other rather than drowning in denial. I don’t know at what point John accepted that this was what he wanted, but I’m not going to complain.
Short, concentrated puffs of breath confirm his persistence before his lips even brush the newly cleaned skin of my shoulder blade.
A sharp intake of breath mingles with a laboured groan as our bodies slot together. It’s hard to say where mine ends and his begins. Hands rove over what seems like miles and miles of bare skin, the tension fading almost instantly as if an invisible glass has shattered between us. His body slides against mine in a luxurious rhythm, and it’s almost more than I can take. The way his lips brush over my eyebrow, the way his fingers dance over my ribs, it’s almost like our roles thus far have been reversed. All this time, I had considered myself to be a grand musician, plucking away at my violin at all hours of the night, but this time it’s different. This time it’s John.
"Fine," Sherlock sighed. He shifted again, bringing a hand up to fondle the leather strips where they rested against his skin.
Soft hands land on my waist and I choke back a groan, every cell straining with self-restraint. This is wrong. So wrong. We're at his wedding, his wife is in the next room, someone could walk in on us, and it's his wedding.
One major note: MIND THE TAGS! There is a scene in this chapter where John gets to put those doctoral skills to good use on a burn victim. I tried not to go too gory with the details, but I did have to do a bit to get my point across. I tagged it as mild gore, but I don't feel it's as bad as all that :)
"John, oh John…" Sherlock moaned, his voice nearing a shout as his wild curls tossed and turned from side to side as he came. The headboard rattled as his back arched and the cuffs pulled tight for a moment before falling slack -- the detective's body going limp beneath John's.
Special thanks to CarmillaCarmine for her notes and to MsScarlet for being my amazing beta!! I’m so grateful for you both!
"Sherlock?" he asks, breaking the pattern of our past and dragging me back to reality. His voice is quiet, barely above a whisper, but the weight that it carries speaks volumes. We've never talked during an encounter and, in my mind, this is uncharted territory. The heat of the moment fizzles out much like a candle in the wind, my stuttering heartbeat the only sound left to echo in the quiet of the room.
“Don’t worry, I doubt Moriarty could tell. He’s not particularly sharp when it comes to human emotion.”
“John, it’s me. I’m going to sit next to you.” He gives no verbal response, but his breath hitches slightly, and his shoulders tighten. Each breath echoes against the porcelain, and I sink to my knees next to the lip of the bath. The cold tiles burn my knees, but the shiver is gone. I make no move to reach out to John, even though I desperately want to.
I can hear John’s frustration mounting with every word I say, but I struggle to keep a hold on my desires. It isn’t fair. My brain is spiralling out of control, unable to focus on anything other than John and all the uncertainties buzzing between us. Why should he get to decide everything? Is that how all relationships like this work?
Was I vulnerable on my travels? Of course… I do not fault John for seeking companionship in my absence. There were others for me as well. Nameless men in dark corners of the world, but they could never compare. It was transactional — pure mathematical pleasure, unlike John. He can deny it all he wants, but we know each other. We understood enough to bring the other to the brink and keep them there, begging to be released. It wasn't until now, with time and distance, that I realise how emotional it all actually was. How far from John's intentions we had strayed.
My question falls unanswered, forgotten in an instant as John’s hands close around the bar of soap and he works an intoxicating lather up between his palms. The action is mesmerizing and my mind focuses instead on the particular way his fingers curl and uncurl slightly as the bar slips and slides between them as he moves to return it to its proper place.
Sliding a fingertip under the back flap, I tear it open with a delicate motion, completely taken aback when a single photograph slips out of the envelope and drifts to the floor. Even from here, I can see that it’s a picture of John. He’s on the pavement just outside of our flat, crossing the street and looking to his left as a taxi passes close behind him.
We stay, one hand in another, until the sobs begin to fade. Neither of us moves until each uncensored emotion has been drawn out, every muscle is relaxed, and John’s grip begins to weaken. I know that exhaustion will be biting at his heels.
Pure love and affection swelled in John's chest and he felt a surge of something curious deep in his belly. He honestly hadn't expected anything from Sherlock after the night before, where they'd spent a large majority of their time experimenting with ropes as Sherlock had driven him completely out of his mind, but, as usual, the detective never ceased to amaze him.
As the weeks pass, it starts to become harder and harder to keep myself in check. Each action is brushed with my affections, and frustration creeps into my skin as each one is disregarded. I become restless between cases; my body betraying me. To have been given a taste, yet denied the gratification of reaching out whenever I want, is driving me mad. My body thrums in anticipation, constantly ready for him to take what he wants. I second-guess every move, analyse every word, looking for some sort of sign. It builds and builds, until, finally, I can’t contain it anymore.
I know it’s wrong, bordering on unhealthy — but I can’t bring myself to put a stop to it. I want this, and each act has been fully consensual, but I am unnerved by the lack of rules.
John is already up when I wake, fully dressed and folding his remaining clothes back into his suitcase. He gives a warm good morning, sounding as if this could be the start of any other day. It’s a complete juxtaposition from the John I saw last night; the one caught in the claws of his terror; choking on his nightmares.
If there is even the slightest possibility that I could have engaged in sexual relations with The Woman, it is quite obvious that he would insist on checking me over to make certain that I am clean in every way possible. He is most likely extremely invested in confirming with his own eyes that I am free from any negative connotations The Woman’s professional, as well as leisurely, activities could have on my body. Even a very basic appreciation for medical logic would be able to confirm this theory. She did drug me once before after all, so I’m not ruling that possibility out either. He's done this sort of thing before when drugs were involved, albeit with a heavy emphasis on monitoring me for track marks after discovering my nasty little struggles with addiction, but still, my point stands.
And suddenly it hits me. That was the first sentence John had uttered since the minefield. Even when the officers questioned us, he let me take the lead, merely shaking his head or nodding in agreement. It had seemed odd at the time, the military precision of it, but my brain was far too preoccupied with my own uncertainties to process the information fully. It was almost as if — oh. Fuck.
My breath hitches as he works his way up, exploring the sharp edges of my features with a concentrated effort. My skin tingles and my eyes slip closed as he continues along the invisible line of my jaw. This is forbidden territory for us, but something about the night makes it seem as if an invisible veil has been lifted. Mouth finds mouth and my brain nearly stutters to a halt. Kissing John is a lot like lighting a fire, the heat kindling somewhere deep in my belly as the tip of his tongue flicks out over my lips — sparking an intense flame of desire that threatens to consume me in an instant.
A chorus of gunshots signals a definitive end to a lifetime of horrors, as the details of the case fall together into the collective files of my Mind Palace. Madness has been vanquished, no longer able to rear its ugly head at the expense of the sanity of those who have suffered in its evil clutches. The curtain has fallen, the final whistle has blown; the nightmare has ended.
I wrack my brain for a moment but I don't have to wonder for very long. In true John Watson fashion, he's a step ahead of me, throwing everything I considered to be possible into disarray. His fingers intertwine with mine, and I'm reasonably sure my confusion is clear as glass on my face, but he gives nothing away. His expression is blank, a thin veil of assurance the only visible hint to what he's thinking.
Thank you for trucking along with me! From here the plot begins to thicken!! As we go, you will see more and more of the deeper storyline be revealed! The boys are smitten and things are about to start happening! :D I can’t wait to start revealing some of my plans!!
If I had known, would I have returned earlier? No. Maybe. It's hard to say anymore. John has bled into every thought, every fibre of my being. I can't think of anything without the thought starting and ending with him. It's obscene. It kept me going, whilst I was gone, to have him so close, pretend that what we had in those last few months bordered on something more, but I can't tell anymore. Reality and fantasy have melded together, but at least it makes sense now; Mycroft's evasiveness whenever I had asked after John. He was protecting me, because he knew I couldn't maintain myself without the illusion of his love.
Eventually, we are joined by military vehicles — dispatches from Baskerville drawn to the explosion like moths to a flame. Lestrade takes the lead, recounting the case with practised punctuality, warning them about the gas in the hollow. Two officers in uniform question John and I briefly whilst a doctor gives us a quick check over, before driving us home. The ride back to the inn is silent, the air filled with unspoken anxieties. Slowly, I come back to myself. My hearing is the first thing to settle, the ringing dulls until it is merely background noise, and the smell of crisped flesh is flushed from my sinuses. My jaw, which I hadn’t realised was clenched, relaxes, and a rolling wave of exhaustion overwhelms me. I know it’s just the adrenaline leaving my system because I have no desire to sleep.
Something soars in my stomach, and I reach out in answer, wrapping a hand around his wrist and pulling him towards me. John finally turns, and the look on his face sends a shiver down my spine. He is so open, vulnerability painted across his features, a shadow of fear dancing behind his eyes. The underbelly of humanity may haunt John’s dreams, but he is petrified of this intimacy, this unnamed emotion that he can’t fuck away. I don’t know whoever made him feel this way, who convinced him that he is broken for wanting this, but I desperately hope I never meet them.
With only a brief hesitation and fleeting fear of the unexpected, I climb in next to him, turning with one hand under my head to watch him. Even in sleep, he seems troubled, dark shadows hanging beneath his eyes, and a small furrow on his brow. I desperately want to reach out and wipe it away, soothing the troubled thoughts with the pad of my thumb, but, as I always do, I refrain.
Those words had plagued me all the way home, and after a while, I convinced myself that they were empty; just one last power play. I had bested her, and now she owed me her life. She couldn’t be comfortable with that. Her final words must have been her last stab at taking back control — putting me in my place.
Something about his voice sounds off, but I leave him be, scanning the room for any stray items and packing them back away in my bag. We’ve not been in here enough to spread out properly, but I want to be fully packed away, ready to leave early the next morning. As fascinating as the case has been, I am ready to return to the safety of London.
If I want John Watson, this is how I have him. A one night stand steeped in fear and denial. I have to be okay with that.
He’s ashamed of admitting that we’re more than just bodies — more than just strangers coming together in the night. And that’s — fine. I can’t push — can’t make him face something he doesn’t want to, no matter how much I want it. And I want
There's something not right, some part of her I can't quite put my finger on, but in the heat of the moment, I can't work out what it is. It's unimportant.
“Is that what you want?” I murmur, my hand stilling on his back, frozen with uncertainty.  His eyes drift to the carpet as he seems to consider the question.
It was the tacked on "please" that caught John's attention, and he smirked triumphantly. Even though he'd lost the battle, he'd still won the war. Being the proper soldier that he was, he couldn't resist the urge to draw the sensation out for just a moment longer. "Hmm, I like the sound of that," he mused. "Say 'please' one more time then, yeah?"
“Will you — “ He gulps, and for a second, I’m not sure he’s going to finish the sentence. “— Will you hold me?”
'Had Irene been right? Was John Watson truly so jealous that he would break his own code of honour in order to recapture something only he thought to have claimed? I brush the thought from my mind; just because he is jealous does not mean that he wishes to be more than what we are.'
“Tea?” I ask as I strip off my coat, carefully hanging it on the hook by the door, taking John’s as he passes it to me. The question sounds small in the space between us, a poor substitute for declarations of trust or expressions of gratitude.
“John,” I whisper across the pillow, studying the lines of his face and wishing I could see what was happening in that war-torn brain. The cases; each hair raising case around London, I know about. I can make those nightmares easier. But his life before me, the scorching heat and flying bullets of Afghanistan, that’s a part of his life I’ll never understand. There’s a gaping hole in my knowledge of John Watson — a considerable portion of his life that I will never know about. I don’t mind that, normally. I never want him to see the part of my past I keep hidden away; my messy spiral further and further into addiction. But on nights like this, I wish I could make him feel slightly less alone. I wish I could analyse every memory in his head, pull apart each moment and deduce exactly what he needs to feel safe. But I can’t.
John Watson gives a glimpse inside his personal life, dances with Sherlock, and becomes an unexpected threat to the Blackwater pack. Sherlock is keen and so is he, but a storm is on the rise whether they like it or not...
This is a game where only he knows the rules. I can’t ask, not outright. We had never spoken about it, never asked for anything. He had taken what he wanted, pausing only long enough to check we were on the same page. But there was no verbal confirmation — nothing as concrete as conversation, just subtle nods and moans of pleasure. But, something changed in that instant, something that I must have missed the first time through. John’s eyes lingered on me for a moment as I glared at him, clearly daring him to deny me what I wanted, yet the denial never comes.
I tell myself, placing all of my attention on John. His hands are on me now: one cradled against the nape of my neck, one curved expertly around my hip. The pads of his fingers elicit little shocks of pleasure all over my skin as they begin to pry my clothing from my body.
"Isn't that lovely?" Sherlock mused, his voice dripping with arousal. "It seems the 'good doctor' has made friends with the Adler woman, after all… now, tell me, John… would you prefer to be the one doing the flogging or would you rather be the one getting flogged? I'm rather flexible, either way, so…"
Everything returned to normal after the showdown with Moriarty. John and I stayed in our separate bedrooms, no lingering hint of intimacy between us. I tried, against my better judgement, to elicit some sort of a reaction; wandering around the flat in nothing but a sheet in the hopes that John would abandon his steely self-restraint. It didn’t work — John barely batted an eyelid, only dropping his careful mask when we were summoned to the palace. Even then, it was not my nakedness that unsettled him, but the very location we were in. Either he has trained himself well to hide any hints of attraction, or he truly didn’t care who it was that night when he entered my room. I was just within easy reach — a warm body to keep the loneliness at bay.
We stand, dazed, for what feels like hours — watching the moor burn in front of us. John stays glued behind me, his steady breathing keeping me tethered to the ground beneath my feet.  My ears ring with the echoes of the blast, every nearby noise sounding far away, as if I’m underwater. It almost feels like being high — senses are both heightened and dulled at the same time, accompanied by a numb dissociation. Except instead of the brief moment of euphoric bliss, all I can feel is a sickening sense of dread, vibrating through my skin.
A low growl broke through John's subconscious and he shifted his gaze to Sherlock's face. A look of pure ecstasy seemed to light his features; even without seeing his eyes, John knew the detective well enough to know that he'd already figured this one out, as well.
Sherlock’s exasperation mounted as he bucked his hips and he let the clever mask of control slip for the briefest of moments. "Oh for fuck’’s sake, John… please!"
At first, a fresh wave of jealousy washes over me as the memory twists in my mind’s eye, and I fight the urge to bite my lip. John does it for me, however, and the soft moan that slips from my throat seems to surprise us both. Is this what it felt like for her? Is this what it felt like for Sarah to have John Watson lavishing his full attention on her? A small part of me can’t help but wonder, if I hadn’t brushed off John’s obvious — yet completely ridiculous — attempt at flirting on the night we met, would it have been me that night on the sofa with him after the Black Lotus kidnapping?
I finally lifted up my coat, slowly threading my arms through and shrugging it over my body. I turned to leave, uninterested in continuing the conversation. Despite her reassurance, she was close to Moriarty, and I had no intention of revealing that level of personal information to someone who would ultimately use it to their own ends.
It takes a while, but eventually, he drifts back to sleep. I make no effort to disentangle myself, despite my arms beginning to cramp. I am scared that if he wakes the spell will be broken; he’ll leave my arms and never return. And even after all the horror’s we’ve seen today, that is the thing that terrifies me the most.
I swallow thickly, battling the demons fighting to break free inside of me. He can't know; I don't want to put this on him if I don't have to. I've done enough as it is. "John, don't —" I begin, but it's no use. He's already gripping my hips, manhandling me into a position to turn me into the light so he can see.
A deep chuckle filled the room and Sherlock grinned. Even with the blindfold on, John knew the mischievous gleam in his eyes was still there. "John, the first item you used -- the feather, that was the first item you'd picked up for your collection. That was roughly five weeks ago… so, figuring that you've collected items from the last few cases that I've had -- which has been steady with one a week to keep me occupied, I can easily deduce that you've been able to collect five items, one from each case that we've been on, including the feather."
I'd been expecting this. Oh, I had lied to Mycroft, pretending I thought everything would go back to normal, but I knew we would be far from it. I had realised that John would be angry; I knew that the relationship we'd had before would have changed. But I never understood just how different things would be. There was still a part of me that longed for more. There had been hope; that singular kiss in the inn had been a promise of something deeper, the tentative dip of a toe into water. All the way to the restaurant, I told myself that once John got over the fact I had lied, once he understood that I had only died for him, then perhaps we could be more.
We know you've all been waiting quite a while for this one but we hope it's well worth the wait!! ♥️ Thank you for sticking with us and being so patient!! We are so excited with the way this fic has been received and are grateful to you all for reading!! 🥰
John and Sherlock go their separate ways; both facing John's deployment with their own doubts and insecurities. Will the other people in their lives make things better or worse?
I refuse to allow boyhood fantasies to cloud my better judgment; to John Watson, sex is just sex. I’d already established that the first time. No matter how intense and deep my fascination with him may be, I have to remember that John is a doctor. My absence and perceptual rendezvous with The Woman is enough to trigger warning signals in anyone with a medical background and half a brain. John is a man of practical medicine and safe sex practices are an absolute must in his book. This ‘possessive behaviour’, this suspected exhibition of a ‘desire to reclaim me’, is about as legitimate as my brother’s claim to know absolutely nothing about Russia outside of common knowledge.
Special thanks once again to the amazing @MsScarlet for the amazing job as my Beta! I know it’s a lot for her to take in and she does a fantastic job!!
Finally, filled with frustration, my lips and tongue betray me, and my restlessness bursts from its dam. I don’t beg, not quite, but the desperate plea coats every word. My brain triggers some sort of ridiculous self-defence mechanism, inserting its own form of code for what I really want to say, and interpreting his response in its own cruel and destructive way.
Yet, John was jealous of Irene. I wasn’t expecting it — I’m not sure he’s even aware of it — but it’s there. A simmering possessiveness that surfaces each time she flirted at me. I considered flirting back, only a little, just to see his reaction.
“I thought I was going to lose you.” He says into my collarbone. My chin rests on his head, hair tickling my skin. It’s an odd yet welcome sensation, having him in my arms like this. I’m not quite sure what it means, but I don’t have much time to think about it before the moment shifts.
With a brief warning, I switch on the tap behind me and place the plug in the drain. Warm water swirls around his feet, staining his skin light pink with the heat. I take the soap and flannel from the glass shelf above the sink, wetting the bar into a lather and slathering it over the fabric. Delicately, I brush it over John’s skin, testing the water now and again to make sure it isn’t too warm. I clean every inch of his skin, imagining that as I do, I am washing him free of the horrors that plague him. I am reminded of his touch, the silent slide of hand on skin, wiping me clean of any trace of the Woman. This is different, there isn’t a veil to be lifted, no shadow of sexual tension, but I mimic the motions he made all those months ago, talking all the while. I lose track of what I’m saying, focussing too much on the task in hand, and it could be nonsense for all I know. But I continue, offering John a lifeline from the terrors of his mind.
A deep sense of confusion brings a furrow to my brow. Who could have left it? My brain sifts through the usual suspects in a whirlwind of thoughts, but no one seems to fit the bill. It most certainly isn’t Mycroft; God knows he prefers to make a show of things when he has something new to rub under my nose. But, if not Mycroft…then who?
Shaking his head, John chuckled softly, conceding the first point to his lover just as he'd known he would. "Alright, I'll give you that one," he said, letting the edge of the feather drift lazily down Sherlock's abdomen once again before brushing past the ever-swelling erection pressing flat against his belly. "I don't see how that's not cheating though, if you watched me collect it."
A well-timed growl rumbles around my cock, sending a mind-blowing vibration throughout my entire body and I’m surprised at the broken whimper that leaves my throat. It’s low and needy and not like me at all but John’s fingers dig into my hip as he bobs his head even faster. I can feel the back of his throat as the tip of my cock brushes repeatedly against it and my hips falter in their own thrusts, calling to question when I had even begun to move them in the first place.
I shower and shave, exiting my room only half an hour after John, but it’s enough to wash the slate clean. John doesn’t even act as if anything is different — he types up the case with his usual fervour, questioning me occasionally on details he’s forgotten. He chats to Mrs Hudson when she pops her head around the door, acting as if everything is normal. As if nothing has changed. Later that night, he pads up the stairs to his room like he hadn't spent the last night in mine. Like I don’t know what his face looks like when he orgasms; as if I haven’t memorised how he reacts to each touch of my hand on his cock.
For a moment, I study the image before picking it up, but I’m still unsure of its sudden significance. That is…until I turn it over.
I moan breathlessly and my eyes threaten to slip closed but I fight to keep them open. I don’t want to miss a single thing as John’s hand works the lather over my length, sharp huffs and quiet growls filling the space between us. The soap works as a brilliant lubricant, allowing my cock to slip and slide through the tunnel of his fist and I feel the subtle drop in my mental capabilities as all of the blood in my body redirects to my groin. It’s amazing, though slightly alarming, all at once but I remind myself that, even if the circumstances are less than respectable, I am with John and I can trust him with my body as well as my mind. That I am certain of, at least, even if I can not say for sure what his motives are…
Also, special thanks to @CarmillaCarmine and @Thinkanddoodle-batch <3 Carmilla's edits and both of your support help me to keep this going! Thank you for being the best friends I could ever hope for! So much love your way!
It is easier when there is a case. I can channel my relentless energy into something specific — my jumpiness chalked up to the adrenaline of the case. In the moments between, it is unbearable, not just the sexual tension, but the need to be close, to hold him to me. But he would never allow that. So I pace, and I sulk, and I harpoon dead pigs. Because I’m Sherlock Holmes, and that is what I do.
“Completely dark,” Sherlock replied, tilting his head from side to side -- no doubt testing the heightened sensitivity of his hearing. His smirk had faded but a small smile played over his lips in its place. “Interesting how I can’t see you, but I can still tell by the subtle hitch of your breathing that your libido is currently cursing your refractory period.”
The soft rustle of clothing being removed gives me a brief moment of warning before the shower door slides open, revealing the extremely memorable form of John’s naked body as he steps in to join me. It’s curious, though not altogether surprising, but I still don’t understand the sudden invasion of privacy. As noted before, nudity has never been anything more than human nature to me, but I am, however, under the impression that it is in bad form to interrupt someone’s personal bathroom engagements uninvited. I’d been scolded for it enough myself when John had first moved into the flat, after all.
Jealousy comes in all shapes and sizes. It takes on multiple forms, manifesting itself between friends and lovers alike without ever batting an eye. It weaves its way into families, terrorising siblings and conquering great dynasties with a single swipe of its poisoned talons. It is ruthless in its pursuits and knows no bounds.
And here's Chapter Five!! So excited to share and start the main points of the plot! Something major will be happening in each chapter from here on out, so I really hope you're all ready for the rollercoaster of events that is about to take place! Thank you all for sticking with me thus far and for being so kind!
“You were thinking.” A pyjama-clad arm still covers his eyes, but I see a strained smile creep out from under his sleeve. “Alright, you have questions.”
He felt rather than saw the way his lover's brows knit together for a moment, obviously needing a moment to think this one through. Sherlock was too bright to be tricked, that was evident from the start and John knew it, but that wasn't the point of the game. Even with John's own competitive side fighting to break free of its constraints, he knew this whole wager had been about teasing the man at his mercy before finally giving him the pleasure he deserved.
Tentatively, he wraps his arms around my waist and rests his forehead against my chest, letting out a long sigh into the creases of my pyjamas.
A delicately-timed F-sharp rings out of the tinny speakers, and John rests the phone on his chest and closes his eyes. I’m confused for a moment, unsure what I’m witnessing, until the rest of the track starts to play.
He's seething. I can see it in his eyes — all the hurt and anger mixed with some pent up nameless emotion that I've yet to identify, even after all this time. It's not something I can fully grasp, but it's there all the same, just as it always was, bubbling beneath the surface and giving me a feeling in return that I can't seem to push away no matter how hard I try. The look he's giving me isn't as possessive as it used to be; no, this time, it's different. There's something new there, something etched deep into his features, something almost broken. Have his eyes always looked this sunken in?
"Mmm, soft yet stiff, judging by the drag of the textured edge over my skin," the detective observed, a serious expression forming on his lips. "But there's something pliable about it as well. You handle it delicately, almost as if you're afraid to damage it and -- if memory serves me correctly -- I actually saw you pick this up nearly a month ago."
"Alright, I'll start with this one and work my way up," he announced, keeping his voice soft but clear. A subtle nod from Sherlock signalled his consent and John touched the tip of the feather to the slight concave dip of Sherlock's belly. A little shiver rippled through his fiancé at the touch but Sherlock relaxed almost instantly as John trailed the feather up his chest, swirling it teasingly around one nipple. A hum of approval blanketed in a soft sigh broke the silence and John couldn't help feeling proud of himself.
Ever so carefully, John took a black box from the bottom of the side table drawer. The various items he’d collected over the last few weeks rustled as he set them down on the bed and he tried not to think about the fact that Sherlock could probably deduce them already. ‘Annoying prick...‘ John thought fondly as he rolled his eyes. He opened the box and surveyed the small collection in front of him before dumping them out on the bed.
“Okay. Very well, it can be — that.” It’s not okay, but I don’t know how to say that. How do you admit that the intimacy you shared was more than the other wants it to be? If he wasn’t emotionally invested, if he was just using me to get off — then how could I ask him to stay?
As if on cue, John flinches in his sleep, his body twitching at an unseen terror. I sit up, whispering his name. I’m hesitant to wake him directly; experience has taught me that it’s not a good idea to wake a war-vet from a nightmare. John forgot about that night, so I blamed that black-eye on an experiment gone wrong. He rarely questions that excuse.
Sherlock’s arrogant little smirk was enough to kick John’s own dominant streak up a notch as he sat up, gesturing to the bed with the jerk of his head. “Switch places with me and let me tie this around your head,” he said, unfolding the silk cloth. “I’ll put this on then you can lie down.”
have friends. I have never been the type to be surrounded by people. John is the exception, not the rule. But, in truth, I’ve never seen him as a friend, because in reality, he is so much more. He always has been. To say John is just a friend is to say that Bach is just music. It is so much more than that. A fierce uniqueness that defies everything that I have ever convinced myself to believe in.
A swift bout of dizziness threatens to overtake me as I realise just how close he is — just how wonderful his tongue feels against my dampened skin — but I try to calm my thoughts. It almost startles me as John’s hand brushes the wet curls from my temple, rinsing the shampoo from my hair, before his hand slips past me to grab the bar of soap and my curiosity piques. His fingers flex with a concentrated effort and, before I can fully register what is happening, he brings the soap to my shoulder and presses it against my skin in one fluid motion.
What had she meant anyway? What use had it been throwing my own words back at me like an arrogant adversary watching and waiting for me to become the bane of my own existence?
“You’re not always there when they happen. God forbid, you’re actually asleep some nights. So, one time when you played, I sat on the stairs and recorded you, for when I need it.” He takes a deep breath. “For when I need you.”
Once dry, we shuffle into the bedroom, where I gently dress him in his pyjamas and lead him over to the bed. Without protest, he sinks beneath the covers, shutting his eyes as soon as his head touches the pillow. It isn’t long before his breathing becomes shallow, and he falls into a silent sleep.
The playful grin on Sherlock's tired face gave John pause before his feelings could suffer too terribly from the insult. With a soft chuckle, he did exactly as he was asked, settling down in Sherlock's arms, his head resting just over his lover's heart. It was a simple request but the weight of vulnerability behind the action was not lost on John. So much had happened between them over the years that it was hard to believe that one had ever existed without the other. It was the gentle thump of the detective's heart that grounded John in ways he never thought possible and it amazed him how very few words were actually needed to convey his emotions.
Special thanks to thinkanddoodle_batch and CarmillaCarmine for their never-ending support and for listening to me rant about this! ♥️ I am super grateful for you both!!
The clink of the handcuffs spurred him on and, within moments, John had his head between Sherlock’s thighs, nuzzling lazily at the crease of his balls. A heavy groan filled the room, giving John the motivation he needed to trail his tongue up to the base of his lover’s shaft. It was exhilarating, having Sherlock at his mercy for so long. Add to that the beginning and desperation that comes with having a naked consulting detective on the edge for roughly an hour and John had himself quite a lovely thing indeed. He dragged his tongue up the hardened curve of Sherlock’s shaft, relishing the way his breath hitched in his throat and the sound made him smile. The tip of his tongue hovered briefly over the detective’s slit just as a ragged moan broke through the quiet of the room.
John's cheeks burned with arousal at the obvious struggle for dominance. As much as he wanted to control the entirety of the situation at hand, he couldn't deny the energy still buzzing between them and he conceded to his lover's terms with a curt nod. "You're on..."
John is off to war and Sherlock gets the first of many letters. In the meantime, the Alpha is called in to assist Scotland Yard on a case that is about to turn Sherlock's world upside down.
"Well, I'm changing that, now," the doctor quipped, setting the flogger aside and pulling something else from the bedside table drawer. The heavy clink of metal supplied a beautiful image to John's mind of Sherlock spread out on the bed, his hands cuffed above his head as John trailed the flogger over the plush curve of his lover's arse. It was almost too much to think about in the heat of the moment, but John tamped it down yet again.
I note the thought for further analysing; something was given to me, that much is clear, but it doesn’t explain the way my body is reacting now. Knowing that what I thought I had seen was nothing but an elaborate illusion, I should be able to dismiss the fear and anxiety lingering over me, but I can’t. My mind has been compromised, and the more I think about it, the more I begin to realise just what has clouded my judgment.
I could practically hear the smile in her voice, but I refused to turn around; to yield that level of control over to her.
He flicks the lid open with his thumb in a rather fluid motion, almost as if he’s done it a million times —
John's own excitement threatened to burst out of his chest but he kept his cool. "For every item you guess right, you get a point... For every item you guess wrong, I get a point... The one with the most points wins. If I win, I go off and take my shower and you have to wait until tomorrow morning to claim your reward... But, if you win -- "
His hair stuck up in all directions and the little pang of affection that shot through John's chest forced a knowing smile to his lips. "So, I did all right then?" he asked, allowing his cheeky side a bit of freedom in the easiness between them.
“Right, fine. Guess you’re just not saying anything,” he huffs, turning his back to me for a moment, which was becoming quite the customary alternative to discussing anything remotely related to emotions. Another sigh, another huff. “Honestly, it’s… It’s fine… You keep your secrets, I’ll keep mine.”
He’s stroking himself in slow, lazy passes, wringing the remains of his orgasm from his cock as it pools at the edges of his foreskin and he brushes it away with his thumb. I slump against the wall in a haze of post-coital bliss as I watch him and I can’t help wondering what he must taste like. I’ve only ever tasted my own — for experimental purposes, of course — so the thought of tasting another’s, John’s in particular, opens up a whole new catalogue of references in my mind. Would he have a tangy, bitter taste? Or something more akin to a sweet yet salty combination? The possibilities are endless really, especially with the theory that your previous food intake determines the flavour and thickness, but I quickly let the idea slip from my mind as I feel John’s eyes on me.
The only person that can ever derail my train of thought; the only person in the world that pulls my emotions to the surface, dragging them out and flaunting them for everyone around me to see. The only person that can hijack my brain in the middle of a case, filling up every nook and cranny with unrealistic fantasies just as I’d experienced that very morning. The only person I had ever worried about hurting; the only person in the world that I’d ever sworn to protect, even at the cost of my own life. The only person who had ever been able to distract me from the work…
Instead, he let out a little huff of irritation before sniffing in defiance. "No matter… it won't take me long to beat your little game anyway, so just carry on."
Sherlock's dreams continue to haunt him as he struggles to keep his mind clear for the case at hand and a conversation with Molly gives him a sense of peace.
With growing exasperation, Sherlock let out an irritated sigh. The situation was obviously beginning to wear on him and, although John didn't admit it aloud, he couldn't deny it was a welcome change from his usual arrogance. "Oh, for God's sake, forget your bloody list, John... I won your game now give me your mouth… Please!"
His callouses catch slightly on the rough edges of my scars as he lets his hand drop back down to his side, but I don't move. I stay silent, unsure of what's supposed to happen next. I hadn't expected him to find out like this. If I'm honest, I'd never expected him to find out at all. I'd never once given my own condition much thought beyond the intense and burning desire to return home to him, so in the moment, I'm at a loss. What's supposed to happen now that he knows? Now that he's seen?
Even after the second time, washing each other in the shower, I wanted more, but I was afraid to ask. I knew what the answer would be. So I tried to shut my feelings away, compartmentalise myself to stop my affection bleeding into every action. I was unsuccessful. My body is like a magnet, gravitating towards him whilst he stays motionless across the room.
"Fuck… close… John," Sherlock panted, gasping for breath and squeezing his eyes tightly shut. His pulse thundered through his body as his thighs squeezed tightly around John's head. The quickened thump-thump-thump of his pulse echoed in John's ear where the skin was pressed flush to his ear.
In a particularly dry spell, I run out of cases to keep my mind occupied. Each cell in my body screams for him, simultaneously shouting for the mental stimulation of a case, and it is taking all my willpower not to sink to my knees and beg him to let me close again. Not just his body, though God knows I long for it, but his tenderness, the careful, devoted attention he gave me in the moments he had allowed himself to submit.
The game he'd organised had done the trick, heightening Sherlocks senses to an unbelievably sensitive state, but now he really needed him to let go. He needed him to relax and surrender every conscious thought to his arousal. With a gentle touch, John let his freehand stroke reassuringly over Sherlock's hip, brushing past the boundary of comfort that was practically non-existent between them now.
Thank you all for you warm acceptance of the prologue and first chapter of my baby. This story is going to be very in depth and I appreciate your kindness and patience as it unfolds! I’m so grateful you’re joining me on this ride and I hope it can live up to your expectations! John shows his smiling face in this chapter so I hope you all enjoy!! 😘
Not a single word posed a question but John couldn't fight the soft smile that creased his features. He teased the tip of the feather over Sherlock's nipple once more before nodding slowly -- not that Sherlock could see him. "Ah, so you have been paying attention then," he chided, smirking playfully. "Alright, so what is it then?"
Everything between us seems to come rushing back, slotting easily into place. Groin slides against groin, erections meeting through layers of fabric, settling into a needy rhythm accented with eager huffs of ecstasy. My fingers work effortlessly to free his belt before trailing down to his zip and I'm surprised at the sudden 'riiiip' that echoes in the quiet sitting room as John's impatience wins the battle with my shirt. Buttons scatter in all directions, clattering to the floor and ricocheting off of various objects with an exciting vigour, and for a moment, it's almost as if I had never left… until his hands find the devastation that now covers my back and sides.
I punch the pillow flat and turn over, growling into the fabric. John Watson, what are you doing to me? This is exactly what I didn’t want, the constant self-doubt and second-guessing. I have always assumed love to be a dangerous disadvantage. Here is the proof. I am slipping, letting myself be distracted from the bigger picture by a sexually ineffectual man. I should have learnt, by now, that I cannot afford such liberties. Irene was a cautionary tale of what happens when sentiment corrodes your judgement. She could have had anything — if she’d set her password to any random combination she would have walked away with everything she’d worked for. Instead, she let herself be seduced by the game. I have no delusions that she actually wanted me, she merely wanted to see how far she could push before I’d break, but she was cocky; too sure of her ability to seduce me into submission.
I don’t sleep that night. When John walks back down the stairs the next morning, I’m at the window, idly picking at the strings of my violin. He comments on it, but I’m not listening, lost in the depths of my mind palace. If that was everything — if I will never again see the stretch of John’s bare skin beneath me; hear his breath hitch in his chest as I trail kisses down his throat, then I will damn well memorise every second of it. There is now a box in John’s wing, filled with data, every sound he made and each sensation of his lips on mine. It’s tucked between the catalogue of his jumpers and the list of all his favourite foods.
I think, hurriedly flicking back through my archived memories of John, wondering if I’ve missed something so terribly obvious, but, in the end, I find nothing. The chilling covenant hangs in the air like some sort of passive-aggressive threat, dangling over me with a sharp promise that I will later regret letting it go so easily.
The chilly liquid pools generously in the centre of my palm, yet, even as a shiver makes its way through my own body, I still can’t take my eyes off of John. He’s beautiful like this, like some sort of mind-boggling enigma that I could explore every nook and cranny of and still never understand completely. I still don’t understand the meaning behind this unexpected yet fortunate turn of events, but I force the lingering shadows of doubt from my mind. From the subtle twist of his wrist on the upstroke to the gentle flick of his thumb over his slit, John Watson demands my undivided attention and he’s going to get it.
Sherlock and John take a walk and get to know each other, but someone takes an interest in their budding new friendship.
He takes his time preparing me for his final intentions, coaxing broken whimpers and guttering moans from my lips before finally pressing into me with a breathy moan of his own. It's slow and careful this time, an honourable act in the midst of all of the indecency that lies between us, and it's unlike anything I've ever experienced. His arms are wrapped around me, holding me close. The insatiable hunger and bruising possessiveness have faded, leaving in its wake a devastatingly raw and passionate intensity that I can't explain. He's a force to be reckoned with like this with the slow but steady pace of his hips combined with the deep and sensual slide of his lips against mine. It's more than I ever thought I'd have the good fortune of knowing, but I have to confess that it only leaves me with one earth-shattering conclusion: the way John Watson fucks is nothing compared to the way that he makes love.
I glance up to meet his gaze and his expression surprises me. His navy blue eyes have shifted in colour, taking on a slate-grey appearance as they search my face for something I am not quite aware of. He definitely looks tense, even though he’s just come, which leads me to wonder if he is even aware of it at all.
Pressing a sensual kiss over Sherlock's beating heart held more love and affection than any words he could possibly utter but still, he allowed his lips to linger in silent vigil for the men they used to be. Without their own tragedies guiding their futures, neither of them would be where they are today and John knew it. He closed his eyes as a warm purr rumbled in Sherlock's chest -- a hum of approval even if John was getting overly sentimental -- and the sound settled over him comfortingly. No words could express the love he felt for the man beside him, so he didn't bother to try. They didn't need words of affirmation, no poetic "I love you"s or flowery expressions. It was just the two of them against the rest of the world, and John found that he didn't mind that idea one bit.
“Can I touch you?” The unexpected question comes out as a half-whisper; part plea, part promise. His hand reaches out to grab mine, permitting me to enter his space. Without thinking, I pull his hand up to my lips, trailing the ghost of a kiss across the skin. My other hand moves to rest on his back, drawing steady circles through the fabric of his jacket. He hadn't even stopped to remove it. I internally curse again, berating my stupidity. I should have seen this coming. I should have been there for him; given him the safe space to go through this together, rather than making him feel as if he had to hide away to face his demons alone like it was something shameful.
“It was like this in Afghanistan, sometimes. After a big battle, we’d all come back to camp, drinking and playing card games, not talking about the things we’d seen but knowing no-one wanted to be the first one to fall asleep. Something about almost dying means you need to prove you’re alive, y’ know?”
Sherlock's eyes widened a fraction, and it's then that John knew that his curiosity had definitely piqued. "I see... Go on?"
"A rose," Sherlock moaned, his arousal clearly spiking with the taboo realisation of what was being pressed against his skin this time. "You clipped a rose from the Queen's private garden…?"
I stand close to the bathroom door, holding my breath and listening for sounds on the other side. Sure enough, I can hear a rhythmic gasping for breath, coupled with the loudness of someone trying not to make a sound. I reach for the handle and find the room unlocked.
“It was imperative that I memorise every detail about our meeting with Moriarty,” I lie. I have spent embarrassingly little time thinking about the consulting criminal. I should — no doubt this will not be the last time we see him, but I can’t bring myself to think about anything other than John’s hand fisted around the both of us.
my brain supplies, conjuring up scenarios featuring combat boots and military fatigues; dog tags clinking together against John’s bare chest as I sink to my knees in front of him — the scar from the bullet wound that nearly killed him marring his perfectly pale skin. It’s hard to stop the scenario from running wild, my throat aching from the stretch in order to accommodate his ridiculous size; his hands fisted in my hair in order to hold me in place.
Months pass, cases blur into each other, and I almost forget about the night spent in my bed, tangled together. Almost. Nothing changes; neither of us bring it up, and I fully expect that it will never happen again. Until it does.
His eyelids start to droop, the body’s natural reaction to being tense for so long. It’s concerning yet comforting all at once, and I can feel my fears beginning to recede. Once all the soap suds have been washed from his skin, I drain the bath and help him to his feet.
“Only you would say it like that.” He smirks, reaching a hand under his pillow to rest his head against. “I’m — I dunno. I feel weird. Like I can still feel it beneath my skin. I didn’t—” he sighs, his voice dropping to a murmur as if admitting defeat. “I couldn’t be alone.”
“Listen, about last night—“ He takes a breath; I hold mine. “If you want that to be everything — just two people finding comfort in each other — that’s fine. It can stay in this room.” I frown. It doesn’t sound like a question directed at me; rather an assurance to himself that this is all it was. ‘
Another gentle tap of my hip has me turning toward the water again and John’s hands work to rinse me clean, stroking the hard length of my cock in a steady rhythm that sends yet another shiver down my spine. He’s careful but sure of himself, much like that first night, but I’m still painfully aware that this time is very different. He has something new in mind and I can feel it in every swipe of his thumb over my slit, in every slight twist of his wrist as he coaxes me closer and closer to the edge.
His mouth opens and closes several times, and it makes my stomach lurch. I can only imagine what I've put him through, how he must have felt being kept in the dark like that. Even if I had been surprised by the violence that had manifested, I should have anticipated the fallout. I want to apologise, tell him I'm sorry for everything. For all of the heartache and misery that I've caused him, but I can't. We don't have that sort of connection, and we certainly don't talk about emotions; we never have, so why start now?
Up until this point, John has been very discreet about his military background. It isn’t that he refuses to talk about it, but he is never particularly forthcoming on the subject. I let him be, never pressing for more information than he is willing to give, no matter how curious I become, but I have never realised just how much I
With a tilt of my head, I open my mouth to speak — to question his intentions — but John shakes his head, raising a finger to his lips. “You didn’t want to talk earlier; I don’t want to talk now,” he says gruffly, raking his gaze over my body and sliding the door closed behind him as I move forward a bit to make room. His eyes are hard and cold, filled with something new —
I swallow thickly, a silent nod my only acknowledgement of his invitation. As we climb the stairs, my thoughts flutter briefly to the woman — Mary — from the restaurant. Her blue eyes blaze in the back of my mind, judging me for whatever it is that I am about to partake in, but I close my eyes and will her disapproval away. Deep down, I know that she doesn't understand the complexity of my relationship with John. I know she isn't aware of the intimacy we've shared, but still, she threatens everything I've fought my way back for.
“Oh, John, do get on with it…” Sherlock whined, his voice coming out half anxious, half blissed out. “I won't last much longer either way.”
“No, thank you. I think — I think I want to go to sleep.” My heart sinks a little; not ready to be alone just yet. I nod, lingering in the kitchen as John makes his way up the stairs. The creaking of the boards beneath his feet sound loud in the narrow stairwell, and I count each of them until John is safely in his room.
Without hesitation, Sherlock's response came loud and clear as his own neediness threatened to betray him. "Your mouth," he answered, shifting slightly so that the chain of the handcuffs strained as he pulled it taut.
"Nope," John huffed, pulling the flogger back and batting the other man's hand away. "That's cheating. You can feel with your body but not your hands."
With John's inevitable deployment looming, Sherlock's subconscious catches him off guard, John Watson surprises him, and things work out better than he could have ever imagined. How did he ever get so lucky?
I suck in a cautious breath, nodding slowly as my back hits the cool tile wall. I shouldn’t want this, but I do; I shouldn’t tolerate the invasive behaviours, the over-sexualised self-indulgence, but I anticipate the slow drag of his calloused fingertips over the sharp edge of my hip bone. The barest brush of his hand scorches my skin in a tantalising thrill of desire and I bend to his will. There is something different behind his touch this time, something raw and animalistic, something I’d only ever dreamed of having.
We stay in silence for what feels like hours, just listening to each other's breathing. I’m desperate to close the painful gap between us, but I don’t want him to think I’m searching for sex. I don’t want that now, and he’s in no position to give it. There is just an overwhelming urge to pull him into me, to remind him that he is safe.
My brain fights to bring me back to my senses but I have to let go of my fears. If I have any hope at all of recovering what we've lost, I can't allow my walls to spring back up in an act of premature defence when I am the only one in the wrong. I have to let him back in, even if it kills me. I have to press myself to obey his silent command, even if it means doing so with closed eyes. The feeling it gives me to know that I am unable to meet his gaze for fear of falling deeper under his spell is terrifying, but I lock it away as we fall together.
I brush my teeth with the bathroom door open; John sat on his phone by the door. For a long time, I’m sure he’s going to act as if nothing happened. Soldering on, like he always does. We crossed a line last night. Not in the initial comfort, but in the moments after, the whispered conversation and gentle touches. I push down the disappointment, berating myself for even hoping that this time would be different. It is queer affection, something John can’t bring himself to face.
An untimely introduction; an inappropriate joke at the expense of John's facial hair; a furious fist in my face. That is how the evening goes. We hop, venue to venue, neither of us bridging the gap, unable to fully explain our points of view. All the while, she sits and watches, an unwelcome spectator to our pain.
“You were kidnapped and strapped to explosives. Even for us, that’s not a normal day at the office. And you’re a veteran. Are you—“ I struggle to find the correct wording.“—emotionally okay?” The words feel thick in my mouth. It’s not what I mean to say. I want to ask him if it’s a danger night — if in a few hours I will have to save him from his screams. It’s happened before — nightmares that bleed through into reality. On those nights, I play the violin as loud as I can, trying to rouse him without him realising. Most nights it works, but this is not most nights.
"Christ, I was going to hold off on this since I wanted to surprise you, but after that blissful display of affection, I think you deserve a bit of a reward... See, I've been stockpiling some things I think you'll like," John admitted as he pressed a teasing kiss to Sherlock's lips. He shifted his body a bit to bring the circulation back to his lifeless limbs after what felt like hours cuddled up together. In truth, it had only been a few minutes, but he smiled teasingly as Sherlock's eyebrow quirked and John reached to tug a strip of black silk from under the book on his nightstand. Chewing his lip, he held the cloth up as he turned so the detective could examine it. "I'd planned to let you explore your interest in some of these things later on... But you have to deduce what they are first before I allow myself to go any further. We could even make it a bit of a game, I'd you'd like."
I tug his hair in a quiet, yet gentle warning. I do not know if I am permitted to speak so I don’t, just to be safe. Our entire encounter has once again been completely silent, but it doesn’t bother me. The soft moans and quiet growls are enough to satiate my need for audible data and I am certain that I will be analysing each new sound in turn for days on end.
The thought of the incident floods my cheeks once again. How the hell could one man affect me in so many uniquely different ways? It was unfair really that he should take up so much of my cognitive presence, practically consuming me from the inside out as I, a willing participant in my own demise, lie back and watch it happen. There is nothing that I can do, nothing that I can say to scrub the memory from my mind. It’s there, lodged forever in the crevices of the new wing of my Mind Palace, a wing dedicated in its entirety to John Watson.
"Sherlock, what did they —" the words die on his tongue and he pauses, clearly at odds with himself before clearing his throat. "Nevermind, don't answer that…"
Deep down, I know I can’t dwell on those things now, but it doesn’t make my mind any less anxious. What will he think when he comes upstairs and sees the situation that we’re in? Will he stall, halted by the implication? Will he demand another room? Or will he simply soldier on, as he always does?
He asks the question almost accusingly. His eyes narrow more than I’ve ever seen before, and his brow furrows tightly. It gives his face a more hardened, ‘no-nonsense, stiff upper lip’ sort of characterisation that most British men pride themselves on. If I wasn’t so taken aback by the question, I might have actually found myself in fear of having such a look directed at me, but my mind has nearly spun out of control trying to decide how to react.
I count the steps as I make my way up to our flat, allowing myself a moment of playfulness in the depths of my mind. My thoughts are light and airy, like nothing I’ve experienced before, and the promise of John tagging along behind me, chuckling softly as he always does, fills my heart with an emotion I can’t quite name. It’s a warm and tingly feeling that has me glancing around the sitting room, a desperate fondness washing over me as my gaze settles on the mismatched chairs that have defined us for months. John’s warm dependability and comforting demeanour are echoed in the colours and Union Jack throw pillow, while the importance of intellect and my own desperate need for simplicity in an overly complex world stare back at me from my usual seat.
It’s too busy obsessing over what John would look like standing above me with his hand fisted tightly in my hair, his officer’s voice commanding me into submission. Deep down, I know that I want this before my mind can fully process it. I know that, one day, I want him to play out his army days using me as his subordinate, but, for now, I can’t allow myself to slip that far. For now, I must draw myself back to the realities that await, even if they’re nowhere near as exciting as the things I envision for myself.
He counted the text messages; that was the next sign. All 57 of the ones he heard. I never replied; I had no interest in pursuing her. I still don’t. Now she’s left for good, I have no interest in chasing her down again. She fascinates me; a woman of that intellectual calibre who knows what she wants and isn’t afraid to ask for it, but that’s all. Her powers of seduction would never have worked on me, especially with John so close. Still, it was tempting to give in — let John think there was something more — just to see if he’d react. If he’d let me go, or come back to claim what’s already his.
Chunks of soil and flesh fly in each direction, hitting the ground with muted thumps. Heat rolls forwards in waves, cooking my skin, and I reflexively lift a hand to cover my face. It does nothing to cool the scorching fire. A heavy stench fills the air, and it takes me longer than it should to realise that it’s burning flesh. Henry vomits from somewhere behind us, a wet retching that pulls at my stomach. I swallow it down.
At that moment, I had struggled to keep my face straight, desperately fighting the wave of heat that had surged to my groin. It was then that I’d found myself suddenly feeling very grateful for wearing such a thick coat as part of my regular attire. Even if it hadn’t always been practical, it had proven at that moment to be quite useful at concealing my unexpected, yet very prominent, erection.
I didn’t answer, zipping up my bag with a flourish and grabbing the coat which lay over the bed. I had no interest in continuing this line of questioning. The game was over, she had lost. There was no reason for either of us to pretend that the other held our affections.
Sherlock's cock twitched against his belly as John trailed the rose up and over the shaft and he licked his lips involuntarily. He knew Sherlock had been hard for ages but he'd been more interested in massaging an orgasm out of John before ever concentrating on his own release. That sort of selflessness deserved gratitude in and of itself, nevermind the fact that John wouldn't be able to keep his hands off of Sherlock even if he tried.
Also want to give shout-outs to CarmillaCarmine, MsScarlett, and thinkanddoodle_batch for their encouragement, input, and always being there to kick my ass into gear when I need it most! I couldn't do it without you guys! *blows kisses*
His lips are at my ear, his moustache tickling my skin and he's whispering words I can't comprehend, breaking through even the deepest of boundaries and rewriting the very foundations of my Mind Palace as every thrust of his hips takes me apart. He's never spoken like this before, preferring to stay silent during our encounters but I find that I can't even bring myself to focus on the significance of it. He's moaning and kissing every inch of my skin within his reach and, after what feels like hours, his rhythm begins to falter. My own erection is trapped between my body and the mattress, the perfect combination of friction and pressure, and I can't hold back my tears any longer. Everything he's doing to me triggers an otherworldly emotion, welding our souls together with an unbreakable vow in the stillness of the night.
When I see him sitting there, that small black box on the table in front of him, I deduce exactly what his intentions are. And if I were a better man, I would walk away; leave them to continue their evening in peace.
With a gentle tug of my hand, he casts his gaze up the stairs leading up to his old bedroom and my heart nearly stops. In all our messing about, we've never once crossed the threshold into his room. Every encounter, every kiss, every touch has taken place elsewhere in what I always assumed to be a more neutral environment for him. If the incidents occur outside of his bed, they are more easily swept away. Out of sight, out of mind, if you will. He may not live here anymore, but I can't ignore the significance of what is being offered to me.
Special thanks to my lovely beta, Ms.Scarlet for all the amazing work she does on this little disaster ❤️
It’s a quiet but powerful sound, starting as a low rumble in the depths of his chest before reverberating through my entire body as his lips continue to mouth over the sensitive flesh of my thigh. This is definitely a far cry from the doctor-patient agenda my brain has been so desperately clinging to, but I’m not sure how to process what is actually happening. My heart pounds erratically in my chest and my hands clench and unclench at my sides.
and drizzles some of the gel over his fingers. With a subtle flinch of his thighs tensing from what I assume to be the sudden coolness of the gel, he slicks his cock. The fingers of his left hand close perfectly around the thick base of his shaft and he drags his foreskin up and over his tip before drawing it back down again.
I shove the thoughts to the back of my mind. This is no time for self-flagellation; John deserves all of my attention.
His heavy cock rests in the crease of my thigh, his hips rutting steadily against me, and my body practically sings for him. I surprise myself when my back arches involuntarily, pressing the length of my own erection against John’s belly in a desperate attempt to seek friction, and, once I’ve found it, the world around me seems to tilt upside down.
He'd been slightly confused at first, though it didn't take him long to understand why it had been sent to him. The long leather tendrils of the miniature flogger had nearly made his mouth water the first time he'd pulled it from the box as thoughts of Sherlock writhing beneath him had filled his mind. Consequently, he also couldn't deny the fact that he'd often wondered how the reverse would make him feel. What would it be like to give Sherlock even more control over his body than he already had?
It was John's turn to huff. "Oh I'm well aware, you berk," he teased, a warm sense of affection drawing the sting out of the insult as he sets the feather to the side. "This next one won't be as easy."
The thought dawns on me a moment too late, however, and I don't have time to analyse it before John's body slams into mine. I brace for the impact, flinching in anticipation of yet another fist to the face, but it never comes. John's lips cover mine in a searing kiss instead, nipping and lapping at my bottom lip as his fingers curl into the collar of my bloodstained shirt.
Special thanks to the most amazing writing wives I could ever ask for: CarmillaCarmine, writingoutloud, and enterthetadpole are my absolute lifelines. At one point in my life, I would have said that writing is a solo thing, but these three are proof that it isn't. I don't know how on earth I would be able to write or even post without them looking things over so I am eternally grateful for their support. Thanks for being here for me guys! It's because of you guys that I even have the courage to post this chapter right now, so BIG BIG BIG hugs to all three of you! Love you lots, guys!!
I didn’t think he’d notice I was gone. I spun a lie about tying up loose ends with Mycroft, before catching a flight to Karachi, determined to save the Woman from herself, despite my better judgement. Yet, once again, I am proven wrong.
I stare at the ceiling, wide awake, wishing I could understand what’s going on in his head. Is he in the kitchen now, having the exact same argument with himself? Or has he already forgotten what transpired? Is the taste of me already washed from his mouth, or is he savouring it, waiting for the moment he can have more?
The cab home is silent. What can we say? Thank you for trusting me with your life? For promising to follow me into the depths of oblivion? There’s an invisible line in the sand we crossed months ago. First with Jeff Hope; now with the promise to die at each other’s side with the squeeze of a trigger. There’s a mutual understanding between us — crackling electricity in the spaces between, but I can’t form any words that convey how I feel. Pure facts; that’s what I can do. Give me a crime, and I’ll effortlessly reveal how it took place. Give me emotion, and it’s an entirely different story.
John couldn't help feeling taken aback for a moment, tilting his head to one side as he tried to process the request. "My mouth? But that wasn't one of the --"
Of course… He doesn't need to know the horrors I've faced and I'm grateful that I don't have to answer the questions. I wouldn't know where to start anyway.
He dipped his tongue into Sherlock’s slit, lapping eagerly at the trail of precome pooled in the divot. Another moan, another heavy shudder and John couldn’t wait any longer. He sucked the head of Sherlock’s cock into his mouth and swirled his tongue around the ridge enthusiastically before hollowing his cheeks and taking him in as far as he could.
John unlocks our room, striding straight to the bathroom, the door shutting noiselessly behind him. I peel off my coat, suddenly feeling naked in the room, despite being fully dressed. I hang it carefully on the back of the door, placing my gloves into the pocket beside my torch, and threading my scarf on top of the hook.
When he leaves — sinking into the sofa, hiding behind his laptop — I drop my bag in my bedroom and head straight to the shower. A layer of plane grime coats my skin, and I’m desperate to wash it off. His accusations follow me, occupying my mind as I run through the motions of wetting my hair and working shampoo through the curls. What did he think we were up to? Some sex-fuelled rendezvous in the middle of Pakistan? Surely, he knew me better than that?
"I did, yes," John admitted, feeling a giggle rise in his throat. "While you were whirling around like you always do, you had everyone hanging on your every word as you broke down the flaws in their current security measures. It was interesting, at least, that someone would want to steal an entire rose bush so I figured they must have been quite special."
