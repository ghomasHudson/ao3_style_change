Nebula let out a yell, holding out her arms in a fighting stance when Tony flicked the paper at her.
"Rhodey?"
“Dada!” Peter slapped his hands on Steve’s shoulders excitedly.
Natasha then turned to Carol. “Are we seeing you next month?”
When Tony first laid eyes on his son, he cried. Tears of joy, this time. His baby was the most amazing thing he’d ever seen besides the man next to him. The small boy was the magnificent light Tony didn’t know he needed amidst the darkness of the Snap. He couldn’t believe it. This tiny human being relied on Tony to live. The man promised himself, his baby, and his soon-to-be-husband, that he would take care of them, and he would love them so much they’d get annoyed. Anything for his new, small family.
Tony smiled. “Okay. You should not be wearing that. Your pops doesn’t even know I still have those.”
“Are we expecting any visitors?” Tony asked, picking Peter up in case of an intruder.
“We’re working on it right now.” Natasha reassured.
“A little closer, Bambino.” Tony cheered.
“Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what checks out. So recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time in the shape of a Möbius strip, inverted please.” Tony has been looking at different models for some time now, about 45 minutes.
“As a baby!”
heroes were back. The grass seemed greener, mountains were at their highest, all the grey in the world was gone.
Carol calmed and turned to Natasha. “So you might not see me for a long time.”
“He’s ours, Steve,” Tony sniffed a bit, not bothering to wipe his tears.
Natasha smiled. She was nervous too. But she knew Tony, and he didn't forget about Steve either. He was good at doing that; pretending he forgot, that he doesn't care. It was funny, how Steve was oblivious to the fact that Tony missed him too. On the other hand, she also knew that Tony would need time in order to forgive his former teammate, and former boyfriend. He had been betrayed before, and the aftermath would always end in chaos.
“Morag’s a planet. Quill was a person.”
Tony quickly ran to the living room when he heard Steve yell for him, wondering if they were in danger, hurt, or worse. What he walked in on though, made his worried face turn into a happy one.
The Avengers Compound seemed brighter these days, more full of life. The sun shined like it hadn’t in years, like it knew that Earth’s-no the
He pointed at Carol. “She’s great, by the way. We need you. You’re new blood. Bunch of tired old mules!
Scott, confused, looked between the two men. “I haven’t. I don’t even know what the hell you're talking about.”
“What are you doing up, little mess?” he asked.
“Yes, it’s Scott!” The teenager replied, even more panicked.
Tony walked down the stairs, seeing Steve sketching something in front of the fire. He made his way over to his husband.
“What? By who? Who told you that?” Bruce asked.
"I mean, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection has run its course, thanks to the blue meanie back there. I think you'd like her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we found a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. But its now dead in the water. We're 1,000 lightyears from the nearest 7/11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it.
-----------------------------------------
Tony smiled unsurely. "What do you think about maybe adopting a kid?"
Two hours later when Peter woke up, he looked in the mirror and gasped. He was ripped, like actually ripped. After pinching himself many times, to make sure he wasn't dreaming Peter started freaking out. He wasn't stupid he knew that he should probably tell someone about this, he could possibly be possessed by some weird alien from outer space or something.
"So Peter, while Tony was filling out your paperwork I got your room set up would you like to see it?" Steve questioned.
Hey guys!!!  Ps: This video is where the title comes from :) Enjoy!
FINALLY:
Seve nodded motioning for Tony to keep going.
"Tony you told them!" Steve cringed.
They all sat around the table. Steve learned their names, Natasha aka Black Widow. Clint Barton aka Hawkeye. Thor Odinson aka Thor Odinson. Bruce Banner aka Hulk. Agent Coulson sad that there was going to be one more member of the team- The Avengers, besides Steve. Steve just presumed that they were just late.
"So... what do you wanna do Rogers?" Tony said.
——————————
, he responded and smiled back.
----------------------------
---------------------------------
"For the record, the only reason I'm here is that I was at an interview and it was on the way back to the tower."
"I hope so Thor, I hope so," Tony said leaning into Steve's side and taking Peter's hand once again.
At this point, the talk show host was about to curl up into a ball and die, "You...and Captian Rogers? Are in a relationship? And have a child?"
Steve picked the man up, hands under his thighs and smashed him into the bed hungry. The man- Tony moaned as Steve took his shirt off, revealing a set of abs. Tony took his shirt off, revealing an almost equal set of abs, and a small set of tally marks on his chest. Steve ignored the tattoo and kissed Tony, biting and sucking his lip. Tony fumbled for Steve’s fly and took his pants off. Tony clawed Steve’s bare back, as Steve left a hickey on Tony’s neck and bit his shoulder. Steve reached over Tony to grab a few certain things from his nightstand. Steve lubed up his index and middle finger, sticking the tip of his index into Tony. Tony let out a moan, urging Steve for more. Steve slid his whole finger into Tony as he gasped. Steve moved in and out slowly “M-more,” Tony pleaded to Steve. Steve obeyed adding another finger. Tony moaned as Steve stroked his dick. Steve was hard himself, wanting and needing to enter Tony. “I’m ready,” Tony said, gasping. Steve obliged, feeling his dick throbbing. He pushed the tip into Tony as they both gasped. Tony gripped the sheets as Steve slipped inside him. Steve moaned, feeling Tony’s warmth. Tony nodded, and Steve moved. He fucked Tony hard into the mattress. “I-I’m,” Tony said, as he came over Steve’s chest, Steve followed soon after. They both panted and lay in Steve’s bed still afterward. “Shit,” Tony said, mumbling something about a board meeting, “Call me,” Tony said giving Steve a business card. Steve nodded as he watched Tony gather his clothes and exit his apartment. Steve checked the time after Tony was gone, he had about 2 more hours until he had to wake up for his shift at the parlor. Steve rinsed Tony’s cum from his body and removed the sheets, then fall backward, closing his eyes into -hopefully- uninterrupted sleep.
“Yeah hey, it’s me. Steve,” he added after it was silence on Tony’s side.
Enjoy!
Tony put a hand to Steve's lips, and rested his forehead against his lovers',
"What are you all doing here?" Tony said, smiling softly at his team's kindness.
Steve and Tony looked at each other, knowing that this would be it.
ALSOOOOO!!!
He didn't expect the change to be immediate, but he was disappointed when after a while the change still didn't happen. Suddenly, his legs tail was split into two, yet, he didn't feel anything. He laid on the beach wiggling his
In truth, Steve just liked the peace that came with silence, he could hear himself think. It wasn't like he hated noise, he liked being around people, but the loud things, concerts, music. God the damn music. That's what bothered him the most. How people can just ruin their eardrums and listen to loud, obnoxious music for hours. He sometimes hung out in Tony's lab, only when he stopped playing that loud music that made Steve have flashbacks to those times. The war times.
ps: this is where the title comes from!!!
"Thank you, Dr. Cho," Tony said as he wiped his tears off with the sleeve of his jacket; while grabbing Steve's hand and giving it a tight squeeze before heading into the SHIELD care facility.
Tony burst out laughing at Steve's comment while patting Steve on the back motioning him to exit the office.
"Tony no"
Natasha smirked, "Alright boys what's the date?" Everyone groaned.
Tony hated silence, it made his skin crawl and caused the already loud thoughts in his head get excruciatingly louder, buzzing and thumping against his skull. He just chalked it up to being used to the noise. The constant parties and social vendettas he would be forced to go to as a kid. The talking and shaking hands, he was never surrounded by quiet that now he couldn't bear it. Even locked up in his lab he had the constant whirl of devices, sometimes even loud rock and roll thumping against the speakers in his lab.
Tony turned his head abruptly at the door when he heard a knock at his glass lab door. He saw Steve, hair all disheveled and eyes sleepy.
"Shit" Peter whispered falling from the ceiling.
"Tony you cannot date a national icon" Pepper responded. "And how do you even know if he's gay, bi, pan, whatever?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, two bad faggot" Flash said making Peter even madder.
Tony had an hour left, he spent it cuddling with Steve and repeating the phrase 'I love you' over and over again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Fuck him and his- his- morals."
Thanks for reading
Peter focused, he thought of when his Pops and Dad brought him home, he thought of movie nights, truth or dare, first parent-teacher conferences; he needed to be strong, he couldn't give up.
"So Peter any questions?" Tony said as he started to make a cup of coffee.
The talk show host was speechless then assumed that Tony and Natasha were involved in a relationship. "May I just say that you and Ms. Romanaff make a great coup-".
"I do hope your attitude doesn't have anything to do with that man you met on Saturday, Captian." Fury said turning towards Steve with a smirk.
Peter's face grew red.
The human sighed, but reached down and touched his tail. The man was in awe, the merman's tail was golden and red. The iridescent scales leading to a feather-like elegant fin which felt smooth and soft when the man touched it.
"Hey Dad, hey Pops," Peter said.
Steve stopped, "you guys already knew?!"
"I think it's time to come out"
"Why would I want the suit rainbow," Peter said chuckling.
Everyone froze, no one knew how Steve would react to 21st-century morals and homosexual behavior.
Peter sighed unfolding under his pops' stern glair.
After what seemed like five hours later the Stark-Rogers name was called.
Tony smiled and kissed Steve one more time.
Peter gasped, all he saw was a robotic face glitching with cold lifeless eyes, then darkness and this cold feeling that engulfed him in a bottomless pit of nothingness.
Even if my father beat her, or the money was so tight she had to work three jobs. She would always hold me in her arms, tell me to be strong. I like to think that she's always with me. Making me strong." Steve looked into Tony's chocolate eyes.
Tony picked it up reluctantly, "Hello?"
They were safe.
Steve shot a glare at him. "I came here to discuss the matter of Mr. Stark and I being in a committed relationship." Steve sucked in a breath.
"Hey, Pete," Steve said looking at his son.
"Steve! Steve no wait!" Tony pleaded, but Steve was gone.
"I'm not really sure, Mr... Barton? I think his name was, already gave me a run down"
That I'll die livin' just as free as my hair
Steve blushed.
Pepper smacked him with a pillow which just preceded to get a groan from Tony.
Tony nodded solemnly, “Similar to you my dad was pretty shitty, abusive and all that jazz. He and my mom died in a car crash a few years ago. I started drinking at a really young age, I had severe depression. These tally marks represent how many months I’ve stayed sober,” Tony said, looking Steve in the eyes.
After all of the Avenger's and Peter's friends visited Peter, they checked him out of the hospital and brought him home. They were all together again, they were finally a family again.
"Huh?" Steve asked, trying to play dumb. Not only would the team shun him for liking men, but he was the captain and he couldn't get with a member of the team. Could he? No, he wasn't even going to go there, like Tony would feel the same way.
"You're joking man!" Ned whispered making sure their teacher didn't hear them.
Come on Peter just open your fucking eyes! Come on! You wanna be like your parents, you wanna save the world, open your eyes!
"Everyone always thinks I'm so innocent," Steve said holding both of Tony's hands. "But you never participated in the jokes and mockery. Why?" Steve asked.
"Of course! Come on let's go!" Steve motioned to the elevator while smiling at Tony thinking about how lucky they were to have Peter.
"I-umm- like physics? And technology." Peter said then smiled. "I also love science, it's really my passion."
“Clint, I told you-” Steve started.
Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes...
"How about I make it up to you. Let me buy you a coffee?" Tony offered, presuming that this man wasn't the 'let's fuck' type.
Steve was trying to control his laughter.
"You too Mr. Stark." Steve said as he blushed as he thought about being referred to as a 'Capsicle'.
"I agree," Tony said looking at his boyfriend.
They stayed like this for a while, they had been dancing about each other for months. Neither of them made a move. Too frightened of being rejected and broken again, they both tried to push their feelings away.
"Thank you, sir, but I'm sure Mr. Stark will fulfill every need I have," Steve said smirking.
The doctor nodded and exited the room.
The Avengers were still processing what their teammate just said. Yeah, they knew about Tony being gay (it was pretty obvious), but Steve that was just unexpected.
"I'm trying to find the person I love. Brooklyn, 569 Leaman Place." Tony stated, remembering that was where Steve said he lived.
Stay special, Stay you no matter what anyone else says. xoxoxo ❤️
The last of the Avengers was... well Cap. He had golden-sand colored hair that Tony thought was gorgeous. They all made jokes about him, all loving, but kept saying that he was America's Boyscout. Tony, however never participated in the jokes. He saw the way that Steve's eyes went dark when they talked about his past. Tony knew Steve had secrets, they all did. Tony was just so, so unbelievably in love with the man.
,” Tony questioned.
Steve was there again, gunshots, smoke yelling, he couldn't- Tony? Where was Tony? He looked towards Bucky, "Cap? You ok Cap?"
At this, Steve went tense. "I believe that no matter a persons gender (or lack thereof), race, and/or sexuality they should be treated with respect and equality that everyone else has," Steve exclaimed then grabbed Tony's face to kiss him, then grabbed his husband and son's hand to export them out of the street and into the car.
https://youtu.be/0bP4ASO8IM8
Steve and Tony made it to the hospital as soon as they could with the rest of the Avengers.
Mr. Johnsons' mouth was open in a shocked expression. "Are you coming out Mr. Stark?"
"Young Peter is a mighty lad, I can guarantee that he shall fight his way to this world," Thor said raising his hammer, making the Avengers chuckle in dry humor.

I'm a free as my hair
"That's great friend, Steven, for I am glad yo-" Thor started then was interrupted by Steve.
“Hey! Watch where you're going!" Tony said, still looking at his phone
There was one scar, crossing all the way from Steve's shoulder, to his hip. Steve closed his eyes in shame.
"She was, she reminded me a lot of you actually."
"Wow." The man said simply.
Tony smiled. "Please, Steve. Let me in. Let me explain everything."
"Tony no"
"Seems great Mr. Stark".
One night, Tony was sitting on the couch with a bottle of vodka, lucky not quite drunk, yet. When Steve went into the kitchen for a midnight snack.
Enjoy!
"You- it is? Ok, that is?" Steve said his head hanging low. "I think I- I mean- I like men. I mean, but Peggy-"
Peter groaned he knew that to most people living with the Avengers would think that it's fun and adventurous, but the only adventurous thing that happened lately was Thor putting his hammer on the toilet so Clint couldn't use it. That lead to Clint having to use the bathroom across the street at the Taco Palace resulting to him being chased by fangirls all the way back to the tower. Regardless, Peter knew that his Aunt, Uncle's, and Father's would try and make up some elaborate scheme to impress his class.
Peter shyly started to walk out on stage waving, then had a seat between his fathers'.
Steve scoffed, "Who cares about your hair or innocence, honestly. I love you for who you are. No exceptions."

Tony looked at Steve and they instantly knew that Peter was the one.
"Tony this isn't supreme court." Natasha chimed in.
"Go ahead in, I'm sure that young Peter would like to see you go first, we shall all wait in the lobby," Thor stated to Steve and Tony. The two men nodded and headed to Peter's room.
"Is this about the man I saw you with at Starbucks?"
"Hey babe what is it? Is everything ok?" Steve said.
Tony smiled, “Well you know that gigantic building, on the corner of Park Avenue?” Steve nodded. “I’m
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't deserve you, I never have," Tony said as he started walking away. Everyone he ever loved he pushed away, he couldn't do that to Steve; he loved him too much.
They talked a little bit longer when Steve got a call, he didn't answer and just continued talking with Tony. This happened a few more times within the last 10 minutes and Tony suggested that he should probably just answer it. Steve did, and then told Tony he had to go but wanted his number so they could meet up again sometime again. They exchanged numbers and said their goodbyes.
"I told myself that-"
No scars show up on Tony's body when he says this.
"Of course it is, not many people are as lucky to be in my presence" Tony quirked with his world famous smirk, as Steve rolled his eyes.
"Steve..." Natasha started, hopping off of the counter taking a step closer to Steve. "You do know it's ok now right? Being gay. Hell, Steve, even I've been with a few women." Natasha put a hand on Steve's shoulder.
"Oh, umm. No, sure, it's fine." Tony stammered. His eyes wondering around the man's fit form through the tight shirt.
"Oh no I didn't mean to inflate your ego! I take it back!" Steve said laughing along with Tony and Peter.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So... welcome to the Avengers lounge floor," Tony said exasperatedly.
When Steve returned back to the tower he was greeted with Tony running into his arms.
"Tony"
"I'm Steve and this is my partner Tony," Steve said as he held out his hand for the boy to shake.
After putting the finishing touches on the suit, Peter showed it to his pops.
When JARVIS did as Steve asked, Steve walked in towards Tony was, when his music erupted in background noise resembling gunshots. Steve imminently started shaking and dropped the plate. The loud crash making Tony turn around at him. Steve dropped to the floor, head in his knees, breathing off and fast. Tony sped towards him, kneeling in front of the man. Steve thought he heard Tony say, "JARVIS off," before Steve was wrapped in a hug with words of "Shhh," and "It's ok," in his ear.
"Please just do anything in your power to help our son," Steve said to the doctor.
"Aliens?"
"I was drunk... and there was shawarma," Tony said quickly. "Well anyway guess who's having fondue tonight?" Tony said before Steve could chastise him.
"Iron Man 4'oclock!" Steve shouted to his husband, who was currently fighting a glitching robot.
“I would love too. Want me to pick you up?” Tony asked Steve. Steve agreed, and they had a date set up for later in the day. Steve had a big old smile on his face when he entered back into the shop, “Fuck, yes man!” Clint cheered high-fiving him, earning a strange look from some customers. Steve shrugged as he settled back into his station and began reviewing his schedule once again.
Steve grinned as he kissed Tony "I think that's an amazing idea"
After they ate, Tony insisted they headed back to his penthouse. Tony waved at the security guard, as they entered the elevator. “What floor, Master Stark?” A voice sounded, making Steve jump. Steve looked around hesitantly, as Tony started laughing. “Penthouse Jar, and don’t worry, it’s just JARVIS, he’s kind of like a butler without a body,”
Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes...
"Alright, parents welcome to parent night! Remember we will call your last name by alphabetic order Starting with...Alberts!"
Everyone lied, Tony, lied about his innocence. Natasha lied about her past. Clint lied about his parents. Bruce lied about accepting himself. They would go into the showers after battles and see each other's scars, they weren't ashamed. Their scars would litter their bodies, during movie nights Natasha's scar on her thigh would show when she wore shorts. While eating dinner, Tony's scar that ran down his forearm would show.
Steve was in a meeting with Fury when he received a message from Tony.
"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, I'm sure my son would love to let some of his classmates meet Earth's Mightiest Heroes!" A voice announced from the now open doors of the elevator.
Steve kissed Tony’s forehead, “I guess we’re both a little broken, but two broken hearts make a full one,” Tony sadly looked into Steve’s eyes and they both kissed, not fast or dirty, but light and loving. A promise.
"Captian America, all American boy scout. Pure as a flower, of course, you don't have any scars"
Steve got a text during the conversation while Coulson was talking more about the Initiative. He looked down to his phone hidden under the table and saw three words.
Pepper entered Starbucks late to their meeting but saw Tony really enjoying himself with this man. She smiled and walked out of the coffee shop, they could work on business later.
They sat on the couch. Tony explained the coming of age process to Steve in more depth. He apologized profusely. Steve asked about the legs, Tony told him the rumors, how he had now 10 hours. They sat in silence once everything was said. Steve leaned over to stroke the sides of Tony's face, Tony leaned into his touch. Steve placed a kiss to his lips and Tony felt a shiver of warmth erupt inside his body.
"This is Katy Wetherbee giving you an inside scoop on the newly announced act that allows homosexual marriage to be now official in all 50 states...."
Tony sucked in a breath as he looked at Steve, who returned the look with a sad smile. Steve pulled up two chairs for them, and they both sat down, Tony stroking Peter's hair and Steve grabbing his hand.
P.S: Thanks to everyone for supporting me... life is hard, to say the least, and writing this story allows me to escape just for little.
"I am not a-" Tony started.
Tony and Steve rushed to his side while the rest of the Avengers were fighting the robots and covering for them.
When Natasha started hitting Clint in the back of the head repeatedly, they (luckily for Peter's sake) settled down and started playing a game of Mario Cart.
They spend 11 hours, laughing, kissing, playing video games, eating human food, and 'fonduing' as Tony learned about that joke.
"I don't wanna talk Flash," Peter said annoyed.
(See the end of the chapter for
Authors note:
"What do you mean by 'next step'?" Steve questioned.
Sorry in advance for any spelling mistakes... I'm still in school and this story is not overviewed or edited by someone... i am forever alone... anyway enjoy...?
Authors Note:
Steve looked deeply into Tony's brown eyes. Tony looked hurt, broken.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Steve asked, putting the completed sandwich on a plate.
"Hey, I don't know, showing support for your gay dads? or maybe you have discovered to join the cult of gay." Tony said full out grinning.
“There’s not much to tell, I work at SHIELD and have a drawing hobby,” Steve shrugged.
At this, the human halted gathering his things and turned towards Tony.
They all were at least a little broken because that's the thing with heroes, they have baggage just like the rest of us. Each of them felt lost at some point, each of them had a bully telling them that they 'couldn't do it', 'you're a sinner' or 'you aren't strong enough', but they got through it. They focused on what mattered, Steve found Tony and they found Peter. Many of them didn't have a family, but they each created their own type of family. The Avengers had a bond that couldn't be broken, even through death or war. That what family is, people who would stick with you no matter what, people who would care and respect you even through your darkest moments.
Tony looked at him confused, "What, what is it?"
"I love you too"
“That’s definingly him then,” She asserted.
"No, I don't- I'm not a homosexual or anything," Steve gulped, a slight pink tint growing on his cheeks.
"I think I might be that," Steve said smiling a little at Nat. "Is Tony-?"
Steve hated loud sounds, it made him remember the sounds of the war, the bombs, the screaming. It made him want to curl into a ball and just disappear. He talked to Sam about it, who responded that it was most likely the PTSD. Those loud sounds brought him right back to when he was covered in his fellow soldier's blood, and the warm feeling of his own blood dripping down his chest from the bullet holes that came from enemy guns.
"Mr. Stark, Captian, your son has endured three cracked ribs, a traumatic brain injury, and a broken arm, along with many chest and torso abrasions" The doctor explained, "although this situation is serious, our new technology will be able to fix your son's physical trauma in less than 24 hours. Unfortunately, your son is currently in a coma and we are trying every-"
Steve had just finished taking a shower, shortly following his workout for the day, (in all he destroyed several sand filled punching bags, over a span of a few minutes, but no one really needed to know that.)
"Tony?" Steve chocked out.
The Avengers were silent processing the news until Thor spoke up,
-------------
“I'm sleeping, isn't that good enough?"
"We have disclosed that we shall never speak of that time again," Clint said harshly remembering the look of pure terror that was in Fury's face.
“’ello?” Steve heard Tony’s voice over the phone.
Peter was laying on a hospital bed, with numerous tubes sticking out of his mouth along with an IV that was attached to a fluid bag.
Peter smiled, it felt like the first time in several years that he felt like he had a home or a family. A family.
Steve thought. "You're pretty amazing." Steve spat out, "You are handsome, brave, passionate, brilliant, and I love you Anthony Stark."
Bisexual. Tony. Tony was into men. Steve almost cried. Sure, they had been out for coffee, but the thing was Steve actually didn’t know Tony was bisexual. When he first set eyes Tony he fell hopelessly in love, now he's hearing that the man he loves... could possibly love him too.
Steve turned with his back towards Tony and took his shirt off.
Peter grimaced. "Ok... but you can't talk about fondue and I'm not letting you embarrass me!"
"Sure, you can tell me anything." The way Steve said this made Tony's heart race.
Steve looked at Tony with his adorable smile.
And so, two broken hearts, wrapped in each other’s arms, became full.
? He thought they were called. Tony tried to move into a crouching position. He steadied his balance then stood up. Legs shaking, he took a step. The night sky lit up with stars as he steadied his walk. He walked into the city, bright lights everywhere. There were big moving objects in the 'street', cars he presumed. Walking into the street he almost got run over by a yellow checkered car, until the car stopped in front of him.
"You knew he could do it! You helped him train- an-and that's hardly fair, you-you-th-th-he-he-was-was-" Tony started to cry.
“Tell me about yours,” Steve said, running a thumb over the nine tallies.
"Ms. and Mr. Parker please take your seat, I have a few things to discuss about Peter." His advisor said without looking up.
"Great," Tony smirked, then got them a table outside. He waited in line for what seemed like forever. He was about to pay the people to let him get in front of them until someone was standing at an open register calling for the next order.
"Hey Parker, I was talking to you"
Steve wrapped his arm around his husband pulling him close once again.
Tony looked back at the driver with a questioned look on his face
"Somehow I doubt that. My hair turned brown when I was 13 and I tasted the sweet bitter taste of bourbon."
They got wrapped up in conversation, Steve asking about Tony's world and Tony asking about land above the ocean. Tony completely forgot about his main focus. They talked about Steve's family, his work as an artist. After they had been talking for hours, Steve asked about sexual identities and gender under the sea. Tony said that gender was a very fluid concept, and sexual identity no-one thought twice about labels. Steve told Tony about the pride parades and conflict with being part of the LGBTQIAAPP+ community. Tony discovered that Steve was just like him when it came to sexuality, 'bisexual' he had called it. Tony thought that labels were unnecessary and there should be no labels on love.
“So, tell me about yourself, Mr.
The Avengers were family, and no matter what, it would stay that way because through blood, sweat, and tears,
And this is my prayer, I swear
"We thought we should see how Peter-and you guys are doing." Pepper said kindly.
"I love you too."

Clint, Thor, and Wanda each handed her $5.
He looked up and saw Tony smile at him.
Peter was about to hit him when Mr. Robenson intervened.
“Nothing, just this guy who comes in once and a while constantly and asks for a tally mark,” Steve frowned at this, “He had nine, on his chest,” Nat nodded,
————————-
that's just how a superhero learns to fly.
At this point, Tony started to space out all he could think about was how crystal blue this mans eyes were, or how broad his shoulders were, or how he would love to run his fingers up his-

The driver nodded. A few minutes later they arrived. "No charge. Just go find him."
Hey, guys so I have no life- like whatsoever so I wrote you another chapter. This one's short, but it's very important and like stuff. So without further to do je presente le prochain chapitre.
Once they had reached Peters advisors office. They were created with a skinny blond. (Who Tony would've totally hit if he wasn't with his dear old Capsicle).
"That's right" Tony pointed to himself. "This guy!" He smirked as he grabbed Steve's hand and dragged him towards their room.
"We're here to see Peter Stark-Rogers?" Natasha said to the lady at the front desk.
Steve took a quick shower then got changed into a nice leather jacket and black skinny jeans. He slipped his phone into his back pocket and left his apartment without a second thought.
"Nope. Nada. Zip. Zero" Tony quipped. "As of 6 months ago you are officially my son, and as a responsible, mature adult-(Peter rolled his eyes)- it is my duty to attend your parent-teacher conference."
"I think that would be great," Tony said.
"Your dad has a point son," Steve said putting on his Captain America persona.

"57 guest badges for the Midtown High tour?" The check-in lady said frantically, while her partner was counting the kids.
"That's right pay up its May I win." Natasha said.
“Are you asking me on a date?” Tony said.
Tony was cut off by a kiss.
"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!" Tony said jumping up and down.
"St-Steve?" Tony asked.
“You know I don’t have time for relationships, Buck,” Steve commented, putting down the needle to admire his work. “They’re a waste of time, and plus I’m fine staying single.” His friend scoffed, pulling his sleeve down the new red star on his shoulder. “If you call having one night stands every night ‘being single’ fine. But don’t come running to me when you’re tired of fucking complete strangers every night.” Steve rolled his eyes, it wasn’t as if he was fine with not having someone to go home to, it was more he couldn’t find someone. “Alright Buck, I’ll see you tomorrow,” Steve said waving his friend a goodbye as the younger man left the shop. Steve went to the bathroom and grabbed the edges of the sink looking at himself in the mirror. His eyes looked bloodshot, his blonde hair sticking up in several directions. He sighed, how did he end up like this? Single. Working in a tattoo show for minimum wage. Sleeping with complete strangers he takes home every night. Living in an old crusty single apartment. He had a good life in college, friends, a nice girlfriend, good grades, a steady art internship. Until his mom died and his one source of happiness disappeared. He got into alcohol, got kicked out of school. He was lucky enough that his friend Natasha let him work at the tattoo shop.
Steve sighed, "I believe that no matter that no matter what gender, race, or ethnicity someone is, they should be able to marry whoever they want and be happy."
"Yes I am, and my beautiful husband here" Tony nodded at Steve. "Have recently adopted a child."
"Tony has a point, I don't think I would be able to handle two of him," Steve said playfully.
"As you know Tony and I haven't exactly- come out yet to the public. And if you would like... Tony and I are going to hold a press conference to announce our marriage and having you as our new son." Steve said nodding at Tony.
Steve woke up gasping, hair sticking to his forehead with sweat. He looked around in the darkness, eyes adjusting. He checked the time on his phone, 2:24. He went to the bathroom and fell to the floor as soon as he closed the door. Shaking back and forth clutching his tattoo he shut his eyes and let the pain wash over him. Moments later, he let out a shaky breath and got up.
But fear not! For those who voted for something else, it's not gonna be a huge part of the storyline, I'm focusing on more Stony and just Superfamily without Deadpool and other relationships.
"No guys I'm serious!" Peter defended himself.
All eyes were on Steve.
They talked for at least two hours, Tony refilled his coffee five times and Steve was in awe about how much coffee this man could drink. Tony told Steve about his business, Steve told Tony about his work as an artist. They hit it off really well, Tony really liked Steve, like genuinely liked him.
"Is this a problem?" Clint said and gestured to the tv.
By this point, it was dark and they were only being lit by the moons shine reflecting on the water and lights from the city. Tony couldn't do it, Steve was amazing, they had been talking for at least 4 hours now. He didn't deserve to die. He just couldn't. He hated to admit it, but he felt a connection with Steve they had so much in common. Tony knew there would be consequences, he would be reprimanded, a disgrace to his pod.
The Avengers were fighting an army of robots who came out of what seemed to be nowhere, Tony thought that this would be a good warm-up for Peter. Tony already had Peter trained in various training programs, even Natasha trained him in hand-to-hand combat. Needless to say, he was pretty prepared, but no one saw what would happen next.
Pepper nodded. "You really liked him didn't you?"
"Trust me, he has no problem with this. He knows I’m bi. " Tony said hrugging.
Clint and Thor each had dirty blonde hair, close to blonde. Similar to Tony, they each had moments of recklessness. Thor had his moments, the pain Loki had caused. Clint had his hardships as a child, but he remembered his brother Barney and all of the bad memories seemed to fade away.
"So Mr. Stark, Captian Rogers, it is such an honor to have you on our show today" The announced to the two Avengers sitting on the large couch.

Ps: Watch this video :)
The man nodded his head squatting to come closer to Tony's face.
Natasha nodded, "Yeah, it's called bisexual if you like girl and boys,"
"What about that one?" Tony said as he pointed to a corner where a teenage boy was reading what looked to be a physics book.
Tony looked at Steve through his dark eyelashes, Steve was looking at his shoes, halfway out the door like he was ready to bolt any second. Tony smiled and ran into Steve's muscular arms kissing him.
Sorry for grammar mistakes I don't do grammar or spelling or math.. or history..or dance..or... you know what never mind
Ps: Watch this video for lgbtquaap+ pride
Tony swam up to the side of the pier, he figured that this man could be a suitable specimen for him to sacrifice.
Authors Note:
Tony was riding a current following his father's commands to find a human. Today was his birthday and he was ready. He breached the water swimming about a mile from the shores of Long Island Beach. He had seen many sights and been all around the world, but this seemed to be the most awe-striking sight he had ever seen. The sky was a peach orange color, with hints of red and gold. The sun was setting behind tall buildings, creating a silhouette of the humans' wonderful and brilliant creations. He swam closer to the beach, there was a boardwalk along the coast and a small pier sticking out about 3 yards. He saw a chair, with a human? Tony swam closer out of the human's view. He noticed that the human was painting a beautiful representation of the sea and sunset. Tony was in awe. The human, man Tony presumed, was physically strong with crystal blue eyes and golden hair, similar to the golden features of his city down in the ocean.
Yes, Tony Stark is very horny.
Steve stepped back, out of Tony's grasp. He looked down, wiping his tears.
"You should've come to us, you could've gotten seriously hurt, even killed," Steve said looking at his son.
Both Steve and Tony saw it, their son's eyes were now bright and he was smiling, they didn't know if they would ever see that again.
When Peter and his peers guided by his father, arrived at the Avenger's lounge level they were greeted with screams of what looked like Hawkeye covered in toilet paper, being chased by a Black Widow wearing slippers, a facemask, and a robe somehow looking still attractive.
The audience was silent for a heartbeat, then erupted in cheers for the new avenger. Steve and Tony looked at each other realizing that their son was even more amazing that they could've imagined, and they walked over to do a group hug with all of the Avengers.
Their teacher glared at them and Peter winced. He may be the son of Tony Stark, but he still had a reputation to uphold.
Steve smiled was Tony suggested what he think he was?
"I have called this family meeting beca-"
It had been around 3 hours since he had wished goodnight to Steve. He had fixed and upgraded some of his armor and replaced the engine in his Bugatti Chiron and gold Pagani Huayra BC.
Please feel free to comment!
The Avengers shared a number of looks, understanding where Peter was coming from. He was the only one that didn't have powers.
SO please read the title.... trigger warnings... I'm sorry...next chapter more angst than fluff I promise!!!
"Now, now, now Mr. Johnson who said that I was in a relationship with Ms. Romanaff."
"Oh, because I- can you be both?"
Several months later:
"Hey" Steve greeted once Tony motioned for him to come into his lab.
Tony looked away, "We've been married for three years now and together for five, and I think it's maybe time for the next step."
Ignoring him, Fury proceeded, "Rogers if you have any questions you know where my office is."
"Tell us a bit about yourself, Peter," Tony said urging for the boy to start a conversation.
“Oh! I love SHIELD, the owner, Natasha? I think her name is my frequent artist,” Tony commented. “As for art, that’s pretty cool. The only thing I’m able to draw is engineering specs. Do you have any pieces you can show me?”
Tony smirked thinking about being able to spend the entire day with Captian Hottie. "Of course I would be willing to spend the day with the good ol' captain here," Tony said.
Pepper hugged him and kissed him on the cheek.
Tony and Steve walked up to their son, hugged him and looked out into the crowd of press smiled in pride as Peter gave his speech.
I've had enough, enough, enough
“Do you know what they mean?” Steve asked, now curious. Nat shook her head,
Steve stood up abruptly, "You wanted to drown me? Kill me?" He scoffed, "Wow." He packed up his stuff quickly and started walking back.
“No, it’s ok.” Steve said, “My father was abusive, and he gave me a lot of shit throughout my life. He ended up overdosing a few years ago. Overall my mom and I were happy, he left scars on both of our body’s and we were finally just- free. About a year ago my mom died. I started hanging out with some bad people, with help of my good friends I got my life back on track, but this tattoo helps me remember to stay sane,” Steve finished shakily. Tony planted a small kiss on his lips. “That’s beautiful Steve,”
“My name is Steve." The man- Steve said, smiling an adorable smile that made Tony smile also.
"I'm not done... When I was little being homosexual was a curse, a problem that needed to be fixed. So when I started dating Peggy Carter I didn't feel like she was right for me." Steve smiled shyly. "I did some... research, and I discovered that I'm... well..." deep breath. "Homosexual," Steve said fast as he started to walk swiftly out of the door.
"I'm so proud of you Pete!" Tony exclaimed rubbing Peters' hair.
Steve and Tony were waiting in the lobby of the SHIELD headquarters, waiting for the doctors to tell them when they could see Peter, when they both cracked under the silence of the abandoned lobby.
"Do you have any scars?"
"Yeah right Parker" MJ rolled her eyes.
"Although you programmed me to be for your best interest I have to agree with Mr. Barton."
Tony wondered through the halls trying to find Steve's room. After a few minutes, Tony found his room. He knocked on the door hesitantly. A familiar face opened the door. "Tony? Wha-How?" Steve looked at Tony's legs.
Steve blushed and turned around to grab the plate for Tony that he seemed to forget about, but when he turned back to her she was gone. Figures Steve sighed and shook his head, and wondered to the lab.
---------------------
Steve looked at Tony and felt a tear roll down his cheek. Tony stood up and started smoothing Steve's hair down, calming him. "Shh, baby it's ok. What is it?"
After approximately ten minutes, the doctor returned with a clipboard.
Tony observed the beach, making sure no one was there. He swam up the shallows, soon he was able to push himself up. His arms were sore, he had to haul all of his body weight onto the beach.
“Sure,” Tony answered. “I love me a bit of some meat,” He said wiggling his eyebrows.
Anyways thanks to everyone for reading
"Yes, yes I do," Steve said as he kissed Tony.
"Well then what are we doing here? Let's go get our son" Steve said grabbing his husband's hand.
"No," Steve said. "I do know. It's you, Tony. It's always been you. I love you, I-, you're the first thing I can think about in the morning and the last thing I can think about before I go to sleep. I spent so long thinking who I was was wrong, but fuck it. The world may disapprove, but you know what Tony. You're my world, my world is only you."
After school, he walked his usual block away from school, where he found his dad in his Porsche parked.
“Oh, hey handsome. What are you calling little old me for?” Steve chuckled.
"Can I ask you something though?"

I am my hair
"What brought this on?" Steve said softly, sitting on the couch next to Tony.
Hey everyone! This is the last chapter!!! BUT if anyone has an idea of what I should write next.. either a one-shot or whatever PLEASE feel free to message me. I have nothing else to do in my life. Anyway!! As you guys know this was my first fanfic, so thanks for sticking with me! Without further to do, here is the last chapter of How A Superhero Learns To Fly.
Steve cringed. What did he do? Tony and he were coming up on their three year anniversary did Tony get tired of him? Steve processed this all the way through the meeting, so much so that he didn't hear anything that Fury was saying.
"OOOOOO he," Tony said smirking, he loved embarrassing his son.
"I'm sorry" Peter gasped out than closed his eyes hearing his parents' voices frown out
"Hey Pete," Steve said greeting his son with a head rub, causing Peter's face to go red. "Hey, beloved." Steve greeted his husband with a kiss making the girls in Peter's class squeal whispering 'stony' under their breath.

Thanks for reading please comment! Stay special❤️
"Tony?" Steve said shocked as he saw his crush walk inside his room.
Tony had chocolate brown hair to symbolize the loss of innocence, recklessness. The press supposed that all the years of partying, drinking, and sleeping around finally caught up to him. However, Tony wasn't ashamed of his past, he had been through a lot. Abuse and hardship made him stronger. He didn't lose his blonde hair because he was too much of a playboy. He lost it because the first time his father hit him, he knew that the world was a dark place and he should try and make it right.
"Stark- Rogers?" The teacher said confused.
"I really liked him Pep." Tony sighed, sitting up in bed.
Peter cringed hoping that since his dads came out, he wouldn't be as tortured by flash today. Peter started walking in the other direction until flash grabbed him by his shirt.
"Hey Captain," She said nodding her head in his direction. Steve smiled at her in response. "Whatcha doing?" She asked, hopping up onto the counter across where Steve was working on the sandwich.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You shouldn't drink it out of the bottle," Steve said signaling towards the almost empty bottle.
Steve thought that this would be a good time to chip in, "Yes we are... is this a problem?"
Authors Note:
Steve sputtered the avengers groaned. Clint's yelled "TMI!" and Thor yelled "Congratulations shield and iron brother!"
Steve shrugged, “I don’t watch a lot of TV,” Tony smiled at Steve as a waiter came to take their order.
Sure honey, be home soon.
Authors note:
Tony groaned, "Jarvis? I got it thanks, shut up now." He fell asleep for five more minutes until Pepper came in and hit him with a pillow.
"BECAUSE YOU HAVE SCHOOL! NOW EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOU ARE STILL ON THE CEILING- YOU KNOW WHAT FAMILY MEETING, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY"
Tony.” It took a while for Steve to get it but then his eyes got wide.
Sometimes there are just no words.
Steve followed Tony into his room, "Tony I'm not ready to-"
While exiting this thought, Steve looked around and all the Avengers were nodding.
To the Avengers, Captian America didn't have any scars. His arms and legs were clean, it seemed that he never lied. They envied him.
Tony abruptly coughed trying to clear the thoughts going through his head before he got a boner.
Stay special xoxo please feel free to comment!
"No, no Cap. I know. Sometime, but not now. Let's just rest ok? Lord knows we both need it." Tony let out a quick chuckle.
————————————
"Dad's right Pops" Peter assured his worried father.
Once they broke apart Tony looked into Steve's crystal eyes, "Just to clarify, this means that we are together right? Because I have loved you for-like- years since I was 12, and I-" Steve interrupted him with a deep kiss answering Tony's question.
“I don’t know why it takes people so long to realize that,”
"Come in Pep!! Pleaseee?"
"Mr. Stark and Mr. Rogers, or are it Mr. Roger's in plural," Cristine said. "Aren't you worried that this will have a negative effect on the future population in terms of your sinful homosexuality?"
Peter could hear them, they were so close, he just needed to reach out.
It was around 1 maybe 2, they had just returned from a mission, Steve and Tony were sitting on the couch. Steve had his feet up on the ottoman, Tony had his Steve's lap. They were watching Harry Potter, Steve claimed he had never seen it before. Tony looked at Steve, the sun was shining on his face, golden locks wet and sticking to his forehead from the shower he had recently taken. Tony smiled, Steve looked so at peace. Stark has had his fair share of people pretending around him, he could tell Steve was always putting up a false facade. Tony wanted to know the Cap underneath. Captian America may have been his childhood crush, but he truly loved Steve Rogers. Tony lifted his feet off of Steve's lap, careful not to wake him. He traveled around the couch to Steve. Tony brushed a strand of hair from his forehead and whispered "Goodnight, Captian." Before heading down to his lab to do some work.
Peters teacher announced to the parents.
Peter smiled. "I think that that's a good idea."
"I know and I'm sor-" Peter started.
"Shenanigans? Me? Whatever are you talking about." Tony quirked.
Steve looked up again from his sketch.
Steve looked up from his drawing to take in the news.
Anyway enjoy!
"Hey guys," Natasha said in a calming motherly voice. "Hello, my little паук" Natasha whispered to Peter, brushing the hair away from his closed eyes.
Tony leaned into Steve's touch and then stood up abruptly.
Peter nodded still dumbfounded by the fact that he was living with the fucking Avengers. A week ago, he was sharing a room with his friend Wade and being bosses around my a caretaker who didn't give a shit about him. Now he's sharing a tower with earth mightiest heroes, has an AI butler named Jarvis, and now actually has parents.
Tony chuckled, "I actually did. It seemed like he didn't like me for my money or a good fuck."
"If..how is your hair golden still?" Tony asked, wanting to run his fingers through the man's hair.
"I'm Peter," Peter said hesitantly.
"Here look.." Peter pulled out his phone secretly and showed them a picture of all the Avengers and Peter sitting on the couch.
I'm going home, why am I even talking to you?"
I've had enough, this is my prayer
“I would love to,” Steve laughed, as he took off his jacket too.
Tony breathed out a quick 'ok thank you' before the phone hit the ground. He turned to his husband and the rest of the Avengers while smiling uncontrollably.
"This is Cristine Everheart, reporting the supposed 'press conference' of the century. Pepper Pots, co-founder of Stark Industries has told us to 'be on alert with our cameras ready', so folks what could the famous Avengers possibly be willing to share with us? We'll find out in only 5 minutes, stay tuned to WWRB Channel 14."
A few minutes later, a familiar man with a nice suit on came into the main deck of the Helicarrier, strutting in style. Steve froze. He stood up and ran over the man.
"I just wanted to be like you, I ran a series of tests and the spider bite wasn't harmful, it just gave me powers. I wanted to help people, I wanted to be like you." Peter repeated looking down ashamed.
Tony walked towards Steve and traced his scar with his index finger. Steve shuddered at Tony's delicate touch.
"Tell me a bit about yourself, Steve."
"Now... Ms. Potts announced that you have something big to announce...." The talk show host said.
Tony, Peter, and Steve stood up and started heading near the exit of the theater ignoring the prying eyes of other parents.
Steve sat on the couch, Tony under his arm as he flipped through stations. “We should watch
He let the cold air wipe the remaining of tears off his face as he entered the crowded bar and sat down. The pounding music made his ears thump. The blue-eyed man ordered a scotch and soon was drinking his problems away.
“That's none of your business," Steve said giving Nick a glair and strolled out of the gym. Fury had no business talking about his personal life.
"I don't care about your scars. All that matters is that I will love you forever."
"So Peetsy Pie" His dad mocked. "I received an email from your advisor saying that parent-teacher conference is next week." While saying this Tony snickered.
Nick Fury entered the room, Steve was rewrapping his hands from destroying various punching bags.
Thanks for reading! Feel free to comment!
"Throughout these many years, I have seen my son grow and flourish. He has been strong in even times where I wasn't, and whenever he got knocked down he always got back up. He chooses to become SpiderMan because he wanted the world to be a better place, and it is, because of him. He has fought Ultron, Loki, Doombots, A.I.M, Hydra, Electro, and many other villains that could have destroyed the world, but thanks to our son they didn't even get a chance to. That's why my husband, and I are proud to announce Peter Stark-Rogers, A.k.a Spiderman as an official member of the Avengers."
But do not fret because I am writing one called Show Me A Hero and I'll Write You a Tragedy which is really angsty and about IW so read that!
"I'm sorry."
"Babe, be nice" Steve lectured. As Peter chuckled at his father's childish humor.
“Maybe I’ll draw you sometime,” Steve said, holing Tony’s hand across the table. Tony nodded.
"You like Stark," Natasha stated, looking at Steve with soft eyes.
“Look, it’s alright.” Slowly, he got up from his comfortable position. He felt small enough when they were both standing but with him sitting, it was unbearable. “It isn’t forbidden anymore. You can even be in the army!” Tony flinched slightly, remembering that the whole topic was as hot as it could get. “As long as you don’t tell anyone there. Kind of a ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ policy.”
“Can’t you go out on your own? I’m not really hungry.” Steve smiled, showing off his dimples and perfectly white teeth. It was a good sight, a
But they have each other by their side throughout all of it - and Tony wouldn’t trade the life he has right now for anything else. He smiles and Steves smiles back. That darkness in his face is there as always but in these moments, these few seconds of peace and quiet that only belong to them both, Tony likes to imagine that it’s only a distant scar that Steve has almost forgotten about. It's still they when you look closely but it doesn't hurt him anymore.
The house was too big for one person alone. Steve didn’t need two floors, he barely needed anything besides the bedroom, bathroom and perhaps the kitchen. The rooms were too big and wide-opened, standing in such strong contrast to his old apartment in Brooklyn. Everything had been cramped there but that’s what made it his
“Coming,” he called out in hopes of calming Tony down a little and quickened his pace for the remaining distance between him and the entrance. As soon as Steve was close enough, his hand reached for the door handle, twisting it until he was able to pull the door opened, revealing the man on the other side.
Still, all the talking and biting back his laughter had left him starving. “Steve, I’m serious. I’m
He stepped to the side, gesturing for Tony to enter his house. That seemed to break whatever spell had taken ahold of the young man, the smirk falling from his face, replaced by a deep frown. “Right. Well, let’s check out my prison cell, shall we?”
“Or else?” There was something flickering behind the younger man’s eyes. Steve could see it, even with the limited view that he had of his face. The look on Tony’s face was impossible for him to read but it didn’t look pleasant.
Steve sighed, head dropping, eyes focusing on Tony’s shoes instead of his face. “I’m sorry.” He hadn’t known that. In retrospect, it made more sense that Howard had made his son come here than Tony actually asking to do so - but just because it made more sense didn’t mean that Steve had considered it. “I can call Howard if you want. Tell him that I’ve thought better of it and would prefer to spend the summer on my own.”
Tony nodded. “Cool. I’d say it would be smart to start with the end of the war that you didn’t get to witness.” He picked up another rock, sending it flying the same route the first one had taken. He watched as it disappeared in the water, once again leaving nothing behind but panicked little waves.
And having him as a house guest wasn’t
“Does that really matter? We’re both alright and I’m sure it won’t happen again.”
“What would be wrong with that? You’re small enough to fit on it,” Steve drily replied, not expecting Tony to actually laugh at his joke. But the young man did snort for a moment before fixing him with a look that required a proper answer. “I have a guest bedroom upstairs. You can stay there.”
He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to get any unpleasant images out of his head - but they were just so many. Water. Ice. The freezing wind hitting him through the broken glass. The clouds in the sky. Peggy’s voice, reminding him of a dance he’d missed. The darkness. The
“What else should you call me? Mister Stark?” A snort echoed through the hallway. “No, thank you.”
To say that he was uncomfortable was an understatement. Steve was thankful that his friend couldn’t see his face, couldn’t see how much he was disagreeing with that statement - but it wasn’t his place to tell him that.
“Yeah. Yeah, sure.” Tony eyes were already scanning the area for a much-desired parking spot. When he didn’t find one close enough, he settled for pulling over on the side of the road, content with the knowledge that almost no one would drive by. They were nearly in the middle of nowhere, after all. “We’re actually almost at our destination anyway.”
He had always thought of it as a stupid arrangement. What did it matter who you were into? It didn’t affect your work there in any kind of way, didn’t affect your skills or willingness to fight for your country. It just didn’t make sense.
“No, that was on me and I’m—”
every once in a while but, oh well.” One of Tony’s hands went up to run itself through the young man’s brown and slightly curly hair, effectively messing it up. “While we are at it though - what did the old man say to get you to agree on this? Sure, I’m highly intelligent and blah, blah, blah but you must have heard something entirely different from everyone else, even if you’ve only come back from your ice vacation like a month ago.”
It still felt like a punch in the gut, knowing that Hydra was still out there. Steve thought that with his sacrifice, Red Skull’s death, the prevention from their bombs destroying New York and the creation of SHIELD, it should have been enough to put a stop to them once and for all.
Rogers had given him a tour of the rest of the house, so locating the kitchen wasn’t a problem. Finding food, however, proved to be an impossible task. The fridge was empty, except for a carton of milk and a mass that Tony recognized as meat - but he couldn’t make himself a full course meal in the dead of the night.
Was Rogers serious? Tony would be able to locate more food in his own bedroom. One grab between the cushions of his couch would give him a half-eaten sandwich at the very least - which was half a sandwich more than what he currently had to show.
to deal with was the constant worry he felt for the younger man. Tony Stark, as far as Steve knew, wasn’t someone he should worry about.
“Slow down!”
It was unnatural for someone to sit with their back that straight, looking like they were more of a statue than a breathing person. It unnerved Tony to no end, especially since there was not a single light on in that room.
“Tony, it’s fine.” Ah, there it was. The exhaustion in Steve’s voice that Tony had been waiting for to return. It was the default tone the man used when talking to him. “Just keep your eyes on the road and make sure that we’ll get home in one piece.”
Spending the summer with Howard’s son and allowing the boy to help him adjust to this new time was the least Steve could do - or that was what he kept telling himself. If the media was to be trusted, Steve was in for a ride. Of course, he couldn’t trust everything that the press was saying, that much he had already learned during the last month (and his time before), but it was still giving him a reason to worry.
“Well, yeah. Can’t get myself into the right mindset without some sound to keep my thoughts from running away on me. It’s a real bitch, isn’t it?”
Soft playing music entering the room and filling Tony’s ears cut the sulking process rather short. His frown deepened as he got up, following the sound to its source. He couldn’t identify the exact track that was playing but it must have been Mozart; or another dead composer with a tragic life. Those awful music lessons had paid off.
“Did he now? Wow, would be nice to hear him say that to
that he needed to answer.
“Steve, please.” Every time someone called him Captain, Steve felt like he was back on the battlefield, back in the command centre, back where he actually belonged. The feeling that crept itself up his body and into his heart at the thought was one he’d like to ignore.
Contrary to his father’s belief, Tony was able to have serious conversations - as long as he was the one initiating and leading them. When someone else tried to do so, he preferred answering everything with his most of the time unappreciated humour.
The dry comments during the last few hours had cracked him up more than Tony would ever have admitted. Good to know that humour hadn’t changed that much during the past 40 years. Even though in the past, people hadn’t been as sarcastic as nowadays. Or maybe that was just Tony and had nothing to do with the time.
Frustrated and slightly lost on what to do, Tony turned back to the lake with a growl. He hadn’t
Before Steve could continue his silent inspection, Tony turned back, frown still in place. “Only works in my favour, to be honest.” He couldn’t tell if it was a joke or not. “Not gonna lie, if I had walked in here to see a picture of you and my father being all lovey-dovey, I probably would have lost it.” The words were harsh but the voice saying them was more humorous than anything else.
The weapon presentations his father forced him to attend a regular basis were enough to give him a rough idea about what soldiers had to go through, sleeping in an environment like that. Coming home and lying in bed with total silence filling the room must have felt like being dumped into cold water all of the sudden.
Why did he have to bring this up right now? The moment had been quiet, almost peaceful. Steve hadn’t looked worried for once. It had seemed like he actually enjoyed the rays of sun on his skin, the wind blowing in his face and the grass beneath his hands - and Tony had ruined the entire thing by opening his mouth; like always.
Everyone who had gotten the chance had moved on, leaving Steve alone in the ice-cold water, swimming against the unrelenting waves, trying not to get crushed.
Steve turned and Tony laughed, the sound loud and deep, echoing through the bleak room. These six weeks were going to be the death of him - that much he already knew.
The longer he stared into the deep oceans that were Steve’s eyes, the more he felt the glare on his face melt into nothingness until all that remained was a soft smile. The blue pools staring back at him widened slightly upon realizing. Tony opened his mouth, ready to say something - when his foot caught itself in a jutted out root and made him trip.
good at it.
Tony didn’t return the smile. The young man stared at him, frown firm in place. “What did you do that for?” Huh,
Steve kept a tight hold of him until he was back on his feet and no longer in danger of falling over. Only then, did he allow himself to pull back. Tony wanted to complain - the arms around him had been strong and secure; had made him feel safe. Now, he was on his own again. Alright, maybe he should stop that train of thought before it ran out of control.
to happy. Everyone deserved that.
Tony repeated his question, this time with Rogers actually listening. “I asked what you’d like to start with?” The confused face staring back at him made him roll his eyes. “Adjusting to your new life, remember? The whole reason I am here - to help you.” It was like talking to his grandmother with Alzheimer.
know how to have a laugh but not when the topic joked about involved the most traumatic event he’d ever been put through.
Frowning, Tony turns away from his momentarily abandoned task to further examine the small polaroid. It’s old; that much is clear. Steve all clad in a military uniform gives that away - as does the woman standing next to him with her arm wrapped around Steve’s waist. She's also wearing a uniform, though hers slightly differs from that of the man beside her.
It didn’t work. Rogers didn’t stop, didn’t even do so much as falter in his steps. He disappeared inside the house before Tony could do anything else, leaving him behind utterly confused.
Turning his head just enough to glance at the young man, Steve was quick to add “
Tony couldn’t help but chuckle. “Hey, if you wanna take your clothes off, I’m not going to argue. I bet you’re hiding something pretty nice under there.” The blush that spread across Steve’s cheeks was adorable. Sadly, Tony couldn’t appreciate it for very long since Steve turned away almost immediately to walk down the steps of his front porch.
Tony hated not talking. Sure, when he was busy tinkering away in his dad’s workshop, he could go without any conversation for hours - but his mind was usually focused on something else during those times. He had something to do, something to distract him, something that required every bit of attention he could muster up.
The walk back to the car was filled with a tense silence, Tony stumbling after Steve like a lost puppy with his head held low. This wasn’t a defeat per se but he’d keep his mouth shut until they were back at Steve’s home. The man couldn’t run away there - or it would be a lot harder to do so.
“Wow, you really don’t watch TV that often, do you?” Tony asked, taking Steve’s hand as they arrived. “Tony, this is amazing,” Steve said as they entered Tony’s floor. Tony mumbled thanks as he took off his jacket and threw it over the couch. “We’ve kinda screwed up this whole ‘first comes, love then comes marriage’ shit, so do you want to just cuddle and watch a horror movie?” Tony asked.
"What did you..." Tony said softly.
"There's a hoodie and a sweatshirt in the back, put that on." The driver said looking at Tony in the rearview mirror, luckily he didn't question why Tony was naked. Tony wondered if this was normal for New York.
-----------------------------------
Steve gathered his hands under the faucet and splashed his face with water, waking up from his haze. He stared at his tattoo drawn by Natasha. It was a silver dagger, running halfway down his arm reading: still, I rise in bold italics. That tattoo helped him get through the hard times. Steve would remember the metallic taste of his own blood as father’s fist came crashing into his face when he was younger. The worst of it occurred when he came out. Homophobic slurs rattled in Steve’s head as his father pushed his mother and ran towards Steve, punching, yelling, screaming. Whenever he had a flashback to his father’s harsh curses and punches, he would run a hand down the drawling reciting still I rise, still I rise, still I rise over and over in his head.
“I was wondering if you would like to have drinks again sometime?” Steve heard a gasp.
Peter groaned, "How did they even get your number? And anyway, you don't have to go I could always ask Aunt Nat and Uncl-"
Peter isn't stupid, but he's not paranoid, he decided to run a series of tests (at 2:00) and found out that it was, in fact, a spider bite. Peter also found out that the bite was harmless, but would give him increased stamina, speed, and what he discovered by himself (after many coffee runs) was that his fingertips stuck to material, and whenever something bad would happen (like coffee spilling) he would get a tingling feeling at the back of his head.
And the way he had looked at Steve burned a hole in the soldiers chest as he caught a glimpse of his own red, puffy eyes in the bathroom mirror. He hardly ever regretted something he had done when he knew he was being true. When he knew it was right. But after seeing the love of his life spit pure venom at him after he had come off that ship five years ago, ripping the nano tech suit emblem off his chest and throwing it in steves hand like his own heart, he had regretted everything.
They had succeeded but Steve felt like he had more than failed. And not so literally but more in the sense of only the feeling of failure. The dread that would come with knowing you couldnt help the people you loved the most at the time they needed you after working so hard to make sure they knew he would be there for them. He was mostly thinking about Nat in this way.
Steves chest skipped a small beat.
But where was Steve this whole time
“Im here.”
Once the two men started away from the house and down the driveway he was quiet at first and the two walked in silence for a while, going down a small road that lead into the woods, that was until Tony decided to speak first because Steve brain was folding in on itself.
“You get rest and ill be back shortly.”
Tony was referring to their current romantic state of residence, given they were um, an item at that moment in time.
“In the end i cared more about who i was, who we were.”
“Okay so we run through again” Bruce said as he pushed some buttons on the control panel that Steve couldnt see. “You have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken or else youll open up some nasty timeline holes that may cause a problem.”
Along with the other stones there was the time stone that Steve thought would go back to Strange but the timeline was that of a completely different time and he got to meet someone on The doctors side of the puzzle who strangely knew all of what had happened in both times. The “Ancient One” as she explained herself to be was appreciative that bruce had followed through even though it was Steve returning the stone.
He, in the best of intentions in thought, wished he had been brainwashed when hiding the fact that then man he was defending killed Tonys parents, or when he smashed the power source to tonys suit leaving him alone and immobilized but very able to cut the cord, with angry hands, on their relationship.
Game time.
Steve was trying to hide his anxiousness as his heart sped through his chest.
But Tony didnt ask anything as he stepped closer to Steve, like really close, and put his head in the very middle of the mans broad chest. Steves breath hitched as he stared down at the dark brown hair atop themans head while he felt Tonys arms come to rest around his torso.
Steve didnt have time to look at the room before he all about tossed Tony on the bed, crawling over him soon after.
“I just didn’t think you’d even stand me even thinking about coming to your house, much less hearing me through or even-“ his words hitched in his throat. “Forgiving me.”
“Will do” his voice coming over the phone changed to a gentler and slower tone, “how are you holding up, Cap”
Returning the stones was actually fairly easy. Given returning the soul stone to his arch nemesis was shocking in its own messed up way, Steve was kind of glad to see the bastard and his eternal punishment.
“Uh, Bruce said something about Lang getting more of the the Pym particles for the return mission.” Sam said.
Steve stood and stared trying to breath correctly and stay leveled and he waited for Tony to say something as he watched the mans face like he could see a wall coming down behind his skin.
She sharply pointed that finger at Steve.
But alas, not in favor of Steves blood pressure, Tony continued. “But, luckily for you she said to tread lightly. Which i translated to: dont talk about it, and forget it happened pretty much. You can breath now, Cap.”
Secret bunker, Steve assumed. Of course.
His voice was very calm and almost soft. There was no harsh tone like the day he stepped off that ship and threw a 500 pound bag of pain and hurt and anger at the man who was now within touching distance.
“I-i know, believe me i know, that Sorry does not help- no it does not fix this” he said his hands coming down in emphasis toward the space between them.
Deep breath, and then Steve was turning the handle and opening the door into the hallway. The house was pretty much empty as everyone was mostly outside. Talking and trying to keep each other up right after the wake. Steve knew he should be out there too but he couldn’t. He just couldn’t.
“Hey! Dont leave marks” Tony said, his legs coming back up to wrap around the whole lot of needy Steves on top of him. His hands wormed their way between the two bodies to catch the base of the soldiers shirt and thrust his hands beneath it, fingers crawling up pounds of muscle.
“Just keep on this road until you get to the highway.”
“And i dont mean like, until you go back to your time. But i think you can catch my drift. Ive always come to a wild conclusion that you are smarter than the average bear even if it seems impossible.”
The man beside him turned his head.
Steve seemed to of stopped breathing as he stared back, his eyes stinging with emotion he didnt want to show, didnt want to confirm Tonys indication
Everything was falling into place. And after returning the last Stone to its place on a planet called Morag, steve set the dial to his time stamp where he intended to meet Tony. Here goes everything, he thought as he slapped his palm down on the button and was thrusted forward in time.
“Got it.” The silver case in his hand felt heavy and he was determined to quickly return the stones.
His heart went back to their past relationship, many nights full of shared touches and hot kisses. Feeling like Steve could never feel 70 years worth cold again with the warmth that radiated off of his boyfriends soundly sleeping body next to him on crisp mornings.
“But im seeing you now, ive seen all the mistakes ive made and how in many ways they will never be righted. You needed me.”
“Gotta give you some shit, winghead. Get off here.”
Steve gave a small sigh as he looked the place over. Tony has always assumed and planned for the worst. And he honestly has/had every right to. The next thoughts Steve shoved from his mind as he turned back to Tony.
Pepper, Steve thought joyfully but then sadly as he knew she was very happy this way and didnt know what was to come..
Steve shook his head. “Nothing” he lied. “It was just made very clear it was important and in was just wondering when they were going to execute it is all”
“I do, but im also not surprised it exists.”
“Where are we going?” He asked as his car crawled and bounced through the dirt.
“It wasnt too hard, at least not for me. Wizard lady shows up three weeks ago and tells me this and for a while i really sit and wonder who that might be, the person shes talking about. And if im being frank i dont really ask why anymore, so i was very hyper aware and honestly very afraid. I moved Pepper and Morgan out immediately to stay in Happys care up state for the first week but nothing...happened. Nothing out of the ordinary at least. But still i wondered. Anyone who called i tried to be ready. But then a few more days came and went and, nothing.”
He was embracing him but in a more intiment  way. He heard a soft voice speak up from against his chest, feeling the movements against his shirt.
He glanced and saw Tony shug in the dimming light.
“The bald, wizard lookin lady told me to ‘expect a visitor that was not from your time though it is very important to tread lightly’”.
“I dont see why you cant do it , Cap” Bruce Banners voice came out of Steves phone as the man paced his new appartment. He had tried to give things a few days and find a new place and settle in before he spoke to bruce about being the one to return the infinity stones. And it had been a pain stakingly slow few days as it was all Steve could think about.
“Thats awesome, Bruce. Let me know then?”
He was almost a completely different man than the one who spat venom in his face that day he came back from space. That was the last day Steve had seen him and of course he never came around in those five years to see how he was actually doing and maybe he should of come sooner.
Pepper turned to Tony who had walked down the hall and called to him,
But now its gone. Tony is gone. And the time together they had while working to bring everyone back would not sink deep enough into steves skin. It wasn’t enough. He didnt get to say goodbye. Didn’t get to apologize.
“I do. That was so long ago”
“Wha-“ Tony lurched backward with the sudden 200 pound weight of a super soldier being thrown around him. He barely had the time to comprehend what actually was happening here while Steve hugged him a little too tightly.
Steve smiled as he signaled and slowed down to take the turn onto another back road that seemed to go deeper and deeper into a forested property. A few minutes in the road turned to dirt and rocks. The sun was below the horizon and the thick trees shielded them from the light, driving steve to flip his headlights on.
Steve gave him a quizzical side glance which earned a playful eyeroll from the genius.
Steve swallowed hard. He could do this.
“Do you remember our time at Clints house?”
He pulled into the rocky driveway, hearing the rocks crunch under the weight of the tires. The first thing he saw was the beautiful house against the back drop of the crystal, still lake behind it. The over all scean of the foresty trees and foliage in its full opacity as it was early summer made the scenery even more pleasing as Steve brought his car to a park next to one of the cars, obviously Tonys by the over the top sports car vibe, parked in the driveway.
The record thus far.
He quoted.
Tony had opened a closet in the hall and was grabbing a jacket and what seemed to be a pair of keys.
His reflexes were pitch perfect and when he felt a hand on his chest he grabbed onto what felt like a wrist attached to that hand lightning fast.
Tony, he thought, closing his eyes for a second. He could do this.
“Why here?”
“Are you really from the future?”
The timeline was there, Steves intentions were set and he had never felt so ready and so not ready at the same time.
“What are you doing here?”
“Holding on.” He said, clearing his throat and the sudden rock that seemed to appear in his chest. But he needed to sound stable or Bruce would not let him do this.
“Neither can i.” He said, “home then?”
But still. That phrase, “i wish you came here for anything else”. It shook Steve because he treated Tony, in that moment, like a tool that was only interesting to him when he needed it. Given that was nowhere near true but if Tony wasnt the man he was and didnt jump into the idea anyway, he would of sat and thought about that fact steve hadnt seen him in 5 years and then came to him only when he needed his genius.
Steve, shocked, slowly wrapped his arms over the man as he felt Tonys body shudder under his embrace. This only made Steve hold on tighter, his hand had a death grip on Tonys that rested in between their bodies.
Steve made a point of pushing back until he had forced his own into the genius’ mouth giving him no other option but to let Steve take him over, his hands coming to grip the mans ass. This earned a muffled noise out of Tony that sounded against their mouths.
The “Ancient one”. The lady he returned the time stone to. Stange had supposedly been trained by her and if his knowledge of even just the basics of his amount of power were from her..shit.
Steve felt like he just got off of a very fast, very vigorously unstable amusement park ride. All he could do was but shake his head, looking away and damning this god damn man and his genius.
They continued to roll through the sticks, wispy branches from the trees at their sides dragged lazily across the metal of Steves grey Prius. The light around them was a very deep blue shade and the trees were turning into their nightly shades of black as they became silhouettes against the darkening sky.
Fanfic chapter 1
His mouth felt dry.
Suddenly a jolt of realization went through Steve.
This kiss felt like home against his lip as he pressed back, participating in the kiss as he put his hands to Tonys sides and pulled him closer by his jacket.
“First off, while you slow your heart rate a bit” Tony said, glancing at Steve whos face must of given everything away. That and he tried to breath while his limbs tingled.
“Not a single thought of Iron man”
His first word came out like broken glass up his throat, “Tony...”
He could tell the Tony was trying to get himself together and Steve honestly felt the same so he just rubbed the mans back and drank in the warmth and the familiar shape of a body he felt would never rest against hit again.
“And do you know when they are doing that?”
Steve did as directed and he watched the sky, that was beginning to turn a blue orange as the day grew shorter and shorter, as the two sat in silence with the hum of the vehicle around them.
“Um, can we, and feel free to say no and tell me to leave, go for a walk?”
“I know. Trust me i do.”
“You had and honestly always will have the right to hate me, hate this and shove me out for the rest of my life”
Steve smiled at her and honestly it was too good to see her this way. He quickly threw her most recent state of well being, well in his original timeline, out of his mind.
“Tony, wait up!” Steve shouted as he trampled through the thicket, trying to keep Tony in his line if sight as he waved his arms through leaves and twigs that smacked agaisnt his face as soon as he pushed more away. He was more a city guy.
Steve decided to break the silence.
(Steves POV)
He turned off the car and in the seat beside him, Tony was taking off his seatbelt and opening the car door. After pulling the keys from the ignition, Steve did the same, his eyes following Tonys outline as he skirted around the front of the car to step into the tangle of branches amongst the trees in front if them.
Several years and he didnt come back after leaving Tony in that bunker. He knew he was right about Bucky and eventually Tony did too but he also kept Buckys secret about killing his parents and he didnt have to. He left him there. Broken and trapped in his powered down suit in a struggle to keep him from killing Bucky. But he could of prevented the hate. He could of prevented the lie. But he didnt and Tony had the absolute right to hate him. To throw him out and make whatever they could of became wither and die.
Steve shut the car door and quickly followed.
“Youre late” he grumbled but Steve knew even Tonys sarcastic nature could not be masked by any level of grief.
“This was quite the surprise, Steve”
“You leaving?” He asked stopping in front of the other man.
Tony left to fight in space before Steve got involved with the Thanos situation but also came back after the snap. So it would have to be in the timeline before the time travel but after tony had been in space.
He had thought through this so many times in the last few days.
“Ill talk to you later, Bruce. Let me know whats up” he said finishing up his convo and setting the phone down on the counter in the kitchen where he had stopped pacing.
He shut the closet and kissed his wife on the head.
Tony threw his head back at that.
The world was yet again at a crisis, at the time feeling like the biggest one yet and everyone was in their own way compromised from Wandas mind tricks, her attempt to tear them apart from the inside as she showed them their most in depth weakness, their fear, a raw and venerable spot inside each and everyone of them that crippled them from the inside out.
Steve kept his stance but tears were flowing down his cheeks.
For the rest of yours, the sad thought ripped through his head as he spoke. “But you never deserved any of that shit, and i should of never left you in that bunker. I was too caught up in my pride, my investment in my friend who i saw too brightly with clouded eyes.”
Steve couldnt open his mouth. Tony was here. He was alive he was just... here. In front of him and he was trying to breathe in every detail of his lively, healthy but also snarky as always, face. But honestly he couldnt because he probably stopped breathing 5 minuets ago.
But Steve did, which made this time he had here, with Tony, so much more important.
“What ever you say, Marty Mcfly”
He hoped he didnt look like he didnt care about the people back there grieving and he hoped Sam would just see it as he cared too much and couldnt sit in a place that tore him apart from the inside out.
