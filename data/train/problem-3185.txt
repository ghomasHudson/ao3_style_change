“ Good, good.” Dean is still just staring. Christ, what is wrong with him? It’s been five fucking years. He’s an adult. He’s over this. “ You look good… I mean, it looks like you’re doing good.” Shutupshutupshutup! “Doing well.”
Dean’s been an avid fan of the bar and its owner since his very first visit. That just so happened to end with a memorable one night stand with said owner and managed to not be awkward the morning after. Or when Dean moved here and discovered Benny three years married to a Greek spitfire named Andrea and they’d all just had a good laugh over it.
Honestly, Dean doesn’t think he can stomach anything at the moment, the nerves from yesterday morphing into a tight little ball of worry in his gut. He shakes his head and waves a hand at the skillet. “ Going out, but thanks anyway.”
“ Pistachio pudding.” So he’ll be lecturing Meg instead of Claire.
awwww, makin me blush, cas ;)
“ No, I’m not!” Dean valiantly blinks away the tears and hides a sniffle beneath a cough. “ Got like, allergies and stuff.” Claire nails him with an exact copy of Cas’ Bitch Face #3 and Dean laughs through another sniff, wiping his eyes with the collar of his flannel shirt.“ Okay, you got me. You were right. Your Dad was right. It’s a kick in the chest and pulls all the heartstrings.”
find your body.”
Claire sighs softly, snuggling deeper into her pillow, and Castiel takes his hand away. He struggles to stand without grunting- much like Dean- and wonders briefly when he’d gotten old. Another pause, a few steps to the opposite wall to check on Jack. The toddler is deep asleep, completely undisturbed by recent events. Castiel is about to resist the urge to pet the boy’s head, but thinks better of it and leans down to place a kiss on Jack’s sleep warm cheek. Jack snorts softly and turns his head.  Well, Castiel can take a hint.
“ That’s right. No phones while driving. I’m glad you reminded me, Claire.” He smiles at his daughter. She’s right, of course. Dean would have had to drive Sam and Jess to the hospital, then most likely have to return to the Moore-Winchester house to gather their things and go back to the hospital. Unless they stop at the house first before heading into the city. Castiel feels the smile lift the corners of his mouth because he seriously doubts with the level of panic happening between the two Winchesters that even level headed Jess could get them to make any side trips.
Dean ducks back inside when Castiel reaches the steps, allowing him space to enter. Castiel locks and bolts the door, arms the security system.
“ May I borrow Charlie for a moment?”
“ You mean you don’t choose to read
The boy isn’t having an easy time of it, grabbing the blanket to pull himself up only to have it slide down with him. Dean rolls over from his stomach to his back, throwing the blanket back over the couch cushions, exposing his borrowed-pajama clad body to the cold air. Jack is quick to accept the invitation and Dean just manages to get his hand over his groin to protect it from pointy elbows and jabby knees as Jack grabs fistfuls of Dean’s t-shirt ( and the flesh underneath) and hauls himself up. It takes a long moment for Jack to settle and Dean wonders if he’ll be able to fall back to sleep when the little body finally slumps bonelessly atop him. Dean drops the blanket over them both, tucking it under his side to cocoon them together. Jack rubs his face against Dean’s chest, then stills with a small sleepy sigh. Dean curves his arm over the boy, holding him securely in place. Several peaceful minutes pass and Dean can feel himself slowly sliding back into sleep, eased by the comfort Jack’s warm presence.
Two hours pass relatively quickly. The clinic group finishes up their dinners, but continues to order appetizers to share around the table. Beer and coke continues to flow freely. Including a vibrantly pink concoction that gets passed around the table, everyone using their own straws to sample the fruity cocktail. Dean catches Zeke leaning down to speak directly into Pamela’s ear and a tiny smile lifts the corners of his mouth when he realizes that Zeke is describing the crazy drink to his girlfriend.
“ Pop!” Jack interjects, pointing excitedly at Dean.
Jack has to get his pajamas off first because if he tries to do it standing on the stool he will fall over into the big potty again  and be all icky and Daddy will be sad and Jack wants Daddy to be proud of him so Jack unzips his pajamas
He misses them suddenly. Very, very much. Castiel has moments like these from time to time. Sometimes at work, sometimes when out solo. Even before Jack came into the world, before they were both put into his care, Castiel would come across a particularly playful dog in the park and think how much Claire would love to pet it. Or sometimes, when he was alone in his apartment, the quiet settling too heavy and too late to call, Castiel would wish to hear her bubbling giggle and exasperated, “
“ Seriously, though, Cassie,” Gabriel pipes up as he drags a child-sized Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle into his lap. “ Sounds like Dean spends more time at your place than he does his own now. And the rest of the time, you and the kids are packed into his shoebox apartment.”
He’s warm and happy and he closes his eyes for just a few seconds…
best friend.
“ Holy shit, that’s Hallmark levels of sentimentality,” Meg snorts over the line.
*DRINKING
You didn’t make it weird. Pretty sure that failed peach made it weird. And no, I’m not drinking.
Dean closes his gaping mouth with a click of teeth and gets a firm grip on his nerves as Sam herds Jess toward the staff hall door amidst a chorus of “ Good luck!,” from staff and patrons alike.
Until Charlie enters from the adult side staff door, full totes on both shoulders and a large bin in her hands overflowing with costumes. Castiel jumps up to help, taking the heavy bin from the petite woman and hauling it to her desk in the corner opposite his and Garth’s; double sided, ceiling high shelf system separating their areas. Castiel places the bin on the floor in front of Charlie’s desk and then reaches for one of the bulging tote bags. “ Was it a good turnout?”
“ Is he like some kind of doomsday prepper or something?” Sam’s head is ducked to look out of Jess’ window.
Missouri always gets to go first once karaoke starts. She sings Aretha’s
Dean laughs softly, old faded memories swimming in his head. “ Some idea.” Too quiet for Sam to hear because Dean isn’t about guilt tripping over their early years. Instead, he ambles over to the glider in the corner of the room by the window and eases himself onto the heavily padded seat.  “ I’ve got the day off and a full night’s sleep so feel free to konk out for a bit.”
It’s different from that first time, in September. Dean had been trying to be gentle then, taking it slow and feeling his way through the tentative interaction. Now he just wants to devour Cas, to touch every inch of skin, to press every pent up emotion into the curves and angles hidden under the baggy clothes.
“ I will. I’m really sorry, Dean.”
Castiel grins, even though he knows Dean can’t see it. “ I don’t, no. But I decided to just go with it.”
“ We’re the same age, old woman.” Castiel snarks back, but it ends in another yawn and ruins the effect somewhat. “ Let me check on the children and I’ll walk you to your car.”
He laughs a little when Dean flips the comforter all the way to the foot of the bed, with  an extra dramatic flourish, then pulls back the covers and holds them up for Castiel to crawl over the wide expanse of mattress and settle near the wall. In all honesty, he’s not married to either side of the bed, but there is something comforting about having the wall at his back and Dean’s solid body at his front when the other man slides next to him, pulling the sheet and blanket up to their shoulders.
Cain looks around the area, keen blue eyes scanning the road and tree line on either side of the cement pillars. All brightly lit by spotlights on the trees. “ I don’t think anyone’s waiting for access. “
“ Um, I didn’t know they wanted a dog.”
But Dean sees his situation a bit differently. He snatches Castiel’s cup and bounces to his feet, joining Cain and claiming the jug of Kool-Ade. When he reaches across the older man, his left t-shirt sleeve rides up and Claire’s keen eyes spot the flash of color instantly. “ Dory!”
“ Dude, are you sure?” Aaron is also wide eyed and concerned.
Castiel smiles and pulls into a Dollar General lot a few minutes away. He parks the car and pulls out his phone. “ I’m going to ask Mr. Cain if he’d like a treat. “
“ I’m not matchmaking here,” Sam begins, feeling only mildly reprimanded by his wife. “ I just think they’d be good for each other. In a completely platonic way.”
Music and dialogue still float quietly from the tv, but not enough to muffle the rustle of fabric, their breathy little noises.
It’s not as though Dean’s never played footsie before, but something about the very deliberate motions against his socked foot and the small confident grin on Cas’ face has his own heating up.
It’s a short fifteen minutes later when Dean selects
“ What do you want to do?” Charlie asks, staring at the confirmation.
“ I cut up the apples!” Claire adds, proud of her culinary skills. “ And made the fran-gee-pane.”
It had scared Castiel, that strong wave of desperate fear at the thought of walking back into his living room to find it empty. He’s still nervous about it, despite his trust in Dean. And Dean… Dean had made Claire’s night, her week, with the gadget that Castiel knows isn’t cheap and is definitely not a toy. But it had brought such comfort to Claire that Castiel didn’t have the heart to deny the gift.
“ Don’t.” Cas’ voice is a grating whisper, his entire body tense in Dean’s arms.
Cain levels Dean with a you’ve-got-to-be-kidding-me stare. “ Dean, nearly every single photo you owned was of Sam. And you delighted in showing them off, so yes, while I wasn’t certain of his surname, I was reasonably sure that he was the older version of the younger brother you so doted on.”
“ You’ll be alright?” Cain’s thumbs are hovering over the keypad, needing assurance before sending his message.
Castiel swallows thickly, nodding, getting out a quiet, “Thank you,” as he lifts his gaze to meet Cain’s empathetic blue eyes. “ For everything you’ve done for us.”
Hands on him. Pain and pressure and screaming.
“ Well, I don’t.” Dean sets his face in a determined frown.
“ These work better.” Cas whispers, breathing still a bit fast. Blue eyes hazy.
“ She’s so badass.” Dean smiles goofily at the TV.
pictures?” Claire interrupts before Jack can respond. Then turns her question on Jack. “ You wanna show Dean our pictures, Jack?”
There’s another moment of silence, then they both bust out laughing. Closing the distance between them, Castiel gives a wave. “ Hello, Dean.”
His evening goes about as planned. Alex is ready for his bottle before Dean is halfway done eating his bowl of soup. Alex is not impressed by the sounds of
“ True. But, Nicholas likes to keep tight control over his employees and his partners, even his more casual ones. It’s one of the reasons Kelly left him. “ Castiel sends a silent prayer to Kelly and Amelia now, to watch after the children. “ I believe it’s more likely that she’s under his orders. Both to watch me and to send these as a way for him to contact me without breaking the terms of the restraining order.”
“ Good plan, Jack,” Dean praises. It’ll take longer to load, sure, but it’ll be fun for Jack and boost his self confidence since he’s helping. Dean opens the dryer door wide and picks Jack up around the waist, lifting him to eye level with the opening. “ Throw it in.”
The moment of insanity is gone and everything comes rushing back. Castiel grins, leans forward and presses a loud smacking kiss against Dean’s forehead. “ Mwuah!” Claire and Jack are rolling. Castiel carefully pulls Dean back onto his feet as he leans back, “ Yes. Yes I am.” Oddly, his face isn’t burning off with embarrassment. He feels more irritated at having to stop than anything else. He’s so absorbed in his thoughts that he doesn’t realize Dean is still holding onto him until suddenly he lets go and the cool air chills the warm spots where the man was held against him.
, and for the finale, recites a Monster Protection spell over a real cauldron full of various sized bric-a-brac to hand out as talismans. The children are in awe and the parents are equally impressed.
“ I’m calling in the solid you owe me from helping you move in.” Sam steps all the way into Dean’s room, expression harried.
“ No, the point is that you are a wonderful person and Castiel is a wonderful person and I believe you would both benefit from a relationship. With each other, in case I’m not making myself clear.”
I’m sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
“ I am totally untraceable, don’t worry.”
His phone buzzes in his back pocket. Dean letting him know he’s on his way, Castiel is fairly certain. A quick check confirms it and Castiel leaves Jack to his toy basket and heads to the kitchen to unlock the door. He still can’t bring himself to simply leave the door open as he goes about his business, but he does stand just outside under the carport, shooting forward once Dean turns the corner of the lattice partition and taking one of the heavy tote bags. The younger man is also going for comfort; naturally torn light wash jeans, black tshirt, red plaid flannel on top. His canvas jacket flaps in the wind.
“ I like the beard,” they compliment in unison, breaking the quiet together with soft laughter. Cain smooths the hair over his chin. Dean nervously tugs at his own whiskers.
“ Apple tarte tatin. Jack picked the recipe out of that new cookbook Benjamina recommended.” Cas hands a serving knife to Dean and helps Jack back into his booster seat. “ And he helped make the dough.”
Dean can only stare at the man across the table, who has also paused in his work to stare back at Dean.
Braids gone awry and an emergency pull-up.
“ Oh, well, I decided to give the loving couple some First Christmas Family time with Alex, so I’m just gonna stay here, eat lots of junk food, and binge
“ Calling bullshit.”
Which leaves Dean with Castiel and Jack. Jack seems fine just staring between them, while the adults stand rooted awkwardly to the ground. Dean is the first to crack. “ Is this weird? Did I make this weird? ”
Dean ducks out from around the unit and spots Jess’ very suspicious smile. “ Was it on this whole time?”
“ Yes!” Castiel practically whines. “ Which is not something I’m experienced with.”
That is also not totally unusual, Dean often stays past the children’s bedtimes and he and Castiel watch something not approved for little ones or sometimes simply talk.
“ Yes, thanks, “ Castiel replies automatically, eyes locked onto the screen where the words are frozen so innocently. Two enthusiastic compliments, from a friend or even an acquaintance, would be happily received. But this… He feels threatened, cornered, pushing toward panic. But he swallows it down, adds the email to the proper folder and signs out of his computer. Then Castiel gets up, walks across the workroom, plasters a small smile on his face and pokes his head through the adult side staff door.
Songs referenced:
Oxygen is finally needed and they break apart. At the lips only. Foreheads pressed together, noses brushing, bodies still flush. Dean pulls one arm around front to squeeze between them, hand cupping Cas’ cheek. Thumb caressing his temple, fingers curling in the short dark hair above his ear. The emotions swelling up are threatening to overwhelm him again. When Dean glances up, over Cas’ head, he catches movement in the storm door above them.
Castiel silently escorts her to the entry where she flips a small wave and beaming smile over her shoulder before the automatic doors close behind her. He lets out a shuddery breath he didn’t realize he was holding. In fact, now that the immediate concern has been taken care of, all of Castiel’s muscles give an ache of protest before slowly relaxing. Even as the unease in his mind threatens to swallow him up.
Laughter, smiles, hot chili. It’s light and easy again. But Dean is mulling over everything Cain said to him, taking the what ifs and rolling them around in his brain. Because Cain is right, of course. Dean has seen all the little looks, soaked up the little touches, memorized every slip of Cas’ determined exterior. Like that kiss that had nearly been a direct hit on Dean’s mouth before Cas had detoured to the safety of his forehead. And Dean notices these things because they’re the same exact slip-ups that he makes himself on a near daily basis. Cain is right, and they’re both idjits, as Bobby would say.
“ Good, good.” The balding man rubs his hands together, in a not quite maniacal way. More like a child imitating his favorite cartoon villain. “ You seem to be getting along over there. Garth speaks very highly of you.”
“ Daddy, please… I h-had a-- had a bad dream...”
Dean watches the figure walk quickly back to the car. “ I’d say a woman just by the way they move,” he agrees with Cain’s assessment. Even from the higher angle, he can tell the person is much smaller than the average male, both height and weight wise. They either have very short hair, or have it tucked under the ballcap. And he can just make out heeled boots on their feet. “ And those boots. I don’t know too many men who’d be able to walk confidently in heels that high.”  He checks the time stamp and sees it’s been less than ten minutes since the package was left.
Home. To Cas.
“ Daddy! Din!” Jack is struggling to get around Claire, arms out for hugs. He’s wearing last night’s Minions 2019 paper crown he decorated at a library program.
Castiel groans, grabbing Meg’s wrist and heading back toward the main drive and Meg’s car. “ Meg is going home. Good night, Meg.” He drags her toward the little Hyundai.
, aiming the remote back at the garage door to close it up, when he hears his name being hollered by a familiar voice from the other side of the car. Dean laughs at the sight of two little hands suddenly curved over the edge of the open passenger side window, then flinches at the thuds of little feet hitting the bottom half of the door; Jack clearly attempting to climb into the Impala the hard way.
“ Yes, sir. I even remembered a box of tissues for the car. ” Dean heartily agrees, returning his teasing grin.
Castiel could tell the truth. But there’s so much going on in the moment, the last thing he wants to deal with right now is some weird dramatic reveal that will greatly alter the course of their first night together.
Because Castiel knows this is not over. And he dreads the thought of Nicholas Adler’s next move.
He’s gonna get that bear!  So Jack grabs the blankets and climbs up onto the bed next to Daddy’s feet and the bear’s feet and crawls
Castiel takes a slow, deep breath through his nose, his gaze never straying from the woman’s face, and pushes on. He needs information, not bragging. “ Are we done here?” Castiel has his suspicions, but would like to have them confirmed.
Dean is very confused now. “ Okay, what's Cas got to do with this?”
In reply, Cas tilts his face up and leans in for a long, slow kiss, his hands never leaving their places at Dean’s waist. Dean lets his own hands drop away, curls them loosely around Cas’ elbows, just wanting the extra little points of physical contact to steady himself.
Jack loves Daddy. Jack loves Dean. Jack loves Claire and Mr. Cain and Miss Ambriel and Miss Lenore and Garth and Miss Benjamina and the lady that gave him a strawberry at the grocery store and the cats that live in Mr. Cain’s barn and--
Not that he’s complaining. Back in Sioux Falls, Dean had always volunteered to work the Halloween shift at the ER to let some other nurse enjoy the night with their kids. The night mostly involved a waiting room full of teens who failed to complete their stupid dares (or completed them to an unfortunate result) and the panicked parent who insisted there were razor blades in her kids’ candy and wanted them to x-ray the entire caboodle. But it was also prime time for hit-and-runs and violent brawls. Dean definitely does not miss those cases.
“ I’ve got you. I’ve got you.”
“ Seriously, it’s okay, Cas. Promise.” Dean waves it off and closes his door. “She gets worse just being parked at the grocery store. I’ll see ya later, ‘kay?” He waves to Cas and the kids and carefully pulls off, completely happy with this little detour.
Is that why your socks are thick enough for arctic exploration? Seeing those make me hot.
from your beatiful baby blues to your crooked left pinky toe
And once he gets there, Dean has to admit that he enjoys the atmosphere. Not enough to regularly get up before the sun, but enough to hit up once or twice a month during season. And Jess has already made plans for the huge holiday market they hold each year in November.
The heating kicks back on. The television program ends and another begins. Cas dumps a squirt of high-end unscented lotion into the mix. Their breaths grow more ragged between exchanged endearments and curses.
“ Can I see Dean?”
Cain mirrors his frown and eyes the bag. Dean turns to make sure his shadow isn’t blocking their view and carefully reaches into the oversized garbage bag. His fingers touch cardboard, a handle. Grabbing the handle securely, Dean lets the bag fall to the ground, exposing a decorated cardboard box folded into the shape of a house.
Dean can’t see Sam’s expression, but there’s a pause, and Jess pulls her husband down for a kiss that he eagerly returns. Jess is creepily perceptive, as always. Dean remembers John showing him how to buckle baby Sammy into his one and only car seat the morning they left that first motel. It’s hazy, but there had been many more instances until Sam outgrew it and they didn’t have money for a new toddler sized one. So Sam shared Dean’s seatbelt, Dean’s arm tight around him.
He’s stayed late enough times to know the Novak-Kline bedtime routine. It’s actually incredibly clever. Once they read a couple books together, Cas gives Jack his bath while Claire reads on her own, then while Claire is in the bath, Cas puts Jack down. Luckily for Cas, both kids seem like good sleepers. To Dean, at least. Jack goes down easy, so Cas is back in the bathroom right as Claire is getting into the tub. Cas has admitted to Dean that he’s uncertain when he should stop assisting his daughter with bath time as she gets older, his justified concern with slip-and-falls warring with his fear of impropriety. Dean has assured Cas that Claire will happily kick him out of the bathroom when she’s good and ready to be on her own. For now, Dean is impressed with Cas’ personal compromise which has him sitting on the closed toilet lid, facing the door, waiting for Claire to ask for assistance.
Dean busts out laughing.
“ DEAN!” Sam is shouting from the other end of the hallway, exterior staff door wide open to the chilly night air.
“ Don’t I know it.” Andrea laughs back and spins away to take care of the other customers.
Castiel smiles when his phone buzzes, vibration muffled slightly by the stack of folders beneath it. It’s from Dean, again. And Castiel honestly doesn’t mind in the least.
“ Good plan, boss.” Dean manages a smile for her. “ Where to?”
“ I’m s-sorry, Dean. Yes,” Cas gains a moment of clarity amidst the heated chaos and looks down, slipping his hand under the pink waistband and firmly grasping Dean’s cock. His thumb presses just beneath the glans sticking out.
Too far away is safer for Dean, though. Castiel smacks the intrusive thought away, but the truth of it echoes still. This is dangerous. Simply being acquainted with Castiel puts people in the line of fire and Castiel doesn’t want to drag Dean into this mess.  That would be the best thing to do. Keep Dean at a distance, let Dean keep his distance. Distracted by his conflicting emotions, Castiel nods absently. “ It’s Christmas break, for all of us, so I’ll let them be. I’ll carry them to bed later.”
The nurse from before, Alex- Castiel has spoken with her on several occasions- brings the promised tissues and Castiel would question the amused expression on her young face but Jack has a coughing fit and he’s too busy wiping the snotty nose and carefully covering the hacking mouth.
Dean shrugs it off. “ I guess. He’s a nice guy. ”
Jack slides around the corner of the couch and immediately climbs up beside Dean. Only to stop short at the sight of Alex in his usual spot; aka, Dean’s lap. The look of utter confusion on Jack’s face has Dean tilting his head back for a full belly laugh. Alex jerks and stares up at his uncle.
“ Yes, well, regardless, we've heard nothing but great things about you and I just wanted you to know that we’ve noticed your hard work.” Zachariah pats Castiel's shoulder.
“ Stop being distracting. Oh, shit.”
Castiel rolls his eyes even though he knows Gabriel can’t see him but knows exactly what he’s doing anyway. “ My underwear is none of your business. I wanted to let you know that Meg just texted me. She’s too sick to watch the children tonight.”
Dean? Dean is a bear?
“ See ya, Dean-o!”
Dean gloves up and grabs the slim package from the tray Alex has set up for him, tearing the plastic open to retrieve a long thin swab. He shoots Castiel a sympathetic look and firmly grasps Jack’s chin. “ Real quick now.” Swab in, twirl, retreat. Jack is, naturally, not pleased and displays his unhappiness with a pitiful sob that turns into a deep hacking cough as he hides in his father’s shirt. Dean’s heart always breaks a little when he has to be the bad guy. “ Not fun. I know, buddy.” He shoves the swab into its protective case and strips the gloves away as he addresses Castiel. “ Results will take a few minutes. You need anything? Some water? Or a coffee? Or I’ve got the nice extra soft Kleenex at my desk?” So, he might be going a bit overboard here, but Jesus the guy looks just as worn down as his kid and Dean seriously can’t resist those kicked puppy eyes.
“ You’re older. Fuck you,” Castiel jabs back. Then groans as he stretches his arms high above his head, working out the last bit of tightness in his back and shoulders. He’s been hunched over far too long, muscles protesting the strained position. Grabbing the glass from the coffee table, Castiel pads across the hardwood  to the kitchen tiles of the open floor plan, and rinses his glass in the sink. His body appreciates the movement, slowly loosening up with the motion and last of the whiskey.
Sam pauses, picking at the label on his beer bottle, before quietly continuing. “ The women Nick murdered were sisters. Amelia Kline was Claire’s mother; Cas’ ex. The other was Jack’s mother, Kelly. Nick Adler is his father.”
It’s Castiel’s most cherished possession.
Castiel squashes down the immediate rush of blood to certain extremities as he interprets the double entendre. Lord God in Heaven, this man! Well, that deserves an equally suggestive response. He arranges his face into its usual neutral expression, tightens his hold on his partner, and dips Dean with a savage confidence.
“ Threatening?”
“ I know, right?” Jess slips her arm through his and steers him through the crowd. “ It smells way to good in here. I say we get second breakfast on the way out and head home for a nap.”
Dean laughs and hugs her back firmly, before releasing the wild child back on her feet onto the floor. “ G’night, little lady.” He holds his closed hand out for their customary fist bump, receives an enthusiastic one complete with explosion noise, and watches her sprint back toward her bedroom. It’s another five minutes before Cas reappears, dopey smile on his handsome face. Dean scoots the baby monitor to the middle of the coffee table, volume on high so it picks up the rustle of bedclothes and sleepy sighs. Cas settles into the opposite corner of the couch, visibly relaxing into the overstuffed cushions. Dean smiles at the sight and hits play on the remote, letting Keanu and Patrick give them both a brief escape from reality.
“ Such a gentleman, Dean.” Jess laughs.
“ Bitch.” Dean aims for the younger man’s gut. Sam flinches, of course, and retaliates with a slap that just barely grazes Dean’s arm as he jumps out of reach and jogs around the Impala toward the driver side.
Sam shoves past Dean and strides across the drive, hand already sticking out, broad smile beaming at the little family group. “ It’s been awhile. How are all of you?”
Dean’s definitely not thinking about a woman coming by to have dinner with Cas. Someone familiar enough the kids call her Aunt. Then Dean imagines them calling him Uncle and inwardly shudders in dismay. Way too creepy. Not thinking about it, anyway. Dean shakes himself back to the real world and offers a compromise for their relatively good behavior post-denial. “ You wanna drive to your house?”
Dean smirks back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“ So, not a distraction. Which actually makes it worse.”
Gabriel snorts and goes back to his bacon. “ Really starting to like you, despite my better judgment.”
Which means deciding who he’d rather hear
Castiel can’t help but chuckle at his new friend’s offer, along with his self-deprecating admission. But still, Dean’s given it so genuinely and, outside of the authorities and his lawyers, Castiel hasn’t spoken to anyone other than Gabriel and Meg. And always about the facts of his situation. Never how it’s affected his life. Never about him.  Because he doesn’t want his brother and oldest friend to worry, doesn’t want to burden them. “ Thank you, Dean, truly, but…” He gives a similar shrug and holds the beer bottle against his middle, the condensation seeping cool through his shirt.  “ Mostly, I’m just tired of being afraid. In the beginning, right after… I think I was still mostly in shock. It was easy to mumble,
“ Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.” His head is going to fall off if he nods any harder. He stands back and lifts an arm, motioning for the others to go ahead. Cain senses his wrong footedness and takes the lead, conversing easily with Claire as she and Jess follow Cain up, followed by Sam, laughing at the whole procession.
the wheels turning behind those big baby blues, the kid debating starting another hissy or cutting his losses. It reminds Dean so very very much of Sam when he was young.
Dean squirms in his seat again, even more uncomfortable under Cain’s scrutiny. And the unintended reminder of the latest almost-kiss with Cas. “ So what do you suggest? A big grand gesture? Stand outside his window at the crack of dawn, blaring Peter Gabriel on my boombox?”
Dean’s focus snaps to the baby monitor on the coffee table. Cas is already swearing under his breath, flinching as he bodily rolls Dean off his lap and sets him on the next couch cushion.
(Robert Munsch, and after refamiliarizing himself with it Castiel had to excuse himself for a break to get his emotions under control) and what juvenile fiction novels are appropriate for a second grader reading at an eighth grade level (that had entailed a hasty Google search and some frustrating compromises). Rowena MaCleod is Head Children’s Librarian, but she’s been traveling more and more since Castiel’s hiring and was delighted to suggest Castiel to cover for her absences and assist the recently graduated Children’s Librarian, Garth Fitzgerald IV.
Sam’s grin grows. “ He has a poster sized framed copy of it right behind his desk, where the poker dogs used to be.”
Sam dutifully laughs. “ Those are for you and you know it.” There’s a pause, just bursting with unspoken apologies. Sam goes the reasonable route instead. “ We can still meet up each day, hang out on the lake, and hit up Ellen’s… I just don’t want Jess to have to deal with it, you know?”
“ No more emails.”
“ I did. Get bored, I mean.” She uncrosses her legs and stretches them out, crossing them at the ankles of her very expensive boots. “ Technically, I wasn’t supposed to approach you first, but then I saw you leaving with the kids that night and thought,
As he learned from the previous year, November in middle Tennessee is cold and rainy. Not his favorite weather, but preferable to the early snows he’s encountered further north. Perfect weather for staying inside Gabriel’s luxury loft apartment in downtown Nashville, Wednesday night through Saturday morning. The children delight in sleeping in the guest bedroom decorated in gaudy nineties chic, Castiel allows himself to get tipsy enough with Gabriel’s top shelf Amaretto to fall asleep peacefully on the overstuffed sectional in the living room (much more Crate & Barrel).
“ Can I have a lab for Christmas? Just a small one?” Claire questions as Castiel puts the book back into the basket next to the couch.
“ You never said anything.” Dean is flabbergasted. Because he does remember that kiss, but it’s warped by copious amounts of fireball whiskey and wishful thinking brought on by a rough semester of nursing school and a lonely Thanksgiving holiday after. And in the light of a horrible hangover the following morning, Dean had convinced himself that he’d dreamed it up out of desperation.
“ Seriously don’t want to know.” Once he tosses the tissue into the trash can Dean finds his arms full of Jack. “ Whoa there, buddy!” He catches the toddler fully, pulling him from Cas’ hold to have a more secure embrace.
Fate suddenly seems to be against them now. Bitch.
Just thinking about it now gets a tingle in the back of Dean’s throat and he swallows it down with another hefty bite of pizza. He’s ready to stop thinking for the night, but his brother has other plans.
Dean’s not giving in though. He gives the boy a serious look, glancing at Claire to include her. “ Yes, I’ve got boring grown-up stuff to do. And you,” he pokes Jack’s sneaker. “ Gotta stay here and play with Claire and Daddy, okay?”
“ I see how it is,” Dean complains, smile stretched wide across his flushed face. “ Left for a younger man. Ain’t that a shame?”
As expected, the moment they enter the room Jack is attempting to drag Claire toward the front where Rowena is sitting on a small stool with her books and props around her. Castiel picks the boy up, returns Rowena’s cheeky wave, and finds a spot on the floor near the back wall, promising Jack a personal meeting after the storytime. He carefully settles on the floor, his back against a row of cabinets (careful his wings aren’t bent awkwardly), Jack standing up beside him to keep his eye on Rowena. The goggles are now hanging out the top of his pumpkin.
“ Oh my god.” Dean can barely even imagine it, then it sinks in that, “ Wait. Cas isn’t Jack’s biological father?”
Charlie pulls up Outlook and lets Castiel sign into his account. He opens the folder of menacing emails and moves away for Charlie to do her thing. He speaks quietly as she opens several emails and scans their contents. “ I didn’t think much of them at first, but they kept arriving even after I blocked the address. Then they came more often and then they were more specific to me. And today…” He reaches over to tap the screen over the most recent email.
from.
“ You are correct.” Castiel bobs his head absently, eyes glued to his computer screen. He shouldn’t be doing this, actually. Searching for jobs on his day off when he should be spending time with his children. But it’s a habit Castiel has gotten into, especially in his darker moments. He likes working at the library, he does, but he misses the university, the research projects, the conferences. A public library had been a sort of retirement plan for him when he’d first started his career and now it’s come much too soon under the worst circumstances and Castiel can’t help but want a way out.
“ Happy New Year!”
“ Please, do.” Benjamina grins, nudging her shoulder against the red head’s to get her attention.
With the quiet music and smells of cooking and soft conversation… Castiel feels very content in this moment. Not just content, but something else, as well. Something Castiel can’t quite pin down, a silky soft thread too interwoven in the tapestry of the moment for him to pull it free for study. So he busies himself making a clumsy cornhusk doll for Jack, his thoughts lazily tipping between his son’s blatant fascination for the handicraft and his daughter’s groans at his friend’s awful jokes.
He throws his pull-up in the trash can.
“ Yeah, sure!” She smiles brightly and hops up, looking back at her current interest. “ Remind me to show you the website. It’s ah-fracking-mazing!” She giggles, backing up and bumping into her chair, nearly tripping into Castiel. Something about the awkwardness reminds Castiel of Dean and his smile morphs into something a bit more genuine as Charlie laughs and stumbles her way past Castiel and into the workroom. Several of the usual patrons have been watching, most with varying degrees of amusement in their expressions. Except Frank. Frank is never amused.
“ As soon as the paperwork gets back.” Jess answers after a big swallow of food. There’s a smidge of jelly on her chin that Sam swipes off with his thumb. “ We’re both cleared and the pediatrician’s finished up Alex’s paperwork, but Dr. Ramdeen had an emergency call early this morning, so she hasn’t gotten around to my papers yet.” She slurps half her coffee up.
And then Cas ends the kiss to look down and immediately groans, throaty and utterly wrecked. “
“ What a douche.”
Pamela turns her beaming smile back onto Dean, her sightless eyes nailing his gaze. “ See. So what about you?”
More laughter, more kisses. Castiel unashamedly snuggles closer, pushing his face into Dean’s ruffled hair, enjoying the younger man nosing against his throat.
Castiel’s back and arms are straining. Dean is not a small man and it’s been a while since Castiel has done this with anyone of any size. But he holds Dean there, at his mercy. Watching those long lashes flutter, the color rise under the freckles, the quick little pants that escape those plush lips that Castiel just wants to taste again so badly and he leans in just an inch and lifts up Dean another inch in his arms and--
“ And yet, still very much not a Hufflepuff,” Aaron mumbles.
“ Do not ask Dean for a puppy, Claire. Or you, Jack.”
“ Spanish Inquisition much?” Gabriel raises both brows, mildly reprimanding.
Castiel feels. He
“ That was
It can’t be anyone who wishes him well.
“ Yeah, cool.” Dean is still looking at him, as though waiting for an opening to say something. But then he looks down and actually registers what’s in his hand and his entire face lights up, childlike in its uncomplicated joy. “ Oh! I love this kind!”
“ End of discussion,” Castiel huffs.
Castiel nods again, but makes no move toward the open laptop on the other end of the table. He can’t tear his eyes away from the package on the table. It’s not as though it’s a severed head or any graphically violent threat. Cain would have immediately called the police if it had been any such thing. But the very fact that the older man had deemed it necessary to hide it from the children frightens him at a primal level. He can’t make himself reach for it.
“ I’ve got it, cher.”
“ Don’t worry ‘bout it, bitch.”
And when you wear that one pair of jeans with the rip under the right butt cheek.
Charlie’s quiet voice brings him out of his thoughts.“ She’s smart. This is the only public pic of them together on her social media, and while it’s definitely friendly, it’s not necessarily romantic. But I bet she’s got a private album…” Charlie turns back to her laptop, brings up Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter and a few other platforms that Castiel isn’t familiar with. “ Instagram first. Show me your secrets.”
Dean is standing there with an uneaten cookie in hand. Still confused. “ Cas, really man, you don’t have to--”
Sam punches him lightly on the shoulder. “ Jerk.”
. Dean.”
“ Yes, I did.”  Castiel answers first.
“ I know. It’s okay.” And it is, because Dean totally understands where Sam is coming from. They’ve been hiding their crappy homelife for so long it’s just become second nature. No point in dragging anyone else into their family mess, after all. “ Call me when your plane lands, okay?”
Dean inhales, slow and deep. Breathes it out the same as he eases back, hands trailing along Cas’ arms until they fall from his shoulders and their fingers are intertwined, resting on Dean’s thighs. Okay. This is happening and he can do this and this will be fine. It’s fine. “ So, it’s my birthday.”
Dean laughs, though it’s a bit strained. “  Manly musk and hand sanitizer?”
Dean still seems uncomfortable with Castiel on the floor, the man shuffling foot to foot with drink in hand, before finally huffing and plopping down beside Castiel. “ Well, I can’t let you be the only grown-up on the floor.”
Castiel sighs again. He should have told Dean first, before making this call. He doesn’t bother tilting his mouth away from the phone as he speaks to the man now facing him. “ I’m sorry, Dean, but Meg is sick so I can’t go tonight.”
“ Yiss, Dat Din’s buddy.” Jack nods his head slowly, then drops onto his bottom, wiggling until he’s touching Dean’s thigh. Dean reaches over and side hugs the little boy who is still staring at the baby with mixed emotions.
Blue eyes and flames. Flames, flames, fire…
Pamela points her spoon at him with eerily accurate aim, milky white eyes flickering over his face in a very convincing mimicry of sight. “ You’ve got that glow about ya and you ain’t even said his name yet.”
Dean snaps out of his daze and literally hops in place. “ Oh, yeah! Let’s get into the A/C.” He waits until Castiel picks up Jack to walk up the steps before falling into pace behind him. Not to check out Castiel’s ass in the threadbare pajama pants, no. Absolutely not. But he does notice how nice it is. And his thighs. Just a passing glance, nothing more. So unprofessional.
She blows a kiss through the windshield before pulling off and barreling dangerously down the drive.
“ Daddy’s willy ode.” Jack nods his head sagely. “ Wite Santa Taws.”
“ And before you say anything, I split a four-pack of those
“ Deal,” Claire agrees after a moment’s thought. She dumps the leftover candy back into her pumpkin and slaps her hand against Dean’s raised palm.
They pass Garth just around the corner, handing out candy to a small group of costumed children. The young man is wearing a variety of shades of brown and gray with dog ear headband, paw mitts, and a painted nose. And a brown sock tail attached to the back of his jeans. He smiles at Cas over the children’s head. “ Hey, guys!”
more than neighbors, exchanging tense greetings at the mailbox as you once so aptly put it.”
This portrayal of Ruby has nothing to do with Gen Padalecki, I just like her maiden name. Gen is an awesome woman <3
There’s a knock on the door and Jess calls out permission. A nurse enters the room with a wheelchair. He’s nearly as tall as Dean, twice his width and breadth, and looks like he could bench press Baby without breaking a sweat.  “ Hospital Uber for Moore-Winchester, party of two.”
He makes an actual choked sound in the back of his throat, loud enough for Aaron to look up in concern. “ You okay? Go down the wrong pipe?”
also wearing a party hat
“ The Big Four-Oh.”
He’s breathing hard, blood rushing in his ears, but he can still make out Cas’ small moans, low and breathy. They shoot straight to his dick, but Dean ignores the blooming arousal in favor of breathing in the scent surrounding him; spicy deodorant, fresh laundry detergent, artificial tropical shampoo. The afghan smells like the Novak-Kline household; cooking and Febreeze.
in the dark, eating way too many bags of Doritos. Alone with his thoughts that aren’t exactly all rainbows and puppies at the moment.
“ I want to avoid exactly what you’ve already mentioned.” He sighs, scrubbing a hand through his hair and over ihs face. “ Maybe not exactly that, I don’t think sex has any part to play in this, but… Meg, he has a tattoo of a handprint on his arm, where it bruised when I grabbed him. His brother says it’s from his guardian angel.” Despite the mild panic, the thought also sparks a tiny bloom of warmth in his chest. Because he is a horrible human being.
There’s another heavy pause and Castiel is about to jump in again, but Dean beats him to it. After a slightly shaky exhale, Dean nods and playfully tugs one of her curls. “ Almost as much as we both love you and Jack.”
again. Castiel and the children play around their own house for the rest of the day, happy to be lazy until tomorrow’s Friendsgiving with Dean and Cain.
“ Yeah, Cas. That’s cool.” Dean likes the blush on the other man’s cheeks. Is it from embarrassment over the socks? Or because Dean is shirtless? Well, there’s a quick way to find out. “ I usually don’t sleep in a shirt, well, I’m usually just in boxers honestly because I overheat. But I can…” He lets it trail off and raises the t-shirt in hand for a yay or nay.
“ Very true.” Cas responds as he enters the room with Jack hefted in his arms. “ Tears are nothing to be ashamed of, no matter our age or gender.” He grabs the box of tissues from the end table and hands it over to Dean. “ I told you so.”
When the car passes by in the opposite lane, he glances out his window, trying to see the driver. But the windows are too darkly tinted, the headlights too bright. Castiel barely makes out a person shaped blob and that’s about it before he directs his eyes forward again. There’s just something off… Instead of turning into the drive, Castiel slows down enough to get a look at the gates as he drives by.
Between one breath and the next, Dean gets out, “ Happy New Year, Cas,” before plunging back in.
“ Don’t get your panties in a bunch, handsome. I’ve done my job.” Ruby swings her legs out then firmly plants her boots on the floor and stands. She makes small adjustments to her clothes, checks her phone, casual. As though ending a meet-up with a friend. “ I am gonna miss this place. Much quieter than the Nashville branches. And that Aaron guy is kinda cute.”
It’s moments like this, in the quiet dark, staring down at Jack’s long lashes shadowing over chubby cheeks and the dark golden wave flopped back from his forehead, the gentle rise and fall of his little chest as he breathes evenly… Sometimes the horrors of his past and the great weight of his new responsibilities come crashing down on Castiel and he has to swallow back the tears before Claire catches him out.
“ You want to show me how to set the table, big man?”
“ I get it. Believe me, I don’t want that either.” Dean chuckles softly, sliding his hands down Cas’ sweatshirt until he finds the bottom hem and ducks underneath to stroke over smooth heated skin. “ Can we-ah, that’s good- shirts off? “ He catches the split second flash of
“ Explain.”
Very sweet. Nothing at all like you. ;)
“ Thank you, Dean. We appreciate the kindness.” Castiel braces Jack with his forearm, hand on his knee, then holds out his free hand for another shake that he is certainly not looking forward to in any inappropriate way.
“ No! No, not at all!” Dean denies in equal intensity.
“ You should visit the farm and take some things back for your sister-in-law.” Cain finishes off his coffee.
It’s been frustrating, but nostalgic. Like teenagers trying not to get caught by their nosy parents. And Dean will readily admit that not only does he like the anticipation, but he also greatly enjoys just being in Cas’ presence, no matter what they’re doing. When he ambles back to his own apartment each night he feels emotionally satisfied, if not physically (and that’s easily remedied on a nearly twice daily basis, christ he is too old to be blowing his wad this much).
Dean jumps, startled by the voice so close to his ear.  He’s standing in the hallway, just outside the bathroom door, Cas right next to him. Shit, he’d gotten so caught up in his head he hadn’t even heard Cas creep up on him.
Claire pokes her finger into Alex’s tight grasp. “ And me and Jack, right?”
As soon as Dr. Winchester- no, Dean the Nurse Practitioner- leaves the exam room, Castiel pops up from his seat and begins pacing the tiny space, rocking Jack in small soothing motions. To comfort Jack, but also to get his own thoughts and emotions back under control.
Dean shakes his head, then raises Alex’s fist to wave at Jack. “ No, he’s not my baby. He’s Dr. Jess’ and Mr. Sam’s. But that makes him my nephew and my little buddy. Like you. You’re my little buddy, right? ”
But Sam waves it off. “ My job, remember?”
“ Alright, last stop. Everybody off!” He chuckles and puts Baby into
“ Very convincing.” Castiel grins. “ We’ll be back after storytime.” He escorts Claire and Jack through the little clumps of kids and parents until they reach the open doors of the story room near the back of the children’s area. He pauses a moment outside, scanning the interior for an empty space and appreciating the spooky decor within. The entire room is draped in dark cloth and fake spider webs, artfully arranged skulls and potion ingredients littering the counters. Castiel recognizes a fair amount of it from the Harry Potter party held in the summer and admires Rowena’s ability to recycle their limited supplies.
“ Dean?”
Dean waits until he’s alone in the den before dropping back to the couch and picking up the remotes. He begins clicking through Cas’ Netflix account as he listens to the quiet sounds of domestic life from the hallway.
Castiel can hear when Dean’s breath catches in his throat, the exact moment he finishes unbuttoning the fly and blows hot air over the panel of pink lace exposed in the open vee. The thick flesh underneath twitches and Castiel catches his own breath at the sight. Dean’s cock is clearly outlined under the thin fabric, a hard line running diagonally toward the right hip. The lace has an intricate floral design in a tight pattern; barest hints of skin showing through the tiny holes. And Dean is already about to come out of them, the head of his cock creating a gap at the waistband.
“ Very accurate.” Castiel reaches for the pan and welcomes Cain into his home, squashing the moment of panic he feels at having left the door wide open. He’s safe. They’re all safe here. There’s a moment of shuffling to find everything a place to rest, then Castiel is calling out, “ Take your prey and show him the early Christmas present Uncle Balthazaar sent.”
, a yoga series, and a mental health workshop led by his longtime friend, Meg Masters, a psych nurse at one of the major hospitals in Nashville. That research can also be done at the desk as long it remains predictably slow as Saturdays often are. Weekend patrons are more often there to either pick up their interlibrary loan holds or to set themselves up at one of the study tables for intense research.
On his right, Pamela elbows his elbow and Dean looks up with the full spoon still in his mouth, brows raised in question. “ Wha?”
“ I never found it particularly emotional either, until…” Cas glances at the kids’ bowed heads and then lets his gaze fall and remain on Dean. “ Well, until I was given a different perspective on life.” He smiles now, soft and self deprecating. “ A very parental perspective.”
Dean really doesn’t want to end this right now. He doesn’t want to lose Cas’ warmth and watch him go back to his house while he goes back to his apartment and they both lie awake just thinking about each other (he hopes Cas will think about him) until tomorrow morning. But it’s freezing out here and it’s late and Cas can’t leave the kids.
“ Daisies. Got it.” Dean has a shy smile as he ducks his head. The blush rising to his face is beautiful.
Alexander Dean Winchester is born quarter past five in the morning, November 1st.  Dean literally sobs in Sam’s arms when Jess reveals the infant’s name. And for once he doesn’t deny it afterward.
because the children had begged to return to the Christmas wonderland of
“ It’s a poker game, Gabriel. Children are not going to be welcome no matter how delightful they are.”
Cas’ entire aura softens, the smile on his face practically angelic. The glow of the porch light behind him adding to the effect by providing a painfully bright halo above his head. “ Thank you, Dean. You, too. I mean, if you ever need anything. I’m here.”
Cas is panting beneath him, quick little breaths in and out of his parted lips. Dean tilts his head to place a kiss on those dry lips. “ This okay?” He gives the cock in his hand one long slow stroke up, then back down.
seen you this hung up on someone before.”
Cain, obviously sensing his discomfort, takes pity on Castiel and removes the bag from the box and pulls the toy from its cardboard depths. It’s not a pleasant looking stuffed animal, though Castiel has enough of his wits to realize he might be prejudiced by the situation. Cain turns it over in his hands, facing it away from Castiel, and squeezes its middle.
“ Heck no, ow!” Dean yelps as his ankle is kicked under the table. He frowns at Cas, but the man’s poker face is impenetrable.
“ No problem.” Dean squeezes him again, then loosens his embrace to pull back just enough for them to make proper eye contact. Still close enough to feel warmth breath washing over his chin.  “ I’ve got the morning off. I can crash on the couch tonight.”
and sighs heavily. Because now he has to call Gabriel and let him know that he’ll be wide open for Kali’s cold shoulder.
and all without the help of booze. you n gabe gonna get lit after the kiddos go to bed?
Alex's first sleepover.
“ But, won’t you be lonely?” Claire isn’t satisfied by Dean’s casual replies. Castiel can understand her limited point of view; holidays happen on the calendar date and one spends them with family. Or friends, as a last resort. One simply does not spend Christmas by oneself. It’s like Halloween with no candy. Or a birthday with no cake.
“ Pop, Daddy!”
“ Hmm.”
s, two times, really quiet, and turns the water off. There’s a lot of bubbles on his hands and he can’t reach the towel Daddy uses to dry his hands and if he wipes them on his pajamas his pajamas will be wet and icky and Jack doesn’t want that so he looks around for something fluffy to dry his hands on.
“ Can I see Alex again?” Claire makes it all of five minutes before asking Dean to share more photos of his nephew.
Claire’s head shoots up, indignant look blazing across her face. “ I’m not a thief, Dad! I’m a knight! Knights don’t sneak!”
Dean can so fucking relate to that. He pulls both hands up to frame Cas’ face, tilting it up to meet his own in a deep, brain halting kiss. When they break for air, Dean sucks gently on Cas’ lower lip between exhales. The heat is building again in his gut, between his legs. Dean can feel his chubby turning into a full fledged hard-on, rubbing against the soft satiny--
Selfish and stupid and irresponsible and-- “ Stay a little longer? Please?” Castiel hears his own rough whisper in reply. He shouldn’t ask this of Dean, but Dean offered and Castiel is so Goddamn tired. And afraid. “ Until the movie is over?”
They bid farewell to Charlie and circle around through the periodicals and adult fiction. They skirt around Frank so as not to disturb his current mumbling rant about jack-o-lantern homicides. Jack forces a sudden and intense toddler monologue about beards onto Chuck who looks so uncomfortable under the boy’s scrutiny that Castiel takes pity on him and lures Jack away with a another library sticker.
Dean releases a shaky laugh and rubs the heels of his hands against his eyes, smearing the unfallen tears. Hiding. “ So stupid, sorry.”
The first Friday of each month is Clinic Karaoke night at the Roadhouse.
“ Ain’t nothing to tell.”
Castiel refuses to look where Meg is wanting, instead waving her off. “ It’s complicated.”
The boy is walking as quickly as his chubby little legs will let him without actually running. Claire is right behind him, in one of Cas’ old hoodies and blue leggings. Jack decided on unzipped footie pjs over his play clothes; varying blue swirls on his pajamas, red shirt underneath. Cas is wearing his usual grey lounge pants and university sweatshirt. Dean thinks the entire group looks incredibly cozy.
Jack sits on the middle couch cushion between Cas and Dean, alternating leaning on one man’s thigh to the other’s as he expounds on the scenes of interest and melodically shouts along with the songs. Claire sits on a large floor cushion with a galaxy print, directly below Jack’s spot. Dean notices how she leans toward Cas, wrapping her arms around his lower leg, clinging to his knee. It's the only conscious behavior of anxiety that Dean’s witnessed so far, from either child; a tendency to attach themselves to the nearest adult, most often Cas.
Damn, he wasn’t watching the time. Castiel walks ahead of Claire and spots the back of Cain’s head over the cafe curtain in the back door. He’s expecting his landlord, so his appearance isn’t a complete surprise, Castiel simply let the bedtime rituals get away from him and now Cain is standing on his porch amidst the moths and June bugs swarming about the security lights. Castiel unlocks the door and opens it wide, apologies ready to spill out, except his daughter beats him to it.
Cas moves through the living room and into the kitchen, coming back to the den with two of his fancy beers. Dean isn’t complaining. He accepts one and leans in for a kiss the second Cas sits down beside him. Cas eagerly returns it,  throwing his arm over Dean’s shoulders and keeping him close as the movie starts.
“ Yes, you did. Which was embarrassing for your mother and me, but also highly amusing.” Castiel gets up from the chair, intent on parenting and enjoying it for another couple hours before bedtime. “ Let’s learn about sharks and maybe penguins before Jack’s bedtime.”
The friendly kinda fuzzy. Not romantical in any way. Nope.
Dean recognizes the self-recrimination and rising panic and quickly heads it off with an understanding smile. “ You brought him in as soon as you realized something was off and that’s what we always want to see.” He’s glad to see Castiel relax a bit across from him, slumping in the hard seat. Jack closes his eyes and rubs his face against his father’s blue tie, which is twisted backwards against the white dress shirt. The long sleeves are unbuttoned and rolled up to his elbows, exposing strong looking lean forearms. Castiel definitely has the whole sexy disheveled daddy thing going on.
As always, all the thank yous to everyone who reads, kudos, or comments!!!!!
And that makes even more sense to Castiel; Dean doing it in his brother’s place. Castiel tries to imagine Dean without the well trimmed beard. Naked jawline sharp and smooth. Maybe just a hint of scruff. He bites the inside of his cheek to distract himself. “ What can we help you with, Dean?”
Sam obviously chooses to ignore the old bit of logic. “I was thinking Jess and I could stay in a motel.”
Until Dean, sweet gorgeous Dean, had stabbed him with a popsicle. Castiel hadn’t been able to get the NP off his mind since meeting him, and getting to know him better as a neighbor and friend simply deepened the
“ No. And even if we did, I don’t think a stalking case like this is going to do much more than delay Nicholas’ trial as his lawyers scramble to find a way to turn it back on me.” Castiel rubs his thumb under his chin, feeling the light scratch of stubble. It’s an oddly comforting texture.“ Besides, like you said before, this was too easy. She could have sent those emails from anywhere; her home, the office, a Starbucks across the state. But she made sure she was here and within sight each time. Because she wanted to be caught. Because Nicholas wants me to know that he has people everywhere. That I can’t escape him. “ He pauses, weighing his options very carefully. Castiel steels himself and comes to a decision. “ Is she still in the building?”
Jack is pulling hard on the end of his ear of corn, the silk coming out in little fistfuls. He stares at the strands in his fingers before watching them fall to the floor, then repeating the entire process. Shockingly, he doesn’t try to eat them. Castiel smiles and plucks an ear from the bowl, sliding his fingernail under the green edge and digging down until he can neatly rip the tough husk apart. The noise captures Jack’s attention and the round blue eyes are rapt, following every movement of Castiel’s hands, his own corn forgotten in his lap.
Jack rubs his hands together and sings his
Claire asks questions, often the same ones she has before. Jack points, without touching, and sometimes repeats Claire’s questions. They slowly advance from Alex’s time in the hospital to his first day at home, then random moments over the past few weeks. Claire recognizes Jess’ parents and reminds Jack who they are when their images pop up. Jack squeals, “ Dahttah Jiss!,” whenever Jess is shown and insists on calling Alex, “ da baby.”
The girl handles it much better than Dean would have expected. Claire frowns at the picture but her voice is fairly even when she says, “ That’s Jack’s father. But he isn’t nice.” And she leaves it at that.
That quickly pops Castiel’s happy bubble. He takes his phone from Dean as he rolls away, onto his back, and opens the text. Except there’s no message, just a video.  Frowning, Castiel hopes his sliver of battery life is enough and hits
“ Jesus Christ.” Dean mutters, mouth of the beer bottle balancing on his lower lip a moment before he tilts it back to take a swig. Honestly, his first instinct is to run next door and scoop the entire little family into a massive hug. His papa bear instincts have always been strong, but hearing what not only the kids, but Cas, as well, have suffered through for so long… Dean has to forcefully keep his ass in his chair. Pity is not something they need. Overwrought displays of alpha male (his secondary instinct) are not needed. He swallows another gulp and makes the decision to just be the best damn neighbor he can be. “ Well, I guess it’s a good thing I’m here to keep an eye on them.”
“ Sure, I got some new pics over Thanksgiving.” Dean reaches toward his back pocket before he remembers that he gave the phone to Cas earlier. “ Hold up. Left it in the kitchen.” His crotch is still a bit tender, but he doesn’t even flinch when he stands from the couch and enters the kitchen in search of his phone. There’s a sudden silence between Castiel and Cain and Dean can’t help but think he just walked in on them talking about him. He shrugs off the unease and returns Cas’ bright smile with his own when the older man hands over his phone.
It’s a knowing look and Castiel clears his throat and makes his way back into the kitchen before his face literally burns off with embarrassment. “ Rest, Dean. I’ll get the kitchen set up.”
