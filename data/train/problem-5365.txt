“I don’t think that’s something Cas would do.” He said. “Besides, he’s only ever been interested in—“
When Cas came back from the Empty, Dean was about two seconds away from punching him in the goddamn face. The bastard went and fucking died
I thought if I died, I’d never have to see your heartbreak or hear your rejection like I’m going to hear now! The Empty made me watch your death over and over in more ways than there are stars in the universe but it was bearable knowing the real you was finally safe and oblivious to my feelings that I am
Either way, Dean didn’t want to overload the newly turned human with all his questions. Cas was adjusting to things like sleep and food and pissing, and Dean remembered how annoying it had been to remember to do those things after his whole demon phase. The last thing Cas needed was Dean adding his pestering questions to the mix.
“Questions cannot be inherently dodged—“
Dean smiled, but his eyes stayed closed. He swayed forward a little to press their foreheads together. He mindlessly stroked under Cas’ eye with his thumb.
To both of their surprise, Cas was already there. He jolted up from where he had been sitting, hunched over something he was writing. Dean was too tired to take note of how hastily Cas closed the cover of his notepad and tucked it out of sight.
He could only assume he was trying to avoid him.
“Jack!” Cas breathed. “Can you…Jack, can you heal him?”
In a sickening slice, the vamp’s head was suddenly gone and the pressure against the blade vanished.
He narrowed his eyes suspiciously at her, although there wasn’t any heat behind it. Eileen just wiggled her eyebrows and her grin widen.
So Cas wasn’t fucking the waitress. He didn’t even like women that way. He liked
Dean looked back on the weeks between Cas dying and Jack finally getting his new power reigned in to rescue him.
“Uh, lemme try the cinnamon. One scoop.”
Dean still jumped despite the warning.
He scolded internally.
It should have been a good time for Dean to think through that pestering
Dean didn’t realize he had leapt from the table until he was barreling down the hallway with batshit purpose. Cas’ room was empty. He bolted for the garage. The truck was gone. Cas had already left, probably to avoid Dean’s pestering.
“Oh.” Jack beamed. “I like it.”
He didn’t even notice Sam and Cas were waiting impatiently at the door for him until they were both bellowing on either side of him,
“So, where you heading?”
“I beat you to the car!”
Sam didn’t even bat an eye when Jack showed him the dress, just smiled and told him he’d look great in it. Despite his little brother’s obvious easier time with this, Cas still shone his approval only to Dean.
“Good choice. Woulda guessed it for ya, too.” She smiled even wider, winking. Dean felt his eyebrows dip into a scowl. She didn’t look away from Cas, and the latter just squinted at her in confusion.
He was too late. He was in love with Cas and he was too late.
“Oh.” Cas’ eyes did that squinty thing that Dean hadn’t realized he loved until his big discovery a few weeks ago. “June. It’s nice to see you again.”
all those months ago when Dean thought he had a fever.
“The only reason I stayed awake and Sam was able to drive was ‘cause you were calm. You kept his head on right and you kept me from driftin’ off.
Dean barked a laugh at the stunned looks on Cas and Sam’s faces, already ducking behind the wheel.
Dean was in the library polishing the fancy swords sitting on the shelves when his phone started buzzing. He answered it without glancing at the ID.
“Whoa, don’t drag me into this.” Dean warned, pointing his wrench at Sam.
But then Cas, like an electric bolt up the ass, came to life under him. He twisted, smoothly, suddenly, and the solid form of Baby was pressed against Dean’s back. Cas’ hands darted to the back of his head to protect him from the impact, and Dean shivered as they trailed down his chest before wrapping around his waist.
Gritting his teeth as another aching crack of despair ran through his chest, Dean focused his attention on wiping the oil from his hands.
Dean surmised.
Their noses brushed tantalizingly.
The next thing Jack picked up was a hot pink t-shirt that read,
“Dean?”
The voice told him snidely.
“Ooh, look at this!” The kid exclaimed, pulling out a—frankly,
It sounded stupid in his head, but he
“Hello.”
He didn’t even have anything of Cas’ to carry or burn this time. Just a video of his death without sound, a faded handprint on his shoulder, and memories that just made it all the more painful. He didn’t know how to live when Cas was dead and
“We’re supposed to go grocery shopping today.” Cas reminded him. “Sam gave me the list and says, I quote,
“It would have been painful for both parties, but if it meant your life was spared…I would have.”
“Look, I’ll show you how it all works before the sun rises.” He tugged Dean along by his elbow, towards the center.
“Cas says it’s good to be polite.” Jack said seriously. “Can I choose who gets shotgun next since I won?”
“I was gonna.” He said, voicing the first of the many mental discoveries he had been making. “I was gonna tell him to put it back and get that god-awful coat instead.” He hated how close it had seemed now, how if he hadn’t caught onto the falseness of his own thoughts as he had done so many times before, what might have happened. He had damaged the kid enough—the last thing Jack deserved was getting gender baggage like Dean got from John.
Cas tasted vaguely like toothpaste and there was a lingering hint of maple syrup from the pancakes that morning. Dean could hear and feel him breathing hard through his nose, a sound he was undoubtedly matching. His hands gripped Dean’s hips and pulled them flush together from thighs to chest. Their stubbles scratched pleasantly against each other as their lips became wetter and wetter and their tongues pressed and wrapped around each other. Cas’ tongue traced his inner gums like he was exploring the cave of his mouth, leaving tingling sensation in its wake. Dean’s hands itched to get a hold of that soft messy bedhead and it took him a moment to realize that the could. He was allowed to touch Cas now.
“You want to make it a home for Jack.” He whispered, eyes darting around every inch of his face like he was trying to memorize something reverent.
Dean slid into his usual spot next to Cas like second nature. It was hardly anything new at this point. The two naturally gravitated towards each other even when they weren’t thinking about it. Cas had been a little more obvious about it when they first met, standing too close or appearing right beside Dean instead of across the room like any normal angel. Dean hadn’t realized he too was doing it until he caught himself doing things like squashing himself next to Cas in that booth with Ishim, sitting an arm’s length away around the map table despite all the room, things that Dean never really noticed doing until he did. At this point, he didn’t really have a leg to stand on telling Cas to give him some personal space.
he still needed to figure out. Not yet.
Dean stared at his cereal. Cas hadn’t seemed desperate. He was firm and steady almost the entire time Dean was dying. He made Sam’s slightly shaking fingers look like an overreaction. But his anguish and fear had been so intense that Jack heard it over the billions of other prayers in his ears?
“No.” Dean shook his head, eyes still fixed on the coat. It was embarrassing to him that Cas knew he’d dreamed long and hard about this, planned everything in his mind’s eye. “Was gonna fix up one of the rooms for Jack when he wants to stop by. Make sure the kid knows he’s got a home there. Sam’s probably gonna live with Eileen, so we could make ‘em a guest bedroom—“
He thought about how it still made his stomach turn to remember kicking Cas out of the Bunker when he first turned human. The guilt crept hot and prickly up his neck. He should have made him stay. Gave Gadreel the finger and forced him to deal with Cas staying. He could have shown him how to live as a human, shown him how to cook and take care of himself all in the safety of the place that should have been
Dean had forgiven Cas for every single betrayal and deception despite knowing if he had been anyone else, he would have stabbed them on principle.
“Bisexual.” He shrugged, his eyes closed to combat the embarrassed flush rising up his face. “Your turn.”
Cas hung his head in shame at his failure, and no, no, no, this wasn’t where Dean wanted this argument to go. He meant to tell Cas to get his dick under control, not make him feel bad for something that wasn’t his fault.
He paid the ice cream guy and sat with Jack on a street bench. It was a good day out—the sun wasn’t too hot and there was a nice breeze going around. People were milling up and down the sidewalks, spending their Saturday shopping like they had.
He was gently laid on his stomach in the infirmary, Cas sitting on front of his turned head so Dean could see him while Sam rummaged through the cabinets.
“Miss. Bouncy Feet—
“Exactly.”
like some grieving widower. Car to car since the Impala was busted, consciously moving the coat between trunks. How hadn’t he seen it earlier? Why had he let John dig so far into his own subconscious that he didn’t even realize the things he was doing?
’ anymore? Nicknames were a way he showed affection, and the last thing he wanted was weirding Cas out with them now that he had a girl. Dean decided it would only be more obvious if he stopped than if he kept going. In Cas’ mind, he didn’t know about the waitress.
Those words felt right in his head. They were Dean talking this time.
“Figure out what grub y’all want?” She asked brightly. Her voice annoyed him. Sam ordered a salad (figures) and Dean ordered the diner’s classic hamburger and cheese fries.
His feet hurt from standing when Cas finally came pulling into the garage with his rumbling truck. Dean glared at the ground as he waited for the car to shut off and Cas to get out.
They didn’t talk about it. Cas and Dean avoided each other for the next few days, both giving the other time to cool down. They hadn’t had a talk like that since they got separated in Purgatory looking for Leviathan blossoms. They probably should have talked when Cas got spat back out of the Empty’s ass, but hey, Dean was the master of avoiding chick-flick talks, and Cas had learned how to do the same from him.
“Buy them, Dean.”
Even Dean. He sure as hell wasn’t worthy of Cas’ friendship, and he hadn’t done much to try and earn it either. He was probably the least deserving.
Dean buried his face in his hands, cheeks burning with embarrassment.
“Don’t give me that bullshit, Cas—“
There were goddamn,
Dean shuddered. Should he pray to Jack and tell him to haul ass back?
“Looks good, kid.” He said gruffly. “S’that what you wanna get?”
His words shook something deep within his soul, and a shiver ran up his body. A shaky breath escaped his lips as he got lost staring into Cas’ eyes.
“Guess not.” He mumbled instead, leaning under the hood to screw the cap open on the coolant. But because Dean is a self-deprecating little shit, he didn’t believe he deserved Cas’ company without the usual impending doom looming over them. Which is what compelled him to ask,
handsome, isn’t he?” He said loudly, tugging their entwined hands up just so Dean could kiss those tanned knuckles and wink at the flustered man next to him. Cas’ face turned a whole new shade of pink. “Too bad
Cas’ kid though, and Dean knew all about the ex-angel’s disregard for human sensitivities regarding sex. He’s
John’s voice floated back into his mind, tainting the vulnerable memories with their own opinions. Dean forced it away. This wasn’t about John. This wasn’t his life, it was
“The bunker’s not far from here.” Sam’s voice sounded distant. “We gotta hurry.”
what she says they are, got it?”
Dean’s knuckles turned white.
, Dean surmised as Cas shifted his hips, dragging his thigh up against his and making him lose his train of thought all over again.
Cas was back, Sam was happy, Jack was the new God, and Dean…he had some shit to figure out.
Dean’s brain thought wildly.
“Dean! I want mint chocolate chip and pistachio!” He decided. Dean winced.
That mindset actually got him through the rest of the meal, and he was happily satisfied after about three baskets of fries that just kept coming. Cas also looked pleased, having polished off his cheeseburger and still picking up fries. He had a funny way of eating them though, as Dean noticed. Cas liked to squish out the mushy innards of the fries and eat them before popping the crispy skin into his mouth. If he hadn’t been a newly-made human, Dean would have made fun of him for it. But hey, he’s a weird dude.
“Only if you live with mine.” Cas murmured, moving his eyes down before getting stuck on his lips. A thumb grazed over them, teasing.
“Okay, well, I just got a call from a hunter in Oklahoma. A friend she knows has an antique store and just came across a cursed box.”
Dean just shrugged, the tips of his ears burning with an oncoming blush.
specifically.
“Y’know what you could do, though?” Dean said as the idea hit him. “you could spy on him for m—just to make sure he’s okay.”
“They’re just uneducated.” Jack surmised seriously. Dean winced.
He was definitely going on a date. There was no other explanation for his cryptic answers and hasty disappearance. Cas was going on a date with Miss. Bouncy Feet who called him handsome and winked at him and put an apple in his cider.
Jesus, he was so pathetically gone on the guy.
“You’re still good at what we do.” He talked over him again. “When I say we needed you in New Orleans, it’s ‘cause we needed
But that made sense, of course. Dean currently have very few thoughts that weren’t about Cas and his thigh against his. Or maybe the waitress had him on his mind too.
“Okay. I’ll try.” Then he was gone.
And not the bullet and gunpowder kind of shotgun.
“Goddamnit, it’s
“Why the hell do seed packets look like condoms?” He demanded, more embarrassed than anything else. Cas shrugged.
Cas’ furious glare faltered, a look of confusion making his eyes squint.
It seemed to take Cas a second for him to realize the waitress was talking to him. Dean saw him blink in slight surprise at the nickname before squinting at the menu again.
Silence again, more stunned than the last. Clearly, Cas had not been expecting such a determined interrogation—though that was probably Dean’s fault. He hadn’t exactly been very demanding for answers lately.
“Imma hold you to that, handsome.” The waitress—
Dean had honestly been expecting a bit more protest, but hey, the kid’s four. He sat alone in the kitchen as the seconds ticked by, getting increasingly anxious. He would be back any second now…
“What?” He blurted. “What about Meg or April or—or Daphne?”
“Why haven’t you called her?” Sam asked incredulously. “She’s cute, dude. Get to know her.”
“Garage.” Was all he shouted back, his voice rough with annoyance and work. Sam’s lumbering feet came into view a few moments later.
Dean didn’t even realize the corner he’d backed himself into until they were twenty minutes down the road. Without Sam or Jack as buffers, he was stuck alone with Cas for the entire six hour trip. And given the revelations he’d just had this morning, including the depressing fact that Cas would never like Dean the way he did, made for pretty awkward silences.
not to tell you.”
, he hadn’t—had he let that slip when he ranted?
A sick feeling was twisting Dean’s stomach, and he slunk into his room and closed the door.
“Don’t push your luck.”
“Eileen?” He asked, worry laced in every word. “Are you okay?”
How could he have been so fucking blind? It was so
“It isn’t a case, exactly.” Was how his brother started.
me so I didn’t have to face a reality in which the first person I told about my love for you
He noticed Cas’ back and shoulders had stiffened, and his eyebrows were pinched into a frown.
This was why dealing with his mental health was always a bad idea.
Before the thought could fully send Dean into a panicking rampage, the kitchen lights flickered three times. Not even a moment later, Jack reappeared right where he had left.
Dean shook his head stubbornly. He might be a nervous wreck, but that didn’t mean he wasn’t gonna press for the truth.
Sam wrinkled his nose at the nickname.
looks that happy before they die unless they’re nine kinds of crazy. And why’d you have to go dying again in the first fucking place, huh? Why can’t you just
Cas growled out viciously. “I have
. Dean needed to fix that right fucking now.
Jack looked chastised, giving him a sober look. Dean should have been suspicious about it, but right now he had to satisfy his panic.
The thoughts that had just run through his mind weren’t…
“What do you think, Dean?” Jack asked eagerly. There was a brief moment where Dean caught the look on Cas’ face. It was trepidation, wariness that he would tell Jack to put it back and voice John’s words aloud. But his face smoothed over a moment later into a passive expression. Dean tried to swallow down the shame burning the back of his throat. He should have treated Jack better. He shouldn’t have given Cas a reason to look at him like that.
They still outfitted the house with an array of telephones for different agencies, hidden weapons and crafting rooms, and they planned on visiting the Bunker to help any hunters that passed by now that Sam and Eileen opened it up as a hub. Dean knew he’d never really be out of the life, but this was a comfortable as comfortable could get for a guy like him, and it was enough.
“Too close.”
“Grab ‘em from the pantry.” Dean said gruffly.
“Holy hell, Cas.” Dean breathed. He was pretty sure he hadn’t even blinked once. “This is amazing.”
“What’s so funny? My flannels are
“Jack told me.” Dean shrugged. “It wasn’t your fault I got pushed onto a metal rod, Cas. That’s just how the ball rolls sometimes.”
They paid for their meal and left, Dean grateful for both the loss of Cas’ thigh pressed against his and that they were finally getting away from Miss Bouncy. Dean hadn’t really given her an opportunity to slip Cas her number or anything since he was the one picking up the check, and the obstruction of information was enough to appease that twisty feeling in his chest.
“Good. Quiet. It’s nice not having the girls running out the door every day on different cases.”
Dean had very few rules about a lot of things, but his golden rule was never to get involved with anyone who was spoken for. He didn’t deserve to be selfish like that. Cas didn’t deserve to have his first real relationship ruined because Dean just couldn’t help himself.
“Mornin’ sunshine.” Dean greeted Cas as he did every day. He gave Dean a small smile before beelining for the coffee.
He should probably be wondering why this touch was affecting him so much. He had known plenty of best friends who liked physical affection and touched so casually, so logically, Dean knew it wasn’t that big of a deal but—he and Cas didn’t
“See you in a few hours, Sammy.” Dean waved before ducking into Baby and starting the engine. Cas slid into the passenger seat looking smug as he always did when he won a round.
Dean should be relieved Cas wasn’t banging the waitress, but any hope or relief he felt beforehand was muddled by the sinking of his heart again. Very few men. That didn’t exactly bode well for him either. He’d known Cas for twelve years and never once had he given an indication of wanting him romantically.
everything. He complained every time Dean or Sam tried sticking him with dishes, got all sassy whenever Dean griped about him stealing his clothes (Sam’s are far too big for me, Dean), and just point-blank refused to wake up before ten without coffee in his hands.
—I don’t
The way that waitress was eyeing him, he’s probably already found it.
Reciprocation was whispered between kisses.
If the pancakes had too many chocolate chips in them, he didn’t say a goddamn thing. By the time they were done, Sam and Cas had wandered in and were sitting at the table reading or drinking coffee.
He hadn’t allowed himself the time to really think about Cas coming back from the dead again. Or getting killed again in the first place. These past few weeks, he’d just been glad everyone was alive and safe or busy having his brain melted whenever Cas did something like brush his shoulder in passing or send him a soft smile that was more in his eyes than lips.
That voice in his head offered.
“That was never a rule.” Cas replied smoothly.
“Like you said,” Dean murmured. “never the right time, world’s always ending. I—subconsciously or not—I didn’t want to start something with all that over our heads. It would’ve been too important to me. Not to mention, I thought it was
“Do you want to leave?” The question came out a lot more vulnerable than Dean had intended, but now that he was there he couldn’t stop. “Do you…d’you think you can’t leave because I don’t want you to? I-I mean, I know I told you just to stay and ‘course I’m always gonna want you around but I get it if you want to be free or whatever. Live by your own rules, I get it if that’s what you want—“
“I’ll pay for them myself.”
“Looked like she was aiming a little higher.” Sam grinned. “She was into you, man.”
Dean thought bitterly. The pancakes suddenly tasted like ash in his mouth.
nursery, Dean. I’ve been gardening.”
“Play it up to Sam and he might let you get away with it for a while.” He chuckled, nosing along Cas’ cheek and temple, eyes closed. He felt Cas’ eyelashes flutter against his skin. “Wanna hear a secret?” He whispered into his ear, nosing down under his jaw.
They caught wind of a case in New Orleans. It took five days, only three of which were actually spent in the city. Dean liked the place well enough—he’d heard Mardis Gras was like a party that never ended—but they were there at the wrong time. But the streets were still filled with jazz music and people bustling up and down the cobble streets. It was a nice place. Twenty six year old Dean would have had a great time there.
“Nothing.” Cas spat, his voice shaking with fury.
wanted to leave him again.
with Cas, letting him move him and touch him however he wanted. He had never been that way with Lisa or Cassie. He remembered them touching him somewhere and how he had flinched away as a bad memory took its place. With Cas, his touches felt safe. Healing. Comfort.
Crazy how he was apparently more scared of a gentle touch than a violent one…Jesus, how fucking traumatized was he?
Before Sam or Cas could open their mouths to protest, Dean cut them off.
“Where were you?” Dean try to sound casual, but there was a threatening edge to his voice that made Cas’ shoulders stiffen.
“Fair. I’m actually…well, I kinda broke down?”
“Well, let me know when the
Yes, good. Easiest questions first. Safest.
“How could she have an object for me if I do not know her? Did I drop something?” Cas asked, and Dean wanted to either smack his forehead on the tabletop or laugh. But he was still annoyed, so he just rolled his eyes instead. Sam laughed.
hum. “You’re doing this for the common good.”
He was
Jack snapped his eyes up to his eagerly, a hopeful smile on his face.
“—I’m free anytime, handsome.” The waitress winked, hanging Cas a slip of paper that he just blinked at.
you do not want—“
Cas tilted his head just so and a jolt of lightning raced down Dean’s spine when he felt the wet press of tongue against his bottom lip, begging for entry. He made a noise of approval in the back of his throat and that was all she wrote. Cas took complete domination over the kiss.
, should he call Cas ‘
“—and with Daphne I didn’t have much conscious choice in the matter.” Cas continued. “I’d lost my memory and wasn’t really
Dean blinked, taking in the mischievous grin on Cas’ face before he burst out laughing. He released their entwined hands to cradle the back of his angel’s neck as his laughing rolled out into the quiet morning.
He remembered Famine telling him that he wasn’t hungry for anything because he was empty inside, how he had know that hadn’t been true. He remembered being hungry, but his own belief that he could never have it had been what suppressed the urge. He had been hungry for
“I appreciate the remarkable feat of ingenuity that they are.” Cas said diplomatically. “But I merely came out here to find you.”
Utter silence answered him, but before Dean could freak himself out and wonder what the hell he did wrong, he chanced a look.
“Jack likes it, Cas.” Was Dean’s response. “Said he’d be dropping by when he could, wouldn’t want to not have what he likes here for him.”
“This will hurt.” He warned before lifting Dean right off the rebar like he weighed nothing. Dean let out a grunt of agony, squeezing his eyes shut against the wave of pain. He crumpled into Cas’ arms, feeling the blood seep into his shirt.
“I mean she likes you.” He explained. “Interested, y’know?”
Dean couldn’t help but notice that Cas was sitting unnecessarily close on the bench seat, the usual foot or so space between cut in half. His hand was resting just a few inches away from Dean’s thigh, and Cas must be like a goddamn furnace because he could
Dean begged him silently.
Dean felt that heavy coldness in his gut again.
“You seem okay.” He decided, frowning as he saw Cas’ face get even pinker. “Seriously man, is it hot in here for something?”
where he is?”
—for fuck’s sake, he
Another server—a dude this time—took their orders a few minutes later before hurrying off. Sam and Cas were talking and kept trying to pull Dean into their conversation, but his mood had soured even further than before and he merely gave grunts in response.
“That’s not fair! I’m in the bathroom!” Sam complained, voice muffled by the door. Dean just snorted in amusement as Cas, who had blatantly ignored Sam, ducked in the passenger seat. Dean, who had no idea how the war started but desperate to stay out of it, gave him a sideways smile.
Sam wasn’t with them for the food run, which spared another yelling match over shotgun. Cas was already sitting in the passenger seat, squinting at something on his phone. It was a quiet drive for once, Dean still trying to pack his mental shit away and Cas distracted by something on his phone. Every now and again, his thumbs would type rapidly like he was answering a text, and his phone would buzz quietly every now and again. Maybe he was texting Sam about the avocados? Dean was gonna buy them anyway.
“Yeah?” Jody asked, almost hopefully. Dean hastily threw up excuses.
“Why? Got something on your mind?”
Dean didn’t think his stomach could twist any further. There was a terrible hurt building inside him, echoing with a mourning of what could have been. The vulnerable feelings quickly morphed into anger, as they always did, and it must have started showing because he felt Jack’s wide eyes on him. Or maybe he could sense the turbulence going on inside him.
His near death was old news by the following morning, which was pretty much the norm for a family like them. Dean was grumpy before coffee and Sam bitched about his turkey bacon.
He also couldn’t appreciate New Orleans because everywhere he looked he saw Cas.
do you mean, your happiness? Why would you be sorry for how something that makes you happy affects me?” Dean demanded.
Not even two minutes later, Cas’ leg was back against his as he scooted further into the booth to make way for their waiter. Dean could barely notice the steaming plates of glorious greasy food because Cas’ touch had effectively short circuited his brain again. What he wouldn’t give to just put his hand on that warm thick thigh, slide it up, up,
“Shotgun.” Cas suddenly said rather loudly. Dean was confused for only a moment before realizing that Sam’s footsteps were coming down the hall.
Dean didn’t get the chance to try unboxing his recent revelations. He and Sam got landed with a hunt in Indiana, which ended up being a five day trip. Cas got a call from Claire and Kaia asking for help on a possible werewolf in Arkansas, so it was the first time Dean had been away from Cas since he came back from the Empty.
“Oh.” Cas said, tucking his phone away before Dean could catch a glimpse of his screen. “Nothing. Just…Claire. She’s, erm, helping me with emojis.”
die on me, do you understand?” Cas warned lowly, sounding pissed off and scared shitless. Now, he was clearly talking to Dean. “I won’t allow it. I’ll drag you back down from Heaven myself because I can and
if you like banging dudes, Cas—“
“Why can’t I wear this?” Jack asked sadly.
“I bought Bobby’s place. Gonna fix it up.” Dean mumbled, avoiding the piercing gaze that never left his face.
It had been a few weeks since Cas went on his secret outing, and the only reason Dean had made it this far without bursting a blood vessel was thanks to his years of experience in emotional repression. He shoved that shit down as far as he could, ignoring the
Dean felt himself immediately bristle when he realized the waitress had followed them outside. He felt a snap rising and his hand itched to grab the back of Cas’ jacket and tug him away, but he stopped himself.
Dean hadn’t been there. Michael had led him, Sam, and Jack on a wild goose chase for some nonexistent weapon that could kill God, and while they were separated, Chuck confronted him and Cas used his deal to take them both.
“What?” Dean asked, clueless.
“Oh no.” Jack brightened immediately. “No, it’s really good, Dean. I think it’s making him happy, too. It’s harmless.”
He snapped in his head.
His mind must have been playing tricks on him, because he could have sworn the shadows slowed down a little as they passed his room before speeding back up.
“Omelet’s on the counter waiting, sunshine.” Dean said without thinking.
They were going there as a kind of farewell dinner for Dean and Cas. With the combined efforts of the four of them, Eileen, Jody, Donna, the girls, and Garth and his family, building Bobby’s place back up had taken nine months. It was almost back to its original glory, the same overall structure and layout just with new furniture and freshly painted walls. The three bedrooms had been fixed up and the large attic space was fashioned into ingredient storage and a library. Dean and Cas shared the largest room with big west-facing windows that overlooked the garden and wild grass and showed out incredible sunsets. Jack had the room next to them and was already outfitted with most of his toys and belongings from the Bunker.
They arrived to the antique shop an hour late, Cas’ hair even more fucked up than usual, a shit eating grin on his face, and Dean’s cheeks pink and his clothes hilariously rumpled. The shop owner was giving them grief about their tardiness and Sam had been bombarding them with texts asking where they were, but neither of them cared.
That went ringing throughout his head. Jack had picked up a
How exactly had Cas summoned the Empty? What had he meant when Dean had gotten impaled and Cas whispered about watching him die and never imagining it being like this? Where had he been disappearing to, if not to see a lady? Why was he suddenly so obsessed with sitting shotgun when he had never been before?
“Waitress’ got a thing for you, Cas.” Sam chuckled, looking at the steak menu even though Dean knew he’s be getting a salad.
Of course, Dean never really cared who sat where. Sure, Sam had been the reigning owner of the passenger seat, but Dean never minded if Cas sat up there, although he only did it when Sam wasn’t riding with them.
“Yeah, they’ll be there for another ten minutes at least.” Dean snorted. His eyes caught a street stand a block or so down from where the Impala was. “Hey, you wanna get some ice cream?”
“Not the weapon, Jack.” Dean said gently as Jack eased back upright. “It’s a game Cas and Sam are playing.”
. Dean knew he and Sam had some codependency problems, but this was different.
“I thought it sounded quite good on toast.” Cas inputted.
“Chocolate cereals are not healthy morning meals, Dean.” Cas told him as he grabbed a box of Cookie Crunch.
“Y’okay, man? You look peaky.”
Dean was pretty proud of himself for managing to stay quiet about two hours into their drive, but when they passed the Oklahoma border and there was nothing but wide empty road, a box of mixtapes they’re already listened through once, and a foot of space between him and the angelic being he had been in love with since he stabbed him in a barn, Dean knew the moment he snapped.
Dean wanted to say.
“Mr. Health Nut’s going oily and fried?” Dean asked, surprised.
Dean huffed a laugh.
Shit, Dean carried that goddamn trenchcoat around for
. The dumbass had made some stupid deal with the Empty and used it to trap God, which (to Cas’ dumb, stupid credit) actually worked.
Sam and Cas bellowed the moment they rounded the corner and the Impala came into view.
Cas inhaled sharply before wrenching himself away, body and all. There was now a good foot between them and Dean absolutely couldn’t allow that. He never wanted Cas to give him personal space again. If he had it his way, he’d plaster himself to him for the rest of his life.
“Green is Cas’ favorite color. They
Cas squinted his eyes and tilted his head.
“Fine, it is now. Neither of us can call it without us in sight of the car. Dean too.”
It was around the four minute mark that he really started freaking himself out.
Dean thought about every time Cas died or left. How he had lost all sense of life, how he turned to anger to cope with the gaping chasm inside him. He remembered how bitter and furious he had been when Cas left after they lost Rowena and Jack, how he had battled with his own self-hating thoughts, how he had wished he had gone after Cas and begged him to stay.
“I got here first, my hand’s on the handle!”
“Well, hey there, handsome.”
“What about Sam? Or Jack? Do they know?”
Cas had told him he was helplessly drawn to Dean, and he understands the feeling. He couldn’t bear to look away, trapped admiring what had to be the most beautiful person in the world and reveling the fact that he chose to love
“Yes, it was.” The reply was wary but also edging on annoyed.
“Too much information, sheriff.” He complained, but he was smiling. Good. Jody and Donna deserved to find happiness after everything they’ve been through. That they’d found it with each other was even better. “Nah, m’happy for you, Jody. Donna too.”
Jack nodded.
stage.”You wanna stop dodging the question now?”
The giddy disbelief that had been rising in his chest popped like a balloon being shot by a machine gun. It was almost immediately replaced with a cold feeling of dread.
There were less hunts to go on now. With Rowena reigning in all the demons and Chuck no longer throwing case after case at them, hunts were few and far between. Sam had also created a huge network of hunters now that the population had grown, which just meant there were less jobs for them all.
Dean thought helplessly.
Then, like a record needle scratching, Dean suddenly jerked his head up.
“I’m sorry about them.” He murmured, stroking his thumb across Cas’ hand. “I know it doesn’t make it any better, but—“
“I hope that man gets it someday.” He decided. “It must be very confining to stay within rules like that.”
Dean’s head whipped around to stare at Jack, who was frowning down at his dress. Shit, did he even have
Cas sulked the entire drive home, squinty eyes glowering out the window and hands folded in his lap. Sam looked smug and Dean tried very hard not to think that maybe the phone number crumpled in Cas’ pocket was being saved for another time.
, Sam and I nearly got our asses handed to us by friggin’ Bridezilla!”
“Oh? Was it nice?” There was poison laced in his tone.
in loopy white print. Cas refused to let him walk around with a curse word on his clothing, but Jack seemed to like it more the color than the text.
“Cas, let’s go.” He heard himself snap, narrowing his eyes at the waitress who didn’t even glance at him. Cas, however, turned right around. The confused look on his face morphed into one of vague amusement.
Every once in awhile when his eyes drifted shut of their own accord, Cas would rap him sharply against the cheek to jolt him awake.
“Hello.”
Cas blinked.
“I agree to your terms.” Cas spoke over him. “But because this rule was created
the car, Cas.” He told him, although his lips were tugging up and there was no seriousness in his voice.
Cas pinned him with an offended look.
“Ready to go?” He asked, eyes tracing the timeless features of Cas’ face. He felt his fingers tracing patterns on his thigh. He smiled, blue eyes shining as they regarded Dean with the same adoring memorization.
“Nothing much. ‘Was gonna tune up some of the cars sitting in the garage.”
When they got back, the first thing Dean noticed was Cas’ truck. It was fucking
“I have everything I need. Jack is safe, you and Sam are alive and content, and there is not an imminent threat looming over us.”
, obviously not Dean specifically—
“Okay.” He said, his tone already at the
“June?” Cas asked, smearing maple syrup on his pancake with his spoon (because who eats pancakes with a spoon?). “I wouldn’t say we’re friends.”
Now it was Cas’ turn to look confused.
“Instead, it promised to come take me when I had a moment of true happiness. I tried figuring it out for years, Dean, and only when Chuck was coming for us did I finally understand. What I truly wanted was something I know I couldn’t have, but my happiness was just in accepting it, voicing it out loud for someone to hear, to
Jack nodded thoughtfully. He went back to working on his ice cream, careful not to get any of it on his dress.
“Morning.”
Cas glared at him.
there, without any knowledge of who’d been there before, what had happened there before?
“Cas.” He said gently, scooting a little towards him. Not too close. He wasn’t allowed. “Y’know you were the only reason I survived that, right?”
who wouldn’t want me. Didn’t think I stood a chance…or deserved it at all.”
, remember?”
Dean smiled.
“My pleasure.” She purred, and Dean felt his shoulders tighten.
—said before bouncing off. Dean kept his eyes firmly on his menu.
Cas immediately looked alarmed.
“You’re not even using money that is yours, Dean!” Cas hissed. “Why does being cheap matter?”
Now that Cas pointed them out, Dean could see slightly smaller trees strategically placed around the rooftop.
“It was a simple case. I arrived back yesterday.” Cas said, although there was something stiff in his shoulders and there was a pink tinge in his tanned cheeks that Dean blearily noticed.
He and Cas had been almost inseparable since they started their relationship. Dean would follow Cas whenever he disappeared to the roof, Cas hung out in the garage when Dean was working. When a rare case crossed their path, Cas would either go with Dean or stay with him, never skipping out on another hunt again until Dean decided there were no more hunts for him or Cas to go on. The house had occupied most of their time and Dean wanted to get used to the idea of retirement.
“Cas prayed to you?” Dean asked, surprised. Cas hadn’t mentioned. Jack nodded.
“Good morning, Dean.” He rumbled. “Sam.”
for Christ’s sake—no one deserved Cas, he was too good for everyone.
Instead, Dean plugged his headphones in and put on Jaws just so he could go brain dead for a little while. The shark had just chomped on its second victim when he heard the distant rumble of the truck in the garage, and feet walking down the hallway. Dean tensed immediately, watching the crack under his door as a pair of shadowy feet walked past.
Downstairs, Dean had recreated Bobby’s panic room and the rest of the space had been fleshed out for Cas’ gardening tools and work area. Outside, the open-air garage connected back into the house and opened to the scrapyard and wild grass fields. The wrap around porch was completed with two rocking chairs and a table between them.
“I’ll take a beer. Cheapest you got.” Dean said loudly, sitting up a little straighter to block the waitress’ view of Cas. She blinked, looking a little miffed, but jotted down his order and bounced away.
“I can?” Sam asked incredulously. Both Eileen and Dean pinned him with a look that had him clearing his throat and nodding. “I can.”
“Those might not taste great together, buddy.” He tried, but Jack was adamant.
“Oh.” Dean said dumbly. He mulled over that for about two seconds when he remembered something. “Hang on! What about those condoms I saw you hiding in your pocket? When we came back from New Orleans?”
“We said it at the same time!”
“Yes.” He grumped, like he was annoyed by his own thoughtfulness.
“It’s a saying, Jack. It means you’re always welcome to stay here.”
Cas had someone else. And Dean was not a home wrecker.
Unable to hide the smug smile, Dean dumped his cheap white eggs into the cart and toodled on. Cas’ eyes burned into his back the entire rest of the trip.
“We should—we gotta keep moving—“
for once in your goddamn ancient entity lifespan—“ He nearly bit down on his tongue to stop the words falling out of his mouth. He gripped the steering wheel even tighter, his eyes now glued to the road as if he could ignore the utter fuck up he’d just created by opening his mouth.
be good.” He insisted. It was by far the worse reason to pick ice cream flavors, but Dean just went with it. The guy scooped out the ice cream and plopped them onto a waffle cone with a smile.
“You can, Jack.” Dean said quickly. “‘Course you can. You can wear whatever you want. Some people just don’t get that.”
So this felt like uncharted territory. It felt new and unsteady, like a newborn giraffe that Dean had seen in one of Cas’ documentaries. It was wobbly and awkwardly spread its thin legs like an idiot, trying to stay balanced. It could collapse at any moment.
“Yeah.” His brother chuckled. “You should ask her out. Didn’t she give you her phone number?”
The next morning, Jack showed up for pancakes. He was wearing the dress from the thrift store and looked happy as a clam. Dean, who had always been terrible with compliments—giving and receiving—just gave Jack a rough grunt in greeting without pointing out the dress at all.
He pulled Cas in by the grip he had on his face and nearly whimpered when he finally felt chapped, warm lips against his own. His stomach tugged all the way up to his chest as he reacquainted himself with the feeling that was familiar in territory and yet thrillingly new.
Sam gestured around them as if it were obvious.
All three men looked around in surprise to see Jack standing behind them, smiling innocently as he opened the passenger door of the Impala.
Cas entire face lit up when his eyes fell on the omelet, and he happily sat down with it wearing a rather giddy smile on his face.
The confusion was only growing on the face smushed between his hands.
Cas’ hands were cupping his face, forcing Dean to tilt his head up and meet his eyes. They were shining with awe and gratitude and a softness that made him want to curl into and never leave.
“Better.” He murmured. Cas leaned forward, eyes shining. Dean mirrored him effortlessly. “I’m gonna date the shit outta you.” It was a promise. Not the most eloquent, but he meant it in his soul.
“Thank you.” Cas’ voice was quiet and low, but filled with warmth.
Dean settled on something safer.
“What’ve you been checking out babies for, Cas?”
“I noticed you liked my tomatoes when we had tacos. And you used my produce when you made omelets and blueberry pancakes.” He said, his cheeks turning redder. “I was buying more seeds.”
, did it just melt Dean like chocolate on his tongue. Sam stood up from the table with his empty plate, clapped Dean on the shoulder in silent thanks, and disappeared towards the library.
Why would he want Dean anyway? What did he have to offer that Cas couldn’t find somewhere else in a better form?
He didn’t go looking for Cas when he heard the truck pulling back into the garage. Cas didn’t either.
“I dunno. Said he had some errands to run, but he got all secretive about it.” Dean shrugged. “Don’t you just…
“I heard that man in the thrift store.”
fruit trees standing proudly together in the middle, towering over the rest and providing shade for what looked like more vulnerable seedlings.
Cas point-blanked refuse to allow anything other than free-range, organic brown eggs. The white ones were cheaper, but Cas was having none of it.
“So, Cas.” He began in a voice that promised he was starting shit. “That waitress last night. You two seem friendly.”
’ again was because their thighs were still touching and his thoughts were still scrambled. Cas seemed entirely at ease, though. He thanked the waitress politely and started eating.
Sam noticed the tension between them but besides a few exasperated sighs and pointed looks, he didn’t say anything. Dean was sure if he hadn’t started getting calls from Eileen again he would have his nose all up in their business. God bless Eileen.
Dean exhaled like he’d been holding his breath ever since they stepped out of the car.
“I, um, I can’t tell you.” Jack mumbled. “I was trying to hide, but I think he sensed my presence. He made me promise not to tell you where he was. I didn’t tell him you had asked me to find you, but I think he guessed when he caught me trying to spy on him. He made me
“He’s not…it’s not anything bad, is it?” He asked anxiously.
“Yes.” Jack murmured. Pristine white Keds stepped into Dean’s line of sight. “I’m sorry Dean, but the afterlife’s not ready for you yet.”
They hadn’t actually been to Hutch’s since the day he and Cas hashed everything out. The thought that June might be their waitress hadn’t even crossed Dean’s mind until it was too late. So naturally, his entire body bristle when he looked up and saw her standing in front of them with that stupid perky-fake smile.
He told himself sternly.
This time, Dean really did slam on the brakes. Baby shrieked in protest as they skidded onto the shoulder, tires wailing as they dragged black marks on the greying asphalt. The car came to a wobbling stop, and Dean threw the stick into park and basically yanked himself out of the car. He needed open air for this, cool wind instead of stale, cramped air of the car. Cas got out of the car too, and Dean whirled around to jab a finger in his face from across the hood.
And that was the reason for it all, wasn’t it? Somewhere in his subconscious, John’s impact on his life had been what made him blind to the truth. To what that
but didn’t allow himself to.
“How can a vegetable and a fruit not be what they say they are?” He asked genuinely. Dean snorted again.
The hunt turned out to be more of a bitch than Dean had anticipated. As it turned out, the ghost wasn’t all the happy when it realized the brothers actually knew how to kill her. Sam nearly got a chair leg through the eye and Dean was sporting a nasty bruise on his ribs after being thrown across the room. Some quick digging and they were able to dig up her bones and burn her.
“Stop it.” Dean mumbled, but his body sinking and softening under Cas’ ministrations told otherwise.
“Man, I gotta ask,” he said, disguising his nerves with a chuckle. He rubbed the back of his neck once before returning to his sweaty grip on the wheel. “what’s with you and Sam? This whole shotgun thing?” He gestured vaguely to the other side of the bench seat. Cas just looked at him, listening patiently. “You’ve never cared where you sat before.”
“You asked me where I’ve been going when I drive off. It’s the errand I didn’t want to tell you about.” Cas ducked his head and shuffled his feet shyly. “I…I have a garden on the Bunker’s rooftop. It’s partially why I couldn’t go with you on your longer hunts, the garden required my attention. And I was…worried you and Sam would not approve.”
“Is he gonna make guacamole?” Dean demanded, the delicate process of figuring out his shit completely derailed.

poking his head. He had tried ignoring it, but it seemed to find ways to pop up and bitch smack him across the face so he would deal with it anyway.
“I don’t need to use doors though.”
“You—Cas, you wouldn’t—“ He choked, tearing his eyes completely off the road to stare at him. “You wouldn’t have done that to me—tell me you wouldn’t—”
“I will. Bye!” And he was gone.
“Just partial?”
Dean let out a scoff, marching over to stick his face into the camera. Sam let out an indignant huff but angled the phone so Eileen could read his lips.
“The Bunker’s kinda the best place for it, don’t you think?”
“I wouldn’t have regret doing it.” Cas told him, eyes flashing fiercely. “My only regret would have been how my happiness and subsequent death affected you.”
In the middle of the fight with yells and blades against blades, Dean was shoved back by a burly vamp and felt his back connect to the wooden post. But, more importantly, he felt the ribbed steel stake sink into his back. He inhaled sharply at the splitting, fiery pain, but he still fought as the vampire charged for him. He struggled to keep the blade from digging into his neck—
“That’s a two way street, sweetheart.” Dean grinned, tapping the hickies littering his collarbone, hidden under his shirt. “Just markin’ what’s mine, same as you.”
Cas came wandering in just as Dean polished off his plate.
“With what money?”
“You’re…you’re leaving the Bunker?” Cas’ voice cracked in one vulnerable tremble of his voice, and Dean’s head snapped up.
to breathe. He struggled to live without Sam but struggled to find the strength to
“Not like that, Jack. He’s always happy to see you.” Dean said quickly. “He just…might be busy.”
“Jesus, is the world ending or something?” Dean asked incredulously, making Cas blink and jerk his head up. “Who’s bombarding your phone?”
“I bought Bobby’s place.” The words were whispered against his mouth, their lips brushing tantalizingly. Dean tried to keep kissing around the words only to have Cas pull his mouth out of reach again. He didn’t get far—Dean’s iron grip (god bless his foresight) kept him pressed against him. He found it easier to think straight despite the contact that should have him reeling.
“She didn’t scam us. You offered!”
“I’m good, man.”
“You okay?” He asked. Sam’s hands were trembling as they still gripped bottles of ingredients.
“You got a case?” He asked, a knee-jerk reaction.
Jack was basically bouncing off the walls as they entered, staring around happily at the racks of pre-used clothes. Sam wandered off for the men’s section, and Dean followed Cas and Jack to the young adult racks.
Sam griped the entire way to Hutch’s, whining about being squished in the back and his legs were too big to fit. It was rich, coming from the guy who had practically grown up in Baby’s backseat and was able to fall asleep there without batting an eyelash. Dean knew from
“This is great, Dean.” He grinned.
of a socket wrench.
“Where?” Jack asked, his back hunching as if to duck—an instinct that Dean knew he had instilled on him the first time he tried to shoot him. Ah, there was the guilt again.
to say it. He couldn’t bear seeing that open, cracked, stricken look on Cas’ face. It reminded him too much of when he kicked him out of the Bunker the first time he had turned human. He never wanted to see that look cross those features again. Dean
He wondered where Cas had learned the superstition. Since when had he been to a bar without Dean?
And the other thing—Cas wasn’t with them. He had chosen to stay behind. Dean couldn’t really appreciate the city life because he was too busy worrying that Cas would bring the waitress back to the Bunker knowing he and Sam would be gone for a few days. And doesn’t that just make his stomach drop?
His brain buzzed.
Suddenly, his mind supplied him with an image that turned into full-on daydreaming as he worked under Baby. He and Cas living with Bobby’s place all fixed up. They shared a king sized bed with a memory foam mattress, Jack had a room down the hall that he could pop in and out of when he wanted, and Sam and Eileen used the guest bedroom on the first floor when they visited. The kitchen smelled like coffee and bacon in the mornings and he and Cas would sit on the porch to watch the stars at night. A cozy, warm feeling spread throughout his entire body and for the first time in probably his entire life, Dean felt the secure feeling of
He nearly brained himself on the hood jerking his head up. They hadn’t spoke much beyond the usual morning greetings, but the few days that had passed had been enough for them to move past their big talk in the garage.
Dean had been so focused on Cas that he hadn’t even noticed what was going on behind him. The space was
“Shotgun.”
“I-I mean, you really think I’m gonna let some poor bastard find all those bodies Bobby buried in the scrapyard? And what if some of his weird spell shit survived the fire? Don’t want people not in the know stumbling on it.”
He snarled to himself.
Sam was gunning it like a madman despite always pestering Dean to follow the speed limit. Cas’ free hand was gently carding through Dean’s hair, something that felt very nice, he decided.
So the very first thing he did to introduce this new aspect to his personality (although Cas was already pretty give-a-shit-less anyway) was start a shotgun war with Sam.
. Seed packets? Dean had never seen seed packets once in his entire life—
“The first person to yell shotgun gets the ride home in the passenger seat.” They watched as Cas and Sam tried out-shouting each other, each sprinting for the car. Sam outstripped Cas with his lanky long legs, but the two started arguing by the locked door.
“He mentioned using them to spread on toast.”
Dean managed a weak smile.
Dean told his dick as it twitched.
“Do you want a Prius or something? It ain’t like I want that plastic piece of shit in my garage but if you want it I can learn to tolerate it—“
That should have made him feel better that Cas wasn’t doing some stupid shit behind his back like he’d done in the past, but if he wasn’t, that meant Dean’s first assumption was correct. Cas was seeing the waitress. Yes, dating was harmless and it sure as hell was probably making him happy, but it made Dean feel absolutely miserable.
in his head.
Jack beamed happily next to Dean, looking to him for approval as if to make sure he’d played the game right.
of you, every part that you don’t casually give to someone else, physically and emotionally. In these past few months alone you’ve refused to look at me some days, talk to me others, you pull away when I touch you, how else was I supposed to interpret—?”
“Yeah, kid. Two scoops.”
that made his eyes light up and a joy fill his face that made the blood staining his tan skin trivial.
Dean swallowed harshly against the acidic taste of nerves building up the back of his throat.
“Cas, it was an accident. The vamp pushed me—“
“Wanna ask you to move with me.” He mumbled softly, staring at the canvas jacket clutched in his fingers. “If…if you want.”
Cas gave him a squinty glare and allowed it. Dean made up excuses for almost everything he put in, although Cas did win some battles, mostly over the things that Dean knew he wouldn’t eat. But he drew the line as they stood in the dairy section.
Those thoughts weren’t really Dean talking. They were John’s words, words that had been beaten into his head ever since he came home from school one day with his nails colored in with a yellow highlighter. He remembered how John made him wash it off, yelled at him for nearly an hour about how boys didn’t paint their nails or wear blouses like Jordan Simmons did before shoving a gun into his hands and making him do target practice.
“So June…?” Sam prompted.
“We should have sex first.” Cas said, blunt as an old nail. Dean had to close his eyes against the upsurge of arousal that made his dick twitch almost painfully.
“Alright. When are we leaving?”
“No, thankfully she recognized the symbols before they could. But she wants us to come pick it up.”
Oh Jesus, did that make him
. Not your grace, not because we expect you to always know when we’re in danger and save us.
“Any plans for today?” Dean made himself say to fill the silence. Cas shook his head.
Dean thought immediately.
“No.” His brother whispered. “No, no, no,
“No dude, seriously these avocados are amazing.” Sam insisted. “Aren’t you gonna try them?”
Usually, places like these they would leave alone. Places with supposed famous hauntings either had passive ghosts that didn’t bother people, or weren’t haunted at all. But Sam caught wind of a brutal slaughter at the hotel, so here they were.
Dean frowned. He had grown up watching Sam insist he didn’t have a fever with pink cheeks like that. Damn Cas and his stubbornness. He was human now, fevers were something he was susceptible to. Pursing his lips, Dean leaned forward and pressed the back of his hand to Cas’ forehead.
Dean threw himself against Baby’s side and crossed his arms, now glaring at the garage entrance. He was gonna fucking
“Sure you can. It’ll stop ‘em from fighting in the parking lot again.”
Objectively. Obviously.
“I wasn’t aware of the social connotations of kissing Meg, and beyond that we were only friends. Although she did want to experiment further physically.” Cas stated dryly. “April was merely a means of release for both of us, especially with me being human and having to deal with things like lust and arousal—“
“Thanks, Jody.” He rasped, really, truly grateful.
—Dean could feel a warm bulge pressing against his leg, and the discovery that Cas was
Dean snorted and shook his head. Who was he to judge? Cas was a weird guy who ate his fries from the inside out. Of course he wanted to be fluent in the language of emojis.
The car came to a screeching stop, and Dean groaned in pain as he was tipped forward by the force.
doesn’t that just pull at his heartstrings and make him want to cry. “Haven’t you been listening to me, Dean? You’ve been so good to him, even if you’re trying to make up for your mistakes. At your core, Dean Winchester, you are
“In more ways than one, kiddo.”
He blinked, his defensive stance softening. He was always softening around Cas these days.
“Alright man, but no matter what she tells you, the eggplant and the peach are
He thought, panicking.
“Really?” Dean’s jaw went slack. “Do you…is it angel mojo?”
shaky with relief and embarrassment, but Dean huffed an awkward laugh.
By the time they slid into a leather-clad booth at Hutch’s, the weird thoughts had all but disappeared from his mind. Hutch’s reminded him of the Roadhouse, except more crowded and colorful lights. Apparently, bottomless steak fry night was a big hit in Kansas. Classic rock and country were being played on a jukebox, barely audible over the hum and chatter of patrons. The bar was full and there were occasional cheers for a football game on TV.
“It was supposed to be a surprise.” She smiled. “Anyway, can you give me a ride? The nearest shop is two hours from here.”
Cas had never said he was allowed up here. The rooftop garden might be a Cas-only space, somewhere for him that was untouched by the Winchesters. Would he be mad if Dean—
“My grace is gone, I can’t do anything for him.” Cas said, a note of panic in his voice that was almost undetectable. “We need to get him back to the bunker. A spell—“
. Nothing about what you said is something you gotta pursue, and those sound a helluva lot like needs. What are the things you
Dean found himself wondering, tuning out Sam’s grumbles from the backseat.
“You’ve always spoke easier with your actions.” Cas reminded him quietly, and Dean took it for the blanket permission that it was. He let himself go, let himself indulge in the thing he’d wanted to do for twelve years. It didn’t matter if he thought he didn’t deserve it. Dean was selfish enough to take it anyway.
“You growing food for me, Cas?” He asked, still teasing but also desperate to hear confirmation.
“In a way.” He said. “I’m aware of every living thing on Earth, and I’m aware of the moment each life is created or dies…but it’s hard to pinpoint one life. Even one as familiar as Castiel’s. When you were dying, I could sense it happening, but it was all so blurry. Cas’ prayers are what made me focus on you.”
looking at him.
“I quite enjoyed Hutch’s diner.” Cas offered thoughtfully. “They had good fries.”
But he was okay with saying goodbye this time. This time, he and Sam would be only an hour away once he and Eileen moved, Jack was going to stop by more frequently now that most of Heaven’s building was complete, and he had Cas next to him throughout it all. He was ready to take on the next portion of his life, to make the house their new home, and to spend the rest of his time on Earth with Cas. He was ready to finally sit back and grow old with the wild grass fields and the ex-angel he’d been in love with for years.
pay attention to—“ He stopped himself abruptly. “I should have noticed before.”
“What?” Cas spluttered.
“Of course, Dean.” He said, bidding the waitress goodnight and following Dean to the car. Sam was already standing at the passenger side door, and Dean caught Cas glaring at his brother as he slid into the backseat.
“In your society’s terms, I believe the closest description of me would be homosexual.” Cas said flatly, although his eyes remained fixed on Sam rather than Dean. “Although very few men have interested me romantically either.”
“Yeah, yeah, ya health nut.” Dean mumbled around a forkful of syrupy pancakes.
“We can move it.” Dean shrugged. “there’s plenty of room in the backyard. Pretty sure Bobby had some apple trees growing back there too, if you want. We…we’re gonna fix the place up first though. Your garden probably won’t be moving for a while.”
“No take backs.” He said, just in case.
“Yes, I’m fine.” Cas mumbled, fiddling with the pencil in his hands. He had nice hands.
“Hey!” Cas said sharply, lightly smacking Dean’s face. “Eyes open.”
“You can come in.” Cas smiled, warm and shy. Dean ducked his head and shoved his hands in his pockets.
“That’s…a little harsh, but basically. Doesn’t make ‘em stupid or dumber than you or me, but they just don’t get it.”
“The apple and peach work together to provide shade.” Cas explained, pointing down to the ring of seedling boxes around the base of the tree. “As the plants grow older, I move them further away from the trees so they can flourish on their own. I’ve got avocado, lemon, lime, and orange trees dispersed around to provide shade on extra hot days.”
“I’m sorry.” Jack said innocently. “I will try to warn you prior to my arrival.”
“Cas, c-can you do something? There had to be something—“
“A part of me will always miss it.” There was a sadness in Cas’ voice that had nothing to do with the garden or the Bunker, and Dean recognized it instantly. He was talking about his wings.
Cas’ hand tightened on his arm and Dean’s hazy brain decided the contact was much more interesting to focus on.
any grace, but they do seem to like me.”
As he dragged him through the maze of plants, he didn’t even falter when Dean slid his elbow out of Cas’ grip and replaced it with his hand. He just kept rambling about how well the avocados were doing and how he wanted to get a bee hive and start making honey, but he did give Dean’s hand an acknowledging squeeze.
mean?
He was too late. Cas had found someone and Dean was
Jack beamed brightly and nodded, hugging the dress to his chest. Cas’ carefully blank expression melted into a soft one, his eyes shining with gratitude and approval. Okay, that made Dean feel a little better. As Jack skipped ahead to find Sam and get his approval, he felt a hand on his shoulder, right above the faded, matching mark.
the heat radiating from his skin. It made it very hard to concentrate on the road.
Dean blanched before annoyance immediately took its place. What was Cas trying to do, make up an excuse to see his waitress?
All Dean could gather from context clues was Chuck spewing every insult he could think of, every taunt and egotistical snarl. All he could see was Cas smiling up at the father he had rebelled against, talking about
“Frankly, I never really considered the possibility that you would return my feelings.”
So neither Cas nor Sam suspected anything of him as the weeks passed. No hunts came their way, Claire and Kaia stop by to crash while they were working a case nearby, and sometimes Cas would disappear for an hour or so where Dean couldn’t find him.
Dean nearly swallowed his tongue, suddenly aware of Sam staring at him too. Cas just blinked, a relieved look smoothing out the usual scowl he wore. Dean swallowed, trying to find it within himself to say something normal.
“Ask Claire.” Was his response, because there was no fucking way he was gonna get into a conversation with Cas about dicks and butts.
As if he wouldn’t have recognized her voice. He felt his lips quirk up.
“The…waitress?”
Cas smiled.
“Thanks, kid.” He said, wiggling his fingers as the replaced blood warmed them again. “You fixed me up good.”
Before he could even come up with something to say, Cas grabbed his elbow and hauled him through the doorway onto the flat roof.
“How’s she doing?”
The mischievous grin had long since faded into a soft expression, but now the smile that took its place was soft and oh so gentle.
“Cas can run errands by himself, Dean.” Was all Sam replied with, only half listening and his eyes glued on a book.
“Where?” Came the immediate, attentive reply.
“Meet you in Baby in ten.” Dean told him and Cas ducked out again. He sighed, tucking his headphones away while mentally packing up the shit he had just learned.
. He wasn’t supposed to wear stuff like that. He would have taken the horrible plaid coat over that—
“Became a lieutenant at the police station in Sioux Falls.”
“Not helpful.” Dean snapped. He got a vague hum in response. When he turned around to pester Cas further, the bench across from him was empty, and the plate half eaten. Dean glared suspiciously at the door Cas had disappeared through. If it was just a dumb errand, why wouldn’t he tell Dean what it was?
Cas said vehemently. “I wasn’t paying attention. And I
Dean nodded.
He’d watched Chuck beat Cas senseless more times than he could count, watched the dark ooze of the Empty appear and snatch him away even more. He knew how Cas’ body had collapsed into blackness by heart, how the sludge slid over his tear-stained smile and swallowed him whole. He could count the number of wounds Chuck inflicted upon him as he brutally beat him. He only wished there was sound, or he at least knew how to read lips, anything to know what Cas had said to summon his deal.
in his head had been itching for him to discover.
“Thank you very much, Dean.” Cas murmured as he shoved a forkful into his mouth. “Adding vegetables despite your distaste for them is very thoughtful of you.”
He scooted away again, more deliberately this time. He was basically pressed against the corner between the booth and the wall, but it was distance from Cas and Dean could deal with the cramped space if only to respect boundaries. He ate awkwardly with one shoulder pinned against the wall.
. His father had done what he wanted with his life, so why should he get to control what Dean did with his?
“Then what,
for Cas to come back just to lecture him on prioritizing hunts over getting his dick wet. He and Sam could have used Cas’ help in New Orleans, but the guy was too busy with his prissy little waitress to care. Sam could have died. Dean nearly cracked his ribs again. He could appreciate choosing sex over responsibility, but this was getting ridiculous. It was like Cas was gone all the time now.
—there was definitely something to unpack
It didn’t, but he wasn’t gonna let Cas win on just that.
Dean and Sam stared at him like he had grown another head.
He nearly let out the knee-jerk
It had been hell, and Dean knew that place intimately. It was the same shit that happened when Jack was born—same words, different font. Dean fell into a self destructive mess of busted knuckles and empty bottles, with the exception of how he behaved around Sam or Jack. Instead of lashing out, Dean curled in on himself. He refused to speak to any of them except on the rescue plan. He cried until he passed out most nights, watched the security footage until his eyes hurt. Sleep or pain were the only things that kept the aching feeling in his chest at bay.
“I thought you were banging the waitress.” Dean blurted out, his voice losing the furious intensity. He felt dizzy, like he’d gotten a whiff of knock out gas that wasn’t quite enough to finish the job. Was this real? Was Cas really saying that he…he wanted Dean in every way he wanted him? Was he dreaming? Had Dean accidentally crashed the car and he was in Heaven? Or maybe Hell, and this was some sick twisted torture sequence?
Was Dean knee jerk reply, which only stunned him further. What the hell did
“I’m perfectly fine, Dean.” Cas said, focusing completely on the pencil between his nimble fingers. “I merely got a little flushed from the sun while I was in Arkansas.”
given any indication that you want me in the way I want you.” Cas seethed, blinking rapidly. “And I don’t want you as friends, Dean. I want
That was apparently the right thing to say, because Cas’ cheeks turned pink and he puffed up with pride.
with hunting. Comfortable sure as hell didn’t mean he was happy.
A week ago if Cas disappeared, Dean would’ve panicked and think he was gone fucking the waitress, but now when Cas disappeared, he knew exactly where he went.
He plastered his body against Dean, pinning him between hard muscles and metal. He thrust his tongue into his mouth and went full ham on him. Dean’s hands scrabbled to clutch the lapels of Cas’ coat, something to ground him as tongue and lips and teeth completely fucked his world up.
Cas’ forehead pressed a little harder against his.
“Yeah. I-I know, just—“
. Floated through Dean’s mind.
Cas sidled into the garage so quietly that Dean didn’t notice until he was standing right next to him.
“Perhaps we could have been friends, but I doubt she would be interested in a friendship considering the life I live.”
“Those were seed packets, Dean. Not condoms.”
“Hurry.” Was all he heard Sam say before his body was racked with pain. He was being carried between Cas and Sam, his arms slung over their shoulders and his feet dragging uselessly. The Bunker floors looked so glossy and smooth…had they always been that way?
Dean nodded vigorously before forcing himself to stand up straighter. Cas’ hands never left his face.
Jack positively beamed at that and eagerly wrapped himself into Dean’s embrace. They never really got the chance to patch up their relationship, before or after Chuck. Dean knew Jack had forgiven him, but sometimes his own self deprecation made him think there were some things left unsaid. But he was trying to be better. Hence the hug.
experience that there was more than enough space to fit two people, so Sam was just being a sore loser.
The waitress came by to get their orders. She was perky, with one of those can-do-attitude smiles that looked fake and her brown hair tied back into a ponytail that swung when she walked with a spring in the balls of her feet. The moment she laid eyes on Cas and Dean saw that spark of interest, he elected to dislike her immensely.
“I can assist in bandaging the wound—“
“I think I do.” Dean shrugged. “I wear whatever’s comfortable. Maybe that’ll change, who knows. But the point is, some folks don’t understand that things like this don’t matter. It doesn’t make you a freak, Jack.”
That made Dean frown. Content wasn’t the same as happy. Dean had been
He wasn’t sure which was worse—living under the assumption Cas had a girl, or living knowing Cas was only attracted to men and still didn’t want him. He couldn’t blame him, though. Dean wasn’t exactly the poster child for healthy, loving relationships. He had baggage, he woke up at night screaming, he got angry and lashed out. ‘Course Cas would want more for himself. Dean wanted more for him too. He was his best friend too, Cas wouldn’t want to get involved with his best friend.
“You don’t understand.” Cas whispered. “Every time I saw you—and not being able to—and the
That took a moment of Dean’s lust-addled brain to process. He blinked, confused as hell because—
you’d never want something more with me! When I realized you were my happiness and how fruitless it would be to try and tell you, I weaponized it to take Chuck
“Thanks, Dean!” Eileen beamed, and oh no did Dean recognized that twinkle of mischief in her eye. She had planned this from the start, calling Sam about her car just to get a free repair from Dean rather than a shop.
, Sam?”
“I suppose I’ve always had an opinion about it one way or another.” Cas said plainly. “There simply never was an appropriate time to compete for it. The world kept trying to end and it seemed foolish to argue over seating arrangements.”
Buzz—
He…He had made him a goddamn
“Are you alright?”
“I’m not sure.” Cas hummed, his slender fingers carefully cradling a damaged leaf. Dean stared in shock as the dry brown edges of the leaf started to bright and edge back into a vibrant green. It was slow enough that someone wouldn’t notice if they weren’t paying attention, but fast enough not to be normal. “I don’t
“Wait,” Dean croaked as something occurred to him. “I was supposed to go with you to the Bunker. When Chuck came after you.”
to know what Cas told Chuck, but the now-human wouldn’t budge. Dean had maybe pulled Cas to his feet from the floor before Sam started demanding answers.
In another life, Dean would have reached over and held it.
Dean clapped a hand on Cas’ shoulder, gave him a quick smile, and that was that.
Dean didn’t remember how they got to the car, but somewhere in a far corner of his mind, he was touched that Cas immediately bypassed the free passenger seat to sit with him instead. Dean was sprawled in the backseat with his head on Cas’ lap while a wadded up shirt was pressed to the gaping wound between his shoulder blades. The rebar hadn’t been long enough to pierce his lungs, Dean surmised sluggishly, but if he didn’t get fixed up he would just bleed to death instead.
“Do you—“ Dean nearly choked on his tongue trying to get the words out. He tried to stay casual. “so, do you…have you ever wanted more with someone? Have you, y’know…” And apparently that was all the words his throat was going to allow.
Dean couldn’t find it in himself to mind. He was getting old anyways—always surprised he even made it this far—and had stopped feeling the urge to hunt years before Chuck was even a problem.
“If you don’t put the damn eggs back, Cas, I’ll give Sam full rights to shotgun.” Dean said, triumphantly using his trump card. Cas only glared at him harder. Without breaking eye contact, he jerked open the freezer doors and put his carton of eggs back.
“Yeah, it can be sometimes.”
Jesus, they had another four hours ahead of them and all he wanted was to get as far away from Cas and this conversation as possible.
Okay. That was a…fair answer.
“I summoned the Empty to get rid of Chuck once and for all.” Cas said abruptly. Okay, looks like he was tackling the serious questions first. “It was a necessary sacrifice—“
He stared blankly at the bay doors that led outside. Cas was going to see the waitress. Get coffee or brunch. Was that why he’d only eaten half of his plate? Was he saving room? Were they going to her place after under the guise of coffee?
. He’d lost the only true friend he’d ever had, the only one who understood him to the very soul. Something about Cas was tied to Dean, and something about Dean was tied to Cas. With Sam, Dean felt like he couldn’t breathe without his little brother in his life. Without Cas, Dean couldn’t find the
Cas’ eyes opened and the smile turned rather sad.
“Is this another iteration of her
Jack pondered the question.
“I could buy it.” He hadn’t meant to say the words aloud, but there they were anyway.
Jack had somehow managed to scare Dean twice in a row with his sudden appearance and blunt question. He blinked down at the kid, who was twisting his hips back and forth subconsciously to make his skirt swish around him. It took him a moment to make up an excuse that didn’t involve spilling his crush out to his son.
“Oh. How does it work?”
Cas sat next to Dean, a totally unaffected smile on his face. Pleased as a damn pickle. He was wearing some of the clothes he had raided from Dean’s closet, a dark canvas jacket he never wore an old band t-shirt with a pair of ripped jeans that Dean hadn’t worn since his twenties. There was something about the ensemble that his brain latched onto and wouldn’t let go of, despite Dean trying to concentrate on the road. Maybe it was the way the Zeppelin logo was warped and stretched across Cas’ chest? He had always been a little wider than Dean, and the poor canvas jacket was stretched obscenely around bulging muscles that he could only assume were a byproduct of angelic grace.
Jack opened his mouth to say something when the arguing was suddenly cut off abruptly. Dean glanced up to see Sam digging into his pocket where his phone had started ringing. Immediately upon reading the ID, he could see how his brother’s posture changed. His back snapped upright and his shoulders tensed, like he was expecting bad news.
about the wound, Cas!” Dean interrupted loudly. “We
Blue eyes snapped up to stare at him in surprise.
“Where y’going?” Dean asked. “Need company?”
all his memories of Purgatory just so he didn’t have to deal with the fact that Cas didn’t want to go home with him.
“Ah.” Cas spaced out for a minute like he hadn’t thought about it. “For whatever reason, plants enjoy my presence. I’ve found that tending for them makes them grow faster and better than they would by any human’s hand.”
