It was still dark the next morning when Tony stirred awake. Steve was stretched out in bed beside him, poking at his phone briefly before letting it drop to the floor.
“It’s not just you anymore, Tony,” Steve heard Jim say. “I get it: the more you get done before he gets back, the more time you can take off. But Steve doesn’t need you to work as much as possible, Tony. He needs your support. Until you can do that yourself, I’m assigning Natasha to stay with you so he will see you’re eating and sleeping again. But if you give her trouble, so help me god, Tony—”
What was he trying to say again? Tony pulled away from Steve’s consuming kiss, panting softly against Steve’s jaw as he tried to get his thoughts straight. “Babe, I got you something…”
“Christ, look at all this,” Tony muttered to himself, staring at a great bas relief depicting Assyrian hunters firing arrows at lions. “These belong in museums.”
A tall, broad man with long blond hair opened the door, wearing a red tunic and gold-wire glasses. Tony spun around in a coughing fit, and Steve reached out to gently pat him on the back.
“Why, are his balls sagging to his knees already?” Paulette wanted to know at the same time as Erin muttered, “More like, he got what he wanted and now he’s done.”
Steve shook his head before Tony got to explaining, even waving it off. “No, no I’ll—I’ll be fine, just, just anxiety. You know. I mean, I’m better, usually, heart still acts up sometimes.”
“How should I know? Don’t stare, you’re being a creep,” Bucky snickered quietly and kept walking. There was no point waiting, Steve would catch up eventually. Sometimes he just needed a few seconds to recuperate. If you could count on anything these days, it would be gravity, and the way Steve reacted to a nice rear.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, this morning Brock Rumlow escaped from this Cryo facility,” Tony explained before Fury went off the deep end. “He has completed thirteen murder death kills so far. We are a society of peace and understanding, we are not equipped to handle criminals as cruel and detestable as Brock Rumlow.”
,” Tony murmured, and if Steve wasn’t excited before, he was now. After all, comfortable for their preferred night-time activities was about more than just getting undressed. “Thirty minutes, tops. Why don’t you see if anything catches your eye in the toys?”
“You know, I was going to ask if this was somehow about me,” Tony said in slow, deliberate words as he casually leaned into the door jamb. “But guessing from the world’s first silent-but-deadly shovel talk Natasha just glared at me… is there something you want to tell me, Steve?”
“It’s a long drive to Manhattan, Steve,” Tony whined, but Steve only laughed and kissed Tony’s pouting lips.
If you google it, the first "notable alumni" that shows up is Jeffrey Epstein, but rest assured: he switched colleges by the second year. Turns out he is (and I'd argue for many, many reasons) not Cooper Union material.
“Don’t mention it,” Steve said to interrupt Tony’s nervous ramble before it got too far or embarrassing for either of them. “You came all the way down to Brooklyn for pizza?”
“Fuck you and your money: I’m not interested,” Steve said with a scowl. He snatched his coat off his chair, turned on his heel, and marched across the lobby to the elevators.
With Tony’s arms securely restrained, Steve pushed his free hand into the space between the mattress and Tony’s turned thighs, not that Tony knew what was happening until Steve’s fist closed around his cock. There was no pause, no gentle warning before Steve started jerking him off with a grip so tight it bordered on painful. Tony cried himself hoarse, cried out Steve’s name, and as Steve twisted his hand aggressively over the head of Tony’s cock, he sobbed in shock and in pleasure, his whole body convulsing uncontrollably under Steve’s heavy weight. Steve let go of Tony’s spent cock and instead grasped Tony’s forearm. With one hand holding Tony’s hand and the other grabbing the same arm, Steve had Tony well and truly trapped under him again, and he held Tony firmly in place as he pounded into his body, chasing his own release. Under him Tony purred and moaned his encouragement, still breathless and euphoric from his orgasm, and when Steve’s rhythm finally faltered and stuttered and groaned deeply with satisfaction into Tony’s neck, Tony pressed back eagerly to encourage Steve to stay, to not pull out yet and let Tony enjoy the satisfaction of being filled and used and so thoroughly satiated.
Steve Rogers, waxed clean from the neck down, freshly showered, and naked in all his glory in Tony’s bed.
Steve turned to see what Tony had whispered, but before he could ask, Tony’s pale, stricken face gave him pause.
Tony rubbed his palms over Steve’s back in big, soothing circles. “Come on, Steve. Let’s get in bed.”
“My mom betrayed me,” Steve answered at the same time as Tony said, “He has a crush on Sam Heughan.”
“Do you - no, but do they know it’s you?” Jimmy pressed, still giggling to himself, “do they know they’re talking to Captain America?”
Despite Tony’s weight settled comfortably on his torso, Steve sat up in one smooth, effortless lift and caught Tony in his arms. He would likely live to regret it, but the risk of aggravating his injuries was worth the sudden shiver that ran through Tony’s body and the wanton glint in his eyes when Steve laid his hands on Tony’s hip and lower back, braced his weight, and stood.
“I’m—I’m up, stop—!” he complained through spluttered laughter, doing his best to protect himself from her spike of energy as she climbed all over him, licking his ears and trying to get at his mouth with enviable enthusiasm. It was the wettest, most effective wake-up, and even now - forty minutes before dawn and closer to Christmas than Easter - Tony wouldn’t change it for the world.
“Captain Steven G. Rogers, this is our most venerable Governor Alexander G. Pierce. He is the savior of New Yorseylvania, and the genius mind behind the marvelous technological advancements that keep our society thriving and safe.”
It didn’t take long to get to the pier, and they walked out onto the dimly lit pier overlooking the coast. The ocean was dark around them, stretched to the horizon and beyond.
Sharon frowned a little, intuitively knowing that those were pretty tragic words without being able to put her finger on why. “Don’t sell yourself short,” she said instead. “He’s clearly enjoying himself. Wasn’t that a direct quote?”
“...Harvard?” Sarah breathed, stunned. “Honey, I—I don’t understand. Are you specifically going to Harvard, or are you applying to many law schools?”
“Well, you did alright with today’s surprise,” Tony said, as if having to think this over out loud. “Why not. Next surprise, tomorrow at four thirty… where?”
“There’s nothing you can’t do, Tony,” Steve whispered, gently cradling Tony’s face in his hands. “You’ve never needed me to get there, but if I can help you, sweetheart, I won’t let you down.”
“What, today?” Tony blurted out before he could reconsider his word choices. He cleared his throat quickly, trying to think of ways not to sound or look too disappointed; he was going to introduce Steve to Rhodey, to Pepper—to everyone. Quickly, with a small, but genuinely hopeful smile, he asked, “Is it so urgent that it can’t wait until you’re back?”
The only thing that gave away Sharon’s surprise was a slight pause. Without a word, she stepped out of Steve’s office to hold the door for him, and by the time Steve stepped out to march down the hall towards Sitwell’s office, she seemed more poised, ready to fall in step behind him.
Without thinking, Tony’s body clenched at the stretch. Tony distinctly felt the rim of his ass pulsing around the plug to bring it back into his body. It was a primal need to fill that unbearable emptiness inside him. After all that time spent watching people lusting over Steve all the while knowing that nobody knew of his little secret—a secret that might even drive Steve to fuck him publicly in front of friends and strangers if Tony told him about it—Tony was already so close to losing his mind.
Steve gave his partner a dry look then carried on as if no interruption had happened. “Tony spent this last week trying to understand why a killer would choose those specific scenes out of all his books. The books were all written years apart, the scenes have nothing in common except that they are explicitly sexual, but there are so many other scenes a killer could have selected. He told me yesterday that there is one more thing that ties them together, except he wasn't sure how someone other than him would know their connection. So,” Steve said in conclusion of his summary and turned over the folder with Tony's notes so Bucky could see the excerpts Tony showed him the night before. “These three are excerpts of the scenes used to pose the victims. The rest are scenes that do not fall into the category Tony has identified. He’s thinking, if someone reads these scenes very carefully, it may be possible to separate them accurately.”
“I would’ve killed for that line!” he whimpered through his laughter, and it took Miriam a moment to catch up with the rest and remember that Tony was there for his role as Dracula.
As he knelt to wash Steve’s legs, ass, and everything in-between, he couldn’t help but shake his head and, glancing up at Steve, muttered, “I feel like someone’s going to report me to the authorities for touching priceless art any minute now...”
With the first post free enough to turn, Tony tossed the shovel aside and crouched down to get a good grip. With a grunt and more effort than he ever remembered, he pulled the post out and threw it aside.
Steve’s curious confusion turned stiff and alert at the sound of Tony’s name. “What? No. He’s busy with the election. What’s happened, Buck?”
“Thank you, but I’m good with the cab. You know,” Tony whispered then, almost secretive with his confession. “I really enjoyed your surprise tonight.”
But Steve wouldn’t be Steve if he turned to a life of manicures and bon-bons. He loved what he did, working with people one on one and being a part of helping them regain their physical independence.
“Loving you is terminal?” Tony echoed with a feigned, dramatic wonder that left Steve rolling his eyes and grinning like an idiot. “Damn, but what a way to go.”
“Unless it’s a kidnapping situation, no, Bucky, I’m not worried,” Steve said in a tired voice. “And I’d appreciate it if you stopped accusing him of anything before you’ve met him.”
Bucky gave him a flat look. “This isn’t a debate,” he drawled at the same time as Steve said, “You have ten.”
Instead of arguing, however, Bucky closed the folder and looked at Steve. “If that’s true,” he said quietly, distracted by his thoughts. “Wasn’t there a letter Stark found to do with this? A guy who accused him of rape because he expected to end up in the book?”
The audience burst into applause and laughing whoops of triumph, and Steve couldn’t help but preen just a little for them. Across the desk, Jimmy chuckled and shook his head. “I think I would, too, if a man like that was running behind me!”
“That’s it?” Steve called after him. Against the silent backdrop of the evening, his voice carried a startling punch, and Tony turned with his hand on the door handle to look back like he was bracing himself for the worst.
It wasn’t Steve’s place to kinkshame anyone, but this was beginning to push a boundary he wasn’t all that sure about. But he would try anything twice, so he did as Tony asked and put on the helmet.
“You should see me with a stick,” Steve said as a half-joke, but the sudden heated look Tony gave him in return told him Tony had understood.
“Sharon worked on the new routine, man,” he said quietly. It was almost worse that he wasn’t raising his voice or getting angry about it; Steve couldn’t bear the disappointment. “She needs our help two hours a month to practice something new, and you bail? You can’t do two hours.”
like a man. He sure filled out his uniform with excellent potential, but what if you got down there and his sperm were as hot as his laser vision? Or maybe his alien body was simply at a different acidic point and would chemically fuck your shit up from the inside?
than Harvard Law School. But what I personally I admire most about them is their continued commitment to their original goal to break class privilege and support artists exclusively based on merit. (I'd like to think canon Steve's biggest dream would've been to go there; not only could he do what he wanted, but he'd be no financial burden on his ma anymore with all their financial support!)
” he cried, then caught himself and immediately turned his eyes back on the road. There’d even been a little crack in his voice, and Tony giggled shamelessly at Steve’s scandalized shock.
The seminar was well attended for a talk on the pitfalls of privatized harvests. Steve glanced around him, and like himself, many of the others had their pets with them. His was the only human, however. Everywhere he took Tony, his pet attracted attention and longing glances; fragile though they were, the power of human anesthetics were legendary, and enormously rare in raw form.
“It is intended as rehabilitation, Steve Rogers, not a punishment,” Tony tried to explain, but Pierce spoke up before he could continue.
“Nick Giordani, November 29th,” Steve said with a quiet sigh. “His body was discovered two days later at GMD Shipyard, posed nude. Amy Nyugen, December 7th, posed nude in an alley between 86th and 85th; her case was initially with the 62nd until the 20th found Tara Jones in the Seventy-ninth Street Boat Basin, also nude, also posed. That’s when we noticed the pattern.”
“I can clean the house,” Steve interrupted, since neither of them had bothered to include him yet. Clint looked a little disturbed by the suggestion, and Tony looked like Steve’s words somehow hurt him.
“I’ll just need a minute to get dressed,” Tony said, snickering quietly in surprised amusement when Steve pouted at him. “Don’t give me that, darling. Undress me when we get back.”
Steve watched with a somewhat glum expression as Tony undid his belt and started on his pants. Those were all the duties he wanted to be in charge of. “I kind of wish you could keep that belt on,” he admitted with a wry smile.
“I did the math,” Steve lied in a last-ditch effort to convince him. “After the mattress, there’s only five thousand left. After my half of your rent, you’re left with 1,750, or 350 a month. That’s less than a hundred quid a week; actually, now that I think about it, I’m sure I owe you more—”
As expected, Belova’s loud moans attracted a small audience of analysts who surreptitiously found reasons to gather near Tony’s station. Once the wet sound of kissing and the hitching cries of pleasure came over the speakers, having others there holding their breath in audience of Bond’s performance made it easier for Tony to remember that this was for work.
“We have too much to do here,” Steve explained, gesturing at the tower of unopened boxes. “And between the two of us, I’m more familiar with your books.”
Steve’s words trailed off uncomfortably, and when the dim light in the restaurant caught Steve’s eyes just right, Tony realized they were wet with unshed tears. He couldn’t help but stare.
Both Steve and Tony turned to stare at Clint in their surprise. It took a moment for Clint to realize the silence was unusual, and he turned back to eye them both in return.
“Captain Steve, such informality is frowned upon outside of familial or romantic bonds,” Tony explained as calmly as he could. “There are no loopholes to polite society. We do not call each other dude, or bro, or man, or mate, in the case of Anglican English. Professional address must include appropriate title, first name, middle initial, last name. In non-professional settings, or interactions between friends, one may shorten this address by excluding the middle initial at first, then continuing only with first name and last name.”
“Did you wake him up for this? Tony, you’re the worst,” Steve heard from a near distance, followed by a smack and Tony’s contagious snickering. By the time Channing took over the phone, Steve was smiling again.
Steve stared at his friend for a long moment, then calmly raised the phone to his ear again. “I take that back, sweetheart, it looks like Bucky’s having a meltdown. I’ll call you back.”
“Spin or no spin, and these control the power,” Rhodey was telling Steve, “the joystick is pretty self-explanatory. Hold on, Tony!” he called to Tony then pulled the joystick down to make the bull snap up. Tony hung on easily by his thighs, with both hands off the bull. “Got it? This is the emergency stop.”
He let the question trail off, as if it was a decision Tony really needed time to make. As if a speech Tony intended to fully ignore deserved his attention when it could be given to his husband. But in two days he would be addressing engineers and analysts from the finest labs in the country, and for that Tony still had plenty of literature to review.
“I didn’t even help,” Steve complained, frowning down at his hands and the half-dozen deep, red gashes from the barbed wire. Tony had only just managed to get the bleeding to stop, and now Steve had to sit in the back of the truck while Tony did all the work himself.
“Thor? He’s deceptively smart, really percep—hey! Thor, I need to talk to you, got a minute?” he got up from the table once Thor picked up, and he walked a few feet away for more privacy. The conversation wasn’t long, and Thor wasn’t surprised.
Speaking in Cimbri was funny, in its own way. All other languages Steve had studied and practiced were learned with the finest tutors available to the crown. Native speakers and specialized linguists coached him on how accents and mannerisms conjured different social connections in each culture, and he spent days memorizing which to adopt and which to avoid. While Steve modeled most of his accents after Tony, whether in German, English, or Spanish, his tutors always impressed the importance of perfect elocution, mindful vocabulary, and polished accents no matter what language or message he shared.
“So, it’s your mom, dad, little brother,” Steve summarized after a stretch of thoughtful silence, “who else?”
She had returned to her desk after a meeting with Hill’s secretary when her personal phone started ringing. All she needed was more drama to deal with, but when she saw the name on the screen, she picked up the phone and ran into Steve’s office where she could shut the door behind her.
Tony didn’t know what to say. For a second he found the will to look away from his Steve to look at the house again, imagining all of the love and laughter and memories Steve saw there already. They could grow old here together, kept safe by the soothing privacy of the forest and the sea all around them.
“Steve! Damnit, you scared me,” he laughed, shaking his head at himself before squeezing Steve just a little closer, a little possessively, before relaxing back against the wall. For reasons they both chose to overlook, Tony didn’t stop playing with Steve’s hair.
Between the soothing noise and the incredible water pressure, Steve managed to calm his heart rate for a long, relaxing break. He left the water running even when he stepped out to dry off and pull his boxers on, brushed his teeth and got ready for bed, but in the end, he had to shut it down and abandon his temporary sanctuary.
“What, seriously?” Steve shot back from the door, closing it in front of him. “You’d let me sacrifice my future for a story?”
After a brief reflection, the judge called Romanov up to see him. Tony explained the situation again and let Romanov look at the papers herself. Without an explanation for her client’s fraudulent age as written on her license, Romanov could only nod in understanding and return to her seat and explain it all to her own client.
The right thing would have been to ask Tony for permission to touch him, but Steve didn’t have the presence of mind to form coherent sentences. Like a man possessed, he gently reached under the collar of Tony’s shirt to fish out that familiar ball chain. He ran it over his finger, until his own dog tags fell into his palm.
He took a seat on the other end of the couch and accepted the second of two Sno Balls out of the box. It was still wrapped in its plastic wrapper, and Steve tried to resist the smile of breaking it free. When had he last eaten something so unhealthy and delicious?
The victim had been emasculated by fire and left to die from his wounds. Left for someone to find in the morning bustle in a sleepy, family friendly part of town. Whether Tony was the one who left him there or the poor soul who found him was too much for Steve to think about.
Tony’s breath hitched and his body shuddered with the first touch of Steve’s thick, long fingers. His slack body offered no resistance as one, then two fingers pressed into him. Every gentle stroke of his fingers sent warm, rolling waves of pleasure through Tony’s body, and lax as his body was, Tony’s ass twitched feebly around Steve’s fingers, trying to coax him deeper into his body. In his dreams, that stretch of Steve’s fingers grew even more impressive until it was nearly painful, but still Tony’s limp body took it and his heavy tongue begged for more, accommodating Steve like it was all he was ever meant to do.
He might not keep wads of cash rolled up and hidden in his curtain rods, but that didn’t mean people couldn’t imagine Howard Stark’s son stowing treasures in his room. The bolt helped.
Despite his limited range of motion, Steve was still trying to see what Tony meant by ‘breathe,’ when a light, blunt pressure replaced Tony’s fingers.
Thor hummed pleasantly after a beat, having perked up a little now that he, too, figured out what plan and story Tony was weaving. “I always knew you were a weasley fellow, Stark, but to see you put it to use for the good of others?” he said, patting Tony on the shoulder. “I am glad to count myself your friend.”
“Call me Steve. Thank you for seeing us on such short notice,” Steve replied while Tony tried to get over his cough.
There was a sudden gasp and a deep, guttural groan from somewhere behind him, and he looked over his shoulders to see Tony staring, wide-eyed at what he was making.
“Oh. I guess you need a key to my place for that, huh?” Steve seemed to realize, as innocent as the day he was born. “Get your butt over here, Tony. I’ve got something that belongs to you.”
For someone who was bracing himself for some 20th century midwestern courting ritual, Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing. All he could do was nod and hope Steve understood.
Tony, who had hoped for another miraculous smile, quickly pressed his own lips together before he looked like a fool. “You bet,” he managed through what had so nearly been a wishful smile of his own. “Good night, Steve.”
The young man was startled and looked around to see who had spoken. When Orfeo saw that it was the King himself, his whole body went still and his face drained of color.
“I have found that it is reasonable, perhaps even cheaper to eat out if one is single in the City,” Thor noted, but Tony only gave him a look that expressed how much he didn’t appreciate being undermined.
“A king who cooks,” Tony murmured, fascinated by the concept - as if this was a new species of monarch he was discovering in the privacy of his own palace.
“That would be an impressive accomplishment,” Steve observed, but his editor’s role was coming on too easily, and he found himself asking, “but that’s not the same thing as proving women enjoy your writing. How does that happen with magazines?”
Steve wanted to see the Sleeping Lion and the old church, and apart from that he was happy to eat anything and walk anywhere. Tony wanted to eat his weight in fresh chocolate - the good shit, where the expiration date was measured by hours, not weeks. They sketched out a loose plan for the rest of their day in the city, and Tony had started furtively comparing the Vacheron Constantin catalogs in Lucerne and Geneva when the food arrived.
“What I’ve done? I gave a whole fucking community a hero!” Tony snarled in reply. “For the kids who are struggling to be themselves because they don’t fit the mold, they can look back and remember when they watched you score the penalty that got us our first Olympic medal in 2020. And now you’re the man who isn’t going to let some archaic, backwards country stop you from representing our country. Don’t—they don’t need athletes who come out in suicide notes or, or when it’s convenient, after retirement. You’re a hero to people right now, when they need to believe in you.”
“Tony made it clear that time was of the essence,” Dr. Odinson said as he led them through the apartment to a large, brightly lit office where a small couch had been made ready across from an armchair. “Please, have a seat.”
Heads turned when Tony returned to the office with the legendary Captain in tow, and an excitable silence fell over the sparse crowd. Only a handful of police officers remained in the station since Tony had left with the Chief Director to recruit the Captain. It was unclear how many had resigned from their duty and how many had simply taken the day off to comfort their families, but that no longer mattered. They could not fail with Captain America among them.
While Steve and the other masters were acquainted, it occured to Tony that for the first time, he wasn’t alone in his fate. A human pet stood beside each of the other masters, both of them female. Tony recognized them as humans immediately, but that didn’t mean much anymore. Seeing other humans was so rare that any sense of kinship was lost to the shock. If he was honest, he’d forgotten what girls looked like.
With a heave, Steve rose to his feet, carrying the weight of the three assailants on his back. He threw them either way, kicking one in the gut, punching the other two as they fell off of him like insects.
“—and does he have the kind of job that allows for a family? Or does he expect that you’ll drop everything if the kids need you? What if there’s an issue with religion? What if he believes in spanking, or corporal punishment?”
A cautious hope rose among the station staff, and as they watched the white police vehicle markers move on the map to converge on the blue dot, the embers of confidence surged into a bright optimism. Their colleagues had the heartless criminal cornered, and soon, their MDK’d friends would be avenged.
“It looks real,” he said with a clear awe in his voice, and he glanced at Tony for approval before touching the skin with his fingers. It wasn’t warm like a person’s face would be, but it was soft and supple like real skin. “This is incredible.”
instead of these people - many of whom are married, by the way, that’s - I don’t know what you were thinking.”
Her quiet sense of rebellion made Steve smile, and in that realization, he found himself happy to spend the afternoon with Jane. “Airplanes don’t go that far. You’d need a rocket or a space shuttle to see the stars. It is possible, just not with airplanes.”
Tony took a moment to realize what Steve had said, then turned and stared at Steve in muted disbelief.
Professor Hawley stepped out shortly after him and gestured for them to follow her as she led them down office hallways to a conference room.
There was a brief pause on Sarah’s end, but it was so quiet Steve was half-sure she’d put him on mute.
“You have to admit, it would be a pretty smooth pick-up move,” Steve said with an impish grin. “It’s not every day the sexiest man in the bar randomly picks me out of a sea of people to be fake dating.”
Tony made the mistake of opening his eyes and seeing the crowd. Every creature was openly staring at him; some were even bold enough to touch themselves openly, taking full advantage of the show Steve was putting on for his own benefit.
“My biological ‘dad’ went to prison when I was six,” Clint told him while they wedged the potatoes and halved the bell peppers, only pausing when necessary to make air quotes with his fingers. “I had a brother, Barney. He was old enough to work, so ‘mom’ let him stay at home. When mom found out,” he continued, this time with a smile on his face, “I’d been here almost a month? They’d treated me the same as Tony—chores, allowance, schoolwork. But when mom caught on, she took Tony and me out to Sedona. Two weeks; she spent three to five hours a day in spa treatments while Tony and I did everything we couldn’t do at home. Water parks, balloon rides, helicopter tours. Took horses out to the Grand Canyon, learned how to make bows and arrows ...until Tony tried to rope a buffalo, and we were invited to never leave the resort grounds again. Got my first facial the next day,” he finished with a big grin.
Steve was going to be sick. He needed to get away from these loudmouthed vigilantes, but there was no easy way past them. He tried to wrap his arms over his head to block them out, but they were so loud and so close. It was finally Carol who started ordering them to take a step back and to give her and Steve some space. They meant well, but they were a little dumb as a herd.
“Good, that’s good,” Thor seconded, “too big of a risk, an’ we’re on deadline. I mean, how’d you even know you’ll get good stuff?”
The more they thought about the circumstances and the equipment necessary, the more they agreed it was more likely that someone was spying on Tony remotely. While Tony’s dining room fortunately had the least amount of furniture and decorations, neither Steve nor Bucky found cameras hidden in any plants, books, or paintings.
Tony had visited Christmas Markets every year of his life. As a child, he joined his father on the opening day of the market where Howard would give a short speech on why the holidays were so important to their families, culture, and kingdom. Tony had not continued that tradition, and instead made an effort to visit on a random day every year.
Tony looped his arm around Steve’s again and steered them away to put more space between them all. “Bad example,” Tony said with Steve in an apologetic tone, sliding his hand into Steve’s and tangling their fingers together. “What about something harmless. A strawberry. When is a strawberry dead?”
Steve stopped dead in his tracks as his dad’s visit from the day before came back to him. The black suit was still in the drier! He hurried to the laundry room, and behind closed doors, he spun out of the towel and into the suit in a matter of seconds.
At no point in all of Tony’s efforts to comfort the Captain did the man look at him. He simply looked out the window at the sparkling city that passed by and absently rubbed the back of his left hand, as if Tony did not exist or had never spoken. Tony could only wring his hands as he gripped the steering wheel. This man was his responsibility, and if that was not already the most important responsibility of his life, Captain Steve was Tony’s hero. Letting him down was not an option.
“What’s this for, anyway?” he murmured, angling the belt buckle Tony that had flashed at Rhodey earlier to read it himself. “Pro Rodeo Cowboys Association?”
have a reason, Tony, it’s okay. That’s valid, and I’ll divorce you if that’s what you want. But I already know what I want. I’m asking what you want.”
They sat for what felt like an eternity, listening to speech after speech, and at some point Steve thought maybe he should pay more attention, but time was moving too fast and too slow all at once. Sitting on those lawn chairs lasted a lifetime, but when it came to walking across the stage, shaking hands with the Dean, and climbing the stairs back down to solid ground, time zipped past him so fast Steve couldn’t even remember how he came to stand on the lawn with a degree in hand and his phone buzzing itself into the stratosphere.
“Son, I’d sooner tell you how we had you,” Howard told him dryly. Steve took a sip of his coffee before Tony’s responding pout and huff had him grinning like a fool, but then Howard cleared his throat, and everyone at the table turned to hear him. “So, what is it that you do, Steve? Tony says you write books?”
“Prepare the paperwork for his termination,” Steve was telling her just as Sitwell started shouting at their backs across the bullpen.
“You can gently stir the struffoli in the oil, with this,” he said as he helped her up on the chair and handed her the skimmer. “Careful, so the oil doesn’t splash. It’s hot.”
After a long day of foraging, gardening, and walking the perimeter of the swampland he called home, Tony could finally sit back in the peaceful silence to enjoy his dinner. While the wind pounded against the wooden walls and the closed shutters of his sturdy little cottage, a fire crackled in the hearth, and Tony could enjoy his smoked water-snake in relative peace. If he didn’t chew it too carefully, it didn’t taste too bad either—chewy, sure, but pleasantly bland with his turnip mash.
, when there’s a picture of Martin Luther King, Jr. hanging over the bed. It’s like he’s judging me or something.”
“I know, but somewhere I missed the chapter about why we can’t call in everyone on your list and interrogate them,” Steve couldn’t help but argue, especially now that he was staring down the barrel of a three-thousand dollar wardrobe makeover. “Wouldn’t that be more efficient?”
Tony pressed a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck, and despite himself, he shuddered with delight. While Tony was distracted with coffee, Steve took a moment to steady himself, to remind himself of why this was something he needed, not something he wanted. This was no time for romance, this was all hinging on the end game.
Tony purred at the question, arching his back even with his legs spread, eager to feel more of Steve’s hands on him. “Put me to work,” he whispered in a hoarse, sleep-gravelly voice. “I’m ready to work, Steve, please, put me to work.”
Tony blinked owlishly as he slowly realized how badly he’d blown that out of proportion, then had to look down at his feet before his embarrassment turned into a crazy smile, or, worse, giggling. He cleared his throat quickly to regroup, trying to hide the tremble of laughter in his voice when he peeped out, “Nope, I’m good.”
“Yeah, but—isn’t that the main issue between couples?” Bruce tried, “intimacy disconnect, or something?”
“That isn’t a lot of pressure at all,” Steve drawled, but Maria only smiled more brightly, and rubbed his back.
“What’s going on today, Happy?” Steve had to ask once he got settled in the backseat. “It isn’t my birthday, or Tony’s birthday… it’s not our anniversary or Valentine’s. What am I missing?”
Steve quirked his head when Tony really paused after asking for his attention, and Steve gently nudged Tony’s foot under the table with the toe of his boot to urge him on. “Yeah?”
Patrick meant well, Steve reminded himself. He wasn’t the most tactful guy on the planet, but he meant well. That didn’t mean Steve’s hands didn’t itch to punch his roommate in the teeth. The pain of it would have been welcome, even.
Steve reached out with his tongue and lapped at Tony’s balls while he still could, all but slurping the soft skin up into his mouth. Tony choked on a shout of surprise, and around him, Steve responded with a deep, guttural moan. The blood drained into his cock so fast Tony was sure he was becoming dangerously lightheaded, and he barely managed to keep his eyes open and on Steve’s face, but he was transfixed. As his cock grew harder, Tony stared, wide-eyed, as Steve’s spit-slick lips stretched obscenely around its girth, and Tony could practically feel Steve’s throat being rubbed raw with every eager bob of his head.
“Who could blame her?” Steve said quietly, not really comfortable enough chatting with the people next to him. But Maria looked at him with a questioning arch in her brow, so he elaborated. “A childhood friend of mine had an alcoholic dad. It was a living nightmare.”
For centuries the people of Marham gather at her shrine to pray, to seek comfort, and pay homage to their protector. Invoking Brigid’s blessing in the festival of Imbolg poured life into their modest town. Her protection allow crops to flourish despite the craggly, northern climate and blessed Marham’s mothers with both healthy children and speedy recoveries. Homes were safe and livestock pleasantly plump so that no family had cause for grief for as long as Brigid was appeased.
Tony huffed at Steve’s attempt at humor and pushed his way in. “I’ve been wearing those clothes for thirty hours, sue me. Where’s the food?”
“That’s not fair,” Tony complained at the same time as Steve said, “He would be an engineer, programmer maybe?”
“That’s right, and you were my first,” Tony said with a straight face and a seductive glance, his delivery just coy enough that Stephen ducked his head to laugh.
“You’re really something,” he murmured, combing his fingers through Tony’s hair gently and brushing it aside so that he could see Tony’s face better. “Can I help?”
“Good. All I want is for my boy to be happy. Have a good life, a dependable partner. Clint’s gonna give us grandbabies, and I don’t care so much about this blood business as Howard does. But you listen to me,” she said with steel in her voice. “You hurt my boy, I’m not suing you, or taking your property like my husband would. I’ll take it out of your hide. Am I clear?”
That was his name, Steve thought. It was a good name, his mom gave him that name. Clouds of cotton candy swaddled him with love and comfort and his name, the world was such a beautiful place.
Steve stared back at her, overwhelmed by the praise but a little taken aback. “I appreciate it, Professor,” he replied, a touch hesitant. Who was she to call his marriage a misstep?
Tony frowned at the question, his expression caught somewhere between suspicious and offended. “How bad is it?”
Forgetting his questions and his confusion, Steve focused on what mattered and scribbled the address down on a piece of paper. He shot Maria a text to ask her to please cover for him in class that afternoon, then bolted for his car.
Their waiter brought their salads around first, and he hadn’t forgotten Tony’s two side plates. The conversation was briefly derailed into casual chit chat over the food as they each took some of kale and quinoa salads, but once the waiter was well out of earshot, Tony gave Steve a little kick under the table and asked, “Can you talk about it?”
Tony gave him a strange look, which, all things considered, was valid. Steve could have played it cooler, but with a man like Tony, Steve already knew his best chance for success was to leverage him with guilt and shame.
Tony’s eager hand didn’t help Steve’s insane challenge of trying to make no noise as he stumbled around the debris littering his room, while carrying Tony’s uncooperative weight. As if stroking Steve’s erection while they walked wasn’t bad enough, Tony rolled his hips up against Steve’s body, seeking the friction of his firm abdomen and unfamiliar body hair.
“That’s a good one! Good job, Captain America in the lead,” Carl grinned happily, “someone’s competitive, I see.”
Bucky glanced at the first charts and thumbed through the written pages without much interest. “Do they know how old we are?”
It was pouring rain outside, and it took Steve all of two seconds of staring at his drenched boyfriend to hustle him into the apartment.
“We both do,” Steve corrected him gently. “Nothing would make me happier than to see you with a family, Tony. I see the way you care for your people, you will be an exceptional father.”
“As often as I can,” Steve admitted with a smile even stone-faced Maria couldn’t resist returning. “Falling in love is the best feeling, everyone deserves to experience it.”
They were nearly at the 50s when Tony couldn’t feel his legs anymore. He started stumbling into the stairs, and when he inevitable tripped, Steve was there to catch him. Of all the things he could have said to rub this in Tony’s face, Steve didn’t do anything besides get an arm around his partner, and help Tony the rest of the way.
“Oh! I do,” he said and reached into his satchel where he pulled his resume out of a ready folder. “Here you go.”
Tony’s answering triumphant smile would have left Steve weak in the knees if he hadn’t already been sitting. All at once, Tony crowded into Steve’s space on his hands and knees, occupying Steve’s entire world so effortlessly. With every fiber of his being, Steve felt all the pressures of the world fade away as he let his eyes slip shut and yielded to Tony’s covetous lips.
“Fits with the theme,” Steve observed casually, though he was a little distracted by the twenty-something blonde climbing up to ride the bull while facing the wrong way.
Before he walked away, Steve stood and lifted the folds of his own robe to free his cock. He guided Tony closer and rubbed the wet head over Tony’s lips. Tony opened his mouth immediately, swallowing down Steve’s cock with palpable hunger. Steve didn’t let him feed for long, only giving him enough time to clean the precome from his apathetic cock. The small mouthful was enough to ease some of Tony’s anxiety and stress, but when Steve stepped away, Tony was left mewling pitifully after him. He felt more calm and contented, but he was still too aware of the bodies filing into the room to stare at him and the other pets. He did his best to think of other things, to focus on the lingering comfort of Steve’s taste in his mouth. Contentment, safety. Physical pleasure.
“And did you get the seats upgraded?” he asked, concluding the previous conversation by starting a new one.
“Antsy, Sparky?” Tony said with a smile, unaware of everything Steve was experiencing. He rubbed Steve’s thigh in encouragement, and pressed a soft kiss to his hip. “Guess I’ll indulge later, darling. Turn over? We’ll do it your way.”
The relative silence that followed made Steve look up again. By the surprised looks on both his boyfriend and his best friend’s faces, it looked like they had heard him after all.
“What I’m here for doesn’t matter,” Steve told him, growing more indignant by the idea. Sex worker or not, people had rights. “You don’t touch anyone without permission, and certainly not before any explicit agreements are made. Casual touches in public cost extra.”
James Rhodes crouched down in front of him. Steve’s head tipped forward. He wanted to hate Rhodes so bad.
Steve hummed thoughtfully at the question. “I’ve been gone for so long, I’m ready to just stay home for a few days. Did Bucky tell you he’s directing for the first time?”
The jaunty bounce in Steve’s step was so infectious that Tony couldn’t bring himself to look away. Even in the dark, December afternoon, Steve’s smile shone with excitement. He held Tony’s hand in his, and he made Tony feel so warm and safe that he could have pocketed his gloves then and there.
Steve absently caressed the back of Tony’s hand with his thumb while he drove, not once letting go of Tony for the whole ride home.
Steve held up his small bundle of shortbread biscuits then gestured for the unoccupied chair. “There are no other seats. Cookies for a chair?”
The next time he blinked, a series of sudden lights flashed behind his eyes. Soon his mind was filled with a vision of Tony floating above him, gazing down at Steve with lust clear in his eyes and a playful laugh warm between them. His silky, diaphanous robe billowed gently around his body, and as Tony floated closer, the waistband around Tony’s robe started to unfurl, and inch for inch, the robe peeled further away from his shoulders to reveal naked, tan skin and the glimmering silver adornments framing his lean, muscular body—
“You… thank you, Steve,” Tony whispered unevenly between attempts to catch his breath. “I, I didn’t think we’d make it there for a second.”
“Not alone you’re not,” Tony told him, and before Clint or Steve could get a word in, he brought two fingers to his mouth and whistled twice, two long, high-pitched notes. Dummy never seemed to be more than a few yards away, and the big grey horse came cantering from the side of the house with Tony’s bedroom windows.
Tony frowned to himself. “I got this, if you need to, I don’t know, question people, knock down doors, examine clues. Isn’t that what detectives do?”
Steve was so busy trying to get under the covers without Tony noticing how hairy his arms and legs were that he didn’t realize Tony’d been fiddling with Steve’s stole.
Steve made a face, looking from Tony to Tony’s phone and back again as he tried to figure out where Tony’s sudden energy came from. “Yeah, Jane Foster. Why?”
Thor had the decency to look a little shamefaced, but it was Bruce who answered him. “To prove to Yinsen that you’re a good candidate for brand director, and that you can write something the female audience will like. Tell me, Tony: what is it about this scheme of yours that a female audience will like?”
“Steve—darling,” Tony moaned softly, his head tipping to the side as Steve worked on raising a dark bruise at the base of neck. With a half-hearted tug of Steve’s hair, he whimpered, “please?”
“Heroism isn’t what you do when you know how things will turn out. You could’ve run away when you saw how big he was,” Tony pointed out, smiling up at him. “You didn’t run away. You don’t even know how much that meant to me.”
Bucky nodded in understanding, and started looking around for an easy exit that wouldn’t tip off the FBI on the scene. “Do you have a key to his place?” he asked quietly.
“I am Sam Wilson,” the other man said. “This is James Barnes. We work in Research and Development for MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service.”
Steve gently pressed two fingers over Tony’s lips to interrupt his self-deprecating ramble. “Okay, two things. First, with eyes like yours, you don’t need to worry about anything on your face,” Steve told him, and if he hadn’t been so wound up about his second point, he would have kissed Tony silly for the way his eyes grew wide in surprise. Did Steve really not compliment him often enough? He would need to be better.
Steve didn’t linger or waste any time. “Quick one now,” Steve promised, as if it hadn’t been an off-hand joke. “More later.”
“Captain Steve Rogers, if you could only feel how my heart beats for you. You fill me with joy-joy feelings the way you do battle with that quarrelsome Scrap! You are more fearsome and mighty than on laserdisc—”
For a long time, Steve didn’t say a word. He didn’t need to. There was an unwavering strength in Steve’s arms, and as beautiful and thick as his biceps were, the strength of his arms wasn’t a physical quality. There was something about having Steve’s arms around him that made Tony feel like nothing could hurt him. That Steve would never allow such a thing to happen.
She eyed him skeptically, daring him to fess up to his erratic career decisions. Steve shook his head ruefully; looking back, even he recognized some of his choices had been rash and born of stubborn conviction.
“I don’t know,” Bruce said with a small frown, and it was his turn to huddle into his drink as if he could hide in it. “I don’t like the pressure… no, I don’t—I don’t like that.”
“I can get started with the house, trade off when you get back,” Clint suggested, “I’ve got the stables to get through, I think we got mold—”
“That, well. You’re not wrong,” Steve agreed with a quiet laugh. “This story has a way of staying with you.”
“I had a long day, I’m getting dinner and falling asleep to whatever stupid shit the TV is playing. The last thing I need is jet lag,” he added with a little shake of his head.
Bruce frowned in sympathy, and he remained quiet until he thought of something to say. “Has he surviving family, perhaps?”
Steve blinked down at his phone. He had no idea what to say, or what to do. Was he meant to feel excited by the possibility of getting back together? Was he supposed to feel pity? What the hell was Tony trying to achieve with those words?
Soon, it would be 9 o’clock in the morning, and maybe Steve would be too late. Morning rush hour offered the best opportunity for maximum damage, but it did not seem to worry anybody at Q-branch as much as it worried Steve. As always, Q left him in the care of his technicians and engineers. Usually, they were serviceable enough, but on a time crunch like this, Steve felt his cool slipping.
“I don’t know,” Bucky regretfully admitted. “Steve, I know nothing. I got you as soon as I got Pepper’s message.”
“Officer Jane Foster, what a relief! There are no clothes available for Captain Steve Rogers, and none available to purchase that respect his measurements. He requires an escort to the tailor for evening attire fit to dine with our distinguished Governor, and delivery directly to Taco Bell at six o’clock. Would you be able to do this for me?”
“Us?” Tony repeated in a whisper, but if he had meant to continue and say something else, he was interrupted by the realization that their car was waiting for them. With a self-deprecating roll of his eyes and a quick thanks, he got into the car and let Steve shut the door behind him.
He had dreamt for so long for this chance, for this moment to steward and to earn his place as a gold status adult. The stewardship was a silver class citizen’s chance to prove that they saw themselves as part of society, as something bigger than themselves. The stewardship was not for the benefit of the citizen ascending to gold status, but for the juvenile being mentored. The steward was only ever meant to be selfless and giving.
“Run, bitch!” Tony hissed so loudly people four rows away turned back to glare at them. “He’s crazy!”
“Call Barnes’ references before the end of the day,” Steve changed the subject again. “He’s competent, but I am not confident in his ability to multi-task or lead a team. Call me back with a report by voicemail tomorrow morning; otherwise, move on to that what’s-his-name out of Princeton. At least he’ll have a network to stand on.”
Steve inhaled deeply to steady his nerves and hurried back to bed where he had left his phone. He hadn’t heard from Tony in almost two months. He had meant to reach out, starting one message after another without ever sending them, because anything Steve wrote sounded so sad and needy. Sure, it was great to become friends with your co-stars, but not like this—the business was all about moving around and never being in the same place twice, he knew that. Still, it was almost embarrassing to admit how badly Steve missed his friend, even to himself.
class was enough to leave him speechless, but Tony acted like it was something entirely expected and typical.
“Who’s the new captain?” Tony asked after a short silence. Steve frowned at the thought, drawing a hand through his hair.
He was speaking with the building security when Tony called his name. Steve spun on his heels to see Tony shuffling down the stairs, pale and wide-eyed. He had his phone in his hand.
“Then what are you waiting for, sweetheart?” Steve asked, breathless in his excitement. He didn’t dare laugh, because what if he was wrong? Hell, what did it matter? “You won’t know until you answer it.”
“Nobody sees things better than you, Steve,” Tony said with affection warm in his voice. “All you have to do is trust yourself. I do. When you see it, you’ll know the one that’s right for you.”
“I think that’s what stayed with me for days after I saw the movie, that inner conflict of who your character is or thinks he is,” Stephen said, serious one moment then effortlessly bringing it back to lighter humor by admitting, “it’s becoming a problem: I was in the shower two days later, shampooing my hair for five minutes because I kept thinking, if you take away reality, what is left? And is that who I am? Do I even want it to be real?”
“People don’t… pay. Not for me,” he mumbled. The mattress shifted as Steve pressed up on his hands and knees, but Tony didn’t dare look up. Even when Steve got his arms around him and drew Tony into his lap, Tony wouldn’t meet his gaze. Instead, he curled closer and pressed his wet face into Steve’s chest.
“They’re looking for a threesome,” he explained as soon as he came back around to Thor and Bruce. “She and her partner are trying to get pregnant, and they want a, and I quote, ‘willing donor.’”
Steve only preened in return with an unbearably smug smirk. “That’s fair, but you’re the one dating me, Tony. What does that make you?”
“You can do it on a yoga mat, if that’s what you mean. That’s what I did, but there are other forms of pilates, too.”
It wasn’t until he was pulling his undershirt off and caught his reflection in the mirror that the idea came to him.
Once invited, Jane strode into the Lieutenant’s office and quickly circled palms with Tony in greeting.
Steve slammed the drawer shut and tried not to shout at his mom. If she’d just let him get off the phone to get a dinner together so he could be mulish and alone in peace, he wouldn’t be here bleeding into a paper towel in the only apartment in Gotham without band-aids.
“Whatever happens, I want you to know that there’s no-one else I’d want as my partner, Steve. No-one else I’d rather spend my time with—even if, uh. Even if we leave room for Jesus,” he tried to say as diplomatically as possible. “Whatever makes you comfortable, you know? I want that, whatever makes you comfortable.”
Steve closed his eyes and hung his head. It looked like he was trying not to outright grimace and Tony’s shoulders hunched a little with disappointment. Except, after a long stretch of silence, he realized Steve still wasn’t looking back up at him.
When Steve rolled out of bed two hours later, a notification on his phone informed him that Tony had replied to his email last night thirty minutes after receiving it. He needed all of a minute to download the file and upload it to Blackboard. Steve knew he should feel bad, but he really didn’t have time to care. Having a little more energy in the tank for practice this morning so he wouldn’t let the battalion down was more important.
Tony must have come six or seven times before he was finally given a break and allowed to rest. True to his word, Steve sat on the platform beside him and drew his pet closer so Tony could rest his head in Steve’s lap. Steve had already fed him as much of his come as he could that day, but the way Tony softly whispered and begged, Steve caved easily. He pulled the blankets high over Tony’s body to keep him warm, and assured of his comfort, he freed his own cock and guided it to Tony’s lips. It was soft and dry of come, but the rich scent of his musk and the weight of his cock on Tony’s tongue soothed Tony’s nerves like a gentle salve.
“I misjudged you, Rogers,” Maria said after another stretch of silence, once the shock of Steve’s stunt faded away. “You’re really something else.”
If looks could kill, Steve’s phone wouldn’t have survived its untimely interruption. He couldn’t have one minute of peace? With a finger between the pages to keep his place, Steve poked at his phone to see what was so urgent that someone would email at eleven o’clock at night.
Josh mirrored Steve’s amusement with a smile as he continued. “You know, at that first screening, I remember the audience came out of it looking really shaken. The movie carries this… very human element to it that is unique and gritty, and it’s uncomfortably real. You’re putting forward a side of American gothic we haven’t seen before. How has the experience been so far?”
Graham was out of his seat with gusto, and to the thunderous applause of the audience, he led Tony and Colin around to an attached, round platform beside the main stage. Two mats were already rolled out for them. Tony unbuttoned his suit jacket and held it out to Graham, and Colin soon did the same.
“Tell me about your day,” Steve whispered. They were stretched out on Tony’s deep set couch, Steve lying on his back while Tony enjoyed his cushioned position on top. “Are you doing more book signings?”
“Tony, shut up,” Steve mumbled, making an effort not to slur his words to sound more serious in his demand. “Please, don’t make me wait longer, want to feel you now. I know what I want. Fuck me.”
“Duty calls,” Tony said with a smile, and they both got up to get going. “Come down and help us test out some hoverbikes? Five o’clock.”
“Two years now, your Majesty,” she said, still looking a little worried with her answers. “My late husband was a devoted educator in Friedstadt. That was our home.”
Steve even picked him up, prompt and nicely dressed in a blue button-up and dark blue jeans. The conversation flowed as it always had, easily and endlessly, bouncing from one topic to the next. The only difference now was that Steve held his hand while he drove, their fingers intertwined and their joined hands resting casually against Steve’s thigh. Steve grabbed a big canvas bag out of the trunk once they had parked, but he still held on to Tony’s hand as they walked.
“You’re a work of art,” he murmured, laving his tongue across Steve’s right pectoral and sloppily sucked down on his nipple, biting into the firm, ample muscle with a husky groan of pleasure.
Tony grimaced at the thought, but found he couldn’t disagree. Steve’s assessment rang too true. He took a look around the kitchen to be sure he’d picked up everything, then put the kettle on for tea. Chamomile was necessary after the day he’d had.
And Brock had been there; he was in that room, he would have seen everything. He would have seen Steve admit that he’d been unaware of the homework, he’d have heard that rotten woman support his ejection from the room. Most of those people were absolute strangers whom he’d barely see again, but Brock - Brock was the whole reason he was here; he was here to impress what a serious and worthwhile man he could be.
“Good luck,” she said in a more subdued tone than earlier, and if Steve had the time, he’d stop and think over what she said more carefully. But Brock was there, and that took precedence.
“You… such a dream,” Tony murmured, his tongue uncooperative and his head foggy in his afterglow. With every passing second, he could feel his limbs grow heavier, his body melting into the mattress. Boneless and incoherent, Tony floated between the planes of time and space, clumsily reaching for Steve in an effort to keep him close.
Even now, Steve wasn’t sure where he stood. Was Tony an exception? Was Steve lying to himself and remaining closeted when he could be less of a hypocrite and accept the fact that he genuinely adored another man?
They worked in silence for some time, and Steve had moved on from Tony’s legs to the plush fleece blanket and soft cotton linens draped around him when Sharon stood up to stretch her back.
From behind him, he heard Steve whisper, “Tony?” but all that mattered was that he sounded untroubled and unharmed. Tony spun low, sweeping another Scrap off his feet, spun around to palm-fist him in the nose, then leaping to his feet to leave that Scrap to splutter and weep in his blood before attacking the next. Knee to the liver, punch to the throat, fingers in the eyes, and by the time he turned to take on the next Scrap, the Scraps were backing away from him.
Fury called another meeting. The gold class lieutenants took their seats around the table, and like the only other time Tony had been included in a strategic deliberation, he remained standing at a short distance away.
He shuffled out of the booth and made his way out of the diner as he tried to explain the situation to the owner. This was business, this was what he’d been groomed for all his life. One way or another, the tree house would be his.
He was so caught up in what Steve’s mouth was doing that he didn’t notice Steve’s free hand reaching for his cock. It was only a gentle, leisurely touch at first, but it quickly built into a tight grip and fast strokes, milking the orgasm out of him.
“I would like the mushroom, tofu, and kimchi chalupa supreme combo, and a tall honeydew agua fresca,” Tony said, then he turned to Steve.
“That’s a spectacular question that I can’t wait for Steve to answer over dinner,” Tony said with an innocent look and a helpless shrug. Carol wasn’t exactly the patient type, and she looked ready to tackle him to spill the damn beans - except with her sparkling white pant suit and all the media focused on them, she had to keep her fists to herself. Instead, she satisfied herself with making him pose for a picture with her and smiling at him with far too many teeth.
Bucky was the first to announce how comfortable he was, so if they wanted privacy, they’d have to go somewhere else. Despite his lazy attempt to wingman, Steve ushered Tony to the kitchen where there wasn’t a bed to make a wrong impression.
“But you’re on her side,” Bucky said quietly, hurting without laying any blame on his friend. “You’re a lawyer?”
As soon as Tony was out of sight, Steve let go of Bucky and stood up straight again. He cleared his throat. He could do this; he could be reasonable. There must be a reasonable explanation for all of this. They would laugh about this the next time they talked.
“Those live far from your galaxy,” Steve promised, “in acid baths, their scales bleed. We use it to make a popular candy our young eat when they feel unwell.”
“Imagine that, a self-sustaining king,” Steve said with a quiet chuckle, and Tony would have laughed if he wasn’t busy watched Steve kneading the dough until it was smooth and uniform. Then Steve rolled the dough into a basketball sized ball, wrapped it in cellophane, and put it in the fridge to cool.
Bucky looked confused, but agreed without argument. The Scraps started picking up their scant gear and heading back, until Steve called Tony’s name. As one, they stopped in their tracks and stared back.
“Open your eyes,” Steve urged him in a whisper, punctuating his demand by grinding his hips up against Tony’s so Tony could feel his hard cock pushing and pulling between his cheeks. Tony’s lashes fluttered and he bit into his lip again in a vainful effort to stay quiet, but finally he opened his eyes.
, but then Steve swallowed him to the root and hummed deliberately around his cock, distracting him enough that he almost didn’t feel the momentary pain of being stretched opened on Steve’s slick fingers, and Tony struggled to remember why or what he refused to do.
A hopeful smile stretched across Steve’s lips, warming his expression like a star rising in the darkest hour of night.
Tony sucked in his bottom lip and quickly wetted his lips with his tongue, trying to keep a clear, steady head. Sometimes, he still remembered that living for sex, for another creature’s pleasure and fantasy, wasn’t a healthy way of life.
“He’s a doctor?” Tony asked, miserably. The competition for high-income, high-status men was cutthroat business, and given his tantalizing attributes, the chances that this Steve Rogers was on the market were slim to none.
“Sir,” Tony said to Fury quietly, attempting to sound and act deferential despite his desperate need to get back on that terminal. “Is the doctor’s conveyance still in the parking lot?”
“Slow is good, Steve,” his dad promised. “You’re half human, this could all be normal for you, but… just in case it isn’t, you’ll want to know you can trust him.”
In two months, Tony would walk. In two months, Tony would take his robots and his degree and return to R&D at Stark Industries.
“It could have been worse,” Steve said with a lopsided smile, and it was the truth. After all, Howard hadn’t shot him. “Tossing hay bales off a moving truck might be my new favorite work-out.”
As Steve’s breathing evened out, Tony covered him with a soft weighted blanket. It was as if he’d been waiting at the ready to make sure Steve had every chance to catch his breath without allowing him to go cold. Despite wanting to feel Tony’s every last touch, the added warmth and comforting pressure of the blanket left Steve drifting away. Tony freed his legs one at a time, moving from ankle, to knee, to thigh with gentle hands and endless kisses. Gently, he helped stretch Steve’s legs out, massaging the aches and tension out of his legs with the same lavender oil from Steve’s anointment. The deep pressure of Tony’s strong, confident fingers kindled an undercurrent of lust through the satisfied haze Steve had lost himself to, and distantly he felt that all familiar heat coiling at the base of his spine, and his cock valiantly twitched in a feeble attempt for another go.
In the final days of drafting their proposal for the unification, Steve and Tony reconsidered the summer solstice with nothing more than determination and budding dreams. The celebrations were dramatically dissimilar, but theoretically compatible: it was possible to celebrate with games and food all day and lead into a night of fireworks and more food. If their wedding followed the summer solstice, it would give their people two consecutive national holidays - one to celebrate with their families and neighbors, and another to enjoy as a nation.
“Not necessarily,” Steve admitted with a shrug. “But it makes me qualified to try. And, I suspect there are things you’d like to say to me without an audience.”
“Thank you,” Steve murmured against his lips, and even though he had to return to his conversation, he reached for Tony’s hand to give it a gentle squeeze.
All his friends had their own midterms to worry about, so Steve rolled back into bed with every intention of hiding under his blankets where the world wouldn’t find him until his next lecture six days later.
“Hipster parents,” Sharon sighed to herself before continuing. “Apparently he only owns plaid flannel, and he has a date with a Harvard super genius so they’ve called an emergency Superbro Caucus—”
Steve laid him back against the firm back cushions of the couch. In his new, adjusted position, Tony reclined comfortably in a gentle backbend, and with one hand at the small of Tony’s back, Steve angled his hips up for himself, allowing Tony’s legs to naturally fall open. With a quick lift and sleight of hand, Steve slipped a cushion under Tony’s ass to keep him positioned just so.
“Not Tony,” Tony growled playfully, and try as he might to resist, Steve laughed against Tony’s smirking lips.
“If ever I doubted you were your father’s son,” they heard her muttering from the kitchen, and Tony immediately made a beeline for her voice. “You’d think the sun rises every morning just to hear your voice.”
Steve pulled away from the kiss abruptly. “Clinic, then dinner. Lots of it—” he cut off with sudden inhale as Tony rolled the condom over Steve’s cock with a triumphant smirk. But this time, Steve didn’t let it go as easily.
He came to an immediate halt several yards out. “Tony,” he whispered, “I thought we were going to a Christmas market. Why can’t we walk?”
His hero grinned, giving Marple a last scritch behind her ears before straightening. “How about a coffee?”
“Explain, please, sir,” Stephen said with an all too innocent smile. “There are a lot of people who want to know.”
“Why don’t you take him on a tour of some Brooklyn roach coaches?” Rhodey suggested. “He always complains about Manhattan being a sterile financial district with no character—”
Carol could see his plan falling apart. She shook her head. “Maybe save this for a one-year anniversary? That doesn’t sound like something you wouldn’t want to rush.”
The urge to put it on was overwhelming, and Tony hurried to give it back before he acted impulsively on a matter that deserved serious, careful thought.
Tony finally heard him and he grimaced in confusion. “What? No, it’s—you’re super sexy. How do you look like that when you eat like a twelve year old child?”
It wasn’t the first time Tony was used for feeding, but Steve never left his side while clients took what they wanted from him. Being touched without Steve’s staunch supervision made him sick to his stomach, as if he was now some worthless, public commodity that any stranger could fondle and suck on at their leisure. Tony had never felt so alone and so scared in his life. Where was Steve? A part of him hated that he had to depend on him, because truly, who was to say that Steve genuinely cared to protect him? After all, how much did farmers care for their dairy cows?
Everything was going fine until one unassuming Friday morning in October when the winter was starting to make itself known. Steve walked out of lecture and right into a throng of buzzing classmates crowding in the hallway.
Steve had only meant to briefly thank the volunteers, but instead he spent hours with them, thanking the local volunteers and helping to receive their donations while patiently answering the same questions over and over again. He didn’t know much, nobody did, but he could promise that their people’s security was their priority.
Steve tried to resist the urge to smile. “Fair enough,” he said once he’d gotten his face under control. “When do you go back to Geneva?”
“You want me, don’t you?” Steve wondered rhetorically, watching Tony like he wanted nothing more than to claim him for himself. “Roll over baby, let me taste you.”
Steve’s constant presence hadn’t always been easy to deal with; Tony’s studio was already small, and Steve’s limited ability to move or do things for himself made things worse. But even when he was miserable and bored, Steve had managed to ask for space and silence, and he didn’t take it personally when Tony left the studio for hours for some much-needed privacy. Sometimes all Tony needed to find an even keel again was to go down to the local pub, enjoy a pint or two while pretending to follow the game.
“On the planet where I have to remember every detail about every fucking cock under the sun!” Steve answered emphatically, turning heads all around him. “The cock’s technique, the direction the cock moves in, the initial position of the cock—Fridays they must face north, unless they have black feathers, then they only face north on Sundays, unless the owner’s name begins with a J, then it can only face North on Monday afternoons between the hours of one and four, but at least they all agree that on Wednesdays they wear pink.”
The irony, of course, was that this dream came to life when Steve realized his time was limited. Now, all he wanted was for the world to open up and swallow him whole. A nice, tidy end to a nice, tidy story.
“And when you’re family,” she continued, just as seriously, “if anybody hurts you, you tell me. I don’t care if they’re in New York, California, or fucking Mexico. You’re my son, my boy. Howard doesn’t always let me handle it my way,” she conceded with a wry smile, “but honey, nobody hurts my family.”
Steve’s classes started at 8:15, and he liked to be there by 7:30 to get ready for the day. He liked going on a short run in the morning, he liked his lukewarm shower, and he liked getting dressed while enjoying the smell of brewing coffee filtering through his apartment.
“I trust you, Tony,” he swore, “whatever happens, I trust you. I want to be with you, but I can’t do that if I can’t be honest.”
Instead of answering, Tony switched his audio from headset to speaker to treat Bucky - and a handful of nearby analysts - to the most trusted weapon in 007’s arsenal. Ironically, it was the only one he never seemed to damage.
“Speak for yourself,” Tony petulantly mumbled into Steve’s shoulder without leaning away from his cozy cuddle. “I’ve got a hot as fuck boyfriend who wants to have kinky sex with me and now I have to wait—”
He went to the gym twice a day - once in the morning for himself and once in the evening since Brock worked out before bed - with no luck. He got his textbooks, notebooks, office supplies, and the most he found was one of the scarier first-years he remembered from orientation, Maria Hill, who held a Ph.D. from Berkeley in the History of Combat, and who’d worked on deworming orphans in Somalia for the last eighteen months.
“What the hell?” he muttered, glancing between Rhodes and the back of Steve’s head. “Tony knows his dad’s racist as hell, right?”
Like an ant under a magnifying glass on a sunny day, Steve could feel Tony staring at him. He refused to turn, refused to look at anything but the eight thousand dollar watch on his wrist that assured him that time hadn’t stopped, and that he was still a safe man: a man of means.
“Steve Rogers?” Tony asked then in a quiet tone, but this time he sounded more embarrassed than unsure. “First, do you have further questions regarding the events that took place at Taco Bell this evening?”
Tony made a strangled sound and leaned back in his seat, leaning most of his weight against the armrest and glaring at the far wall. Steve could so easily imagine the veritable steam coming out of his ears, and he tried not to laugh at how agitated Tony was getting with his own plan.
Tony murmured something in the affirmative, drawing his knees together and curling into a content cuddle. Steve eased up on the heat and humidity he was projecting into the room, and soon the Boston winter air seeped in, encouraging Tony to crawl under the covers again for warmth.
But Steve didn’t get up. He smiled up at Tony and only wriggled closer until he all but crawled into Tony’s lap.
The climb started out well, but quickly turned into a crawl. Somewhere around the thirtieth floor Tony had to sit down to catch his breath, and poor Steve laid out on his back to soak up the cool comfort of the polished floor. Tony almost felt bad, except he meant what he said. It didn’t matter how many floors they had to climb; this was their best chance, and he wasn’t going to let it slip away.
Tony licked his lips to keep from laughing, and glanced over at Thor, who was only hearing half the conversation and looking curiously between his friend and this stranger.
“Tony, there’s been a misunderstanding,” Steve whispered before he lost his courage. He tried to smile to ease the surprise, but it didn’t help. The easy smile faded from Tony’s expression, and he frowned with concern. “It’s nothing bad,” Steve hurried to reassure him. “I, I have a personal shopper, Jan. Jan van Dyne. I don’t always have time to shop, so if important events come up, I ask her for help.”
“You didn’t know him, babe,” Tony assured him, turning the shirt over in his hands to see if maybe there was a way to wear the fucker inside out instead. “Hey, uh. Babe? How important is a shirt?”
“Mr. Tony,” Naser said a little bashfully, tugging on his sleeve and pointing at a poster advertising that lions were only a few yards away. The poster showed the lion lazing in the sun in the middle of his pride. “Are they all like, the lion’s girlfriend?”
But instead of straddling Steve’s lap (like Steve had hoped) or kneeling between Steve’s thighs (like Steve had fantasized), Tony sat down a polite distance away on the couch with his own helmet and towel.
Steve no longer had a reason to hold himself back. Death wasn’t nearly as frightening or thrilling than finally taking the chance to live.
Tony took Steve by the hand, and they walked together to where Howard was going over the marriage license and the prenup one more time.
Whoever had done the research on this human had done his or her job well: the target was clearly single. Steve removed one hand briefly to rub his fingers together, activating the lubrication of his right glove and letting it work a little more than usual. Five minutes added in prep, and hopefully that would be enough to get the canister in and the job done. The kid was young, he’d come faster than a speeding bullet. If his refractory period was just as quick, Steve would most likely had no trouble making up the added time lost to prep.
“This is a little more delicate,” Tony said as calmly as he could. “We are gay monarchs. We don’t have an heir. We just united two kingdoms, not everyone is happy about that. We need to be careful.”
A soft, mustard colored blended yarn caught his eye. He lifted it in his hands and tested the spun thread between his fingers. There was no information attached to the hefty ball, but instinct told Steve it was a classic tweed, and most likely a blend of cashmere and silk with traditional merino wool.
“Sweetheart, all I wanted to say was thank you,” Steve promised, needing Tony to know he was really happy and touched - that he wasn’t trying to hide some alarming turn of events. “The flowers are absolutely beautiful, the smell is amazing. I don’t know how you found such a close blue, but you’re really… I love you, Tony. I’m sorry I woke you before a meeting, it’s not an emergency or anything, I just, ha. I got a little overexcited.”
Now, Steve wanted nothing more than to be the little spoon. He wanted to feel Tony’s heartbeat steady and reassuring against his back; he wanted to feel his even breathing warm his neck. He wanted to hold those calloused, scarred hands in his hands until he fell asleep, and cradle them throughout the night whether they twitched in Tony’s dreams of endless paperwork, or they clenched in the odd nightmares that followed the less humane duties of his position.
How they got dressed, how they made it back to Boston, and how they got to Tony’s apartment was lost to Steve, but he did remember tumbling into bed with Tony’s thighs around his waist. The dimmed light in Tony’s room mimicked the setting sun, and with unhurried devotion, they found their rhythm again without the obscuring cover of darkness.
More importantly, he was someone Tony knew he could rely on. There was nothing Steve hadn’t done to be at Tony’s side, and whatever else Steve could have said, Tony already knew how he felt.
“Tell me the bomb squad is on the way, Steve,” Tony pleaded, “this—that’s not an amateur’s work, that’s a serious piece of equipment, you shouldn’t be handling it.”
“Tony, you didn’t give me a reason,” Steve told him with a low, impatient snap in his voice. “You told me your mom was worried, and that was
For Steve, it wasn’t so strange anymore to watch himself perform. Whether it was TV or movies, this was a strange but real part of his life. It had been years since seeing himself or hearing his voice stopped bothering him. But it was another experience entirely to see from an outsider’s perspective how he gazed at Tony with big cow eyes whenever Tony spoke, or how he gravitated after Tony’s movements instinctively any time Tony sat up or leaned away, as if Steve’s lizard brain couldn’t bear to leave more than two feet between them. Or the way his lips twisted in his discontent every time Tony fawned over Colin Farrell’s accent. Steve could only count his lucky stars that the camera operator cut away from him when Tony and Colin stepped away to see who could hold a plank longer, but then again, he’d never forget the sight of Tony getting cheeky about the challenge, or the round swell of his ass in those tailored jeans as Tony did his leg lifts.
“So long as she doesn’t scare you into putting any clothes on,” Tony half-joked, and found himself endlessly relieved when Steve genuinely smiled back at him. He pressed a little kiss to Steve’s shoulder before shuffling out of bed to see what his mom had gotten for him.
