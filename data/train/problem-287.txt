“I understand why. Yes, you frustrate the living hell out of me ninety-nine percent of the time, but I do understand why you do what you do. We can't all be geniuses and I know it must be a burden to know what you know and to be able, to have to, do what you do.”
For Mycroft, John surmised, it was just to ensure that the court was satisfied that Sherlock was dead so that Mycroft could put an end to this sordid chapter and close the book on any “errors of judgement” on his behalf. John considered the creation of a partnership between an MI6 agent and a psychopathic criminal ranked somewhat higher than an “error of judgement” and somewhat closer to an absolute fucking disaster. He was quite keen on putting that opinion to Mycroft in no uncertain terms, but Mycroft had been impossible to get a hold of in the days since Sherlock’s dea —

“Yes, but with this level of security and the amount of knowledge required to do it properly, he would have had to have some help. And that help, is most definitely a crime.”
Before Lestrade could answer, a message came through over the channel his radio was tuned to.  “Blood type confirmed. O negative.”
Him or the walls? He couldn’t be sure.

“You know it’s not that easy for me to just turn it all off,” Sherlock grumbled, albeit halfheartedly, titling his head back to rest his mouth against John's carotid artery.
He took the rings out of the box and set it off to the side. The two gleaming bands of gold settled comfortably into the curved palm of his hand and started warming instantly. He hadn't said it, he hadn't asked and now … A huff of breath escaped his lips. He didn’t suppose that it would have changed the course of events but … he could feel the weight of every minute that he hadn't spoken, the burden of every second that he had waited.

Placing his right hand on Sherlock's hip, John bent his head to nuzzle the thatch of dark curls surrounding Sherlocks already very interested cock.

John arrived at Speedy’s on foot at precisely the same time Mycroft's bespoke brogues stepped out of a dark Bentley and onto the pavement, umbrella in hand despite the sky being a bright clear blue with not a cloud in sight.
Sherlock paused in the process of tucking in his shirt tails and regarded him strangely. “Whatever do you mean?”

What Sherlock thought was that he was failing John, and miserably. He had absolutely no idea about what to say or do to comfort him - not his area at the best of times. But there was one thing that he could do, and that was take the focus off him.
The tickling was abruptly terminated though when John's phone pinged on the sink next to him. Spatula in one hand, he thumbed through the message with the other and upon reading, passed it to Sherlock.

younger than him, he had met her in rehab. Kind, attentive, she was the first PT aide assigned to him. He had probably not demonstrated the finest of personal or professional judgement in undertaking a sexual relationship with someone in a caregiving role, but then, he had been in no mood to care about ethics and consequences, having recently returned and still trying to process the loss of his army and medical career. It hadn’t lasted long, their relationship - it was never destined to. He had progressed through the program and they had drifted apart, she wisely seeking someone who had more to offer than a physically damaged, emotionally unavailable veteran with no foreseeable future ...
"Then, and even though I received a request late last night for the same directly from the Home Secretary," she glanced curiously at Mycroft, "I am not inclined to grant a closed inquest. I understand the desire to not have one’s family affairs aired before the world, however unless there is an issue of national security, I have no compelling reason to exclude the public. Now,” she turned back to Lestrade, “is there any other evidence that has come to light since this report was written?"
What had Watson missed?
They came to stand in front of the glass roofed control room directly under the walkway. “And of course, we also produce as well.” We extract our own oil from Rosa centifolia, Moroccan rose.” Sandrine nodded to a series of piped silver vessels taking up the entirety of the back wall.
Entering on the ground level saved him the considerable time it would have taken to traverse the scaffolded exoskeleton of the tower but it still left him with the not inconsiderable task of searching all the chambers and access corridors. Late in the day, with construction work having ceased, at least his efforts wouldn’t be complicated by the need to avoid (or tediously explain his presence to) any officious little project managers. He was however, still left with over a dozen floors to descend.
He had lost a lot of blood, a significant amount of blood.

“What the hell are you doing here?” Sherlock snarled.

“Why do you?” Sandrine returned.
Lestrade glanced towards John and back down at the table again. "It's Sherlock's."
A couple of deep thrusts later and John joined him, his head thrown back, gulping for air as stars of white exploded behind his eyelids and his grip on Sherlock’s softening cock slackened.
“So psychopath?”
Sherlock's eyes narrowed and he averted his gaze."I think you might need to calm down."
John waved his hand in acknowledgement and they shut the door behind them, sealing him in.
He paid particular attention to the rails on the frame and ran a bead of oil right down both sides. Putting the slide on, he locked it to the rear, flipped up the takedown lever and then moved the slide back and forth. Back and forth, the tawny oil spreading, moving freely within.

When he arrived at the lab, he found a number of Lestrade's people busily packing files back into boxes and picking an array of photographs up off the floor. From the doorway he caught the attention of the nearest officer. "Where's Lestrade?"
He had what he needed, it was time they left.
"Yes, now," John announced, sucking off him with a slurp, "but first."
He pushed himself up out of his chair and wandered into the kitchen, opening the fridge. Food? No, he wasn't hungry despite not having eaten since midday yesterday. And anyway, besides a couple of soggy tomatoes and half a tub of yoghurt on the top shelf, there wasn't really anything to eat. He deliberately tried not to look down lower to the crisper that still held the remnants of one of Molly’s gifts from the morgue, but failed miserably and he felt a knot catch in his throat.
Sherlock whimpered.

The precisely aimed barb found its target easily in an already wound up John who bit out, “I would if I knew where he was or how to get in contact with him!”
“Involved, yes,” John squeezed his eyes tightly shut before opening them again, he really wasn't sure he could discuss this any longer. “Look, sorry ...”
Moriarty flicked the paper back across the table and with a bored sigh. “So, the great Sherlock Holmes offed himself. Well, that’s more than a tad disappointing. I really thought that he had more in him. No stamina, those creative genius types. One bright spark and then,” he snapped his fingers, the sound cracking off the walls, “...they fizzle out. So, tell me,” he appeared to shiver with eagerness as he leaned across the table to Donovan to whisper, “how did he do it?”
On the other side of a (thankfully) uneventful flight back to London in which Sherlock had closed his eyes prior to takeoff and proceeded to ignore everyone and everything for the duration,
Lestrade put the paper down and Moriarty’s eyes dropped to the paper, running greedily over the typed script.

The stairs were narrow, worn through and beveled at the edges. His heels slipped off the ends.
Fuck Guerin. No one talked to John like that! Sherlock knew that John had a protective streak, but he wasn't aware of just how strong his own was until Guerin had started his condescending bullshit. And realizing that John had only been allowing it happen for the Work, for him, the resultant surge of lust had overwhelmed him.
background checks. That's why we recruited him.”
As he crossed the room, Sherlock studied John's body surreptitiously, not wanting to draw Guerin’s notice. He started to feel some blood course through his veins again as he caught the ever so slight slight rise and fall of John's chest.
Lestrade, sitting in the driver's seat, looked over as they pulled up and nodded in recognition. He took out his phone and made a call. A moment later a very soggy looking Sebastian came jogging back from his surveillance position. John waved them both over to the Jeep.
Upon his arrival at the court, John had been set upon by the gathered press who had descended on him like a flock of grubby vultures. The media had, once the news of Sherlock’s death had leaked its way out in the open, already had a field day with the story.
Moriarty had played a perfect game, and would end up destroying John completely, unless something caused a change.

Lestrade was many things; middle aged and slowing down around the edges (and somewhat in the middle as pointed out upon occasion by Sherlock), but there was one thing he definitely wasn't, and that was an idiot. And as a twenty-eight-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police the DI would know a man delighted to have an audience to play to when he saw one, but for the sake of whatever information could be gleaned, John was happy enough that he was willing to play along.

They remained that way for a while, Sherlock’s eyes closed, face being warmed by John’s strong, capable fingers until John’s stomach started rumbling loudly. “Sorry,” John admitted ruefully with a slight grin, it’s been a long night and I didn’t really eat much at dinner…”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and settled in. And teach John he did.
“Aside from the obvious?”
“Helleborus, the Winter Rose,” Sherlock revealed the flower set between her teeth.
John snatched his keys back off the plate. "Nope, but I'm going back to Barts now. If there's no footage of him leaving, then there's a chance he's still there."
They had returned to the living room and were seated low to the ground, around a small table, drinking coffee. The conversation during dinner never strayed far from the weather and memories of London (despite spending most of his time in a recluse-like state in this part of the world, it appeared that Guerin made frequent trips back to London). And although Guerin engaged John in a line or two of conversation, his attention never strayed far from Sherlock, seeking his opinion, sharing his thoughts and inching closer and closer with every word.
To his chagrin, John, the target of his statement, simply ignored him and went on eating.
As if to punctuate the unpleasantness of the situation, Donovan fell into step beside them and as Lestrade reached forward to unlock the interview room door, she leaned forward to hiss in John’s ear. “I told you one day we would be standing ‘round a body ...”

“We were celebrating. Sometimes it’s nice having someone else to clean up the mess,” Moriarty shrugged.

Nothing.
All of a sudden, the daze lifted and John was beset by a sea of black, blinding rage. Keeping his eyes fixed on Moran he tried to focus on what Lestrade was saying but he could feel the tiny hairs on the back of his neck prickle. As a thin film of sweat started to build at his hairline, John re-focused just in time to hear Lestrade finishing up with the same crushing words the coroner had just spoken being repeated. “.... A full jury inquest is being scheduled."
“This way.” Guerin’s tone (and the firearm he held) brokered no room for debate.
"Look, I shouldn't be talking to you at all …” Lestrade lowered his voice, “but, you should try and find him before we do. And John …”
Alone.
Read without inflection in Lestrade's easy Somerset-come-London lilt, the words spoken into the hushed hum of the brightly lit room seemed even more obscene than when John had first heard them on the recording, and he couldn't help but flinch.
“I. Do. Not. Need. Any. Help,” Sherlock managed to get out between gritted teeth.

For one tiny moment John was stunned into thinking that perhaps Sherlock was, for the first time, admitting to a personal flaw, but then he went on.
Fate then. Well not quite fate, but predetermination.
The voice got louder, closer, more cautious. "I think you need to see this, boss ..."
In the inky near dark of their bedroom, he could just make out the steady rise and fall of the ex-army doctor’s bare chest, head to the side, star-burst of scarred flesh at his shoulder exposed, unguarded. He envied John’s surety, a soldier’s faith in his skills and his weapon.

Already Sherlock was adrift in the depth of emotion of it all. And somehow, somehow John just knew, because he took his time, took his hand and led him over to the bed.
But now, the coal-burning relic was currently in the throes of a modern day revival. Spurned on by the insatiable demand for new residences in the heart of London, the structure that had remained largely unoccupied for the last 30 years, was undergoing a “regeneration” of sorts.
Sherlock opens his eyes into John's heart.
Truth be told, all warmth had been stolen as soon as Sherlock had told him to leave. Go where? Sherlock hadn't said. But the message was clear.

John scratched at the stubble that was beginning to itch as it came in under his chin and down his neck, busying himself with the task at hand. Eggs cracking, pan smeared with butter sizzling on the hob, he started running over the situation that they now found themselves in.
But one look at Sherlock and he knew that they wouldn't be returning to the comforts of home anytime soon.

Sherlock was a firm proponent of the belief that the only way to learn was by playing the game; win, lose, advance, retreat, things only mattered if there was something at risk. And just as John had been such a quick study of The Work, he showed an equally remarkable aptitude for learning The Game.
The side of Sherlock’s face curved into a slight smile.

Sherlock drew the rear passenger door open and fished around in his overnight bag. John watched as he drew out the container of leeches and bent to release them in the ditch alongside the road. Still without saying a word, he tossed the now empty container in the back, shut the passenger door and climbed into the driver seat. Sherlock silently turned the key in the engine, swinging the vehicle back out into the road. John glanced back one last time.

And whether it was the increased pace or the verbalised inducement, a couple of thrusts and pulls later, Sherlock's body stiffened as he cried out. Stomach muscles tensed as he came, ribbons of come covering both their chests and dripping in between John's fingers, as he stroked Sherlock's cock through the resultant tremors.

John considered the question and was a little surprised that it didn't bother him more; the topic of war, the prospect of death. He hadn't talked much about his service, wary perhaps of inadvertently summoning the demons that had plagued his dreams, and his life, before Baker Street. Sherlock had intuitively known not to ask, and John had been grateful for the space. But now, with some distance, a bit more perspective and being symptom-free for the last year, it didn't seem to bother him. Familiar territory, he reasoned. He was, after all, and forever would be, a soldier. Perhaps the demons had been banished forever.

His past two years keeps playing in the back of his head, stinging sharply and making his eyes well up with anger.
But Sherlock's voice is strangerly pitched, throat closed and hands tight and
Red mark.
Feel.
For Sherlock it's nothing but another note on the pentagram storming in his eardrums.
Sherlock didn't wait for him. He did not.
He sees what looks like syringes near his naked feet. Nedleless, dirty, broken, empty syringes. Used.
Let me know what you think!
for his kind of cases.» shakes his head, hands on hips, eyes on feet.
He failed one and it is written between his shoulder blades. Sorry, John. He tried to apologise to the voice but John got angry, so angry! Sherlock thought he was going to die there, in fucking Serbia, alone if even his Mind Palace's John left him.
«Oh! No dear, he was with such a nice lady. Sarah, was it? Been quite a long time now.» she puts a little tray on the kitchen table. She notices the little faltering of his pocker face. «Oh Sherlock, why don't you just tell him already?» his head snaps up, he feel the muscles in his neck strain a bit.
John's smile is too chary, too controlled. «You don't need to.»
Can he play the violin in this state?
John looks around the flat. It's a disaster. He can see where the younger man spent his days, blankets crumpled in a corner like a nest. There are shattered plates, mugs laying on the old parquet. Empty bottles of scotch. Syringes. He forces himself to think that it's not a physical representation of Sherlock's condition at the moment. Ruined. Messed up. Posisoned. Abandoned.
He felt like the he was the crime of the scene. He had to be careful around him, quiet and silent and so so careful. On their first case after Sherlock's return, John had no idea why but he felt the need to be as invisible as possible. Sherlock was strangely not rude, something tender taking the best of him in the way his gaze dropped on the floor and softened everytime it met John's.
But what comes next is scarier, because John not knowing was somehow comforting. If he doesn't know the details, he will miss the biggest one.
Morphine or cocaine?
«Sorry, sorry I am so sorry I am sorry John please forgive me- » it goes on and on without rest, lips barely opening to let the litany slip out.
Tap. No messages.
Alert. Is John hurt? Crumpled shirt. Folds on trousers in random places. Unstyled hair.
Does he know? Does he know how bad it was?
Stop, Sherlock.
«No.» which is not entirely a lie, because he didn't try. He failed from the start.
, losing control. He can't afford losing control now. «No point in denying it.»
Maybe now he is a bit sad. A lot is wrong with him, Mycroft never fails to remind him. He's not actually sure if he cares or not, but it's not the main problem right now.
«John.»
He needs to get up.
It might be embarassment given the fact that he just discovered John's interest for his sexuality, which might imply that he has some kind of-

away. Muscles realx, the corners of his mouth lift up slightly, his mind is clear.
«Morphine or cocaine?»
How he will be able help with nightmares when most nights he is knocked off by pills and alchool.
John's face though. It's turning of a deep red, his lips trembling slightly. Anger? Embarassment?
«It's not a game! It's a case. » his pocker face sucks, he reads it in John's incredolous eyes.
He refrained from taking something to remind him of Sherlock. He almost took that creepy skull off the fireplace. He considered taking one of those weird petri dishes with some kind of hair or dust or

He felt trapped in a nightmare, brought back in a flashback and held stuck on his feet.

Are these low and highs of the drugs mix? Is this Sherlock not being able to traduce his unstoppable train of thoughts?

Sherlock followed reluctantly (and for the time being, obediently) as Guerin directed him out the door. However, just before he exited, and out of the line of sight of Guerin, Sherlock removed one of the plates from his pocket and dropped it onto the toe of his shoe, the leather muffling its fall, before easing it to the ground. He slid it into place, and hoped his trust was not misplaced as he proceeded to walk in front of Guerin, not permitting himself to look back.
“Absolutely,” John muttered under his breath.

“Oi, I'm right here remember!”
And as John, still struggling within the grip of the officer, watched Moran walk away, a plan began to form in his mind. A plan borne of darkness, despair and loss.

‘So, what brings you to this neck of the woods, Greg?” John finally asked around a mouthful of food.
"Please."
“Yes, Mrs Hudson,” he tried to move around her but she was directly in his path.
“So, just to make sure we are all on the same page,” Lestrade began. “You understand that you are

“Gentlemen, it has been a pleasure dining with you this evening, but it is late and I must be making my way back to my apartment.” Guerin moved to stand up, and in an act of uncharacteristic gracelessness, stumbled slightly and reached for Sherlock’s knees to steady himself. “Very sorry.”
considered suspects in this case, Detective Inspector?”
He had already been frisked once when he arrived by the officer in charge, and now he was getting a secondary pat down by Donovan. She knew about his gun; probably thought he brought it with him, or that he had thought about bringing it with him. If she did, she would have been right. He had left it at home though, in the side table. She was thorough. Though if she had registered the two metal bands at the bottom of his trouser pocket, she didn’t mention it, just nodded her head to the officer who would be accompanying him that he was all clear.
His eyes narrowed further when the next message appeared; a wav file.
Sherlock took a few mouthfuls of his breakfast and then pushed the rest about his plate, trying to shut out the noise of John and Lestrade’s inane chatter about the abundance of sunshine, the lack of rain and all manner of other boring observations on the current state of the environment.
Closing the fridge door, the clock on the wall, ticking into the quiet, came into view. 6pm - too early for bed, especially since he had slept practically the entire day … but not too early for a drink? His inner voice pointed out that it wasn't such a good idea. Snagging a bottle of cheap whiskey from behind the mugs, he ignored it.
In contrast to the house they had left, the office was as vacant as the surrounding land. A desk, a few chairs and a rather bedraggled looking plant sat in the corner. No artwork, no personal Items, nothing to provide any insight into the woman who worked there, who effectively ran Guerin’s entire operation.
“Leave … leave here, now? Or leave … us?”
@johnlocklover221/@Dovahlock221 on AO3 and BakerEdits on YouTube, I know I have said it before, but I do hope you know how fundamentally important you were in the shaping of A Dead Man's Money. From the moment you gave me the genesis of the fic when I asked you for a suggestion of a track that would represent Sherlock and Moriarty's battle, to the playlist you made that helped shape each and every chapter. This fic would not be anything without your lyrical interpretation. You have an absolute gift. And whether you make it your career or it remains a treasured hobby, what you have is extraordinary 😘
“Couldn't really, things got a bit tied up, if you know what I mean?”
Mycroft pursed his lips and straightened his tie. “Doctor Watson, do you think that there was anything that Sherlock wouldn't have done to keep you out of danger? To “save John Watson” - he would have given his life.”

"It's a sailor, actually," John's smile broadened into a wide grin, "but well, yes, to all of the above, you annoyingly brilliant git."
Safe.
An irresistible pull; the pressure of John’s palms increased as he stroked up towards his pecs, smoothing their way across his chest and nipples up to the junction of his neck
Lestrade ignored the questions. "How did he seem? Did he mention where he was going?"
John nodded. They made their way to the secluded garden nestled away behind the hospital church of St Bartholomew the Lesser and took up a seat together on one of the crimson benches beneath the stained glass arches. Setting the second cup down on the sandstone flagging, John looked up towards the overcast sky. For the first time in seemingly forever (though it had probably only been a week), the sun was trying to make an appearance.
«I have no idea where Sherlock spent the past two years, but i know where i have been. Honestly, I don't think this is a conversation we should hav- »
This is tiring. It feels like breathing water. Licking mud from the corners of the basement because it was all he could get in there. He wishes he could just tell John.
Is John leaving? Why is John drinking again? Why Mary? Why him? What is happening? Why is it happening?
Heels on cracking steps, Mrs Hudson coming upstairs. «John, dear? What's going on?» consonant so loud they feels like chainsaw and Sherlock wants to cry out.
Feet pushing the blankets away, duvet pooling at the end of the bed. What is it?
«I am sorry.» he feels the need to scrub his hands with hot water and dish soap.
«I know you don't, Sherlock. It's not what I meant. » john. John? He talked his memories out loud.
poisons.
Dainty hand guides the keys to the door, trembling fingers missing the opening. It takes three times for him to get the key in, shaky breathes of frustration and furrowed brows giving away the struggle and making the point of hiding it useless.
«I did. I did want to die. Put a gun in my mouth. Thought i would be brave enough. Guess I am not.» he smiles at the floor, sniffles again. This is his defense mode, short answers, brick wall between them. A barricade. A trench. He's hurting.
Breathe.
Mycroft puts the small notebook back in his hidden poket, he looks at John with a fake smile plastered on his lips. «My brother is a long term addict, Doctor. His habits have been way worse than this.»
but this is not what Sherlock wants and needs! Can't John understand?
He's keeping up a cold facade, red rimmed eyes giving away the mess going on behind his lids. But he's successfully shutting up, tongue tied and brain silent. He can do this for John, he can calm down. It's alright. He's fine.
He's so lost, even more lost now that Molly left his side to put a body is its cell leaving him to the complete mercy of John.
The raw sound of knuckles hitting on bones becomes unbearable for John, his own teeth gritting against each other.

Restless. His limbs can't stop trashing. Eyes shut, crinkles between his brows and around his eyes. Fingers tugging curls, hair pulling to the point of popping vessesl under the thick skin of his skull.
«So...is that a yes or-?»
he's on the bed, head sunk in his thin abused arms and hands gripping tightly the dark locks of dirty hair. Something in the air is wrong, terribly tense.
When he went to bed that night and he looked at her, his chest collapsed under the weight of guilt. Because he could stand Sherlock being dead, he was about to get on with his own life to move on. He could live knowing he was dead. But he couldn't possibily bear the existance of Sherlock without it gravitating around him.
He didn't. He sits up and walks past John and into the kitchen. Fridge open, eyeballs out. Bin open, eyeballs in. He turns to John, arms open and a petty expression playing on the tight curve of his lips.
They moved in togheter at some point. She got him out of that biological hazard he called “home”. She made sure he ate and drank enough. She woke him up at 3am when the screaming started. She picked up the pieces at 9pm when he returned home late, a text anticipating him saying he was sorry and she just knew he gave the wrong address to the driver.
«I don't know. Just- » index and thumb pinch the bridge of his nose, the pressure behind his eyes is getting unsustainable. «Can you give me space? I need air!»
Once Mycroft tried to stop his hands from hitting himself, but Sherlock ended up hitting his older brother in the moment.
And he started preferring the stinging company of needles, the consuming friendship of improvised tourniquets. And those blue and purple spots looked like they earned their place, like they belonged there like bruises from torture and stitches blindly applied. He deserved it, both the exciting highs and the suicidal downhills of the aftermath.
he felt so stupid. He gave up so easily and so
Mycroft is holding him, fingers digging in his skin like burning sticks between his ribs. He sees the corner of the kitchen table, rest of the room dipped in black. Things clink knocking over each other, recipients rolling off the table and shattering on the floor. He tries to reach out, but his movements are slow and delayed and his hands reaches for a glass that's already shards.
«Sherlock, it's a nightmare! I am here, it's all fine!» tentative touches try to get a firm hold of those pale hands, he tries and tries to make him stop. «Sherlock, you are safe! You're home!» he holds him by the wrists, arms stretched in front of his trashing body.
Because it stings a bit, the way John is vomiting his last words on him, balling up his fists with anger. «You haven't talked to me for the whole week, you are not even looking at m-LOOK AT ME SHERLOCK!»

, you could have helped him.»
john's head snaps up towards the door, Mycroft standing there a bit pale, apologetic smile and sad eyes and all of those things he never usually wear on his poker face.
John watches him as he exits the kitchen with the corner of his eyes, head not lifting, chin tucked against his chest. He needs to clear his throat once,
He moved out. More than a year ago. It took him months to get himself to open Sherlock's bedroom and another couple of weeks to get inside. It took seven months for his thing to be safe and secure in a couple of cardboard boxes. Two more months for him to actually move out. For the first weeks he kept coming back at 221B after work, keys wouldn't fit in the keyhole and he would hiss profanities under his breath, tears threatening to escape. He couldn't sleep, spent night after night staring at the foreign ceiling; changing side because the bed felt like concrete.
«Why the hell the neighbor, Sherlock? Would you try explain? I have to report facts you know, it's supposed to be my-»
And at some point Sherlock gave up. He saw John's fists balling up, the thin layer of sweat covering his upper lip. The little head tilt.
Hide like when he was 13 and his classmates were teasing him over his shaking leg and flapping hand.
«For f-» stops, deep sigh, puff of air out, lungs shut «Sherlock!» angry steps.
Pause.
John is wearing a new jumper. The cloth looks like it feels awful. Rough. His fingertips itch.
«Mrs Hudson, is Sherlock using again?» he asks without looking at her, brains still trying to process what he's seeing.
Relax, he should relax. But John's cologne is too strong. And Mycroft keeps a hand on his right shoulder but Sherlock can't see him becausee
A loud cry of pain makes both their heads jerk towards the hallway. Then silence. Complete silence. Dead silence. Not a single breathe, not a cracking step. The landlady's shaky index points towards Sherlock's bedroom.
Alert, brain alerted, heart runs, eyes open. «John, are you hurt?» what even.
It's tormenting and it's crippling and he
«Aren't you hungry, John?» he doesn't look at him, he traced a safety line for his eyes, just about above John's lips so that he can see his reactions without having to deal with John's gaze.
Sherlock's eyes flicker on their direction, brows knitted together. He knows they are talking about him. Lestrade's face says it all. John looks like he just discovered the heart is not flat.
«John John John- »
Alone.
This is desperation.
«Shut the fuck up, Sherlock.» he looks hysterical. He's smiling, but it feels like his body is not responding correctely to his emotions. He's fuming, struggling to keep the situation cool and

«John, he doesn't know.»
mind goes blank
What is this? Is it useful? Is it helpful? Does it need it in his life?
Doors are meant to be opened but so are hearts and Sherlock is not quite sure he's ready for that.
John's heart clench tightly in his chest, his own pulse clear in his ear, drumming loudly. «Sherlock... » he can see droplets of blood and spit landing on the detective's feet. Bile is reaching the back of is throat.
He is taking it off, but the tingling sensation won't leave Sherlock's brain.
He can't stop this, he can't overcome this. He need to hide.
«Sarah bought it for me! What's wrong? Is it the problem?» confusion. John is confused, but irritation lingers in his questions.
Water closed. He slips in the bathtub, under the water, lower part of his face under the surface. Deep water. Deep deep water.
He pissed the bed once. He burnt the sheets. Mrs Hudson came rushing up the stairs, hand on her bad hip, worrying the life out of her. It was an experiment, he said.
«So,» Sherlock's eyes leave John's, the direct contact agonizingly wearisome. «Is it true? I am not judging you. It's fine.»
John never stays anymore. Since Sherlock came back, he never stays.
He does feel a bit affronted at that. Does John think he can't make sandwiches? Because he can. He surely can. He never does, that's the thing. He's never been in need for a sandwich. Mostly because he doesn't eat a thing for days apart from tea, but also Mrs Hudson is always quick to bring a plate of something she cooked fresh and handmade. So, no need to prepare a sandwich.
«Sherlock, it's becoming a bit scary now. Will you look at me? Did you take anything?» trained hands make their way to his left wrist, skilled fingers press on his pulse.
the hallway is spinning, tunnel vision disorienting his steps, hand following the path of the walls
«Yeah, yeah! I'm-I'm fine. I'm great. Just- late for work! Work. I have to take a shower.» he turns his head towards the bathroom door, the collar of his shirt revealing more skin of John's neck.
He can't feel his body starting to

Of course this is not the first time Sherlock's been out of tits on drugs. But it's confusing and frustrating and infuriating now. Because the reality of things hits him hard in the face and he realises.
Deep sigh, eyes closed, fingers pinch the bridge of his nose. «Sorry, I am...sorry.» John remembers last time he shouted and the way Sherlock flinched and shut down. «Look, don't worry. I just wanted to know, because you're my friend and I thought you liked my girlfriend and Lestrade- »
«Honestly, your brain might be the smartest of this planet, but you are incredibily dense.» he pinches the bridge og his nose, breathing deep and a bit too hard for it to have a calming effect. «It never occurred your brilliant mind that
The detective's words are calm and light and John's face goes red with shame. Then the colour washes away, capillaries drained out and blood flowing back to the growing abashment knot in his stomach.

Brows raised, mouth surprided. Sherlock hands rips away from his, hides behind the wooden desk and forms a fist.
«Yeah, but just to remind you I actually have a job. I am a doctor, people need me. I can't just skip a day.» Slightly hurried tone, he'd love to stay home. Previous night performance tired him out.

«Sherlock, it's alright. I am here, it's all fine.»
«That's not what I meant. Sherlock, we need to have this conversation now.»

John didn't expect Sherlock to ever return home, just like he never thought himself to come back from war.

«I know you, Sherlock. You shouldn't hide it, it's not working anyway.»
«Sherlock!» a pair of strong arms is reaching for him, holding him up by his weak shoulders.
John moved on. That's it. John moved on while Sherlock did not.
But Sherlock is rolling frantically in his sheets, fingernails scratching at his neck, red marks angry and frantic movements making the detective all but peacefully sleeping. His eyes are closed, shut but are moving convulsively under the thin lids.
«What is this even about, Sherlock?» Anger. Eyes open, pupils alert. Brows furrowed, lips tight. Shoulders tense. Fists tight. Definitely anger.
He didn't
A pause. He scratches his forehead, misures the weight of his words. He wants to rip his scalp apart and leave the room permanently, bleeding all over the kitchen floor.
«Asperger's.» his palm feels rough on his face as he wipes the sweat off the skin. «Stop wondering, John. Your brain can't possibly take it.»
The muscles in his back loosen a little, a sudden lump melts in his sore throat and a become hot tingling feeling in his burning eyes.
«Thank you for telling me. I am sorry, you're fine now.» He misses John pained face, but clearly detects the hurt in his voice. He feels the hands starting to ache from the spasm, a thin coat of something -blood?- cracking with every gesture. «What did I do» he's slurring out words, tongue tired.
friends, Sally Donovan.  I knew what you were 30 seconds after I met you in Brixton.
“It’s fine.  Not much more than a scratch, really.  Hurt like bloody hell last night, but it’s fine.” She didn’t jump at his touch – casual touching had been part of their friendship since early days – but if her heart beat a bit faster at the contact than it used to have done, Joanna did her best to ignore it.  She was still angry with him, after all, wasn’t shea?
“I’m going to go,” Mary said to John.  “Give you two the chance to talk alone.”  She pulled her iPhone from her coat pocket.  “It’s half six, now.  W - would you consider giving me your decision by ten?”
“Travel plans?
Sarah.
“Living together and loving together … or at least loving you, John,” Mary finished his thought.  Sherlock wasn’t the only one who understood John’s thinking.
terror strike, but he kept that to himself.  He had more important issues that he needed addressed.  “And what about Joanna Watson?”
“How is your arm?” Sherlock asked, reaching across the table to brush a finger against the bandage that peeked out from beneath the sleeve of her pale pink jumper.
“I am quite skilled at hand-to-hand combat, John, but it is likely that sooner or later I will run into an altercation that I will be unable to fully control myself.  A trusted companion with military experience who knows his way around close combat situations could prove essential to my survival and that of my work,” he acknowledged before he took another sip of his tea.
Sherlock’s intimate encounters with other people were rather limited and had always been more experimental than sentimental. He detested labels, but society would likely classify him as bisexual.  When he could be bothered with physical intimacy, it was the person who attracted him not the genitalia.  Nevertheless, four of the five assignations Sherlock had experienced had been with men. They were familiar and Sherlock was as comfortable with them as he could be with anyone – which was barely – but there was something about Joanna that pushed the hated awkwardness and anxiety to the fringes of his mind and left him as relaxed and content as he had any right being.
You were right.  Bloody wall had it coming.
“I hurt you, though,” Sherlock said, settling back in his chair, pulling his hand from hers.
I hate what you did!  I hate that you lost faith in yourself.  I hate that you lost faith in me.  Why couldn’t you have just trusted me for a little bit longer? We would have figured it out.  You would have. I believed in you then. I believe in you still.
Her deep blue eyes could shift from warm to inscrutable to malicious in the span of three heartbeats.  Her smile was often quick and affectionate yet could easily slide into a sigil of violence to come.  Her long hair was thick and just the right shade of blonde for her complexion, and more than once Sherlock had struggled to keep his heartbeat regulated when its loose curls hung about her shoulders ‘just so.’ Joanna wasn’t classically beautiful, her features were just a bit too asymmetrical to be so, but she was lovely in a way that garnered far more attention that Sherlock was really comfortable with, particularly where many of the Yarders – male and female – were concerned.
? No.  But enemy fire doesn’t discriminate gender.” Reese leaned his forearms against the low wall that separated the gym from the observation area and gestured to the doctor who was still sparring with The Tree. “She’d been on patrol when the unit my mates were in took heavy fire a couple of klicks away.  Her boys kept the enemy pinned down while she and Murray – that’s her nurse; bloody good sod, that man! – pulled Geoff and Mick out by their bootstraps as I hear it. She literally kept Mick from bleeding out by keepin’ her finger shoved down the bullet hole in ‘is neck until they evaced back to Bastion and got ‘im into surgery.”
Sherlock pulled the tobacco pouch from her fingers and set it aside, pressing the contents of his hand into hers. “If Mycroft knew I had this, he would never let me live it down, I’m afraid.  He’d be right to do so, too.  This is the epitome of sentiment.  Foolishness, really. And though I have tried, I’ve never been able to part with it.”
“soldier.”  The two were as intertwined within his nature as were honeysuckle with hazel – neither part surviving without the other.
“Until tonight.”
“Right.  So … itinerant medical examiner and sounding board.”  John scratched his temple and pursed his lips.  Sherlock continued to avoid what, to John, was the most serious issue.  “Umm … do you intend to always scuttle off alone after the murderer like you did this evening?  Because I don’t fancy the idea of running all over London trying to save your bloody arse when I have no idea where it is you’ve actually
slowly, with the soothing voice acting as his anchor, John pulled himself free of his panic.
detective,” she corrected absently and took a sip of the scotch.
Joanna didn’t bother asking him if he were sure. He had voiced his opinion. End stop.   “Okay, scoot closer to me.  I’d rather not throw my back out.”  Sherlock complied, settling against the front of the sofa between Joanna’s legs. She adjusted the bath towel she had wrapped around shoulders then angled Sherlock’s head down so that his chin was resting against his chest and set to work.
“You weren’t alone.  Lestrade said that there were dozens of people planning to attend.”
“Sherlock?” Joanna prompted, drawing his attention back to the situation – uh, feelings! – at hand.
She wouldn’t want to talk about it. She rarely did, and that was fine with Sherlock because his attempts at supportive platitudes came across as hollow – which they were – and generally only served to deepen her sullen mood into outright anger.
“And option four?”
of you.  I tried to tell you how I felt, how excited I was, but you had already shut down … shut me out.  You wouldn’t listen to anyt – ”
“Then there was the smell of sex … clinging to your skin like the lover who left it there.”  Mary sighed.  “I know what you smell like, John. I know what
!” Sherlock insisted, but the label held firm.
Sherlock muttered something about doctors and horrifying patients then pulled his chair closer, his knees pressed up on either side of hers.  His foot then curled around the leg of the chair to hold it, and her, in place.  Resigned to her fate, Joanna scooted to the edge of her chair to make things a bit easier for him and tried not to flinch each time Sherlock swabbed her wounds.
“Of course you did.”
“Ta very much for that.”
But he had Virgil.
The old man snorted derisively.  “Ahh, lass.  Ye cut me to the quick.  Ye know yer Jamie better than that, me thinks.”  Not even trying to hide his interest, the he leaned a bit further across the bar to get a better view of the men.  “So ... that’s Himself, then?  Returned from the dead.  If that’s not a turn up …” Jamie harrumphed in consideration before turning his attention back to the dirty glasses he had been cleaning.  “Bit more of o’ a posh air ‘bout him than I expected from a private detective.“
“Dr Watson is currently meeting with her physician, but I do imagine they’ll be done soon,” Mycroft said hastily, ready to move on before his mother began sharing horrifying stories from his childhood. “In the meantime, may I introduce Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade of New Scotland Yard? Detective Inspector, my parents, Violet and Siger Holmes.”

ruining the ‘high-functioning sociopath’ look you’re going for, ” John said with a wicked grin.
“You’ve already figured out that I’m more than a bit broken.  Deduced that in the first five minutes, I’d imagine.  So, opening up to people.  It’s hard. Haven’t had much success with it in the past.”
“I do, however, retain the right to reassess the situation should the need arise.”
“Oh, I assure you, Dr Watson will be fully informed about all of her options, and will be able to make the appropriate choice for herself given the circumstances. Though I will admit to taking some liberties in order to – how shall we call it? – ‘level the battlefield.’”
Joanna had one of the most expressive faces Sherlock had ever seen.  Shock. Anger. Amusement. Distain. Affection.  Sherlock knew and recognized them all.  He had also been impressed by her ability to school her expression into an enigmatic mask that rivaled his own which, according to Lestrade, made her hell to play against in poker.  But
later.  “Joanna?”
He wasn’t quite sure why he felt the compulsion to protect this man he barely knew, but the pull on his conscience was undeniable.
for a living!”
“Sherlock …”
“Well, that’s sure to help, then,” Jo replied dryly. Sherlock grunted and fluttered his hand at her, dismissive of her sarcasm, and began to read by the light that filtered in from the hallway.
John’s groan registered as either one of disgrace or arousal; Mary was guessing the former but would never rule out the latter.
Sherlock raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Why are you apologizing to me?”
Sherlock glanced quickly at the check that was delivered to their table, pulled 30 quid from his wallet and handed it with a polite smile to Mrs. Tang before John could protest.
. I don’t buy that sociopath nonsense and never have.”  Joanna’s look and finger were equally pointed when Sherlock tried to protest. “My emotions … well, some I have no trouble expressing – ”
“I was never in any real danger, John,” Sherlock said.  He turned his attention to the small plates of dim sum scattered between them.  Egg roll or
“I think maybe I’ll just drop by.”
have your tells.”  Mary was tempted to trace the edge of his coat collar, but flexed her fingers and dropped her hand to her side instead.  He didn’t much care for physical contact initiated by others, and she always tried to respect Sherlock’s boundaries.
“The new obstetrician, Dr Lannister.” Mycroft settled himself into a comfortable chair and indicated that Lestrade should do the same. “As you know, Joanna is responding well to treatment, and the doctors are comfortable in discharging her two days hence.  However, she is still in a rather delicate position where the Hyperemesis Gravidarum is concerned. Apparently it would be very easy for the morning sickness to get out of control again.  Dr Watson will need looking out for until the danger is well past for her and the child.”
“No it isn’t,” Sherlock scoffed as though Mycroft’s suggestion was the most ridiculous he had heard since leaving London. Of course Joanne would welcome him. It’s what he had been planning on for two years.  “Now … where is it?”
“No caffeine.  Not good for you or ‘Mini-lock’ in there.  I’ll get you green next time.”
Yeah, right.  Concussion.  John opened his eyes and was met by Sherlock’s close, gray stare as he evaluated his condition. John’s breath caught in his chest at the unexpected nearness of the man.
“Oh, do shut up,” Mycroft muttered in response.
“It’s
your doctor at home.”
Joanna didn’t blush at the not-so-subtle reminder of what landed her in hospital to begin with.  Might as well own the mistake.  “No, it wouldn’t.”
“I’ll be fine.  I’ll take care of it myself.  Just drop me in my chair, and I’ll – ” John’s voice trailed off as Sherlock’s searching fingers found the switch and the room was bathed in light.  “Oh, my God …”
“Sherlock.  I’m not moving out.”
“Gods no, Joanna!  Why would you even think that?  I meant the idea of a ‘mini-Sherlock’ speaking from the womb. Seen things like that at the cinema. Unnerving as hell.” Greg thought for a moment, and then continued.  “Odd as it sounds, knowing that you’re having Sherlock’s kid is about the only thing that seems right anymore.”
“Cold.”  Sherlock sat in his chair in front of the window but didn’t look up from the file in his hand, the very model of an agreement fulfilling flat mate.
“Just fine, Detective Inspector Lestrade. Sergeant Donovan and I were having a little discussion about boundaries.  She seems to think they aren’t needed whereas I am certain they are.” Joanna gave Donovan’s arm another twitch upward to reinforce her point before letting her go. Donovan slumped into the wall as Jo nodded her farewell to Greg and Sherlock and left the shop without a second glance.
You would be disappointed in me, Greg said.
says much – but whatever he
of you had done, there would have been a lot less pain all ‘round these last several days, and I wouldn’t be in the position to try to fix this bloody awful mess.  I don’t expect Sherlock to understand the situation; he’s ignorant of the conversations we’ve had in the past, but
“Detective Inspector, if you would be so kind as to handle the initial introductions between Dr Watson and my parents?” Mycroft asked. “Mummy, Father, I will join you shortly once I’ve had the opportunity to talk with Dr Lannister about Joanna’s progress."
!  B–bleeding …?”
Sherlock reflects upon not so ancient history; Joanna untangles a complicated situation that leads to a new beginning; Greg serves as the perfect sounding board.
John turned back from the window, and the detective noted the change in the man’s eyes: blue flame and dread.
John sat there for several minutes, debating whether he should follow Sherlock or Sherlock’s instructions.  The events of the evening had hit his friend in a way he was not expecting and Sherlock was having difficulty processing them.  That much was clear.  What was puzzling was
Sherlock blinked owlishly as though he hadn’t anticipated this question and needed to suss out his answer before replying. Several long moments passed between them, but she knew he’d answer when he was ready.
That had been three days ago, and the flatmates still had yet to resolve their issues.  The serial killings were in large part responsible for that, however.  The PBR killer was escalating, and Sherlock was completely focused on the case, which was as it should be.  That didn’t mean, however, that she was going to just roll over and pretend that nothing had happened between them.  If she did, then it was only a matter of time before they found themselves in exactly the same situation.
know?”
Sherlock shifted in his chair, sipped his wine, and looked everywhere but at the strangely neutral expression on Joanna’s face. The mould experiment on top of the casement of the kitchen window seemed to be progressing.  He wondered if the ones he had stashed down in 221C were faring as well.
“Deduced that, did you?”
The fifth attempt was interrupted by a minor explosion in the kitchen; Sherlock had completely forgotten about the octopus tentacles.  He’d need to start again, and they’d need new pressure cooker.  Joanna would not be pleased.
“I can live with that, considering,” Joanna said, her voice thoughtful.
when I’m asleep.  Why is it, then, that you didn’t sleep more than you did?  You feel, Sherlock.  I know you do. Probably more deeply than anyone I’ve ever known.  You just struggle with interpreting the emotions.  I’d like to think I’ve helped you with that a bit.  Maybe?
“It’ll be okay, Jo.”  Her next words – ones Greg never thought he would hear the stalwart soldier say – ripped him apart.
2.  This has not been betaed or Brit-picked, so all errors are my own.  Hopefully, there aren't too many of them.
“John,” Sherlock’s voice was so quiet that John nearly missed it.  The doctor turned on the tread.  He was now eye to eye with the much taller man.  Sherlock rested his hand on top of the post, clenching the decorative knob with his fingers as he looked at the other man.  There was much he wanted to say, but the words were more cumbersome than fluid for once.  Simpler was better, he decided.  “Thank you, John.  Thank you for saving my life tonight.”
John took Sherlock’s silence as acquiescence and his raised eyebrow as the unspoken request.  “It was my grandmother, actually.  She raised us after our mother died.”  The eyebrow crept higher.  “Da had run off a few years prior,” John explained, his tone indicating that Sherlock would get no further information on
“Looks like you’ve been busy,” Joanna said as she reached the door to their flat.  She gestured at the mess of papers that lay scattered on every available surface in the sitting room, dropped her rucksack on the floor by the sofa, and hooked her coat on its peg.  “Caught a new case, then? Hot or cold?”
While the untrained eye would only notice that the room had been tossed, due to his months as Sherlock’s colleague, John’s eye was no longer
he did,” Greg replied.
Keys had been exchanged for convenience sake, but Sherlock had quickly learned that coming unannounced into their flat late at night and barging into John and Mary’s bedroom without knocking was more than a bit not good.
“As is Doctor Watson, then?”
“I’m not going to run, Sherlock.  It’s not who I am, and do you really think there’s
Sherlock tried to puzzle out her implication, brow wrinkling in confusion.  He watched mutely as Joanna walked to the door, slipped on her coat, hitched her rucksack over her shoulder, and turned toward the stairs.
getting this information,” Anthea interrupted, indicating the numerous folders she held in her hands.  “All the chatter, all the traffic concurs there’s going to be a terror strike on London – a big one.”
Mycroft nodded and followed suit. “I do, indeed.”
The young officer popped into the driver’s seat and within moments, they were off.
“Not for Doc.  Most ‘o that she came in with courtesy of the Army.  She’s bloody good, though.  ‘Specially for her size.  Keep tryin’ to convince her to go traditional and compete. She’d clean up in competition, but keeps sayin’ that’s not why she’s doin’ this,” Reese’s sigh was affected rather than truly dismayed.  “Has this mad genius of a flat mate that she has to keep from gettin’ killed by criminals and psychopaths all the time, apparently.  Wouldn’t know ‘im, would you?”
better, then I will.”
Joanna studied the concerned expression on Greg’s face carefully.   He was worrying the inside of his cheek with his teeth.  Hiding something.  Something … not good?   Turning her head, she observed a similar expression – though one wholly Mycroftian – on the face of The British Government.
The doctor barely noticed when Sherlock tucked his shoulder under John’s left arm and all but carried him through the kitchen and down the short hall to his bedroom where he sat John down gently on the bed.  “Stay right there,” Sherlock said and then left the room.
“Tell me about it tomorrow. Long day at A&E, so I’m all in …” Joanna said waving away his words as she hobbled off, dodging still more piles of photos and files on her way to the kitchen.
She leaned into his touch, savouring it, knowing full well that it might be the last time she felt the press of his skin to hers.  “To be happy … all of us, but what that ultimately looks like will depend on the decision the two of you make tonight.”
“Felicitations, Doctor Watson! It’s of course unsettling that such a dangerous and intractable form of morning sickness must temper your good news, but as Detective Inspector Lestrade has indicated, you
“Two concussions in less than a week would tend to make things a bit fuzzy, I’d imagine.”  The condescending tone that Sherlock usually took when discussing a person’s intelligence or ability to think objectively was blissfully absent.
“Sherlock’s always been something of a force of nature,” Lestrade said by way of greeting, lifting the blue tape that stretched between the flashing lights of two panda cars and gesturing Mary to the other side.  “Together they’re unstoppable.”
No response.  Joanna returned to the sitting room where Sherlock was completely engrossed in a pair of files, eyes flitting from one set of data to the other.
Sherlock counted John as a friend, perhaps his only friend, but was such a response typical of friendship?  Sadly, the result of Sherlock’s analysis was unsettlingly inconclusive.  There just wasn’t enough comparative data.
- Dante Alighieri,
An ancient yet familiar rumbling from within the wall pulled Sherlock’s attention back to the present.  The boiler had decided to surrender its treasure.  Pushing thoughts of “what could have happened” to the back of his mind – utterly pointless they were, really – Sherlock took up the ceramic bowl he had brought in from the kitchen.  He had his blogger to patch up.
If he levelled with himself, the days she had been out of the flat had been the longest of Sherlock’s life. He had attempted to bury his anxiety in experiments and cold cases, but nothing had worked. Certainly not the snide texts from Mycroft. Nothing had filled the emptiness Sherlock felt every time he thought of her.  He began to despair of her return, and Sherlock had
While Sherlock brooded in his chair, Joanna popped off to the chemists ‘round the corner, leaving the clippers Mrs Hudson’s secure care, to get what she needed to save Sherlock’s crowning glory.
“Sentiment,” Joanna scoffed.  “Not really your area.”  She immediately regretted letting her temper get the best of her. Sherlock jerked up from where he was bent over the corpse, and she was able to catch a glimpse of hurt and guilt in his eyes before they iced over with his traditional professional detachment.
During the relative silence of the cab ride home – punctuated occasionally by John’s grunts of pain as the full extent of his injuries began to manifest themselves– Sherlock attempted to deduce why he had reacted so viscerally to John’s abduction.
“It’s all fine, Sherlock,” Joanna assured him. She took another sip of her wine, and snagged a piece of the mellow, rich cheese from the platter. “Of the two, I’m pretty sure that it will be
“Two hundred and forty varieties.”
I am still looking for someone to beta and/or brit pick this tale.  A beta would be especially helpful as I have so many ideas for the various chapters that I sometimes don't know whether I'm coming or going.  :)
Noting her distress, Greg slid closer to the edge of the bench.  He took her cup, set it on ground next to them, and rested his hand on the arm of her wheelchair in a silent gesture of support that made no demands in return.
Okay fine.  Yes, I did it to get her out of my hair for a while, but she appreciated the gesture, so what does it matter?  The fact that her cruise is at the same time that Greg is tied up at the Yard with the first round of his reinstatement hearings is just coincidence.
He hummed in response.
Though he detested theorizing until all the data was available to him, Sherlock knew that Joanna would always be a source of endless data.  Therefore, Sherlock was left with the following conclusions:
The detective sank regally into John’s chair; his penetrating gray eyes had grown even more so; his tone was icy.  “Pray continue, Captain Watson.”
“I wasn’t worried.”  Sherlock deflected.
John sighed and dropped his chin to his chest.  “Bloody embarrassing,” he whispered.  “I’m sorry.”
“Turn it off!  Beating just fine.  Don’t broadcast it.” Joanna demanded, though it was more of a dry-throated murmur than her commanding Army voice. Nonetheless, there was bit of shuffling at her side, a brief rattle, and then blissful silence.
As Sherlock worked, the open collar of his silk shirt shifted and John noticed the dark bruises and swelling coming up around Sherlock’s neck where Soo Lin’s brother had nearly strangled him with the silk sash.  “You’ll want to put some ice those soon,” John said, indicating the welts.  “And take some paracetamol.”
I’m going to be sick.

to hurt more.”
His brain, his “massive intellect,” had failed him in that moment and his emotions took control. John was gone.  John was in danger.  Not the girl.  Not at first.  Only John.  Why?  Finally, the adrenaline of panic that rushed through his body – a biochemical, “Move your bloody arse!” as it were – kick-started his mind and snapped him back to action.
“Don’t even bother, Sherlock,” Joanna had said, gesturing at his concealed hand.  “You know my opinions.  Do what you want tonight.”
Okay, maybe not.  I don’t have to think … no, I don’t have to
It is my intent to have another chapter posted within two weeks, if not sooner.
“Yes, John.”
I don’t have to worry that they’ll see how pathetic I’ve become.
Across the city, Joanna had been celebrating her birthday with great fanfare.  Friends, food, drinking, darts, camaraderie.  All very tedious.   Sherlock had never had any intention of going.  There’d be
Mary and John had been cuddling in bed, breathless in the afterglow of a particularly vigorous shag when the phone shuddered across the surface of the table next to the bed.  John – to his credit – tarried in indecision long enough so as to receive a second, impatient text from the detective.
you think they’d be like?”
The pipe was warm in her fingers as it always was. Warm not from lit tobacco but with the memories of her grandfather guiding her tiny hands and the carving knife over the surface of the small briarwood pipe bowl as he murmured instructions and encouragements in her ear.
I still do not have a beta or a Brit-Picker (I'll talk to all interested parties), so any mistakes are purely mine.

“Finished it.”
. Last night in the alley. To Lestrade, too.” After Joanna had finished giving Lestrade her preliminary statement, and expressed her regret for her behaviour at the previous crime scene, she had pulled Donovan aside to talk. Sherlock hadn’t been able to hear the words, but their body language had been telling. Joanna’s gestures had been remorseful; Sally’s unsympathetic and hostile.
“I wouldn’t have, you know, but not because it’s a irreplaceable instrument that’s been in your family for generations.”
“You’re suggesting a polyamorous relationship,” Sherlock said.
Not ‘what did you do’ or ‘how’d you cock it up, now, Sherlock?’ but ‘what happened.’  Lestrade was remaining neutral.
Sherlock scrambled around to face John directly, and the doctor almost groaned aloud at the loss of the warm body against his back.  “John, your association with me has put you at risk.”
intentional.  Calculated even. Certainly is for the likes of Donovan and Anderson.”  Sherlock turned his attention to the window and picked at the corner of a safety sticker on the glass.
“There is one more thing.”  Sherlock’s voice was suddenly rough. He eased away from her touch and reached into his trouser pocket.  What he pulled from it stayed closed in his hand. “You asked me the other night whether there was anything that meant something to me.”
Hopeful that perhaps Sherlock had come out the other side of this adventure after all, John slept.
“No. It’s not always easy living with you, but it’s far from a nightmare.  I’m not going to harp on the things we’ve talked about before.  Granted, I’d give my eyeteeth for you to wash a dish or go to the shops every once in awhile, but I’ve accepted that’s not going to happen. God knows I’m far from sunshine and light to live with.  My temper alone … you’d have been right to toss me out on my arse months ago, but you didn’t. You accepted me as I am, even made me a bit better,” she gestured at her left leg, “and I’m sorry that I haven’t worked harder to do the same for you.  You deserve better from me.”
be angry.  Why?  Why are you not angry? ”  He looked to his friend for clarification.   “John, women get angry over this sort of … indiscretion, so why isn’t
and let me take care of this.” Sherlock said, gripping her chin in his fingers to keep her from squirming.
“Fine.”  Joanna was surprised but pleased by Sherlock’s concern.  She’d been injured out on cases before and it had never been an issue unless it inconvenienced him in some way, the git.  She noted the cautious way in which he was expressing his disquiet. It was as though he was protecting himself more than her.  Which was fine. She had always had little patience for over-protective men, and appreciated that Sherlock saw her as an equal. Well, at least where gender issues were concerned. Nevertheless, the fact that he was worried about her was … well, it was good.  “There’s no chair in here.  I’ll scoot over so you can sit.”
“You’re my blogger,” he said with a slight shrug, as though that explained everything.
,” he said, reaching out toward her.   It all made sense in his head. Why couldn’t he make her understand?
“Option Three:  You take Violet and Siger up on their offer and move to Sussex until the baby comes.  They’re younger than Mrs H, and there’re two of them, so that’s a bit easier all ‘round.  There are the added benefits of getting to know Sherlock’s parents and letting them get to know you and their grandchild. But, it takes you from London, and I know how much you love the city.  You’ll probably have more contact with Mycroft, too.
He would not share these thoughts with the man himself, of course, so, “Your medical expertise would be valuable since none of Lestrade’s people will work with me.  Anderson’s inept as you’ve no doubt noticed, and the rest of the medical examiners are even worse, whereas you at least show the

Joanna rolled her eyes and dropped the photo of the parrot back to coffee table.  “My mistake.”

“You did, Mr Holmes,” supplied Constable Chadha, helpfully.  Both Donovan and Anderson shot the young woman looks of pure venom for they knew she had also heard the entire conversation between Sally and Joanna, but Chadra smiled benignly in response.
Greg glared at the man sitting with his legs crossed in a chair on the other side of the bed, but said nothing. Instead, he pulled his own chair closer, and took Jo’s hand in his.  “Hate to say it, but he’s right,” he admitted to Joanna.  “Have you always had an ulcer?”
Have to get out of here!
“They are.”
Shame.
John stopped his pacing in the corner.  “You have an idea, don’t you?”  His sharp nod of understanding denoted how well he knew this woman. “Right.  You always have, so let’s hear it.”
“But do you think she’s correct? Donovan, I mean. About me.” Sherlock bent his head and focused on his meal.  “I’m not … an easy person to know.  Living with me must be a nightmare.”
“If we’re going to do this –“ John gestured at the two of them, and it was clear that he wasn’t just talking about being flatmates, “I need to understand my role.  I need to know what ‘colleague’ means to you.”
“Take my bed, John,” Sherlock said over his shoulder as the older man stepped into the kitchen.  “None of the windows in there blew out from the explosion, so it’ll be warmer once I stoke the fire.”
The carvings, a haphazard attempt at Scottish thistle and primrose, were the clearly those of an 11 year old novice who, nevertheless, had made her granda – a master carver – proud.

something to you?” For several moments the only sound in the flat was that of her ragged breathing as she struggled to hold herself together. She would
Sherlock stopped abruptly next to her chair. “
Sherlock took one deep breath and then another, nervously tapping out a rhythm against the fine weave of his trouser leg as he sought for a response to a question he didn’t fully understand himself.
Had John been more lucid or had more energy, he probably would have demanded to know what had happened to the man who had asserted that caring for the victims of Moriarty’s crimes would do nothing to save them.  Yet here John was, one of those victims, and he felt very well cared for.  Very well, indeed.
Joanna Watson hadn’t changed at all in two years and yet nothing about her was the same.  Her deep blue eyes, still welcoming, no longer sparkled as they had done. The curve of her lips – Sherlock pushed back the memory of their gentle softness – didn’t smile as broadly as he remembered.  Her hair was longer, well past her shoulders now, rather becoming save that the wheat blonde locks were streaked heavily with silver.  The wrinkles at the corners of her eyes had grown deeper, no longer shaped from the mirth of a playfully sarcastic yet brutally honest heart but with the heavy burdens of a warrior for whom the battle had never ended. She was beautiful but exhaustion rested on her every feature.
“You were afraid for me,” John’s voice held not once trace of bewilderment or confusion, only acceptance.
“ – more so than I am customarily comfortable with …”

“That’s going to be a bit o’ work then, isn’t it?” Greg mused.  “Mrs Hudson is far too old to climb all those stairs day after day, but I don’t see Jo letting anyone else stay in the flat, not even me, and she certainly won’t leave Baker Street willingly.”
Thank you for the comments, the kudos, and the bookmarks that the first chapter received.  I truly appreciate the feedback.  I'm one of those people who thrives on constructive criticism and happy readers, so please, please, please let me know what you think of this second installment.
“Joanna!” Sherlock protested as the files hit the floor at his feet, papers scattering across the floor.  He had done as she asked and left her mood develop as she needed it to so why …
“Something like that,” Sherlock admitted with an unapologetic shrug.  He dropped his eyes to study his other hand where it lay on the seat between them. He wondered what she would do if he just reached out and – Joanna’s hand was suddenly on his, twining their fingers together.  She rubbed the pad of her thumb against the side of his hand, and Sherlock felt something loosen in his chest that, until that moment, he had not realised had grown so unbearably tight.
John’s responding grunt was a cross between a chuckle and a groan of pain as Sherlock pressed the icepack to his injured shoulder and began wrapping the compression bandage around John’s torso and under his arm to keep it in place.  John didn’t feel at all uncomfortable as Sherlock’s fingers brushed at his skin with each pass of the bandage.  In fact it was rather comforting given the stress of the harrowing evening.
“I find myself … unsettled by your abduction tonight and the subsequent injuries you sustained.”
Please note that for the next several chapters, the timeline will shift through various points within the three series.  I will always list dates, but I will not list episode titles as the events of the relevant episodes should be clear within the narrative.
“Thanks, Greg.”  Joanna said, pulling him from his own guilty thoughts.
“Yeah.”
okay or because you’re not sure that
“Friend.  Yes.”
“Christ, Sherlock … what was that?” she breathed heavily, collapsing against the cushions behind her.  She gripped his fingers where Sherlock’s hand lay on her inner thigh.
John felt Sherlock’s fingers skim the top of his head down to the nape of his neck where the attending physician – there had been no escaping a trip to A&E this time – had stitched up the laceration left behind when Moriarty’s man pistol whipped him and shoved him in the back of a stolen cab not five minutes after John had left Baker Street to visit Sarah.
This was an occasion.  Sherlock largely remained taciturn whenever emotions came into play, so that he would willingly engage in such a discussion let alone initiate it surprised Joanna.  However, Sherlock never did anything he didn’t want to, so she wasn’t about to argue the point.
“To say nothing about what happens whenever she has to chase after you when you go haring off after a suspect. What is she up to now, 37 stitches?”

“When I was stationed in Afghanistan, I saw a lot of things …
Sherlock tarried in thought a few moments more before saying, “I wasn’t angry with you.”
John’s last conscious thought was that if Sherlock could coax something so achingly beautiful from what was – at its most basic components - a collection of wood, intestine, and horse hair, then the universe should count itself damn lucky that
The panic attack had exhausted John’s body as well as his mind.  He doubted that even another bomb going off across the street would be enough for him to find the strength to move right now, to say nothing of the fact that for the first time since arriving home he didn’t feel like he was freezing to death.
meant that Sherlock was desperate. Then there was the fact that he clearly wanted to know that she was safe and unharmed; Sherlock expressing concern and empathy for another human being was cause for celebration on most days. It was the “please,” however, that did her in.  Sherlock never begged. He cajoled, yes. He flattered.  He wheedled his way into any situation he wanted to be a part of, but one thing he just didn’t say was “please.”
“We will.”  Sherlock answered for them both, John at a loss for words.  That the doctor had reached another major turning point in his life was clear on his face, and Mary ached to reassure him, but she couldn’t.  John and Sherlock had to make this choice on their own, without any additional influence from her.
Sod this!  Sod all of this!
“For what?”
“John?” Sherlock asked, shaking his head.  He didn’t understand, and Mary felt a pang of pity for him.  This whole part of the conversation was laden with the unspoken sentiment that typically existed between a couple who had known each other intimately for an extended period of time.  Though the detective might be familiar with the concept due to his relationship with John, the dynamic of John and Mary was clearly elusive.  He needed more data, so she provided it to him.
Fair to say that I’m depressed, but I won’t go back to Ella.  I can’t.

– and Sherlock never again failed to announce his presence in their home without a decorous knock at the bedroom door and a polite inquiry of “Mary, may I enter?”
Sherlock studied Joanna for a long moment she looked tired, but not from the party or from drink.  One whiskey.  One pint. Barely enough to give her a pleasant buzz. Joanna had a tolerance for alcohol that rivalled men three times her size.  No.  Not tired. Resigned.  Why?

When he was done taping the gauze dressing around John’s more seriously injured left wrist, Sherlock quickly yet silently packed away the supplies, tied up the bag in the bin, and was about to take the basin to the bathroom when John boldly reached out to grab Sherlock’s arm before he could escape to the loo.
“I wouldn’t …
John struggled against the blankets that held him captive before the fire, but he couldn’t get free, nor could he escape the doom and the dread that descended upon him.
privately, Sherlock admitted that he was astoundingly thick when it came to interpersonal issues, but he felt that he had made some progress since Joanna Watson had come into his life. A year ago, this conversation would have been nearly impossible, and Sherlock’s capitulation a pipe dream for the Detective Inspector.
I am not a doctor.  I do not even play one on TV.  Like so many people, my "medical degree" is courtesy of many online resources.  I have done my best in the research, and I'm a bit of a stickler for accuracy, but I cannot guarantee that the science is 100 percent sound.  But then ... neither am I.  ;)
Buoyed by the DI’s – incorrect – assumption that he was not wholly at fault for once, Sherlock told him. He recited, verbatim, the details of his and Joanna’s row for the Detective Inspector as he continued searching the corpse for the container that had been secreted away somewhere amidst the detritus of flesh.
Sherlock looked at Lestrade over his shoulder and answered. “Now that we have the second data chip, there’s nothing else to be had. You already have my deductions on the how and why of it.”
“Well, you aggravated the hell out of it. Bleeding was such that the docs needed to operate.  Not life-threatening, mind you, but bad enough.”
The man seemed to be winding himself up into full “Sherlock” mode, and Joanna began to get the distinct impression that he had forgotten she was even in the room.  “Do I need to be here for this conversation with yourself, or is this a matter of ‘genius needing an audience?’”
“Not in the least.  So what
emotion, Sherlock had never seen on Joanna’s face.
She turned in her chair to face him.  “Sherlock, whether you see it or not, you and I already have an intimate relationship.  I can’t claim to know you as well as John does, but I’d like to think we are somewhat close – “
They sat under a tree in Euston Square Garden. Greg on a bench, Jo in the wheelchair Lestrade had nicked when he sprung her, IV and all, from her hospital room.  With all of the chaos previous day, Greg had been pretty confident that Joanna needed to get out of her room and out of her head.  He saw their chance when several new arrivals on the floor occupied the hospital staff, but Greg judged that they had at most another 15 minutes before someone came looking for them – he’d left a note on her bed explaining where they were; he wasn’t
“It’s a

I’ve been such a blind idiot.

“I did.”
He had kissed her smile through one of his own, grabbed his coat, and was down the stairs.  “Don’t wait up, love,” echoed in the darkened hallway after him.  John came home 27 hours later:  exhausted yet exhilarated and renewed.
She had missed Sherlock’s voice, deep and sonorous, when he demanded tea or her attention for something or other.   She had missed his owlish blink from behind his safety glasses.  The swish of his dressing gown when he tore around the flat trying to put the pieces of a case together, the fastidious way in which he organized his bedroom but never the rest of the flat, his smile – genuine and fond – whenever Joanna said something he found particularly clever, all these were the things she had missed.
“Dear, God, no!”  Mycroft looked horrified at the mere notion, and Greg couldn’t help but laugh.  The British Government sniffed with annoyance when he realized that Lestrade had merely intended to goad him into such a response. “Do you really think my brother would have wanted his offspring gestating anywhere near me?”
A panicked laugh burst its way from Joanna’s throat, and her hand flew to her mouth in an effort to force it back before she grasped Greg’s  “God, I’m a mess.”
So while they worked on the case together, they did so separately.  It was awkward and tense, even the most obtuse of the Yarders couldn’t help but notice, but it was necessary for the consulting detective and his blogger.

Jo sent her eyes heavenward.
He had read her file.  Talked to her doctors.  “Is
The child in Sherlock, the part of him that had loved Redbeard to distraction and desperately wanted to share that with Joanna was at war with his other self, the pragmatic scientist for whom sentiment was a danger, a defect, a hole in the armour of stoicism Sherlock had spent nearly twenty years forging.  The very same armour in which Joanna had found a tiny chink that had widened imperceptibly with her huggable jumpers, her dry sense of humour, her unfailing loyalty and bravery, and her uncanny ability completely surprise him.  Sherlock had been left open and vulnerable before he was ever the wiser.
He looked up, but Joanna had turned her attention back to the scenery of Bayswater.
“What it is?” Greg asked, unfolding the sheet.
The cigarette fell from his fingers, unbidden; he crushed it with the heel of his shoe.
“How would

Pulling her mobile from the pocket of her jeans, she sent her first text message in four days.
Sherlock squirmed, but only just.
“Sometimes, it’s
Sherlock withstood the not-so-gentle ribbing of the Yarders when they took Helton into custody – it was just transport after all – and largely ignored the sniggers from the cabbie that drove them back to Baker Street. Only a minor comment about the dubious parentage of the man’s middle child. However, by the time Joanna paid and soothed the cabbie by way of a generous tip, Sherlock had already bounded up the stairs to the flat and shut himself up in the loo. Joanna set the kettle to boil and searched the fridge for something uncontaminated with which to make dinner when the sudden electronic buzz had her running down the short hallway. She burst into the loo and grabbed the electric clippers from Sherlock’s hand an instant before he set the blades to his hair.
“Watch the tone, Sherlock,” Mary said with a voice that was as flinty as her eyes.  “I’m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that you’re simply overwhelmed by the uncontained emotions in the room right now and don’t know how to respond appropriately.  I'm about to make the most selfish suggestion of my life, and if you can't appreciate that, you can either shut up or sod off!”

dance, and he’ll find a way to use me against you whether I’m here at your side or hiding in some Costa Rican jungle.  Personally, I think we each stand a better chance together than we do apart.”
“Don’t be rude, Mike,” Mummy said. “Though it seems you’ve already been taken to task for that.”  She reached up and gently palpated the bruising around Mycroft’s eye. He jerked back, but a stern glare from his mother had Mycroft leaning down so she could examine it more closely. “That lovely Anthea told me what you said to Dr Watson.  Very poorly done of you, indeed. I thought I taught you better than that. I can’t say that I wouldn’t have done the same thing if such aspersions had been cast in my direction.”
“I’m … sorry.  Speaking without thinking, yeah?  Ignore me.” She showed Greg the evidence bag containing the vial, and explained to the pair where and how she had found it. “There’s nothing else that I can determine from the body until tests come back in.  Unless something else pops up in the blood work, CoD is exsanguination from multiple deep tissue lacerations and evisceration. Mrs Soniere was alive when he cut into her, however.  It was a very … painful death.”
“Jo.”  Greg took her hand again, hoping to deflect her attention from the elder Holmes.  “You’ve been very ill, but you’re mending.  There’s still your mental health to consider, too, though.  You’re mourning.  We
“No.  You’re just
Before she could ask ‘Do you need me?’ the answer appeared on her screen.
When Joanna finally returned to Baker Street, she found the flat empty yet surprisingly clean, which both pleased and concerned her. The lack of dishes in the sink, or even scattered about the sitting room, meant that Sherlock may have tried to keep things tidy in her absence, but the more likely reality was that he had ignored his transport altogether.
My thanks, again, to those of you who have left comments, kudos, bookmarks, and the like.  Reviews are bliss.  I'll admit to checking several times a day.  A girl needs all the positive reinforcement she can get, after all.

John laughed, but it was an unpleasant, hollow sound.
She was okay with my not giving her more notice.
John drew himself to his full height and stood toe to toe with the consulting detective.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
“Yes.  You have been.  Quite ill, in fact,” Mycroft confirmed.  “And yet you’ve managed to hide it all rather effectively.  I would congratulate you, Doctor Watson, for such an impressive feat, if it the consequences weren’t so potentially dire.”
I’m here, John.
“No, you’re an

“May I call you, Gregory?”
“Dozens of them,” she said, sounding again too much like Sherlock.  As far as options went, none of them overly appealed to her, but Joanna was thankful that at least there

Nice of her.
He had always been self-sufficient, independent, and aloof, yet somehow this mere slip of a woman had insinuated herself into the very fabric of his life, and he couldn’t imagine wanting it any other way. And when Sherlock saw her walk under the crime scene tape at the fruit and veg stand wearing that silly blue jumper and her hair pulled back in a pony tail, looking far more lovely than she had any right to do, it took every bit of self-discipline he had to not step over the cold corpse at his feet, clasp his friend to him, and leave the scene and the Yarders behind.  A very primal reaction, and one that he was still puzzling over days later.

now because if I have to get up out of this one to force you into it, I won’t be held responsible for any bones that might be broken in the process.”  John’s voice was quiet but carried with it an intensity that demanded attention.  He didn’t rant.  He didn’t rave. The threat was a promise, and his purpose was clear.
That was a far sight better than ‘tedious’, ‘tiresome’, ‘boring’, or ‘exasperating’.  In fact, coming from Sherlock Holmes, it was high praise.  Mary felt a blush of pleasure rise to her cheeks, and she smiled.  “I appreciate that, Sherlock. Thank you.”
“We should get back.  They’ll need to change out my fluids, and I’m now expecting visitors in,” she checked the clock on her mobile, “about 30 minutes, give or take.”
“Why, Mycroft Holmes, you
Mycroft was … resigned by the whole thing (yes, he popped in), but I’ve never seen Greg so angry; given all the crap that you’ve pulled over the years that’s bloody well saying something.
“And if we decide to the contrary?” Sherlock asked.  John tensed at the grave tone in Sherlock’s voice, and the detective slid his hand down the doctor’s arm, twining their fingers together, and squeezed.

Even the bravado of his taunts at General Shan had been just that, boldness and bluster, neither of which he had actually felt.  His only concern had been to get John – and, yes of course, Sarah – out of there, and in his haste to free the woman from her bonds, Sherlock had failed to take note of the assassin in the shadows.
Though she was desperate to do so, the second number she could not call.
“Lestrade said you had ‘a thing’. That’s why you weren’t able to come to the pub tonight.”  Joanna clicked the link that appeared on the screen of the phone, turned the mobile toward him, and waited for the video to play on the small screen. Joanna adjusted the volume so Sherlock could hear it over the short distance that separated them.
“Hey there, sunshine,” Greg Lestrade said smiling down at her before he pressed a blessed ice chip and then another to her parched lips. Greg had been in hospital enough – either as patient or concerned friend – to know the drill. He was the second one listed on her emergency contact sheet right after Sherlock. Well, first one, now. Harry didn’t make the cut.
Sherlock poked at the remains of his lunch with his fork then tossed it on his plate.  He jumped to his feet and began pacing the small room.
he did, he didn’t know.  It just seemed the thing to do.
“No,” Sherlock said, distractedly. His fingers skimmed the smooth surface of the images for a moment before he caught Mycroft’s gaze on him. He stiffened and cleared his throat, uncomfortable with his brother’s scrutiny.  “Well, we’ll have to get rid of those.”  He pointed dismissively at the spectacles Joanna wore in the second photo.
“I thought that I … that
Sherlock watched as he smiled that awful smile again and followed it up with a wink. It was awful.  Even he could see that.  It was fake.  It was insincere. It was insulting. If the video had been for anyone else, Sherlock could have given a toss what they thought, but this was not what he had intended for Joanna.
“Just Reese.  You’re not my student, so it’s all fine.”  He brushed off the honorific, and they turned back to watch Joanna spar with her opponent.
I’ll figure this out.

is my friend, the best I’ve ever had, and you’d do well to remember that.” Joanna finally looked down at where the sergeant had tightened her grip on Joanna’s arm, pulling her closer to plead her case.
“We need to … talk.” Sherlock didn’t even attempt to disguise his discomfort with the idea. Joanna would see right through it anyway. The talk would most certainly deal with feelings, and he’d be out of his element throughout, but Lestrade was right. He had to try.
John sighed but nodded his consent.
for a long-dead friend.
Donovan grabbed Joanna’s arm as she turned for the door.  Jo tensed. She thought she heard Lestrade shout at them, but she wasn’t certain because Donovan continued speaking.
Lestrade turned to face Donovan and Anderson. “Now, before we finish up here, the three of us are going to have a little chat about what kind of behaviour I expect from my team at a bloody crime scene!"
, John.  John!
John and Sherlock looked at one another and began stumbling over the other’s words.
“Passion.  All his previous killings, though personal, were dispassionate, almost clinical in their precision.  This,” Sherlock gestured with the blood-stained forceps in his hand, “was vicious, fervent … out of control.  We will find him far more quickly now that he has become the victim of his own sentiment.”
Cold.  So damn cold!
Lestrade rubbed his hand over his face and pinched the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, clearly frustrated. Sherlock opened his mouth to forestall the rebuke he knew was coming. Of course it was coming.  He had been admonishing himself all week, after all.  Why would Lestrade be any different?
The doctor nodded.  “Harry had no interest, so it became something that Gran and I shared together.” Sherlock watched as John’s blue eyes momentarily grew distant with memories.   “It’s come in handy … once or twice.”
Though he now wore two jumpers, three pairs of socks, and a pair of flannels over his trousers, John was shivering.  How much was from the shock and how much from the currents of cold air that spilled through the gaping holes of the flat’s boarded up windows, he wasn’t sure.  The breeze he would deal with, the memories, however …
“Do what?”
“Happy Birthday, Joanna,” he had whispered against her hair.

close to being ‘most people.’” John’s chuckle this time was both adamant and a little lost.  “I don’t know, Sherlock, but after the things he did – not just to me, but to all those others, to you – someone’s going to have to stop him, and that someone’s going to be you.  He’s thrown down the gauntlet, and you’ll pick it up because it’s who

There it was!  Tucked within the lower lobe of the left lung.  Sherlock pulled the ampoule from its cubby and dropped it into an evidence bag as he finished up his tale. He stood and turned to face a stunned Lestrade.
“I know what it
“That this doesn’t have to just be a ‘You and Me,’ or a ‘You and Sherlock’ winner-takes-all situation.  There could be an ‘us.’”  She gestured at the three of them as she slid into one of the vacant chairs.
Joanna pulled as gently as she could, frequently reapplying the detangler whenever she came across a particularly challenging knot. Nevertheless, there were some violent tugs that Sherlock – true to his word – didn’t seem to notice. He was deep in his mind palace, sorting and categorizing Lord knew what from their latest case, but precisely two hours later, Sherlock roused himself from his citadel to check on Joanna’s progress.
999 was the default programmed in at setting one. Right.
“We have not. Her mother died when she was a child, and I gathered that her subsequent experiences were largely unpleasant, but what would be gained by such an intrusion into her life?”
“But it’s officially over,” Joanna said softly. Reese held out the gloves, and she took the proffered gear, nodding a distracted thank you to the instructor as he took his leave and went to check on his other students.
All Sherlock had felt was peace.
“Pre-packaged sentiment?  Absolutely not.  If you insist that I –“
“I need to send a message,” Joanna said, locking the wheels of the chair.  Greg scrambled to assist her when it became clear that she meant to stand. He kicked the lap blanket out of the way as it fell, and gripped her arm gently before wrapping a supportive arm around her waist.  She wasn’t as weak as all that but appreciated the help nonetheless.
Joanna shook the leaves back into the bag and looped the leather cord about the neck of the pouch securely. “Thank you.  This … this means a lot.”  But her words seemed insufficient, so before she could think twice, Joanna cupped the side of his face in her hand.  He bent his head low and she brushed his temple with her lips. For a moment she brushed her thumb along the bottom curve of his cheekbone and smiled when he tried not to curl into her touch and failed miserably.
“If there’s nothing else, Sergeant. I’ll be on my way. I have
be in, for it has not yet been a year since he was wounded, treated, and discharged.  Sherlock was unsuccessful in doing so.
So polite, so composed. He sounds so harsh yet so casual, as if he's been in a relationship with a woman that used to finish his favourite ice cream instead of being tortured physically and mentally for
A strong grip on his right bicep as he goes to walk past the two persons in front of him. John.

John's gaze meets Mycroft's, understanding speaking for them both. Mrs Hudson is barely containing her tears.
«I know it's fine.» he knows. He already told him once, at Angelo's. They talked. Why is this necessary? This feels so bad, like a stomach ache. It's nagging, pesky and definitely irritating.
Mycroft hand lands on the table, cutting off John mid-rambling with a loud
Does he look sad?
Eyes fixed on the cuffs of his shirt, studying the simple path of the cotton thread drawing the delicate seams. Alert.
«I WAS ALMOST THERE!» his own voice echoes in his head. John is looking at him, hands raised. He looks scared. Did he scare John?
«I might change my question for a clearer understanding of the situation. Have you ever been on the verge of killing yourself?» his hands are trembling, hidden at the bottom of his gown pokets. John is not answering, he has his soldier mask on. Shoulders straight, arms down and tense, feet steady. Eyes glassy. Gaze distant. He sniffles.
Sex. Alert, alert.

Locked doors and ridicolous thoughts.

A couple of times she swore she heard him sobbing. He told her everything, about his bestfriend committing suicide, jumping in front of his eyes. What he didn't tell her, his nightmares did. He talked vividly, screaming often and crying and trashing and sobbing and it was horrible. But she could not deny that after almost two years, his reactions were still a bit unusual. He was a soldier. He saw death. He's a doctor and a surgeon and he'd seen blood and dead bodies and death of loved ones.
In the cell there was nothing but the piping screeching of blades being sharpened. It would make the hairs of his nape stand on end.

Sherlock's lips hesitate a little, faint stubble on his upper lip now visible. Sherlock never lets his beard grow. «Yeah, that's...that's fine. Thank you for helping me today. See you tomorrow, John.» the detective force a smile on his mouth but it comes off like a grimace.
John eyes carefully Sherlock standing few metres from the two of them, crouching over the dead body of a man, hands flying swiftly over damp clothes and bloody cuts.

But how could he speak if his mouth feels full of chalk? How can he stop moving if his skin feels like stung by a thousands ants crawling underneath.
«Jesus Christ...» a deep sigh. Mommy often said that when he gets like this. When he used to, anyway. But this is not his mother voice nor his mother hands and there's something reassuring yet alarmingly controlling in the way his hair is being lightly stroked.

Ashes ashes
She made sure he ate properly until he started spontanously cooking for them. He arranged the food in a peculiar way, portions neatly separated. His mashed potatoes never had too much butter or too little salt, the consistence soft and velvety. And she ate happily, heart light fork quick to show she appreciated every bit of it. And he watched as she did, as if Mary was the one needing supervising.
A small nod while he readjusts himself on the sofa, matted hair stuck on his sweaty forehead. And he knows just how John is going to leave the tea bag a little less in the hot water, to avoid a stronger taste in Sherlock's cup. He knows he will put just one spoon of sugar, to let Sherlock's tastebuds regain control. Because John is just like that, maybe because he's a doctor or because he's seen the effects of his mistakes enough times to let it happen again.
John.
And when Sherlock appeared with a pricy bottle of champagne in his hands at his table while the biggest mistake of John's life looked at them speechless, he felt like a half-empty saggy old bag carrying socks and dust.
He can't be this vulnerable in front of John.
Their eyes meet for a moment and John's breath hitches. Sherlock's eyes are glossy and tired, pupils blown and scleras bloodshot. Sherlock's mouth opens and closes few time, gaping.
The eyeballs in the fridge are starting to smell like proper death. John always groans when he opens the fridge. But John does groans at almost everything in their flat so maybe it's not that bad. They're sitting on their chairs. At least they were until John decided it was time for a snack. "Snack" as in "I didn't eat at Sarah's and i am quite hungry because God knows what we did".
"Ta," John responded, especially grateful for the DI's friendship in the midst of all, before he broke off the call and ran out the front door onto Baker Street.
He started to feel queasy.
Sometime past midnight, Sherlock slipped out from under the covers, pulled on his dressing gown, and made his way to the kitchen. Pulling up a chair he dialed the number of the only other person, given the circumstances, who would be awake at that hour.
Not having the assistance of a police escort to clear the streets ahead of him, John’s trip to The Yard took considerably longer

His breath hitching at the loss he saw in Holmes’ eyes, Watson suddenly felt the full burden of explaining the unexplainable, of rationalizing the irrational, of providing sense where none was possible. And as Holmes’ gaze regarded his, searching desperately for the answers in the steadfast eyes of his loyal doctor, Watson considered.
Sherlock looked back and forth between John and the corpse until the look of sheer devastation on John’s face, more so than he had shown at the previous two victims, gave way to realisation.

Sherlock regarded the rows of unoccupied chairs in the empty terminal as he waited; boring, uncomfortable. The carpet; boring, ugly. He resorted to closing his eyes against the drudgery of it all as he waited. Of course did not have to wait long, what with Mycroft’s minions always close at hand to do his bidding at a moment’s notice.
“Yeah, they're good,” John affirmed as Lestrade hopped in the back seat behind John, and Sebastian made his way around to the other side.

“So you were .... “ Lestrade looked apologetic and John felt a certain sense of sympathy for the DI. He was, after all, just doing his job.
he hadn’t been in that position behind that stone wall in the desert that day?
“OK,” John finally looked at him, drawing the word out. “Go ahead.”
Making his way to the door, Sherlock shrugged his suit jacket on before turning to consider the room and the corpse one last time.

As they were heading out of the office, Sandrine leading the way, Sherlock noticed a subtle (

«Don't touch me.» his own clothes are starting to hurt.
«That's exactly why I didn't tell you before. That look. I told you I am autistic, not that I am dying. Calm down, you're gonna lose your hair.» and he smiles a bit, a tiny little smile that makes John want to fucking cry.

«Not really, no.»
John has always been used to be quiet around the him, but after his return it was more of a coping mechanism than a courtesy. Yes, he was happy Sherlock was back and not dead. But the anger and sadness won't leave.
«John, please do get away from him
Words words words.
«Doctor Watson, I am afraid you're missing an important part of my little brother's life. He didn't go on a vacation.» his voice hints a bit of irony, but his face is dead serious.
Why is he nervous? Hand on his thigh. Leg hurts? Not his bad one.
She kind of tried for a whole two months now. But the answer is always the same, an ashamed «Yeah, you're
Again.
The doctor's brows are raised, bottom lip sucked in, eyes trying to translate the detective's actions whose feet are already walking away into his bedroom. The door shuts loudly, Mrs Hudson calls out from the lower floor. The building is old, she says.
Alert, brain is getting frustrated.
When Sherlock came back after his fake suicide, after John finally let got the memory of his fake funeral and a fake coffin with a fake body in it and a fake tombstone which he visited every day for a year, John had not been happy to see him. He wasn't prepared, he spent a year and half worth of therapy sessions trying to say Sherlock's name out loud without his voice sounding strangled and broken and dead. He was prepared to propose to Mary. He was prepared to start a new life with her, to attend surgery every day of the week to bring home money and pay his rent and
Everyone knows and seems to be keen to never let go the opportunity to remind him how NOT clever he is, but he notices.
silence.
4 minutes, 31 seconds.
He knows.
How can he explain the way his brain turns into a swarm of wasps everytime he smells Sarah's parfume on his clothes? There's no rational explanation foor that.
The water is hot. Which is an extraordinarily stupid observation. Water is hot, water is wet, god is not real, beauty is a social construct. John is beautiful.
«Dr Watson, I am afraid i have to ask you to maintain distance from my little brother.»
Feet are moving and he can't feel the ground beneath them.
«You are one talking! How
Sherlock keeps his head low. Right, left. Couch, sofa. Fireplace, desk. Window, lamp. His eyes can't stand still, scanning the room but looking at the possibile scenaries playing like old movies in his head.
He deserved it all. And it tasted like old times, like a burning house and the crumbling future. Like a broken teeth bleeding out. Like Mycroft coming to rescue him in a dumpster and and tying him up while waiting for the ambulance because he couldn't stop hitting himself from shame.
«Oh, shut up with the smart talking! Just answer me, will you? Honestly Sherlock, I am your friend. You can tell me.» John's voice cuts him off, he licks his lips once out of anxiety.

Sherlock fights him, tries to break the grip and escape the embrace. Mycroft looks like he might cry.
except he doesn't.
Shut down, Sherlock.
He is not fine. He doesn't want to die, he is not trying to kill himself and he wants John to know that but
STOP!
But it's not. He's going to be even more ashamed after this, he won't look John in the eyes ever again. He's going to die alone. John is going to leave.
«I'm impressed.» John's talking around a mouthful of salad, bread and tuna. In another context Sherlock would have found it disgusting.
. Please stop talking to me. Please stop looking at me.
He gave up, because
«Sherlock?»
John is talking loud.
There's too much noise, too many feet stomping around in the building making the floor cracks and too many door shutting and opening shutting and opening shutting and
a soldier.»
Months passed and it wasn't a doubt anymore. But again, a british man who doesn't drink?
Case, case.
John's nostrils flares with sudden anger. Not with Sherlock, but with himself. The scene is missing a piece and it takes Sherlock fucking Holmes to understand what it is. The only constant in this conversation are mood swings.
The first time they went out together, she invited him to get a sandwich at the hospital's bar during a quiet hour. They eated almost in silence, Mary swallowing bread and ham with a bite of anxiety when she saw the man fagocitating the meal with bad hidden hunger.
«You do think I am incapable of making food.» John shrugs a little, small bites, eyes preceding every single one of them.
The first couple of months after Sherlock's return, crime scenes had become...something else. It felt like walking on eggshells, tiptoeing around the detective fearing to scare him off and make him vanish. There's something new in his eyes, tender yet cold, scanning John when Sherlock thinks he's not looking.
Needle needle needle
His anger is not coming out. His posture is calm and relaxed. His actions natural and quiet. «John.»
And who exactly? You were a depressed veteran who drunk himself to sleep. You didn't have

Shower.
Just dust. Dust covering everything, small ovals of fingerprints left here and there, rings of dirty mugs left on the table or on the desk to dry out.
He needs to remind himself that his friend is recovering, that he is obviously in an altered state and that it would be extremely wrong to punch him.
Sherlock's yell was clear and painfully desperate.
We attended your funeral.» a choke.
«I am not asking if you're fine, I am asking what is hurting right now. If you didn't notice, you just threw up blood. You lack a degree, but I am sure you get that it's not a good thing.»
«John, I don't really want to give you the treatment i dearly reserve for my brother,» grey eyes are burying themselves in John's dark ones but not quite staring as if Sherlock is looking through him and not
«That's good. Cup of tea?»
«No, you're right. I had therapy, which didn't do much on its own. But therapy didn't cure my limp, did it?» and he smiles so softly, eyes rimmed pink.
«That's it? Just cocaine and morphine? Can you promise, Sherlock?» Mycroft takes out a small black moleskine and a pretentious golden pen. John can't believe his words.
fucking needle
He saw the anger, the resentment, the hatred looks that made his nape tickle whenever he gave his back to the man.
John begins to understand. Words are left unspoken once again.
«Exactly! You didn't know and you acted perfectly fine and I swear I will make you move out of this flat right now if you change your habits around me. I am perfectly fine and I don't need you to add autism to the causes of my
He realise that Sherlock is not immortal. That he is flesh and blood and vital organs and vital functions compromised by drugs. That he feels things like he does, that he suffered and suffers and it's tormenting.
Evander.
John is looking at him, deep deep blue eyes burning in Sherlock's scalp and taking in the sudden change of mood. The detective looks younger, childish smile playing on his lips and fingers moving swiftly in the air, low and quietly as if Sherlock is trying to hide it, tapping one the invisible keys of a piano.
But he could always hear his voice.
Alert. He's losing control! He's losing focus. He needs control.
Before.
It's holding the handle of
Wet? Why are they wet?
Mycroft laugh is humorless. He's shaking his head, walking next to John and pointing his umbrella in his brother's face. «You would never tell our mother about your

So they are now climbing the stairs and John
«What?»
Droplets of water roll down on his skin. The magic of gravity.
«You should ignore it unless it's him to approach the subject.» he lifts one hand in John's direction as he tries to answer, «
Can he see the fog? Can he see the damage in his brain? Does he know what's going on in his Palace?
John was not on the crime scene anymore.
He wants to reach, but
Cold green eyes lift from the violin and work their way through the small room to find John's deep deep deep blue eyes. He lowers his gaze after half a second. John frowns. «Please?»
«What?» Lestrade is looking at him with that confused expression of his.
This makes no sense.
The repetition of his name is stabbing the detective in his eardrums, the final “'ock” sounding like billiard balls hitting each other. He wants to block out the sound, he needs silence. But his hands are pressing on his ears so hard and it's only trapping the sounds inside his head.
«I could tell you, but this is not about trusting. This is about your need to satisfy your curiosity.» stay composed. Alert. His eyes must not leave the table, his facial muscles must remain impassible.
Did he
He needs distraction.
He was not
Since then, strong arms were always restraining him from behind, his own back pushed closer to the brother's chest.
That's when he turns and John is quite astonished to notice how wet the man's eyes are. « I can assure you I made my very best, John. He is my little brother, I tried to save him.» his sad smile is tilted to the ground. «But you know Sherlock. And you know how he works. And you know our relationship is quite...turbulent.»
«What?»
The older Holmes' creepy laugh sounds louder in the room one more time before dying in a sad chuckle. «Brother mine, we both know how unlikely it is for you to quit using. You struggle with cigarettes, I am very sorry to remind you. I won't let it happen again, Sherlock. Not like the la-»
but he looks on the side, avoids the detective's face. But Sherlock sees the redness of his eyes, the quivering of his bottom lip. The way he sucks it in and bites down with the front teeth. John doesn't cry. He never cries.
has the shape of tiny crescents craved in Sherlock's skin.
There's a weird silence. Sherlock's eyes run from one point to another without resting, not staring at the same thing twice, not even looking at something properly. «John spent the night out. He couldn't be here with us this morning.» stomach twists in a weird way.
«What did you take? Sherlock? Morphine or cocaine?»
BETWEEN YOUR HANDS, YOU ARE-» Mrs Hudson pokes out of the door, gives him a stern look. He lowers the tone. «You are the
«You-Honestly, i thought you were geniuses or something. But the more i know you two the more i doubt it.» he pinches the bridge of his nose, shuts his eyes for few seconds. He looks at the detective's bloody temple. «I need...I need to cure that cut.» and he rushes out of the room leaving a trembling Mrs Hudson behind.
«Out of it?» a gentle phrasing, eyes waiting for Sherlock to look at him and not just to him. «I think so.»
, John. I meant women. Not Sarah. Not Sally, nor Molly. Just,
This reminds Sherlock of the first chase after the mad cabby. That walking cane gone long forgotten in a nook. He needs to shake his head to clear his mind.
«Molly, your incoherent words are laying eggs in my brain. Please do shut up.» that might has come out of his mouth a bit too harsh, she flinches slightly at the sharp consonant.
If both eyes and ears are closed, something is for sure going to tickle his nostrils, maybe the same perfume on two different persons or the strong scents of deodorant or the way Anderson and Donovan too often smell alike.
Too much light it can filter through his too tin eyelids and too much noise it keeps pounding in his ears passing throughout the back of his desperate hands shaking the very core of his bones and hammering into his tympanum.
was the worst choice so far. «I didn't mea-I'm sorry.»
«What the
That's why it looks awful on him.
John's engine rumbling in his blond head, metal gears picking out the words he desperately wants to ask. This was going to happen. He tried hard to be invisible. Maybe he tried too hard. He didn't mean to drawn attention.
It's been hours and they are all in the sitting room, cups of tea have been drank, biscuits have been baked from a stressed Mrs Hudson. Sherlock is sleeping, or that's what the silence in the flat suggests.
She doesn't see him very much. She makes him tea, bring him some food when she suspects he hasn't eaten for days, but that's all she can do. «Sherlock, dear?»
John's answer is not fast to come. There's shuffling coming from the room, clearing of throats. A sad chuckle. «My bestfriend. He-»
It's not going to happen. He stands here, every inch of his body trying to refrain from running. He can't understand what's happening, he doesn't even remember how he became involved in this whole thing. He looks at Mycroft, whose eyes are fixed on his brother shoulders. Sherlock is absently playing with the hem of the left sleeve of the dressing gown.
Stupid, stupid!
Except he didn't put it in the fridge right away. He sighs, puts the milk in the fridge. Dammit.
Breathe. John needs to breathe and count.
Why would he wait up? He never does. Does he? Sure, it happened that Sherlock stayed up late composing silently or going through the mailbox looking for something interesting and that John returned home just before Sherlock decided to go get some sleep. But it's not like he waited for John to go to sleep. Did he?
he still hears Sherlock's apologieses chanting between sobs and groans from hours before. And the detective does too, his head snapping up so fast his muscles screamed in protest. «John, you have nothing to be sorry about.» his tone is almost affronted, eyes wide with
«JOHN!»
«He said you couldn't possibily have a crush on her.» careful, careful words. So gentle, his John. «Because you are not interested in her. Or in Molly. Or Sally. Or any other woman on the planet.»
» mumbled hurriedly.
John Watson being the most oblivious man on planet heart, standing next to the most outraged detective of London. «He what? Have you gone mad, mate?»
The doctor lets out a low chuckle, the annoyed one. What's going on? Is he angry? No, his hands are not balled up, they are resting in front of him, just before the full plate, pressed together.
«Wish I knew, dear.»
Their steps are temptative, John's shoes soft enough not to make too much noise. In the kitchen there is not a single fresh experiment. There are no eyes, no thumbs, no heads, nothing on the table. There are no dishes in the sink.
What is it?
He doesn't feel his own arms holding out and his fingers gripping the soft hems of a flannel shirt. John, it's John.
Not that John is looking at him, though. He's to slabs away from him, discussing papers with Graham? Giles? Greg Lestrade.
And when a hand brushes on his shoulder, his chest burst into a fit of loud sobs, stinging sensation irradiating from the point the hand touched his body.
«Both.»

«John?»
he should have told Mycroft to keep an eye on John.
The look she gives him is of pure despise. «How dare you, how
John is lying on his forearms, elbows steady on the desk. Sherlock can feel his stare burning holes in his scalp.
Weird. Wrong. How many
But with empty glasses joined empty sheets, a side of the bed going cold each night. Mary would turns around in her sleep to find the covers rised on John's side, the alarm on the nighstand whispering
No, not awkward. Is understanding and quandary, his medical experience quivering under the weight of what he witnessed.
«John! I was joking, I was joking.»
because
The first time they met after Sherlock's death, John went for his throat. Not just once,and rough enough to leave him with a busted lip and all that. And he knows it was something he should have anticipated, but still it stings like a splinter under his fingernail.
Something in Sherlock's mind snaps out of the blue.
What.
stop.
«Sherlock, do you want me to go? I know it's hard, just let me know. Just signs is fine, you don't need to talk.»
eyes lifted, take the image in. John's hands are up in the air, his walls are all down and so is his sureness. Breathe!
Deep deep blue eyes glare at him in that way he knows he's not in trouble. It's John's way of saying "i hate you but I won't punch you in the face" which is the closest thing to an affection demonstration they share.
«There was no point.»
you sent him to
«Shh...please don't start that again. Breathe.»
«Sherlock?» that's a noise, human noise. It's a no.
Not sad.
Sherlock thought too high of him.
«Hey, look it's just-another time, alright? Tomorrow! Tomorrow I'll stay and we can have a cuppa and a chat, yeah?» he tries, he tries hard to sound as positive as possible.
He sees it.
«Sherlock, I am here.» he runs his hands up and down the detective's arms, the contact meant to bring him back to reality.
John, on the other hand, falls from the clouds. «He is?» did Sherlock lose weight? He can't really assure he eats theee meals per day now that he's moved out. «I d-» idn't notice, it's what he almost says, but what kind of friend would say so? He's ashamed and «I don't think he is.» is what comes out next from his mouth.
Mycroft is sitting in the black chair, looking sadly at his own feet.
Stop. It's ridiculous. The fog is turning in small crystallised shards of ice. The shards are tickling his skull and brain.
Damn John. Damn brain. Damn door.

«Sherlock! Wait, mate!» Lestrade.
«Sherlock, you need to tell me if you're hurting.»
There are no gritting teeth. No tight fists. No clenched jaws. Of course, no tears.
«Hey, you here? You zooned out.» fingers are running in front of his face, just long shadows disturbing his concentration. He shuts his eyes harder.
She leaves the tray on the floor, toast gone cold and tea spilled all over.
Christ.
So i can eat too because you always remind me to eat or otherwise i would go days without eating a single crumb of bread. He doesn't say it.
Did Sarah come over? Did John cook for the two of them? Who cares? Not him anyway.
for days and that he needs
«What?» he blinks but doesn't dare to look Sherlock in the face.
He feels like crawling out of his own skin, breaking the flesh involucre like a newborn butterfly. His fingers are spasming against his biceps, the dirt is accumulating under his nails and he's nowhere close to being a butterfly, he feels like a worm grovelling in a mix of mud and blood and loud noises are making him deaf and smells are burning his nose and he can't help the trashing of his own body
Every step he takes towards the men is reminding him how consumed his body is, how proved and stitched up and bruised it is. The cracks in his ribs, the infection eating his flesh of his shoulder, his over worked brain asking for
now. He doesn't know why but he sees it.
John's watch is ticking loudly, Sherlock's heart is trying to catch up with the rythm. He really tried to catch up with the rythm of this new life.
Why is John so angry?
John is definitely angry. But it's not anger making his hands shake like a balled up napkin thrown over a fireplace. The man can't stand still, fists clenching and unclenching and fingers tapping tapping
Please don't don't don't
«Let it out, it's fine. It's fine. » A gentle touch strokes his leg, up and down up and down in a soothing rhythm. It's all fine. An ugly sob shakes Sherlock's whole body, sending all of his limbs in shock by the sudden release. His tongue leaves the pressured contact with the roof of his mouth and the back of his teeth, he can taste blood. «Sorry sorry sorry I'm so sorry John I-» blabbering is not his thing, the words are not the one he'd chose. His body is finally failing his collected mind.
, I will snap you in half if you don't keep your oral cavity
Where is his room? He needs to open the door,
» and he feels like his palm will burn if he doesn't remove it from over John's hand but somehow he can't because
«Doctor, he won't look at you. Stop asking, don't force him. And you really want to shut up.»
Like a square-in-the-jaw punch in the middle of the crowded room of an elite restaurant. And like a bloody nose in a dirty pizza place.
to, he was on the point of doing it. But tried means he failed an attempt, right?
«Lestrade! You might want to give a look at this man's clothes before I tell you why he wasn't killed in this exact spot.»
He thought
«Oh god, hush. It's alright Sherlock, there's nothing to be sorry about. It's okay.» John's voice is in full doctor mode. Sherlock ears are starting to recover. His eyes are no longer shut tight, more likely closed as if he were asleep. Betraying tears are making their fast way out.
John looks startled by the sudden eye contact.
«Shut up.»
He moved
This is not normal. When does Mycroft's presence
«I understand you've been through hell. I know what it feels like.» he absently rubs the bad shoulder, Sherlock can almost see the nasty scar under the shirt. «But I had therapy and...friends and it got better.»
«I don't know! I don't know, Sherlock! But you don't exactly look healthy, do you now?» you don't even look alive. He doesn't say that.
Sooooooooooo...

Don't touch me, don't touch me.
predictably.
He drapes himself in the sheets, eyes alert but quite heavy with sleep. He calls out again, louder.
Not dark blood, which reassures him, but still blood. It could be the result of the constant puking messing up with the gastro-espohageal tract. It could be ulcers, it could be anything. He sees his medical degree rip apart in fron of his eyes. Panic.
Alert, this is not good. Not good at all.
«The car outside is still warm, it's not the victim's car and the body is wet from the shower.» he starts putting his gloves back. Lestrade is staring at him with an open mouth. «Really, you can't..? Oh, Jesus. Must be so relaxing living with your brain.»
«Just, shut up. You-» he groans and breathes in, chuckles darkly, hands on hips. «You don't get to do this. Not now. Not to me, not to yourself.»
Delayed Echolalia.
New jumper? «Why a new jumper?» he doesn't like new. What's going on? He can feel his brain answering but he can't catch up.
«Look, whatever it's going on-No! Shut up a second, as hard as it must be for you.» the policeman is holding up his index, pointing at Sherlock's face. Is he going to say he looks sad? «It's not working, this...this
John nearly chokes on his food.
«Sherlock, I know why you're hurting and to be honest I am not sure I want to know further. But I want to help you. Please let me help you.»
He knows he's hurting his body, but he can't feel the pain. Is he in pain at all? When he was younger, Mycroft believed he didn't. Once he pulled his hair so much that when he fell asleep still crying and Mummy came to put him to bed, thin locks of hair were stuck in between his fingers.
«You have to promise you won't take anything from now on.» John's up again, wandering around the flat with the trash bin under his arm, quick hand throwing away needles and ashtrays from every surface. «You have to promise me, Sherlock. Because I can't be here twenty four hours a day to babysit you. Plus, you hate it when I babysit you.» It should sound like humor, but it stings his eardrums.
One harsh hand shut the laptop closed right on his fingers, it takes him a few mooments before he starts feeling the burning. He lifts his head.
Stupid Sherlock, stupid stupid!
«Alright...Mycroft, 'mind to give me a hand?» they lift the detective's arms over their shoulders, one on each side, to help him walk to his black chair. «Sherlock, I need you to look at me. Look at me, Sherlock.»
he feels, how stronger his senses are. He's been tortured and he's torturing himself right now and has been doing so since he's come back and John can't understand.
work, it's been
«I don't need to promise, I can stop. I could have stopped weeks ago if I wanted to.»
. «Why.»
«It was not my plan, John.» Mycroft voice is small. Why is it so small? When has Mycroft's voice ever been this small?
«'sure, okay. See you later, love you too.»
Sherlock hates the term, of course he does.
«You cannot expect everyone to just
And he needs him too.
John says nothing, he's still standing in front of him with both hands resting on his hips and tounge licking the bottom lip absently. He shifts his weight one leg to the other. He's trying hard not to look surprised or give away the fact that yes, he knew, but hearing him say it out loud makes it harder. Harder to think Sherlock has undergone torture knowing
John is losing control. His voice shakes badly, not with pain. It's rage, it's outrage.
John.
He can't sleep. They never let him sleep.
«I'm sorry.»
«Sherloc-come on mate, breathe. It's okay, let's calm down.»
of the flat.
«Sherlock, you need to stop this.»
John looks at the man sleeping heavily beside him, then carefully slips out of bed and follows the older Holmes in the living room.
There's a moment of awkward silence, because they
FOCUS SHERLOCK
«John! Please let me go! John, help!»
Was that a joke? Is he angry? Does John think he isn't capable of doing such a stupid thing as conserving milk? He's a genius. Of course he knows milk needs to go into the fridge or it'll waste.
John is completely oblivious. «Is that it?»
«I am sorry. I didn't kno-»
He heads to the bathroom. The kitchen doesn't smell. There are few plates on the clean side of the table and in the sink. Too many plates and too many forks to be used by one person. Too many meals to be meant for one.
He searches John's gaze but he can't quite hold it, his own eyes running away furiously every time they meet deep blue. All that comes out of his mouth is a srangled noise.
His tired eyes are red with crying, shirt crumpled and wrinkled with sleep. «But Mycroft is right, I suppose.» he walks to the kitchen table, looks for a clean cup.
» he sees colour draining out of John's expression.
«Are you gay?»
A confusing chapter about details and realisations. Sherlock doesn't want to die and John doesn't know it. Also, mood swings are definitely a thing.
His trained hands lay on both sides of Sherlock's face, hot palms over the thin layer of cold sweat.
«Good lad, see? That's good.» His thumb's tip is burning. John's heart is loudly telling him to calm down a bit, not quite relaxed on its own, but still slower that Sherlock's wilding one.
John is drinking again and he shouldn't be.
John sees red. It looks like in Holmes family runs a bad habit of dismissing one's risk of death. Mycroft voice is so composed, his posture is so relaxed.
«And is it a problem?» why is he doing this. The icy shards are starting to sting his brain over and over. His skin is warming up and his right hand tighten around the fragile instrument.
. You never did, it's always been me, the bad brother that has to tell his parents their son's recovered
He stares at the unmoving eyes fixed on the table hoping for eye contact. Mycroft lets out a sad sigh, shakes his head.
Oh. That's his soldier voice.
«Alright! Here, have your space. I'm going in my room.» there's a hint of
«So? Care to tell me what's going on?»
Love,
The food smells good. Is it beef? It is. Hasn't eaten in two days, John didn't force him to eat.
Mycroft told him about Serbia, about torture and abuse and that Sherlock is not healing. He is not healing and is numbing flashbacks and pain with cocaine and morphine and god knows what else. John himself is not over his own post traumatic stress and he can't see how they could survive to Sherlock's.
«I am afraid we should. Your lack of knowledge is harmful for both you and my brother.» he grips a bit harder the handle of the umbrella. «I suggest we leave the room for a moment.»
«Sh-Sherlock, stop this. You nee-» but the detective is stepping incredibly closer and now
Sarah? What the hell.
Mycroft lets out a small puff of air, expression relaxing.
«You should rest, John. I need my blogger well rested.» disinterested look, play with the pages of the newspaper. Look casual.
«What? We just finished, can't you live another day without me?» if he rolls his eyes, it might look like he's not actually
And the first time Lestrade called Sherlock for a consult and John tagged along, everything was out to the light of the sun in half a second. Everyone was watching them with that relieved mask on the face, an awkward attempt of a applause dying where it started.
And everytime he thought he forgave him, the anger kicked back harder.
Feel.
They never understood how much pain it brings him. It hurts, it stings his skin and his clothes are covered in pins and he can't get rid of them. Mycroft always held him tight and crushed his bones to the very core of them and his body felt like made of ash.
She bought him coffee every morning, a cup gone cold always waiting for him in his office, on the desk. Every week he could taste a bit more sugar, an added spoon of sugar Mary slipped in it afraid the doctor was not eating enough.
«I am sorry for my behaviour, I apologise.»
He met Mary at the surgery. She's a nurse. She was great, kindness irradiating from her open smile, big eyes welcoming patients as soon as they stepped in the waiting room.
«John, don't overthink it. It slipped, I apologise.» Sherlock's voice is too soft, worry melting on each word and he sucks in his bottom lip with anxiety, gaze dropping on John's feet.
Mycroft knew and knows. He knew how hard it was for his little brother to cope with changes so drastic they brought him on the verge of a crisis. He knows how hard it is to cope with the changing routine now that he's back, the emptiness of the flat closing around his neglected body. He sees the stiffness of his brother's movements, the way his whole faces scrunches up in pain whenever his back touches the backrest of his chair, the never ending trembling of his long ruined fingers. He sees, he observes.
He always hear John, even when he's in his Mind Palace. It sounds a bit like speakers are in every corner of the building, trasmitting loudly every word the man says. It's like his brain
Depression.
He felt in the right place. Not in the surgery, not in the house with Mary. But at
«I have no idea what you're talking about. Are you all going nuts?» he starts walking again, right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot.
He is listening. Face hidden in the sheets, hands clutching one another and held tight to his aching sternum. They've been talking for the past twenty-seven minutes. Mycroft's been taking long pauses, John's leg hurts.
Pause.
«I'm staying at Sarah's tonight.»
Plate full, food untouched. Glass empty but used. Once? Twice. He needed liquid courage.
«I can't. He might hate me, but he's still my brother. And your bestfriend.»
«And I am not a child needing babysitting.»
John's voice is so little, so broken. No Captain Watson voice, no Doctor Watson imposing his knowledge over him. Just John. The same little voice that told him to hush and be quiet and listed him all the stitches he would have needed if he ever got out of that cellar. «If I wanted to stop, I very easily could.»
Maybe.
«Not dead.» he said, but John didn't trust his ears. Nor his eyes.
«Sherlock, please you need to s-STOP! Mrs Hudson!» john is standing on the way to the stairs, afraid Sherlock might decide to go outside in this state.

The thing about living with his "gift", as John likes to call it, is that it comes with downfalls. Sherlock likes to call them that, downfalls. Meltdowns always felt thick in his mouth, loud in his ears when mommy and the doctors discussed about his health. It's not like he's ashamed, but back then it's was hard to find a doctor that didn't treat him like a damaged child. Once he told John, just after letting him know his situation, that he preferred people to think he was an asshole. Because there's this common misconception that if you are autistic, you are either a genius or a dysfunctional human being and he doesn't want to be neither. «Just let them think I'm an asshole, John. I cope way better with hate than pity.»
John is stuck in his place. What happened? What was that? He looks for new shots in the wall. None. Stabbed mail on the shelf? None. Frustrating email? Laptop shut. «Alright.»
morphine and cocaine? Are you insane?!» voice raising, his fist hits the table causing Sherlock to wince. His thin fingers are shaking as he tries to hide his quivering lips.
Too much.

He can't picture it. He can't enter it. «I was almost there you don't understand I wa-»
John's eyes dart away quickly as if Sherlock's been threatening him with pepper spray.
«It doesn't sound strange, it's bloody stupid! Are you quite stupid?» that makes the soldier lift an eyebrow, chin tilts a little.

And John
The detective whimpers, lids fluttering open a couple of times before opening wide with shock. «DON'T-!»

Not only he calms down, but something lights up inside his brain and he does look up at John. Not only at, but inside him. He sees the gears running in John's head, the questions and the diagnosis and the confusion.
This time it's not going to be fine.

He heard John. At his tombstone. He heard him. He saw his tears. He

The detective is behind him, holding him there by an arm twisted painfully behind the back, Sherlock's hand gripping angrily Mycroft's wrist. «
