The violin screeched as Sherlock made a jerky movement with his hand turned back to him, tense. “Can you shut up for a minute?!” he asked, more aggressively than necessary.
John handed her the water and sat back down in his armchair. “I'm John, this is Sherlock. And what's your name?”
“Are you okay?” The concern on Sherlock's face was genuine and John felt, once again, privileged to be one of the few recipients of such gestures in the Alpha's life.
“Well, I've done some research on that 'perfect bond' thing and most studies state that some Omegas only present when their soul mate is ready to bond with them.”
John felt the stretching of his hole and willed himself to focus on the pleasure instead of the pain, which made the latter only more obvious to him. Additionally, his thighs were shaking with the effort and nervousness, which, of course, didn't go unnoticed by Sherlock.
He smiled, most of all, because Sherlock was calling him by his name. No one had ever done that since he'd returned from Afghanistan. He was only ever called Item 339 or anything ranging from You to Bitch. He felt very valid. “I'm going to take a look at the other room, yeah?” John asked. The only reply he got was a distracted humming sound that told him Sherlock hadn't even been listening. It was a different kind of being ignored though. Sherlock wasn't dismissing him because he was just his Omega, but because he seemed absolutely absorbed by the notes he'd finally produced out of a crate. It was all very simple, typical alpha behaviour, but at the same time, it was so different from what John was used to. Just small things, but they meant the world to him already.
“Fine. You haven't seen the last of me, however.” She inclined her head towards John again. Then she looked back at Sherlock with her last words. “I'm very persuasive.”
John answered with a heavy sigh. “I'm so sorry, Mycroft, that was so not on.. I'm just so tired and riled up... I needed to blame someone else.. But after all,
Sherlock turned in front of the mirror the next morning, eyeing his reflection with excitement. Oh, John would love this. They had been tight three days ago, hard to do up yesterday, but today was the day he didn't fit in his trousers any more. “John!” he called. He wasn't yet quite used to seeing himself larger than rips just barely not showing, but seeing his belly finally curve outwards instead of inwards had something.. fascinating about it – at least keeping in mind it was because of John's pups.
“Something wrong?” the doctor asked eventually when he felt like he was carrying half of Sherlock's weight. Sherlock's reply was a low grumble and a straightening of his back, walking on his own again. “Sherlock.” The shorter man urged nonetheless.
“He sleeps around me; he will eat.” Sherlock slurred back at him, stretching his body, placing his hands on his distended middle and rubbing it lovingly through his gown. Mycroft rolled his eyes. “Get lost now. You'll only unsettle him with your
“I feel you two need some time alone here.. I'll come again later then..” Greg muttered, backing out of the room that
Sherlock's pride over his imminent success was practically tangible. “So is Sergeant Donovan. Oh, I think it just vaporised. May we go in?”
I have been commissioned over on tumblr to actually write a slave!Sherlock darkfic, which I've already agreed to and am currently awaiting ideas for. If that's what you hoped for in this story, you might want to wait for that fic.. Although, I'd, of course, be very happy if you kept reading this fic, should it still be you kind of thing!
Mrs Hudson came scuttling out of her flat and told them to go upstairs, where the police were waiting for them, pretending to be looking for drugs. Or not quite pretending, they were thoroughly searching the flat. One of them came downstairs from John's room, carrying a box. “I have been living with this man for months, I am a doctor, I can assure you he has not taken any drugs in all this time!” he protested against their belongings being disturbed. He could see how much it bugged Sherlock. DI Lestrade kept nagging at him and the Alpha looked almost.. betrayed? He reminded John of a child accused of lying when they were actually telling the truth. He couldn't help but side with Sherlock, even if that meant going against the police.
He noted nurses walking in and out, checking his vitals, his doctor walk in and out, muttering the diagnosis every time. Eventually, Sherlock budged. Jerked. He suddenly twitched and cramped like he was having a seizure, ripping his mouth open and crying out pure pain. John could feel it; some of it. It was devastating. He pushed the call-button and tried to calm Sherlock, but his mate didn't seem to hear anything over the intensity of his own scream. When his doctor and two nurses rushed in, Sherlock's efforts doubled and none of them could get close enough without having their faces bashed in. “You're scaring him!” John shouted, drawing their attention. The doctor gave him a shocked look until her eyes cleared with understanding and she handed him another syringe with a sedative. John did the same as before and Sherlock let him. Seconds later, the man was sleeping again, tubes plugged back in, nutrition being pumped into his system.
Over with angst and back to the smut soon, I promise! I just... Had to have some plot in this story, you know?
John pushed past Mrs. Hudson's fawning and dove for the flat straight away, closing and locking both doors leading inside. It was a horrible move against the elder lady, he knew, but he couldn't bear a soul around him right now. He went to lay down in their bed, flopping down on Sherlock's side to inhale his scent, calm his mind. He spent hours trying to get connected to his mate again, but it wasn't until the early evening, with many missed calls, text messages and unanswered knocks at the door, that he finally felt something again. It was blurry, weak and unstable, but he could feel him again. He was alive. God, damn it, he was alive!
However, when the Alpha reached to touch the limb, he drew it back, feeling too vulnerable to allow the contact. “Don't.”
John held his hand on the way to their taxi and on the ride back home, which passed by in silence. He carried their bag up the stair after Sherlock, his mate growing a little breathless by the time he reached the last few steps, one hand coming to his back, the other to his belly as he shuffled further into the flat.
“Yeah.. Yeah, sure, Mitchell and Dan! They're sweet, really, always so clandestine about their love. Bit like in one of those movies.. Mitchell's really the stereotypical Omega and believe me he and Dan found each other. Gosh.. and now he's missing?”
Edit: I think you guys need to realise something, though. I am a very psychological person and much, much less a physical one. When you're talking "strength" and "dominance", I am guaranteed to write a /story/, a character with those characteristics, not a vessel with muscles but no soul. I will always try to keep within the realm of the possible for the characters that we know and love, since I believe that is what makes a good author (which I, by no means, am). If you expect me to present you a shell without a core, I am sorry to tell you, that you've got the wrong author, and quite possibly the wrong genre of fiction. I can write you a book like that, but I refuse to adapt characters from existing stories and manhandle them into a wet dream that their personalities wouldn't normally allow them to be.
John, who was moaning and gasping even as he only kissed, nibbed and bit at Sherlock's skin like it was the first time he had ever felt desire and pleasure and passion, although one might think he'd grown used to all this procedure by now. John, who was treating him with a care no other Alpha would display to him as he pushed his fingers into him and stretched him deliciously.
John could pinpoint exactly the last time he'd had as much fun as he was having chasing through London right behind Sherlock – it was when he'd been serving in Afghanistan. Purpose and adrenaline. He was their junkie. Though he would argue Sherlock to be quite similar to him in that regard. Out of breath, giggling, they stood back in 221B, leaning against the wall. Sherlock Holmes was a ridiculous man, but then, so was he.
Sherlock had stepped aside to hail a cab and when he turned back to them, he said “if you'll get in the taxi, we'll accompany you there.
“Yes, thank you. This is really kind of you.” Sherlock praised. There were more important things on his mind than manners right now.
But whoever it was that bared the guilt of having made Sherlock who he was today, it might just as well be their fault he was missing now because Sherlock would likely not be working with the Yard now, wouldn't have so many enemies, probably wouldn't even know John. But at least, he'd be safe.
Unless you guys are seriously interested in a future of this fic, I will give up somewhere in the next chapters. If you do, for whatever reason, want to keep this train going for it's intended destination, please, please, please leave ideas for the bridges. In the comments, on my tumblr as messages or asks (http://kinkmerighthererightnow.tumblr.com/) ANY way you like. Tell me if you want to be credited, and I will credit you.
As Greg left the flat to fetch some medication, John crawled out of bed and tumbled back out of the bedroom, closing an locking both doors to the flat. He threw a fleeting glance at the cabinet containing their meds in the bathroom as he passed it on his way back. He didn't want any pills, he wanted Sherlock. And if he must, he would stay awake until he dropped dead. Going on medication would only take his ability to get the phone when someone called to tell him news about Sherlock. Besides, he'd been awake longer when he was in Afghanistan. Two or three days wouldn't kill him.
Having sex was very difficult these days – if their thighs didn't ache, their bellies were too big for most positions. Good thing they weren't doing this the first time, then. Sherlock kissed his way down John's body, paying special attention to his new favourite part, the belly, straddled John's lap backwards, lowering himself onto his small omega cock. Leaning forward, hands on John's shins, he had enough leverage to slowly glide up and down on his partner, John giving him as much help as he could, pinned down by his belly and his boyfriend. The slow rhythm was maddening; building pleasure delicately slowly, but then taking so long to actually get to and reach beyond the tipping point. Luckily, they had figured out a technique for that as well: Omegas were usually programmed to please. A group, a pack, a mate or even just a close friend, whoever the Omega chooses to build up a strong connection with. So, in the relationship they had formed, Sherlock needed to reach no further than to his own dick, his body immediately adjusting to clamp down on John, pheromones helping John's arousal, which looped back around to Sherlock and back and forth like a game of tennis; yes, even with the grunts and moans.
“You're very intelligent for an Omega your age. Not even private education for Alphas can get you there. Impressive.” John remarked. “Why does a clever kid like you take to taking drugs?”
Bored, lonely, angry, agitated, missing you, the whole 'my mate is gone and I need him back now' deal. “Quite fine, thanks.” he answered instead. “Lestrade was flirting with me.”
John shifted, wanting to escape the nicotine before it was released, but also desiring to talk some more. “So, you ask your brother to bring these things for me?”
He pushed himself forward on the cushions, stabilising himself as he got to his feet. As promised, month five had been giving him growth spurts that had slowly increased, not only in frequency, but also in severity. His belly was a telltale bulge.
The Alpha caught that look and moved the box between them, opening the lid and dipping the spoon into the now slightly molten cream. “Open up,” he instructed and Sherlock obeyed, taking the spoon in and releasing it empty.
As soon as Angelo turned around where he was chatting with costumers at another table, he excused himself and hurried toward them. “Sherlock! John! How nice to have you here again! It has been very lo-oh! I see you finally cracked the man, doctor Watson? Congratulations!” He shook both their hands as he, presumably, picked up on the scent of pregnant, bonded Omega, not even mentioning the fact of omega scent on Sherlock at all as he showed them to their usual booth. “Let us celebrate! In honour of the occasion, everything on the menu for free, for both of you! I cook it myself! I will get a candle and a very special bottle of wine. Be right back!” he chirped and John, again, was equal parts fascinated and irritated by the seemingly constant cheeriness, especially about their relationship.
His whole day was just brought and complete when John gave just one of his honest smiled. The rare ones that barely touched the corners of his mouth, but left that highly glittering glint in his amazing eyes. Yes, Sherlock knew what he sounded like. He was the same dull, romantic, hopelessly fallen creature every lovesick person turned out to be. He didn't mind he had reason to be. He had John. Beautiful John. He would create and dedicate entire rooms in his mind palace just for the wrinkles on John's pretty face, the stories they told. John gave him the wonderful opportunity to never grow tired. Even if he were ever done analysing and deducing every freckle on John's body, he still had the many surprises John gave to him:
“There's no stopping you, is there? And the Yard's storage of cold cases is limited after all.” John replied with a grin.
Sherlock hummed in acceptance, but only looked back up as John had turned his back. His gaze lingering on the phantom of an old shirt and loose boxers until movement in the corner of his vision made him look back to Rosie, struggling to lift her bottle to her mouth. He reached over and tipped it for her, her tiny hands steadying it as he provided the muscle power. She suckled and he looked back at his sample. When she pulled back, he let her guide his blind hand back to set the bottle on the tray again.
“Of course I won't!” Greg stopped him mid-sentence, which was just as well because John didn't know how he wanted to end it anyway. “You still should have said something beforehand or at least realised putting you in there was a bad idea. I could lose my job over shit like this.”
Much like John, Sherlock felt bad, guilty even. He knew what it was like to have such a neglected stomach and forcing all this food upon his mate after having taken more than a week to even go beyond soup, he felt stupid and selfish. He had forced John to throw up. He didn't know what was bothering John so greatly or why this situation was even a thing for him, but he'd been insensitive enough to possibly make it even worse.
John's hands were gripping the bed sheets violently now, his hips faltering in their pace, stuttering and moving more brutally, his breath coming sharp and he had to pull away from Sherlock in order to keep his oxygen level adequate, his eyes clenched shut and Sherlock thought he looked like he was trying madly to hold back from just knotting him, bringing them both to the inevitable high.
He decided it was best not to shout and with wild hand gestures, he told the captive Omegas to make a run for it. The first few didn't need to be told twice, the others soon followed like a herd of sheep. John kept his eyes peeled for the little boy they came for and was shocked at how many minors were in this crowd. He was only able to identify the right boy by his scent, the ripeness of which made John feel a pang in his chest. He must have been approaching heat.
“I know you didn't.” John replied, drawing his eyebrows together as he looked at Sherlock. The Alpha looked back at him and his stone-cold facade crumbled, a mild smile peaking through.
“Shut up.” the Alpha cut in. “How many bloody times do you need to be told something until you accept it? Is it so difficult to believe that someone would do you a kindness? That someone might just like you?”
So, Sherlock let this man be John's stress ball. Besides, people like Mr Edwards hardly deserved more.
Sherlock's counter-argument was simple, but heavy. “Not every Alpha in our society is a sexist, John. Times are changing.”
John sounded stressed, anxious, annoyed. Sherlock put on an extra calm demeanour. “Will I be able to take the pups out of daycare?”
That seemed to hit John square and he averted his gaze, that guilt back on his face. Sherlock was almost tempted to go and try the soft approach now, but he'd done that before and it hadn't done anything, so now, he would stand strong for his point. John mumbled something Sherlock didn't catch. “What was that?”
“Huh? Nah- hang on. I'll get Sherlock, can you watch them for a minute? Thanks.” He walked down the narrow corridor rather briskly, slowing down gradually as he reminded himself to calm himself.
“Mh,” John hummed stirring, “I was rather late, too, though, admittedly, not nearly as late as you managed.” Sherlock could hear the grin in his tone. Sarcasm; John was trying to be funny. “Alphas usually present at the age of 11 or at least twelve I was fourteen and it was textbook.. I was at school. Fifteen minutes into the lesson I started to feel uncomfortable, but thought nothing of it. Suddenly, however, my hips snapped up and I was weirded out of my wits, but I just acted as if nothing had happened nobody seemed to have noticed. A couple of minutes later it happened again, though more forcefully and my chair moved a couple of inches. It was only then, when I had the first three Omegas in our class look at me hungrily, the Alphas challenging, that I realised what was going on and I stood and fled the classroom to get to the toilets – I must have looked so shocked and I was, I honestly was so out of my wits right then.. I locked myself in one of the cubicles, trying to think of a way to deal with the situation as I felt my body warming up, my cock hardening and,
, Mycroft, nothing but the knowledge that he's still alive. That's it. That's all I'm getting. I've spent days trying to get into better contact with him, my head is exploding with the effort, but I can't, I can't!” John writhed, frowning deeply against the new wave of stabbing pain in his head.
Sherlock returned John's serious, but open look. It was still strange to the Omega to be treated so kindly. At least it didn't upset him any more; he didn't expect the one-eighty any more that would have him knocked out and his pups taken away. He was still unsure how to handle this at times. “But seriously, it's just a carpet.” The Alpha got back up and offered his hand once more. John took it. “Besides, I don't need to be harder on you; you need to be kinder to yourself. Five pups is a lot to take on alone.” He was walking into the kitchen to wash off the plastic sticks for re-use.
“Everything I try to force down, I throw back up instantly.. A small breakfast, I can take. Everything beyond that only makes it worse..” John said in resignation, sitting down by Sherlock's side as the Omega had just taken his pills for the night. “I'm sorry. I know I'm not a good support at the moment.”
“Why bother?” he gasped as a response, attacking John's mouth again as he struggled to get him all the way in. He moaned at the delicious pain when he realised he wouldn't manage right away and instead moved up again, starting to very slowly ride John and taking in a little more each time he slid down. There was a moment he clawed to John's shoulders wincing as the Alpha's cock nudged against his prostate. “How did I never realise how big you are?”
As they sat together and ate, Sherlock did notice John mostly smiling back at him in a false manner, seemingly to support his steady eating. Sherlock looked back at him and momentarily cast his eyes down at John's own plate, smaller size, barely touched. At some point John couldn't bear looking at him much longer, so he let his eyes fall down to his plate himself, trying to hold back the guilty expression. He pierced a piece of chicken with his fork, but the force with which he did it was a little sinister and definitely angry. “Stop looking at me like that.” he said in a dangerously low whisper.
“No, Mrs. Hudson, no body parts in the fridge. Nothing the like.” the Alpha answered through gritted teeth.
Sherlock's face scrunched up and he looked at his clock to get the time. “Aren't you off to the daycare in a minute?”
John took a deep breath, closed his eyes and grabbed one of Sherlock's wrists. “He's a purist. I could smell it, even on suppressants. At his age, the hormones are unbalanced and cut through th-”
Somewhere across the city Sherlock blinked awake again, the hairs on his body raised at the cold air in the large, empty room. Whatever they'd given him, it must have been very strong.
“You. When have you last eaten more than a slice of bread.” the Omega demanded and John tried to keep up his act.
Sherlock sounded displeased and slightly disgusted. John couldn't help the grin stretching his lips wide. “Yvonne is fine.” Now his demeanour changed quickly into something more muted. “Though maybe a little disappointed in me.”
“What is your relationship with my brother?” Right. To the point, then. That was the kind of conversation John liked and could get into. What he didn't like, though, was Mycroft's tone. It was serious in a way, that only parents seemed to know, usually.
The doctor felt the corner of his mouth twitch up at that. “Why didn't you tell me they were coming?”
Lestrade frowned at his tone, but only lightly, he knew Sherlock after all. “Yeah, actually I do. Will you come?” he asked, turning his upper body towards the door for emphasis.
There was a pause. “Do things like that even exist? I mean, how would such a thing be possible? A bond at least is based on hormones, chemical-”
“Everything!” Sherlock exclaimed with an annoyed huff of breath. He loathed the fact that he couldn't get enough food these days when usually he rarely even felt hungry. He was going to look like his brother when all this was over, he was sure.
. “Now, that said, it was a close call. Very close! A few more days and they'd starved-” she paused when John closed his eyes, trying to contain himself. “He will be fine. May walk out of here with a psychological trauma, but I can give you the number of an excellent therapist. Good luck with the syringes. I'll come back in tomorrow morning. Anything the matter, call up the nurses.”
“I doubt it.” John looked at him with a mix of amusement and intrigue. “From personal experience and knowledge, most of the time people develop to be the opposite of what they display in sleeping habits as toddlers. I used to sleep all day, Mycroft apparently hated bedtime. Cried himself hoarse.” He watched John for a reaction and then smirked when the Omega grinned. “What's your work schedule today?”
He writhed on the unkind bed, shaking in his curled up form until he actually feel from to the floor, metal cuff colliding with his ankle painfully as cold sweat pooled with hot tears on the tip of his nose, getting heavier and heavier until gravity claimed its own and Sherlock faced the ground directly.
He shook his head with a wide grin on his face. “No!” he chuckled as Sherlock stood again and held his hand. “I help you!”
He peaked over at his mate just to see John looking back over his laptop with the same stern expression, but with the soft touch he constantly carried when near the Omega.
John was more than fond to see Sherlock actually eat properly in a restaurant instead of him picking at what little food he used to order. Now, he truly indulged himself with food, throwing John a daring look all the time as if the doctor would jump him any second. “You know I'm not actually into you eating per se, right?”
It worked well. Better, than anyone had ever expected. To Sherlock's great surprise and fondness even better than he could have imagined asked believe him, he had a lot of imagination in that field. About three hundred ways for things to go wrong and for him to be left alone immediately would come up to his mind, if you asked him right this second. But, miraculously so, it didn't.
It was needless to say Tommy's father was overjoyed. He'd been on his balcony and came running down as soon as he saw them. He'd been kept from talking to either child for months by their Omega. Now he was embracing them, listening to their story. John was happy to see how much the Alpha cared for them. He moved a step closer and lowered his voice to be a little more private as he told the father to get Tommy a safe space for his impending heat. The Alpha chuckled and nodded. Lisa turned her red face away.
The elderly woman answered him again. “Yes, Sherrinford. Not a genius like the others, mind you, but a heart larger than life! He was, so to say, the heart to their brains. We were always proud-”
“Here it is then?” John asked, his courage swaying a little as he watched Mrs Edwards disappearing behind the club's facade.
“No. Nonononono.” John protested, battling his hands away and climbing out of the bed, denying he had to steady himself on the nurse for a moment. “Sherlock. I need to get Sherlock. I need to get him out of there.” he mumbled on, brain dizzy, still caught up in the haze of final rest after having gone too long without it.
“Hm, you certainly seem satisfied, yes.” the Alpha mumbled, clumsily caressing his Omega's face and cuddling up against him, mindful of the pups growing in the small space between their bodies.
The next morning, when John stirred, they looked at each other and could tell that neither of them had slept, but both had pretended to.
The cold running down his throat felt nice actually and made him hum contently, the vibration running through them both until John offered him “more” and how could he refuse?
John actually shed some tears at the great relief and picked up his phone to text Greg those news, rejecting his offer to come around for some comfort and then informed Mycroft, who'd tried contacting him as soon as John had left the Yard, as well. He didn't doubt a second that some camera had filmed him leave with Greg and getting into his car and that the older Holmes brother had somehow deduced through that, that Sherlock had gone missing. Not too difficult to figure out, now that he thought about it.
At least, he told himself, he had a place to go back to. Sure enough, Mrs Hudson greeted him with open arms and some biscuits.
Sherlock sighed. “I'm afraid that's exactly what we're going to do. It could be a while, however. Would you like me to tell Mrs Hudson to take your children today?”
John stared at Sherlock for a moment, perplexed by the sudden outburst. When he'd caught up, he blinked rapidly, lowering his gaze to the sterile floor.
When Sherlock eventually opened his eyes, recovering from his orgasm, a flood of relief rushing from him into John, the Alpha looked wrecked, spent and utterly in awe. Sherlock reached out and caressed his cheek, wiped the cum off his chin.
“You're kidding, right? 'Course I'd.. like to. Between the kids and my job, I'd have to.. of course, but.. yeah.” he concluded and paused. “Yeah, I'd like that.”
I've been debating whether or not I wanted to share all of this with you or keep it to myself, but as I'm fearing the next wave of disappointment because John isn't a fuckboy and Sherlock not a brainless toy, I figured I would.
His eyes automatically shut tight against the stilling movement of the Alpha, tears welling, jaw clenching as his seed began to spill inside Sherlock. It was disgusting.
He was positioning it when he informed John further. “Look inside the bag, everything in there is now yours.”
John smiled to himself as he continued to eat. “Well, don't worry. Purist children tend to scream less than ordinary ones. As long as their Omega is around, they will be content for the most part, occasionally asking for food or a nappy change, but fairly independent and can entertain each other. Once I've got a job, I'll get them into daycare and you won't hear from us until we're back, promise.” It didn't seem to change anything in Sherlock's expression, but then again, nothing ever seem to be able to.
“A skilled and sophisticated Alpha like yourself with a clumsy bitch like me? I understand why he was shocked. I hope my tea burned his chest hair away.” Sherlock breathed.
“I want to-” through the open door, they could hear someone entering the house with a key. That settled the cause. “-speak to him.”
John turned his head slowly, eyes wide, hair lowered to his eyebrows in surprise. In shock, really. “That would be lovely.” he replied, drawing his eyebrows together in scrutiny.
Being inside his mind palace was usually a good experience, something appeasing his brain by occupying it.
To test that, the Omega threw a fast and unexpected punch at John, which was blocked quite skilfully. “Well.. m-maybe..” Sherlock admitted, a bit stunned at John's sudden reaction when he had remained so passive before, taking hits and blows just to not hurt his mate. “Why-?”
“I will have a regular transaction to send you a sum of money monthly, should there be questions or complications, you know how to get in touch.” Mycroft gave them both the once-over. “I will better take my leave now, I can see you two need some time to.. discuss.” And with that, Mycroft pranced away.
“Yeah, yeah, right you can..” Lestrade said, scratching the back of his head. “Bloody hell, you're pregnant!”
“Yes, nothing happened, no one got hurt.” John smiled and was about to say something, but swallowed it back down. Sherlock wanted to say 'you know I love them', but that just sounded creepy to himself, so he shouldn't mention it to their father. “They slept very tightly, and ate their breakfast without a fuss.”
“Nothing,” he said, waving his hand dismissively. “It's just, they don't know what kind of force they contacted instead.”
After minutes of playing he noticed it was Chopin his pup was listening to at the moment; he loved playing Chopin and it could only ever sound better when Mycroft played the piano to his violin – minimalistic number of instruments and yet rich in sound. There was one good thing about their parents' way of raising them: they were given the chance to learn to play an instrument of their choice and support could be taken for granted. Now he let the bow glide over the strings with satisfaction and his own pup was listening. If there was one aspect of parenthood he wanted to give to his child, it was this, music and the chance to play it, create it, live it because no matter how disordered a mind, how restless a soul, there was peace for everyone in some piece of music.
“Mrs Hudson is preparing some warm water, towels and blankets. I assume she wants to assist you.” He paused. “Do you want me to stay or go away?”
Their junction was a transcendent state in space and time and Sherlock had never been one for poetry, but lord witness, their souls rose high.
Mycroft's eyes lingered on the broken soldier before him and it made him fear for the condition of his more sensitive brother. He had an idea who could be behind all of this. There was but one man he knew capable of this level of expertise in criminal matters.
John interfered again at that point. He could see they were not getting anywhere like this. “Without wanting to disturb any of your familial.. quarrels, I can assure you that Sherlock will be safe, well taken care of and without a need if he stays with me. He will have all the freedom he needs.”
John just looked back at him with a blank expression. Sherlock frowned at him for a second, but decided to give John a minute. “What might be the outcome?”
Sherlock looked at her for a moment. Just looked. He felt dumbstruck. Utterly thoughtless. Until his gaze shifted to where John was staring back at him. Four. Not one. Four. Four squirming, spitting, demanding, crying, kicking, pooping... things. At once.
Sherlock groaned as he lifted his head to look at the clock. “Half an hour. Doctor should be here soon, though. Did you speak to Dr. Field yet?”
“Sorry, but they honestly shouldn't be fussy, I've taken care of everything. It's just in case they start complaining about something, if you don't mind.”
They moved against each other for while, kissing slowly, changing the angle multiple times. There was that feeling again, like his insides were spinning and he about to throw up and he wanted more. He bit on John's lower lip lightly and pulled at it a little. John, in response, dragged his tongue along Sherlock's plush lower lip as soon as he was free. Sherlock opened up, let John in with a sigh and pushed firmer against his partner as they let their tongues dance.
It was nice, seeing him like this because while he was back to his usual self a lot more, even those smiles small and hidden, visible only to those who knew him intimately (John and the Holmes family), he was somehow radiating contentment and a sort of inner peace that was beyond uncharacteristic for him and yet didn't collide with his natural reservoir of energy. The doctor wasn't entirely sure whether it was their bond and finally having someone to love him unconditionally after decades of receiving shit from others, or if it was just the pregnancy, the telltale glow of domesticity.
In a way to assure himself, John tried pushing in a fourth finger into Sherlock, feeling the light resistance, but it was no measure to make him stop.
“If you would.” Sherlock asked rolling his eyes as soon as she turned her back, releasing a deep breath as he looked at John, who looked around checking for anyone else who might have their eyes on Sherlock.
entertain all you little terrors,” he said half-jokingly and catching Sherlock sitting on the sofa from the corner of his eye for a short second. “Why don't you get back to Jacklyn and I'll join you soon?”
Greg came to visit him the next day, when John had finished another event-less shift. He entered the living room with a knock to the door that stood lightly ajar to find an absent-minded John just staring at Sherlock's chair, hot cup of coffee gone cold in his hands. “Hey, mate, how are you?” he asked pulling over the small wooden chair from their desk as he knew John wouldn't like anyone sitting and possibly covering the scent in Sherlock's chair.
John wanted to say something, but couldn't figure out the words without accidentally overstepping some lines. He dropped his gaze.
“And stop saying you're sorry!” Sherlock further demanded. John didn't know where all that suddenly came from but he stood down, arms wrapping around his belly protectively. The floor was practically buzzing with energy that seemed to flow out of Sherlock like an endless supply. Were John any other, he'd likely be scared of the Alpha. “There should have been a mobile phone in the bag. Did you find it?” Sherlock said, suddenly a lot more gentle, but still noticeably agitated by something John didn't know.
The next thing Sherlock consciously noted, was waking up with a dizzy feeling and a frizzy sight. He's lightly nauseous. He didn't know why. He didn't remember eating something bad, he didn't remember eating at all for that fact, so what could have gotten him into such a state so quickly? He closed his eyes against the dizziness and tried to focus on what he could remember.
After some consideration, Mycroft stood, taking another step towards John and bent down, giving him a loose, very awkward hug, even if just to reassure himself that this man did care about finding his brother. John didn't move, safe for his head instinctively turning into the contact, trying to get a whiff of the Holmes family scent. Mycroft's masked alpha scent in it reminded him of how Sherlock had smelled before his heat; Holmes, but somehow not Alpha, not Omega, not even Beta, something rare and unique, an identity of his own. God, he missed that smell. It was adventurous and mysterious. Omega was wonderful and just as perfect, but much more obvious. It lacked a certain thrill, which John was fine with, but he still missed the old days nonetheless. Mycroft drew back again and wordlessly left the flat. The dare hung in the air silently, that 'no word would leave this room'.
Lisa nodded and drew her hand through her brother's hair. “If our parents are going to prison, then where do we go?”
Sherlock was laying on the sofa, eyes closed, hands steepled under his chin, his feet massaging the armrest. John had asked Sherlock not to smoke inside the flat for his and his pups health's sake and Sherlock had complied without the tiniest of complaints, so finding him with nicotine patches on his arms was not unusual for John.
There he was, musing about the discomfort in his abdomen that didn't fit the feeling of any sickness he knew.
“Now, Mr. Holmes, we are just going to run a few tests this time, yes? I just want to take your blood pressure, a sample of both your blood and your urine and I would like to take a peek downstairs.”
“Because before you would have just continued attacking me randomly and one wrong move from you while I blocked you, could have ended in you hurting yourself some way. Now I knew this was a single punch, meaning no offensive movements afterwards, meaning you're safe.” John explained and Sherlock could only stare. Any time he thought he'd figured John out, the man presented him with something new and unexpected, something he'd learned in the army and hadn't forgotten in the least, something his years of experience with other human beings had taught him or anything at all, really. He hadn't thought John would take on fist-fights strategically like he did himself. Much less had he known John read the body language of his opponent like that. He stared.
Sherlock let the first three spoonfuls pass his lips just so, but with the fourth, he started to move slowly on top of John, who growled his appreciation. The ice cream was laid down next to them, the contents already molten enough to be scooped out without having to hold the box for leverage, and one of John's hands came back up to caress Sherlock's belly ever so gently, careful not to hurt the sensitive skin and flesh, but with enough pressure to adequately feel the light bulge their pups were forming. A lustful moan escaped John's throat and he started moving his hips to the rhythm of Sherlock's – the well known rhythm they'd developed many couplings before; the unique rhythm of their bodies; the perfect rhythm they wouldn't find with anyone else.
He led him upstairs and into the nursery, where Sherlock came to a sudden stop. “This? You... started furnishing the nursery?”
Naturally, it didn't take Sherlock long to reach orgasm and he sounded as much surprised as he did satisfied. John worked him through it, then let go to focus on himself and not to hurt the other in his post-orgasm overstimulation. He reached for a tissue quickly before finishing, ejaculating into it and cleaning his hands on it before discarding it on the unused night stand on the ghost side of the bed. He crawled back to kiss Sherlock, who promptly pushed him onto his back, draped himself across him like a duvet and proceeded to nuzzle the nape of John's neck.
But nothing ever happened. Most of the time, they didn't even talk. It wasn't exactly unpleasant, in fact it felt quite easy. Still, John felt out of place.
wasn't here. I wasn't here for him....” John repeated time after time, apparently not having registered Mycroft's indirect question.
, John! Those pretentious stories, loaded with exaggerated emotional responses and over-the-top trivia! It's music-hell!”
John tried feigning ignorance, but as ever, he was a bad liar. “What?” he chuckled, pretending not to know what Sherlock was talking about.
“Stop lying, John.. Come on...” with that, Sherlock threw back the blanket and budged over a little bit so John could climb in.
Sherlock spared him a short glance, but didn't reply. They had arrived anyway, so John figured he would just go along and see where it got him.
Back on the dirty mattress, he shovelled the mashed potatoes in his mouth as quickly as possible. If there were drugs in it, he had to make sure he ate as much as possible before they could affect him.
“No one has really told me why my wife and I are here. We were told you found our boy. We'd like to see him.” said the delicate man, holding the zip on his jacket elegantly, but defensively.
When John finally lay down, Sherlock budged up against his back slowly, waiting for John to flinch away, but he didn't. Reassured, Sherlock slung his arm around his way too thin mate, nuzzling into his back. “
“No, I'm wearing a sheet. What are you doing?” The Alpha reinforced, sounding a tad annoyed that his question wasn't answered yet.
The next ten minutes, John was passionately rubbing his cheeks against Sherlock's own, his neck, his collarbone, undressing him completely and continuing to mark him with his scent, nibbling at patches of skin, kneeling down and nuzzling into the softening flesh of Sherlock's belly, where the scent of their growing pup was strongest due to hormones produced directly beneath the skin to draw alpha attention to it; to keep the Omega tended to; keep them protected and cared for.
Lestrade gave him a scrutinising look. His frown turned into a surprised open-eyed stare. “Are you-.. Sherlock, you... John, did he-... What happened this last month?!” he settled for to ask, clearly not wanting to embarrass himself by asking the wrong question.
He reached up a hand to scrub down his face. This couldn't be it, right? Almost forty years with drunk authorities, drunk siblings, war and losing friends as he told them to stay with him while he tried stopping their blown-up limbs from bleeding out, and now he'd lose the most important of them all with a “Fine, where? JW” on his mind?! This must be some kind of cosmic joke, the universe laughing at him for being naïve enough to ever think he could have a life with a family.
One-handed, John freed their necessary parts of their clothing, grabbed a bit of lube, pretended to prepare Sherlock for half a minute and then slammed his cock in to the hilt. A sigh, a quick breath and the Alpha was hammering into Sherlock, who could only keep his position just so by trying to push back with his hands grabbing at the bedsheets. His lower back hurt from the position and John seemed eager to carve a map of London into his back and arse with his fingernails.
“Yes, Sherlock because that is about your body. I would never make a decision about your body without your consent and I expect the same of you vice verse. I know it's difficult for you, this whole thing about empathy and thinking outside the 'I-box', but we're a team, now more than ever and you can't deny that you must be feeling some of me washing over on to you through our bond.” John came to a halt there, giving Sherlock time to process what has been said and give it a quick thought. “Let us get these through and then we can still see and decide whether or not we even want more, okay? I'm surprised, well, no, not really surprised, by how quickly went from freaking out because you thought you were losing a pup to wanting to impregnate your Alpha mate.. But I definitely won't have this situation more complicated than it already is, Sherlock, we're going to have to take care of four children at once and it won't be just feed them, play with them and bring them to bed. It'll be a lot of feeding at different times, cleaning, changing nappies and trying to somehow get them into a sleeping rhythm that will still leave us awake most nights. I won't be home a lot once you are out of hospital-”
Sherlock shook his head without thought. Well, thinking became harder and harder as it was. His superior mind was all that was keeping him as mildly sane as he was at the moment, he reckoned, John's delicious Alpha scent did nothing to help him. Oh, John. Lovely, strong, oblivious John. How he wanted to have the man right now. Just thinking about John taking him, filling that craving in his abdomen – god, his hole was leaking like a river into the great ocean. He couldn't stop the longing whine escaping his throat. “Just go away, please.” he breathed, a blush creeping up his cheeks. This loss of control, he couldn't take it, couldn't let John see him in such a state.
Sitting in the showcases, being fucked and ignored; it showed him who he was and what he was for. He knew the worst things that would be done to him.
He leaned heavily on John's shoulder, not able to put a lot of weight on his legs yet, but John made it seem like it was nothing, like Sherlock was doing it all on his own.
When he woke, it was with his mate's name on his lips. That word continued to be his entire vocabulary for several long minutes in which he mouthed it in writhing pain, his abdomen cramping around his turning stomach, the ache in the back of his head now a hammering pain. He needed John. Needed his presence, his comfort, his scent. “Jaawn..” he whimpered one last time before losing himself to silent sobbing as his entire body shook and hurt from the inside out.
trying, Sherlock!” John retorted, head snapping up then ducking it again, palming his forehead as the image of Sherlock disappointed and alarmed face burned it's way into his mind. He didn't mean to sound so harsh.
“.. freak out, but Sherlock is not at Baker Street any more. Mrs. Hudson confirmed he'd left just seconds before you collapsed. I told Donovan to mobilise a team to start looking for him and...” and that's all John needed to hear.
John surely wanted this pup and, technically so did Sherlock. But it meant a great change to both of their lives.
“Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime, far too much.” John replied quietly, like in remembrance of his fallen mates.
Confused, a bit shocked, but mainly taken aback, John made his way back to the main road to start looking for a cab to take him to Baker Street. He was pissed about being ditched like that, the police, of course, also had no further use for him, he was just a superfluous, old Omega. Stranded.
Sherlock took the spoon from John's hand and scooped himself some of the ice cream, licking the metal clean and swallowing before he leaned forward, leaning his temple against John's and whispered into his ear. “I know. I appreciate your compliance, however – I missed my doctor on my cases.” With that, he leaned back again and filled the spoon another time, this time guiding the almost-liquid to John's mouth. The Alpha took it with a confused grin, understanding when Sherlock moved in for a deep kiss.
“It's them.” the Omega replied dryly. He cleared his throat and tried again. “They 'kidnapped' the boy.”
John lay his arms around the Omega lazily, gently caressing his bare back, bringing one hand around to stroke the tiny bump, now having the space to do so as Sherlock had let the air out. “You are horrible, you know that?”
Slowly, the Omega sat up, kissed John while he rotated them upon his own axis and gently laid him down on the mattress, stretching out above him. He curled up a little to wrap John's legs around his waist and then crawled back up to kiss John again, ending on a thrust with his hips as he caged the Alpha's head with his forearms.
John looked between him and the slice of bread, but, as John so often did, he said nothing whatsoever, figuring there was no point to argue with Sherlock about any of the presenting topics. If the man wasn't hungry, he wouldn't eat. If the man wanted a relationship, he would get it.
were crumbling under all this weight and they knew, and that was that. And Sherlock seemed to keep acting as if it wasn't there, as if the cause didn't exist. The Alpha was surprised, honestly, that he'd held on for this long.
“You seem to think you and your brother are the only ones with an IQ reaching levels of true ingenuity, Mr. Holmes. My boss isn't stupid.”
“Alright?” Sherlock asked and although John could see a light tremble in his body, too, his voice was steady.
“I do hope you have managed to settle into your newly discovered omega nature by now?” Mycroft greeted with an unkind smile.
After another moment of frowning, John's expression softened and he squeezed Sherlock's leg gently. The Omega had been distressed ever since Mycroft had come to visit last week, but never told John why. He possibly didn't know himself.
“That is actually not that far off, John, good!” Sherlock complimented with a strange look of pride. He loved it when John was being clever, even if that meant that he just didn't exaggerate.
“When one tries to avoid Sherlock's attention, one learns to be discreet, hence this place. Your feet and back must be hurting you, please do take a seat.” Mycroft recited like a text he'd learned by heart, pointing his black umbrella at a chair John had walked past immediately, if not to show his spite.
“Because we want to go out for dinner later and if you retreat now, you won't be back in time unless I shake you. If I shake you, you get pissy.”
John felt like he was tied to the spot and white noise filled his ears. He was rigid beside Sherlock until the Alpha nudged him and suggested they leave. John had no idea how much of the conversation he'd missed. Once they'd left the street, Sherlock turned concerned eyes on him. “John, what happened?”
John simply smirk and stretched his limbs, resting his hand on where their pups were sleeping and his smirk transformed into a contented smile. “Your breakfast here yet?”
“I don't know,” he answered absent-mindedly, then corrected himself with a lie. “No, I'm fine. Bored.” A white lie, he thought. He gave John his 'I-was-in-thought-and-you-interrupted-me' reaction.
And so John did. They ate; both of them. But what John ate for lunch he skipped at dinner. His stomach was turning itself upside down just looking at the meat in the pan and Sherlock didn't push him. They went about peacefully and calmly. They were sitting on the sofa, watching the telly and not watching at all. Sherlock had fallen asleep where he was leaning back against John, both of them propped up sideways so John could massage his lower back a little. The pups weren't very big or heavy yet, but one of them apparently had taken on such an unfortunate position, that it was pressing against Sherlock's spine. Massaging his muscles did little to ease the pain coming mainly from his bones, but it eased both their minds, so it was good enough for now.
John flung a quick look to Sherlock, who look troubled and paralysed at the crying child. He spoke softly and lowly. “Lisa, we want to help your brother, but crying won't do us any good, hm? The faster we find him, the better, right?”
– but it was rather that he saw Sherlock cared. Cared for their pups. Cared for what John had given him. Cared for the little lives that were growing inside the Omega. And, yes, maybe he did like the idea and soon-to-be reality of Sherlock massively swollen, tight and monstrously large with their four children, why wouldn't he? Well fed, well off – him as their Alpha taking care and able to provide them, even if Mycroft's financial support was essential, with love and food and care and damn him, he would stay up night after night, go without food for days and pamper Sherlock only for the sake of him and their pups and he was more than thankful to not having to do so. And, yes, he admitted, the mere thought of what would become of Sherlock in the following months, especially with the pups growing as eagerly as they currently did, had him deeply aroused and ready to rut within seconds – just imagining his belly growing, feeling the tiniest changes in his own hands, watching his giant belly swinging as it brushed against their bedsheets ever so slightly while he mentally shagged Sherlock's brilliant brain out and against the headboard in a wild rut-...
His chest was so constricted, he could feel every muscle clamping down tighter bit by bit, encasing his lungs to the point where the intake of air was painful and every exhale allowed the grip to tighten one more fraction. Soon, he lay there, breathing flat and rapid, all of his muscles tensing up so strongly they jumped in visible tremors, his chest aching as if there was a whole ripped through him, his abdomen sparking in dark red pain.
He couldn't say he was hurt by this. After all, he'd just appeared in Sherlock's life and had nothing to do with his profession. That didn't mean that John would not have liked t be included. The Alpha's cases sounded like adventures and anyone knowing John, knew that the Omega desperately needed some of those. He was withering away in the flat. Eat, sleep, shower, repeat. He walked, yes, but the further his pregnancy got, the less he trusted himself to take walks. It wasn't so much that he couldn't move around easily any more – he was build to survive carrying large litters after all – but more that people's stares grew longer and more obvious every time he left the flat. While he could still walk appropriately, he couldn't run. Much less, he couldn't fight off hungry Alphas, and, right now, anyone looked like a predator to him. At times he wished Sherlock would claim him, even if just by rubbing his scent off on him and fucking him and leaving him to deal with himself after. At least then he knew his place. He'd never felt this vulnerable before.
John fidgeted under the situation. “Fine. Yeah. Good.” he said awkwardly, not knowing how else to diffuse the situation.
Sherlock turned to him and looked at him intently. “Do you want to find the boy or not?” John stammered the affirmative, but with further objections ready on his tongue. Sherlock gave him no chance to speak them. “Well, then we need to get going! We need to get as far as we can while we have the time!”
Sherlock shrugged. “I don't know. You're not outstandingly smart or handsome. Sure, you've got confidence, which is very attractive and tolerance for the weirdest of situations and people. You are compatible with the work, which is much appreciated. But why I love you, I can't explain. I just do. And I did before. Sometimes, I regret this bond as well because I never got to tell you how I felt when you would still believe me one hundred percent. Then again, if all this hadn't happened, I might have never told you in the first place. I just love you because that's how I feel for you.”
Sherlock made a small confirming noise in the back of his throat, starting to kiss his way along John's neck again. “You should call your work, tell them you're on paternity leave.”
“Mh, you'll get used to it.” John offered, obviously hopeful it would stop Sherlock from giving up their relationship.
When Sherlock emerged the toilet with the small jar and handed it to the doctor, he was instructed to get ready on the examination chair as she would draw blood then and bring both out to a nurse who'd get them to the lab.
He picked her up dutifully. “Yes, you help, too, “ he agreed. Kat liked having an overview from a higher position when helping look for the others. While Jacob toddled around between rooms, looking everywhere twice until he found Emmy behind the curtain of the other window in the living room, Kat pointed him to where he should look. He opened a cupboard, another cupboard, then the first cupboard again, before they discovered Alex hiding in the third one. All four were engaged in searching for Rosie, who turned out to have been on the couch all along, the thin throw blanket draped over her as disguise. As soon as everyone was found, they turned around to Sherlock, who put Kat back down on level with the rest. “Well, off to the bathroom then everyone!” Emilia made a disapproving noise. “No, we had an agreement. Come on,” he said gently, leading the way with Alex clinging to his hand. He handed four of them wash cloths and brushed their teeth one pup at a time while the others cleaned their faces and washed their hands in a little tub filled with soapy water. Diapers were changed and then they were off to Sherlock's bedroom. This was their favourite part, he had a feeling: getting to sleep in another bedroom than their father's. All their beds had been set up in here and Sherlock helped them inside. They kissed his cheeks goodnight and he draped their blankets over their little bodies. At last he sat down on the edge of his bed and reached for one of the books John had given him. “Which one would you like to hear?”
“I can call Kate up to the front, she works the Friday shift, but Ross isn't in.” she said arrogantly, trying to act away the fact that John's background scared her away just the tiniest bit – she was a cool and strong Alpha after all.
He could feel Sherlock gradually relax against him, his breathing becoming noticeable again. “She-..” he began, wobbly in his throat.
“But you cannot know for certain. What if, in fact, you will have a disabled child? Will you still keep it? Would you be able to raise it still or would you lose patience? What if you have a miscarriage? Will you try again?”
Lots of questions are asked. John finds himself in conflict with not only himself and the general society.
Something they both enjoyed, though, was their combined smells. Omega scents were usually mild anyway and therefore easy to combine, but when two lived together so closely, they had to fit perfectly or else they'd never be able to settle comfortably without even really knowing why. They happened to be a perfect match, and in more than just that category.
“They came very early.” Sherlock acknowledged the next morning over breakfast. “At least for what due date you told me.”
“Because” John drew out the word at least twice as much as he needed to, but this conversation was annoying him already. Again. “dear heart, I am about 5 times the size of you and the time I need to even get up, let alone waddle to the kitchen and try reaching the counter only to waddle back without spilling any of the hot chocolate on the floor – which I couldn't even dream of cleaning up – you could have been making six cups without the slightest difficulties.”
“You're pregnant! I won't fight you for the same reason you won't fight criminals over the remaining 6 months!”
“It's not though, is it? I'm going to lose it. It is already dead, isn't it?” John was kissing his temple, brushing sweaty locks from his forehead and tears from his cheeks. Stupid omega nature. It would be easier to not care right now.
John's steps were audible on his way up the stairs. Sherlock's insides screamed: his mate was back! This had to stop, it was consuming to much of his mind! “Hey, love, how've you been?” he asked, leaning down to kiss Sherlock.
Stupid biology – the only danger here was Sherlock shooting himself for this scene in front of John. “Why would I cover my scent if I was a Beta?!”
Lestrade consults with Sherlock and John about a case that reminds them of what lives they are actually living.
So, yes, if you find you're having difficulties with reading my story because you think the characters translated inadequately, please let me know and I'll give it a thought, but please do !not! tell me things like 'John is a lot more normal and emotional' because, honestly guys, he isn't. Pay attention and analyse his personality. That man may seem ordinary, but, even further than his addiction to danger, he really, really, isn't. He may, in fact, be even more complicated and shaded than Sherlock is and gets way too little credit for that *sigh*..
The Alpha was way over the hill, too affected by the strong omega hormones because he didn't leave, as suggested, but instead moved even closer, slinging an arm around Sherlock's body and leaned his face against his chest. “I'm sorry if you feel uncomfortable with this, Sherlock, but there's no way I'd leave you now. I can't, for two reasons, leave you. First: you're in heat, the first one ever. Your body has noted there is an Alpha and that Alpha has already taken care of you. Leaving you, an inexperienced, might cause impact on your psychology, whether you think that possible right now or not, but things like severe trust-issues could evolve up to depression with the dominant symptom of feeling unwanted and guilty for basically anything that's not your fault at all.
As soon as he did, John carefully guided him to lay on his side, budging up against his back, kissing it, leaving more hickies on his skin. Sherlock enjoyed it, the marks made him feel owned and loved. “I want you to sleep in my bed tonight. You did good today.”
They continued as before for weeks. Once or twice, John didn't even have the mercy to come to Sherlock and have him at all after making him wait upstairs. Those days, Sherlock couldn't even finish himself off; over-stimulated, too sensitive and disappointment replacing what sparks of lust he had left. On many evenings, John would ask him downstairs and made him watch telly with him. Most of it was boring, stupid, but Sherlock rarely paid attention to it. He usually just spent the time thinking. John didn't mind, he just wanted Sherlock downstairs.
John gaped at Sherlock like a stunned sloth as the man fired this information at him just before he could make for the stairs. “Uh, thanks.”
After a moment, John drew back from him to utter a soft “thank you” and then continued kissing him, snogging him, ending up with one leg pushed between the Omega's, sending him high up into arousal. Momentarily, there was a firm hand pressed to his belly and John was moaning into his mouth before progressing in his exploration of Sherlock's body like he had so many times before and yet never seemed to grow tired of. Had Sherlock been rather passive all the other times, it had been because of the unsure feeling the new and surprising situation had left him with; not knowing whether or not he wanted to keep the child; not knowing whether or not John would stay with him, had he chosen not to; not knowing how far their bond was actually working and going.
He didn't want to own John, of course. John was very attractive being the free and independent man he was currently living as. But a more primal part of his mind wanted to strap the Omega to his chest, the babies all around them and parade them around through London. Not many people had liked him and he could well see why. But nothing had ever made him so proud as John being his friend. Him and his beautiful children.
“Your fathers love you. I say that just for you to know and to never forget. Whatever happens, however much you might hate us sometime – we will always love you and we will be there for you.” he said to the cells inside his body, feeling like it was a confession to make.
I should stop starting new fics in such rapid succession, but I've been waiting for my mental prompt on how to start this fic for a couple weeks now and it just came to me and since I'm desperate for approval, I can't keep a chapter to myself for any length of time.
He answered with a weak wobble of his lips. It wasn't convincing, but she seemed happy enough, wiggling in her chair and giggling a little.
Sherlock yawned heartily and simply went to push a rush of unrest through the bond. He had learned rather fast how to block it out or regulate the intensity of emotions John would receive from him and just recently he had discovered the benefits of sending out fake markers. He could feel John calm down involuntarily, the natural response to his distressed mate. Sherlock could barely contain the smirk at his mate's annoyed huff as he knew Sherlock did this purposefully – he had noticed that the Omega had figured that particular bit out when Sherlock had coldly switched through all kinds of emotions while laying on the sofa with a lazy expression. It had driven John mad how he had sensed contentment, then loss, coming to love, scratching at envy, leading to boredom and finally settling on a bark of laughter at John's disturbed look at what was happening with his mate. In response, the Alpha blocked him out for the rest of the day.
“No you won't! Will you stop pretending and just accept that you need help for once!” Sherlock shouted, grabbing his arm, swallowing hard as he could easily reach all the way around his wrist. He got up slowly, confronting John directly. “I'm done with the charade, John. This isn't just about you anymore. You're here for me and for our children. If I am able to look beyond my own interests for the sake of this family, then so, the
“Take what is yours.” Sherlock ordered quietly and John followed, burying his nose in Sherlock's neck, holding him by the hips.
While John had a mild case of 'yeah, I was getting there' on his face, Lisa nodded. “My dad re-married 5 years after Tommy was born. I'm from his first Alpha, Tommy from the second. We now live with dad and a Beta, who's trying real hard to be a good mother to us. She's very nice, but I miss my mum. She died when I was young.”
“That's very brotherly of you.” John mocked. Wasn't that kind of what older siblings were supposed to do? Worry about their younger siblings? Furthermore, it was a weird way to show his concern. He had to get to the bottom of this. It was promising to be good. “Why ask me? Why not just ask him yourself? I get that you seem to have issues calling people on their phones, but you know where we live.”
John stopped her entering the living room by pressing his palm square against her torso and it seemed to work. His breathing was getting louder and more controlled, which Sherlock knew to interpret very well, especially after the Edwards case. “You do not touch my children. Get out of this house.”
Sherlock was texting Lestrade their location as John went over to the stirring Alpha and held both her hands against her back to prevent her from standing up. Within a few minutes, in which Sherlock wanted nothing more than, at the very least, a cigarette, the Alpha was taken away and no one but her, Sherlock and John knew what had happened just then.
So John would devour him. Lips pressed firmly together, tongues dancing the most incredible waltz and most energetic tango, until Sherlock was mewling for John to sate his newly discovered libido. They would give it two rounds at least in the morning, depending on John's work schedule. The week he'd been missing out had been discussed with the clinic and he could continue working the job. And so, after the marvellous rounds of sex in bed, there often came another round of hand jobs in the shower. And then, Sherlock was alone for a couple of hours and he used them to think. And he thought and thought for hours on end.
Sherlock considered this explanation. Finally, he nodded, apparently accepting it. “Does it happen a lot that Purists kill their twin? There was never even once a mention of one, so I would assume neither child was ever aware of one.”
“Is it possible for an Omega to impregnate an Alpha?” Sherlock asked again, more persuasively – was he not speaking clearly?
The question 'we?' died on John's lips before it left him. It was still a novelty to him that he got included in an Alpha's activities, but Sherlock had asked him to keep assisting him and he wasn't the kind of man to play cute. Further thought died as the doorbell rang and his head swung around instinctively, listening for activity downstairs. As ever, Mrs Hudson was at the door faster than should be expected at her age, not soon after, footsteps made their hesitant sounds on the stairs. John's heart clenched in a paternal manner when he saw their client come into the living room. The kid couldn't be older than 15, but the worry on her face was worthy of at least 20 years life experience. He got up and shook her hand, offered a glass of water and moved a chair for her to sit down on. When he came back with the water, Sherlock was just staring at her. It was a scary look to her, no doubt, but to John it was kind of adorable; he could tell the Alpha was trying to figure out how to talk to her without being intimidating, as was his usual strategy with adults.
“At the moment, it's looking that way.” the detective declared and dashed for the door, John right on his heels with a thankful hand gesture and Greg behind them after thanking her properly.
“No, I don't.” he refused, looking at Sherlock disbelievingly. “Do I?!” he asked in exasperation because if Sherlock deduced he did, he very likely did.
“Good because I'm not changing it!” John chuckled back into his chest. For a while they just stood there, inhaling each other's scent, their hands covering the small protruding bump on Sherlock's front. “I'm so glad you're back.” John whispered after a moment, his voice carefully calm, but Sherlock knew. They always knew.
John couldn't remember having ever been so doubtless, so determined, so reckless. Rationally, he knew this was a dangerous approach, that it might as well get him killed. But Sherlock was still at risk, had been for way too long and John would get him and their pups to safety, and if it killed him, so be it. He wouldn't live through one more god damn day without Sherlock safe and sound at home, lounging about, boring himself to death or blowing up the kitchen. No more nights having him bury his nose into anything Sherlock has ever just touched to have his scent and not go completely nuts. He had been so tense these weeks, people should consider themselves lucky he was more tired than anything because he could have easily killed out of frustration. Only now, that he had a lead on where his mate was, he was pumped high with hormones and energy, determined to do whatever it would cost to get them back. Screw Greg, he was going in
With his clean hand he reached for a tissue from his bedside table and cleaned himself up, then rolled onto his side, dragged his blanket up to his chin and tried to battle his own conscience. His girlfriend lived a few streets away and here he was, having just masturbated and not with her in mind. He felt bad and that he was treating her unfairly. He closed his eyes against the voices in his head and the emotions they stirred in him. He'd have to tell her tomorrow.
“Soul mates! I never actually met a couple like you, but Omegas in his condition tend to not let anyone but their soul mate touch them while awake. Had I known, I'd given this task to you right away... He's very badly traumatised and unable to sleep through his recovery undisturbed. He'll wake up many times for a few days just screaming from the emotional pain. It has sickened his body. You'll have to give him these to keep him as calm as possible. They are specially designed to fit pregnant Omegas.”
Mycroft immediately picked up on John's attention shifting back to him and resumed his inquiry. “What are your intentions?”
“Yes. Of course.. Thank you.” And just like that, the conversation was shut down again. John still wasn't quite sure what he'd gotten himself into this time, but at least the conditions seemed an awful lot better than with any of the other Alphas. Sherlock wasn't hitting him for speaking without a direct order and he had yet to touch John in any way other than giving him his coat. Plus, he had his own room, which was plenty of space and the most he's ever had just to himself. He'd have to wait and see how it goes.
In fact, two weeks after Sherlock had taken him home, the Alpha had shut down the auction house and a lot of its other locations and side-businesses as well. The papers called it an act of the government. The name 'Holmes' appeared not once in their stories.
Lisa shook her head. “No. At least I don't think so. Peter was always very kind and caring. He wouldn't scare his son like that.”
The man in front of them hesitated. “I already phoned the school and told them he was staying with his father for a while. Anything he does concerning school is in his Alpha's hands.”
Somehow, John felt offended by that. Mycroft not telling him off, indirectly acknowledging and approving of this being John's fault, the cold and detached demeanour with which he handled the disappearance of his own fucking brother, the nerve he had to question John's capability as an Alpha in this situation – it just had him boiling lukewarm. “And where were you when it happened, huh?! I know you have cameras practically everywhere, why didn't you intervene?!”
The Alpha shifted uncomfortably at the harsh words that sounded like accusations to his ears. “Of course, you'd notice. Recovering from so much crap and you still notice that I'm unwell – I should be flattered..”
John looked down unimpressed. “I don't want you to.” he whispered and for once, Sherlock was glad he had miscalculated.
“Yes, usually an Omega's growth spurts start after the first trimester, namely with the beginning of the fifth month. That's when even a small single pup starts making itself visibly known.”
Also, I wanted to briefly mention something: I am not new to the A/B/O universe in general, just never participated actively. I do know a lot of theories on biology and all, but I, as a biologically interested person, am taking my own shot at it, interpreting my way and developing own theories and dynamics. So, you might find things that haven't been written about, thought of or whatever yet, but keep in mind, that this story is my own interpretation and how it all works for me. This also translates in the characters as I expect it to do.
“I'm in my first heat ever, John. After 33 years of subconscious Omega gender identity, I guess it is only logical it would be... 'intense'.”
They had to wait for five more minutes, the venue steadily filling with Alphas and Betas. No one questioned John talking to one of the guests the whole time. Apparently, as a Beta or Alpha, you could do everything, even slack off at work.
“Is that so? Because I could swear I have just heard you deny your confession of love and all that you told me right before I bloody bit you in the right thought you wanted it- wanted
“John...”Sherlock moaned and tried to immediately forget he had just moaned John's name in front of John.
“Oh, dear, there are help programs, you know. The government financially supports single parents, you don't have to shoulder it all on your own!” she tutted him, shaking her head at his ignorance. She didn't seem to realise that John was aware of such aid programs and, for lack of fitting words, retreated with another smile.
He listened to the noises the wooden stairs made as he held the banister tightly, slowly making his way another floor up. When he arrived panting, he was glad to find a bed already in the room and immediately used the opportunity to sit down on it. Catching his breath, he looked around. The room was a little bleak and quite different from what downstairs looked like. The wallpaper was simple and white, while the ceiling was covered in wood panels, as was once fashion. John neither liked nor disliked that; he was just glad he was getting his very own room, with a bed and a closet that he couldn't even fill. He wasn't sure this was a luxury he'd keep for long, but somehow he knew Sherlock was different. Apart from the lack of interest Sherlock seemed to have for him, he was had a feeling of belonging around Sherlock and he was certain that the Alpha felt the same.
“You've been napping for half an hour.” Sherlock said with a slight chuckle in his voice. Then he straightened. “It was a rough day, I don't blame you. I'll be sleeping soon, too, I hope.”
Sherlock negated by extending on his question, thought not actually being able to complete it. “How long have we been...”
As soon as Sherlock opened his mouth, John's tongue darted out, accompanied by a longing moan and passed the liquefying sweetness over into Sherlock's waiting mouth.
He could have been bullied. Actually, that was something he could very easily imagine. Children could be real arseholes and he'd had his fair share of it when he'd helped out victims in his time, so someone as extraordinary as Sherlock was very easily pictured in their midst, pointed and laughed at, robbed of his books and pushed around.
“Right.” Sherlock sighed, a little disappointed, but honestly, what had he expected? To come home and just have sex for the rest of the day? Well, yes. He had, a little. But that had been foolish. He should know better than to expect John to just jump him after such a scare. John was much too caring.
He held out his hand and the boy took it in an instant, recognising the parental motivation in John's actions instinctively. They followed the crowd back to the back door, where they were trying their best to get out as fast and quite as they could manage. John pushed his way through and pulled back the ones that were already leaping towards the street, holding his index finger to his mouth and pointing at the kid by his hand. They agreed to protect the children among them as John squeezed his way back inside. He went straight for the dorms again and locked the young employee inside, stealing his keys. One of them looked like it might belong to a locker, so he snuck around, looking for wherever the employees got ready for their job. He thanked all powers that might be for it seeming to be a very guard-less day or time or whatever because he didn't come across a single Alpha or Beta the whole time. He quickly sought out the young employee's locker and found, as expected, his deodorant and cologne. It wouldn't convince anyone that John was an Alpha, but it might just be enough to make him seem like a Beta trying way too hard. If that kid was new, others wouldn't be familiar with him either.
On the other hand, if he sought out help now, he would have to leave Sherlock to himself; at this stage, an advice he wouldn't give. They wouldn't be able to finish the nursery, to buy necessary goods, let alone have Sherlock take care of himself. Someone could help, sure, but considering how Sherlock's condition had affected John, the Alpha didn't want to reverse the situation. He'd have to get himself up on his own somehow. If only he could keep the food down, that would help considerably.
“John, have we talked about all this? I remember a lot of talking, but I'm not sure I was in my right mind.”
.. I'm surprised you managed any breaks between rounds at all.. Your body must've been ready to burst with hormones.” John mused, obviously not noticing Sherlock's concerns – odd, considering they were bonded and should actually be sensing each other on a whole new level.
“Sherlock. Stop. Please. You'll regret it later.” John was trying to get him off of himself. Why did he so desperately want to get rid of him?! Was he not an adequate mating partner? Had he done something wrong? Disobey any rules? Why did John, his beautiful John, not want him? Was he not good enough? If so, how could he become good enough to please John?
“Sorry?” John asked in confusion. It was such a sweet sound. A sound that made everything seem in place.
There was a smirk playing the thin line of John's lips. It was kind of sweet, though his eyes made it look very predatory. “Compliments your skin very nicely. Your body's all pale, straight lines, it's a fine combination, looking up to find dark curls. Quite the elitist look. Wouldn't have guessed that could be my type.” the last sentence was merely a whisper in Sherlock's ear, which was immediately bit and trapped by a strong jaw. It hurt. Badly. The Alpha let go and dragged his tongue around Sherlock's ear. His breath was hot on the Omega's skin.
“Good, that's very good! A strong emotional bond between the parents is almost even more important for an unborn pup than a born one. But especially the intercourse is essential to keep the Omega's hormones balanced, give the pups a healthy growth and, of course, prepare labour. Being penetrated enough helps the Omega's ability to stretch and make birth easier – if it is a natural one. But I assume you know that, don't you?”
Mycroft discarded that statement instantly. “I would, of course, prefer that my concern go unmentioned.” Simultaneously, John's phone chimed again.
Just, please, communicate with me, because this story is making me feel horrible and if I can't improve it, I can't keep it.
think any less of you, okay? You are still my best friend and the most amazing person I have ever had the great fortune to meet. If there is anything I can do to help you, please let me know.”
John shook his head. “Didn't you notice? They weren't affected by his absence at all. Their acting was about as good as yours, no offense. That was no parental concern, Sherlock.”
A strong hand found its way to the back of Sherlock's neck as John leaned in to kiss him. “I mean it, John. I'm hungry.” the Omega whispered between kisses.
Next time he woke, it was to movement on the mattress. He blinked his eyes open to see John kneeling down beside him, stark naked, half-hard and beautiful as fuck, quite literally so. When John saw Sherlock awake, he turned around and grabbed for a tray loaded with sandwiches and drinks. So, he had been up to prepare nutrition. “How're you feeling? Hungry, I hope.” he asked softly, looking down at the ridiculous amount of food he had brought and smirking at his own overly careful attitude.
He heard Mrs Hudson tut at him and she soon joined him, just in time. He rolled over to get up on his knees, his arms stretching out in front of him to brace himself against the wall. It was quick and fairly easy, just a lot of pain. Many Omegas often described giving birth as pleasurable as the pups pressed against their prostates. John thought that might be true if you're having one or two, but with five of them, it really felt more like scratching and violent punching than caressing.
John then moved Sherlock onto his back and his legs up and towards his face, knees bending, letting his feet rest on his shoulders and John moved between his legs. “Mh, minor tearing,” he diagnosed, “nothing too wild. You'll get used to it, become more flexible.”
He circled the area, but was too impatient. John watched hungrily as he pushed one finger in, his sex seemingly pulling it further inside, hungry. The Alpha looked up and saw Sherlock's belly, standing taller than his cock, and he palmed his own erection. He craved to touch his mate, but there was this feeling building up again where it had just died down. That throbbing, that sickness. Sherlock's distress. Another Alpha pushing into his mate. It became John forcing himself on Sherlock, making him cry as he begged him to stop.
And so Sherlock did. He went limp for a second, then bore down against John's hand. The doctor retrieved it immediately, silencing the other Omega's whimper with a kiss and by drawing up his legs. Sherlock instinctively locked his legs at his ankles and pawed at John, mewling for him to do something.
“I just want to fuck you so badly..” John stated and he apparently knew how he sounded because there was a hateful note in the way he said it. He was losing control. John didn't like to lose control.
John looked back over at them just in time to see Sherlock handing the other man the note he'd written down just upon his arrival, accompanied by the simple order “leave.”
to talk about these days.. I've had more conversations with you these past 3 weeks than half the time in the year we've lived together before.” came the fake complaint, followed by another soft kiss to his head.
“Don't want to use my phone, number's on my website. Chances are it could be recognised.” Sherlock brushed him off and waited till he could hear John pick up the paper with the number on it. “These words exactly: What happened at Lauriston Gardens, I must have blacked out. 22 Northumberland Street. Please come.”
He closed his eyes and leant his head back against the cold wall to get his mind to focus. He could make out three scents: his own, his pups' and a masked one that smelled of a beta undertone. Beta and using scent masks? Unusual. Normally unnecessary. Which made it a brilliant technique.
Nevertheless, Mycroft's words remained present in the back of his mind. Danger was still lingering possibly anywhere.
“You won't find him...” he breathed, slowly getting back on his feet, mumbling something about being alright as he started a slow shuffle towards the door. Greg tried to hold him back, but John shook his head and walked on, so Greg accompanied him and drove him home, giving him over into his landlady's capable hands and swearing to leave no stone unturned until they found Sherlock.
He didn't care much, to be honest. He loved Sherlock and was loved back by him, which was all that counted to him in their relationship. What either of their hormonal changes did to the other was considerably irrelevant, whether they fucked like crazy or threw stuff at each other wouldn't matter to him, really – it was all a display of how much they both cared.
Sherlock himself chose a rather solitary lifestyle, while John just slipped into it by default. Still John liked to play the field; liked having Alpha partners. Sherlock had escaped this stereotype of an active male Omega all his life, simply by not being interested in sex; or people.
John, ever the soldier, would wake early and, because Sherlock was pregnant and John forced him to sleep even by his own methods, would wait an hour for his partner to find back to reality by himself and then nudge him awake, if he didn't wake on his own. After an hour of thought, John was usually erect and hungry for Sherlock's body, at least that was, what he made of John's relaxed state and powerful erection in the same context.
“No. You're not going to make promises again. You always say you'll do something about this, but you never really do. Sit down and eat that portion on your plate.” Sherlock ordered and John, unwillingly, complied.
“I see.. Mr. Holmes, how strong were the cramps, would you say, on a scale from 1 to 10?” the young woman asked, directing her gaze entirely to Sherlock now.
The elder lady scuttled out of her flat. “What, are you two out again already? I'm not your nanny, dear.” she tutted, but there was no protest in her expression.
He remembered that leather bind far too well. He knew that diagnosis far too well. He knew Mycroft was just trying to break his defences, but he couldn't help it. “What's that?”
For a second, the Alpha looked as if he were defeated. Then he pulled a trump out of his jacket pocket. “Trust issues, it says here.” he mentioned, making sure to give John a clear view on the little notebook before opening it.
And then it happened. Of course, it had to happen. It was more of his luck it hadn't happened for over a year.
He must have fallen asleep at some point because John shook him awake gently, face close to his own as he knelt in front of the furniture. He felt fingers brushing away some stray curls, but only had sleepy eyes for the smiling dark blue in front of him, the feeling of shaven skin under his palm and eager thin lips handing over the other's soul. His chest felt too tight again, like he was about to burst, but if it be, so be it.
“I don't know, Sherlock, I just.. avoided offers at some point..” John stammered, averting his gaze.
He took a sip from his water before digging into hi sandwich. The lettuce was used quite meagrely and the cheese tasted mostly of chemicals, but it was food and it was cheap, so he wasn't going to complain much. It did make him think, however. He'd started putting aside chunks of hi earnings into a savings account. It wasn't much, but in a few years time, he might be able to afford renting a flat somewhere in the outskirts of London. Or register his children for sports clubs. He sighed. No matter how he laid it out, if he wanted a better future for his pups, he'd have to give up on any dreams of living independently or finally getting a driving permit. Then again, for them he'd give up the last of his dignity and pride. In a better world, he'd earn the same amount as his Alpha and Beta colleagues, have a supportive partner and be eating fucking proper food. In a better world, he wouldn't be a purist. In a better world he'd be doing something nice to thank Sherlock for all his help.
“Oh, don't worry, dear!” the silver-haired woman said before Sherlock could say anything. “I trust an army doctor is quite capable of keeping a reasonable amount of control and I know if Sherlock hadn't wanted this, you wouldn't have been able to bind him, heat or no. He might be the only Omega in the line of our children, but we raised him just like his alpha brothers. He doesn't get ordered around unless he wants to.” she smirked.
Now John was making his way to the general direction of the desk in a snail's speed. He could feel the waiting patients down one corridor asking themselves why a patient in such a condition was allowed to leave his room, but he didn't care about them.
“I can always work from home.” Sherlock replied, hoping dearly Lestrade would give him cases anyway – he'd die of boredom without good occupation.
Sherlock and John left the building wordlessly. The cab-ride home was just as silent. Sherlock looked like he wanted to say something, but couldn't quite work out the words. John ignored it and looked out of the window. It made him feel horrible and unfair toward Sherlock, but he couldn't bear the conversation right now.
“Sorry, Sherlock, but you were the one who tried to push me into accepting any offers in the first place. I have finally agreed to it and I don't understand why you are now putting these childish fights between everything.”
Don't worry, John. We've got time.” Sherlock said lazily, knowing the water would not be too pleasant anymore anyway, but not meaning for the Alpha to add to his worries. John entered the bedroom, towel wrapped around him loosely. Sherlock eyed what he could see, the arms and legs that looked like seemingly barely more than sticks, the prominent collarbone, shoulder blades and chest revealing his ribs as John retrieved some clothes to take them back into the bathroom, hiding from his Omega's eyes. He knew Sherlock didn't like to see him like that, so he tried to show as little as possible. He let him walk past him, staring up at the ceiling, hands wandering to his belly and their growing pups, rubbing it idly. Even without the bump Sherlock was bigger than he'd ever been before; the hospital staff had made sure he reached the appropriate weight for his stage before releasing him. He looked at his fleshier hands. He was even heavier than he'd ever seen John, which wasn't that big a statement, since John had never really been any more than slightly chubby, his broad physique often making him look bigger than he really was, especially when standing next to Sherlock's old self. He wondered if John had felt like this back then, if it was the same worry that had made him urge Sherlock to eat at least three times a week when on a case. Though in all the time they'd known each other, Sherlock hadn't been as thin as John was now. He wished he knew how to go about it. John would never agree to going into hospital now, or frankly, ever. John was sensible, but he was even more proud, trying to care for himself rather than accept help, not unlike Sherlock himself.
Sherlock was watching him, trying to figure out something that was really bothering him ever since he had noticed John being absent when he slept. He'd felt it very early on, just his dreams changing abruptly, the scenery getting dark cold and lonely. John was cutting him off in those times. Maybe he didn't want Sherlock knowing what he talked about to his therapist? But then, how many appointments has he had? More than one a week was more than unusual. John was keeping a secret from him, which worried him. He only worked that out now, which, frankly, alarmed him. Could that explain the constant guilt in John's eyes? Had he deduced wrong?
John considered this for a moment. “It's cruel, isn't it. He was just a child – young, innocent, naïve. I think as long as we make sure to educate them about these things, they'll do just fine.” It seemed like something John would say to make him feel better, only it had something bitter about it.
Sherlock's exasperation was obvious. “Definitely my brother.” he breathed, sinking into his armchair. “Just don't talk until John gets back, or do, but not to me. At me, I won't be listening.”
John immediately pulled his distressed mate closer, kissing his hair and caressing his back. “See? All is fine.. It's alright, Sherlock.. We're alright.” he said, brushing through his curls, concentrating on their bond to let Sherlock feel his love and affection.
“Uh, yeah, uhm.” John said, scratching his head as he tried to figure out working time management for this added activity. “Sherlock's still sleeping and I gotta go drop off this lot at the daycare in about 5 minutes, can we do this after? I have some room for until my shift starts.”
“Shh.” Sherlock whispered back to him, slowly taking his body to the empty side of the bed. “I know you are growing as desperate as me, but unlike you, I can't hold back any more. You are going to watch.” the Omega explained and John's eyes widened.
There was a voice in his ear and a hand between his thighs. There were no real words and the voice was distorted, but it was comforting, it made him feel safe in the embrace of the Alpha. Warmth spread through his chest. He felt loved and appreciated for the first time in decades. The humming in his ear turned into a high pitch, whining, crying. He was conscious with a snap. The fingers nudging at his hole were his own and the cry was one of his babies. A brief pang of guilt was quickly pushed aside by grabbing a tissue and hand sanitiser and tending to his child. Soft fleece was a weird whisper against his fingertips as he bounced Rosie on his hip, shushing her softly. The bit of contact seemed enough to calm her down, but she remained restless, so John decided to take her downstairs. He didn't want the others awake as well yet. He set her down on the floor by his armchair, where Sherlock could have an eye on her while he used the loo. He didn't ask, he knew the Alpha would ignore him at best and tell him off at worst when engrossed in an experiment. Sherlock looked out for them on his own accord and without really noticing it, but John knew instinctual behaviour better and he certainly knew concern when he saw it, however cautious it may be.
Which, in turn, made Sherlock resist him all the more. “I told you I don't want her. I will not be bonded to that woman. Dr Watson asked me to stay with him and I found his offer very appealing, so I chose to say yes to him.”
“Because I won't talk to you about what bothers me?” John asked, though it didn't much sound like a question.
Still in semi-service mode, John kept his gaze level. Sherlock scrutinised him head to toes. “Very good.” He answered confidently.
“Come on,” John encouraged him with a smirk and a predatory look, “skinny boy like you, long legs, full of grace and rebellion? I bet you look fantastic when you're dancing.”
The question and, much more, the calm way Sherlock asked him, caught John off-guard. He looked his mate in the eye, as honest as honesty gets, he answered “yes.” Instead of a much expected look of hurt and disappointment, The Alpha found understanding on Sherlock's face. “Sometimes. Not because I don't love you, but because I keep asking myself whether or not you would have said yes if you'd fully known what you were doing. It was a wake moment, yes, but it wasn't clear. You never gave lawful consent.”
“I might have mentioned that's what purists do? Mum said I was talking in full sentences at a little under 2 years old. Not fluent, but coherent. I don't know if they were more worried about me being so quick or Harry being normal..” Something like an old joke crossed John's features and Sherlock couldn't help but admit to himself that he's absolutely gorgeous like this. “Anyway,” John said, shaking his head and lifting Rosie out of the chair, “I expect their first words any day now. Normal babies start at this age and even if for them the words don't have a real meaning yet, the fact that this lot hasn't even really tried yet tells me they're not going to be geniuses. Just like your papa, hm?” John says that last bit to Rosie, sat on his hip, and smiles fondly. Sherlock wants to disagree, but doesn't. He pretends to observe his experiment as John gets the other four to have breakfast. The tissue sample had nothing more to offer him.
“Yes, does John Watson live here?” she asked in the tone of someone who is used to getting answers. Not unusual for Alphas, to be honest, but that did not make her sound any more polite to Sherlock.
“As opposed to everything else you usually strategically place there?” John made there was no bite in his voice. Sherlock looked at him with such a soft grin, John thought it looked almost domestic. It was nice to think Sherlock might one day settle to be someone's Alpha and he thought he'd do a good job as well.
Sherlock looked at him with an expression so open, it was a little foreign even to John. “Don't you?”
Sherlock grew more desperate to lend a hand as weeks passed and cases were rare, but he didn't know how to approach John. He couldn't figure out a way to suggest his aid without making it sound like John needed help, needed someone, was independent. He knew John didn't
“JOOHN!” he shouted as his orgasm hit, shaking violently as John sucked him dry until there were John's arms holding him steadily and guiding him to the floor safely, John's scent filling him with calming hormones of his own arousal, John's voice whispering soft praises. There was John. Just John.
“Tea.” Sherlock snapped aggressively, interrupting her pointedly by setting down a tray with empty cups and a steaming kettle with a pang. Six eyes fixed on him, four of them seriously surprised, John's, however, with a questioning frown.
That's also what John found so erotic about Sherlock eating: it wasn't that he wanted to see him soft and fat, not that there was anything wrong with that – everyone has their kinks and who was he to judge, as long as no one was actually
Sherlock drew up a chair for John to sit in and the Omega took a seat gratefully. Greg ordered Donovan to take the place John had left open next door, then he sat down opposite John. “The hell was that?” he asked, though his voice sounded much softer than his words.
Sherlock fixated him with a sharp, intrigued gaze. John felt the Alpha willing him to come to the same conclusion as him. “Think. Why would someone young enough not to have their own email account contact a detective operating privately without their parents' consent?”
“Aren't you supposed to feed them?” the Alpha asked instantly, remembering that there actually were now five little human beings in this house.
Sherlock saw John grab for his phone on the night stand on his side of the bed in his peripheral vision, his focus staying on his tainted trousers. “I'm losing it, John, aren't I?”
Sherlock propped himself up to look at John. “It's the first time you ever told me.” he passed remark.
The men had said it to be unlikely he lost it now, but what did they know about his medical past? To be fair, it wouldn't come as a surprise, if all the drugs had killed his insides so far, so that he couldn't properly carry. One hears about these kinds of complications all the time, right?
“Do consider these thoughts to be possibilities, John. For the sake of my brother – think and talk about every unfortunate scenario before it gets chance to set in.” he barely heard Mycroft say.
While Sherlock never ceases to love John, this whole being-pregnant-deal leaves him a little uncomfortable.
Sherlock looked at John, frowning a little. John answered with a loving kiss, that Sherlock returned only too happily.
Two hours later, Sherlock cautiously entered the room and lay down the invitation letter on John's desk. As he turned to leave again, he faltered, stopping and looking at the collection of humans, short and tiny on the queen size bed. The door in hand, he watched John and his pups snore lovingly against each other for a moment, then left them alone.
Sherlock's breathing became ragged rather quickly, as expected and John took himself in hand to masturbate along to the Omega's arousing noises.
In a lesser world, an attractive alpha woman wouldn't sit down next to him. “You look gloomy,” she said cheerily. Her voice was soft but confident. He took a liking to it instantly.
